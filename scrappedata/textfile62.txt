I had a Friday Night Lights fic up but deleted it because I never had the motivation to write it anymore. Well I'm going to try this again. Please read, review and enjoy.. if it sucks don't be too harsh please? lol Odessa, Texas-1988 \"You guys going to the party tonight?\" Nicole Baker asked as she sat beside her friend Don Billingsly at Buddy's, a burger joint frequented by the football players and cheerleaders of Permian High School. \"You know I am. What about you Chavo?\" Don asked as Brian Chavez popped French fries into his mouth. \"I think so.\" Chavez said with a smile as Nicole drunk some of her soda and made a face. \"What the hell? Donnie what kind of shit did you put in this?\" Nicole asked as Don held up a brown bag with liquor in it and smiled causing Nicole hit him upside the head. \"Ow!\" \"You know if you sit over here he is going to do that.\" Mike Winchell said as Nicole nodded in agreement and ordered another drink. \"Why don't you sit with the rest of the cheerleaders?\" he asked. \"Trying to get rid of me are you?\" Nicole asked with a smile as Mike smiled and shook his head. \"No. It was just a question.\" \"I'm not going to sit with those two-faced bitches. Besides you guys have been my friends for as long as I can remember.\" Nicole said as David brought her another drink and brought Mike the food he had ordered for his mother. \"Here's your mom's food Mike. How is she doing?\" David asked. \"She's doing fine sir. How much?\" \"This is on the house don't worry about it. Let her know that I asked about her okay?\" David said as Mike nodded at him. \"You never give me free food David.\" Don said as David rolled his eyes at him. \"I just did. Did you forget?\" \"Oh yeah I forgot about that.\" Don said sarcastically as David began to walk away. \"Take care Mike and stay out of jail Billingsly.\" David said as he walked back into the restaurant. Chavez and Nicole laughed as Don rolled his eyes and Mike kept quiet and ate his food. \"You need to lighten up Mike.\" Nicole said as Mike just looked at her. \"Yeah Mike. You are going to have fun tonight. You are going to get drunk and if I have anything to say about it you are going to get laid.\" Don said as Chavez shook his head. \"I'm not going to go out drunk foolin'.\" Mike said as he took another bite of his burger. \"You don't have to get drunk. Just come out and have fun.\" Nicole said as her, Chavez and Don got up and began to leave. \"Please?\" She asked with a pout as Mike smiled and followed her out the door. ~Party~ The party officially started once the football players and cheerleaders arrived. Don went straight for the beer and came back handing them all a glass. Nicole took a sip then looked back at Mike who stood against the wall looking out of place. She shook her head as she saw Don who was downing beer that was being poured into a funnel. Nicole turned around as she saw Melissa flirting with Mike who was obviously not interested. She gave a small smile as she listened in. \"I'm Melissa. Mike right?\" Melissa asked with a smile. \"Yes it is, and I know who you are Melissa.\" Mike said faking a smile as he looked over her shoulder at Nicole. \"How come you don't have a girlfriend?\" Melissa asked. Mike looked at Nicole again as if he was asking her to help him. \"I don't know I just…\" Mike began to say but was cut off as Nicole walked over to him and kissed his lips gently. Nicole broke the kiss and looked at Mike who looked shocked. \"Hey baby. I've been looking for you.\" Nicole said as Mike put his arms around her waist. \"Oh hi Melissa.\" She added as Melissa looked at them with a shocked look on her face. \"How long have you two been going out?\" Melissa asked as Nicole looked at Mike with a smile. \"Since summer. Talk to you later Melissa.\" Mike said as he grabbed Nicole's hand and led her out into the dancing couples. \"I owe you one.\" Mike said as Nicole put her arms around his neck again. \"No problem. You owe me a dance cowboy.\" Nicole said with a laugh as Mike laughed and began to dance with her. ~Later~ Ciera Hennigan walked slowly into Taylor's house and looked at the people around her. The people consisted mostly of the Permian football team, their girlfriends and the cheerleaders. A group Ciera wasn't apart of at all, but one of the cheerleaders she tutored invited her so she figured why not pass it up. \"Hey Ciera!\" The head cheerleader Jennifer said as she walked over to her. \"Let me introduce you to everybody.\" She said as Ciera smiled at her. \"Ew why did you invite her?\" a cheerleader asked as Jennifer smirked. \"Yeah I thought this was a party not a science club meeting.\" Another said causing the others to laugh. \"I can't believe you had the nerve to show up. Wow.\" Jennifer said with a laugh as Ciera turned around and ran right into someone. \"Hey what's the rush?\" Ciera looked up and saw the handsome face of Brian Chavez looking down at her. \"Woah. What did they do to you?\" He asked as she noticed the tears. \"Jennifer invited me here then humiliated me. I'm her math tutor.\" Ciera said as Chavez gritted his teeth and walked over to Jennifer. \"Hey Chavo. Long time no see.\" Jennifer said with a smile as Brian glared at her. \"What's your problem?\" She asked as she noticed his expression. \"You know what. Inviting someone here then humiliating them when they don't deserve it. How much of a bitch could you be?\" Brian asked as Jennifer opened her mouth in shock. \"I don't know what you are…\" \"Chavo what's going on?\" a voice asked causing Brian and Ciera to turn around. \"Oh just the usual Nicole. Jennifer's being queen bitch. She invited her tutor here just to humiliate her.\" Brian said as Nicole pushed past them and got into Jennifer's face. \"Listen here bitch.\" Nicole said causing Jennifer to glare. \"If I hear you putting down one more person I swear I'll rearrange that face of yours.\" She added as Jennifer stepped back and smirked. \"You wouldn't do a thing. You see I'm head cheerleader. What I say goes. If you get suspended you won't be on the squad and then you won't be eligible for that scholarship anymore. You wouldn't touch me.\" Jennifer hissed as Nicole smiled a little bit. \"Really? Try me. Unlike your little two-faced bitches I'm not scared of you. That shit doesn't fly. Back off and let her have a good time or else.\" Nicole said as Jennifer and her friends quickly scattered. Chavo gave Nicole a high five as she turned around to face Ciera. \"Not everyone on the squad is a bitch. Hi I'm Nicole.\" Nicole said with a smile as she shook Ciera's hand. \"This here is Brian Chavez or Chavo as we like to call him.\" She added as Chavo gave her a smile and shook her hand. \"It's nice to meet you both.\" Ciera said as she looked down. \"Well, I hate to leave you two hanging but I'm going to find Mike again. Have fun y'all. Nice to meet you Ciera.\" Nicole said as she waved and Chavo looked over at Ciera with a smile. \"So want a drink?\" ","Summary":" Hey guys I thought I'd take another shot at this.

The street was dark as he walked across it to anpale blue house across his. He stumbled along side the house untilnhe found i her /i bedroom window. Tears threatened tonfall as he tapped his duck taped hands on the window. A sleepy-eyednbrunette popped into view and her eyes widened when he held up hisnhands. She motioned him to go to the backyard and he nodded. Henwalked back there, grateful they didn't have a fence. He scanned thentiny backyard and sat down on the picnic table. A few seconds later,nhe saw her come out with a white box in her hands. He knew this boxnvery well, as it held the first aid supplies she used to nurse hisnwounds. She was dressed in a white tank top and black sweats. Hengrimanced for having woken her up. She sat down next to himnand sighed. \"What happened this time, Donnie-boy?\" Don shrugged his broadnshoulders and mumbled, \"Dad caught me and Maria on the couch,nand I had knocked over a lamp. I said I dropped it and he startednranting about how I couldn't hold on the football. Then...\" He held up his duck tapednhands and she rubbed his back.

She placed a comforting hand on his taped one andnwhispered, \"None of this is your fault. Your father is andrunken bastard stuck in the past.\" She set down the box andnopened it.

Tears slid down his face whennhe saw the broken window. The state ring felt cold and slick in hisnsweaty palm and he tucked it into his jeans. He stepped out of the carnand saw someone coming towards him. It was Stephine. She appoarchednhim slowly, her hands tucked into the pockets of her jacket. Herneyes widened when she saw the window and looked at him. \"Your father?\" Don walked to her andnburied his face in her neck. He heard her gasp and wrap her armsnaround him tightly. He couldn't speak, the tears just flowed fromnhim. Stephine rocked him, which made him cry harder. When he triednto pull away, she whispered, \"No, Don. Let it out. I'm sonsorry about tonight and about your dad. I hate him for what he putsnyou through.\" Don pulled away slightlynand looked at her. He sniffed loudly and asked, \"Why do youncare so much? Am I even worth it?\" She surprised him when shenleaned forward and kissed him softly. It took him a second to react,nhe was so stunned. He tightened his grip around her waist and feltnher run her fingers through his hair, gripping it at his neck. Henran his slightly chapped lips over her soft, tender ones and heardnher moan.

I'm trying my best . I hope it's not a disappointment. This is starting off the day before the pre-season practice in the movie. Disclaimer - I do not own Friday Night Lights or the characters from the movie. I may make up a few of my own though. Enjoy. Don Billingsly stepped out of his semi-decently air conditioned house into the hot Odessa sunlight. He turned his head and saw the Permian Panthers sign in the yard. 'Don Billingsly #26' He sighed heavily. He loved football. Probably more than anything else at the moment, but no matter how much he loved it he hated it too. Every season since the first practice he felt as if he had to live up to an impossible expectation. His father was a legend, everyone knew him, and even though Don was a decent player, he would never be Charlie Billingsly. He did not want to become his father. Sure, he would like to be as good a player as he was but he didn't want what came with it. Not the drinking and certainly not the boring nothingness that had consumed his father's life. He wanted out of this town and he knew that if he ever succeeded, he sure as hell wouldn't be looking back. Each time he thought of getting however, out a voice in his head told him it wasn't going to happen. He did not want to believe it, but it was hard to fight that voice. It was hard to fight the curse that had hung over his head since the day he was born. People got out of this all the time; not people like him though. He knew that there was no chance in hell of getting a football scholarship; he just wasn't good enough. He didn't try hard enough in school to get one for anything else. Realizations like these made him want a drink and that made him feel like his father; and feeling like his father made him feel sick to his stomach. Despite the qualms he had about the future, he was ready for football to begin. He felt the urge to hit something. Don stopped at the end of his driveway and looked both directions. Chavez would be there any moment to take him to the last first day of the season ever. He looked towards the house and runs a hand over his weary face. Maybe, just maybe his father would stay away from the stadium today. He drank more than usual last night, so it's possible that he would sleep through the morning training session. It was the little joys in life that kept in going and avoiding his father was one of the most joyous occasions. The honk of a horn broke him out of his daze and he looked up as Chavez pulled into his driveway. He smiled slightly as Chavez waved at him from behind the wheel. \"Hey man,\" he said as he buckled up. \"Ready to go be perfect?\" Chavez pulled back onto the road and headed toward the school, chuckling lightly. \"Are you ready to be perfect?\" he countered. Don shook his head and smiled. This was another little joy in life that kept him sane. Chavez was always there to remind that life was something the was meant to be enjoyed. \"Think this year's gonna be any different?' Chavez asked. Don looked at him then turned his gaze back to the road in front of him. The looming question that seemed to be hanging in more than just his own mind had popped up once more. He thought about it for a moment. \"We still in Odessa?\" Don asked, looking at Chavez again as he smirked and nodded. Don looked out the window into the barren land. He watched an oil pump go up and right back down as he slowed for a stop sign. \"Then there is no well in hell that this year will be different, other than the fact that it's probably gonna be your last one here.\" Chavez scoffed. \"And what about you Don?\" \"Me? I'm gonna be stuck here for a long time,\" Don said emphasizing the word long. He knew that something had to change though. Each day was passing him by with the same monotony and it was becoming a routine that he had no desire to be stuck with. He wasn't sure how much more of it he could take without anything to look forward to. \"We better win state man,\" Chavez said with a slight laugh. Don smiled to himself; that might make him feel a little better. He needed to remember to embrace the small joys in life. He needed to get through the season without giving up or giving in to the pressure of being perfect. He needed to find something more. Ok so that was the best that I could do and I hope that it was at least ok. Please tell me what you think.

The gossip mill of this small town was almost quicker then shine to the system. In a matter of a day, it seemed every church going, football loving, blue blooded American member of Odessa, Texas had knocked on her family's front door with big smiles and bigger egos. No matter how much coaxing her parents put into getting Emily to say hello to anyone. Let them deal with their own misery… \"Emmy, please get the door!\" Elisabeth Arnesen called from up the stairs just as the doorbell rang. The unfortunate thing about having these specific parental units as parental units, was that they were sly. \" Dad!\" Emmy hollered from her perch by the living room window,\" Get the door!\" \" Kinda busy, dear!\" a voice came up from under her, apparently from the basement. Why was he in the basement? Weren't there boxes to unpack somewhere else in this house? With a huff, Emmy slid out of her window seat and stalked towards the door. Life was horrid; horrid and cruel and unsympathetic. She had gone from a private school in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to a governmentally funded public school that seemed to be surrounded by a football obsessed community. Oh the joy. While she hadn't been Ms. Popular back at St. Peter's, at least it was familiar. Large city based upper class kids with ambition on the professional and social levels. Another world entirely as far as she was concerned, and as it went, she wasn't about ready to accept it any time soon. She had left behind friends, a great education, her childhood home, and a great boyfriend for this place, and just because her father had been transferred to a brewing company down south. Abraham Arnesen had always been up for a challenge, so there was no point trying to sway him away from going, but it was an even greater challenge trying to convince him that maybe having Emmy stay with family up north for her senior year up till college would be a wise idea. Obviously her presence in Odessa, Texas is the result of a futile attempt. Emmy rounded the corner to the entry hall for the front door, praying it was just some kid delivering cookies for his family, the younger the better, because they didn't like to stick around for long. There was no way of telling though through a thick wooden door though. \" Yes?\" snapped Emmy as she cracked the door open. Her eyes examined the damage. A middle aged man, wife, and son, or so it seemed. The younger male was fair haired like his mother and stood somewhat awkwardly behind them staring down the road. Emmy took little notice of him, figuring like she he had been dragged into something he didn't want. Averting her eyes to the woman, Emmy couldn't help but give a forced smile back. She seemed polite enough, but the fact still remained they were on Arnesen turf, therefore they were walking on her cement steps. What caught the seventeen year old girl by surprise was when the same look of observation was returned. The man held her gaze, measuring up her daringness. What he didn't seemed to forget was that she didn't know nor care who he was, and what he obviously hadn't figured out yet was Emmy was pretty bold. \"I'm Charles Billingsley,\" the man said at last after the few moments of silence,\" This is my wife Beth, and my son Donnie. We heard there were some new folks in town and decided to come say hi,\" Emmy nodded her head once in a fake understanding. They had to be the thirteenth group of people to pull that line out today. It's hard to feign respectful mannerism when all she wanted was to be back home…her real home. \" Um, well my parents are a little busy at the moment getting everything unpacked, but thanks for the welcome,\" her tone was almost sarcastic as she began to shut the door. \" I hear you're a Senior,\" the woman spoke up before she could achieve her clear message of dismissal. \" Yeah…\" this made Emmy uneasy. How much did the town know about them already? \"Just finishing up high school here I guess,\" \" Don's a senior to-\" Beth began, her face lighting up a tad bit with motherly pride only to be stomped on by her husband's interjection. \" On the football team too,\" Just the way Mr. Billingsley rose his chin a little irked Emmy in every way. 'And I care why?' she wanted to ask, but refrained. ~*~*~ It was then that Don looked at the newcomer. He had heard that she was the same age as him from his mother, and his mother had found out from Mrs. Browning who was a secretary at school who had found out from the principle because he had gotten the transfer script. Apparently little Ms. Priss came from some boarding school up north or something where future lawyers and shit come from. He hadn't expected her to be pretty though. Maybe like snobbishly good looking or something, but not his type. Yet, there she stood with dish water blonde hair running loose down her back with cut off jeans and a tank top. Under any other circumstances, he would have made a move or two, but not now. Not with his father standing there ready to humiliate him one way or another and not with her clearly annoyed with them. She might be easy to look at, but so far she flashed a big blinking light above her head that read 'bitch'. Ah, well one of the other guys on the team would snag her up sooner or later. When the rare few new kids went to school, they either did one of two things. They either only lasted a few weeks at most before begging their parents to move or they adapted to the culture. He could see her adapting pretty well to Odessa. \" That's,\" she paused for a second,\" Interesting,\" she wasn't interested though, and Don didn't need to have a four point oh to figure that our,\" Well, have a good day,\" it was the second time she was going to shut the door on them, but Don didn't really mind. \" See ya at school then,\" he tipped his hat to her before she could successfully close the door on his parents and self. \" Rude girl,\" the eldest Billingsley male bluntly states, tucking his hands into his blue jean pockets and stepping off of the porch. Beth followed suit, grabbing onto his elbow as they walked. \" She's new Charles…it must be tough moving all the way from Wisconsin,\" his mother always gave people more credit then they deserved. \" Wherever she's from, I don't care. She's in MOJO land,\" Charles turned to his son and stared him down,\" You git to practice now,\" *** Practice was the usual. Get beat around, yelled at, and pissed off. His father had showed up later on, drunk out of his mind which meant the usual moan and groan fest from the stands about how he couldn't hang onto the ball. The guys were wiped out from Coach Gaines. Donnie always felt the pressure like no other. \"Git up, Billingsley. Git up, boy,\" he would hear the head coach say, all the while his father was up n the stands screaming and stomping around like a mad man. \" Yo, hear there's some new chica in town. My ma wanted the family to go say hi today…\" Chavez said, wrapping a towel around his waist. \" Well if it counts for anything, I don't expect her to last long here,\" Don laughed, pulling on his t-shirt. By then the whole locker room within hearing distance was turned to hear the news. Locker room gossip, sometimes they were almost worse then the girls on the cheerleading squad. \" Hey, Don. No one really gives a shit wat ya think. Point is if she's hot or not,\" Donnie's nostrils flared a little at this. Leave it to Boobie Miles to ruin whatever it was he was trying to say. \"Why, Don? She some sheltered Christian girl? Cause you know we got those around here too,\" the locker room broke out into laughter. All Donnie could do was shake his head at them. They'd find out soon enough. \" School's tomorrow, guess you'll see then huh?\" was all that Donnie said before pulling his practice bag over a shoulder, nodding his good-bye, and exiting out the back to the parking lot. Some of the footballers called out wanting to know what he had meant. Others simply shrugged it off. \" You played like ya had a broom up yer ass, boy,\" the words came before the man did, but Donnie didn't need to see him to know what was coming. His dad had to lay into him one way or another. Senior year meant a championship ring on his finger, and if there wasn't…well what a shame right? \" Well did ya?\" it was the sort of instigation that Donnie had learned to ignore; shrug off everything that the drunken bastard voiced. \" I'll meet ya at home later, dad. Go home,\" for the first time he turned to look into those eyes, the ones that were always full of disappointment and scorn. Luckily Beth was right behind her husband, pulling at his arm. At times Donnie almost pitied his mother. How she could sit there in the stands hiding her embarrassment while the man she was married to was parading up and down the sidelines yelling at the top of his lungs. How she could just sit there and allow Charles to humiliate their family. But all that was replaced by the fact that Beth never did a damned thing about how his father treated him. It was what she was known for. The poor helpless mother and wife who could only stand by while world war three brewed up in her living room. \" You better work on those catches, boy. Ya hear?\" to make a point Charles held up a finger, pointing it in Donnie's face before allowing his wife to drag him off towards the truck. If there wasn't one thing that Donnie was going to do tonight, he was going to get drunk off his ass.

CHAPTER ONE It was a blistering summers day in Odessa, the sun glared down on the three girls as they walked around the town, sweat had started to bead on Heather's skin. Melissa sighed, fanning herself. \"We should head to the mall. That A/C would feel amazing right about now.\" They entered the mall and grabbed a table in the food court. The place was pretty empty; most of the town had gone on vacation or were still in bed at ten in the morning. Heather usually was, too. But last night had a significant lack of parties and the three girls had turned in early out of boredom. \"You guys want anything?\" Heather eyed her two friends who shook their heads. Heather pushed out of her seat and headed towards the opposite side of the mall's food court, towards Dairy Queen. \"Hey, can I have,\" Heather looked up at the cashier and paused. \"Don? Since when does Don Billingsley have a job ?\" Don chuckled. \"A guy's gotta do something before football season. And you're lucky as it's my last day.\" Heather shook her head in awe. \"I know. But for you, that usually means partying until dawn and sleeping until dusk.\" Don shrugged, a small smile still on his features. \"Yeah, whatever. What can I get you, H?\" \"Just a chocolate milkshake for me, thanks.\" Heather handed Don some change and waited patiently as Don made her order. She was still confused at the sight of him holding a job. \"You still dating that guy from Midland?\" Don asked once he reappeared. \"You know it ain't right to date the enemy.\" Heather glanced up at Don, her features pulling down into a frown. \"You mean Gary? Nah, he dumped me for one of his cheerleaders.\" \"What a dumbass.\" Don shook his head. \"You're one of the hottest girls around. Don't see how he could do any better.\" Heather rolled her eyes. \"Thanks, Don. Now can I have my milkshake?\" Don reached over the counter and handed her the frozen drink. Heather gave him a nod in thanks and turned back around with the intention of heading back to her table. \"Go out with me.\" Don hollered after her. \"Tonight. We'll go for a drive. Get some food.\" Heather spun back around. Don was grinning at her with endless confidence and Heather wondered where he got all of it. She raised a brow. \"You think I'd go out with you, Billingsley? Not a chance. I know how you are.\" His smirk just got wider. \"I can be different. I can treat you real good, show you a real good time.\" Heather scoffed. \"I know you can show me a good time. That's what I'm afraid of.\" \"C'mon,\" he pleaded with her. \"It's just a date. What could go wrong? If you hate it you can tell me to fuck off.\" \"Sorry,\" she shrugged her shoulders. \"I'm sworn off jocks after Gary. Especially those with your rep.\" She turned around again, this time with finality. \"See you around, Don.\" She called over her shoulder. \"You'll change your mind, H. You'll see.\" Heather sat back down at her table. Maria and Melissa watched her, their eyes lit up with excitement. \"Now, don't tell me Don Billingsley just asked you out and you said no?\" Maria said, her gaze flickering to the Dairy Queen where Don was leaning lazily over the counter. \"H, he's a dime. Have you gone blind?\" Heather slurped at her milkshake. \"No, I'm just not an idiot. Don only thinks with one thing and it's not his brain.\" \"So, what?\" Maria replied instantly. \"Why not just have some damn fun? You take everything so serious.\" \"Sorry, Maria but I'm not you,\" Heather said, looking at Don who was already looking at her, a grin on his face. He knew they were talking about him. \"I like serious.\" The other girl let out a heavy breath, her green eyes rolling behind her lids. \"I know you do. Sometimes I don't even know how we became friends. You're a bore .\" \"Now, Maria,\" Melissa cut in. \"Leave Heather alone. Better to be a bore than a whore like you.\" \"Watch your mouth!\" Maria yelled back in response but her features were laced with humour. Heather leaned back in the cold metal of her seat, zoning out of the activity between her two friends and instead focused solely on chugging back her milkshake. She started thinking about how this was her last real summer, that next summer would be filled with obsessing over college. Maybe Maria had said something right after all, Heather deserved a little fun - especially after a bad breakup. But she wasn't sure she wanted Don Billingsley to be apart of that fun. She wasn't that careless. \"So, H, you going to Chavez's party tonight?\" Melissa asked, bringing Heather back into reality. \"Oh, he's having one?\" Heather said and Melissa nodded slowly. \"Yeah, I'll be there. Wanna get ready at my place? My parents are headed out to Dallas for the weekend.\" \"You know I'll be there,\" Maria replied smugly. \"And I'll have plenty of beer to share.\" \"Sounds like a plan then.\" Around eight o'clock, Melissa and Maria showed up on Heather's porch. Maria stayed true to her word - a half case firmly in her clutch. \"Come in!\" Heather stood in front of her floor length mirror, holding up two different tops up, unsure of which to wear. \"The blue one!\" Maria called from where she was sprawled lazily on Heather's twin sized bed. \"No question.\" Melissa turned to face her friends, twirling on the vanity stool to eye Heather's choices. \"Your thoughts, Melissa?\" She asked. \"You don't think it's too hoe-y?\" \"Nah, girl,\" Melissa shook her head. \"Definitely the blue - you'll look hot as hell, who cares about looking a little slutty, anyway? We're in our prime!\" \"Finally something Mel and I can agree on!\" Maria chimed in. Heather chuckled, tossing the yellow halter top to the floor. She pulled her baseball tee over her head and put on the blue top, tipping her head down so she could tie it. Then turning around in the mirror to inspect herself. \"You look gooood !\" Maria stood up, shaking Heather by the shoulders and smiling wide. \"Now, can we go, losers? You two take forever.\" The two other girls rolled their eyes. \"Lead the way, Maria.\" Chavez's was all ready alive when they showed up. The music was blasting, luckily he had next to no neighbors, and people were stumbling across his lawn. \"Looks like a good time.\" Heather mused. She pushed open the door and was greeted by a fog of cigarette smoke and the stench of bodies and booze. \"You think Mike's gonna be here?\" Melissa whispered into Heather's ear, almost drowned out by the music. \"I wanna get with that.\" Heather shook her head. \"Mike don't even leave his house, you know his momma's sick, Mel.\" \"He might -\" Melissa never finished. Arms wrapped around Heather's waist and a head nuzzled into her neck. \"I knew you'd come. You lookin' for me, H?\" Without even glancing behind her, Heather unpried the hands around her and pushed the boy's body away. \"You hear of personal space?\" Heather smirked, turning to face Don, who was still too close. \"I ain't come here for you, Donnyboy. I came here to get drunk and have fun.\" \"I know how to have fun.\" \"I know you do,\" she wrapped an arm around his neck, leaning in closer. Her voice dropped a few decibels. \"But I ain't looking for that kind of fun. She took a step back. \"But I'm sure Maria -\" Don groaned. \" Maria ? Been there, H. I'm looking at you.\" \"Too bad.\" She left him and pushed her way through the crowd, attempting to find at least one of her bubbly blonde friends. \"Heather, my girl,\" Chavez wrapped her into a warm embrace. \"You came! Though, I did just see Melissa and remembering thinkin' you couldn't be far behind.\" \"You know I wouldn't miss one of your parties, love,\" she smiled, squeezing her friend before slipping out of the hug. \"I was right behind Melissa but then one of your buddy's got me tied up.\" \"Don?\" She sighed, giving him a nod. \"Yup. Guy thinks I'm gonna be his next conquest.\" \"'Guess he's dumber than he looks.\" Chavez quipped. \"You want a beer?\" \"Yes, please!\" Chavez leaned over the counter and grabbed her a beer, cracking it off the counter until the cap went flying. \"Thank you, sweetheart.\" She raised her beer in thanks and bid her goodbye, searching for Melissa - worried the girl might all ready be mixed up in some trouble. The blonde sat outside, her legs dipped in the cool water of the Chavez's pool. Heather took a seat next to her, dangling her legs into the water too. \"No luck in finding Mike?\" Melissa frowned. \"Nope. You were right - I don't think he's here.\" \"'Figured you'd be on to the next by now,\" Heather teased lightheartedly, leaning her head on her friend's shoulder. \"Something got you down?\" \"Nah, not really - just something about Mike, you know?\" Melissa shrugged, staring blankly into the aquamarine water. \"I think he's different . What about you, Don didn't manage to charm you into some dark closet somewhere?\" \"You think so low of me?\" Heather faked disbelief. \"I left him in the wind, girl. Not worth my time.\" \"Mhmm,\" Melissa hummed. \"At least one of us has their head on their shoulders. Looks like Don wasn't all that fazed, either.\" Heather glanced in the direction Melissa pointed; Don was stumbling out the backdoor, Karen held lazily under his right arm, as he sloppily tried to kiss her and walk . She quickly looked away, a frown tugging on her features. Maybe she didn't want to be his conquest, his one night stand. But she hadn't expected him to give up so easy. \"I'm offended,\" Heather forced out a chuckle. \"He hardly even tried to get in my pants - then he moves on with Karen? She's as ditzy as a blue-ass fly.\" \"Don't worry, baby,\" Melissa drunkenly patted Heather's hair. \"You're too good for him - he must know that, thats why he gave up.\" She watched as Don and Karen moved across Chavez's yard, until they disappeared behind the darkness of the garage. She rolled her eyes. \"Yeah, you're right.\"[Chapter 2] DO YOU GAMBLE? CHAPTER TWO ' Hey, baby. It's Gary. I didn't mean everything I said - Daisy, she means nothing to me. I made a mistake .' Heather breathed into the receiver. ' You there, darling? C'mon talk to me .' The line went dead as she hit end. She sucked in a breath, trying to hold back her burning tears. Gary, Midland's QB, had dumped her for a fiery red cheerleader for his team. Three weeks later he calls her telling her it was a mistake? It didn't add up, Gary had too much of an ego to realize how good he had it with Heather. She knew why he was calling. The redhead, Daisy, didn't put out. \"You alright, H?\" Melissa asked. She had slept over after Chavez's party and they had spent the day cuddled in a wool blanket watching TV movies. \"Who was on the phone?\" Heather wrapped herself back inside the blanket. \"It was Gary. 'Says he wants me back or something.\" Melissa's eyes widened. \"And what'd you say?\" \"Nothing,\" Heather's face heated up in embarrassment.\"I didn't know what to say! I hung up!\" \"You're terrible,\" Melissa laughed, shoving Heather lightly. \"You gonna call him back?\" \"Maybe, probably not,\" she sighed. \"You met Gary. You think he means a damn word he says?\" \"You're right. Probably not.\" \"It just sucks, I really liked him,\" she said quietly. \"Then he dumps me for some freshman cheerleader? Now he wants me back? I don't think so.\" \"You know what they say - plenty of fish in the sea,\" Melissa grinned. \"You wanna head down to the diner? Grab a bite and eat our feelings?\" \"Sounds perfect.\" Since it was the last Saturday of summer vacation, the diner was blocked with people. David was behind the counter, seeming flustered by the amount of orders coming in. Heather sat at one of the bar stools, giving the older man a bright smile. \"David, how are you tonight?\" The balding man looked up at the two girls, his frustration morphing into a smile for the most fleeting of moments. \"Melissa, Heather, I'm good. How are you girls tonight?\" \"Oh, just fine,\" Melissa replied cheerfully. \"I'm just taking Heather here out for a bite to eat, take her mind off things.\" \"Well, I gotta hand these bags off to Mike for his mom,\" David said, lifting up two plastic bags filled with food. \"then I can get your orders.\" Immediately, Melissa perked up. \"Oh, don't worry about that, Dave - me and H will bring it to him and you can grab us a couple burgers,\" she paused to scan the crowd. \"Where's he sitting?\" \"Outside, near the front,\" he handed the girl's a bag each. \"You tell him its on the house, too! Don't let him slip you any money.\" \"You got it, Dave.\" Heather saluted and slipped off her stool, following Melissa outdoors. \"Sly,\" Heather mused. \"You really got a thing for Mike, don't you?\" \" Shhh !\" Melissa hushed her as they walked into earshot of the boys. \"Hey, Mike,\" Melissa greeted the boy, cutting off whatever conversation the other boy's were having without any qualms. \"David asked us to bring out your momma's food.\" Melissa laid her bag and Heather's on the table. \"How much do I -\" \"Don't worry about it,\" Heather cut him off. \"'Said it was on the house.\" Heather's voice caught the attention of Don, who brought his styrofoam cup from his mouth to grin up at her. His breath reeked of alcohol. \"Well if ain't Odessa's brightest and finest .\" He asked her, shamelessly raking his eyes up and down her figure. Heather checked behind her. \"Oh, you're talking to me? I was looking for Karen.\" \"Is somebody feelin' jealous?\" Don lifted a brow. \"No need, darling. There's enough of me to go around.\" \"As if.\" Heather gagged, \"Now, move over, would you? Let me sit.\" Don moved down, pushing Chavez further down the bench to let her sit. She swung her legs over the side and sat down, stealing Don's cup in the process and downing the mixed drink. She winced at the strong taste but kept sipping. \"That was mine, you know,\" he smirked as he said it, never moving to steal back the drink. \"You coming to Taylor's tonight?\" \"Another party?\" She scrunched up her face. \"I don't know - I already went out last night.\" \"So what?\" Don rolled his shoulders in nonchalance. \"We're seventeen, baby! 'Might as well party while we can.\" \"Yeah,\" Melissa agreed, using her eyes to point to Mike, pleading with Heather silently. \"We should. You're the one that wanted to get your mind off things, right?\" Heather rolled her eyes, clearly outnumbered. \"Fine.\" Don stood under the funnel she grasped and she poured a beer bottle down the tube, laughing as he was unable to chug it back. He made a choking noise before spitting up into the sink. \"I thought you were a pro at this, Billingsley?\" She teased him, tossing the funnel onto the already messy counter. \"Pros finish the bottle without choking.\" \"Shut up, Heather,\" he groaned, his face flushed from lack of breathing. \"It's been awhile, all right? I'd like to see you try -\" \"Fine,\" she coyly raised a brow, grabbing back the funnel. \"Hit me, baby.\" He was surprised for a moment but his expression quickly turned to smug as he took the funnel from her. \"Let's see if you can put your money where your mouth is.\" She kneeled below him, taking the tube her in hand, and giving him a thumbs up when she was ready. He poured the beer in all at once, not giving her time to get used to the flow - but she expected that, he didn't want her to show him up, so she was ready to chug as soon as they copper liquid hit her throat. She managed to suck back the entire bottle with only a few drops of beer dripping down her face as evidence she had even done it at all. She stood up and wiped her face into the sleeve of her sweater, her turn to be smug. \"Told you I could do it. You think Odessa is crazy but you ain't ever been to a Midland party. Rich kids know no limits.\" \"I think I'm in love with you, H.\" Don grinned widely, brushing back the hair that was stuck to her face and more than likely doused in beer. She flicked her long brunette hair over her shoulder dramatically. \"Haven't you heard? Everybody is.\" \"Now, don't get cocky -\" \"That's my girl!\" Heather stiffened at the familiar voice. \"You've still got it!\" Gary, in all his muscled glory, had appeared at an Odessa party. Something that hadn't ever happened - not even when they were dating. She finally glanced at him, meekly and hesitantly. He was looking right past her, at Don, who's hands were still cupping her face. She knew Don was too bold to let some Midland guy frighten him so she stepped backward, letting Don's arms fall to their sides. \"Gary?\" She said confused. \"What are you doing in Odessa? Or rather, an Odessa house party ?\" \"You seemed mad earlier, on the phone,\" he shrugged. \"I thought it might be best to talk to you in person.\" \"Gary,\" her voice was just above a whisper. \"I don't think that's a good idea. People here aren't as welcoming as me to those from Midland.\" \"No, we ain't.\" Don stared Gary down. \"What're you and your goons doin' here?\" \"We don't want no trouble.\" Gary said but his face said the opposite. \"I just wanted to see my girl.\" \"Well, from what I hear she ain't your girl anymore,\" he draped an arm around her shoulder and surprisingly, Heather didn't shake it off. \"Heard you two broke up. And you were dating some slutty cheerleader.\" Gary narrowed his gaze in on Don. \"That's all in the past.\" From behind Don, gathered other Panthers, outnumbering the three Midland Rebels, each standing tall and staring intimidatingly. Heather felt uncomfortable stuck in the middle. Gary's gaze flickered between Heather and the strong boys behind her and shook his head. \"Alright, I get your message - get out. I'll talk to you later, Heather.\" Heather looked away, not meeting her ex boyfriend's eyes. Instead, she looked up at Don. \"You didn't have to do that.\" She said shyly. \"Did you want him here?\" Heather shook her head. \"Then I had to do it.\" ","Summary":" DO YOU GAMBLE?

Alex was tired as she walked out thenclinic. She had been up sick all night and because of this skippednthe football game. She walked slowly to her car as her mind began tonrace. Why had she done it?nShe knew it was wrong, she knew things could get this bad. Shenclimbed into her car and slowly drove home. The doctor said shenwould know by Friday at the latest, told her to just stop by and picknup the results. They made it sound so simple. The whole town wasnsilent, everyone still sleeping after the wild night. She went to hernbedroom and climbed into bed. She closed her eyes and cried herselfnto sleep. On Monday she knew whatnshe had to do but she didn't want too. I walked into the schoolnbuilding, the whole place was buzzing with excitement for the nextnfootball game. She rushed past everyone looking for Don Billingsley.nAlex was standing at her locker when she saw him. So typical she thought when she saw him leaned against the wall and some girlnsmiling at him. The girl was twisting her hair and laughing atneverything Don said. Alex slammed her locker shut angrily causing anfew students to look at her, Don looked up and saw her. She turned and begannwalking to her class, she didn't want to start the school year likenthis. It was her last year, she was getting a scholarship andnleaving. She would never give Odessa a second look. Just as she wasnabout to walk into her class she felt someone touch her shoulder. Shenturned and saw him. \"Hey, I've beennwanting to talk to you.\" Don said. \"Yeah I um…I neednto talk to you about something too.\" Alex said honestly. \"Aboutnthe summer, about what happened…\" She said slowly. \"I know things seem anlittle strange right now but I…I like you, really. I just want usnto hang out some more. I like talking to you.\" Don said honestly. \"Meet me outsidenafter school, I have to tell you something.\" Alex said seriously.nDon nodded, Alex walked into her class. \"Hey Billingsley, Insaw you talking to Alex.\" Brian Chavez said as they sat at theirnusual lunch table. \"What's your pointnChavo?\" Don asked. \"Why are you messingnwith that?\" He asked. \"Not even you could seal the deal with thatngirl, all she cares about it school. Its obvious.\" He said. \"What makes you thinknI already haven't?\" Don asked. \"I wouldn't saynthat kind of stuff, if her dad found something like that out he wouldnkill you.\" Mike Winchell said looking at him. \"He wouldn't evenncare about the whole town wanting to kill him for ruining the seasonneither. \"He wouldn't killnme.\" Don said unsure. \"What do you thinknhappened to that Aaron kid she was with last year?\" Chavo asked. \"He joined the army.\"nDon said matter-of-factly. \"You think he didnthat of his own free will?\" Mike asked. \"Whatever.\" Donnmuttered feeling worried suddenly. The rest of Alex'snschool day seemed like a long dragging haze. She wanted the day to benover but was too worried to concentrate on anything. Finally thensound of the last bell echoed and she felt relieved. She walked tonher locker and hurried to the back of the building where she knew Donnwould be waiting. She walked out and saw him leaning against thenbuilding. She walked over to him and he starred at her. \"Is your dad going tonkill me?\" Don asked suddenly. Alex was unsure if thenquestion was serious. \"Why would he kill you?\" \"The guys were sayingnthat he forced Aaron to join the army and I…well I don't want tonbe in the army. I don't want to die.\" Don said quickly. \"The guys?\" Hennodded. \"What did you tell them?\" Alex asked feeling sick. \"Nothing, they saw mentalking to you that's all.\" Don said which was mostly true. \"Ok, my dad won'tnkill you.\" Alex said. \"Unless I wanted him too.\" She added. Don nodded. \"What didnyou want to talk about?\" \"Well you know hownover the summer we were hanging out or whatever\" He nodded. \"WellnI know we were having just having fun which is fine but…\" Shentrailed off. \"What are you gettingnat?\" Don asked confused as to what she saying. \"When we…um, whennwe had sex did you use anything?\" She asked. \"What do you mean?\"nHe asked confused. She starred at him feeling embarrassed and notnwanting to explain further. \"You mean like…protection?\" Shennodded. \"Well yeah, why would you ask…\" His voice trialed offnas it seemed to make sense suddenly. \"Oh my God, your dad really isngoing to kill me.\" He said his stomach dropping. \"I don't know fornsure yet, I just wanted to tell you.\" Alex said. \"Oh my God, what arenwe going to do?\" He asked not expecting an answer. \"Did you go tonthe doctor or something?\" He asked looking at her. She nodded. \"Didnanyone see you? What if people start asking questions? My dad isngoing to kill me before yours can. The Coach is going to kill, I amngoing to be so dead.\" \"Don Billingsley!\"nAlex yelled breaking him out of his rant. He looked at her. \"Relax,nI thought about it a lot over the weekend.\" He nodded. \"No one isngoing to kill you. If I am…you know, then we don't have to keepnit.\" She said. He looked at her wideneyed, that wasn't what he was expecting to hear. \"What do younmean?\" He asked. \"Like kill it? I won't let that happen, that'snjust wrong.\" He yelled now. \"No, no.\" She said.n\"I meant like give it to someone else. Neither of us are ready fornsomething like this, I want to go to college. If we kept it we wouldnhave to get married or do something like that, I don't want that.\"nShe said. \"Okay,\" Don nodded.n\"When are you going to find out?\" He asked calmly. \"Friday.\" Shenanswered. \"I'll tell you after the game.\" She said. \"I havento go now, go home.\" She began to walk away. \"Wait, are you surenabout what you want to do?\" He said. Alex turned and looked at him.nShe nodded and left. After football practicenDon was more than stressed out, he was exhausted. All he wanted to donwas go home and collapse, to fall into such a deep sleep nothingnwould wake him but he knew that wouldn't happen. He began to putnhis clothes back on when Mike sat next him and began to tie hisnshoes. \"You okaynBillingsley?\" Mike asked lowly so no one heard. \"Yeah I am fine.\"nDon lied. \"You seemed a littlenspaced during practice.\" Mike said looking him in the eye now. \"Don't worry aboutnme, I'm a big boy I can take care of myself.\" Don said standing.nThe rest of the team began to walk out as Don grabbed his bag. \"All I am saying isnif you need someone to talk to, I am here.\" Mike said standing asnDon walked to the door. \"Okay, I got it.\"nDon said now annoyed. Mike thought quicklynabout what he was about to say and knew he needed a way to reach Don.nIt was clear Don needed someone to talk to but didn't want anyonento know. \"I know what happened Donnie.\" Mike said. Don stopped walked andnturned to him. \"First don't call me that, second what are yountalking about?\" He asked worried. \"I am talking aboutnAlex. I always go out the back way, its quicker. I heard you bothntalking.\" Mike said honestly. \"I know what's going on.\" \"You don't knownanything, you don't know shit Mike.\" Don said throwing his stuffnto the floor. \"You…you just don't.\" He yelled before fallingnto the floor. Mike rushed to hisnside. \"Are you okay?\" He asked trying to help him up. \"I don't know whatnto do.\" Don said and began to cry. Mike hugged Don, whichnwas something rarely done. \"Don't worry.\" He said softly. Mikenlet go and Don looked at him, looking lost. \"Come on, lets go getnsomething to eat and then we can talk about all of this.\" Mikenoffered. Don nodded slowly and they walked out.[Chapter 2] Alex avoided Don forrnthe rest of the week. She thought about everything the best sherncould. If she was pregnant she would have the baby, no matter what.rnShe didn't know if she wanted to keep it though. She knew Donrnwasn't ready to be a father, there was no way he would want it. Shernknew that already. And besides what would make her think Don would berna good father, his father was a drunk and abusive. She knew not tornassume but most children ended up like their parents. She couldn'trnraise a child with someone like that. Don spent his weekrntrying to get in contact with Alex, he wanted to talk to her. Hernreally did like her and care about her. He always had and he wantedrnto talk about the possible baby. Mike and Don had talkedrnabout it and that helped. Don knew he wouldn't be the best fatherrnand he knew he wasn't ready but if Alex was pregnant it was his kidrnand he wanted to be there him or her. Don didn't want some strangerrnraising something that he made. He wanted Alex to know but she seemedrnto have disappeared. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Friday was finally herernand the whole town was buzzing again. After Boobie's accident nornone knew if they would win or not. As the sun began to set thernstadium began to fill and the town became deserted. Don had skippedrnpractice and was waiting outside Alex's house to go with her to therndoctor. She stepped outside the door and saw him. She lookedrnsurprised. \"What are you doingrnhere?\" She asked walking next to him. \"I wanted to go withrnyou…to the-\" \"Don't worry aboutrnit, I can go alone.\" Alex interrupted and began walking. \"I know but I alsornwanted to talk to you.\" Don said following her. \"About what?\" Alexrnasked confused. \"About this wholernthing, about everything.\" She nodded. \"I talked to Mike and-\" \"You told someone?\"rnAlex asked angrily. \"No he already knew,rnhe heard us. That's not the point, I talked to him and I wasrnthinking about everything and I decided I don't think giving thisrnbaby to someone else is a good idea.\" Don said. Alex stopped walking.rn\"What?\" \"If you are pregnantrnI think it would be best if we…you know…kept it.\" He said. Alex started walkingrnfaster than before. \"No, no that's not going to work.\" She spedrnup again. \"I have a future, I am leaving here. You have football,rnwhere does raising a child fit in? Nowhere, that's where.\" Alexrnslowed down. \"I know you only want to do the right thing but letsrnface it Donnie, children turn into their parents.\" Don stopped walked, hernfelt like Alex had just slapped him. \"What are you trying to say?\"rnHe asked but already knew. \"You always drink andrnsleep around now, how am I supposed to know that its going to stop.\"rnAlex said looking at him. \"Because you'rernsupposed to trust me.\" He said feeling completely rejected. \"I'm sorry I can't.rnIf I am even pregnant I want to give it to someone that truly wantsrnit.\" Alex said. \"I don't want a kid right now.\" She saidrnbluntly. \"I won't let you.\"rnDon said feeling surprised by his own statement. \"You need to havernpermission from both parents to give a kid up, I won't let you givernmy kid away.\" He said. \"Its never going to happen.\" He said inrna threatening tone. \"I have to go now, orrnI am going to be late.\" Alex said feeling uncomfortable. \"You gornand play football and I will talk to you after the game.\" Alexrnwalked away. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- Alex walked into therndoctor's office and told them her name. She then sat down andrnwaited for them to call her. Once they did she walked into the littlernroom. \"Hey Alex, good tornsee you.\" Dr. Bolton said smiling. \"Nice to see yourntoo.\" Alex said forcing a smile. \"Well now, last timernyou came in for a pregnancy test and we have the results now.\" Dr.rnBolton said flipping through pages. \"Most girls bring someone withrnthem for this part.\" He said looking at her. \"Like perhaps thernfather.\" He said. \"Well he wanted torncome but, he plays football, Permian Panthers actually.\" Alex said. Dr. Bolton noddedrnseeming impressed. \"Always the football team.\" He smiled. \"Wellrnhere we go.\" He said finally finding the page with her results.rn\"Uh, it looks to be positive.\" He said. Alex felt her stomachrndrop and her world crash. \"Oh okay.\" She said barely above arnwhisper. \"Well we have manyrnways to do deal with this, there is abortion and adoption.\" Dr.rnBolton said quickly when he noticed Alex's face. \"Or you couldrnkeep it, its all up to you and the father.\" He said. \"What if I wantedrnadoption and he didn't?\" Alex asked. \"Well that wouldrncause a problem, for a baby to be adopted there needs to bernpermission from both parents and they have to legally sign all theirrnrights away.\" He said. \"If a father refused then…then therernwouldn't be any adopting.\" He said frankly. \"Ok, um…what aboutrnabortions?\" Alex asked the words hurting herself already. \"Well for that yournneed to make an appointment, we would need you to know for surernthat's exactly what you want.\" He said. \"Why don't you justrnmake an appointment for next week and then we can figure out what torndo. Go and talk to the father about it too.\" He said standing. \"Thank you.\" Alexrnsaid as he walked out the door and she followed. ----------------------------------------------------------------- The panthers lost theirrngame and no one was in a good mood. Don was anxious though because hernknew Alex would be waiting for him, to talk to him about the doctor.rnHe needed to know what was going to happen with the rest of his life. The locker room wasrnempty except for Don and Mike. Mike was taking his time because hernwas hoping once he left so did the mob of angry fans. Don was takingrnhis time because he was worried about what happened once he saw Alex.rnDepending on what she said would change his life forever. Don was finally donernand began to walk for the door. \"Hey Billingsley.\"rnMike called and Don turned. \"Good luck.\" He said. \"Thanks.\" Don saidrnbefore walking out. Alex was leaningrnagainst the gate outside the stadium, she was hoping Don would neverrncome out. She thought about everything and she knew what she had torndo. She wouldn't let this ruin her life, or his. \"Hey Alex.\" Donrnsaid. \"Hey.\" Alex saidrnfacing him, her stomach began to turn and she felt sick. \"So did you go?\"rnDon asked already knowing she did. Alex just nodded. \"What did theyrnsay?\" Don asked. \"Um…there…there'srnnothing to worry about.\" Alex said slowly. \"What do you mean?\"rnDon asked confused. \"It was a falsernalarm.\" Alex lied. \"Just me freaking out about little things.\" \"So you're not…\" \"No, all this forrnnothing.\" She said forcing a smile. \"I'll um, see you MondayrnDon.\" She walking away quickly before she changed her mind. Don began to walk tornhis car when he heard Mike. \"What did she say?\"rnMike asked. \"She said it was arnfalse alarm.\" Don said. \"That's goodrnright?\" Mike asked confused by Don's disappointed face. \"She lied.\" Donrnsaid getting into his car. \"She lied because she doesn't wantrnit.\" He said. \"Are you sure aboutrnthat?\" Mike said bending over and looking into the car. \"Yeah.\" Don said.rn\"Well tonight, sucked.

It was no different for Lily Winchell and her family, her twin brother, Mike, played football for the Permian Panthers, and she was a water-girl and trainer for the team. Now it was time for their senior year, their last year to bring home a state title. This is her story. Every morning at breakfast Lily and her mother would help Mike memorize plays. They would test him repeatedly. This had become a ritual every football season for as long as Lily could remember. This morning, her mother was testing Mike while Lily was getting ready for cheerleading. Although Mike and Lily were twins, they were fraternal so they didn't look very much alike, Lily had the same dark hair as Mike, but had bright blue eyes, her lips were fuller, and then of course was the matter of them being different genders. Lily would always go to practices with Mike, even if it wasn't required of her. Today they made their way to Ratliff stadium. Lily grinned as she saw Boobie, Don, Brian, and everyone else \"Hey boys\" she greeted them, putting her dark hair into a pony tail \"Ready to get down to business?\" They all just kind of looked at her and grinned as they made their way into Ratliff Stadium. As the boys were in the locker room getting ready for practice, Lily took a spot on the bench, waiting for something to do. Seeing all of the scouts out watching the players while she was sitting there made her nervous for all of the boys, especially her brother. She knew how much he desperately wanted to get out of Odessa. Then there was her best friend Don, she knew that he needed to get away, away from the town, and away from his father. Her stomach tightened as she saw Don mess up a play and Charlie make is way down from the stands. She knew what was going to happen, and she knew it wouldn't be pretty. It started out innocent enough, with Flippy following Charlie. Thank God for Flippy, nobody else would put up with Charlie and his bullshit, she thought. Then she saw Charlie grab him and throw him to the ground. He was yelling and hitting him. Somebody stop him she pleaded to Brian with her eyes and he moved in between Don and Charlie. Finally, it broke up and Flippy took Charlie back to the stands. The boys went into a huddle, and Lily went back to taping one freshman's wrist. She had returned to her spot on the sideline when she saw Don and Boobie start going at it. Boobie has such a big mouth, poor Donnie, it's not like he doesn't get enough of it at home. After all of that drama was over, a reporter came over to interview her. \"You're Mike Winchell's twin?\" he asked, \"Yes, I am.\" \"And do you think the boys are going to win state this year?\" \"I think it's going to take a whole lot of hard work, but I think they'll do it, I know they'll do it. Now if you'll excuse me, I kind of have to get back to practice.\" \"Who's that hot chick the news people are talking to?\" asked Zach, a Senior who had just transferred from out of state. Mike and Donnie looked to the side of the field and saw he was talking about Lily, then turned and faced the boy. \"She is off limits,\" said Mike. \"Why? She your girlfriend or something?\" Zack asked, taking on a cocky tone. \"She's my twin sister,\" Mike said threateningly. \"Don't you touch her,\" Donnie said, \"It's not just us you'll have to answer to… it's the whole team.\" Zach paled a little, but recovered his swagger, \"Chill out, I won't touch her.\" She never really understood why they wanted to interview her. When practice was over Coach Gaines gave a speech. Lily stood close enough so that she could hear what he was saying. She loved Coach Gaines for his somewhat quiet leadership; she loved to listen to his speeches. One thing from this one rang in her head \"Can you be perfect?\" After practice was over, Mike took himself and Lily home to shower off and change in order to go to get some burgers with some of the boys, and to pick up some food for their mother. Lily left her hair down, falling in loose curls and put on a denim skirt and a simple button up with some cowboy boots. When Mike called for her, she grabbed her purse and got in the car. The place was busy, as usual. After they had been sitting there, she saw Don pour something into his cup and she knew that it was more than just Coke. Don started to take Mike's cup and do the same \"Naw, I'm alright\" \"Come on man, live a little. What about you Lily, you want some?\" Lily was about to answer when she saw Mike glare at her \"No, I'd better not Donnie.\" Then she heard Brian \"He's not going out tonight either.\" But Donnie said \"Yeah he is. Mike you're going out tonight and if I have anything to say about it you're gonna get laid too.\" \"Oh God, can we please not talk about this in front of me, I don't want to know about his… habits. Gross.\" said Lily with a look of disgust. \"Sorry Lil\" said Donnie \"But you're going out with us tonight too.\" Lily was about to come back with some sarcastic remark when she heard the screeching of tires. \"Billingsley, Billingsley, party at Taylor's house now Billingsley. You'd better be there! Get wasted! Party at Taylor's house! Billingsley!\" Lily couldn't help but snicker under her breath, but when Brian said, \"Isn't that guy like thirty-five?\" it turned into a full-blown giggle. Then the owner of Buddy's came out with some food for her mother and Lily laughed as Don argued about how he never got free food, even though their meal that night was free. \"You're not going home Mike\" said Don. \"We ain't going out drunk foolin\" he replied. \"How about I bring your mom some dinner so you can come out with us because we're going to get laid, gonna get drunk, and we're gonna win state, but not tonight.\" With that, Don got up from the table. \"We've been blessed Mike, we've got a runner and he's gonna make us all look good. All you gotta do is exist in the few seconds between the snap and getting Boobie the ball. So lighten up a little.\" said Brian. Lily knew that after hearing that, Mike would probably go to the party. She nudged Brian and mouthed \"Thank You\" and he gave her a wink. Then someone came up to the table. Lily knew she had seen him before, but couldn't think of his name. He started talking to Mike and shot a \"Hi Lily\" her way. Lily had to try not to laugh when she saw her brother awkwardly holding a baby, and then the look on his face when he told him to look after the baby for a while. When Mike turned to Christian \"You wanna go to that party, just for a little bit\", she knew that they were going, then when she saw Christian shoot a small smile. \"Yes!\" she cheered jumping in the air slightly. The party was really crowded, tons of people packed into the house. It smelled of cigarettes and booze. At first, Lily was standing with her brother and Christian, but then she saw Melissa approaching and walked away to get a drink before she said something that would get her into trouble. First, she saw Brian making out with some girl, and watched as Donnie funneled a beer. \"Let me try?\" she asked Don with a sweet smile. \"Anything for you Lil\" came his reply. She placed the hose between her lips and closed her eyes as they poured the beer into the funnel, she knew that she had to stand still and drink it all so it wouldn't go in her hair or on her clothes. Don was surprised when he saw her funnel it like a champ. \"Damn Lily, you never told me you could do that!\" She smiled \"And don't you dare tell Mike\" with that she walked away, grabbing a cup of beer on the way out. She was on her way to find her brother or Christian when she was intercepted by a new guy from the football team, the same one that Donnie and Mike had warned not to touch her. \"Hey,\" he said, \"You're Mike's sister right?\" Lily sighed, she hated to be known as \"Mike's sister\" or \"Mike's twin\". \"Yeah, that's me,\" she said finally, \"And you are?\" \"I'm Joe, I just moved here from New Jersey,\" he said. \"Oh, well it's nice to meet you… but I've got to go find my brother,\" she said. \"Wait,\" he said, grabbing her hand lightly as she tried to walk away, \"Would it hurt you to get a Jello shot or two with me. I thought you Southern girls were supposed to be all about hospitality and all that.\" Lily carefully weighed her options. She could go get those shots with Joe, who she barely knew… but who probably also barely knew about her family, which was something that was hard to come by in Odessa. Or she could choose to not go, and… well she didn't know what would happen, but choosing to go seemed like a pretty good option. \"Fine,\" she said with a smile, \"I'd hate to give the rest of us Southern ladies a bad name.\" After doing the Jello shots, somehow Joe convinced her to go out on the back porch and talk. \"So do you have a boyfriend?\" he asked. \"You sure don't waste any time do you?\" she questioned sarcastically, \"But no, I don't. My brother has made sure that all of the football players know not to touch me, and the football players have made sure that all of the other guys know not to touch me.\" \"Well they haven't made sure that I know,\" he said, leaning towards her. She put her finger up, stopping her lips from meeting hers. \"I don't think so Joe,\" she said. They continued to talk, Joe only talking about himself and how he was a \"legend\" at his other school. \"And this one time I…\" but Lily had stopped listening, she was just smiling and nodding and was utterly bored. \"Well, it was good meeting and talking to you, but I've got to go find Mike, I'll see you around,\" she said, adding that last part, but hoping it wouldn't be true. \"Alright, well are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?\" he asked. \"My brother always drives me home,\" she said, \"I've really got to go.\" He leaned in and kissed her softly on the lips, \"I'll see you then.\" She tried to hide her disgust, \"Yeah, later,\" she said, and walked off. After she found her way back to her brother, they decided to leave. Mike decided to go over to Christian's for a while, so he took Lily home and rode with Christian to his house. When Lily got home, she thanked God that her mother was asleep and she got into the shower and got ready for bed. She was almost asleep when she heard a soft knock on her window. She looked outside and saw Don without a shirt and with duct tape stuck to his hands; she walked over to her window and opened it, letting him in quietly. \"Mom's asleep, and Mike won't be here 'til later. Stay in here, I'll get the first aid kit.\" Don was seated on her bed when she returned, \"What happened?\" she asked as she gingerly started peeling off the tape. \"I was hooking up with Maria and knocked over a lamp, he came out and started yelling at me, so I yelled back and he taped a football to my arms and started trying to beat it out of the tape. Maria left and Flippy got him to go back to bed, and…\" Not knowing what else to do, Lily wrapped her best friend into a hug and whispered, \"I'm sorry Donnie, you shouldn't have to deal with all of that. Come here whenever you need to, my window is always open.\" She let go with a soft smile \"Now let's try to get you fixed up, you're staying here tonight, so don't argue.\" When she finished she handed him a towel, now go get that party smell off of you, I'll give you some of Mike's clothes to sleep in; she went into Mike's room and returned with some boxers a t-shirt and shorts for Don. \"Thanks Lil\" he said, giving her a hug, \"You're the best.\" \"Just remember this when I need a favor from you, and we'll be even. Deal?\" She stuck out her hand. \"Deal\" he said as he shook it. When Don had gotten out of the shower and changed into all but the shirt, he walked back into Lily's room and saw that she had pulled her day bed out so that he would have a place to sleep, and that she was already sleeping lightly on the pull-out bed. \"Goodnight Lil\" \"Night Donnie, sweet dreams\" she yawned, as she rolled over and went to sleep. \"Yeah, sweet dreams,\" mumbled Don as he fell asleep breathing in the scent of Lily's shampoo off her pillow. The next morning Don woke up first, he rolled over to look at the other bed to see if Lily was up. He knew immediately by the rhythmic sound of her breathing that she was still sleeping and not just laying there with her eyes closed. He noticed how her lips made a perfect bow, like a doll he had seen in Wal-Mart, how her hair was slightly messy, but still pretty and shiny, and most of all how she looked gorgeous without any makeup at all, which was more than he could say about any of the girls he had hooked up with. He thought back to when they were kids, Lily was a tomboy, and always played football with the boys. She was the first to talk to him when his mother sent him to live with his dad. He remembered how her mother would make her do pageants before she got so sick, and how Lily would complain about having to put on a dress. Then he remembered when he, Brian, Mike, and some of the other boys lost a bet and had to go to one of the pageants to watch her. It was that day that he realized how beautiful Lily Winchell was, she blew all of the other girls out of the water. He never really understood why he had never made a move on Lily, maybe he was afraid she would slap him, or maybe it was the rejection, maybe because they were so close as friends, but maybe it was because of Mike, she was off limits because she was Mike's sister. He let out a small sigh as he looked at her and noticed she had a piece of hair in her face; he gingerly reached out his hand and brushed it away, trying desperately not to wake her. It was then that she finally stirred a little. He brought his hand back and debated whether or not to pretend to be asleep. Why am I acting like such a loser? It's just Lily. However, in his heart he knew that it was not \"just Lily\" that Lily was something special to him. He closed his eyes, pretending to be asleep just before Lily opened hers. When Lily woke, she turned her head to the side and assumed that Don was sleeping. She looked at him, watching him; it was then she realized from his breathing that he was awake. \"Morning Donnie, I know you're not sleeping,\" she said in her morning voice. He grinned then opened his eyes, \"You caught me.\" \"You stay here, I'm going to go see if Mike ever came home, and if Mom is still asleep, then we'll come up with a game plan. Ok?\" \"Ok Lil.\" He watched as she got up, noticing for the first time how short her shorts were and how her top came down just enough to show a little of the skin between it and her shorts. He saw her stand on her toes as she walked out the door and across the hall to Mike's room. She knocked on the door and opened it slightly, peeking in; Mike wasn't there. Then she tip toed down the hall to her mother's room and opened the door slightly; she saw her sleeping soundly. Don heard her coming back to her room, sneaking in the door and closing it lightly behind her \"He never came home, and she's still sleeping. So, I can take you home if you want, or you can have breakfast here, and when Mom wakes up, I'll do the talking.\" \"Whatever you want to do is fine Lil, you know I'll eat anything you cook, but if you don't want to get in trouble with your mom, or Mike, you can take me home.\" She bit her lip, a habit for when she thinks, \"Breakfast it is then, I can handle Mom and Mike, no problem. However, for this to work, you need to put your jeans on, I washed them, and they're in the dryer. And you should probably put on a shirt too.\" She walked out of the room and returned with his jeans and a t-shirt. \"Here, get dressed\" she said gathering some clothes for herself for the day, \"Stay in here until I come back.\" He sat on the bed before deciding to put it back to how it belonged. Making the pull out bed, and then pushing it under before starting to get dressed. He had just put his jeans on as he heard the door creak open \"Oh uh, sorry.\" \"Lil, it's not like I'm naked, you've seen me in my boxers like a billion times.\" She walked into the room and smiled \"Yeah, I guess you're right. You made up my bed and fixed it back. Thanks, Donnie!\" He slipped the shirt over his head after pulling up his pants and buttoning them, \"No problem\" pulling her into a hug. The next day was the final team workout before school started. Coach Gaines said Lily didn't have to be there, but she knew that the cheerleaders would be making the signs so she decided to help. While painting, the girls were talking about the team \"So Lil, we know that you know all of the boys the best, who would you date out of all of them?\" asked Madison. \"Maddie, I am so not answering that.\" Then another girl piped in, \"That means she has a crush on someone, I know she does! Is it Chavez? It's him isn't it?\" Lily just rolled her eyes \"I don't see the point in this conversation.\" Then Jenny said, \"I bet it's Don, have you seen the way they are together. Besides, I think they'd make the cutest couple.\" All of the other girls nodded in agreement. \"Whatever, you guys are too much. I'm going to go hang some of these signs up.\" \"Yeah, go see your lover boy.\" all of the girls said. She took the signs for the senior boys and made her way to the locker room. One sign she hung above some of the lockers, and then she made her way to the weight room, where she knew the boys would be lifting. \"Hey guys\" she said walking in. \"Hey Lil\" they all said. \"I've got the senior sign. I did it myself.\" She held it up. She climbed up on a nearby table and stood on her toes to hang the sign up high. The boys watched her, knowing that she was clumsy as everything. Then Mike said \"Lil, are you sure you want to be standing on the table like that, I mean, we could have just stood on a chair and hung it up for you. You're gonna fall.\" \"Shut up Mike, if I would have gotten you to hang it up, I would have had to go back to the girls sooner, and I really don't want to do that. They're getting on my nerves.\" Then she mimicked the girls \"Lil if you had to pick anyone on the team to date who would it be? Blah blah blah. I swear you guys, that's all they want to know.\" she said struggling to get the sign even. Then she backed up a little, misjudging the width of the table and stepped off it. Thank God Don was nearby; he caught her bridal style and held her for probably a second too long. \"Uh thanks Donnie\" he set her down. Then Boobie started \"Well I think I know who it is.\" Lily rolled her eyes and he continued, \"It's me of course, I mean who wouldn't want to date me. I'm the star player.\" She pursed her lips and sighed, \"Well sorry to burst your bubble, but it's not you. And you guys are just as bad as those girls.\" With that, she left. \"Great, just great you guys\" said Mike \"You pissed her off and now I have to take her home and listen to it.\" When weight training was done, Lily was waiting for Mike outside the locker room pouting somewhat. The first day of school came much too quickly for Lily. There was the annual first day pep rally, where they kicked off the football season. Lily loved the games and pep rallies and everything, but hated the school day before them. The anticipation building up made her slightly nervous. She walked in the school with Don and Mike; they were on the way to their lockers when Karen, a girl in the color guard, stopped them. \"Hi Don\" \"Hey Karen\" \"It's you do you like it, do you like it?\" \"I think so, what is it?\" \"Rice Krispy, you like it right?\" \"Yeah I love it, thanks Karen.\" \"You're welcome\" when she left Lily burst into a fit of laughter. \"Oh God, she might as well have said Oh Donnie, I sure love you\" as she said it she rubbed her body against his and Don felt his stomach tighten. Mike smiled and let out a small chuckle at his sister's antics, and Don let out some uncomfortable laughter \"Yeah pretty lame huh.\" With that, they made their way to their lockers, which were right next to each other. While there, Joe came up to Lily and put his arm around her waist. Lily gave Don a 'Help Me' look before turning to the boy \"Hi Joe.\" \"Hey Lily, why don't you come with me after the game, I'll show you a good time, I promise.\" Lily wracked her brain for an excuse when Don stepped in, grabbing her hand, \"She would, but we have plans. Right babe?\" \"Right Donnie\" and for extra emphasis, she stood on her toes and kissed his cheek. \"I'll see you around Joe,\" said Donnie with a smirk. When Joe had walked away, she spoke \"Thanks Donnie, I owe ya one.\" He winked at her \"Now we're even.\" The rest of the school day went without a hitch. That night, when Lily got home from painting the run through sign for the opening game, there were some scouts in the living room. Lily just went to her room quietly and stayed in there, knowing that it would make Mike nervous for everyone to be in the small living room. However, that didn't stop her from listening in on the conversation. She was so proud of her brother when they said they were interested. She knew she would be getting out of Odessa, and now her brother may be getting out too. Then came the first game. Lily could feel the excitement in the air. It was against Marshall. The boys were doing great all throughout the game. She made sure to keep an eye on \"her\" senior boys. Then she saw Brian making some major tackles and Don going crazy on the sidelines. Then she saw Chris Comer try to run in without a helmet. \"What the hell is he doing?\" she said to nobody in particular. Then Coach Gaines put Boobie back in and he was hit… hard. She could hear him wailing in pain from her spot on the sidelines. She knew it was bad, really bad. At the end of the game, she snuck over to the boys locker room and cracked open the door to listen. \"Alright everybody listen up. He's going to be fine. It's not serious, there's no tear. He'll be back in a week. That's the good news. Even better news, y'all played a great football game tonight, a real good football game.\" after hearing Coach Gaines say that, she shut the door quietly and waited outside the door. Mike was first out, she greeted him with a hug \"Great job, great job.\" Then Brian, she hugged him as well \"Way to go, I saw those hard hits out there.\" Last was Don, she hugged him before continuing \"Great job out there, I heard you cheering louder than the cheerleaders. Maybe you should take up cheerleading for basketball season.\" She smiled at him jokingly and he ruffled her hair, \"You're crazy, you know that?\" \"Yeah, but you love it.\" The next day at practice, Lily was watching the team to see how they were coping with the loss of their star player. Everything seemed to be going ok, and reporters were there drilling Coach Gaines with question after question. Lily just hoped that the reporters would leave her alone today. That day at practice, she just massaged the tired muscles of some of the newer players. The next game was against Abilene. Right off the bat, the Panthers were making bad decisions. It seemed like with the loss of Boobie came the loss of hope for the team. She knew how much this season meant to Coach Gaines, the seniors, and everyone else in Odessa for that matter. But she knew if they played like they did tonight against Midland-Lee, there would be no hope for going to state. The Panthers suffered a crushing loss with a score of 49 to 6. As much as Lily was upset that they lost, she was worried about what Charlie was going to do to Don. Charlie never took losses well, and this was a big one. She waited by the locker room for the boys to come out. Mike was first, she hugged him, whispering soothingly \"It'll be ok, don't worry about it. Go wait in the car; I'm going to wait for Donnie.\" Brian was next, she followed the same routine, hugging him and whispering, \"It's ok, you'll win the next one. Don't worry about it.\" \"I'm going to go wait in the parking lot for Don.\" he said as he walked pulled away and started walking. When Don finally came out of the locker room she grabbed him and squeezed him tightly, tighter than the other boys, and whispered \"Don't worry about it Donnie, I still think you're one of the best out there. Y'all just had an off day, that's all. Just remember if things get too heated with your dad my window is unlocked, ok?\" She pulled away, taking his hand \"Come on, let's go.\" When they got to the parking lot, they went their separate ways. Don saw his father on the hood of the car and turned back for a second, looking at Lily, before turning back to his father. Lily got in the car with Mike, knowing that she couldn't watch if Charlie was going to hit Don then and there. \"Mike, I'm worried about Don… Charlie is going to be so hard on him tonight.\" That night, Don didn't come over. AN: So there's the first chapter. I don't entirely know where I'm going with this, but I think that I like it so far. This is only my fourth submission to this site, so any and all feedback is welcome. I'll try to update as soon as I can! Thanks for reading![Chapter 2] Chapter Two The next day Mike and Lily met Don and Brian in a field for target practice. Lily was sitting in the back of the truck with Brian. \"We're dead\" she heard Mike say. \"We're not dead, we just need to start throwing the ball.\" said Brian. She heard Don mumble something then her brother \"Dead.\" \"You guys need to lighten up a little,\" she said. \"Yeah\" said Brian \"Lighten up, we're 17.\" \"Do you feel 17?\" asked Don. \"I don't feel 17.\" said Mike. \"We will win state.\" Then they started talking about getting out of Odessa, a permanent topic of conversation for the boys. The next day she was once again at practice with the football players. The reporters were there again. This time they interviewed Mike again. That day, Mike said he had to do something after practice and asked Don if he could take Lily home- without running it by Lily. She saw Mike get in the car and leave after practice was over. \"Don, what is Mike doing? He just left without me.\" \"He didn't tell you? I'm taking you home today. He said he had to do something and needed me to take you home.\" \"Oh, ok well that's fine, I'm ready when you are I guess.\" The ride to her house was comfortably silent and when they got back, she thanked Don for the ride. \"Guess you're one up on me now.\" He smiled at her, \"Oh don't worry, I'll need a favor sooner or later.\" That night, Coach Gaines came over to her house to talk to Mike. She just stayed in her room; she knew it was probably serious, so she didn't spy on them like she normally would have. The next game was against Cooper. In the middle of the second quarter, Cooper was ahead 14-0. Wilson went down, injured forcing Chris Comer to go in. Oh God. However, Comer was just what they needed; he scored the first touchdown. Don even scored one. \"Yeah Donnie!\" she screamed loud enough so she was sure he could hear her. He looked back and pointed to her, putting up two fingers. She had no clue what he was trying to say, but figured she would find out after the game. She waited outside the locker room like always, and the boys came out in the same order as always. Mike was first, she grabbed him in a hug \"You did it; I told you everything would be ok! I told you!\" Then Brian, \"You were great out there, fantastic!\" Finally, Don, he picked her up and spun her around \"Donnie I'm so proud of you and that touchdown too. I told you everything would be ok.\" He set her down \"That one was for you Lil, now you owe me two.\" The next days were filled with people treating the team like celebrities, and the team rolled over the competition in the next games. But the Midland-Lee game was coming up, and Lily was a little worried that Chris's inexperience could hurt the team. Homecoming was also weighing heavy on everyone's minds. It was their senior homecoming, Lily had been on court every year, and everyone knew it was between her and Karen for the spot of Homecoming Queen. When they marched on the field, Lily had Mike as her escort, and Karen had her father. Lily knew, just as everyone else did, that Karen had spend at least $500 on her dress, hair, and makeup. Her dress was the latest style and was covered in sequins, it was a bright silver color. Lily however, found her dress at a vintage store. It reminded her of Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's, one of her favorite movies, it was simple and black. Nothing too fancy, just like Lily. The truth was, Lily idolized Audrey Hepburn for her effortless beauty, not just that though, knowing what Audrey had come from gave Lily hope for her own future. To Lily, it seemed like Mike was squeezing onto her more than she was squeezing onto him. When they finally got through announcing everyone's names, it was time to announce the queen. Since Lily was in the running for queen, Coach Gaines allowed the seniors to sit on the sidelines and watch the crowning before going back to the locker room for a pep talk. Then came the moment, the crowd fell silent as the announcer called out \"And your 1988 Homecoming Queen is… LILY WINCHELL!\" Donnie and Chavez were watching from the sidelines as Karen's face melted into a scowl. \"Look at Karen,\" Donnie said. \"I know,\" said Chavez, \"If looks could kill…\" Karen's scowl was quickly replaced with a smile, a forced smile, but a smile nonetheless. Mike grabbed Lily in a hug \"Congrats, I knew you'd win, I knew it.\" Seeing his sister's big grin, he smiled too. \"Why Mike Winchell, is that a smile?\" she grinned The queen from the previous year placed a tiara on her head and handed a bouquet of red roses. Lily smiled and waved to the crowd before waving to the team before they went into the locker room. At the end of this game, waiting by the locker room, not only was she congratulating the boys for their playing, but they were congratulating her as well. Mike came out of the locker room first and engulfed her in a huge hug, lifting her off the ground, \"Look at you Miss Homecoming Queen, does the tiara and sash remind you of your old pageant days?\" She looked at him and grinned, \"Mike I mean this in the best way, bite me,\" she said sticking out her tongue. \"Oh and great job out there.\" Then came Chavez. He hugged her in the same way Mike did. \"Look at you gorgeous! We had a bet going that if Karen won, one of us would take her out so that you could be the winner.\" She laughed, \"Thanks, great job out there by the way.\" They hugged once more before he headed out towards his car. Don came out of the locker room and squeezed her so hard he nearly squeezed the life out of her. \"Donnie… I can't breathe,\" she said only half joking. \"Oh right, sorry. It's just that I'm so proud of you. You're the most beautiful Homecoming Queen in Texas,\" he said grinning. She gave a mocking sigh, \"Only Texas?\" \"Let me think about that,\" he said circling her, \"Nope, definitely the whole world.\" \"Well you, Donnie are probably the best football player in the whole world who is not my brother,\" she said smiling. \"Now how about you walk the queen to her chariot,\" she joked. \"Gladly,\" he said smiling. The Midland-Lee game was the biggest game in the regular season. The stands were filled, just like they were ever Friday, but it was different, the atmosphere was electric. Even the cheerleaders were pulling out all the stops, the biggest stunts, the best tumbling, everything. The whole town knew what would happen should the Panthers win, they would go to state. Everyone also knew what would happen should they lose, their place at state would be decided by a coin toss, it would be up to fate. Lily was on pins and needles, her stomach was in knots, and she felt like she was going to pass out, puke, or both. When Billingsley face masked someone on the other team, she knew something was up. Coach Gaines knew she was the only person who could talk him down when he was upset so he looked at her and motioned for her to come over. She sat on the bench next to him. \"Hey, what's wrong? I know you're worried about state and your dad and everything, but getting thrown out of the game is not going to solve anything.\" Donnie wouldn't look at her. She grabbed his hand and continued to talk to him soothingly. \"Donnie, don't worry about what everyone is going to say, if you give it all you've got and leave it all out on the field then you'll know in your heart that there was nothing else you could have done. You're angry, I understand that, but you need to use that anger to kick some ass out there, not to start a fight and be thrown out. Use it to win Donnie. If you give it everything you've got then you are perfect, that perfect that Coach Gaines always talks about.\" With that, she got up and went back to her spot. At half time, she snuck to the locker room and listened to Coach Gaines yell at the boys. When she got back she walked over and told the cheerleaders that they needed to get it together and yell as loud as they could to give the boys energy. She kept hearing Boobie taunt Coach Gaines until he finally got his way and went in the game. She saw him go down on his first play, Lily cringed and held her breath, willing for him to get up. When he finally got back to his feet, Lily let out a sigh of relief. Maybe he'll be ok after all , she thought. Unfortunately for Boobie, and the team, Lily spoke too soon. On his second play he was hit hard, she knew instantly that his career was over. Lily tried to keep positive, knowing that every so often one of \"her boys\" would look at her. She said a silent prayer begging God to somehow allow a miracle that would permit the boys to go to state. Lord, please let these boys make it to state. The town needs this, the team needs it, especially my boys. I swear if they make it to state by winning this game I'll go to church more, I'll make the boys go too. Please God, they need to make it to state. Amen. The boys started to rally for a last ditch effort to win the game. Mike threw a pass for the last play, but it was too high and they lost the game. She knew that they still had a chance of the playoffs, though, but it was up to chance, literally the flip of a coin. She waited outside the locker room again, knowing that the boys would be devastated with the loss. When Mike came out, he hugged her, he was crying \"I'm sorry Lil, I'm sorry.\" \"Shhh, you have nothing to be sorry about Mike, you played hard out there. You still have a chance at the playoffs.\" \"I'm riding with Coach to the coin toss\" \"Ok, I'll drive myself home.\" Then Brian, \"Hey\" he said. \"Hey, you guys will still make it to the playoffs, I can feel it. No worries ok?\" Don was the last person out of the locker room \"Donnie, you played hard out there, it was just an off day for the team. Don't worry about it. Y'all are still gonna make it to state, I can feel it. I know your dad is gonna give it to you tonight, promise me you'll come over. Promise?\" she pulled away and looked at him. \"I promise, Lil, I promise.\" Then they walked out to the parking lot and went their separate ways. Once at home, Lily showered and dried her hair, and got ready for bed, she pulled out the bottom bed. She couldn't stop thinking about Donnie and how worried she was about him, and about the team and how much state meant to them. After Don took his father home, he snuck out to go to Lily's just like he had promised. When he climbed through the window, Lily let out a sigh of relief and ran up to him \"Are you ok? Let me look at you.\" she noticed his face was stained with tears. \"Hey come here,\" she sat down on the bed and hugged him \"Don't let him get to you ok? You're a great person, one of the best I know; don't let him tell you any different. Don't worry about what he thinks of you, if it's any consolation at all, I think you're awesome.\" She kissed his cheek. \"Now let's watch you guys get into the playoffs.\" She turned on the small television in her room and turned to the channel just in time to see the coaches flip their coins. She grabbed Don's hand, squeezing it tightly and letting up when it was said that they were all heads. Then when Cooper's coin turned out to be tails she looked at Don \"Congrats, what's the first thing you're going to do now that you're going to state? Get a celebratory ice cream sundae, get wasted, what?\" He looked at her \"Actually, none of those.\" \"Then what?\" she said raising an eyebrow. \"This.\" he leaned in and kissed her softly. She was shocked; too shocked to respond at first. But when he brought his hand up to the side of her face, she felt her hands automatically moving up to rest on his chest. He tangled a hand in her hair, the other resting on her side and tracing shapes into the little sliver of her skin that was exposed. When they finally pulled away, her eyes were still closed and she smiled to herself as she rested her forehead on Donnie's. \"What was that?\" she whispered, her forehead still against his. He finally broke their contact, \"I just kissed you,\" he said with a smirk. There was his attitude, Lily loved how cocky he could be sometimes but how sweet he was with her. She loved to pick on him when he got like that. \"Yeah,\" she said. \"Well?\" he asked, looking into her eyes. She raised an eyebrow, \"I've had better.\" It was a lie, she knew it, Hell he probably knew it too. He smirked, \"Well coach says to be perfect,\" before placing his hand on the back of her head and bringing her lips to his once more. This kiss was much more intense. He pulled her closer, she was surprised at how gentle he was being with her compared to all of the rumors she'd heard. There was no space in between them now and her hands tangled in his hair as she struggled to kiss him just as fiercely as he was kissing her. He had a hand on the small of her back pulling her closer, the other was on the side of her neck. He was surprised at the intensity she was kissing him with, and even more surprised at how good of a kisser she actually was. He was totally caught off guard when she sucked his bottom lip between her teeth and pulled on it lightly before returning it back to its original position and trailed little kisses along his jaw line up to his ear. That's when she pulled away and returned his trademark smirk. \"Well?\" she repeated his words from earlier. He smiled, \"You're perfect.\" She smirked again, \"I know.\" Before pulling his lips to hers once again. They kept kissing, eventually Lily was laying down on the bed with Donnie propping himself up, practically on top of her. After some time, Donnie pulled away, \"I should probably get home…\" he said, standing up, \"Mike should be back soon.\" Lily bit her bottom lip, \"Yeah, you don't have to go though. I mean, I'm sure I can come up with a decent story.\" \"Well, I know my dad's probably passed out by now. And I should probably just go, but I'll see you tomorrow,\" he said. \"Alright,\" she said, standing up and hugging him. \"Be careful, Donnie. Be safe.\" He wrapped his arms around her, \"I will. Promise.\" He kissed the top of her head and made his way through the window to his car. He stopped and turned back, going back to her window, \"Do you want me to take you to practice in the morning?\" Lily grinned, \"Alright.\" She kissed his lips lightly, \"You'd better go before Mike sees you out here.\" \"Bye,\" he said, kissing her once more. \"Bye Donnie. Remember what I said, be safe,\" she said. \"I will,\" he said before running to his car.[Chapter 3] So here it is... sorry it's been so long. But I'm finally where I think I want to be with this one. There are probably only going to be two or three more chapters, so be on the lookout for them. Thanks for all of the reviews, they are greatly appreciated. Chapter Three The next morning, Lily found herself worrying about what to wear. She was actually nervous to be around Donnie for the first time in her life. The kisses meant something to her, she had never kissed anyone like that, with that much fire behind it. But her rational side kept telling her that it was Donnie, and he had kissed a lot of other girls. Her brain kept telling her that he was probably just caught in the moment, but her heart wished above everything that her brain was wrong. She was fussing with her hair when she heard a honk. Donnie was there. \"Mike, Donnie is here… he said he was going to drive me to practice today. I'll see you later!\" she called before giving her mother a kiss on the cheek and going out the door. Lily was silent when she got into the car, she didn't know how to handle the situation given what happened the night before. After a few minutes of nerve-wracking and uncomfortable silence, Lily finally spoke up. \"So… about last night, I…\" she started, before pausing, \"I mean, you know. I'm not… I mean,\" she sighed, she had the words in her head I'm not sorry about what happened, I'm just confused, really confused. I don't know if it meant something to you, but it did to me , but she just could not make them come out of her mouth. She was blushing uncomfortably and wringing her hands in her lap. Donnie stopped the car and turned to look at her. \"I wouldn't have done it if I didn't mean it,\" he said solemnly. Lily looked up at him, meeting his eyes, \"Really?\" she questioned, she knew that Donnie had hooked up with many girls in the past. She couldn't help but wonder if he \"meant it\" with them too. Donnie nodded, \"You're different. I've never felt like that before with anyone else. Last night, it was… well, different.\" Lily looked down at her lap, \"Different?\" she repeated, wanting to know what he meant by it. \"Different, but good. Really good. I like you, Lily. I don't know why it took me so long to realize it,\" he explained, \"But if you want to be just friends… I mean…\" Lily looked up at him, wanting to do something to reassure him that she felt the same way. She leaned in and gave him a small peck on the lips. \"I don't wanna be just friends,\" she said. \"Me neither,\" he said, \"But I've never really had a girlfriend before.\" \"I know,\" she said, \"I've never really had a boyfriend before.\" He grinned, \"I know. That's probably partially my fault.\" \"Yeah,\" she said, \"But are you saying that you…\" \"Yeah. Will you be my girlfriend?\" he asked. She smiled and pressed her lips to his softly. Donnie smiled when she pulled away, \"Is that a yes?\" Lily smirked, \"What do you think?\" He placed a hand on the back of her neck and pulled her in, kissing her softly. She pulled away slightly before leaning back in and kissing him once more. \"We should head to practice. It's already going to be a hard one, you don't want to run extra laps for being late,\" Lily reminded him. Donnie took her hand, \"Fine.\" \"We should keep it a secret until after state,\" she said calmly, \"I mean, you never know with my brother. It might screw up the team.\" He squeezed her hand, \"If that's what you want.\" \"I think it's best,\" she said. \"Alright. I won't tell anyone,\" he said. \"Good, me neither,\" she said. That Sunday, Donnie showed up at the Winchell house, knocking on the door. \"Lily, get the door,\" Mike hollered from the bathroom where he was drying his hair. \"Oh hi,\" Lily said awkwardly. \"Hi,\" Donnie said back, \"Um…\" he started. \"Mike is in the bathroom, he'll probably be out in a few minutes,\" she said. \"I didn't come here to see Mike,\" he said with a grin, \"I want to take you out.\" She grinned, \"Alright, let me make up an excuse as to why I'm out with you.\" She walked to the bathroom and knocked, only to see Mike's head poke out. \"Who was it?\" he asked. \"Just Donnie,\" she said, \"He needed my help with some Literature work, he's worried that if he doesn't do well on the test mean old Mrs. Monroe will keep him from playing at state. And since I got an A in her class…\" \"Right, go help him. Y'all study real hard, we need him at state,\" Mike reminded. \"Alright, I'll be back later,\" Lily said, giving a small wave before walking out to greet Donnie once again in the kitchen. \"Hi,\" he said. Lily smirked, \"We've already been through that, remember.\" \"Did he buy it?\" Donnie asked. \"Definitely,\" Lily said, \"Let's go, but it has to be somewhere that nobody will go to.\" \"I know the place,\" he said, ushering her to the car and opening the door for her. After a few minutes, they arrived at the football field. She looked at him, \"Really? You couldn't have thought of somewhere else?\" \"It's Sunday,\" he said, \"Nobody will come here on a Sunday.\" She grinned, \"And I said you needed a tutor.\" \"Just shut up and kiss me,\" he said. \"Gladly,\" Lily replied, leaning in and giving him a peck on the cheek before turning slightly to give him a peck on the lips. He moved over more to her side of the car and they began kissing more, she felt his tongue run along her bottom lip and she instantly opened her mouth. Their tongues danced as Donnie started to lean back, Lily followed only to be pushed back into her seat. She had left her seatbelt on. \"Oh,\" she giggled. Donnie quietly unbuckled it, leaving his hand resting on her hip as he pulled her backwards so that she was nearly seated in his lap. Unbeknownst to them, Brian Chavez spotted Donnie's car in the parking lot for Ratliff Stadium and pulled in, wondering why it was still there. He saw that Donnie was in there with a girl and couldn't resist picking on them a little. He went to the driver's side window and knocked softly. Donnie and Winnie didn't break apart. He knocked again, this time a little louder, causing Lily's head to shoot up with a look of shock. \"Shit,\" Brian said, opening the door so that Lily nearly tumbled out. \"You,\" he accused, pointing at Lily, \"And you,\" he said, pointing at Donnie, \"What were y'all doing?\" he asked, even though he knew the answer. \"Brian,\" Lily said, her cheeks red with embarrassment and her voice slightly higher than normal, \"I… we… you can't tell Mike.\" \"You mean he doesn't know?\" Brian asked. \"No,\" Donnie said. \"We were going to tell him after state, just in case, you know… him being pissed would throw off the game,\" Lily said, struggling to regain composure. \"That's probably a good idea,\" he replied. There was a long pause, then Brian started laughing. \"What's so funny?\" Donnie asked. \"It's just, you know, you… and her. I always thought I saw something, but I was never sure. Now I know I was right,\" Brian said, \"You two have got to find a better place to make out.\" \"Well I didn't think anyone would come here on a Sunday,\" Donnie said. \"You thought wrong, lover-boy,\" Brian said with a laugh. For the next couple of weeks, Donnie and Lily kept sneaking around, praying they wouldn't get caught again. When they were in school, or around Brian, he would shoot them a knowing glance or a smirk. One evening, after she had taken a shower and gotten ready for bed, there was a knock on her bedroom door. \"It's open,\" she half-yelled. Mike walked in. \"Oh, hey,\" she said. \"Hey,\" he said quietly. \"So… did you want something?\" she asked. \"Right,\" he said, \"Is there something going on with you? I feel like everyone knows something I don't.\" Oh shit , Lily thought. It was nearly impossible for her to lie to her brother, he almost always knew when she was lying. \"No, nothing is going on. I'm just nervous about state,\" Lily said, it was only a half-lie. She was worried about state, but she was more worried about him finding out about her relationship with Donnie before she was ready. Mike looked unconvinced, he walked over and took a seat on her bed. \"It's gotta be something else,\" he said, \"Other people have been acting weird lately too.\" \"What do you mean? Who are you talking about?\" she asked. \"Well Donnie for starters. And Chavez. It's like they know something I don't,\" he said. Lily pursed her lips, \"Well you know, if it's something big I'm sure it will come out eventually. But for now I just think everyone is on edge because of state and they want to get out of this town just like you do.\" \"You think?\" he asked. \"Yeah,\" Lily said, hating that she was deceiving her brother. ","Summary":" In Odessa, Texas, football was a way of life. It was no different for Lily Winchell and her family,"},{"Movie":"Friday Night Lights","Title":"One Thing","Author":"tinytoppler95","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7777752","Passage":"[Chapter 1] One Thing Disclaimer: I do not own Friday Night Lights. Prologue: Hannah and Quentin August 6, 1988 Pre-Season Day One \" It's MOJO Radio back on the air, Slammin' Sammy here, football time in Texas. Let's go to the phone, we got Butch online with us. Butch, is this gonna be a great year or what?\" The loud voice of Slammin' Sammy was all Quentin \"Q\" Owens needed to wake up. He flipped his legs over the side of the bed and rubbed his eyes as the conversation with Sammy and Butch blasted over the radio. He let out a huge sigh and walked out of his room. As he slowly headed towards the bathroom, he noticed that the light was turned on and the tap was running. He pushed the door open and noticed a small girl with long black hair, a dark-olive skin tone, and chocolate brown eyes wearing baggy grey sweat pants and a white tank top. The girl heard the bathroom door lightly colliding against the wall and looked through the mirror to meet with a pair of dark brown eyes. She noticed a boy wearing a pair of plaid boxer shorts and a grey short-sleeved shirt. The color of his hair was similar to her's although his hair was much shorter and stood up at odd ends. \"Hannah,\" Quentin greeted dully, making minimal eye contact with the girl. Hannah gave Quentin a brief nod and continued her business at the sink. She pulled out her toothbrush and covered the bristles with a thick layer of toothpaste. Quentin came up from behind Hannah. She shifted sideways from the sink and began to brush her teeth. Quentin adjusted the faucet and ran his hands under the cold water, splashing it onto his face. The chilling sensation shocking his nerves awake. He continuously splashed his face until he felt chills running down his spine. Once he was finished, he looked up at the mirror and felt a sharp nudge at his hip, causing him to stumble over. Hannah leaned over the sink and spat out the foamy toothpaste, giving Quentin a devious smile once she finished. She threw a towel at Quentin—which he caught with ease—and began to rinse out any remaining toothpaste in her mouth. Once Quentin finished drying his face, he threw the towel back at Hannah. \"You ready for today?\" He asked curiously. Hannah wiped her mouth with the towel Quentin threw her and nodded. \"Hopefully.\" She replied with a nervous smile. Quentin gave a small smile and walked out of the bathroom. Hannah followed in pursuit, grabbing a large hairbrush sitting on the edge of the sink before she left. The two teens entered the kitchen and were greeted by the heavenly aroma of pancakes, bacon, and eggs. They sat at the small dinner table in the corner of the room and began to dig in. Quentin took a pile of flapjacks and dropped them on his plate, smothering each cake with a load of butter and drowning them in maple syrup. Hannah on the other hand, kept her plate clear and tried to untangle her long black hair with the large hairbrush she brought from the bathroom. A woman with short, curly black hair and soft brown eyes matching Hannah's emerged from the kitchen, setting down a plate filled with bacon. \"Morning mom,\" The two teens greeted, continuing their matter at the table. The woman gave the teens a large smile and kissed the top of their heads. She took the hairbrush out of Hannah's hand, and began tying her hair back into a French braid. As her mother was doing her hair, Hannah reached across the table and switched her empty plate with the one filled with bacon. \"You better save some,\" Quentin muffled, his mouth full of pancakes. Hannah rolled her eyes and tossed a single piece of bacon onto Quentin's plate. \"Really?\" He asked in a serious tone, switching his glare from the single piece of bacon resting on top of his pancakes to Hannah. Hannah nodded, giving another one of her devious smiles, reaching for the maple syrup, and—like Quentin did with his pancakes—drowned the bacon in the cold, sticky syrup. Quentin gave a revolting look, trying to force the pancakes down his throat. \"Gross,\" he commented quietly. He looked up at his mother, who was too busy trying to make Hannah's hair look perfect. Instead of pushing his plate forward, Quentin looked down at the meal in front of him and continued eating in slow, small bites. Hannah quietly laughed to herself and hugged her legs to her chest. She pulled a piece of syrupy bacon from her plate and began to savor her sweet and salty breakfast. \"Where's dad?\" Hannah asked, after eating a couple strips of bacon. This caught Quentin's attention as he looked up at his mother for her answer. \"At work.\" Their mother replied. The two teens gave each other a solemn look and Hannah went back to eating her breakfast while Quentin continued making eye contact with his mother. \"Is he gonna be done sometime soon so he can come and watch?\" Quentin wondered. Their mother finished tying up Hannah's French braid and shrugged her shoulders, expressing a heartbroken glare and shook her head. The two teens dropped what they were doing and sat back into their chairs. Both of them had disappointed looks on their faces. \"I'm sorry,\" their mother said quietly, \"but you both know how hard it is for us right now.\" Silence filled the room. \"I have to go to work.\" She stated, breaking the silence. Their mother kissed their foreheads once more and left the kitchen to leave the two teens alone and prepare for work. A few minutes of awkward silence passed the time, neither of the teens touching their breakfast. Once he heard the front door open and shut, Quentin decided to break the tension and glared at Hannah with a grim expression. The small girl looked up and returned a serious glare identical to Quentin's. The two of them didn't have to say anything to each other. It was like they read each other's minds. They grabbed the glasses sitting in front of them and gulped the contents down in large portions. They gave each other a short nod, stood up from their seats, and left the kitchen. A/N: Well, there's the prologue! I hope you guys like it! After watching Friday Night Lights a few days ago, I immediately remembered an episode of a Disney show I used to watch called The Proud Family . There was this one episode called: 'She's Got Game' and it totally gave me the inspiration to write this story. I also remembered an episode of Degrassi: The Next Generation called 'Fight the Power' which also inspired me to write this as well. If you've seen any of these shows and any of these episodes, then you probably know where this story might be going. Reviews are always welcome and constructive criticism is a must! Ciao! -Katie[Chapter 2] One Thing Disclaimer: I do not own Friday Night Lights. Chapter One: The Boys Hannah and Quentin walked into the parking lot of Ratliff Stadium, duffle bags hanging from their shoulders. Hannah remained in her baggy grey sweat pants and white tank top while Quentin changed into a striped t-shirt which he tucked in his jeans, his messy hair was combed back. They walked towards a tall boy leaning against a rusty old truck. He had dark skin and dark eyes. He had a mustache above his lip, making him look older and more intimidating. Both Hannah and Quentin looked past the intimidation factor and smiled at the boy, who gave a short nod to them in return. Quentin held out his hand. \"Ivory,\" he greeted, keeping a smile on his face. Ivory Christian slapped Quentin's hand and gave the boy a brief nod. Hannah silently walked up to the large boy and gently wrapped her small arms around his broad shoulders. Ivory leaned in only slightly and placed a single hand on her back. As the two let go, Hannah gave the larger boy a small smile. Ivory gazed over Hannah's head, a cold glare plastered on his face. Quentin and Hannah turned to see another dark boy running up to them, his white shirt dangling from the waistband of his sweat pants. A white car came zooming into the parking lot and halted right beside Quentin, Hannah, and Ivory. A blue car drove from the side of the stadium and parked right beside the white car. The driver in the blue car made brief eye contact with the passengers in the white car as they simultaneously stepped out onto the parking lot. Two boys emerged from the white car. The driver was a Hispanic boy with short black hair and deep brown eyes. The other boy had long, sandy blonde hair, his eyes hiding behind a pair of sunglasses. The driver of the blue car had light brown hair and green eyes. The shirtless dark boy was the first one to approach Quentin, Hannah, and Ivory. He held his hand out towards the small group and Ivory was the first one to it, followed by Quentin. \"'Sup Ivory, Q,\" The shirtless dark boy greeted loudly. Hannah left the boys and walked over to the Hispanic and the green-eyed boy, giving the both of them a light embrace. \"Ready to work?\" The green-eyed boy asked Hannah and the Hispanic boy. The two of them nodded, their faces expressionless. \"'Sup Boobie?\" The sandy-haired boy addressed monotonously, slapping the dark boy's hand. \"State?\" James \"Boobie\" Miles asked the sandy-haired boy. \"State.\" He replied dully, giving Hannah a side hug as the group walked towards the stadium. \"State? State?\" Boobie asked the Hispanic and green-eyed boy, giving the two of them a high five. \"State.\" The two bluntly replied. Boobie took one look at Hannah, scoffed and shook his head. \"Hannah, you're late. Cheerleading tryouts already started half-an-hour ago.\" Hannah smirked and shook her head. \"Give it up, Boobie. I'm only here for one reason and one reason only, and that's to take you down honey.\" \"What, you don't care about State?\" Boobie arrogantly questioned. \"I'll make that my priority after you hit rock bottom.\" Hannah replied confidently. \"Don't get over yourself, girl! Even if you grew a foot taller and gained an extra fifty pounds of muscle, you still won't be able to take Boobie down.\" Hannah rolled her eyes and stuffed her hands into her pockets. \"Whatever.\" She replied sheepishly, quickly regaining her confidence. \"Bring on the tyros, the neophytes, and the dilettantes.\" This received a chorus of groans from a few of the boys. \"SAT's are over, Hannah.\" The Hispanic boy said in a matter-of-factly tone. Hannah turned around and faced the Hispanic boy as she walked backwards. \"And you're still jealous of my score, Chavo.\" She laughed. Brian \"Chavo\" Chavez shook his head in shame and glared down at the ground. \"Can we please not talk about SAT's?\" Quentin asked Hannah in a worried tone, \"I'm still trying to recover from the physical humiliation you put us through last year.\" \" Physical humiliation ?\" Brian repeated, raising a brow at the dark-haired boy. This caused Boobie and Ivory took look at Quentin with a raised brow as well. Quentin pointed at Hannah. \"She literally tied me, Mike, and Donnie down to chairs to study for our SAT's!\" He accused. He received a chorus of laughter from both Boobie and Brian while Ivory shook his head. \"Hey! If it weren't for me, you guys wouldn't have gotten a 1600 on those exams and you wouldn't be walking in this stadium as we speak. You're welcome.\" Hannah retorted. \"Thank you Sister Hannah,\" Quentin replied sarcastically, \"I love you.\" He flashed a goofy smile. Hannah rolled her eyes and displayed a bitter smile. \"That was an over-share bro,\" She disappeared behind the door to the women's locker room. Once Hannah dispersed from the group, Quentin, Brian, Boobie, and the sandy-haired boy shared a small laugh. \"I still can't believe the two of you are twins.\" The sandy-haired boy—Don Billingsley—stated casually. \"Don't remind me,\" Quentin warned, shaking his head in embarrassment. \"Seriously,\" the green-eyed boy—Mike Winchell—added, \"When I first met y'all, I thought the two of you were a couple.\" Quentin turned to Mike and gave him a disgusted glare while Brian, Don, and Boobie tried to hold back their laughter. \"Okay Winchell, now, that was an over-share.\" Brian, Don, and Boobie couldn't contain themselves as they walked into the men's locker room bursting with laughter. It was hard for people to believe that Hannah and Quentin were twins, let alone related. Besides the gender difference, there were many physical factors that made them seem unrelated. Hannah was a small girl, with the height of five foot two and weighed less than 100 pounds because of her high metabolism. She had a dark skin complexion and soft brown eyes, just like her mother. She was considered the \"perfect\" one in the family, being both academically and athletically talented. She never brought home a grade under an A- and was a quick learner on the field and in the classroom. Quentin, on the other hand, was the complete opposite. He was a large guy for his age, being exactly six foot three and weighing over 180 pounds because of the amount of muscle he has. His skin was a much lighter complexion compared to Hannah's and his eyes were much darker, traits he received from his father. He was constantly being compared to Hannah with his grades—always bringing home grades that were lower than B's. However, he seems to learn much faster than Hannah when it comes to the playing field. One look at the two of them and people would think they were a couple because they didn't look alike and they never went anywhere without each other. It was extremely difficult for both Hannah and Quentin to convince everyone that they were twins; until they turned sixteen and got their licenses—that's a completely different story. Hannah glared at her reflection in the mirror, gripping the sides of the sink. She felt weak. The padding on her shoulders was weighing her down, as if someone was forcing her to kneel. The padding on her legs felt like imaginary hands exploded from the ground, trying to pull her through the floor tiles. Her neck was burning in pain as her entire body trembled. Her fingertips felt like she was clutching ice, her breathing short and choppy. Her eyes were bloodshot and filled with tears; her skin was almost as pale as the sink she was grasping. Hannah tried to control herself by taking deep, slow breaths, her eyes easing back to white. After she felt like she had complete control of herself, she bent down to her duffle bag and pulled out something silver and shiny. She peeled the silver wrapper, revealing a thin white strip underneath it. Hannah shoved the white strip in her mouth and a minty aroma devoured her tongue. She tossed the silver wrapper to oblivion and hoisted her duffle bag over her shoulder, heading out the women's locker room. Hannah burst through the doors of the boy's locker room. Not one person took her entrance by surprise and yelled for her to get out. The boys were used to it. As long as she didn't burst through the doors while they were naked, she was allowed in the boy's locker room. She would go to the boy's locker room mainly because she would always ask Quentin to tape her ankles—she trusted nobody else but her brother for that job. She would also go to the boy's locker room for any pre-game pep-talks and game plans the coaches told the team so she wouldn't feel left out. Hannah took a moment to observe her surroundings. Everyone was already dressed in their warm-up gear and a majority of them were already in their padding. A few were taping their wrists while others were tying up their laces. She found her brother sitting beside Don and Brian and made her way over to the trio. \"Hey bro,\" she called out to Quentin, catching his attention, \"tape up my ankles?\" He gave a small nod as Hannah reached into her bag and tossed a roll of athletic tape in her brother's direction. Quentin caught the tape and began to unravel it, changing his position on the bench. Hannah sat in between Don and her brother and dropped her bag to the floor, resting a bare foot on the bench. A few minutes later, the loud and obnoxious voice of Boobie Miles was heard from across the locker room. Hannah and Quentin shook their heads in shame while Boobie was tormenting Chris Comer—his \"backup backup\". Boobie was criticizing Chris on his white Adidas, telling him that the \"proper\" shoes were black Nikes. Hannah glanced down at her open bag, a pair of white shoes stood out from the contents in her bag. \"I have white Adidas,\" Hannah mumbled, loud enough for Don and Quentin to hear her. The two boys smirked at her comment. \"Nothing holds a nickel next to Nike!\" Boobie yelled. \"And nothing holds a bastard next to Boobie.\" Hannah murmured, completely unaware of what she just said. This got Quentin and Don into a quiet laughing fit with Quentin almost dropping Hannah's tape on her ankle. Even Brian gave a small smile at Hannah's comment. \"Ask Ivory, ask Preacher Man!\" Bobbie commanded. \"The kind of shoes on your feet don't matter.\" Ivory stated, tying up his own shoes—ironically enough, they were black Nikes. This was the first time Hannah and Quentin heard him talk all day. \"Amen.\" Hannah and Quentin said quietly. \"C'mon Preacher, bullshit!\" Boobie protested. \"Don't matter at all.\" Ivory said. \"You know God made black beautiful. God made Boobie beautiful! Black and strong…\" Don shook his head. \"His mouth just keeps gettin' bigger and bigger and bigger.\" It was Hannah's time to laugh as she switched her feet so Quentin could tape the other ankle. Boobie continued his rant about how he could knock anyone out with his black Nikes, Ivory challenged to knock him out with a pair of flip-flops. \"You know he will!\" Hannah inserted, wanting to make Boobie shut up once and for all. Boobie laughed. \"Yeah well, I'm gonna knock 'em out with Nikes on my feet and I'm gonna smile when I do it.\" The locker room fell silent with the exception of the sound of closing lockers, athletic tape being unraveled and Hannah and Don mumbling insults about Boobie. \"Thank God he's done talking.\" Quentin said, ripping the tape from the roll. \"I was gonna go up to him and tape his mouth shut.\" He waved Hannah's remaining roll of tape in the air. Don, Brian and Hannah all shared a genuine laugh as Quentin smiled and tossed Hannah's tape into her bag. Quentin stood up, and began pacing back and forth in front of the three teens, collecting his thoughts and getting into 'the zone'. Hannah stood up from the bench and lightly rolled her ankles to loosen the tape from its sturdy grip. She sat back down and pulled a pair of white socks from her bag followed by her white Adidas. \"I swear to God, if Boobie comes up to me and starts criticizing me about my shoes, I will shove these down his throat with no hesitation.\" She told Don and Brian. The two raised their brows and snickered. \"He already makes fun of you for being a girl,\" Brian pointed out. Hannah rolled her eyes. \"Not the point Chavo. Football isn't about setting some goddamn trends. It's about playing the game with heart no matter what kind of shoes you wear on your feet. Clearly, Ivory's the only one who gets it.\" Brian and Don shook their heads and went back to their business. Once Hannah finished tying up her shoes, she took another observation of her surroundings. Mike was sitting on the other side of the room with a binder wide open in his hands. He was reading the pages like a maniac, his finger trailing every word on the pages as his leg bounced up and down. Ivory bowed his head and clutched his helmet in his hands. His eyes were closed and his lips were making small movements. He was praying. Don had a pair of earphones jammed in his ears. He nodded his head to the beat of the music, not giving a care in the world if anyone could hear his music as he turned up the volume. Brian had his nose planted in a book. His mind was taken over by his imagination as he read the descriptive words to the story. He looked over at Don and shook his head in irritation as the volume of Don's music escalated; he could almost hear the lyrics to the song. Quentin continued pacing back and forth, cracking his knuckles and blocking out the world. His mind began to clear with every step he took, his breathing was smooth and slow. Hannah continued to examine the locker room. She sat Indian-style on the bench, popping her gum. The music from Don's walkman was gradually increasing in her ear. She ignored Don's horrible taste in music and began to get herself in the zone. \"Let's go. Five minutes, let's go.\" The coach ordered. All of a sudden, everyone in the locker room slowly dispersed through the door to the field. Mike finished reading the last few words on the page he was reading. Ivory did the sign of the cross. Don stood up with his helmet in one hand and his walkman in the other and headed for the door. Brian closed his book and threw it in his locker. Quentin grabbed his helmet sitting on the bench. Hannah grabbed her helmet out of her bag and threw her belongings in Quentin's locker. Just as she was about to head out the door, out of the corner of her eye, she saw Chris sitting on a bench. She took one look at the door and noticed that her brother and the team were already gone. She craned her head back in Chris' direction and saw that he was coloring his shoes with a black sharpie. Hannah heaved a huge sigh and shook her head. \"You're not gonna make me be the only player on that field with white Adidas are you?\" Hannah asked as she walked up to the young teen. Chris looked up in surprise to see Hannah Owen standing in front of him with a raised brow. He looked down at Hannah's feet, saw a pair of white Adidas and chuckled in embarrassment. He set the half-colored shoe down, and closed the sharpie. \"Well, um…after what Boobie said—\" \"Fuck what Boobie says!\" Hannah exclaimed angrily. \"Everything he says is literally pulled out of his ass! The color of your shoes doesn't make you a better player; you're passion for the game does.\" Chris went silent and looked down at the ground. \"You can't let him tear you down because of the shoes you wear.\" Hannah continued, her voice quickly went soft, \"Shoot, he tears me up every day because I'm a girl. Do you see me complaining? No. Instead, I get my ass out on that field and prove him wrong. You should too.\" Hannah left the room without looking back, leaving Chris to sit all alone to absorb her words. He exhaled a huge sigh and shook his head. He picked up the sharpie and continued coloring his white Adidas. A/N: There you have it, Chapter Uno! I hope you guys like it!

Chapter Two: Practice and Interviews The players of the Permian High School football team lined up at the side of the field. All defensive players wore black jerseys while the offensive players wore white. Something caught Quentin's eye as he took a glimpse at the end of the field. A group of people came piling into the stadium, some holding cameras and other news equipment while others walked in wearing Permian colors: black and white, showing their MOJO pride. Quentin noticed a few people standing out from the crowd, all wearing a variety of bright colors and baseball caps representing different universities—scouts. \"We got company.\" He mumbled, eyeing the scouts. Hannah, Don, and Brian craned their heads to where Quentin was looking and saw parents, the press, and scouts walking on the track surrounding the field. Parents and scouts immediately placed themselves on the bleachers while the press was finding a place to set themselves up. \"I hate the press.\" Hannah stated coldly, watching every single move the press made as they assembled themselves on the track. Ever since Hannah played football for Permian, the one thing she despised the most—besides the cheerleaders—was the press. Because of the fact that she's the only girl on the team, the press thought that they could take complete advantage of her and ask her more questions than they would for the rest of the athletes. Most of the questions they asked her questioned her strength and abilities on the team. This aggravated Hannah to the extreme. \"Lighten up Hannah,\" Don said, slapping the small girl on the back, \"maybe they won't ask you as many questions this time.\" Hannah scoffed. \"Bullshit.\" She looked up at Don and noticed that the expression on his face was distressed, his eyes pointing in the direction of the bleachers. She followed the blonde's eyes and noticed a man with dark eyes and brown hair covered in a MOJO baseball cap looking in her direction. His stare was cold enough to make Hannah freeze up in the extreme Texas heat. It wasn't until she noticed that the man was staring right at Don. She turned around and faced the sandy-haired boy. \"Just pretend he's not watching.\" She advised in a delicate tone. She added a small smile, hoping to lighten up his mood. Don took his focus off his father, met with Hannah's eyes and nodded. The expression on his face shifted from worried to serious. \"Where're your parents?\" Brian asked the twins. Hannah immediately gazed at the ground and fiddled with her fingers. \"Who cares?\" Quentin furiously replied, his eyes wandering around the field. Don and Brian shared a curious look then eyed the twins, completely disturbed of their bizarre actions. The sound of the whistle echoed throughout the field—practice has already begun. After a rigorous warm-up that seemed to last forever, the team finally began a scrimmage. As the scrimmage went on, the players who weren't participating were being interviewed by the press. Hannah sprinted across the field, escaping the tight grip of her tacklers. \"PASS! PASS!\" one of the coaches screamed. Boobie Miles threw the ball across the field. Hannah glanced over her shoulder and saw the egg-shaped ball flying in her direction. She extended her arms toward the ball as her legs dashed toward the goal post. She felt a light THUD crash against her padding as she clasped the ball, holding it as if she was protecting a baby. Hannah ran right to the goalpost and dropped the ball in victory. A chorus of chants came across the field. Hannah knew not to get her hopes up; she knew the cheering was for Boobie. \"Alright Hannah, Boobie, take a break!\" One of the coaches ordered. Hannah walked off the field and pulled the helmet off her head. Her hair that was once pulled into a perfect French braid was now drenched in sweat and began to fall loose. She stood at the sidelines and grabbed a random water bottle, squirting the cool water into her mouth then all over her sweat-covered face. Boobie grabbed the water bottle from her hand mid-squirt, and helped himself to the cool beverage. \"Hey!\" Hannah screamed, reaching to grab the bottle, but her arm was blocked by Boobie's hand. \"Boobie,\" A voice called out, the two teens turned to face one of the coaches who pointed his thumb towards the press, \"Press wants to talk to you.\" Boobie flashed a bright smile at the coach and threw the water bottle at Hannah, who was fumbled with it as it hit her chest. Hannah finally had control of her coordination and held the bottle in her hands. Anger rushed through her veins as she squeezed the bottle in fury, wasting the cool liquid on the field. \"Dick,\" she mumbled to herself, throwing the bottle to the ground and studying the scrimmage. It was Quentin's time for a break as he walked up to his twin sister and picked up the now dented water bottle she dropped. \"Boobie?\" he asked curiously, holding up the bottle. Hannah kept her gaze on the scrimmage and nodded. Quentin quietly laughed and tossed the bottle to the side. The twins got distracted from the scrimmage and heard the booming voice of their coach. They looked over to the source of the voice and saw Coach Gaines asking Chris Comer what he was supposed to do. The young teen stuttered his answer and received an immediate comeback from Gaines. Both Hannah and Quentin bowed their heads, feeling empathy for the junior. The twins tried to focus their attention back to the scrimmage. \"Quentin!\" A voice called out. Quentin turned his head and saw a coach motioning him to come his way. Quentin took a quick glance back at the scrimmage and ran over to the coach. \"Yeah coach?\" he asked. The coach placed a hand on Quentin's back and pointed towards the group of people holding microphones and surrounded by cameras. \"They want a few words with you.\" The coach answered. Boobie shook hands with each of the reporters and jogged his way over to the sidelines, where he continued to torment Hannah. The coach gave Quentin a light shove as he stumbled his way over to the press. Quentin tried to control his nerves as he clutched his helmet in one hand and wiped the sweat off his brow with the other. This was the very first time Quentin has ever spoken to the press. He knew his twin sister Hannah has had her time to shine with the press before, but that was only because she was the only girl on the Permian football team and the press made such a huge deal about it that they couldn't get their cameras off her. Once he approached the media, one of the reporters greeted him with a smile. \"Hello, you must be Quentin Owens.\" He said, extending his hand to Quentin, which he nervously shook. \"We just wanna ask you a couple of questions.\" Quentin nodded, trying to hide his nerves with a blank expression on his face. The interview began with the press asking him some simple questions: the position he plays, how it feels to play for Permian, and his prediction about the State Championships. The questions came and went as Quentin tried his best to answer them without stuttering. All of a sudden, the interview became serious and focused more on Quentin. One of the reporters asked him about his experience on the team...it eventually went downhill from there... \"Girl, why don't you get your pretty little ass into one of those cheerleading uniforms and cheer for Boobie?\" Boobie asked, slapping Hannah on the rear end. Hannah grabbed her back side and gave Boobie a death glare. Boobie putting a hand on her \"personal property\" was enough to make Hannah go on a rage. She had enough of Boobie's harassment for the day. \"You know what?\" Hannah asked the dark boy angrily. She held her hands out, wanting to use this opportunity to wrap her hands around his neck. Then she immediately remembered the people in field that could possibly be watching her every move—the scouts…the parents… the press . If she strangled Boobie right then and there, there was a definite chance she would be kicked off the field for the rest of practice—and end up on the evening news. Hannah curled her fingers until they turned into tight fists and dropped them down to her sides. \"Go to hell, Boobie.\" She gritted through her teeth. Boobie gave a loud laugh, put his helmet back on his head and ran out to the field to continue scrimmaging. \"What was that about?\" A voice called out from behind Hannah. Hannah gasped and turned around to come face-to-face with Don, who was taking a sip from his water bottle. Hannah tried to avoid looking into his eyes and replied, \"Nothing. He's just being a prick.\" \"Well he had to do something to make you act like you wanted to kill him,\" Don replied casually, taking a step closer to the small girl. Hannah tilted her head and met with a pair of electric blue eyes. \"He told me to be his cheerleader and slapped my ass.\" She bluntly told him. Don raised a brow. \"He slapped your ass?\" Hannah nodded. \"I swear to God if they,\"—she pointed to the bleachers, where the parents and scouts were sitting—\"weren't here, I would've—\" \"Hannah!\" Don and Hannah turned to the source of the voice where a coach was walking in their direction. When he approached the pair, he pointed his thumb towards the media. \"The press wants to talk to you.\" He told Hannah. Hannah nodded. Once the coach turned his back, she closed her eyes and relived an unhappy sigh. Don gave the girl a lopsided smile. \"Have fun.\" He sang. \"You wanna go ahead of me?\" Hannah asked in a desperate tone. The tall boy laughed and shook his head. \"I already had my fifteen minutes of fame, sweetie,\"—he jerked his head to the end of the field—\"and so did your brother.\" Hannah turned around and saw Quentin heading in their direction, scratching the back of his head. \"How did it go?\" Hannah asked as her brother approached her. Quentin shook his head in embarrassment. \"Bad.\" He simply replied. \"What happened?\" Don wondered. \"I think I told them more than I should've…and I sneezed.\" Hannah and Don shared a laugh. \"You probably did fine,\" Hannah assured, placing a hand on his shoulder, \"and it's not like the sneeze is gonna make breaking news anytime soon.\" Once the laughter died, Hannah took a glimpse of the news reporters behind her and turned back to Quentin and Don. \"Well, I guess it's my time to shine in the lime light!\" Hannah said in an acerbic tone. She turned on her heel and strolled towards the press, sweaty palms clutching her helmet. A woman reporter was the first one to take notice of her and smiled at Hannah, extending her hand. \"Hello Hannah,\" the woman greeted, lightly tightening her grip on the teen's hand, \"it's good to see you again.\" \"Good to see you too.\" Hannah replied, trying to hide the fraudulence in her tone. If there was one thing Hannah hated more than Boobie Miles and the Permian cheerleaders combined, it had to be the Odessa press. For four years, the media's been watching every single one of her moves on the field, hoping to get something juicy to corrupt her reputation in the small town. It put more pressure on Hannah to be perfect on the field. She also hated being in the spotlight. The fact of receiving all the attention and having people praise her for it was embarrassing for her. Not to mention the fact that her teammates wouldn't get any recognition either. The beginning of the interview was settle for the most part. They asked her the simple questions—questions she's heard before and got sick of answering. Then they asked her opinion about winning the State Championship. As Hannah answered the question, she made sure to mention the team as much as she could, trying to make the interview less about her. Then one reporter asked her a question that made her fluster—it was about Quentin. Oh Quentin, Hannah thought, what did you do? Brian and Mike joined Quentin and Don at the sidelines. Don was the first one to notice Hannah walk back to the group and gestured his head in her direction. The rest of the boys turned and watched her approach them. She was staring at the ground with a bitter look on her face and her knuckles were turning white from gripping her helmet too tight. \"How did it go?\" Mike asked as Hannah appeared. She turned to Quentin and gave him a sinister glare. \"They asked a lot of questions.\" Quentin raised his hands to surrender. \"I told you, I told them more than I should've.\" A bright white smile emerged from Hannah's lips. \"Relax, I handled it.\" Quentin's jaw dropped. \"Then why did you give me that look?\" Hannah shrugged her shoulders, her smile growing wider. \"I just wanted to see your reaction. It made my day.\" \"How exactly did you handle it?\" Brian wondered, raising a brow. \"After being stalked by the press these past four years, you kinda just learn how to get them off your back for a while.\" \"Billingsley! Chavez! Winchell! Get back on the field!\" one of the coaches ordered. The twins nodded at the trio for good luck as they placed their helmets on their heads, nodding in return. Hannah and Quentin cheered for the boys as they ran to the field. It was Don's time to shine as he ran across the field with the ball cradled in his hands. Hannah and Quentin were cheering for him as he made a run for it. All of a sudden, a defenseman came out of nowhere and seized Don, pulling him to the ground as the ball flew out of his hands. The whistle blew as the players dispersed from the chaos. Don was hunched over the ground, breathing heavily, trying to regain his breath. Hannah rushed over to Don and placed a hand on his back. \"Are you okay?\" she asked, rubbing his back. Don was still breathing heavily, but managed to nod. She helped him up and pat him on the back as he ran back to the field. After a few more plays with Don fumbling the ball, Quentin noticed a man wearing a green shirt and a MOJO baseball cap walking onto the field. \"Oh no,\" he mumbled. Hannah heard the uneasy tone of her brother and followed his eyes to see Don's father—Charlie Billingsley—walk on the field. Charlie Billingsley approached Don and started a conversation with him in the middle of the field, gaining everyone's attention. Hannah noticed a woman wearing a tight white skirt and a black shirt walk onto the field, approaching Don and his father. The twins watched the conversation between Don and Charlie, feeling the tension rise on the field. Don began to walk away when his father grabbed him by the padding and pulled him down to the ground. Hannah, Quentin, and Brian made an immediate run for it, forming a wall between Don and Charlie. Brian and Quentin were trying to reason with Don's father while Hannah pushed Don away from the drama. Charlie immediately caught up to Don and Hannah and punched his son's helmet. \"Enough!\" the woman called, pulling Charlie out of the field. \"Embarrassing me out here,\" Charlie called out, pointing at his son. Don, Brian, Quentin, and Hannah walked back to their spots. Brian and Quentin pat Don on the back of his helmet while Hannah went back to her place in the sidelines, trying to let go of what just happened. A few seconds later, Don's voice rang throughout the field. \"YOU DON'T SHUT UP DO YOU?\" Just as Quentin was about to join Hannah, a fight sprang out between Don and Boobie. The twins shared a weary glare and booked it to the brawl. Quentin and Mike pulled Boobie back while Hannah and another player pulled Don back. Hannah noticed Boobie laughing hysterically and clapping his hands. As she tried to pull Don back, she gave Boobie a cold glare and shook her head. Don was struggling to break free from the player's strong grip. Hannah held a tight grasp on Don's wrists, forcing him to calm down and trying to meet with the his eyes. Once she got his attention, she softened her voice. \"He's nothing to you, okay? He's just a stuck up dick who thinks he's on top of the world! Just play the game for you alright? Not for your father, not for Boobie, for you .\" Looking into Hannah's soothing eyes and hearing her compassionate voice always made Don calm down when he was irritated. He didn't know why, but she always knew how to make things better. Don gave a curt nod and ran back to the huddle, with Hannah patting him on the shoulder as he left. Once practice finally ended, the players met up at the end of the field and took a knee, holding each other's hands. Coach Gaines stood in the middle of the huddle, taking a good look of each athlete kneeling before him. \"It's a good day gentlemen,\" Gaines told the team, then he noticed Hannah kneeling between Don and Quentin. \"—and Hannah.\" Hannah looked down at the ground in embarrassment while the rest of the team was looking her way, goofy smiles plastered on their faces. Coach Gaines continued his speech; going on about responsibility, protecting the team, the school, and the town. \"Make no mistake about it gentlemen—and Hannah—we are in the business of protecting this town. We're in the business of winning. The expectations couldn't be any higher. We will win state.\" \"We will win state.\" He repeated more quietly. A long silence filled the field. \"Can you be perfect?\" A/N: Chapter Two! How am I doing so far? Review and criticize! -Katie ","Summary":" One Thing Disclaimer: I do not own Friday Night Lights.

It was night time in the cornfield. Elliot, a curious 10 year old, was stalking the field, searching for something to do or an adventure that was to be had. He had blonde hair, which was medium in length reaching his neck, with magnificent curls which could match that of a lion's mane and bright blue eyes, the perfect child of the Aryan race. The corn surrounded him in the field like the ghosts of the people he has lost waiting to possess his body and use it for their own sadistic and malevolent wishes. 'Oh shit!' said Elliot as he thought he saw something, but it was just the wind. He thought to himself how foolish he was and majestically laughed it off like the amazing human being that he is. What was he looking for? Excitement, fun a cheap thrill? He didn't know. He was sure however, that whatever he needed would be in this cornfield. Elliot had thought about this moment over and over in his head, it had been prophecy given to him by the Gods. SCREECH. There it was. Elliot ran, astonished by the noise. There it was again, calling to him like a siren. It sounded odd, complex, broody… attractive. The creature screeched again as if in pain, calling to him. Hitler would have been proud of this Aryan child's achievements. There it was. It was alive.

NOR DO I CLAIM THIS HAPPENED TO THE REAL LIFE CHARACTERS PORTRAYED IN FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. 1. First Quarter It started freshman year. I was the girl no one noticed. I was on every committee and almost every club. I had tried to make friends but it was difficult. I only knew a handful of people. Or, I should say, only a handful of people knew and remembered my name. I was invisible and I hated it. There was nothing good about being invisible...not when it's senior year. My older sister has spent the last three years telling me about her senior year. She was actually popular. For my first year at Permian High School in the glorious Odessa, Texas, she tried to help me. As head of Student Council and Yearbook, she assigned me to both of her committees. She never did say that I was her sister, though. Maybe if she did I would have been half as popular as her. As soon as she graduated, my importance was nonexistent. The summer of '88, I gave in and I called her. The last time I had saw her was in March. She came down from her school in Dallas to visit me for my birthday. She had told me then that she would do a complete overhaul of my wardrobe and look for my senior year. I laughed at her then but now I wanted it. There was one thing I wanted before I graduated. It wasn't a makeover. It wasn't a new wardrobe. It wasn't a diploma. It wasn't to leave this small town. It wasn't to be Prom Queen, or even in the court. All I wanted was number twenty-six, Don Billingsley. All I wanted was for him to notice me. So, I put all my faith in my sister's hands. A month before classes started, Carina came down from Dallas fro the weekend. Partly to help me and partly because she wanted Mom to do her laundry. \"What are you girls doing?\" I looked up at my mother as I sat on the floor of the bathroom. Carina was busy fiddling with my hair. \"I wanna be Prom Queen, Mom. Cari's gonna give me a makeover.\" My mother smiled. She always wanted me to be popular. Her and Carina both had been Prom Queen's their Senior Year...now it was my year. I couldn't bear the thought of telling her that I could care less about it. \"GOOD! We'll get you a wardrobe tomorrow! Cari, you'll be here?\" \"Yeah, Mom, of course! I can't wait to see my baby sister grow up or get some real style!\" Carina leaned over and kissed my cheek. She thought she was so funny. \"Oh boy,I can't wait,\" I said faking a smile. \"Hey, Mom, can we have some sisterly time?\" Our mother smiled and laughed. \"All right, girls, dinner will be ready soon.\" We both nodded as she slowly walked away. \"What is it you needed to talk to me about?\" Carina asked staring at me by the mirrior's glaze. I looked up at her. \"I need help. It's senior year. What do I need to do to get a jock to notice me?\" \"Football jock?\" \"Yeah...\" \"First string?\" \"I...I don't know. I think so.\" \"Senior?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What number?\" \"Twenty-six.\" I waited for her reaction. I figured she would be mad. Don had a name for himself even when he was only a freshman. It wasn't a good reputation. \"Why?\" She stopped and sat up onto the counter. \"Are you crazy?\" \"No, I'm sane. I just...He's cute and popular. How else do I get Prom Queen without first taming the beast?\" She glared at me. She disapproved. It was obvious and written all over her face. I didn't, nor could I, blame her. \"Daphne, what...why him? He's cute...from what I remember. I also remember him getting around.\" I shrugged. \"Maybe...but from what I remember, you weren't an angel either-\" Carina hit my shoulder quickly. \"Don't say that inside the house! Mom's here!\" \"Can you help me?\" Looking at her with despite eyes, I hoped she would cave in. \"Are you still a virgin?\" My jaw dropped. Never had my sister ever asked me something even remotely as awkward as this. \"YES! Oh my god! Why are you asking me? ARE YOU?\" \"Shut up! Daphne, I'm asking because if you want a guy like Don, you can't be a virgin. He won't go for it.\" \"No one said he had to know.\" \"He'll know just by looking at you. He has that ability. He's one of those.\" \"One of those?\" My eyebrow raised in her general direction. \"Yeah, he's one of those that can tell by how you talk and how you look,\" She jumped off the counter and closed the bathroom door. \"Look, if you want Don, you have to loose it. As your older sister, I am required to tell you that you shouldn't and that you should wait until marriage! But that would be if I was the good sister...I'm not a very good sister though. If you want to be with Don, then you need to loose it. Pop your little cherry.\" Something told me that my dearest sister was trying her hardest to help but didn't have a clue how to. She was scaring me. The idea of loosing my virginity wasn't something I spent all my time worrying about. I really didn't care about it. It didn't seem important to me. \"Maybe my virginity will be what makes him what me.\" \"Explain.\" I shrugged. This was going to be something I was going to have to just think of on the spot. \"Well, he's known to love sex. Maybe, just maybe, the whole thought that he can't have it will tame him. Maybe he will be compelled to try to change it.\" Carina nodded quickly. \"Damn, that might work. Either way we have to sex up your look. And...you need to start going to conditioning. Tomorrow's Saturday. There should be one of the field. I'll drop you off.\" \"What? No. No! I don't need to be sexed up nor do I need to go to conditioning. Why would I go there?\" \"The more you show up the more likely he is to remember your name or at least your look. You do want him to remember you, don't you?\" \"Yeah...okay, do upon me your worst.\" \"You mean, my best!\" I rolled my eyes as she grabbed her makeup bag. \"Right.\"[Chapter 2] Goals.

NOR DO I CLAIM THIS HAPPENED TO THE REAL LIFE CHARACTERS PORTRAYED IN FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. 2. First fumble of the season Somehow Carina had managed to convince me to go to conditioning. I felt as though my nerves were eating me alive. Only a few yards separated me from the number twenty-six. In those few yards, I had to convince myself that I could do this. Only a few yards to let the little voice, also known as my sister, lead the way. Those few yards were scaring the shit out of me. I stumbled my way to the bleachers and sat down towards the top behind the much more popular girls. Some of them I had known for years. Many of them were cheerleaders. All of them didn't know me. Regina turned and looked up at me. Her dark brown hair hadn't changed its style since elementary school. \"Hey, are you new?\" \"What?\" I looked at her. It was obvious she didn't remember me but to think I was new? Could this work for my advantage? Couldn't hurt to try. \"Are you new? I've never seen you.\" \"Ah...yeah, you got me. I'm new,\" the moment I said it, I regretted it. Something told me though, they weren't smart enough to find out if it was true. Regina smiled and waved me down to her direction. \"Come! Sit! Let's talk! Conditioning is SO boring!\" She pushed aside the light headed brunette next to her as I got to the bottom. She waited until I sat down before inducing a smile. \"So, what's your name? I'm Regina. I'm head cheerleader and I am dating that guy right there!\" She pointed into the crowd of the players. \"He's number twenty-six. Well we aren't dating yet. But we will be once school starts.\" I smiled fakely. She was lying. Don would never settle in a relationship. God, I hope not...at least not with her. That would just insure that my last year in high school would be terrible. \"I'm Daphne. What's his name?\" \"It's Don. Trust me, he's hot. Do you cheerlead? It's not too late to try out! I mean, I am cheer captain. I can make an exception.\" \"I don't cheerlead. Thanks, though. Is anything going on before school starts?\" \"Yeah! There's a party tonight! You should come with! You can meet some people!\" \"Yeah, okay, cool.\" \"I can pick you up,\" the lighter brunette said. \"I'm Bridgette, by the way. Nice to meet you.\" The other girls introduced themselves slowly but I had already faded my attention out. On the field, they were yelling at Don. They kept yelling his name and every time they did, I jumped. I turned my head slightly towards Regina. \"Why are they yelling?\" \"Oh, that? It's no big or anything. Don just doesn't do so well sometimes. He plays best when he's drinking. He isn't drunk right now so obviously...he sucks. It's okay, this is only conditioning. It's not like a game or anything.\" Regina laughed. She didn't take it seriously. The way she talked it sounded like Don had a drinking problem or something...which he did. \"So no reason to worry?\" Regina shook her head and let out another laugh. \"Nope, none. If he keeps messing up they may extend practice but it should be short. The reporters are coming in later to do their pre-season interviews for all of the team. So, it should be a short practice.\" \"Pre-season interviews?\" I questioned. I, honestly, had never paid attention to any of the media frenzy that followed the Panthers. I would much rather be at the game than to see a recap on TV. \"Yeah, they talk about like football and stuff. It's really boring but it takes almost an entire day's conditioning to do because they do everyone...which just means, the party starts sooner!\" Well, that answered every question I could ever have. \"Thanks, Regina. Does that mean it's happening soon?\" \"Must be. They're huddling,\" Bridgette said, poking her head out past Regina's. The team joined together in the middle of the field and kneeled down while the coach talked and the stream of reporters came onto the field. One by one the reporters choose a member of the team and interviewed them. All of us sat back and just waited. Within a few minutes the reporters left and the players were dismissed. Number twenty six walked over to the bleachers with his helmet in hand and looked up at us. He smiled as he looked at me. \"Hey, girls. Got a new recruit, huh?\" He stepped closer and extended his free hand to me. \"I'm Don.\" \"Hi,\" I said shaking his head. I instantly wanted to hit myself. Hi? Was that really what I just said? Yeah, he'll remember me for sure. \"Yeah, this is Daphne. She's new and my new bestie!\" Regina said as she popped up from the bleachers and engulfed him in a hug. I looked over as I heard Bridgette huff. Regina wasn't the best of friends for anyone. \"So, what time are we meeting up?\" \"We're going out to get burgers around six. Going right after to the party.\" Don stepped back just small amount. \"Daphne, are you going to come out with us to the party?\" \"Is that an invitation?\" He nodded. \"Yeah, come out with us. I'll even buy you a burger.\" Regina stepped back and looked at me with piercing eyes. \"Yeah, she's coming. She can't stay long, though. She's unpacking still.\" \"Alright, that works. I'll see you guys later. I gotta take a shower. Bye, Daphne.\" Regina waved and blew a kiss at Don before he walked off. He clearly wanted to ignore her. She must do nothing but bother him. \"Daphne, I'll pick you up for dinner. We have things to do. Talk later.\" I stood up and walked off of the bleachers as the girls went their separate ways. Something told me things just weren't going to go well now. I walked the fifteen minutes back to my house and immediately sat down next to Carina on the couch when she was watching Full House. \"What's wrong?\" \"I think I'm screwed.\" Carina looked over at me and exhaled. \"What happened?\" \"I met him. Met Regina. They're dating and now that he knows who I am, she's pissed at me.\" \"Well you are going to steal her boyfriend.\" \"He invited me to dinner and to a party.\" \"Oh, what time?\" \"Six. Regina basically uninvited me.\" \"So? Go anyway. Did he actually ask you out?\" \"He said 'Yeah, come out with us. I'll even buy you a burger.' Is that being asked out?\" I asked finally looking at her and away from the tv. Carina slapped his shoulder and shot up from the couch. \"YES! Oh my god, we need to get you something to wear and get you ready! Oh my god! My baby sister got asked out! Come on!\" Carina dragged me up the stairs and to her bedroom before she started pulling out clothes and throwing them around. I collapsed on her bed and just watched her as she threw around clothes. She was really enjoying this. \"Carina, why can't I wear what I have?\" She slowly turned around and glared at me. \"Really? Seriously? He asked you out. You can't go like that! Go take a shower so we can get you ready.\" I rolled my eyes then walked out of her room and straight into the bathroom and took a quick shower. Carina was definitely reading into this more than I was. Or...maybe she's onto something. I got out of the shower and walked back into her room and grabbed the outfit she had laid out. I quickly changed then went downstairs. \"Carina, anything else?\" \"Your makeup. Be up in a minute.\" I slowly trudged back up the stairs and sat down on the bathroom counter. She trailed in soon after and instantly started working on my makeup. \"What time is it?\" \"You have twenty minutes. So, gotta hurry. Is he coming to get you?\" \"No, Bridgette is.\" The doorbell rang and we both glanced into the hallway. \"She must be early. Makeup good?\" \"Great, you're ready.\" Carina walked out with me and down the stairs. I got to the door before her and opened it. \"Hey, you're early!\" \"Yeah, well, Don decided that everyone was meeting early. Should have warned you about that. Are you ready?\" \"Yeah, later Carina.\" Bridgette smiled then looked over at Carina. \"Is it okay if she spends the night?\" Carina looked at me then smiled. \"Yeah, it sure is. I'll let Mom know.\" I looked at Bridgette and nodded. \"Let me go grab an overnight bag. You can come in.\" I ran up the stairs with Bridgette and grabbed clothes and my toothbrush. \"What's going on tonight?\" \"Party. I was informed to make sure you had an alibi incase you didn't make it home.\" I looked over at her. An alibi incase I don't come home? \"From who?\" \"Listen, don't tell Regina. Don wants to...you know...hook up with you. I'm not supposed to tell you. Don't say anything.\" \"Hook up?\" She looked at me strangely. \"Yeah, have you like never done it before?\" I swallowed and walked down towards the stairs. \"Where is everyone?\" \"Already getting food. I'm supposed to get you and get you there.\" \"Right,\" I said walking out the door and to her car. We got in and sat down. She pulled out of the driveway and started heading there. \"What does he have planned?\" \"Don't say anything to Regina. Don likes you. Probably because he doesn't know you or...he thinks you're easy.\" I rolled my head and stared out the window. Yeah, Carina's really helping me...look like a whore. \"Awesome. Maybe I shouldn't go.\" Bridgette glared over at me. \"No, you're coming. If you don't go, Regina wins. I'm sick of her always winning. She's a crazy psychopath.\" I laughed. I guess I was right. No one likes Regina. \"Alright,\" I said as she parked. I got out and walked with her over to the tables. Don got up and waved. \"Hey, I went ahead and got you girls something to eat! Come on, sit down.\" We both ran up to the tables. \"Daphne, come sit.\" He waited until I sat down next to him before he sat down and passed me a burger. \"Thanks,\" I said taking it. I wasn't hungry but I couldn't exactly refuse. \"BILLINGSLY BILLINGSLY BILLINGSLY!\" I looked over to see a car full of older men calling out for Don. Don got up and walked over to them. \"We're leaving in a minute, might want to hurry,\" Regina said with the straw sitting on her tongue. I got up with Bridgette and threw away all of the trash from the table before Don even got back. He walked back with a light skinned Hispanic named Brian. \"I think we're ready,\" I said only looking at Bridgette. \"Cool, I gotta go and get some stuff. Regina has the address. See you guys later.\" Don waved and walked off. We all sat there for few minutes doing nothing. And then Regina piped up. \"I need to go to my house and get some stuff. Daphne, you did bring clothes, right? We can take them to my house.\" The two of us left the rest of Regina's squad sitting there and went to Regina's house. Regina drove to her house with me in the passenger seat. She didn't say too much until we got inside her house. \"Listen, you know I like you, right? Well...you need to just remember to watch yourself. Stay away from Don. He's bad. I don't want you to get hurt.\" She smiled at me as she took my bag and threw it onto her bed. She really wanted me to believe her. She was trying to be nice. \"Don't worry. I will. Thanks, Regina. I feel like we're best friends.\" She smiled and walked out of the house again and we head back to the girls. We were already running behind by almost an hour. So we hurried to pick up the girls and head out to the party. Regina and her crew ditched me as soon as we got tot he rowdy house party. I tried to follow them but the party had one too many wave for me to be able to follow. I quickly gave up and found myself relying on the staircase to keep me company. The sound of Dep Leppard was louder than I had ever heard. There were very few people I recognized. The people all around me where older and their mullets were un-kept. Their beer bellies made them look pregnant. They were a disaster. Why anyone would every go to these parties, I will never understand. \"I couldn't help but to notice you don't have a drink.\" I looked up after snapping out of my trance and staring at Don. \"Yeah, I just got here. Lost everyone,\" I said taking the cold, red plastic cup. \"I'm not surprised. It's busy tonight,\" he said leaning on the rail and taking a gulp out of his cup. \"Is it always like this?\" \"Ahh...pretty much. This is the first pre-season party, so half the town is here. A lot of freshmen tonight.\" I glanced up at him as he let his eyes wonder. Maybe this was a bad idea. \"Why are you wasting time with me when all these freshmen are running around?\" Don shook his head and finally took a seat next to me. \"Maybe because I wanna get to know you. I have a feeling someone's been telling you some shit about me and I'm sure it's not true.\" \"So that means what exactly?\" \"You tell me. What have you heard?\" I thought about his question. In reality, I knew a little. But Regina had told me next to nothing. \"Nothing...just that you're dating Regina but not dating Regina...\" He quickly shook his head and stood up. \"I'm not dating her. Don't listen to her. She thinks she can claim me but she can't. I'm not for keeps.\" \"Why would you say that?\" \"Because Regina thinks she can control me-\" \"No, why aren't you for keeps? Got some trust issues?\" He took a step down. \"I'll talk to you late, Daphne. Consider drinking that. There's more in the kitchen,\" he said before walking off. \"Don!\" I looked through the railing and watched as he trailed off. Why would he say that? And then storm off? He must really hate Regina or something...but...he did remember my name. He keeps saying it. Maybe Bridgette was telling the truth. I got up and tried to find Don. I kept crashing into the waves of people and ended up in the front room on the couch. I looked down at the cup he had given me. I took a quick gulp and had to put my hand to my mouth. It was terrible. My first beer and it was terrible. It tasted like vomit and bread. I put the glass on the coffee table sitting in front of me. \"Hey, sorry to intrude. Saw that you may need something good to drink.\" I looked up at the talk lanky dark haired guy standing there passing me a cup. I took it as he sat down next to me. \"What is it?\" \"It's a screwdriver. It has Orange Juice-\" Without letting him finish, I swallowed almost the entire cup before realizing it was burning just a little and moving the cup away from my mouth. \"And vodka. I'm Collin.\" \"Daphne, thanks for this. Beer's not my thing.\" \"It's fine. I hate it too. I-ah-have never seen you.\" \"Yeah, I'm new in town. Do you go to-\" \"College, visiting. Big game is coming up so I thought I'd come down and root on my home team.\" \"Cool.\"[Chapter 3] Goals. Friday Night Lights. Don Billingsley. Garrett Hedlund. fan fiction. hatericeviolence. DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT CLAIM TO OWN FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS OR ANY OF ITS RESPECTIVE CHARACTERS. NOR DO I CLAIM THIS HAPPENED TO THE REAL LIFE CHARACTERS PORTRAYED IN FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS. 3. The huddle I woke up with a splitting headache, hearing the sounds of yelling. It didn't click. I couldn't remember what happened. I stirred and pulled the sheets up over my head when it hit me. I was naked and the bed side next to me was warm. I pulled the sheets down and looked to where the yelling was. Standing at the end of the bed was Don and an oddly familiar looking guy who was tall with dark hair. I knew him. I met him. What was his name? What was his name…? Collin. \"What's going on?\" I moaned, just wanting the yelling to stop. Don shoved Collin to the floor before kicking him, literally, out of the door. \"Hey, are you okay?\" he asked, coming closer to me. The smell of beer on his breath made me wince as I turned my head away from him and nodded. \"I'm fine.\" I looked back at him and shrugged as I propped myself up. \"I think.\" \"Good, good.\" He sat down on the bed next to me and let his head hit the headboard. \"I was kind of worried. You disappeared last night.\" \"Last night?\" I blurted aloud. Last night? So, it's not Saturday and I'm in a stranger's bed. I looked around the room and quickly realized that there was no way I was at Regina's…unless Regina loves Hockey and Soccer and wears jockstraps. \"This isn't Regina's…\" \"No, she said you left with Bridgette and Bridgette said she hadn't seen you.\" \"So, you came to find me?\" \"That I did.\" \"What time is it?\" He glanced over to the other side of the bed nearest to the dresser. \"4:15.\" \"PM?\" I sat up quickly, instantly regretting it with the pounding headache. \"No,\" he said grabbing the sheets and placing them over my shoulders. I realized then that I was still naked and grabbed onto them and cuddled in. \"No, it's still AM. The party just started to end maybe twenty minutes ago.\" I nodded, leaned forward, and put my head into the sheets. I was embraced. My first party and what happens? I get drunk and pass out with some college guy to just have number twenty-six come to find me and save me. \"Awesome,\" I mumbled as his hand snuck up my back and startled me. \"Come on. Let's get you dressed and get you home.\" The bed's weight shifted as he got up and searched the room. I watched him with my head still down. Of all the things that could have happened, this happened. Don came to my rescue…but I still had no idea what happened. He looked over to me and made a concernable face. \"What?\" \"I don't see your clothes.\" \"What?\" I sat up quickly and let my eyes drift around the room. \"What do you mean you don't see my clothes?\" \"I mean they are not here,\" he said slowly while approaching me again. He stood next to me by the bed and took off his shirt and passed it to me. \"Put it on and I'll take you home.\" \"Your shirt? Really? This does not solve my problem. We can go to Regina's. She has my stuff.\" He grunted and turned away from me as I slid on his shirt. \"I guess. I'll be in the car-\" \"Hey, no, I'm coming with you. You're like my knight in shining armor,\" I whispered, realizing what I said and shaking my head. He turned around and smiled at me. \"You know it's probably the worst time to say this but I-uh, I need to make sure the car is even here.\" I stood there for a moment after he walked out of the door and felt like an idiot. Part of me for a minute thought he would say something completely different…but then again, I am naked besides from his shirt and it isn't from his doing. Carina is probably right…Don would never go after someone like me. I shook my head and followed him out of the door and to the car where he was standing with the door open. Pale faced, I got in and sat quietly as he got in and pulled out of the driveway. \"Nothing happened. I would have killed him if anything had,\" he said lowly with both hands on the wheel and his stare heading forward. \"Thanks, Don.\" \"Where do you live?\" My eyes rolled towards his direction when it sunk it. There was no way I could go home like this. \"All my stuff is at Regina's…\" \"Her parents will not be very happy if I show up at this hour.\" He glanced over to me then nodded quickly. \"We will go to my place. As long as you're okay with that.\" Was I okay with that? After all of this…was that even a good idea? I mean, was it? It was a lot to take in. A lot to even consider. I reminded myself quickly that I did have his shirt on and had nothing else on. I think I might be okay with hiding out for a little while. \"Okay.\" Don nodded and drove on with ease. I guess it was nice. I mean, he was worried about me…I think, at least. He wanted me to be safe and not naked. I should be grateful but the half-naked number twenty-six next to me is a little off putting. I couldn't have expected this. I couldn't have dreamed it if I wanted to. He parked outside of the house and walked to the door before stopping. \"Be quiet, okay? My dad's probably not feeling well.\" I nodded. I heard about his dad. His drinking problems were worst than Don's. I had seen him at the games before. He was violent towards Don, always screaming and yelling. I never really understood why. I followed him in the house and to his room. It wasn't what I expected. It was clean, grayscale, and then there was a bed. It only had a pillow and a blanket. Nothing fancy. Nothing that would have suggested that he had a name for bringing girls in here. He closed the door behind us and opened up a drawer, pulling out a pair of shorts and handing them to me. \"This is all I have but I'm sure it's better than nothing. I can get you another shirt,\" He walked away from the dresser and to the closet, ripping a shirt off a hanger and throwing it towards me, then waited with his back turned to me. I took my que and went ahead and changed before sitting down on his bed. And this is where the magic happens, I thought. I regretted thinking it. Part of me suddenly wanted to burn it. Don slowly turned around before exhaling and plopping down on the bed. I looked back at him. He was using his arm as a pillow and leaving the pillow just sitting there. Confused, I laid down, not sure if it was what I was supposed to do. \"You know this wasn't how I wanted to get you in bed,\" he laughed. My face flattened and he put his hand on my shoulder before shaking me lightly. \"I'm just kidding. I wasn't really planning on how to-you know, this was a…memorable night.\" \"Lucky I don't remember it.\" \"Nothing at all?\" I shrugged and rolled over to my side, facing him. \"A little but not much.\" \"Do you even remember getting to the party?\" \"Yeah, I remember that…\" I trailed off. The little details were surfacing in my head. Conditioning, burgers, Regina's, the party, loosing everyone, the staircase… \"Hey, Don.\" \"Hey, Daphne.\" \"Why aren't you for keeps? You seem like you'd be a really nice guy for someone. I mean, you went searching for me and now are taking care of me. You could be a great keeper.\" He shook his head and rolled onto his back before exhaling loudly. \"I'm not made for it. There's a difference between caring and giving a damn.\" \"Explain.\" His head faced me for a minute before returning to glare at the ceiling. \"Why are you so interested?\" \"I guess I'm not-\" Don cut me off by catching me off guard and pulling me closer towards him while he tried to kick the blanket upend over our legs. \"I'm kind of surprised Regina hasn't given you the 'back off' order yet. Everyone looks at my mistakes. Regardless of how many times I do something right, the only thing they ever see are the times I didn't do it right. To them, I never will do it right. So I just stopped giving a damn. I can care all day long but I just can't give a damn anymore. The more you do, the more it'll eat you alive.\" \"I don't judge your mistakes.\" \"You don't know them.\" I propped myself up on my elbows and looked at him. \"Maybe I know what you're saying better than you think.\" Of course I knew them. I wasn't a new student. I went to middle school with these people. I've been around their mistakes for so long. I've heard all about them. I know how Odessa feels about Don. Yeah, maybe he isn't the best person in the world but he tries to be the best him that he can be. \"You'll change your mind.\" \"I haven't yet.\" He moved my arms so I wasn't propped up anymore and scooted me closer. \"I like you, Daphne, but I know your impression of me will change.\" \"I don't think so unless it's for the better.\" He smiled and kissed my hair, holding onto me until I fell to sleep. I was laying there with Don in the same place when a loud noise tore thru my sleep and caused us both to jolt upright. His father threw a football towards us and Don slapped it away. \"Dad, what the hell.\" \"Come on, sweetie. He can't catch a damn ball why do you think you can hold on to him?\" His words slurred as Don got up and pushed him out of the room. \"Dad, shut up. You're still drunk, Dad, and you need to leave-\" \"Don't tell me what to do! You can't catch a ball!\" His father slapped him and Don just stepped back, just standing there as his father yelled at him. Something told me this was common. Maybe even why Don acts the way he does. Maybe even the reason why he drinks…and brings girls home. This must be why he says he's not a keeper. He feels worthless. All because of his father. And for what? Because he can't catch a ball? There are more important things in life. Don shook his head as his father finally gave up and walked out of the room. He looked back at me then back at the door. \"Let me take you home.\" I sat there on the bed for a moment before nodding and walking out with him ","Summary":" Goals. Friday Night Lights.

We all have our moments, our sad days, our grey skies, yet for everyone it is different. Everyone has a different life, and it's never the same. Some people have a life where nothing goes wrong. They are well behaved and everyone who sees them always wants that type of a child in their household. Others? Well, some people have people in their lives who are mean and abusive. It just all depends really, on who you talk to. There's a family who's life isn't perfect. They have their moments where they will argue about things such as the young ones in the house not doing their homework or staying up past their bedtime, or the parents will argue over what needs to be done in order for the family to have their basic needs like food, or clothes, or whatever it is that needs to be in the house. The father of the house is a very special man. His name: Elliot. When Elliot was a young boy, he discovered something quite amazing. He found a lost extraterrestrial which he named it E.T. E.T had wandered off from his kind while they were exploring but didn't make it back in time. They took off and left him here on Earth. Elliot found him and became friends with the little alien, but soon E.T got very sick. Everyone thought that he was going to die, but no. Elliot knew he had to make it out alive so he could bring his friend home. Luckily, that happened. E.T finally got better and headed back to his home, but saying good-bye was hard on poor Elliot. He knew he had to let his friend go, but he didn't want him to leave. E.T put his finger out and touched Elliot on his heart and said: I'll be right here. Many years have gone by and now Elliot, the father of three kids, is now living his life with his wife. But, times have been hard. Elliot is having some trouble at work and his kids seem to be failing their classes. His wife is having a smoking problem, smoking more than one cigarette every day for a month now and it's making her very grumpy. She takes it out on everybody! One night, Elliot sat outside on his porch on the swing, rocking back and forth just thinking about all the troubling stuff that's been happening. Then he started to cry. As he did so, he began to speak to himself. \"Everything is going wrong. I wish my kids would do better in school, I wish work wasn't so hard, I wish my wife didn't have to smoke! This is not how I wanted my life to go!\" Just then, he heard a voice. \"Ouch?\" it said. Elliot looked up to see...a familiar face staring back at him. Elliot's eyes filled with joy as his old friend, E.T, walked up to him (more like wobbled) and gave him a hug. \"E.T!\" cried Elliot. \"You're here! Why?\" E.T smiled. \"Came to explore,\" he said in his croaky voice. \"But I heard pain. Elliot, your eyes are leaking.\" Elliot laughed. \"It's crying. Don't you remember? I was crying the day you left,\" he replied. Then his face began to fill up with sadness. \"Oh, E.T. Everything's going wrong. I'm sad. My heart is hurting.\" He put a hand on his chest. E.T placed his hand on Elliot's and said \"ouch\". Elliot nodded. \"Ouch,\" he replied. E.T gave Elliot another hug but this time they didn't let go. Elliot felt warm and relieved that his best friend had come back. He didn't want him to go. E.T said, \"I'll be right here.\" As the warmth fell over him, he closed his eyes. When he opened them, he was lying in bed, his wife next to him. As he looked over, he heard a voice: \"I'll be right here.\" He sighed and smiled. He was glad that dream happened and knew his life was going to be better. ","Summary":" It may seem as if everything is perfect, but deep down, nothing ever is.

Ele estava coberto de lençóis e cobertores até o queixo para proteger seu antigo corpo frágil contra o ar frio do inverno que sempre encontrou o seu caminho através das menores fendas através de toda a sua casa grande e se espalha para os quartos espaçosos. estava lá, ele olhou para muitas fotografias emolduradas que decoravam suas quatro paredes e sua escrivaninha e armário em frente a ele. [...] Assim que o pensamento de Elliot se encheu de memórias de E.T., ele começou a desejar que ele pudesse vê-lo novamente agora, mesmo que fosse apenas para dizer adeus. Ele começou a fechar os olhos então, mas quase tão rapidamente eles abriram novamente, assim que ele começou a ver uma série de luzes amarelas, azuis a rosas reunidas em um canto de seu quarto. Em seguida, as luzes começaram a envolver-se e começar a tomar uma forma. Logo a forma transformou-se na figura do próprio ET. Ele ficou no quarto de Elliot parecendo exatamente como do momento em que ele o tinha visto pela primeira vez aos 10 anos de idade [...] Elliot estava coberto com quase tantas rugas quanto ET e ele também quase não tinha mais cabelo do que E.T., e seus dedos eram da mesma forma tão longos, finos e ossudos. Mas, ao mesmo tempo, Elliot se sentiu como o mesmo menino esperto e curioso que havia conhecido E.T. 95 anos atrás. Pois ele nunca havia perdido aquele jeito esperto e curioso de olhar o mundo por causa do E.T. e os seus ensinamentos sobre a vida, o amor, e o Universo. [...] E.T. sorriu e, assim que veio até ele, descansou as mãos sobre as colchas de Elliot. \"Elliot ...\" começou solenemente. \"Eu ouvi o seu desejo, como eu sempre ouvi os seus desejos ... e eu fui capaz de ser transportado para cá, como tão poucos da minha raça tem o privilégio de fazer, apenas aqueles que conseguiram um grande feito de proporções cósmicas\", acrescentou ao último dizer com humildade de proporções cósmicas. \"E.T. ..\" Elliot disse lentamente. \"Acredito que meu tempo na Terra está prestes a chegar ao seu fim.\" E.T. assentiu com um sorriso triste. \"Isso é verdade, e eu não posso fazer nada a respeito disso. Pois embora eu possa curar as feridas e algumas doenças não têm nada em você que precisa ser curado neste momento, já que seu tempo estava escrito nas estrelas muito antes de você nascer, assim como o meu. Embora o meu é milhões de anos distante do seu. Na verdade, seu tempo de vida é apenas uma pulsação do meu próprio. \" Lágrimas encheram os grandes olhos de ET até os cantos assim que ele disse isso com profundos pesar e tristeza. Elliot voltou expressão do ET e depois disse: \"ET, há algo que eu sempre quis perguntar-lhe, e penso que agora é o momento para isso. Você sabe o que acontece depois que morremos?\" E.T. pareceu que tivesse acabado de ser perguntado sobre algo de proporções cósmicas, o que ele realmente tinha sido. Ainda assim, ele respondeu a ela com honestidade franca. \"Para o meu conhecimento e a compreensão do Universo e da forma como ele funciona, quando nossa hora chega ao fim e os nossos corpos se deterioram e apodrecem até o pó, a nossa essência vital, o que nos faz quem nós éramos quando vivos, é liberto e vai à fonte da qual tudo se originou, aquela da qual o próprio Universo foi criado. E essa essência vital vai a ela para ajudar a dar vida a coisas novas de todos os tipos, estrelas e planetas, e também outras criaturas, incluindo os outros seres humanos, e quanto mais antiga e vivaz energia for, mais cósmica pode transformar-se quando for liberta. É por isso que eu acredito que você e eu nunca poderiamos dizer adeus. \" [...] Ele estendeu a mão por debaixo das cobertas e agarrou na mão de ET. \"Espero que meus descendentes continuarão a conhecê-lo para o resto da sua vida, não importa quanto tempo isso pode ser\", disse ele. \"Eu acredito que eles vão\", disse o ET, apertando a mão de Elliot em retorno. \"E a nossa verdade nunca vai morrer, muito depois de você e eu ambos irmos, nossas essências sempre vão brilhar na luz do Universo.\" Elliot deu um sorriso feliz assim que continuou a segurar a mão do ET. Ele, então, de repente sentiu um pouco de calor surgir assim que ET tinha acendido o dedo indicador e sentiu a luz dele percorrer através de seu corpo e mente, iluminando-o completamente com energia extática [...]. Então E.T. assistiu a um sorriso triste e ainda serenamente amoroso sorriso à medida que o ainda sorridente rosto de Elliot relaxar-se em uma expressão de paz eterna e os olhos dele fecharam e seu último suspiro escapou-lhe e sua mão perdeu a força. E.T. delicadamente deitou a mão de Elliot em seu peito que estava envolvido pelos cobertores. E então ele olhou para cima e para a janela atrás dele para as estrelas brilhantes no céu à noite e pensou que agora pareciam estar brilhando muitomais do que ele já tinha visto em sua longa vida, agora que ganhou uma nova energia para as suas luzes . E.T. deu um sorriso amargo damesma forma que deixou suas lágrimas iualmente amargas descerem o rosto em pequenos rios através de suas feições enrugadas e murmurou: \"E então ... a sua essência vive para sempre.\" ","Summary":" O ÚLTIMO ADEUS Elliot Taylor estava na cama com a idade de cento e cinco anos de idade.

He was covered in sheets and blankets up to his chin to protect his frail ancient body against the chill winter air that always found its way through the smallest cracks throughout his large house and drift into the spacious rooms. As he lay there he gazed at the many framed photographs that decorated his four walls and his desk and dresser across from him. Each picture was of a precious memory of his life gone by. Pictures of family, of his mother and father, brother and sister, and stepfather, and later on of his late wife who he had for seventy years and their four children of two boys and two girls who were now all adults with families of their own. Pictures of his grandchildren and more recent great-grandchildren took up the ends. Mixed in these pictures of the people closest to him were also pictures and mementos of the most important events in his life. Such as fliers and and articles that announced his many great achievements as a scientist and botanist, included were ones from the year he'd won his Nobel prize for discovering a new solar system where intelligent life was found living on a planet in it, and also various prizes and collectibles from his trips around the world. He had seen nearly every corner of the world on his expeditions including Africa, Asia, South America, and Europe. He smiled contentedly as he looked back on all those years gone by. He had lived his life well, full of love and adventure and excitement, and now the years were taking their toll on his body and he hadn't been able to get out of bed for a year and a half now. He knew for certain his time was nearly up now, and he was filled with pride and pleasure that he was able to leave this world behind without any regrets or things left unsaid or undone. If given the chance to live his life over he would change not a single thing of it. As his mind wandered from these thoughts, his eyes were attracted to the framed pictures on his bedside table right beside of him. They were pictures of him and the people he loved the most with another being who he loved more than anyone or anything, E.T.. The love he had for E.T. was a different kind of love than he had for any other person or creature, it was a love that transcended all earthly boundaries, and perhaps even the boundaries of his heart if it were possible. If E.T. hadn't come into his life when he did the first time, he was sure he would have gone down a dark road, in fact not just him but all of the people around him who were in his life both before and after E.T. had come. E.T. had touched the lives of so many people during his many trips to Earth. He was sure E.T. had saved him during those various times in every way that a person can be saved, and in return he had also saved him just as many times. As Elliot's thought filled with memories of E.T. he began wishing he could see him again now, if only just to say goodbye. He began to close his eyes then, but almost as quickly they opened wide again as he began to see a series of brilliant yellow, blue, and pink lights gathering in a corner of his room. Then the lights began to envelop each other and start to take on a shape. Soon that shape transformed into the figure of E.T. himself. He stood in Elliot's room looking exactly as he had from the moment he had first seen him when he was ten years old. A grin lighted Elliot's face as E.T. waddled slowly up to his bedside. E.T. smiled serenely as his heart light began to glow a faint ruby red glow, a glow that seemed to reach his huge ocean blue eyes which held the wisdom of billions of years old. Elliot was now covered with almost as many wrinkles as E.T. was and he also had hardly any more hair than E.T. did, and his fingers were just as long, thin and bony. Yet at the same time Elliot felt like the same bright and inquisitive ten-year-old boy who had met E.T. ninety-five years ago. For he had never lost that bright and inquisitive outlook of the world because of E.T. and his teachings about life, love, and the Universe. \"E... T... You've... come... back!\" Elliot said in a slow gravelly voice similar to E.T.'s own voice. E.T. smiled and as he came up to him he rested his hands onto Elliot's bed-covers. \"Elliot...\" he began solemnly. \"I heard your wish, as I have always heard your wishes... and I was able to be transported here as so few of my race are privileged to do, only those who have achieved a great deed of comic proportions,\" he added the last with humbleness of cosmic proportions. \"E.T...\" Elliot said slowly. \"I believe my time on this Earth is about to come to its end.\" E.T. nodded with a sad smile. \"That is true, and I can do nothing about it at all. For though I can heal wounds and some sickness you have nothing in you which needs to be healed at this time, as your time was written in the stars long before you were born as was mine. Although mine is millions of years away from yours. In truth, your lifetime is but a heartbeat of my own.\" Tears brimmed E.T.'s great orb-like eyes at the corners as he said this with deep sorrow and regret. Elliot returned E.T.'s expression and then said, \"E.T., there is something I've always wanted to ask you, and I think that now is the time for it. Do you know about what happens after we die?\" E.T. looked as if he had just been asked something of cosmic proportions, which he truly had been. Though he replied to it with frank honesty. \"To my knowledge and understanding of the Universe and the way it works, when our time comes to an end and our bodies deteriorate and decay into dust, our living essence, that which makes us who we were when we lived is released and goes into the source from which all things originated, that which the Universe itself was created from. And that living essence goes into it to help to bring life to new things of all kinds, stars, and planets, and also other creatures including other humans, and the older more vivacious the energy of it is the more cosmic it can become when its released. So that is why I believe you and I could never really say goodbye.\" Elliot smiled as E.T.'s words had filled him with hope and comfort. There was still one thing though. \"Will I be conscious when my living essence departs from my body?\" he asked. \"No, I don't think so,\" replied E.T.. \"That's what I thought,\" admitted Elliot. Then he asked, \"You've died before, haven't you, and come back to life? Was that because it wasn't your time then?\" \"No, it was not my time then,\" said E.T.. \"Though from the information I gathered from my fellows who were on board our ship coming for me at the time, I believe I came back because they had combined their heart lights, that which contains our living essence of love and goodness, and sent their energy from them to me, although I also believe that you gave a helping hand in it also.\" \"I did? But how?\" asked Elliot. \"I was regaining my consciousness while you were speaking to me. I was only semi-conscious at the time, but I heard and felt within my heart that was being reignited your love for me which was of cosmic proportions and it gave an added strength to the love and energy already filling me from my companions heart lights and so I was healed thoroughly in body and in heart and that was how I returned to living. Because you are a very rare kind of human who feels empathy for others and have a heart light of your very own, although it may not be as bright as mine to look at it as present as mine anyways.\" Elliot smiled at this revelation to him. He reached out his hand from underneath the covers and clutched onto E.T.'s hand. \"I hope my descendants will continue to know you for the rest of your lifetime, no matter how long it may be,\" he said. \"I believe they will,\" said E.T, squeezing Elliot's hand in return. \"And the truth of us will never die, long after you and I are both gone, our essences will forever shine light in the Universe.\" Elliot smiled a happy smile as he continued to hold onto E.T.'s hand. He then suddenly felt a small bit of warmth light up as E.T. had lit his forefinger and he felt the light of it course through his body and mind, enlightening him thoroughly with ecstatic energy and he knew right then that E.T. was quite right that he did indeed have a heart light like his. Then E.T. watched a sad, yet serenely loving smile as Elliot's still smiling face relaxed itself into an expression of eternal peacefulness and his eyes closed and his last breath escaped from him and his hand lost its grip on his own. E.T. gently laid Elliot's and down on his chest that was covered by the blankets. And then he looked up and over at the window behind him at the stars glittering in the night sky and thought that they now seemed to be shining even more than he had ever seen in his long life now that they had gained new energy for their lights. E.T. smiled a bittersweet smile as he let his equally bittersweet tears flow down his face in tiny rivers through his wrinkled features and he murmured, \"And so... his essence lives on forevermore.\" ","Summary":" Elliot Taylor lay in his bed at the age of one-hundred-and-five years old.

She had just recently caught the flu as it was the season for it. She was too sick to go to school for a while, which she usually wouldn't have minded except that today her class would be going on a field trip to the Planetarium and she had really anticipated the trip as she had a great interest in the Solar System and she had also heard there were glow in the dark star stickers there. It's not fair! She complained inwardly. Of all the times to get the flu! She was interested in learning about space stuff because only a year ago she and her siblings Michael and Elliot had met with a gentle extra-terrestrial being whom they called E.T. and in the process of helping him to get back to his home planet they had all grown closer together as though a missing gap had been filled by him. She thought about how E.T. must have seen every corner of not just their solar system but every one there was in the whole universe as he had the means to travel to them in his spaceship and he was a botanist who studied all forms of plant life. She remembered E.T.'s last visit last Christmas and wished she had been able to take a ride in his spaceship with him then and see the sights of the Universe. Come to think of it, she wished she could see E.T. again right now so she could do so. Knowing wishing wouldn't make anything happen she closed her eyes and tried to fall asleep. Then, almost as soon as she did so, she was abruptly wide awake when she heard strange music filling her room, and then she began to see shapes of light dancing across the walls. They were so brightly dizzying she turned away from them, and then she heard an odd kind of gasp like air breathing through a hole that had just been ripped out. She looked back again, and there was E.T. himself sitting on the foot of her bed. His face wore an expression that was both very wise and very sweet. \"Hello, Gertie,\" he said in an equally wise and sweet voice.\" \"Hello, E.T.,\" said Gertie, smiling in spite of her fever. \"How did you get here like that?\" \"Through a wormhole,\" E.T. replied simply. \"What's a wormhole?\" asked Gertie with confusion. \"You will know soon enough,\" replied E.T.. \"I have come to you like this as I heard your wish in the stars and I have come to make it come true.\" \"But how?\" asked Gertie. \"I can't get out of bed because I'm sick.\" \"I know,\" said E.T.. \"But you won't be really leaving your bed as we will travel through astral projection.\" \"What is that?\" asked Gertie confused again. \"It is when your mind travels beyond your body's capacity through space and time while you remain physically in the same place all the while,\" E.T. explained as simply as he could. Gertie still didn't understand what he meant. \"But how is that possible?\" she asked. E.T. smiled. \"Just take my hand and you will see.\" He held out his hand which had the glowing forefinger and Gertie took hold of it. Then all at once she felt as if her sickness were leaving her body and then she could feel herself rising from under the bed covers. Still clutching onto E.T.'s hand she floated up in the air with him and together they soared up to the ceiling and went through the roof. They ventured up into the blue sky and went above the atmosphere, higher and higher, until they could see they were leaving the Earth very far behind them. When the Earth looked like nothing more than a tiny blueberry floating in space Gertie looked away from it and looking straight ahead she gasped at the unbelievable sight before her. She saw endless space stretched out before her with seemingly billions of stars sewn into it in great clusters of bright pinpoints of light ranging in many sizes and shapes. \"E.T., it's so beautiful up here!\" she exclaimed breathlessly. \"This is just the beginning,\" E.T. said with a smile. \"Just look below you and you will see the star that is closest to your home. Gertie felt a bit confused and then she looked below her and saw a gigantic bright yellow ball that was giving off beams of light so brilliant she knew she would have been blinded by them if she weren't outside of her body right now. It also had many black spots covering many places of it in all sizes and shapes. Then suddenly what seemed to be an explosion of fire radiated off of it. Looking down from it she saw three tiny round balls rotating slowly around it. Then the realization of what it was suddenly came to her. \"It's the sun!\" she exclaimed in awe. \"You mean the sun is a star?\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said E.T. \"It just looks so much bigger than the other stars because it is the closest one to you. Now why don't we go down for a closer look at the inner planets.\" Then they whooshed down in front of the first planet from the sun which was called Mercury. It was a small planet though of course it looked enormous to their eyes up close. It was a huge ball of a light golden color having been baked in the sun's fierce radiation and was covered with cracks and craters. They flew further down the circle around the sun and saw the second planet called Venus. It was a huge ball covered with thick swirling white and brown clouds that moved with what appeared to be the force of a hurricane so that the planet's appearance was always changing. \"It looks less beautiful underneath the clouds,\" said E.T.. \"It is burning and boiling because of it's greenhouse atmosphere. Yours and my race are working to make sure your home doesn't end up like it. Here is your home coming up now. It is one of the most beautiful planets I have ever seen, I must admit, and I have seen billions.\" Gertie could really see what he meant as they flew past the Earth in all of its beauty and splendor with its pure blue oceans with light brown chunks of land in-between them with whirling and swirling milky white clouds strewn all over it. Next they flew further down the circle and came up to the fourth planet called Mars. It was a big reddish orange ball with great purplish spots on its polar ends. \"Your two neighboring planets used to be supportable for life way back in their beginning, but then they changed for the worst,\" E.T. said. \"One got hotter and one got colder because of their sizes and the way in which their atmosphere was formed. This unfortunately happens to many other planets in the Universe.\" \"Then how did Earth end up being the only planet to support life in our solar system?\" asked Gertie curiously. \"The best I can put it is because it was in the right place at the right time for a series of random events to occur to form it to the right approximations for yours and other species. Although I have seen many planets with life forms that live in all kinds of different atmospheres, though you must always know how lucky you are to be living on such a singled out world.\" They were by now flying into the outer reaches of the solar system where the outer planets dwelt. Coming up in front of them they saw the fifth planet called Jupiter. It was the biggest planet in the solar system, a massive floating ball made of gas that was dark orange in color with white stripes strewn over it. \"Jupiter is called a brown dwarf because if a bit more mass was added to it would transform into a star and be a yellow dwarf,\" E.T. said. Next they flew up to the sixth planet called Saturn. It was a somewhat smaller and slightly crooked yellow planet with hundreds of rings of solid ice and rock chunks floating around it which gave it a most majestic appearance. They the flew up to the seventh planet called Uranus. It was also a crooked planet having been knocked on its side and also had a few less visible rings around it. It was a light bluing green in color. Next the flew up to the eighth planet called Neptune. It was the of the deepest, darkest, most brilliant and vibrant blue color that could ever be imagined. Gertie was in awe of this giant blue beauty with what looked like a large and somewhat deeper blue eye shaped spot in the middle of it. They flew onward farther and farther into the deeper reaches of space. After a little while they began to see a tiny round object shining far ahead in the distance. It was the ninth planet which was called Pluto. Flying up in front of it they saw it was very much like small dirty snowball floating in space with its single and even tinier moon called Charon right up in front of it almost touching it. \"That was an amazing voyage, E.T.,\" said Gertie. \"I never would have imagined I could see the planets of our solar system up so close!\" \"Our view of the solar system is not quite over yet,\" E.T. said with a sly smile. \"Look out there up ahead!\" Gertie did so, confused at first, and then she saw something shining up ahead in the farthest distance. As they came closer to it she realized to her great shock and delight that it was a planet and none other than the tenth planet in the solar system. \"I thought there were only none planets in our solar system!\" Gertie exclaimed in disbelief. \"That is only how many your teachers know of right now,\" E.T. explained. \"But in an estimated twenty to thirty years your race should have the telescopic technology to see it and give it a name.\" \"And I got to see it before anyone else did!\" Gertie exclaimed ecstatically. \"Now would you like me to show you more of what lies beyond your home?\" asked E.T.\" \"Yes, please!\" exclaimed Gertie very eagerly. Then the next thing she knew they were flying towards a great spiraling circle of blue and white with a bright orange-yellow ball of light at the center of it. \"What is that up ahead?\" asked Gertie. \"It is the Milky Way,\" E.T. explained. \"It is made of many clusters of stars that lead to many other solar systems. Hold on tight to me now because we're in for quite a ride!\" No sooner had he spoken then they began whooshing and whirling amongst the stars in the Milky Way with the speed and force of a shooting star. Gertie clutched tightly to E.T.'s hand and screamed with ecstatic laughter as she felt herself being thrust forward at all of the most magnificent sights that spread out before them. She saw thousands upon thousands of tiny stars that gave off blue, yellow, orange, and purple lights all swimming in an endless river of a thick white cloud-like substance which blended over to brownish orange at the edges. The further they went into it the more colorful and vibrant the river of stars became. It was now a swirling and twirling myriad of yellow, orange, white, blue, and purple clouds embedded with tiny flecks of rainbow colored specks of light. As they zoomed out of it she saw the stars of blue, white, yellow, and orange being sheltered by a thin blue misty substance. Then they flew onward and she saw more misty clouds of pink, gold, yellow, white, and orange floating and swirling all around them. They found themselves swimming aerially through a thick ocean of pale blue clouds sewn together with threads of gold and yellow and orange, always intertwining together in an endless chasm of spectacular lights and colors. They flew out of it and entered into another myriad of wonders. There were smoky cloud swirls of green, red, pink, blue, and purple all over everything and shining through them were bright purple stars. They then flew through a thick ocean of green and white clouds and came out the other end and into a new view of dark fiery red and orange mist floating amongst trillions of tiny white glowing stars. They flew deeper and deeper into it and found themselves in a long cosmic rainbow of red, orange, blue, and purple with all the colors blending and swirling together endlessly. As they flew further up it they saw how it changed colors in a zigzag of yellows, greens, and violets. They zoomed out of the rainbow and flew forward into a what seemed like a great spider web of cosmic proportions. It was streaked in many shades of light and lighter green and pale yellow and white with pink dots covering the middle and blue and red dots lining the outside of it. They flew in every direction all around the web of stars and cosmic clouds. First in swirling pink and yellow and then in swirling green and yellow. They flew into and out of a thick ocean of pink and red and violet misty clouds. Then they were in clear space with what looked like another cosmic rainbow only it had somewhat the shape of a dragon head and tail in swirling lines of yellow, orange, red, green, violet, and blue. It didn't resemble any painting Gertie had ever seen and yet it was so much more beautiful than what any paintbrush could ever do. They flew on and saw many shapeless cloud formations in mountains of pink, brown, yellow, white, and gold everywhere. To Gertie it looked like mountains of lopsided rainbow colored cotton candy and ice cream. Then they flew onward again and came to another swirling spiral of star clusters, only this one was all pure white and had a pale yellow middle. They zoomed into it and saw it's stars and clouds close up in all their whitish purple, and gray green glory. Then they zoomed outward again and came upon a most celestial sight of great dark gray and brown clouds against pure light blue ones with great pink stars bursting their light through them which turned them into shades of green and white and orange. They flew outward and saw mountains upon mountains of cosmic clouds that were peaked by the stars above them. Then as they whooshed into one of them they saw a pure blue atmosphere emblazoned by swarms of tiny white and pink and yellow tipped baby clouds. They reminded Gertie of popcorn with different colored toppings on it. They then flew out of the clouds and into a whole new view of swirling white light that blended into rays of pale pink, blue, yellow, and orange against empty space that was being lit up from black to blue as they watched. Clouds began rising up around them like great puffs of colored smoke of pink and violet. They flew into the river of lights and seemed to be washing away in a great waterfall of read, orange, and white clouds. They flew out of the clouds and zoomed up into a swirling blueish green mist that was surrounded by lighter and thicker yellow ones and embedded by gleaming stars of pink lights. They then came upon more mountains made of colorful clouds, only these were higher than any mountain on Earth. E.T. held tightly to Gertie's hand as he flew with her up the highest mountain's slope. They swooshed and zigzagged along its many dips, dives, and points. Then when they reached the highest height of it they found the biggest and brightest white star which was surround in a blazing pink glow. Gertie felt she could almost reach out and touch it. They whooshed off of the mountain's peak and off into space once again. They flew past many clouds of smoky mist of blues, grays, yellows, oranges, reds, blues, and violets. Then E.T. began suddenly speeding up and said, \"Now there is something extra special that I wish to show to you.\" Then they zoomed past zillions of stars and clouds in a tremendous rushing of colors and fusions. Then when they at last came to a stop they were in the middle of a great black space shrouded in many golden stars. At the center they could see that one star was pulsating and glowing a vibrantly fierce reddish orange glow. Then before they could blink it broke itself apart in all directions sending great flames of yellow, orange, and red everywhere. A huge ball of white was in its place and as they watched it grew larger and larger and then it began swirling and whirling in all directions as it turned colors of brown, blue, yellow, and purple. It then seemed to create a strong gale of wind that was drawing in many objects around it and sucking them into it. Then all of the stuff that was filling it up seemed to be making heavier and bigger than ever. Then suddenly it began to stop drawing stuff in and began turning all different colors and began spreading outward and then the white light in the center of it was now very small though it was noticeably growing brighter and bigger every second. Then it seemed to explode in on itself. When the explosion vanquished and all the dust and debris had cleared away, they saw before them a giant massive ball of the purest and lightest yellow light that could ever be seen. \"What you have just witnessed,\" E.T. explained to Gertie. \"Is an event that is one of the greatest wonders and mysteries of the Universe. A star being born from another star's death. Though somehow I feel I can understand it better than many having experienced something similar to of my own.\" His heart light then began to glow a ruby glowing light. \"I will return you now to your home,\" he said. Then they zoomed outward again and found what looked like a giant tunnel of electricity in the shape of an immense worm and flew straight into it. Then a few dizzying moments later Gertie found herself in her own solar system again and floating down to Earth again. They flew down into the atmosphere and went down through the roof of Gertie's bedroom and Gertie then found herself floating down onto her bed again. She sat up and looked at E.T. \"Thank you for giving me the ride of my life,\" she said. \"The Planetarium sure would have been boring compared to all the things I just saw.\" E.T. smiled and replied, \"There is still so much more of the Universe to be seen, and even I have yet to see it all.\" ","Summary":" Gertie lay in her bed propped up on double pillows and covered up to her chin in blankets.

It was so dark and so endless, the stars within it were the only specks of light. All around me there was darkness, the darkness I could see though didn't compare to the darkness I felt within my chest where my heart light used to be. Inside I felt so unbearably cold and empty as I continued to stare up at the black sky. Suddenly I heard Elliot speak. \"We have to go now, E.T.,\" he said. \"We're so late already.\" I knew it was late, but I couldn't leave. I remained still in my spot... just searching... Searching for a signal... for some sign that my companions... my planet... could hear me... that they would come here and find me before it was too late. But I could see absolutely no sign, the more I searched the less I could find and the deeper the void within me grew. Elliot stood in front of me. \"We have to go home now... hmm?\" My home was not here. It was far away from here. Beyond the moon, beyond the stars, beyond the milky way... it was so far away... it seemed it was out of reach, in spite of the transmitter I had built which was still buzzing and humming with activity. Perhaps they were too far away for me to reach and my hopes and my efforts to make contact with them were all in vain. \"You should give them some time,\" Elliot said, as if he were sensing my thoughts in the moment. I had no idea how much time I had left in me. The light in my heart had completely gone out the moment I had lost my connection with my companions, and since then I had become weaker with each passing hour I was on this foreign planet with its terribly polluted atmosphere, and extra gravity which was closing in on me constantly. I knew I couldn't possibly have much time left in me, and then I'd be lost forever from my home and from my beloved family. Slowly I placed my hand to my chest where it was as dark as everything around me. \"Ouch...\" I muttered. I had learned this word was used to express pain when Elliot had cut his finger which I at once healed for him, though I could not heal myself, I needed my companions to heal me if anything could heal the constant terrible aching I was feeling inside of my chest. I wanted to cry, but the tears just wouldn't come and I didn't know if it was because of how cold I was, or because my eyes were already sore from staring so much. Once again Elliot spoke as if he were sensing my thoughts. \"You can stay with me, E.T.,\" he said with tears in his voice, almost pleading me. \"You could be happy here... I can take care of you... I'd never let anybody hurt you... We can grow up together, E.T.\" Be happy here? I could never be happy here. This planet could never be like my home planet. It was quite true I loved Elliot, but still nothing could ever replace the love and completeness I felt for my companions and our home, the Green Planet and all of the beautiful and wonderful plants that grew there which we took care of. I yearned so much now for my heart to light up again, to feel the warmth, love, and joy it brought to me as it was radiated from my companions. But all I could feel was total empty darkness, and I felt so very cold and numb inside of my chest, I could feel my breathing and my heartbeat beginning to weaken. \"Home... home...\" I muttered, it was all I knew how to say what I was so intensely longing for, and missing, and needing, and also what I couldn't find in all of the darkness as I continued staring up at the black sky just searching... searching for a way to find my home, my light, my soul... I began to feel tears running from my eyes, then I glanced downward and I saw Elliot sitting down beside me with tears silently trickling down his cheeks. The aching in my chest increased as I realized he was suffering because of me, my pain was becoming his pain. If anything, I didn't want for him to suffer with me. I cared so much about him, I loved him. It was like the love I felt for my companions, and yet it was also a different kind of love. I slowly reached out and wiped away his tears with the tips of my fingers. I watched as he looked up at me. I smiled gently, not that there was much to smile about, but I did not want to see Elliot suffering or in tears like he was now. He had given me so much in such a short time, had given me Reese's Pieces, had cared about me when I was all alone, had taught me new things, and most importantly had shown me human beings were really gentle beings. I tenderly stroked the side of his face. I knew I'd never forget him and I'd tell everyone at home about him... if I did go home. I looked up into the sky again and still I could see nothing but darkness amidst the stars and constellations. I swallowed as I could feel a terrible pang of loneliness overwhelm me completely. It was no use, I felt. They would never come for me. Never. They had given up on me. They think I'm already gone... and I wished I was so this terrible torrent of loneliness would be gone as well. \"Home...\" I tried to hold back the sobs that were pushing upward from the hollow of my chest and into my throat, but then the tears filled my eyes, blurring my vision so I could no longer see any stars at all, only utter darkness and I was all alone. \"Home...\" I cried. I let the tears cascade down my face and my neck. It was just the worst feeling of all, it was completely unimaginable. The feeling was of being gone and yet still being alive and I just desperately wanted it all to end. The hurt, the pain, the torment, the anguish. I wanted it to go away, to just leave me in peace. I moaned and wailed in hopelessness. The light of my heart, of my soul, was just gone out forever I could tell. There was nothing left inside of me, there was just emptiness and darkness, all of the colors were diminished. I never knew it was possible for my heart light to actually go out before now, I thought it was impossible. Now it seemed I was beginning to forget what it was like when my heart light was on. \"H..h..ho..ooo...oom..mmm!\" I choked on my sobs and swallowed my tears which were unbearably bitter tasting. Then I suddenly felt a pair of gentle arms reach out and embrace me. I collapsed into Elliot's arms and rested my head onto his shoulder as I bawled. Elliot sat down and rocked me and stroked me almost as if I were a infant As Elliot held me I began to calm down, somehow the feeling of having his arms around me brought me peace and less suffering, and it rather warmed both me and him against the chilliness of the night air. So I clung tightly to him and to the cloak he was wearing. Shortly afterward I came to realize he had fallen asleep in my arms. I listened to the sounds within the stillness of the night, and soon I began to hear the thick, raspy sound of my breathing and also a weak thudding from within my chest. I knew, of course, what these meant. My time was almost over with. I sighed deeply as I slowly, gently, disentangled myself from Elliot's embrace. I looked at him briefly in the faint light of the moon. I remembered when, just hours ago, we had been sailing freely through the stars and above the tree tops on his bicycle. It was such a magical, beautiful, wonderful memory and I hoped he would always remember it along with me, long after I was gone. I knew I had to leave him. How my heart ached to have to leave him alone here in the woods, but then when the morning came he would find only my lifeless body lying beside of him anyway and I believed that would be much worse. My only hope now was that in the morning he would awaken and find his way home, and maybe he would then remember me as only a passing dream. I turned around and began to slowly trudge away from the clearing in the forest with the tips of my fingers dragging slowly on the ground. I no longer had strength to cry, and I was feeling weaker and weaker every minute. I stumbled on rocks and fallen tree branches as I trudged along. I could feel the air in my lungs evaporating quickly, and my heartbeat faltering very rapidly. I didn't know how much longer I could go on. My vision was beginning to blur, though I could see there was a small stream of water a little way up ahead of me. I remembered how much I loved water, to relax in it as I refreshed myself, in body and in spirit. I crawled weakly up to the stream and laid down in it. I instantly felt the soothing sensation of the clear, cool water. I didn't think I would live for much longer, but I loved the water so much I felt I'd like to just pass away right here within it, for it was such a peaceful and soothing way to go. The water seemed to be sustaining my body, but it could do nothing for my spirit, for it was as much without light as the empty darkness of the very furthest depths of the galaxy. My breathing became more and more labored and harsh with every second. I could no longer move at all. I had lost all feeling of my whole body and in place there was a rigid and cold numbing sensation everywhere. The pain within my chest became very physical and very agonizing, it grew intensely and spread through my whole body, all the way to the tips of my fingers. Weakly, the ends of my eyelids opened when a sudden sound startled me. I could just barely see straight, but I could still see that the first rays of dawn were beginning to light the horizon above me now. Then, from the corner of my eye I saw how my once dark brown skin was vastly turning a sickly shade of white, it seemed to represent my complete loss of energy and strength as well as signify my life leaving my body. I began to try to imagine what would happen after I was gone. Would my soul leave my emptied body and descend once again into the cosmos? Would I be united with my ancestors of my planet, whom had lived long before Botanicus? Would there be light and stars and peacefulness? Or would I be in nothing but eternal nothingness, just as I was now. Just a lifeless organism forever drifting in the water and soil. The worst thing of all was this was all my own fault. If only I had paid more attention to my captain. If only I hadn't wandered so far away from my companions. If only I hadn't looked at those lights... There were so many if onlys. \"E.T.!\" I heard a voice in the distance call out. \"E.T.!\" \"No!\" Suddenly I was aware there was someone bending over me, I could hear him breathing quickly, I could feel him laying a hand on my ice cold chest. Weakly opening my eyes I saw it was... Michael... Elliot's big brother, as he called him. I was so relieved to see him, and yet I was at the same time very distressed. I wanted to just be left alone here to die a peacefully sad death. But I was unfortunately unable to let him know this as I felt him tenderly wrapping me in a thin white sheet, and then tucking me into the basket of his bicycle. After the bumpy ride, he picked me up and carried me inside to his house. He took me into a white room which I could just vaguely remember being in before. He laid me down on the floor, and then I suddenly could feel another human hand take hold of my own and tightly clutch it. I recognized it at once as being Elliot's hand. I gazed into his gentle face and I saw how pale he was now, and his eyes held a very tired and bleak expression, and yet within his lifeless features I could still see something which I had seen from the moment he led me into his home, compassion. His hand which held my own was just as cold and damp, and the only strength I could feel from it was the radiation of his love for me. I could vaguely hear the two humans speaking to each other, I could easily tell it was about me and my condition. Then I saw Michael leave, and Elliot remained where he was. I could see he was suffering all because of me again. I didn't want him to, I never, ever did. I wished I could just take the pain and suffering away from him, and yet I knew I couldn't just as sure as I couldn't take it from myself. I continued to hold onto his hand, but I couldn't reassure him, it seemed like everything was worth nothing now. \"I'm... so sorry... E.T.,\" Elliot whispered beside of me. I couldn't understand what he could mean by that. He had never done anything to me, all he had done was care about me, and keep me sheltered from the rest of this strange, alien world. He had only done the best he could do for me. It wasn't his fault what was happening to me now. No, it was my fault. Everything was all my fault, and I knew that if I would actually escape from this black hole which was swallowing me up I could never forgive myself for causing Elliot so much trouble. I then felt the presence of more humans entering the room. I turned my head feebly to the left and I saw Michael in the doorway and also the tall and willowy human creature whom Elliot and his siblings referred to as Mom. I knew there must be a reason why they had brought her to me now and I gathered the very little strength I had in me and I reached out to her. \"We're sick... I think we're dying...\" Elliot muttered. \"M-oo-om-mmm...\" I croaked weakly. I saw the shocked and petrified look on her beautiful face, and I heard them all speaking in a jumbling of sounds which had little meaning to me. Then suddenly I saw the taller humans gathering the smaller ones in their arms, and I watched in agony as they ran out of the room. I tried to reach for them, but I couldn't. I could do nothing at all. I began to scream and cry out in all of the horror and agony as I was left all alone to die in this cold room. My shrieks echoed off of the walls around. I continued to cry out, not that it did any good at all, no one could hear me. Soon my whole throat ached horribly from crying and screaming and I stopped and just lay still gasping for air in this completely alien world. Then I suddenly heard the sound of new footsteps entering the room, and these were much bigger and heavier than the ones of those I was familiar with. Then as I turned my gaze upward weakly I could see three giant sized aliens clothed all in white with large round white heads with what appeared to be one big eye in the center and I could hear dreadful rasping sounds coming from them as I helplessly watched them come in, pick me up from the floor, and all of three of them carry me out in their thick, white arms to where I didn't know where, or wanted to know. Everything else then was all a blur as they laid me down on something, and I heard dozens of sounds, mostly from the white aliens as they poked and prodded at me, and stuck things into me which I knew nothing about. I was dying, I knew I was dying, I'd known it now for a long time. I was closer now than ever, I could tell because now not only was it agonizing me to move, or to speak, but it also hurt terribly to even try to breath. I was falling deeper and deeper into the black hole of despair and sadness and pain which had been created the moment the light of my heart had gone out and had left me in total darkness, just as a burnt out star does. \"E...T...\" I suddenly heard Elliot speak, and he sounded like he was almost as much at the point of death as I was. \"El..li..ot...\" I weakly choked out the sound of his name. Somehow just knowing he was close to me was a tremendous relief, like knowing nothing could really happen to me just as long as he right there with me. \"Stay with me, E.T...\" he murmured pleadingly, he seemed to be experiencing the same kind of feelings and the same suffering as I was. I knew I was being swallowed by the black hole inside of my very being, but was Elliot also being swallowed. No, he couldn't possibly be! The universe wouldn't be that cruel and unjust, would it? The universe could take me, but please spare Elliot, he doesn't deserve it. \"Stay... stay...\" I muttered almost mindlessly, pleading for him to stay with me. The word was new to me and yet I could still tell what it meant easily. \"I'll be right here...\" Elliot said with tenderness and reassurance. \"I'll be right here...\" He would be right there for me as I needed him to be. Then I lost all feeling and all thoughts of anything as everything within me and around went completely black. I'll never, ever, know exactly what happened next. It all seemed to happen in one instant. I felt as though I were floating through space and through time. I could see darkness, and then I could see light, very bright light, and I was flying directly into it. It was so warm and seemed to be beckoning to me and my once empty and pain filled little being was filled with its very essence and energy. The closer I drew to it, the brighter and more magnificent it became, and then it seemed I was actually right in the center of it and I felt happy, happy again. Then it seemed as if all of time and space were standing perfectly still as I felt so completely at peace, so completely at one with the universe... and then I heard voices. They all were voices I knew very well. \"E.T. Come home!\" \"Maybe if we wish really hard... he'll come back.\" \"I'll always believe in you, E.T, I love you.\" \"E.T... We are here... we received you're message... we miss you... we will come for you... we love you...\" I heard the clear, distinct voice of my captain and of my companions. Then I heard just one voice, Elliot's voice. \"E.T. I love you.\" Then all at once the light vanished and everything became still once again, and then suddenly I saw... and I felt... a burst of light and cosmic energy around me and inside of me. It was a ripping, searing, ecstatic, enticing, loving, joyful sensation which filled me wholly until I thought I might explode. I gasped as I awoke, and I shuddered, feeling suddenly warm and cool at the same time. I was still in darkness, and yet there was also a light, a very bright red, blazing light all around me. It was inside of me. \"E.T. phone home!\" I saw Elliot's face. His gentle, kind, innocent young face. He looked alive as I was again, and he looked happy and at the same time terrified as he cried out ecstatically. I knew it was because he was happy to see me again, just as I was. \"Elliot!\" I pronounced his name, enjoying the feeling of renewed love, energy, happiness, and life flowing through my being. It seemed a new life, like a newborn star, had ignited within the light of my heart and I had somehow been reborn. I was given a second chance. Elliot then noticed my heart light. He was finally able to see it for the first time. One of the many wonders of the universe. \"Does this mean they're coming?\" \"Yes!\" I said with renewed strength filling me once again. I had succeeded! I still didn't know what had just happened, but I did know one thing for sure! I was finally on my way home! \"E.T. phone home!\" ","Summary":" I stared up at the sky.

I went over and found a UFO which was no bigger than a fully grown adult hand. I decided to come back tomorrow. The next morning, I rushed to the spot where I found it. When it woke up, it started beeping. It sounded like it was something like a dill up connection. Then a sound, as if something failed, played. Then I stepped in and it prepared a laser. I talked it out of destroying me. I told it where I lived and he told me, \"Take me there. You must be wondering why I'm by myself. I'm not telling you.\" 'Hmm… ' I thought. \"Let's-a get-a going!\" it said. He sounded like Super Mario™. So I brought him home, my home, and the little UFO told me more about him. His name was Rover and he lived on the planet Zorb. We arrived at my home. He managed to make the houses into mansions. Everyone came out to see who did this. They saw Rover and thanked him. However, they decided to keep hush about this as it would only alarm the police. Rover had also inserted the information in to the public maps and services like Google® that this place was a mansion estate. Our house had a super computer in our house called 'Mr Smith'. Mr Smith could put stuff into the public media also. Then one day, Mr Smith went crazy and started doing nothing he was told. Our last resort was to pull out the fuses in the mains box. We then extracted the hard drive out of Mr Smith. It was tricky and dangerous. We put the fuses back in and 'The Empty Mr Smith' showed a 'No Hard Drive Inserted.' screen. We then plugged the hard drive into a PC and searched for a virus. We found it. It was a virus that attacks the DOS. Well guess what? We removed it. Well, what do you think the top-of-the-range virus safety software would advise us to do? Anyway, we placed the HDD back into Mr Smith and he restarted. He was functioning normally. \"Starting up...\" said the DOS Mr Smith. \"…\" said Mr Smith. \"You downloaded a virus.\" said Rover. \"It attacked the DOS.\" I said. \"…\" said Mr Smith. Jargon Buster D=Disk O=Operating S=System. Chapter 2 The Police As Jamie and Rover were doing nothing, Mr Smith came up with the news... \"Information: Unidentified Flying Object sighting has been confirmed… WARNING! DANGER! The police are outside THIS the door.\" 'H…e…l…p!' I thought. \"COME OUT OR WE WILL HAVE TO BASH YOUR DOOR DOWN!\" said the police. We were all scared out of our skins. \"One…\" said the police. 'Ohh…' I thought. \"TWO…\" Rover was primed. \"TTTHHHRRREEEE!\" 'Dear…' The police smashed through the door. Then there was an ear splitting boom! \"Information: There is no more danger.\" 'Well, what do you think Mr Smith. Rover has probably killed the lot.' I though. I ran downstairs and saw a cloud of steam and guess what? ROVER HAD ACUALLY VAPORIZED THE POLICE! 'If you weren't so violent I could hug you!' I thought. Five days later Mr Smith detected an uncontrollable wave of aliens. \"Scanning… Confirmed. The alien life forms match Rover. There is an incoming message.\" \"¢_©€^¢_|_{√|{~_€_€√Π€\" said the voice. Rover smiled for the first time. \"Mr Smith, translate.\" \"Translating…\" \"Rover, meet us at the place you crashed. We will be there\" We, I mean 'I', realized that our short adventure was nearly over. Chapter 3 Home Coming As Rover realized that sudden sadness came over me, he said that he didn't belong here. He said that his battery was running low. I picked myself up and brought him back. Then we transported Mr Smith into a laptop and brought him with us. When we were nearly there, I spotted the police. Rover once again prepared his laser for hopefully the last time on this planet. I protected my eyes. Then I opened them. The cloud of vapour. I don't need to say any more. We continued on and eventually found the Mother ship. They were there. I was really sad. I realized that our short adventure had ended so quickly. The ship arrived. Rover got aboard. They closed the door. They went away. And that… Was the end… Of that.

We were now safely at the clearing in the forest, our destination, and Elliot was quickly the first to jump off of his bicycle and he gently picked me up and set me down onto the ground as he unwrapped me from the warm, white blanket that I had been wrapped in. Elliot then rushed over to the special transmitter we had constructed for the purpose of sending a message to my companions in their spaceship. The transmitter was humming and buzzing with life as Elliot cleared away the dry leaves that had fallen onto it. It was just then that the wind began to stir, and I looked up towards the sky as the clouds began to glow bright shades of blue, purple, and yellow, and I quickly began to feel a very familiar sensation in the very center of my heart, so that the light in it began to glow even more vibrantly. \"Home!\" I said as the clouds began to part and a magnificent light of unexplainable brilliance began to fill the evening sky. From the corner of my left eye I could see how Elliot was holding his hand above his eyes as he watched what I was watching. The mother-ship was descending gradually and gracefully from above with all of its light beams glowing brightly. I extended my neck to see it better as it lowered ever closer and I could see it in all of it's glory. I truly had seen it countless times before, but seeing right now was really a special time. For a while I had been sadly feeling that I wouldn't ever see it again, and now here I was looking up at it and blinking rapidly, and not just from the brightness of the light that it was radiating, but also from all of the love and harmony that it was radiating to my heart which was now really pulsating with an overwhelming sense of joy. It was rather like how I had felt when I had come back to life, as Elliot said I had died although all I remember is being in a very deep and peaceful sleep before I awakened with my illness gone from me, and knowing then that my companions had received the message I had sent them and were on their way for me. Now here they were as I could really feel a strong connection of our heart-lights joining together once again. I had lost the connection to them as soon as they had left me behind, which was an accident as they were in a hurry to flee from those men, and now the sensation of being reconnected with them was almost more than I could bear. \"Home!\" I said again as I gulped down a sob that was rising inside of me. I watched as the spaceship was lowered down before me and its pistols were spread out evenly so that it was set onto the ground with perfect gentleness. I then watched as the door was opened and a ramp was lowered onto the ground, and just inside of the opening of the ship I could see about four of my companions with their heart-lights all glowing a bright red that matched my own. It was just then that I saw another set of lights coming from around the corner in the forest, I looked and watched as a car pulled to a halt in front of us, and out of it stepped Mary, who I knew was the mother of the three children that had looked after me during my stay at their house, and the man who I now knew was among the men who were searching for me, and that he wanted no harm to come to me. I also saw Gertie, the little girl who was the little sister of Elliot, and I watched as she approached me holding the pot containing the geranium plant she had given me shortly after we had met. She approached me with tears streaming down her face. \"I just wanted to say. . . goodbye,\" she said. \"He doesn't know goodbye,\" said Michael, standing close beside her. Gertie then simply handed me the pot with the geranium in it, and then gave me a tender little kiss on the side of my face. I smiled, for I loved Gertie and the geranium plant that she gave to me as a gift. It was true that I didn't know the word goodbye, though I sensed that meant something of sadness as I looked into Gertie's tear filled eyes. I remembered that it was thanks to her and her toy electronic spelling board that I had learned to speak a bit of their language, and I also would not have been able to phone home at all without it. \"B! Good!\" I said the very first thing that Gertie had taught me, hoping that it would cheer her up. \"Yes,\" she said and nodded with a weak smile. Then Gertie stepped aside as Michael, who I knew was the oldest of the three, stepped closer to me and slowly reached his hand out towards me. For a moment I was confused as to what he was going to do, and then he ever so gently rested his hand onto the top of my head and petted and stroked it with a great tenderness that was very calming to me. I sighed deeply as I leaned back and enjoyed the sensation of Micheal's love for me that flowed into my heart-light I could feel that Michael had rediscovered something he had lost through me, and that he would never forget me, or what he had learned from me. I felt him slowly draw his hand away from my head and I relaxed as all of the love I felt from it settled into me. \"Thank you,\" I murmured. I had learned this phrase before, and now I somehow felt that it was the appropriate thing to say to Michael at this moment. \"You're welcome,\" Michael said as he slowly stepped back and smiled broadly. And now Elliot stepped up to me. He was the very first friend I had made on Earth. He had taken me into his own home and given me food and taken such good care of me. If it wasn't for him I truly wouldn't be alive right now. It was his infinite love for me, as well as Micheal's and Gertie's, with the combined power of that of my companions who were like family to me, that had resurrected me after my death of the disease I had got from the polluted atmosphere that Earth has, and if it hadn't been for the three of them I would have perished much sooner. As I looked at Elliot, I saw that his eyes were reflecting a deep inner sadness which I knew was because I was now leaving. From the moment that we had met each other we had been having the same feelings at the same time, our souls were connected. I felt that if we could just be together always that we would always be happy. I reached out to him. \"Come,\" I said hopefully. \"Stay,\" Elliot replied very sadly. I knew that he meant he had to stay behind on Earth. I sighed deeply, for of course I understood, he had a family that loved him just as I did, and yet at the same time I could feel the loneliness I had felt when I had been left behind returning to me. My heart-light was strongly connected with my home planet and my family, and now it was also connected just as strongly with this planet and Elliot and his family. I slowly brought my index finger to my heart and then touched it to my lips as I murmured, \"Ouch.\" It was a word which I had learned to express pain. \"Ouch,\" Elliot murmured as he did the same pattern, and I watched as a single tear trickled down from his right eye. As I continued to look at Elliot, I telepathically radiated a message for him to embrace me. As I began to open my arms for him, he opened his own and all at once flung himself onto me and held on tightly. I laid my hands onto his back and rubbed it tenderly as I tried to soothe the great sadness which I could feel his heart was filled with. At the same time I could also feel a love that greater and more powerful than could be imagined. I remembered all of the good times I had had with Elliot from he had given me Reese's Pieces and taken me in, and taught me about life of Earth, to when he had brought the tools I needed to build the transmitter and I had healed his finger when he had cut it on the saw blade, to when we had gone flying over the treetops of the forest on his bicycle, to when I had gotten sick and he had stayed by my side all the while, and then he had been the first face I saw when I was healed and resurrected, and then he had probably risked his own life in getting me to where I was now. As we continued to hold each other I felt that I had somehow changed Elliot's life for the better and had filled in a void that had been in his heart, and indeed he had done the same for me. He was the first to show me that humans are gentle, and kind, and caring, and I would never forget that. I closed my eyes as laid my head against his shoulder, and just cherished the feeling of us being pressed against each other, and then he very slowly began to pull out of the embrace. As I let my arms slide, ever so slowly, from Elliot's body, I looked at his tear stained face and felt I couldn't cry at this parting moment and make him sadder, and then I realized there was no need to cry anyway, for we would always stay connected to each other no matter what happened. I smiled as I lit my fourth finger and touched it to his forehead. \"I'll be right here,\" I said as I remembered that was the last thing he had said to me when I was very sick, and it had made me feel better, I just hoped it would do the same for him. He smiled and seemed to be comforted. \"Bye,\" he said softly. So then I lowered my neck again as I reached down to pick up the potted geranium I had set beside me. I looked at them all one last time before I turned around and began my decent up the ramp to my spaceship. I held tightly to the plant Gertie had given me, of all of the plants I had and cared for on my home planet, this one would be the most special of all to me. As I continued up the gangway, my companions came closer to me with their heart-lights beckoning me towards them. My captain stood in the center of them and as soon as I was close enough I reached out and embraced him. I then could feel the hands of my other companions touching me on my head and back, and our love and care for each other surged through. I then turned around and stood beside of them as I watched the ramp being loaded into the ship once again, and the door began to close itself. I looked at the eight human beings who were gathered together for our leaving the Earth with unmeasured love and affection, and I knew we would always be together in our hearts and memories. Then finally the door was closed, and my captain said to me, \"We received your message, and we never meant to leave you behind, you know. I am sure it will never happen again.\" I smiled as I replied. \"I was meant to be left behind.\" \"You were? Why do you think that?\" my captain asked with surprise. \"Elliot,\" I said. \"He needed me, just as I needed him. He took care of me, kept me alive, if not for him I wouldn't be here now.\" \"So then humans are really caring creatures?\" my captain asked. \"Yes they are,\" I said. I then began to tell them all about my adventure on Earth, and when we arrived home to the Green Planet I would tell all of my fellow botanists. Would they envy me? Maybe, or maybe not. I just hoped that I would someday be able to visit Earth again and see all of the friends I had made on my last trip, and I hoped it would be soon.

My umbrella had given up, and had become one mess of wires and useless cloth. As another strong wind pushed me forward, I leaned back to get my balance. But it was too late. The wind had died back down just as suddenly as it had started, and I had completely lost what little balance I had style=\"mso-spacerun: yes;\" /spanAnd with the slippery pavement beneath me, I fell flat on my butt./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"God damn it all to hell!\" I yelled into the ensuing storm. The bottom of my pants was now soaked, and my jacket, though water resistant, was almost soaked right though. I looked around, hoping that no one had seen such an embarrassing moment. But thankfully, every window stayed as dark as they were before./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"It was midnight, in this sleepy little town, and when the stores closed at five pm, everyone kind of settled in for supper and bed. So, when I went down the forest path to take a shortcut, I didn't think twice about how quiet everything was. Well, other than the deafening sound of rain, of course./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"The path wound its way around the thick trees. Their foliage muffling the sounds of the storm and the leaves sparring me from the torrential rain. I was finally able to look up, the hood of my jacket still shedding so much water./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I felt like I had walked out of Lake Berryessa, and somehow survived! I shook my head, water spraying everywhere and took my glasses out of purse. The thick lenses were damp, and I squinted through the partial darkness, trying to find the right path home. the street light behind me lit up the path enough for me to see. Slowly, I traveled down the path, careful not to trip on any roots./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"The path was more of a biking trail with many twists and turns. Every few feet there would be another route leading off to the right or left. I hunched over, as thick drops of water rained on me, and the wind had been stopped by the thick trees, had began gusting once more in my direction./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Brrr.\" I shivered, trying to stay on the main path. A large oak tree loomed ahead of me and I turned onto the left of the 'Y' path to go around it. /span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Just then a bright white light flashed on my right, accompanied with a whooshing noise. It created a mural of shadows amongst the ferns. I raised my hand to cover my eyes, but the light was already gone. Instead it was replaced with dots of light blue and a bit of orange./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"What the hell?\" I asked myself as I blinked rapidly, trying to clear my eyes from the sudden blast of light./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I had stopped moving, frozen, startled by the sudden light, and as I let my eyes adjust, I noticed for the first time just how quiet the forest truly was./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Weird.\" I whispered, peering around as my eyes was slowly adjusting. I could see glimpses of the knee-high bushes, long fingered ferns and the towering pine trees. But when I tried to see past them all to see where the light had come from, all I could see was a towering 'U' shape with little lights brightening up the clearing./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Mist began to crawl across the forest floor as I inched my way in closer and pulled my earbuds out. Taking out my bear spray, I tried to stay as low and quiet as possible. But with every step I could hear the pine needles under my feet crunch and snap. I thought I was walking so loudly that I was sure I had scared whoever or whatever was ahead of me. But as I neared, I found that there were small shapes shuffling around, admiring and picking up certain plants and flowers./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"They were alien. Of that there was no doubt. They were gray and about two feet tall. Their little flat feet patted the wet ground as they shuffled from each plant. Their heads were long and flat rather than the round human heads I was used to seeing everyday. Their big round eyes looked around them in awe, as they breathed heavily and in a slightly rasping way each time they inhaled./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I knew then that my small knowledge of aliens was completely wrong. They seemed completely uninterested in communicating with any humans, rather they seemed intent on finding out everything they could about the plants located in this field./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I watched, aghast, as my eyes continued to show me what was in front of me. The little gray people, though I'm not sure that they were people as you and I would know it, carefully dug plants out by the roots. They were so careful with them, it was like the plants were their new infants or something./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I was so focused on watching the dozen or so aliens collect plants from around their landing area, that I failed to notice that one of them had gone a little further than the rest. The alien had seen something of interest, near to where I was hiding. And had approached the bush that I was hiding behind. I realised how flimsy my choice of a hiding spot truly was, but the alien was intent on a little yellow flowered plant. . ./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Still, I tried to hold my breath, so that I could continue to watch this fascinating scene before me, before I realized that that was impossible. So, I gasped, and then tried my best to breathe as quietly as I could through my nose./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"As far as I could tell, the aliens weren't trying to kidnap anyone, and they seemed friendly enough, but I still couldn't take up the courage to reveal my position. As the alien closest to me, having found and de-rooted a single yellow flowered plant and started to pad back to their space ship./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Suddenly, it was like a siren went off from the inside of the ship – because all the aliens stretched their long necks all the way up into the air, and looked in one direction, and I did as well. But I couldn't see anything. How ever they communicate, either verbally or telepathically, I could tell that something had happened that made the aliens worried. And then a pulsating red light started to glow from each of their chests./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Wow!\" I whispered. Noting that the ramp of their spaceship had opened up for them and they all started to get inside. A mist of humidity poured out from inside the ship, as the ship's interior light illuminated the area. As the last alien waddled on board the ship, it turned and waited in the ship's door way for a moment. Its shape silhouette in the light. The clearing was silent for a minute, and then the ramp began to close, and ship lifted off the ground./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"It was then that I heard a squealing. I thought it was a baby pig, having a panic attack. But as the spaceship took off and left Earth's atmosphere, the squeal turned into a wail that stopped as suddenly as it started. I thought that the squealing sound is what freaked the aliens into leaving./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"But then an alien with the same long neck and pulsating chest ran into the clearing and looked up at the fast disappearing ship. He squealed mournfully at his home as it started disappearing into the darkness as eight beams from large flashlights started to flash this way and then that way./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"It's over here!\"/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Yeah, I saw it head in this direction!\"/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Two of the men spoke with their gruff voices; startling me and the lone alien into flight. No way in hell was I going to be captured by what ever government agency they were, for just because of this chance encounter with a few friendly aliens! Their flashlights waved behind me, the light bouncing off the thick trees. I ran, but the thick ferns and mossy rocks slowed me down enough that I realised I was ahead of the men and beside the alien. We were running parallel though the forest. I was heading straight home, as fast as I could, but the alien most likely only had one thought – 'stay safe, stay free until they come back for me.'/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"The trees thinned out, and from here you could see the lights of the entire town sprawled below. The alien was to my right, and upon seeing the lights of the town, it swerved and continued to run from the men. The ridge led down in both directions and I took the other path. This path led me much faster to my home in the outskirts of my town./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I could tell that the men were searching for the alien. No way they were also here by accident. The lone alien started to cry and run away from the scary humans. I understood completely. The men were yelling and flashing their flashlights around, and the dogs that they had with them were barking and growling so much that even I wanted to run away./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"The alien ran away unknowingly from me, and knowingly from the group of men and their dogs. I got up, shaking out my sleeping legs, and started to jog after the alien. The trees that grew so closely together, started to thin out. The mossy rocks were poking out of the scraggly bushes. And over the top of the hill, I could see the light starting to shine over the low mist. I realized that the pouring rain must have stopped at some point while I was watching the aliens collecting all the plants./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Now the mist started to rise off the lake and pool in the small town. The street lights muted, and I could hear the alien making his pathetic squealing noises over to the right of me. Some how we had both ended up on the same cliff face, looking over the town at the same moment. I turned, about to offer some encouragement like – \"it'll be all right, your friends will come back for you. . .\" or something to that effect. Sounds kind of stupid now that I think about it. Telling an alien that everything is going to be all right, when I'm not even sure that the alien can even understand anything that I am saying./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Just then, the noise that the men were making, and the barking of the dogs became closer. Too close. The alien squealed, raising his arms in a \"Ahhhhh! I'm getting out of here!\" kind of motion, while I ran in the opposite direction. My house was at the bottom of the hill, and I had had enough of creepy alien encounters and men chasing me./span/p /blockquote[Chapter 2] p class=\"MsoNormal\" style=\"text-align: center;\"strongspan lang=\"EN-CA\"Chapter Two/span/strong/p p class=\"MsoNormal\" /p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"As I entered my home, my fiancé Richard, sat up from his slump on the couch./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Hey babe! How was work!\" He exclaimed, turning off the t.v./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Oh man! Work was boring . . . With the usual customers and all. . . You know boring stuff and all, but. . .\" I answered trying to shed my jacket. It was sticking to my arms, making the job that much more difficult./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Cool, man. So, supper is ready for you in the fridge, but I'm going to bed, Sarah. Goodnight!\" Richard yawned and started to head upstairs, his heavy feet making loud thumps. I could hear him head towards the back where the single large bedroom sprawled along the whole back of the house./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I sighed./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I had been dating Richard on and off for about five years, ever since we met in eleventh grade and became high school sweethearts. The summer we graduated, Richard asked me to marry him, but I'd already had the next year planned out./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"So that summer, I traveled around the countryside, visiting my many family members that have, over the years, spread out into ten different states. From New York all the way to San Francisco, I spent driving the highways and more scenic routes of the U.S.A. I thought about my relationship with Richard and how I wanted to spend my days with my life-long partner. And in those long summer days, I deluded myself into thinking that I was in love./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Hell, I wish I had taken a little bit more time on that particular decision. Like asking for familial advice or waiting to see if there was anyone else in my life that could be any better at loving and being loved in return, than him./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"It was two more years, with an on-again, off-again dating before he'd asked me to marry him, again./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I'd said yes, only because there was no one else in my life. But I was really starting to regret it./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I mean seriously! I had just seen aliens, for God's sake! And I'm soaking wet, and he didn't even try to offer to help me out of my wet things, warm me up or even warm the supper he'd made for me!/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"No, he'd barely even looked at me, before hustling upstairs as soon as I'd gotten in the door!/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Yeah. Thanks for making supper.\" I replied sarcastically. My excitement from seeing the spaceship fell to the back of my mind as my annoyance at Richard peaked. My jacket finally came off, and I wrung as much water out as I could. Once they had stopped dripping, I put everything in the washer and took a nice hot bath./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"a name=\"_Hlk505157256\"/aspan lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Wow! What that was the most, weirdest evening ever!\" I sighed, the hot water relaxing my mind. I recalled the last hour, thinking about how the aliens had come just to see the plant life. I tried to think about why the men and their dogs could have known about the spaceship landing there, and how they got there so fast. I must have fallen asleep, because I woke up with cold water and no bubbles left. Sighing, I dried off and headed up to bed. Richard was already passed out and snoring when I sneaked under the blanket and came in for a cuddle. As my cold arms wrapped around him, he started to stir./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk505157256;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Mnm, baby, not right now.\" Richard sighed in his sleep./span/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk505157256;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Hey, when do you want to carve that pumpkin?\" I murmured in his ear. Richard was so tired he couldn't even form a reply. So I just tucked my head into his neck and tried sleep./span/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk505157256;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"-/span/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk505157256;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Four hours later. . ./span/span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span style=\"mso-bookmark: _Hlk505157256;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I couldn't sleep. I guess that the nap I had earlier in the bathroom was enough for my brain. I couldn't stop thinking that there was alien stuck here in town and that it was so lost and alone. I didn't know what I would do if I was on an alien planet and I had been abandoned by my /span/spanspan lang=\"EN-CA\"fellow space-people./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Sighing I crawled out from under the warm blankets and went downstairs to get a glass of warm milk. The night was dark as black billowing clouds covered the moon. The rain had yet to start up again, and the night was quiet, I could hear the chirping from all the way down the street./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"So, when the crickets stopped their song, and I could hear a bit of shouting and a distinctive bit of squealing. I stood up, looking out the window and tried to see where it was coming from. After a few tense moments, I gave up./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Shit!\" I ran to get my sweater and pulled on my soggy tennis shoes. Running out the door, I went down the street where I thought I had heard the shouting. A car whizzed past me labeled 'Pizza' on the side and stopped to listen for any more alien noises./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"God, what am I doing? Searching for a lost alien in the middle of the night. And now I'm talking to myself, like a crazy alien chaser. . .\" I turned the corner, where the street went up on this little hill. I could hear a swing creaking from behind one the houses. Some kids, partying because it was a Friday night, glanced out the window. I became very uncomfortable and I was starting to get a little cold as I realized I was just standing there, on the sidewalk like a creepy stalker or something./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Shaking my head to clear my thoughts, I casually walked down the path that led to the little park and the street beyond./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"A glance at the party-goer's backyard, revealed a boy staring into his shed. He was stock still. Almost like he was afraid of whatever was inside. At first, I thought that it was just a skunk or something. But then he threw his ball into the open door. My eyebrow quirked a bit, before the ball rolled back out the door./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I gasped. I was not expecting that. And neither did the boy. He was so surprised that he didn't even hear me. He was in his zone, concentrating on whatever was in the shed./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Now, I was hoping that it was the alien and that the boy would leave so that I could get a closer look at the herbivore alien in his backyard, but he sat down in his lawn chair and curled up for the night./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"The poor alien was stuck in the shed until the boy moved. And my curiosity was killing me, because I really wanted to see the alien again. But I hadn't the courage to wake the boy. So, I waited, standing as still as the boy was. Waiting for the alien to do something, anything. Show its face from its hiding place, or even make a noise. But nothing. Not even a single sound./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I was there for three maybe four hours, eyes locked onto that little shed. My legs were cold, and my knees were locked when I finally shifted. I blinked, in what seemed like forever, glancing at the still silent boy. And realised that he was passed out on the lawn chair./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"And the alien had seen this as well. And was trying to sneak out of the shed. His hiding place no longer safe as the sun started to rise./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"I crouched down, watching the alien from between the boards of the fence. Slowly I crawled to the back of the boy's lawn where a metal gate was clinking quietly as the wind started to blow again. As slowly as I could, I lifted up the latch and squeaked open the gate, wincing at every loud noise that the rusty gate was making. With a squeal of his own, the alien ran straight at me, and through the open gate. I realised that that was all it was looking for - an escape route. The alien had not wanted to stay in the shed all night, and I was glad to help it escape, though where he would go next might not be any safer./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"Just then my stomach rumble, reminding me that I hadn't had supper last night, or breakfast this morning./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"\"Shit, I've got t' get home!\" I said, shivering slightly as the wind continued to gust right though my sweater. Crossing my arms, I noticed that the boy was warm looking under a blanket that was cocooned around him./span/p p class=\"MsoNormal\"em style=\"mso-bidi-font-style: normal;\"span lang=\"EN-CA\"'He'll be alright.'/span/emspan lang=\"EN-CA\" I thought as I headed home.

Don Billingsworth walked home, taking as much time as he needed. He did not want to face what was there, though he knew it would come sooner or later. As soon as he stepped in the door, his dad walked up to him. \"Why can't you hold onto a football, huh?!\" He screamed at his son. Don walked away. \"Leave me alone.\" he said quietly. But Mr. Billingsworth persisted. \"I want a f***ing answer! I want to know why you make damn fumbles every time you hold-or rather drop-a ball! Is there something wrong with you?\" he shouted. \"Godddamn it! Leave me alone!\" Don cried, on the verge of tears. He went into his room and slammed the door, and fell onto his bed. The next night, after a football practice, Don drove home. His heart was not as heavy as before. Tonight, things would be different. This girl he was seeing (He didn't want to call her a 'girlfriend' just yet), Jay, was coming over to his house tonight. He parked the car and got out, fingering his high school football championship ring nervously. Just then, her car pulled up. He took a deep breath and went to meet her. \"Hi, Don!\" she said enthusiastically. She gave him a warm hug, and for a moment with Jay, Don felt like he was ina place where someone really loved him, fumbles or not. He walked to his house, and they sat down on the couch. They fell into a passionate kiss, and were about to do someting more passionate, but then Don's father stormed into the room. \"What the hell are you doing?\" he yelled, as usual. He grabbed Don by the arm and pulled him to his feet. Jay sat on the couch, watching in stunned silence. \"I saw another fumble today!\" he said. He walked away and rustled through some drawers, and finally came back with a football and some tape. \"Dad! Dad! What are you-\" Don was cut off as his father shouted back at him. \"Can you hold on to the ball now?\" he asked, wrapping tight layers of duct tape, and binding the football to Don's hands. Jay tried to pull Don away, and for a long while all you would have been able to hear inside of that house was shouting. Finally, Jay got Don out of his father's clutches. She grabbed both of their coats, and pulled a still screaming Don outside. She dragged him into her car, and jumped in as well. Revving the motor, she sped away to a small park a few blocks away from Don's house. She shut the car off and turned toward Don. Taking his shaking hands in her warm ones, she started tenderly unwrapping the duct tape from his hands. Finally, the football and strands of duct tape fell to the floor of the car. \"Come on.\" Jay said to Don gently. \"put your coat on.\" she helped him into his coat. Don still sat rigid, shaking with hidden emotions. Jay pulled him out of the car and they made their way to a park bench near a lake. \"Don, \"Jay said, \"I still love you. I'll never love anyone else.\" Don finally turned toward her. He took a deep breath, opened his mouth to say something, and turned away. Don fell to his knees and retched onto the grass. \"Don!\" Jay cried. She rubbed his back until he was done, but as she tried to help him back onto the bench, he shyed away from her hand. \"Don't.\" he said, sitting back down on the bench. Jay sat down as well, and tentatively reached for his hand. She took it in hers, and to her astonishment, he burst into tears. \"I can't help it that I fumble! Goddamn it all! Why do I have to be perfect! All I do is try! I don't-I can't-do this...\" he broke off and statred sobbing again. Jay embraced him. \"I can't do anything about your dad, Don-but-you don't have to do this alone.\" She raised her hands to wipe away his tears, and her eyes widened as he flinched, perhaps imagining his father. \"I'm never going to hurt you, Don.\" Jay whispered. she wiped his tears away.[Chapter 2] Jay drove Don home after a few hours of sitting at the park. As she turned into the Billingsley driveway, Don turned to her. \"Thanks.\" he said. \"For everything.\" Jay nodded and looked at him lovingly, and again Don felt the feeling of being home. He reluctantly spepped out of the car, rubbing his still-sore hands. He stepped into the house, and ran to his room as he heard his dad stomp across the floor. The next practice, Don got better. He heard his dad cheering for him as he caught the ball, and looked to the bleachers. His dad smiled at him, but Don looked away sadly. His spirits were lifted as he heard another bout of cheering, this time from Jay. After practice was over, Jay mat Don outside the locker room. They kissed passionately. \"I thought you had to work today!\" he said happily. Jay shrugged. \"I took off, to see you.\" Don kissed her again, but broke off as his dad walked over to him. \"You did good, son.\" Mr. Billingsley said, rumpling Don's hair and hugging his son. Don, after a momentary hesitation, hugged his father back. Then, as his dad walked away, Don swept Jay into another kiss, as Boobie came out of the locker room. \"Oooo, look what we got here! I think Don's got a good one, guys!\" he shouted. This didn't seem to faze Don, however; he kept right on kissing Jay. Jay, however, gave Boobie the finger behind Don's back, which sent all of the players, even Mike, away laughing or smiling. Don pulled away from her. \"Why are they laughing?\" he asked. Jay, and the rest of the team who were spying on them burst into laughter again. Don gave Jay a quizzical look, but she just shook her head. The two lovebirds walked away hand in hand. When Don got home, his dad was there to congratulate him. This time, instead of looking away from his father, Don smiled as best he could and hugged his dad for the second time that day. There was a small party at Don's house, mostly made up of family members. Don was, for the first time, happy with where he was. With his family. After the party was over, Don called up Boobie to see how he was doing. \"Hey, man.\" Boobie answered the phone. \"Hey, \" Don answered. How are you? Coming back to play next game?\" Boobie sighed. \"Not sure, man. I'm going to get an MRI tomorrow. No tears or anything, but...\" Don sighed. \"Well, I'm wishing you luck.\" He hung up the phone. \"Hey Don, come here!\" his dad said. Don sighed again. Suddenly all he wanted to do was be alone. \"I-I think I'm gonna go to bed, dad!\" Don called back. Mr. Billingsley nodded, though Don couldn't see the motion. \"Good! Get some sleep for the practice tomorrow!\" he called. Don went to his room and fell onto his bed. He felt unexplainably lonely, and tears filled his eyes. He called Jay after a few hours, after he made sure his dad was asleep. \"Jay? I need to talk to you.\" as soon as Jay answered the phone, and heard Don's tone of voice, she was suddenly wide awake. \"I'll come over.\" she said. Jay silently slipped into Don's room, where he lay on his bed, trying to control his emotions. Jay sat down next to him, and took his hand. \"What's wrong?\" she asked tenderly. Don shook his head. \"I don't know. Dad threw me a party tonight. It was, you know, small, just family, but-but-I wish he could be like this, happy with me, all the time. Not just when I win a game, or don't fumble. All the time, like Boobie's uncle to him, or-I just feel so lonely all the time, even when he's happy with me. Like today.\" Jay lay next to him on his bed. \"I don't know.\" she said in a whisper. \"But you know what I said. I'm always here for you.\" She had no idea how wrong she was...[Chapter 3] The next morning, Don opened his eyes, looked at the clock, and jumped out of bed. He had overslept, and practice was in 10 minutes! As if on cue, Charles walked into Don's bedroom. \"Get the HELL up!\" he shouted at his son. \"I'm up!\" Don shouted back. In 5 minutes, Don was in the car, driving to the field, trying to ignore his dad's glares from the backseat. Finally he had enough. He parked in the parking lot, and turned around to face his father. \"I overslept! Get of my case, like you never overslept once in your whole life!\" His dad gave him another glare. \"How do you know that I EVER overslept!?\" he yelled back. And now we're late!\" he said, looking at the clock on the dashboard. He practically kicked Don out of the car onto the field, where, as expected, he was screamed at by the coach for being late. He sighed and took his place on the field. Today was not his day. He searched the bleachers hopingly, but Jay was not there. After a half an hour of practice, a mock game started. Don was running, and the ball was coming to him...but so were the opposing players. He caught the ball, but then fumbled and dropped it. His dad jumped over the bleachers and got in his face, and screamed at him. \"why con't you hold onto the god damn ball?\" he shouted. Don turned away, his face red. He started to walk away, taking his helmet off. \"Listen to me!\" Charles screamed. He ran around in front of Don and punched him in the stomach. Since this wasn't a real game, there was no protection on. Don dropped to the ground, gasping for air. His teammates stood back, not wanting to be pummelled by \"The Legend.\" Don, catching his breath, turned over onto his back, but his father was there. He kicked Don squarely in the ribs, knocking him to the ground. He didn't get up this time. Charles spat at his son and walked away. Don tried to get up now, but winced and almost cried out. Something made a sharp noise in his chest. Boobie helped Don up as the coach walked over to him. \"Go home, son.\" the coach said, patting Don's shoulder. It was a rare show of sympathy from the coach, and Don took it with relief. He walked off the field, turned to go into the locker room and ran headlong into a girl. Don stepped back, sucking in breath as a wave of pain hit him, and realized the girl was Jay. \"Donnie!\" she said, seeing the pained look on his face. \"What happened?\" Don stepped away from her, suddenly angry. \"You said you's always be there for me.\" he whispered dangerously. \"Donnie, I had an emergency at work, and-\" Jay worked for a babysitting company. Don stepped away from her again. \"You said you'd always be there for me!\" he said, shouting now. \"You lied! That's my life these days. I'm living a lie!\" Don pushed past Jay, who was quietly sobbing, and stormed into the locker room despite the pain in his head and chest.[Chapter 4] That night, Don went home, grabbed his stash of money, and walked the miles to Mike's house. Mike opened the door, surprised to see his teammate standing on the steps to his house. \"Don, Jesus! Why are you here?\" Don took a deep breath, and winced. His chest still hurt like nothing else. \"I-can I stay with you for a while?\" Don asked. Mike sighed. \"But-\" Don winced in pain again, and Mike rethought his answer. \"I'll ask Mom.\" Mike said. \"Come inside.\" Don gingerly sat down on the sofa, putting his suitcase down. He quietly listened as Mike subtly asked his mom if Don could stay over for a few nights. After a confirmation from his mom, Mike walked back into the living room. He nodded to Don. \"Thanks.\" Don tried to say, but he had a sudden coughing fit. He put his hand to his mouth, and when he pulled it away he was surprised to see it flecked with blood. Mike saw, too. \"Jesus, what did your dad do to you?\" he asked. \"I don't know.\" Don said hoarsely. \"I think my rib might be broken. I had a fight with Jay, too. I yelled.\" Don put his head in his hands, suddenly recalling how thoughtless he had been to Jay. \"Jay! Oh my God!\" he said suddenly. \"I have to call her!\" Mike handed him the phone, and after a few rings Jays' answering machine clicked on. Don noticed Jay had changed the message. It used to say, \"Hi! this is Jay, I'm not home right now, sing your song at the beep.\" The machine recording now read, \"This is Jay. Leave a message, I can't pick up right now. And if this is Don, f*** off ! I don't want to hear anything you say!\" At this point it sounded like she was in tears. Don handed Mike the phone and said, \"I'm going to her house.\" But as he got up, a great pain stabbed at his lung, and he fell to the floor, unconscious.[Chapter 5] Later on in the evening, Don was lying on a hospital bed, still unconscious. The football team anxiously figeted, standing up, sitting down, worried. Jay was outside the door, in tears. Mike was trying to comfort her. The only person who should have been there, however, was not. His dad would not come to the hospital to see his injured son. the whole football team knew this. They finally saw past the nickname \"The Legend\", to the man didn't like what they saw. When Don was brought in, the doctors examined him and finally diagnosed him with a cracked rib. A sharp piece of the rib had pierced his lung. The doctors said it was going to be painful, but that it wasn't serious and it would heal in time for the next game. By then, Mike and Boobie had called the rest of the team and Jay. They called Charles, too, but he wouldn't come to the phone. Just then, Don opened his eyes. \"Hey, guys.\" he called weakly to his fellow teammates. They turned around and, seeing him conscious, cheered and shouted. Mike went inside the room, too, leaving the weeping Jay outside. After a brief chat with Don, Mike left the room again. \"He's awake.\" Mike said to Jay, patting her back sympathetically. \"He wants to see you.\" Jay tried to compose herself, and walked into the bright hospital room. As soon as she came to Don's bedside , however, she burst into tears. \"I should have been there, I'm a terrible girlfriend, I don't deserve someone like you.\" she moaned, tears running down her perfect cheeks. Don lay his hand on hers. \"It's okay.\" He said to her. She shook her head. \"But I said I'd always be there for you.\" she said. He raised a hand and wiped her tears away. \"Hey, \" he said softly. \"You're here for me now. That's all that matters.\" Jay looked at him lovingly. \"You really mean it?\" she sniffed. He nodded, then winced slightly. Meanwhile, the rest of the team was watching this exchange. \"Man, \"Boobie whispered to the team. \"I wish I had a girlfriend like that.\" Don Billingsley, after graduating from high school and college, eventually married Jay. They had three kids, Josh, Maria, and Jule. Don still plays football, but now he coaches Jule and Maria's all girl football team. Jay is a doctor, though she also helps coach the football team.

I am usually a Misc writer, but I have always been OBSESSED with Garrett Hedlund since Four brothers, and I've wanted to do some stories on him, but can't find a proper site, so I guess I'm going to do it through his characters. Don Billingsley is definitely one of my favorite characters play by Garrett so I decided to start with him(also I LOVE writing High School fics). This is my first Friday Night Lights fic. So please let me know if I should keep going or just stick to misc (lol). Enjoy! Characters: Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) & Sara Underwood Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) & Danneel Harris Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) & Briana Evigan Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young) & Katerina Graham *And occasional appearance by Boobie (Derek Luke) (Pictures of each character is located on my profile through a link) Plot: The seniors have their towns' hopes and dreams resting on their shoulders, but as if the pressure of football wasn't enough they still must deal with all the chaos of being regular teens; schools & grades, girls, family, jobs etc. How will each handle it? Will they crack? Read & Find out! Chapter One! Senior Year August 21, the sun gleamed hard amongst the town of Odessa, Texas. Kids and teens all over the town were preparing for the first day of school. Seniors especially was looking forward to this year. He stood 5\"11, 145lbs. Persian High Schools' own Don Billingsley, dressed in nothing but a towel as he hopped out of the shower. He was poplar, played tailback for the Persian Panthers, famous with the town by his last name, but also by his rebellious attitude. Don Billingsley had a lot to prove this year, and he was going to jump through hoops to do just that. Don got dressed in jeans and red shirt and a jean vest over it, with his usual MOJO cap. He grabbed his backpack which leaned against the wall next to his bedroom door, before making his way into the living room to reveal his drunken father Charlie Billingsley passed out on the couch. Don shook his head in disgust, grabbing the car keys which rested on the kitchen counter, before making his way outside to his dad's car. Don and Charlie Billingsley weren't exactly the perfect father son combination. The two could never really seem to get along. Nonchalant Don handled that by not coming home till he knew his dad was passed out every night and Charlie dealt with it through drinking. Don drove a little up the road, leading him to the next street over, where his \"girlfriend\" Sara Underwood lived. She was a five foot petite blonde. Sara was intelligent being at the top of her class, student body president, and though she was gorgeous, she was a bit insecure. She was also the only girl patient enough to deal with Don. Don wasn't the relationship type, and the couple had gone through a lot with him being unfaithful. But, she wasn't ready to give up on him just yet. Her excuse for never leaving was, they grew up together, and she knew he meant well in any and everything he did. There also had to be a reason he stuck around. The school talked about Sara and Don all of the time, most felt that she was a complete idiot for being with him, others just felt sorry for her, and of course jealousy was always an issue. Sara looked out the window of her bedroom and saw Don pull up in her yard, before grabbing her books. \"Bye dad!\" Sara yelled to her dad, who was the town's sheriff. \"Bye Sweetheart! Tell Don to make this season a winning one!\" he yelled nicely from the back room as he was getting ready for work. She smiled brightly before walking out and to his car, dressed like a typical southern girl, nicely in long denim jeans, a floral designed shirt, and boots, her long blonde hair lying straight down. \"My dad said make this season a winning season\" she chuckled as she got in the car. \"Tell him that's the plan!\" he laughed making sure she was completely in before driving off. \"So are you excited about this year?\" she smiled \"Not thinking much of it!\" he bluntly replied \"You? Mrs. President!\" \"Yes! Super, last year at Persian High\" \"Yeah, that is an up, but since you're president this year I'm sure it's about to go back to how it was\" Sara rolled her eyes \"Here we go!\" she scoffed \"what does that mean?' \"It means, I'm sure you will have plenty of excuses not to be around much!\" he argued \"Why do you always do that?\" \"Do what!\" he yelled \"Argue!\" \"Oh you mean state the truth?\" Sara shook her head and looked out the window, as there school was in sight. At this point she was ready to get out of the car. She was ready to be away from Don already. Meanwhile, a feisty redhead with a somewhat bitchy attitude Danneel Harris stood on the steps in front of Persian. Danneel wasn't originally from Odessa, she and her family just moved to the small town last year, from Los Angeles. As soon as she got in town, her edgy look automatically put her on the \"most wanted\" list. Danneel only lived a few houses down so walking to school was the best way to go for her. Danneel was the Persian Panther cheerleading captain, so the first day of school was an exciting day. She stood in jeans and her cheerleading uniform top, the team's usual first day of school attire. Danneel and her cheer mates had to put up flyers and decorations around the school welcoming everyone back, and reminding them the first game was quickly approaching. Danneel was hanging a few flyers with best friend Briana Evigan in front of the school. \"Can we hurry I have to go meet Brian\" Briana complained. \"Chavez can wait damn!\" Danneel scoffed \"What's an extra two minutes?\" Briana rolled her eyes as she went back to work. Danneel and Briana had a love hate best friend relationship. The school saw Danneel as Batman and Briana as Robin. Danneel was the mean, bossy, controlling girl of the two while Briana could be very sweet, bubbly, and compassionate to her peers. The two were completely opposite but loved each other and were always there for one another, when it really mattered. Briana looked at her watch as she realized five minutes had passed before she turned to pout at her best friend. Danneel looked at Briana then stared at her with an evil glare… \"Go!\" \"Yes!\" she squealed, handing her left over flyers to Danneel before running off to meet her boyfriend Brian Chavez. \"Bitch\" she whispered when she thought she was alone \"That's a great thing to say about your best friend\" she heard a deep country accent from behind Danneel turned to find, Persian Panther's quarterback Mike Winchell, standing in typical jeans, white shirt and his Varsity jacket. \"Ease dropping Winchell\" she scoffed \"Wouldn't call it that!\" he said \"Whatever!\" she shook her head Mike and Danneel was another pair that could be the talk of the town. They weren't a couple but people could tell they wanted to be. Mike was too shy to go for it and Danneel was too stubborn, so they just left it with trash talking with a hidden subtext. \"I think Briana really needs to open her eyes\" Mike rudely said \"Excuse me!\" Danneel turned back on her heels \"You are a horrible influence on her\" \"And who the hell are you to say that!\" Danneel yelled \"It's not just me saying it! The whole damn town can see it!\" Mike said walking up the steps leading to the main entrance doors \"You and the other people in this town need to keep my name out of your mouth because you don't know me!\" Danneel said stepping up to Mike, and getting into his face. \"Yeah, yeah! Try finding another excuse\" Mike said stepping back \"Because the, I'm just miss understood act is beginning to be a cliché\" he shot before turning and walking into the school building, leaving a pissed off Danneel on the stairs alone. Mike Winchell walked down the halls getting happy greeting from people her hardly knew. He was going to speak to his close friend Chavez but walking passed the make out session Brian was having with Briana in the hallways, he didn't want to interrupt. So he walked passed him and nodded at Chris before also passing him. Junior Chris Comer, and his senior girlfriend Katerina Graham sat on the bench on the side of the hallway, looking and comparing their schedules. Chris Comer was finally a starting running back, and his girlfriend was full support of him. She didn't take part in many after school activities just to be at his every practice and every game. Katerina was Chris' number one fan. She was confident, independent, and socially popular, but Chris on the other hand wasn't so social. He was very quiet, and typically underestimated, but he knew when the chips were down he refused to fail and was going to get the job done. Sara stormed into the building and immediately separated herself from Don he strolled in after. Chavez witnesses the anger in Sara as she passed the couple, before pulling apart from Briana and walking over to Don. \"Billingsley, what's wrong with Sara?\" Chavez asked \"Oh, she's just being dramatic\" he replied Briana rolled her eyes at Don before running after Sara; a nearby Katerina also followed them shortly after. Chris didn't want to get involved so he took it upon himself to walk the opposite way. \"Sara, wait up!\" Briana yelled at a close friend \"Why do I even bother with that kid?\" Sara said \"Because you two have known each other since like birth, and you love him\" Katerina answered \"But, he treats me like crap!\" Sara admitted, stopping in front of Katerina and Briana \"Honey, that's all guys!\" Briana told \"And you know Don, he has that jerk off personality by nature\" Sara shook her head leaning he back against the lockers \"I don't get it!\" she said \"I'm all he has; I'm the only one who shows I give a damn, why does he keep pushing me away!\" \"Boys\" Katerina said shaking her head \"I can't get Chris to look up! Ever since he started all I hear is negative thoughts. He just doesn't give himself enough credit. Which I have to admit is kind of unattractive to me\" Sara sighed \"I mean I don't need a cocky ass like Boobie, but I need some type of confidence!\" \"Boys!\" Sara replied next \"It's not always boys, Chavez is amazing\" Briana said he cares, he is brilliant, and he does his own thing he doesn't just follow the crowd\" Katerina and Sara smiled at a blushing and bragging Briana \"But sometimes I don't feel like I'm worthy of him\" Briana said \"Why?\" Katerina asked \"He's so smart, he's only the fast track to Harvard\" she explained \"And I'm just a pretty face, I haven't always been the brightest crown in the box, I'd be lucky if I get into anyone's school\" \"Well, you're only a junior so you have another year to improve your grades\" Sara said trying to make her feel better \"That won't even help me\" Briana replied \"Okay, so you may not get into Harvard but you can go to a smaller school in Boston, to be near him\" Katerina explained Briana put a light smile on her face \"I guess you're right!\" she said smiling in thought of Chavez. \"I think what we thought was going to be the longest year, because it's out last year, may seem like the shortest year because… it's out last year\" Sara deeply spoke, causing the girls to think of what the year was truly going to hold for them. The three girls were dazed off when they heard the first period bell, causing them to snap out of their trance. Each girl was still in deep thoughts as they all went their separate ways. Review Please! I care what you all think! It was only the first day of school, so trust me there's a lot more drama to come, so stick around. It's a high school fic. So breakups, makeup, hookups, betrayal, backstabbing, all on the way![Chapter 2] Here's Chapter 2, Please Review & Enjoy! The first day of her senior year started off relatively horrible. She and boyfriend Don's argument that happened that morning had already caught the attention of all their peers in school. Being the senior class student body president Sara got what others considered special privileges. She was barely in any classes as she dealt with the commotion of getting events and organizations for the school. Sara was at the top of her class because her teachers gave her plenty of opportunity to make up any assignments she missed, if she wasn't present in that days' class session. Don Billingsley on the other hand was running the halls. He was suppose to be making his way to the principal's office due to getting in trouble last class, but it was taking him longer than expected to get there. Don smirked as he was in a semi empty hallway seeing a familiar face walking his way. \"Take that stupid smirk off your face Billingsley\" The feisty redhead replied \"Danneel\" he chuckled \"Long time no see\" \"Which I consider a great thing\" she said attempting to brush past him but was stopped by his touch. \"You weren't saying that this summer\" he cockily smiled \"You know when we hooked up! Remember that night?\" \"Okay! That night we were both wasted and didn't know what the hell we were doing\" she replied \"Well, It sounded like I knew what I was doing\" he chuckled \"You know what the hell I mean\" she scoffed \"And that night remains between us Don\" Danneel pleaded staring around making sure no one was around \"Alright? I'm serious\" \"Well duh if my boy Mike knew we slept together he'd be pretty upset\" \"Mike? Winchell?\" she smiled \"What does he have to do with this?\" \"Oh nothing\" Don chuckled walking backwards \"What do you know that I don't?\" she chuckled watching him get further down the hall \"Plenty!\" he smiled before turning on his heel, and walking in the direction of the main office. Sara sat at the main desk filing papers for the principal. Don walked in and saw her and took a sigh a relief. \"Thank god, you're here\" he said walking up to the desk \"Can you get rid of this detention slip for me?\" Sara knew it was Don, but she didn't stop for one second to even look at him. \"Sara?\" he replied, wondering why she was ignoring here. Sara finished filing there papers before moving on to her next tasks which was copying papers. \"You are ignoring me I see?\" Sara gave him a hard glare before turning back to what she was doing. \"Why do you insist on holding grudges toward me?\" he asked Sara stared at the copy machine then up at Don \"Why aren't you in class?\" she finally said \"Detention slip needs to be signed by the principal\" he said showing her the light pink slip \"He's busy!\" \"Sara, come on\" Don said sitting on the main desk \"Why the hell are you so stubborn?\" \"Why are you such a jerk?\" \"I'm not a jerk, I'm just honest!\" \"Give me the slip and get the hell out!\" She folded her arms \"See there you go running again!\" he shook his head Sara glared at him with her bright green eyes. \"You can't run forever Underwood!\" he yelled \"Your problems aren't just going to disappear, just because you are ignoring them\" Sara chuckled sarcastically \"Says the guy who goes and get himself belligerent and fuck different girls every night so that he won't have to put up with his abusive alcoholic dad\" she harshly shot. Don eyes widened, before he stared down and then back at Sara \"You know what?\" he replied getting up \"Fuck you! I'm done!\" he said crumbling up the pink slip and throwing it, but purposely missing her. \"I'm done trying to be this perfect boyfriend for the perfect Sara Underwood. \"Good because I been done with you!\" she said with her arms folded staring down, really trying to fight back tears. Don looked at her with his crystal blue eyes before shaking his head while leaving the office. Sara rolled her eyes and went back to what she was doing. As Don left the office the final bell of the school day sounded. He furiously stormed passed a bunch of his peers that crowed the halls, making his way to the locker rooms. Further behind, Katerina and Briana walked side by side. \"That class is going to be so hard\" Briana whined about the class she and Katerina just had together \"Bri it's a music class\" Katerina stared \"It's like an easy A pretty much\" \"That's easy for you to say, you're a singer!\" Briana pouted \"I don't even like music\" \"Then why'd you sign up for it!\" \"I don't know\" she leaned against the lockers \"Well let's go to the office, maybe Sara's there and she could help you transfer out of it\" Katerina offered \"Uh great idea but, not today I have to meet Chavez before he goes to practice\" she smiled \"We have a little session to attend to in the parking lot, if you know what I mean\" she winked nudging Katerina \"Okay eww, too much information honey\" she replied Briana giggled, before she began walking toward the main exit. Katerina chuckled at her promiscuous friend, before walking the opposite way. Her light brown eyes drew upon three very well known players one which whom she was dating. \"Comer, Winchell, Chavez\" Katerina smiled facing the three players \"Hey baby\" Chris sweetly smiled, giving her a hug and a kiss \"Hey Katerina!\" Brian and Mike said in unison \"How was your first day?\" she asked Chris \"First, have you seen Briana?\" Chavez asked Katerina \"Oh yeah she was headed toward your car in the main parking lot a while ago\" \"We all know what that means\" Mike teased \"I mean man is that all you two do\" Chris chuckled \"Pretty much\" Chavez laughed \"But, I'll see you guys at practice\" he said running toward the exit. \"See yall later\" Mike replied walking away from the couple. Mike managed to cross paths with his \"rival\" Danneel in the process. As if it was meant to be evil stares the two could not keep their eyes off of each other. Katerina chuckled at the two. \"Why don't those two just get together already\" she smirked at Mike and Danneel \"Who knows?\" Chris said as he and Katerina walked hand and hand down the hall. \"But, trust me it's bound to happen\" \"I already know!\" Katerina replied \"So, are you coming to watch me practice?\" \"Don't I always!\" she smirked \"True\" he said facing her \"Can I ask you a random question though?\" \"Shoot?\" \"We've been dating for a couple months now, but known each other for years\" he said \"I know\" she smiled stopping in front of him knowing where this conversation was going. \"So when…when are ...we?\" he stuttered with nervousness \"Going to be on the same level as Brian and Briana?\" she chuckled \"Well yeah…\" he replied Katerina hazel eyes stared into the bright eyes of Chris, before standing on her tip toes to kiss him sweetly. \"Whenever you are ready\" she told him \"I been ready\" he eagerly said Katerina chuckled at his excitement \"So after practice, you can come to my place\" she shrugged \"You know, my mom works all the way in the next county so she doesn't get home till late\" Chris smiled kissing her once again \"Will do\" he whispered \"Okay! Go get dressed I'll see you out on the field\" she replied Chris smiled as he nodded and began to walk away…. Katerina turned on her heels and also headed for the other exit… PLEASE REVIEW!

Chapter 3: Using your \"head\" Sara sat in her Odessa home that night miserable. Being the towns sheriff her dad often worked late nights, so she was always home alone, which is kind of how she liked it. She ran her fingers through her long blonde hair as she thought about her stressful day. Sara had such a long day, and her breakup with Don was already over the entire town. She laid on her bed, stomach down in nothing but a long white t-shirt and pink panties. Sara really wasn't in the mood to talk to anyone but she couldn't resist the phone call she was receiving from her best friend Katerina. Katerina Graham was waiting for her boyfriend Chris to come out of the locker-room. She knew after practice he liked to shower and clean up so she waited a little longer. It didn't take her long to find out about the second Don and Sara episode that took place that afternoon, but she felt bad for Sara hearing the final outcome of their argument, and being the best friend she was she just wanted to be with Sara during her time of need. Sara watched her phone ring a little longer before finally picking up. \"Hey Kat, I know why you're calling and I'm fine\" Sara immediately said when putting her phone to her ear \"Just making sure\" Katerina replied \"What happened?\" \"I'm sure you heard by now\" Sara answered \"No I heard rumors, I want the real story\" Katerina said seeing some of the players walking out of the locker-room none she really talked to before \"Well, this morning it really just came out of nowhere he just went on about how I'm never there or too busy and what not, so this afternoon I gave him the silent treatment and he was rude to me saying I shut people out\" Sara explained \"And.. I may have crossed the line with saying stuff about him and his dad's relationship but he pushed me too it\" \"Wow!\" Kat replied \"So who broke up with whom?\" \"He broke up with me\" Sara said sitting up \"Well, if it makes you feel any better the word around school is you broke up with him\" \"No exactly, but thanks for trying\" Sara told Katerina shrugged seeing Briana from afar, looking as though she just got out of cheerleading practice. Briana smiled and waved as she head over to the brown-eyed beauty. Back in the football locker-room, Chris Comer stepped out of the shower with a white towel wrapped around his waist. He was excited for about his night with Katerina that he couldn't stop smiling. He wanted everything to go smoothly and perfectly; so he knew he had to really be \"prepared\". Chris sighed before he walked over and approached Don and Chavez. \"What's up guys?\" Don gave Chris a nod as he put on his shirt \"What been up with you?\" Chavez asked Chris \"You've been extra happy for some reason\" \"No reason in particular\" he answered \"But, I need a little something\" he told the two \"What's up\" Chavez asked \"Do either of you have a….\" he whispered not wanting the entire team to know \"A?\" Don asked confused \"You know a…\" he still held back \"Good god Comer spit it out!\" Don bluntly ordered Chris looked around and leaned in closer to Don and Chavez \"A condom\" he finally said \"That's it!\" Chavez shook his head in laughter \"What do you need one for?\" Don asked \"Why do any of us need them Don\" Chavez said \"I know, but I didn't think him and Kat were on that level yet\" \"Well, we weren't but tonight's the night\" Chris told them \"Oh well, sorry but my session this afternoon wiped me out\" Chavez shrugged placing his duffle bag on his shoulder \"Don?\" Chris asked Don nodded before fumbling through his duffle bag and handing Chris a couple of condoms. \"Thanks!\" Chris smiled walking back to his locker Chavez nudged Don, ready to leave \"Have fun tonight\" Don chuckled at Chris as him and Chavez walked out of the locker-room \"Plan on it\" he said as he finished getting dressed. Back outside the three girls continued their conversation. \"Well, Sara keep your head up if it's meant to be then it will\" Briana said as Kat now had her phone on speaker \"Yeah, we should hook you up with someone to make him jealous\" Katerina suggested \"Yes that's a brilliant idea\" Briana squealed \"Uh… No thanks!\" Sara said \"I might just stay single for awhile, guys want to much these days\" \"Not more than Don Billingsley\" Kat replied \"Yeah, you guys don't have to date just hook up with him, that'll really make him jealous\" Briana explained \"Look I wouldn't have sex with my childhood sweetheart what makes you think I'm about to hook up with some random guy\" Sara confessed Briana and Katerina looked at one another in confusion \"Uh, honey can you repeat that\" Briana said \"Repeat what?\" \"You and Don never?\" Kat asked \"Oh had sex\" Sara said \"Yeah, never!\" \"Oh my god!\" Briana shouted \"Why?\" Katerina asked \"Just too risky, I'm trying to be on the right path and I don't have time to be stopped by a unplanned baby\" Sara explained \"I believe the correct term for that is condom\" Briana yelled through the phone \"They're on ninety-eight percent effective\" Sara said like the goody-two-shoes she is. Katerina shook her head in disbelief \"Shock of the day!\" \"And on top of that he's Don Billingsley\" Sara said \"He's reckless, I'm not risking catching a STD or anything either\" she rolled her eyes in thoughts of him, and all the cheating stories she has been told before. \"I hate to say it but…\" Katerina sighed \"But what?\" Sara shot \"Maybe that's why he gets it from other girls, because his own girlfriend isn't giving it to him \" \"Agreed\" Briana said next \"Not true, cheating is a choice!\" Sara argued \"So clear this up, you two have done nothing?\" Briana asked \"Nope!\" \"At all?\" \"I mean we did some stuff\" Sara gave in \"Like?\" Katerina asked \"Kiss\" \"And?\" Briana said \"Ugh, okay we gave each other hand jobs a few times\" \"That's it?\" Briana grinned \"I was doing that in the ninth grade\" \"And…\" Sara hesitated \"He gave me oral sex a few times\" \"That's more like it\" Kat grinned \"Did you do him?\" Sara ran her fingers through her hair \"No\" she confessed Katerina and Briana both gave each other a look and shook their heads in unison. \"Well, he's pleasing you, but it doesn't sound like you're pleasing him\" Briana explained \"Well who cares\" Sara yelled \"And Kat you have nerve you haven't had sex with Chris yet\" \"Well, tomorrow I won't be able to say the same\" she smiled a little as Briana stared at her \"Tonight's the night!\" Sara stared down and rubbed her forehead as Briana grinned \"So Sara you're the only virgin left\" Briana said \"Whatever!\" Sara softly replied with her head down as her insecurities began to sink in once again. \"Oh be quiet, here comes Don and Chavez\" Katerina said quickly putting her phone down \"Hey baby!\" Briana said hugging Chavez \"Donnie!\" Katerina and Briana said in unison as they looked him up and down with disgust \"I know those looks!\" he said \"And I don't care for them much, so I'm leaving\" he told them putting his hands in his jean jacket \"See you, Chavo\" Chavez nodded at Don before focusing his attention to Briana \"So you're place or mine?\" she asked grabbing her cheer bag \"I was kind of hoping we can go out and grab a bite or something\" he said Briana stared strangely at him before turning to Katerina who smiled at the couple \"Uh… sure okay! Then after?\" she asked \"You go to your house and I go to mine\" he said \"Oh uh… sure\" she replied putting on a fake smiled but on the inside feeling a bit down. Katerina smiled and waved at the two as they walked away… She put the phone back to her ear but then was blinded by two hands covering her eyes from behind \"Guess who?\" \"Not sure but the name Chris Comer is coming to mind\" she smiled, before turning to see her brown-eyed boo. \"Hey, sorry I had you waiting are you ready?\" \"Hold on!\" She held up one finger, putting the phone back to her ear \"Sara?\" \"Yeah, just go I have an important call coming in anyway\" Sara told her hearing Chris in the background \"Okay, see you tomorrow!\" Katerina said before she hung up her phone. Sara shrugged and sighed as she clicked over to her other line, for a call she was expecting all night \"Hey, was waiting for you to call, looks like my schedule just opened up so you can come over\" she answered The guy on the other end of the receiver smiled and nodded \"Thanks, I just got out of practice so I'll be over in a few\" he told her \"Cool!\" Sara smiled, before hanging up the phone, as she walked over to her closet to put on more clothes. Back at the school, Danneel was the last of the cheerleaders to get dressed. She hated the fact she didn't have a car and had to walk home, but at the same time she loved her alone time. Mike wrapped his duffle bag around him as he walked out of the main locker-room doors. It took a double take for him to notice Danneel walking alone from afar. The frustrated part of him wanted to leave her behind and not look back but the compassionate part of him couldn't. He ran to his car and quickly put it in gear. Mike admitted to liking Danneel, but honestly another side of him couldn't stand her attitude. Danneel zipped up her coat as she walked along the school on the sidewalk. Headlights behind her caused her to turn her head but, she couldn't tell who it was so she went back to minding her own business. Mike sighed as he slowly pulled up next to Danneel in his car, and rolled down his window. \"Need a ride?\" he politely asked her Danneel's heart dropped when she finally realized it was Mike. \"From you?\" she asked \"Do you see anyone else around?\" Danneel folded her arms and stared. \"Gas isn't cheap so yes or no?\" he told her as he car was still running Danneel sighed tucking a piece of her red hair behind her ear. \"Sure\" she gave in, as she walked around to the passenger's side of his car. Something came over Mike when Danneel got into the passenger's seat. He felt his throat getting dry his palms sweating, and his heart racing. \"So where are you going?\" Mike asked \"I stay on Persian road\" she nervously said \"Right down the street?\" he sarcastically replied \"Yes!\" she chuckled \"I should have told you I lived pretty close, I could still walked\" she objected \"No it's fine\" Mike smiled \"I don't mind, going up the street\" Danneel put her hand over her face and giggled \"Is that a smile?\" he replied \"What?\" \"It's just I never seen you smile before!\" he told her \"You always look so evil!\" \"Evil!\" Danneel argued \"You know it's true so don't get defensive\" he exclaimed \"And I like it\" he admitted as Danneel stared \"Your smile, you should use it more often\" Danneel blushed a bit as she sat back in her seat, and stared out the window. \"Can I ask you a question?\" he said turning on her street \"You can, but it doesn't mean I'm going to answer\" she smirked \"Why are you afraid to show the world the real you?\" he bravely said \"Huh?\" \"You heard me!\" \"Last house on the left\" she directed as he drove \"Don't change the subject\" he said \"I'm not, this is the real me\" \"I doubt it\" he said finally stopping in front of her house, putting his car in park \"What makes you think it's not?\" she folded her arm, beginning to get sassy \"Gestures like that\" he noticed \"You get so offended when people call you out about it\" \"Because I hate people questioning me and they don't know me\" \"Well, you don't give us a chance to know you\" he shot back Danneel rolled her eyes and shook her head \"Thanks for the ride\" she said opening the car door but was stopped by Mike who grabbed her arm gently but firm \"Stop running!\" he yelled \"Who are you to tell me what to do\" she replied yanking her arm away from him \"Maybe someone that cares\" he said \"Care?\" she shot slamming the door \"Winchell you don't even like me\" she finished the conversation through the window, before storming away \"Or you're just too blind to see that I do\" he said, loud enough before simply driving off. Danneel stopped in her tracks hearing him say that would usually make her day, but that night it didn't… \"Maybe you're right\" she whispered to herself, as she walked up to her front door… Back at the Underwood's Sara's visitor had shown up. \"I'm really glad you're doing this Sara\" the guy smiled \"Me too! It definitely helps me clear my head\" she told him with the same long white shirt, but with denim shorts now under it. \"Ok now…\" she started to speak but was interrupted by a knock on her door. Sara sighed getting up from the couch, as she wasn't expecting anyone else. She opened the door and immediately her bright green eyes widened. \"Don?\" she said seeing her now ex boyfriend Don Billingsley before her very eyes \"What are you doing here?\" she asked closing the door a little so he wouldn't see who was on the inside. \"I'm sorry about what happened earlier\" he sighed putting his hands in his pockets \"Oh\" she looked down \"I didn't want it to end like that\" he confessed \"I didn't want it to end at all\" Sara stared into his blue eyes before smiling a little \"Well, I'm sorry too, I was being a brat and I crossed the line\" \"We both said things we didn't mean…\" he said Sara nodded her head in agreement before silence surfaced \"So what does this mean?\" Don asked \"Well…\" Sara spoke but a men's voice from behind interrupted \"Sara?\" the guy on the inside replied coming to the door. Don saw someone he wasn't expecting \"Boobie?\" Don said, as his face began to turn red \"Wait!\" Sara told him \"What the hell is he doing here?\" Don yelled Boobie shook his head not wanting to really get involved as he went back to the couch. \"Babe this isn't…\" Sara tried to explain \"Fuck it! I don't care\" he continued to be furious as he tried to bomb rush his way inside but Sara held him back \"Just let me explain!\" \"No! Fuck it! Just leave me alone\" he said walking backwards \"Don!\" Sara yelled seeing him leave \"Stay the fuck away from me\" he lastly said before getting back into his car, leaving a torn Sara on her front porch alone… \"Sara… Are you okay?\" Boobie said coming outside with his book bag, on his back \"Uh yeah\" she replied wiping her tears, \"You don't have to leave, I can finish helping you study\" she told him \"No, trust me you been enough help, and besides I told my uncle I'd be home 30 minutes ago\" he objected \"And thanks to you I think I actually have a chance of passing this placement test\" he smiled Sara smiled a little, watching the street Don drove off on, hoping he would come back. Boobie looked down the same street; she couldn't take her eyes off of. \"Sara, it'll be okay, you can do better\" Boobie told her \"You give and give, and you deserves someone whose going to give back\" Sara looked down then at Boobie \"Thanks!\" \"No problem, Thank you again!\" he told her \"And trust me, things will look up soon enough\" he lastly said before getting into his car Sara hung her head low before turning in walking into her house. She immediately turned off all of the lights and went to her room. She turned on her stereo and blasted one of her favorite Hinder songs. I just wanna be alone tonight I just wanna take a little breather 'Cause lately all we do is fight And every time it cuts me deeper 'Cause something's changed You've been acting so strange And it's taking its toll on me It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave Without you, I live it up a little more every day Without you, I'm seeing myself so differently I didn't wanna believe it then but it all worked out in the end When I watched you walk away, well, I never thought I'd say I'm fine without you She laid on her bed, and buried her face into her pillow as tears began to fall down her face. Don had parked on the side of the road and pulled out his cell phone, dialing on a \"friends\" number. \"Hey\" she said on the receiver \"What's up Maria\" he replied \"You still up for tonight?\" he asked \"Always!\" she said \"I'll be waiting\" she sexily replied before hanging up Don smile faded as he knew this isn't what he wanted. For the first time he was feeling how Sara might have been feeling for years after catching him cheating over and over. He was crushed and disappointed, and at this point sex was the only thing that could make him feel, a tad bit better. He finally shook out of his trance before he drove off to meet his late night session. Brian Chavez and girlfriend Briana Evigan were at a local dinner. Chavez was really attracted to Briana but he wanted her to feel special. He wanted her to feel like they had a deeper connection then just sex. They cuddled up in a booth as they waited for their food to be brought to them. Briana knew she didn't have anything in common with Chavez, so she wanted to keep him the best way she knew how, which was sex. She gently began kissing on his neck… \"Come on, let's get out of here\" she whispered between kisses \"We haven't even eaten yet\" he argued \"But, I'm not hungry\" she whined \"And I am\" \"I have something for you to eat\" she smirked \"Bri, chill\" Chavez said pulling away \"What's your problem?\" Briana replied, folding her arms \"Just because I don't want to have sex all the time means I have a problem?\" he glared \"It means something?\" she got louder \"Yeah, in fact it does!\" he argued \"It means I want something more with you than sex\" Briana stared strangely \"Like?\" \"Like!\" Chavez ordered \"I want to be emotionally and mentally attracted to you as much as I am physically if not more, and honestly at this point I'm not\" he confessed Briana shook her head and looked out the window, disappointed \"I want to be honest\" he continued \"If you leave tomorrow I wouldn't be heartbroken, because I'm not emotionally attached to you\" Briana knew this day was bound to happen, she just didn't think it would be this soon \"I think I'm going to walk home\" she told him, before slowly getting up \"Babe\" he softly said \"No it's fine!\" she put on a fake smile through the tears \"I'm fine, I just need some air\" she said before walking out of the diner Chavez shook his head and buried his face in his hands, not really thinking his night was going to end like this… Chris looked into his girlfriend's Katerina's bright eyes and smiled, as the two laid under the covers bare. \"Are you sure you want to do this?\" he asked stroking her hair gently Katerina sat up and leaned down on her elbow \"I know I am\" she told him He smiled slowly positioned himself on top of her. \"Are you okay?\" he softly asked \"Yes\" she smiled, putting her hands around his neck and pulling him in for a kiss \"You?\" \"I'm alright!\" he said pulling apart \"But, I'm glad it's you\" \"I'm glad it's me too\" she joked \"No, but seriously, I'm glad I waited for you… we waited for each other\" \"Me too baby!\" he smirked Katerina ran her hands down Chris muscular back and began kissing him on the neck Chris smiled as he leaned down to kiss her on the lips. The two spent a few good minutes passionately making out, before their night progressed into so much more… Hours had gone by and it seems as though the whole town of Odessa was asleep, except for one particular Billingsley. Don drove passed Sara's house multiple times that night after leaving Maria's. He wanted so badly to be with her, but then again he hated being tied down. Don second guessed himself before finally parking across the street. He saw Sara dad's car in the driveway, so he decided to do a sneak in, a method him and Sara came up with a while back. Sara living in a one story house was definitely an advantage. He quietly snuck around back and climbed through a few bushes to get to Sara's bedroom window. He looked on the inside and saw Sara fast asleep. Don hesitated before he knocked on her window, loud enough for her to hear and quiet enough for her dad not too. Sara budged in her sleep, hearing a knock, but didn't fully wake. Don rolled his eyes and knock again. She finally sat up and took a look around, her eyes red and puffy from all her crying. Sara looked at her door where she thought the knock was coming from then at her window, seeing Don's familiar face. She got out of her bed in her night wear a black tank top and black panties with yellow polka dots, and headed toward the window. Don waited for her to open the window as he stared around to make sure no one saw him… Sara unlocked and pulled up her window. \"If you're here to yell at me some more my dad's home, so can it wait till tomorrow\" She said sitting in the window ceil. \"I'm not here for that\" he sighed \"Then what?\" \"Why Boobie\" he asked \"That's all I want to know, out of everyone it had to be him\" Sara sarcastically chuckled and shook her head, walking into her room. \"Eleven years and you still don't know me\" she told him Don stared as he climbed into her room through the window \"Boobie, Sara! Come on\" \"I was helping him study\" she raised her voice a tad \"We have the same Anthropology class and we have a placement test tomorrow, I said I would help him study for because he didn't want to end up in a lower class again\" she explained Don stared down the back at her \"God! Do you really think I'm that type of girl? Friend?\" \"No!\" Don argued \"I just…\" \"Wasn't thinking\" She said \"I would never go after your teammate, and especially ones you had a problem with in the past\" \"I guess I should have known that\" he said leaning against the wall \"You would have if you weren't so short tempered and you let me explain like I was trying to\" she told him \"I know\" he said looking down \"And I'm sorry\" Sara took a deep breath of frustration, before staring at him. She knew why Don was so messed up in the head, and had so much trouble with trusting people and becoming attached to people. \"I don't know what to do anymore Donnie\" Sara confessed, sitting on her bed \"What do you mean?\" he stared \"I try and I try but…\" \"Please don't give up on me\" he stared down \"You're pretty much all I have left\" Sara looked down \"Why do you want me anyway?\" Don stared \"Exactly that reason\" he told her \"You stuck around when no one else did\" Sara slightly smiled before standing up and approaching him. She looked at him and was mesmerized by his deep blue crystal eyes. \"I want to kiss you and punch you in the face all at the same time\" she whispered Don smiled as he leaned in to kiss Sara, who embraced him, by wrapping his arms around his neck. Don knew Sara and her rules, and even if she would magically want to that night he couldn't because of what he did with Maria not even two hours ago. Don pulled apart, as he leaned his forehead against Sara's. \"I think I should go\" he whispered \"No, stay\" she lightly said kissing him again Don quickly pulled away \"I can't, you are going to start something you don't want to finish\" he chuckled \"Who says this time won't be different?\" Don stared at her, and thoughts of his session with Maria came to mind. \"No I can't\" \"Why?\" she asked \"You've always wanted to\" \"Because…. I…\" he thought fast \"Don't have protection\" he lied Sara stared and looked down, before a brilliant plan came to mind \"Well, you don't need protection for everything\" she smirked grabbing his hand and leading him toward her bed. Sara sat Don down, before she got down on her knees \"Wait, no you don't have too\" he said knowing where her actions were going, \"I know, that's why I want to\" she smiled. He stared down and watched Sara. He tried so hard to keep himself from rising, but between her little attire and something as small and gently as her touch, he couldn't help it. She parted his legs a bit, before unzipping his pants. She sighed as she looked up at him and kissed him one last time, before finally going down on him. Don couldn't help but groan in pleasure. Sara smiled at how she for once felt as though she was pleasing him. He ran his fingers through her blonde hair as she continued, to suck on him, moaning in the process. Moments passed before Don sat Sara's head up, as he felt himself releasing. She got off of her knees and leaned in to kiss him. Sara had Don feeling so good that for a second he lost his morals, and so did she. He laid back with his pants still down and her on top. She sat up on him in straddle position as she removed her tank top. His hand then went up her stomach and to her breasts as he helped her by removing her bra. Sara smiled and slowly turned over on her back. Don quickly got on top and removed his jacket and shirt. He sexually began kissing on her stomach and sucking on her chest. \"I waited so long for this\" he whispered, before motioned his hands down to her black and yellow panties slowly removing them. \"Just be gentle\" she told him \"It's my first time\" He nodded, when completely removing his ankle length pants off completely. Without hesitation Don gently inserted himself into Sara unprotected, a loud moan caused her to grip him close. She almost couldn't take the pain as she resisted a bit. \"You okay?\" he sincerely asked, before he continued. Something he's never done to any girl before. Sara looked at him in his eyes and nodded \"Yes\" with a gentle smile \"I love you Sara Underwood\" he took the time to whisper \"I love you too Don Billingsley\" she smiled Don smiled, and realized she was the only girl he really cared about. He leaned in to kiss her as the two had a very passionate rest of the night… Please Review (The more reviews the faster the updates)!

He watched as Shelley used the swab to coat the scrape along his knuckles, her usually cheerful disposition fixed with concentration. When she finished, she disposed of the bloodied swab into the garbage and carefully guided Ricky over to the sink. Turning on the faucet, she used the running water to carefully rinse the cut once more. \"We won't put a bandage over it because you gotta have it exposed to oxygen,\" she advised once she was finished tending to him. Then she went ahead and washed her hands clean. \"Did you know that oxygen helps cuts heal faster? People put band-aids over 'em but that's not always a good thing, y'know? Well, of course if it's a huge bloody gash, then yeah, it'd be a good idea to wrap that sucker up tight and take you to the E.R. as soon as possible!\" \"That so.\" Ricky carefully wiggled his fingers and winced at the soreness and the cool sting of his cut as he leaned against the sink. \"Damn.\" Shelley dried her hands on the towel. \"Thanks again for helping John. You really saved him back there.\" Her younger brother had just started his first year of high school. He was quirky like his sister and an overall good kid, but painfully awkward and meek looking. He was an easy target for bullies and there were a few times where Shelley stepped in to dissuade any fights. It had always worked, at least, until the most recent encounter. The moment Ricky saw one of the boys take an aggressive hold of Shelley, that was when he went on the offense. Shelley had never seen Ricky look so furious before. The quiet young man before her looked different from the one just hours ago brawling against a group of thugs who thought they could get away with picking on people weaker than them. Narrowed eyes, snarled lips, clenched fists, the harsh sounds his voice made when he breathed… Ricky looked absolutely dangerous. But that didn't stop her from caring for him. She was now standing between his legs, cradling his head against her chest. Her fingers raked through his thick, wavy hair as she felt his hands gently rest on her hips. \"I didn't do it for John,\" he confessed quietly, his fingers stroking the fabric of her denim jeans. Her heart suddenly started beating faster. \"I know.\" \"The next time anybody touches you like that again, I swear to God...!\" \"I know.\" Her legs trembled as she hugged him close, trying very hard not to suffocate him. She wore a great big smile on her face as she realized how much this boy meant to her, and how far he'd go to protect her. She never imaged wanting to give him so much of herself. \"Still, thanks for doing what you did back there. John thinks the world of you. And hey, you know how much I like you, too.\" Ricky lifted his head and stared into her tender gaze. \"That right?\" Her face was aglow as she simply answered with a chirpy, \"Yup!\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners. \"Patching Up\" Ricky gnashed his tee"},{"Movie":"My Bodyguard","Title":"All the right moves","Author":"VoyagerG","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5904819","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Much thanks to MarieDee, a great FF author of My Bodyguard stories, for encouraging me to continue the story of Ricky and Evie. All the Right Moves \"Who knew you were such a clown? If you don't follow the pattern correctly, you'll never learn to dance.\" Evie Samuels gently scolded her new friend Ricky Linderman. \"I'm sorry, but the footsteps keep sliding all over the place. It's throwing me off.\" \"That's not the problem, when I say go left, you go right, when I say right foot forward, you put the left one backward.\" \"Are you saying I'm dumb, Evie?\" \"No, of course not. You're just concentrating too hard and making mistakes. Dancing should be free flowing, it has to appear effortless.\" Evie, Ricky, Clifford and Shelly spent Saturday afternoon in Evie's furnished basement. They attempted to brush up on their basic dance moves before the Sophomore spring dance the following Friday. \"I cut the feet out evenly. Maybe I should tape them to the floor, but I don't want to ruin it.\" Evie said. \"Ruin it? Evie, this is cement tiling. It's alright, I'm just not paying attention.\" He gazed at her until she turned away and blushed hard. \"What?\" \"Ricky, I'm trying very hard to help you guys since you all claim you can't dance. Give me some credit.\" Evie pouted. Ricky laughed and plopped on the big orange futon. He dug into the cooler and snapped open a can of coke. Shelly and Clifford decided to take a walk to the pizzeria a few blocks down and pick up dinner for the group. \"Evie, you're teaching us to waltz, it's so stiff and formal, you know nobody is gonna be dancing like this.\" \"Yes they will, in a way. It's technically called a Spring Formal .\" Evie sighed and adjusted the feet patterns in their proper place. \"Ricky, it's all basic box steps, once you get this down, then you can throw in all the twists and shimmies you want. Just do not try and do the John Travolta dance from Saturday Night fever . I don't know what it is, but anyone else who does it looks totally corny.\" She giggled and sat next to him. \"Darn, I was hoping to wear my white leisure suit too.\" Ricky smiled and put the coke can down. He crossed his leg and held his ankle and glanced favorably around the basement; it was almost like a small apartment, with a bathroom, kitchenette, refrigerator and a round wooden dining table. Clifford thought the table would be great for a poker night. The door at the top of the stairwell remained slightly ajar and Evie's mother puttered around upstairs. She was very glad to meet all of Evie's new friends, but that didn't stop her from keeping a watchful eye. Evie wrung her hands between her legs and rocked. \"Why are you so nervous?\" Ricky asked. Evie swung around with widened eyes. \"Me? I'm not nervous. Do I look it?\" \"Heck yeah. Sit back and chill, we've been at this dancing stuff all afternoon, I think I got the hang of it.\" \"Yeah, now that I only have three toes left that aren't broken.\" Evie said with hints of amusement in her eyes. Ricky lowered his leg and playfully nudged her. \"I'm not that bad at it. I'll never be Baryshnikov, but who cares? It's just a school dance.\" \"Well, I do, because I don't want you to suddenly become a wallflower on me. It will force me to dance with all the other guys.\" She teased. Ricky clutched Evie's hand and moved closer. \"Hey, I came this far, didn't I? If I really didn't want to do this, I wouldn't have. I'm not wishy-washy. Besides, you all conned me into going and I am. As long as I'm there, I'm not letting anyone take my girl.\" Evie glanced up at him open-mouthed. \"Conned? Who conned? All I did was ask you with a little encouragement from Clifford. I…I…Ricky…\" Evie lowered her eyes bashfully. \"Did you just say I'm your girl?\" Ricky bit his lip; the words slipped out of his mouth without second thoughts or apprehensions. He had to man up. He gently put a hand on her cheek and raised her face so she could look him in the eyes. \"Yeah, I did, Evie.\" \"Do you really mean it?\" Ricky felt the anticipating shudder that ran through her attack his gut. His gaze flitted back and forth, a quirky sign he was in deep consideration. She was so pretty and sweet. It surprised him that none of the other guys at school took much notice of her, though he understood why. The color issue. Poor Evie was caught in the middle of a war and struggled to remain neutral. She passed more for white than black, but she was always shunned. Ricky didn't care either way. It was the beauty inside her that mattered most to him. He slowly ran his thumb across her face and over her lips. He saw the move in countless movies as a prelude to a delightful kiss. \"I don't say things I don't mean, Evie. You'll learn that about me.\" He whispered and pulled her closer. \"I want to learn everything about you, Ricky.\" She murmured. \"Okay, I'd like to tell you a lot. And there's something you really need to know.\" He frowned, then shook off the foreboding feeling. It wasn't time. The better Evie got to know him, the easier it would be for her to fathom the truth about the night his brother died and still accept him. He didn't want to ruin the mood. Ricky's mouth brushed hers slightly and they pulled apart a little embarrassed. Ricky still held her gaze and came up with another truth, even though it hurt him to admit it. \"Here's one, Evie. I never kissed a girl before.\" Evie pursed her lips and shook her head. She stayed silent. She understood how much of a loner Ricky was because of his tragic secret, but she couldn't let on that she knew it. Ricky almost panicked. \"Does that bother you? What's wrong?\" Evie stared at him. \"Why would it bother me? Neither have I, so we're even.\" Ricky grinned, relieved. \"But have you kissed a guy before?\" Evie pinched him. \"Ricky! You know what I meant. I've…I've never been kissed either.\" He sat back. \"That's awesome.\" \"Why? Because I'm not used goods?\" \"Evie, I don't think that way. It's just a guy thing, okay? Don't sweat it. I think we should change that now.\" \"Me too. It's humiliating.\" \"Is it? Doesn't matter to me, but then again, I'm not swapping stories with the guys either. They're all a bunch of liars anyway. How much do they know at fifteen?\" \"Right. You probably know a lot more than them, you're sixteen.\" Evie said bluntly. Ricky was held back a year for missing so much school. Ricky slowly rose and drew her up with him. He raised her arms over his neck and put his hands on her waist. \"I think I got this right.\" \"It feels right.\" She said and stood on her toes. Even though she was taller than a lot of the girls, Ricky was still the biggest boy in school. Ricky's hands slid up her back and his face quickly met hers. He had to do this now or she would probably think he was a complete narc. Their lips pressed firmly together and Evie impulsively roved her lips over his mouth. Ricky followed her lead and then she allowed him to take over. They parted and smiled at each other. \"Ricky, that was great. You're so amazing.\" She complimented love struck. Ricky wanted to let out a holler of delight, but held his emotions in check. He rushed to the stereo system and put on the record. He grasped her hand and swooped her to the center. Catching the beat, he attempted The Hustle. \"I told you I got the hang of this!\" He said as they danced around the room like crazy. \"You sure did! Wait until Grandma Peache see's you.\" The back door opened and Clifford and Shelly followed the delicious scent of garlic and tomatoes. Clifford started laughing. \"Look Shell, I think Ricky's finally got it. Who knew Frankenstein's monster could bust a move?\" He cut across the room to avoid getting knocked into the wall, and put the pizza boxes on the table. \"Hey! I'm not the one with two left feet, Jerry Lewis.\" Ricky grumbled. \"I hope you got more than one pie, because I'm starving.\" \"Sure, one for you, and one for the rest of us.\" Clifford grinned. When Ricky practically floated by him, Clifford raised his thumb up slyly. Ricky did the same and dipped Evie dramatically. They nuzzled in the corner rose quick when they sensed an audience again. Shelly came to the table and while Clifford put out the drinks she caught Evie's eye. They winked at one another and Shelly hurried to set down the paper plates. She stood beside Clifford to watch the remainder of the dance. \"Wow, Ricky's doing okay. You see, that's what I was trying to tell you, Cliff. You have to loosen up, once you can do the box-step, you can do anything. Look at them, those two just have all the right moves.\" The End.

Maybe you just need to learn how to pin a flower.\" Clifford rolled his eyes at his gigantic friend and finally pinned the pink carnation to Ricky's jacket to complete his look. Two days prior, and much to Ricky's chagrin, he realized the spring formal was a colorful fifties sock hop theme. It wasn't mandatory to dress the era, but it was appreciated. Clifford didn't understand how Ricky missed all the huge posters around school, not to mention all the chatter, but Linderman wasn't one to stop and notice high school happenings and what he called frivolity. Although he ebbed out of his hardened shell, Ricky still lumbered through the halls in his green jacket, keeping his focus either cast downward or straight ahead staring into space. The only times Clifford really noticed a spark of enthusiasm in Ricky's eyes was when they hung out and worked on his new automotive projects in the junkyard. And now, whenever Evalyn Samuels was near. Clifford's dad gave the boys a neat idea to wear white sport coats with carnations pinned to their breast. He said in his youth there was a famous love song just about that – A young man crooned how his girl spurned him just before the dance. Shelly decided to wear a red shirred top dress, so Clifford wore a red flower. Ricky wasn't so fortunate. Pink was one of Evie's favorite colors. Evie's dress was a pink taffeta halter-top with a large bow design on the lower back. Ricky and Clifford stood at attention before the mirror in Clifford's hotel bedroom. Clifford went to touch his hair; Grandma Peache went a little heavy on the Dippity-do to keep his curls from springing out. Ricky jokingly called Clifford's pushback a 'Great Gatsby' and told him it was about time he lost the fro. Grandma Peache styled Ricky's hair in a side-part, but thankfully didn't use as much hair product. Ricky pulled Clifford's elbow down and forced his hands to his sides. \"Don't you dare touch it, not after she worked so hard on that tumbleweed.\" Clifford crossed his arms offended. \"Will you stop picking on my hair?\" Ricky grinned. \"But it's so easy to. I wonder what the girls are gonna do with their poufy do's?\" \"They wouldn't breathe a word about it, I asked. They want us to be surprised.\" Clifford faced his best friend. \"Are you sure you're ready for this? It's a big step for you, I mean showing your face like this.\" \"You think I should wear a paper bag on my head? I've been called a monster, but I know I'm not that ugly. Evie thinks I'm the hottest white guy she's ever seen.\" \"Ricky, I didn't mean it that way. C'mon, I meant…\" Ricky glanced at his black shoes; the shine almost cast a reflection. \"I know what you meant, Cliff. I think I'll be fine. I made a deal with Evie. She said if I get too uncomfortable then we can leave. She's very perceptive that way.\" \"You think you can handle it?\" \"Cliff, I know how much this means to her, and even you and Shelly. It's time that I came back to the land of the living. I'm not gonna make a scene. I can be cool.\" Clifford smiled widely. \"I know you can. Cool as a cucumber.\" His brow furrowed and Ricky sensed he was nervous. \"Something wrong, Clifford?\" \"What makes you think that?\" \"I'm perceptive too. Is it Shelly?\" Clifford smiled. \"No way. She's awesome. Shelly just…she just has a bright way about her.\" \"Her optimism is overtly contagious. It's as if someone turned on a light bulb.\" Clifford nudged Ricky. \" Overtly contagious? Those are some high falootin' words.\" \"Believe it or not, I'm scoring A's in English lit. It's my best subject. Always was.\" Ricky said proudly. \"I never said it way back in the gym, but I don't need you to do my homework.\" \"Okay, but your math still sucks.\" Ricky stared ahead wryly. \"I know, and that's probably gonna mess me up when it's time for college.\" Clifford suppressed himself from making a complete double take. \"College? Already? I didn't think you were college material, to be honest.\" Ricky sighed. \"You always are, Cliff. I don't mean Harvard or Yale. I mean a trade school or something. I want to be an engineer or maybe an architect, at least a mechanic. And that all requires good math, that's what I heard.\" \"Wow, that's awesome. Mechanics you already do with your eyes closed. Don't sweat it, I rock math, I can tutor you.\" Ricky sat on the edge of the bed and cracked his knuckles. \"I guess so. I actually can't believe it though.\" \"Believe what? That I'm good in math?\" Clifford asked, noticing how dull his shoes were compared to Ricky's. He dug out some shoe supplies from the closet and poised his leg up on the chair to shine his spats. \"I can't believe I'm even thinking in that direction. I mean, it's me, Clifford.\" Ricky cast a fleeting look at his scarred wrist and kept it hidden from view with his jacket sleeve. \"I never expected to even live, let alone finish high school. My mother says it's a miracle, she's…she's actually proud of me.\" \"That's great, Rick. What about your father?\" \"He pays a little more attention to me now, but that TV is still on twenty-four-seven. Sometimes I think he blames me. I know he does, I can see it in his eyes, especially when he's been drinking. And what's so damn sick is that he's right. The one thing in my life that'll always haunt me is that I can never tell my parents what I've done. It would probably kill my mother and make my father want to kill me.\" The crack in his friend's voice saddened Clifford and he mentally thanked God he wasn't a girl or else he would cry. Evie and Shelly certainly would. Girls always cried and they loved hurt and misunderstood 'bad boys.' Ricky wasn't bad, but he was gravely misunderstood and unfairly ostracized. Ricky looked up at the ceiling. He blinked back hard tears, but the flush in his face was undeniable. Clifford patted Ricky's shoulder. \"You know I'll never tell, Ricky.\" He gulped, remembering how he slipped. \"Hey, you ever think you'll tell Evie the truth?\" Ricky stared at him forlorn. \"I want to, it burns me up so much because she's really sweet and I don't know how she'd take it. I don't want her to hate me.\" Clifford rubbed his chin thoughtfully. He already knew how she would take it; sympathetically with lots of tears. \"Rick, if she loves you, she'll be understanding. I'm sure she will. Evie has a big soft spot for troubled souls. Most girls do.\" \"That's a good way to describe me, a troubled, lost soul . Do you really believe she actually, loves me?\" Clifford didn't like the dim turn of the conversation. Ricky was prone to fall into self-doubt and despair, sometimes at the drop of a hat. He did a little research and learned it was all part of his depressed mental state. Ricky valiantly fought it. Clifford smiled to break the mood. \"Believe it? I know it, because she told me straight up - – \"I'm in love with Ricky, Cliff. I'm utterly and hopelessly in love with Ricky Linderman.\" That's not a lie.\" \"I know you wouldn't lie to me.\" Ricky's big smile was contagious and then they both laughed. Clifford still noticed the color of sadness on Ricky's face. \"Hey man, you're starting to look like that carnation. Speaking of which, we can't forget these.\" He kicked the chair back and went into a green bag on the bed. He pulled out two clear boxes with fresh carnation bracelets. He tossed the pink one next to Ricky. \"We need to give these to the girls and my Grandma says to meet her downstairs by the bar before we leave, she has something for you.\" Ricky still appeared to be in his own world, but he nodded and wiped his eyes. He stood abruptly. \"I sure could use a drink right now. Grandma Peache would let me have one too. Alright. I'm ready for this. It's neat your dad hooked us up with a limo, even if it will draw more attention to us. Evie said to pick them up at her house. Shelly slept over while her parents went out of town. Her grandfather is very sick and her parents went to visit him for the weekend. Shelly begged off because of the dance. She barely knows the man.\" Clifford buttoned his coat and stared at him. \"How come you know these things about Shelly and I don't? I'm her boyfriend! I…I guess.\" \"You know you are, Cliff.\" \"We never said it, not like you told Evie. This is only our first real week of dating.\" \"Wow, you're right. Cliff, I only know because Evie is my girlfriend and she gets all the dirt firsthand. I'm sure Shelly was planning to tell you.\" \"I wonder if she's mad that I didn't ask her yet.\" Ricky adjusted his bow-tie. Looking down at his friend he suddenly felt like an older, wise man. Evie pumped him up the day they practiced dancing. She admired the fact that he was a sixteen-year-old. Maybe he was too mature for his own good? Ricky sometimes felt like every youthful folly and immature thought flew out the window that tragic night. It overwhelmed him, but he realized how much he appreciated the life-altering wisdom, it kept him street-smart and on the right track. \"You'll get there, buddy. It's a big decision to say it, but you also don't want to drag it out. When I said that to Evie, I really felt it. We have a strong connection. I don't know, maybe I'm starting to get needy or something. I'd say Evie and I are eighty-five percent official.\" \"You're not needy, but I think you could use some lovin.' So, what would make it a hundred?\" Clifford grinned. Ricky blushed. Ever since his brother died, girls were furthest from his mind in all aspects. It was hard to think of anything pleasurable when all he thought was suicide and how to keep quiet and not draw suspicions about the accident. He laughed Clifford's question off. \"Well, there's that, but let's be honest here, man. Nobody is ready for it, not to mention Cheryl would destroy me. I'm talking about a token, a gift of my affection.\" \" Ahh, like my dad said, in the fifties, the guys used to pin the girls, it was frat boy stuff. You'll think of something. That gives me a good idea for Shelly. I noticed she has holes in her ears, but doesn't wear earrings most of the time. Do you think she'll like pearls?\" \"She seems the Olive Oyl type, ya know, with a string of pearls and a polka dot dress.\" Clifford cackled at the image. \"Olive Oyl didn't wear a polka dot dress. It was red and black!\" \"Oh, right, with huge brown boots! Well, she reminds me of her, I guess. I think you get me. You'll know what to buy Shelly when you're ready. If ya don't, just ask Grandma, she's old, but she's still a woman. I was thinking of a necklace for Evie. I like her neck, it's long and graceful.\" \"Whatever you say, Rick. I guess our girls are just beanpoles and giraffes.\" \"Heh, you said it, not me.\" \"Hey, I overheard them say it about themselves. So, you're on a first-name basis with Evie's mom, huh?\" \"Yeah, don't you remember when we met her, she said, just call me, Cheryl ?\" \"Oh right! You know, Rick, now I remember Shelly saying when she met my grandma that she hardly knew her grandparents. Shelly's parents had some kind of falling out with them or something.\" Ricky picked up the carnation boxes and headed toward the door. \"Don't tell her I told you, I wouldn't want those girls to think we hang out and gossip about their lives like they do about us all the time.\" Clifford laughed. \"Okay, it'll be our secret.\" As they went to the hall elevator, Ricky suddenly remembered Clifford's earlier mood. \"Hey, I asked you if something was wrong, was there?\" Clifford shrugged. \"No. It's all good.\" As the door opened and they stepped inside, Clifford's stomach knotted up. Although they humiliated and beat Moody to a pulp two weeks ago, he still wondered if and when the vindictive kid would take his revenge. The End.

Monday. I hate Mondays. Not as though they were any better than Saturday or Sunday, Tuesday or Wednesday, or even Friday. Sounds strange, right? Hating every day of the week, weekends included? I hate the weekends most of all, actually. However, every Monday through Friday, my dad never forgets to give me that goodbye punch of his before I go to school. Ever since my mom died, he's made sure to pummel me every chance he gets. It didn't help that he was a no-good drunk, either. Backpack slung over one shoulder, I snuck down the hall of my small, cold house. A nude magazine laid open on the floor. I bent over and picked it up, smirking as I quickly flipped through the pages. I tucked it under one arm and peered around the corner. My dad was seated lazily in a cheap, torn lawn chair he had dragged into the living room. He sipped on a beer and stared out the window with a dumb, vacant expression. The door was maybe ten feet away, and I was hoping to leave the house without being hit by my dad for once. Of course, no one ever gets what they want. As I stepped forward, I accidentally kicked a beer can against the wall with my red Chuck Taylor's. A loud clunk sounded as the can made contact with the wall. My eyes widened and I looked up into the living room, praying that my dad was too drunk to pay attention. He usually got drunk first thing in the morning. My heart pounded like a nine-pound hammer when I saw him twisted around in his chair looking right at me, and it pounded even harder when he stood up. His beer fell from his grasp and hit the floor, it's contents spilling out onto the carpet. He advanced towards me and I rushed to the door. I grasped at the doorknob, but before I could rip the door open, I was jerked back by my shirt. I flew back onto the carpet, my dad towering over me. \"You think you're leaving without saying goodbye?\" he hissed mockingly. I whimpered as his fist collided with my cheek. \"Get outta here,\" he growled. I stumbled to my feet and cradled the side of my face, running out the door and into the dim sunlight. My yard was nothing special, neither was my house. It was more like a small box on top of a dead patch of grass, littered with empty beer cans and several other various objects. In fact, it wasn't much different from the other houses that created the block. My house was probably the smallest and worst-looking on the block, though, with it's caved in roof and the door beginning to dangle off it's hinges. The windows didn't have screens, either. They were like empty squares cut into the walls of my house instead of windows. I ran through the brown grass, blades of it crunching beneath my feet, and grabbed my bike that was lying on the side of the road. I hopped onto it and pedaled down the street. The scenery of unkempt houses and filth littered lawns flew by as I pedaled faster. Finally, I reached the Hell Hole - otherwise known as school. I leapt off my bike and left it lying in the middle of the sidewalk. The kids would be too afraid to take it. They'd be too afraid that \"Moody'd beat me up\". I strode into the building, feeling a sudden rush of pride and authority sweep over me. As I walked down the hall, several people backed out of my way and I grinned. At least here everyone was afraid of me. I stopped walking when one of my friends, well, colleagues stepped in front of me. \"Nice lookin' bruise you got there, Moody,\" he said, looking at my cheek. \"What happened?\" \"What?\" I lifted a hand to my cheek and put pressure on the spot where my dad slugged me. A sharp pain spread in my cheek underneath my fingertips. \"Oh,\" I said, pausing, \"I- I got into a fight.\" \"Did you win?\" \"What do you think,\" I snapped at him. \"Whatever,\" he said, shrugging. I continued walking and the kid disappeared in the crowd of people. When I found the bathroom, I walked inside. The room looked vacant. I rushed over to the mirror and examined my cheek. A dark purple bruise had been painted on my right cheek just above my chin. Given my reputation, it wouldn't be so hard to pass the bruise off as the result of a fight. The loud sucking sound of a toilet being flushed came from a stall behind me and I straightened up. The back of an extremely tall boy's head poked up above the stall door. Linderman. I leaned against the counter as Linderman exited the stall and stepped up to the sink furthest away from me. I pushed myself up and strolled over to him, my hands buried in my pockets and a smirk on my face. Linderman ignored me and continued washing his hands. \"Hi,\" I slowly hissed at him. He looked up at me, a dangerous glint in his eyes. \"Don't screw with me today, Moody,\" Linderman growled. \"Why would I mess with you?\" I said, an edge of sarcasm etched in my voice. \"Because you're an asshole,\" Linderman said. I didn't respond. \"Where'd you get that bruise, Moody? Dad hit you again?\" I was caught off guard, forced into silence from the impact of the question. Linderman couldn't know that, could he? He must've just been trying to get a rise out of me. After a moments hesitation, I answered. \"Got it in a fight. Won it, too.\" \"Naturally,\" Linderman said sarcastically, rolling his eyes. He dried his hands off on his jeans and pushed past me to leave the bathroom. When the door closed, I turned around and continued examining my bruise in the mirror. I frowned slightly at the size of it. Gladly, even the teachers were aware of my violent reputation, so questions were rarely asked about what state I was in when I arrived at school. Due to the conditions at home, my reputation was all I had, and I was determined to keep it the way it was. Being the tough guy gave me a feeling of authority because I knew that there was at least one place where I knew I could boss people around, instead of being pushed around by a drunken bastard. When I stepped out of the bathroom the halls were empty except for a puny Freshman running to class. When he ran past me, I reached forward and grabbed the back of his shirt, dragging him into the bathroom. I pushed him against the wall. He was looking around frantically, quivering slightly. Clearly he was scared. \"You got my money?\" I snarled at him. I couldn't remember if this kid was part of the majority of students who owed me a dollar per day. There were so many students who paid me for my \"protective services\" that I lost track of them all. Evidently, I picked up the right kid because the boy shakily reached into his pocket and pulled out a few coins, stuttering, \"I-I only have si-sixty ce-cents.\" I snatched the coins from the boys grasp and flipped them over in my palm. \"You're lucky, kid,\" I hissed, looking up at the kid trembling in my grasp, \"because I'm feeling generous today.\" The bell rang loudly and I shoved the coins in my pocket. \"Come up short again and you may not be so lucky.\" I released my hold on the kid's shirt and he scurried out the door. Hands shoved in my pockets, I strolled out of the bathroom and down the hall to my English class. Casually, I walked into the room. Ms. Jump was attempting to settle the riled class down, a copy of To Kill a Mockingbird balanced in her hand. Unnoticed by Ms. Jump, I slipped into the jumbled crowd of students. \"Class,\" Ms. Jump hollered, clearly impatient now, \"settle down. Take your seats and get out your books.\" The chatter began to die as the kids sat down. Only one kid had already been seated, his book laid out in front of him. Peache, of course. I silently laughed at him. I looked around the classroom quickly. I saw Linderman seated by that annoying nerd kid that hung around with Peache. There was no chance I'd be bothered trying to remember his name. Honestly, I was surprised to see Linderman. He hadn't been to class on time in living memory. There's a first for everything, I guess. Ms. Jump began to read the book in her hand. I guess one of the characters, Attercust, or something I've never heard of before was defending some black man for raping someone. I hadn't bothered reading the book or even listening to Ms. Jump read. To Kill a Mockingbird sounded even more boring and dull than any other book on the face of this planet. I even lost the copy of the book they gave me. Bored, I glared at Peache momentarily, but soon started staring off into space. Contrary to popular belief, I didn't hate Peache. No, not hate, just envy. He had everything. Money, a fancy hotel, he even had friends. All I had was a drunk and abusive father, a bike, and more enemies than friends. \"Mr. Moody.\" I snapped out of my thoughts and looked up. Ms. Jump was looking at me, her hand rested on her hip. \"Mr. Moody, why don't you tell us something. Why did Reverend Sykes ask for Jem to take Scout and Dill home?\" I stared at her blankly for a moment, then said, \"Because... They're talkin' about sex?\" I had picked up a few things for Ms. Jump's readings, but not enough to really understand what was going on. A few laughs came from around the room and I proudly smiled. Ms. Jump froze, then cracked a grin. \"In general, yes. The court is discussing the charges against Tom Robinson for allegedly raping Mayella Ewell. So, yes, they are talking about sex.\" Ms. Jump didn't mind cussing or talking about sex during class, which was fine by me. \"On other terms, where is your book?\" She was also stern, which I didn't like. \"Lost it,\" I said coolly. Ms. Jump frowned. \"Your disadvantage, then.\" I shrugged in response. Ms. Jump looked back down at her book and continued reading. An hour of blankly staring off into space later, the bell rang and we were dismissed to attend our other classes. Math, Science, you know, boring things. Begrudgingly, I managed to show up to all of them. Not like I paid attention, though. The teachers knew it, too, judging by my test scores. Eventually, after several boring, uneventful classes, the final bell rang and we were able to go home. Not to my surprise, my bike was still lying in the middle of the sidewalk. I picked it up and rolled it several feet ahead, then hopped on it and glided down the sidewalk. I thought about staying there, going off somewhere with some people to avoid going home, but I just didn't feel social today, so I just kept rolling down the road. My dad would probably be drunk and dead to the world when I got home, so I don't think he'd be much of a threat. Pedaling, I finally reached the the little rotten bunch of houses that was my so-called \"neighborhood\" and stopped in front of the old wooden box that I lived in. Like I did every day when I came home, I hopped off my bike and left it lying abandoned by the side of the road. Suddenly, the previous feelings of superiority vanished, replaced with a sickening pang in my gut and a gripping fear. I knew my dad was inside, though I doubted he was awake. Unemployed and a drunk, he could barely hold a job for more than three weeks. He never left the house, either. My dad was too lazy to get out of that lawn chair in the living room to do anything more than get another beer and beat me. I was curious, though. The sick feeling I felt in my gut had never happened before. I knew I was following my worst instinct, but I opened the door anyway. The breaking hinges screamed in protest. I tiptoed across the threshold, glancing into the living room. As I expected, my dad was sprawled out on the lawn chair. Whether he was asleep or passed out, I couldn't tell. The beer can my dad had dropped this morning was still lying on the floor, a dark pool beneath it staining the carpet. A few other cans had been left on the floor over the day, as well. The most recent one was lying inches from my dad's fingers, creating another stain on the carpet. I shook my head mockingly and walked down the hall to my closet-sized room, quietly shutting the door. My room was small and quiet. Whenever I was in it, I felt claustrophobic due to how close the walls were. Regardless of how sick it made me, I preferred staying in my room than going out and facing my dad. It was at the end of the hall on the left, so since my dad practically lived in that chair, I usually went unnoticed. Well, unnoticed until he was hacked off at something and needed a punching bag. For the next few hours, I sat there on the sheet tied to hooks on the wall that provided as a bed and looked through the nude magazine I had picked up that morning. \"Kid,\" a loud, booming voice yelled, making me jump and drop the magazine. Looks like dad's up , I thought. Crashing footsteps pounded down the hall, ceasing by my door. I winced when my door was kicked open, revealing my dad's contorted, seething face. As he advanced into my room, I retreated back a little. \"Kid, where the hell's all my beer?\" he growled, pointing an accusing finger at me. \"You probably drank it all, you damn drunk,\" I snapped. That was a mistake. My dad belted me across the face. \"Damn smartass!\" he screeched. \"Tell me where my beer is or I swear I'll beat your sorry ass so hard you won't be able to see or walk for a week.\" I could faintly hear a banging coming from the front door. Bang bang bang . \"I told you where your fucking beer is,\" I spat. \"You drank it all! Now you need to buy more, but you went and fucked yourself over and no one'll hire and pay a drunk bastard like you!\" Another fist smashed it's way into my jaw. Bang, bang, bang. Perhaps someone was at the door. \"Don't you talk to me like that,\" he snapped, wrapping his fist into my shirt and dragging me to my feet. His face was inches from mine, his hot, putrid breath blowing into my face. I could feel my heart rate increasing and I began to tremble. After thrusting a hard fist into my abdomen, he tossed me down onto the floor. I could still hear the banging, and it kept getting louder. Bang, bang, bang. Continuous jeers and obscenities spewed from his mouth as he kicked me over and over again. In my gut, my legs, arms, crotch. One even landed on my face. I spit blood that was oozing out of a cut on my lip at my dad. Another kick in the face and blood splattered onto the floor from my nose. With the wall as a support, I stood up. I had always been able to hold my own in fights with other kids, so why couldn't I do it with this fat, lazy oaf? This was a fight I was determined to win. My head felt dizzy, though, and my vision blurred, but I was still able to swing a hard punch into my dad's gut. I heard a thud and a quiet gasp of pain as my fist made contact with his oversized gut. My vision returned, but was obscured again as my dad smacked me against the wall. I stood up again, teetering slightly, then was pushed back down. \"Stay down, you worthless sack of shit,\" my dad spat. Somehow I knew that I wasn't going to leave this fight without severe injuries - or worse. My dad dragged me up by my shirt and pressed me against the wall. \"You're pointless,\" he breathed quietly. I hadn't hear the banging again, so maybe whoever was at the door went away. I was breathing heavily now from pain and fear. There had to be something I could do to prevent something out-of-hand happening. I couldn't beat this brute off me, and I couldn't scream for help. That would just make matters worse. Then I remembered I had a switchblade in my back pocket. Maybe I could stab him just enough to maim him, but not kill him. A wounded enemy is better than a drunk, angry one in my opinion. However, he would be an angry, drunk, and wounded enemy. That's not exactly ideal, but it's better than getting beat. Before the blundering drunk could comprehend what was going on, I tore the switch from my pocket and pressed it against his wrist. A flash of silver glinted in the dim light as I flipped the blade against his skin. He dropped me as the sharp edge slit through his wrist. My dad backed up a few steps clutching his arm, blood steadily dripping from the incision I made in his wrist. He growled, \"You son of a bitch,\" and I brandished the switchblade. He advanced at me, and before I could react he shoved me against the wall. I heard a sickening crack and a sharp pain flew through my skull. My dad quickly retreated from the room holding his arm and paused at the doorway, looking into the hall. \"What's going on?\" said a voice. It was recognized that voice, deep and menacing, hardened. I couldn't remember who it was, though. I rolled over a bit, clutching my head and groaning. \"Who the hell are you?\" my dad growled. \"Why're ya in my house?\" \"I asked you what was going on,\" the hard voice asked again. \"None of your damn business,\" my dad hissed angrily. \"Get outta my house before I make ya.\" \"Moody?\" Weakly, I looked up, seeing who had come into the house. My eyes widened when I saw Linderman staring through my doorway. My dad grabbed him by his jacket and started dragging him away. Linderman twisted around and kneed my dad in the gut, making him double over and gasp. He slugged him several times in the gut as well, then gave my dad a hard punch in the face, knocking him out. Linderman tossed my dad's unconscious body off of him and rushed over to me. \"You okay? What happened?\" I tried to tell him that my dad beat me through my heavily bleeding nose and my swollen lips, but it came out in a whimper that sounded like a kicked dog. \"Never mind,\" Linderman sighed, \"I think I have a pretty good idea what happened.\" He stood up and curtly looked around my small room. \"Damn, I had a feeling you had it bad.\" I looked up and him towering above me through squinted eyes, closing them soon after due to the throbbing in my head. \"Moody?\" \"What?\" I said thickly. \"We gotta get you outta here. Your old man ain't gonna be out for long, and as much as I hate you, I don't want you living like this.\" I opened my eyes again and looked up at Linderman. He took a step out of the room and peered down at my dad, who I assumed was still unconscious. Slowly, I pushed myself up and leaned against the wall and held my head. Blood dripped from my nose and onto my shirt and I could barely open my eyes to anything more than slits. \"Where's some clothes?\" Linderman asked, looking around the room. I pointed to a small, wrinkled pile on the other side of the room and Linderman picked them up, tossing them over his arm. \"Why are you here?\" I asked slowly. \"I knew somethin' was up with your family from the moment I met you, and when you came to school with that bruise on your face I could tell you were lying about getting it in a fight,\" he said while he lifted me up by the arm. My head started pounding and I gasped. \"I followed you home in case something happened. Looks like something did.\" Linderman hoisted me up by the elbow a little too quickly, making my head spin. He let me go and I took a minute to regain my balance and to let my eyes focus. The clothes were thrust harshly into my arms. I almost dropped them as Linderman drug me out of my closet by the upper arm. \"Where are we goin?\" I asked stupidly. My eyes were still shut due to the pain in my head, and the speed that Linderman was dragging me at wasn't helping any. Linderman stopped abruptly and I stumbled a bit. \"Moody\" - he kept a firm grip on my arm so I wouldn't fall - \"do you want to stay here?\" \"Hell no,\" I said, straightening myself. I opened my eyes a little and looked at Linderman. He bit his lip and looked back at me. For a moment, i wondered why he was trying to help me. We could both agree that we weren't friends. In fact, Linderman and I weren't even on a first name basis. Linderman suddenly continued to pull me by the arm, then dragged me outside and let me go. I had been able to keep my eyes open since the throbbing in my head began to decrease. Linderman must have noticed I was feeling better, because he told me to get on my bike. He grabbed the heap of clothes in my arms and shoved them in his backpack, then swung it back over his shoulder. \"Okay, c'mon,\" he said, hopping back on his bike. Linderman was already pedaling down the road before I even got on mine. I got on my bike and followed close behind him. Linderman had led me to his house, and now we were both sitting in his bedroom. He was sprawled out on his bed and I was sitting on the floor near the wall silently. A few hours had passed since the fight with my dad, and my face had a blue-purple hue to it from the bruises dotted along my skin. It felt weird to be in Linderman's bedroom, let alone being in Linderman's house. He was a murderer, as well as a rapist, a molester - it's a long list. But after what he had just done for me forced me to look at him differently. Linderman didn't have to get me away from my house and my dad. I was actually surprised he hadn't killed me . . . yet. After all the taunting and grief I had given him over the years, you could see it flickering in his eyes that he wouldn't mind kicking my head in. Perhaps he wasn't the monster that everyone said he was. \"Ricky,\" I said. His first name felt weird to say. Ricky looked down at me on the floor. There was that look again. \"What's going to happen?\" It was a stupid question, but I was curious. I couldn't go home, and there was no way Ricky was going to let me live in his room. \"I can't be sure, but I'm going to help you leave tomorrow morning,\" Ricky said simply. Leave? I had no where to go, and I was not living on the streets. \"Where would I go?\" Ricky paused a moment before answering. \"Do you have any family to stay with?\" Now it was my turn to pause. I remembered where one of my relatives lived, and that wasn't too far from here. \"I have an aunt who lives a couple miles out of town,\" I answered. \"So you'll go there.\" Ricky looked back at the ceiling. Great. Now all that's left to do is wait for dawn. I was woken by Ricky shaking my shoulder harshly. He and I had gotten my clothes into a bag, and Ricky had snuck me some food and water for my trip. Ricky and I were now standing a couple of meters from his house. I was standing next to my bike, the bag of food and clothing slung over my shoulder. Ricky was by my side. It was a few minutes after dawn, so the sun peeking over the horizon painted the block a dim orange. \"I'll tell everyone you moved away,\" Ricky told me as he looked down the street, \"which is truth enough.\" I nodded and followed his gaze down the street. No one was out yet except Ricky and I. Ricky punched my shoulder lightly, in an almost friendly way. I suppressed a yelp since he hit me on a particularly nasty bruise, but I couldn't help my eyes wincing in pain. Ricky noticed and looked at me. \"You should get going before people start coming out,\" Ricky said. I nodded again and met Ricky's gaze for a moment. He gave me a small smile and I looked away so I could get on my bike. \"Can I ask you to do something for me?\" Ricky asked before I started down the street. \"Sure.\" I planted both feet firmly on the ground. \"When you get there, don't be an ass,\" he advised. \"No promises,\" I said with a smirk, \"but I'll try.\" \"Good enough, now go.\" I began to pedal down the road, looking over my shoulder at Ricky. The hateful glint in his eyes was gone. 10 ","Summary":" *Moody's P.O.V.* Six in the morning. Monday. I hate Mondays.

I'm making no money off of this story. Author's note: This scene takes place before the first confrontation between Clifford, Ricky, Moody, and his newly hired bodyguard Mike. A huge thank you to Little Albatross for hosting such a wonderful Adam Baldwin page! I found a promo photo on her site that inspired me to write this fic but apparently I can't post links here to show said photo :- \"Building the Bridge\" Carson took his lunch tray after paying for it (today was a decent day, considering he hadn't been extorted by Moody) and went over to his usual table. A few of his buddies were there and had already began shoveling food into their mouths. It was like they were given the chance to eat real food for the first time since returning from starvation camps. Then again, they must have avoided been harassed by bullies. As Carson sat down, he felt the weight on the bench shift next to him. Looking over, he saw that it was just Clifford and… \"Hey Carson, you mind if he sits with us today?\" It was hard not to notice Ricky Linderman's significant, frightening form as he helped himself to a spot next to Clifford. Carson shot up like a weed and turned as white as a ghost. The others kids at the table instantly abandoned their lunches and jumped ship, leaving the three boys. \"Hey,\" Carson hissed at Clifford as his eyes were frozen onto Linderman's stoic face. \"What did I ever do to you to deserve his?\" Clifford laughed a little and gently smacked Carson's upper arm. \"Relax, will you? It's okay. He's a good guy.\" \"I'd like to form my own opinion,\" Carson commented dryly as he ever so carefully sank back down. Clifford turned to Linderman and asked, \"How about we start things over? Wouldn't it be nice to have some more friends? Maybe we can build more bikes with more man-power.\" Linderman's eyes shifted from Clifford to Carson, back to Clifford, until finally settling onto Carson once again. Lifting an arm, he stretched it across Clifford and held it just a few inches from the blonde boy. Carson's body was frozen, unwilling to make a single move. He was shocked he didn't flinch like the way he did whenever Moody was ready to shake him down for his belongings. He was absolutely frightened beyond belief; in his head, he begged whatever higher being was out there to take him now before he could feel any pain. \"I ain't gonna hurt you,\" Linderman stated, speaking in a surprisingly friendly and teasing tone. His face lost its frightening aura. It looked relaxed and… dare he say… friendly? Unsteadily, Carson lifted his own hand from his lap and took Linderman's huge, extended hand. The two shook a steady handshake. At that moment, the smaller boy felt a sense of relief wash over him. I'm alive, he thought as he continued to study Linderman's hard face. Wow, I'm actually still breathing. Jesus, Allah, Budda-whatever's out there, thank you for letting me live for another day. All the while, Clifford was grinning ear to ear at the scene.\"Now that wasn't so bad, was it, guys?\" Carson took his hand back and wiped his nervous sweat back and forth on his pants. He managed to keep a straight face as he snuck a bite of his neglected food. After a sip from his milk, he spoke directly to Linderman. \"I guess I should thank you because it's not every day I get the chance to flip off Moody and live to tell the tale. So… thanks a lot.\" Linderman chortled but said nothing as he settled with picking at the lunch he often referred to as garbage. Carson was relieved and he had a feeling that things just might turn out okay after all. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners.

Can you guess who the narrator is? \"Preparations For Doom\" \"For the love that is good and holy, please, please, please… PLEASE let this be a bully-free day.\" Clifford looked over at me and raised a curious eyebrow. I separated my hands from my praying position (which became a ritual for me ever since I started high school) and sighed miserably. \"It's no good,\" I admitted grumpily. \"It's going to be just like every other day.\" \"Don't be like that,\" Clifford said. \"It won't be like this forever.\" His voice got a little quieter as he leaned closer to me. \"Moody and the other jerks can't keep picking on us. It's gotta stop eventually. \" I grunted. \"Yeah, well, maybe if Linderman hadn't left…\" I drummed the tips of my fingers on top of my desk and tilted my head back, staring at the empty seat behind me that would have been occupied by Ricky. \"Maybe it would've been better, or maybe it would've gotten worse. I dunno.\" \"I'm telling you, it can't go on like this. Something is going to happen.\" \"… Well…\" I sat upright and stared glumly at Clifford. \"I guess so.

This story is for entertainment purposes only. Author's note: Hmmm... I'm not sure where I wanted to go with this story. I guess I just wanted to write another fic with Clifford and Ricky together. They make such good friends, don't they? Plus, I wanted an excuse to write in Clifford because for some reason, I feel like I've been neglecting him, LOL. Oh, and I couldn't remember if Ricky's little brother was ever mentioned by name in the movie, so he was left nameless. \"With Much Gratitude\" He took a long drag from his cigarette and exhaled the smoke through his nostrils. Leaning back against the brick wall, he dangled the cigarette between his fingers as his thoughts were drowning in a sea of frustration and sadness. \"Ricky?\" Upon hearing his best friend's voice, he took another drag, this time a much longer one, exhaled, and dropped the cigarette onto the cement ground. His heavy black boot smashed over it, ensuring its quick demise. He looked over and saw the much smaller boy standing there with his arms across his chest, his light colored eyes watching him with concern. \"Is something wrong?\" Clifford asked. \"How come you ditched class?\" Without answering, Ricky turned and started to walk around the brick wall and away from the school property. Clifford stood there, dumbfounded for a few moments, before he quickly followed him. \"Not this again,\" Clifford muttered as he soon caught up with Ricky's long strides. He wracked his brain to think of something that would cause the other boy to revert back to his old, callous self. Just when it looked like Ricky was breaking away from his aloof mannerism... \"What's the matter? Why aren't you talking to me?\" Ricky abruptly stopped and finally answered with, \"Jesus, I can't believe how persistent you are.\" But there was no maliciousness in his tone-it borderlined more on amusement mixed with irritancy. How could he forget how stubborn Clifford could be at times? Clifford knew this as well, as he looked up at him and patiently waited for an answer. Inward, he was thankful that whatever was bothering him, he would be allowed to know what was going on. Ricky scratched the back of his shaggy head and motioned for the other to follow him. \"It's his birthday today.\" Despair loomed behind Ricky's eyes as he sat next to Clifford on the sidewalk on the other side of town. The mention of his brother at any time sparked such an emotion-but only under the scrutiny of an observer such as Clifford Peache. He learned this from watching the many people who came to the hotel his father managed. People in general were such a curious and unpredictable bunch. \"You know what, Clifford? Ever since he died… ever since the funeral… I'd never once gone back to the cemetery to visit him.\" Clifford looked down at the half drunk soda can he held on top of his lap. Earlier they'd stopped by a 7-11: Clifford bought a Pepsi while Ricky settled for a pack of smokes. After they decided on a place to sit down and talk (Ricky routed them to a relatively quiet area of a neighborhood he was familiar with), that was when the troubles were revealed. \"It's like if I go back there and I see his name on that slab of granite, and those years... it'll remind me that he really IS gone.\" Ricky hunched forward and cursed softly under his breath. Clifford pressed his thumb against the aluminum can until it made a slight indentation. Ricky was managing another cigarette between his fingers as he stretched out his long legs before him. \"I know he's gone, Cliff-don't think I don't realize it.\" Clifford nodded and softly said, \"I know you do.\" \"… but goddamit, nobody should have their name on a tombstone until they've lived a long life.\" \"Yeah…\" The cigarette now dangled between Ricky's dried and cracked lips as he tilted his head back and stared helplessly at the dull, gray skies. Clifford looked up, taking notice of the moody atmosphere and how appropriate it was for the topic at hand. \"When do you think you'll go?\" Clifford asked as he rolled his head across his shoulders and looked at Ricky. \"I mean, when you're ready to go.\" \"Shit, I dunno. You saw how long it took for me to tell you what really happened to the poor little guy. If I go, I'm gonna have to apologize for what I did. I owe him that much.\" He chuckled bitterly. \"Some birthday present, huh?\" It was an accident, Clifford wanted to say out loud, but refrained from doing so. He remembered how upset and passionate Ricky was with his confession. It was fruitless to remind him that he didn't mean to kill his little brother. They both knew it was an accident; but the pain wouldn't simply go away because the truth was revealed. It may not go away for a very long time-if ever. Instead, Clifford asked, \"Do you want me to go with you? When you're ready?\" Ricky said nothing. Clifford slowly lowered his head and nursed his soda. He noticed it was getting warmer and he quickly downed the rest of its contents. The taste lingered in his mouth and after which, Ricky finally answered his question. \"It's about an hour and a half's drive outside the city. Can you handle it?\" Clifford shrugged indifferently and grinned. \"No problem.\" Ricky finished the rest of his cigarette and offered him a sad smile in return. Yet Clifford could see gratitude written all over his face. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners.

Please be sure to read her fics! \"All In Due Time\" \"How did you get that scar?\" It was an innocent question, but corrupted enough to make him pull his arm and hide it behind his back. \"Ricky, lemme see.\" She reached out and clasped his elbow, gently tugging on it. His eyes went dark and his face frigid. For a brief moment, he considered recoiling from her touch all together-his most natural reaction to whenever someone noticed his \"guilt.\" But that was when Gramma Peache's playful but comforting voice reached out from the depths of his memories. \"You're among friends, Ricky. You're among friends.\" He had relented, albeit reluctantly, for the first time back then; allowing others to see his secret shame, the dark secret that he'd kept hidden for over a year. Without realizing it, he already allowed her to examine his wrist. She brought it close to her face, seemingly fascinated with it. \"What happened?\" she asked candidly as she used the tip of her finger to trace the pink scars, her breath warm against his flesh. \"How...?\" \"It was...\" His fingers curled into his palm and made a tight fist. He very carefully withdrew from her touch and averted his stare. \"I...\" \"Ohhh, Ricky.\" She smiled sadly at him as she slipped her arms around his waist and hugged him tight, the side of her face pressed against his broad chest. \"I know that one day you'll be ready to talk to me about it. Just like you were able to talk to Clifford about it, right?\" She lifted her head and gazed up at him with such sincerity and overwhelming positivity, her braces shining against her white teeth. \"You know I'm right! After all, I'm always right about these things, aren't I?\" Shelley had such an infectious grin, and he couldn't help but return the gesture. He felt at ease with her and he knew that some day, he'd be ready to share his past with the girl he truly and deeply cared about.

Author's notes: Brace yourself! This is NOT my typical short one-shot (this round is over two thousand words-a record for me, LOL). This was actually one of my very first My Bodyguard fics that I'd ever written; but because I was experiencing such difficulty finishing it, I placed it on the back burner and churned out the mini-fics that have already been posted on this site. Last week I decided to give the story another go and well, here it is in its final(?) form. Just a fair warning: I took a character from the film and gave her a personality that I saw fit for this story (like how Mrs. Phineas Bogg did with another MB minor character in her wonderfully crafted \"The boy with the big green jacket\" tale). Please let me know how this turned out! My fic takes place the day after the movie. 08/06/11: I hadn't realized my chapter breaks vanished until now, so I went through the fic and added them back in along with doing a quick clean up for any spelling/grammar mistakes. \"Shallow\" Shelley didn't expect Leilani to ever talk to her after what happened between their two groups of friends yesterday afternoon. Moody and his bodyguard, Mike, attempted to harass Clifford and Ricky only to have the tables turned on them. Mike was taken down by Ricky and Clifford surprised everyone by beating Moody in a fight - not to mention breaking his nose in the process! Leilani was playing with the ends of her silky, blonde curls, seemingly lost in her own world. Like a ghost, Shelley slipped into the desk behind her. The two weren't the best of friends and they never hung out at lunch time or after school, but they usually found themselves talking to one another and occasionally partnered up for assignments. In the past, whenever Moody snaked into their conversations, their focuses shifted squarely upon him; it was Shelley that received the short end of the stick, despite the many compliments and little things that she did for him (like taking notes for him or saving him a seat). Other than that, they got along fine. Shelley started to take out her notebook and pencil when Leilani slowly turned around and acknowledged her. \"Hey, Shelley.\" The brunette offered her typical, cheery smile. \"Hey,\" she greeted back. \"What's up?\" She hesitated, unsure if she should ask, but then decided to press forth. \"How's Moody?\" Leilani rolled her eyes. \"Like I care. I'm never going to waste my time with him again.\" \"Were you guys going out?\" In the past, Shelley would have experienced a pang of jealousy. Despite the fact that Moody humiliated her from time to time, she couldn't help but be attracted to his suave good looks and self-confidence (though she now knew it was just the polite way of calling him an \"asshole\"). \"He'd been annoying me lately but we were going to go on an official date last night. He was always bragging about his reign over the school and his lame bodyguard. I know the way he was treating everybody lately was really awful. After he broke his nose, I gave up on him.\" Leilani paused and examined her polished fingernails. \"Hmm, I'm glad I didn't date Melvin in the first place. None of those kids deserved what happened to them. You know what the worst thing was? He almost stained my new blouse with his blood. God, how pathetic.\" Shelley shifted in her seat some, realizing how shallow Leilani could sound. Never the less she was relieved to hear that she wasn't so fond of the bullies anymore (well, Melvin, at least). \"What're you gonna do now? I mean, guy-wise? Did you like anybody who wasn't like Moody?\" Leilani giggled. \"Moody was pretty hot.\" Looking over her shoulder, she noticed the teacher hadn't arrived and only about half of the students were present. Once she secured the area, she looked back at Shelley and whispered, \"Maybe, but I don't know...\" \"Ohhh? I promise I won't say anything!\" Leilani mused over her eager classmate. Shelley didn't have too many girlfriends (at least that she knew of) and she seemed pretty nice. She'd only been chatting with her since the beginning of the school year and she frankly liked the girl, even if she wasn't up to her social status. But it wasn't like they were really friends or anything-she was just someone to chat with during class and whose conversations proved to be entertaining at times. Still… \"All right, but keep it quiet! It's…\" Before she could continue, more students hustled into the classroom with Ms. Jump right on their heels. \"Let's get down to business,\" the teacher announced as she made a bee-line to the chalkboard. \"Take out yesterday's notes and we'll continue where we left off. Due to that false fire alarm we had, we're trailing behind the other classes. \" Leilani fell silent and quickly faced the front before Shelley could get another word in. The brunette pressed her lips together and pouted before giving up. As Leilani closed her locker, she heard Shelley's laughter behind her. Turning around and holding her binder to her chest, she saw the girl standing on the other side of the hallway with Clifford Peache, Ricky Linderman, and a couple of other classmates whose names she couldn't bother herself to remember. She focused on Clifford as he was engaged in a conversation with the entire group, using his hands to make some wild gestures. Whatever he said made everybody erupt with laughter. I can't believe it, Leilani thought to herself as she studied the way Clifford's hair moved with every motion he made, the way his blue eyes seemed to shine with such maturity. He was so different from Melvin besides the obvious physical features. She recalled the way he stood up to him at the park yesterday. He was such a scrawny looking guy; he didn't look like he could hurt a fly. But the way he'd stood up to him in front of everybody, even with a bodyguard…! She sighed sharply and faced her locker, her fingernails digging into her binder and leaving permanent marks. Why did it have to be him? This school had way hotter guys, especially the seniors. They could be models or Hollywood actors. Clifford wasn't drop dead gorgeous like the boys she could think of off the top of her head. No, it was his level-headedness and his confidence that was most pleasing. But what would people say about her? What would they even think if they saw the two of them walking hand-in-hand down the hallway? She had no trouble admitting that she was one of the prettiest girls in school who could get any boy she wanted. Why would she be caught dead with someone like Clifford? Because I think I really kind of like him, she argued with herself. Familiar voices unexpectedly called out her name. The gals she hung out with at lunch time were just down the corridor in the direction of her next class. She decided she needed to get away from the atmosphere as quickly as possible. \"Leilani!\" The blonde and her group of friends stopped in their tracks in the school parking lot and saw Shelley bouncing over to them. The harsh whispers around Leilani erupted instantly. \"It's the dork that liked Moody.\" \"Hee hee, yeah, but it's nothing to be proud of now.\" \"No duh, but before when he was gorgeous and tough.\" \"I know!\" As Shelley came closer, Leilani turned to her friends and told them that she would catch up. \"Don't take too long,\" one girl remarked snidely. \"Some people might think you two are actually friends or something.\" Leilani smirked but said nothing as her friends walked off. Sometimes they could be real cruel but it wasn't as if she was completely innocent herself. On her best days she could be queen of the bitches. \"You forgot to tell me who you liked,\" Shelley announced as she stood before the popular blonde. \"Really? Is that what was bugging you?\" Leilani scowled and pushed aside loose strands of hair from her forehead. \"Oh, come on. You totally left me hanging in English! Wait, lemme guess who it might be.\" Before Leilani could answer, Shelley suggested, \"It's Ricky, right?\" Leilani instantly gasped and choked at the mention of Linderman. \"Omigod,\" she gasped after she regained her composure. She immediately looked around to make sure nobody saw her comical reaction. \"Please tell me you're joking.\" \"I've seen the way you look at him in class,\" Shelley said with a small chuckle. \"I can't help but notice because you sit in front of me and I see your head looking in that direction from time to time.\" \"It is NOT him - never, never, never!\" While Leilani remained poised, the mere thought of Ricky and herself made her want to throw up. She didn't care if he did become the school's savior against bullies for a time. He was so not her type. \"Shelley, I was never looking at him.\" \"Oh? Then who is it?\" \"Ugh, Shelley, please… who else do you think?\" \"You were supposed to tell me , remember?\" Shelley waggled her eyebrows and grinned. Leilani cursed her inward because she'd gotten her there. \"You have to swear you won't tell a soul. You know how popular I am and if anybody finds out-\" \"Sure, sure,\" the brunette replied casually. \"I promise. Now, who is it?\" Leilani took a long, steady breath, exhaled then quietly (and rather quickly) admitted, \"Clifford.\" Shelley's mouth form a giant \"o\" shape. Leilani instantly regretted what she did, but instead of the reaction she was expecting (mild shock), Shelley simply said, \"Isn't he great?\" \"Um, you aren't surprised?\" \"Well, of course I'm surprised! But ever since Clifford came to our school, things have been turning out for the better. Sure we had that rough patch with the constant bullying and extortions all, but in the end it all worked out. I knew it would all work out anyways - you know I'm always right about these things - but still, I think it's great! When are you gonna tell him how you feel? You want me to tell him?\" \"No!\" Leilani hissed, her cheeks flushed red with embarrassment. \"You promised not to say anything!\" \"Whoops, yeah, I did.\" Shelley laughed cheerfully. \"Well, what are you gonna do, then? Will you tell him before the school year ends? Or will you wait?\" \"Shelley, someone like me can't go up to someone like him and admit how I feel. It's not right.\" \"Why?\" Shelley's smile slowly faded. \"People will talk. I don't want them making fun of me.\" \"Wait, what? You're that worried about what the other kids will think?\" Tossing her curls over her shoulders, Leilani placed her hands upon her hips, the redness of her skin finally disappearing. \"Oh come on, Shelley. I'm sure Clifford's a good guy. I saw what he did but it's just…\" She tried to put into words how difficult it would be for someone like her and for someone like him to be out in public. There would just be too much pressure on her and the constant stares and gossip about her would never end. Even if they managed a relationship, for even the shortest amount of time, the memories of how others viewed her would remain with her forever. God, what was wrong with her? \"Do you really have to worry about what other people think about you?\" \"YES!\" Leilani snapped, irritated that Shelley somehow was able to read her mind. \"I don't want them to think any less of me! I can't risk losing anything just because of what I feel towards him! There is so much pressure being who I am and who I hang out with. I can't risk losing any of it because I like someone like him! I only told you because you guys hang out or whatever. Part of me, the stupid and desperate part of me, thought that maybe you could help me get to him… but now I wish I hadn't said anything!\" Shelley's face was crestfallen and her shoulders sagged. After a few uncomfortable moments, she asked, \"How do you feel when people see me and you talking to each other?\" Leilani hesitated and her eyes shifted away, refusing to meet the other's inquisitive stare. \"I used to be a little embarrassed but it's not so bad now. I guess you're cool by association. Just a little, though.\" \"Oh.\" Shelley didn't bother hiding the disappointment in her tone. It didn't last long, however, because her voice eventually found its cheerful, confident, and steady pitch. \"You know what? It's fine. I know I'm not cool like you but I don't worry about that stuff. I'm just glad to have the friends I do have because they don't care who I hang out with.\" Then she added, \"Clifford doesn't care about his social status. He's the type of guy who would treat you well because that's the kind of person he is.\" Leilani swallowed a lump in her throat and kept her mouth shut. She still refused to look at the other girl because she didn't want to admit that she was right. \"Well,\" Shelley announced. \"I'm gonna get going. The gang and I are going to the hamburger joint that just opened down the street. If you want, stop on by! Clifford will be there and don't worry, I won't say anything. I'll wait for you to do that.\" Shelley's footsteps skidded along the asphalt until the sounds vanished all together. Leilani could now only gawk at where Shelley once stood. Lifting a hand, she touched her cheek and felt something wet. She pulled her fingers back and huffed. Her makeup was smeared, ruined. She'd have to find a bathroom to fix her face. Suddenly, she saw that her whole hand was trembling slightly and her vision was becoming blurry. \"I don't care,\" she whispered harshly, trying to convince herself, as she used the back of her arm to temporarily remedy her appearance. \"Whatever. I don't care. I just can't be seen with someone like him…\" Deep down, she knew she was probably giving up on a good and decent guy - all for the sake of maintaining her popularity. She'd give herself a few days to get Clifford out of her head. She considered becoming friendly with a linebacker on the football team that'd been eyeing her while she was hanging out with Moody and his boys… On her way to the bathroom to better fix her appearance before catching up with her friends, she couldn't help but ultimately realize… In the end, Shelley was right about these things.

She giggled quietly but quickly sobered up when she saw him frown. \"I'm not making fun of you,\" she insisted as she placed her hands on each side of his face and pulled his head down some. He was a hulking figure, easily the most intimidating looking student in the entire school, and there was no way for her to meet him unless she took control of the situation. \"I just wanna help you relax because… Well… I'm nervous too.\" \"...

This fanfic is for entertainment purposes only. No money is being made here. \"Perceptions\" At first, she wasn't sure if she heard it right. His words, however, suddenly resonated in her head loud and clear. \"It wasn't suicide.\" Anticipation. \"I shot him.\" Shock. \"I killed him.\" Dread. She lifted her hands, which seemed to weigh like a pair of cement blocks, and clasped them over her ears, as if she was trying to prevent his confession from haunting her. The more she stood in her own silence, the more her emotions churned-a brewing storm of bewilderment and fear. Mayhem. Her hands fell limply at her side. She stared incredulously at him, trying to picture him with a shotgun. She fabricated the fearful image that she and the rest of the school once had of him: thug, rapist, killer… His face was like stone, unreadable, and his eyes were fixed in a permanent glare that ripped knives through anybody brave enough to meet his line of sight. Nonetheless when he opened his mouth to speak, the words that spilled out betrayed the reflection he represented now and in her mind. \"I should've known better. I was supposed to be the older brother. Shit, I didn't mean to do it…! I made it look like he killed himself because I panicked. I… I let him down, Shelley. It should have been me.\" Uncertainty. Blinking, she saw him again-but now she really saw him. He was a broken, remorseful, and defeated youth. He was the lonely and aloof misfit who had just returned after missing so many months of school. His stony mask showed its spider web of cracks and his sharp glare was immensely softened with tears ready to spill forth. It wasn't long before her own vision started to blur. He turned his back to her, no longer allowing her to bear witness to his shame. Sorrow. \"Ricky…\" Hesitation. She took a step over and clasped his elbow with both hands. \"I-I don't… I don't know what it's like to go through what you did. I can't say I understand because I don't, unless it were to happen to me.\" Her fingers curled around the jacket's rough, rigid material as she rested her forehead against his upper arm. Mournful. \"I don't know what to say to make you feel any better, but if you ever wanna talk about it some more, or if you just wanna just let it all out, I'm here for you.\" Comfort. He was silent as the dead. She wondered if she said the right thing. Surely, she was sorry for what she heard. She was sorry for the way she thought of him, not knowing he carried a terrible and heavy secret upon his shoulders. \"But… you must have felt a little better when you told Clifford, right?\" She cracked a smile at his broad backside, despite the trail of tears visible on her glowing face. \"Oh, that Cliff. It's no wonder you guys are such good friends! I can only imagine he bugged the heck out of you for whatever reason and that's when you told him. He must have said the right things to you if you guys are still buddies.\" Resolution. \"Ricky, it's fine if you don't wanna talk about this anymore. Just know that I'm here for you.\" At that instant, he turned to face her, causing her to lift her head away from his arm. He roughly pulled her against his chest and held her close. She slid her arms around his waist and hugged him as tightly as she could, like he was going to disappear at a moment's notice. \"You don't have to cry,\" he murmured as he buried his face into her hair, his voice slightly unsteady. She playfully slapped his backside as she continued to hold him. \"You big dummy! Don't keep this stuff inside, 'kay?

There was a pretty character in Clifford and Ricky's class played by a very young Jennifer Beals in her first role. She had no name and no lines, but popped up in a few scenes and had a close-up. I thought it would be fun to flesh her out and see what came of it. Enjoy, this is the start of a little series The boy with the big green jacket Every day she stared furtively at the boy with the big green jacket. Ever since he came back to school four months ago, she wanted to talk to him, but he was a loner. He sat huddled in the far left corner and stared at the world outside the gated window, longing to be there and feeling caged in. Rumors swirled around the boy with the big green jacket. She didn't want to believe them, especially not since learning that Moody and his thugs perpetrated them to make money off helpless kids. The new kid and her new friend, Clifford Peache, wasn't as helpless as Moody thought. Clifford was brave. She always endeared herself to the 'outsiders.' Although he was a rich, white boy from an affluent school and neighborhood, Clifford never let it get to his head. He poked fun at himself, especially when others laughed that he was chauffeured to school. To stifle the teasing he allowed some friends to be chauffeured too, complete with hotel amenities like chocolates, and a few sips of sparkling champagne. Eventually he decided to travel with his peers. The first time she ever saw him on the cheese bus, she grabbed the opportunity to sit next to him and strike up a conversation. Clifford proved to be sweet and intelligent. Despite some obvious differences, they struck up an intrinsic friendship. She felt they could exchange thoughts and ideas freely. One of their similarities was the fact that their fathers often let business come between family. The only woman in Clifford's life was his wily grandma. She was glad she had her mother and her grandmother to rely on. Her father's parents all but ignored her. She was particularly touched by Clifford's compassion for the boy with the big green jacket. Clifford dared to befriend this boy and ever since, she noticed a change in his demeanor. The big, young man's eyes now averted toward the head of the class, he took notes, and he wasn't afraid to make eye contact with anyone…anyone it seemed, but her. Her name was Evalyn, Eva, or Evie, depending on who talked to her. She loved this English class, and sat in the center of the second row from the right. She wore a full head of dark, coarse curls pulled back into a long, frizzy ponytail, but today she was brave like Shelly and wore it wild with a pink headband. Before going to school, it was her daily ritual to stare disgruntled in her full-length mirror. Her burgeoning curves were taking forever to appear. Her mother had an abundance of them. Where did she come from? She had no chest to show off, not like Leilani, the platinum blonde that every boy drooled over. So she hid herself in plaid shirts and baggy jeans. Better that than to be called a string bean or a girl's worst nightmare- flat-chested. Her friend Shelly was called a beanpole, but even she had curves. It was the first week of spring, and the weather turned warm. No more hiding. She wore a purple and pink striped top with feminine poufy sleeves and black jeans; she even dared to use make-up. She read enough fashion magazines to learn how to line her eyes properly, but she had to go light on the glamor, her mother would be disappointed. As much as the new decade of 1980 demanded it of them, a woman didn't need makeup to succeed. It was her mind that got her anywhere in life, not her beauty, and Evie had an A+ mind. Her mother, an entrepreneur with her own catering service, made sure of that. \"You have to try twice as hard, baby doll.\" Her mother told her. \"You're not only a female with smarts, but you're half-black and most people will only see that half. You know how it goes, Eva.\" Evie was often told she was beautiful – light mocha skinned, with huge black eyes and a wide pretty mouth, complemented by a friendly smile. Sometimes she felt her nose was too long, but at least it turned up 'cute' at the end. Nevertheless, some of the kids in school called her names; some were lame and harmless like, 'Oreo cookie' and 'brownie,' one old woman once told her she had a 'touch of the tar brush,' while other old people just said she was 'high yellow.' Many of her black peers called her a sell-out, and many of her white peers didn't know what to make of her. They got annoyed realizing they constantly had to watch their tongues around her with how they spoke of different races. It was all a bunch of nonsense to her and she finally wised up instead of crying in the back of the girl's bathroom. She now simply told them that she was only part of one race – human. But the digs still hurt. Some days she felt just as much an outcast as Ricky Linderman…the boy with the big green jacket. Ricky disappeared for three days since the incident with Moody's bodyguard Mike. \"He'll be back, he's just recuperating and stuff. He's embarrassed. I would be! Ricky could have slaughtered him but he kept his cool, that was the amazing part.\" Shelly said to everyone, and she was always right. Some said he dropped out of school again, others said he was arrested, and some cruelly joked that he killed himself. Evie derided them for that one. She saw the hesitation scars upon Ricky's wrist a long while back. She wondered if his life was still a tragedy waiting to happen. Clifford didn't seem himself either. He looked exhausted, mussy, and a little shell-shocked, as if hiding a deep, dark secret. Evie approached him at lunch. \"A penny for your thoughts, Cliff? You look horrible, no offense. What happened to Ricky? Did you guys get into a fight? Is he alright? In jail? He's not dead is he?\" She tried to cover all the bases within one breath. Clifford lowered his head in his arms. \"A lot happened to Ricky, but, no, he's not dead...at least I hope not. When I left him he was a mess. I've looked all over Chicago for him, he's nowhere .\" Evie slid into the seat and put an arm over his shoulder. \"That's really not good. Please, tell me about it.\" \"I can't.\" \"Why not? Did you make a promise?\" \"Not really, but Ricky never told anyone before. It wouldn't be right.\" Evie rocked him a little. \"Come on, Cliff. I swear on my grandmother that I won't tell another living soul. If you tell me what he told you, I'll even let you in on a secret.\" Clifford raised his head. Evie was an open book. He wanted to be relieved of the weight of Ricky's confession. Ricky never said to keep it a secret. \"Not a soul, Evie?\" \"Nope.\" \"Okay. Ricky told me what really happened with his brother. He didn't find him dead; he accidentally killed him when they were playing with their dad's gun. He was so scared, he made it look like a suicide by putting the gun in his hand.\" Clifford said quickly. The brevity of all Ricky told him finally struck Clifford. \"Aww, man. I shouldn't have said anything, damn! I'm a horrible friend!\" It took Evie a moment to compose herself and pick her jaw up off the floor. She quenched the sob ready to escape her throat. She stared at Clifford sympathetically. \"Oh wow, Clifford. No wonder he's such a mess. He feels constant guilt. What an awful secret to hold in for so long. My poor Ricky!\" She sniffled. Her eyes blurred with tears and he cocked his head confused. \"Why are you crying, Evie?\" \"Jeeze, louise, Cliff! I'm crying cuz it's damn sad!\" She said abruptly, then lowered her voice when others peered in their direction. \"You didn't cry when he told you?\" Clifford shrugged and picked at the mystery meat on his lunch tray. He wouldn't admit that he did shed a few tears after Ricky left the train platform that night. He never would. \"Why should I? It's not my brother. I was too shocked anyway.\" \"That's just like a man, isn't it? Always gotta suck in your feelings.\" \"Wouldn't wanna be a woman. Then I'd be crying every second, aside from that gross stuff every month.\" \"Very funny, Cliff.\" Eva sipped her chocolate milk contemplatively. \"It totally makes sense why he ran away and stuff. My poor Ricky is really a gentle giant. He doesn't want to hurt anyone, but all everyone does is tell lies about him!\" Clifford snagged a few of her French fries. \"What's up with this ' My poor Ricky' stuff? You got something going on with him?\" Evie bristled under his stare, but shook her head regrettably. \"No…and that's my secret. I'm in love with Ricky, Cliff. I'm utterly and hopelessly in love with Ricky Linderman and he never gives me the time of day. I mean, he doesn't really give it to anyone, but he's talked to some of the other girls, even Shelly had a few conversations with him. Why not me?\" Clifford was still bowled over by her admission. \"Ricky? He's a big white dude, I thought you might go for someone more…\" Evie narrowed her eyes. \"More what, Cliff? More… black?\" \" Nooo… I was going to say… tan!\" He coughed embarrassed. \"I can like whomever I want, and I like Ricky. His beauty transcends all races I think, and he actually has a good tan. Now that the weather's warm, it's coming in nice and deep.\" Clifford snorted. \"Oh boy! You do got it bad. So that's it? That's your big secret? I knew that already. So did he.\" Evie gaped at him. \"You did not! And no he didn't!\" \"Sure I did. You're always making google eyes at him, and I saw the heart with your initials on your desk in Biology. Classic crush. Ricky saw it too.\" Evie grimaced. \"That was a mistake. I zoned out.\" She wondered what Ricky thought of her affections, but Clifford wasn't saying. \"Sure, I get it, you were dreaming of body chemistry, huh?\" Clifford teased. Evie flicked a pea at him. \"Chill out, Clifford. Don't tell anyone okay?\" Clifford crossed his heart. \"I promise. If I can keep a secret like…wait a minute, I didn't keep it, I told you.\" Evie hugged him. \"Don't worry. I won't say a word. If there's anyone around here you could trust, it's me…me and Shelly!\" Clifford laughed. \"Shelly? She'd have it printed up in the school newspaper by tomorrow's edition. She's a blabbermouth! A blabbermouth!\" He waved his hands wildly and attempted to impersonate Ralph Kramden from The Honeymooners when heranted about his mother-in-law. Eva laughed. \"Shelly is very sensitive and caring… and you know what, I think you like her.\" She teased him. \"No I don't.\" \"Yes you do. You guys hang out a lot. That's great, because you look so cute together. The sophomore spring dance is coming up, you better ask her, Clifford. I think she's waiting.\" Clifford jumped up and tossed his lunch tray in the pail beside the table. \"Really? Fine, I guess I'll ask Shelly…but only if you ask Ricky.\" \"Are you crazy? He doesn't even know I exist.\" \"You're exaggerating, but if you feel that way then make him know. You're a brave woman, Evie. You could be shy, but you're not afraid to make friends. That's the deal. Take it or leave it.\" Clifford said smugly. Evie sighed and held out her hand to shake on it. \"You and your deals, Cliff. Fine. I'll ask him. But you ask Shelly first, because I thought of it first.\" \"Not until Ricky comes back. Otherwise it's not fair if he doesn't.\" \"Okay. Bell's gonna ring, Cliff, and I have to get to the fifth floor, it takes forever. Talk to you later?\" Clifford held her arm serious. \"Of course, and remember, don't breathe anything about Ricky's story.\" \"I already swore, I hate swearing like that and my grandmother is still alive too.\" She pouted. \"Thanks Evie. I feel a little better now.\" Later: After School and the bully fight \"Did you see that final punch? That was wicked!\" Clifford gloated. \"I'll be surprised if Moody can ever breathe from his nose again!\" \"That wouldn't be so different, he'd have to keep his mouth open…and he's always got his fat mouth open!\" Shelly said and nudged him appreciatively. \"Somebody needed to end his tyranny and I'm glad it was you.\" Clifford stared at her and realized Evie was right. Shelly did like him. He twisted his fist proudly. \"It's all in the reflexes, Shelly, darling.\" Ricky Linderman pushed his motorbike off to the side and shook his head with a little grin. Clifford was having his moment in the sun, and he wasn't about to take it away from him. He and Clifford, Cartman, and Shelly all left the park together and a few other straggling teens joined them down the pathway to glory…and burgers and fries at the local hangout. Fighting bullies was hard work and after-school starvation settled in. They were guaranteed the joint would now be Moody free. As they approached the entrance, a girl stood outside and Ricky recognized her from English class. Evie waved shyly. \"Hi guys! I left before too much blood was spilled…kinda got scared of a riot.\" \"Nahh, Clifford handled everything just fine…and so did Ricky! Did you see how he knocked that blockhead Mike flat on his back? The guy was out cold and then he ran with his tail between his legs!\" Shelly pumped her fists up. Evie noticed Ricky duck his head from the praise. Modest man. She loved it. \"Yeah, I caught that. He'll never live it down. You mind if I join you?\" She asked. \"Sure, why not? There's always room for more admirers.\" Clifford led the way into the luncheonette and grabbed a big table. The after-school hordes dispersed because of the fights. Evie hung back outside and watched Ricky chain up his motorbike. \"How's your nose?\" \"Been better.\" \"Is it broken?\" She asked worried. \"Naw, just swollen. He didn't really get me there.\" \"Good! It's bleeding. Here, use this.\" She passed him a white hankie. \"It's clean, I promise. My mother says I should always carry one for emergencies. I'd say this is one.\" Ricky arely noticed the bleeding. He took it gratefully and patted his sore nostrils. A delicate scent of sweet shea butter pleased his senses. \"Thanks, you don't want it back do ya?\" \"Uh, no…you can keep it.\" Ricky held open the door for her as they went inside. Clifford ordered cheese burgers, fries and cokes all around. \"Oh man, Cliff. I wanted the caviar and steak.\" Ricky joked. \"You should have us all over to the hotel sometime, they got some real good grub there.\" \"Gee, someone's hungry!\" Cartman piped up. Clifford punched Ricky's arm playfully. \"He's a growing boy, he has to eat. What do you think? I'd say he has another four inches to go.\" \"Statistically, boys sprout the most in their early twenties, I'd say only two more, and lots of muscles.\" Shelly said smartly. \"Thanks, Shell. But not if I keep eating the crap at this rinky dink place.\" Ricky struggled on the edge of the booth with one leg sprawled in the center aisle. Evie waited alongside the table. He glanced at her and promptly stood up. \"Go ahead, Evie, have a seat.\" \"Yeah, squeeze in guys, she can make it, Evie's skinny.\" \"I'm not that skinny.\" Evie protested. \"No, Ricky, you're tired, you need to get off your feet.\" \"I'm not an old geezer. Besides, my butt cheek is hanging off and it's really not comfortable, ya know?\" Everyone laughed and Evie slowly sank down alongside Clifford…but then she noticed a small booth across the way and hopped up to grab it. \"On second thought. I'm the tag-a-long here. I'll just sit over there and come by in a few minutes.\" Evie hurried to the window booth and plopped down nervous. Clifford nudged Ricky's shins. \"You should go over there. I think she has something to tell you.\" He winked. Ricky looked between the two confused. \"What?\" Clifford smiled mysteriously. \"Why don't you go find out?\" \"Okay….\" Ricky sat across from Evie and to her surprise, smiled warmly at her. What a smile it was. \"I've been punted from the group. And to think I taught that little guy everything he knows.\" \"I see, and it paid off too. It's alright, I'm used to being the outcast.\" \"Me too. I'm not gonna cry over it now. What makes you an outcast?\" He asked innocently. \"Well, it's kinda tough being two races at once. You don't know what you are or who you're supposed to be.\" She admitted. Ricky was surprised at the depth of her answer. If he knew anything about Evie, it was that she was a deep thinker and always made insightful comments in class. He admired that. \"Why do you gotta pick one? Be an individual.\" \"That's what I try to do, but it's not so easy…I…I don't have a lot of contact with my dad, he's white, and he's always away on business. It's kinda weird when I'm with him and his crowd anyway. I feel like they don't approve of me. My parents are divorced.\" \"Oh, sorry. So, you're saying you're more surrounded by black people cause of your mom?\" \" Yeah! And sometimes her relatives look at me cross-eyed too. I don't care either way, I can have fun everywhere, but…I don't know, Ricky, I can't really explain it.\" She faltered. She didn't want to bore him, but when she looked into his eyes, she saw his keen fascination with her. She felt giddy inside. Ricky noticed her hand curled up in the center of the table and he dared to pat it. \"Then don't explain anything. Just forget about it and be yourself. It doesn't bother me.\" \"It doesn't?\" \" Nahh. Why?\" Ricky suddenly realized his hand still lingered over hers, and he kept it there. \"Should it?\" Evie smiled coyly. \"That's great! I mean, I thought you…\" A sudden shout of laughter and 'Ooohs!' burst out from across the way. Shelly looked beet red and Clifford was ready to slide under the table. \"Wonder what happened now?\" Ricky asked. \"I'll go get our food.\" \"You're such a gentleman, Ricky.\" Evie blurted out. \"I guess my mom raised me to be.\" He smiled. When Ricky walked away, Evie caught Clifford's eye and he raised his thumb affirmatively and then pointed at her. It was her turn. She took a deep breath as Ricky came back to the table with their food baskets and dug in. \"Did you hear the news? Clifford's taking Shelly to the spring dance.\" He said with little enthusiasm between chews. \"I heard! That's dyn-o-mite! What's the matter, aren't you going?\" Evie could have kicked herself. Her invitation just sank to the lower depths. \"Me? I don't go to those things.\" \"Why not?\" \"Why should I? I'm not into all that ra-ra-school spirit stuff.\" \"It's not like that. They're just fun with friends.\" Ricky tried to hide his sarcasm. \"In case you haven't noticed, I'm not the 'fun' type.\" \"How do you know? You ever try to be?\" \"Sure, I've tried, and I've been fun, but I'm just not feeling up to a dance right now.\" \"Well you have a month to think about it. You don't know how to dance, do you?\" Ricky blushed. \"Nahh, I don't think I have to know that to make it through life.\" \"It's really easy, and half the time you just make stuff up. I could, I could teach you.\" She offered. \"Are you a dancer?\" \"Well, I know some moves. I took dancing when I was little.\" \"Save your time, I'm not going.\" \"But you have to!\" Evie said exasperated. Ricky looked at her oddly. \"Says who?\" Evie calmed down, she didn't want to make a complete fool of herself. \" Me. I wanted to ask you…\" A slow thud built up in Ricky's heart and he saw Clifford watching the table. The little manipulator struck again. He knew exactly what Evie wanted. Ricky didn't want to be rude to her. \"Ask me what?\" His blue eyes flickered left to right and he chewed his inner cheeks. \"Ricky, would you go to the spring dance with me? I don't have a date yet and I'd really like if it were you.\" She gulped. Ricky's hand stopped in mid-air and he crushed the French fry between his thumb and forefinger. Why did this invitation shock him when he readily expected it just a second ago? Because as he stared into her deep, earnest eyes, a tiny light bulb went off in his head with a voice that said, \" Do it and save yourself.\" \"Uh… uhh …Evie… yeah...\" He nodded firmly. \"Yes, I'll go with you. But don't expect miracles.\" A squeal of happiness burst from her and she leaped up and kissed his cheek. \"Ricky, Thank you! We'll really have a good time. No ra-ra stuff. I promise.\" She gently hugged him over his shoulders and Ricky's heart beat normally again. Not only was she pretty, she was affectionate in a touchy-feely way. He could get used to that. Clifford recently told him it was time for a girlfriend and the more the talked the more he wanted it to be her. Clifford started a round of clapping and Ricky glared at him. \"If you start singing, 'For he's a jolly good fellow' I might have to do to you what I did to Mike!\" He warned. \"Those fists won't save you!\" Clifford wagged his hands. \"I won't! I promise.\" \"Ricky, I have a question.\" Evie sobered. She didn't forget the sad truth of Ricky's life, but it was one step at a time. \"Yeah?\" \"Are you always gonna wear that big green jacket?\" Her question had a deeper meaning than regards a fashion statement. He pulled at the zippers and held out his arm. \"It's kinda hot in here, can you help me get it off? My arm's a little stiff.\" Evie grinned and tugged on the sleeve until it slid down, then helped him with the other side. He tossed it next to him. \"Thanks, now where were we? You said you could teach me how to dance. I think we should go see Clifford's grandma, she knows how to trip the light fantastic...\" The End. These one-shots are fun! Thanks to MarieDee on FF for her inspiration to write another MB story, she has some great ones up, check them out! ","Summary":" A/N: Evie is not exactly an 'OC.' There was a pretty character in Clifford and Ricky's class played"},{"Movie":"My Bodyguard","Title":"Clifford Struggles","Author":"Erzsebeth Bathory","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5665248","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners and others associated with legal rights. Author's note: I've had this story sitting in my notebook for some time. In the movie, Clifford came off as sensible and mature-a clear thinking young man compared to the rest of his peers. But would he be as confident when it came to girls? I decided to play with this idea and make him a little not-so-confident when it came to his own feelings. The girl in question? I dunno, I just threw a girl there so what she looks like can be up to you, the readers. Will Clifford be able to pull off asking her out on a date? I believe so :) And yeah, yeah, you probably already noticed my heavy preference to the Ricky/Shelley pairing XD Go Clifford! \"Clifford Struggles\" \"Hi, my name is Clifford. You and I have English together with Ms. Jump. Heh, well, yeah, you probably already know that. Um… I was just wondering if you'd wanna go out sometime?\" He stared dumbfounded at his own reflection in the bathroom mirror and saw that his entire face was glowing red. \"Ugh.\" He ran his hands over his face a couple of times, allowing time for his emotions to calm down. Swallowing a couple of gulps of air, he tried again, this time with a smooth looking smile. \"Hey, how about that English assignment?\" He chuckled. \"You think you'll be needing any help with it? Oh, you do? I'm free this weekend if you wanna… go the movies afterward? My dad runs a nice hotel we can eat at…\" He suddenly faltered. \"No, no… wait…\" Now he was sounding desperate. He didn't want to frighten the poor girl. He needed to get this down right so when he was ready, he would come off as suave-not stupid. \"Okay.\" Clearing his throat, he took another stab. \"Hey, you probably already know me. I sit a few rows away from you in English. Do you want to go out sometime? We can… um…\" His voice trailed off and he stared helplessly at his reflection. Defeat was eminent in his eyes alone. Why did asking a girl out have to be so hard? It shouldn't be. Growing up, he was surrounded by adults and in his private schools, he was with other well educated and articulated students. Asking someone out should be a piece of cake. So why was his skin changing colors like a chameleon and his voice cracking? Practicing in front of a mirror should have been a sensible way to build his self-confidence. Yet every time he started talking, his own image vanished and was replaced by the gorgeous girl in his English class: soft looking skin, beautiful eyes, moist pink lips… Squeezing his eyes shut, he leaned his forehead against the mirror and groaned. He just had to go about this alone, didn't he? Though he had thought about asking his father for advice in the beginning, he didn't want to bother him during his hectic hours managing the hotel. The poor guy had enough stress to handle. Plus, he didn't want to get his hopes up if things didn't turn out well. His feisty grandmother would no doubt become aware of his situation soon enough, because she seemed to know everything that was going on. He knew she would advise him to be honest with his feelings and just flat out ask the girl out. I'm trying to, I'm trying to, he kept thinking to himself as he pushed back against the wall behind him and tilted his head up to the ceiling, eyes opening once more. Most of his friends wouldn't be of any help to him, because while they were good friends (he never questioned that), they just weren't experienced enough in the dating world. The only ones that came to mind were Linderman and Shelley. But then again, Shelley was the one who asked Linderman out. The big guy, who probably frightened more girls than attracted them, got into the dating scene only because the quirky and upbeat girl took the bull by the horns with her own churning feelings. Things would be a lot easier if that same thing happened to him. But of course it wouldn't happen, because life wanted to challenge him. Plus, he would just imagine both Linderman and Shelley telling him the same thing that Gramma would tell him: just ask the girl out. \"I'm trying,\" he said out loud. Looking over at his reflection once more, he decided to give it another go. Though sadly, he couldn't help but feel that confronting bullies seemed a heck of a lot easier than this.

This story is for entertainment purposes only. I borrowed a bit of the dialogue from the movie but it's not 100% accurate. \"A Change of Pace\" Like the rest of the kids in school, Shelley used to be afraid of Ricky Linderman. She believed in the rumors: that he killed a kid, he raped a teacher, and other such violent acts. But it would take the persistence of the new (well, former new) guy, Clifford Peache to help realize that the dangerous Linderman wasn't so dangerous and that he was actually a good and decent guy who didn't like violence unless someone he cared about was getting hurt. \"Where's Clifford?\" she asked as she walked her bicycle alongside Ricky's motorbike down the familiar pathway through the park. Summer vacation was fast approaching, and the late afternoon heat was gradually cooling down. Under normal circumstances, wherever Linderman was, so was Clifford. They were best friends and where one guy was, the other was surely a step behind. They worked good together. \"Him and his grandma are visiting his mom's grave,\" Ricky answered after a moment of silence. \"He'll be back tomorrow.\" \"Gotcha.\" She looked down at her fingers wrapped around her handle bars. She suddenly felt so nervous being alone with him. It wasn't because they were alone for the first time, but it was her lingering feelings for the boy that made her stop. Meanwhile Linderman walked on for a few more moments until he stopped and noticed her lack of pace. Looking over his shoulder, he gave her a strange look. \"What?\" he asked. \"Can I ask you something?\" She lifted her eyes and gazed over at him. She studied his hard features, his narrow eyes, and almost forgot what she wanted to say. He said nothing, and she realized he must be waiting for her to continue. \"This Saturday, there's this… well, there's this movie…\" Suddenly she heard Melvin Moody's voice emerge from her memories. \"Hey, Shelley. Do you want to go to the movies?\" She felt her heart soar in her chest. Finally, this was her chance! \"I guess so. Sure!\" He grinned at her and played it cool as he casually, but cruelly replied, \"Okay, have a good time while you're there.\" Crestfallen, she fought back the urge to cry and show disappointment to the guy who was constantly putting her down or ignoring the pleasant gestures she did for him. Moody was good with manipulating people. No matter how nice she treated him, he always either brushed her off or treated her like crap. There was never a middle ground with him, and she was always hurt in the end. She'd always laugh it off later, vowing to somehow get him to really notice her. But deep down, it pained her immensely, knowing that he seemed to get away with everything yet at the same time still be so enticing. But Linderman was different; even though he was the biggest kid in school and he was unquestionably tough, he didn't flaunt himself in front of everybody. He was so sincere with his feelings and while he wasn't as gorgeous as Moody, it was his personality and his morals, and that he stood up to bullies, that made him much more appealing to her. The more she hung out with him, the more she wanted to be with him. Plus, he didn't talk as much as Moody and it was nice to get a word in edge-wise during a conversation. \"So... do you wanna go to the movies with me, Ricky?\" Linderman was silent. She looked down at her handlebars, as if finding some renewed fascination with them, but really she was afraid of seeing his reaction to her asking him out. She couldn't bear to be rejected again - not again and especially not from someone like Linderman. Lifting her eyes, she saw Ricky towering over her, as he'd brought himself and his bike over to her without making a sound. He wasn't too close to her, but at the same time it was the closest they've ever stood together. Normally they had Clifford with them or Carson or one of the other guys. Now it was just the two of them. \"What movie?\" Ricky asked casually, his hardened features brightening for the first time. Pleasantly surprised, Shelley had a feeling that this time around, things would work out for her. ","Summary":" Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners. This story is for entertainment purpo"},{"Movie":"My Bodyguard","Title":"The Blue Hour","Author":"Erzsebeth Bathory","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5909103","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners. Author's note #1: This is sort of a \"what if?\" scenario that follows some time after the previous My Bodyguard fanfic \"Shallow.\" Many, many thanks to Mrs. Phineas Bogg for the inspiration behind this and virtually all of my MB stories. \"The Blue Hour\" The Belmont Harbor was quiet and tranquil as twilight peaked. Across the waters, the windows in the buildings that occupied North Lake Shore Drive and West Belmont Avenue gradually lit up one by one. \"What's special about this place?\" Leilani asked as she stood wearily next to Clifford with her arms folded on top of the steel barrier in front of her. Most of her dates would have taken her someplace warmer-like the inside of a mall or a movie theater. Though she had to admit this place was kind of nice in spite of the cold, especially when there weren't too many people around. The local shops were beginning to shut down their hours of operation and with the skies not too bright but not too dark, it did offer a romantic atmosphere. Well, at least she tried to think of it that way. \"My mom used to ride her bike along the harbors, and she liked this particular spot,\" Clifford stated as he stepped up on a small platform in front of him and admire the view from a slightly higher vantage point. His lean body pressed against the rail as he bent forward ever so slightly, as if he wanted to reach out and touch the structures on the other side. \"This is where she asked my dad to marry him.\" \"Yeah?\" This instantly drew Leilani's attention. \"How sweet! Your parents still married?\" Clifford's features dampened a bit as he observed the mild, lapping waters below. \"No, she died a while ago. Car accident.\" \"… I'm sorry.\" She chewed on her lower lip as she regretted making him admit such a painful reminder. Then again, it wasn't as if she knew that his mom was dead. At least he didn't act sore over it like most people would. It was one of the reasons why she liked Clifford Peache-he was so easy-going. Clifford's face lightened once more and he shifted his attention onto the blonde, who was now an inch shorter than him because of where he was standing. Leilani had such a gorgeous smile. He could see why she was one of the most sought after girls in school. She was very attractive, especially with the way her light colored hair framed her face seamlessly. Never the less, it continued to amaze him: how someone like her wanted to (willingly) be with someone like him. \"No worries, Leilani. You didn't know.\" He used the tip of his well-worn sneaker to push a tiny concrete rock off of the platform. It tumbled off the harbor and plopped into the water beneath them. \"How about your parents? They married?\" Leilani started rubbing her upper arms and silently wishing she hadn't forgotten her jacket at school. She just had to go for the sleek, sleeveless blouse instead of the sensible but not-as-flashy long sleeved shirt she bought the other day. \"Barbara lives in California with her third husband. It's just me and Daddy.\" He didn't miss the bitterness in her tone or the fact that she referred to her mother by her first name. Apparently, she lived with a parent who probably did the best he could to raise his daughter-just like his own father did whatever he could to support him and Gramma. However, not having that second parent, dead or long distance, was sometimes upsetting to acknowledge, no matter how much time passed. Clifford unfastened his own jacket and carefully placed it over Leilani's bare shoulders. \"Sorry, it's all I have.\" Her fingers latched onto the thick, warm material now covering her. She could smell his scent on the jacket. It was a clean aroma, not like the heavy cologne her past dates abused themselves with, which often made her want to gag. On top of that, none of them would had ever offered such a chivalrous gesture that Clifford demonstrated-well, at least not without expecting something in return. \"What about you?\" she asked, experiencing a sense of relief as the goosebumps on her flesh disappeared. \"Won't you get cold?\" Clifford shrugged as he hopped down from the platform and smirked. \"It's no biggie. I didn't want you to get sick.\" Without saying a word, the young woman leaned forward and planted a kiss on one of his cheeks. He caught a whiff of her alluring lilac perfume as she drew her lips away but remained just inches apart. Clifford noisily cleared his throat and felt his cheeks burn, all the while trying to feign that nothing spectacular happened. \"H-How about I… I take us to get some… um… some dinner? T-The head chef at the hotel's a... a cool guy. He makes these really great steaks you… you should try 'em. Then there's this local band-they're really good-they'll be putting on a performance in the ball room tonight. Maybe we can… go dancing? Heh, I can really get down and boogey, y'know. Or we can…\" Leilani giggled quietly as he rambled on, gradually becoming more confident with himself. He definitively had to be the sweetest boy she knew. But then the nagging thoughts dampened her spirits. They often popped up whenever her feelings for Clifford grew more serious: if only he was taller, wore better (preferably designer) clothes, fixed his hair so it wasn't so poofy, played sports, didn't hang out with those geeks… \"Ugh, just forget it,\" Leilani muttered as she forcefully pushed aside her pesky, negative judgments. She grabbed a fist full of Clifford's shirt and yanked him against her body until her lips captured his into a deep kiss. The walls had crumbled and there was no turning back. Author's note #2: So... that's it! I'm not too sure if there will be another expansion on these two, but I kinda had fun writing them in this type of situation. The dancing Clifford mention was (once again) inspired from Mrs. Phineas Bogg's previous MB stories: the two in particular from \"All the right moves\" and \"The boy with the big green jacket.\" Now I have the song \"Maniac\" stuck in my head-the Flashdance version, mind you. Though I thought the original version based on the 1980's horror film's pretty funny too XD ","Summary":" Disclaimer: All characters belong to their respective owners.

I just wish there was more fanfiction for this classic flick : \"Fat Chance\" He thought he could get at least one girl to look at him respectively before the school year ended. However, he didn't expect her to turn him flat down. \"Sorry, Melvin. You had your chance.\" He placed a hand on the wall beside her face and leaned forward, granting her an up-close look at his handsome face - nose no longer broken and free of bandages for the first time. \"You were only too eager to try and get my attention before,\" he reminded her coolly. \"Now's your chance, baby. I'm all yours.\" She rolled her eyes in disgust as she used her index finger to press against his chest, forcing him to stand back. \"Melvin,\" she continued sternly and clearly unafraid, \"like I said, you had your chance. But what you did to everybody was totally wrong. You were a complete creep and it makes me sick to think that I even liked you before.\" Unphased, he asked, \"And… the problem is…?\" \"Forget it! I'm already seeing somebody-somebody that doesn't enjoy torturing and extorting others on a daily basis.\" He frowned. \"Who?\" She folded her arms across her sweater-clad chest and grinned. \"Oh, I think you know him very well. You had to get your own bodyguard to match up to him.\" His eyebrows furrowed as he quickly realized whom she was speaking of. \"What? That ape? You and him?\" \"Problem, Melvin?\" She gladly enjoyed seeing him upset. He was like a jealous ex-boyfriend, even though the two of them had never gone out. Once upon a time she would only dream of having him take her on a romantic date. Of course this was before she learned of how much of an ass he was. He slammed his fist against a nearby locker, spun around on his heels, and stormed down the hallway.

I'm glad you did. I know it's kinda early, but hey, you got outta school. Have a seat and get comfy, we got a lot to talk about.\" Ricky Linderman edged his way into his uncle's cramped office and pulled up a wooden chair across from his cluttered desk. His uncle leaned on the windowsill with one long leg hanging down and the other curved up to his chest. He played with the blinds to let a smattering of sunshine in and cracked open the window. Ricky kept his gaze on the dusty rays of light that shone through the chinks. His uncle adjusted the strap of his gun holster and pulled it off his broad shoulders. The dark circles under his eyes betrayed his fatigue. He stroked his fingers through his silvered, brown curly hair and frowned. \"I think it's time for a haircut…least that's what Ronnie's been telling me for the last few months. When you coming over for her lasagna? Angie really misses you too. \" \"I don't know, uncle Albert. I've been busy…but, I still love it, and the princess. The Barbie castle must be pretty lonely without Ken. I got her cards and the latest mug shot from picture day.\" Ricky grinned a little and patted near his wallet and chain. He adored his fun aunt, Veronica, and her fantastic Italian cooking expertise, and off the cuff sense of humor. His adorable six-year old niece Angelica inexplicably clung to him as he did to his uncle Albert in his younger years. He really missed them both. His uncle placed his holster on top of a gray file cabinet. The handle of the gun faced Ricky and he winced. He shifted his focus on the burning cigarette in the gold tin ashtray. It surprised him, considering his uncle had quit three years ago. The smoke choked him up, but it was more his fear. He leaned over and stubbed it out. \"I thought you kicked this habit? What was so important that I come down here, uncle Albert?\" Ricky squirmed under his fixed, blue-eyed stare. Albert Linderman was his father's younger brother at forty. He was working his way toward Police Captain at the downtown Chicago station and was currently one of their brightest detectives on the force. He was cynical and tough, with a shark-eyed glare that'd make anyone cower and confess, but he also had a kind heart and good sense of humor…once you broke the ice. His stature and broad, handsome features commanded immediate attention whenever he walked into a room. Ricky admired him completely. Albert helped raise Ricky the same way Ricky practically raised his little brother. While his parents weren't deadbeats, they were often stuck in their own mundane world of work and pleasure, and pretty much failed to connect emotionally with their children. Ricky's mother tried harder than his father. That was where Albert and Veronica stepped in to carry the load. Ricky found a solid male figure to relate to and they were best buddies, until the tragedy that took his brother's life. Ricky became a shell of his former self and shunned the world. His entire family changed. His mother went from a vivacious school teacher to a frumpy housewife with rollers in her hair all day. His father just stared blindly at the television and often drank himself into grief stricken stupors. Ricky would never say that Albert didn't try and reconnect or understand their plight, because he tried hard, with sweat and many tears that only Ricky and Veronica knew he had the capacity for. Ricky's uncle was the first to be called on the scene the night Ricky attempted to slit his wrists. His distraught mother found him writhing on the bathroom floor and moaning \"I'm sorry!\" non-stop. Albert stepped up to the plate and forced Ricky into therapy, and it was Albert that pushed him to return to school the following semester. The man was a pillar and Ricky often wondered if he'd be dead without him. Albert flicked the cigarette stub in the trash and dumped out the ashes. \"I know, Rick, I was having some deep thoughts and craved it. It happens. I'll kick it when you kick it.\" He frowned and wiped his hands on his slacks. He slumped in the rolling chair behind the desk. \"I barely smoke, uncle Albert. I'm not addicted.\" \"You say that now. Aren't you hot in here? Take that stink jacket off. I'd open the window more, but it blows all my papers around.\" \"That's why you have a filing cabinet.\" Ricky pointed out. He sniffed his coat discreetly; it was getting a ripe from constant wear and car oil, but it didn't bother him. \"True…but who said I use it?\" Albert shrugged. \"I can never find a damn thing in their either.\" Ricky in fact, didn't want to remove his jacket; it was his way of hiding from the world and they both knew it. Albert leaned back and folded his arms behind his head. \"Well? The rack's over there.\" \"Uhh, no thanks, I wanna keep it on.\" \"All right…suit yourself, kiddo, and keep hibernating.\" Albert reached across the desk and Ricky's eyes widened as he picked up a manila case file with Ricky's name on it. He couldn't control the trembling in his legs. He was sure Albert noticed his reaction, but his uncle chose to ignore it. Albert tapped his fingers on the file and smiled. It was a dry and wry smile that Ricky was accustomed too, but it was laced with empathy and disappointment. Ricky hated to disappoint Albert, even more so than his own father. \"Promise me you'll hear me out before you storm off and never speak to me again, Rick.\" Albert asked quietly. Ricky took a few deep breaths and nodded slowly. He was prone to doing that, as his best friend Clifford Peache had learned the other night. \"Okay.\" \"No, say that you promise. I never broke a promise to you and this is the only time I'm going to seriously ask you to do the same for me.\" Albert replied gravely. Ricky tossed his hands up. \"Okay, I promise I won't leave until I hear you out.\" Albert opened the file. He rifled through its contents, but shielded it from Ricky's view. \"There's only so many ways I can say this…and believe me it's not easy. I've had many sleepless nights and bitter pangs of conscience…but I loved you too much to tell anyone.\" A sharp breath caught in Ricky's throat and he wrung his hands until they were clammy. His cheeks flushed with shame and anticipation. He closed his eyes briefly, trying to imagine what his uncle would reveal next. \"I know what you did, Ricky. I know that Chris didn't commit suicide. I'm sorry, but it's the truth.\" Ricky's eyes popped open and the breath he'd held in escaped with a loud burst. Did Albert know he was the killer? Yes. I know what you did, Ricky. Ricky hung his head even though Albert preferred eye contact at all times. His brow crinkled, his nose itched. Not now…he couldn't cry now. He had to hear the rest of Albert's story. Albert didn't scold him. He waited calmly for Ricky to come back to awareness. In his usual brusque manner he'd all but told the kid that he was guilty as charged. It was a tough pill to swallow and Ricky had been tough to crack in the last year of his ongoing depression. He refused to talk about the incident, he flushed the pills the psychologist prescribed, and he dropped out of school to spend his days holed up in the garages and junkyards while he worked on a secret project. Albert believed it was this project, which Ricky scrupulously attended to, that kept him stable and alive. Albert often prodded him about it with intense curiosity. He'd always known his nephew was mechanically inclined from the day he bought him a tinker toy set. At four years old, Ricky feverishly constructed his own airplanes, bikes, cars and all other doohickeys of his childhood imaginings. Ricky finally glanced at him and licked his lips. They'd parched. He stared at the water cooler and Albert sprang up to give him a paper cup of cold water. Ricky gulped it down and Albert passed him three more until he was satiated. Ricky balled up the cups and tossed them in the bin. \" Umm …what…what makes you say that, uncle Albert? Why this? Why now?\" It was an honest question, there always had to be sound reasoning for accusing people of heinous crimes. However, he choked on his words. They sounded terribly naïve. \"It's not that something made me say it, Ricky…it's something…I always knew.\" He admitted. Ricky's jaw dropped, here, his stalwart uncle, a man so full of integrity and justice…had let him get away with a horrible crime. Ricky's lower lip trembled. \"But…but why…how…how did you know? Why didn't you say anything? What was in it for you?\" Panic rose in Ricky's voice and he jumped out of the chair, startling Albert. Ricky wanted to lunge for the door, but he remembered his promise. Albert wasn't here to arrest him. He wanted to admit something to ease his own troubled conscience. Albert put his fingertips together and held his hands under his nose in deep concentration. He lowered his eyes and his jaw quivered as he explained. \"I put myself on the line, Ricky. But I insisted you were innocent! Your desperation alone told me that whatever had happened, it wasn't an intentional murder. You loved Chris, we all did…I blame my brother for all this! I told Richard to keep that freaking gun out of sight!\" Albert rubbed his face and took a sharp breath, allowing his own guilt to come to the fore. \"Hell, in the end, I blame myself! I was the one who'd convinced him to keep a gun in the first place. He kept you guys living in that slummy neighborhood and crime was getting bad. There were three reported break-ins in your area alone that week I convinced him. That was my big, damn mistake. The only people who should be carrying guns should be in law enforcement, not blue-collar maintenance men with no training. I told him how to handle it! I told him where to keep it…crap!\" Albert's careworn eyes teared up. \"I taught him while you and Chris were home. You kids must've heard everything. No wonder Chris found it. He probably knew how to load it himself. That kid may not have acted like it, but he was smart as a whip!\" Ricky sank into his chair again. The stuffiness of the room overwhelmed him. He remembered the night Albert brought the gun over. Chris was all over it, demanding to touch it, but Ricky kept him out of the room so the men could talk alone. He leaned forward on the desk, trying to maintain his calm and kept his voice steady. \"No, uncle Albert, don't blame yourself…you were trying to protect us. Chris…he…wasn't the one who took it out of the closet. He wanted to see it after I pulled it out. It was loaded, but I don't think dad even realized he forgot to remove the bullets. Chris didn't pull that trigger…I did! I lied and told everyone I found him that way.\" Admitting his guilt had come much easier since he'd tearfully told Clifford the truth the other night. Clifford had accepted his story with no qualms, but they were still kids. His uncle was a grown man and trained to find motive. \"Now you know the truth. But you still didn't say how you know that Chris didn't shoot himself?\" Ricky demanded, an edge crept into his voice. Albert wiped his eyes and stared at him. \"There were the obvious clues…the angle and entry of the bullet wound versus the position of the gun in his hand…the bullet somewhat deflected and hit your mother's china closet after it struck him. If he'd raised it to his head and pulled the trigger like that, the bullet might've still been lodged in his head. The fact that the gun was still in his hand after it fired…the impact would've been jarring and the recoil would've forced him to drop it. He was only eleven years old, and not used to that force. those are just some technicalities that got lost in the sauce. Poor kid.\" Albert clammed up, refusing to say more on the subject and Ricky got the hint. It really appeared that Albert did go out on a limb, perhaps even covering up vital aspects of the investigation. It was no wonder he felt troubled. This had been a disturbing week for both of them, Ricky supposed. The day before, Ricky's custom built motorbike was thrown into the pond near the school and he was almost pummeled by Moody and his bodyguard, Mike. Ricky had allowed it to happen, he didn't want his peers to have their biggest fears and suspicions about him confirmed. He was not a bully; he was not a killer…though presently, under the intense gaze of his uncle, he felt like he should be taking the long walk to the electric chair. Ricky's eyes filled with tears. What was the point of all this? \"You gonna tell my parents?\" He asked sullenly. Albert looked saddened, but shook his head. \"Your parents are already in their own hell…why should I push them any deeper? Besides, that will have to be your decision, when you feel the time is right. You know I'll support you in any way that I can…\" Ricky stood up again and kicked at the chair. He faced his uncle anguished. \"Why did you have to say anything to me, uncle Albert? Does it matter any more? You didn't tell on me then, are you gonna now? Why?\" Albert stood up and put out his hands. \"Calm down, Ricky. Obviously I'm not gonna tell on you…but I'm telling you for your own good. For your sanity. I wanted you to know that you're not alone here. You've been depressed to point of almost killing yourself and it scared the heck out of me! The only way to conquer that is to face up to your mistakes and get some help. I'm not a therapist or anything but I'm your family, and dammit, if no one else can help you, then I will!\" Ricky laughed. He didn't mean for it to come out so spiteful. \"You act like you're my father! You're not! You have a wife and daughter, take care of them and leave me alone! You're just my uncle!\" Albert strode from behind the table pushed up against him. He grabbed Ricky's collar and forced his gaze. \"An uncle that took care of you and your brother when no one else gave a damn! I wasn't trying to be your father, but sometimes I felt like it. Richard knew that…and he abused it! He knew I got along better with you than he did, for whatever stupid reasons he had. I don't really know. He's a big clam, like you. You both suck down your feelings until you can't stand straight, and then wallow in depression. Your father and I had it bad when we were kids. Our dad was an abusive drunk, okay? And being the oldest, your father got the brunt of his anger. Instead of becoming an abuser, he became an emotionless void and drank heavily. I saw how much that hurt you as a child and I couldn't stand it. Silence like that is just as destructive as abuse.\" Ricky shook himself from Albert's grip and bumped against the file cabinet. He wasn't stunned over this news. He'd always heard whispers of his grandfather's mistakes, he just never connected it to his own father's behavior. Ricky angrily rubbed his eyes. He didn't care if he cried in front of Albert anymore. \"So what are you saying? That my father doesn't love me? I don't understand all this!\" Albert slumped his shoulders and faced the window with his hands behind his back. \"No Ricky…not that. I'm just saying I love you too much to see you spiral. I'm afraid for you again! I haven't heard from ya in months. Every time I call, you're not home and the worst thoughts run through my head. Talk to me, Ricky. God, I don't want to get a cop blotter telling me they found the body of teenaged boy in some sewer or an alley. Tell me what's been going on!\" Ricky confused his uncle when he gave him a wide smile. He put his arm over his shoulder and led him to his chair and sat him down. Ricky removed his coat and slung it over the coat hanger on the door. His uncle deserved to know that up until yesterday's debacle with the bullies, he'd been fine because he had opened up, and he had talked…and made a new friend. Ricky spent the next half-hour telling Albert about school and his growing friendship with Clifford and others. The glare of happiness in Albert's eyes moved Ricky to more tears. He finally admitted to the incident with Mike and Moody. \"So that's that. I don't know what to do now, uncle Albert. If I don't come back, I'm a failure and a coward, and people will start more rumors about me. I don't want that anymore, but…I'm scared.\" He admitted. Albert came around the desk in front of Ricky, he folded his arms and leaned against it. \"I know, Rick. It's not easy coming out of something as serious as this and then deal with immature high school crap. I remember I couldn't wait to finish. I had real problems at home. A drunken father and a flaky mother who hardly stood up for us. I didn't care who I was taking to the prom or about the SAT scores…let the others worry about that and have their stupid fun, right?\" \"Right! That's really not important anyway. It's just a dance.\" Ricky mumbled. The spring formal was coming up and some of the girls at school had given him the inviting eye, but he just wasn't ready for all that. Albert patted his back. \"True, but you know? Sometimes we have to humble ourselves.\" Ricky glanced up. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, don't push yourself to be so grown up yet. This is your life right now. These are the circumstances that surround you. It's getting through the little stuff like this that builds character later in life, and gives you pleasant memories. I look back and I wish I were more active in High School activities. It would've helped me take my mind off the mess at home. I don't have to tell you what to do here, Ricky. What do you want to do?\" Ricky fiddled with the new chain on his belt loop. Mike had ruined the other one. His face darkened. \"I want my bike back, uncle Albert.\" \"Then you go get it!\" \"But…everyone will be there.\" \"And? It's yours. You worked hard on it, so go for it.\" \"What about Moody and this guy Mike? They'll probably show up again.\" Albert shrugged. \"So let them, it's a free country.\" Ricky rolled his eyes. \"You know what I mean. It's not really me I'm worried about…it's Clifford. He's kind of a runt and I don't want them beating on him.\" Albert put a hand on Ricky's shoulder and stood him to his full height. \"Damn, you're almost taller than me now and still growing. Ricky, just get your butt over there and get your bike, and if you have to, help your friend! Isn't that what he paid you for, Bodyguard? Don't schlep out of responsibilities.\" Ricky laughed a little. \"I'm not. I didn't even take money the first time. It just felt good to be feared.\" Ricky held up his hands with widened eyes. \" I know… I know …it's more important to be respected.\" Albert pushed Ricky to the door and put the coat over his arm. \"Then go and earn that respect! And remember how I always taught you.\" Ricky nodded firmly. \"That's right. Go for the nose!\" He turned to leave and then stopped short. He opened his arms wide and gave his uncle a quick hug. \"I'm sorry about all this uncle Albert. I don't want to be an outcast anymore. I know at some point I'm gonna have to take the blame for what I did to him.\" He broke off into sobs and Albert hugged him again gently. \"Hey…hey…you're gonna be okay, Ricky. You've already acknowledged the blame, and that's as good a start as any. I'll take care of ya. Just promise me that you won't give up, huh? I can't lose you.\" Ricky pulled back and raised himself erect. \"You won't!\" Albert smiled and turned toward his desk. \"How about that Lasagna on Saturday?\" Ricky gave him a sheepish smile. \"Will Aunt Ronnie make her garlic bread too?\" \"Of course!\" \"Then I'll be there…and I want to show you my bike too.\" \"That'll be great, Ricky. I'll be waiting for you…and so will Ken and Barbie.\" Ricky laughed and left the office with his confidence restored. He was going to head straight to the park to apologize to Clifford and if he had to, stand up against the bullies for what was right. Albert picked Ricky's file up off his desk and opened it. Three blank sheets of paper drifted out. He tore it in half and threw it in the trash with a cynical smile. He'd lied to Ricky. There were no technicalities in Chris's death, at least not anything noticeable by the police. Whatever had happened, Ricky covered his tracks well. He'd make a good criminal…or a cop. There were never any suspicions of murder, it was written off as an accidental suicide. It was only Albert who long suspected Ricky played a part, but he never knew how to break it to him. All that mattered at this stage in the game was that Ricky had confessed, not once, but twice. Albert didn't have to enforce the law on him. Ricky had put himself in his own prison, and now he was finally free. The End. ","Summary":" I found him that way \"I wondered if you'd show up, Ricky. I'm glad you did. I know it's kinda earl"},{"Movie":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","Title":"ET IV: Nocturnal Fears","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12876670","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It is a warm summer night in the suburbs of Northern California. All seemed to be calm and at peace, at least at first glance. In the air something seemed to be amiss with the world order. The stars in the night sky twinkled blankly and expressionless as if to signify that something out of the ordinary was about to occur. A slight breeze caused a sudden disturbance among the treetops, or at least that was what it seemed it was. Through the gnarled branches of the tall redwood trees something blindingly bright penetrated the night sky in the blinking of an eye. A small noise, followed by streaks of stray light, further acknowledged its presence. Down upon the forest floor, in the clearing a giant ornamentally designed Mothership had come to rest in it. A door was opened and extended outward to make a ramp. Light poured from within the ship and a small figure emerged from it moving in a peculiar waddling fashion. Two huge glowing red eyes scanned the area as the little figure stepped down from the gangplank and into the forest clearing. After a few moments he turned back towards the spaceship and flashed a bright dark yellow glow from the center of his chest. In response to it, several other small figures that looked exactly like him began clambering down the ship's ramp. He spoke to them then in a strange, eerie sounding alien tongue. \"The coast is all well and clear here. No sign of human beings about. Though should we encounter any of them... we'll know what to do with them, won't we?\" His fellow creatures snarled in an agreeing reply as they bared their long razor sharp teeth and held up their equally long and sharp glowing fingernails. The leader chuckled malevolently. Then he said, \"Now I command you all to disperse into the forest and search for the target of our mission here, should any creature, big or small, get in your way, just bring it here as well.\" So then the squat aliens waddled away into the dark forest. As they did so each one of them began emitting a hypnotic humming noise which carried through the air throughout the area. In the distance ahead of them, a rabbit that was running toward its burrow stopped short and stood stiff as if paralyzed. At the same time this happened to a raccoon mother who was scurrying back to her babies, and to a squirrel who was gathering nuts beneath one of the trees, and an owl who was hooting contentedly stopped and stared wide-eyed and frozen stiff. A few hours went by and then as the very first light rays of dawn began to streak across the sky the leader of the troupe of aliens went up to the top of the gangplank, and raising his long frail arms outward as the yellow light in his chest glowed vibrantly he summoned his troops back to the Mothership. For a moment in time, all them were paralyzed themselves by the fierce radiation of their captain's summoning. Then they slowly looked up with their large, expressive red eyes and began their orderly procession back up into the spaceship. Once they were all on board the ship again the captain looked at them with a blending of disappointment and displeasure. \"Well, I can see you haven't found our target in question,\" he grumbled. \"No, but we did bring some food though, Captain,\" said one of them. \"And, I hope you don't mind, I had a small snack when I was out.\" His long sharp teeth and nails were dripping with what seemed to be freshly spilled blood. In their arms the alien troops were holding various animals that made no struggle to escape from them at all, they only stared blankly with their bodies frozen stiff. There was a raccoon, a squirrel, a rabbit, an owl, and a few small birds. \"Ah, I see. Very good,\" said the captain, nodding approvingly. \"We'll have our meals now and then tonight at the first rays of twilight we'll begin our search anew.\" \"Captain, I do not mean to be impertinent,\" said one of the troops, \"but are you certain the Brodo Asogian in question is still here on Earth? I mean, according to the space-and-time frame it has been about five Earth years since we received the transmit signal from him. For all we know he's either dead or has returned home to his planet.\" \"Of course, I'm sure!\" snapped the captain. \"I know these Brodo Asogians well, and they have a way of surviving in the most inhospitable conditions. If he's here we'll find him for certain, and when we do we will have him and his home planet right where we want them.\" \"They will have no choice but to surrender to us, because they will do anything to prevent the mutilation of one of their own!\" concluded one of the troops with a very malignant grin.[Chapter 2] Elliot was running, sprinting down the track at top speed. He was panting, his lungs were burning, his heart was racing, his adrenaline was high. \"Go, Elliot! Go!\" cheered his mother Mary from the crowd of onlookers. \"You can do it, little bro!\" shouted his older brother Michael. \"I believe in you!\" exclaimed his little sister Gertie. Elliot briefly flashed them all a smile as he continued running down the track with his energy renewed with his family's encouragement. He ducked his head slightly and sprinted to the head of his track team, so now he was in the lead. The crowd went ecstatic with roars of cheering as Elliot's team came back in the lead as they ran around the bend in the track. Then as they reached the end of it Elliot suddenly found he had even more strength than he had to begin with and made a short dash toward the end of the line and came in ahead of everyone else, thus securing his team's place in the lead for the third year in a row. The crowd all stood up and applauded and cheered and screamed with joy at the victory. Then as Elliot came staggering slightly and panting roughly up to the resting bench his family ran up to him and he was embraced by Mary while Gertie panted him on the back and Micheal ruffled his hair. \"Congratulations, Elliot! I knew you could do it!\" exclaimed Mary bursting with pride. \"You're quite an athlete, bro,\" said Michael equally proud. \"It must run in the family.\" \"You were just like the road runner,\" said Gertie. Elliot just grinned as he modestly took in their praise. Just then Keys, who was now officially Elliot's stepfather having been now been married to his mother for three months, came up to them with a big broad smile on his face. Mary released Elliot from her embrace as Keys came up and wrapped his arm around Elliot's shoulder's in a very fatherly way. \"You're a straight A student, and a third-year track champion,\" he said affectionately. \"I must say I couldn't be prouder than if you truly are my own son. Now what do you say we go get some ice cream to celebrate, huh?\" They all agreed to this and went to the local ice cream parlor where they each got themselves the biggest ice cream sundaes they could eat. It seemed like the life of Elliot and his family had improved tremendously ever since Dr. Keys had entered into it. But then, of course Keys wouldn't have ever come into their lives if E.T. had come in first. E.T. was a small extra-terrestrial being who had been left behind on Earth near their home and Elliot had taken him in and had helped him to build a transmitter to contact his home planet to come and get him. Then when E.T. had become deathly sick Keys had come and tried in vain to save him, and then E.T. was revived by the love Elliot felt for him and by the combined healing energy of his companions heart lights. Then E.T. had returned to his home in his spaceship. He soon came back to Earth though that year and had celebrated Christmas with them. Then he had come back again three years later when Elliot was experiencing tough times at school and he couldn't find the strength of the will to make the team, and now thanks to E.T.'s encouragement he was a champion and was admired and respected by basically everyone around him. Mary had dated Keys for almost four years, just after Elliot's biological father had returned from New Mexico and filed for divorce and then moved back to New Mexico. When his parents had first separated it had been very hard for Elliot, and now he had the best stepfather that could ever be imagined for him. They were all a closely connected family, and all because they had all showed a little bit of kindness to a small being who was from another world. Later that evening, to celebrate Elliot's victory further, they all ate out at his favorite restaurant that had the most gourmet food in town. \"So, now that the school year is almost over with, what do you want to do during the Summer holidays?\" asked Keys over dinner. \"I think I'll just work on my football skills, and towards getting accepted into NYU,\" said Michael. \"I think I'll try out for the summer swim team,\" said Gertie. \"I think I'd like to go to that Science and Astronomy camp we read about,\" said Elliot. Keys smiled lovingly at Elliot. \"You really want to do everything you can to make me proud of you, don't you?\" \"Yeah,\" said Elliot, \"and also E.T.. \"After all if it hadn't been for him I don't know where I'd be today.\" Keys smiled understandingly. \"I know how you feel. E.T. shaped my whole life ever since I first met him too. Before I met him I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and then he came and I channeled my life toward the most positive and rewarding ambitions in which I chose to pursue science and medicine. Then just when my life seemed to going downhill E.T. came into it once again, and then all of you came in.\" \"I often wonder about E.T.,\" said Elliot wistfully. \"I wonder how he's doing at his home. If he thinks about me and all of you. I also wonder when I'll see him again.\" Keys nodded. \"I know, and I do too, Elliot. Wherever E.T. is now I am sure he holds a special place for you in his heart and you'll see him again when the time is right. The best things in life are usually the ones worth waiting for the most, that's what I've learned from him.\" \"I learned a lot from him, too,\" said Michael. \"I learned that extra-terrestrial beings are actually really nice and friendly and not mean and hostile like in the most popular of science fiction stories I used to enjoy.\" Keys nodded. \"And that is something which the whole world should learn.\"[Chapter 3] Elliot arrived home after having been out on a date with his girlfriend Erin. He pulled the car into the garage and then went into the house. Inside he found Mary and Keys sitting together on the couch and watching the evening news. He paid little attention to what the news caster was saying as he climbed the stairs up to his room. \"There have been numerous reports of unexplained cattle mutilations in the surrounding countryside.\" Once he was in his room, Elliot went to the billboard on his wall and touched two Polaroid photographs that were pinned to it. They were each taken five years ago. The first one was of him and Michael on Halloween night in their costumes and in between them was E.T. hidden beneath a white sheet, only a small glint of his eyes could be seen through two holes cut in the sheet. The next picture was of him and Michael and Gertie and E.T. sitting underneath the Christmas tree surrounded by presents that same year. E.T. was seen fully in this one with his heart light glowing a ruby red. He smiled wistfully as he rubbed his fingertips lightly against the pictures and reminisced about his otherwordly best friend. He knew of course that it always takes a little time to find a best friend that you really trust and love, but he believed that no one else could ever find a better best friend than that which he had in E.T.. If only I could see him again, he thought. Even if just for a moment. Just then he heard what sounded like a faint humming noise coming from above him. He looked and saw that the clay balls E.T. had made to represent the planets of the solar system that were hanging suspended by wires on the ceiling were slowly spinning around as they had done when E.T. had first made them. He looked at them wonderingly for a moment and then his heart leaped up into his throat as the realization of what this had to mean came to him. Was it true though? He had to make sure. So he went to his window and opening it he looked up as far as he could. He saw the transmitter E.T. had built out of various household objects on his first visit and noticed the umbrella attached to it for an antenna was moving slightly and then he relaized the humming noise he had heard had been coming from the transmitter itself! So now he was sure of it. He raced out of his room and into the one across from his where he found Michael sitting at his desk and studying for finals. \"Mike! Mike! You've got to come with me now!\" he exclaimed breathlessly. \"Not now, Elliot!\" said Micahel very annoyed. \"Can't you see I'm trying to study here!\" \"But this is very important, Mike!\" Elliot pressed further. \"Aw, come on. What could possibly be more important?\" demanded Michael. \"He... is... coming... back!\" Elliot said slowly and pronouncing each word very carefully. Michael's face lit up with surprise and joy. \"Well, that is more important! Why didn't you say so in the first palce?\" Elliot just grinned. Then he and Michael rushed into the next room where they found Gertie had just put on her nightgown and was about to get into bed. \"Gertie! Come quick! He's here! He's come back!\" they exclaimed ecstatically. Gertie needed no further pressing. She knew instantly what they meant and she slipped on her night slippers and robe and hurried out with them. They dashed out of the house through the back door, went around to the garage and got on their bicycles and rode them speedily to the woods, not pausing a second until they reached the clearing in it where they felt they knew they would find what they expected to find there. And, sure enough, there in the clearing they saw a huge round object with many small glowing lights around it, nestled in between the trees. They dismounted their bicycles and gazed in awe upon the dark contours of the massive space machine. \"You were right, Elliot,\" said Gertie excitedly. \"This is it alright!\" \"Yeah,\" said Michael. Then he looked more closely at the spaceship in the distance. He squinted his eyes at it and frowned slightly. \"Hey, wait a minute. I thought E.T.'s spaceship was blue with yellow lights. This one is black with red lights.\" \"It is?\" Elliot looked squinting at the ship ahead of them also and saw that his brother was quite right. \"It is!\" He then got a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach as he somehow felt that this couldn't be good news. Just then they noticed a shadow of an undefined figure's form lurking around the trees by the spaceship. It was a very familiar looking figure to them. \"But wait!\" whispered Elliot. \"Isn't that E.T. over there?\" He pointed toward s the figure and the others looked and saw the figure did indeed look a lot like E.T. having the same body shape and height. \"It does look like him,\" said Michael uneasily. \"I wonder why... Look! He's coming up here!\" They watched as the small figure approached them with a peculiar waddling motion. As it got closer they were able to make out its features. They saw unto their great astonishment and chargrin that it looked almost exactly like E.T. only its eyes were blood red instead of ocean blue and it had long fangs hanging out of its mouth like a saber-toothed tiger, and it also had extra long fingernails that left long marks in the dirt as they scraped against it. They all got a most unnerving sensation at the sight of him, especially Elliot. When he was within a few feet away from them he stopped and spoke to them in a garbled alien tongue. They all cringed at hearing it and couldn't understand it at all. The alien, realizing this grimaced as he switched to an English dialect. \"Who are you, and what are you doing here?\" he demanded angrily. \"Uh... We didn't mean to bother you,\" said Elliot very nervously. \"We... thought you were someone else... we just saw your spaceship and thought it belonged to someone we knew.\" The alien gave them a very hard stare that told them instantly that he was up to no good at all. He then spoke again. \"You thought I was someone else? Do you mean to tell me that you have been in contact with one of us before?\" \"Uh... Well... someone who resembles you anyway,\" Elliot said falteringly. \"Someone who resembles us...?\" the alien looked deeply troubled for a moment and then his eyes glowed a bright red glare as he said very demandingly, \"Then it seems you must have met with Brodo Asogian who we received contact from on this puny little planet of yours!\" Elliot's eyes were wide in horror as he remembered that Brodo Asogi was the name of the planet which E.T. lived on. \"Tell me,\" continued the alien seethingly, \"where is he?\" When Elliot spoke his voice was like a frightened squeak from a mouse facing a hungry cat. \"He's not here anymore. He went abck to his home planet.\" The alien snarled and let out a loud angry growl as his eyes squinted up into tight slits. \"You're lying!\" he screeched. Then before they could feel the pounding of their hearts against their chests, the alien unleashed a paralyzing yellow glow from within his chest towards them. They all clutched at their heads for a moment feeling as if they would split apart, and then their bodies went stiff and their vision blacked out completely. When they finally regained their senses, they found themselves surrounded by the demonic looking extra-terrestrials on all sides. They were all snarling with their fangs bared and had their long arms with the sharp claws on the ends upraised towards them. Elliot looked at them and tried to be brave as he took a step toward one and said, \"Look, we don't know what you want with us or our friend E.T., but maybe if you would just explain things might be worked out.\" Then all of a sudden the alien closest to him lunged at him with its mouth wide open and its hands outstretched. Elliot fortunately was able to leap backwards just in time to escape from being bitten and perhaps also killed. \"Now you see we mean business,\" said the alien who was their leader. \"Now I will ask you again, and I want the truth this time. Where is the Brodo Asogian?\" \"I told you. He went home a long time ago,\" Elliot said helplessly. The alien leader growled loudly as did all his troops. It was obvious they weren't gonna believe him. \"Take them aboard the ship!\" ordered the leader. \"And maybe then they'll be able to cooperate!\" Then the three of them helplessly went with the aliens as they poked and prodded at them with the tips of their claws towards their spaceship. They didn't want to eaten by these little monsters, but they didn't know just how much worse an alternative could be.[Chapter 4] In the hours that followed, Elliot and his siblings were questioned extensively. But the aliens would not accept the truth in their response. While one of them was was interrogated, another was being examined. \"I want to go home! I want my Mommy!\" Gertie was crying her eyes out as she was strapped down on a white slab with the aliens sticking things into her that caused shocks and other discomforting sensations throughout her body. \"I'm telling you guys the truth, honest I am!\" Michael exclaimed in agitation. \"E.T., the Brodo Asogian, built a transmitter out of things around our house and he contacted his home and his spaceship came and took him back to it! Why are you all being such lugheads!?\" The alien leader looked at him very fiercely and then called to the ones who were examining Gertie. \"That is enough with the female! Do the the tallest one now. I'll see if his brother will be better at responding.\" Elliot gulped as he felt his heart race and his spine chill as the alien leader approached him and began questioning him. \"How did you come into contact with the Brodo Asogian in question?\" he demanded. \"I found him hiding in my Mom's cornfield five years ago. I was as terrified of him as he was of me. Then the next day I left a trail of Reese's Pieces for him and he followed it to my house and I let him stay with me,\" Elliot said plainly. \"Then what did you do to him?\" the alien leader demanded further. \"I... took care of him. I fed him, and clothed him, and bathed him, and I even let him sleep in my room in the closet,\" Elliot replied candidly. \"You say you fed him? What did you feed him?\" demanded the alien leader. \"I fed him anything he would eat. He seemed to only want fruits and vegatables the most,\" said Elliot. \"You mean to say you actually fed him your earth food?\" the alien leader exclaimed incredulously. \"Well, yes, I did,\" admitted Elliot weakly. \"I couldn't give him anything else really.\" \"Well, how did he respond to it?\" demanded the alien leader. \"I... I don't really know,\" admitted Elliot meekly. \"He seemed to like almost anything I gave him. Although...\" He trailed off. \"Go on!\" the alien leader demanded as he pointed his extra long nails at Elliot's face. \"He... got sick... really sick... and I didn't know why... and he died,\" Elliots aid with tears coming into his eyes at the memory. \"You are lying to me again!\" shouted the alien leader in a rage. \"No, I'm not!\" Elliot said insistently. \"He did die! I was there! I saw it! But then... he came back to life again.\" \"Impossible!\" shouted the alien leader. \"But he did! He really truly did!\" Elliot shouted back to him. \"Then you are admitting you have been lying to me and you have him hidden somehere on this planet!\" the alien leader said furiously. \"No, I don't! He's not here anymore!\" Elliot said with his voice ecracking with emotion. \"He went back home, as I told you before! We practically risked our lives in getting him safely back to his spaceship!\" The alien leader once again gave him his intense stare of rage and evil that showed he would show him no mercy for telling the truth. He then addressed his followers once again. \"It is now time to begin the examination upon this one. Make sure you especially intense with him as he no doubt has a personal bond with our enemy.\" Elliot was helpless as he was then tied down onto the table and and strange objects connect with his midsection. Then all at once he felt as if a sharp knife had been stuck up deep into his private areas. The pain was tremendous for him and he broke down completely as he began screaming, screaming for the only thing he could think of at this moment. \"E.T.! E.T.! Help me!\" Elliot then blacked out but the echoes of his cries could be heard from far away as they seem to reach up into the cosmos. In the meantime as all this was going on, at the house Keys and Mary turned off the TV set. Mary looked at Keys with a concerned expression. \"They're awfully queit upstairs,\" she said. \"I hope nothing is wrong.\" \"Let's go up and see,\" said Keys. They went upsatirs and they checked in all three of the bedrooms only to find them bare. Now they were both extremely worried. \"Where could they possibly be at this hour?\" said Mary frantically. \"It's past eleven. Do you think we should call the police?\" Keys was about to reply but just then they heard a strange humming noise coming from somewhere. \"Do you hear that?\" asked Keys. \"It seems to be coming from the roof.\" They then went up to the attic where they climbed out of a window and on top of the roof. There they saw a bizarre sight. The transmitter was vibrating crazily and rotating to a new position The keyboard read-out was repeating the same entry: \"E.T. HELP ELLIOT SOON\". After they read the message they looked at each other and then Mary let out a feeble yelp as she began to cry realizing what this must mena. Keys wrapped his comforting arm around her and led her gently back into the attic through the window. \"They're in some kind of trouble, I just know it!\" she sobbed. \"E.T. is on his way. So I believe all will be well,\" Keys assured her soothingly. After they were in the house again they left it and went to their car and headed for the forest clearing. Inside the aliens spaceship Elliot was now mentally and physically drained. Because he was no longer of any use to them, they carried his limp body to a light cage where Michael and Gertie were already resting. \"Well, now what are we going to do with these pathetic life forms?\" asked the leader. \"Well, I'd suggest putting them out of their misery,\" said the one beside him. Then suddenly they heard a strange resonating hum throughout the ship, yet it was not coming from within the ship. All the aliens on board froze stiff. \"What is that awful noise?\" exclaimed the leader. \"I have a terrible feeling of what it could be!\" exclaimed the other one. Just then a hatch opened up in the forefront of the ship and a pulsating red light filled the room. Elliot was the first to awaken and he saw E.T. standing in the hatchway with his glowing finger raised and his heart light pulsating a powerful radiation of loving energy toward them and the other aliens on board, though instead of filling them with warmth and comfort as it did them, it just seemed to have the same effect on these aliens that their yellow heart light had on the humans. \"You will not harm them, for they are my friends!\" E.T. exclaimed. E.T. advanced toward the human captives and deactivated the light cages with his glowing fingertip. As soon as he was free Elliot embraced E.T. with tears in his eyes. \"Now you must hurry and leave this ship,\" E.T. said quickly. \"But what about you? Will you be alright?\" asked Elliot worriedly. \"Yes, I will. Trust me. I know what to do,\" E.T. assured him. \"Now go.\" So then Elliot, Michael and Gertie hurried out of the awful Mothership. Shortly afterward, E.T. came out and once he was safely with them they all watched as the Mothership of the evil aliens acsended into the sky and soon disappeared from view. \"What did you do?\" asked Elliot curiously. \"I reprogammed their navigation controls,\" E.T. explained humbly. \"So now they headed to a remote corner of the Universe where they will never harm anything again.\" \"Well, what I don't understand yet is why were they looking for you?\" Elliot asked E.T.. \"I mean, what did they want with you?\" E.T. sighed as he lowered his neck. \"They were a distant cousin of my species,\" he explained somberly. \"They evolved on the same planet as I did, though they somehwo evolved to a different and worse genus, and so we had to banish them to another far away galaxy. Though they always held a grudge against us for doing so and always threatened they would take back the Green Palnet for their own. I suppose when I sent out my first signals to my home they intercepted them and came here. I am sorry for them to have caused you so much suffering on my account.\" Elliot just hugged E.T. tightly in his arms, and then Michael and Gertie joined in it. It was just then that Mary and Keys arrived on the scene. They rsuhed out of the car and hurried over to them and embraced them all. \"Are you all alright?\" asked Mary endlessly. \"We saw E.T.'s message on the transmitter and we feared something was wrong.\" \"Well, something was wrong, Mom,\" said Elliot. \"But everything is better than ever now that my best friend is here again.\" \"I am afraid I cannot stay, though,\" said E.T. with regret. \"Oh,\" said Elliot softly. \"Well, will we see each other again?\" \"Of course,\" E.T. assured him. \"For I see it in the stars.\" ","Summary":" It is a warm summer night in the suburbs of Northern California. All seemed to be calm and at peace"},{"Movie":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","Title":"E T III: The Incredible African Adventure","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10315585","Passage":"[Chapter 1] It was a warm June evening in California. The full moon was glowing large in a clear sky over a quaint suburban house. Inside of this house there was a middle-aged woman sitting by her bed writing a letter to her twenty-two year old son Michael who was now in college. In the next room her fifteen-year-old daughter Gertie was on the phone talking to a boy from her school who she was interested in. \"Well, alright. I'll think about it. Thanks for calling. Bye,\" said Gertie before putting the phone back onto the receiver. Gertie went into Mary's bedroom just as she had finished her letter to Michael. \"Mom, I need some advice,\" she said. \"On what?\" asked Mary. \"Boys,\" said Gertie simply. Mary smiled with an understanding nod and urged her to continue. \"Go on.\" \"Well, Mark just called me, and he said he would be honored if I would go to this concert with him this Saturday, and afterward he said we could have dinner at a Chinese or Italian restaurant, whichever one I wanted. Was it my imagination, or was he asking me out on a date?\" \"I think so,\" said Mary. \"That was how your father first asked me on a date.\" \"I've never been on a date with anyone before,\" said Gertie uneasily. \"Is that what you're worried about?\" asked Mary. \"Well, yes... kind of,\" said Gertie. \"Also, I like Mark well enough. But he isn't the only one I'm interested in. There's Craig, who's on the basketball team. I'm wondering if I should wait and see if he will ask me out.\" Mary thought for a moment and then said, \"Well, the shortest way I can give you my advice is to just let your catch come to you instead of spending your life fishing around for what you want. After all, I took my chances with your father and had you and then I took a chance again with Keys and both seem to have been the best catches for me.\" \"So, you mean that even if it doesn't work out with Mark I can always go fishing again?\"asked Gertie. \"Exactly,\" said Mary. \"And it would be wise for you to start now while you're so young so you'll have plenty of time to decide who your soul mate is.\" \"Thanks Mom. You're the best,\" said Gertie. Then she went to call back Mark. In the room off to the next one, Mary's eighteen-year-old son Elliot was sitting with his stepfather who everyone called Keys at their new computer and looking up the various choices of colleges for Elliot as he was just about to graduate from senior high school. \"How about this one,\" said Keys. \"It looks like you'd be able to get a real science degree at it.\" \"I also want to study astronomy,\" said Elliot. \"And maybe just take a minor in botany.\" \"You want E.T. to be proud, don't you?\" said Keys with a warm understanding smile. \"Yeah, I do,\" said Elliot. \"If it wasn't for him I wouldn't have ever met you and might not even be able to go to college now. I just want to spread all the lessons I learned from E.T. to the world.\" Keys nodded. \"Tell you what,\" he said. \"You choose your own college to go to, and you do your best while there, and then you and I will both build a foundation for E.T. and everything he brought to us. You'll be my partner as we try to discover more of extra-terrestrial life and learn how to bridge the gap between our worlds apart.\" \"It's a deal,\" Elliot said with a delighted grin. Then after they had decided on the right college to fit Elliot's aspirations they went to their bedrooms to rest for the night. It was a few hours later, around midnight, when Elliot was awakened suddenly by a slight tremor in his bed. He sat up and rubbing his eyes he saw the half dried up flowers on his windowsill burst into full bloom. Then he looked up and saw the cardboard planets hanging on strings from the ceiling begin spinning around faster and faster. He's come back! He thought as his heart leaped up to his throat. He leaped out of his bed and hurried over to the window. He saw a nearly blinding set of flashing light beams hovering down into the backyard. As the lights began to soften he could make out a big round blue object coming to a landing on the grass. Now he was sure of it and he quickly grabbed his night robe and hurried down the stairs. Once in the living room where he found Keys already hurrying towards the kitchen having felt the commotion going on outside also. Together they rushed to the back door in the kitchen and opening it they saw before them none other than E.T. himself. E.T.'s heart light began glowing in warm recognition of his two closest Earthling friends. \"E.T.! Welcome back!\" exclaimed Elliot ecstatically. \"I'm so glad to see you again!\" He embraced E.T. \"I'm also glad to see you again sooner rather than later,\" added Keys with a smile. E.T. smiled sweetly as he returned Elliot's embrace and laid his head against his neck and shoulder. \"E.T. is glad to see you again, too.\" Then as he gently released him and Elliot from their embrace he looked at them with a most serious expression. \"I have come to you because I need your help most urgently.\" \"You do?\" said Elliot. \"What is your problem?\" \"It is not about me really,\" said E.T. gravely. \"It is about my home, my planet, the Green Planet. It has somehow contracted a virus that is starting to effect many of my race there.\" \"You mean to say there is an epidemic going on at your home planet?\" asked Keys with concern. E.T. nodded. \"Exactly. My fellows have sent me here to Earth to get the only known cure for it.\" \"And do you know what it is?\" asked Elliot. \"Botanicus, he is our chief elder, says it is a special kind of plant that grows only on Earth. It is called Agapanthus. Do you know of it?\" \"We may be able to find out more about it if we look it up in my encyclopedia on plants,\" said Keys. \"Then let us do so,\" said E.T.. Then they went inside where Keys found the encyclopedia in question in one of the bookshelves in his study. He opened it and looked through it for a short while before he landed on the name of the plant E.T. had mentioned. \"Here it is,\" he said. \"It says here Aganpanthus is a special plant that grows a special blue or white flower that is found only in South Africa. People in South Africa known as the Xhosa consider it to be a magical and medicinal plant. They use it to treat heart disease, chest pains, tightness, paralysis, coughs and colds, and the plants leaves also help to bring fevers down.\" E.T.'s eyes lit up with hope. \"Those are all of the symptoms of the epidemic among the race of my planet. Now I must go to South Africa and retrieve the Agapanthus. How far is this destination from here?\" Keys then took hold of a large world globe from his desk and found the location of it. \"We are right here,\" he said as he pointed to their exact location in California, \"And South Africa is... over here.\" He turned the globe and traced with his finger the distance to South Africa. Then E.T.'s eyes suddenly became downcast as he said, \"Alas, the distance is too far for my spaceship to go on the weak amount of fuel it has. You see, the ones of my home who tend to the plants that make the fuel for our spaceships have all gotten the epidemic virus and can't tend to those special plants and so these plants are starting to die. I have only enough fuel to get me back home safely, and can't make an extra trip to such a far away place. Perhaps my home is destined to perish.\" Two enormous tears formed in E.T.'s great blue eyes and began to slowly stream down his face. Keys at once took a handkerchief from the pocket of his robe and dried E.T.'s tears before they went down his neck. \"There's no need to cry,\" said Elliot. \"We can take you to South Africa to get the plant ourselves.\" E.T.'s face lit up again. \"You can? Have you the mode of transportation to get there?\" \"Well, not right here, per se,\" said Keys with a chuckle. \"But we can get there on an airplane by going to the airport after purchasing tickets.\" \"What is an airplane?\" asked E.T. curiously. \"It is kind of like your spaceship... except it's long and thin with wings, and it only flies to places here on Earth,\" explained Elliot. \"How long will it take to get to our destination on it?\" asked E.T. \"Probably no longer than six hours,\" replied Keys. \"And I'll call first thing tomorrow morning for tickets to the very next flight to South Africa.\" \"There's still one problem left,\" said Elliot. \"We'll be able to get tickets alright, but what about E.T.? He is after all an alien, and not a certified citizen here.\" \"Well, I'm sure there is some way to bring him along safely,\" said Keys thoughtfully.[Chapter 2] Early the next morning the sun had just completed its rising over the horizon when Keys and Elliot were dropped off at the airport by Mary. They picked up their luggage and entered into the airport where first they went through the terminal of inspection. Then they put their luggage onto the railing and watched as it went past the inspection rays and then disappeared into a tunnel and then dropped out of the other end where it was rolled away in a cart. \"Now you will take good care of our luggage, won't you?\" Keys asked an attendant. \"Of course, you have nothing to worry about,\" replied the attendant. \"On these airlines we handle every piece of luggage like it was a newborn.\" \"I hope so,\" said Elliot. They then had their tickets checked and marked and went through the passenger's gate and entered the shuttle where at the end they went up the steps of the plane which was set to take off in ten minutes. Just before he stepped aboard Elliot glanced over his shoulder and saw their luggage was being loaded into the back of the plane. Then they took their seats by a window, sitting side by side, fastened their seat belts, and listened as the pilot began his introduction speech and told them what to do in case of an emergency landing. \"Please keep your seat belts fastened at all times, and enjoy your flight. We should be arriving in South Africa in five to six hours,\" he said lastly. Seconds later the roar of the engines were heard as the plane began to move and then lift slowly off of the ground and into the air, soaring into the sky until it was approximately thirty thousand feet in the atmosphere. Keys and Elliot sat in their seats chewing on gum and reading something to help them in their quest in South Africa. Keys was reading a dictionary of English translations of various South African languages. Elliot was reading a tour guide of the many sights, animals, and native tribes in South Africa which would help lead them to the Agapanthus healing plant for E.T.'s home. I sure hope E.T. will be alright, Elliot thought with concern for his friend. Meanwhile, the flight attendant was checking on the luggage in the plane's back compartment. Once he saw that all of it seemed to be safe and secure he turned to leave. Then just before he opened the door to the exit he stopped as he thought for a moment he had just heard a faint sneeze coming from somewhere amongst the luggage. A moment later he decided he must have imagined it and went on his way. Six hours later, the pilot's voice was heard over the intercom again as he said, \"Keep all your seat belts fastened as we are approaching our landing at Cape Town airways in South Africa. The time is one-thirty-four A.M., the temperature is eighty-seven degrees Fahrenheit.\" So Keys and Elliot sat still as the plane lowered itself gradually and then skidded to a halt on the runway of the South African airport. They then unfastened their seat belts and exited the plane as the flight attendant held the door open. They then entered the South African airport where they picked up their luggage and went once again through inspection. Then they got onto a transportation bus waiting outside which took them to the Cape Grace Hotel, which they had reservations for. After they had checked in they went to their room where they began unpacking their luggage. Elliot unfastened a large brown rectangular shaped trunk and when he opened it E.T. stepped out of it and took a long deep breath of the fresh air. \"I hope your accommodations weren't too uncomfortable for you, E.T.,\" said Elliot. \"No,\" said E.T. \"Just very stuffy... and bouncy.\" \"Well,\" said Keys, \"now our main objective is to find the Agapanthus and secure it for E.T.'s planet.\" \"But where will we find it?\" asked Elliot. \"It is used by the Xhosa people so we ought to be able to find it near one of their villages,\" said Keys. \"But where will we find one of them?\" asked Elliot. \"In this guide to all the people and places there are around here,\" said Keys holding up a large booklet with pictures of color. They looked through it and found out where the nearest Xhosa tribe dwelt. They then went and rented a jeep and set off to find them. As Keys drove the jeep and Elliot sat beside him with E.T. in his lap they looked around at the gorgeous scenery. All around them they could see the tallest and greenest and leafiest tress and tall grass beneath them. They could also see high mountains in the distance. They also listened to the many sounds around them, from large crickets to large animals. They could make out the call of a cheetah, the roar of a lion, the growl of a tiger, the trumpet of an elephant, and various different hoots of monkeys. When suddenly they heard a very loud monkey call which could be described as a pant-hoot come from near them up ahead E.T. stood up and leaned over the windshield with his eyes wide and unblinking. \"What's the matter, E.T.?\" asked Elliot with concern. \"Shh... Listen!\" said E.T. in a loud whisper. They listened and heard the monkey call again. \"Oooohhh-ooohhhh-oohh! Ahhhh-ahhhhh-ahhhhh!\" \"It's the call of a chimpanzee, and it sounds like that of a male leader,\" said Keys. \"It is telling us there is trouble up ahead!\" exclaimed E.T. with alarm. \"You mean you can understand the chimps language?\" asked Keys. \"Sure,\" said Elliot. \"E.T. can understand the language of all animals and plants there are. If he says the monkey's cry means trouble we better believe him.\" \"Well, what do we do now?\" asked Keys. \"We go follow the call and find out what is wrong,\" said E.T. decisively. So they all got out of the jeep and followed E.T. as he led them into the dense jungle following the echo of the monkey leader's pant-hoot. After they had gone on for a little while E.T. stopped and started trying to make a call like a chimp, imitating the call they had heard before. Keys looked at Elliot who looked at him in turn and shrugged. Then they both began trying to imitate the monkey call of the chimpanzee leader. Then suddenly, almost out of the blue, they heard an answering cry as a large and bulky black chimp leaped out of the trees and jumped down in front of them. He looked up at them with a serious and solemn expression as he began chittering in the monkey language. E.T. seemed to be listening to him very carefully, and then at the end of the chimp's speech his eyes went wide with alarm and he turned back to Keys and Elliot and translated for them. \"The chimp say there is trouble here in jungle. He say there have arrived poachers here to kill their elephant neighbors.\" \"Poachers!?\" exclaimed Elliot incredulously. \"Here in South Africa!?\" The chimpanzee made a grunting, hooting sound and E.T. said, \"He say he not lie.\" \"Of course,\" said Keys coldly. \"The poachers have come here to maim the big elephants so they can snap off their tusks and sell them off to make ivory out of.\" The chimpanzee began making frantic hooting sounds. \"He ask if we can do anything about it,\" said E.T.. \"Well, we wish we could,\" Keys started to say. \"And we will,\" E.T. finished for him and held up his forefinger which he lit for emphasis. The chimpanzee then clapped its hands and stomped its feet as it chattered and then climbed up into the trees once again. \"He say thank you,\" said E.T.. \"Gee, we'd love to help if we could, E.T.,\" Elliot said dismally. \"But what can we honestly do? We're just two ordinary guys.\" Keys eyes lit up at E.T.. \"But he's not,\" he said with realization. \"Oh! That's right!\" said Elliot. \"But what are you gonna do, E.T.?\" E.T. smiled as he closed his eyes and turned on his heart light and made a low humming sound. \"Oh, I see!\" said Elliot. \"He's gonna speak to the poachers through his heart light so that they can feel the empathy that we feel for the elephants.\" \"Well, then let's hurry and find them!\" exclaimed Keys. They then rushed back to the jeep and drove forward into the jungle. After driving for about a half a mile they began to come to a rather small clearing where they could saw a great herd of big elephants in the distance. One of them raised its trunk above its head and doused itself with sparkling water. \"There's the elephants,\" Elliot whispered. \"They're bathing at the water hole.\" \"And here come the poachers. Look!\" said Keys pointing farther in the distance behind the elephants. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go teach them a lesson,\" said Keys. They all got out of the jeep and went up closer to the elephants and crouched low behind a thicket of underbrush. E.T. closed his eyes and turned on his heart light. The poachers began to take out their rifles. \"How can they be so heartless?\" Elliot said in a low hiss. \"Ivory may cost us a lot of money, but it costs elephants their lives!\" Keys muttered underneath gritted teeth. E.T.'s heart light flickered and faded as he opened his eyes and said in an anxious whisper, \"You must keep your hearts full of peace. I must feel only love around me if I am to succeed.\" E.T. then closed his eyes again and turned his heart light back on. Elliot and Keys at the same time began to think of their love and care for E.T. and for each other. Then Elliot reached down and took hold of E.T.'s right hand and gave it a tight loving squeeze. E.T.'s heart light then blazed brilliantly. The poachers hoisted their rifles, and then just as quickly they lowered them to the ground. They looked at each other with confused and sad expressions on their faces. Then they looked back at the elephants. In their eyes it could plainly be seen that they were feeling in their hearts that what they were about to do was very wrong and inhumane. They then turned and left the sight. Elliot and Keys grinned in victory as E.T. slowly let his blazing heart light fade out. They then went back to the jeep and found the chimpanzee leader again and told him of their success. He congratulated and thanked them fervently in his monkey language which E.T. translated. Then a large female chimp with a tiny baby chimp on her shoulders hopped onto the branch he was on. \"He say they are his wife and son and he is the leader of his band,\" E.T. said as he translated the chimps chittering speech. \"He say he took the position shortly before his son was born after overthrowing the old leader.\" Then E.T. listened intently for a moment longer and then said, \"and they say there be more trouble in the jungle with their other neighbors. They ask if we can help.\" \"Well, we will do our very best,\" Keys promised.[Chapter 3] As they drove along in the jeep the ground beneath them became more and more rough and bumpy and over time the jungle they were in began thinning out and then they were driving along the dusty road through a valley where trees and plants grew less often and at the same time they heard less animal sounds. Then they suddenly could hear a lot of loud growling and hissing coming from somewhere around them. \"What is that noise?\" asked E.T.. \"It sounds like a couple of big cats having a wrestling tournament,\" said Elliot. \"It's coming from over there,\" said Elliot. \"The chimpanzee leader said there was more trouble here, so maybe we should see what we can do about as we promised him we would.\" Keys agreed and drove towards the growling. They stopped by a large thicket of bushes where the sounds were coming from behind. They parked the jeep and got out and went around the bushes. There they found two large female cats, one looked like lioness as it was a light tawny color, and one looked like a tigeress as it was dark orange with black stripes, and both were biting and clawing at each other in a tangled heap on the ground which they were tearing up in their struggle against each other. \"They seem to be trying to kill each other,\" said Keys. \"But why?\" asked E.T.. \"Hey, you two, break it up!\" exclaimed Elliot to the two fighting cats. But they didn't seem to hear him and continued with their battle. Then E.T. closed his eyes and began making a humming sound. Then his heart light gave off a bright glare for a moment. Then, amazingly, the lioness and tigress stopped their fighting and fell to the ground as if they had both been stunned and then slowly they got up on their paws again and stared at them in curiosity and let out low growls. E.T. then appeared to be listening silently to them for a while and then he turned to Keys and Elliot and translated. \"They say they were fighting because they both wanted to hunt in this same territory and they both think it is not big enough for the both of them to hunt in.\" Just then the lioness gave out an angry sounding snarl, and then the tigress looked at her and gave one in return. \"And,\" E.T. continued, \"they each have families to they must hunt for.\" \"Well, that really does present a problem,\" said Elliot. \"It seems you one of you ought to find another place to hunt in.\" The two large cats each let out low murmurs. \"They say they don't know of any other hunting grounds, neither of them,\" said E.T.. \"Well, just because you don't know of any more, doesn't mean there aren't any more,\" said Elliot. \"That's right,\" said Keys. \"And we can find a new hunting ground for you. We have a map with us of the entire area.\" Keys then went to the jeep and found the map of South Africa they had brought with them. He studied it for a while and then said, \"Over the next mountain to the left of here and between two hills there is a fine place of open land where you can hunt for anything you may want.\" They then showed the two great cats the pictures on the map as E.T. pointed everything out with hand gestures. Then the lioness and tigress purred their thanks to them and went their separate ways. \"Well, there's another problem solved,\" said Elliot with satisfaction. They then got back into the jeep and drove off again. They hadn't gone very far when they looked out ahead of them and saw a large crocodile crawling slowly across the road. Keys abruptly stopped the jeep when they came close to it and they all got out and went up to it. \"What are you doing out here all alone?\" Elliot asked the crocodile. \"Shouldn't you be some place safe where there's water?\" E.T. listened silently for a moment and then translated, \"She said she is carrying eggs and is looking for a safe place to lay them where they won't be touched by predators.\" They then noticed the bulge on her underside. Keys said, \"Looks like we'll need the map again. We'll find where there is a safe place for your babies to hatch, Mrs. Crocodile.\" He then found the map again and studied it for a while and then showed it to crocodile and said, \"Right here in this area not far from here, there is a swampy bit of land where you can lay your eggs and your babies will be safely far away from all predators. The expect mother crocodile thanked them and then went on her way. Then they got back into the jeep and continued on their way. After a while, Elliot looked up and said, \"Look! There is a chimp up in that dying tree right there!\" \"What he is doing there so far away from the other chimps?\" E.T. wondered. \"Maybe we can ask him,\" said Elliot. They got out of the jeep and went up to the tree and Elliot called up to the chimpanzee, \"Hey, you up there! Why are so far away from your others!\" The chimp looked startled and then when he saw them he began climbing down the tree and stopped on a low branch a few feet above their heads and made low and melancholy chattering sounds. E.T. translated in a sympathetic voice, \"He said he was once the leader of the chimps of his band until a few years ago when he was overthrown in combat by his rival and since then he has been too ashamed to let another of his kind see his face so he makes his home here from now on.\" Elliot and Keys looked at the chimp and saw that he had various scars in his dark hair, and looking into his eyes they could clearly see his mental scars were far deeper than his physical ones. \"We're very sorry for you,\" said Elliot kindly. \"Can you give us any directions to the nearest village of humans here?\" The chimpanzee made chattering sounds and gestures with his hands which E.T. translated for them. \"He said there is a small village of Xhosa over the next high hill, and he has seen some of them from time to time and they are having problems of their own.\" \"What kind of problems?\" asked Elliot. The chimpanzee hooted and E.T. translated again. \"They have trouble getting along with another tribe called the Zulu because of their differences in beliefs and places of living.\" \"Well, we'll see if there is anything we can do about it, and then hopefully they can help us as we're looking for a plant they use for healing sicknesses called Agapanthus.\" Then they got back into the jeep and drove off towards a steep hill in the far distance where the Xhosa village lay. Elliot thought about the animals they had met, especially the chimpanzees. \"You know, the link between us and the animal kingdom is really much closer than I ever knew before,\" said Elliot.[Chapter 4] As they drove down the steep bumpy hill they could they the African village below. It was a clear and grassy piece of land dotted with houses that were small one-story huts made of wood and some were paint pale colors. As they drove closer they could see farmlands spread out among the houses with various animals of cattle roaming about. \"This looks like a nice, peaceful village,\" said Elliot. \"I don't see how anything could be wrong here.\" \"Let's ask the first person we see about it,\" said Keys. They then parked the jeep at the bottom of the hill and entered into the village. They had only gone a short distance when they found a small boy of about eight years old. His skin was a very dark mahogany brown, almost totally black, and he was wearing only two thick leather flaps on in front of and behind of him. He had a bright red macaw with green tipped wings on his left shoulder. He seemed to be pulling some things out of the earth in front of his house. They walked up to him and Keys spoke to him in the Xhosa language he had learned on the way here. \"Hello, we are visitors here from America. I am Keys and this is my stepson Elliot, and our friend E.T.. What is your name?\" The boy looked up at them and spoke, \"My name is Thabo, and this is Siindiwe,\" he nodded at the macaw on his shoulder. \"We're just harvesting our crops for this year.\" \"I see,\" said Key. \"That's good. We heard you're having some trouble around here. Is it true?\" \"Well...\" said Thabo hesitantly. \"All I know is a girl in the Zulu village who I like to play with, except hers and my parents won't let us.\" \"But why not?\" asked Keys. \"They say it is because they think our land belongs to them and they are trying to get the government to give it back to them.\" \"But why do they want your land all to themselves?\" asked Keys. \"I've heard they say it is because they used to live here until a war of a hundred years ago split them apart. They also have beliefs that are different from ours. I'm told we are watched over by the spirits of our ancestors and that they have a different set of beliefs about a god that lives in this Zion Christian Church as I heard it was called.\" \"Well, what is your opinion on these things?\" asked Keys. \"I really don't have one,\" admitted the eight year old boy plainly. \"I have no idea which set of beliefs is correct, just that they can't both be right.\" E.T. shook his head regretfully as he murmured, \"These humans all think they're so special, just because theirs is the only planet in their solar system that supports life.\" \"You see, our friend E.T. here is from another planet from ours that is far out in space, millions of light years away,\" explained Elliot, feeling a bit awkward at admitting this to such a stranger. \"You mean... he is... from beyond the sky?\" asked Thabo with his eyes wide and round. \"Well, yeah. Sort of,\" said Elliot. \"Oh! I've always wanted to meet one of you!\" Thabo exclaimed as he dropped down onto his knees and bowed in front of E.T.. \"I'm sure everyone here would want to meet you also. Why don't you come with me now and meet my friend Mhlobo, the Shaman!\" \"Sure, we'd love to,\" said Keys. Then Thabo led them to a very small hut in a far corner of the village outside of which they found a little old man with paling dark and wrinkled skin and long bony hands and feet sitting in front of what looked like a large old-fashioned rusty kettle with smoke billowing out from it. As they approached he looked up but did not seem to directly at them. \"He is blind,\" Thabo explained. \"He says he sees only with his heart because of it.\" They stepped up to the elderly Shaman and Thabo spoke to him. \"Greetings, Mhlobo. I bring you visitors from America. Keys, Elliot, and E.T.. E.T. is a man from beyond the sky! I was wondering if perhaps you could tell me why he came to us.\" The old Shaman smiled thinly and closed his unseeing eyes as he nodded slowly. \"Yes, of course I will,\" he said in a voice that sounded a lot like E.T.'s with a South African accent. He then reached into a pouch that was sitting in his lap and poured what looked like colored dirt into the smoking kettle in front of him. Then the smoke in the kettle became much thicker and turned pink with a strong scent to it. Mhlobo then began waving his hands over it as he peered into it with his eyes still closed. He began speaking in a slow, chanting voice, \"I see he has come to prevent a great catastrophe where he lives. But that the true reason for his being here is to save us ourselves from our destruction which we are at our own hands of.\" Then the smoke in the kettle faded from pink to white again and then began evaporating. \"Thank you, Mhlobo,\" said Thabo bowing to the Shaman. \"Excuse me, but what did he mean by we are the ones to prevent your destruction?\" asked Keys. \"He means, like I said, that everyone here would like to meet your friend E.T. because he is from the sky, and as he is a greater being to us they will have to listen to him if he tells them to stop fighting over each other's land and beliefs.\" \"What a good idea! Why didn't I think of it?\" said Elliot. So then, Thabo, and Keys and Elliot went around the village and told the people in to come together in one place where E.T. who they referred to as 'the great being from beyond the sky' was, and they in turn told their neighbors the same, and so on, and so on, until they were all gathered together in the one spot where E.T. was. E.T. stood before the throngs of South African people and addressed them in a deeply serious voice. \"I am the greater being from the sky you may have heard of.\" \"He is a god!\" exclaimed someone in the crowd. \"No! He is a spirit sent from our ancestors!\" A squabble began to break out among them, and then E.T. silenced them by flashing his heart light to regain their full attention on him. \"I am neither a god, nor a spirit,\" he said plaintively. \"I am but a being who comes from a different world from yours as there are many other worlds beyond the sky that you know of. My people and I want only to be friends with yours, no matter what they are like. And I was sent here to deliver to you this message of peace which I wish for you to share among yourselves and your neighbors known as the Zulu. This land is neither yours nor theirs, it is only that of the Earth's and can belong to no one other than itself.\" The people listened and took in this speech in an awed silence, then they were silent for a few moments more, until one man stepped forward and said, \"We promise we will abide by your wish, oh wise one from beyond the sky.\" Then the other people nodded and softly murmured their agreement. Then they all turned around and headed back to their homes. Afterward, Thabo ran up to E.T. and gave him a big hug. \"How can I ever thank you enough?\" he said ecstatically. \"Well, Mhlobo did mention E.T. had come here for something to save his people also,\" Keys reminded him. \"And what is that?\" asked Thabo. \"It's a plant that you use for healing remedies called Agapanthus,\" said Keys. \"He needs it to cure his people of a virus that is spreading across his planet in an epidemic. Do you know where we can find such a plant?\" \"Certainly,\" said Thabo brightly. \"The medicine man has it in plenty. Come with me.\" He then led them to another small hut that wasn't far from where they were and inside they found a little old man wearing many pieces of native South African jewelery and garments in a native laboratory. He seemed to recognize Thabo when they entered. \"Ah, Thabo. What can I do for you today, my young friend?\" \"It's not for me. It's for my friends here,\" Thabo said. \"They need one of your Agapanthus'.\" \"No problem,\" said the tribal doctor warmly. \"I have them right here.\" He then took out a large wicker basket from underneath his desk and inside it was filled with long-stemmed plants with tiny white and blue flowers on them that looked exactly like the picture in the encyclopedia. E.T. eagerly selected a handful of them. \"My home will now be saved!\" he said with immense relief. He turned to Keys and Elliot and said, \"You are true friends.\" Afterward, they stayed the night with Thabo and his family and had a dinner of what they called \"umngqusho\" which was made from dried, stamped corn and beans, milk, beef, and mutton. ","Summary":" It was a warm June evening in California. The full moon was glowing large in a clear sky over a qua"},{"Movie":"My Bodyguard","Title":"His Secret Pain","Author":"Moongirl123","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10257446","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Ok we all know Moody is a jerk but there is goodness in everyone so I'm giving Moody a chance for a happy ending. So here is what happened after he got his nose broken. POV Lacey Lockheart I stood there, behind a tree, and watched as Melvin Moody and Clifford Peache went down in a fight. a few punches were thrown, there was some trash talk; then Clifford decked Moody in his face and he want down groaning in pain. \"You broke my nose!\" I heard Moody yell, his face covered with blood. He went over to his friends and they started teasing him, some just walked away. It wasn't long before he was alone. I couldn't help but think 'Why doesn't someone help him?' I knew Moody treated people very badly and didn't really deserve to be helped, but I was cursed with a good heart 'Well I guess it's a good thing I always carry a first-aid kit' I grabbed my backpack, came out from behind a tree and went over to him. I slowly approached him, to be honest I was a little scared of Moody and I was also painfully shy. \"Um...hi\" I said softly, Moody looked at me for a moment. I set my bag down and took out the first aid-kit \"Uh... here let me help you.\" I gently pushed on his forehead and made him tilt his head back \"Keep your head back, you still have a nose bleed.\" I took out some tissues and some water and started to wipe the blood off his face. I have to admit it...I thought Moody was seriously cute, and he looks better with his hair all messed up like that instead of how it usually looked; all combed back like a mobster. when I finished cleaning the blood I started to tap his nose gently to see how badly it was hurt. Moody scrunched his face up in discomfort and let out a soft \"ow\" I pulled away quickly \"Sorry, sorry, sorry. Well your nose is defiantly broken but the good news is you're not going to need a splint just some bandages.\" I sais as I took some gaws and tape out of my first-aid kit and patched his nose up. When I finished I put my stuff back in my bag \"Feel better?\" \"Yeah thanks\" Moody said locking his brown eyes with my black ones. Man I love brown eyes. I could feel my cheeks flush. Then my shyness resurfaced. \"You're welcome\" I managed to squeak out, I got up and started to walk away when I felt a warm hand gently wrap around my wrist. I turned around to see that Moody had grabbed onto me. \"Hold on a minute you think you can just walk away after helping me, well you better think again missy.\" he pulled me back down next to him, I started to get a little bit scared. I wanted to tell Moody that I didn't want to stay but I knew Moody was a guy who won't take 'no' for an answer. He gave me a smile to calm me down \"I'm just trying to be friends, don't you wanna be friends?\" Moody asked me. \"Ok, I guess\" I replied \"So..uh what's your name anyway?\" Um...I'm Lacey\" I said very softly \"I like that name.\" Moody replied with a smile 'He heard me?' I thought to myself, I really was surprised usually when I talk to people they never hear me. I gave him a little smile \"I really can't believe your friends just left you like that.\" \"Yeah some friends they are but things should be ok by tomorrow. They acted the same way when the first learned what my first name was.\" Moody told me \"You mean Melvin?\" I asked He gave me a confused look \"Yeah, but I don't go by that no more. I prefer to be called...\" \"Big M\" I said cutting him off Now he was really confused \"Ok how did you know that? You a mind reader or something?\" I let out a small giggle \"No we go to the same school we actually have every class together.\" \"We do?\" Moody asked still looking confused \"It's alright nobody ever notices me.\" It was the truth I was the shyest girl in school, I'm probably as quiet as Ricky Linderman. Sometimes not even teachers' know I'm there, I'm practically invisible. \"Oh, well um I was just gonna go home you wanna come and hang out?\" \"Sure\" I said We got up and started walking. \"So your nose feels better?\" I asked him \"Yeah, a lot. Where did you learn first aid?\" \"I volunteer at the hospital, I'm a candy striper\" \"That's cool\" It was so weird to see this side of Moody, he actually seemed...nice and I don't feel shy around him. I wonder why that is, Soon we came up to a house, it looked old but it was obvious the owner took real good care of it. It wasn't real big or real small, it had a nice yard covered with flowers, an old wishing well, and a big tree with a tree house and an old swing on a big branch with flower covered vines wrapped around the ropes. It reminded me of a larger version of an old dollhouse of mine. \"Oh my gosh this house is so cute\" I said with a smile \"I'm glad you think so 'cause this is where I live\" Moody told me I was surprised to hear him say that \"Seriously?\" \"You seem surprised?\" \"Well it's just from what I've seen and heard at school I wouldn't have guessed you lived in a place like this\" I explained \"You know there's more to me then people think\" Moody said then took my hand in his, my cheeks turned red 'Do I have a crush on him?' Okay chapter one is like 5 notebook pages long, so I'm calling this chapter 1 part 1 Hope you like my story so far :)[Chapter 2] Part 2 \"Come on I want you to meet my grandmother\" Moody's voice broke into my thoughts' \"Your grand mother?\" \"Yeah, I call her Nanny\" I giggled \"that's cute\" He led me inside the house and it looked bigger then it did on the outside, it also felt kind of cozy. There was an elderly woman sitting in a rocking chair and she looked up at us. She was but not real old and I could see the resemblance between her and moody, they have the same hair color and nose. Her hair was long and she had it pinned up, her eyes were grey she also had a few grey hairs. She gasped, stood up and walked toward Moody. \"Oh my goodness what happened? Are you alright sweetheart?\" Moody's grandmother asked him. \"I got in a fight Nanny, I'm ok.\" he said trying to calm her down \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes...\" Moody looked at me \"...I brought a friend home, Nanny this is Lacey.\" She looked at me and smiled \"Oh my word aren't you gorgeous, you my dear are a dead ringer for Snow White.\" II guess she meant because of my black hair and soft white skin, but my hair wasn't completely \"black as ebony\" it had two colored streaks one was purple and the other was magenta. Also my lips weren't \"red as blood\" they were soft pink, my eyes are black and hidden behind a pair of glasses. I was wearing a white blouse with short cap sleeves and a pink satin ribbon in the center of the neckline, a purple skirt that went down to just above my knees, white knee socks and black sneakers. A basic school girl look. I didn't think was the \"fairest of then all\" but I guess my looks aren't so bad \"Thank you ma'am\" I said with a smile. You can call me Annalee dear\" She replied \"Lacey was the one who bandaged my nose, she's a candy striper\" Really!? Helping the sick and injured what a sweet girl\" said Annalee I blushed, like I do whenever I get complemented \"Thank you\" \"Well I'll leave you two alone, just call if you need anything\" Annalee said walking into another room. Moody and I sat down on the couch \"I like your grandmother, she's really nice\" I told Moody \"Yeah she is, I love her\" he said I just looked at him this wasn't the Moody I saw at school, this Moody was nicer, a beloved grandson who lived in a nice house with his grandmother. I don't get it. \"Moody, can I ask you something?\" \"Sure go ahead\" Moody said brushing his hair back to it's former glory \"Why do you act so different at school? And why are you being so nice to me?\" Moody looked at me \"You mean why does the coolest, toughest guy in school who pushes people around, suddenly wants to be your friend?\" I nodded \"Well...\" he started, I noticed pain in his eyes \"let me tell you a story about a boy I knew once, about three years ago his mother gave birth to a little girl. When his mom handed the baby to him the baby opened her eyes and he swore she smiled at him, he loved his new little sister and he was excited to be an older brother. She was so small and fragile like a china doll he wanted to protect her. You know he even got the baby something as a gift for the baby shower, he went to one of those 'make your own stuffed animal' places and made her a stuffed bunny. It was white with blue eyes and a pink stitched moth, he paid extra to have a music box put in it that could be operated by a pull string. One night e fell asleep in his sister's room he woke up to the sound of her crying, when he looked up he saw a strange man holding his sister and was heading out the window, the guy was kidnapping her. He tried to save her, tried to stop him but the guy knocked him down, when he got up he was too late the man and his sister were gone.\" That was some story but I didn't understand why he told it to me \"I don't understand, what does that have to do with you?\" Moody didn't answer, he just turned his head and looked at the mantel. I looked and something caught my eye, a stuffed bunny. I got up, walked over, gently grabbed the toy and held it in my hands. \"It's the bunny from your story,\" I said looking at moody, the I realized \"Oh you poor thing.\" End of Part 2, one more part to go then we will be moving on to chapter 2 Hope you're enjoying the story so far Please review :)[Chapter 3] Part 3 Moody looked at me with those big brown eyes of his and I could tell he was close to tears \"Molly Moody\" he said softly as a tear rolled down his cheek. Next thing I knew I was hugging him trying to comfort him. I felt Moody wrap his arms around me and butterflies filled my stomach, it felt nice to have his arms around me and it was warm in Moody's arms. Maybe I do like him. I fought the urge to snuggle into him. Moody pulled away and wiped his tears \"When my sister was kidnapped I was devastated, I felt so weak, like I failed her it just hurt that I couldn't protect her. I never wanted to feel that way again so I toughed up. My parents blamed me, my Dad beat me and my Mom ignored me. Talked to Nanny and she said she would love to have me come live with her so I did and my parents moved to San Francisco. Then my Mom died of a heart attack and my Dad shot himself.\" \"Oh my gosh!\" \"They did find the guy who took Molly, he was just some crazy guy who thought Molly was his baby, they didn't find Molly though. But I'm not giving up on her I know she's out there somewhere. I started collecting money and saving it for her, you know for doctors and stuff, hoping that someday I'd find her and bring her home.\" \"So that guy I see at school, that isn't the real you?\" I asked, this was a lot to take in and I just had to be sure. \"Yeah, I mean the real me cost me my baby sister if I was the tough guy every one at school sees me as she would still be here\" answered Moody \"I see, so there are two of you and the Moody at school is just trying to avoid the feeling the real Moody felt that night.\" Moody smiled at me again \"You really do understand\" \"Yeah I do, why are telling me all this?\" I couldn't figure out why he was being so open with me \"Well you saw me as the biggest jerk in school and yet hen I broke my nose you still helped me almost as if you were my kindred spirit or something. And I felt like there was something telling me that we were meant to be friends.\" I looked at him for a minute \"You said when you broke your nose, I thought Clifford broke it.\" I joked Moody laughed a little \"He did but I had it coming.\" \"No, you really didn't.\" I looked deep into Moody's eyes and I began to see the real him. A beloved grandson, big brother, an abused child, a real person whose lost and unsure. Then I realized something, I do care for him. We sat and talked for who knows how long, when I checked my watch. I was shocked. \"Oh geez I didn't realize how late it was, I gotta go.\" I said getting up off the coach. \"Alright, hey Lacey you maybe wanna make this a regular thing?\" Moody asked me Man can that boy ever not make me smile \"I guess so, sure.\" \"Cool\" \"And um before I forget, your no0se should be better in a week.\" I told him \"Oh awesome\" he replied \"Also, for the record, I like Melvin a lot better then Big M.\" I said with a smile Moody smiled back \"You would probably be the first, but thanks.\" \"I'll see you later\" And that's the end of chapter one, I wrote up to chapter 4 so you can expect an update on Wednesdays. I hope you guys' are digging the story so far.

Get a load of the gym. It actually smells nice for once!\" Shelly said excitably as she and Clifford entered the double doors. \"Yeah, must be all the flowers and food they're serving over there. Let's go get some punch and stuff. I can't boogie on an empty stomach.\" Clifford had gotten over his apprehensions that Moody and his minions would be skulking around. They were nowhere to be seen. He was hoping they were banned from the dance. \"Men!\" Shelly rolled her eyes. \"Always thinking about food and women.\" Clifford gripped her hand and tugged her along. \"That's right. I got my woman, now I need some grub.\" \"Fresh!\" The school gym was barely recognizable, awash with bright colors, multi-hued lights and streamers. It was like a fifties wonderland. Loud, rock-and-roll music blared from the large stereo system in the corner. The deejay was everyone's favorite science teacher, fondly known as Mr. G. He snacked on mini-sandwiches and bobbed his head up and down as he flipped through his own personal record collection. The atmosphere and mood was lively, and everyone was truly enjoying the dance theme. Outside the school was a different story. Rick hesitated to enter, suddenly feeling very silly. He questioned why he dressed up, but seeing Evie's delighted face when he stepped out of the limo earlier made the sacrifice worth it. She looked radiant herself. Her long poufy hair was relaxed into silky-soft curls and parted on one side with a fancy pink clip. Her face shimmered with delicately placed make-up. She resembled a bronzed-fifties movie goddess. In the limo he earned kudos and a sweet kiss for being so kind to her mother Cheryl. Grandma Peache handed him a bouquet of flowers and instructed him to give it to her. Cheryl was highly impressed by his manners and consideration. \"If ya don't impress mama, the bank will be closed, Ricky. You can bet on that!\" Grandma Peache had warned him. Ricky didn't know what she meant and Clifford had laughed at him. It was her twenties-era way of saying Evie won't kiss or make out with him. Ricky made sure to hand over those flowers with grand gestures and his most affable smile. Shelly looked lovelier than he had ever seen her before. Her tight curls were twisted into an elegant bun with a flower pinned in the back. A few curls cascaded down the sides of her face. Ricky had to slap Clifford on the back to get him to stop drooling and say something other than ' Oh wow' . Currently, all of Ricky's anxieties were building up again. They never let him alone. Every time he embarked on something positive in his life, there they were, trying to drag him down into a pit of despair. Evie paced by the doors expectantly. As the other students streamed in they couldn't help but stare at Ricky in awe. The transformation in him was too amazing. \"Ricky, I know you're nervous, but the more you stand out here like a statue, the more people are gonna make a spectacle of you. Just act nonchalant, they'll stop looking eventually. You gotta admit, it's a huge difference. You look fantastic. I'm jealous even, some of these girls are giving you the once over!\" Ricky went in past the doors, then backed out and rushed down the steps, pacing their length. He rubbed the back of his head; slightly mussing the style Grandma Peach had made him. His nerves were acting up. \"I thought I could do this, Evie. I really did. But I'm not ready. I'm just not. Why don't we go somewhere else?\" \"Dressed like this? Where? We're too young for the night-clubs.\" \"We can lie. I'm big enough to pass for eighteen, and with your make-up you look just about that age. Come on!\" He urged. Evie was getting irritated, but she tried to hold it back because she promised Ricky to understand if his feelings got in the way. She just didn't expect a meltdown so soon. \"Ricky, this is ridiculous. We can't even afford those places. You went through a lot of trouble for me and I really appreciate it. Don't back out now. It's like…making it to the end of the finish line and then refusing to cross. It's totally stupid!\" She blurted out. Ricky glared at her. \"I'm not stupid!\" \"No, but your idea is. I want to go inside already.\" \"Nobody's stopping you.\" Hurt crossed Evie's face and Ricky felt sorry he said that. He was glad she didn't just storm away. \"Look, I'm just, well, it's hard for you to understand, Evie. You didn't go through years of these kids calling you names behind your back, spreading vicious rumors about your life. You don't know what it's like to walk down the halls and have everyone clear a path for you, not because you're so special, but because they're scared to death of you.\" Evie approached him, staying on the top steps to match his height. She placed her hand on his shoulder. \"No, I won't know those things, I never will, but I can try and put myself in your shoes.\" \"Good, then you can understand why I wanna just sit this one out. I'm going home.\" Evie dropped her hand disgruntled. \"So that's it, huh? That's the route you're always gonna take? When things get a little tough you back down? You're not a coward, Ricky; I know you're not. You proved that in the fights.\" \"That was different.\" \"Not really, you could have just let Mike and Moody walk all over you, but you didn't, you fought for what you believed in.\" Ricky shrugged and rolled his eyes. \"I fought for my bike.\" \"You fought to protect your friends and your honor.\" \"Stop turning this into some big test of wills, it's a lousy school dance! There'll be others.\" \"That's not what this is about and you know it! It's not lousy!\" Evie wanted to cry, she felt like she was being dumped already. \"I know what else is bugging you. You don't want to be seen with me because I'm half-black and you're white. Nobody else asked me to the dance, I had to ask you to take me. So they're not only staring at you because of your problems, they think you're weird for being with me too!\" She turned away and sniffled. Ricky gaped at her. He wasn't about to fall for this argument. \"Please, Evie! Don't suddenly turn this into a race issue! It has nothing to do with anything and you know it. I'm not ashamed of you. In fact, I'm worried about what they'll think of you when they see me at your side. 'Oh look, she's a freak who likes to date killers! ' \" \"Shut up, Ricky! All you think about is yourself! I don't care what anybody thinks anymore! You're not a killer! The gun went off by accident and you were scared! That's why you put it in…\" Evie's words stuck in her throat as Ricky stared at her with blazing anger. \"How did you know that?\" He asked, his voice tight with emotion. \"Who told you?\" Evie actually backed away from him as he hovered menacingly over her. She hated herself for thinking that he could ever hurt her, but it was too late. The doubt was in her face as her eyes widened fearfully and her lip trembled. Ricky immediately hung back, he had never raised a hand, but seeing her afraid of him was like a sock to his gut. \"Evie, I'm sorry, you know I would never…\" She kept her distance. \"Leave me alone, Ricky. Go ahead, stay on the outside for the rest of your life, shun everybody. I think that's what you really want! Not me, not best friends like Clifford…\" Ricky clutched her arm. \"Evie, we have to talk about this.\" \"No!\" She shrugged him off. \"You brought it up. Did Clifford tell you this?\" His anger mounted again. \"That little rat! I thought he was my friend.\" Evie swung around and poked him hard in the chest. \"Don't you dare get mad at him! I don't think you realize the things you put him through after you disappeared. He hunted all over Chicago for you! He only wanted to help you. It was killing him to keep the secret inside. I dragged it out of him. He felt terrible for betraying you, but I promised I would never tell. I made the mistake. Weren't you ever going to tell me yourself?\" \"Of course I was! When I was ready. When you were ready. I didn't think you could handle it yet.\" \"I've known it for weeks now and I haven't said a word, we've only gotten closer, haven't we? That should tell you something, Ricky.\" Ricky's eyes filled with tears and he sank onto the step. \"I didn't want you to hate me like everyone else does. I didn't want you to fear me. But now I blew it. I do only think about myself. It's sometimes so hard for me to believe that I actually have friends that care anymore. My family doesn't care either.\" Evie bunched up her skirt and crouched next to him. She wrapped her arms around his neck and shoulders and Ricky gripped her wrist tightly. She kissed his temple. \"I care! I'm sorry, Ricky. You didn't blow it. I still want you tell me. I want to hear everything from you. I'm not mad, or disgusted like these other idiots. I care what happens to you, Ricky. I really do.\" Ricky turned his head partly and she pressed her cheek against his. \"So you can believe me that it was an accident my brother died? I never meant to hurt him.\" He choked on a sob. \"If that's what you're telling me, then I have to believe it. You are not a killer; those bimbos in school don't know what they're talking about. I never listen to any of their crap. How would they know? They weren't there and even the papers said you found your brother like that, the gun was in his hand. So what gives them the right to claim you killed him in cold blood? Nothing! And all those other stories are full of baloney. I've thought about this a lot, and it just makes me madder that they keep treating you like this.\" Ricky's mouth curled up in a small grin. \"Evie, I think you should be a lawyer when you get older. I know I'd want you to defend me.\" Evie chuckled slightly and wiped her eyes carefully. \"My mom says the same thing sometimes. I'm thinking about it.\" She hugged his neck. \"Oh, Ricky. I didn't mean to hurt you.\" Ricky turned toward her and pulled her close. \"I know. You were right, this whole thing is stupid! Very stupid. We can't talk about this anymore here. Let's go inside, I'm getting hungry.\" \"Fine. Men! All they think about is food and women.\" \"The two biggest pleasures in life for us, Evie.\" They rose up together and went before the doors again. \"Are you sure you're good for this?\" \"I'm good enough.\" \"Then let's go find Clifford. I guarantee he's eating right now.\" \"Us men have our priorities.\" Evie tugged on his arm before he entered. \"Wait. Promise me you won't say anything to him tonight? Even if you're mad. I don't want to spoil the fun.\" Ricky sighed. \"I promise. I know Clifford means well. I'm not too mad anymore. I may look like a hard nose, but I'm pretty mellow. \" \"We'll um…we'll all get together and talk about this very carefully. We have to.\" \"Yeah, we do. Otherwise it will just keep getting in the way of everything.\" As they went inside they saw Clifford and Shelly standing outside the gym with Cartman. Shelly lit up and ran over. \"There you are! I was just gonna round up a search party!\" \"Yeah, we thought you two might have found a hot spot, if you know what I mean.\" Clifford ribbed Ricky. \"I wish…but things were pretty heated for a little bit.\" He replied embarrassed. \" Eww! I don't even wanna touch any surface in this school, let alone make-out in here.\" Cartman piped up. \"Girls, I came stag, so I'm free to dance with whomever I want, care to put me on your dance card?\" He asked solemnly. \"Wow, a ladies man!\" Evie grinned. \"Okay, if Ricky doesn't mind, I'll dance with you later.\" Ricky shrugged and smiled. \"Go ahead, make his day.\" \"Cool! That's two down and about one hundred more chicks to go, see ya!\" Everyone laughed and went back into the gym to enjoy the rest of the evening. -Oo- A few minutes later Moody and his friends showed up, once they made it inside, they hurried down a darkened corridor of the hallway. \"Listen guys, I figured out how to set off the sprinkler system.\" \"What are you gonna do? Start a fire? That's kinda dangerous, man. We're talkin' suspension and arrest.\" Koontz said, adjusting his aviator shades. \"No dipstick, all I gotta do is get to the second tier in the gym and heat the piping. It'll work, my dad's a plumber, he knows about this stuff.\" \"If you say so.\" Moody punched the locker annoyed. \"Look, they think they're gonna treat me like an outcast, they got another thing coming. Nobody makes a fool of me and gets away with it. And when everyone's running around I'm gonna grab that stinking peach pit and beat the crap out of him.\" \"Dude, what about his bodyguard? I saw him inside, I almost didn't recognize him, but he's here, man.\" His blonde friend, Dubrow, said. A flicker of fear passed over Moody's dark eyes, but he shook it off. \"Who the hell cares? He's gonna be too busy getting soaked too. You should be glad, Dubrow, Peache got your girl, Shelly.\" \"She ain't my girl.\" \"Yeah, then how come you're always undressing her with your eyes in class? Get off it; I know you're hot for her. Look, Do you think I'm afraid of Linderman? Is that what you all think?\" His three buddies backed away and held up their hands. \" Naww, man, we're just warning you. You know what, Linderman's even got a date with the Oreo chick, Evie. They keep it on the low-down, but I know they're a couple.\" Moody smiled mischievously. \"That gives me ideas. But first things first. Let's move it.\"[Chapter 2] My Bodyguard: Anxieties Chapter 2 The lights dimmed and the music slowed. Mr. G was playing his fifties romance album and started the set off with 'Sea of Love.' The crowded floor suddenly became like a deserted town, with only a brave few– the real couples –staying behind to slow dance. Everyone else scuttled off to his or her respective corners to mingle and eat and drink some more. Clifford and Ricky were at a loss, watching their dates swaying in anticipation a few feet ahead of them. \"What do you think, Clifford? Should we go for it? I think they want us to.\" Ricky noted, sipping the last of his punch. A half-hour earlier someone had given it an added kick and the students eagerly sopped it up before the teachers and chaperons noticed. Clifford pulled at his collar, suddenly very warm. \"Well you and Evie should definitely be out there, ya know. You guys are an official couple.\" Ricky crumpled his cup and tossed it in a pail. \"Hey, now's your chance, Cliff. You all wanted to me to come to this dance and I did, I was brave. It's your turn to be brave, buddy. Shelly digs you, Cliff. What have you got to lose?\" \"I don't know. Maybe I'm not as ready for a girlfriend as I thought. I'm still new here and…\" \"Excuses will get you nowhere my friend.\" Ricky patted his back. \"Go up and ask her, before someone else does. Even Cartman had two dances with her.\" Clifford heaved his shoulders, he went to pat down his hair and Ricky grabbed his arm. \"No way. You touch that thing one more time and it will spring out like a hedge. You look fine. Move it, besides, you owe me big time.\" \"I owe you? What are you talking about? Oh, you mean the fights and stuff?\" Ricky's grin sobered. \"No. I'll talk to you about it another day, just, get out there. Remember, you're not doing it so much for yourself, you're doing it for her.\" That was wisdom that Ricky learned fast tonight. Clifford nodded, still curious about what he owed Ricky. He marched up to Shelly. She turned to him and batted her wide eyes. \"Cliff! Doesn't it look sweet? They're about to play one of my favorites, 'Since I met you baby.' It was my parent's wedding song.\" Clifford gulped and peeked at Ricky. He wagged his hands for him to keep talking. \"Oh, really? That's cool. It's a nice song. Shelly, do you wanna dance?\" \"I thought you would never ask!\" She clasped his arm and half-dragged him to the center of the dance floor. \"Now we can use those waltz steps.\" Clifford tried to remember the form Evie taught them and put his hand on her waist. He grasped her other one. \"I'm still a novice at this, okay?\" \"I don't care, this is 'sway' music. You don't have to be Michael Jackson.\" \" Nobody is Michael Jackson.\" \"That's true, hey, did you get the 'Off the wall' album? It's one of the best! Mine's already getting scratched up.\" Shelly was so agreeable and Clifford readily liked that about her. They talked, laughed and swayed through two more songs. He finally stepped in closer and she put her head on his shoulder. He realized he should have done it earlier. After a minute, she looked at him carefully. \"Clifford, does it matter that I'm taller than you? I wore flats tonight, did you notice?\" Clifford looked down. Shelly had worn ballerina-type shoes with ribbons up her ankles. He knew she was being considerate of him. \"Shelly, you know, you said yourself; I got some time before I sprout anyway. In a few years, I'll be towering you. I'm sure of it.\" \"But does it bother you?\" Clifford's gaze met hers. \"No. I mean that. Does it bother you that I'm shorter?\" \"No way. I think it's cute. Besides, you're not a wimp. I can wait.\" She giggled and lowered her head again. Clifford laughed and nuzzled his face near her neck. \"Wow, you smell good. I meant to tell you that. What are you wearing?\" \"Oh, Evie's mom has all these great perfumes. This one's called midnight passions . It's not too strong is it? When I was a kid, everyone used to call me smelly shelly for a while, but I never smelled bad! It's just one day I had left a milk carton in my book bag overnight and the milk curdled and got on my books and stuff, and it really stunk. I didn't realize it for a while. And for a few days, nobody wanted to sit near me. They even told the teacher on me. It was the worst days of my life in school. I make sure I don't ever smell now, not my body, not my clothes or hair. I never want to hear that garbage again.\" She prattled on. \"Sorry, I bring up stupid stuff when I get nervous.\" \"You're nervous?\" \"Sure, aren't you?\" \"No way. Smelly Shelly? That's so childish and unoriginal. I'm sorry that happened. It's not killing my nose hairs. It's a perfect scent. Look Shelly, I've been thinking.\" \"Go on, Clifford, I love to hear your thoughts.\" \"Um, yeah, well, it's about us. I wanted to know if you'd…\" Shelly's brows raised hopefully. \"Yeah, Cliff?\" \"Would like to go steady with me? I mean, be my girlfriend?\" Shelly gave him such a wide smile he was afraid her braces would snap. She clutched his neck ecstatic. \"Are you serious?\" \"I wouldn't ask you if I wasn't.\" \"Heck yeah! And just to make it official…\" Shelly yanked his face forward and planted a long, smothering kiss on his lips until he had to pry her arms loose for a little air. Clifford nearly staggered back, shocked. \"Woah, you've got quite a kisser!\" \"I've been saving up. Get over here, Cliff.\" She said coyly. \"I've only just begun.\" -Oo- Ricky found even more courage tonight and glided across the dance-floor with Evie. They came to rest a few feet from the other dancers, but with a view of Clifford and Shelly. He laughed when they kissed and he and Evie watched like two proud old pros whose students had finally progressed. \"Shelly really knows how to lay it on.\" Ricky mused. \"She's funny.\" \"You should hear her when we hang out, she has me in stitches sometimes. I think she and Cliff are perfect for each other.\" Ricky slid his hands on Evie's waist. \"What about us?\" He asked quietly. Evie gazed up at him tenderly. \"We got some bumps to work out, but I'm gonna make it work.\" \"Heh, and I can sit back?\" \"No. I want you…I want you to get well, Ricky. Clear your head of all the demons in your past, and start living up to your full potential, brother!\" She waggled her hands up and down comically. \"You sound like an infomercial preacher.\" Ricky laughed. \"My grandma buys them for my mom and plays them around the house. Anything to keep her spirits up. Mom works so hard for us, and I know she's bitter and upset over the divorce. It stresses her out sometimes. When she's stressed, we're all stressed. You know how it is.\" Ricky glanced down wryly. \"Oh yeah, I know. I've been wanting to ask you, did you tell your mom that we started dating?\" \"Umm, not exactly. But I think after tonight she gets the point.\" \"Look, I don't mean to sound prejudiced or anything, but is she gonna be cool with that?\" \"Why would you sound prejudiced?\" \"Because, I'm not black. She married a white guy, it didn't work out. So maybe she's bitter toward white men. The last thing she'd want is for you to date me.\" Evie chuckled and stroked his cheek. \"Ricky, the last thing my mom wants is for me to be unhappy. She's not concerned with skin color. She likes you. Giving her those flowers scored you some mean points. She loves flowers.\" Ricky let out a whoosh of air. \"I'm glad for that.\" \"Yeah, good call. I told you, I'm not black or white, I'm human, I'm…tan, toffee, whatever. In the winter I get a lot paler.\" \"Sure, In winter you can call me Casper.\" \"Ha! Seriously, I hate this whole idea of distinguishing people by colors or cultures. It's so demeaning. How do you feel about it?\" Ricky shrugged. \"I haven't given it much thought. I mean, I know blacks like to hang with blacks and whites with whites and all the rest, sometimes the culture is different, but so what? I pulled myself out of the equation after…\" Ricky shook his head sadly. \"After the shooting. Nothing mattered to me after that. Nothing .\" Evie hugged him close. \"I know. I know. Do I matter to you, Ricky?\" Ricky stooped down and held her chin. \"You mean a lot to me, Evie. You've helped me to kick out of my shell. I need you.\" Ricky's lips met hers as the music swelled. In her mind it was the most perfect kiss in the history of kisses. She didn't want it to end, but Ricky was still shy and held back. He licked his lips and they stared into each others eyes, holding hands and grinning like fools. The song finished and the lights rose up. Evie tugged him along. \"Come on, let's go talk to people. There's still a lot of shell left to crack.\" She grinned and knocked near his head, clucking her tongue. Ricky held her close happily. \"Yeah. I'm hard boiled. Hey Evie, have you ever ridden a motorcycle?\" -Oo- As the night drew to a close the gym was rocking for a final dance-off and everyone was having a blast. Clifford excused himself to use the bathroom and left to use the ones in the locker room. Clifford couldn't keep from smiling all night. His father was going to be thrilled he had a girlfriend now. Making all these new friends kept him busy, and left him with less time to be isolated and grieve over his mother. Even after three years, her death was painfully fresh. They had been very close since his father was a work-a-holic. Sometimes Clifford wondered how much of it was work, and how much was play . But he chose never to interfere in their personal affairs, or any affairs for that matter. Regardless of his muddled home life, his family still loved him and gave him the best of everything. Ricky had a hard time believing that a sociable kid like him could be a shut-in, but Clifford was for a time in Junior High. It didn't help that he and his father moved twice before he finally got the opportunity to run the Ambassador Hotel here in Chicago. Sometimes he wondered how long this gig would last too. As Clifford pondered his thoughts on his way back, he suddenly stopped walking and listened closely. He kept hearing lockers banging and rattling. It unsettled him, considering half the lights were turned off. Beads of sweat broke out on his forehead. \"Hey, who's in there?\" \"Nobody here but us, Peach pit!\" Moody called out and stepped from behind a row of lockers. \"Surprise!\" Clifford shook his head. \"Great. What do you want, Melvin ? I already broke your nose, maybe I should knock out a few teeth for this round.\" Moody scowled. \"You think you're hot because of one lucky punch, huh? You're the one who's gonna lose some teeth, maybe even more than that, jerk.\" Clifford laughed nervously. \"Screw you! Ya gotta catch me first!\" He broke into a run and slammed into Moody's friends, Dubrow and Koontz. They gripped his arms tight and swung him around. \"Not so fast, fruit!\" \"Get off me, idiots!\" Moody came up to him and laughed. \"I got a big surprise for everyone. But first…\" Moody's fist rammed him hard once, then again. Clifford saw every star in the galaxy and he doubled over. Moody's thugs wouldn't release his arms so he could clutch his stomach. Clifford would not give them the satisfaction of seeing him moan or cry from the searing pain. \"Think...think you're tough...you can only hit me when I'm held up.\" Clifford gasped, then hung his head to prevent himself from vomiting on the spot. \"Hey, shut up! That was just a warm-up!\" Moody bragged, though Clifford's insults stung. \"That got all the hot wind out of him, Moody.\" Dubrow snickered. \"Let's get the fruit out of here before he starts screaming like a chick for his bodyguard boyfriend.\" Moody gripped Clifford's hair, pulling out a cluster of strands. \" Oww! Let go!\" \"If he knows what's good for him, he'll keep his big mouth shut. Come on.\" \"Where…where are you taking me?\" Clifford sputtered. \"We're going on a field trip to the second gym tier.\" Moody checked his watch. \"In five minutes this gym is gonna be washed out, and then I'm gonna run you into the ground. Only surgery will be able to fix your mug when I'm finished. It might be an improvement.\" He sneered. Moody led the way and his friends dragged Clifford through a back exit of the locker room and up the stairwell.[Chapter 3] My Bodyguard: Anxieties Chapter 3 \"Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeeah!\" The students cheered and chanted to the final couple on the dance floor. They were spectacular, doing a combo of jitterbugging and twisting. Mr. G was already coming around to hand them the huge trophy with a gold-painted dancing couple on top. Ricky and Evie cheered from the sidelines too. As Ricky clapped, his gaze caught Shelly standing at the rear of the gym peeking through the back doors. She nervously bit her lip and nails. Ricky whispered to Evie he'd be right back and strode over to her. \"Hey, Shell, what's the matter? You okay?\" \"Ricky, I'm glad you're here. I'm worried about Clifford. He said he was going to the bathroom and he went through here, but that was almost fifteen minutes ago. He hasn't come back. I was kinda afraid to go inside, it's dark and stuff, ya know?\" She glanced up at him with pleading eyes. Ricky smiled reassuringly. \"Shelly, You go stay with Evie. I'll get him. Don't worry. Maybe he ate something that didn't agree with him.\" \"Thanks, Ricky! I don't know, I just think something's wrong.\" Ricky pushed in the door to the locker room. \"Well I'll find out.\" He went inside and without turning on the lights rushed to the boy's bathroom. Once in there he flicked on the light, but it was empty. He noticed one of the sinks dripping, as if had recently been in use. Ricky scratched his head. It was possible Clifford had used the bathrooms in the hall outside the gym, but even he had seen him come in this direction. He rushed out and started searching through the aisles. He listened carefully, all of a sudden getting a vision of Clifford banging on the locker door in his swimsuit–trapped, drenched and shuddering. It nearly made him laugh as it almost did the first time around. He was about to leave when he noticed the door leading up to the gym balcony was ajar. 'That's funny, they always have that locked, and it's still under construction.' He thought. The bad feeling that attacked Shelly hit him too and he went through it. -Oo- Clifford sat very still, huddled between Koontz and Dubrow while Moody kept fiddling with the piping and his lighter. His five-minute guess was wrong and the sprinkler system hadn't turned on. \"You really think it's gonna go off from a little lighter heat?\" Clifford dared to speak. \"Give it up!\" Moody swung around threateningly. \"Ya know, you're probably right, I should just light your head on fire and hold it up there!\" He snarled. \"Be quiet.\" \"Yo Moody, I got an idea, take his jacket and burn it, that outta do the trick.\" Koontz said lazily and flicked his cigarette. Moody grinned. \"Yeah, I like that.\" He snapped his finger at Clifford. \"Gimme the coat.\" Clifford glared at him. He was no longer afraid of Melvin. \"What? No way. This is a rental!\" \"Gimme the damn jacket. Take it from him guys.\" Moody ordered. Dubrow and Koontz shoved Clifford to a standing position and practically tore it off him. \"Stop! Are you crazy starting a fire up here? There are paint buckets and rags and everything!\" Clifford warned him. You'll trap us!\" Moody paid him no attention. His plan had to work. This would finally get him kicked out of school and then he could start looking for a real job working with his older brother at the boxing gym in New York. That was his master plan–To get suspended and finally run away. His father wouldn't care, he'd only be sorry he lost his second punching bag. He would miss his mother though, and her great Italian cooking. But sometimes when she drank she was as nasty as his dad and he had the scars to prove it. The sleeve of the jacket caught the flame and it lit up Moody's dark eyes eerily. He waved it around near the pipes and the sprinkler valve. Smoke was quickly filling up the balcony, blocked from escaping by the blue tarp that covered over it. Clifford shrugged out of Koontz and Dubrow's grip. They were getting afraid and had backed towards the doorway. \"Hey, Moody man, I think you can put that out now! You're gonna burn your hand or something.\" Dubrow said anxiously. \"Yeah, dude, just drop it and let's go.\" \"No, I'm gonna finish what I started!\" Moody insisted, coughing. The pipe was starting to melt. \" Jeeze! What the heck? Do we all have to burn alive before this damn sprinkler goes…\" The alarms started ringing shrilly. \" YES! That did it!\" Clifford raced to the edge of the balcony and peeked out the tarp, watching everyone stop his or her activities and look around confused. The teachers and chaperons were trying to get them in line like they did on Fire Drills. Suddenly, it happened. The sprinklers roared to life showering them all below. All the girls started screaming and everyone tried to race out of the gym. Mr. G grabbed any tablecloths he could find to cover his prize record collections and stereo. Moody was still holding the burning jacket when the fire licked near his fingers, he cursed and flung it. The jacket landed on a drop cloth and it immediately caught the flames. It then partially ignited the wooden bleachers. Clifford backed up terrified. He had been standing behind the drop cloth and the flames were starting to trap him. Dubrow and Koontz shook their heads. \"Oh no! We are outta here, there's no sprinklers workin' up here!\" They ran down the stairwell, crashing into Ricky. Ricky stopped Koontz forcefully and shoved him against the wall. \"Where's Clifford?\" He demanded. \"He's up there man! Hurry, there's a fire! Moody's with him and he's friggin' nuts!\" Ricky dropped his collar and the two ran out of the locker room. Ricky ran up faster. He gasped, seeing black smoke waft from the balcony. He heard Clifford calling for help. \"Cliff!\" He shouted and bounded onto the tier. Moody had dragged Clifford away from the fire and started pummeling him. Smoke was overcoming Clifford. He was still hurt from the last two punches. Ricky skidded near them and waved the smoke from his line of sight. The fire was getting out of control. He had to make judgment call. Moody had Clifford on the floor in a weak headlock; the smoke was affecting him too. Ricky ran to the edge and with one large swoop, ripped the tarp off. He turned to the fire and without hesitation forced the tarp down on it. He stomped around and then pulled off his jacket and tossed that down too. Clifford elbowed Moody in the jaw and crawled to Ricky, attempting to help. The fire was finally getting under control. Moody rose up and rubbed his scraped chin. He was about to lunge for Clifford and the sprinklers went off on all of them. Ricky slumped onto the bleachers, breathless and watching gratefully as the water snuffed out the last of the flames. He bent down and pulled Clifford to his feet. \"Rick, thanks, man. Thanks.\" Clifford shook his hand vigorously. Ricky patted his back as he choked. \"That was so close!\" \"What the heck happened? Moody, why did you do this?\" Moody was enraged. He tugged on Clifford and tried to take a swing. \"Cliff, duck!\" Moody missed, but then suddenly did an uncontrollable spin on the growing puddle soaking the wooden floor. Ricky jumped up as Moody skidded backwards. \"Help me!\" Moody screamed. Ricky and Clifford made a rapid lunge for him just as he toppled over the railing. Ricky leaned down far and grasped his arm while Clifford clung to his leg. \"Man, come on, please!\" \"Ease him up gently!\" Ricky shouted. \"Moody, go limp, we got you!\" A few teachers and some fire men gazed up at them from the ground floor. \"Hey! What's going on up there! Get down from there!\" Two firemen raced through the locker room, seeing how precarious the situation was. Ricky, nearly halfway off the ledge himself, grabbed Moody's other arm and tugged him back over the railing. Moody sank to the floor, he looked about to cry. He couldn't look at his rescuers. \"You guys…after all I did…ya saved my life.\" \"Moody! You freak! You tried to kill me!\" Clifford was furious and went to attack, but Ricky stopped him. \"No, Cliff! Don't .\" He said seriously. He knelt down next to Moody and forced his gaze. \"That's right, Melvin, we saved you because it was the right thing to do and we're not killers. I am not a killer. We're sick of all this fighting back and forth. Look, man, we're not asking to be best friends, we just…\" Ricky suddenly felt pity on Moody. He looked like a helpless, shivering child. Tears flowed from his eyes. Ricky held his shoulder and gently brought him to his feet. He put Moody's hand in his and shook it. \"No more, Moody. Let it go. Whatever it is, let it go . We're not your enemies.\" Moody nodded with his arms folded, he kept wiping his eyes. \"I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry for everything I did. You gunna let me go or you gonna kick my ass?\" \"I'm severely tempted, but naww , I don't want to hurt you. Just get outta here, and leave Clifford and everyone else alone for good this time.\" Moody gazed at Clifford as he walked by defeated. \"Are we cool, bro?\" Clifford hesitated and stared at Ricky. Ricky gave a slight nod and shrug. Clifford begrudgingly shook Moody's hand. \"Yeah, we're cool, Melvin. See ya on Monday.\" \"No you won't. I ain't never coming back here again. I'm sick of this school. I'm sick of Chicago, I'm sick of everyone, man! I'm sorry I picked on ya. I guess it's easy when someone's a runt, but you fought back, you got real guts. I admire that. Just like me and my dad, I don't let him push me around anymore.\" Moody was breaking down. With a last glimpse at them he raced out of the balcony. However he didn't get far, and was stopped by a slew of teachers and the firemen. Clifford hung back, swallowing some guilt. He was profoundly touched by Ricky's gentle disposition toward this bully. The towering tough who supposedly broke cop's legs had to stop him from nearly strangling Moody. Ricky was one of a kind. The sprinkler system finally shut down and Clifford picked up the burnt remains of his jacket. \"My dad is gonna freak out when he sees the bill for this.\" \"I'm gonna be working heavy over-time at the garage.\" Ricky said, wringing out the jacket. \"Ready to face the music, Cliff? They're gonna bust us, you know that.\" \"Yeah, but maybe Moody will tell them the truth for once. My father could help us.\" \"We can only hope. A few twenties might make the principal look the other way. But come on, seriously, none of this was our fault.\" \"They'll believe us. They're on to Moody's pranks for years I've heard.\" Ricky grinned. \"They'll believe you, maybe. Are you okay, Clifford?\" Clifford smiled and nodded, but then grabbed his stomach, wincing from a sharp pain. \"Moody got me twice here. He might have ruptured something.\" \"Just walk slow and take it easy. Don't let Shelly jump ya.\" \"Yeah, she does like to do that.\" Clifford chuckled. \"The girls are gonna be shocked. But man, Rick, we're gonna be heroes! Shelly will get our mugs right on the front of the school paper, hey, this might even get on the TV news, and in the real newspapers across the city. Won't that be great?\" Ricky cringed. He hoped never to be in the papers again. They would only dig up his past and make comparisons. There was always the fear that his brother's case could be re-opened. \"Yeah, sure. I don't really care. Even if it does clear my rep. I did what needed to be done. That's not being a hero, that's being a human.\" Clifford kept silent. Ricky was always bringing him down to earth him with his maturity. They started toward the stairwell, hearing the commotion below. Moody was elaborating the story, and he actually took all the blame. \"I get the feeling he's desperate for suspension. Did you hear what he said about his father?\" Clifford remarked. Ricky looked down stonily. \"Yeah, I did. Moody's an abused kid. That sucks. No wonder he's the way he is. Just goes to show you everyone's got demons, Cliff. Moody just needs to realize his potential as a person.\" Ricky found himself telling him what Evie said earlier. He grinned and patted his back. He didn't want to alienate Clifford with all his moralizing. \"Look, how many times have I told you, Cliff. When I'm not around to get your back, be like Clint Eastwood!\" Clifford laughed. \"I'm not walking around school all day with an iron plate on my chest, okay, Ricky? You and your westerns!\" ","Summary":" My Bodyguard-Anxieties \"Awesome! Get a load of the gym.

The friendly face with the green eyes that had cried as he had pled with her to see the truth behind his lies, the mouth that she had childishly kissed trying to bring him back to life. He was every bit the same Roy she had befriended while in the hospital all those years ago, but part of her was still fighting, still telling her that this could not be true. There had never been a man who told her stories at the hospital. Not a real one. Alexandria had left the hospital before he did, returning to the grove to pick oranges with her mother and sister. She would sometimes wonder what Roy did, if he had found someone else to pinch his toes for him. She would sneak into movie theatres and she would see him in every movie; every man who did something dangerous had his face, and it would give her comfort. But as weeks became months and months became years, she thought of him less and less. His features remained sharp in her memories, but the circumstances blended together until one day when she was 12 she couldn't remember if he had been real or not. So, she convinced herself that the sad man with the broken spine and the broken spirit was just as much a figment of her vivid imagination as the masked bandit in the story. Everything about her stay at the hospital became a blur, except for the sad man and the story. Alexandria had told herself that the only reason she remembered him so clearly, the way his face looked and toes felt, was because she had made him up. Nothing that happened in reality stood out with such clarity. The man was not real, he was as unreal as the baubau her mother had scared her and her sister with when they were little. He was not real. Yet there he was, sitting at the table and waiting expectantly for her to say something. She found herself dumbstruck, afraid that if she opened her mouth it would all come out in the gibberish-English she had spoken as a young girl. She was 17 now, working as a waitress at a café across the road from the Universal Studios backlot. The owner appreciated her because she was not starstruck like some of her co-workers. If a movie star did happen to walk through the doors (which rarely happened), Alexandria either didn't recognize them or she didn't care. She treated them just the same way she treated the regular customers who came in for their morning coffee. She now wondered if this was what if felt like to be starstruck. It was an odd feeling, something like joy and shock and triumph all neatly rolled together. She had not seen him come in. The bell above the door had rung, signaling a new customer. It was a common enough sound, and Alexandria had not turned around. Instead, she had finished loading up the coffee machine before taking her little notebook and looking out over the tables. She had spotted the newcomer in a booth in the far right corner, his back to her, and she hurried over. When he looked up, she was glad she had not brought the almost empty coffee pot with her. She would have dropped it and it would have shattered into a million tiny pieces. Sort of like her mind was falling to pieces right now. Alexandria recognized him instantly. He did not. For seconds, he just peered at her, waiting for her to snap out of it. She did not. Not until he addressed her. \"Miss, are you all right?\" Her eyes found focus again, zeroing in on his lips, the ones that had told her lies and stories. \"A-Alexandria,\" she stuttered, fearing that anything more would make her look like a fool. He furrowed his brow, and she felt her heart begin to sink. He didn't remember her. He didn't... \"The little girl from the hospital?\" His face lit up as he made the connection, and he scanned her face for familiar features. She slowly took out the bobby pins that held her braided hair back, and positioned her left arm as if the cast was still there. \"Alexandria the great,\" he murmured, a knowing smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. She nodded fervently, elated that he remembered her. \"Roy,\" she finally managed to say, not even stumbling on his name. There was a sense of security in saying his name, in knowing he had been real, and that she had not imagined a time in her life that had been equal parts sad and exciting. There had been a man named Roy, who could not feel his toes. \"You can walk!\" The words spluttered out of her, far louder than she had intended. Horrified, she clamped her hands over her mouth, and tried not to blush. Roy gave a low laugh. \"I can,\" he affirmed, then looked mischievously at her. \"Do you want to touch my toes to make sure?\" This time, she couldn't help but blush. He really did remember her. \"What happened after I left?\" His presence brought out her accent even more. She had tried hard over the years to push it aside, but it lingered in the vowels, the way she glided over the L's. Roy told her another story. About a man who was once a masked coward and then ended up not feeling his legs and toes. A man who stayed in bed for almost a year before he could walk properly again. He told her how the doctors forbade the children from straying into the adult ward after what he did to her. He thought about her during his year in bed, waited for the quick pitter-patter of feet and the rustling of the bed hanging. He waited for something that never came. When Roy was finally discharged he had tried to return to the movie studio, but found it unbearable. Too many bad memories. Constant reminders of the life that never was. \"I tried finding you,\" he admitted, looking down at his hands. \"I just never realized how many orange groves there are around here.\" She smiled, and her heart beat picked up at the idea of Roy trying to look for her. \"I wanted to apologize. I was mean to you, and I hurt you.\" She recognized the voice. It was his voice, the voice he had used when she woke up from the surgery. The sad and desperate voice of a man with nothing left to live for. \"I should not...\" His voice broke, and he fell silent, unable to continue. Alexandria sat down opposite him and took his hand. \"I don't blame you,\" she told him, trying to make eye contact. \"I was too young to understand, I only wanted to hear more of the story about the masked bandit.\" He remained silent, closing his eyes so they wouldn't find hers. He was still ashamed of the way he had manipulated her. Using a small child to assist him in his death. Not only did he manage not to commit suicide, he was the cause to her second fall, one that easily could have killed her. \"Do you remember what you told me about the old man's teeth?\" Roy looked up at her, confused. \"I... I told you he kept his strength in them. That's why he took them out at night and kept them safe.\" \"Where did you keep your strength?\" The question was simple, yet he found it difficult to answer. Where had he kept his strength? By the same logic that compelled then 5-year-old Alexandria to believe that strength was in your teeth, he should have been strong. But he had been broken, both in strength and spirit, and it had absolutely nothing to do with his teeth. The logical answer would have been his legs, but Roy knew that wasn't it. Strength was not in your legs. \"Think about it, I'll bring you some coffee.\" With a reassuring smile, she got up, briskly walking over to the counter to take the steaming pot of coffee and a cup. Roy was still lost in thought when she returned, so she set the cup down before him, patted him softly on the shoulder and continued to work. A couple of construction workers came in for their usual lunch, so she ended up leaving him to sit there a good while longer than she had intended. Bustling about the café, she wondered if he didn't have someplace to be, a schedule to keep. Wouldn't he be late for filming? But Roy made no sign of leaving, he stayed in his place, slowly depleating his cup of coffee. When the construction workers finally left and the place once again quieted down, she walked over to him, sitting down opposite him. He was still nursing the cup of coffee, which she found strangely fascinating. Seconds ticked on by, and neither of them said a single word. There was comfort in that, too. Sitting quietly and knowing they were there. For so long she had believed he was just another character she made up, and he had not known where she had ended up after being discharged from the hospital. Knowing exactly where the other was gave them a kind of peace that could not be explained. She wished silence could say more. She wanted to tell him about all the things his epic tale inspired her to do; how she planted the mystic's teeth inside a hollowed out orange half, the times she would run around the grove with her sister to catch Americana Exotica (or something she thought was Darwin's elusive butterfly), the terrifying move from the safety of the orange trees to the city. She wanted to tell him about Katja, the girl she shared an apartment with, how Katja kept her awake by playing the piano through the nights. Alexandria said none of these things, she found herself unable to form the words, unable to adequately convey the feelings and experiences. The English language still guarded that secret from her. \"You.\" Roy's one-word sentence interrupted her musings about language barriers. Had he been talking to her for long? Had she missed an entire conversation? She observed him, puzzled by the simple statement. \"That's where I keep my strength,\" Roy continued, when she couldn't make the connection. \"Me?\" It didn't even make sense once put in context. \"Before your little note fluttered in through the window, I was weak. I was broken, with nothing left in my life to fight for.\" He paused for a short moment, gathering his thoughts. \"And... I admit, for a while I fought only because I thought if I could... fall asleep...\" Alexandria noted he avoided the word suicide. \"...then everything would be fine. Nothing could hurt me anymore. I didn't consider the consequences of using you. I told you a story to get my hands on morphine. But then you fell.\" Roy shifted uncomfortably in his seat, and Alexandria's hand flew up to the back of her head, smoothing down her hair where she knew she had a scar from the stitches. \"I watched you while you were waking up after the surgery. I saw what I had done, and I still wanted to die.\" \"That's why you killed everyone in our story?\" Alexandria commented solemnly, taking his hand. His face had a visibly pained expression on it, and she wanted to once again tell him it wasn't his fault. In her mind, Roy might have died had she not fallen. If not for the unfortunate misstep, she would have given him a bottle full of morphine pills, and her black bandit would not have triumphed over Governor Odious. It would have been a completely different story. Roy nodded in reply to her question, drawing a shaky breath and gulped down the last of his lukewarm coffee. \"You pleaded with me, do you remember?\" he asked, finally looking into her eyes. \"You promised not to kill the bandit. His daughter loved him.\" It was her way of saying she had loved him, maybe even beyond the childish love of a 5-year-old. She had cared for him and hugged him and smiled toothy smiles for him. She had written herself into the story so she could be part of his world, she had begged for his life when he had lost all hope in himself. \"I wasn't strong before I met you,\" Roy continued with a small smile, \"even though I had teeth. And then, even after I told you how I had tricked you, you still refused to give up on me. You forced me to live.\" \"I was very... strongminded?\" she explained, unsure of whether strongminded was an actual word. \"That's where I ended up keeping my strength. In you. In the little bandit who forced me to see the world as it really was.\" \"But... I left the hospital...\" \"You were still there, in my thoughts. I had your drawing, and the cloth with the coffee stain on it, I had oranges and I had our story. There were pieces of you left even after you were gone, so I always had my strength with me,\" he explained, then quickly added: \"And I've needed it.\" \"You have?\" \"I quit the studio I was working at. I went around Hollywood, asking other studios to hire me.\" \"And did they? Did you make more pictures?\" Alexandria asked excitedly, wanting to know if she had really seen him in the movies she had sneaked into. \"A few,\" he admitted, with a sly smile. \"I haven't made any in a while, though. I work behind the camera now. I'm too old to jump off of bridges and fall out of burning buildings.\" \"I'm glad to hear that.\" The bell jingled, and another stream of customers entered. She gave him an apologetic smile and returned to the counter. Part of her expected him to leave, he had had his cup of coffee, they had had their little talk. But Roy stayed. He ordered another coffee, sat quietly in his booth while she served customers and rang up their charges. He didn't leave. She didn't bother pinning back her braids, letting them dance freely on her back, and she could feel his smile when she brought a plate of sandwiches to a couple sitting in the booth next to Roy's. He stayed until closing time. The cook had already left fifteen minutes ago, and the only thing left to do was ring up Roy's two cups of coffee, count and hide the cashbox and then close up. He tipped her, more generously than she liked, but he wouldn't take her no's for an answer. He waited patiently while she counted (and recounted, because she kept losing track of the amount when she would look up at him and find him smiling) the day's cashflow. \"Do you want me to walk you home?\" he asked her when she closed up. She had never been asked that question in her life. She had read about it in books, but she had never experienced it. In the grove there was never any need for a gentleman to follow her home, she knew the paths and shortcuts like the back of her hand. \"I... That... would be nice,\" Alexandria stuttered, and Roy offered his arm for her to take. The walk home, all five blocks, was surreal. She realized how tall she was, how strange it was to see him look down at her instead of being of nearly equal height. He made sure her arm was tucked in between his, occasionally pulling her closer when someone sinister-looking passed them. He was every bit the gentleman, and Alexandria was not sure how to react. They made smalltalk without saying much of real importance, and in hindsight she would marvel at the fact that she actually found her way home in her dazed state. They arrived at the apartment building she lived in. She could hear Katja playing another symphony, she recognized it as one of Beethoven's. Katja played it incessantly. \"Thank you. For following me home,\" she told Roy, hesitantly letting go of his arm. \"It was my pleasure, Miss Alexandria.\" She scrunched up her nose. Miss Alexandria. It sounded so wrong coming from Roy. She had always been Alexandria. Alexandria the Great. \"What?\" Roy laughed at her expression. \"Just Alexandria.\" \"Very well, little bandit.\" She thought about him, how he had said she was his source of strength. Alexandria realized how unfair it was, she had so many fond memories of him. She had the vivid images of their story, a few items she had happened to bring home from the hospital. He had a twelve-year-old drawing and a story that wasn't meant to be what it turned into. \"Wait here,\" she ordered him, then quickly slipped inside the building. She quickly ascended the stairs, sneaking into the apartment without Katja noticing. Rummaging through her things, she finally found what she was looking for. Tucking it under her arm, she snuck out again, almost flying down the flight of stairs. Her pulse raced, hoping Roy had stayed. He had. He stood in the exact same spot where she had left him. Not wasting any time, she ran out and more or less shoved the wooden box into Roy's hands, causing him to almost drop it. \"What..?\" \"Open it.\" He looked suspiciously at her, but never the less flipped open the lid. A look of recognition spread across his face. He remembered the box. It was packed full now. She had saved a lot of things over the years, but far under all of it, there were things from her time at the hospital. Nurse Evelyn's lipstick. The paper mask Sinclair's friend had cut out for her, a jack of hearts from the priest's deck of cards. The wrapping paper from the bar of chocolate Roy had given her in exchange for her opening Walt's cabinet and retrieving the bottle of pills. \"I want you to have it,\" she said resolutely as Roy skimmed through the contents of the box. \"These are your things, Alexandria,\" he protested, but she shook her head. \"I want you to have them. For strength.\" \"Won't you miss them?\" She shook her head again. But Roy was as stubborn as she was. He refused to take the photos of her family and her friends from the grove. They bickered for a good fifteen minutes, before they had divided the contents of the box between them. Roy still got most of it. She only kept the two photos, the small elephant and the bandit mask, \"because every little bandit needs a mask,\" as Roy kept telling her. The paper was yellowed and brittle, but she still put it on, and for a second she felt like she was back at the hospital with him again. \"Thank you for walking me home,\" she said, carefully pushing up the paper mask, breaking the fantasy. \"Thank you for letting me,\" Roy replied politely. Alexandria didn't really know what possessed her to do what she did next. She should've just said goodnight. Instead, she got up in the tip toes, and leaned in to give Roy a kiss on the cheek. Maybe it was just a silly attempt to travel back in time again, to those moments when she would kiss him on the cheek, and it was the most natural thing. Maybe. But Roy caught her movement and angled his head. Instead of a kiss on the cheek, she kissed him on the mouth. His soft lips pressed against hers, and she froze. She had kissed him on the lips before. He had been asleep, he probably didn't even realize it. They had been in the desert, and he was slowly fading away (or so he thought), and it was not the time to sleep. But no amount of kisses or touches could bring him out of it. This was different. This was an accidentally on purpose-kiss, quick as lightning yet at the same time lasting a lifetime. Anyone else would have told her it was a small peck, but to Alexandria, it was so much... more. She stood frozen, eyes wide open, unable to utter a word. Roy smiled a lopsided smile before wishing her goodnight and walking off into the dark evening. As if in a trance, she walked inside and up the stairs. Her fingers traced her mouth, the sensation of his lips on hers lingering like a fingerprint. It felt like... home. Like something she would've put in the box to remember. And that was it. She had given him something to remember her by, something to keep him strong. He gave her a kiss, a physical memory to remember him by. A kiss was absolute. It could not be imagined, couldn't be replicated. It was perfect. When Alexandria went to bed, she felt lightheaded. The events of the day swam around her head. The air seemed to be buzzing with electricity. Roy's voice sounded in her mind, like the crackling voice on a radio station just out of range. \"Close your eyes...\" She didn't even have to rub her eyes. The starry night came as soon as her lids fluttered close. She was five years old again. Butterfly reef lay seemingly calm, but the Indian was fast approaching. Alexandria smiled in her sleep. Roy was strong now. Maybe they could save their friends this time? The Indian broke the surface, they all turned to look expectantly at him. Alexandria took Roy's hand. They were stronger now. This would be a different story. A/N: Not sure if this is a finished story to be honest. Might turn into more chapters if I find the inspiration. It feels finished, yet not. Hmm.

It's an absolutely beauti"},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"Persephone","Author":"RaymondShaw","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13151538","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Persephone - in Greek mythology, the goddess of springtime, flowers, and vegetation abducted by Hades, god of the underworld, to be his wife and queen. Though her release was ordered by Zeus, king of the gods, she was tricked into eating pomegranate seeds (food of the dead) by Hades and thus was bound to him and the underworld forever. Clarissa - female name derived from the Germanic 'Clarice', in turn derived from the Latin word 'clarus' meaning 'bright, clear, or famous'. This ficlet was, oddly enough, inspired by another of Lee Pace's films, 'Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day' - I remembered the scene in which Delysia reveals her true identity to Guinevere and explains that she has entrusted only Michael with the story of her humble origins, thereby having left herself vulnerable to potential shame and rejection. Considering Roy's actress girlfriend in 'The Fall', I wondered if she may have harbored a similar secret and possibly regretted having exposed it to him, not liking to be reminded of her lowly roots in light of her current celebrity. I was exploring a possible reason underlying her decision to leave Roy behind - since the film makes it clear that the titular 'Fall' is, at best, only a secondary motivation (during the opening credits, the actress can be seen talking/flirting with leading man Sinclair/Gov. Odious before either of them learn of Roy's tragic accident) - and I thought that this scenario might provide plausible impetus. I thought it would be interesting if, where Delysia sought acceptance, the actress instead wanted commiseration... Clarissa might be her stage moniker, might be the name that had made her famous and gained her the adulation of the multitudes; but she'd confessed to Roy, once – one starlit night, when the day's shooting was over and everything had run nice and smooth, swell; and two too many shots of celebratory tequila in the director's trailer had left them tipsy and too giddy for prudence – that her real name, the one her steelworker father and seamstress mother had given her, was Jane. Plain Jane , he'd teased her lightly; his own too-loud drunken giggles deafening, the bright stars shining in his eyes blinding so he didn't hear the glass-shard sharpness behind the clear bell-chime in her answering laughter, didn't see the poisonous bitterness in the pomegranate sweetness of her smile and so he'd kissed her – right there, in back of the set, where the camera and lighting equipment was stored in feet-snaring snarls of electrical cords – before he'd thought better of it...thought and perhaps remembered that romance, the possibility of true love, between the princess and the beggar-boy bandit, the rising starlet and the stuntman in the shadows, was the stuff of dreams and of fairytales and children's stories in the land of make-believe; was fake , was a lie , couldn't be real . Her mouth was honeyed and cloying and carried the lingering burn of tequila and he drowned in the taste of it, her tongue coiled around his like a serpent, and the stars tore loose from their moorings and plummeted to earth in a showering burst of dying radiance as he went under with the scorch of alcohol and asp venom flooding his veins; plunging deeper and deeper even before his ankle turned, caught on some loose wiring and he dragged her down on top of him – falling, falling… ","Summary":" Persephone - in Greek mythology, the goddess of springtime, flowers, and vegetation abducted by Had"},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"Like Oranges","Author":"RaymondShaw","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13200704","Passage":"[Chapter 1] *Note: THIS IS NOT MY WORK. I am posting this story because it used to be found here on ffnet, as well as on AO3 (Archive of Our Own). A French translation is still up on both sites, however. This piece is so good it deserves to be read and re-read and appreciated for its genius; I felt it was a shame not to share it. If the original author, flesh_and_bone_telephone, wishes for me to take it down, they can ask me to do so in a PM and I will comply. It's beautiful. I'll keep it with me forever. His hands are graceless – covered in callouses; an indentation on the inside of the little finger of his right hand paler than the rest of his palm, gleaming almost silver from the time he'd tried catching bullets in an act and survived. Riddled with the littlest cuts that look like they were caused by paper, to linear gashes with their own history peppered over his skin – as cliché as it might sound, there is a story to each and every one of them. Though he might not care to remember and specify, he knows: each bruise, each wound was a brick earned, cement as he built himself upwards. He wouldn't have fallen as hard, otherwise. With her good arm, she turns his hands over in hers; little palms and grubby childlike fingers – he can hardly believe they are fit for picking oranges. But Alexandria is an adult trapped in the body of a child; still coming to life in the awareness of the world around her, learning little by little to be wary – but never of him. Her other arm hangs askance from her shoulder, held up in a stiff cast of rigid plaster bandage. He's had his fair share of broken bones, but on this little girl it looks...well, strange . When she walks she does it stiffly, like a wooden doll with poorly-fitted joints, because of that stupid cast and he might laugh…if he were in a position to do so. Roy... Roy can't feel his legs. And the adult-child trusts him; she pokes the skin underneath his eye, the silver of a scar there, kisses his cheek wet and citrus-sticky. Says, \"Roy, Roy – story,\" as if she somehow understands that she holds the pieces of him in her hands, like the old marble of tombs unearthed from archaeological sites to suffocate behind the glass of display cases in museums. Pieces of a wreck. A washed-out stuntman. History all the same; the little details, forgotten. Later no one sees his confused smile in the darkened theatre (that was actually nothing more than a small empty hospital room, but Alexandria liked the sound of the word, theatre ) when he realizes they've cut his stunt out of the movie, cut his fall, his spectacular spiraling notion-shattering fall. He feels like he's had his soul erased, stolen from him. But Roy figures he can't miss it; because you build yourself up knowing you'll fall, and you have to gear yourself up for disappointment because Hollywood kisses and kills you and Alexandria is so small in his hands, and her eyes are like the glimmering brown dust of mocha beans and she wants to hear his story, she wants to hear about Roy. So, he tells her. And then there are men like Sinclair, hair slicked back and gleaming black as shoe polish, with their smooth Mediterranean good looks, even smiles, and suits that kill a man to think about. Men like Sinclair who are heroes, who always get the girl, who stand beneath the sun and move like gold only because the real heroes, with all the gun-spinning tactics and train-jumping fiascos, deal and hide in their Shadows. For the picture, Roy was Sinclair's Shadow. So he knew he was better, because the stuntmen are the cojones that make the leading man. And even if Roy was replaceable, no one thought stunts like him, no one thought of flinging themselves off a train bridge to death and that was all Roy. For a moment, falling...falling Roy felt like death, like God; like he would never land. But he did. He landed where Alexandria was, where she'd survived her own first fall. Where her scrawled note came fluttering in through the window, diamonds cut through the paper, spelling appalling enough to make him start – and she'd come in, precocious and obnoxious and tart, snatching it from his hands and stomping out and he'd called her back, called after her, because...he didn't know why. He'd wanted to know how she got that cast, if he wasn't the only stupid-looking one and she'd said, \"I fell.\" I fell. And Roy had told her a story because he…the landing, the landing was craptacular , and he wanted to leave, he wanted to sleep and never wake up. Just like in the stories. And Alexandria with her gapped teeth, her taciturn braids, the clap of her shoes against the floor when she came to see him, to see Roy – it was bright, and Roy was God again, but playing with something precious. Juggling an intricate house of cards because Alexandria was an enigmatic adult-child chimera but she was still only a child, and she brought him oranges and spilled his coffee, and he'd peel the skin off the fruit and feel that grudging adulation and felt that he was gearing up for his own fall, his last fall this time – and Alexandria would help him. He would leave her behind. But if life wasn't fair, death was hardly any different. The pills were a placebo for the other man, the twist in the tale, his own liberty stolen from him. Roy used to do his jumps on his own terms; now he couldn't even die on his own terms, he couldn't walk, he couldn't keep the girl – the girl who sat in the car dabbing the ladylike tears from her eyes, careful now in case her mascara ran or her rouge streaked and Sinclair was smoking cigarettes and smiling and his manager was going over disclaimer and responsibility papers just so he wouldn't sue, because because. Alexandria falls, again. She splits her head open and he can feel his ribs clench bruisingly around his heart and lungs, his stung throat so tight it hurts to breathe, and he'd been a rotten God because he should have known . He didn't deserve to be a God, even of his own stories – he'd crossed his fingers on himself, he was the Masked Bandit, because he was a coward who believed in foolish stories and fancies and never saw the ground coming 'til it hit him and killed him. And Alexandria was an adult-child and he was a false God, and she wouldn't listen to him when he told her don't believe me; I'm a liar, a gypsy, a joker and a fool – don't believe me, I tricked you and she shakes her head and her face is red and blotchy, her eyes groggy from sleep and grief she feels but doesn't understand, because why, Roy? Why're you doing this, don't kill them; why is everyone dying, why are you killing them? \"Don't die, Roy – no. I don't want you to die. Don't kill him, let him live, Roy. Let him live.\" But I have to, this is the truth. They kiss and kill you, kiss and kill you; and you don't deserve anything, you're lying to yourselves, things like virtue and honour and camaraderie don't exist in this world and they might have in the beginning but not in the end and he's going to finish the story; he might as well. \"You wanted to hear it.\" There's tequila loosening his tongue, and his heart clenches tighter, chokes with failure. Because he fell. \"Let me finish it. It's my story.\" \"No.\" Her tears; they're for you, for Roy. And – – And oh , you are a fool . Somewhere a man is drowning in a pool barely as deep as a pond. Governor Odious holds him down but that's not it; the man can't feel his legs, he doesn't want to, he won't get up. And the mystic vomits up birds that escape from wailing lips, gums red and toothless like an infantile old man's, has his hair torn off his head like a never-been Samson, is flung across the trees he loves so much; beaks spasming up his gullet and, uncoiling deep in his gut, feathers and dust and old, old nostalgia. The Indian's big hands grip tightly on his turban rope, brilliant almond eyes dark but never quiet; there's a knife held between his teeth and he looks into your eyes and slashes the lifeline. Oh! A man huge and gleaming black under the sun, the ground keening under the pound of his sure bare feet, saves a girl, and every pelting arrow is like the crack of a whip's lash; and he struggles and he carries and he stumbles and he falls back, dead and free at last. Darwin in that ridiculous feather-trimmed coat, hankering like a child, holding a monkey close to his chest; cradling his own genius and not knowing a name to call it by. And laughing, a burst of a thousand fireworks lights up the midday sky with smoke, and a whole city's foundation falls – Luigi, Luigi, Luigi. Two-legged and now in too many pieces, smoking and burning like bacon. Dead. And somewhere, here . There's a paper-thin circle in her hand; she takes a bite out of it, insolent and ignorant, and holds it up to his face. Roy asks, is asking, \"Are you trying to save me?\" and she is uncomprehending, and her brow furrows because who cares what does that mean eat it quick I offered didn't I? \"Are you trying to save my soul?\" he asks, looking for the loophole, the fancy light tricks, the hidden trap door. Alexandria doesn't understand. \"Are you trying to save – \" She sobs, and therein lies the conviction, like she would have grabbed him by the shirt if she could have. \"No. Mine, too.\" Alexandria. And so, there are men like Sinclair. And for one brilliant moment, Roy was a Shadow, Roy was God. And people made their own stories, people decided their fate. When Roy brought that little girl into the story, she became his daughter, small and dependent on him – when he did that, he took up the mantle, the duty, of care, of responsibility for what would happen; he'd made the story theirs. Ain't nothing to it. Sinclair was an asshole; he got the girl, he got the charm, he got the glory. But he was only a villain because Roy spun him as one, Roy let him become his nemesis; Roy was the one who tortured himself, because no one else gave the right to Sinclair to make him feel like a washed-out nobody if it wasn't Roy. So, when he got out of that nunnery of a hospital, still unsteady on his feet, he'd gotten better because he'd wanted to. Alexandria had healed up, and was probably going back to what she'd been doing before, picking oranges. And Roy had to live by example and survive. He healed; not brand new, not enough to do the crazier stunts like he used to, but enough to suffice – he still had that daredevil genius in him, on his side. Robin, one-legged and pirate, with his little dog, comes to pick Roy up from the hospital. He's a good man, and he's...he's Roy's friend . He's still working on movies, gag stunts and such, and it's admirable how a man at his age can still find work in the business. Roy is chagrined, won over, and there are a few more movies the man is working on currently; he's friendly with the directors and Robin says he can let Roy back on set, if Roy would like to watch, just to get back into the swing of things and Roy Walker appreciates this – it feels like a warm soldier's handshake when Robin takes him by the hand. It sends a deep slow spreading ease through his bones, a feeling very much like relief. He goes back to the shoot, teetering on crutches and watching the progress, smiling a little bit too wide and maybe a little bit too crazy at the stuntmen. It helps the healing process, he wants to get better; and maybe he makes a suggestion here or there, and he helps out. He's not dead. Not yet. He's just gearing up for the next jump, the next spectacular leap. There's a little money from it, and during the months recuperating out of the hospital Roy slums it up in cheap motels, or when his pride feels flexible enough he'll stay at Robin's house. Up and Down. Here and There. He doesn't know if he feels a little free – or if he should. His cage is built around him, has wheels 'round the bottom; arms outspread, it moves with him. And he is trapped in the fingers of a child, held up against his brow and kissing him. I fell again. I heard. Everybody's heard. You're famous. Are they angry? Yeah. But not at you. \"Roy.\" Robin sits out on the porch; it's three o'clock in the morning and Roy stumbles down the garden path, two buttons missing off his shirt. At the sound of the old man's voice he's stopped like a deer in headlights – he's been caught coming back late like a teenager who tries to sneak back home past curfew. Drunk off his ass, sweating tequila. He doesn't know why he drinks, he just does. And old habits die hard. \"Sit down.\" He pats the wooden planks next to him, disgruntled and eyes no-nonsense. Roy dumps his jacket, kicks off his shoes and he's a man emerging from an ocean, working unsteady feet on the swaying shore. Slumping next to the pirate, skipping the mental processes of thought and thinking nothing until he hears the sound…? Like pebbles in a jar, clacking around glass walls when shaken. His…pills. \"You can't take these anymore,\" Robin mutters once he's sure the bottle in his hand has the young man's attention. \"You have to stop.\" Roy scratches the stubble on his jaw, laces his fingers across his mouth and gives a very hoarse chuckle. It's mirthless, self-deprecating. \"Where did you…\" \"This is my house; I have every right to check. And I'm worried about you.\" \"You shouldn't be,\" Roy says almost brightly, and knows he's not very convincing. \"I only take enough for the occasional pains, only once in a while, I wouldn't lie to you, Robin – it's once in a while, a blue moon; honest.\" Robin sighs, like the oldest willow tree creaking against a breeze, weighed down with age. \"These are bad for you – you remember, you almost… She could have died…for you and these stupid things…\" \"How could I forget?\" \"Those are my conditions, Roy.\" \"To stay at your place?\" \"No.\" The old man is as sober as Roy is drunk. \"To stay your friend.\" He dumps his chin into his slackened hands and rocks sideways and back, drunk and thoughtful. \"You drive a hard bargain; I should have known, you Italians –\" \"Roy, my parents are Irish, you know that –\" \"No, you, you shut up; I'm the leader, I'm the hero – that's…that's my Achilles heel; I need them, you know, Luigi?\" He looks up, beseeching and not completely tame. \"I need them; it's not so hard these days. I'm not sick. But sometimes… sometimes I can't sleep , and I need them to sleep – \" Robin is balding, and sick to the stomach with drunken ravings, but he shakes his head. \"You don't need them, Roy. You only tell yourself you do.\" He goes quiet at this; numb fingers pinch his nose, mop at his brow. There's an agitation in him building up, building up. \"I could never forget, you know that, right? What it was all for, her listening to me…I used her…\" \"It all ended well, so it's fine.\" \"No, it didn't,\" he snaps loudly, as drunk people do. Pitches his words using his outside voice and flails with bitterness. \"It didn't end well. Maybe for me, I'm learning better – but she's not, she's back to picking oranges, our situations didn't change; I'll never see her again. I told her, Robin, she's so stupid , but so am I, I for telling her, and she for believing otherwise because I told her…there aren't any happy endings, not with me.\" \"Roy – \" \"And that's the problem. I can't sleep thinking that, that it never changed – and I think of it all the time, she's gap-toothed and giggling in my dreams, five years old and much much smarter than me… Sometimes in my dreams she goes back to picking oranges, and she falls again, and she breaks something other than her arm; sometimes it's her legs, her spine… I let her live the stories, live in them, and I think I was right to tell them to her; kids like stories, you know? I want to go back to being a Bandit, to kidnapping the princess, to wondrous fantasy; but I can't do that – I can't want that , because somewhere she might be suffering for it, for making her think that the world is a great fantastic fucking place when it's a dump. I'm not a hero anymore, I don't deserve to be; I'm not a hero and I can't delude myself and go back to that. Every time I close my eyes I think of deserts and elephants and whirling dervishes…so I need sleep, dreamless sleep; so I need those pills…\" He is raving; stark raving mad, overwhelmed. \"Would she think any less of me? I don't depend on the pills, I just need them once in a while, to not dream, a little; you know what that's like…\" There's something no one except Robin knows about Roy, though everyone assumes the opposite of the truth on the subject. Robin knows Roy never fought in the war; not like the Americans in 1917, his brothers, his countrymen clashing with German soldiers on the Merne river when their great country joined the offensive. Robin couldn't either, because he only had one leg. But Roy was making movies, and he never went, though he wanted to – oh God , had he wanted to. But Roy was afraid of dying , he'd told Robin one evening, drunk as a skunk, as he was now; at least in stunts he had a say, he knew when it would come, he could meet the ground halfway on a fall – but on the battlefield…bullets fly, and it catches you off your feet, death; it's sudden, and not on your own terms. That made him a coward, a head-down and finger-crossing coward. He never could forget, and he regretted it – war would have been grand in a sense; but he couldn't die that way, and he couldn't serve his country and Robin called him a college man. \"So, you won't move forward, because you assume she can't?\" he demands, exasperated and angry. \"What kind of dumbass notion is that?\" \"I don't know.\" He mops at his glistening eyes. \"I don't know.\" \"Roy, you're already her hero – you made a promise to that girl, I don't quite know what the hell you mean by elephants and all that babble, but it seems you have an obligation to that kid. Hero? You have to set a goddamn example; so, you never see her again, s o what? You see this?\" And he rattles the morphine hard and vicious, cocking the lid against Roy's temple like a gun barrel. \"This will be the end of you. You make too many assumptions on the state of things in other places; you have no control over what happens to her now, so fine . But you have control over your life, so get your damn act together – be the hero, live up to those words, don't talk the talk and chicken on the walk. Don't be a coward, you don't have the excuse anymore. And if you loved that little girl enough, you'll know she put faith in you – so stop talking gibberish, and stand up, get up, and man up!\" \"…I can't just change, old man.\" \"You can't know,\" Robin hisses, \"if you won't even try.\" In the end, he lines up all his bottles on the bathroom sink, rolls up his sleeve and – he can't…he just can't. He needs and gets Robin's help to flush it all down the toilet; the old man directs him like Roy's a limb-numb child again, like he's helping a blind man across the street, emptying all his pills into the bowl. Then the old man gives him a packet of cigarettes and says he'll teach Roy how to smoke. It won't be the same. But it will get better. Not the time to sleep, now. Not the time to sleep. Wake up. Wake up, it's not the time to sleep now. Wake up. Don't pretend to sleep. Wake up. Not the time to sleep now, Roy! He can't win. That's because our Masked Bandit is a coward. Yeah. He never took an oath, he's a fake. He's a liar and a coward. You're lying. No. He had his fingers crossed. He has to die. I don't believe you. He's dying. Don't kill him. There's nothing left for him. His daughter. He wasn't her father, either. She loves him. She'll survive; she's young. I don't want you to die. Roy. Don't kill him. Let him live. Let him live. Don't kill him. Roy? … Promise? And don't cross your fingers. … …Promise. Show me your hands. … … …See? One evening, he takes his beat-up old car down the boulevard with the cover down. 1933; Prohibition is over. The stars glitter like sparse and far-off jewels; his legs work fine, work the automobile past gold-gilded pavement and emblazoned letters, past the names and the billboards and down to an old bar-and-grill, just out of the way. He wears sunglasses, perched up in his wind-rattled hair, slings his jacket off and takes the walk into the bar, feeling the liberty of his own steps; he can do it. California heat burning the back of his neck when he orders a drink, perspiration on his forehead good-natured and real, condensation pooling down around the bottom of his glass on the coaster. There's a woman, of all things, sitting on the counter top – young, polka dot skirt and painted red lips. Her skin is dark, and she talks sweetly to him, in smooth unbroken English. He's charmed and frustrated by the imprint of memory he can place onto her, trying to find the little nuances. Like a game. Her accent is vaguely Southern, and her English good; colloquial, though – no older than sixteen, fluttering her painted curled-up eyelashes at the boys posturing by the jukebox. At that age, bold and a little bit stupid, endearing maybe. She's looking for a man to buy her a drink like most girls are; he doesn't ask what she's doing out on a weeknight, her skin is dark and her eyes are foolish-bright and Roy buys her a drink which he knows is off his conscience for having too much ice and not enough kick. \"Why, sir… You're a gentleman ?\" He laughs into his glass, almost chokes. He's a Bandit. A few years ago, in dirty sheets without strength to go to the bathroom down the hall. But now, he's a gentleman, and he thinks of Bandits and his Bandit Daughter and imagines her too wise to turn this way should she reach the age, too wise for boys and jukeboxes; that her head will always be filled with elephants trekking through Mediterranean waters, blade-spinning Indians and princess-stealing Bandits. It must be so. Alexandria with her serious eyes, yet who giggled at everything he said; who wanted to know his story, who saved him. And the girl at least has that much in common with Alexandria – she giggles too much, though flirtatiously and out of her league, because he's older. And he's looking for his Bandit Daughter in her kohled eyes, and he smiles slow and almost sleepy-happy, safe. \"No, no,\" he says, and she sips her drink. Ladylike with booze, fashionable to the disgusting bite of it. \"Never that.\" She laughs, high and distracting. It makes Roy want to laugh, too; this dumb youth. Not wise like Alexandria, who he will never see again. \"Smile for me,\" he tells her. His eyes are soft, and her cheeks heat up at the sudden sentimentality of his gaze, the lingering offness; she can't put a finger on it, but it's flattering and disconcerting and she does. She smiles wide and flawless. Her hair, held back in yellow ribbons, is curled in tight little ringlets; black and gleaming – not wild and errant, flying from braids. Her English is flawless, copes with the rising culture; she has no accent, no broken hesitation in her phrases. Roy puts the money down for both their drinks, gets up and pats her head like a father...tall and overwhelming, a safety blanket. She is not Alexandria; the nostalgia feels like the slow blue ache of autumn rain, and it's California. He will never see Alexandria again; it kills him a little, makes his fingers twitch for a cigarette to drive the pills from his mind. Her smile is too white, too even. He won't ever see Alexandria again; it's impossible. Not unlike a fairytale, where nemeses meet on old dusty roads, or lovers and brothers are reunited after several years, it can't turn that way, and he'd be a bit stupid to hope for it. His fingers twitch, and he thinks of the pills flushed down the toilet, and he has a pack of smokes in his shirt pocket, to drive the thought of pills away…it's alright to dream about Alexandria; Robin said it was alright. And this girl...she wasn't his gap-toothed Bandit Daughter; and Roy can only imagine Alexandria, grown in these few intervening years into a memory apart from himself, a sweet dream. He gets back into his car, drives back to home and Robin's study. It's still early in the night; he filches an old faulty biro and a sheet of corporate movie studio printed paper…and he writes. They work on another movie together; a damsel-in-distress, burning-building scenario. Roy is excited about this one, it's dangerous; it sets his mouth in a grim line and his heart running at a thousand paces a minute. He'll be working with Sinclair again; it's a year since he came out of hospital and the star looks as smooth as ever, as untouchable. He smiles at Roy when the director gathers them together, but Roy only nods in greeting, because he frankly doesn't give a damn. No one is going to hold his hand. He's lost everything; but he's alive now, he has nothing to lose – and he already defeated Governor Odious in his head, and he realized what an underwhelming villain he was, gleaming cufflinks and smooth smirks and all. Roy is his Shadow again. He does his job. In the days that follow, She visits the shoot. The first time he sees her, after so long – after she betrayed him, left him for Odious (Sinclair) – he's surprised, a little unprepared; she's in red, a button-up blouse and a long skirt, standing by Sinclair's trailer. He remembers the flare of her hips, the sweetness of her mouth; how she'd cry and manage to look so pretty doing it, like Roy was some damn moviemaker, like he was worse, a member of the audience to cater to her and revere her. Because he'd been sure they were written in the stars; the rising actress falling for the invisible stuntman, like a princess running off with a Bandit, a street rat. But she was nothing but a ragdoll, who fooled him, made a mockery of love...and deserted him. He'd worshipped her. Her eyes widen; she holds a hand to her mouth, says Oh, my...Roy. Roy...! The tears come, on cue, glisten in phony purity and perfection; her kid-gloved hands clutch his arm, her cloying perfume smells like strawberries and something noxious and dizzying. She is bad for him, like opium; she drugs him and deceives him and he'll have no part of it, not anymore. She's desperate, and she takes his face in her lily hands when he turns away. Beseeches him, not to love her, but to believe her – because she's an actress, isn't she? She is close enough to kiss, and he could have. Oh, Roy would have. He's a stuntman; he has survived fires and falls, tumbles and bullets, and slighting a man like Sinclair by kissing his woman would hardly be frightening. Sinclair's woman , the words spill like ash across his brain, once was mine . Poor man, Rich man, Poor man, Rich – but like a Shadow, Roy only wears the skin of another man; he's the double, the behind-the-scenes man, the takes-a-bullet-and-dies man – and, truth is, he and Sinclair are probably in the same boat, tied to a woman so grossly unreliable, a deserter, that he pities the day Sinclair is bedridden or a calamity befalls him; because starlets flee whenever they suspect the shine is lacking and...he should have known ...in the end, the princess is fickle and false and he won't fall for it again. She's expecting him to steer her behind the trailer and kiss her senseless, maybe; to burn down in defeat and prostrate himself before her in love – because that's what happened in the movies; wicked women were forgiven and once more became saints. She does not expect him to shrug her off, pry her fingers from his face, and laugh at her. The laugh of an adult to a stupid child, distrustful and uncaring. \"Oh, darling,\" he tells her, smile lopsided, roguish, \"you're a fool.\" He doesn't look back. There's really something about California that Roy couldn't imagine being without; the air there, the weather, it's hot and burning, from the matted humid air of a traffic jam to the crisp clean bite the ocean breeze along the coast takes from your lungs. Everything is vibrant, bright and burning, from the sharp green of grass that must be kept wet lest it dry and crackle into flame, to the coast that's blue and blinding when the light glances off the waves. Money feels hot in your palm; crisp dollar bills smoking along the edges, coins branding your insides like silver, like magic bullets. Funnily enough, you can feel both hate and love for it. His shirt sticks to his back; it's six years since his accident. He takes off his hat, mops his forehead with the back of his hand; squints against a sunrise. Sometimes, these days, he has the odd longing for the bittersweet of oranges. It's twelve years later; he doesn't look it, but he's thirty-five now. He's making his way out of Hollywood, there isn't much need for an old stuntman, and thirty-five is dinosaur years he tells Robin with a grin, small and lopsided; he doesn't have a wooden leg to go on with gags like Robin did. And the older man raises his sherry in a toast to this, having fast gotten out of the business a few years ago. For a stuntman, his face has been left unmarred; women find him lucky in that respect. He still has a smooth, clean-planed face, or, at least, so the last girl told him; and he shaves every day. His hair hasn't thinned and he smiles; he's thirty-five whether or not he looks it. His body is lean, almost too lean Robin grunts, eyes rheumy and laugh lines digging at their edges. The dog is still alive; just as old as Robin, with its sleepy head laid against Roy's boot and Roy scratches its wobbly side almost absentmindedly. Roy writes. Nothing too spectacular, mind. Just little articles, here and there; stories – some have been published in magazines under appropriate pseudonyms, some (like the tale of the evil Governor and the princess; the five men, the Bandit and his Bandit Daughter) he penned down and kept in the back of his drawer, private and an homage to the past. Too precious to share for money. He thumbs paper, and pours out words thick like dictionary ink, and there are new cuts on his fingers, writer's callouses; little tinier scars. For he can't stand typewriters; they jar him, and send horses thundering through his head. Roy writes. He's surprised, himself, that he does. But it feels right, it feels like it's what he should be doing; he'd been doing it since the accident, since the little girl…and he hasn't stopped. As a stuntman it feels right, because he sets up the action in the movies for the moviemakers, he's the invisible spine of the show, the Shadow...and as a writer, he's an invisible God; he makes the story, the elements all connecting and correct. It is empowering, it is benign; it feels grounded after the fall. Of all the places, of all the silly places to meet her – it's in a library; undramatic as it may be, underwhelming it is not. He didn't recognize her at first; just a pretty young thing with hair tucked up in a no-nonsense bun, and a pert little nose buried in the latest issue of a cowboy graphic novel. She wears reading glasses, rimmed blue, and his heart stutters to a stop by her chair, palm glancing off the polished wooden surface of the table, and she looked up impatiently, at his terrified wonderful eyes because he asked very suddenly why...why wasn't she supposed to be picking oranges. Her eyes flash with anger, that spirit he knows so well. She opens her mouth to snap him clean in two and then her jaw slackens. \"Oh,\" she says when they lock eyes. \" Oh! \" And he's shaking, smiling and grinning madly when his mind floats away from him and she gaily screams near to take the roof off the building, and without further ado launches herself at him. \"Roy! Oh, Roy! It is you!\" She's giddy and taller, still small though; and she remembers him – she remembers him. Her weight jolts him, slight as she is, and he's laughing; his fingers brush the little curls at the nape of her neck, he's smoothing the hair away from her face. \"I cannot believe – \" she claps her hand over her mouth to silence herself, but her clear moss-gray eyes (long-lashed below a slightly sculpted brow; no more baby fat) are alight with something he knows all too well when she points to the 'Quiet' sign above their heads, and hushes him – had her eyes always been like this, the dust motes gold around them? Now she whispers to him. \"It is you.\" \"Alexandria the Great,\" he says, and she grins and he wonders when she got so, so...? \"I thought you'd forgotten.\" She snaps her fingers and crosses her heart, whispers like they're thick as thieves; a blood oath. \"Never.\" Something in his chest clicks into place, when she one-handedly tosses her book shut and, managing to drag him between the aisles, she orders him, quite simply, to walk. He raises his arms, rolls his eyes and takes his steps forward and backward. \"Fully functioning,\" he tells her wryly, and her eyes are glassy-wet when she laughs. \"I see you.\" Later, they are sitting on the wide front steps of the building; her legs folded underneath her, skirt covering her knees. Picture-perfect propriety. She must be seventeen now. Roy is still adjusting; he can't take his eyes off her. She is so very new. \"Every time I go to the movies, I was seeing you in your stunts; and I watch many movies many, many times to make sure it is you.\" He clucks his tongue, arms on his knees and his back against the steps. \"Why'd you do that?\" \"Well,\" she murmurs, then laughs awkwardly when she brushes a strand of hair behind her ear. \"I thought Mamma lied to me, maybe, that you are fixed...sometimes I think I imagined seeing you, because that would be easier.\" \"I'm sorry,\" he says, not knowing exactly what he's apologizing for; but knowing that there is something he feels sorry for, painfully so. \"Don't say that.\" Alexandria smiles. \"I liked watching you.\" \"You're a very silly girl, Alexandria.\" He reaches over to ruffle her hair, like he would a child's, because she's Alexandria. Except that doesn't quite work anymore; she ducks his hand and laughs, pokes him under the eye almost hard enough to blind him. \"I never forget,\" she says, while he's still recovering – her accent is still there, thick and rolling, but no longer difficult to understand; her wording is still raw. It makes him wonder. \"About the stories. You always told them the best.\" \"I'm glad.\" Roy doesn't think he can say much more, except… \"You're still a Bandit?\" \"Of course!\" she says, and giggles. Still the same Alexandria, always giggling at whatever he said, lighting him up from the inside, making firecrackers go off in his head. \"Oh, but I do not pick oranges anymore, since you were asking before. I work in the city now. It is better, no? Odd jobs here and there, a maid and these things...Mamma let me; doctor warned her about my falling, so she give me permission to come to the city. I make enough money to send back home, and after work I go to the movies. Or the library, like now. What about you, Roy?\" Roy, Roy, Roy; she's always saying his name. He wonders if it's etched into her heart, like hers is into his. Roy. Alexandria. \"Stunts,\" he says. It's late afternoon; the steps are red like ripe tangerines and cast her face half in light, half in dusk, but her smile is always there. She's slim, slender in a way that reminds him of the wispy branches of the trees back home, stealing into farms and palming apples, bruising his knees; and yet she holds herself with her own custom-made dignity, spirited yet grinning, like the days when she would have ripped her grubby note from his hands that first time they'd met, like today laughing at him, like her smiling against his elbow on a dusty old hospital mattress, throwing orange peels at his head. Alexandria. \"Have you fallen any of this time recently?\" she demands of him, looking him over like it's her responsibility. She doesn't like lying, and he won't, not to her. \"Just a few stumbles, here...and there.\" \"Here and there?\" she echoes doubtfully, but in good heart. \"Yes,\" he smiles; and then she turns to her side, digs through her satchel for a sheet of paper and a pencil. She looks like a schoolgirl, rather than a librarian. She should let down her hair, it would frame her lovely heart-shaped face so beautifully; he can't call that the face of a child anymore, her lips are too full and her mouth curved so, those blue-gray-brown eyes of hers he'd thought of as mocha clearly shine like the colour of dusty jewels of an exotic species. He couldn't name them. She scribbles on the sheet, tears it off and leans close, pulls his hand towards her; he lets her. Her skin is warm against his, her fingers long and graceful, soft but not fanciful; they are deliberate when she pries open his unresisting fingers and places the paper there, presses it into his palm like a piece of the Church's consecrated bread; holy. It feels like a kiss, and she tells him: \"This is my address, alright?\" He opens his mouth to query, but she smiles beneficently and pats his hand; then she folds his fingers over the paper, safekeeping keepsakes. \"I stay with an old family friend, she...saves letter for me,\" and then abruptly she stops, ears colouring red (or maybe…he can't tell if it's her, him, or the fall of the orange sun that paints the blush on her cheeks), starts haltingly, \"Though you don't have to write, Roy. This is just in case – \" \"I could walk you home.\" \"No, no; I am not to go home now,\" she replies, like she's the adult here. She had the habit of using that tone once in a while, back then. \"I have, 'nother shift, somewhere else.\" I could wait, he wants to say, I've been waiting all these years, I could wait. But Alexandria lays her hand on his cheek, between a pinch and a pat, and kisses the skin under his eye, on his scar; it's all very chaste – and her lips are soft there… His eyes flutter shut for a moment; and then she withdraws, smiles at him plain as day, without fallacy, stands up with the sun at her back. He dreams of horses, and blue cities sweltering under a desert sky, the scattering of lotus petals, and Alexandria. The sun against her hair…she looks like she's burning, burning like a city at night, like citrus; burning California. She's gone before he can catch his breath. He goes home, back to Robin who'd told him many times that he couldn't do gag stunts. I've had my leg chewed off by savages, sawed off by criminals; even had a harpoon through it. You can't do gag stunts. Gags are not for you, Roy. You're a college man . Roy smiles, thumbs his paper, writes a letter to Alexandria. Except it's not that simple – he feels like he's writing a letter to a country, a piece of his soul, his self; and it becomes more than just one letter...it's papers among papers of stories, pages clipped together and bound in an envelope. Which he promptly rips in half and crumples into the trash. He can't give her stories; she's a woman now, a young lady with slender wrists, and his hand feels more appropriate resting on the small of her back than patting her on the head and Roy tears his fingers through his hair in agitation. If he sends her stories, he might love her. He can't. So, he writes other things – about the movies he's been in, his rather stranger stunts; about his childhood in LA, breaking fire hydrants and dancing in their splash, stealing into vineyards. He sends them…and thinks he might love her still. I buried the old man's teeth in an orange skin; it is in a field now, I like thinking that it has been growing...the Indian on the farm had been asking if maybe the orange tree that would grow up there from it might be having teeth! Remember what you tell me that time, Roy? That the spirit strength is in the teeth, the man's soul, that's why he put it in a glass by his bed every night. I do not remember much, only that he was very kind to me; and in my dreams he was the Mystic…and in my dreams, Roy, you were always the hero. The Masked Bandit. Her lettering is painstakingly neat – not like his, which is like the etches of a knife scrawling against wood; deeply cut, clumsy, haphazard. Between her bad grammar and his handwriting, they are a match. And he writes back, almost always promptly with other anecdotes. He dares not speak a word about how she saved him, because if he starts he doesn't think he'll stop, and it's a dangerous road from there. You're seventeen now, aren't you? You write well; I'm impressed. And even in her letters, on paper, he hears her laugh; feels her smile against his skin. Wonders if she smells like citrus. Letters don't cut it, and Roy all but camps out at the library these days hoping to catch sight of her. On a Thursday his efforts are rewarded, and he corners her for coffee. An open café with little tables; she's impressed, but not overawed. She has her pride – Roy doesn't let her pay for anything and she almost throws a fit over it. Instead, she huffs and spreads apart the plates and the tea to place a tin rectangular box onto the table; it's old and rusted along the edges, a long time ago it might have been used to keep chocolates. \"Look,\" she tells him, and she opens the box. Draws out paper cuttings and paper-mâché masks, crayoned drawings and silly little oddities. He knows that box. \"Remember?\" He picks up the mask, by its strings first; almost reverently, carefully – careful now. He can't be blamed if his fingers tremble. \"See!\" she crows. Her white dress clashes horribly with her click-clacking flat red shoes…and all of a sudden, this girl-child, he knows she's his – she must be; and he's hers. It can't be any other way; after all, she's carried his soul with her for so long, how could it be otherwise? His mouth feels dry, he swallows back a choke of air, and asks her; like that time before, when it wasn't her. Breathes deep and fluttering. \"Smile for me?\" You remember a lot for someone who was very young then. You cried for me, too. He takes his beat-up old car down the street, blinks at the paper in his hand at intervals, turns the wheel and goes down unfamiliar roads and crossings. The streets are tighter, with buildings stacked clumsily over each other; it's a dusty old urban neighbourhood that speaks of immigrants and lower-level income. There are few trees, and even his ugly automobile looks pleasant when contrasted with the surroundings he now navigates through. Soon enough, the streetlights turn on; show up the sidewalks in murky light, and make the fire escape railings shine like sticks of licorice. He stops the car a little off to one side of the road, one wheel climbing the pavement so he is tilted on a slight angle. Roy thumbs up his sunglasses to peek at the six-story building sandwiched between what looks to be a kosher butcher's shop with rosaries stretched across the door frame and a liquor store where a loan shark squats, coughing, against a lamppost. Eyes turn to sweep over him, curious. The American has come forth on a four-wheeled mystery to where nary a one of their kind dares to venture. Roy Walker is not from a rich family; he spent his childhood in other people's groves – not working, mind, but stealing oranges for sport, cutting his palms on sharply playful branches, early callouses to compliment future ones. Hs father had owned a vineyard, his mother was a Scottish woman born and raised in New York – yet he has known little else but the Californian sun, and its magnificent heat. He was well loved, went to college to amuse himself, learnt architecture and agriculture. Drank his fill and skipped out on the war. Learnt how to be the ghost in those brilliant, brilliant moving pictures. Not even college sounded pretty after that. And Roy had been very good at almost dying, each and every time. Two boys with branches, rolling cans across the pavement for play, stop by his car; curious and awed by the man with the sunglasses. He rolls down the window and opens the door to put his legs out. Talks to them and listens to their accented questions about his car; their excitement is catching. It's an old car, they reason. He agrees. Why don't you sell it? No, I can't do that. This car is like my family. Eh? It's old, mister. Just like me. You have a dog, kid? No. Got a cat, though. If your cat got old, would you put it down? What do you mean, mister? Put it down, put it to sleep. Sell it. Would you? Well, no, mister. See, exactly. No, no, mister. That's different, you can't compare a cat and a car. It's different. How's it different? Just is. He asks, gives his best attempt at a Hollywood smile, \"Is there a girl called Alexandria who lives in that house?\" They look at him, suddenly somewhat hostile, suspicious and warning. \"Maybe. The landlady would know.\" \"I knew her when she was a kid; did you know?\" He eases them up with a smile, \"She had gapped teeth. You can't tell now, but she really did have gapped teeth; and she was so small, just about your age.\" It works. \"How do you know the Romanian girl?\" \"We both fell,\" he says. \"And, so, we were in the same hospital. I used to tell her stories.\" \"How'd you fall, mister?\" \"I used to be a stuntman,\" and that had them all types of starry-eyed and crowing, asking him if he knew Charlie Chaplin. \"Once; a swell guy, that Charlie.\" \"You're not her boyfriend?\" Roy opens his mouth, hesitates – \"The landlady don't like that type of business; she's an old-fashioned Jewish broad. One of the girls there had a tom; he used to sneak in, and he'd always get caught. She's mighty crazy.\" And then a gasp, the open-and-close of a faulty iron gate…and Alexandria in her slippers. A long shift that covers her skin and gives a little glimpse of everything but her hands. For the first time in his life, she's speechless. Rendered so only momentarily, of course. \"Roy!\" she exclaims, tucking her dressing gown around her shift and pattering down to his car. \"What are you...?\" He is suddenly very cautious; has he made a mistake, somehow? Did he misread an invitation? The paper with her address catches her eye, and she comes forward to shoo the two boys away. They grumble, and are off. \"Oh, Roy!\" \"Am I making trouble for you?\" he worries. \"She is not here right now, the landlady.\" She cracks a grin, over the shock. \"I did not expect you.\" \"Is she strict much?\" \"She is from Romania, like my parents. Very...old-fashioned. However,\" she tastes the word; her mind has been eager for all sorts of words these years, \"she has gone in, for synagogue prayers this night; she will be back soon.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"You could not have known.\" He stands up from his car, averts his eyes. Her hair is down, he notices; it curls around her shoulders in wisps of heavy brown like languorous smoke twirls too heavy to be carried easily by the wind. Thick, like the kerosene smoke that rolled from the smudge pots and kept the oranges from freezing on cold nights. Kept them alive… He should not look at her so directly. \"I'd like to be with you, sometimes; take out you to the park.\" Her face lights up, her skin dark and smooth with summer. No Helen could rival. \"I work very much – \" \"But you're free, sometimes. Right?\" \"Hm. Landlady will never throw me out – she is relative.\" \"Oh.\" He stands a little straighter; makes the mistake of meeting her bright, bright eyes and falling in love with her all over again. \"Can I drive you around, once in a while, Alexandria?\" \"Only on Saturdays,\" she says, looking askance at him from beneath her lashes; bashful, almost. \"Is it alright?\" \"It is. It's perfect.\" Dangling off the edge of a precipice, holding on by ribbons of green silk, a masked man in hakama careens through the air…then leaps. A burning God, a magnificent hero; falling, flying through cinder-strewn air. Drops to the ground from perilous heights, lands – on his feet like a cat, on an Aegean hot day; insurmountable, undefeated, her victor. Talks to her in tongues strangers could never understand; her wonderful conqueror. Bandit. Alexandria, who sleeps on the tide of cars riding down the dark roads, plaits her hair between shifts of working hours, slips on her business-brown hose and watches the pavement; longing for the breeze that will arrive and occasionally snatch up newspapers and, once or twice, like a familiar friend, pull on the edges of her straight-laced shirt, her braids. Her days are in a colour none but she could imagine, and few in the world, no, not even prophets, could convey – in the train, there is the flash of Mediterranean blue, like an ocean city in cool shadow, and in the fruit stalls every Wednesday she smiles at the red of strawberries like the blood red oath on the Indian's forehead who was so silly-looking in his blindfold; she carries cardamom and vanilla in her satchel, imagines doves on the railing of her fire escape. She is a stilted child, surviving on snippets of dreams in an adult's life. Peter Pan has nothing on her. Roy once tells her that she makes him feel like a child. They're at one of the parks; the big-laked one, with the imported trees from somewhere in Asia, he mentioned, that in spring are supposed to burst into a profusion of pink flowers. At the moment, her hair is still wisping out from her bun (no braids today) on her free Saturday because Roy's car was a top-down old one, and the wind rushed through. It made her face numb. Like a smile. His lanky, long-panted legs are propped on the rise of a tree root; his head pillowed by his folded jacket, a hat on his chest. Like Huckleberry Finn. \"You laugh so much, you smile so much,\" he explains, in that way of his. \"You must know some secret of this world that I don't – to be so at peace with it. Am I wrong?\" And then his eyes are alert and almost panicky; looking up at her, frantic and almost lost, for reassurance. \"You are happy, Alexandria. Aren't you?\" Most older men who are with young women, even not in that way – they seem old. But Roy doesn't even seem young, he looks at her with such eyes. He is not caught in the folly of an old man who tries to reclaim lost bygone years through a pretty ornament by his side; he doesn't even have gray in his hair. His eyes are so trusting, so searching, so curious – they could swallow her whole, in their near-feverish concentration. And he too much enjoys the climbing of trees and the telling of stories to seem anything but a child when he has such eyes. He is like he was in the hospital. He relies on her. He is her responsibility. His temples are framed by his hair, brown and thick to run fingers through; he looks boyishly endearing when he drives with his glasses tucked back in that hair, sometimes. But his skin is sun-warm, tanned slightly; like a man's. A roman nose, having been once or twice broken and set with his own hand, possibly. The silver of a scar beneath his eye. His large, warm hands. A straightforward laugh. The burning need to be oh-so-honest; his eyes. \"Are you not?\" she challenges in return, a lilt of a smile in that same tone she was so well known for in her youth. \"You are?\" He presses on. \"Yes; I work, I meet Roy again. Why not be happy?\" She lifts the basket onto her lap, and concentrates on peeling the oranges she has brought, because his eyes are too much like helpless gratitude, and even she could not look into that and stand stoic, unwavering. Oranges are familiar, like the grove on the outskirts of town she is saving up money with her sister to buy, perhaps, someday. For Mother. In memory of Father. She has them separated in slices and pieces; so good with a knife. She passes him a plate of them, the nice-looking plate that she normally keeps polished in the glass cupboard with all her best (and meagre) silverware, but she took out into the sun for Roy. The grass tickles the skin lining the creases of the backs of her knees, her skirt is folded neatly over bare legs; she did not wear stockings today because it was a holiday, and she needed the feel of the green. \"I thought maybe you would hate me,\" he says in the heart of a confession, when he sits up and his shoulder brushes hers against the tree trunk, as they sit side by side. She is surprised, beyond words. He fills in the gaps; explains, after a pause. \"You see, I told you stories of an idyll; a paradise. And you were only a child. I made you believe in beautiful things; adventures, heroes, magic and daring – I thought if you believed in them so strongly, only to realize that they were only fantasy; that all of it was a lie – \" \"It was not a lie.\" He looks at her. His eyes are the cold colour of gray rivers running, widening into the crystal sea. Even today, he still reminds her somewhat of a destroyed forest, the rippling stillness of water; the stillness of lonely thought. \"You can't always live in stories, Alexandria.\" \"Why not?\" He frowns. She'd said that a little forcefully, louder than she normally would; with mouth almost severe and eyes no-nonsense. \"Because life is not a fairytale; reality is harsh. And the stories were a brief reprieve, like a magician's show. It's an illusion. Paupers do not turn into princes overnight; there are no princesses, no bands of supermen ready to fight evil – and when you realize that... Why don't you hate me? I have not been with you, all these years. I as good as abandoned you. I didn't save you.\" She shakes her head, and wipes her orange juice-covered palms on the grass. Looks up at him, with a small smile at his confusion, wiser than he will ever be. His Athena. Leans a little on his shoulder, cheek on his arm. \"Silly Roy.\" He closes his eyes; when she glances up at him from this angle, rested against him, he is even more handsome. \"Silly Roy.\" Fingers against the sleeve of his shirt. She has missed this; it has been so long since the days spent in that hospital room cast in perpetual half-light, with his head lolled and sleeping right next to hers. \"You are always the hero, of course you are real. Never doubt it.\" How could she love him, otherwise? No; you should ask someone else. There's no happy ending with me. I still want to hear it. The science – or, rather, the motivation – behind his life with Alexandria is simpler than Roy understands it to be. It is peppered with guilt, and gratitude, and such desperate anguished longing that it could not help but reverberate through the core and marrow of his bones. His heart. He remembers the time before; the table they'd set her down on, her bandaged head as she lay still as any corpse. He'd bitten his nails 'til he worried them to the quick and tore his skin; and when he could finick no further with his fingers, he fouled his mouth with liquor and dredged up the guilt 'til it was a knife in his gut, wrenching upwards and slitting his throat with a grief and hate for himself he could not bear. For he was such a man – such a fake God, to have taken a girl's love for her father and used it to his own means, tricked her with M-O-R-P-H-I-N-3, consciously done so – and she was so pale under the tube lighting. So still. He feared her dead. Dead so young and he so wretched. He'd enchanted her, bewitched her – lied to her. Weaved stories as liars do. Used her. Captivated her with light tricks and mirror illusions, spun a fantasy that could not be. He wants to tell her the exact number of stars there are in the sky, the place the moon goes to when the sun rises, every love story, all the choruses of the ditties the songbirds trill by the lake; grant her more than a dreamer's heart – brilliant, stronger. It is simple, really. Now that he knows her again, a second time. He wants to give her the ending she needs – as he had taken from her. He wants to give her everything. He's a thirty-six-year-old man now, she's eighteen; it isn't right. \"Nineteen, I turned last month.\" She speaks. \"I do not look it, no? …What was your question?\" Roy has a spoon fiddled 'round in his fingers, and his mouth forms a sheepish curve; he doesn't have the heart to distance himself from the problem, nor the courage to go towards it. He doesn't think he'd survive. \"You said your birthday is in December.\" \"I was telling a lie,\" she says tartly, reluctantly ashamed, yet righteous in her decision. \"You would have gotten me things if I had said it was a month ago. And since it has now passed, you cannot get me things, which is good.\" \"Who says?\" Roy is decidedly wounded; she reads him so well, too well. With all her lashed glances that she has always used to carefully gauge his mood. \"Who says I can't?\" \"It will not be...sporting...of you to try.\" Alexandria takes a stab at the ice-cream they share between them, her elbows on the table. He frowns, mouth twitching downwards and his eyes serious. \"That's very cruel.\" \"I do not want you to be feeling obligated, Roy,\" she says quietly; and her eyes meet his, soft and meaningful. \"There is nothing for me to forgive you for. You must not be feeling so hurt and sorry; is no need for you to carry something silly to the grave.\" \"...You're very cruel, telling me that.\" He plucks up her untouched glass of wine, breaks the stare and downs it. Suddenly bitter. \"I don't forgive myself.\" \"Please do.\" Alexandria has such patient wise eyes; they are all for him, sometimes he feels it is so. \"You don't have to feel like you have to see me all the time – \" \"But I want to see you.\" He pushes forward forcefully, enough to give them both pause. But he recovers himself quickly, \"Alexandria, I want to see you.\" \"Oh, Roy,\" she says and pats the hand he's got clenched white on the table. \"Or...do I bother you?\" He has trouble with the words, they come out hard in his throat, and he's very suddenly afraid. \"No; how can you be bother me?\" She smiles. \"You're the Masked Bandit, the Scourge of the South East – \" \"You're different, though you're still the same; you're too grown up to be my Bandit Daughter anymore.\" The words are said tightly. \"Yet, not grown up at all. I don't know, Alexandria, if I can be a Bandit anymore – \" \"Roy – \" \"You're very strong; you're grown up, and you're free. You don't need a hero, and I was never a good hero.\" He is suddenly, breathlessly telling her all of this, tiptoeing 'round the edges of a dangerous cliff. Oh, he can't torment himself anymore. \"I'm not your father, Alexandria.\" \"...What are you saying?\" \"I can't look at you as my daughter anymore.\" He admits it, and cannot look her in the eye. What he sees there might break him, and he can't stop halfway. \"Please.\" When I fall asleep, you have to go. …Why? I don't want you to see me like this... Later that night, he drops her off on her doorstep. The light above the fire escape flickers on, and an old woman's face flits suspiciously behind the blinds. His jaw is so tense; neither of them has said a word the whole way back. Alexandria stops before she goes in, turns around to look at him. Her eyes are troubled; worried, even. The streetlights dye her dress lemon-yellow and paint shadows in the hollows of her throat; her hair is clipped up. She looks so beautiful, so never his. She worries her lips, says, \"Roy.\" He closes his eyes; he cannot beg. He shouldn't. \"Roy.\" A feather-light touch along the corner of his jaw; her hand, fleeting yet meaningful, reminds him of a mother's, or a wife's. Except, she looks at him with a stranger's clarity, does not fog up her perception of him; will always see him as what she has chosen, and so clearly. \"Roy, don't be so angry.\" Her words are caught in her throat. He doesn't want to make her cry. \"I'm not angry.\" His mouth sneaks up a little, in a smile that would make him sick should he see it in the mirror. \"Just needy. I feel like the child.\" \"That's because you're forever young,\" she answers with a soft smile, her fingers tender. \"Alright.\" \"You're alchemy,\" he breathes. Damn the woman behind the blinds; he does not care if she hears, she could never understand. \"Alexandria, you only make me seem so.\" \"I love you, Roy,\" she says shamelessly, and remorselessly. His mind attempts to reason before his heart can run away with his wits, because she cannot mean it the way he'd love to hear it. Her eyes are sincere, the colour of jewels. \"So, don't disappear.\" \"I won't,\" he says quietly when she does not pull her hand away. The feel of her fingers is a soothing balm, yet a maddening flame that makes him so thirsty… She smooths her touch down the line of his jaw as she retreats, tucks her hands back under her arms. \"Promise? And don't cross your fingers.\" \"I won't.\" He smiles a little wryly at the familiar, previously-traversed part of the script; raises his palms up, fingers spread apart as far as they can go. A man with his hands in the air, his weapons dropped; oh, there is no surrender more painful and divine. None sweeter. \"See?\" The problem was not his back. Not his spine. Not his legs. Do you know? It's a band of five heroes, each pursuing his own brilliant death – and a princess, pink and poisonous as oleander blossoms. The problem is his heart, broken. And eyes, lost. Caught in a fever dream. Wakes up underwater, a mouthful of blood. Open your eyes, Roy. Makes the mistake of taking her out to a bar, once. He isn't sure, exactly, what he was thinking; she can tell from the flit of his lashes against his eyes, the tenseness of his brows just moments from springing into an expression of regret. Roy pats out a cigarette from the pack in his palm, lights it – the bar top gleams like good mahogany and she has her hair down, has a soda bottle with a straw in it. Of all the things to drink. \"Prohibition ended only a few years ago,\" he tells her, by way of a remark. All the time he smokes, he looks at her like he has waited for her to tell him not to, like most women do. Or instead, excitedly, ask for a joint to try. \"And, for some of us, it never started.\" \"You mean, you, Roy?\" She tilts her head, eyes bright through a haze of smoke. Of course, she knew that he smoked, that he drank; every man had his weaknesses, what others would name vices. But Roy had no vices, not to Alexandria; he could be silly, prone to occasional, accidental bouts of selfishness, guilt – but he had this way of blinking and smiling, a twitch of his lips, as if he could be both befuddled and enchanted, in one sentence. It would matter little for him to stop smoking. When she leant her head on his arm on evenings in parks, the crisp sleeve of his shirt was always white and clean, with that tinge of smoke from rolled-up cigarettes; warm as burning oak – real. \"Of course.\" His mouth twitched, then; a quick half-smile that soon chipped into a grin. \"Soda pop and I don't agree well enough to get along for long enough.\" There's the sheen on his skin under the hot lights of the bar; it's warm, and makes the skin where the first two buttons of his shirt are undone gleam. Tanned hands propped on the table, body angled towards her. Tequila. Liquid courage, perhaps. Or just pain-killing solution. She can only be there to stop him from falling too hard to the poison. \"How does it feel – not to, anymore, do stunts?\" \"Not like much. Not too different.\" \"Will you…miss it?\" His feet are folded at the ankles. And he tugs at his collar around his throat, the heat of a Californian night pressing down on them. She watches him down a shot like flavoured tap-water. It doesn't quench him, by the way he looks at the bottom of the glass, frowns ever so slightly. \"...Much?\" \"No.\" She can't tell if he's lying. It's not easy to read him, now that she isn't five anymore. And she's dabbed peach perfume behind her ears, and her dress is pretty. She isn't five anymore. And then, at her doorstep, he is pressing a brown bag into her hands. It's heavy. He is soberly drunk. Yet, he had driven so meticulously down the road... But his eyes are feverish; he's very tall. And soda wasn't enough to make her remember why she let him this close to the building anyway; the aunt upstairs might have nagged her for it. But her doorstep is little more than a fire escape; and she has surpassed all curfews, anyway. \"What – \" \"This is it. It's all of it,\" he says, his offering grasped in her hands. \"Take it. I didn't think I would finish it; it's taken me weeks to fix it. It's been in the back of my drawer for years. I never forgot, Alexandria; and then I saw you again, and how could I leave it alone?\" She schools herself; she must not lecture him. She should be sensitive to him, considering he has admitted that he will never do another stunt, that he has quit; he had said not many stuntmen still found work, as old as he was. \"Thank you.\" \"Read it; all of it.\" Promise? \"I will.\" Yes. And then comes that exhilarating moment, where her heart stops, and they realize how close they are standing. The silence isn't a silence, because each star seems to be whispering over the hush of his breathing and her held breath. Roy is so tall. His head is dipped a little. Blood seems to pool right beneath the surface of her skin, like a warm summer blush, or the heart-thundering flush of a four-aces hand at a card table. Strange. She can now see that his eyes are just a little bit more gray than blue or green. And that sweet citrus tinge of tequila-with-lime that hovers over him, and did not quench him, does nothing to douse the fever. That he might kiss her seems...seems – \"Come in?\" She startles them both into reason. Roy starts back, and opens his mouth; hesitates, closes it. Then – \"Your relative…?\" Aunt? Damn her to hell. \"It is fine. You're drunk.\" \"Not really.\" And they both know it. \"Tipsy; a little buzzed. Not drunk, you soda pop girl.\" He snatches up tendrils of her hair, fingers only a little clumsy, proves his coordination; he could rest his chin on her head, should he ever wish it. \"Alexandria, as wise as you are… No. I won't come in. I don't know why you asked.\" She doesn't know, either. He withdraws, blinks at her, and then gives a slow smile – she isn't cruel enough to kiss him on the cheek like she would usually; it has come too naturally to her not to hurt him in some measure. Alexandria closes herself in behind the door. Tears the parcel open before she can hear the start of the engine, and the lulling hum of wheels leaving, rolling out onto the road. Alright, close your eyes. What do you see? Nothing. Rub them. … Can you see the stars? Every page is crisp as cinders against her skin, inked words painted in the blood of the soul, the pen used to write them the mended pieces of a sparrow's snapped ribcage. Effortlessly painstaking. Roy. There are the five men again, who were really all parts of Roy to begin with – Otta Benga, Darwin, Luigi, the Indian, the Mystic…and the Bandit; even Odious. An adventure, a burning legend…and a love story – not romantic so much as it was written from the sunset across a desert sky. Words speaking in tongues the writers confined to the margins of a book could not imagine capturing. The whirling gold of a whirring lasso that spins sharp heat into the air, cutting into the moon when it is flung up. Her Roy, her Bandit; the tale of her carrying-away, the sheets of paper woven from carried-away childhood-spirit dust. Like a wet breath, the rain falls. She reads of the bright sheen of grass blades that touch passing shins, skim the skin of naked legs dancing. A blue city, like a brother, or mirror, of the sky; blocks of Mediterranean buildings, cities in the heart of oceans, domes that strike up the land. The slow twist of trout in a river, silver-to-black. The mist of blood flung up above a battlefield, heavily soft like legends and grief. Nymphs caught in the nude. Leviathan wrestling warriors. The rustle of ashes as a breeze carries away a temple, black gleaming dust on the chiseled chests of cinder gladiators. Ladies with scented handkerchiefs held to their mouths in a scorching heat, fanning their necks with their intricately painted fingers. Such life…such life. Roy, who looked at her every day like she mattered. So much. As if her essence could not be dissolved, made soluble in the drab, commonplace mediocrity of the city. Who, as if she were the sun, could not face her. Who truly thought his heart like a stone; like the tiny bright sphere of yellow bleaching the sky, so scorching hot to the touch – yet Alexandria holds her fingers up and spreads them wide against it. In these small hands, she could engulf him. But never extinguish him. His thick dancing brows, tilted like cruising wings. He; who downed tequila like he could not be quenched, yet he must try. Who talks to her – her Bandit, her childhood wanderlust – lost in Alexandria. Who, with arms flung upwards, she turns around and around in the long hover of trees, dancing in gasping gestures, into the grassy scorching dry tongue of their heroic imaginings, mocked by the undulations of an orange peel around her knife and his fingers, prying open, spraying citrus sweet. Roy, who saw her as so brilliant, who painted her in words that not even Mona Lisa would dare call flattery, of such adoring, sweetly suffering adulation and worship; and love, and love, and love. And she can only open her arms to him, because she never let go of him – her hero, her father-friend-lover-hero, conqueror. Who is so, so Roy. Who, eyes quavering, brave – crashes through all walls and finally kisses her the day after, enough to steal the wisps of her breath away. Mouth hot, like a man in a desert, sand-caked and skin broken. Kissing her like she was a well to drink and drink from, and he was so very dry. Her storyteller; her lie-spinning, truthfully confused, yet sure, yet lost, can't-swim-lost-without-her Roy. \"Good Bandits,\" he tells her, like she understands – and she does, \"are thick as thieves; so never let me leave.\" She hooks their pinkies, like they are kids with nickels and marbles. And seals the blood oath, steps her feet on his feet, raises herself on tiptoe on the leather of his shoes. Collects on that height difference. Closes the distance. We're a strange pair, aren't we?

I am posting as complete, for now. We're a strange pair, aren't we? He sits with her still, long after the words between them have faded into silence. Alexandria lies on the brink of slumber, eyelids shuttering though she tries, stubborn and obstinate as always, to pop them open again, not wanting to dream. Roy's long-fingered hand brushes along her forehead and down over her eyes, holding them gently closed, as his mother used to do when he was a little boy afraid to fall asleep because of the dark; he can feel the silk-soft lashes fluttering against his palm. Butterfly wings… \"Sleep,\" he tells her softly, \"you need to rest now,\" and it's true; she's very tired. Voice dropping to a whisper, he adds: \"Count the stars for me.\" He sits without a twitch, not moving a muscle, like a statue until he hears her breaths grow deep and slow. Her eyes stay shut once he removes his hand – oh-so-carefully – and only now does Roy allow himself to caress the little face, feeling the soft, baby-fat roundness of her cheek under his fingertips, trust himself to press a tender kiss to the bandaged brow (as she has kissed him, so many times) before he bows his back and turns his face into Alexandria's pillow, rests his head beside hers, and gives himself up to the quaking, shuddering sobs that carry grief and guilt-ridden relief in equal measure until fatigue overcomes him, as a little hand curls into the thick locks of his unkempt hair. That is how the hospital staff find them, much later, when the moon has crept high into the sky in the small hours of the night. They rouse him, spine cricked and aching, to wheel him back to his own room and bed – but Alexandria frowns, whimpering in her sleep; and Roy's wet, exhausted eyes are bright with need, vulnerable and inexorable, as he throws himself on the orderlies' pity and begs, \"Let me stay with her. Please.\" It is the one hope he has, that, if they can refuse a desperate cripple, no one can be so cruel as to deny an injured five-year-old… In the end, it is a simple enough affair to draw back the covers and pick up a still-drowsing child. It is not so simple to get an immensely tall, lanky paraplegic onto the rickety, narrow cot – but Roy's arms are strong even if his legs are dead and useless, and he needs little help lifting himself from the chair to the worn mattress. He settles quickly and easily enough, and Alexandria is laid down in his arms. Roy cradles her close, despite his touch remaining as delicate as if he holds a porcelain figurine. The little girl snuggles into him, soft and warm and precious , snuffling nose buried amid the buttons of his nightshirt over his chest, head resting on his heart, her one good arm reached up to hook about the crook of his neck. She sighs, though yet asleep, and murmurs, safe and contented: \"Papa…\" And Roy's gentle grip tightens securely as he presses his lips to the crown of her head, as his tears roll down into the dark waves of her hair: Sleep now, my little Bandit daughter.

The one that came with the fall, that earth-shattering, life-changing fall. The dizzy sickness in the pit of his stomach as if the world had suddenly spun on its axis, turning in somersaults around him. Except of course that the first time he'd felt it, he'd known with an almost light hearted certainty it was him doing all the moving. Now he's not so sure. He looks at her, this broken, bandaged doll of a body lying there on the hospital bed. Really looks at her, taking in the blank expression that a part of him fears will never smile again regardless of what the doctors say. He worries about her, this child, this daughter he's acquired somewhere along the line. He'd never meant... Never expected her to mean anything to him. She was meant to be a means to an end. His end, to be precise. He wonders if he will ever forget the feeling of that fall. It was supposed to end that day, one way or the other (and deep down in the darkness of his soul, he'd hoped for the other). Some crazy notion of get the girl or die trying. The end. It hadn't ended, of course. He didn't remember the landing. Didn't remember the hospital either to begin with, but that was to be expected. A bad knock on the head, they'd said. Bruising on the spine. Things would come back to him in time, they'd said. Things had. Like the ache in his heart, and the sudden shock of realising that he used to be able to feel his toes. He can taste guilt mixed in with his self-pity, leaving a bitterness like orange peel in the back of his throat that no amount of alcohol seems able to remove. Still, he figures it's probably worth another go. He tips a little more down his neck. It used to be rage he'd try to wash away. Rage at losing yet more to a world that only ever seemed to take and never give. It had burned out in the end, leaving him with nothing but placid despair. He'd been trapped, alone with his memories until one day the most unlikely of angels had stormed into the ward. \"Alexandria the Great\" he'd called her, spinning her a story like a spider's web. The plan had come to him with frightening ease, born as it was out of desperation. He'd beguiled her with visions of the beautiful Hell inside his head, where he could play the undeserving hero. He'd worked low down in the movie business; he knew how to spin a yarn. A thread of a narrative from here and there mixed in with the recollections that were still coming back to him then. In this fantasy, he could make things happen how he wanted. But she hadn't been happy with that. She'd taken the story and changed it, made it something new. Her influence had always been benign, trying to smooth out the rough edges he'd created only to cut himself upon. And somewhere along the way, he'd started to enjoy making this world for her. Even so, he'd still wanted to die. Still does, truth be told, although his resolve is faltering just a little. Looking at her pallid face, he wracks his brain for what to say if, when, she wakes. How to make her understand. Could she? Wasn't sure. She's so damn young. She might never know why he almost killed her. Why he'd been afraid, so God damn afraid of remaining alive that he hadn't even considered what their false friendship might cost her. He's a coward, a bandit who almost stole her life out of the selfish desire to end his own. Watching her sleep now (please God, let it just be sleep) he's aware that he should feel something. More than the twisting, turning, tumbling sensation that's never really gone away. More than the self-pity that's become his constant companion. More even than the sense of responsibility that's settled over him since hearing the news of her accident. He's not responsible for her. Couldn't be, shouldn't be. Just look at where being responsible for himself had gotten him. (He glances down to the unfamiliar wheelchair. Still getting used to it. Doesn't much like it). Regardless of all these facts, he feels responsible. He is the bandit, and she his daughter. A good little girl. She deserves better. And then he looks up, catching the sight of his unexpected daughter's wide brown eyes. He can sense the question in that stare. Knows what she'll ask of him before she's even said a word. It's as if the great glass dam holding back his emotions shatters under her gaze, and fresh tears find their way onto his cheeks. He'd never intended it to have an ending. But after all, it's his story. He knows how it must end. ","Summary":" He can still remember that feeling.

It's just a \"small\" one shot about Roy Walker and an OC named Annie. It's mostly just fluff, but I'm just trying to get back into the swing of things . Los Angeles. 1928. I was 23 years old when I met Roy Walker. He was quiet, as usual; he wouldn't even look at me. My hands moved with a hurried nervousness, stripping the hospital cot of its' off white cotton sheets. He just sat there in his chair, staring out the window at the sisters and medical personnel strolling aimlessly about the courtyard on the other side of his rehabilitative prison. He'd blink occasionally, slowly, and I watched him out of the corner of my eye, constantly wondering what he was thinking. He always held a look of resigned sadness, and I began to wonder if there had ever been a time when he hadn't looked so hopeless. The other nurses had gossiped frequently, and it had been hard to avoid the buzz about the broken hearted Hollywood star in the third block. He was certainly broken, and in every sense of the word. It had become an unspoken agreement between us; we wouldn't speak when I came to administer his medication and swap his dirty sheets for fresh ones every three days. He would silently wait for me to wheel his chair up to the side of the bed, never once looking me in the eye. Whether it was out of resentment or embarrassment, I'd never know. I suppose his wounded pride left him ashamed of his situation; he never spoke of it – at least not to me. But I had heard the whispers of all those unfortunate events that had landed him in my care and so, I respected his silence. Quickly tucking the edges of the bottom sheet beneath the cot's mattress, I let my mind wander momentarily to nothing in particular; I needed something to think on in the deafening silence, if only to keep me sane. I had no words of comfort to offer the shattered man in the chair so I found no use in wasting his time with pointless banter. He was deep in thought, and I wasn't about to be the one to disturb him. \" How are you?\" His question had startled me as much as the very sound of his voice, my hands giving quick pause as I had gone to spread the other sheet across the cot. At first I hadn't been entirely sure that he was the one who had spoken, but we were the only two in the room. I had long imagined what his voice sounded like. Would it be deep and smoky, or would it be light and full of youth? And while I admit there was a soothing deepness to his voice, it held no light, not even a trace of happiness. It was a question asked simply to break the silence, not out of true curiosity for my well-being. \" I'm well.\" I mentally cringed at the quietness and shortness of my response, still not chancing a glance in his direction as I continued smoothing out the sheets. The crisp white cotton felt cool beneath my fingers, offering a small amount of calm as anxiousness surged through me. I had never done well in conversing with men; I was always so shy and never able to find the right words, only ever finding them once the conversation had long since ended. \" That's good to hear,\" he said, his voice trailing off into nowhere. There were a few moments of silence after that before he let out a heavy, tired sigh. \"I'm doing pretty well myself, 'case you were wondering.\" I could feel the heat rise in my cheeks, embarrassed with myself for not having had the momentary courtesy to ask about him in return. Instead of stumbling for a response that would surely do nothing to ease the now awkward silence between us, I turned to him, immediately catching my gaze in his own. He had eyes that could calm a storm; soft green eyes that stared back at me with a mix of amusement and an incurable sadness. Overall, there was no doubt he was an attractive man, and had the circumstances been different, I would have hoped beyond anything that he would ask to take me dancing. But we were in a hospital, and the heavy reality that we would never dance together hit me even harder as my eyes allowed themselves a quick glance at his chair. No, there would be no dancing with Mr. Roy Walker. \" You look at my chair an awful lot.\" His voice broke through my daytime dreaming, causing my cheeks to flush an even deeper scarlet as I quickly turned back to the bed sheets, smoothing out imaginary creases. \" I'm sorry,\" I quickly apologized, my voice barely above a whisper. I couldn't bear to look at him out of pure shame and embarrassment. Not only had I failed to ask him how he was out of returned politeness, but he had caught me staring at his chair. I silently chided my foolish behavior, quickly rushing through redressing the cot before I had the opportunity to offend him even more so than I already had. \" Don't apologize; I'm just happy to have caught your attention.\" I didn't have to look at him to see the teasing smile on his face, for I could hear it in his voice. \" I'm your nurse, Mr. Walker-\" \" Roy,\" he interrupted. I turned towards him then, a slight smile on my lips as I watched his eyes become light, a small smile of his own gracing usually sullen face. \" I'm your nurse, Roy. And as long as you are my patient, you will always have my attention.\" His face fell only slightly at my words; his eyes leaving mine to look at the now neatly made cot. He looked at the cot for a few moments, silent as the grave, before his eyes came back to me and a small smile reached the corners of his lips once more, his eyes shining with a certain gleam that I could not name. \" Well since I have your attention, can I tell you a story?\" \" What kind of story?\" I asked, straightening the contents of the small white table at the side of his cot. His morning coffee had been untouched, and the bible that had been left for his use had clearly never been opened. \" An epic story,\" he replied with a bright smile. \" Would this be the same epic story you told Alexandria by any chance?\" I had been told the tales of the masked bandit and his fellow outlaws. It had been a wondrous story, of bravery and beautiful imaginative places and people, all retold from memory by the beautiful little girl with an imagination greater than any I had ever known. Her fall had been unfortunate, and there had been a moment where all of the doctors and nurses had held their breath, her survival unsure. It was then that Mr. Walker had come clean, confessing what he had done; the stories he had told simply to coax her into helping him end it all. But with Alexandria's recovery, it was not simply her own life that had been saved, but Roy's as well. \" Nah,\" he replied with a smirk, leaning his head back against his chair. \"That's Alexandria's story - just for her,\" he teased quietly, his eyes watching me as I made to walk around the side of the cot, standing near the end of the bed. I smiled at him, a small smirk of my own reaching my lips, \"She's a lucky girl to have her own fairytale.\" \" I can give you a fairytale too, you know,\" he said, the smile still plastered to his face as his voice adopted a tone of mild excitement and just a little bit of joy. He seemed to be anxious to share a story with me, and whilst I would have listened out of pure politeness, a part of me wanted to listen out of true curiosity. Without another moment of silence passing between us, he motioned for me to sit down on the cot, facing him as he still sat in his chair. I couldn't help but notice how the crisp whiteness of my nurses gown nearly matched the fresh sheets on the cot. I folded my hands politely in my lap as I waited for him to begin. \" Close your eyes,\" he commanded gently. \" What?\" I looked at him, an incredulous look marring my face. \" Close your eyes,\" he repeated, laughing lightly at my clear confusion, \"it doesn't work unless you close your eyes.\" Sighing in defeat, I shot him a disbelieving look before letting my eyes slip closed, replacing everything with darkness. \" Now what?\" \" Can you see the stars?\" The sound of his deep, soothing voice amidst the darkness nearly made me shiver with a small amount of thrill and excitement. I shook my head, \" No. I can't see anything.\" \" Rub your eyes.\" I reluctantly did as he told me to, rubbing my eyes lightly and carefully, in order to avoid smearing my lightly applied mascara and eyeliner. Sure enough, against the black backdrop of my closed eyes, small white stars began to appear in fast swirls of light and beauty. I smiled instantly at this childs-play trick and I listened carefully as Roy let out a small, quiet laugh at my reaction. \" How many stars do you see?\" his voice asked from the darkness. \" Too many to count.\" \" They're beautiful, aren't they?\" he asked. I nodded, \"Yes.\" \" It was a starry night,\" he started, and I could tell by the sudden drop in his voice, soft and soothing but deep as the ocean, that my fairytale had begun… Over the course of the following six months, I had taken an extreme liking to the fairytale that Roy Walker had made just for me. It was a beautiful tale he had spun, of love and betrayal. The story was of a man, tall and strong; a soldier, who guarded the Queen with his very life, cutting down all those who made attempts upon her life. He had sworn his allegiance to her, promising no matter what, that he would always ensure her happiness. The Queen however, even in all of her innocent beauty, betrayed her faithful guard, for she had found another to protect her; stronger and taller than he. He was replaced, and by order of the Queen, cast out from the palace, into the desert. But in a final attempt to win back the heart of his Queen, he fell upon his own sword in her name. But still, the Queen preferred her new guard, and sent him away, bloody and defeated. For months he had struggled in the desert, surviving only due to the kindness of the occasional merchants that would pass him along their journeys. The offered him money, and the opportunity to travel with them to their destinations, but he refused. For without the love of his Queen, he had lost his will to survive. He had given up. But one day, as he stumbled across the desert in a haze of confusion and helplessness, he came upon a castle in the middle of a lake. He shouted, crying out for any inside who could hear him. Luckily, a knight, dressed in all white, with a kind face, who brandished no weapon, found him lying just outside of the castle gates. The kind knight pulled him inside the castle where he was tended to and looked after by a beautiful maiden, dressed in all white, who seemed to glow like the very stars in the night sky. She was the most beautiful maiden he had ever seen, yet she did not smile, nor did she frown. She simply watched over him, tending to his needs in silence. He did not speak, fearful that she would not care to hear the sorrows of a banished guard who had so foolishly fallen upon his own sword. Yet she continued to care for him, as the damage done had been great, and would take many days and nights to heal. But still, he did not speak to her. Nor did she speak to him. Until one day, he could no longer bear her beauty or kindness in silence. He had to hear her voice. She had been shy, timid and quiet. For days he continued to attempt to coax words from her lips, eventually succeeding to a point where there was no silence left between them. And he discovered the very depths of her soul, her history, and above all else, the longing in her heart. His love for her grew so great that within mere days he had planned to swear his allegiance to her, to protect her from the dangers of the world that surrounded them and ensure her happiness, as he once had for the Queen who betrayed him. But he was worried… The sun was scorching that day, with no wind to cause even the slightest relief of a cool summer breeze. I had been beyond grateful for my month's leave from work. It was simply too hot to bear the heavy white nurses gown and stockings. I opted instead for a beautiful lavender sun dress that seemed to hug my warm body in all the proper places without causing me to overheat. Los Angeles was almost unbearable in the summertime, and I suddenly wished that I was back in Seattle, visiting my Aunt Margaret and Uncle Sal where it had been nearly ten degrees cooler. But while I missed Seattle, I couldn't deny that my heart belonged in Los Angeles. I smiled fondly at the sisters and varied medical personnel that recognized me with a simple nod of their heads. It felt good to be back, seeing familiar faces again, even though it had only been a month since I had left. Unfortunately, I had left with my fairytale unfinished. Roy, in the few weeks leading up to my departure, had become so tired from all of his medications and therapy. I had continued to visit him however, instead opting to tell him my own stories. They weren't as interesting or fantastically beautiful as his stories were, but I believe they gave him comfort in times where he felt tired and most undoubtedly alone. Alexandria had long since left the hospital and been reunited with her family, leaving Roy without her heartwarming visits. I could tell he missed her. With an extra spring in my step, I quickly made my way to block three, where I knew Roy would be waiting for me in his cot, no doubt with the window open and an electrical fan on his bedside table, pointed directly towards his face. He hated the heat, and was constantly attempting to rid himself of his shirt. He claimed it was due to the heat. But I found that even in the cool spring nights, he was removing the article, though reportedly he didn't display this same behavior when any other doctors or nurses were present. Our friendship had grown and flourished in those six months since I had become his head nurse. He had told me stories of his whirlwind stunts and spectacular pictures he had been part of. He spoke with such passion and enthusiasm, that I found it difficult to focus on menial tasks such as changing cot sheets. He kept me distracted, but delightedly so. And I certainly didn't mind. Eventually our friendship had taken a turn, blossoming into feelings of mutual adoration and care. He was still a patient, however, and all romantic feelings had to be expressed through spoken word, instead of the lover's language of a kiss or soft caress. But we were okay with this, and were able to express our heart through the stories we told each other. My story had somehow fallen to the wayside. And when questioned as to whether my fairytale had a happy ending or not, he would simply shrug, a quick flash of sadness striking across his face before changing the subject. I had stopped asking after the second shrug. Walking through the entrance of the third block, I could immediately feel a change. Something was off, but I couldn't place it. I continued through the second entrance, into the room where I was sure to find my beloved story-teller. My heart quickened at the anxiousness that surged through me. His face, his laughter, his constantly disheveled hair; these were all the things I had missed during my stay in Seattle, and I could feel myself beginning to form a dire need to see him once more. But as I entered the room, filled with empty cots, I froze in the doorway as my eyes fell upon the empty cot at the back right side of the room. The sheets were perfectly tucked, there was no cup of morning coffee sitting on the small bedside table, but most importantly, there was no Roy. My heart instantly began to sink to the bottom of my stomach. I was too late. I had expected Roy to make a full recovery; we all had. But with how tired and worn he had been after his therapy sessions, I hadn't been so sure that it would be a mere few months before he was able to walk again. And I certainly hadn't expected such a drastic change to happen during the one month I was away. At the same time however, my heart soared. There was nothing Roy had wanted more desperately than to be able to walk again. The empty cot at the back of the room was enough to tell me that his wish had come true. And in that aspect, I was happy for him. With a resigned sigh I gave one last look towards the cot where my own fairytale had begun, and a small smile graced my lips. \" Looking for something?\" I froze. The voice was unmistakable; soft and smooth, but as deep as the ocean. I couldn't help the enormous grin that nearly burst onto my face. \" Why yes actually, I'm looking for-\" As I turned around, all words fell silent on my tongue. Time itself seemed to stand still when I saw him. There he was, in all of his glory, standing proud, and tall, and strong, like the man he once was all those months ago, long before he and I had ever met. The sickeningly white hospital clothes had been discarded and forgotten, replaced with a beautifully tailored suit black suit, a matching waistcoat underneath. His hair, usually standing up and sticking out in all different directions, had been combed back neatly, held in place by a small amount of product. His face was cleanly shaven and the light scent of his aftershave nearly sent my head spinning. He smelled divine; no longer did he smell of medicine and antiseptic. It was his face though, that I found to hold the most astonishing change. All traces of sadness and despair, of anger and hurt, were gone from his beautiful eyes. His lips curled upwards at the corner, and I could tell he was truly as happy to see me as I was to see him. But to see him standing, and to see him walk through the doorway, towards me; there is no happiness that could ever compare to that. The sound of his footsteps brought tears to my eyes, for it was a sound I had only dreamt about, as small a thing as it was to dream. But it was his arms, strong and steady as they wrapped around me, that sent tears streaming down my face in steady waterfalls of joy. For what seemed like hours we simply stood there in each others' embrace, happy enough to say we were able to do so. His finger eventually found its' way beneath my chin, lifting my head so my eyes were fixed on his before his lips descended onto mine. There was no fiery passion in our first kiss; for it was not fiery passion which we felt. No, this was a kiss of celebration, a kiss of pure happiness, a kiss of gratefulness and thankfulness; thankful that we were able to stand and kiss at all. As we both pulled away his face broke into a wide grin, teeth and all, as he took my hands in his own. \" Close your eyes,\" he commanded softly. \" I don't want to hear any stories right now, I just want to –\" \" Please, just this one last time,\" he pleaded, his grip on my hands tightening just slightly in encouragement. His eyes found mine, pleading and beautiful; there was no way I could resist. So I closed my eyes as he asked me to, though his hands never let go of mine. \" Can you see the stars?\" I squeezed my eyes shut as tightly as possible, willing the bright swirls and speckles to appear against the backdrop of black. Sure enough they came swirling into the darkness like fireworks in the nights' sky. \" Yes,\" I whispered quietly. I felt a shift in the way he held my hands, but he insisted I keep my eyes closed, and focused on the stars. I did as he told me whilst relishing in the warm feel of his large hands over mine. \" I once told you I could give you a fairytale,\" his voice was deep, calm, and yet there was a hint of anxiousness to it. I could tell this story would differ from all of its' predecessors. \"Do you remember your fairytale? Where we left off?\" \" He was planning to pledge his allegiance to the white maiden, I believe,\" I answered, not entirely sure as to what was happening. \"Right. He knew for a very long time that he wanted to protect her and make sure she was happy. But he was scared. He was so scared, Annie. He didn't know if he could trust another after the Queen betrayed him. And it took a long time for him to realize that the white maiden could never be as heartless as the Queen, because she..she had found him when he was nothing, Annie. She picked him up, and she made him strong again.\" By now I could hear the quivering and shaking in his voice and I could almost hear the tears streaming down his face. \"So he asked her. He asked her if she would let him love her and protect her even though he had been so weak. He had been so close to giving up, so many times. But it was because he didn't have her, Annie. He hadn't ever had someone love him the way she did, and he knew he could never go back to being that sad, poor excuse of a man he was before her.\" His hands were shaking as they held my own; my heart was nearly pounding out of my chest. \" So now it's your turn, Annie,\" he said, his voice still shaking as he momentarily let go of my left hand, \"you have to tell me how your fairytale ends.\" Opening my eyes, time stood still once more. Roy was before me, his left hand holding my right one as he kneel, down on one knee. In his right hand he held a small red velvet box and inside was a small diamond ring. My heart had officially stopped. \" I told you I could give you a fairytale,\" he began once more, \"the question is, are you going to let me?\" There was silence as I gaze down at him and the beautiful diamond ring in his hand. For so many months, I had listened to his stories; stories that had always had spectacular endings, whether they be happy, or silly, or even romantic. He had told me once that he would never tell me a tragedy, he would never tell me stories of death, or despair, or loneliness. He told me his life was already so full of those kinds of stories and that he couldn't bear to hear them anymore. He wanted to tell stories about knights in shining armor, and damsels in distress. He wanted to tell stories about true love and the meaning of trust and loyalty; two things he had for so long been without. He needed me, just as much as I needed him. He had become this fantastical, beautiful person in my life, who could brighten my day with a smile, or make me laugh when all I wanted to do was jump from the highest cliff, down into the most jagged rocks. He was a source of strength, even during his times of greatest weakness. But above all else… \" Yes\" … he was my fairytale. ","Summary":" I just wrote this in the last three hours.

( Engine driver – The Decemberists) Apuró el whisky doble empinando el codo de una sola vez. Se había hecho inmune al ardor intenso del brebaje en el esófago tras años de afición. Lo cual era genial para evitar los espasmos a su garganta pero no tanto para su bolsillo o su hígado. Recordó con amargura los tiempos en los que su único vicio era la excitación palpitante de la adrenalina en las venas cuando saltaba al vacío, desde un vehículo en marcha, con el sudor arrancado de la piel por los potentes focos del estudio y el olor de la pólvora de fogueo salpimentando el aire y fundiéndose con el caro perfume de Ella que aún impregnaba su camisa. Los restos del hielo lucían patéticos a la deriva en el fondo del vaso. Como esos recuerdos en su cabeza. Alzó la mano al camarero que rodaba los ojos detrás de la barra para pedir la siguiente en una larga concatenación de catas de alcohol. Después de todo, la noche era joven y su objetivo era sobrevivir a ella. No recordar. El joven se acercó a la mesa con paso cansino. Soltó la botella medio vacía con un golpe seco en la encimera y la cuenta en una bandeja de plata. − Es hora del cierre, señor. Ni siquiera se esforzaba ya en aparentar servilismo o eficiencia ante aquel viejo cliente. De soslayo le había visto dedicarle miradas de desprecio, típicas de aquél que no entiende cómo malgasta sus noches, su dinero y su vida un gran hombre, una figura popular, un supuesto caballero que podría tener todo lo deseable, mientras él servía copa tras copa, sintiéndose sucio por tener que trabajar en aquel oficio mal remunerado aunque hubiera dejado de ser clandestino hacía bastantes años. Chasqueando la lengua contra el paladar y riendo sin humor, dio ligeramente marcha atrás a su silla de ruedas para tener campo de maniobra y extraer de su cartera lo que debía y una más que generosa propina. El chico lo dejó a solas con su miseria y sin un cortés gracias . Y es que así había acabado y se había alzado Roy Walker. Paradojas puñeteras del destino, la de su apellido, porque jamás se había recuperado de la caída. No se refería a la física desde el caballo que le postró en aquel artefacto del diablo del que dependía absolutamente para todo, sino al hecho de que tantos años atrás hubiera sucumbido a la ficción confeccionada por una criatura que él había creído perfecta y pura, profunda y eternamente enamorada de él. Una mujer que le tuvo comiendo de la palma de su mano, danzando según movía los hilos que tiraban de su corazón, y que, cuando más la necesitó, tras cerciorarse de que jamás podría conducirla del brazo a lo largo de una alfombra roja que jamás pisaría, le abandonó sin derramar una lágrima. Aquello le despojó de alma. Es lo único que pudo justificar el evento posterior, terrible, traumático, imperdonable que le marcaría de por vida, que había determinado en quién se había convertido y quién era en ese momento. Lo único para lo que su invalidez había sido rentable (y por partida doble) había sido el librarse de conocer de primera mano los horrores de la guerra que había estallado al otro lado del Atlántico y que tenía a la patria en tensión. Mientras sus soldados morían o desaparecían en combate, él entretenía a sus madres, esposas e hijos con fantasías azucaradas. Con sus historias explotaba la habilidad que tan bien había desarrollado. Engañaba y mentía impunemente, con el aplauso del público. Pintaba ilusiones, filtrando cualquier aspecto negativo de la realidad y facturando mundos y seres hermosos, melódicos, con sonrisas postizas imposibles de borrar. Eso chocaba con la realidad de su persona cuando alguien descubría su identidad. Lejos de ser el vivaracho y bonachón ex especialista de cine reciclado en guionista que sus admiradores esperaban conocer, les recibía un hombre solitario, apagado, sombrío, cínico y descaradamente cruel. Ajeno a la hipocresía zalamera del negocio del espectáculo. Era un resentido y, encorvado por su pasado, cargaba con el peso de una culpa más grande que su orgullo y que la modesta fortuna que había amasado en Broadway y en Hollywood. Ése era el precio a pagar. Mas lo merecía. Creía firmemente que su estilo de vida ni siquiera era suficiente penitencia, a pesar de haberse recluido en un purgatorio en vida, consagrado a su máquina de escribir y olvidar. No es que no hubiera pensado mil y un veces maneras para acabar con aquel suplicio. Pastillas y alcohol, monóxido de carbono, su cuchilla de afeitar… Se permitía el lujo de fantasear con su muerte, con los festejos que montarían autores de productoras rivales para conmemorar su final. El escándalo en la prensa, donde su foto ocuparía las páginas de sociedad y el suplemento cultural. Flashes y parafernalia. Las declaraciones imaginarias de su chófer, de su rehabilitador, de la enfermera que paraba para asegurarse que todo iba bien una vez por semana. El llanto histérico de su manager. El testimonio de una avejentada gloria del cine mudo que enseñaría a algún periodista sensacionalista las fotos de su compromiso, el camafeo con forma de corazón que él le regalara en la pedida de mano y confesaría estar muy conmocionada por su dolorosa pérdida… con el único objetivo de intentar relanzar su acabada carrera artística. Como bien sabía hacer, el cinematógrafo en su cabeza realizaba estrambóticas variaciones del mismo tema, añadiendo escenas o creándolas alternativas según su estado de ánimo más o menos depresivo. Sin embargo… del pensamiento al hecho había un trecho insalvable para él. Era consciente de que aquélla liberación le era inaccesible, vetados por una mirada grande, límpida y clara que le escudriñaba desde detrás de los párpados cuando cerraba los ojos. Hastiado, retiró la botella unos centímetros del vaso y se pasó la mano por el cabello que había ido perdiendo gomina a lo largo del día, dispuesto a calarse el sombrero y regresar a casa. El sonido de una campanilla y un taconeo le sacó de la habitual espiral de desesperación. El motor de la inspiración se puso en marcha en su cabeza, recreando el contexto por el cual una mujer se dirigiría a un lugar como ese a esas horas tan altas de la noche. Y sola, aparentemente. Maquinaba la narración para describir la suavidad de la nota interrogante en la voz femenina que se dirigía al camarero o la pausada elegancia de aquellos pasos, cuando un carraspeo tímido quiso llamar su atención a sus espaldas. En los segundos que tardó en maniobrar con la silla, desviando sus ruedas para hacer frente a aquella extraña visitante, la imaginó rubia. Con el cabello recogido bajo un sombrero, manos enguantadas, pestañas altivas y párpados que caerían lánguidamente. Luciría un vestido rojo vino entallado, más oscuro bajo la luz tenue de las lámparas y por las sombras del abrigo gris pizarra con que se protegería del frío, a juego con el carmín que besaría sus labios de Ava Gardner en un mohín coqueto e irresistible para cualquier hombre decente sobre dos piernas. Pero no para él. De todas maneras, la imagen real distaba radicalmente de la mujer magnética, imponente, que había compuesto entre retazos de otras que conocía. Su intuición le había jugado una mala pasada y su curiosidad, animal poderoso, fue mayor que su decoro al repasar la presencia de aquella enigmática mujer de arriba abajo. Para empezar era morena. El cabello le caía en bucles cuidados sobre los hombros y las cejas perfiladas, también oscuras, enmarcaban unos ojos grandes, expresivos, de un color indeterminado desde la posición en la que se encontraba. Aunque vestida à la mode , la muchacha (porque después de todo no podía tener más de veintipocos años) carecía de porte distinguido y llevaba un bolso demasiado grande para que congeniara con su indumentaria azul marino. Tampoco aparentaba pocos escrúpulos o aires ladinos y taimados. Modesta y sencilla era la mejor etiqueta que podía haberle puesto pero definitivamente sabía realzar el encanto de su sonrisa franca con maquillaje de colores suaves. Emitía una luz especial que le incomodaba especialmente y le hizo rectificar la columna vertebral sobre la silla. La joven debió de notarlo. − Oh, perdone. −extendió la mano con toda naturalidad, sin que bochornosos colores subieran a sus mejillas. − Soy una gran admiradora de su trabajo y estaba de paso en la ciudad. Tenía mucho interés por verle en persona, señor Walker. − enarcó la ceja, sin creer una palabra. ¿Hacían ahora ronda las fulanas por bares respetables para fichar clientela?− Estuve esperándole durante horas en su casa por si regresaba, pero finalmente su sirviente me informó de que solía usted salir y volver de madrugada. − Quiso protestar, indignado, pero le interrumpió con unos reflejos pasmosos. − No se moleste con él, de verdad, sé ser persuasiva. − al menos tuvo la decencia de bajar la mirada. − He ido peregrinando por todos los establecimientos que suele frecuentar hasta dar con usted. − ¿Ah, sí? − alzó el mentón, observándola con fría suspicacia. − Todo un honor, disculpe que no me levante para recibirla como merece. − escupió. Aunque ni siquiera elevó el tono de voz, detrás de ella, se fijó en que el camarero apretaba la mandíbula y buscaba el teléfono con la mirada, sin separarse del mango del cepillo de barrer, como si pensara que iba a necesitar utilizarlo como arma arrojadiza de un momento a otro. Ella percibió el mudo intercambio y se volvió hacia el camarero, asintiendo con la cabeza con lo que supuso sería una sonrisa tranquilizadora. Le irritó su presunción de aquella admiradora estrafalaria. − ¿Qué demonios quiere de mí? O una pregunta mejor. ¿Quién es usted y por qué irrumpe en mi vida privada como una vulgar cazadora de escándalos? ¿Es uno de los anzuelos que lanza el listo de Joe Montana del LA Variety ? Por un instante pareció no turbada o amedrentada, lo cual le hubiera aportado una enorme satisfacción, sino decepcionada. Como si un mito se hubiera desmoronado a sus pies, haciendo de sus ilusiones miles de esquirlas de cristal que se le enterraran bajo la piel. Y en los ojos, a juzgar por el deslustrado vidrioso de muñeca que habían adquirido por la película de lágrima que nadaba sobre ellos. − No soy nadie. Bueno, su…su trabajo me ha inspirado y mi sueño es convertirme en actriz. − murmuró con una humildad que no correspondía a las aspirantes a estrella que había conocido en su vida. − Pues si ha venido aquí pensando que seducir a un viejo lisiado con zalamerías es la solución a sus problemas y el salto automático al estrellato, lamento desengañarla tan bruscamente. Para eso tendrá que cepillarse a un productor…yo sólo escribo sus frases. La muchacha abrió los ojos como platos, momentáneamente, y su boca de piñón formó una \"o\" perfecta. Ya la había escandalizado y de un momento a otro saldría despavorida del bar, con lo que él podría largarse definitivamente con su hombría reparada. En lugar de eso, la desconocida se repuso y comenzó a reír, sacudiendo la cabeza como quien reprende a un niño que ha hecho una trastada que en el fondo es divertida. − No era mi intención en absoluto ponerle en semejante compromiso o aprieto, señor Walker. Roy. − corrigió, con picardía y sin permiso. Estaba adentrándose en arenas movedizas. − Aunque haya reparado en que no está casado − señaló su mano libre de alianzas y mostró la de ella, compuesta y sin compromiso − y seamos los dos adultos responsables. − Rebuscó nerviosamente en el bolso y extrajo un paquete meticulosamente envuelto en papel de regalo de colores vivos. Se inclinó hacia él y, ofuscado porque aquella señorita tuviera que verse obligada a rebajarse a su altura para poder conversar sin ser escuchados, miró hacia otro lado. − Necesitaba verle personalmente para darle las gracias. De corazón. − Tomó sus manos entre las suyas, pálidas, frágiles y temblorosas, con los dedos encallecidos que contrastaban con la suavidad de todo lo que era y hacía. Fue tan súbito y espontáneo que ni siquiera le dejó protestar. Estaban tan cerca que su perfume lo inundó todo, embriagándole, hasta que poco a poco se vio obligado a enfocar su rostro. No hacía falta ser autor, fotógrafo o pintor para reparar en el aura de ternura que derramaba en su indigna dirección. Por favor. Con lo descortés que había sido, ¿como podía estar aquella jovencita cándida agradeciéndole nada? − Porque su obra me ha inspirado y me ayudó cuando más sola estaba y más lo necesitaba. − Una lágrima rota cayó sobre el paquete. − Por favor, le pido que acepte esto y mis disculpas por haber sido tan honesta y directa. Sé que esto es muy confuso, que puedo parecer una jovenzuela aprovechada que busca fortuna, pero no es así, y lo entenderá cuando sea el momento. El susurro esperanzado le taladró el corazón. Quiso haber conservado parte de su humanidad para tener el coraje suficiente para enjugar la humedad que pendía de sus pestañas y dejaba regueros oscuros en su descenso. No pedía sino fe, que confiara en ella cuando hacía casi dos décadas que no confiaba en nadie. En silencio, se tragó su racionalismo y apretó los labios para no regurgitarlo. Accedió con un suspiro agotado, soltando las manos frías de la joven para sostener lo que le entregaba. Ella ahogó una risa de incredulidad, alivio y gratitud. Sobrepasando los límites sociales de la familiaridad entre desconocidos, le rodeó con los brazos y enterró el rostro en el cuello de su maltrecha camisa. Sobrecogido, perplejo y sin más libertad de movimiento, sus brazos cobraron vida propia y devolvieron el abrazo levemente. El de acunar a la joven extravagante era un sentimiento familiar, reconfortante y a la vez agridulce, porque aquél había sido el contacto humano más estrecho que había mantenido con nadie en demasiado tiempo. Sin contar las visitas arregladas, pagadas e infructuosas de algunas mujeres en desesperados intentos de aplacar la soledad y la necesidad. Era una situación surrealista que le aterraba. La tibieza del llanto apagado de aquella criatura tan vulnerable y desenvuelta a la vez, con rasgos de niña y ojos de anciana, rasgaba las cuerdas desafinadas por falta de uso en su alma. Igual que lo hacía la concatenación de murmullos ininteligibles en un idioma que no comprendía - ya prahshoy tibya, ya prahshoy tibya- , cosquilleándole el lóbulo de la oreja y la piel desnuda del cuello. Cuando consiguió dominarse y comprobó que había dejado de llorar fue él quien la rescató del mullido apoyo sobre su hombro. La tomó por la barbilla y la miró a los ojos con determinación. − ¿Quién eres? − preguntó, en una exhalación. Necesitaba saberlo. Era cuanto menos justo cuando se aferraba a él casi tanto como él lo había hecho, sin preverlo ni pretenderlo, a ella. La chica cerró los ojos y se esforzó en vano por deshacer el nudo que la impedían emitir ningún sonido y la habían dejado boqueando como un pez fuera del agua. En un movimiento impredecible le besó. Le besó con una bendición en la comisura de los labios, provocando en él una mezcla de frustración, enojo y la necesidad de devolverle el beso con propiedad para que aquellos labios turgentes pudieran probar de los suyos agrietados la acritud de la vida. El rostro terso y acalorado de la muchacha se deslizó de entre sus dedos como la cinta de raso de los cabellos de una niña que juega despreocupada. Y fue como caer de nuevo. La sensación de vértigo en la que el Universo da vueltas, centrifugando emociones, mientras te preparas para el doloroso choque contra el vacío de la pérdida. Pero esta vez tenía un ancla. Miró el objeto que yacía en su regazo. Y todo vino de golpe en su cabeza. Reconoció su perfume a naranjas mientras la puerta del bar se cerraba. Cuando cesó el taconeo y sólo pudo escuchar la sangre latiendo en sus sienes. No hubiera hecho falta abrir el paquete e identificar la inocencia en la forma de la miniatura de un elefante de madera o la cara de la niña rusa sonriente en las fotografías familiares amarilleadas por el tiempo. El nombre cayó de sus labios como una plegaria. − Alexandria… Lo pongo al final por no spoilear ;) Fandom: The Fall (El sueño de Alexandria). Epílogo. Disclaimer: Ojalá fueran míos…pero me temo que no. Son de Tarsem Singh, Dan Gilroy y Niko Soultanakis. Aunque por mí, como si Lee Pace y Catinca Untaru dominaran el mundo (L) Sería un mundo bello xD Género: Drama. Angst. ¿Romance? Hurt/Comfort of sorts. Spoilers: pozíp N/A: Aunque esta película es una obra de arte (literalmente el arte sale de la pantalla en cada fotograma, desde la interpretación a la escenografía, el vestuario o la fotografía), el final es tan abiertamente ambiguo que me dejó con un sabor de boca agridulce. La idea que comenta la pequeña Alexandria, tan contenta (mi pobre niñita) porque podía ver a Roy haciendo stunts en muchísimas películas y eso la reconfortaba porque significaba que estaba bien y haciendo lo que le gustaba… sonaba demasiado cándida para ser real. Mi interpretación no es que Roy se suicidara… pero es una posibilidad. Lo más probable es que se quedara tocado de por vida, entre unas cosas y otras. Ya cuando la vi por primera vez sentí la necesidad (pero hasta ahora el bulli-bulli en el LJ no me había espoleado a hacerlo) de escribir un epílogo más esperanzador y optimista. El perdón de una Alexandria que realmente llega a comprender el alcance de lo que hizo su amigo-figura paterna Roy, y una vía de expiación para él.

J'ai donc laissé cette histoire au fond d'un dossier de mon pc pendant presque 2 ans avant de m'y remettre. The Fall est un film fantastique, onirique et magique. Et cet OS parvient à rendre entièrement compte non seulement de la réalisation de Tarsem Singh mais aussi de l'écriture et des dialogues du film. Je suis vraiment tombée amoureuse de cette histoire et j'espère avoir réussi, enfin, à traduire fidèlement chaque mot, chaque tournure de phrase et chaque métaphore de l'auteur. Je vous invite donc, si vous appréciez cet OS, à féliciter l'auteur (que vous pouvez retrouver sur et sur AO3) pour son travail magistral ! . . Bonne lecture ! . . . LIKE ORANGES . . . C'est magnifique. Je le garderais avec moi pour toujours. Ses mais sont disgracieuses, ses doigts calleux, il y a une ligne creusée dans son auriculaire droit, plus pâle que le reste de la main, brillant d'un éclat presque argenté, témoin de cette fois-là où il avait essayé de stopper une balle lors d'un tournage. Marqués de petites coupures qui semblent avoir été causées par du papier, de balafres longilignes, disséminées sur toute sa peau – et, aussi cliché que ça puisse être, il y a une histoire pour chacune de ces cicatrices, bien qu'il ne soucie pas de s'en souvenir et de les raconter, il le sait, chaque ecchymose, chaque blessure est une brique qu'il a mérité, elles l'ont construit, toujours plus haut. Il ne serait pas tombé aussi bas, autrement. Elle retourne sa main dans les siennes – petites paumes et doigts sales d'enfants – il a du mal à croire qu'elles sont faites pour ramasser des oranges. Mais Alexandria est une sorte d'adulte, piégée dans le corps d'une enfant, s'émerveillant toujours du monde autour d'elle, apprenant petit à petit à être prudente – mais jamais avec lui. Son autre bras, dans une pose désinvolte, est tenu dans un plâtre rigide et il a lui-même un certain nombre de vieilles blessures dans ce genre, mais sur cette petite fille ça a l'air … et bien, étrange , elle marche avec raideur, comme une poupée sans articulation à cause de ce stupide plâtre et il aurait pu en rire, s'il n'était pas dans sa position. Roy … Roy ne sent plus ses jambes. Et l'enfant-adulte lui fait entièrement confiance, elle tapote sa peau juste sous son œil, où se trouve la trace argentée d'une vieille cicatrice, elle l'embrasse sur la joue, c'est humide et collant. Elle dit : « Roy, Roy – l'histoire. » comme si elle savait, d'une façon ou d'une autre, qu'elle maintient entre ses mains tous les morceaux de son âme, comme les vieux morceaux de marbres d'une tombe suffocants derrière les vitres des musées. Des morceaux d'une épave. Un cascadeur dépassé. L'histoire est la même, les petits détails, oubliés. Plus tard, personne ne voit son sourire confus dans le cinéma sombre (c'est en fait juste une petite salle de l'hôpital, mais Alexandria aime le son de ce mot, cinéma ) lorsqu'ils coupent au montage sa cascade, sa chute spectaculaire et sans fin. Il a l'impression de voir son âme être effacée, volée. Mais Roy se rend compte que ça ne doit pas lui manquer, parce que c'est ainsi que l'on se construit à Hollywood, prêts à être déçus parce qu'à Hollywood on vous embrasse et on vous embrase et Alexandria est tellement entre ses mains, et ses yeux sont un miroitement marron de moka et elle veut entendre son histoire, elle veut entendre l'histoire de Roy . Donc il lui raconte. Il y a des hommes comme Sinclair, les cheveux gominés et aussi noirs que de la cire pour chaussure, avec leurs belles allures de méditerranéen, avec leurs sourires et leurs tenues qui peuvent tuer celui qui y pense trop longtemps. Les hommes comme Sinclair qui arrivent toujours à avoir la fille, qui se tiennent face au soleil et qui se déplacent comme de l'or liquide, sont les héros. Les tactiques pour éviter les balles, les cascades pour sauter des trains sont le travail de leurs Ombres. Pour le cinéma, Roy était l'Ombre de Sinclair. Il savait qu'il était meilleur que lui, parce qu'il était celui qui créait le courage et la bravoure du héros. Et même si Roy était remplaçable, personne se pensait aux cascades comme il le faisait, personne n'envisageait de sauter d'un pont vers la mort, et ça, c'était complètement Roy. Pendant un instant, la chute … la chute de Roy ressemble à la mort, ressemble à Dieu. Comme s'il n'allait jamais atterrir. Mais il l'a fait. Il a atterri là où se trouvait Alexandria, là où elle avait survécu à sa toute première chute. Avec ses gribouillages voltigeant à travers la fenêtre ouverte, diamants coupés dans le papier, à l'orthographe si consternant qu'il avait sursauté – et elle était entrée, capricieuse et enfantine, l'arrachant de ses mains avant de quitter la pièce, et il l'avait appelé, il lui avait demandé de revenir, parce que … il ne savait pas pourquoi. Il voulait savoir pourquoi elle portait ce plâtre, puisqu'il n'était plus le seul à avoir l'air stupide, et elle lui avait dit. « Je suis tombée. » Je suis tombée. Et Roy lui a raconté une histoire parce qu'il … la chute, la réception était ratée , et il voulait partir, il voulait dormir et ne jamais se réveiller. Comme dans les histoires. Et Alexandria, avec ses dents du bonheur, et ses petites tresses, le bruit de ses chaussures contre le sol lorsqu'elle venait le voir. Roy - c'était brillant et Roy était de nouveau un Dieu, mais jouant cette fois avec quelque chose de bien plus précieux. Se faufilant à travers une maison de cartes instable, parce qu'Alexandria était une enfant-adulte mais au fond, elle restait une enfant, et elle lui amenait des oranges et renversait son café, et il avait retiré la peau du fruit et ressentit cette adulation réservée, et il avait comprit qu'il était en train de préparer sa propre chute, sa dernière chute cette fois-ci et Alexandria allait l'aider. Il la laisserait derrière lui. Mais la vie n'était pas juste, et la mort encore moins. Les pilules étaient un placebo pour lui, le retournement de situation dans l'histoire, sa propre liberté qui lui avait été volée. Roy avait pour habitude d'effectuer ses cascades selon ses propres conditions, à présent il ne pouvait même pas mourir selon ses propres conditions, il ne pouvait plus marcher, il ne pouvait pas garder la fille, assise dans la voiture tamponnant doucement d'un mouchoir ses larmes de crocodile, faisant attention de ne pas effacer de sa bouche son rouge à lèvres et Sinclair fumait ses cigarettes en souriant et son manager ne cessait de lui rappeler qu'il connaissait les risques du métier afin qu'il ne les poursuive pas en justice, parce que … parce que ... Alexandria chute à nouveau. Elle s'ouvre le crâne en deux et il peut sentir ses côtes se serrer autour de son cœur, de sa gorge, et il n'est qu'un dieu véreux parce qu' il aurait du savoir . Il ne méritait pas d'être un Dieu, pas même dans ses propres histoires, il avait croisé les doigts sur ses propres paroles, il était le bandit masqué, parce qu'il était un lâche qui croyait aux histoires stupides et édulcorées et qui n'était pas fichu de voir le sol se rapprocher de lui tant qu'il ne l'atteignait pas en se tuant sur le coup. Et Alexandria était une enfant-adulte et il était un faux dieu, et elle ne voulait pas l'écouter lorsqu'il lui avait dit ne me crois pas, je suis un menteur, un baratineur, un sale type et un idiot – ne me crois pas, je me suis joué de toi et elle secoue la tête, le visage rougi et barbouillé, les yeux embués de sommeil et d'un chagrin qu'elle ressent sans pouvoir le comprendre, parce que pourquoi, Roy ? Pourquoi fais-tu ça ? Ne les tue pas, pourquoi tout le monde meurt, pourquoi tu les tue tous ? « Ne meurs pas Roy – non. Mais je ne veux pas que tu meurs. Ne le tue pas, laisse-le vivre Roy. Laisse le vivre. » Mais je dois le faire, c'est l'unique vérité. Ils t'embrassent et t'embrasent. T'embrassent et t'embrasent, et tu ne mérites rien de tout ça, tu te mens à toi-même, les choses comme la vertu, l'honneur et la camaraderie n'existent pas dans ce monde , c'était peut-être le cas au début mais pas à la fin et il va finir l'histoire, comme il le souhaitait. « Tu voulait l'entendre, » la tequila alourdit sa langue, et son cœur se serre, suffocant l'échec. Parce qu'il est tombé . « Laisse-moi la finir. C'est mon histoire. » « Non. » Ses larmes, elles sont pour toi, pour Roy. Et - - Et oh , tu es un idiot , quelque part un homme est en train de se noyer dans une piscine à peine plus profonde qu'une mare. Le Gouverneur Odius le retient sous l'eau mais ce n'est pas ça, l'homme ne sent plus ses jambes, il n'a pas envie de les sentir, il ne se relève pas. Et le Mystique vomit des oiseaux, ils s'échappent de sa bouche gémissante, rouge et sans dent comme celle d'un vieil homme-enfant, tel Samson, ses cheveux sont arrachés de sa tête, il est jeté avec force contre les arbres qui aime tant, becs piquant sa gorge, volant depuis le fond de ses entrailles, des plumes et de la poussière et de la vieille, vieille nostalgie. Les grandes mains sombres de l'Indien s'accrochent fermement au tissu de son turban, ses yeux brillants en amande jamais silencieux, il y a un poignard coincé entre ses dents et il te regarde droit dans les yeux avant de couper la corde qui le retient. Oh ! Un homme géant et brillant sous le soleil, le sol chantant sous le poids de sa marche sûre, il sauve une fille, et chaque flèche est comme le claquement d'un fouet sur son dos, et il chancelle et il se relève et il s'effondre et il tombe en arrière, mort et enfin libre. Darwin dans son ridicule manteau de fourrure, rêveur comme un enfant, tenant un petit chimpanzé contre son cœur, berçant son propre génie sans savoir quel nom lui donner. Et un rire, une vague de feux d'artifices illuminant le zénith de fumée noire, et les fondations même de la cité s'écroulent – Luigi, Luigi, Luigi. Deux jambes et à présent en d'innombrables morceaux, fumant et brûlant comme de la viande. Mort. Et d'autres étaient ici, et là. Il y a un cercle de papier fin dans sa main, elle en mange un morceau, insolente et naïve. Elle lui tend, à hauteur de son visage. Roy lui demande, se demande, « Tu essayes de me sauver ? » , elle ne comprend pas, ses sourcils se froncent parce que qui s'intéresse à ce que ce bout de papier représente, mange-le vite, je te l'ai offert après tout. « Tu essayes de sauver mon âme ? » demande-t-il à la recherche du subterfuge, du jeu d'ombres et de lumières, de la trappe cachée. Alexandria ne comprend pas. « Tu essayes de sauver- » elle pleure, et là réside toute sa conviction, elle l'aurait attrapé par sa chemise si elle avait pu. « Non. C'est mon histoire aussi. » Alexandria. Il y a des hommes comme Sinclair. Et pour un moment unique mais extraordinaire, Roy était une Ombre. Roy était Dieu . Et les gens créaient leurs propres histoires, les gens décidaient de leur destin. Quand Roy amena cette enfant dans l'histoire, elle devint sa fille, petite et dépendante de lui, et quand il accepta cela, il s'affubla d'un devoir de responsabilité, de ce qu'il pourrait arriver, il avait fait de cette histoire la leur. Il n'y avait plus rien à faire. Sinclair était un connard, il avait la fille, il avait le charme, il avait la gloire. Mais il était seulement le méchant de l'histoire parce que Roy l'avait dépeint comme tel, Roy l'avait laissé être son nemesis, Roy était celui qui se torturait tout seul, parce que personne d'autre n'autorisait Sinclair à le faire sentir comme un homme invisible et délavé, si ce n'était Roy lui même. Alors quand il est sortit de cet hôpital qui avait l'air d'un couvent, encore instable sur ses jambes, c'est parce qu'il allait mieux. Et parce qu'il le voulait. Alexandria avait guérit elle aussi, et elle était probablement retournée à ce qu'elle faisait avant, ramasser des oranges. Et Roy devait suivre son exemple et survivre. Il guérissait, pas complètement, pas suffisamment pour retourner à ses cascades folles comme avant, mais suffisamment pour continuer, il avait toujours ce côté casse-cou qui ne le quittait pas. Robin, unijambiste et pirate avec son petit chien vient à l'hôpital pour récupérer Roy. C'est un homme bon et il est … il est l'ami de Roy. Il travaille toujours pour le cinéma, cascadeur pour gags et trucs dans ce genre-là, et c'est admirable qu'un homme de son âge puisse encore trouver du travail dans le milieu. Roy est chagriné, dépassé et il y a encore quelques films pour lesquels l'homme travaille actuellement, il est ami avec le réalisateur et Robin dit qu'il veut bien laisser Roy venir sur le plateau, si Roy veut venir jeter un œil, pour se remettre dans le bain et Roy Walker apprécie le geste, ça ressemble à une poignée de main chaleureuse entre deux soldats quand Robin lui prend la main. Cela envoie un fourmillement lent à travers ses os, quelque chose qui ressemble à du soulagement. Il retourne sur les tournages, titubant sur ses béquilles et remarquant le progrès, souriant un peu plus, et peut-être même de manière un peu folle. Cela aide la guérison, il veut aller mieux, il fait des remarques ici et là et essaye d'aider à sa façon. Il n'est pas mort. Pas encore. Il se prépare juste pour le prochain saut, le prochain bond spectaculaire. Il lui reste un peu d'argent de côté et durant les premiers mois de récupération après l'hôpital, il se trouve des chambres de motel pas chères, ou, quand sa fierté est suffisamment prête à cela, il reste chez Robin. Il y a des hauts et des bas. Ici et là. Il ne sait pas si il se sent un peu plus libre, ou si le devrait. Sa cage, autour de lui, a des roues en bas, des bras écartés, elle bouge avec lui. Et il est piégé entre les doigts d'une petite fille, calée contre son épaule, l'embrassant. Je suis encore tombée Je sais. Tout le monde sait. Tu es célèbre. Ils sont en colère ? Ouais. Mais pas après toi. « Roy, » Robin est assis sous le porche, il est trois heures du matin et Roy avance en trébuchant à travers le jardin, deux boutons de sa chemise manquant. Au son de la voix du vieil homme il s'arrête comme une biche prise dans les phares d'une voiture, il est pris rentrant à la maison tardivement comme un adolescent essayant de revenir furtivement chez lui. Soûl comme un vrai ivrogne, transpirant la tequila. Il ne sait pas pourquoi il boit. Les vieilles habitudes ont la vie dure. « Assieds-toi. » Robin tapote le banc de bois à côté de lui, mécontent et le regard clair. Roy retire sa veste, puis ses chaussures et il est un homme émergeant de l'océan, instable sur ses pieds alors qu'il marche sur des rivages oscillant. Il s'écrase à côté du pirate, l'esprit embué, manquant les détails et ne pensant à rien jusqu'à ce qu'il entende le son de … ? Des petites pastilles dans une bouteille, claquant contre les parois de verre lorsqu'elles sont secouées. Ses … pilules. « Tu ne peux plus les prendre. » murmure Robin une fois qu'il est sûr que la bouteille dans sa main a toute l'attention du jeune homme. « Tu dois arrêter. » Roy gratte la barbe sur sa joue, passe ses doigts sur sa bouche et laisse échapper un ricanement grinçant. C'est un rire triste, dépressif. « Où as-tu ... » « C'est ma maison, j'ai tous les droits de vérifier. Et je suis inquiet pour toi. » « Tu ne devrais pas, » dit Roy presque joyeusement, et il sait qu'il n'est pas très convainquant. « J'en prends juste assez pour les douleurs occasionnelles, juste de temps en temps, je ne te mentirais pas, Robin – c'est juste de temps en temps, tous les trente-six du mois, je te le jure. » Robin soupire, comme un vieux saule craque sous la brise, plié par le poids de l'âge. « C'est mauvais pour toi – tu te souviens, tu as presque … elle aurait pu mourir … pour toi et ces stupides pilules. » « Comment pourrais-je oublier ? » « Ce sont mes conditions Roy. » « Pour rester chez toi? » « Non, » Le vieil homme est aussi sobre que Roy est soûl. « Pour rester ton ami. » Il prend son menton dans ses mains tremblantes et s'agite, en penchant en avant puis en arrière, soûl et pensif. « C'est du sacré chantage, j'aurais dû m'en douter, vous les italiens- » « Roy, mes parents sont irlandais, tu le sais – » « Non, toi tu la fermes, je suis le meneur, je suis le héros – c'est … c'est mon talon d'Achille, j'en ai besoin , tu le sais Luigi ? » Il lève les yeux, suppliant et pas tout à fait docilement « J'en ai besoin, ce n'est pas si dur en ce moment. Je ne suis pas malade. Mais parfois … parfois je ne peux pas dormir , et j'en ai besoin pour dormir- » Robin est vieillissant et malade et fatigué de ses délires mais il secoue la tête.« Tu n'en as pas besoin, Roy. Tu essayes seulement de t'en convaincre. » Il reste silencieux, les doigts engourdis, se pinçant le nez, les cheveux dans les yeux. Il y a une agitation en lui, elle grossit, grandit. « J'ai jamais pu oublié, tu le sais, pas vrai ? Pourquoi j'ai fait tout ça, elle m'écoutait … je l'ai utilisée ... » « Ça a bien fini, donc c'est bon. » « Non, ça n'a pas bien fini, » dit-il brusquement et fort, comme les personnes soûles le font souvent. Sa voix monte dans les aigus, elle est empreinte d'amertume. « Ça n'a pas bien fini. Peut-être pour moi, j'apprends bien – mais pas elle, elle recommence à ramasser des oranges, notre situation n'a pas changé, je ne la reverrai jamais. Je lui ai raconté, Robin, elle est tellement bête , mais moi aussi, pour lui avoir raconté tout ça, et elle pour avoir cru à tout ça parce que je lui ai dit … il n'y a pas de fin heureuse, pas avec moi. » « Roy- » « Et c'est le problème. Je ne peux pas dormir tant que je penserais à ça, que rien n'a changé – et j'y pense tout le temps, son sourire d'enfant et ses gloussements dans mes rêves, cinq ans et tellement, tellement plus maline que moi … parfois dans mes rêves, elle ramasse à nouveau ses oranges et elle chute encore se brisant autre chose que le bras, parfois ce sont ses jambes, sa colonne vertébrale … Je l'ai laissé vivre à travers les histoires, et je pense que j'ai bien fait de lui raconter, les enfants aiment les histoires, tu sais ? Je veux redevenir un bandit, kidnapper la princesse, vivre dans une merveilleuse fantaisie, mais je ne peux pas faire ça – je ne peux pas vouloir ça, parce que quelque part, elle est peut-être en train d'en souffrir, parce que je lui ai fait croire que le monde est un putain d'endroit fantastique, alors que c'est juste un gros bordel, je ne suis plus un héros maintenant, je ne le mérite pas, je ne suis pas un héros et je ne peux pas me duper et continuer de croire à ça. À chaque fois que je ferme les yeux je pense à des déserts, à des éléphants et des danseurs tourbillonnants … alors, j'ai besoin de sommeil, j'ai besoin d'un sommeil sans rêves, donc j'ai besoin de ces pilules ... » Il délire, il délire comme un homme fou, submergé par ses émotions. « Elle aurait moins d'estime pour moi si elle savait ? Je ne dépends pas des pilules, j'en ai juste besoin de temps en temps, pour ne pas rêver, juste un peu, tu sais ce que c'est ... » Il y a quelque chose à propos de Roy que personne ne sait hormis Robin, mais tout le monde se méprend sur le sujet. Robin sait que Roy n'a jamais combattu durant la guerre, pas comme les américains en 1917, ses frères, les hommes de son pays percutant de plein fouet les soldats allemands sur la Marne quand leur grand pays a rejoint l'offensive. Robin ne pouvait pas non plus, parce qu'il n'a qu'une jambe. Mais Roy était en train de tourner ses films et n'est jamais venu, il voulait y aller – Oh seigneur , il avait voulu y être. Mais Roy était effrayé par la mort , il l'avait dit un soir à Robin, soûl jusqu'aux os, comme il l'était aujourd'hui. Au moins durant ses cascades il avait son mot à dire, il savait quand ça arrivait, il pouvait prévoir la réception à mi-chemin de la chute – mais sur le champ de bataille … les balles fusent, et ça te surprend toujours, la mort, c'est soudain, et pas dans tes termes. C'est ce qui fait de lui un lâche, un lâche qui croise les doigts lorsqu'il fait des promesses. Il n'a jamais vraiment oublié, mais il le regrette, la guerre aurait été grandiose d'une certaine façon, mais il ne pouvait pas mourir de cette façon, il ne pouvait pas servir son pays et Robin le voyait pour cela comme un jeunot . « Donc tu ne veux pas avancer, parce que tu supposes qu'elle ne peut pas le faire ? » il demande, exaspéré et en colère. « Qu'est-ce que c'est que cette idée stupide ? » « Je ne sais pas, » Il frotte ses yeux humides. « Je ne sais pas. » « Roy, tu es déjà son héros – tu as fait une promesse à cette fillette, je ne suis pas trop sûr de comprendre les éléphants et tout ce charabia, mais il semble que tu ais une obligation envers cet enfant. Un héros ? Alors tu dois montrer le fichu exemple, même si tu ne la revois jamais. Et alors quoi ? Tu vois ça ? » Il fait bringuebaler la morphine durement et vicieusement, collant la bouteille contre le tempe de Roy, comme le canon d'un flingue. « Ça sera la fin de toi. Tu fais trop de suppositions sur des choses qui ne sont pas ici, tu n'as pas le contrôle sur ce qu'il peut lui arriver, très bien . Mais tu as le contrôle sur ta propre vie, donc prends les choses en main bon sang – sois le héros, suis ton histoire et ne te contente pas de belles paroles avant de t'enfuir. Ne sois pas un lâche, tu n'as plus aucune excuse à présent . Et si tu aimais suffisamment cette petite fille, tu saurais qu'elle avait espoir en toi – alors arrête de raconter ce charabia, et lève-toi, relève-toi et sois un homme ! » « … je ne peux pas juste changer comme ça, vieillard. » « Tu ne peux pas savoir, » siffle Robin. « Si tu n'essayes même pas. » A la fin, il aligne toutes ses bouteilles de pilules sur l'évier de la salle de bain, il remonte ses manches et il ne peut pas le faire … il ne peut juste pas le faire. Il a besoin et demande finalement l'aide de Robin pour laisser le courant d'eau des toilettes toutes les emporter, le vieil homme le dirige comme si Roy était un enfant empoté à nouveau, comme s'il l'aidait à traverser la rue, ensemble ils vident toutes les bouteilles dans la cuvette de porcelaine. Puis le vieil homme lui donne un paquet de cigarettes et lui dit qu'il lui apprendra comment fumer, que les choses ne seront plus pareil à présent. Qu'elles s'amélioreront. C'est pas encore l'heure de dormir. Pas l'heure de dormir. Réveille-toi. Réveille-toi, c'est pas encore l'heure de dormir. Réveille-toi. Ne fais pas semblant de dormir. Réveille-toi. C'est pas encore l'heure de dormir, Roy ! Il ne peut pas gagner. Parce que notre bandit masqué est un lâche. Ouais. Il n'a jamais prêté serment, c'est un mensonge. C'est un menteur et un lâche. Tu mens. Non. Il a croisé les doigts. Il doit mourir. Je te crois pas. Il est mourant. Ne le tue pas. Il ne lui reste plus rien. Sa fille. Il n'était pas son père non plus. Elle l'aime. Elle survivra. C'est une grande fille. Je ne veux pas que tu meurs. Roy. Ne le tue pas. Laisse-le vivre. Laisse-le vivre. Ne le tue pas. Roy ? Promis ? Et ne croise pas les doigts. Promis. Montre-moi tes mains ? . . . . Tu vois ? Un soir, il prend sa vieille voiture cabossée et descend le boulevard sans la capote. 1933, la prohibition est finie. Les étoiles brillent dans le ciel, comme de la joaillerie, ses jambes fonctionnent très bien, elles amènent l'automobile plus loin que les pavés dorés et les lettres de lumières, par delà les noms et les pancartes jusqu'à un vieux bar-grill, perdu au milieu de nul part. Il porte des lunettes de soleil, perchées dans ses cheveux brossés par le vent, il retire sa veste et marche vers le bar, ressentant la liberté de ses propres pas, il peut le faire. La chaleur brûlante de la Californie embrase son cou alors qu'il commande un verre, il y a de la sueur sur son front, de la condensation coule doucement de son verre, humidifiant le dessous de verre. Il y a une femme, assise au bar – jeune, portant une robe à pois et des lèvres rouges. Sa peau est foncée, et elle lui parle doucement, dans un anglais parfait. Il est charmé et frustré par les birbes de souvenirs qu'il place en elle, il essaye et trouve toutes les petites nuances. Comme un jeu. Son accent ressemble vaguement à un accent du Sud, et son anglais est très bon, familier cependant – elle n'est pas plus âgée que seize ans, battant des cils aux garçons à côté du jukebox. A cet âge, on est audacieux et un peu idiot, engageant peut-être. Elle recherche un homme qui puisse lui payer un verre comme la plupart des filles, il ne lui demande pas ce qu'elle fait ici par une soirée de semaine, sa peau est tannée et ses yeux sont brillant et Roy lui commande une boisson dont il sait qu'elle contient plus de glace que d'alcool. « Pourquoi donc, monsieur. Vous êtes un gentleman ? » Il rit dans son verre, s'étrangle presque. Il était un bandit. Il y a quelques temps, dans des draps sales alors qu'il n'avait même pas la force de traverser le hall pour aller à la salle de bain. Mais à présent, il est un gentleman et il pense aux bandits et à sa fille-bandit et il se demande si elle serait comme ça au même âge, trop maline pour les garçons et la musique de bar, il se demande si sa tête sera toujours remplie d'éléphants nageant dans les eaux de la Méditerranée, d'Indien à la lame fine et de princesse volant le cœur des bandits. Ça doit être ainsi. Alexandria avec son regard grave, et qui pourtant riait de tout ce qu'il disait, qui voulait tout connaître de son histoire, qui l'a sauvé . Et la fille a au moins ça en commun avec Alexandria, elle rit beaucoup trop, de manière suggestive cependant, et c'est perdu d'avance parce qu'il est plus vieux qu'elle. Et il recherche sa fille-bandit dans son regard souligné de khôl, et il sourit doucement, presque d'apaisement, heureux et en sécurité. « Non, non. » dit-il, et elle boit une gorgée de son verre. Une vraie demoiselle avec de la bière, sauvant les apparences malgré le goût amer. « Pas vraiment. » Elle rit, fort et ça le distrait. Ça lui donne envie de rire à son tour, cette jeunesse irréfléchie. Elle n'est pas maline, comme Alexandria qu'il ne reverra plus jamais. « Souris pour moi. » lui demande-t-il. Les yeux de Roy sont doux, et ses joues à elle rougissent du sentimentalisme soudain de son regard, de sa contemplation presque absente , elle n'arrive pas à mettre le doigt dessus, mais c'est flatteur et déconcertant, donc elle l'écoute. Elle lui offre un large et beau sourire. Ses cheveux, retenus en arrière par un ruban jaune, sont bouclés avec soins, noirs et brillants – pas sauvages et virevoltant, se détachant de petites tresses. Son anglais est irréprochable, en accord avec la Californie, elle n'a pas d'accent, pas de phrases bancales et hésitantes. Roy paye pour leurs boissons, se lève et lui tapote la tête comme le ferait un père … grand et rassurant. Elle n'est pas Alexandria, la nostalgie est comme l'agonie lente et froide de l'automne, et ici c'est la Californie. Il ne reverra jamais Alexandria, ça le tue un petit peu, ses doigts cherchent une cigarette pour éloigner la pulsion des pilules. Son sourire est trop blanc, trop parfait. Il ne reverra jamais Alexandria, c'est impossible. A moins d'être dans un conte, où l'on croise son nemesis au détour d'un sentier poussiéreux, où les frères et sœurs se trouvent réunis à nouveaux après des années, ça ne peut pas se passer comme ça, et il serait stupide d'oser espérer que ça puisse arriver. Ses doigts sursautent, et il pense aux pilules emportées par le courant des toilettes, et il a un paquet de cigarettes dans la poche de sa chemise, pour éloigner ces pensées-là, c'est normal de rêver d'Alexandria, Robin a dit que c'était normal. Et cette fille … elle n'est pas sa fille-bandit aux dents du bonheur, et la seule chose à laquelle Roy peut penser est Alexandria, l'imaginer plus âgée, par des bribes de mémoire, comme un rêve dont il n'a pas le contrôle. Il retourne dans sa voiture, roule jusqu'à la maison et marche directement jusqu'au bureau de Robin. Il est encore tôt. Il s'empare d'un vieux stylo et d'une feuille de papier blanche, il écrit. Ils travaillent à nouveaux ensemble sur un film, une histoire de demoiselle en détresse et de bâtiments en feu. Roy est excité, c'est dangereux, ça le fait sourire et son cœur bat la chamade. Il va travailler avec Sinclair à nouveau, cela fait un an qu'il a quitté l'hôpital et la star a l'air plus lisse que jamais, plus intouchable que jamais. Il sourit à Roy quand le réalisateur les réunit tous, mais Roy ne lui adresse qu'un signe de tête, parce qu'il s'en fiche bien à présent. Personne n'est là pour lui tenir la main. Il a tout perdu, mais il est en vie aujourd'hui, il n'a plus rien à perdre et il a déjà battu le Gouverneur Odius dans sa tête, et il réalise maintenant quel mauvais méchant il était, cheveux gominés et sourires lisses. Roy est son Ombre à nouveau. Il fait son boulot. Dans les jours qui suivent, Elle visite le plateau de tournage. La première fois qu'il la voit, après sa trahison, après qu'elle l'ait laissé pour Odius (Sinclair), il est surpris, il ne s'y était pas préparé – elle est en rouge, une blouse boutonnée jusqu'au cou et une longue jupe, elle se tient devant la véhicule de Sinclair, il se souvient de la courbe de ses hanches, de la douceur de sa bouche, de sa façon de pleurer et d'avoir l'air toujours belle même en pleurant, comme si Roy était un foutu réalisateur de film, pire comme s'il était un membre de l'audience, prêt à la satisfaire et à l'aduler. Parce qu'il avait été si sûr que leur destin était écrit dans les étoiles, la star montante tombant pour le cascadeur invisible, comme une princesse s'enfuyant avec le bandit, le rat d'égout. Mais elle n'est rien d'autre qu'une poupée, elle l'a trompé, elle s'est moquée de son amour … avant de le déserter. Il l'avait adulé. Ses yeux s'écarquillent, elle porte une main à sa bouche, murmure Oh, mon … Roy. Roy … ! Les larmes viennent, comme sur commande. Des perles pures et parfaites, ses mains fines agrippent son bras, son parfum sent la fraise et quelque chose de sucré et d'enivrant, de déroutant. Elle est mauvaise pour lui, comme de l'opium, elle le drogue et le dupe et il ne veut plus que ça arrive, plus jamais. Elle est désespérée et prend le visage de Roy entre ses mains délicates alors qu'il essaye de partir. Elle le supplie, pas de l'aimer, mais de la croire, parce qu'elle est une actrice après tout. Elle est suffisamment proche de lui pour qu'il l'embrasse, et il aurait pu. Oh, Roy aurait pu. C'est un cascadeur, il a survécu à des flammes et à des chutes, à des culbutes et à des balles, et offenser un homme en embrassant la femme de Sinclair n'aurait pas été effrayant. La femme de Sinclair , les mots sont comme de la cendre dans son esprit, elle a un jour été mienne. Homme pauvre, homme riche, homme pauvre, homme- mais comme une Ombre, Roy ne fait que porter la peau d'un autre homme, il est l'homme-double, il est l'homme-derrière-les-rideaux, il est l'homme-prends-une-balle-et-meurs, et la vérité c'est que lui et Sinclair sont probablement dans le même bateau, attachés à une femme si peu digne de confiance, une déserteuse, il prend en pitié le jour où Sinclair sera lui aussi trompé, le jour où un autre prendra sa place. Parce que les starlettes s'envolent dés qu'elles sentent que la lumière s'éteint et … il aurait du savoir … à la fin, la princesse est volage et stupide et il ne se fera plus avoir. Elle attend de lui qu'il l'entraîne derrière la voiture et qu'il l'embrasse sans pouvoir s'arrêter, qu'il se laisse embraser pour elle et qu'il se prosterne d'amour devant elle – parce que c'est comme ça que ça se passe dans les films, les femmes manipulatrices sont pardonnées et deviennent des saintes à nouveau. Elle ne s'attend pas à ce qu'il s'écarte d'elle en la repoussant, qu'il se dégage de ses doigts et qu'il rit à son visage. Le rire d'un adulte à un enfant stupide, méfiant et indifférent à la fois. « Oh ma chère, » lui dit-il, un sourire aux lèvres, presque malicieusement. « Tu es une imbécile. » Il ne regarde pas en arrière. Il y a vraiment quelque chose à propos de la Californie dont Roy ne pourrait pas se passer, l'air qu'on y trouve. Le climat, c'est chaud et brûlant, depuis la chaleur humide de l'air des embouteillages au mordant du vent de l'océan sur les côtes . Tout est vibrant, vif et brûlant, depuis l'herbe qu'il faut continuellement arroser pour éviter qu'elle s'embrase, aux rivages bleus et aveuglants lorsque la lumière du soleil éclaire les vagues. L'argent semble chaud aussi, billets chiffonnés et fumant aux quatre coins, pièces marquant la peau comme des balles d'argent. Étrangement, on peut adorer cela et le détester en même temps. Sa chemise colle à son dos, cela fait six ans depuis son accident. Il retire son chapeau, s'épongeant le front du dos de la main, plissant les yeux devant le lever du soleil. Parfois, ces jours-là, il a l'envie étrange de l'amer-sucré des oranges. Douze ans ont passé, il n'en a pas l'air mais il à trente-cinq ans à présent. Il s'éloigne petit à petit d'Hollywood, il n'y a pas beaucoup de demandes pour un vieux cascadeur, et trente-cinq ans c'est un âge de dinosaure , dit-il à Robin, avec un léger sourire en coin, il n'a pas de jambe en bois pour faire des gags comme l'avait fait Robin. Et le vieil homme lève son verre à cela, ayant quitté le business il y a quelques années déjà. Pour un cascadeur, son visage est resté relativement intact, les femmes le trouve d'ailleurs très chanceux de ce côté-là. Il a toujours un visage doux et beau, ou du moins, c'est ce que lui a dit la dernière fille, et il se rase tous les jours. Ses cheveux n'ont pas perdu de leur volume et il sourit, il a trente-cinq ans qu'il en ait l'air ou non. Son corps est mince, trop mince gronde Robin, les yeux plissés et dont le rire trace les lignes de son visage. Le chien est toujours vivant, presque aussi vieux que Robin, il dort, petite tête contre la botte de Roy et il lui caresse le flanc sans y réfléchir, par habitude. Roy écrit. Rien de spectaculaire cependant. Juste des petites histoires, ici et là, des articles – certaines ont été publiées dans des magazines sous des pseudonymes appropriés, d'autres (- comme le conte des six hommes, du bandit et de sa fille-bandit -) ont été couchées sur le papier puis gardées au fond de son tiroir, des histoires privées et en hommage au passé. Trop précieuses pour être échangées contre de l'argent. Il use le papier et noircit de mots des pages et des pages, et il y a des coupures sur ses doigts, les blessures de l'écrivain, des cicatrices plus fines et plus petites. Parce qu'il ne peut pas supporter les machines à écrire, elles le déconcentrent et font résonner des galops de chevaux dans sa tête. Roy écrit. Il se surprend lui-même à le faire. Mais ça lui semble être la bonne chose à faire, comme si c'était ce qu'il devrait faire, c'est ce qu'il a fait depuis l'accident, depuis la petite fille et il n'a jamais vraiment arrêté depuis. Pour un cascadeur ça semble être la bonne chose à faire, parce qu'il avait l'habitude d'être celui qui créait l'action dans les films pour les réalisateurs, il était la colonne invisible du spectacle, l'Ombre … en tant qu'écrivain, il est un Dieu invisible, il créé l'histoire, il fait en sorte que les éléments soient cohérents entre eux. C'est gratifiant, c'est salutaire, ça lui donne la sensation d'avoir les pieds sur Terre après la chute. De tous les endroits improbables, de tous ces endroits pour la rencontrer – c'est dans une bibliothèque, aussi peu dramatique que ça puisse être, ça ne manque pas de lui couper le souffle. Il ne la reconnaît pas tout de suite, une jolie petite chose aux cheveux attachés à la va-vite, le nez plongé dans le dernier numéro d'une bande-dessiné de cow-boys. Elle porte des lunettes pour lire, aux montures bleues, et son cœur bat la chamade jusqu'à ce qu'il l'atteigne, les paumes dansant au dessus de la surface de bois polis de la table, et elle lève les yeux impatiemment, devant les yeux émerveillés mais presque terrifiés de Roy parce qu'il se demande soudainement pourquoi … pourquoi, n'était-elle pas supposée ramasser des oranges ? Ses yeux ont l'air agacé, une expression qu'il lui connaît si bien. Elle ouvre la bouche pour l'envoyer promener et soudain sa mâchoire se relâche. « Oh. » dit-elle alors que leurs regards se croisent. « Oh ! » Et il tremble, souriant comme un fou tandis que son esprit s'envole de son corps et elle crie suffisamment fort pour faire tomber le toit du bâtiment, et sans même réfléchir, elle se jette dans ses bras. « Roy ! Oh, Roy ! C'est vraiment toi ! ». Elle est bien plus grande qu'avant, mais reste petite tout de même, et elle s'est souvenue de lui – elle s'est souvenue du lui. Son poids dans ses bras le fait sursauter, aussi mince qu'elle puisse être, et il rit, ses doigts effleurant les petites bouclettes sur sa nuque, il dégage les mèches de cheveux de son visage. « Je ne peux pas y croire - » elle pose ses mains devant sa bouche pour se taire, mais ses yeux bleus-gris (- longs cils , sourcils légèrement dessinés, plus de joues d'enfant) sont animés par quelque chose qu'il connaît bien lorsqu'elle pointe du doigt le panneau 'Silence' au dessus de leurs têtes, et qu'elle lui fait signe de chuchoter. Ses yeux ont toujours été ainsi, petites pépites d'or dansant dans ses iris bleus lorsqu'elle murmure. « C'est toi . » « Alexandria la Grande. » dit-il, et elle sourit avec malice, et il se demande quand est-elle devenue si, si … ? « Je pensais que tu aurais oublié. » Elle claque des doigts et pose la main sur son cœur, en murmurant comme s'ils étaient des voleurs en mission, partageant un serment. « Jamais. » Quelque chose dans sa poitrine semble se remettre en place, lorsqu'elle ferme d'une main son livre et qu'elle l'attire entre les allées de la bibliothèque, lui demandant simplement de marcher. Il relève les bras, roule les yeux et fait quelques pas en avant et en arrière. « Entièrement opérationnel. » lui lance-t-il avec humour, et ses yeux sont humides quand elle rit. « Je te vois, » Plus tard, ils sont assis sur les marches de pierres devant la bibliothèque, elle a ses jambes repliées sous elle, sa jupe couvrant sa peau. Elle se tient parfaitement droite. Elle doit avoir dix-sept ans à présent, Roy est encore en train de s'accommoder, il n'arrive pas à la quitter des yeux. Elle est toute nouvelle. « À chaque fois que j'allais au cinéma, je te voyais faire tes cascades, et je les regardais plein plein plein de fois pour être sûre que c'était toi. » Il fait claquer sa langue, ses bras sont sur ses genoux, son dos contre les marches. « Pourquoi ça ? » « Et bien, » murmure-t-elle, avant de rire avec gène tandis qu'elle replace une mèche de cheveux derrière son oreille. « Je pensais que maman me mentait, quand elle me disait que tu guérirais … parfois, je crois que je t'imaginais, parce que ça aurait été plus simple. » « Je suis désolé. » dit-il, sans vraiment savoir de quoi il s'excuse, mais sachant qu'il y a quelque chose pour lequel il se sent terriblement désolé. « Ne dis pas ça. » Alexandria sourit. « J'aimais te regarder. » « Tu es vraiment une jeune fille malicieuse, Alexandria. » Il tend la main pour lui secouer les cheveux, comme on le fait aux enfants, parce que c'est Alexandria. Sauf que cela ne fonctionne plus vraiment à présent, elle écarte sa tête et rit, elle tend son doigt pour lui tapoter sous l'œil, suffisamment fort pour l'éborgner. « Je n'ai jamais oublié, » dit-elle, alors qu'il continue de s'en remettre, son accent est toujours présent, fort et roulant, mais plus aussi compliqué à comprendre, ses mots sont toujours crus. Ça l'étonne un peu. « A propos des histoires, c'est toi qui les racontais le mieux. » « J'en suis ravi. » Roy ne pense pas qu'il puisse dire autre chose, excepté. « Tu es encore un bandit ? » « Bien sûr ! » dit-elle avant de rire. Toujours la même, Alexandria riant du moindre de ses mots, lui réchauffant le cœur, faisant des étincelles dans son âme. « Oh, mais je ne ramasse plus d'oranges, puisque tu le demandais. Je travaille à la ville maintenant. C'est mieux. Quelques petits boulots ici et là, serveuse et ce genre de chose … maman me laisse faire, les docteurs l'ont convaincu depuis ma chute, donc elle me laisse vivre dans la ville, je me fais suffisamment d'argent pour pouvoir lui en envoyer à la maison, et après le travail je vais souvent au cinéma. Ou à la bibliothèque, comme maintenant. Et toi, Roy ? Roy Roy Roy, elle répète son nom encore et encore, il se demande s'il s'est gravé dans son cœur comme ça. Roy. « Des cascades. » dit-il. C'est la fin de l'après-midi, les marches sont rouges comme des mandarines et le visage d'Alexandria est à moitié à la lumière et à moitié dans l'ombre, mais son sourire ne la quitte pas. Elle est mince, fine d'une manière qui lui rappelle les branches souples des arbres de sa maison d'enfance, quand il volait des pommes dans les vergers et qu'il s'écorchait les genoux en jouant. Et pourtant, elle se tient droite, d'une dignité qui lui est propre, sauvage mais malicieuse, comme ce jour où elle était venue pour lui arracher des mains un bout de papier, cette toute première fois. Aujourd'hui elle rit avec lui, comme elle aurait rit contre son bras, assise sur un vieux matelas poussiéreux d'hôpital, lui lançant des pelures d'oranges sur la tête. Alexandria. « Tu es tombé à nouveau dernièrement ? » elle demande, le fixant des yeux comme s'il était sa propre responsabilité. Elle n'aime pas le mensonge, et il ne lui mentira pas, pas à elle. « Juste quelques petites blessures, ici … et là. » « Ici et là ? » répète-t-elle suspicieusement, mais avec bon cœur. « Oui. » Il sourit, et puis elle se tourne, cherchant dans sa sacoche une feuille de papier et un crayon. Elle a plus l'air d'une étudiante que d'une bibliothécaire, elle devrait se détacher les cheveux, ils encadreraient si joliment son visage en forme de cœur. Il ne peut plus dire qu'elle a un visage d'enfant, ses lèvres sont pulpeuses et bien dessinées, ses yeux bleus-gris-noisette ne ressemblent plus à un moka mais à des joyaux poussiéreux. Il ne pourrait les nommer. Elle griffonne sur le papier, le déchire et s'approche de lui, elle lui prend sa main, il la laisse faire. Sa peau est chaude contre la sienne, ses doigts longs et gracieux, doux mais pas précieux, ils sont décidés lorsqu'elle ouvre ses doigts pour poser au creux de sa paume le bout de papier. Elle le presse dans sa main, comme un Ostie sacré. Ça ressemble à un baiser, et elle lui dit : « C'est mon adresse, d'accord ? » Il ouvre la bouche pour lui demander pourquoi, mais elle lui sourit et tapote sa main, et replie ses doigts sur le papier, protégeant le souvenir. « Je reste chez une vieille amie de ma famille, elle … garde les lettres pour moi, » et soudainement elle s'arrête, ses oreilles se colorant de rose (ou peut-être, il n'arrive pas à savoir si c'est elle, lui ou le soleil couchant qui peint ses joues en rouge), avant de reprendre. « Enfin, tu n'es pas obligé de m'écrire Roy. C'est juste au cas où - » « Je peux te raccompagner jusque chez toi. » « Non non, je ne peux pas rentrer tout de suite, » elle répond, comme si elle était l'adulte entre eux deux. Elle avait déjà l'habitude d'utiliser ce ton de temps à autre, à l'époque. « J'ai encore du travail, ailleurs. » Je pourrai attendre, a-t-il envie de répondre , j'ai attendu toutes ces années, je peux attendre. Mais Alexandria pose une main sur sa joue, entre le pincement et la tapote et elle embrasse sa peau, juste sous son œil, sur sa cicatrice, c'est très chaste et ses lèvres sont douces, les yeux de Roy se ferment quelques secondes et elle lui sourit, d'un sourire franc et heureux, simple. Alexandria se relève avec le soleil dans son dos. Il rêve de chevaux, de villes bleues, de la chaleur étouffante d'un ciel de désert, de pétales de lotus se dispersant dans l'eau et d'Alexandria. Le soleil contre ses cheveux, elle a l'air de brûler, brûler comme une ville en pleine nuit, comme l'acidulée, brûlante Californie. Elle est partie avant même qu'il puisse reprendre son souffle. Il retourne à la maison, chez Robin qui lui a souvent dit dans le passé qu'il ne pouvait pas faire de gags. J'ai eu ma jambe mangée par des sauvages, sciée par des criminels et j'ai même reçu un harpon dedans. Tu ne peux pas faire des cascades pour gags. Les gags c'est pas pour toi. T'es trop intellectuel pour ça. Roy sourit, étale sa feuille de papier, prêt à écrire une lettre à Alexandria. Sauf que ce n'est pas si facile, il a l'impression d'écrire une lettre à un monde, à une partie de son âme, à lui-même et ça devient beaucoup plus qu'une simple lettre … c'est un papier au milieu de papiers d'histoires et de contes, des pages et des pages retenues ensemble et glissés dans une enveloppe. Qu'il déchire en deux rapidement avant de la jeter dans la poubelle. Il ne peut plus lui offrir des histoires, c'est une femme maintenant, une jeune femme avec des poignets fins et ses mains lui semblent à présent plus appropriées pour se poser dans le creux du dos d'Alexandria plutôt que tapotant gentiment le haut de sa tête, et Roy s'arrache les cheveux nerveusement. S'il lui envoie des histoires, il finira par tomber amoureux d'elle. Il ne peut pas permettre ça. Il lui écrit donc d'autres choses, à propos des films pour lesquels il a travaillé, à propos des cascades étranges qu'il a dû faire, à propos de son enfance à Los Angeles, cassant des bouches à incendies, dansant dans les jets d'eau, volant dans les vignobles. Il lui envoie ces histoires-là et pense qu'il est quand même en train de tomber amoureux d'elle. J'ai enterré les dents du vieil homme dans une peau d'orange, c'est dans un champ. J'aime penser que ça a poussé … l'indien de la ferme se demandait si l'oranger qui pousserait aurait des dents ! Tu te souviens de ce que tu m'avais dit à l'époque Roy ? Que la force de son esprit est dans ses dents, c'est son âme, c'est pourquoi il les conservait dans un verre tous les soirs. Je ne me rappelle que de peu de choses, juste qu'il était très gentil avec moi, et que dans mes rêves il était le Mystique, et dans mes rêves Roy, tu étais toujours le héros. Le bandit masqué. Les lettres d'Alexandria sont parfaitement bien écrites, pas comme ses propres pattes de mouche, qui ressemblent à des gravures faites à même le bois d'un arbre, profondément gauches, mal disposées. Entre sa mauvaise grammaire à elle, et son écriture illisible à lui, ils forment la paire. Et il lui répond, presque toujours aussitôt. Il fait attention à ne pas mentionner le fait qu'elle l'ait sauvé, parce que s'il commence il n'est pas sûr de pouvoir s'arrêter, et c'est une voie dangereuse à emprunter. Tu as dix-sept ans à présent, n'est-ce pas ? Tu écris bien, je suis impressionné. Et même dans ses lettres, sur le papier, il peut entendre son rire, sentir son sourire contre sa peau. Se demandant si elle sent le citron. Les lettres ne suffisent pas, et Roy se retrouve à souvent attendre devant la bibliothèque ces jours-ci, espérant la croiser. Un jeudi ses efforts sont récompensés, lorsqu'il parvient à l'inviter boire un café. Un café avec terrasse et petites tables, elle est surprise, mais pas impressionnée, elle a sa fierté – Roy ne la laisse pas payer sa commande, et elle lui fait presque une scène. Et soupire juste, et pousse les petites assiettes et le thé sur le bord pour déposer une boîte rectangulaire sur la table, elle est vieille et abîmée sur les angles, il y a longtemps c'était probablement une boîte de chocolats. « Regarde. » lui dit-elle, et elle ouvre la boîte. Elle en sort des petits papiers coupés, des masques de papier-mâché, des dessins au crayon et d'autres petites étrangetés. Il connaît cette boîte. « Tu te souviens ? » Il soulève le marque, d'abord par ses ficelles, avec révérence, doucement – attention. Il ne peut pas empêcher ses doigts de trembler. « Tu vois ? » dit-elle avec entrain. Sa robe blanche jure horriblement avec ses souliers plats rouges, et soudainement, cette fille-enfant, il sait qu'elle est a lui – elle doit l'être, et il est à elle. Ça ne peut pas se passer autrement, après tout, elle porte avec elle son âme depuis tellement longtemps, comment ça pourrait se passer autrement ? Sa mouche est sèche, il inspire une grande bouffé d'air, et lui demande, comme cette fois-ci où ce n'était pas vraiment elle. Il respire profondément et son cœur bat la chamade. « Souris pour moi ? » Tu te souviens de beaucoup de choses pour quelqu'un qui était si jeune à l'époque Tu as pleuré pour moi toi aussi. Il prend sa vieille voiture et descend les rues, fixant le papier entre ses mains à intervalles régulières, il tourne le volant et empreinte des routes et des carrefours qu'il ne connaît pas. Les rues sont de plus en plus étroites, les bâtiments sont comme empilés les uns sur les autres, c'est un vieux quartier poussiéreux de la banlieue, où s'entassent migrants et pauvres. Il y a peu d'arbres, et même sa vieille voiture cabossée n'a pas l'air si mal en comparaison au paysage qu'il traverse. Bientôt les lumières de la ville seront allumées, elles éclaireront d'un halo trouble les bas côtés et feront briller les balustrades des immeubles comme du réglisse. Il arrête sa voiture sur le bord de la route, deux roues sur les pavés du trottoir, il est légèrement incliné dans l'habitacle. Roy relève ses lunettes de soleil pour jeter un œil à l'immeuble de quatre étage coincé entre ce qui a l'air d'être une boucherie casher avec un rosaire tendu sur la porte, et une boutique de liqueur devant laquelle un usurier s'est arrêté pour tousser. Les regards se tournent vers lui, curieux. L'homme blanc est venu avec sa voiture dans un quartier où peu d'hommes blancs s'aventurent. Roy Walker n'est pas issu d'une famille riche, il a passé son enfance dans les vergers d'autres gens, sans faire travailler son esprit, mais plutôt en volant des oranges et en s'écorchant les mains sur des branches sinueuses, chaque nouvelle blessure était plus belle que l'ancienne. Son père possédait un vignoble, sa mère était une femme d'origine écossaise, étant née et ayant grandi à New York - il ne connaissait pourtant pas grand chose hormis le soleil de la Californie, et sa chaleur magnifique. Il avait grandi aimé, il avait été à l'université pour passer le temps, pour apprendre l'architecture et l'agriculture. Il a bu autant qu'il le pouvait et a échappé à la guerre. Il a appris à être un fantôme pour ces fantastiques, fantastiques films. Même l'université avait l'air ennuyeux à côté de ça. Et Roy était devenu si bon à presque mourir, chaque jour un peu meilleur. Deux garçons s'amusant avec des branches à faire rouler des cannettes sur le trottoir s'arrêtent devant sa voiture. Ils sont curieux et presque en émerveillement devant cet homme aux lunettes de soleil, Roy baisse la vitre et ouvre la portière pour laisser sortir ses jambes. Il leur parle et écoute leurs questions incessantes à propos de sa voiture, leur excitation est palpable. C'est une vieille voiture, raisonnent-ils. Il acquiesce. Pourquoi tu la vends pas ? Non, je ne peux pas faire ça. Cette voiture c'est comme ma famille. Hein ? Elle est vieille, m'sieur. Tout comme moi. Tu as un chien, petit ? Non, j'ai un chat. Si ton chat devient vieux, est-ce que tu l'achèverais ? Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire m'sieur ? Tu l'achèverais, tu le laisserais s'en aller ? Tu le vendrais ? Bah, non m'sieur. Tu vois, c'est exactement ça. Non, non m'sieur. C'est différent, tu peux pas comparer un chat et une voiture. C'est différent. En quoi c'est différent ? Ça l'est, c'est tout. Il demande, avec sa meilleur tentative de sourire d'Hollywood. « Est-ce qu'il y a une fille nommée Alexandria ici ? » Ils le regardent, soudainement hostiles, suspicieux. « Peut-être. La logeuse le sait. » « Je l'ai connue lorsqu'elle était enfant, vous savez ? » dit-il calmement avec un sourire pour les mettre à l'aise, « elle avait les dents du bonheur. Ça ne se voit plus aujourd'hui, mais elle avait vraiment les dents du bonheur, et elle était toute petite, à peu près de votre âge. » Ça fonctionne. « Comment tu connais la fille roumaine ? » « On était tombé tous les deux », dit-il. « Et on était dans le même hôpital. Je lui racontais des histoires. » « Comment tu es tombé, m'sieur ? » « J'étais un cascadeur. » Et là, tout leur attention était sienne, étoiles dans les yeux et lui demandant s'il connaissait Charlie Chaplin. « Je l'ai rencontré une fois, un type charmant ce Charlie. » « T'es pas son petit-ami ? » Roy ouvre la bouche, hésite - « La logeuse aime pas ce genre d'histoires, c'est une vieille juive. Une des filles d'ici, elle avait un Jules, et il le faisait rentrer en douce, et il se faisait prendre à chaque fois. Elle est folle. » Et puis une exclamation, et l'ouverture et la fermeture d'une vieille porte en ferraille, et Alexandria en chaussons. Elle porte une longue robe de chambre qui lui recouvre la peau et ne dévoile rien d'autre que ses mains, pour la première fois de sa vie, elle ne sait pas quoi dire. Elle se rend, le temps d'un instant seulement. « Roy ! » elle s'exclame, resserrant les pans de sa robe autour d'elle et s'approchant de sa voiture. « Pourquoi es-tu … ? » Il est soudainement très attentif, a-t-il fait une bêtise, d'une façon ou d'une autre ? A-t-il mal compris l'invitation, le papier avec l'adresse attire l'attention d'Alexandria et elle fait un pas en avant pour faire déguerpir les deux garçons. Ils grommellent et partent. « Oh, Roy ! » « Est-ce que ça va te créer des ennuis ? » s'inquiète-t-il. « Elle n'est pas là pour le moment, la logeuse. » elle s'autorise un sourire, malgré la surprise. « Je ne t'attendais pas. » « Elle est très stricte ? » « Elle est de Roumanie, comme mes parents. Elle est très … elle est de la vieille école. Toutefois, » Elle savoure le mot, elle a longtemps voulu utiliser ce genre de vocabulaire. « Elle n'est pas là, elle est partie à la synagogue pour les prières de nuit, elle va bientôt revenir. » « Je suis désolé. » « Tu ne pouvais pas savoir. » Il se redresse et s'éloigne de sa voiture, évitant de croiser les yeux d'Alexandria. Il remarque que ses cheveux sont détachés, ils bouclent au niveau de ses épaules, mèches d'un brun foncé semblables à des nuages langoureux de fumée, trop lourdes pour être soulevées par le vent. Comme de la fumée de charbon. Il ne devrait pas la regarder si fixement. « J'aimerais que l'on passe du temps ensemble quelques fois, qu'on aille au parc. » Le visage d'Alexandria s'illumine, sa peau est foncée et adoucie par l'été. Aucune femme ne pourrait lui rivaliser. « Je travaille vraiment beaucoup. » « Mais tu es libre quelques fois. N'est-ce pas ? » « Hm. La logeuse ne me mettra jamais dehors – c'est une parente. » « Oh. » Il se tient un peu plus droit, fait l'erreur de croiser ses yeux si, si brillants et il tombe amoureux d'elle encore et encore. « Est-ce qu'on peut se promener, de temps en temps, Alexandria ? » « Seulement le samedi. » dit-elle, le regardant avec appréhension derrière ses longs cils, timide presque. « Est-ce que ça te va ? » « Oui. C'est parfait. » Se balançant au bord d'un précipice, retenu par du la soie verte, un homme masqué en hakama fend les airs avant de faire un bond. Un dieu flamboyant, un héros splendide, brûlant à travers la cendre virevoltant dans l'air. Il atterrit sur le sol, depuis des hauteurs inimaginables. Sur ces deux pieds, comme un chat gracieux, par une chaude journée Égéenne, il est insurmontable, il est victorieux, son conquérant. Il lui parle dans des langues que des étrangers ne pourraient jamais comprendre, son merveilleux conquérant. Son bandit. Alexandria, qui dort contre les vitres des voitures descendant les rues sombres, tresse ses cheveux entre ses différents services, elle enfile ses bas de travail marrons et fixe les pavés au sol, attendant la brise qui fera voler les journaux, et qui parfois, comme un vieil ami, soulèvera les bords de sa chemise de serveuse, fera danser ses tresses. Ses jours sont colorés d'une palette que personne hormis elle pourrait imaginer, peu dans le monde, non, personne, ni même les prophètes ne pourrait la décrire – dans le train il y a des bribes de ce bleu de Méditerranée, comme celui d'une cité bleue cachée du soleil par l'ombre des nuages. Et dans les étals de fruits qu'elle voit chaque mercredi, elle sourit devant le rouge des fraises, si semblable à celui de la promesse faite dans le sang que l'Indien portait sur son front. Et garde des graines de cardamome et des gousses de vanille dans sa sacoche, elle imagine des colombes posées sur la rambarde de secours de son immeuble. Elle est encore une enfant, dont les rêves se reflètent dans sa vie d'adulte. Peter Pan serait jaloux d'elle. Roy lui dit une fois qu'elle le fait sentir comme un enfant à nouveau. Ils sont dans l'un des parcs de la ville, celui avec le grand lac. Celui avec les arbres importés de quelque part en Asie, il lui explique que de petites fleurs roses sont supposées éclore au printemps. Mais à cet instant, des cheveux virevoltent de son chignon (pas de tresses aujourd'hui) parce que la voiture de Roy est vieille et que le vent s'engouffre à l'intérieur. Cela rend son visage enfantin. Comme un sourire. Les longues jambes de Roy sont croisées et reposent contre une racine, il a plié sa veste pour s'en faire un oreiller, tenant son chapeau contre son torse. Comme Huckleberry Finn. « Tu ris tellement, tu souris tellement. » explique-t-il de sa façon à lui. « Tu dois connaître quelques secrets sur ce monde que je ne connais pas – pour être aussi en paix. Je me trompe ? » Et soudainement, ses yeux sont en alerte, presque paniqués, il la regarde frénétiquement et attend qu'elle le rassure.« Tu es heureuse, Alexandria. N'est-ce pas ? » La plupart des hommes fréquentant des femmes plus jeunes, se sentent vieux. Mais Roy ne se sent pas simplement jeune, il la voit avec un regard jeune. Il n'est pas pris dans la folie d'un vieil homme qui aime prétendre le temps d'un instant qu'il est jeune lorsqu'il se trouve à côté d'une jolie petite chose, Roy n'a même pas de cheveux grisonnants. Ses yeux sont si honnêtes, si captivés, si curieux – elle pourrait s'y laisser emporter, et ils gardent tout de même cette fiévreuse sérénité. Et il aime tellement toutes ces petites choses de la vie, grimper aux arbres, raconter des histoires, qu'il n'a l'air de rien d'autre qu'un enfant, surtout avec ces yeux-là . Il est comme il était à l'hôpital. Il se repose sur elle. Il est sa responsabilité. Ses tempes sont recouvertes de ses cheveux bruns et si épais que l'on aimerait y passer la main, il a l'air si attachant et heureux lorsqu'il conduit, ses lunettes de soleil remontées dans ses cheveux. Sa peau est tiède, légèrement halée. Un nez droit, cassé une fois ou deux, qu'il a probablement remis en place tout seul. L'argenté d'une petite cicatrice sous son œil. Ses grandes mains chaleureuses. Un rire franc. Le besoin oppressant d'être, oh, si honnête, se reflétant dans ses yeux. « Tu ne l'es pas ? » le questionne-t-elle en retour, l'ombre d'un sourire sur les lèvres, avec le même ton qui la caractérisait tellement lorsqu'elle était enfant. « Tu l'es ? » insiste-t-il. « Oui, j'ai du travail. J'ai rencontré Roy à nouveau. Pourquoi ne pas être heureuse ? » Elle prend le panier sur ses jambes, et se concentre à peler les oranges qu'elle a amené, les yeux de Roy contiennent trop de gratitude, et elle ne peut pas le fixer et rester stoïque et neutre face à son regard. Les oranges sont familières, comme l'orangeraie au bord de la ville, pour laquelle elle et sa sœur gardent de l'argent, pour la racheter, peut-être, un jour. Pour leur mère. En la mémoire de leur père. Elle les sépare en quartiers puis en morceaux, habile avec son couteau. Elle lui en tend une assiette, une de ces assiettes qu'elle garde normalement polie et derrière la vitre du vaisselier avec sa petite argenterie, mais aujourd'hui elle les a sorties au soleil pour Roy. L'herbe chatouille la peau derrière ses genoux, sa jupe recouvre ses cuisses, mais elle ne porte pas de bas aujourd'hui parce que c'est son jour de repos, et elle voulait sentir la verdure sur sa peau. « Je pensais que peut-être tu me détesterais. » dit-il dans le feu de la confession, alors qu'il s'assoit contre le tronc d'arbre, à côté d'elle et que leurs épaules se frôlent. Elle est surprise, au delà-même des mots. Il comble le silence après un instant. « Tu vois. Je t'ai raconté des belles histoires. Et tu étais juste une enfant. Je t'ai fait croire en des choses merveilleuses, des aventures, des héros, de la magie et de l'amour – je pensais que tu y croyais si fermement, pour seulement découvrir plus tard que tout ça était un mensonge – » « Ce n'était pas un mensonge. » Il la regarde. Les yeux de Roy ont la couleur des rivières grises s'évadant, s'éludant vers une mer de cristal. Encore aujourd'hui, il lui rappelle quelque chose ressemblant à une forêt saccagée, au clapotement silencieux de l'eau, au calme de pensées mélancoliques. « On ne peut pas vivre éternellement dans les histoires, Alexandria. » « Pourquoi pas ? » Il fronce les sourcils. Elle a dit ça avec force, plus que d'habitude, avec une moue presque sévère et des yeux déterminés. « Parce que la vie n'est pas un conte de fée. La réalité est dure. Les histoires sont des interludes, comme dans un spectacle de magie. Des illusions. Les mendiants ne deviennent pas des princes du jour au lendemain, il n'y a pas de princesses, de bandes d'hommes braves prêts à combattre le mal – et quand tu réalises ça … pourquoi tu ne me détestes pas ? Je n'ai pas été là, avec toi, toutes ces années. C'est tout comme si je t'avais abandonné. Je ne t'ai pas sauvé. » Elle secoue la tête et essuie dans l'herbe ses mains couvertes de jus d'orange. Elle relève les yeux vers lui, un petit sourire aux lèvres qui le confuse, plus maline qu'il ne le sera jamais. Son Athéna. Elle s'appuie un peu sur son épaule, sa joue contre son bras. « Tu es bête Roy. » Il ferme les yeux, lorsqu'elle le regarde depuis cet angle, reposée contre son épaule, il paraît encore plus magnifique. « Tu es bête Roy. » Les doigts d'Alexandria caressent la manche de sa chemise. Cela lui avait manqué, ça fait si longtemps depuis ces journées passées dans cette petite salle d'hôpital, le visage de Roy se balançant et s'endormant juste à côté d'elle. « Tu es toujours le héros, bien sûr que tu es réel. N'en doute jamais. » Comment pourrait-elle l'aimer autrement ? Non, tu devrais demander à quelqu'un d'autre. Il n'y a pas de fin heureuse avec moi. Je veux quand même l'entendre. La science, ou plutôt la motivation derrière sa vie avec Alexandria était bien plus simple que ce que Roy croyait. Elle était saupoudrée de remords, de gratitude et d'un tel désir désespéré et angoissé qu'il ne pouvait l'empêcher de résonner au plus profond de son corps, dans le moindre de ses os. Dans son cœur. Il se souviens du passé, de cette table d'opération où ils l'avaient laissée, de sa tête bandée, alors qu'elle reposait là comme un corps sans vie. Il avait rongé ses ongles jusqu'à arriver à la peau, et quand il avait du laisser ses mains tranquilles, il avait rempli sa bouche de liqueur et avait bu jusqu'à ce que le liquide soit un couteau dans son estomac, lui retournant les entrailles et tailladant sa gorge de remord et de tristesse qu'il ne pouvait supporter. Parce qu'il était un tel homme – un tel dieu factice pour avoir osé prendre l'amour d'une fillette pour son père et l'utiliser pour ses propres désirs, il s'était servi d'elle consciencieusement pour récupérer sa M-O-R-P-H-I-N-3, et elle était tellement pâle sous la lumière crue des néons. Si immobile. Il avait cru l'avoir tuée. Morte si jeune et si brisée. Il l'a enchantée, il lui a menti. Il a tissé des histoires comme le font les menteurs. Il s'est servi d'elle. Il l'a captivée avec des jeux de lumières et de miroirs, avec des illusions, fabricant une fantaisie qui ne pouvait exister. Il veut lui dire exactement combien il y a d'étoiles dans le ciel, à quel endroit se situe la lune lorsque le soleil se lève, il veut lui raconter chaque histoire d'amour qu'il connaisse, lui expliquer chaque roucoulement des oiseaux chanteurs près du lac, il veut lui accorder plus que son cœur de rêveur, il veut être brillant, il veut être plus fort encore. C'était très simple. Maintenant qu'il la connaissait à nouveau, une seconde fois. Il voulait lui donnait la fin de l'histoire dont elle avait besoin – celle dont il l'avait privé. Il voulait lui offrir le monde entier. Il est un homme de trente-six ans à présent, elle en a dix-huit, ce n'est pas bien. « Dix-neuf, c'était mon anniversaire le mois dernier. » dit-elle. « J'en ai pas l'air, hein ? … c'était quoi ta question ? » Roy tripote la cuillère entre ses doigts, et sa bouche forme un sourire penaud, il n'a pas le courage de se distancer du problème, ni de s'y confronter. Il n'est pas sûr de pouvoir y survivre. « Tu avais dit que ton anniversaire était en décembre. » « Je t'ai menti, » dit-elle presque amèrement, avec honte mais certaine de sa décision. « Tu m'aurais acheté tout un tas de choses si je t'avais dit que c'était le mois dernier. Et maintenant que c'est passé, tu n'as pas à m'offrir quelque chose, donc c'est bon. » « Qui décide de ça ? » Roy est complètement blessé, elle lit très bien en lui, trop bien même. Avec ses regards en coin qu'elle utilise avec attention pour juger de son humeur. « Qui décide que je n'ai pas le droit de t'offrir quelque chose ?» « Ça ne serait pas très … charmant … de ta part d'essayer. » Alexandria prend un cuillerée de la crème glacée qu'ils partagent, les coudes sur la table. Il fronce les sourcils, une moue agacée sur le visage et ses yeux sont très sérieux. « C'est vraiment cruel. » « Je ne veux pas que tu te sentes obligé, Roy. » dit-elle doucement, ses yeux rencontrant les siens, doux et compréhensifs. « Il n'y a rien que tu ais fait pour lequel je doive te pardonner. Tu ne dois pas te sentir si blessé et désolé, tu n'as pas à garder ça pour toi jusqu'à la tombe ». « … Tu es très cruelle de me dire ça. » Il attrape le verre de vin qu'elle n'a pas encore touché, brisant le contact de leurs yeux, vidant le verre d'un trait. Soudainement amer. « Je ne me pardonne pas moi-même. » « S'il-te-plaît, fais le, » Alexandria a des yeux si patients et sages, ils représentent tout pour lui. « Tu n'as pas à te sentir obligé de toujours vouloir passer du temps avec moi- » « Mais je veux te voir. » Il décide d'aller enfin plus loin, de dire la vérité, c'est suffisant pour qu'un silence tombe entre eux. Mais il se reprend rapidement. « Alexandria, je veux passer du temps avec toi. » « Oh, Roy. » dit-elle en posant sa main sur le poing serré de Roy. « Ou … est-ce que je te dérange ? » il a du mal à trouver les bons mots, ils sortent brusquement de sa gorge, et il appréhende sa réponse tout à coup. « Non, comment tu pourrais me déranger ? » elle sourit « Tu es le bandit masqué, le fléau du sud-est.» « Tu es différente et pourtant tu restes la même, tu as trop grandi pour être encore ma fille bandit » dit Roy, pincé. « Ou pas du tout. Je ne sais pas, Alexandria, je ne sais pas si je peux encore être un bandit - » « Roy- » « Tu es forte, tu as grandi et tu es libre. Tu n'as pas besoin d'un héros, et dans tous les cas, je n'ai jamais été un bon héros. » Il est soudainement à bout de souffle, lui dévoiler tout ça, c'est comme marcher sur la pointe des pieds au bord d'un précipice. Oh, il ne peut plus se tourmenter plus longtemps. « Je ne suis pas ton père, Alexandria. » « ... Qu'est-ce que tu veux dire ? » « Je ne peux plus te considérer comme ma fille » admet-il, et il ne peut pas la regarder dans les yeux. Ce qu'il y verrait pourrait le briser, et il ne peut pas s'arrêter à mi-chemin. « S'il-te-plaît. » Quand je m'endormirais … il faudra que tu partes. Pourquoi ? Parce que je ne veux pas que tu me vois comme ça … Plus tard, cette nuit-là, il la dépose sur le perron de sa maison. La lumière du foyer fait des étincelles, et le visage d'une vieille femme apparaît derrière les rideaux pour les regarder suspicieusement. La mâchoire de Roy est serrée et aucun d'eux n'a osé briser le silence durant tout le trajet du retour. Alexandria s'arrête juste avant d'entrer, se tourne pour le regarder, ses yeux sont troublés, inquiets même. La lumière des lampadaires peint sa robe de jaune et crée des ombres dans les creux de ses clavicules, ses cheveux sont retenues en arrière, elle est tellement belle, elle qui ne sera jamais sienne. Elle se mordille la lèvre avant de parler. « Roy. » Il ferme les yeux, il ne peut pas la supplier. Il ne devrait pas. « Roy. » Les doigts d'Alexandria sur sa mâchoire sont comme la caresse d'une plume, sa main fugace et qui lui rappelle pourtant le toucher d'une mère, ou d'une épouse. Sauf qu'elle le regarde avec la clarté d'une étrangère, elle ne laisse pas sa perception de lui être embrumée, elle le verra toujours de la façon qu'elle souhaite le voir, et avec clarté. « Roy, ne sois pas si fâché. » Ses mots sont bloqués dans sa gorge. Il n'a pas envie de la faire pleurer. « Je ne suis pas en colère. » Sa bouche se relève un peu, dans un sourire qu'il détesterai voir dans le miroir. « Je suis juste capricieux. J'ai l'impression d'être un enfant. » « C'est parce que tu es jeune à jamais. » lui répond-t-elle avec un sourire doux, ses doigts tendres contre sa peau. « D'accord ? » « Tu es une alchimiste. » souffle-t-il. Au diable la femme derrière les rideaux, il se fiche de savoir si elle l'entend, elle ne pourra jamais comprendre. « Alexandria, tu me fais vivre éternellement. » « Je t'aime, Roy. » dit-elle sans honte, sans remords. Son esprit essaye de raisonner avant que son cœur ne s'emballe complètement, parce qu'elle ne peut définitivement pas le dire de la façon qu'il rêve d'entendre. Ses yeux sont sincères, de la couleur de joyaux précieux. « Donc ne disparaît pas. » « Je resterai. » dit-il doucement alors qu'elle ne le lâche toujours pas. Sa caresse est aussi douce qu'un baume, et pourtant elle est si brûlante et enivrante qu'elle lui donne envie de plus. Elle retire sa main, caressant du bout des doigts sa mâchoire au passage, croisant les bras. « Promis ? Et ne croise pas les doigts. » « Je ne le ferai pas. » Il sourit avec nostalgie devant cet échange familier, ce morceau de l'histoire qu'il reconnaît, il lève les mains, écarte les doigts aussi loin qu'il le peut. Un homme les mains en l'air, lâchant toutes ses armes, et oh, il n'y a pas de reddition plus douloureuse et divine. Plus délicieuse. « Tu vois ? » Le problème n'était pas son dos. Ni sa colonne vertébrale. Ce n'étaient pas non plus ses jambes. Connaissez-vous l'histoire ? C'est un groupe de cinq héros, chacun poursuivant sa propre mort spectaculaire – et une princesse, rose et empoisonnée comme les fleurs d'un laurier. Le problème vient de son cœur, brisé. De ses yeux, perdus. Piégés dans un rêve fiévreux. Il se réveille sous l'eau, la bouche ensanglantée. Ouvre les yeux, Roy. Il fait l'erreur de l'amener dans un bar une fois. Il n'est pas vraiment sûr de ce quoi il pensait, elle peut le dire par le battement de ses cils contre sa joue, par le froncement de ses sourcils et par la tension des traits de son visage. Roy sort une cigarette de son paquet, l'allume – le revêtement du bar brille comme du bel acajou et les cheveux d'Alexandria sont détachés, il y a une bouteille de soda devant elle, avec une paille. De toutes les choses qu'elle pourrait boire. « La prohibition a été abolie il y a quelques années seulement. » lui fait-il remarquer, il ne la quitte pas des yeux lorsqu'il tire sur sa cigarette, comme s'il attendait qu'elle lui dise d'arrêter. Comme la plupart des femmes font. Lorsqu'elles ne lui demandent pas si elles peuvent essayer de fumer elles aussi. « Et pour certains, elle n'a même jamais existé. » « Tu parles de toi, Roy ? » elle penche la tête, les yeux brillants à travers le nuage de fumée. Bien sûr, elle savait qu'il fumait, qu'il buvait, chaque homme avait ses faiblesses, que d'autres nommeraient vices. Mais Roy n'a pas de vices aux yeux d'Alexandria, il peut être bête, il peut se montrer parfois égoïste, ou coupable mais il a cette façon de cligner de yeux et de lui sourire, un tressautement des lèvres comme s'il était grisé ou enchanté en un instant. Ça ne lui ferait pas grand chose d'arrêter de fumer. Lorsqu'elle pose sa tête contre son épaule le soir au parc, la manche de sa chemise est toujours blanche et propre, avec cette légère odeur du tabac à rouler qu'il utilise, chaude comme du bois brûlé – réelle. « Bien sûr. » Sa bouche sursaute alors, un rictus, bien vite remplacé par un large sourire. « Le soda et moi on ne s'entend pas assez bien pour passer la soirée ensemble. » Il y a un éclat sur sa peau, sous la lumière du bar, c'est chaud et fait briller sa peau là où les deux premiers boutons de sa chemise sont défaits. Ses mains halées sont posées sur la table, son corps est entièrement tourné vers elle. Tequila. Du courage liquide, peut-être. Ou juste une solution contre la douleur. La seule chose qu'elle puisse faire est de l'empêcher de se laisser empoisonner. « Qu'est-ce que ça fait ? » « Pas grand chose. Ce n'est pas vraiment différent. » « Est-ce que … ça te manquerait ? » Ses jambes sont croisés aux chevilles. Il tire sur le col de sa chemise, la chaleur de cette nuit californienne les étouffant. Elle le regarde boire un shot comme si c'était de l'eau aromatisée. Ça ne le désaltère pas, vu la façon qu'il a de regarder son verre vide, les sourcils légèrement froncés. « … beaucoup ? » « Non. » Elle n'arrive pas à savoir s'il ment. Ce n'est plus si facile de le jauger, maintenant qu'elle n'a plus cinq ans. Et elle a déposé quelques gouttes de parfum de pêche derrière ses oreilles, et sa robe est jolie – elle n'a plus cinq ans. Et lorsqu'ils sont à sa porte, il presse une grosse enveloppe de papier brun dans ses mains. C'est lourd. Il est éméché, toutefois il a conduit méticuleusement sur le chemin du retour. Mais ses yeux sont fiévreux, et il est tellement grand. Et son soda n'est pas suffisamment fort pour lui faire oublier pourquoi elle l'a laissé venir aussi près de la porte, sa tante pourrait la reprendre pour cela. Alexandria a dépassé depuis bien longtemps tous les couvre-feu. « Quoi- » « Ça y est. Tout est là, » dit-il, son offrande dans les mains d'Alexandria. « Prends-le. Je ne pensais pas que je le finirai un jour, ça m'a pris des semaines pour l'arranger. Ça fait des années que je le garde au fond de mon tiroir. Je n'ai jamais oublié. Alexandria, et quand je t'ai vu à nouveau, comment pouvais-je ne pas le finir ? » Elle se retient, elle ne doit pas lui faire la morale. Elle doit l'écouter et être douce avec lui, depuis qu'il lui a admis qu'il ne ferai plus de cascades, qu'il arrêtait. Depuis qu'il lui a dit que peu de cascadeurs continuaient jusqu'à son âge. « Merci. » « Lis-le. En entier. » Tu me le promets ? « Je le ferai. » Oui. Et puis, il y a cet instant exaltant où le cœur d'Alexandria s'arrête, et où ils réalisent tout les deux à quel point ils sont proches l'un et l'autre. Le silence n'en est pas vraiment un, parce que chaque étoile dans le ciel semble chuchoter par dessus la respiration de Roy et celle qu'Alexandria retient au fond de sa gorge. Roy est tellement grand. Sa tête est penché vers elle. Elle sent son sang affluer sous ses joues, comme un coup de soleil d'été. Étrange. Elle se rend compte seulement maintenant que ses yeux sont plus gris que verts. Et ce doux parfum acidulé du citron de sa tequila qui ne l'a pas désaltéré, qui n'a pas baissé sa fièvre. Il pourrait l'embrasser à cet instant … il pourrait … il pourrait- « Tu rentres ? » Elle les ramène tous les deux à la raison. Roy se recule un peu, et ouvre la bouche, hésite, la ferme. Et puis. « Ta parente ? » Sa tante ? Qu'elle aille en enfer. « C'est bon. Tu es soûl. » « Pas vraiment. » Et ils le savent tous les deux. « Éméché, tout au plus. Pas soûl, jeune fille au soda. » Il attrape quelques mèches de ses cheveux, ses doigts juste un peu lents, prouvant sa coordination. Il pourrait poser son menton sur le haut de la tête d'Alexandria, si il se le permettrait. « Alexandria, tu es intelligente. Non, je ne rentrerai pas. Je ne sais pas pourquoi tu as demandé. » Elle ne sait pas non plus. Il se recule à nouveau, il la fixe en clignant lentement des yeux, et lui sourit – elle n'est pas assez cruelle pour l'embrasser sur la joue comme elle l'aurait fait habituellement, c'est devenu presque trop naturel pour elle de le blesser sans le vouloir. Alexandria s'enferme derrière la porte. Elle déchire le haut de l'enveloppe avant même d'entendre le moteur s'allumer et le bruit des roues sur la route. Très bien, ferme les yeux. Que vois-tu ? Rien. Frotte-les. . . . Vois-tu les étoiles ? Chaque feuille de papier est comme de la cendre contre sa peau, les mots sont peints avec le sang de l'âme de Roy, par une plume capable de rassembler les morceaux brisés de la cage thoracique d'un moineau. Sans effort, avec brio. Roy. Il y a les cinq hommes, qui sont au final des parties de l'esprit de Roy. Otta Benga, Darwin, Luigi, l'Indien, le Mystique et le Bandit, même Odius. Une aventure, une légende brûlante, et une histoire d'amour pas si romantique que cela, écrite dans le désert au couché du soleil. Des langues et des mots, qu'un écrivain plongé dans son livre ne pourrait même pas capturer. Le vrombissement d'un lasso dorée qui fend les airs avec un tranchant brûlant, coupant la lune en deux lorsqu'il passe devant. Son Roy, son bandit, pour qui elle est prête à s'abandonner, à complètement s'abandonner dans ses souvenirs et dans son âme d'enfant. Comme un souffle humide, la pluie s'abat. Elle lit ce passage à propos des longs brins d'herbe verte, ceux qui effleurent la peau des jambes nues, qui chatouillent lorsqu'on y danse. Et cette cité bleue, miroir parfait du ciel, des constructions méditerranéennes, des morceaux d'océans, dômes marquant le paysage. Le mouvement lent et tourbillonnant des truites dans un ruisseaux, passant de l'argenté au noir. Le voile de sang volant au dessus du champ de bataille, lourd et léger à la fois, comme des légendes et de l'amertume. Des nymphes surprises dans leur nudité. Des guerriers combattant le Léviathan. Des dames portant leurs mouchoirs de soie parfumés sur leurs bouches pour se protéger d'une chaleur ardente, s'éventant le cou de leurs longs doigts peints. Tellement vivant, tellement vivant. Roy qui la regardait chaque jour comme si elle comptait. Comme si elle comptait réellement. Comme si elle ne pouvait pas se dissoudre, insoluble dans la médiocrité de la ville. Comme le soleil, on ne pouvait lui faire face. Roy, dont le cœur est authentique, comme un roc, comme cette petite sphère de lumière dans le ciel, trop brûlante pour être attrapée, pourtant Alexandria lève la main, haute et ouverte contre le soleil, et dans ses petites mains il pourrait sombrer. Mais jamais s'y éteindre. Ses épais sourcils, dansant comme les ailes d'un oiseau. Lui, qui descend sa tequila comme s'il ne pouvait jamais s'en satisfaire, mais qui continue d'essayer malgré tout. Qui lui parle, à elle, sa fille-bandit, sa rêverie d'enfant, il est perdu en Alexandria. Elle, qui avec ses bras tendus vers le ciel, tourne et danse dans une ronde infinie sous l'ombre des arbres, qui s'élance dans des mouvements à couper le souffle, dans les mots flamboyants et luxuriants de leurs imaginaires fantastiques. Moquée par les ondoiements d'une peau d'orange s'enroulant autour de son couteau et de ses doigts, s'ouvrant au monde, les arrosant de jus acidulé. Roy qui la voyait si brillante, qui la peignait avec des mots si magnifiques que même Mona Lisa en deviendrait jalouse, qui lui vouait une adoration si intense, une adulation douce-amère et un amour, amour, amour. Et Alexandria ne pourra jamais ouvrir ses bras à quelqu'un d'autre, parce qu'elle n'a jamais pu l'oublier et le laisser s'en aller. Son héros, son pèreamiamourhéros , conquérant. Qui est tellement, tellement Roy. Ses yeux tremblent, mais il est déterminé et courageux – il brise ses limites et l'embrasse enfin le jour suivant, il vole les dernières bribes de son souffle coupé. Ses lèvres sont chaudes, comme celle d'un homme perdu dans le désert, couvert de sable et la peau craquelée. Il l'embrasse comme si elle était un oasis au milieu de ce désert, comme si sa vie en dépendait. Son conteur, son menteur, profondément confus, et pourtant si sûr de lui, et pourtant perdu, son je-suis-perdu-sans-toi Roy . « Les bon bandits, » lui dit-il, comme si elle comprenait. Et elle comprend. « Sont volages et sournois comme des voleurs, donc ne me quitte jamais. » Elle lui tend son auriculaire pour lui promettre, comme s'ils étaient encore des enfants jouant avec des petites pièces et des billes. Elle clos le serment, grimpant sur ses pieds, pointes des orteils contre le cuir de ses chaussures, elle brise leur différence de taille. Scelle la distance. On forme une drôle de paire, pas vrai ? . . .

Note: This story takes place twenty years after the movie. Prologue \"Look, we've researched this out perfectly. We attract a few sharks, feed them some fish, they swim around you, we get the shot, and you're out of the water in minutes.\" \"It isn't so much the being in the water, Johan. It's the teeth. Big sharp pointy...\" Roy replied as he looked over the side of the boat... watching as various fins circled round and round. He swallowed the fear in his throat. \"I mean, this isn't like jumping off a moving car, you know. I have no control of those things down there. Teeth, Johan. Flesh ripping teeth.\" But the one-legged actor just clapped his friend on the back. \"You'll be fine, my boy. You've been in this business long enough to know...\" \"...a stupid stunt when I see one.\" Roy interrupted with a grumble, running long fingers through short messy brown hair that was just starting to grey at the temples. \"You know I hate animal stunts...\" he pouted. \"No you hate horse stunts.\" the older man shot back, grabbing a blue rope the color of the ocean and beginning to tie it around Walker's stomach and hips. \"Just a few minutes. Flail around. Let the camera get the shot. And I'll pull you right out. Promise.\" For a moment, Roy hesitated, biting his lip. He knew this was stupid... but he also knew that they were filming a boat picture and they needed the footage of a deck-hand being washed overboard. So here he was, standing on the side of a fishing boat dressed like a British sailor turned rugged pirate, and about to jump into shark infested water. He didn't know the names of the sharks, though someone had said something about Dusky and Blacktip and Silvertip sharks. To Roy... a shark was a shark... and a shark had teeth perfect for ripping into it's prey. \"Look they're not that big, Roy. Only seven or so feet.\" \"Only?!\" the man replied, looking over his shoulder at Johan as if he were insane. \"Sure. They get bigger. That research marine guy, whatshisname, said some of them could be ten or twelve feet.\" Roy felt his grip on sanity slipped and he grabbed the railing hard, knuckles turning white. He didn't want to do this! He was going to die this time for sure! For a moment the man thought he would either faint or be sick... but then he felt the rope tighten around his body and Johan give it a little jerk. \"Alright. Now hop in and we'll roll the camera.\" He hesitated... and that hesitation was soon pushed away as he himself was literally shoved overboard. The cameras were already rolling and Roy couldn't help the shout of surprise that left his lips. Least it was realistic fear for these new-fangled talking pictures. He hit the water hard, going down until his body bobbed back up and his arms flailed. Roy really had no idea how to swim. So he tried everything he could just to stay above the surf of Santa Monica Bay, paddling and flapping like a drowning baby bird and gulping in air when he could. The sharks surrounded him swiftly, drawn to the sound of slapping on the water. They circled and bumped and hit him with quick tails. Luckily, Roy was covered from neck to wrists and shoulders to toes in stronger than normal clothes... which while they weighted him down even more, at least protected him from the denticles on the skin of the sharks. His hand slapped one on the nose and it jerked away, rubbing his fingers raw. For a moment the man thought he'd been bitten, but there was no blood, just red skin. Gulping in more air, Roy started to sink so he frantically kicked his legs, keeping his head just above the surface... until a sea swell slammed into his face. He spit water out, gasping for air again. On the boat the camera was rolling and the footage really was spectacular... but then the cameraman noticed something odd. \"The sharks are leaving.\" he said to Johan quietly, who also had noticed this. They almost had enough footage though, so the one-legged actor figured that just a few more seconds and he'd haul Walker in by the rope quick. Then they heard it... Roy screamed, a blood curdling sound, before being dragged under the water amidst a sea of blood. Johan grabbed the rope with both hands, pulling hard. The cameraman left the camera rolling and grasped the lifeline too, trying to haul the stuntman out of the water. But the stain of blood on the ocean's surface only grew larger... and there was no sign of Roy... TEETH To Be Continued... Author's Notes: - The character of the One-Legged Actor from \"The Fall\" doesn't have a name (in Roy's story he's Luigi of course) so I looked up Robin Smith's filmography (Luigi's actor) and picked the name Johan (which is the name of the character he plays in \"Invictus\" ). - I ran into a shark problem... Dusky sharks are found in the area of this story but Silvertips and Blacktips aren't quite in the same area. So what I'm doing is using the tip sharks (because they're more likely to congregate like I need for this story) anyway because I need sharks that aren't going to eat Roy in one bite for this \"man overboard\" scene he's filming. I was going to use Salmon sharks too but decided against that due to their diet. So sorry for being a bit incorrect on the true habitats of these smaller sharks. - I got the idea for this story after watching \"Spawn of Jaws: The Birth\" during Discovery Channel's \"Shark Week 2014\" . I'm a huge shark fanatic and have been watching \"Shark Week\" since it started in 1987 (when I was 2 years old hahaha). I thought to myself, \"Roy needs to be attacked by a shark!\" hahahaha... sorry Roy... Muse Moments: \"I feel so free...\" Legolas says, laying on the sofa happily. Nil smirks, \"Because I'm not torturing you lately?\" \"Yes!\" he replies with a laugh. \"You have not hurt me all month, even with everything you have written.\" \"Nope. Just Lee Pace characters.\" she says, still smirking. Suddenly Legolas blinks, noticing that smirk. \"Nil... what are you working on next?\" But the woman turns and just walks away. \"NIL!\" groaning, Legolas falls back on the sofa. \"She will torture me next... I know it... ugh...\" ","Summary":" Title: \"Teeth\" Author: LegolasLover2003 aka Ashley Category: Movie - \"The Fall\" Genre: Angst / "},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"The Princess And The Red Bandit","Author":"Faeriessence","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10046473","Passage":"[Chapter 1] REVISED- Feb 1, 2015 So I have just recently watched this unique piece of art which is 'the Fall'. Honestly, I wasn't sure of the direction of this one-shot but I just wanted to make it due to something I was rooting for. Now, after reading, you'd probably be asking why I would want anything between Roy Walker and Nurse Evelyn. I know that it's typical and it would have distracted all of us from the truth behind this remarkable film but anyway, it's a fanfiction. So yeah. Take it anyway you like. Nearly one and a half months had passed since she fell. Since that very day that brave little bandit had fallen. She had paid the price for stealing the morphine he had been so desperately trying to take. And the painful reminder was the bandages wrapped around her small head. Roy had always regretted what he had done. Not because a sense of morality told him it was wrong but because in the process, his little friend got hurt. The stuntman had often thought of the incident and sometimes came across the nonexistent reality of Alexandria not being around anymore. It scared him a whole lot more than what had scared him in the recent months-with his job, his long gone fiancée and of course his idiotic and bold attempt to impress said ex-lover. For weeks, they were both placed under probation and were separated from each other. The longer it took, the more restless both Roy and Alexandria grew. At such time, Roy became persistent; he begged the staff to allow the little girl to visit him. Meanwhile Alexandria had had several attempts of sneaking out of her own ward. Fortunately, time was all it took. Eventually, the hospital staff was convinced that it was Alexandria that saved him. Knowing the true nature of their relationship, and seeing that the young man no longer had the desire to kill himself, the staff gave in. So here she was, sitting next to the stuntman in his hospital bed- grinning innocently with all that missing baby teeth. Roy admitted that he loved the little girl. And this little girl had finally given him a reason to live. It had devastated him when he saw his latest act-his bold yet disastrous stunt, had been cut off from the film. He worked hard to get into the damn business. Yet it was always easy for business to overlook that. For a time, he felt loss, anger, hurt. Then he let it go . Roy didn't want to let negative things bother him now, especially not when Alexandria was reading to him some of the cut-out notes she had been throwing into his window the past few weeks. The storyteller smiled and this time, it was him who was listening to the little girl's tall tales, not at all minding the others in the ward and not at all noticing the nurse that had been eyeing the pair for a few days now. … It was time for her shift. She looked into the mirror and picked up the old lipstick she had often carried in her pocket. She twisted the little tube and was about to rub her finger on the red colouring when she realized that something, rather , someone was missing. Nurse Evelyn found herself to be alone in the nurse's quarters. Strange, but supposedly Alexandria would have visited her today. She also noticed that the little girl no longer sent her any of her little letters. It was no big deal really. Patients come and go; she shouldn't be all too concerned about this particular one. Yet, she did grow fond of Alexandria, and the sudden distance between them made her curious. Before, the little daydreamer would do all she could to keep a good conversation but now, all there was between them were brief moments where they exchanged a few sentences; most of the time it ended with Alexandria scampering off to the side of the building. Each morning, right on schedule, Evelyn would go check on the children's ward, just in time for her to catch the girl getting ready to go out the door every time. \" Alexandria, no running. I don't want you to hurt your head again.\" She said, stopping Alexandria in her tracks. \" No, I won't. That was only one time. And it was soo dark.\" The tot insisted. She was jumpy, obviously eager to dash out of the ward that very moment. Evelyn did not bother to ask why at the time. But why didn't she? To put it simply, she didn't really care. Being with the little girl had always been more or less, a routine. The nurse had met many others her age and Alexandria, well, she was just another patient to Evelyn. She did not like to think so, but she had taken their relationship for granted. It was Alexandria who would go look for her and tell her to read her letters. The same little girl who would sneak into the staff's rooms and ask her a whole bunch of silly things and the same one who would ask her to hold her at night. So the lack of this little chipper's presence got her thinking. That spunky child had always talked about a certain patient somewhere in the hospital. Alexandria had once mentioned a friend of hers in the other ward. Evelyn had once told her she would come and see this 'Roy'. But she never did. It was not a promise she expected herself to keep. At the time, it was just an effort to get the little girl to listen. It looked like she would be keeping that promise after all. … Evelyn decided to go into his ward. She was not stationed there but she easily blended with the nurses and residents who were. The young woman snuck a peak at the pair that was busy talking, keeping to themselves. She made sure they would not notice, glancing once in a long while. The two would smile, laugh, and by the looks of it, Roy was telling Alexandria stories. She could see it in the way his expression changes and the hand gestures he made. Those two were by far an odd pairing, Evelyn mused. It was as though they had life's greatest secrets all to themselves as they spoke in their hushed tones. Evelyn couldn't help but smile. It was truly endearing and all the more fascinating. Yes, she had heard about the stuntmen and his tendencies, and about what he had made Alexandria do. She was not at all interested with the talks that went around the hospital but it was a wonder to see this innocent little girl helping him recover and cope with whatever problems that weighed down on his soul. Whatever happened between them must have been something . … Days passed and she had gone unseen. The nurse knew not to enter the room too often. She was sure Alexandria would call her attention once the little girl spotted her. Evelyn had resulted to passing by the ward more often, taking side glances at the window near Roy's bed. This was silly. Evelyn had not the slightest clue as to why she was carrying out her observation. All she knew was that she was curious. Alright, intrigued . Sometimes, she would stop in her tracks to listen to them, hidden behind the window, and at some point, she wanted to hear the stories too, but she had duties to take care of. For weeks , she kept a close eye on the two and not once did they notice. But that was until she came into the ward with a group of staff one day and she had stared for far too long. She had been helping out with the linen that needed changing for an incoming patient. She looked up and saw Alexandria and Roy casually lounging in his bed. The man was creating hand gestures that she could not decipher but she was sure it was another one of his fantasy stories for it made the little girl smile widely. It seemed she couldn't stop herself from trying to make out what he was saying to the child. Her curiosity got the best of her and consequently, she did not go unnoticed this time. It was Roy who saw her. His wide happy grin faded slightly as their eyes locked. Evelyn, who had been too drawn in to their inaudible conversation, was not so quick to hide her stare. She felt a small hint of embarrassment and looked down, continuing with the work. Hurriedly, she finished and walked out, not looking back at the man who watched her take her leave. That night was her shift at the children's ward. All the patients had been tucked in their beds, all except one. As usual, Alexandria was sitting up on hers, looking out the window. \"Alexandria, it's time to get some rest.\" Evelyn said, a little hesitant at first. \"Roy told me he saw you today.\" The little girl replied flatly, still fixated on the farm outside. Evelyn was surprised. But she smirked right after. \"Yes. I was in his ward to help out with the other nurses.\" She smiled as she held the little girl's shoulders and pulled her into a sleeping position. \"Do you want to hear the stories too?\" Alexandria said as she rubbed her eyes. Evelyn's smile widened at her humble offer. \"Maybe some other time, alright? Right now, you should sleep so your head will get better.\" She said as she gently tilted the little girl's chin upwards. Alexandria simply nodded, staring at the woman in what seemed so profoundly. Then the nurse saw it. The spirit in her eyes, the story behind them. She was five years of age, yet the woman saw what felt was an old soul, filled with timeless mystery. It left Evelyn perplexed; her smile soon faded into a straight line as their eyes locked. This little girl had managed to change a man's life. \"You know, Roy is very lucky to have a friend like you.\" She spoke silently. The little girl was on the verge of sleep, but she managed to turn her head up with a 'hm'. \"I mean, I've heard about how he's getting better because of you.\" She said as her smile returned once more. \"But all we do is tell stories.\" She replied drowsily. \"You're a brave little girl Alexandria. But you got to also be more careful, little missy.\" She reproved, giggling in the end as she gently placed a hand on the girl's head. Alexandria smiled in acknowledgement and finally closed her eyes, giving Evelyn the chance to take her leave. By the time she had reached the doorway, she looked back, seeing Alexandria facing the other way, now asleep. \"Evelyn.\" The sound of his voice made her head turn but its familiarity did not surprise her. It was the doctor. \"Hey.\" She smiled softly and in turn so did he, right before he kissed her. \"You seem to like that little girl a lot.\" He broke off, leaning his forehead on hers. \"Her name.\" She paused, smoothing his collar. \"Is Alexandria. She's a smart kid.\" Evelyn turned to look at the child and the bandages on her head. \"In fact, too smart for her own good.\" She added, hinting a bit of remorse. \"Shouldn't you be doing rounds?\" She spoke, turning back to the doctor with a raised brow. \"I still got a few minutes.\" He replied as he pulled her closer. She chuckled lightly, aware of his intentions. The man simply gave her a beguiling smile. With that, Evelyn kissed him once more. … For the next few days, Evelyn decided not to have anything to do with the strange pair. After that little incident, the prospect of entering the ward made her feel rather awkward-more so because it was that Roy who caught her looking. And he knew who she was. So they, but most likely he knew what she was up to all along. One morning came and nothing was short of chaotic. A group of men- construction workers-had been rushed into the hospital and were taken to the emergency room. There had been an accident at a new building site. Although they were only a few, they had sustained injuries that were far too severe for regular circumstances. Almost all the doctors and nurses had to pitch in and the blood everywhere meant it was going to take a whole lot more than painkillers and medication. \"Ev!\" A frantic nurse ran to her colleague on the porch outside the wards. Evelyn frowned in confusion as her co-worker walked up to her. \"Wha-\" \"It's a mess in the ER! I really got to go. Please, could you take these to Ward ten? Mister Watterson asked for some tea.\" Without waiting for a reply, the shaken nurse practically shoved the tray into her arms. \"Oh, and take care of any leftovers!\" She yelled as she ran. But as Evelyn opened her mouth to speak, the other nurse had already dashed out of sight. Ten? Isn't that… Left with no choice, Evelyn decided to do just as she was told. … As she entered the room, she saw her patient- a frail old man raising a skinny arm at her. Passing down the aisle, Evelyn looked to her right. He had his eyes closed, with a book in his hand. Her guess was that he must've fallen asleep earlier, surprisingly, with the entire buzz that's been going on in the other building. \"Thank you.\" The old patient whispered, taking with her the tray and a plate of his leftovers. Seeing that she had nothing left to do, the young nurse made her way towards the exit; holding the stainless steel dish carefully in her arms. \"I don't see you come here often.\" Startled by the unexpected and incredibly blunt remark, she accidentally dropped the tray. \"Shit.\" Wide-eyed and humiliated, Evelyn hurriedly picked up the utensils and apparently some of the dignity she had dropped along with them. \"Huh, I didn't know nuns could cuss.\" Evelyn scoffed as she heard him from behind her. Without looking, she could already imagine the lopsided smile of amusement. \"I'm not a nun. I'm just a nurse here.\" She said, quickly regaining composure. She stood up, stoic and rigid and turned towards the young man whose shoulders were bouncing up and down in silent laughter. \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.\" Roy replied, still recovering from the hilarity he witnessed earlier. \"It's alright.\" She said nonchalantly. She could not understand how she could feel nervous in this situation. Evelyn quickly noticed the empty china cup on his bedside and walked over to it. \"May I?\" After nodding in approval, Roy silently watched her pick up the ceramic and place it on the tray. \"So, where's Alexandria?\" She said, looking down at her work. \"She went out to look for some more oranges.\" He replied. \"Well, I'll have to go look for her. We just ran out.\" Evelyn had her eyes cast downwards for most of the time until she was finished and ready to leave. Just as she was walking out, as she was thinking she was off the hook, he called out- much to her chagrin. \"You've been watching us.\" His straightforwardness had stopped her in her tracks. Silently, she scoffed. \"No, I wasn't.\" She turned around, immediately defensive. \"Yes. You were.\" Roy insisted. \"Just a few days ago. I admit, you're good; I didn't know it for a while. But no other nurse comes here as often as you do, not counting the ones who are actually stationed here.\" \"How sure are you?\" She tested him. \"Hundred percent. You're on the defensive here, plus you talk like I know you.\" Roy shrugged. At this point, he knew she could no longer come up with excuses. \"Hmph. Alright. So what if I've had?\" She gave up and smirked. \"Nothing. Just wondering why.\" Evelyn looked down at his naïve expression then smiled crookedly. \" Actually, I was just curious as to why Alexandria had stopped giving me her letters. She also stopped talking to me. Just wanted to see what she's been up to.\" \"And you're worried?\" \"No, just curious, is all. Is that a problem?\" Evelyn replied as she took a seat at his bedside, looking at him with one brow raised. Roy smiled and shook his head. \"No, it's not.\" She looked at him and saw that he had returned to reading his book. Hesitantly, she spoke. \"Your name is Roy, am I right?\" \"Mhm. How did you know?\" He replied flatly, engrossed with his book. \"Alexandria likes to talk about you.\" Roy smirked as he continued to read. But from the soft smile he had on for a long while after, Evelyn learned just how much that the little girl meant to him. \"And you're nurse Evelyn.\" He said. \"How'd you-\" She paused then remembered. \"Alexandria.\" She said as Roy placed down his book to look at her. \"You know, you're her favourite nurse.\" He said, turning to her with a knowing smile. Evelyn smiled too, albeit sheepishly. \"I didn't really know that.\" For a few moments she didn't say anything else but for some reason, she wanted to stay and talk some more. \"I've heard about what happened between the two of you.\" She continued. Roy froze as he remembered what had happened. He suddenly felt troubled coming up with anything to say. Finally, as his heart sank, he replied. \" I didn't mean to ever hurt her. I just wanted to get her to do something for me.\" His pained expression made her regret asking. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't poke into other people's business.\" Evelyn looked at how Roy breathed in deeply, pausing before he spoke. \"It's okay. I just, shouldn't have done that to her.\" \"Well, people make mistakes all the time. You could..\" Evelyn trailed off, trying to find the right words to ease the tension he was building up. \"learn from those mistakes and start over.\" She finally said and smiled. She mentally kicked herself for coming up with such 'eloquent' advice. \"Yep. Never ask a five year old to get morphine from the Dispensary.\" He laughed dryly. Evelyn's eyes grew wide, disturbed by the man's resolution and weird dark sense of humour. Seeing her appalled look, he countered the earlier quip. \"I'm joking. I love that kid. She's very brave. Witty too.\" A little relieved, Evelyn shook her head and smirked. \" Little bandit .\" She murmured. \"What did you just say?\" Roy quirked a brow. He began to prop himself up into a comfortable sitting position. \"Huh? What?\" Evelyn muttered, unaware that she had sparked his interest. \"You just called her 'little bandit'.\" \"Oh, um…\" Roy's smile grew as it dawned on him. \"You've also been listening in on our conversations, haven't you?\" \"It's hard not to.\" She admitted. Roy was grinning from ear to ear. Someone else had also been listening to his stories. His smile softened as he nodded. \"I made up a story once, with a princess in it. Alexandria made you that princess.\" \"Hah. No way. Did she now? What did she make you?\" She said. \"I was… the 'Red Bandit'.\" Roy replied, making grand gestures that made the nurse laugh. He seemed to have had a thing for theatrics. Of course, what could one expect from a man in showbiz? \"She really is something, Roy.\" Evelyn said as she shook her head with amusement. \"Yes, she is.\" He said, solemnity making its way back into their conversation. \"Honestly, I never knew how special she really was.\" Evelyn spoke lowly. \"All kids are special.\" \"Yeah. I know... What I mean was, I used to think all kids think the same way.\" Evelyn continued, idly looking at the opposite wall. \"But Alexandria. I never really noticed it before, but, there's something strangely surreal about her. I think you know that more than I do.\" She turned towards him. She had not realized that the man had leaned in a little closer. \"She saved my life.\" Roy quietly spoke. In return, Evelyn could only look back at the unfathomable expression in his eyes. She knew the story and he told her how it ended. The two shared a quiet moment, staring at one another. \"Evelyn.\" A voice called out from the doorway, breaking the silence. The doctor stood by the door, panting and disheveled- no doubt caused by the chaos around the hospital. \"We need more staff down at the ER.\" He said. \"Oh, alright, I'll be right there. Let me take care of this first.\" She replied, holding up the tray. As soon as he left, Evelyn turned to Roy. \"Um, I'm sorry, I have to leave.. He's my- I mean the\" \"Your boyfriend.\" Roy stated; the intensity in eyes, wiped off. Confused, she was about to ask when he immediately answered. \"Alexandria.\" \"Oh, okay. I've got to go.\" Evelyn said as she reached the door. Roy exhaled, going back to his proper sitting position and holding up his book. \"Um, Roy?\" She spoke tentatively. Once more, he looked up, brows raised in question. \"It was nice talking to you. And, about what you said, I don't think you should keep blaming yourself. I know that she cares about you very much. So make it count. \" Evelyn smiled at him reassuringly before she walked out. As she made her way outside, the young nurse couldn't help but feel sentimental towards their meaningful conversation. Roy, whom she had left so suddenly, frowned as he pondered at what she had told him. What the princess had just told the red bandit. It seemed that he was looking forward to meeting her some other time- soon, he hoped. Not long after, the center of their talk had finally returned with an apple in her hand. \"They ran out of oranges.\" She said, having the same naïve expression she had always carried. Roy took the apple and contemplated for a bit. He turned to his little friend, seeing the innocence in her eyes and the soulfulness of it. Smiling to himself and making room for Alexandria, he knew he had to make it count. ","Summary":" REVISED- Feb 1, 2015 So I have just recently watched this unique piece of art which is 'the Fall'.

Thirteen years later, the stories have changed. Win the Battle, Lose the War Roy can't do this anymore. In his life he's practiced offensive disappointment: he's chosen his defeats in the hopes that victories will align themselves to make up for the deficit. It doesn't always work out. But he's done it so often it's become a habit, and now, with the urge skimming the underside of his skin, he can't quite turn it down. He's on his way out, anyway; Hollywood makes and breaks you, they say, kisses and kills you. There isn't much call for a broken stuntman. And thirty-six, well, thirty-six is just a year, an age, a number. Till you tell it to people and they get leery-eyed and start to bluster. He looks younger, maybe, which is why he can fool them up to a point. But he's long since given up on lying, and thirty-six is too old to take falls without worry, especially when you've been doing so for thirteen years. So he takes the plunge. He chooses his defeat. He quits before they can fire him, and retreats into a hotel room that's all paid up for the week. He sits on the bed and only moves to scratch where it itches, feels his beard come slowly spooling out of his skin. His hair is cut trim, to match the hero he was meant to be stunting for. His face is gently haggard for thirty-six, the small scar under his right eye the oldest but by no means the only mar. He'll have to find something else to do, he knows, but in the meantime— in the meantime, a little rest, a little stillness. He looks down at his feet, twitches his toes to reassure himself he's still got mobility. Eventually he sleeps. When he wakes up fully, it's a few days later and the once-weekly maid is knocking on the door. He has one more day before he has to vacate or pay up, and he's still undecided as to which he'll do. Things have not aligned themselves while he was dreaming. His mouth is dry and he suddenly, irrationally, craves oranges. The knock comes again. His mouth creaks when he opens it and he can practically feel the whisper of dust falling from his lips. \"Yeah.\" \"I'm here to clean.\" A female voice, clearly accented but understandable nonetheless. Roy glances around himself and grunts slightly. So he's not the neatest guy. That's what maids are for. \"Can't you wait till after I leave?\" Though he's still unsure whether he's going to. \"No I can't wait till after you leave, this is my job. I have to clean today because tomorrow I have to clean somewhere else, and the day after that somewhere else—\" \"Alright, alright.\" He stands up, moves towards the door. \"— and I won't be back here till next week and someone else will be here, so I have to clean now or it won't get done.\" \"Okay! I get it.\" He pulls it open; he never bothers to lock doors or windows. The only thing of value that's ever in his rooms is himself, and he's debatable. He barely spares the girl a glance— she's young, small, dark-haired, and her voice matches her exactly— backs up, away, and sinks into a chair in the corner. The room is tiny and her voice fills it as she bustles busily around, stripping the bed with concise movements born of long practice. \"It wouldn't be very nice, to leave a mess for the next person. I'm in a hurry, you understand, I have this whole row to do on my own.\" Her incessant chatter brushes the edges of his mind but doesn't penetrate deep enough for recall. He gives her a frowning glance of concentration, but she's turned away from him and all he can grasp is the fall of her hair over her back, over her shoulders as she bends over the bed. \"Well, I'm sorry,\" he tells her. \"You woke me up is all.\" \"When I'm done with this,\" she says, \"with all the rooms, I am going to the movies.\" This startles a laugh out of him, wry and sideways. \"That a fact? Well, it's nice to have a plan.\" \"And what I'm going to do someday,\" she says, because he's there and listening, and in her excitement she stands and turns towards him and he sees that her eyes are a soft grey-blue a split second before she says, \"Roy!\" and jumps on him. Her weight jolts him, slight as she is, and since she starts to slide off his lap she grabs onto his shoulders and his arm is around her waist before he even realizes it. She grins into his face, runs the tip of one finger around his ear. He says, bewildered, \"What?\" \"You don't recognize me?\" \"Recognize you—\" But he does, of course, because this is the much older version, the grown version, of a girl he once knew, thirteen years before, and a girl he still knew, every once in a while, sidling with a huge grin through his better dreams. \"Alexandria?\" \"Alexandria the Great,\" she says, and her smile is the same as it was all those years ago. She puts a hand on either side of his face and holds him still, looking him over carefully with a proprietorial air, as though checking to see how he's been using himself. Assessing the damage, the miles. \"You're still here.\" It's a secret to herself, a triumph and a pleasure; his life means more to her now than it ever did to him. \"And you can—\" She bounds off his lap. \"Stand up. Up.\" So he does, holds his arms out at his sides and does a slow twirl for her benefit, and for her amusement, a little soft-shoe shuffle. She laughs, claps, throws her arms around him. \"I've been wondering about you,\" he murmurs into her hair. \"I knew you must have grown up, some, but I guess I didn't realize how long it had been.\" \"A long time,\" she says helpfully, and lets him go. She beams up at him. \"You're taller than I remember.\" \"That's because you were five,\" he says, and slides his hands into his pockets. \"And because you only ever saw me lying down.\" \"And sitting. Once.\" \"And sitting,\" he agrees. He looks her over, with not quite the same proprietorial air but something similar. Her advancement owes nothing to him, while his life owes everything to her. She's benefitted from years. Her English is no longer broken, but rolls out like a carpet from her lips, smooth. The accent is still there, but more as a side course, less of a main dish. \"Thirteen years, that makes you— eighteen.\" \"Nineteen. I just turned.\" \"Oh yeah?\" \"I got a dog. To keep burglars away.\" \"Oh yeah?\" he says again, and subsides back into the chair, but she takes his hand and tugs till he stands up again, then maneuvers him around so she can sit, with him standing, facing her. \"You've been here for over a month, and I didn't realize. I wish I had known earlier.\" \"I wish you had too,\" he says. \"I would have liked to have a friend. How long have you been working here?\" She considers, and gives a shrug. \"A few years. I worked in the groves till I was fifteen, then they sent me back into the city.\" \"They sent you?\" She hesitates, but she doesn't like lying. \"I asked. The doctor, all those years ago, you remember the doctor?\" \"I remember him.\" \"He said if I worked in the groves after my arm healed I would stay there my whole life, and, well, and I wanted to prove him wrong. So I asked to be sent into the city to find a job here, and so I came. This is nice,\" she assures him, anxiously. \"I get the evenings off. I go to the movies.\" She dips her head, in some embarrassment. \"I watched for you.\" He smiles. \"How've you been?\" he asks softly. In answer she lifts her arm, to the position it held for long months in the hospital, supported and stiff in a cast. She won't say anything and after a long moment he nods. \"Well. I'm sorry.\" She lowers her arm, shakes herself out of it. \"Are you in a new movie? Will you take me to see you?\" He grimaces. \"I'm not actually working in the movies anymore, Alexandria.\" Her eyes widen. \"You lost your job, Roy?\" \"I didn't lose it. I quit it. Before I lost it.\" \"If you don't have your job anymore, you lost it.\" \"I'm getting too old,\" he defends himself. \"I can't do it anymore. The business has broken younger men than me. I've been lucky too many times, and I don't want to die for some stupid picture.\" She's not really listening. \"You're always falling, and you never land.\" He puts his hands over his face, feels the prickle of the short hairs on his chin. \"That's me.\" \"What are you going to do now? If you're not falling anymore. And you can walk.\" \"Don't know. Clean hotel rooms maybe.\" This reminds her of her duties, and she stands up decisively. \"Help me make the bed. It will be good practice.\" He joins her, the bed already stripped, and they shake the fresh linens out and tug them around into shape, pat them down and smooth them. His skin is paler than hers. He faces her over the bed and goes very still as he watches her concentrate on her job, what she does and what she's paid for, watches the young girl he knew warring for the right to get older, to grow up, to move on. He wants very much to say, \"Take me with you.\" But he's afraid that will be her cue to leave, so he says nothing, keeps a look of placid contentment on his face. Together they smooth the coverlet, and she tucks it in, makes crisp neat corners like hospital beds. She looks at him for a moment, then lies down and holds still. \"Is this what you felt like?\" she whispers. It can't be anywhere near as bad but she doesn't need to know that so he says, \"Yes.\" He leans his weight on the bed, knees first, allows a crooked smile. \"Tell me a story.\" She closes her eyes as she grins. \"Once upon a time, the end. I'm no good at stories. You tell me one.\" \"Okay.\" He breathes in deep and it comes out a sigh. \"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess, and she— had to clean motel rooms.\" Alexandria grins and giggles again, bats her eyelashes at him till he laughs as well. He subsides down onto the bed next to her, lying on his side so he can watch her. \"And one day she went to clean the room of a former bandit, an ex-bandit, who'd stolen a whole bunch of jewels before he retired and hidden them in the motel room. She found them under the bed, and the first thing she thought was that she had to return them to their owners. But then the ex-bandit, the retired bandit, came back in the room. Why do that? he said. They're already gone. They've already been lost, the people will get over it. And little by little he convinced her—\" \"To keep the jewels?\" He watched her for long enough that he nearly forgot to answer; she had to nudge him. \"Yeah,\" he said softly. \"To keep the jewels.\" \"So she stole.\" \"No. He stole.\" \"But she was happy about it.\" \"She was very happy. They lived happily ever after with those jewels. Whenever it got dark, the moonlight would glint off them and so they always had enough light to see each other. And as long as they could see each other, they were happy.\" She thinks this over, and then smiles and nods. \"That's okay.\" \"Well, thank you very much, Miss Alexandria.\" She starts, abruptly, and sits up. \"I forgot.\" \"Forgot, forgot what?\" \"If I'm late, Tony gets angry. I need to finish, and go home.\" She's standing up, and he watches her, concerned, taken aback. \"Who's Tony?\" \"Husband,\" she says shortly. It sucks the breath from him and he has to stare at her, try to take her in in yet another light. She's gone from child to woman to matron in the space of a few minutes, and like a father he wishes she had stayed at the first, before her evolutions. But he can't bring himself to regret her standing before him, now, like this. So he stands up, too, to say goodbye properly. \"You can come back, if you want,\" he says. \"I mean, not just to clean the room. As my friend.\" \"You'll be here?\" she questions. It's a valid point: where, exactly, will he be? The job is over, he's chosen his defeat. But she's opened the door, and walked in, and he thinks she's also ensured his victory, even at this late date. Certainly right now he feels that he can do anything, even though in reality he's capable of next to nothing. \"Knock first,\" is what he says, the vivid memory in his mind of being woken up, from nightly sleep or from catnapping during the day, by a girl in a cast bouncing on his stomach. It no longer applies, but he likes the thought, and grins to himself. She's going to leave; the door is open. She smiles up at him, so familiar yet gone so long it makes his heart ache. \"I'd kiss you,\" she says, her fingers finding his mouth, stroking a little, \"except—\" They slide down, little fingers, little hand, tug lightly on his week-old beard. \"Scratchy.\" \"Right.\" He closes his eyes and in the silence she guides him down till she can reach, kisses him high up on the forehead, her mouth in his hair. It sparks a memory in him and he makes careful allusion to a long-ago day which she has tried to forget and he can't go one hour without remembering. \"Remember when I fell asleep,\" he says, \"and you tried to wake me up. I was drowning in it but I still felt. It was while you were my daughter and your hat covered your eyes. Remember?\" She doesn't like lying. She regards him solemnly. \"No,\" she says. \"That's okay,\" he tells her. \"Goodbye, Roy,\" she says. Roy can do this. Now. He regards his haggard sleep-fuzzed face in the mirror under the flickering dim light of the communal bathroom. He hasn't locked the door and anyone could walk in at any time. He raises the blade, the straight razor, the cutting edge, the only sharp thing in a world of soft, blurred edges. He thinks of a pirate, living and dying by the sword. He sighs. With careful strokes he shaves the beard from his face, emerges once more as a man he thinks he knows pretty well by now, but isn't positive. At this late date, though, how much more could there possibly be to learn? He shaves the path her lips once took, to wake him from the deepest sleep he's ever known. She failed that time, but won in the end. So when she returns, he'll be her bandit once more, her storyteller, and her story. So when she comes back, she'll remember. ","Summary":" He chooses his defeats, she makes his victories. Thirteen years later, the stories have changed. Wi"},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"Orange","Author":"Glorious Clio","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/8589652","Passage":"[Chapter 1] He thinks of her sometimes. The girl who saved his life. Who demanded that he save himself. He thought she was being selfish, but it was he who was the selfish one. Alexandria the Great. He doesn't know her last name. Never did. But her first name means leader of men; he thinks it is fitting. Roy is simply another word for Red. Red Walker. Anyway. He still knows every treasure in her box, he knew her house was burned, her horse stolen, her father killed, by angry people. He knew that she picked oranges with her mother and sister and her friend from India. Roy loves oranges now. He never had an opinion of them before, but now he craves them constantly, as powerfully as he used to crave M-O-R-P-H-I-N-3. He does not devour the fruit; instead he rolls them in their bowl, tosses them in the air a few times (as if throwing them at God instead of The Priest, but like her, without any real malice) before carefully peeling them and eating them section by tiny section. He observes their color and the dimples over the peel and the smell of sunshine... He only eats California oranges, and he wonders if hers was the dimpled hand to pick it. He wonders if she still has any of her milk teeth, or if they all have fallen out, to be replaced by her strength. Her courage. Her tenacity. He wonders if she'll have a gap in her teeth like her father. He is pondering the state of her dentistry when a young woman stumbles against him, spilling her drink on the only suit he has. He catches her out of habit; he's used to catching people when they fall now, like Alexandria did for him. He is pulled back to the present. This young starlet, however (he can tell she's a starlet - her brows are soaped and perfect, her hair is bright yellow, and she's wearing heavy make-up and a short dress), giggles at the drink she spilled and trips away on her high heels. No doubt in search of another cocktail. She glances back, though. As if to say \"come hither,\" her red lips pouting. But like the Indian in his story, he can barely stand to look at her. She is much too bright - it blinds him. He has no idea what color her eyes are, and he does not care to find out her favorite food. Her favorite book. It's probably some trash by Fitzgerald, he rationalizes. The starlet climbs on top of the grand piano and does the Charleston, her heels slicing painfully into the wood. Just another wild Hollywood party. He's had enough. Roy Walker leaves the party behind, the women trying to reform him (back to alcohol and drugs and things that make everyone numb. Not since Alexandria has Roy had a drink. Prohibition no longer affects him). But he's not enslaved by that anymore. Alexandria has freed him, like Otta Benga had freed the slaves in the story. He jumps into his auto. His mind is curiously blank as he drives back to his house. It's a small place in a family neighborhood, never to be the site of a huge bash. He was lucky to pay it off before the market crash. Roy is still working, but he worries sometimes about Alexandria and the overrun fruit picking industry. Then he remembers her teeth. As he enters, he drops his keys in the dish by the door and follows a well beaten path to his office. Only here does he relax. He sinks gratefully into a soft leather chair. There is a table in front of him, covered in papers and many pots of colorful ink. His dog, Jack Russell, curls up on his feet. Roy can feel the heat of him sinking into his toes. It's delicious. He begins to write. Very slowly, in different colors. It's quieter this way. He doesn't have to learn to type. And to go this slowly allows him to smooth out the rough edges, and the little girl in his head to interrupt him, make suggestions. To ask why? The words come like a steady stream tonight, a rainbow of color. It's always this way, when Alexandria pops into his mind. She's a tiny, toothless muse. And he writes the story that he began, that she manipulated into something of her own, despite his best intentions. Or his worst ones. After a while, his eyes start to burn; he rubs his brow. Everything is blurry, so Roy takes a break. He stands and feels the vertebra pop in his back. Rolling his shoulders, he wanders into the kitchen towards the acid green bowl that holds the pile of California oranges. He settles at the table and begins carefully peeling one, giving a small section to Jack Russell at his feet. He should get some sleep, he knows. Tomorrow (or, later today) he'll be receiving a new script, and he will have to begin choreographing the stunts. That's what he does now. He went from stunt man to paraplegic to stunt man again, and now years later, he was choreographing dangers for others to undertake. He wonders if he will be planning any explosions, like Luigi in the story. It worries him, a little. Before, in the flickers, you could see his face sometimes. And he hoped Alexandria would be watching when that happened. That she would see him, living. (She did not want him to die. He does not want to disappoint her. He never crosses his fingers anymore, not even for luck. He promised.) But lately, he has been behind the camera. He wonders if she looks for him. A lot has changed in tinsel town since he recovered the use of his legs. Most recently, they have learned to talk. Because of this, many silent film stars, including Her, had been let go. No one wanted to hear their voices. Roy no longer had to avoid Her on sets or at parties. Who knew where She was now. And now, he is writing. He is taking the Bandit and putting him down on paper, as best as he can remember through that haze of depression, morphine, and alcohol. Going slowly, with the colored ink, helps. When he gets stuck, he pulls out the picture that she drew for him, of him, of the smiling Red Bandit and the girl who loved him. Whom he realizes was not Nurse Evelyn, but rather, the artist herself. She can pull the story out of him, even now, from far away. It has structure and purpose, a better purpose than tricking her into finding pills. He knows, however, that this story would be better in her vivid, beautiful imagination. The moving pictures are still black and white. He wants to create this story in the lushness of color. What he really wants to do was track her down in her orange groves and create a magical world for her. He wants to somehow help her. A strange Miss Havisham for a strange little Pip. Although he feels sure her mother would never allow it, not after she fell. Again. Alexandria's fame had been his infamy, and the doctor had to report to her mother how she had gotten hurt when she was on the mend. So he has this story, their bandit lifestyle, to keep her nearby. The picture that she drew him. A bowl full of oranges. Alexandria has his face in the flickering black and white, and hopefully, someday, a bright and colorful moving picture to see and recognize and lose herself in, the way he once found himself in the same story. He pulls himself up again, up the stairs to the washroom. Mindlessly he cleans his teeth before inspecting his face in the mirror. There are wrinkles around his eyes, around his mouth. It's strange how his face has changed over the last decade or so. He feels a bit like the mystic; his body is a map. The scars on his back from the surgeries, freckles that his mother told him were angel kisses, and the wrinkles that were starting to show. They tell a story, tell him where he's been, how far he's come. Roy flips off the light and crawls into his bed. It takes awhile to fall asleep. It always does. It's hard to turn off his brain. His mind skitters like a Faulkner novel over the three morphine pills that Alexandra once gave him, which in his depressed eyes constituted a nap. He thinks how three is a powerful number in faerie tales. He has collected so many stories over the years. The library downstairs is full of them. Their bright bindings shine like jewels. Some of them aren't even in English, but the illustrations, though black and white, hold him captive. His favorites are the books of the Hindu legends, so different from the Greek or the Norse myths, even as he finds common threads that bind them together. But their names hold magic, even as he trips over them. Never would he have thought it possible to stumble over vowels. But it makes him feel like Darwin, to carefully turn over the leaves in books and catalog the characters and the plots. Hanuman makes him smile the most. Alexandria loved the monkey in their story, and he had maliciously killed Wallace first. Looking back, Roy could not understand how he could have been so cruel to that girl. The only thing he could think was that he had been enslaved by his depression, by the morphine addiction, by, by, by... He could make those excuses, and he does. But it is not enough anymore. Which is why he took pen to paper. Close your eyes - what do you see? Nothing. Rub them. Do you see the stars? Yes . He opens his eyes again, unsure if he has slept or not. Outside the window, the sky begins to turn from black to blue to purple to pink to orange. No moving picture could be so vivid. ","Summary":" He thinks of her sometimes. The girl who saved his life.

Not sure how good is going to be, Im not even sure if Ill continue after this chapter, depends on what people thing. I just wanted to get back into writing again and this flowed nicely….I think… Ok, so review please and let me know if you think I should continue. Also just a quick note, because they never mention her age in the film in my head Alexandria was 8 and Roy was 19. My story takes place 13 years later so Alexandria is 21 and Roy is 32. The Epic, by Roy Burk Dedicated to my dearest friend Alexandria; Alexandria The Great. She read the words and smiled. She never knew his last name, although she probably would have forgotten it by now if she had, and yet she knew it was him. She flicks through the first few pages of the book and wonders if it is the same story he told her all those years ago; would he have remembered all the details that she had loved so much? Alexandria stops, her focus landing on one page, the memory of the conversation coming back to her in an instant. \" Why does the old man keep his teeth in a glass at night?\" She had asked, whispered more like, because she didn't want the old man to hear her. She was a little frightened of him, and it was all because of those teeth. \" Its where he keeps his strength, his spirit.\" Roy answered, like it was the simplest thing in the world. \"Spirit is in those teeth.\" She laughed then, unsure of what he was saying exactly. Our spirit is in our teeth? \"Oh, you're missing a little strength, right at the front of your mouth.\" She remembers and smiles, remembering the conversations that they had together. He was hard to understand sometimes, but now she knows it was just because she didn't understand a lot of English at the time. She wonders if she would be able to understand him better now, so many years later, now that her English has improved. Of course she still has her accent, and she hopes that she will never lose it; it is a part of her, she wouldn't be Alexandria without it. She also thinks about how much he might have changed. Is he still unable to walk? Does he still need help sleeping? Closing the book, she takes a look at the time. Nearly 6 o'clock, it would be closing time soon, and then she would be going for a meal with her sister. She hadn't seen her in a while, as Evelyn still worked at the groves with their mother. Alexandria had told her many times in the last few years that she could live with her in the city and she could work at the café with her. Anything to get her out of the groves, she didn't want her to waste her whole life there when there was so much else to see. But Evelyn would always say she liked it there, that she was happy picking oranges. She didn't know that Alexandria noticed her smile fading whenever they spoke about it, so they didn't speak about it often. Instead they spent what little time they had together each month, when Evelyn finally had her days off, to go to dinner, or to walk in the park talking about their mother, or to go see pictures. Alexandria always hoped to see Roy, and thought she saw him a few times, but she was never quite sure. Evelyn didn't really like pictures. Today they had planned to go for dinner, and Evelyn had told Alexandria that she had something to show her, something important. She seemed excited, and it made Alexandria wonder what she could possibly have to show her that would bring out this side of her; Evelyn never got excited over anything really. As the clock struck 6 Alexandria smiled at the few remaining customers as they left, knowing that she would see most of them here again tomorrow. It was always the same people, with very few exceptions, that came for the same things every day. Some people would think it a monotonous thing to do, serving the same things to the same people every day, but it worked her for. She enjoyed being able to get to know her customers so well, having never really spoken to anyone other than the rest of the grove workers; before she left, she had never even been to the city - apart from her stay in the hospital when she was 6 - but she didn't really count that as being in the city as she didn't see anything other than the hospital. Still, she remembers the time she spent there with fondness, wondering how her life may have been different if she hadn't fallen while picking oranges in the grove. How she would have been different if she hadn't met Roy. Alexandria' POV. \"Lexie.\" Evelyn's voice wakes me from my reverie. \"Are you dreaming again?\" \"I was thinking about stuff.\" \"Stuff.\" She mutters under her breath. I hate it when she does that. \"Okay, well if you're finished thinking about…\" She looks at me with a smirk on her face as I place Roy's book in my bag. \"Stuff, can we go now?\" \"Yes, let's go.\" We head to our favourite restaurant Umberto's, and we get there just in time to get the last table, which is great because Evelyn hates waiting for anything. Evelyn, being subtle as always, gets straight in with the questions of the day. \"So, when did you get the book?\" \"Joan gave it to me.\" Joan was a waitress at work, and one of my best friends. Ive known her since I moved to the city when I was 16, and we had been living together for 2 years now. She's like a sister to me, and I care about her almost as much as Evelyn. \"She was reading a bit out to me and we both said that it sounded like me, so I read some more.\" I smiled, thinking about some of the stupid things I had said as a child that I only vaguely remember, and yet he seemed to remember it as clear as if it was yesterday. \"And look.\" I took out the book and showed her the dedication page. Evelyn didn't look as happy as I did when I saw it. \"Lex, this might not be you. You don't even know if it's him\" \"I know. It can't be anyone else; no one else heard the story.\" She was still looking at me like I was crazy, and I was already sick of it. \"Look, you don't have to believe it, you don't even have to read it. But don't knock down my beliefs.\" I pushed the book back into my bag and pulled out my purse, throwing a few notes down onto the table. \"Im not hungry, but you have a nice dinner.\" I left before she had a chance to answer. When I got outside, it had started to rain. Great ending to the day really. I was searching for my umbrella in my bag, wishing I had brought my coat today when I walked straight into someone. My bag went flying across the pavement, its contents spilling out as I looked up to apologise… …but the words died in my throat as I look up into a pair of brown eyes I remember so well. \"Alexandria?\" Well, what do you think?

Disclaimer: I do not own the piece of art that is The Fall, nor the insanly hot Bandit *cries* You sigh. You want to get out of here. Away from your desk. Away from work. Yes, your colleagues are fun to work with and you've finally found the perfect job. But it's not enough. You feel empty. You broke up with your last almost-boyfriend 3 years ago and you haven't dated anyone since. You just can't find the right one, your knight in shining armor, or whatever they like to call him. You've stopped looking for love anyway. You have your work - busy work. Yet, coming home to an empty house is far from pleasant. Sometimes, you think the silence and loneliness will be the end of you. You stare at your computer screen, lost in thought, when the sound of nearing high heels brings you back on earth. Clarice, one of your fellow colleagues, smiles at you and sits on the side of your desk. \"Hey sweets! The girls are going out tonight and I was wondering if you'd like to join us? There's a club not far from here and I've heard the boys there are insanely hot.\" she smiles. \"I-I don't know, Clarice. I still have a lot of work to do. This article needs to be finished bef-\" She cuts you off \"I won't take no for an answer! Come on, it'll be fun. We'll just grab a drink and maybe... you'll grab more than that!\" she winks at you. Fun. You need a bit of that, indeed. Besides, if you refuse you'll be welcomed back home by your friends silence and loneliness anyway. \"What time?\" you grin. \"Ah, that's my girl! I'll pick you up at 9.\" XXXXX \"I don't know what to wear.\" you mutter to yourself. You aren't really the dress-type, so your choices are narrowed down to two plain dresses, not fit for fancy night outs. Gods, how you love your skinny jeans and sneakers, but they're not appropriate for tonight. You almost consider to call Clarice and tell her you're not feeling well when you suddenly feel a presence, as if someone's watching you. You quickly turn around and scan the room, but see no one. \"I must be going mad.\" you sigh and rub your forehead. You turn your attention back to your closet and spot a red dress, hanging in the corner, slightly hidden behind some jackets. You take the dress and smile, confused \"I don't remember buying this one, but it'll do.\" An hour later, you're ready. Red dress, black high heels, a bit of make-up and your curly hair neatly in a bun. The doorbell rings and you open to find a grinning, but as always gorgeous looking Clarice. She gasps \"My god, darling! You look stunning! I've never seen that dress before! Where did you get it? No no, wait. How come I have never seen you in it before?\" \"I,well, uhm...\" \"Doesn't matter. Come on!\" she grabs your hand and practically yanks you away. You quickly grab your purse and close the front door. Once in the car, you feel that presence again. You scan the bushes on your front yard, yet no one is to be seen or heard except for Clarice. An odd feeling washes over you. Not a scary feeling, but one of... excitement. You quickly shake off the thought as Clarice starts the car and drives off. At the club, you can't deny you're having a great time. You're sitting at the bar with your friends, all thoughts of boredom, the perfect knight and all that crap forgotten as you laugh and chat with them. You're about to drink up your 3rd cocktail of the evening, when Clarice pokes you. \"Seen any interesting guys yet, sweets? Because I have. Damn, I've just made a whole list in my head!\" she almost shouts, trying to get above the loud music. You don't have time to answer as she points at a certain bloke, standing at one of the tables on the other side of the dance floor. You look up and raise an eyebrow \"Nah, good looking, but not my type. Come on, Clarice, you know very well what kind of g...\" you trail off as you notice the guy sitting in one of the lounge beanbags, not far behind the bloke Clarice just pointed out. He's sitting all alone, with no drink or anything... and he's looking directly at you. You meet his eyes and it's as if time freezes in that moment. You can't but stare back, trying to make out his features. It's impossible because he's sitting mostly in the dark. The only things you can make out are his head and shoulders. He's wearing a hat and... wait, is he wearing a mask? \"Uhm, hellooooo there?\" You quickly turn your head and meet Clarice's amused face \"You okay, sweets? I thought I had lost you for a moment there! Something wrong?\" \"I-I was just, well...\" you look back at the lounge beanbags and notice he's gone. You shake your head. Too much alcohol, simple as that. \"Well?\" You let out an amused sigh \"No, no, I'm fine. How about we hit the dance floor, huh?\" You, Clarice and a few of your other colleagues make your way to the dance floor. You give the dancing crowd a quick scan, looking for the mysterious guy, but nothing. You laugh at your silliness and let yourself get carried away by the music. After a few songs, the lights dim and the dance floor becomes darker, making it harder to see the surroundings. You smile and let yourself completely go as the music becomes more intense. Suddenly, you feel gloved hands caressing your waist from behind you. You gasp and spin around, but no one's there. You look back at Clarice who's almost dancing like a maniac. Yep, she surely didn't notice anything. You sigh and rub your forehead. \"The alcohol must be taking its toll.\" you mutter to yourself. Just as you're about to leave the dance floor, you notice the guy again, standing at the bar and looking at you. You still can't see him clearly as your view is mostly blocked by dancing people. You hurry to the bar, pushing people aside and trying to keep your eyes locked on him. You almost reach the bar when the flickering spotlights turn on, making the surroundings even more blurry. The dancing crowd becomes wild and you lose sight of him. As you free yourself from the crowd, you let out an annoyed groan. He's gone... again. Is it really the alcohol or some guy who's really bored and enjoys messing around with your head? As you consider the second option, that odd feeling washes over you again. This strange excitement and dizziness. You order a glass of water as you sit down on a stool. You notice Clarice emerging from the crowd. \"Sweets, you okay? I didn't notice you had left! \" You groan \"Yeah, just a headache, too much alcohol. It's already late. Wo-would you mind if I went home?\" Clarice smiles \"Good I'm the non-alcoholic here! If you give me a mo. We were just about to grab our last drink and then I'll drop you off, okay?\" You nod \"Okay.\" XXXXX You let yourself fall onto your bed with a loud 'poof'. You are completely exhausted and almost consider sleeping like this, but you're in desperate need of a shower. You try to hoist yourself up, groaning in the process, and saunter towards the bathroom. You get rid of your make-up and reach for the zipper of your dress, but stop. You furrow your brow and notice the feeling of someone staring at you is gone, as if the person has left. You let out a relieved sigh, drop your dress on the bathroom tiles and step into the shower. You instantly relax as the hot water touches your skin, soothing your tense muscles. You try your hardest not to, but your mind wanders off to that mysterious guy. The way he looked at you, nearly spied on you, was so intense. He looked interested, fascinated even. Most people would freak out with someone staring at them like that, surely when that person tends to disappear and reappear, but not this time, not with you. His eyes carried something secure, in a non-stalkerish way. Who was he? You splash water in your face and laugh \"Gods, am I that desperate?\" After your shower, you put on your night shirt and cuddle up in bed, really trying hard to get the guy out of your head as you drift off. You're sleeping soundly when suddenly a voice, a faint whisper, wakes you up. You sit up, or rather shoot up, and feel that presence again... this time in your room. You listen, yet no sound can be heard except for you swallowing hard. You realize you're not alone. \"Wh-who is there?!\" you say, trying not to sound scared. You hear the tapping of boots on your parquet floor, coming from the right corner of your room. Your eyes are adjusting to the darkness as you try to focus. \"Who is there?\" you ask again, this time more confident \"I warn you, I'm armed!\" you grab the book on your nightstand. Suddenly the lights switch on and you let out a surprised yelp. There, standing right at the end of your bed, is the mysterious guy... the guy from the club. Only this time, you can clearly see him. \"So am I.\" he grins and points at his gun pouch around his waist which carries 2 guns. Apart from his black hat and red rectangular-shaped mask, he is wearing a black, sleeveless jacket, revealing his strong and muscled arms. Yellow buttons cover almost the complete front of the jacket, keeping it closed, yet revealing a part of his chest. You notice his brown gloves, fringes hanging from the sides - the same gloves that caressed your waist while you were dancing. His trousers are covered by a long, leather skirt, only revealing the tip of his black boots. You sit there, frozen, his gaze pinning you down. You're not sure if to panic and scream or run away. The only thing you can do right now is stare, yet afraid to look directly at him. He notices the panic in your eyes and nods his head \"Fear me not, my sleeping beauty. I mean you no harm.\" That voice. His voice sounds like velvet, no, even better, liquid gold engulfing your entire body, seeping through your veins and taking over your soul. Your eyes lock with his. You gasp as you see fire in them, a burning desire. That overwhelming feeling of washes over you again, this time stronger, more intense, like a wave hitting you... a wave of arousement. You start to feel hot. You push the blankets off your body, your every movement followed by his gaze. \"It was you, all that time, wasn't it? Not only in the club, but in my house too.\" your voice sounds firm. Finally. He flashes you a cheeky smile \"Yes. I was and am always there, watching you from afar. And my, you looked absolutely ravishing in that red dress. But I can no longer bare it.\" \"What do you want?\" you're surprised when your question sounds almost like a challenge, tempting him. \"I am the Red Bandit.\" he says and takes off his mask. As his eyes bore into you, you feel the heat between your legs. He undoes his belt, throws his hat and mask on the floor and crawls onto your bed, like a predator approaching his prey. You automatically lay back when he towers over you, fully surrendering yourself. One of his gloved hands sneaks underneath your night shirt, his leather touch setting your skin on fire. He caresses your belly ever so lightly and climbs higher, but retreats. You let out a frustrated moan, admitting to yourself you want more. He grins in approval and pulls off his gloves with his teeth. Now both of his hands are underneath your shirt, stroking your entire torso as he leans closer. You can feel his hot breath against your neck, your senses going on overdrive. His nose touches your ear. \"I am here to claim what's mine.\" he whispers and with that, he claims your lips. XXXXX Your alarm clock goes off. You rub your forehead and groan, not wanting to get up. Suddenly you remember last night and your eyes flash open - you scan your room. No bandit, no mask. Nothing. Not even the feeling of being watched. You turn off your alarm and get up \"Okay that's it. No more than 3 glasses of alcohol!\" you mutter. With some tea and a quick shower you're ready and leave for work. You had hoped you would get some rest at work, but your mind keeps wandering off to last night, making it very hard to concentrate on your article. You burrow your head in your hands when the phone on your desk rings. Your boss needs you for a moment, something about the article. You grab the papers of your first version and head towards his office. You knock on his door and enter. First thing you notice is a guy sitting in one of the chairs, his back to you. He didn't hear you enter as he is busy browsing through some papers. \"Ah, there you are. I know the project you're working on is hard and the deadline close, so I employed Mr. Walker here to help you out. He is familiar with the project so you two can start right away. Make me proud.\" your boss smiles and nods at the new employee. Upon hearing his name, he rises from his seat and turns. \"Hi,\" he says as he shakes your hand \"my name's Roy. Roy Walker.\" You gasp and drop your papers. Author's Note: The end? Ehehe! If my fic gets some positive reviews, I might consider turning it into a multi-chapter fic with Roy/Bandit/OC.

Roy/Alexandria if you squint, but otherwise, just friendship. Hope you enjoy. :) Fifteen years after the story about five bandits, Alexandria falls again. She's not a child anymore, so they put her in what used to be Roy's wing, in his actual bed. It's comforting in a weird way but it also makes her miss him more. He was certain she would get over their friendship, but she never did. She missed him and worried about him, and it did not lessen with time; when she was a child it was easier to believe that he got better and went back to shooting movies. Lately, she wonders if he's even still alive, or did he give up when she went away. Laying in bed late at night, her leg itching under the cast, she vows to look him up as soon as they release her from the hospital. She prays it won't be too late. It takes longer to recover this time, and it's already fall when she goes into the studio where Roy used to work. Nobody knows what's she talking about and it's not because of her still accented English; Roy never came back to work. It can only mean that he never recovered, and Alexandria feels lightheaded, as if she just stood on her tiptoes, reached for an orange and came back down empty handed. After the studio, she goes back to the hospital, charms the guy running the archives and spends the entire afternoon going through dusty stacks of papers. She finds Walt's file, puts it away without reading anything in it, then there's her own and finally, there's Roy's. It's thick and she holds it in her hands for a moment, closing her eyes and trying to remember him, but details elude her; she sees only a vague form of the Black Bandit, but that's okay too. Hesitating for just another moment, she takes a deep breath and opens it. There's so many medical terms in it she doesn't understand, but she knows what depression means, knows what suicidal tendencies are, and it's like she's back in bed and he's looking at her with tears in his eyes, telling her that he's got nothing left to live for. Telling her he's half a man. She reads on through a description of a surgery, then another and another and she can see it's hopeless; the doctors just couldn't fix him. The file ends with a release letter, nearly a year after she was already gone. It says that he left the hospital against doctor's advice. There are 36 Roy Walkers in the Los Angeles directory. Alexandria wonders briefly if this is madness, if she should go back to the plantation, but there's nothing left for her there. Her mother is dead, and she fears it would happen to her too if she stayed; she doesn't want to fall again. She needs to find Roy, and she needs to find him now, right this second. Two weeks later she's broke and she has to move out of the motel room she'd been sleeping in. There are 10 Roy Walkers left on her list, and she can only go by three of them before she gives up and goes back to her life, if you could call picking oranges day in and day out a life. She stares at the list of names, praying silently for some kind of sign, something that would point her in the right direction. The first place she stops by has a ramp going parallel with the stairs leading into the building and Alexandria feels a surge of wild hope that can't be quieted, and takes the stairs two at a time, breathless with anticipation. Every nerve in her body tells her that this is it; this is where he is, this is where she finally finds him. She stops in front of a door with brass number 4 on it and sets her suitcase down next to her feet. Her hand is trembling when she rings the bell, but there's a smile a mile wide stretching her lips and she has to focus to stop herself from bouncing up and down. She needs to remind herself that she's not five anymore, that Roy may not be what she remembers, what she expects. She may not be what he expects. Her greatest fear is that he won't want to talk to her at all. When the door finally swings open, she stands there frozen, looking down at her Black Bandit, the same and not the same, so subtly different that for a moment she thinks all this a dream. There are new lines on his face, no sign of a smile either, only a question in his stormy eyes when he looks up at her. She breathes his name and starts babbling, uncertain how to explain herself. It takes just a little while for him to realize who she is, a smile tugging at his lips slowly, his eyes lighting up as he says: „Alexandria the Great\", softly, with gentle teasing that brings her to tears. She's happy, so very happy, but she can't stop herself from crying, and he makes it all worse when he pulls her down in his lap and holds her like a child she's not. „How did you find me?\", he asks, his voice strained, and she pulls away to check if he's crying too. „It took a lot of time and awkward exchanges with Roy Walkers that were not you\", she tells him, wiping his tears with her fingers before she puts her arms around him and rests her chin against his shoulder. His hands fist in the material of her shirt and she thinks her heart may beat out of her chest, the way it's racing. „You didn't forget me\", Roy says, and she relaxes against him, realizing it was meant to be. She wouldn't have found him otherwise. He looks at her from across the coffee table, smiling like she never seen him smile before. She realizes that he's at peace with himself now, and knows in her heart that she was the one who saved him, pulled him from the edge. „So what were you up to all this time,\" he asks her in that low voice, more familiar to her than the voice of her own father. „Picking oranges\", she answers, unable to stop grinning. „And what brings you here?\" „I fell,\" she says, and then she's not grinning anymore. It feels like they already had this exact conversation, even though she knows they didn't, not like this. „And you thought of me.\" „I always think of you\", she says softly, and they're silent for a while, before he finally says: „Me too.\" „And what do you do? My mother told me you were shooting movies again, and I made myself believe her. I watched so many, and after a while, I would see you in each and every one of them.\" „Well, turns out I couldn't do that, so I started writing stories. Something you made me realize I was good at.\" She leans forward in her seat and asks: „What kind of stories?\" „Children's books. Fairy-tales. You know.\" „Did they get published?\" „Of course\", he says with a grin, and she loves this new version of him even more than the old one. „And our story?\" She asks hesitantly, and he shakes his head. „That one, I keep to myself.\" He looks at the wall behind her and when she turns around, she sees her drawing framed in the center. She looks back at him and gives him the full extent of her gap-toothed smile. They don't discuss her future plans, or even what's gonna happen tomorrow; Roy just puts her suitcase on the bed in a spare bedroom and that's that. It's not like she's got anywhere else to go. It's not like there's anywhere in the world she'd rather be. „Roy?\", she whispers in the doorway to his room, trembling in her white nightgown, shifting from feet to feet uncertainly. „Yeah?\", he whispers back, and she doesn't let herself hesitate at all; she pads across the room and snuggles under the covers before he even knows what hit him. „You can't sleep either?\" she asks him, laying on her side, facing him in the dark like no time has passed at all. „I'm not used to this much excitement\", he says, his voice reverberating through her like a lost dream. She closes her eyes and imagines his smirk, the way his eyes sparkle when he smiles. „Tell me our story\", she demands, shifting closer to him, and he puts his arm around her like she's still that girl with twin braids, like they're still in his hospital bed with a sheet separating them from the rest of the world. „Okay. Close your eyes\", he instructs, and she smiles in the dark, looking up at the starry sky above the Butterfly reef. „Can you see the stars?\" „Yes\", she says, reaching for his hand in the dark, their fingers entwining as the Indian with a bandaged thigh comes out of the water with some bad news. When she was a little girl, she once told Roy that she never wanted to get better, because she wanted to stay with him. It took her fifteen years, but she found her way back to him, and this time, she wasn't going anywhere. Never again. Review?

The sun brightening as it made it's way toward the horizon to bid farewell to the world. Only to make it's return in the early morning. The sound of men shouting to each other didn't startle the young woman as she stood on her step stool, her delicate hand reaching above her head to an orange before she yanked it free from the stemming branch. Her gray eyes scanned the fruit for imperfections before she smiled at it. Every day was like this. She'd go into the groves, pick until she couldn't anymore, before returning to the house to feed the houseful that she now cared for. Ever since her mother passed, Little Alexandria had taken it upon herself to care for her sister and the workers that helped her with the groves each day. Today however, she kept losing herself in her own imagination. Much like she used to as a child. Over the years, that side of her seemed to disappear, giving way to maturity and responsibility. But all day, Alexandria had been pulled from her own thoughts numerous times, sometimes violently from her younger sister, Lita. The brunette looked off from the orange, in the direction of the setting sun as it brightly shone one last time. The rays enveloped her in warmth as she envisioned a dark shadowed figure walking toward her. His coat tails swaying from side to side as he walked, a revolver holstered at his hip, and the brim of his hat extended over the sides of his face. In that moment, Alexandria's breath caught in her throat as she turned her body toward the figure as he continued toward her. Roy? She stepped free from her step stool, her long hair swaying in the gentle, warm breeze as the figure came closer and closer until finally stopping in front of her. As if the sun rays knew of their effect on the figure, they seemed to dial down a bit to reveal the figure before her. The red mask that covered his face, the same black costume, even the brass buttons were the same, just as she had thought as a little girl. She giggled a bit to herself as she reached up toward his face, her slender fingers gripping onto the edge of his mask. She gasped gently as she felt his hand grasp at her wrist firmly, almost to halt her from revealing himself. \"A man can't show what's in his heart if he hides his face.\" Alexandria whispered softly to him, this causing his hand to slide down her forearm slowly. She watched his hand for a moment before she continued, pulling the mask free from his face slowly. The strings holding it to his head fell freely and she stared up into a face she missed. One she'd recognize anywhere she was. A breathless gasp leaving her lips as she stared up into his staring green eyes. \"Roy.\" She said passionately as her fingers curled around the mask in her hand, his hand moving from her arm to the side of her face. She felt his touch as she closed her deep gray eyes, her hand reaching up to touch his wrist this time. Their bodies mingled close together as his head dipped down toward hers. Her breathing labored in anticipation as his lips drew closer to hers. A moment she had relished in her mind as she grew up. Her first crush, her first love. She leaned her face up to his, her lips almost touching his in return. Then, the sun returned again, bathing them in intense light and shrouding them both in darkness, preventing her from being sure if a kiss had transpired. The sensation of an orange connecting with the back of her head, signaled to Alexandria that she had once again, been daydreaming. She cried out a bit, mostly in shock as she turned her body to look at Lita's with a disgruntled expression on her face. \"Ow! Lita what—\" \"Stop dawdling. We have to finish before nightfall.\" The young girl said, rather harshly before she moved off from her older sister in a huff. Alexandria sighed, her eyes moving back to the orange that was still held within the palm of her hand. After a moment, she placed the orange into her basket and stepped free from the stool. She lifted it into her arms and made the trek to the next set of trees she had left in order to finish her set. It was true, they needed all they could get at this point. Without anymore distractions, she finished her work for the day and made her way back to the house. Back where there was more work to be done. Work that only she could do. Sometimes she wished things weren't the way they were. But the entire country was in turmoil. Why would she be given any special treatment?

His strong hand grasped the railing and his heart thudded against his chest. Year after year he came to this very spot. As long as he lived he would never forget that night. It was a peak moment during his teen years when his sanity and his very life stood in the balance. It took the faith of his best friend and the kindness of a beautiful stranger to ease him away from the precipice. The man walked briskly a few paces beyond the stairwell and halted. He stared at the tracks and followed the bits of paper and debris blowing across the rails. A tiny rat scurried across to find sustenance. He stared at his watch. It was a little after ten-thirty pm. He dug his hands into his denim pockets and waited. Another man eventually trudged up the stairwell; he was winded, having somewhat ran the distance from his hotel. He peeked beyond the entrance and saw his best friend of thirty years pacing back and forth and hunching his shoulders up and down as he muttered to himself. No matter how big his friend got, the green jacket still fit him. He smiled and approached him. \"I made it, Linderman. Just like I said I would.\" \"I was wondering if you were gonna come…you know, I don't hold you to this anymore, Cliff. You look a little out of breath.\" Clifford came up behind him and patted his shoulder. \"I'm fine. Ricky, I told you I'd always be here if I'm available…and tonight I was, I made sure of it.\" Ricky smiled wryly. \"I know you're humoring me, but I appreciate it, man. I'm not gonna fault you for the years you were away at college, or the time you up and moved outta town for a while. I only come to this spot once a year and every time it feels exactly like that night.\" Clifford chuckled. \"Except you're not shoving me against a pole.\" He removed his jacket and placed it over his arm. The weather warmed up this time of year. \"Hey listen, Shelly said to come by the apartment. She made her roast beef special and has plenty left over.\" \"Nahh, it's late, Cliff. I don't wanna be a burden. Daniel's probably sleeping anyway and when us grown ups get together, we got big mouths.\" Clifford snorted. \"Since when are you a burden, man? You're family, Ricky. Haven't you learned that in the past twenty years since me and Shelly tied the knot? And Danny… Ha! That boy doesn't know what sleep is, when I left him he was playing video games. He keeps telling me to get a Wii fit . I told him I already have a Ballys gym membership, thank you.\" Ricky grinned. \"And you don't take advantage of it, you're still a string bean…an out of shape string bean!\" Clifford punched his shoulder and sulked. \"Hey, pal, we can't all be Hercules! Shelly loves me just the way I am.\" \"We all know that Shelly is Mrs. String bean. Ehh, maybe more like an asparagus.\" Ricky laughed. \"And you're still the Jolly green giant! You know I had to go there.\" \"Yep, I'll never forget the day Shelly made that comparison in front of the entire student body. So, now I gotta look over and protect my vegetables.\" Ricky clutched his chest. \"It hurts me so to hear you say such things...\" \"Oh please… nothing hurts…I mean...never mind.\" Clifford refrained from saying that nothing hurt Ricky. The one thing that hurt him was part of the reason they were at this back end station in the middle of the night. It was the anniversary of the night teen-age Ricky Linderman finally released his pent-up emotions and revealed the source of his depression, and, it was the night that Clifford Peache proved himself to be a solid and true friend. Clifford eyed Ricky with slight envy . Standing about 6'4, the man was a chiseled rock. Even at forty-six, Ricky barely aged a day, aside from his scraggly goatee and a few lines around the eyes and mouth. On this particular occasion, his handsome features encompassed the cherubic, yet stoic appearance he posessed at sixteen. \"So, how's my Erica? Need me to start busting any heads yet?\" Ricky joked. Clifford laughed. \"Not just yet, but I'll give you a holler when it's time. That girl knows how to defend herself.\" \"I know. I taught your kids well.\" Clifford's daughter recently turned sixteen and just started to discover the joys of the opposite sex. Ricky was considered like a loving and overprotective uncle to Clifford's children. \"When she was still little, she used to tell me she was gonna marry a man just like uncle Ricky. You remember?\" Clifford asked. \"Oh yeah, she warmed my heart. Then she would look up at me with those inherited baby blues and tell me that if she didn't find someone just like me , she'd marry me instead , even if I lost all my hair and got a big belly.\" Clifford couldn't resist teasing and ran his hand through his silvered mass of brown curls. \"Funny how she said you'd lose your hair rather than go gray!\" Ricky pulled his black baseball cap lower over his brow and wagged his finger at him. \"No comment! I'm not bald...yet! \" \"Not completely.\" Clifford snickered. \"You just make sure any guy that wants to date my Erica doesn't have all my baggage, okay? If he does, I wanna talk to him.\" \"Alright, Linderman, you got it. But really, besides the obvious, what baggage could you possibly have? You never got married, never had kids…you have a solid career... two careers.\" Ricky gazed up at the station lights. His smile faded. \"Believe me, what goes on in my head sometimes is more than enough for anyone.\" Clifford sighed and attempted to change the subject. \"So, what's the dirt at Lakeview High ? How are you handling those kids?\" Ricky shrugged humbly. \"The same way I always have, with love, and a helluva lot of patience. You'd be amazed at how much respect you'll get from the students if you don't patronize, and then you can help them channel any aggressive...\" Clifford held up his hands. \" Woah, okay. Now you're starting to sound like that therapist you're always yapping about. The one on the late night radio. What's her name? Dr. C?\" \"She's great, I've been listening to her for six years, but I never had the guts to call in.\" \"Do you even apply her advice?\" Ricky looked away sheepishly. \"Well…I try. I get real gung-ho about it, and even take notes for my students, but when it comes to me, I just uh …forget. I don't know why she's not more renowned.\" \"Maybe she wants to keep a low profile. Believe me, there are enough lunatics in Chicago to keep her busy for a lifetime.\" Ricky glared at him and Clifford shrank back. \"Umm ... present company excluded of course…we can all learn from… anyway , next topic.\" \"Are you still afraid of me, Cliff?\" Ricky teased. \"No, I just want to keep you focused.\" \"Thanks. I get you, man.\" Clifford patted his shoulder and smiled. \"Hey, thanks for taking care of my grandma's grave…and I know all those gorgeous pink roses last week came from you.\" Ricky waved his hand. \"I'd do anything for Grandma Peache! She taught me to trip the light fantastic!\" Clifford burst out laughing. \"I can't believe you took her up on that half drunk offer! You actually came back over the summer and asked for Lindy and Charleston lessons. You sure did trip alright. That was a riot!\" Ricky did a few wobbly dance moves and threw his arms out wide. \"She was a great teacher. We had a ball! You were too busy being embarrassed and missed all the fun.\" Clifford rolled his eyes. \"I joined in sometimes. But you two were insane.\" \"Insane enough to put on a show at the old folks home. Grandma Peache never gave up on me, she told me to live my life to the fullest and do what made me happy…I'm really trying, Cliff.\" Ricky replied soberly. After graduation and a few indecisive years, Ricky applied himself to a career as a guidance counselor and he made their old High School his stomping grounds. Ricky's chosen profession amazed Clifford at first, but he gradually understood that it was what he desperately needed. Ricky carried a dreadful notion that he he was undeserving to pursue a normal home and hearth, or have the joys and tribulations that came with a marriage and children. Ricky felt that kind of happiness was beyond him. He made an intentional decision to remain in Chicago and devote his life to helping others. It was the only way he felt he could atone for his brother's death. In his spare time he freelanced as a full-service mechanic. Ricky always kept himself busy; otherwise, he often told Clifford, the stillness would drive him mad. \"How's that kid coming along, the most recent case you're handling?\" Clifford asked. Ricky's eyes lit up. \"You mean Kelvin? He made some good progress! I got him to open up more about his home-life. His artwork gets better and better, and thankfully, less dismal. I even encouraged him to join the tutoring program, he excels in English.\" Clifford nodded, satisfied that he drew Ricky's mind away from one tragedy. However, his students had plenty of their own. Kelvin Randall was an African-American sophomore student at Lake View. He was a generally well-liked and rambunctious class-clown, but Ricky and his teachers noticed that Kelvin's entire demeanor changed. He became hostile and withdrew from his peers. An above average student, his grades dropped dramatically. Kelvin's little sister was killed in a crossfire shootout in their neighborhood. It started off as any normal evening in the projects –noisy and busy – but Kelvin always said everyone knew your name and had your back. Kelvin was supposed to go to the corner store for some last minute dinner staples, but lazily demanded his sister Kiara, do it. She never made it home alive. Ricky understood his deep pain and consequent guilt. After attending the funeral, he tried hard to get Kelvin under his wing. He observed how the teen talked of revenge and betrayed aggressive emotions against the perpetrators through dark, yet hauntingly picturesque drawings and graffiti. Once Kelvin got past the 'You wouldn't understand because you're old and white' phase, he heeded Ricky's counsel and developed a sort of kinship with him. He warmed up further once he realized Ricky suffered a similar tragedy at his age. \"That's good to hear, Ricky. You're really making a difference in these kid's lives…I'll never forget how you saved that girl.\" Ricky looked at Clifford and cringed, the memory struck him hard. A decade prior, Ricky helped establish a drug abuse program in the school. One of the first participants battled addiction, her parent's divorce, and a general overwhelming feeling of worthlessness. Both she and Ricky nearly took a tumble off the school rooftop one intense afternoon. \"That was too close a call, Clifford. I didn't get over it for weeks. She eventually got the proper help, and pulled through clean and sober. I never told you, but she came back to visit the school two years ago to thank me again for saving her. She said her life was spared in more ways than one. You know I hate crying in front of anyone, but she got my waterworks going. I really needed to hear that at the time, because I wondered whether or not to even continue as a counselor.\" \"That's beautiful. You are a fantastic counselor, Ricky. Everyone at Lakeview knows it too. You're not a quitter. They need you.\" As a result of his heroism, Ricky's daring rescue made headlines. It also dredged up his past and news articles resurfaced from when he supposedly found his brother shot in the head. The horrible unspoken truth was that Ricky lied. His brother grabbed for the gun Ricky foolishly played around with. It happened so fast with just one slip of his finger against the trigger. Rather than take the blame like his dying brother warned him to, he put the gun in his hand and said… \"I found him that way…\" Ricky announced. Clifford noticed Ricky drift into his own world, but this time avoided bringing him back to his senses. It happened the same way every year. Ricky needed a moment to reflect and become that misunderstood teenager again. His eyes glazed over with deep regret. \"I could never bring myself to tell my parents. My mother died believing it was an accident. My father always blamed himself and drifted away from us. I barely see him now, but I try and help him when I can. He can't work anymore, doctor's orders. He's old and miserable. In a way I blame him too. How could you keep a loaded gun in the house with two boys? Talk about irresponsible!\" Ricky fumed and staggered around the walkway and cracked his knuckles. \"My mom always told him to hide it, but dad just shoved it in a damn shoebox at the top of the closet. Anyone could have bit the bullet if they rummaged up there… arrgh …forget it! I'm sorry Clifford. All I do is repeat the same damn stories.\" Ricky reluctantly faced Clifford as he had so many years ago. Hot tears sprinkled past his eyelids and down his cheeks and his face turned pink with grief. \"All this pain and guilt…it never ends for me, and then I have to drag you here like it's some religious rite of passage!\" Clifford hung his head, it was not a big burden for him to support his best friend, but he felt that Ricky somehow needed to let go of his past. Another thought crossed his mind about their fateful night. He cautiously put a hand on his arm. \"Hey, I think I know what else is eating you. You never found her, did you?\" Ricky wiped his eyes and kicked at the floor disappointed. \"No…thirty years I've been in this city and we never crossed paths again. What a moron I was! We were stuck in that train car for over an hour during the black out and I never even got her last name.\" \"Well, Rick, I would hardly say you were in the mood to start a romance…but I know…it wasn't about that. She really helped you out, didn't she?\" Ricky clasped his hands across the back of his neck. \"It's weird, Cliff. We just got to talking and the stuff she said brought me back to reality. I mean, she came on that train as depressed and wrecked as I was, but when she saw I needed help…\" \"She forgot her troubles and comforted you…I understand. And she didn't coddle either, you told me she was pretty firm some of the time.\" Clifford grinned slyly. \"You gloated about what a hot babe she was for weeks! I couldn't take hearing it after a while.\" Ricky looked at him surprised. \"Cliff, you never told me that!\" He smiled. \"You weren't so nice to me either that night. If I remember you called me a damn ape and said I built a bike to go nowhere.\" Clifford shrugged. \"It was the truth, wasn't it?\" \"Yeah it was. I know I raved a lot about her. To this day, I can't get her face out of my head, even if the image dims with age. Her eyes were spectacular, they were huge and this soft shade of blue… she had a real cute nose and a giant smile. I loved her smile. A real… strong looking girl, but at the same time she was slight and fragile, ya know?\" Clifford laughed. \"Geez, Rick, you sound sixteen again. Are you sure she's not your long lost twin sister? The way you always described her I pictured you in a long wig!\" Ricky shoved him playfully. \"Get outta here! It's a known scientific fact that the people we become most attracted to and eventually marry usually have similar characteristics and facial traits…it's not absolute, but hey…\" \"I get it, man. People always said Shelly and I somehow just 'go' together. We both have big blue eyes, curly brown hair and all that too.\" \"Cliff, nobody, and I mean nobody, could have helped me as much as you and your family did all these years…it's just…I wish I could see her again, just to tell her that I'm alright. \" \"I know, but who knows what could have happened to her? There are any number of things…\" Ricky put his hand up. \"Believe me, I've counted them off in my head, marriage and family, death, she moved…death…dammit. She tried to tell me about her crummy life, but I was too caught up in my own mess. I hope it didn't come to that.\" Ricky folded his arms and leaned out over the tracks. The eleven o'clock train rolled in and he wanted to make sure to be on it. \"I'm just dreaming, man, don't mind me.\" Clifford yawned and backed toward the stairwell. \"Ricky, just like my grandmother said, whatever makes you happy, go for it. Because that's how I like to see you too… happy.[Chapter 2] \"That's the way I am…\" Chapter 2: Who's gonna drop dead? As the train pulled up to the station, Ricky gave Clifford a brisk handshake and hug. \"Be careful getting home, man. Can you make it okay?\" \"Ehh, don't worry about me…this is my territory. I'm all grown up now.\" \"True, but you don't have your bodyguard.\" Ricky grinned. The train doors slid open and Clifford pushed him inside. \"In this day and age, I'll need some weaponry too. But I pass. You care a lot about people don't you?\" Ricky glanced soberly at his boots. He caught his eye just as the door closed. \"You know me, Cliff, that's the way I am…\" As the train pulled out, Ricky settled down in a seat by the window. One elderly bag lady slept in the back. Ricky peered at her, just to make sure she was still alive. The old woman's head rolled forward and she snapped to attention. It wasn't her stop yet. Her sallow eyes drifted closed again and she snored. Ricky smiled. He crossed his arms and leaned back, lost in memories of that night. Flashback: 1979 Ricky couldn't look Clifford's way as the train rode out of the station. He was too embarrassed. Tears misted his eyes and made his cheeks itch when he rubbed them. Crap, I got snot on my sleeve. He thought. He last cried at his brother's funeral a year ago. He sank deeper into his seat. All his energy drained. It took all his vital force to admit the truth to Clifford. \"I didn't find him! I shot him! I shot him!...We were home alone and I was playing with my dad's gun, he said let me have it and I said no! I was too busy showing off like a damn fool. He got angry with me and grabbed it...and it fired! My God! I was laughing when it went off! Blood gushed out of the side of his head and he didn't even know it. He was afraid that when dad got home he'd get spanked. Do know what he said to me as he was dying? He said, 'You're gonna have to take the blame for this one.' I couldn't even do that right...I lied, I put the gun in his hand and said I found him that way!\" He never told anyone before. Aren't you supposed to feel relief when you confess your sins? He pondered. Where's mine? Right now Ricky didn't feel a thing. He could have bashed his head against the window bars ten times and it wouldn't have made a difference. But he had no clue what to do next. Loosening up and hanging with other students wasn't as bad as he imagined. They shared unreasonable fears and whispers among themselves, but when they actually came to know him, they liked him. That didn't make up for all the time Ricky spent being ridiculed. They warped his tragedy so much that he was believed to be a deranged cop-killer and rapist. It wasn't fair. Let this happen to one of them and see how they like it! He thought bitterly. I wouldn't have teased them or avoided them. Ricky's hands shook and he unclenched his fists. His oil stained fingernails dug into his palms so tight he drew a little blood. The sleeves of his jacket rose up and he saw the horrible reminders of his guilt scarred across his wrist. He balled his hands again and banged on his knees. Would anyone really care if he tried to do it again? His parents barely acknowledged him; he had no friends…except Clifford Peache. What was one friend in a world of billions of strangers? Clifford would forget him soon enough and muddle through the rest of High School. \"Who'd watch the little guy's back?\" Ricky whispered. \" I still owe him six bucks... screw it! He's got a loving family and a lot of money… he'll be alright.\" He resolved to have no hesitation this time, and he would have to make sure no one was home to catch him. His mind wandered with brutal preparations and the train entered into another station. A young woman dressed in faded denims staggered into the car and slammed herself in the seats across from Ricky. He glanced in her direction, not really seeing her, but just looking into space. She caught his eye and glared at him. \"What the hell are you looking at? You think I'm pretty? You think this is pretty! You're so tough, maybe you'd like to make it prettier?\" The make-up on her dark lined eyes smeared across her soft cheeks. His gaze lowered toward her mouth. She cupped her hand on the side of her lip and Ricky was startled to see a cut and rapidly swelling bruise. A few drops of blood dribbled from her nostril. Ricky instinctively raised his hand in a gentle motion, but he caught himself and drew it back to his coat. What was he going to do? Wipe it away? He eyed her sharply. \"No, it's not pretty! And don't assume I would do that.\" He fumed. \"And maybe I wasn't looking at you , alright.\" Ricky turned away from her and the flush of hurt and irritation attacked his cheeks. The girl was visibly distressed. She curled up against the window and whimpered. Ricky felt sorry, but she wasn't his problem right now. He hated when his thoughts were rudely interrupted. He pulled at his hair and mumbled. \"You damn freak, Ricky!\" He rocked back and forth. \"You monster! Just do it already and drop dead! Drop dead! Drop dead!\" The girl stopped crying and wiped her face and bloody nose with a crumpled tissue from her pocket. She slid from her seat and plopped herself next to him. She nudged his arm. \"Who's gonna drop dead?\" Ricky couldn't raise his head from his hands. \"Me!\" \"Why?\" \"Because I'm a nobody. I deserve to!\" \"Why, what did you do?\" \"I did something horrible and unforgivable…just leave it at that.\" \"People do horrible things every day…pick your head up, look at my face.\" Ricky slowly lifted his head, and for the first time, really stared at the girl. Despite the nasty bruises, she was lovely. Her blue eyes glowed vividly from the tears creating swirls of violet. They reminded him of the Siamese cats he used to feed in his alley at night that always knew when he was home and whined by the back door for treats. She couldn't have been more than seventeen. Her features were strong for a girl so young. He admired them. \"I'm looking…\" He whispered glumly. \"Now what?\" \"This really hurts, you know? You wanna know who did this?\" \"No…\" \"My boyfriend!\" \"He beats you to a pulp and you still call him your boyfriend?\" Ricky groaned. \"That's stupid.\" The girl clamped her mouth shut and nodded. \"You're right, he's my ex- boyfriend. That loser!\" She nudged Ricky again. \"He did something horrible, and I know I'll forgive him later, even if I want to kill him right now.\" Ricky sighed and sat up tall. He forced himself to give her his attention otherwise she would nudge him the whole ride. \"Sure…and then you'll go back to him like an abused housewife. I see it all the time.\" \"I will not! I'll never take him back, I don't need him any more.\" \"Yeah, otherwise, you may not have a face left. You need that.\" The girl folded her arms stubbornly. \"Didn't you get my point…about people doing horrible things?\" Ricky shrugged. \"Not really. What's the fact that he beats you have to do with me? In case you're wondering, I don't beat up on women.\" \" Rrr! I mean …that horrible things can be forgiven, so whatever you've done, can be forgiven too.\" Ricky rolled his eyes. \"Where do you get this stuff? Dear Abby? \" The girl perked up. \"Yeah, how'd you know? I love her column…and her sisters, Ann Landers and Doctor Joyce! Umm, I think they're all sisters…\" Ricky shook his head. \"Only Ann and Abby… arrgh, What I've done can never be… uhh …undone.\" \"Of course it can't. We can't go back in time and change things like that, but we can always move on.\" She leaned over and gripped his wrist. Ricky flinched, but didn't pull away. She ran her fingers over his scars sympathetically. \"Every time I read or hear about someone who killed themselves, I want to cry…and I usually do . Our lives can never be that bad if we compare it to others in the world…at least it shouldn't be… aww crud, I'm gonna cry again.\" She choked and turned her head away, but didn't let go of his wrist and tenderly stroked it. Ricky enjoyed the sensation but slowly eased it from her hands. \"Hey, don't cry for me, you don't even know me.\" \"So what? You're another human being and that's enough.\" \"Big deal, people die every second of the day. We can't waste our tears for all of them.\" Ricky kicked at the chair in front of him. She sniffled and flicked her hair. Ricky could tell she flat-ironed it. It hung parted down the middle and waved slightly past her shoulders. A few dark chestnut strands brushed across his cheek and he liked its softness. He imagined she did that on purpose, but he didn't mind. \"Then…whom are you wasting your tears on?\" She questioned. Ricky's jaw hung open…was he really only crying for his brother… or himself? He tilted his head confused. \"I...I don't know anymore.\" \"Look, I didn't say you can't have a moment to cry…we all need that. I was just wondering.\" Ricky fidgeted as the train made another stop and more people boarded with passing glances at the two of them. One woman in a business suit glowered at him severely and continued down to the opposite row of seats. The girl pretended to be oblivious and played with the zipper on her denim jacket. Ricky slumped down again and elbowed her. \"Hey listen, why don't you go sit somewhere else?\" \"What do you mean? I'm not bothering you, am I?\" \"Yeah, you are. I came on here to be by myself, not to hear your pep talks.\" \"What's the matter? I can move behind you, but then you'd have to keep turning your neck to talk…If I move in front, I'll have to strain to talk to you, I'm happy sitting here.\" Ricky gaped at her. \"Happy? Who says I even wanna talk to you? I don't know you.\" \"No one says, but I'm trying to keep your mind off what you were thinking before. I don't know you either, but this is how people connect.\" Ricky heaved his arms up and down. \"Sure. So now you're a mind-reader? What was I thinking?\" The girl put her leg up. She sat upon it and then faced him. She leaned over and pulled a piece of lint from his curls. He jerked his head. \"I'm not gonna bite you! I'll tell you what you were thinking, you were thinking of finding another way to do yourself in.\" \"I was not!\" \"Yes, you were. I heard you mumbling.\" \"And if I was? So what? What does it have to do with you? Thinking and doing are two different things.\" \"Thoughts lead to actions. And it has nothing to do with me, but I made a vow to myself a minute ago. You are not getting off this train until you promise me you won't hurt yourself.\" Ricky actually laughed aloud. \"Are you for real? You know, I think you're a little nuts, maybe that boyfriend of yours hit you too hard.\" The girl's expression saddened and she casually punched him. \"That's not funny! I know why you don't want me to sit next to you; you don't want all these people to think you beat me up. You look like you would smack me around with that smelly green jacket and those heavy metal combat boots!\" Ricky's embarrassment flared as her voice raised. \"This is my style, it doesn't make me an abuser.\" How tall are you anyway?\" She calmed down. Ricky patted the top of his head. \"Around 6'3…but I think I have another inch to go.\" \"Wow, you're huge! That's way cool, I bet nobody messes with you.\" She said coyly. \"Height makes might.\" Ricky looked down miserable. Two days ago Moody's bullies messed with him in front of all his peers…and he just let it happen. \"Yeah, whatever.\" \"Seriously, you have a bunny face, but I bet you can kick major butt.\" Ricky threw up his hand. \"Alright already! I don't like getting into fights, even if I look like I do it for a living. I'm not as badass as everyone thinks…or wants me to be!\" \"Who wants you to fight?\" \"Everyone at school. It's a long story, just drop it.\" Ricky's eyes averted toward the window at the elevated tracks and he observed the flashing street and house lights zoom past. 'Maybe if I ignore her she'll go away.' He decided. However, now he wasn't so sure he wanted her to leave. Two minutes of silence passed between them, he watched from the corner of his eye as she dug into her red purse and rummaged for a small mirror and face powder. She tried her best to conceal her bruises. Her nose stopped bleeding, but swelled up pink. He felt bad for laughing. If the guy who did this to her was on the train now, Ricky would have broken his nose. She was too interesting and pretty to be treated like that. That wasn't a nice thought either; no woman should be treated so cruelly. He tapped his fingers on the sill and continued to mull over his failings. \"Why don't you dunk your head in a tubful of water and stick your finger in a socket. That aught to work. Toss a blow dryer in for good measure. You're so intent on killing yourself even though it won't change a darn thing, you still did what you did.\" She said coolly. \"Great idea! Should I use hot or cold water?\" He retorted. The girl exhaled disappointed. She grasped his arm until he looked her way angry. \"Now what? You're very pushy.\" \"You're impossible! I guess the whole world revolves only around you, huh?\" She waved her arm and pointed out the few passengers sitting at the other side. \"Look at all these people closely. That woman reading Harlequin in the corner has a career. I bet she has kids too, but her boss asked her to stay late and she's all grumpy because she wasn't home to cook them dinner or help with the homework and tuck them to bed. That brother with the little 'fro is grooving to his boom box, he's having a great old time listening to Kool and the gang . The way he's bopping he might be composing his own song, but he hasn't been discovered yet. That beefy guy next to him in the dusty uniform? See how he's turning his ring with a smile? Yeah, the music pees him off, but all he can think about is going home and cuddling up with his beautiful wife of fifteen years. And why not? He's a construction worker, he put in a real hard day's work making sure we have roofs over our heads.\" Ricky forced his gaze on everyone. He could imagine the exact scenarios. He looked away moodily. \"So. What's that gotta do with what happened to me?\" \"A lot! I bet I know what you do. You stomp through the city and look at everyone who's even remotely happy or secure and think, how could they? How could they just carry on while I'm suffering? You're drowning in your own ego!\" Ricky held his cheek. \"Aren't we observant? Can I see your shrink license? What do you know about it?\" \"I'm not a scholar, but I know how to read people.\" Everything she told him dug under his skin and made sense, just like Clifford's words earlier. He lowered his eyes and his mouth drooped sadly. \"Alright…I get you, now please, I just wanna be alone.\" The girl surprised him and stood up from the seat. She adjusted her purse strap over her shoulder and smiled. He noticed that she did it despite the pain it caused her face, and he was instantly attracted. Her wide-mouthed smile bared a lot of decently straight and white teeth. She leaned toward him and patted his shoulder. \" Okay Greta Garbo, I'm leaving now. I'm not completely convinced that you won't try anything stupid…but I know I did my part as a caring fellow human.\" The girl shrugged and walked ahead a few steps. The train suddenly lurched back with a deafening squeal. Ricky dove to the side and made a grab for her before she was thrown down face-forward. Everyone stumbled frontward from the instant break and the lights flickered off and plunged them into darkness.[Chapter 3] \"That's the way I am…\" Chapter 3: Start Living The girl landed across Ricky's lap and tossed her arms around his neck. Their cheeks pressed close and they watched with dread as every light in the vicinity went black. Ricky turned his face, his nose brushed against hers and she drew back slightly from the pain. He hoped his breath didn't stink, but she didn't pull away from him. \"It's okay, I think it's just a black out…maybe a brown out. It's happened before.\" Ricky said. \"Not when I was trapped on a train!\" She said fearfully. \"It's so dark. I'm scared.\" The boom box music died down and the construction worker clapped for attention. \"Hey everyone! The conductor will probably come through the cars and he'll tell us what to do. I think we should all sit tight and wait for him. We're okay up here, this train isn't goin' anywhere.\" With that announcement he took his seat. The others shuffled in their places and murmured to themselves. The businesswoman called out irritably. \"I have to get home to my kids, this is ridiculous!\" \"We can't help it lady, we all wanna get home, but it's just the way it is…unless you wanna jump?\" The construction worker said. Ricky and the girl peered out the window again; sure enough, the train halted in dead center on the elevated track, with no solid landing on either side. She sighed and loosened her hold on his neck. \"I don't wanna be trapped up here…what if there's a maniac on the train. He'll come get us!\" Ricky tried not to laugh, but failed. \"A maniac? Don't you think he would have tried to kill us when the were lights on?\" He was so close that her minty warm breath exhilarated his senses. She cracked the gum in her mouth and swallowed. \"Yeah, but it's pitch black, now he can move about freely and no one will see him! He might have a gun...or an ax!\" \"Oh boy. You watch too many horror films.\" The fear deepened in her rich voice and she curled herself up higher against him. \"Will…will you protect me, Ricky?\" \"Hey, how did you know my name?\" \"I heard you say it when you were calling yourself a freak…it's a cute name. So… will you protect me?\" She asked again. Ricky's vision adjusted to the darkness and the moonlight beamed through. It illuminated her wide eyes. He felt her slender body tremble. He shifted himself uneasily, but a warm feeling spread through him. \"Sure, I'll protect you. But uhh …can you at least tell me your name?\" \"It's Coral…I know, that's a weird name. Apparently I was conceived on a beach and something stuck my mother in the backside all night.\" She offered the explanation, even though Ricky hadn't asked. He liked her name, and thought it was unique. \"Were your parents hippies or something?\" \"They were more like lame beatniks, so uncool.\" Her face darkened, but then she shook it off and laughed at him. \"But anyway …I think I'm okay now. I'm sorry for crushing your knees with my big thighs.\" She slid off his lap reluctantly, but stayed near to him. Ricky looked away and wiped the tiny drops of sweat from his brow. Did she have to talk about her thighs in the dark, while she was sitting on his lap? Yes, she did, because girls were sometimes just that unconscious to the lusting of men. \"They're…not big… you got long legs, that's all.\" He mumbled. \"Yeah, odd thing is, I'm not that tall, but I'm not a shrimp. What do you think? I'm 5'6.\" \"That's a lot shorter than me…I'd say you were just about average. I don't know. It's getting hot in here.\" \"Take off that jacket. I bet you wear it twenty-four seven, don't you? It's your comfort coat, you can hide in it, and it gives you sense of empowerment.\" \"Jeesh, Coral, it's just a jacket and I like it. That's all.\" Ricky smiled crookedly. She was really on to him. \"Okay, whatever you say. I just know these things... You see this denim jacket? It's my favorite and sometimes it hardly comes off either. Except right now.\" She scooted herself over and removed the jacket and placed it over her lap. She wore a frilly, cream colored, peasant blouse with bell sleeves and she toyed with ribbons on her chest. Ricky tried not stare at her slender fingers as she absentmindedly stroked her cleavage. His legs shook. \"That feels a little better…come on, try it. Don't be afraid to show yourself.\" She whispered. \"Show myself? I'm right here. Besides, it's dark, whose gonna see me anyway?\" Coral leaned across him and tugged on his coat sleeve until it was half off his arm. Ricky gave up and removed the coat. He tossed it over the seat in front of him. \"Is that better? Now you can see my grungy tee-shirt and rock hard abs.\" \"Actually, I can't see it, but I know it's white. Woof, I can smell it. Is that motor oil?\" \"Yeah, I umm …know how to fix cars and stuff.\" He was disappointed she didn't comment on his abs. Ricky just discovered the pleasures of lifting weights and relieving his tensions through strength training, but he was still a novice. \"Awesome! You should be a mechanic…when you grow up.\" She insisted. \"Maybe I will. I like it.\" Coral pointed to the sky and smiled. \"Isn't the moon gorgeous? I hate that we can't see things more bathed in its glow, all because of the stupid street lamps and artificial lighting.\" Ricky glanced upward with a small grin. \"Yeah, it's great. I have a telescope at home. I used to always take it out to the yard and stare into space. I love meteor showers. It's totally amazing what you see up there.\" \"Used to? What do you mean? Did it break?\" Ricky shrugged . \"Nahh …I just stopped taking it out, that's all.\" \"Why? Did the sparkling, infinite universe suddenly get boring?\" She pressed. Ricky sighed. She asked too many questions. \"No, I just didn't have time for it, I had other things on my mind.\" Coral nodded slowly. \"Right, like that horrible, unforgivable thing you did, it killed all your joys, didn't it?\" Ricky glared at her, almost menacingly, but she wasn't swayed. She stared just as hard until his gaze faltered and he looked down. There was no sense trying to play the towering tough with her. He liked her too much and already told her he'd protect her. \"It killed a lot of things…believe me.\" \"I believe you, Ricky. Do you wanna tell me what you did?\" Ricky suddenly felt his chest constrict. He grasped the seat and shook his head doggedly. \"No way… no …I can't.\" \"Why can't you?\" \"Because I can't, okay? Stop bugging me about it.\" \"I'm not trying to bug, I'm trying to help.\" She insisted. \"I didn't ask for your help, Coral.\" \"But I'm giving it any way. Alright, keep it to yourself, then. That's your prerogative.\" Ricky felt very stifled beside her. He scratched his head and tried figure out how to ask her to move it…kindly. \"Coral, do you mind sitting on this side where my jacket is? I have to stretch my legs out.\" He couldn't quite see her reaction, but she rose and gripped his hand. \"What's the matter?\" \"I'm still scared. I don't want to lose you, Ricky. Just hold my hand while I switch over?\" He sensed a much deeper meaning behind her pleas. Ricky clutched her cool fingers tight. His hand was very warm and he rubbed his palm against hers soothingly. He raised his arm and led her around to the opposite side. As soon as she was comfortable he leaned back and put up his legs across the attached seat. They were stiff from sitting down for so long. He heard her laugh. \"What's so funny?\" \"Your legs! Talk about long! They almost reach the other side of the aisle. \"If the maniac comes running in here, I'll trip him up for ya. Maybe he'll fall on his own axe.\" He ducked before she could swipe his head and they both laughed. As if on cue, the door between the train cars swung open. Coral nearly jumped in the air and they groped for each other frightened. Keys rustled and a flashlight beamed across all the other sour faces in the car. \"Hey, I'm the conductor and my name is Dwayne. I'm just making sure everything is cool here. As you can see, this end of the city had a minor black out and we may be stuck for the next half-hour or more. I'm sorry, but there's no way to let anyone off right now.\" The passengers grumbled, but accepted their fate and the conductor shut off his flashlight. \"If anyone has to use the bathroom, try to hold it in or you'll have to make your way down to my end of the train, just be careful crossing between cars.\" With that brief announcement, he left them alone again. Coral wriggled out of Ricky's arms. She lay back against the wall and put one knee up and one arm over his seat. \"Ricky, tell me more about yourself and your life. You go to school, right?\" \"Uhh, yeah. I'm a sophomore… well...\" Ricky flushed with embarrassment, it sounded very juvenile to say it. \"Actually, I'm repeating a year, I should be a junior. I just kinda dropped out of school last year after…the thing happened.\" \"Oh, that's rough. I'm glad you decided to go back though. That's a good sign. I'm seventeen and a senior. I'm so happy to only have three months left.\" Ricky's admiration soared even higher. His instincts were right. She was an older woman. \"Go on, tell me more. You have any girlfriends?\" She needled. Why did women always want to know that? Grandma Peache predicted he would, but it hadn't quite happened yet. \"No, not right now, I'm just working on getting myself together.\" \"I totally understand that, besides, things…things can happen in relationships, you know? Things you're totally not ready for.\" She said cryptically, then smiled. \"Umm, so, who are your friends? Tell me even more.\" ~Oo~ Ricky found his comfort zone with Coral and decided to open up about High School. He wasn't having the time of his life, but he reached a point where he finally adjusted, even if the school year was almost over. Coral was an enthusiastic listener, and deeply involved in what he said. He told her about Clifford and their friendship. He talked about being a bodyguard and the showdown with Moody. He even admitted his failure to stand up against Mike and Moody in the park and how he chickened out and ran away. Coral listened patiently then sat back and put her hand up to silence him. \"Wait a minute! Hold on. You mean to tell me you have a best friend in school?\" \"Isn't that what I've been saying this whole time? Yeah, it's Clifford Peache. And I guess his grandma.\" Coral clicked her teeth disapprovingly. \"And you're sitting on this train deciding whether or not to end your life?\" Why did she have to keep going back to that topic? He nearly forgot it. \"Ye…yes… yes …I am.\" He replied hesitant. \"So, there actually are people who love and care about you? Yet you want to be selfish.\" She said disappointed. Ricky looked at her exasperated. \"What do you mean? I'm not selfish at all!\" \"Yes, you are. You mope around day after day lost in your own pain. Then you plot to take your life, and nearly succeeded the first time.\" She cringed, thinking of his wrist. \"But you can't even stop to think how much grief, worry and stress you'd cause to the people who do love you. That's selfish.\" She glared at him, but sympathy flickered in her eyes. Ricky sat back and folded his arms with the demeanor of a scolded child. When he ran away from the park after his bike was dumped in the lake, Clifford made every effort to find him. He went to his house and his weary mother begged him to call her if he heard anything from Ricky. Clifford ran all over the city to places he thought Ricky might have been and braved the rough neighborhoods and dirty junkyards. How did Ricky thank him for his concern? He demanded money and ran off again like a spoiled brat. He made Clifford chase him through the dark and deserted city blocks until they hit the train station. After a confrontation, Ricky nearly beat the poor little guy up when he tried to be reasonable about the tragedy. Clifford had some of his facts wrong, but that was because Ricky lied to everyone. Clifford took a giant risk with losing their friendship in order to help him. Ricky held his head and sniffled. Clifford really did care about him as a best friend, and the fact that he knew Ricky was the one who accidentally pulled the trigger on his own brother didn't change things between them. It would only change if Ricky withdrew, as he so often did. Ricky felt Coral stroke his hair and she talked delicately. \"There's someone who cares, Ricky. Whether it's one person or a million… that can mean the whole difference between life and death. You know what, count two, three with grandma, count… me.\" The sensation of a human touch warmed his spirit. He couldn't recall when he last felt a gesture so simple, yet so loving. He wanted to cry out loud, but held it in. Ricky raised his dampened eyes to her and a realization pounded him. He blathered about himself all night. Ricky 'Selfish' Linderman. He examined her face through the shadows. The blood around her lip crusted. He reached over and patted her shoulder. \"Hey, does it hurt really bad?\" Coral stared at him in awe from his one genuine question for her and he felt ashamed. \"Only when I talk too much.\" She whispered. \"I'll live. Everything heals in time.\" Coral talked a lot, Ricky realized. She talked non-stop through her pain to keep him from dying. \"Why did it happen?\" The moonlight danced in her eyes, but her mouth curled up regrettably. \"Ricky, that's a secret I'm going to keep.\" She gingerly ran her hand over her cheek and lowered her face to hide her tears. With that one gesture, Ricky had an epiphany. Regardless of what happened, the world did not revolve around him . There were so many others out there battling diseases, oppression, heartache and death, and they still did it with a smile and loving heart...just like Coral. Ricky had a choice to keep embracing all the darkness in his life or to grab for the light. He had the opportunity to live and somehow use his own tragedy as a way to help others. He would not take that for granted. Tomorrow he resolved to go back to the park, fish out his bike, and stand up against the rotten bullies once and for all. Ricky leaned forward and draped his arms over the seat before her. His pulse raced and he licked his lips. Coral did the same and she raised her hands to his face. \"Ricky I...\" She stopped, and waited for him to say what he wanted to say. \"Coral, do you think that we can…\" The train lurched and she clung to his sleeve frightened. \"I think the blackout's over. Don't worry, I'm still here.\" He reassured her with a large grin as the lights gradually came on. The city outside was once more blanketed in the artificial glow of neon and orange. Everyone clapped when the conductor announced they would move in no time. Coral glanced out the window with a wry smile. \"Well wouldn't you know it, my stop is next.\" Coral put on her jacket and zipped it up. She swung her purse over her arm and composed herself. Ricky followed her lead and put on his coat too. \"Ricky, It's been great talking to you and I wish you all the best. So, are you going back to school tomorrow?\" The cloud of passion dissipated and Ricky sighed. \"Yeah… maybe …it's Friday though. I might as well start the week off fresh on Monday. I'm definitely gonna get my bike back. I worked too damn hard on that thing to let it rust in the lake.\" \" Hot dog! That's wonderful! I hope to see it someday.\" \"Sure! You can take a ride on it too.\" \"That would be so fun!\" She giggled. \"I'll hold you to it. Rain or shine, or snow!\" \"You're on!\" The train slowed down into the station. Coral pushed her hair back and whispered in his ear. \"Give him a wallop for me. \" She attempted to leave and he tugged on her arm. They gazed into each others eyes. Coral tilted her head demurely and leaned against him. Ricky sat back on the window and clutched her waist. She held his shoulders and kissed him slowly on the lips. Ricky absorbed it with a gentle passion, being wary of her wounds. She pulled back. \"I really have to go now, goodbye, Ricky.\" As she moved between the doors Ricky jumped up and blocked them from closing. He hugged her close. \"Wait, Coral. let me come with you! It's late, it's dangerous. I'll take you home. I really need to talk to you more.\" She put a hand on his chest. The train couldn't pull out until he moved from the doorway and the conductor rang the alarm. \"No Ricky, you don't need to do that. You just need to… start living.\" Coral stepped out of the entrance and the doors closed in Ricky's face. He put his hands on the windowpane and banged it desperately. She shook her head and smiled. Ricky didn't move from the window until long after the train pulled out and he no longer saw her.[Chapter 4] \"That's the way I am…\" Chapter 4: The way you are Present day Ricky woke up startled and rubbed his face. He yawned loudly and scratched his beard. Whenever it started to itch like this he knew it was time to go clean-shaven. He pulled off his baseball cap and shoved it in his coat pocket. He dozed way beyond his destination. \"Oh well, just like the old days…riding the rails until the sun comes up.\" He mused. \"It's the weekend anyway.\" He looked behind him. The bag lady was long gone and left a flowered patch of fabric from her worn out knitting bag on the seat. He was the only one left inside the car and when he glanced at his watch it was half past midnight. He would have to get out and cross over the platform. The train pulled into the station and he waited by the sliding doors. As soon as they opened a woman rushed inside, she was checking her text messages and carrying a few shopping bags in her other hand. A large, stuffed, tote bag with the letters ' WGN RADIO' hung off her shoulder. She didn't look up fast enough and slammed into Ricky's chest. Ricky grabbed her arms before she staggered backward. He pulled her into the car and the doors slammed closed behind her. \" Alright …I'll get off at the next one.\" He sighed. \"Are you okay, Miss?\" The woman dropped her bags startled. She snapped her cell phone shut embarrassed. \"I am so sorry, sir. I didn't think anyone would be in this side of the train at night, I should have been more careful. Did I hurt you?\" \" Naw, I've been through worse scuffles. That was just a love tap. Here, let me help ya with these.\" Ricky crouched down to pick up her groceries and smiled to ease her fears. He stared closely at her and in a flash, time reversed thirty years. Her eyes widened with concern, but she gently smiled back at him. She knelt down and they slowly reached for the same bag. The woman cocked her head confused. \"Do…do I know you?\" \"I was thinking the same thing.\" He handed her bag over and helped her off the floor. \"I know we've met before.\" Ricky quickly took in her form. No longer dressed in shabby, bell bottom jeans, she wore a dark blue cashmere sweater that complimented the similar hues in her eyes and black slacks with smart low-heeled boots. He couldn't help staring, even when she finished adjusting her bags and backed away disconcerted. She aged fabulously, and carried herself with an air of grace. Ricky dusted his hands on his thighs and stood tall. He had to stop gazing at her or she was liable to call the cops. \"Forgive me for staring like a weirdo.\" He mustered. \"But is your name… Coral?\" She nodded slowly. \"Yes, how…how did you…\" Her expression brightened and a delighted grin spread across face. She lowered her bags on the seat and raised a hand to her mouth. \" Oh my God …it can't be… Ricky? Ricky, is that you?\" She demanded. He found her. \"It sure is! Ricky Linderman! In 1979 on this exact night and in this very last train car you helped to bring me back to the real world and saved my life… Coral! I can't believe it! I never thought I'd see you again! I couldn't find you, I never got your last name or anything!\" He blurted out excited. Ricky restrained himself from rushing to her. Coral made it easier for him. She ran over and threw herself into his arms. She laughed aloud and he hugged her as he had that night. His senses exploded as he held her. She smelled of elegant, sweet perfume and he caught a whiff of the same mint bubblegum on her breath that enticed him years ago. His briefly ran his hand ran through her soft hair. It was shorter and wavier, and colored a deep reddish brown that delicately balanced her golden skin tones. Coral let loose whimpers of shock and happiness as she rocked him and patted his back. She finally pulled away for a fuller inspection, and a demure smile crossed her lips. He distinctly remembered it as the same smile she gave him right before she kissed him goodbye that night. \"It's Coral Bennett ! Ricky, you look wonderful! You haven't aged a day! Oh my…I feel like an old bag… how did?.…Where?…I'm thrilled! I can't even speak…and that's all I do for a living, talk, talk, talk! Come, sit down, we have so much catching up to do!\" Ricky followed her to the seats and plopped down across from her to better observe her face. 'God, she's still so beautiful.' He thought helplessly. Clifford was right. Seeing her again made him feel like a lusty sixteen year-old, but a wholesome, mature feeling enveloped him. His gaze quickly averted to her left hand. There was no wedding band. He glanced at their surroundings and cracked a wry smile. \"Coral, I know this may seem awkward and it's really late, but…can I just take you out for a cup of coffee? I think I about had it with trains tonight.\" Coral's eyes lowered shyly and she wrung her hands. She came back to her senses. They were almost complete strangers, but understood the significance of their meeting. She never forgot the handsome and desperately lost teenage boy on the train and often wondered if he took his life. Sometimes, the thought of him brought her to tears. She looked up and firmly nodded. \"Yes you may, Ricky Linderman…and I want to hear everything.\" ~Oo~ For over an hour Ricky and Coral talked, only this time, Ricky was adamant that she tell him about her life. He was shocked to learn that Coral was Dr. C, the warm hearted, and feisty talk-therapist on late night 720AM. Ricky always felt her voice and the way she imparted advice was vaguely familiar, but he never put it together. Coral chided him for not calling the station and he admitted that there were times he put his hand on the receiver, but chickened out. \"I'm terrible…I'm really not big with the Internet and all this stuff for myself, I only use it for the kids and research about programs, colleges and all that.\" He admitted. \"I should have looked you up sooner.\" \"Don't worry, I was in hiding anyway. After six years on the air, my producers finally convinced me to start my own promotional website and blog…it's in development. I'm a very private person and I'm still leery, but they told me not to worry. Most of the time they'll have people running it for me. I just need to dish out the talk. They also secured some publishing deals and want me to write a book! I'm overwhelmed by it all, but I think I just might.\" Ricky grinned and winked. \"I'll make it a best-seller and buy every copy. You shouldn't lose sleep about being online, just watch out for the posers and stalkers. I've dealt with a few cases of…'mistaken identity' with my students. Whatever happened to face to face contact to meet the man or woman of your dreams? I can't fathom how people fall in love with blurry videos and chat boxes. Ehh… I don't know, we come from an older generation, back when the only webs were made by spiders.\" Coral playfully swatted him. \"Speak for yourself! I'm not ready for the pine box yet. But really, face-to-face contact seems old hat now. They say you reveal more emotions and unfortunately drop your guard easier when you can't see the person's facial reactions. It happens so fast…but I understand your point. It's hard to imagine it can be 'real.' It's not every day strangers meet on a train…\" She trailed off self-conscious, but Ricky smiled and changed the subject. After getting past the formalities, Ricky wanted to cut down to the serious talk about the events that led them to their fateful meeting thirty years ago. Coral sipped her coffee and picked at the cranberries in her muffin. \"Are you sure you wanna hear all this old drama?\" \"Yes. It's your turn now. Ladies first.\" Ricky urged her. \"So your big question is, why did I come on that train battered?\" \"And why didn't you let me escort you home? I thought for sure after our kiss…\" Ricky tapped his long fingers against the cup and shrugged. \"Well...never mind that, just what was going on in your teenage life, Coral?\" \"Ricky, before I jumped on the train I was on a lousy date with my boyfriend, his name was Stevie. I planned to break it off with him that night but first I had something extremely important to tell him.\" Ricky examined her facial expressions and groaned inwardly. He saw it a number of times on the young girls at school. It was her withdrawn stare and biting of the lip that clued him in to her next announcement. \"That week I found out I was pregnant, Ricky. I already got a beating from my dad and then I ran out of the house to find Stevie. He took the news exactly the same way! Even before I told him, I knew I didn't want him involved in my life. He didn't really care either way. He called me a dumb broad and used goods and said I should get rid of it.\" Every muscle clenched in Ricky's body. The two men whom she should have been able to trust the most let her down. That night she was beaten twice. Coral shook and had to put down her cup. Ricky clutched her hand and drew his thumb across her fingers. \"Go on, Coral. It's okay.\" Her eyes lit up tearfully. \"My father was abusive to me and my mom. It went on for years…and of course when I was old enough, I started dating losers just like him. I let that vicious pattern control my life. It went that way for a while before I could come to terms with myself. I realized I was responsible for my own future and had to start making the right choices or turn into one big, depressed bruise. Did I want to wallow in self-pity and be a victim? Or did I want to pick myself up and start over? My first life-altering choice was to keep my baby, regardless of what happened and who helped me or not. My mother adored her and my father relented too. I had a beautiful girl…her name is Rachel.\" Coral smiled as the tears rolled down her cheeks. \"Do you know that I've been a grandmother for four years already? I have two granddaughters and a loving son-in law. I always knew grandmothers get younger every year, but come on…at forty-seven there's still a chance for me to have another child!\" She laughed. Ricky tried to fathom the elegant woman before him as 'Grandma Bennett' and he shook his head in disbelief. Clifford's grandmother was eighty years old when they were still in High School. \"Wow, so, Rachel's your only child? You never married?\" \"I did …and just like before, I wound up with another abusive jerk. Kevin. Up until ten years ago we didn't live in Chicago, we were in California because of his business. The only things he gave to me besides high blood pressure and a few black eyes were my beautiful sons. I have one at home, Charlie. He's in tenth grade, and the other is Scott, and he's away in his second-year of college. Scott dislikes his dad but Charlie's more forgiving. We all get along though…too little, too late of course.\" Coral resisted the urge to slam the table. She abruptly sobbed and Ricky clutched her. She laid her head upon his shoulder and wiped her eyes and nose with a table napkin he handed her. \"Ricky, I feel so embarrassed sitting here telling you all this. You must think I'm a big fraud. A clueless hack that knows how to dish it out but can't take her own advice!\" Ricky forced her gaze sympathetically. \"Absolutely not! You're a sweet hearted human being with troubled and honest life experiences. You desired to share what you've learned to prevent others from hurting themselves. You had that quality even as a teen and you know what? You taught me to do the same. I never in a million years thought I'd become a guidance counselor. At sixteen I never even thought I'd make it to graduation…but I did. I survived, because on this night, you and my best friend Clifford taught me that having friends that care enough…even if they have to be tough about it…makes all the difference between life and death.\" Ricky closed his mouth and looked up solemnly. God, I hate crying in front of people. When he looked back at Coral, she was smiling. \"Oh Ricky, I…I remember saying something like that to you before I left. What a man you've become. I know I sound like an old biddy, but I'm so proud of you.\" ~Oo~ They left the bistro a few minutes later. As they strolled back to the train station, Ricky casually draped his arm over her shoulder and Coral leaned closer to him. \"So tell me, Dr. C, what's a professional like you doing running around with heavy packages and taking trains in the middle of the night? It's dangerous\" Coral shrugged. \"I have to put my car in the shop. I think it died yesterday. I don't know what's wrong, it's only five years old.\" Ricky cleared his throat loudly. \"I wouldn't think of having you put it in a 'shop.' You're talking to a licensed mechanic, my dear…or did you forget? This jacket is ingrained with motor oil and grease.\" He patted down his pockets. \"I think I have a business card somewhere.\" Coral sniffed it and laughed. \"You're right…oh Ricky! That's the same smelly coat! Old habits do die hard!\" \"I've retained a lot of my youth.\" He said smugly. \"I see. The years have been very kind to you physically.\" She murmured and looked at him eagerly. \"I'll gladly be your customer. What's your price?\" Ricky's eyes darted back and forth and he pretended to be lost in thought. \"Well, what do you say to having dinner with me some time… soon?\" \"You're fixing my car and all you want is for me to buy you…\" \" No. I'm buying dinner…the price is that you let me take you out on a date.\" His eyes sparkled under the streetlamp as he watched her fidget and shy away. He nudged her. \"I promise before I do anything, I will come to your home and speak to the man of the house.\" Coral laughed. \"Really! Charlie has been trying to get me to date for years. I know he's desperate for a father figure. It's Scott you'll have to impress. That poor kid grew up around all the fighting and Rachel too. Still, she'd be thrilled to…\" Coral immediately cut herself off, she presumed much too far ahead. \"I'm sorry. Never mind all that. Sherman, set the way back machine for two minutes!\" Ricky understood, but he shared her earnestness. The night couldn't have turned out any better even if he planned it. He laughed. \"That's right up my alley. I play a father figure every day.\" He said gently. Coral put her arm across his waist and they walked the rest of the way to the depot. They reminisced and shared anecdotes from their lives all the way home. ~Oo~ Ricky insisted on accompanying her until she was safely at the door to her modest 1-family house. He stayed on the bottom porch step and the nightlight sprang on. \"Here you are, safe and sound. No black outs or run-ins with ax murderers.\" Coral shook her head with a relieved sigh. \"Still a bodyguard. Ricky, I'm sorry you were dragged halfway around the city. You must be exhausted.\" \" Nahh …I'm wide awake now! Seeing you again rejuvenated me. It was a little rough earlier though.\" In the bistro, Ricky explained to her about his yearly visits to the train station with Clifford. \"Oh, I'm sorry. I understand…tonight's the night. We'll definitely talk more about that. It's truly been wonderful seeing you again after all this time. Amazing, actually. I don't want us to be strangers.\" \"Five minutes after we first met again…you weren't at all.\" He admitted. Ricky put his hands in his pockets as the wind and cold air picked up. Coral eased her way down the steps and casually zippered his coat. \"It's miraculous how it still fits, it grew with you.\" \"It's a little short on the arms, but I can live with it. When I get old and shrink, it will fit perfectly again.\" Coral patted his chest and dusted off his shoulders. \"Sure, in a hundred years. You know, Mr. Linderman, I've been doing most of the talking tonight. Is there anything you would like to tell me?\" Ricky knew she meant his tragedy. He determined that he would eventually tell her the truth, but now wasn't the time. He nonchalantly held her arms and pulled her close. \"I certainly will, but that's part of your payment plan.\" Coral tossed her head back with a slight laugh. \"Oh, I see. You're a blackmailer. If I don't go on a date with you, I don't get to know?\" \"That sounds about right. And you don't get some of the best Italian food in the city. And one date with me is not going to cover fixing your lemon!\" Coral held her hips. \"Now my car's a lemon? You didn't even look at it yet. Is that fair?\" \"Is life fair?\" \"Good point. As Katherine Hepburn once said, Life is hard…after all, it kills you. \" \"That's profound!\" He laughed. \"And the calla lilies are in bloom again ... really they are!\" He imitated the actress' shaky voice. She giggled and Ricky drew his arm over her waist and stooped toward her. \"This might sound a little strong, but are we going to play like coy sixteen-year-olds all night?\" \"I was seventeen then… darn it! And who's being coy?\" \"Both of us.\" Coral grinned and raised herself on her toes. Their lips met in a gentle kiss and then she pulled back slightly. \"Hey , Mr. Linderman, there are no bruises here anymore.\" Ricky smiled as his mouth met hers again. \"I see that…and there never will be again.\" \"Is that a promise?\" She asked between soft, deep kisses. \"Yes…\" He whispered. Her fingers dug against his back and Ricky felt her keen desires to be loved and have complete trust in a man once again. Ricky stared adoringly and hugged her. His chin grazed her hair and he spoke tenderly. \"You said I couldn't get off the train until I promised I wouldn't do anything stupid. Well, I promised, I came off…and I think I'm exactly where I need to be at last.\" ~Oo~ The Ambassador Hotel-One year later Clifford sauntered onto the balcony near the parapet with two cold beers. He tapped Ricky and handed him a bottle. After taking a few sips and setting it down, Ricky turned around and leaned back on his elbows. \"Shelly really outdid herself tonight. Is she still in charge of the kitchen in the hotel?\" \"Oh yeah, she's like the Iron Chef down there. They whip up some mean meals here thanks to her suggestions. Best in Chicago, five stars on the hotel list.\" \"They always did get high ratings. She's adventurous with her cooking.\" Ricky pointed a few feet ahead of him. \"So, where is it?\" \"What?\" \"Come on, man, the telescope?\" Clifford laughed. \"Oh… that. Shelly removed it a long time ago, she didn't want Danny taking any more 'astronomy' lessons.\" \" Ahh, so there are some new heavenly bodies out there, huh?\" Ricky grinned. \"Too many.\" He grinned slyly. \"Whole orbits!\" \" Dog. I wonder where he got the idea to study the stars?\" Clifford held up his hands. \"Don't look at me. I'm not my father…the old goat just called me two days ago, that man is living it up in Florida.\" \"Still chasing stewardesses , huh?\" \"I don't know how he does it. But no, he's settling down, and get this, with a woman his own age.\" Ricky laughed and crossed his arms. \"Good for him! But you're only as young as you feel.\" \"Yeah, I finally figured him out. After mom died, I don't think he ever wanted to love a woman as much as he loved her. He didn't want to remarry forever.\" \"I figured that too, Cliff. Whatever makes him happy I guess. So, it looks like our women are getting along famously. I just have to watch out for my lady, Shelly can talk the ears off corn.\" \"No comment on that one. I agree, Rick. Ehh, Shelly loves all the free advice Coral gives on every subject. You didn't tell me your gal was such an expert!\" He nudged his ribs. Ricky blushed and kept drinking. \"Those are her secrets…they work wonders on me, I'll tell you that!\" \"So, how's the first three months of marriage been treating you?\" \"It's amazing…a whole new world. You come to realize that it's not just about you anymore. There's no more 'I', it's only 'we.' And Coral makes sure I know that. There was no hesitation; we're too old for those games. God, I love her so much.\" Ricky peered through the balcony windows and watched as Coral puttered around Clifford's kitchen setting out plates and spoons and laughing at Shelly's oddball sense of humor. She glanced up happily and caught him staring. She winked and blew him a kiss, then went back to her business. \"I've never seen anyone fall so hard for a woman. Your wedding was classic. Driving off into the sunset on your old motorbike! I can't believe you dragged her through the whole city on that broken down thing!\" Clifford joked. Ricky chuckled. \"Not to mention in a wedding gown and tux! We also had our coats because she insisted on the winter wonderland theme and had tin cans dragging across the back. It was terrific! She loved it! She said she waited thirty years to ride that bike. Rain or shine.\" \"Or snow! Winter's a good time to get married…it's cozy…I thought you wanted Vermont, but you two ran off to Aruba and thawed out.\" \"Oh heck yeah! We had Bloody Marys and pancakes in the morning, took long walks and jogs on the beach, hikes, and luxurious swims, aughh …you shouldn't have reminded me, we have to go back.\" \"Now do you realize what you missed out on all these years?\" Ricky finished off his beer and shook his head. \"No, Cliff, I didn't miss out on anything.\" Clifford looked at him curiously. \"What do you mean?\" \"If I got married much earlier in life, it wouldn't have been Coral , and I can't imagine that. I may not have kids of my own, but her kids and grandkids have become a part of me already. I'm telling you, she was always the one. It just took me too damn long to find out.\" \"Don't get back on the shame spiral, Rick. You're with her now. That's what counts.\" \"Sure. And I cherish every second.\" Clifford smiled gently. Ricky Linderman constantly proved himself to be the 'Gentle giant.' Ricky's marriage also drew them even closer as friends. Coral's son Charlie became instant buddies with his son, Daniel. Life for the Peaches and the Lindermans was going well. They gazed at the starry sky for a few moments and then Clifford had to laugh. Ricky looked at him oddly. \"What's so funny?\" \"It's not funny, really, it's just…well…need I remind you what day it is?\" Ricky looked up and pondered, but then shrugged. \"Sunday?\" \" Wow …you really are a changed man, my friend.\" \"I'm not following.\" Clifford patted his shoulder. \"Tonight's the night. We all knew, but we waited to see if you would remember…\" He trailed off when he saw Ricky's disappointment. Ricky banged the ledge and glared at him. \"Clifford! Why didn't you tell me?\" Clifford folded his arms across his chest sternly and shook his head. \"No, Ricky, if it was something that was still so important, you would have remembered without fail. I know it was very important to you, but guess what? You proved you don't need to keep falling back on that night. You made a terrific life for yourself. You have Coral to share your pains, and I know she's helped you so much. I can see the difference. You're … alive, Ricky. Don't keep looking back. It was a moment in time, it happened, we learned from it, but you have to let it go. Damn, between you and your counseling and your wife now I sound like a therapist.\" Ricky hung his head and grasped the inner-corners of his eyes with his fingers. He felt a huge rush of blood drain from his head when Clifford told him. He took a deep breath and suddenly, the feeling disappeared. In its place was serenity . He raised his eyes to his best friend with a deep smile. \"You're right, Clifford. Coral told me that it's like a Rorschach test. You can focus on the black shapes or the white shapes and each one tells a different story. The black ones will always be visible and you'll always be aware of them, but you make the ultimate choice over which picture you see. The fact that I killed my brother will always be with me. I'm not an evil person, it was an accident, but I'm alive and tried my best to do good to others. I guess that's all I can hope for.\" Clifford hugged Ricky. He picked up the empty bottles and led the way into the apartment, where their wives served dessert. He turned back and smiled. \"I know for sure you'll always do good, Ricky. Because that's the way you are.\" The End.

Jack enjoys going out at night to star gaze. He just watches, hoping to see something out of the ordinary. Little does he know, that he is unordinary. 'I don't want anyone. I want the boy.' Zaneth boomed. He paced around his clouded sanctuary proudly and without hesitation. 'I understand, your majesty, but it's... difficult.' Aquis said. He had been the royal messenger his whole life and was the main angel Zaneth would talk to. 'I don't care if it's difficult, Aquis. He's the one we need. It's been written for 800 Million years. We cannot do nothing!' Zaneth stopped pacing and turned his back on Aquis. 'If we do nothing.. all hell will break loose.' Aquis looked down at his feet. He fully understood what would happen. 'Bring me Kasibeth.' Zaneth said. Aquis raised his head. His eyes were open wide in shock. 'Your majesty. Your own daughter?' Aquis questioned, horrified. 'Aquis go now!' Zaneth had lost his patience. Aquis winced at the scene. Lightning was engulfing the area. The room, made entirely out of clouds, was grey and had had all the life ripped from it. Unfurling his wings, Aquis jumped up and flew like a rocket ship. He slalomed and missed a lightning bolt by inches. The clouds swirled more and more as Zaneth became ever more impatient. Aquis flew straight into the smallest of all the clouds and vanished from sight. 'Hey! Jack!' Tom shouted from across campus. It was getting late, and Jack was heading out to see the stars. 'Tom.. hi.' The disappointment was obvious, but Tom didn't seem to notice. 'Hey mate, where have you been all day?' He punched him lightly on the arm. Tom had known Jack the whole 2 years he had been at Uni. They weren't really friends.. more acquaintances. 'Erm, my classes and then studying.' Jack moved his hands through I hair. This was what he told Tom all the time, but he had obviously not been listening each time. 'Oh right, yeah, interesting. So hey! There's a party a Joe's tonight and he told me to invite you.' 'I'm good. I sort of already have something planned.' Jack raised his shoulders revealing his bag. A telescope was sticking out of one of the pockets. 'Star gazing again? Jack, you have to get out there! I mean come on. You're the package! The nerdy, shy guy that's really fit.' Tom raised his eyebrows and laughed. 'And I'm walking away now.' Jack turned his back to Tom and began walking. 'Dude.' Tom said, he didn't move. 'You're wasting your life!' 'Yeah, tell me that in 2 years when I become the man to cure cancer. Bye!' he stuck his hand up and gave Tom the finger. Jack headed for his usual field. The grass was tall, dry and incredibly annoying, but the view of the stars was an astronomers heaven. Doing the usual routine, Jack unzipped his bag and began setting up the telescope. Then he grabbed a small camp chair from another pocket and sat down. He put his eye up to the lens and looked. The star shone bright, like a million fireflies. He sat and waited patiently. 'You wanted to see me, father?' Kasibeth walked through the smallest cloud and emerged in the white, calm room. Her blonde hair was wavy and shiny, any hair a girl would dream of having. She was thin and tall and wore all white. White jeans and a white top covered her small body. The wings on her back glittered and flapped beautifully. She was really an angel. 'Yes.' Zaneth was pacing again. Tension had engulfed him, his breathing was short and sharp. 'I need to discuss something with you, Kasibeth. Please,' he gestured to a sofa that had just been created by clouds. 'Sit down.' Kasibeth took her seat, but Zaneth continued standing. 'Is everything alright, father?' Kasibeth said anxiously. 'Kasibeth I'm sure that you are familiar with the prophecy?' Zaneth spoke quickly. 'Yes, of course, father.' 'Explain it to me.' he was forceful. 'The prophecy speaks about a young human who is destined to be an angel. If this human is not found within the time then the earth will fight. It will fall, everything will die.' Kasibeth stopped. 'Continue.' Zaneth had tears in his eyes. Kasibeth looked hurt, broken. How could her father want her to talk about the forbidden prophecy? 'It's all good if you find the chosen human, but...' 'Continue, Kasibeth!' 'But a sacrifice must be made by an angel. They must fall to the human world and collect this human. They would be defenceless, powerless, without anything. The Gods would find out about the fall and send forces to come after you. They would then turn you human if you get caught... you would never be allowed to return to the clouds, unless you were chosen.' Tears were running down her cheeks, her posture had decreased. She looked limp, lifeless. Her face was drained of colour. 'Very good, daughter.' Zaneth sniffed. Memories of his wife were effecting him every second Kasibeth was sitting in the room. Not to mention that time was running out.. If they didn't act, the Gods would start hell. 'Kasibeth... You must do me a favour, us a favour. The angel community.' Kasibeth looked up, she knew what was coming and she was scared. Horrified that her father was sending her to do the very thing her mother had failed at. 'You must fall.' Lightning surrounded Kasibeth, her wings disappeared. 'Father you cannot!' she cried as the clouds split beneath her feet. She was falling.. and she couldn't do anything about it. Jack removed his eye from the lens. 'What?' he muttered. He placed his eye back into its space and concentrated. Something, that looked very much like a shooting star, was getting closer and closer. As it approached, Jack realised it wasn't a shooting star, but a person. His heart rate increased. Falling over, he reacted. He ran around the field with his arms out wide, hoping to catch whatever was falling. 'Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god.' his thoughts were engulfed in fire. All he could think about was this. Without warning, the person hit him. They both rolled on the dry ground, Jack's arms around the person the entire time. They stopped, both groaning in pain. Dirt was all over them both, they had scratches and bruises on their arms. 'Ouch.. Are you okay?' Jack said weakly, standing up but gasping as pain shot through his knee. Kasibeth stirred but didn't answer. Jack bent down and helped her to her feet. 'Are you okay?' he persisted. 'Yes.. I'm just peachy.' she clicked as she stood, blood on her cheek. 'Oh, you've got some blood...' Jack raised a finger and wiped her face. 'Thank you.' she replied, looking into his eyes. Jack looked away, his face gaining colour. 'How.. Did you.. What... but... you fell and.. I don't -' 'Erm yes! It was a, er.. Skydiving gone wrong.' she grinned once, but stopped from the pain it caused. 'Oh.' Jacks thoughts were racing. Why would you go Skydiving at this time? Heck! Why would you go skydiving without a parachute? Jack brushed dirt off his trousers and looked up to see Kasibeth starring right at him. 'You're him.' she sounded excited, her eyes were gleaming. 'Yes, I'm Jack.' he faintly laughed and started walking backwards as Kasibeth approached. 'No, you're him! You're him!' she was ecstatic, amazed in fact. 'We can go back right now! I don't have to suffer like my mother. My father will finally be proud of me!' she grabbed his arm, but Jack pulled away. 'Wow, okay. You are concussed, we need to get you to a doctor.' 'No.' her personality had changed, seriousness had set in. 'You're him.' 'Who the hell is him?' said Jack, annoyed. 'You. You're the chosen one.'[Chapter 2] 'It seems that Zaneth has let an angel fall.' Zeus said slowly, he had a smile upon his face. 'You know what we must do, Satrain.' Satrain stood taller than Zeus, but he was not way as powerful. Satrain, the son of Satan, was only associated with the Gods for one reason and one reason only: He had to carry out the deed to turn an angel human, but first, he had to catch them. 'It's that time already?' He smirked and laughed evilly. Suddenly, he sprouted bat wings. Satrain was losing his height, his size was decreasing. In less than a minute, he had transformed into a fully formed bat. Flapping his wings, he raised from the ground and flew out of site. 'Are you okay, Jack?' Kasibeth said, looking down and Jack curled up into a ball. He shook his head. His eyes were wide open and he was tense. As he rocked back and forth, he looked ever more insane or mental. His hair was ruffled and his crystal blue eyes had lost there colour. 'Jack, come on. It's going to be fine.' Kasibeth didn't know what to do. She placed a comforting hand on Jack's shoulder and he stopped rocking. He looked up. 'Please tell me this isn't real.' Jack had turned into a 5 year old he was so scared. His eyes were glassy, infact, he was almost crying. 'I could tell you that, but I would be lying.' Kasibeth sat next to him. 'An angel doesn't lie.' 'I've lied before! So I cant be an angel!' Jack exclaimed. 'Jack, I've told you! You're not an angel yet! You're just destined to be one.' Kasibeth said, annoyance in her voice. Jack couldn't take it anymore. He wasn't the chosen one. He wasn't destined to be an angel. But Kasibeth said he was. Jack's mind was confused. He didn't know what was right and what was wrong, he didn't understand. He couldn't remember if he had done is History homework. Had he finished his English essay? 'I can't do this.' Jack got up quickly and headed for his bag. As he began packing up, Kasibeth got up to. 'You can't just leave! You can't!' 'I can leave if I want to. I didn't sign up for this shit!' Kasibeth winced at the sound of Jack cursing. 'But Jack-' 'No, Kasibeth! I don't want to do this. Just go back up to heaven or whatever and leave me alone!' 'I can't!' Jack stopped packing and turned to look at the fallen angel. 'My father let me fall... I can't go back unless I get the chosen one. Not to mention that I'm running out of time. The Gods-' 'Sorry, what?' Jack's mouth was wide open. 'There are Gods involved too!' 'For angels sake, let me explain!' Jack stood there, waiting patiently. 'The Gods are in charge of anything in the human world. That means that if I stay much longer, the Gods with capture me and turn me human. I'll have disgraced my father and the whole of the angel community. All hell will break loose. We don't want a repeat of 400 Million years ago... that was when' she stopped and coughed, tears were forming in her eyes. 'Was when my mother fell. She didn't complete the mission and was turned into a human. Then the Gods attacked and she perished with all the others. The earth was reborn though... it always comes back. That's why I need you to come with me... Please.' Jack thought for a moment. Was Kasibeth really telling the truth? I mean, he had just met this gir- angel and now this was happening. He opened his mouth as if to speak, but a sound, that wasn't him, erupted from somewhere. Satrainn, n bat form, was flying towards them. His teeth were bared, his wings were strong, his talons ready to strike. 'We have to go! NOW!' Kasibeth grabbed Jack and started running as fast as her feet could carry her. 'What is that thing?' Jack asked, running out of breath. 'That's Satrainn! He's the son of Satan. He catches us fallen angels and turns us human!' The two of them turned onto a street. It was deserted, no cars were in site. 'What do we do then?' sweat dripped down Jack's face, his glasses were askew. 'Now, we hide.' Kasibeth pulled Jack into a bush and they both went silent. The only thing they could hear was the beating of their own hearts and the throbbing in their heads. Satrain landed and turned back into his devilish form. 'I know you're here, Kasibeth.' a smile stretched across his horrid face, his voice was low and croaky. 'And I know you have the chosen one... Just come out. I won't hurt you... You're too special for that.' Jack looked into Kasibeth's face. Her face had lost colour and her eyes were engulfed in fear. Satrain was getting closer to the bush. Kasibeth and Jack held their breath and went rigid. Just when they throught Satrain would find them, a clap of thunder boomed from the sky. It was followed by massive lightning bolts. The sky was so bright that the light penetrated through the leaves of the bush they were sat in. 'Zaneth!' Satrain shouted, lightning was coiling around his arms, holding him back. Knowing that Zaneth would get him, Satrain transformed into his bat form and flew into the distance. Jack and Kasibeth exited their hiding space and found themselves in the empty street once more. 'Thank you, father.' Kasibeth said. Jack put a reassuring hand on her shoulder. They both looked up into the sky... The stars shone brighter than before.

After his fall, henhasn't been moved from his bed since he arrived here in Los Angeles.nThe doctors said he would live, he just needed the motivation. Whatnmotivation? What was there left to care about? He wasn't good enoughnfor his girlfriend to come and visit him, to even care about himnanymore. He was nothing, pure and simple, what was there to motivatenhimself for? He sat there, the curtain half drawn around him as henlooked off into space, his eyes blinking slowly. He felt like he wasnwasting his time here, living for no reason at all. He leaned hisnhead against the pillows the nurses had so graciously fluffed fornhim. They were faceless to him, all of them looking the same. Theirnintentions were pure, but they wouldn't remember his name the nextnday. He was just another man, waiting for his number to be up. Hisnattention was then drawn to the entrance as a nurse wheeled a youngnwoman into the room. He stared at the girl, long red hair cascadingnover her shoulders. Her eyes were a penetrating green, yet theynlooked dull and dead somewhat. Her skin was alabaster, paler thannmost women in California. The nurse whispered to the girl gently asnshe wheeled her to a neighboring bed. Roy forced himself to look awaynas the girl slowly let her gaze fall on him. She was sick, he couldntell by the looks of her. He couldn't tell what she was down with,nbut it had to be something worth hospitalizing her for. The nursenlooked to Roy when he looked back toward them, and she just met himnwith a simple smile. \"Come on, darling.\"nShe spoke to the redheaded woman gingerly as she reached for her. Thengirl's slender, delicate pale hand moved to the nurse's face, causingnthe healthy woman to gasp gently. She had been caught off guard bynthe girl's sudden and harsh movement. Roy stared in intrigue as shenslowly rose from the wheelchair, when he realized how thin she was.nShe turned, strongly toward the nurse and her pale pink lips partednslowly. \"I am quite capablenof moving myself, thank you, ma'am...I don't need your assistance,nnor your sympathy.\" She said plainly before setting herself downninto her bed without another word. Embarrassed, the nurse left thenroom with the wheelchair, not uttering another word. Roy looked fromnthe girl, the sun creeping in through the blinds on the largenwindows. Yet he couldn't help but look toward her from the corner ofnhis eye. He watched as the sun played with the tones in her hair,ncausing them to radiate with a vibrant redness that he couldn't thinknpossible for a hair color. He turned his head to look at her,nwatching as she looked down at her hands, her fingers moving againstneach other as if she were searching for a sensation between them. Shenwas perceptive, however, and without much delay, she looked up fromnher hands to meet Roy's gaze. She looked from side to side beforenlooking back to him, a look of confusion on her porcelain face. Hengot a good look at her, her skin smooth and almost translucent. Shenwas fair, in the eptiome of the word. She was beautiful, radiant, yetnshe held a sickliness about her. Why was she here? He wondered thisnuntil her voice broke the silence. \"Is there a reasonnyou're staring at me?\" She asked, a raised and irritated brow atnhim. Roy stammered slightly as he looked at her now, more aware ofnthe present time. He had been lost in his thoughts, lost in hisnimagination as he looked at her. He laughed a bit and looked awaynfrom her, she was a fiesty one and he almost dared not to look at hernagain. But when he looked back to her, her facial expression hadnchanged, from a look of irritation to a small smile. \"I'm Roy.\" Hensaid, offering up a slight peace offering to his staring. She slowlynlooked back to him, her hair moving a bit, causing more red prisms tonignite around the crown of her head. She then let her teeth show asnshe smiled at him. At least she was warming up to him a bit. If theynwere going to bed roommates, they would at least have to try and bencivilized. He watched her as she looked him over for a moment beforenshe let her lips part for her to speak. \"My name's Daniella.\"nShe said with a soft, velvety voice as she leaned into her pillows.nHe watched her carefully as she slowly slid further down the bed, herneyelids drooping. Suddenly, Roy felt a sudden twinge of pain in thenpit of his stomach as he watched her carefully with his dark eyes. Henwatched her chest rise and fall rapidly as her eyes fell shut. Hendidn't know what to think at the moment, instead that she didn't looknwell at all. Obviously not, since she was in the hospital. Then, shenslipped into a gentle sleep and Roy decided to leave the preciousngirl be. He went back to his self loathing routine again, nevernlooking back to the girl as he stared off into space before he justnlet himself fall into a restless sleep.[Chapter 2] She SingsnWith Butterflies (A ThenFall Fan Fiction) Disclaimer:n`The characters Roy Walker and others from the film belong to DannGilroy and Tarsem. `Daniella, however, belongs to me. Pairing: Roy/Daniella Rating: T for Angst,nFrightening Scenes, and Romance Other Characters: TBA POV:nRoy Days past since Daniellanfirst arrived here at the hospital, yet he still didn't know what wasnwrong with the fiesty redhead. She didn't talk much to him, hell shendidn't speak to anyone really. She sat there in her bed, much like hendid, and stared at times but mostly slept. Was the somber stuntmannsmitten with the silent redhead? You could say it was possible, butnthat didn't mean he wasn't still upset over his girlfriend, the onenwho left him for another man. He knew that being overly upset about ansituation like this was juvenile and fruitless, but he had cripplednhimself for the woman, to get her attention away from the other man.nIt had been all for nothing, so here he sat in this hospital room,nbeside a silent yet beautiful woman. Roy sighed as he turned his headnand looked at Daniella's bed to see her stirring gently from one ofnher cat naps. To say he wasn't worried about her state of being wouldnbe a lie, but he wasn't sure what to think at this point. He barelynknew the woman, yet he felt like he needed to make sure she was okay.nRoy watched in anticipation as the girl's green eyes rolled open, andnshe slowly pushed herself up in a more propped up state. She then letnher dull gaze slowly shift to him and his breath caught in hisnthroat. Daniella's smile was infectious as Roy felt a smile tug onnhis lips as well, but he looked away from her as he ran his handsntogether. \"Have you beennwatching me again, Roy?\" Daniella spoke finally and her wordsncaused Roy to look at her quickly with shock in his eyes. Was henreally that transparent? Roy then let a laugh escape his lips, whichnwas met with a gentle chuckle from Daniella. So maybe he had been,nthere was no harm in it, he just wanted to make sure she was stillnbreathing mostly. He watched her as she looked away for a momentnbefore she slowly rose, the movement different from what she normallyndid. He watched her carefully as her slender form slid out of hernbed, her bare feet touching the cold floor slowly. What was shendoing? He thought before he watched her move toward him. He stared upnat her, watching the way her red hair moved from side to side as shenwalked before her body descended onto the side of his bed. She was sonclose now, closer than he thought she would ever be to him. He lookednup at her as she sat beside him on his bed, her green eyes brighternnow that he could see them up close. She was more beautiful than shenhad been the day she arrived. What was he doing? Thinking about thisngirl in that way, it was wrong wasn't it? No, he was betrayed, he hadnto remember that. The woman he had loved was lying to him, he justnhad to remember that. \"Maybe.\" Roynfinally said in response to her question, but it was responded to byna small laugh from the redhead again. She reached up and tugged onnthe curtain around his bed and pulled it around them. Now they werensomewhat secluded, as if in a cacoon with each other. Roy cleared hisnthroat and sat up slowly, his eyes blinking rapidly as he tried tonfocus on what was going on in front of him. Daniella had let hernslender legs hang over the side of his bed as she looked at him, notnreally sure what she wanted from him. He didn't mind the closenproximity of her as they sat there together for a lingering moment.nHer smile was beautiful as she gave him one, her hands resting in hernlap as she looked at him carefully. \"So I'm curious, asnto why you are stuck in a place like this.\" Roy asked, lookingnup at her with curiosity in his dark eyes. Daniella met his gaze forna slight moment before she looked away, a sad smile on her face. Thenlook troubled Roy as she looked away from him. Was she going to say?nWhat could be so bad when it caused someone to hesitate in tellingnthe truth? He then looked back up at her as she looked to him slowlynwith a soft expression on her pale face. Was she going to tell himnnow? He questioned in his mind as she shrugged her shoulders andnsighed for a slight moment. \"I'm sick, like manynof the people here. Just..trying to get better like the rest ofnthem.\" She answered, a vague answer at that. He wouldn't pressnit, not today since he knew that she wasn't going to tell him thenwhole truth anyway. She had her reasons for being vague, maybensometime she'll be able to tell her what is really going on. He hopednthat it was simple, hoped that her sickness that she spoke of wasnonly temporary. The thought of her being permanently sick wasn'tnsomething he wanted to think about. He didn't like the idea one bit,nbut he knew that something was up. Daniella moved slowly and let hernleft arm moved across his lap as she looked at him. Roy stiffenednslightly at her closeness, but didn't object to it. She looked intonhis dark eyes with her brilliant green ones, he felt different withnher this close to him. Why was he holding all of this back? He knew,nbut he didn't want to be doing this, he wanted to let the girlfriendnwho hurt him just float away into nothingness. But for some reason,nhe couldn't help but hold onto her still. \"Now, Why are younhere?\" She asked with a soft, yet gorgeous smile. She asked andnRoy looked away, trying to smile but he couldn't quite push it out.nHe didn't know what to say other than the truth, he sighed and rubbednthe bridge of his nose between his fingers before he looked up atnher, shrugging slightly as he looked down at his legs. \"I fell...doingnstunts for a movie.\" He said and Daniella looked from his facento his legs. She reached over and touched his knee, causing him tonstare at her, almost in utter shock at her intimate touch. He lookednup to him, hair hanging in her face in a majestic way. \"You can't feelnthat?\" She asked and Roy just gave her a gentle shake of hisnhead. She then proceeded to give him a pout. It was endearing as hensmiled slightly at her. She then moved her hand up his leg and restednit on his thigh and looked back to him. Roy smiled up at her, thenattempt to make him smile working. She was a wonderful person, whichnhe envied about her. She was sick and yet she managed to make thingsna bit brighter for him. He looked away, smiling slightly as she satnthere. Then, he heard the sound of the curtain being drawn and thendoctor stood there, looking to Roy and Daniella with a raised brow. \"It's time for yournexamination, Miss Fontaine.\" The doctor said, the light leavingnDaniella's eyes. Roy noticed that more than anything as the doctornpulled Daniella away from him. Her hand slid free from his leg and hensat up a bit. He watched as a nurse with needles moved down thenhallway and his eyes widened. Were those for her? He thought beforenshe turned and looked back at him with a comforting smile on hernface. \"See you later,nStuntman Roy.\" She said with a grin before the doctor pulled hernout of the room and out of his sight. Roy blinked at the name beforena small smile formed on his lips. The girl was stirring somethingnwithin him, something he couldn't explain, but he was glad that itnwas happening. Or else he'd still be sitting alone in this room,nstaring off into space and self-loathing to no end. He ran his handndown the back of his neck and looked back toward the door, almostnhoping that she'd walk back in front the doorway. But she was stillngone, but the hope of her return was still there when he grabbed thencurtain and pulled it back around him.

Don Bilingsley looked left and right as his quarterback, Mike Winchell, called out the next play. As soon as he heard \"hike\", Don ran to the open space and looked for the pass. He saw the ball and caught it. But at the last moment, it slipped out of his hands. \"Dammit, Don!\" Charles Bilingsley yelled at his son as he stormed onto the field. \"Can't you hold onto the goddamn ball for once?\" He threw his hands up in the air and walked away. As his own dad was yelling at him, Coach Gaines was yelling at Mike. \"Practice over, boys. Hit the showers.\" Coach said in frustration as the press surrounded the players. \"Winchell! Over here, Winchell!\" One reporter begged for Mike, \"What's it like being the star quarterback?\" Mike paused for a moment, \"It's... Well it's something.\" \"Hey, Don Bilingsley!\" a reporter went up to the sweaty football player. \"Your dad played at Permian. What's it like to be the son of a local legend?\" \"Next question.\" Don felt all eyes on him. When he noticed the reporters staring at him, he rolled his and walked over to another player to hear his interview, Boobie Miles. \"Should we believe the hype?\" A reporter asked with a microphone ready for his answer. \"What hype?\" Boobie raised a brow, confused. \"The hype about Boobie Miles!\" The reporter nodded like it should have been obvious. \"Now... Hype is something that's not for real. I'm all real.\" After getting cleaned up, Don waited outside the girl's locker room. He watched as a group of girls walked out. Sighing, he continued to wait and switched his bag from one shoulder to the other. Don grinned to himself when he saw the curly brown hair walk out of the locker room. \"Hey, Bethany!\" Don called after the girl. The girl turned around and smile at the sound of her boyfriend's voice. Bethany Jameson stood five foot six, crystal blue eyes, with brown ringlet curls that cascaded down her back. \"I didn't realize your practice was over.\" Bethany smiled and walked over to him. Don Bilingsley had been dating Bethany Jameson since their freshman year in high school. He met her when ran... more like crashed into her after a tackle gone wrong. He broke her ankle and the rest was history. \"Yeah,\" Don returned the smile, \"Coach Gaines let us go so we could talk to the reporters.\" As he sad the last few words, Bethany noticed his sudden mood drop. \"How'd that go?\" She asked with sudden curiosity as Don took her hand. \"They asked me how it was to follow in my dads footsteps.\" Don sighed and laced their fingers, leading them out of the gym. \"I'm sorry, Don.\" Bethany leaned up and kissed his cheek. \"At least he won't be home until late tonight.\" She shrugged as she walked to his car with him. \"So, what are our plans for this evening?\" Don unlocked the car and threw their bags in the car. Sliding into the driver's seat. \"Well, Mike wanted to go to the Diner. Thinks he wants to get away from his mom.\" Don looked to Bethany and started the car. \"That alright with you?\" \"I'm fine with it.\" Bethany smiled,\" so, your place or mine?\" The outdoor dines was filled with teens and families on that Friday night. Chappy's was like a third home to all of them. \"Mike, no need to eat like you're dying.\" Don laughed and watched his buddy shovel his food in to his mouth. \"I was hungry...\" Mike rolled his eyes. \"We need to come here more.\" He said while eating another fry. \"We come here once a week!\" Bethany grinned and took a sip of her soda. \"Why so glum, anyway?\" \"Yeah man! Just because you and Jennifer are fighting doesn't mean I can't get you drunk and laid tonight!\" Don chuckled and took a bite of his burger. \"Bilingsley! Don Bilingsley! Party at Mara's tonight! Bilingsley, party at Mara's!\" Brian Chavez ran past the group yelling. Mike rolled his eyes at his teammate and shook his head. \"I don't need to get laid, or drunk.\" His expression became serious. \"Besides... Are we even going to Mara's tonight?\" He looked to his friend for an answer. \"Yeah, man. Of course. But I don't think Bethany and I are staying late. Wanna get home before my dad does.\" Don's already deep voice dropped as he looked to his girlfriend who nodded. \"Speaking of parties, we should probably get going. Mara's expecting us!\" Bethany stood with excitement and pulled Don up. \"C'mon, Mike! Let's go!\" After the short drive to Mara's house, the party was in full swing. It seemed like the entire senior class had shown up. When they entered the house, Mike wen upstairs to find Jennifer, and Don and Bethany headed to get drinks. \"When's your dad gonna be home tonight?\" Bethany asked as she sipped her drink. \"Not until late, late tonight.\" Don grinned, pulling her close to him. \"Which means we can do whatever we want.\" He smiled and pressed his lips to hers. Don set his drink down on the counter and let go of her. \"I gotta go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.\" He kissed her cheek and vanished in the direction of the bathroom. Bethany took a sip of her drink when only a few minutes later, she felt a hand on her waist. \"That was quick.\" She laughed and turned to face him. But when she turned, the face she was met with was not Don Bilingsley, but none other than Boobie Miles. \"What the hell is your problem?\" She yelled in disgust, trying to push him off her. \"My problem is you're looking fine tonight.\" A very intoxicated Boobie replied, putting one hand back on her. \"Get the hell off me, Boobie!\" She tried to push him off again but with no luck this time. \"Looks like we got a feisty girl!\" Boobie smirked. \"Hey, Boobie.\" Someone tapped him on the shoulder. Before he could react, he was on the floor and his jaw hurt. \"Why don't you keep your hands off my girl?\" Don wrapped an arm around Bethany's waist. \"Ay, Don.\" Boobie stood back up with confidence. \"Why don't you keep your hands off my face!\" Boobie threw a punch and soon both boys were on the ground fighting. It only took a moment before Brian Chavez and Bethany were restraining Don. \"C'mon, Don.\" Bethany, with the help of Chavez, was pulling Don out of the house. \"You got him, Beth?\" Chavez let go of Don as they stopped in front of the car. \"Yeah. Thanks, Chavez.\" She smiled and kissed his cheek. \"I'll see you Monday.\" Chavez nodded and headed back inside the house. \"Let's get in, Don.\" Bethany opened the passenger side, and as soon as he was securely in, she went to the driver's side and got in. \"You didn't have to do that,\" she whispered, cupping his face. \"I know.\" Don semi-smiled. \"I just didn't appreciate was he doing. Did he get me bad?\" Bethany laughed and shook her head. \"Nothing bad, just a black eye.\" She removed her hand and started the car. \"It makes you look tough.\" Smiling, she started in the direction of Don's house. Once there, they got out of the car and walked to the front door. \"You sure your dad won't be home until later?\" \"Absolutely positive.\" Don smiled and picked Bethany up. \"Now let's go inside.\" He pushed open the now unlocked door and carried her inside, with her shutting the door with her leg. As he carried her into the living room, he knocked over a lamp. \"Don!\" Bethany giggled as he continued to carry her down the hall and into his bedroom. \"I'll pick it up later.\" He grinned and set her down on his bed. Don watched as she took of her shirt and changed into one of his extra shirts laying on his bed. \"Has anyone told you you're beautiful?\" He took of his own shirt and slipped on some sweatpants, laying down next to her. \"Maybe you have before.\" She smiled and cuddled up next to Don. \"Well you are.\" Don wrapped and am around Bethany and pulled her close. \"The most beautiful person I've ever met.\" He kissed her forehead and watched her shut her eyes. \"I love you, Bethany\" \"I love you too, Don. Always.\" Bethany whispered softly. As they were falling into a peaceful sleep, Don's bedroom door flung open. Don slowly opened his eyes as he felt Bethany squeeze his arm tightly. \"Dad, what the hell are you doing?\" \"Hello, Bethany.\" Charles Bilingsley nodded curtly towards Bethany. \"I have one question, what the hell is my lamp doing on the floor?\" Don sat up and threw his legs over the side of the bed. \"I meant to pick it up, I just forgot.\" He shrugged. Charles face was bright red and grabbed the roll of duct tape off the desk and the nearest foot ball. \"Can't hold onto the damn foot ball, can't hold onto a damn lamp!\" He shoved the football into his sons hands and started wrapping the duct tape around them, securing them to the ball. \"Dad! Dad! What the hell is your problem?\" Don widened his eyes in shock at what his father was doing. \"Dad just stop and get the hell out of here!\" \"Mr. Bilingsley! Stop it!\" Bethany had an expression of fear on her face and tried to take the the tape away from Don's father. \"Get the hell out of here, dad!\" Don yanked his hands away from his father. \"Maybe you'll learn how to hold onto a fucking football next time.\" Charles shook his head and stormed out the bedroom, slamming the door behind him. Don grit his teeth in anger and looked down at his now duct taped hands. \"I'm sorry you had to see that, Bethany.\" Bethany sighed and started to slowly unravel the tape, trying to make the pain less and less. \"It's okay, he doesn't scare me.\" She shrugged and threw away the tape. \"He's not scary... Maybe only when he's drunk.\" Don laughed with out humor and tossed the football to the side of the room. \"Let's just... Let's just go back to sleep.\" He pulled Bethany back down and wrapped an arm around her protectively. \"Thanks for helping me tonight, with the tape and all.\" Don whispered and stared up at the ceiling. \"I don't mind helping you. Especially we end up like we are now.\" Bethany murmured, half asleep. \"I love you, always.\" Don kissed her temple and slowly drifted off towards sleep.[Chapter 2] \"Pressure makes us. Pressure breaks us. Pressure defines us.\" Coach Gaines stood in front of the whiteboard in the boys locker room. Today was the first game of the seniors last year. They wanted that win, they needed it. They needed that undefeated season. \"Now boys...\" Coach began, scanning the room, \"You remember how I told you that you need to play with your heart? Well you're gonna need to play like that tonight if you want that win.\" Boobie Miles shook his head and laughed. \"Nah, Coach. You just gotta get Boobie the ball!\" Don looked from Boobie to their quarterback, Mike. \"Man, he never shuts his mouth.\" He rolled his eyes and stood up with the team. \"Now, we've all had our differences...\" Coach Gaines raised a brow and looked from Don to Boobie, \"but I'm gonna need y'all to set that aside and play as a team. You are all brothers.\" He yelled sternly. \"Now, let's go win us a football game!\" The boys cheered in excitement and placed their helmets on their heads before running out of the locker room. Bethany Jameson jumped and down as the football team ran out and onto the field. Her boyfriend, Don Bilingsley, stopped in front of her and lifted his helmet above his face. \"You look awfully cute in that uniform.\" Don grinned and kissed her lightly on the lips. \"Better get out there, twenty six.\" She smiled and smacked his shoulder pad with her pompom. \"Go win that game, baby.\" Bethany laughed at the term she used for him and watched as he ran out onto the field. Within fifteen minutes, the ball was kicked and the game had started. The Permian Panthers, or MOJO as they were known, recieved the kick and Brian Chavez made it to the thirty-six yard line before being brought down by their opponent. \"Nice work, Chavez!\" Coach nodded appreciatively. \"Bilingsley, Winchell, Boobie!\" He ordered them over, \"Now Winchell, I want you to fake pass to Bilingsley and hand it off to Boobie, understood?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Mike Winchell looked to Don and shrugged. \"Now watch Boobie do some magic.\" Boobie smiled cockily and strutted on the field, getting into position. \"Let's just get this over with,\" Don mumbled under his breath and looked to the sideline to see Bethany standing and performing one of her cheers. \"83, 98, 37, hike!\" Mike called out and fake passed to Don, handing the ball to Boobie. As soon as Boobie had a hand on the ball he dodged and ran multiple opposing players, making it all the way to the endzone. \"And that's a MOJO touchdown!\" The announcer called out over the speakers. The offensive players ran off the field and were met with a beaming Coach Gaines.. \"Nice play, boys! Nice play!\" He clapped his hand against the clipboard. It was late into the fourth quarter when Gaines called up his third string receiver, \"Comer! You ready to run the ball, son?\" \"Yes, I am, sir!\" Comer grinned like a giddy child and was about to run onto the field until Gaines stopped him. \"Where you going Comer?\" Gaines widened his eyes. \"Aren't you forgetting your helmet?\" Comer put his hands on his head as if just realizing he had misplaced it. \"Goodness gracious!\" Coach laughed and crossed his arms. \"Boobie, you're going back in!\" \"That's what I'm talking about!\" Boobie pulled his helmet down over his face and ran out to meet his team in the huddle. \"Now, listen to me. Just get me the ball.\" He smacked Winchell's back and went to the line of scrimmage. Winchell called out a set of numbers and yelled hike. He looked for Boobie just like he was supposed to and threw the ball to his open teammate. Boobie caught the ball and began to run down the field. As he got deep into the opposing teams territory, a player tried to tackle him but missed and went slightly to the right. However, another player successfully tackled him and he fell across the player on the ground. Mike turned his head when he heard Boobie yell agony. Multiple team trainers ran onto the field as Boobie rolled around, grabbing his right knee. \"Coach!\" One trainer yelled and motioned for Gaines to come onto the field, \"It's his knee.\" Gaines sighed and looked up at the scoreboard. There was less than twenty seconds left and their star player was injured in their first game. \"Get him off into the field and into the locker room.\" The trainers nodded and helped Boobie limp off towards the locker room. Coach walked over to Winchell and glanced up at the scoreboard one last time. \"Were up by twenty-one and there's thirteen seconds left. Take a knee and call it.\" Winchell nodded and ran over to the team huddle, telling them the plan. \"Hike!\" He yelled and the ball was snapped. When he felt the ball in his hand, he quickly took the knee and game was over. Mike ran over to Don and patted him on the back. \"Nice win, buddy!\" Don nodded and looked to the stands to see a his disappointed father. \"Yeah, you too man.\" He smiled and ran over to Bethany who was grinning ear to ear. \"Good game tonight.\" She smiled and helped him pull of his helmet. \"Has anyone told you you're sexy after a game?\" Wrapping her arms around his neck, she kissed him gently. \"I think only you have, which I don't mind.\" Don laughed and wrapped an arm around her waist. \"I'll meet you by my car. I think my dad's riding with us home.\" He sighed and let go of her. \"See you in a bit.\" He grabbed his water bottles and headed off to his locker room as she head to the girls. Don walked out to his car with his football bag slung over his shoulder. He smiled when he saw Bethany leaning against the car holding her small gym bag. But that smile faded when he saw his dad putting out a cigarette. \"Nice game.\" Charlie Bilingsley muttered under his breath as he got in the back seat. Don shook his head in anger as Bethany lightly placed her hand on his shoulder as if to say to let it go. He put both their bags in the trunk and they simultaneously got in the car. He started the car and left the parking lot, starting down the long country road home. \"Couldn't get one damn touchdown, could you?\" Charlie shook his head in what appeared to be disgust. \"One fucking score.\" \"It was all about Boobie tonight, dad.\" Don let his right hand grab Bethany's and gently squeezed it. His dad always seemed to be in a terrible mood after the games if Don didn't play up to his expectations. \"I'll try one to score next time.\" He said as he pulled into the driveway of their home. \"You say that every god damn time!\" His father burst out of the car, slamming the door which made Bethany jump slightly. \"Every. Damn. Time.\" He spat, enunciating each word and storming into the house. Both Don and Bethany got out of the car and went to the trunk to grab their bags. \"You don't have to stay here tonight.\" He threw the bag onto his shoulder and looked up at the house. \"I want to.\" Bethany smiled sincerely. \"I don't like leaving you here with home after these days.\" She bit her lower lip and laced their fingers. \"Alright,\" Don offered a small smile. \"Let's get inside.\" He led Bethany up the porch stairs and into the house, shutting the door behind them.[Chapter 3] We're in the business of winning. Don awoke with a smile on his face when he saw Bethany was still asleep in his arms. Other than the incident with his father in the car, the night had gone smoothly, especially since they had won their opening game. He brushed a strand of hair off her face and slowly removed his arm from under her. Getting off the bed. he quietly opened the door and shut it behind him and walked to the kitchen. When he entered the kitchen he saw his dad sitting at the table, drinking a beer. \"Isn't it a bit early to be getting drunk?\" Don rolled his eyes and got a glass of water. He sat down across from his father and looked him straight in the eye. \"You need to stop this.\" He said monotonously. \"Stop what?\" Charlie asked sarcastically. He knew what his son meant, he just chose to ignore it. \"You know what dad. Drinking and being a dick.\" Don got up from the table and put his glass in the sink. \"How about I make you deal? When you score and hold onto the ball, that's when I'll stop.\" His dad smirked and finished off this beer. \"You need to know when to shut your damn mouth, dad!\" Don yelled leaving the room. He walked back down the hall and reentered his room. To his surprise, he found Bethany awake. She was sitting up and wearing another of Don's shirts. Don thought she was the most beautiful thing when she woke up. \"I heard yelling.\" She pressed her lips together tightly. \"I got worried something happened.\" She looked up at him with her big blue eyes. \"Nothing happened.\" Don smiled and sat down next to her. He wrapped an arm around her shoulder as she placed her head on his shoulder. \"Just a little argument.\" \"About what?\" She asked curiously. \"Oh, about him being an asshole.\" He laughed and pulled Bethany down so they were laying. \"You got a practice today?\" Bethany nodded. \"Yeah, same time as yours.\" \"I guess we better get ready then.\" Don kissed her cheek and got up to change. It was late into the practice and Don had dropped another ball. \"It's alright, son.\" Coach Gaines patted him on the back as he motioned to run the play again. \"Let's's do it again!\" Gaines noticed what appeared to be Charles Bilingsley walking towards him and Don. He shook his head and walked over to the sideline. \"Don! Get over here!\" Charlie yelled at his son. Don rolled his eyes and started walking over towards his father. He noticed Bethany, still in her practice clothes, walking closely behind his dad. \"Dad, just get off the field.\" \"No. You tell me why you can't hold onto the football.\" Charlie asked angrily. \"I'll do better next time.\" Don shook his head dismissively and turned to walk away from the scene before something else happened. \"You don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you, boy!\" His father yanked the collar of his jersey and threw him to the ground. \"Charlie!\" Bethany tried to hold him back. \"What the hell is your problem?\" Don spat as Bethany helped him up. \"Get off the field!\" \"Watch your mouth boy!\" Charlie yelled and pushed Don's helmet, which once again knocked him to the ground. \"That's enough, Charlie!\" Bethany said sternly as she tried to push Charlie back. \"Charlie!\" screamed as he knocked her to the ground. As soon as when Bethany was knocked to the ground, Chavez and Winchell and restrained Charlie and Don was helping her up. \"Go home dad! Just go home!\" He shook his head head in anger. Charlie stormed off the field and headed to the parking lot where he sped off in his car. \"You alright?\" Don helped Bethany to the side of the field, looking at her raw elbow. She nodded and smiled as she sat on one of the metal benches. \"Just a turf burn. Nothing a girl can't handle.\" Bethany laughed softly. Don grabbed a wet towel and pressed it gently against her elbow. He watched her hiss as the wet towel touched the area. \"I'm sorry he knocked you down. It's all because I dropped that stupid ball.\" He removed the towel from her elbow. \"It's okay, Don. You shouldn't have to apologize for what he did.\" She stood up and rubbed his cheek with her thumb. \"I know. But he still makes me feel like the ass.\" He chuckled and looked at the ground beneath him. \"But you're not the ass, because I love you.\" She smiled and kissed him. \"Better finish up practice.\" Bethany looked behind them and saw the team running one last play. \"Nah. They're about done anyways.\" He smiled and took Bethany's hand, heading for the locker room. \"What do you say we go do something tonight?\" \"I think that'd be a good idea.\" She smiled and walked hand in hand with him. \"I'll meet you by the car.\" Don waited for Bethany by the car just like he said would. He finally smiled when he saw her walking towards him. \"Took you long enough.\" He laughed and opened the passenger door for her. \"It takes a lot of work for me to get this way.\" Bethany smiled and slid in the car. \"What exactly are we doing tonight?\" \"Well...\" He smiled and got in the drivers seat. \"I was thinking we'd have a picnic in the pasture. If you'd like.\" \"I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.\" She nodded and put her sunglasses on. \"Where are we going to get the food?\" She raised a brow, looking at him curiously. \"We'd have to stop by the diner.\" He started the car and drove out of the parking lot. \"If that's okay?\" \"Fine by me! We'll probably see Mike there or something.\" She laughed at the thought of seeing him there again. \"Probably. He does love that place.\" Don smiled and pulled into the parking lot. \"Want the regular?\" \"Yes please.\" Bethany nodded and she watched Don walk inside the diner. She waited for about fifteen minutes until Don came back with a bag of food. He motioned for her to roll down the window and handed her the plastic bag. He walked over to the other side and got in the drivers seat. \"Was Mike in there?\" Bethany asked and took Don's hand. \"Nah, I think he's at home with his mom.\" Don started the car and drove out of the parking lot, and down the road to the to the pasture. \"How come no one ever goes to his house?\" She asked and side glanced at Don. \"He doesn't like people around his mom. He told me she's bi-polar so he never knows how she'll react.\" Bethany looked down at the bag of the food in her lap, feeling bad for Mike. \"That's awful.\" She whispered. \"He's alright. He'd just rather be out with us most nights.\" Don shrugged and pulled into a a grassy field. \"Now I'm starved.\" He laughed and started opening the bag. After finishing their dinner, Don and Bethany laid on the hood of his car, gazing up at the sky. \"Where do you see us?\" Don asked out of nowhere. \"I mean future wise.\" \"I... I mean I see us together. Maybe married one day.\" Grinning, Bethany snuggled closer to him. \"Why do you ask?\" He shrugged, smiling. \"I dunno. We've been together for almost four years now... You practically live at my house.\" He chuckled. Bethany looked up at Don curiously. \"Why are you thinking about all this now?\" \"I've just had it on my mind. I want to be with you forever, I really mean it.\" Don kissed the top of her head. \"So I was just... I was wondering if you'd want to get married?\" \"Don Bilingsley. You did not just propose to me on the hood of your car, at the age of seventeen.\" Bethany practically shot up. \"I mean, we're just seventeen!\" \"Do you feel seventeen?\" Don eyed her. \"I...\" She shook her head. \"I don't feel seventeen. At all.\" \"Then why shouldn't we get married? We already act like it.\" Don reasoned, standing up. He grabbed Bethany's hand and pulled her off the car. \"You know I'll love you always.\" \"I know, Don.\" Bethany opened her mouth to say more and looked away from his face. \"Then what is it?\" He squeezed her hand gently.\" She looked back at him with a smile. \"It's yes. Yes. Yes, I'll marry you.\" Don grinned as if he had won a million dollars and wrapped his arms around her waist. He laughed softly and kissed her passionately. She slowly pulled her lips away from his, a smile still evident on her face. \"I love you too, always.\" She nodded, still in a feeling of bliss. \"I almost forgot!\" Don let go of her and quickly dug into his jean pocket. \"Here.\" He took her hand and slid a small gold ring with a tiny diamond in the center onto her finger. \"It isn't much...\" \"It's exactly what I wanted.\" Bethany smile and pressed her lips to his again. It was two when Don and Bethany finally got back to his home. They walked in the door hand in hand, still all smiles from earlier that evening. They stopped in their tracks when they saw Charles standing in the living room. \"Where you been, Don?\" Charlie asked, eyeing the two lovebirds. Bethany's smile immediately dropped when she heard is drunken voice. \"Out.\" Don stated simply, leading down Bethany down the hall. \"No, no, boy. You get back here.\" Charlie yelled at his son. Don sighed and let go of Bethany's hand. \"Just wait here.\" He kissed her cheek and went back to the living room. \"So, tell me what you did tonight.\" Charlie cocked his head and sat on the couch. \"Did you fuck her again?\" \"Dad, no!\" Don shook his head and looked at his father with disgust. \"We...\" He debated if he should tell his father what happened. \"I asked Bethany to marry me.\" \"You did what?\" He yelled in rage. \"How goddamn stupid can you get? Can't hold onto a ball and now you asked a girl to marry you.\" Bethany flinched at every word Charlie said. She silently moved closer to the living room. \"Shut the hell up, dad.\" Don rose to stand over his dad. \"Or what?\" Charlie asked tauntingly. \"You gonna hit me son? You hit like a girl.\" The last word made Don snap and threw his fist into his dad's jaw. Bethany ran into the room just in time to see Charlie throw his fist into Don's nose. \"Charlie!\" Bethany knelt down next to Don and wiped some blood off his face. \"Go to bed Charlie.\" Charlie rolled his eyes and muttered drunken nonsense as he walked to his bedroom. \"How bad does it look?\" Don asked, pinching the bridge of his nose. \"Not too bad.\" Bethany bit her lip and wiped more blood. \"It's not swollen yet so I don't think it's broken.\" She helped Don up and led him to his bedroom. He shoved kleenex up his nose to help control the bleeding as Bethany changed into some pajamas. \"He's getting worse, Don.\" She sat on the bed and watched him change. \"I know.\" He mumbled and laid down next to Bethany. \"He'll get better eventually.\" Don whispered and kissed her temple. \"I hope so.\" She sighed and closed her eyes. \"Love you.\" Bethany murmured, already falling asleep. \"Love you too.\" Don murmured back and shut his eyes, trying to sleep.[Chapter 4] I've seen you fight. I've seen you not quit. Can you give me a great effort and just a little bit more. Can you be perfect? The stadium lights lit up the field like a star lit up the sky. Every player was illuminated as was their every every movie. Permian was done by twelve and they need this win to maintain their first place standing. Coach Gaines let out a deep breath before speaking to his team in the locker room. \"The entire dreams of a town rest upon your shoulders.\" He looked around at the room to see the faces of the boys look disappointed. \"You may never matter again in your life as much as you do right now.\" Gaines watched as Mike Winchell and a few other boys stood. Soon the whole team was on their feet and waiting for Gaines next words. \"Now let's go win us a foot ball game!\" The boys cheered in agreement and headed back out to the field, warming up before the third quarter. Out of the corner of his eye, Don saw Bethany waving her pompoms and he turned towards her. She waved her pompom and smiled widely at Don. He waved back and ran over to the sideline so the quarter could start. Before Don knew it, it was time for the offensive line to go in. On their third down, Mike passed to the open space where Don was and Don ran it in for touchdown. He ran off the field and saw his dad nodding in approval. Finally, maybe his dad wouldn't be so angry after a game. \"Nice one, boys!\" Gaines patted Winchell on the back as they ran off field. \"Those are the kind of plays I wanna see!\" Don and Mike grinned and sat on the bench. It seemed as if this game was never going to end. There were three minutes left in the last quarter and Dallas had the ball. Permian was still down by three, they just needed to stop them here. Dallas's quarterback threw to his open man and they scored. The game was over and Permian lost. They're perfect season would now be marred with this game. \"To the locker room boys.\" Gaines shook his head and led them the way. Once they were in the locker room, the boys sat down and waited for Coach to say something. \"You played a hell of a game boys. It's only one game. We can still overcome this and go to state. You're dismissed.\" He nodded curtly and headed to his office. Don and Mike made eye contact and Don shrugged, there wasn't anything he could do about any of if. Bethany met Don outside the locker room. She had changed into a t-shirt and some sweats. The look on his face told her it was going to be a long car ride home with his father. \"Hey.\" He offered a small smile as he greeted her. He took her hand and led her out to the parking lot where they saw his dad. \"Maybe I should get a ride home from Mike.\" Bethany looked up at him with a worried expression. \"Nah, he'll be fine.\" Don shook his head and laced his fingers with hers. \"Where's your ring?\" He looked at their joined hands. \"I left it in the car so I wouldn't lose it.\" She bit her lip as they got closer to the car. \"Took you long enough to get out her.\" Charles rolled his eyes and got in the back seat. Don sighed and slid into the drivers seat as Bethany got into the passenger. \"At least you didn't drop the ball this time.\" Charlie scoffed as Don drove out of the parking lot. Bethany looked to Don and pressed her lips tightly together to keep from saying anything \"Maybe your coach should teach you how to play like men instead of a bunch of girls.\" Charles angrily said. As they were driving down the street to Don's house, a big crash made Bethany jump in her seat. \"What the hell was that?\" Don slammed on the breaks and turned around to face his father. He noticed the broken window and widened his eyes. \"What the hell dad?\" \"I wanted some fresh air.\" Charlie shrugged as he looked out the window. He sighed and toyed with something in his hand. Don looked at his fingers and noticed the object was a ring, Bethany's ring. \"Dad, why the hell do you have Bethany's ring?\" Don asked angrily. Bethany turned around in her seat and widened her eyes. \"Mr. Bilingsley, do you mind if I have that back?\" She bit her lower lip and held out her palm for him to place it in. \"You are two are too young to be getting married.\" Charles shook his head disapprovingly. \"Shut the hell up, dad.\" Don grit his teeth, trying to contain himself. He felt better when Bethany gently placed a hand on his shoulder. \"The two of you don't know anything.\" Charlie threw the ring out the window and onto the side of the road. \"Dad! What the hell is your problem?\" Don scrambled out of the car and ran to the where he heard the ring hit the ground. \"What the fuck is wrong with you?\" He got on his knees and began to search for the ring. Bethany quickly got out of the car and rushed to Don's side. \"I... I can't find it.\" Don whispered, feeling defeated. \"Hey. I don't need a ring to marry you.\" Bethany smiled and pulled him to his feet. Charlie got out of the car laid on the hood of the car, lighting up a cigarette. \"Y'all are just a bunch of idiots.\" Charlie exhaled the smoke. \"Can you just shut the hell up and get in the fucking car?\" Don asked and made his way to his dead. \"Or what? You gonna hit me again? Because you didn't leave one mark on my face.\" Charlie stood up so he and Don were almost eye to eye. \"You play football like a girl and you hit like girl.\" \"I'm not even gonna bother with you anymore.\" Don shook his head and walked away in disgust. \"Let's go home, Bethany.\" He sighed and went to the drivers side of the car. \"Alright.\" Bethany got in the passengers seat and watched Charlie get in the back seat.[Chapter 5] I just want to thank you all for reading and staying with this story. It really means a lot and with the wise words of Mike Winchell, \"I love all y'all. I love all of y'all, baby.\" It's gone after that. And I'll be damned if you're not gonna miss it. Don sat on the recliner in the living room. Bethany was at some cheer meeting which left Don alone with his father for few hours. They hadn't spoken two words to each other since that awful night on the road. \"I'm sorry, Don.\" Charlie said, staring out the kitchen window. Don sat there and ignored what his father was saying. \"I know I'm hard on you but you just... You ain't gettin' it. You don't understand. This is the only thing you're ever gonna have. Forever, it carries you forever. It's an ugly fact of life. Donnie, hell. It's the only fact of life. You got one year, one stinkin' year to make yourself some memories, son. That's all. It's gone after that. And I'll be damned if you're not gonna miss it.\" As his father finished talking, Don brought the beer can to his mouth and took a sip. He hated his father at the moment and wanted nothing to do with him. He never thought about what his father had given up for him, what he sacrificed after his mother left them. All of that went out the window when he started treating Don like dirt and didn't give a rats ass what other people thought. It wasn't fair to him that he got stuck with what he did, but he made the best of it. He created his own destiny and found his own life. It was all he could ever ask the for. As these thoughts ran through his head, Don nodded. \"I know, dad.\" He watched his dad sigh and leave the kitchen and walk back to his bedroom. Don shook his head and finished his beer. He heard the front door open then close and looked up to see Bethany staring at him with her lips pressed together. \"Don't you think it's a bit early to be drinking?\" She moved towards him and sat on the couch. \"It's never too early.\" Don shrugged and placed the empty beer can on the side table. He knew Bethany didn't really like drinking even though she occasionally took part in it. He just couldn't help himself. \"You need to stop this. You're gonna turn out like him...\" Bethany bit her bottom lip and looked at him with her big blue eyes. Don raised his eyebrows in surprise, \"I'm gonna end up like my ass of a father? That's real good to know.\" \"I didn't mean it like that!\" She said defensively. \"I'm just scared you'll turn out like that.\" He sighed and scooted over in the recliner. He motioned for Bethany to come sit with him. \"C'mere.\" She did as he said and cuddled up next to him. \"I love you. I know that things get rough around here but I'll never be someone I'm not. I can promise you that.\" He held her tightly and kissed the top of her head. \"I love you too, Don.\" Bethany smiled and began to get up. \"Where are you going?\" Don looked at her curiously. \"To take a shower.\" She stood up and eyed him. \"Why?\" \"I was just thinking that maybe you'd need some help in there.\" He smirked and waggled his eyebrows. She laughed and grinned, nodding. \"I think that sounds good.\" Bethany bit her lip and pulled him up out of the chair. \"It is awfully hard to turn the water on...\" She smirked back and led him down the hall to the bathroom. \"Gentleman...\" Coach Gaines began as he scanned the room full of football players. \"We are now in a three way tie for first place. Tonight, at an undisclosed location, the other two coaches and I, along with the media, will be flopping coins to see which two teams go to state.\" The boys looked at him with their mouths open and eyes in shock. Their whole future of football depended on a coin toss. \"But, sir.\" Brian Chavez started, \"how is that fair?\" \"It's fair because y'all lost to Midland. That's why it's fair.\" Gaines replied, and with that he dismissed the boys. Don and Mike walked out to where Bethany was waiting for them. \"So, what was that meeting all about?\" She looked to them for an answer. \"Basically, us going to state depends on the flip of a coin.\" Don said as he took her hand and headed to the car. \"That's all because you're in a three way tie for first?\" Bethany asked, astonished. \"Yep.\" Mike replied, \"All because we lost that stupid game to Midland.\" He shook. \"We just better win that god forsaken coin toss.\" He rolled his eyes and unlocked his car. \"I'll see y'all tomorrow.\" He smiled and got in his car, driving away. \"I can't believe that's how they decide who goes.\" Bethany got into the passenger side as Don got into the drivers side. \"I know. It's fucking unbelievable.\" He shook his head and started the car. \"Yeah, pretty unbelievable.\" She said nervously and looked at the road in front of them. Don noticed her hand shaking and raise a brow, \"Everything okay?\" \"I- I think so.\" Bethany nodded and looked at him. \"Do you want a family one day? With me, I mean.\" He nodded and continued to drive. \"Of course I do. When I said I wanted to be together forever, I meant it. Why are you asking me this now?\" \"Well... While you were at the meeting,\" Bethany took a breath before continuing, \"I took a pregnancy test. Two... More like three actually.\" She laughed nervously. \"And... And I'm pregnant.\" \"You're pregnant?\" Don repeated in shock, a small smile beginning to form on his lips. She nodded again as her eyes widened. \"Are you mad?\" \"You think I'm mad? Mad?\" He shook his head and grinned. \"I don't think I've ever been happier!\" \"Really?\" Bethany smiled. \"I thought you were going to freak out and say that it was too soon and we weren't ready but then I remembered that you said we were already adults because we'd been together for so long...\" She continued to talk faster. \"Bethany, you're rambling.\" He took her hand and pulled into the driveway. \"C'mon, let's get inside.\" He smiled and quickly got out of the car. They walked inside holding hands and smiling. Bethany's smile dropped when she saw Charlie sitting in the living room. Her grip on Don's hand tightened. \"What are you two so giddy about?\" Charlie asked the couple skeptically. \"I've just been making my own memories.\" Don smiled, throwing his fathers words back at him. \"Making my own memories to carry me forever.\" He led Bethany back to his room. \"You do know this means we'll have to tell your dad and he'll more than likely kick us out.\" Bethany sat on his bed and looked up at him. \"He won't do that. I won't let him.\" He sat down next to her and wrapped an arm around her shoulder. \"Everything we'll be okay. I promise.\" Tonight was the night. Tonight was the night the Permian Panther's football fate would be decided. Mike Winchell accompanied Coach Gaines to the meeting of the coaches. Brian Chavez and his girl, Alyce, were over at Don's house to watch the toss. \"You think we'll win?\" Chavez asked as he sat down next to Alyce. \"Dunno.\" Don shrugged and turned the TV on to the local news station. On the screen appeared Coach Gaines, Mike, and the two other coaches from the rival schools. It seemed that they had already flipped their coins. The coach from Midland seemed happy so one could only assume his coin landed on heads. The camera zoomed in on the coach from Eastern as he read his coin. It was heads. All that was left was Gaines. \"Coach.\" They could see Mike point to coin near his foot. \"I think it's yours.\" They watched as Gaines walked to the coin and bent down to look at it. \"Heads,\" Gaines nodded. Everyone in the room looked at each other wondering what that mean. \"Now, hold on a moment,\" The coach from Midland said as he examined the Eastern coach's coin. \"That there looks more tails to me than heads.\" The coach from Eastern looked at his coin one more time and nodded disappointingly. \"He's right. It's tails.\" The Eastern coach shrugged. Don turned off the smile and grinned. \"Looks like we're going to state y'all!\" Brian jumped up and yelled. Don hollered and kissed Bethany on the cheek. \"We're going to state!\" Brian yelled again. \"Sit down, Chavo!\" Don laughed. \"It's time for the lady and I to get out of here. We've got a big day ahead of us!\" Chavez helped Alyce up. Bethany and Don walked them out of the house and to the Chavez's car. \"I'll see you tomorrow, Chavo!\" He hit the back of the car as it sped away. \"Can you believe we're going to state?\" Don asked in astonishment at he took Bethany in his arms and started to sway her in the road. \"No.\" She smiled and shook her head. \"It's a Friday night miracle.\" As she spoke the last few words she saw bright lights coming closer and heard tires screeching. \"Don!\" She yelled and was barely able to push him out of the way before her body was being hit by the car.[Chapter 6] Roots and lies, roots and lies, our family tree is old From there we climb the golden hill, calmly will eternity I held your heart, a giant wand; all tell of sorrow And history begins to be blue and brown eyes \"Don Bilingsley?\" The nurse in a pink uniform called out, searching the waiting room. \"That's me.\" Don stood and walked over to the nurse. \"As I understand, you're the family of Miss Bethany?\" The nurse shuffled through the folder of papers. \"I'm the only family she's got.\" He waited for her to continue. \"Right. Like I was saying, you're the only family of Miss Bethany.\" She began to lead Don down a hall. \"The doctors were able to stabilize her, however, she did crash once in the ER.\" The nurse stopped in front of a door with a small window. \"Now, I must warn you before entering, she looks much worse off than she really is. She's on a morphine drip and has stitches on her face. She's a fighter Mr. Bilingsley.\" The nurse opened the door and allowed Don to enter. Don took a deep, shaky breath when he saw Bethany laying motionless on the bed. He went and sat in the nearest chair by her and shook his head. \"I'm so sorry, Bethany.\" He felt the tears stinging his eyes. \"It should have been me. Not you.\" He softly took her hand in his. \"I wish you could open your eyes. I miss their beautiful color.\" He pressed his lips to her hand. He sighed and looked up when he heard a knock on the door. Don watched as Mike entered the room. \"News travels fast.\" Mike whispered and sat down in a chair next to Don. \"I'm so sorry.\" \"It's not your fault.\" Don replied, his voice hoarse. \"It's that fucking asshole who hit her who should be sorry.\" Mike placed a hand on Don's shoulder and looked down at the sleeping figure of Bethany. \"She's gonna be okay, Don. She came out of that alive.\" \"I know.\" Don nodded, his eyes never leaving Bethany. \"I'll be back later. Call if you need anything.\" Mike patted Don's shoulder and left the room. \"I wish you'd wake up soon. I need you to wake up.\" Don whispered, wiping his eyes. \"I miss your beautiful eyes and that pretty smile of yours. Mike misses you. Both him and the nurse agree that you're a fighter. You're the toughest girl I know. You put up with me and my dad. Not very people can.\" He laughed softly. \"I promise, that if you wake up soon, I'll make sure my dad will come and visit you. He may not show it well, but I know he likes you. I think he likes you even more than me!\" He laughed again. \"I think you're his favorite, out of the two of us. Don't let him know I told you that. He doesn't like showing he's all soft and mushy on the inside. He'd rather be a tough drunk.\" Don kissed her hand gently and placed it back on the bed. \"Please, please wake up soon...\" As he placed his head in his hands, he heard a small moan come from the bed. \"Bethany...?\" He looked up just in time to see her eyelids flutter open. \"Bethany!\" \"Hi...\" She whispered, her voice hoarse from being so dry. \"You're awake!\" Don grinned and grasped her hand. \"You're awake.\" He repeated and kissed her cheek, avoiding the bruises. \"I was so scared that you weren't gonna wake up.\" He looked at her with tears threatening to spill. \"I'm okay. I'm okay.\" Bethany smiled slightly and gently pulled him down to her. \"I probably look like hell right now.\" She laughed and flinched from the pain in her ribs. \"You went through hell, baby.\" He kissed her cheek again. \"A broken leg, cracked rib, stitches on your forehead and a black eye. You're one tough cheerleader.\" \"That I am.\" She smiled and placed her hand on her stomach. \"Is... Is the baby okay?\" Bethany looked up at him with wide eyes. \"The doctor hasn't come in yet,\" he cleared his throat, \"but I can call him.\" He leaned over and pressed a button on the remote for the doctor. A few minutes later, a doctor walked in. \"Well, Miss Bethany, it's nice to see those eyes open.\" Doctor Taylor stood at the end of the bed. \"You gave us quite the scare.\" Bethany gave a small smile and nodded. \"I guess I did.\" \"Well, it seems that all of your vitals appear to be in excellent condition. Now for the harder part. When you brought into surgery, we were informed of your pregnancy. However, with your condition, we made you our top priority and focused solely on you. As of this moment, I am not sure on your baby's condition. What I do is have an OBGYN come in here immediately and tell you. Is that alright?\" Don and Bethany glanced at each other and she nodded while he spoke, \"Y-Yeah. That's fine.\" \"Then I'll have the nurse in to see you in a minute.\" Doctor Taylor smiled, pressed a button on the remote and left the room. \"Don,\" Bethany bit her lip, \"I'm sorry.\" \"Why are you sorry, Bethany?\" He looked at her and squeezed her hand. \"None of this was your fault. Nothing was your fault at all.\" \"I know... But what if something happens to the baby?\" She looked up at him with watery eyes. \"I don't want anything to happen.\" \"Nothing will happen. Everything's gonna be okay.\" Don gently kissed her cheek and sat on the edge of her bed as the nurse walked in. \"I'm Nurse Julie, and what I'm gonna do is perform an ultrasound and check for a heartbeat.\" The nurse in pink said as she plugged in the machine. \"Y'all ready for this?\" She looked directly at Bethany, and she nodded. \"Let's get started.\" She gently raised Bethany's shirt above her stomach and applied cold goo on her belly. \"Here we go.\" Nurse Julie gently pressed a giant remote looking object to her stomach and started to move it around. Don had an arm wrapped around Bethany who was biting on her thumbnail. \"There we are.\" The nurse pointed to a small dot on the screen. \"That is your baby's heartbeat.\" She smiled warmly at the couple. Bethany looked to Don with a relieved smile present on her face and he looked to her. Immediately their lips collided with joy and relief. \"I don't see why you think I need help walking, Don.\" Bethany laughed as Don held open the door to the house for her. \"I'm not some weak girl who can't walk around.\" Don laughed and shook his head as he let her enter. \"I know, I just wanna make sure you're taken care of.\" He shut the door behind him and saw his father standing in the living room with a bouquet of daisies. \"What are you doing, dad?\" He questioned and helped Bethany to the couch. \"I just realized I never made it to the hospital to see you, Bethany.\" Charlie looked in her direction. \"These are few you.\" He handed the flowers to Bethany. \"Thank you, Charlie.\" Bethany smiled and took the flowers from him. \"They're lovely.\" Charlie smiled slightly and looked towards his son. \"I-I got the bags, boy. Sit down with her.\" He nodded and took Bethany's bag out of Don's hand and headed towards their bedroom. \"Well, that was extremely unexpected.\" Don shrugged and sat down next to Bethany and wrapped an arm around her so she could rest her head on his shoulder. \"Unexpected but nice.\" \"I think he's changing.\" Bethany smiled and placed the flowers in her lap. \"I think it's good.\" \"Me too, I just hope he doesn't go back to the ass he was before.\" He laughed and kissed her forehead. \"We're gonna be alright, aren't we?\" He said more as statement rather than a question. \"We are. We can get through this, just like we do everything else.\" Bethany whispered and shut her eyes.[Chapter 7] C'mon man. This is god given. The only thing I gotta do is show up. \"Baby, please smile.\" Don got down on his knees in front of her. He looked up at her with a frown on his face and puppy dog eyes. Bethany folded her arms across her chest and looked away from his face. \"I'll smile when you let me leave the damn house again.\" She glanced at her growing belly and smiled slightly. \"You haven't let me leave the house in three weeks. I've been stuck here while you're at football practice for state with your dad. I mean, I love Charlie but frankly, he's getting to be a bit much. He won't stop feeding me! I mean yes, I'm still on crutches and pregnant, but it'd be nice to be apart of society again.\" Don put hand over his mouth and did his best not to laugh. \"You know, you'd think with my dad being all nice now that you would want to stay with him. Plus, his cooking has improved.\" She rolled her eyes and went to grab her crutches. \"Now you either let me go to practice with you today or I won't smile at all.\" Bethany raised a brow and used her crutches to stand. \"Fine, fine.\" He stood in front of her, \"You can come to practice with me. But, you have to smile and give me a kiss.\" Don smirked. Pretending to think about the offer, she pursed her lips. \"Deal.\" She nodded and pressed her lips to his. He smiled against her lips and slowly pulled away. \"Well, Miss Bethany. You certainly are the best kissing partner to ever exist in the history of the world.\" \"You bet I am, Bilingsley.\" She smiled and kissed him again. \"We better get to your practice.\" \"I guess we should. Now let me help you.\" Don grabbed both her small bag and his football and helped her out the door into the car. \"When's your state game?\" She rolled down the window turned up the air conditioning. For being so late into Fall already, it was surprisingly warm. \"This Friday.\" He took her hand and continued to drive to the school. Bethany glanced at their hands and sighed. \"Is it bad I'm terrified for you? I mean, those guys over at Dallas are huge and they could practically squash you.\" \"No one's gonna squash me,\" Don chuckled and pulled into the school parking lot. \"You do remember that I'm on of the strongest, right?\" \"Of course I remember that!\" She rolled her eyes and motioned for him to help her. \"I just don't want you to get hurt.\" \"Bethany,\" he started and helped her out of the car and onto her crutches, \"I promise I won't get hurt. Now I'll meet you out on the field. Think you can make it that far?\" She slung her bag over shoulder and laughed. \"I broke a leg, I'm not elderly.\" \"I'll talk to you after practice.\" He kissed her forehead and headed towards the locker room. \"Huddle up, boys!\" Coach Gaines called for all the boys and they immediately ran into the center of the field. \"We have our final game in two days against the biggest monsters in the state of Texas, Dallas Carter. Those boys will do everything in their power to strip you of the ball. What you have to do is hold them on their line and score. They will stop at nothing to make sure they win. Now, there won't be any practice tomorrow because we will be leaving early in the morning to get to the AstroDome. Let's win us a state championship men. I'll see you tomorrow.\" And with that he dismissed the group of tired, sweaty football players. Don sighed and walked towards Bethany who was waiting at the gate for him. He couldn't believe that she was here with him. Only a few weeks ago he thought he had lost her for good. But now she was here with him, and she was pregnant which put an enormous smile on his face. \"Hey! How was practice?\" She asked as he walked up to her. He shrugged as if to say nothing. \"It was fine. Just another practice. How are you two feeling?\" Don wrapped and arm around her as she hobbled to the car. \"Little Miss and I are just fine.\" Bethany grinned from ear to ear. \"Little Miss?\" Don looked at her with curiosity. \"Why a Miss?\" She let him open the car door and sat down. \"I just have this gut feeling that it's a girl. Trust me, us women can feel these things.\" Laughing, she shut the door and watched him get in the drivers seat. \"I believe it's gonna be a boy. That I can teach to play football and become a star like his daddy.\" He smiled and started the car. \"You're wrong!\" Bethany said in a sing-song voice. \"While we're out, can we stop and get some food? I'm starving.\" Don laughed and pulled out of the parking lot. \"You're always hungry!\" \"I know I am, but now I have a reason. I get to eat for two!\" She placed a hand on her stomach. \"So can we please stop at the diner?\" \"Whatever you say, Miss Bethany.\" He smiled and drove towards the diner. \"Has anyone told you that you eat like a trucker?\" Don asked with his mouth hanging slightly open. \"All I've had for the last two weeks is your dad's casserole and frankly, I love burgers.\" Bethany grinned and took a sip of her water. \"I guess I should have taken you out of the house sooner if you felt that way about my dad's cooking!\" He pretend to be upset and placed a hand on his heart. \"Be quiet.\" She rolled her eyes. \"This is the best burger ever.\" \"Sometimes I think you're insane.\" Don smiled. \"I'm not insane, just hungry.\"[Chapter 8] I think you're scared just like the rest of us. But I think you're smart enough to see that one day when you look back from whatever big job or big house, or whatever it is that you got, that when you look back at this time, I dare you to beat it. I dare you. \"Gentlemen.\" Coach Gaines nodded towards the group of football players. \"Tonight is the last time some of you will ever play football. The entire dreams of a town are riding on your shoulders. Throughout the season, you have proven multiple reporters wrong by going out and doing what you do best, being perfect. I need you to be perfect one last night. I want all of y'all to play for Boobie, play for your families, and most of all play with your hearts full. If you do that, there is no way we can lose. So let's take care of it!\" The boys circled up and held their helmets up high, cheering with enthusiasm. Gaines followed the running boys out onto the field. He smiled and watched them as they ran through an enormous poster and what appeared to be fake smoke. The boys ran to their sideline and started to pump up their fans by cheering and waving their arms. He watched Don Bilingsley embrace Bethany who was still on crutches. Gaines smiled and called his boys in. \"Now I want a nice clean game.\" Coach scanned the huddle. \"Now go win us a state championship!\" The offensive line nodded in unison and ran onto the field. The lined up in formation as Mike called out the play. \"Hike!\" He yelled. As the ball got to his hands he was hit to the ground. \"Stay there, pretty boy.\" Number eight of Dallas Carter taunted as he leaned over Mike's body. Mike stood up and called for a huddle. \"What the hell was that? Who was blocking?\" He looked at his team and they shrugged. \"Just don't let it happen again. Break!\" And they ran to line back up. He snapped the ball and handed it off to Don who ran for three yards before he was brought down by two of the Dallas Carter players. \"Bilingsley!\" Gaines yelled. \"Stay on your damn feet!\" The boys ran back and lined up in formation again. Mike threw the ball but somehow it was intercepted and ran back for a touchdown. The rest of the first quarter and nearly all of the second quarter went just as miserably as the first play. By halftime, Dallas Carter was up with the score being 21 to 3. Gaines looked around at the empty faces of his football players. They looked already defeated but the game wasn't even over. He had no clue what to say to them at this point until a player stood up and spoke. \"What's wrong with y'all? Y'all are playin' like some little girls! Y'all act like you never played football before! These guys are nothin'! They bleed just like we do, and sweat just like we do. They went through two-a-days. We went through two-a-days in 110 degree heat. I want you to hit everything that moves! If the ref gets in your way, you hit him! They're cheatin' us too! They're against us too. This is our team. This is us! Let's go right now! Let's get it off now and let's go!\" Ivory Christian yelled at his teammates. Coach Gaines nodded with energy and smiled slightly. \"Now y'all need to settle down. I want you to take a moment, and I want you to look each other in the eyes. I want you to put each other in your hearts forever because forever is about to happen here in just a few minutes. I want you to close your eyes, and I want you to think about Boobie Miles, who is your brother. And he would die to be out there in that field with you tonight. And I want you to put that in your hearts. Boys my heart is full. My heart is full.\" The team stood up and nodded, cheering with energy that seemed to be missing in the previous quarters. There were three minutes left in the fourth quarter. Mike had an enormous bloodstain right under his chin, Don Bilingsley was covered in turf burns, and Chavez looked like he was going to die. \"Now-Now we're gonna hand the ball of to Don and he's gonna run.\" Mike glanced at his players. \"Break!\" The team lined up in formation and got ready for Mike to hike the ball. \"Set, hike!\" Mike yelled and handed off the ball to Don right before he was trucked by two of the Dallas Carter boys. He watched Don run from the ground and widened his eyes as he was hit and fell on his right shoulder. He looked to the sideline to Bethany who had a hand over her mouth and was looking at Don and the medical team with fear. They helped walk him off the field and to the medical bench. \"Dislocated his right shoulder.\" One of the trainers commented as Bethany hobbled over. \"You still wanna play, son?\" \"Just pop it in.\" Don nodded. Bethany held her hand out for him to grab and winced as he squeezed it. With a loud yell of pain, Don's shoulder was popped back into place. \"Go win, Don. I know you can do it.\" Bethany smiled and kissed his cheek before he ran back onto the field. Time was winding down as Don glanced at the scoreboard. There was eleven seconds left and all they need was a touchdown to win. \"We're... We're gonna fake a pass and I'll run it in.\" Mike said feeling out of breath. \"Yo, Mike.\" Don looked at his friend. \"You okay?\" \"Yeah. I'm okay. For the state championship. I love all y'all. I love all of y'all, baby.\" Mike nodded and led his team to the line. \"Hike!\" He called and the ball was snapped. He pretended to look for the open man and after a second, with three seconds left on the clock, he began to run. Everyone in the stadium was holding their breath as they watched Mike Winchell fall right at the line. The refs ran up and indicated no score and Dallas Carter began to cheer. Mike laid there in defeat with tears in his eye. Don sat down a few feet away and took of his helmet, placing his head on his knees. Bethany placed a hand on Don's shoulder and he looked up at her. When he saw her, he stood up and embraced her. \"It's okay. It's okay.\" She whispered in his ear, holding him close. She turned around when she felt someone tap her shoulder and came face to face with his dad. Bethany stood aside while she let Don and Charlie have their moment. \"You did well, boy.\" Charlie gave a small smile and nodded. \"Just not good enough.\" Don said his voice hoarse. Charlie shook his head and grabbed his sons hand. He opened his palm and placed the engagement ring in it. Don looked at his hand with shock and instantly pulled his father in for a hug. \"Thank you.\" It had been two days since that heartbreaking loss at state. Only two days since his high school football career ended. Don didn't live up to his fathers fame, and he was perfectly okay with that. As he, Chavez, and Mike walked away from the gym, the stopped and looked at each other. \"You gonna miss it?\" Mike asked his now former teammates. \"I'm gonna miss the heat.\" Chavez replied while squinting his eyes. Pausing for a moment before he spoke, Don finally said, \"I'm gonna miss the lights.\" Mike nodded in agreement as watched Don walk away. \"Hey! Where you going?\" He called after Don as he and Chavez followed. \"I'm going home.\" Don smiled widely, one neither of the boys had seen since that final game. \"Hey, Chavo!\" Don yelled his nickname for Chavez as he opened his car door. \"Stay perfect.\" Chavez chuckled as he began to get in his car, \"You stay perfect.\" He grinned and got into his car before driving away. \"I'll see you English, Mike.\" Don smiled and watched his buddy nod and drive away. \"Ready to go home?\" Bethany looked at him as he got into the drivers seat. \"I'm ready.\" Don kissed her softly and started the car. \"You ready?\" \"Ready for what?\" She looked at him with a confused look on her face. \"The future.\" He grinned and drove out of the parking lot. \"As long as you're in it, then I am.\" Bethany took his hand and squeezed it. \"Then let's go home.\" Don took his hand from hers and placed an arm around her shoulder and she leaned against his shoulder. \"I love you, Don.\" She smiled and shut her eyes as the sun shined through the windshield. \"I love you too, Bethany.\" He kissed her forehead and began the drive home down the country road.

Don Bilingsley look"},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"Different ways to Fall","Author":"Miarka","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10096100","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A couple of weeks ago I saw the film The Fall for the first time after hearing loads about it (mostly from all the gifsets on tumblr). I was pleasantly surprised, it's not only beautifully shot, costumed and cast but also a very meaningful movie and deserves more attention. After seeing the film I went to read the fanfics on it that I could find, and became inspired to write my own. Above all I loved the relationship between Roy and Alexandria, it's so beautifully genuine and believable. I know it might be a bit weird to turn them into a pairing, but I'll do my best. So without further ado, welcome to my first The Fall fanfic; 'Different ways to Fall', please enjoy! The journey has taken me two hours. Or is it ten years? My imaginative mind has never left me, and even as I stand here at the ripe age of eighteen my thoughts still try to push creative ideas through everything I see. I'm not a little girl anymore. Not that I want to be. Or do I? I've felt so torn recently, and I'm certain this dreamy little hope I have is the only answer. The baby-blue coloured bus that took me in the early morning from the orange grove that is my home to Hollywood pulls away. The other passengers exit and scatter in many directions, getting on with their busy and bustling lives. But somehow I just can't seem to do the same. I had dosed for most of the journey with my head pressed up against the murky window. But now fluffy clouds patter across a sapphire blue sky as the morning sun streams down onto the sidewalk I stand alone on. Facing me across the boulevard is the colossal Warner Brothers studio. I suck in a huge gulp of warm air and pull my brown leather satchel further up onto my shoulder and start my way across the road to the studio entrance. As I walk I find myself questioning how on earth I came to decision to be here now. Of course it's not all about my emotions; I'm here on business too. But I start to wonder if I'm just thinking this in denial? Why I'm coming on business is technically because of my emotions. I start to think back to the very beginning; ten years ago, when I was a little girl with only one working arm. Over the years the memories have become blurred. Mother has mentioned the hospital over the years. But now I cannot remember what it looked like, big or small? What were the beds like? I remember there were some nice people, but I can't remember what they looked like just that they belong to a building I also can't remember the appearance of. But among all the faces that must have been in that Hospital there is only one person I will never forget. Roy. I can always bring back the memory of his face, and pinching his toes, and his words. When all other things of my childhood become blurred his words will always stick true and clear in my mind, as if he is standing beside me and telling them to me all over again. Words about strength and saving souls, and Alexander the Great, but best of all is the words about The Masked Bandit and the people he knew. I find it impossible to believe it's been ten years since he spoke those words to me. My broken arm healed and I was gone from the hospital long before Roy was on the way to recovery. I only found out he'd healed when I saw him in the pictures. In the holidays Mother used to take me and my sister Gabriel to them and then I'd see Roy, only for a second or so, he'd be narrowly avoiding a train, or taking a hit by something dangerous, or climbing high up among many tall building the likes of which we don't have at home. And then the second would pass and he'd be gone, replaced with the face of the star of the show. I've never went to the pictures to see the famous faces but while growing up seeing Roy was always a comfort, even if it was only on screen and never for real. But the years passed and with them I grew older, and Mother needed me to help her more often in the grove now that Gabriel and I were strong enough too, between that and my lessons my visits to the theatre became less. And Roy became more of a memory than a presence in my life through the silver screen. Still I never forgot his words, especially his epic tale. Some nights after lessons and then further work tending and gathering oranges out in the fields I would come home to find sleep not agreeing to me, so I would tell myself just a little part of Roy's story every night, perhaps subconsciously I was trying to keep his presence in my life alive. And that's how I came to write the story down. Night after night I would set a candle by my open window and pull my bed sheets over me, forming a tent reminding me of the white drapes the hung around Roy's bed in the hospital. And I would handwrite the tale of the Masked Bandit down on paper I'd taken from spare books at school, word for word, exactly as I remembered it as he told it to me, persevered forever in my mind and on paper. Then came my eighteenth birthday and I hadn't been able to go to the movie theatre for years, both money and work were hard after '29. But Mother let Gabriel and me and some of the other girls from the grove go into town and have a meal in a restaurant and to go see one of the new Talkies. We went to see the film, and there was Roy. And I realised it would soon be ten years since I took that fall which brought me to him. I couldn't believe he's still acting. Shouldn't he be too old for such dangerous work now? I finished writing the story two months later, and then I spent hours after lessons had ended still in school to use the typewriter. Finally satisfied that I'd got the epic right, I've arrived in L.A. with an appointment with a book publisher tomorrow. Just one thing remains to be done, after all only part of the tale in mine. The last film I saw Roy in was made by the Warner Brothers Studios, with any luck he's still working for them now. This is ridiculous, I tell myself for the umpteenth time as I stand before enormous entrance to the studio. But no matter how many times I think it I still don't change my mind. Past the gates I find a small building with large glass windows and I can see security men sitting inside. A twinge of nerves volts through me but I've come too far and waited too long to turn back now. I walk up the few steps and knock twice on the side of the open door. The security men all glance up at me, most of them stare at me with blank faces but the oldest of the team, apparently the leader indicated by the gold badge he wears unlike the others, spreads a warm and welcoming smile across his face. \"Something I can do for you, kid?\" He asks kind-heartedly. \"Yes.\" I answer with a twitch of a smile on my face and I cross the room to where he sits. The other men all go back to their work with bored expressions on their faces. \"I'm looking for Roy Walker; I have some business to discuss with him.\" \"Roy Walker.\" He repeats, testing out the name. \"What department does he work in?\" \"Stunt work, I think.\" I add the 'I think' lamely onto the end, partly because I don't want to make trouble for him, partly because I don't want to get my own hopes up. What are the chances the Roy still works here, and is in the studio today, and has the time to see me? \"To be honest, I'm not even certain he still works here. It's just the last thing I heard.\" I blurt out, more for my own fears than anything to help the chief of security. He throws me another kind smile and stands slowly up. \"I'll check are records.\" He says and walks briskly over to a shelf of folders lining the one non-windowed side of the room. I wait while he flicks through a large folder practically hearing the scoffing smiles of the security guards behind me. This may be Hollywood, but I don't suppose they have a strange young lady walk into their station all that often. \"Ah.\" The chief cries. \"Here we are.\" My heart skips a beat. I want to dash over to read the information he's found in the folder but I find my legs entirely weak, it seems to take eternity for me to walk over to where he stands with the open folder. \"Yes, Roy Walker.\" He says, jabbing a finger into the file. I peer cautiously over to look at the information. \"Says in his schedule he's due in today, filming in studio eight.\" The chief continues. I force the large lump that's appeared in my throat back down again. After all these years I'm finally going to see him again. \"Can I go see him?\" I managed to squeak out. \"Now then, slow down a minute there, kid.\" My incredible helper replies as he snaps the folder shut and gives me a comically stern glare. \"Your Mister Walker is doing big business up in studio eight; I can't let anyone go wondering in.\" I just stand there in a daze and contemplating the fact that he just remarked Roy as being mine. He carefully places the file back in the right place and strides over to one of the desks lining the room and I follow after him. \"Now then, I'll call up one of our boy scouts and see if he can take you over to see Mister Walker during his lunch break, they're not really boy scouts that's just the name we have for them because security guards makes them sound tougher than they really are, they're not bad lads actually.\" He twirls a number into the phone as I wait with held breath and listen to one half of the conversation. \"Hello there, Charlie. How's the job keeping you? Good, good.\" The chief continues on with his small talk for a minute or so. \"Listen I've got a young lady here. Miss...?\" He glances up at me with a questioning face. \"Carmen.\" I tell him my surname promptly. \"...Miss Carmen. She says she's got some business to discuss with Roy Walker, one of our stunt lads. Are you free after midday, kid?\" He asks, holding the phone receiver below his chin and shooting me another glance. I nod quickly at him, I had planned nothing for today. \"I'm wondering if you could take her over to see him during the lunch break?\" The chief continues, talking into the phone once again. \"Studio eight is scheduled to have lunch break at 1:30. Will you take her over to the cafeteria there? Thanks Charlie.\" He puts the phone down and I stare expectantly at him. \"Charlie says he'll take you to Studio eight's cafeteria in about three hours. Come back here then and he'll pick you up, kid.\" He tells me. I agree to his terms and thank him and scuttle out the door as quickly as possible for fear that if I stay any longer I'll give him a bear hug and bust into happy tears. The ten years that I've spent without Roy physically in my life seem to have sped by compared to the crawling speed the next three hours seem to take. I sit in a cafe across the street from the studios watching the world go by and drinking cup of tea after cup of tea. I know I should eat something; after all I skipped breakfast this morning to get the bus, but my stomach feels like its left me, along with my lungs and my heart and every other vital organ in my body. I feel as if I'm one of the wispy clouds above my head. Floating, and waiting, waiting to go somewhere, waiting for these three hours to end. Finally my time comes up and I tug my black coat that I wear loosely on my shoulders like a cape over my shawl and dash across the road. I'm early, leaving for me to stand awkwardly in the middle of the security guard's station as the minutes slide by, until a shadow cuts away the light streaming in from the door and we hear a brisk tap. \"Ah, Charlie. Good to see you, lad.\" The chief says as he looks up and across at a man in similar uniform about ten years younger than he is. Charlie smiles brightly and marches into the room. \"Miss Carmen, Charlie Billson.\" The chief says and throws his hand out to indicate each of us as he says our names. Thankfully the two guards spare me from my anxiousness with time with very little small talk unlike their conversation on the phone. Before too long Billson and I are leaving the security station and he shows me to a little vehicle, like the golf carts I've seen on post cards. I get into the passenger's seat and we drive away. The studio is very active, there are women walking about in elegant ball gowns and a cigarette in their hand, burly men carry pieces of hard card with paintings of a far off landscape on them from studio to another, but I only take fleeting looks at them, my mind is on the place we're speeding along to, and the person that's going to be there. When we arrive I hop off the 'golf cart' and take in my surroundings. I'm standing at the top of two steps, descending into a circle full of tables nailed to the floor with large umbrellas open above their heads. On the left side of this circle a small building that has open double doors all along its front side and people both in peculiar costumes and normal fashions stream in and out of the doors carrying food or clean plates on trays to and from the tables and the building. On the right side across a small road a towering building stands with a large number eight sign stapled high on its front wall. Billson picks his way through crowd and I float after him. \"Roy Walker.\" He calls and strides with ease over to a man and stands before him, blocking him from my view. I'm left to drive my way through the horde. \"Miss Carmen.\" Billson is just saying to the other as I turn up and with that he strides off with an equal look of ease as before. I turn my eyes down to the person sitting at the table. I'm well prepared for this moment, or at least I was. My mouth parts open slightly and I just stare for a few seconds at him. Roy. Ten years on. Ten years? I wouldn't know it. The fact that he sits now with legs firmly bent in use is the only thing that shows the passage of time in him. No wait, I realise as I study his face. If anything he appears better. Somehow there is more, warmth in him. It sounds a silly description, but it's true. His eyes are deeper, his lips have more color in them, and his face looks warmer. This is not the broken soul I first met in a hospital all those years ago. I fixed that. He is half dressed in the costume I presume is for the film he's working on today, but he wears a plain white T-shirt, like the ones American soldiers wear, underneath. \"Miss Carmen?\" He asks politely as he looks up at me. I do my best to compose myself, even though all the organs that I seemed to have been missing for the past hours have returned. My heart defiantly has a least; it's beating so hard, fast and loud that I can barely think. I sit down opposite him at the table, slinging my satchel off and holding it on my lap. \"Hello Roy.\" I finally manage to utter out. \"Is there something I can do for you?\" He questions. \"Yes.\" I mumble in reply and force my eyes away from him as I fumble with the clasp of my satchel, I find it much more difficult than I usually would but not looking at his face helps and eventually I calm myself down enough to open the bag and pull out a thick pile of paper held in a leather folder and place it on the table before him. I have to meet his eyes again, this time thankfully with a little confidence. He looks from the leather encased story to me. \"Is this a script? Because I'm afraid you've come to the wrong person, Miss-\" \"No.\" I cut him off, growing greater confidence in the satisfaction of doing so. \"It's not a script. I will, no matter what, allow this to be adapted into a picture. I want people to use their imagination when this is read.\" \"A book?\" He questions and stares at me as if he's trying to make up his mind if I'm insane or not. \"Will you please just read it? Even just the title page?\" I beg, and stare down at the leather folder because I can't look into his eyes any longer. His gaze is so penetrating. I hear a noise that sounds like a mix of a cough and a small laugh escape his lips before he draws the folder towards him and pulls the elastic ribbon off it and opens it up. My eyes flash back up to his face now that his focus is on the paper inside the folder. I scrutinise his eyes closely as their gaze flickers across the title page of our story. The tale has been carefully written up on a typewriter, but the title page is the one thing inside that is handwritten in my proud and elegant hand. The Adventures of the Masked Bandit A Novel By Alexandria Carmen His pupils dilate as the realisation clicks into him. He lifts his gaze from the paper and black ink to meet my own eyes and his mouth drops open as he stares at me in disbelief. \"Hello Roy.\" I repeat and give him the same widespread and warm smile I used to give to him as a little girl. \"Alexandria, from the hospital?\" He gasps. I nod my head firmly. \"Yes.\" \"You...you're a woman.\" He stammers out. I suddenly realise the most stupid and obvious thing. All this time I've been wondering about Roy and his changes after all these years. I never once spared the thought of how I will have changed to him. And I have changed. I glance down at myself as I sit in the chair. I've grown tall. I still wear my hair in two braided pigtails, but my hair is substantially longer, just below my waist. I have a full set of teeth, though there is a noticeable gap between the front two, but I've never minded. The white blouse and swing skirt I have the shirt tucked neatly into beneath my black coat and the traditional shawl tied around me show the curves I've developed, plus considerable length of my legs. I splash a little bit of make-up on my face now, but I used my very best lipstick today for the city. Even my accent lingers only a little now, in the way I finish my sentences. I've been surrounded by many other voices over the years, and thus my own voice has altered. All in all Roy is right. I'm not the little girl he knew anymore. I'm a woman. \"Yes.\" I answer as I look back up at him and smile, showing my complete strength. \"I suppose I am now.\" At long last he remembers to shut his mouth and he keeps it firmly closed for a moment, he just sits opposite me and looks over the changes. I'm happy enough to just here and watch him myself. I can tell he's thinking hard on everything that's happened, where we are now, and where it began all those years ago. \"I can walk again.\" He says finally. \"I know.\" I reply. \"I came to see you.\" He stares at me, confused. \"In the theatre.\" I add. \"Ah.\" He sighs and sits back into his chair a little more. \"You saw my films?\" \"Yes. I'm surprised you stuck at it for this long actually.\" I admit, looking down. It strikes me the fact that Roy refers to the pictures as 'his films', I can remember his words about them when I told him I'd never seen one. You're not missing much. When I look back up at him he's not smiling at me, but somehow I can see the smile in his face. His eyes are looking at me in an adoring fashion, there's the tiniest quiver at one corner of lips, and his head is slightly tilted to the left. It makes me feel like I'm a little girl with her arm in a cast sitting beside him in the hospital all over again. \"Can I tell you a secret, Alexandria?\" He asks softly. I beam at him, I know he remembers too. \"You know I'll always keep your secrets, even when they torture me with needles.\" I say dramatically. He sighs again and nods. \"To be honest, I think the real reason I'm not working behind the camera yet is because of you. I've had this absurd little dream that you might happen to see me in one of the pictures. Even though you're not supposed to see me, they always try to cover me up as the star of the show. But I liked to hope that you'd seen me, just for that split second, and then you might remember me.\" \"I...I could never forget you.\" I stammer out. I'm stunned, his secret is so genuine and beautiful, and it's strange that I've been going to the pictures all through my childhood just to see him and now to find out that's what he wanted. It's like we never did miss each other these past ten years. \"And I guess now you have permission to retire, because I've seen your pictures.\" I add as a joke because he's watching me with such joy that I'm sure it'll give me a heart attack. Thankfully it works and he bows his head as he chuckles. \"What are you doing here?\" He asks lifting his eyes to me again after a small pause. \"You just emerge back into my life after ten years. Why?\" I lean forward and point to where my name is written on the title page. \"It says by Alexandria Carmen, but it's not just my story. I have an appointment with a book publisher tomorrow, but I wanted to try and find you before then. I want your name credited as writer as well.\" \"You want me to become a writer?\" He asks as if I'm half-mad. \"Well, I did just say you could retire from stunt acting.\" I joke. \"In all seriousness though, I've already written up the book, I spent the last two years doing so. But I want the book credited as being a joint partnership if it's published, written by both of us. After all you did come up with the story, I just typed it up.\" \"I came up with most of it. You are part of the story too.\" He reminds me. \"True. But it was probably for the best, your ending will not sell copies.\" I retort playfully. He smiles. \"I'm glad you changed the ending.\" His mouth is left open; as if he means to say something more, but then he shuts it firmly closed. I understand nonetheless. If I hadn't changed the ending of the story for him, he would have ended himself with it as well. I might have become a little girl with a broken soul like the one he'd had, because I'd lost my friend. We sit there in silence, completely at ease with each other, for a few seconds. Suddenly the ring of a bell concludes an end to our conversation. All at once the many cast and crew members that surround us stand, bin any remaining food and start slowly filing their way through the large double doors into Studio eight. \"Ah.\" Roy sighs in annoyance as he looks around at the masses of people leaving, but he makes no quick attempt to stand. Instead he gazes over at me, the intent watch in his face again. \"Come with me.\" \"What?\" I gasp. \"Come back with me to the studio, I'll find you a place to watch until I'm finished.\" \"Are...are we allowed to do that?\" I stammer. \"Ah, I've been working for them long enough, they won't mind so long as you behave yourself. Can you do that for once?\" He says, giving me the eye. \"No stealing anything, you got it.\" I say and smile. I know he remembers how mischievous I was as a child. We get up together and push through the crowd to where Billson waits by the cart. \"Miss Carmen will accompany me into the studio.\" Roy explains. Billson gives a suspicious look between the both of us but says noting. He gets into the cart a drives away. Roy turns to me and smiles. He slips his hand into mine and leads me in the direction of the others through the doors of the studio. Somehow holding his hand is the best thing yet since I found him again. It a wonderful feeling to know that he's physically back in my life again. So that's the first chapter. Please tell me what you think. I'd like to thank ICanSeeYourFace for her beautiful fanfiction 'Where I Keep My Strength' which partly inspired me to write this in the first place. It's definitely worth checking out if you haven't read it yet. Notes: I don't usually write in present tense, but seeing as this is from Alexandria's point of view I want readers to feel like their travelling with Alexandria through the story, not knowing what's going to happen etc. Please forgive if I occasionally slip back in past tense. Furthermore I'm actually from England, but again as this is Alexandria's POV she'd use American-English, which I don't, so apologies if I ever use the wrong word or spelling. I read over all my stories, but I might miss some mistakes some time, hopefully it's not too obvious or distracting if there are any. I don't believe Alexandria's age is ever specified in the film, but Catinca Untaru who played Alexandria was born in 1997 and film was realised in 2006, so I estimate that she was about eight years when the film was shot, so I made Alexandria the same age for the events in The Fall. Well I think that's about everything. Please review, I need some advice seeing as this is just the first chapter and I haven't been a fan of the film for long, so any comments are very much welcomed. Thanks for reading, I'll have the next chapter up as soon as possible.[Chapter 2] Roy leads me quietly along one side of a large concrete room. I can tell it's large but the height of the roof and length of the walls but I see little of what is in the center of the room, which is mostly blocked by the back of large sheets of card stabled onto wooden beams. There are fold up chairs and very complex and expensive looking equipment scattered around the place but I only catch glimpses of them as Roy guides me through the labyrinth of things. He ushers me through a side door and up a double-flighted staircase, flanked by the small gray concrete wall on each side. Eventually we reach a small door with a wooden sign on it reading 'Lighting Room'. Roy knocks briskly on the door twice and drops my hand before entering. \"John?\" He asks, poking his head round the door. \"Roy? What are you doing up here? Not that I'm not happy to see you, but don't they want you on set? You're going to be late you know.\" An older gentleman with a stiff stand but a kind face remarked. \"I know, but I was doing if you could do me a favour?\" He explains and beckons me in. I creep fully into the room and glance around shyly. It's a small room with concrete walls like the rest of the place. At one wall there are two large windows, a bit like the ones in the security office I was in this morning, I cautiously cross over to the window and peer out. It looks over the studio, from here I can see down into the mass of paper paintings strung up to create a set, all the people milling about rehearsing or setting up equipment. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before. \"John, meet Alexandria. Alexandria, meet my friend and colleague, John.\" Roy says, gesturing to each of us in turn. I put my attention on the man properly for the first time and it suddenly hits me that I've seen him before, I could say I've even met him. He's the pirate. Well he's not actually a pirate, I know that now, but sometimes he was a pirate, and I remember when he was a cowboy in the same flicker that brought Roy to me. The one legged stunt performer. For a moment I'm confused. Shouldn't he be working in front of the camera with Roy than in this tiny room? Then I realise he must be retired from stunt work now, its ten years and the burden of age must have come upon him, he's still working in Hollywood but now it's behind the camera. I try to remember his appearance in the hospital as I look at him, but it's an old memory. The moustache is the same, except that it now has many flecks of gray in it, as with his hair. He walks with a large swing on one leg, indicating the fake attachment at the stump of his knee is still there. He wears a causal buttoned-up shirt and brown trousers fixed with a belt, much alike the other two workers in the room who thankfully appear friendlier than the majority of the security guards this morning. \"How do you do, Miss.\" John says sticking out his hand to me. He glances away from me and looks to Roy as he speaks with a suggestive gaze in his eyes. I take his hand and shake, he has a firm grip. \"Alexandria, why don't you go sit down over by the window?\" Roy asks. The phrasing of the question makes him sound like a parent trying to get their young child to behave themselves. Usually I don't do what I'm told, especially when someone asks me like I'm a little baby. But I do not refuse Roy. I obediently walk back over to the window and sit down on one of the several rows of benches that face out to the studio. \"Could she stay here for the afternoon, just until I finish?\" I can hear Roy ask behind me. \"You have a lady-friend?\" John whispers in reply. I try to make it look like I'm watching what's going on past the window, I'm clearly not meant to be listening to this. That doesn't mean I don't. \"Cut it, John. Please? I have to go.\" I hear a sigh. \"Alright, but just for this afternoon, as soon as the shoot's done she's got to be out of here.\" \"Take her down to the shacks when it's over. Thanks John.\" Roy replies quickly and apparently cuts the conversation before John has time to reply. \"Hey.\" Roy says as he sits down next to me quickly and looks at me. \"Hello again.\" I reply, turning my head away from the window and looking at him with a smile. \"Listen, I really need to go. But John will take you out of the studio once we're done for the day. Can you wait in here for me?\" \"Sure.\" I reply. \"You behave yourself now.\" His teases and taps my nose. \"Honestly, I'm not a little girl anymore. I can behave myself.\" I say, cheekily. A very broad smile spreads across his face. \"Alright, I'll see you later. I'll take you out to dinner.\" I'm speechless, I suppose that's not a very big thing to go out to dinner in Hollywood, but I've never had anyone take me out to dinner before. \"Alright.\" He assures both me and himself as he stands and begins to walk backwards for the door. He takes one last glance at me, and I can see that adoring look in his eyes again, before he backs out the door and practically jumps down the stairs. I feel rather guilty as it's clear I've made him so late. For the entirety of the afternoon I watch from the Lighting Room as Roy does take after take of fighting off a group of bandits, all of them dressed in ridiculous Roman costumes. Throughout my childhood I'd never really considered the outfits Roy wore in all his films, but now that I see him dressed like that in real life I realise how silly they always make him look. When filming with the group of bandits is done, the set is changed around quickly. I can see Roy as he stands while someone fiddles about with his hair and make-up. He looks up to the room where I am and smiles, I don't know if he can see me through the thick glass window, but I smile back. When set has been altered the real hard stuff begins. I watch as Roy and a number of other stunt men charge at an entire army, again and again. Then he takes a break as what I assume are the stars of the show repeat and charge into the battle, but this time the cameras are only interested in their faces. Meanwhile the tasks that the people in the lighting room undertake become obvious to me. The room is filled with panels of buttons and switches around the room. They receive instructions through a microphone standing on one of the panels, and ferry answers back to the people in the studio. The room controls all the lights strung up in the studio. As I look around I realise just how many there are, countless bulbs on the roof, walls and set up on the floor, all connected by wires. Workers come in and out of the room all afternoon. Carrying clipboards and playing about with all the controls. Mostly it's the three men who were here when I came in. But I sit quietly and stay out of trouble in case a newcomer should enter. Later in the afternoon one of the workers comes in carrying a tray of teas and coffees and Pirate John, as I decide to call him, brings a cup to me. He sits it down beside me on the bench which I obediently haven't moved from all this time. He lets out a sigh. \"I'm glad you're here. It gives me an excuse to stop for a moment.\" I ask him to sit beside me and he does, I can see he's thankful to have a chance to. \"You used to do stunt work like Roy.\" I tell him after taking a sip of my tea. I mean it as a fact, much the same way I once told that actor who was in the same film as Roy that he was 'Someone Famous', because I remember it and know it to be true. But he takes it as a question. \"Yes, yes. But age caught up with me.\" He says and touches his fake leg with a thoughtful fondness. \"But Roy on the other hand, well that man seems ageless.\" I smile and nod in reply. \"Do you see Roy often?\" He asks. I glance up at him. \"Only this morning.\" I reply. That's true, because otherwise, I haven't seen him for ten years. Pirate John stares curiously at me and pauses for a moment. \"I'm not sure if I should admit this to you, miss. But Roy, well he doesn't do women. I mean I don't ever see him with a woman, in the studio or out. I want him to find a girl, and I want him to be happy but he hasn't cared about women for years.\" I look away shyly. He doesn't know who I am. And why should he? But I can't even begin to explain the relationship between Roy and I. If someone was to ask me if I love Roy, the answer is yes without thought. But it's not the love that a woman has for a man, nor is it the love you have for a very good friend. It's deep, it's understanding, I care for Roy. Even though he's been absent from my life for ten long years, it doesn't matter. I'm ready to die for him without question. That is how I love Roy. I know it sounds strange if I try to explain that to anyone, but it's so simple in my mind. \"I'm sorry to hear that.\" I finally answer. \"But today is the first time I've seen Roy in ten years.\" \"You do look very young.\" He says, narrowing his eyes at me. \"I'm eighteen since three months ago.\" I reply. His eyes widen. \"You're the little girl that used to visit him when he was in the hospital after his first stunt.\" I nod enthusiastically. \"Does he talk about me?\" \"He speaks very fondly and very often of a girl he refers to as his 'Little Bandit'. He holds you to account that he is alive today. I remember him in those days in the hospital, he'd lost his legs, and he'd lost his love. He had barely any will to live left in him.\" I put my cup down and stand in front of the window to avoid showing how much I'm shaking. A feeling of joy overwhelms me as I learn that Roy has remembered me all these years after. Who else would he ever call a Little Bandit? I smile gently as I think on the nickname. \"I saved him.\" I mumble softly, more to myself. How ironic, Roy had tricked me into helping to his end, yet ultimately I had saved him. \"I dare say you did.\" John replies. I turn back to the bench and sit down again and take another sip of my tea. \"Thank you.\" He chuckles. \"Thank you I should say, miss. Roy is one of our best stuntmen, let alone one of my own best pals.\" He drinks the last of his tea and then stands up. \"Well I need to be getting on. Duty calls.\" I raise the hand that holds my cup of tea as a gesture of goodbye and he goes back to work. When the afternoon becomes late the studio finishes for the day. Roy is pulled off the set with the masses of other actors, extras and stunt performers. Soon after Pirate John asks me to follow him and we leave the lighting room as the two other workers being to shut off some of the lights. We walk down the double-flighted staircase but instead of going into the studio I'm led through another door facing the stairs and along twisting and turning corridors, all with white painted walls over concrete gray, the passageways appear as a maze to me. At last we exist through another door and we're outside on a shorter road that's baking in the lukewarm late afternoon weather. Facing me across the small strip of road, which appears to be lining the right side of the studio eight building from where I entered earlier, there is a collection of small hut-like buildings and very grand looking caravan trailers. Pirate John leads me across the road and dives into the trailer park, which again appears like a maze to my eyes. This whole studio is a labyrinth with hundreds of smaller mazes inside itself. \"We call this area the shacks.\" John explains to me as we walk. \"It's where all the cast get changed and have their make-up removed at the end of the day. I simply nod in reply as I currently have all concentration on remembering where we've come from and how I will find my way out of this place. \"Here we are.\" John says as we reach a certain one of the huts, only one floor and made of white painted wood with no windows. There is carved bench sitting along one side near the open door, but all I can see is wall facing the entrance that must lead to somewhere. \"I must be going now.\" John tells me. \"But you can wait here. I expect Roy will be out before too long, he'll want to see you.\" \"Thank you, for everything.\" I reply. He shows a smile and understanding nod on his worn face. \"It was my pleasure, miss, thank you.\" And with that he turns swiftly and strides off in the direction we came. I turn and look around at my surroundings, now and again there are people milling about or going places, but they pay no attention to me. Going over to the wooden bench I lower myself onto it and wait, I take out my novel and skim through the pages, looking like I'm actually doing something. What must be only a minute or so seems to slide by; I sit in anticipation, waiting for Roy. The usually raucous studio seems abnormally quiet, everybody seems to vanish from my presence, I'm half expecting tumbleweed to roll past me at any second, to hear a far off eagles cry; the only sound for miles. No that's just my imagination getting the better of my again. After about ten minutes of this unbearable waiting I have the feeling I'm being watched. I glance up from my sheets of paper and look to my left. There stands Roy. I jump up and pull him into an embrace without saying a word. There's something very comforting about holding Roy close to me, something that cannot be said through speech. Even his smell and the tiniest sound of his breathing is a promise to me. As I finally move away I notice he's changed. He wears a pair of black brogue shoes and brown pants, there's a jacket slung over his open arm and his white button-up shirt reminds me of the same one he used to wear every day in the hospital. Roy walks me out of the large studio entrance along the sidewalk; it feels strange to have him beside me, playing the girl leaning on a guy's arm, I've never had a boy offer that to me before. But at the same time it feels so comfortable, so right. We both seem to float along together into town instead of walking. He takes me out to dinner, something else I'm not used to, it's a little friendly Italian on one of the many Los Angeles, but says this one is his favourite. We talk our way through starters, the main course, and desert, and all the waiting gaps in between. I tell him all about home, and my family, and growing up. He doesn't like to linger on his own history these past ten years; apparently little has changed for him in these years. But he does share funny stories of everything he's seen while working; telling me the details of what goes on before the picture hits the silver screen. We finished our deserts over an hour and our coffee cups are now empty. I suddenly come to the realisation that we are the only customers left in the restaurant, and most of the waiters have gone home too. The hour is late. Roy sees me glance around and smiles. \"Shall we call it a night?\" He asks. I look back at him and sigh. \"I don't want to.\" I tell him honestly. Then my head jerks up as I remember something, my head now buzzing with excitement, the slight tiredness has all but faded away. \"But there's one thing first.\" I explain. I open up my bag and pull the leather bound pages and place it neatly between us. \"Do we have a deal then, Mr Walker?\" I ask. \"It is our story after all.\" He smirks, but I think I see a hint of sadness in him too. \"I don't want our story to end.\" He tells me. I smile at him and reach out to take his hand as it lies resting on the table. His hand it mine feels as much as a comfort to me to as I hope it is to him. \"Make this partnership with me and it doesn't have to be.\" I say softly. He sighs and gives a shrug; I can tell he's given in to defeat. \"Have it your way, Alexandria, you always did.\" A genuine and wide smile spreads across my face, showing my white teeth beneath my fading lipstick. I can't believe he's agreed. I take a fountain pen out of my bag, my best pen, and begin to write in my elegant hand on the title page. I'm not so happy when I've finished because my hand was shaking so much as I wrote. But as I let the ink dry I'm satisfied in the knowledge that these black markings on a white crisp sheet could ensure the friendship Roy and I for a long time. The title page now reads: The Adventures of the Masked Bandit A Novel By Alexandria Carmen and Roy Walker With our business now complete we pay our bill, much to the relief of the tired waitress, and leave the restaurant. \"Do you have somewhere to stay the night?\" Roy asks me outside on the sidewalk. \"I figured I'd walk along the boulevard till I find an open hotel.\" I explain. I'll admit that I'm city girl. I've only ever been to the outskirts of Los Angles before. Our family rarely has need for anything from the city, and if there is need my mother always sends Gabriel as she's the eldest. He smiles, but I'm pretty sure he's hiding concern. \"I have a spare bedroom in my apartment. It's only a short walk from here.\" \"I wouldn't want to intrude.\" I say shyly. He steps a little closer to me and looks kindly at me. I'm not afraid. \"You never have.\" He tells me with all honesty. I believe him and offer my arm for him to take. \"Thank you.\" \"Don't mention it.\" He replies with a wink as he loops his arm in mine and places a caring hand on it. When Roy unlocks the door to his apartment we are greeted by scratching and sharp cries from a small fluffy creature at our feet. \"Alex! Down girl.\" Roy shouts as the little dog tries to push at us. \"I'm sorry that you're hungry but we have guest with us.\" She's gives up at her master's presence and sneaks back to a basket beside a coach in front of the window. We are now free to get through the door without hassle. I take in my surroundings, Roy's apartment is of a decent enough size. The kitchen, dining room and lounge are all in one room, there are three doors on the right side of the room. It is a comfy space, if not a little empty. The walls are plain white, but the lounge carpet is a bright and soft red which brings some colour to the room. I turn to look out the wide window, lights from the block facing us across the street are reflecting back in the glass. Then my gaze turns to the dog basket below where the little white and brow creature sits staring back at me as if to ask; who are you, stranger? \"You had a dog before.\" I say and turn to Roy. He's standing in the kitchen area, removing his coat and hanging it over a chair. \"Umm, yeah. Bobby died about three years ago.\" He replies. \"I'm sorry.\" I say as I make myself at home by shrugging off my coat and shawl and flinging them over another chair like Roy. \"It's alright. I got Alex almost immediately after, she's a Beagle, I've been raising her from a pup.\" \"Alex?\" I ask, raising an eyebrow at him. He gives an embarrassed look at me. \"After a memory, I used to know a girl with a similar name. Alex has an attitude to match her too. She's giving it to me right now because I'm never home this late too feed her.\" \"It seems I've got you into some trouble.\" I smirk as I lean against one wall, arms folded and surveying the dog glaring at both of us. \"It wouldn't be the first time.\" Roy replies with cheek as he walks past me, a bowl full of dog food in his hands. \"Here you go, girl.\" He says fondly as he places the bowl down by Alex's basket. She gives a small yap, clearly happy to get what she wants at last, and with that tucks into her dinner. \"I'll show you your room.\" Roy says, standing up after giving Alex a soft pat on her head. I fetch my coat, shawl and bag and he leads me over to the door on the left side of the far wall and opens it. The room inside is small and fairly basic, white wallpaper decorated with fine blue lines adorns the room. There's a single bed with thick bed-sheets and a wardrobe in a corner beside the door. There are no windows on this side of the apartment. \"The bathroom is right next-door, between this room and mine. You think you'll be comfortable here?\" Roy asks, leaning on the doorframe as I stand in the room and gaze around. I say nothing, but without thinking turn and pull him into an embrace. He seems startled by my sudden actions at first but relaxes into the hug. \"Why are you so wonderful?\" I whisper into his shirt. I don't know why this feeling came over me suddenly, most of the time nowadays I act professional and straightforward, but Roy turns me into something different. It's his simple gestures of kindness that tell me there's no one I've met quite like him, and that I must keep him. \"Only for you, Alexandria.\" He replies, I can tell his usual sweet smile is on his face, even though I'm not looking at it. \"I'll leave you too it.\" He adds after we've pulled away. I nod and set about arranging my things in my room. My room? Is it strange that I'm already thinking of it that way instead of being 'The spare room in Roy's apartment'? I've packed very little for my journey. Growing up with a very basic farming lifestyle means that I travel light. I can wear a nightgown underneath my skirt and blouse, and my toothbrush and makeup can all be kept in a small overnight bag in my satchel. When I'm all ready for bed I find myself standing outside the door of the only room in the apartment I haven't entered yet. Roy's room. I glance around, Alex is already tucked up under a blanket in her basket. Everything is still. For some reason the thought of knocking seems slightly ill to me. What's wrong with me? But it's only polite so do before entering. Roy's room is more spacious than mine, with a large window alike the one in the lounge facing out on the same view. The wallpaper is covered in geometric swirls. His single bed has a red blanket covered over the white sheets. A wardrobe stands neatly along one side of wall, facing the window, and at the window sits an elegant desk with a small chair in front. \"Hello.\" I smile at Roy; he's sitting on his bed dressed in pyjamas. This view sets me back to the time when I was a child, and Roy used to have to sit like this all day long. Despite all the years between then and now, and the complete change of location, I'm dressed in a nightgown alike the dresses I used to wear as a child and Roy hasn't changed at all. From my point of view we're just the same as we always were. \"I wanted to give this to you.\" I say, walking into the room and holding out our story pressed between the brown leather file. \"I thought you might like it for the night.\" \"Thank you.\" He replies sincerely as he took it from my hands. \"Will you read it to me?\" He asks. I stare. \"You want me to read it to you?\" I ask in shock. \"Please?\" He requests, staring back at me, his eyes sparkle with that adoration I've only seen when they look at me. I let out a soft and calm sigh and take the leather file back from his hands and sit down next to him on the bed, swinging my legs over his and resting my head back against the pillow. If anyone were to see us now it would probably be weird, but for me it's natural. This is the way I always used to sit with Roy, a broken soul in a hospital bed, many things have changed but our funny relationship is the same to me as it was then. I open the pages and begin to read our story, the story of the masked bandit. These words that Roy once spoke to me all those years ago, never forgotten, are now perfectly preserved on these white sheets of paper for both of us, and perhaps for the whole world too? I read and read, word after word, page after page, and time passes us by though I don't notice. Roy doesn't interrupt me; he just sits listening to my voice, a smile appearing on his face occasionally when I read a part he likes or a part he'd forgotten. Eventually though, I notice the tiredness come into his face and later his eyes begin to flutter. I continue reading, I'm not sure for how long, but ultimately my voice stops and I close the pages. Roy does not protest, he's still awake but his eyes are already shut. I stand and place the closed file beside him on the bed-sheets. Without even having to think, I lean down and bestow a kiss on his forehead, only a small one, a peck of endearment, just like the ones I used to give as a child. \"Goodnight Roy.\" I whisper. He mumbles something in reply. A warm smile spreads across my face as I sneak out the door. So there's the second chapter up. Sorry, it took longer than I would have wanted. First of all, thank you to every single one of you who have favourited/followed this story, but especially those that were kind enough to take your time to review, it really helps. ICanSeeYourFace, lezares77, Keiko-kohai and Z, you're all stars! This story is Roy/Alexandria paring, and will eventually end up that way, but that's not going to happen for a while, I'd like to focus on their wonderful relationship as a friendship for the time being. Finally, I need to apologise but life's a bit heavy for me right now, so I can't be sure how often I can continue this story. By all means I will be continuing it, but the chapters are very long and so take a long time to write. I will be updating but it may have to be over long periods of time rather than as regularly as I'd like. I'm deeply sorry for this, it annoys me too. Please review and tell me what you've thought of this chapter. You're help and support is a blessing to any writer. Thanks and Goodbye.[Chapter 3] A little sneak peak at the next chapter...I'm horrible, I know. Let me know if you're still interested in reading more. I'm debating writing a draft or something to explain how the rest of this story goes, because sadly I simply cannot do both this gorgeous, descriptive writing style combined with the quantity of the chapters, which is longer than anything I usually write. I'm driving myself crazy here! Even away from home my body clock does not stop. I wake while it's still dark outside, as I usually do at home. Even as a little girl I was the one that was up before everyone else, nowadays I put it to good use, making my rounds in the grove as the dawn breaks. Here in the city however there's a mechanical stillness to the air, the dawn is blocked out by the orange glow from all the city lights. Still I sit at the windowsill trying to make out the slow change of the sky piercing through the neon blaze of Los Angles with Alex the dog curled up at my feet in her basket. When it's clear the light is finally brightening I think about making breakfast, it's the least I can do since Roy let me stay here overnight. If I had it my way I'd do a full cooked with eggs, and beacon and tomatoes, but when I examine the little kitchen in the apartment I find a gigantic modern cooker with a vast number of dials and knobs used to operate which makes our little stove back home look very pathetic. I suppose that's how they do everything here in the city, always thinking to the maximum. I on the other hand can't even begin to work out how to work the thing, and so deciding it's better to take a simpler alternative than set the block on fire, which wouldn't be a very gracious thank you to Roy, I pop several pieces of bread in the toaster and decorate them in various colors using different flavoured spreads. ","Summary":" A couple of weeks ago I saw the film The Fall for the first time after hearing loads about it (most"},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"Summer sun and Oranges","Author":"Sayonarasolo","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10268537","Passage":"[Chapter 1] When she was brought back in, she was as pale as the sheets around her, her eyes still squeezed tightly shut. They had laid her on her front for the procedure, and her hands were curled up tightly under her chin. He could see from her stillness that this was the numb sleep that chloroform brings; she never stirred, and her breaths were shallow, slow things. As the night passed however, she began to twitch and stir in her sleep- a sign, Roy knew, that she now slept free from the influence of the drugs. Eventually, as he watched her in the moonlit room, she opened her eyes. They glinted dully in the gloom, not really focussing on anything. After a few slow blinks, they closed again, and she slept once more. Sunlight was now pouring through the windows, and the shouts and crashes of the front courtyard could be heard through the window, along with the soft footsteps of the nurses and the hushed whisperings of the doctors. Across the room, another patient sat, reading a newspaper, the rustling of the pages the only noise originating from within the room itself. Eve opened her eyes, still lying stiffly on her front. She moved her fingers, which were still clasped under her chin, and sticky with sweat from being clutched together all night in the hazy heat of the summer. Waking up a little more, she looked across at Roy, who was sitting up in his bed, he eyes closed, and his head leant back, as he often sat in the morning. \"Roy?\" she said, her voice husky and rough. His eyes opened swiftly, and he sat up a little to look at her. \"Good morning… how are you feeling?\" he asked, concern obvious in his eyes. \"Terrible\" she replied with a tiny smile. Roy returned it with warmth, only now realising how worried he had been for her about the surgery. However, their conversation was interrupted, as a group of grim faced doctors strode into the wardroom. \"Miss? May we talk to you for a moment?\" \"Of course, doctor\" she said, and with that they pulled the curtain around her, blocking his view. As Roy turned away from their hushed voices, the nurse came to dress him and to change his bed covers, which meant he was moved into a wheelchair by a orderly. Roy still resented his disability. It made him feel both useless and helpless, and served as a constant reminder of past happenings he would much rather forget. As he waited for the doctors to finish their consultation with Eve, he opened his bedside cupboard, and fished out the drawing Alexandria had given him. He considered it for a while with a wry smile on his face, only putting it away when he heard the swish of the curtain as the doctors left Eve's bedside. As he pulled himself over to sit next to her bed, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, he looked up at her, and saw that tears were falling from her eyes. Grabbing her hand, he looked at her pleadingly, knowing what must have happened, but at the same time hoping he was wrong. \"Eve?\" \"It didn't work.\" She croaked, the tears falling in floods as she refused to look at him. \"They couldn't do anything\" Roy felt a tear leave his own eye, and brought her hand to his lips. \"I'm so sorry\" he murmured, he voice cracking as he said it. He had wanted so badly for this to go well for her. \"It… It was all for nothing\" She had begun to tremble now, the pillow soaked through with her tears. Red dots of bloods began to appear and spread down the back of her white hospital gown as her shuddering sobs caused the operation wound to open again. Roy, tears falling, laid his head next to hers on the pillow, holding her hand against his cheek. They were so close their noses were almost touching, and she looked at him with eyes brimming with disappointment and frustration. \"Why did this happen to us Roy? What did we do to end up here?\" She said angrily. \"I don't know,\" he murmured in reply.\" I don't know.\" Days passed, but little was said on the ward. Every day Roy sat in his chair next to Eve's bed, holding her hand in his, and they would stay like that for the whole day, lost in their own thoughts. Occasionally Roy would pause to play absentmindedly with her fingers, or her with his, but it wasn't until a week or so later Eve spoke properly to him. It was night again, and Roy was woken by Eve, who was sat up in her bed, the bedside lamp casting a dim yellow light across the room. \"What is it?\" He said, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \"Will you… I mean can you come over here?\" Her face was turned away from the lamp, shadowed, which meant Roy could not see her expression \"Why?\" He said cautiously, one hand kneading the back of his neck. \"Its nothing vital, just, will you please?\" Somehow Roy managed to wrestle his way into the wheelchair the nurse had left next to his bed, and wearily pulled himself across to her cot. \" What?\" He said, still looking at her as he leant over and adjusted the lamp so he could see her face more clearly. \" Will you pull out my stitches for me?\" \"Shouldn't the doctor do that?\" he said cautiously, leaning his head on one side to look questioningly at her. \" I asked, but they said they wouldn't for another week\" \"Well then, you should leave them in\" Roy reasoned, taking her hand in his, and wrapping it up in his large palm. \"No. They itch and stop me from sleeping. Please Roy, I promise not to tell them you helped me.\" Roy looked up at her, considering for a moment, idly intertwining his fingers with hers. Although nothing was yet to be said outright, there was an unspoken affection between them, and she looked at him with real trust in her eyes. \"Undo the back of your gown,\" he said, at last. She turned her back to him and did. For the first time Roy saw the long line of black stitches running down her spine from the top of her neck to the small of her back. The stitches looked angry and red, but the incision itself was obviously healing well. However, it was still so huge a cut that Roy had to suppress a gasp of surprise: he was glad she was turned and could not see his expression. She silently passed him a pair of tweezers, and he gingerly reached up, laying his warm left hand alongside the line of stitches between her shoulder blades, before gently pulling at one protruding knotted end of a stitch with the tweezers in his right hand. Roy could feel her back tense under his fingers as he did so, and as the stitches gradually pulled away from the skin he felt her flinch away from the pain. Releasing the piece of thread to fall to the floor, he moved his hand on her back slightly, adjusted his grip on the tweezers, and set to the long, delicate task of removing the stitches one by one. As the dim light of morning filled the room Eve still sat up on her bed, her back still bare, but now free of the stitches, which lay scattered on the floor around her. The incision was still closed, and although a couple of the holes from the stitches leaked blood in trails down her back, she felt much better. Roy was asleep in his chair next to her, his head on his chest, and her hand still clutched in his. As she heard the nurses beginning their rounds she gently lay down on her bed, tucked her gown around her to cover her back and turned to face Roy. She looked at him for a while with her grey eyes, before closing them softly and drifting into sleep to the sounds of the hospital waking up around them. For the next few days Eve gradually recovered from her operation. As the swelling reduced and the pain receded she eventually could stand and take a few small, halting steps, but she still limped from the curved spine that the operation had failed to fix. Roy watched her encouragingly as the nurses helped her hobble from one end of the ward to the other, but it was clear that the pain that came with it was still just as much there as it had been before the operation. She hid it well, too proud and too stubborn to let the pain walking and standing caused her show, but when she sat back onto her bed afterwards she was always paler and looked strained by the effort. As the summer carried on the weather grew hotter, and soon the temperature in the wards was stifling, enough so that the nurses decided to take some of the patients out into the neighbouring orange plantations for the morning and afternoons, although in the heat of the midday sun it was decided best for the patients to stay inside. The nurse would push Roy out in his chair, and Eve would walk more slowly behind, aided by another nurse as she took tentative steps away from the hospital and own the groves. On this particular occasion the nurse decided that it would be okay to leave them by themselves for a while, a little way off from the others, although she told Roy strictly to make sure Eve stayed in the shade of the parasol she gave them. Although Roy and Eve didn't know, they were a subject of much gossip among the nurses, who for nuns had an intense interest in the various relationships about the hospital. In Roy and Eves case there was much speculation about the pair, and constant debate about their possible futures. However, at this moment, and probably to their happy advantage, Roy and Eve were unaware of this. In the bright midday sun Eve stretched out a sheet she had brought with her on the dry grass, and exhausted, sat down on it, leaning the large white parasol on her shoulder. Feeling cheered by the outside air, Roy half lifted himself, half fell, from his chair on to the sheet to sit next to her, and they sat there squinting at each other in the sun. To anyone who walked in on them they would have looked like any normal couple that had stopped in the orange orchard for a picnic. \"Would you mind pulling my shoes off?\" Roy asked, and Eve did so for him, carefully unlacing them and easing them off, even though she knew Roy couldn't feel his feet and legs. She held the shoes in her lap for a moment, before gently setting them down of the grass next to her. Sighing, Eve let the parasol fall back and tilted her freckled face up to the sun; her wavy brown hair straying out from underneath the straw hat the nurse had forced her to wear. Her dress, which was white with tiny red flowers on it, rippled slightly in the breeze, revealing her long white socks and the schoolgirl-like brown shoes she wore. Roy, looking at her and smiling, gently reached around her and pulled the parasol up to shade her face, which was already going red from the sun. She opened her eyes and frowned as him, before gingerly lying back onto the sheet, holding the parasol high above her so she could still see Roy, who then leant back to lie next to her. Eve then leant the parasol on the ground behind their heads, so they were left in a little private tent of half shade together. Looking up at the patterns embroidered on the parasol that could be seen as the sun shone through the white cotton, she said \" Is it true you tell good stories, Roy?\" He turned and looked at her, slightly startled by the question, before taking her hand again and replying with a slow, drawn out \"Yes…\" He then paused, before adding-\"well, at least, I told one once.\" \"What was it?\" He smiled, looking down at the lines of trees they could see from under the edge of the parasol, his long eyelashes brushing his cheeks. \" I'm not going to tell the same story twice.\" \"Will you tell me a different one then?\" She asked, looking across at him again. \"I'll think about it\" He replied, looking up to meet her gaze. In his hand he held a daisy he had picked from nearby, and he tucked it behind her ear, his fingers lingering in her hair. Eve grinned at him as he gently tugged at one curl. \"Always so mysterious\" She said, before turning her head to gaze up at the white roof of the parasol again. Roy was still preoccupied with her stray curl, tucking it behind her ear and then untucking it again. She looked at his face, as he focussed on her hair, before saying to him \"I've never been so happy to be outside in the sun.\" Roy's eyes looked up to meet hers, and he said \" It's been a long time since I've been outside… and since I've been as happy as I am here- with you.\" Eve looked back and him seriously, her hand reaching across to touch his forearm. They lay there for a long while, simply looking at each other, the sounds of the hospital children playing and the nurses giggling seeming distant to them, and for a beautiful moment they found they both could forget about their illnesses. It was as though, out here in the sun, they no longer mattered. Eventually, Roy brought his hand up and pulled off Eve's hat, setting it down on his legs before returning his hand to the back of her head, his fingers gently entwining in her hair, his eyes never leaving hers. Carefully, he pulled her head close to his and, closing his eyes, planted a soft kiss on her forehead. She leant against him, wrapping her arm around him and, feeling safer than ever in the soft white light under the parasol, gave a small kiss on the line of his jaw in return. He tucked her head under his chin, while his arms came around to hold her to him, and together they closed their eyes and took a short, restful and content nap, safe in each other's arms for the first time. The next day, the sun was even hotter. Inside the gloom of the ward a fly buzzed dully against the window as the nurses came to collect Roy and Eve to take them down to the plantations. It was about three o'clock in the afternoon, and the front yard was quiet for once as it was a Sunday. As they made there way through the orange trees, following the bunch of other patients and nurses ahead of them, Eve found she was able to keep up with the nurse pushing Roy's wheelchair for once, although it was tiring walking for everyone in the heat of the sun that day. Eventually the nurse left them, alone together as the day before, but this time with a jug of lemonade and some glasses and the stern warning to remember to drink, and again to Roy to make sure Eve stayed under the parasol. When she had gone Roy, this time with Eve's help, pulled himself out of the chair to sit with her on the sheet. He sat up; leaning with his arms behind him, and looked around them. They were just far enough into the trees that they could not see the hospital, just the long lines of trees, hung with oranges that gleamed like Christmas decorations. Eve, also eyeing the oranges, pulled herself up to stand, and, as Roy watched her with a slightly worried expression, tottered over to the neighbouring tree. She turned to look at him, and, dropping the parasol to the floor, asked \"would you like an orange?\" \"Technically, I think that counts as stealing\" he said wryly, holding his hand up at his brow to shield the sun from his eyes. Eve smiled at him in return. \"Well, would you like one?\" Giving in, Roy replied with a \"yes\", although he shook his head as he said it. Eve often acted like this, playful and almost childish- especially outside in the summer sun. However, as she reached above her head for the oranges, Roy saw and heard her back click. Eve froze, her fingers curling into a tight fist, the only indication that she was in pain. Panicked, his eyes wide, Roy wished he could go to her, but of course he could not stand. \"Eve? Are you okay?\" he asked, the worry plain to hear in her voice. \"Yes.\" was her shaky but determined reply, and slowly, every so slowly, she began to move, bringing her arm back down to her side, and gradually stepping back towards the blanket, keeping her back as straight as possible. Beads of perspiration had appeared on her forehead, and, as she looked at Roy, he could see in her eyes that she too was beginning to panic. Pulling himself closer to where she stood stiffly, he reached his strong arms up to her. \"I'm not sure I can sit,\" She said quietly. \"Its okay, I've got you\" Roy replied, trying to sound encouragingly. Eve was petite, small and short, and as Roy stretched his arms and body up towards her his hands were high enough to reach her waist. \"I'll help you\" \"Okay\" Eve replied, her lashes becoming wet as she bent her legs a little to sit. It was clear all this was causing her great pain. Suddenly she collapsed down into Roy's arms and onto his lap, her back and legs finally giving out under the strain of standing. Her tears were flowing fast now and she tried to hide them by nuzzling into Roy's shirt, but he could still feel the wetness through the fabric, and could feel her tremble against him as he cradled her. \"Shh, its okay now\" He said quietly, bringing up his hand to gently touch her back. She flinched away from the slightest touch, indicating just how delicate it had become. This kind of thing had happened often before; just as Eve seemed to be getting better her back would go again and she would come tumbling down. \"Is there anything I can do?\" he asked, looking down at her. Eve didn't meet his eyes. \"Just… give it a minute or two\" Now, as she calmed slightly, it became clear that the tremors weren't only her crying but also her back. A slight shudder was constant in her as the muscles tensed and untensed again, and they sat in silence and felt them together, Eve clutching Roy's shirt front tightly each time a particularly violent one occurred. Gradually however they subsided, until Eve was still in his arms, her breaths less shuddering as she listened to Roy's own slow breathing. After what seemed like an age, she gingerly tilted her head back to look up at him. \"Thank you, Roy.\" \"Its fine. Are you okay?\" \"I'm… a little better now. It still hurts but… I'm okay.\" Roy gave a small sigh of relief, unconsciously tightening his grip on her a little. \"If you sit forward a little I'll rub your shoulders\" This was something they did quite often after such an episode, as it left her muscles tightly tensed and knotted. She scooted forward, freeing her back so that Roy could reach it. As his large warm hands came to rest on her shoulders she herself sighed a little, and attempted to untense her back a little herself. Roy paused for a moment, and his hands left her shoulders to grab the discarded parasol, which he then gave to Eve. She wedged it so that her hands were free, and leant back a little into Roy's hands, which were quickly and easily relieving the lingering pain of her back like no-one else's could. When he was done they swapped places, and Eve was surprised to find the usually relaxed Roy also tensed. \"What's wrong?\" She asked, as her small hands worked away at his broad shoulders. \"Its nothing. I'm just worried about you. You should be more careful\" \"You know how much I hate being told that\" Eve said, but he could hear from her voice that she wasn't upset with him. In fact, a small smile was playing on her lips at his concern. \"I know. But I mean it\" He turned to look at her, his eyes serious. Eve returned his gaze. \"I know you do.\" Roy turned around fully, and took Eves hands in his. \"Neither of us are getting better,\" He said to her, looking back up to meet her eyes. \"No. But neither of us are getting worse either\" She said in reply, which gained her a wry smile from Roy. She was always more positive than Roy, who had a tendency to let his situation get him down. Eve knew vaguely from the nurse's gossip that he had once been in a very dark frame of mind, and attempted the unthinkable. Remembering this made her worry, and she leant towards her to catch his eye. \" Listen to me Roy. If these terrible things hadn't happened to both of us we never would have met. And although I will never be glad of my predicament, I wouldn't change a thing if it meant losing you.\" Roy's eyes met hers with surprise, and she continued. \"In fact, if the devil came to me now and asked me to choose between good health and you, There is no doubt in my mind what I would choose. It might not be the same for you, but I wanted you to know that… if anything were ever to happen to you… I'm not sure I would survive it.\" Roy's eyes still met her unwavering gaze, and he reached up slowly to cup her face in his hand. \"I feel the same. And I promise that… as far as I can control, nothing will happen to me\" It was now nighttime, and the only noise in the hospital was the sound of the rain falling outside, the drips and drops as it rolled off the roof sounding almost like murmuring voices in the otherwise still night. Roy twitched a little in his sleep, his fingers curling and uncurling against the sheets, before, sensing that something wasn't quite right; he opened his eyes in the gloom. He looked around, seeing the sleeping forms of his roommates under their covers. All were there except for Eve- her bed lay empty, the sheets twisted as though she had been sleeping uneasily. Sitting up in his cot, Roy deliberated for a moment before pulling the wheelchair to him. As he eased himself out of the bed and into the chair he paused for a moment, thinking that he heard voices outside of the room. After a moment sitting with his head cocked he could hear no further noise except from the pitter-patter of the rain, and so he moved across the room and edged through to the doorway. There he could see Eve leaning on the doorframe, facing the sheet of rainwater that fell in front of her. The night was humid, and the light of the stars and moon was bright, casting a silvery glow over the rows of orange trees. Stopping there, Roy observed her as she stood, unaware of his presence, gazing across the plantation she'd come to know the past few weeks. Eventually however she felt his eyes on her, and turned to look at him, a sad smile on her face. He returned it, his expression pensive in the dim moonlight. He opened his arms invitingly, and Eve turned away from the doorway and came to sit sideways across his lap, her head resting on his chest as he absentmindedly stroked her hair, still gazing across the dark plantation. \"Something wrong?\" he asked quietly. \"No, just…missing home I guess… Although I kind of like it here now too.\" Eve sounded a little confused. She didn't live all that far from here, but she felt disconnected from the outside world here. However, she also felt safe here, and more importantly, Roy was here with her. \"I miss home too, sometimes\" said Roy. \"Eve?\" \"Yes Roy?\" \"Yesterday evening the doctor came to speak to me about a X-ray I had yesterday\" The hesitancy in Roy's voice made Eve pull away slightly to look at him. He looked down to meet her questioning gaze. \"What did they say?\" Roy paused and turned his head away. \"They said… there are signs of, well… They said I might be getting better. They're coming to do some more tests in the morning.\" After he had said all of this, he finally turned his eyes back to meet hers, startled to find her on the verge of tears. \"Eve?\" \"Oh my… Roy… I'm so happy\" A grin broke out on her face as the tears began to fall in earnest. She reached up to cup his face in her small hands, and felt a small tear fall from his eyes. \"Can you feel your legs again yet?\" \"Just about. At least, I can sort of feel you sitting on them.\" Roy said shakily. Suddenly however he realised what this must be like for Eve- hearing his good news when she had none for herself. He put his hands on her shoulders, leaning back a little. \"I'm sorry Eve\" \"For what?\" she said, not understanding. \"For getting better when you're not, especially after everything you said yesterday. I wish I could swap places so you could get better instead\" It all came out in a rush, and Eve just carried on smiling up at him. \"There's no reason to be sorry! I'm just so happy for you. Will you…be able to walk again?\" she wiped her eyes a little, still looking up at Roy. \"The Doctor said that I'll probably make a full recovery. He said that it was only the swelling as I healed that was causing it, and that's going down, and the bones' healing too.\" He paused again, his hand resting on the back of her neck now. \"So… yes, I'll walk again.\" Eve shook her head in disbelief, watching happily as a crooked smile broke across Roy's face as he finally seemed to realise that he was going to stand again. She buried her face in his shirtfront again, and when he pulled her closer she felt him chuckle quietly into the night, wondering at this new miracle. The next day Roy waited nervously for the doctors, Eve sitting next to him anxiously. When they came they asked her to return to her bed, but they did so with a friendly smile; she was becoming a fast favourite among all at the hospital, and Roy gave her hand a reassuring squeeze as she turned to limp back to her cot. She watched as they poked and prodded his back, and felt her mouth drop with amazement when one of them poked Roy's toe with a pin and it twitched away. A tiny movement, but any movement was amazing after the month he'd spent totally immobile from the hips down. She watched Roy's face with joy as she saw her amazement reflected in him- he stared at the toe in question, eyes filled with disbelief. He had been so sure he was paralysed for life they continued on testing and prodding, and as Roy felt more and more he looked across to Eve, a fresh smile being shared between the happy pair. The doctors finally allowed Eve over while they continued deliberating and discussing, all seeming amazed by this recovery. Eve meanwhile simply fell into Roy's arms, laughing with happiness, after a moment however he pushed her away a little, his hands on her shoulders. \"Look!\" he exclaimed, turning her around to look down the bed. There, she saw as he slowly wriggled his toes at her. She turned back to him, fresh happy tears falling. They both laughed happily and hugged again, their muffled laughter sounding odd and out of place on the usually quiet ward. The doctors hearing this paused on their way out of the room, and turned to see the pair laughing away like schoolchildren. The head doctor smiled, and called across the room- \"Roy Walker, I expect to see you out of that bed by tomorrow!\" \"Yes sir!\" He replied over Eve's shoulder, before he pulled back and then lifted her up to sit beside him on the bed. Eve leant against his shoulder happily as he leant over and gave her his morning coffee. He began to shuffle a battered old pack of cards, still smiling happily, and she settled further into the bed, warming her hands on the coffee cup as he dealt her cards. The sun was streaming through the windows once more, and the nurses gave the pair extra smiles as they walked by on their rounds, as did the other patients in the ward- everyone was cheered by their good news. That day when they took the pilgrimage to the orange trees Eve walked with a little more of a spring in her step, and for once Roy broke his usual reserved silence and chatted away with the nurse pushing him. His good mood was infectious, and the group of patients were a happier group than normal as they walked between the orange trees. When they reached their usual spot Eve found she had forgotten the blanket she normally brought to sit on, but Roy took off his jacket and she sat on that. He pulled himself down to sit on the grass next to her, and, smiling mischievously Eve scooted round to his feet, yet again leaving the parasol she was supposed to be under on the dry grass. Sighing, Roy picked it up and held it up so she was in the shade again, and watched as she prized off his shoes. Looking up at him devilishly, she stroked one finger down the sole of his left foot, which, as with any normal person, tickled and caused his leg to twitch away a little. They smiled at each other again, and for a while Eve simply played with his feet, marvelling at the new movement that had never been there before, as she'd known Roy. He wriggled his toes a little at her again, before reaching towards her. \"Come on now\" She stopped pestering him, and came up to sit next to him under the parasol on his jacket. The heat was sweltering, and Eve pulled off the straw hat that was squashing her hair to her head. She pulled out her hairpins and messed her hair up a little with her hand, glad to have the breeze cool her. Roy leant over and further mussed her hair, with lead to her messing up his in return, although it was constantly dishevelled anyway. Eventually, giggling under the parasol, they leant back together, Eve resting her head on Roy's broad shoulder. \"Will you tell me that story now?\" She asked, sounding drowsy in the summer heat. \"What kind of story do you like?\" He asked, lazily undoing the top few buttons of his shirt to let the breeze cool under his shirt in the sweltering heat. Fiddling over them Eve undid the rest of them absentmindedly, thinking about what kind of story she wanted. She moved her hand to rest under his shirt on his now cool chest, before replying. \"I think I want a love story. Set a long time ago\" \"Not princesses and knights and Dragons?\" he said teasingly, bringing his hand up to rest on top of hers under his shirt. Eve could feel his slow, steady heartbeat under her hand. \"No! I want one with an Evil king.\" \"An evil king?\" Roy said, frowning. \"Yes. But he's not really evil. He's just sad because of something he lost.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Mmm.\" \"Okay. Well, close your eyes.\" Eve did so, growing ever more sleepy in the suns warmth. \"Now, I want you to imagine a palace.\" \"What kind of a palace?\" \"A huge one, covered in battlements and towers\" \"Yes? Go on.\" Roy spoke for what seemed like hours, winding an intricate tale of love lost and love found, all full of fairytale and magic and quests and prophecy. Eve lost herself in the smooth sound of his voice, only speaking up occasionally to query something or to change a bit of the plot she didn't like. Gradually however her questions became father and father apart, until Roy could feel her breathing slowing as she fell asleep in his arms. He trailed off, watching her fingers twitch as she carried on the tale in her dreams. It was nearing dusk in the orange grove, the sun near to the horizon. Thoughtful, Roy wriggled his toes once more, smiling a little at the sight. Tentatively he found he could move his ankles a little, and he did so for a while, testing the new found sensation of the grass under his toes, his ability to movie and feel improving all the time. However, when the nurse came to bring them back up to the hospital she found them both asleep, and stood, smiling down happily at the pair for a moment, before gently leaning down to shake Roy a little by the shoulder. He opened his eyes blearily, woke up the tired Eve, before the nurse and her then helped him back to his chair and they set off back to the ward for the night, the setting sun behind them as they made there way back.[Chapter 2] The following morning Eve sat fidgeting in her chair, waiting for Roy to wake up. He slept with a slight frown on his face, and she watched with silent delight as she saw his feet twitching slightly under the covers. She was the first up on the ward, aside from the nurses who cleaned quietly around the silent patients. Eve watched as the hospital came alive, seeing the orange pickers going out into the fields and hearing the children stirring in the ward above. She smiled down at the cup of coffee a nurse had silently handed to her, the reassuring smile a sign that she knew why Eve was up so early. Restless, she brushed her hair and tidied around her bed a little, sitting on the floor to reorganise the few belongings she kept in the cupboard next to her bed. Eventually, with another hour or so to go before there was any real possibility of Roy waking up (he was always a late riser) she asked one nurse if it would be okay for her to go and help make his breakfast, and then when she was allowed to made the nurse promise to keep an eye on Roy and send for her if he woke. Away in the relative bustle of the kitchen, she kept herself busy toasting bread, preparing coffee the way Roy liked and half drinking a cup of orange juice herself as she did so. She had butterflies fluttering in her stomach, and the nurses eventually sent her to check if the ice cart was on its way just to stop her from fidgeting about in the kitchen. Eventually however she returned to the ward, and sat again, holding Roy's breakfast tray in her lap as she twitched about sitting on her bed and then on her chair and then on the chair next to his bed. She stared at his closed lids for what felt like hours, willing him to wake up, earning more amused glances from the nurses and patients. The sun rose higher to stream through the windows in earnest, but it wasn't for another 45 minutes or so that Roy finally woke up. Eve was resting her head next to his on the pillow, so he woke up to find her face inches from his. Although at first startled, he relaxed back against the pillows and smiled at her. \"How long have you been sitting there?\" \"An age\" she replied, and a nurse seeing Roy awake smiled and called across- \"That girl's been waiting for you to wake up since before the sun rose.\" Roy sat up a bit, leaning on his arm and rubbing the sleep from his eyes. \"Is that true?\" He said, looking down at the breakfast tray she placed on his lap bemusedly. \"Just eat\" She replied, and he smiled, knowing then that what the nurse had said was true. \"You could have just woken me up you know. I wouldn't have minded.\" He ripped a piece of bread off the roll he was eating before offering her the rest. She shook her head. \"You needed your sleep. How're you feeling?\" Roy looked at her again. \"I feel fine. You look like you're about to sit an exam. Eve, are you okay?\" \"Yes\" She said to quickly. He looked at her, clearly not believing that. \"Its just. It's a big day. I'm all jittery about it.\" He looked at her again from under his eyelashes. \"Fine. I'm worried.\" \"About what?\" \"I'm worried that you…won't be able to do it or it'll be too painful and you'll get sad again, or you'll fall and hurt yourself, or that the doctors are wrong, I'm worried that…\" She paused, unable to meet his eyes. \"I'm worried that you'll get better and leave me here and forget about me.\" Surprised, Roy frowned at her. \"Why on earth would you think that?\" \"Because…\" She couldn't find a good reason. Roy was a good and loyal friend, and she knew he cared about her as much as she did about him. He shook his head, and, putting his breakfast to the side, pulled her to him. \"I'm not going to leave you here just because I can walk again. And even if I was running marathons I wouldn't able to forget you. Don't worry.\" Eve twisted to look up at him, seeing the truth in his eyes. \"I know. I'm sorry for doubting you.\" She lay back against him. \"Silly girl.\" Roy said affectionately. They sat like that for a while, before the doctors came in, and Eve grudgingly moved to the chair next to Roy's cot. She watched with a furrowed brow as the doctors talked amongst themselves and to Roy, and her breath caught as she watched them help him swing his legs around to the side of the bed. His feet gingerly touched the cold hospital tiles, before pressing more firmly down into the floor. With a doctor on each arm supporting his weight and warning him to take it slowly, Roy slowly, but surely, began to rise from the hospital cot. He was unsteady, and swayed a little on his feet, but sure enough, he was standing again. Roy's eyes met Eve's and a smile of pure joy broke out on his face. He was pale and looked a little dizzy- it had been a good while since he had stood, but as the doctors slowly released his arms Roy found he could stand unaided. He looked down at his feet in amazement, barely feeling the doctor's hand at his elbow, warning him not to run before he could walk. He looked up again, and Eve, seeing the determination in his eyes, stood too. Cautiously, leaning heavily on one doctor, Roy took one halting step away from his bed, and then another, and then another. Eventually, with an immense effort as his muscles, stiff from disuse, cramped and pulled, Roy made it to the chair next to Eves bed, taking the last step holding on to her arm rather than the doctors. Exhausted he collapsed into the chair, looking up with delight in his eyes at the tearful Eve, who still gripped his hand tight. His broad grin made her smile so much her cheeks hurt, and as the doctors told him sternly to take it easy for the rest of the day they looked happily at each other. That day, when the nurse left them together in the orange groves, Roy didn't fall from his chair to sit next to her. Instead, leaning a little on her for support, he stood up from the chair, winding his toes into the dry grass. Eve looked up at the tall man standing next to her, unused to and surprised by his height. He beamed down at her, and, another chuckle escaping his lips pulled her to him and into a proper hug. They stood like that for a few seconds before Eve pulled him down to sit. She knew he shouldn't be standing too much yet- he still had a long way to go. Today though, as he sat next to her with his legs bent into a normal, comfortable sitting position, he looked so well he could have been totally recovered. As their initial chatter died down however, Eve let her thoughts drift into less happy areas. What would happen when he left the hospital? She didn't know if she could go with him. And it was possible she supposed that he wouldn't be as eager to spend time with her when he could run around and she couldn't. Eve didn't want him to have to be constantly worrying and helping her- she didn't want to restrict him in that way. The one hundred meters into the grove from the hospital was about the furthest she could walk without a break. Roy, seeing her begin to frown again, put his fingers under her chin and lifted her head to look at him. \"What is it now?\" \"It's nothing,\" she said, shaking her head to clear those gloomy thoughts. \"Do you want me to carry on the story?\" \"Yes\" she leant in to his shoulder, twirling the parasol above their heads. \"Where were we?\" Roy continued the tale, but this time it was happier, and he finished it with the good people living happily ever after and the bad imprisoned forever. When it was over, Roy leant to kiss her forehead, before asking again \"What's wrong?\" Eve sighed and stood, moving to stand before a nearby tree. She started to reach up for an orange, but paused and opted for a lower, smaller one instead. Turning back to face Roy she played with the fruit in her palm. \"Do we… have a happy ending, Roy?\" She looked up at him again, her eyes pleading. \"That's for you to decide.\" He beckoned to her, but she didn't come any closer, instead just sitting on the grass where she had been standing. She began to peel the orange. \"I hope we do,\" She said quietly, eating a small piece of the fresh orange. \"So do I\" said Roy, and she smiled weakly before throwing him a piece of the orange. Seeking to change the subject, Roy carefully moved closer to her before saying \"I spoke to one of the nurses today.\" He bit off a piece of the orange segment. \"What about?\" \"I asked her to take a note to Alexandria.\" \"Who?\" \"She's the little girl who…I knew when I first came here. She went home before you arrived.\" \"And what did you write to her about?\" \"I just wrote that I'd like her to come and visit\" Roy seemed lost in his own thought, playing with the small piece of orange he still held. \"She's…she's the reason I'm still…here today.\" He looked across at Eve suddenly, his eyes pleading with her to just understand and not ask him to explain. She did, and she nodded at him. \"I'd like to meet her\" Roy smiled at the idea. \"Of course you can.\" They sat in comfortable silence for a moment, before Roy looked up and saw the nurse walking through the groves towards them. \"Not asleep this time?\" She said, smiling down at them, before together she and eve helped Roy up from the ground. As they walked back the two women chatted and laughed, and Roy sat smiling as he listened to them. They stopped about half way along the row for the nurse to rest her arms, and Roy leant from his chair to pick a few of the tall daisies that grew alongside the orange trees. In the dusk the scent of the oranges was heavy in the air, and in the darkening sky a few pinpricks of stars could be seen. Leaning back wearily on the arm of the wheelchair, Eve looked up at the emerging night sky. Her back ached from the short walk, and she wiped her brow with the back of the hand in the humid evening. Suddenly she felt Roy's hands winding around her waist, and he pulled her onto his lap. Holding her to him with one arm, the daisies held in that hand, the other hand rubbing her sore back, Roy held her close. The nurse, sensing that they weren't quite ready to go in yet, left them alone together in the twilight, the two of the forming an odd silhouette in the fiery light of the setting sun. Eve could feel her eyelids drooping, and Roy sat with his eyes shut as he continued to stroke her back along the ridge that was her spine. He could feel the twist in it that caused her so much pain, and was especially careful around it. His warm hands on her back made her feel happy and safe, especially as the night chill began to set in. Eventually she grudgingly stirred and went to stand, thinking that they probably shouldn't keep the nurse waiting, but Roy's hands stopped her. He was looking at her through half closed eyes, his hands a little possessive as they held her waist, but Eve didn't mind. He made her feel safe, and she leant back to him, willing to let him hold her for as long as he wanted. Sometimes she wanted to be held, so she reasoned that sometimes he wanted to hold. She was right, and as Roy held her familiar form in his arms he too felt content and happy. Too soon though the nurse came back, signalling the need to go with a quiet \"ahem\". As Roy reluctantly let his hands slide from her waist, Eve stood, nearly sleeping on her feet. Roy reached up to hold her hand, and they went back to the ward like that. As they eased themselves into their respective beds, the nurse fussing over them both, they both drifted off to sleep, worn out from a day of highs and lows and thoughts of the future and past. When Eve woke- unusually late, the next day, the curtains around Roy's bed were pulled tightly shut, as they had often been when she'd first arrived on the ward. She could hear whispering from inside, and when she sat up on her bed and it gave its usual creak, a small face peered out from between the curtains to stare at her briefly, before disappearing back inside. There was another bout of whispering, and Eve could hear Roy's returning murmurs. He pulled back the curtain a little, and, smiling, said \"Come on over.\" Eve, curious, stepped across the floor and poked her head around the curtain. In the white tent the curtain formed she found a small Romanian girl, sitting snuggled on Roy's lap, turning an orange over and over in her palm-it looked ridiculously large in her tiny hands. \"Alexandria, meet Eve\" said Roy, smiling down at the small child, who looked up at her briefly before mumbling something and turning back to her orange. \"Now, Alexandria don't be shy\" said Roy encouragingly, but for now the little girl stayed quiet. \"I'm sorry, she's not usually so shy and retiring\" said Roy with affection. Eve was about to reply when Alexandria piped up, her strongly accented voice loud in the wardroom. \"Do you have a locket?\" At first Eve didn't understand her \"What did you say? She asked, leaning forward a little. \"I said, I said do you have a locket?\" Eve looked at Roy, who simply smiled. \"No, I don't have a locket.\" she said haltingly. \"Good\" came the somewhat haughty reply, and Eve sensed that she had passed some sort of test. To Alexandria, sitting across Roy's lap, the girl next to Roy seemed nice enough, quietly pretty in a way that the girl in the story and in the flicker hadn't been. She cocked her head on her side to look at the pair, and decided that it was okay for this girl to be friends with her Roy. This established, she reached to tug at the thin bracelet on the girl's wrist, her curiosity winning out. Eve slid the bracelet over her hand and gave it to Alexandria, who slid it onto her own wrist admiringly. They stayed there for a while, the three of them in their own secluded world behind the curtain, Roy and Alexandria doing most of the talking, going over the story they had shared together not so long ago. Roy looked at her with fondness clear to see in his eyes, and when the time came for her to leave he looked truly sad to see her go. Pulling her into his arms, he said to her \"Let me show you something,\" pulling aside the curtain. One hand on Eve's shoulder for support he carefully stood, holding the young girl tight against his chest. \"See Alexandria, I can stand.\" \"You can! Can you feel your toes too?\" came the excited reply. \"Yes\" he said, laughing as he set her down on a chair. She jumped down and squatted on the floor near his feet. Prodding a toe, she looked up at him eagerly \"Can you feel that? No, no looking.\" Smiling, Roy looked away, and as her little fingers poked away he told her which toe she was prodding. Alexandria it seemed would never tire of this game, but her mother called to her from the doorway so the pair had to bid each other goodbye for the second time. Roy watched her go, still leaning on Eve's shoulder a little for balance as he stood. Eve took his hand, expecting him to sit, but instead Roy made his way, with Eve at his side, to the doorway. He waved to Alexandria as she left, winding an arm around Eve's shoulders as he watched her go. After a few moments Eve spoke up. \"She's a sweet girl.\" \"The sweetest\" Roy said, a tinge of sadness in his voice. Eve delicately leant against him, careful to not put her whole weight on him, but Roy pulled her close to him for a minute, thinking about Alexandria and their story. The doctor, who was making his way to see him and Eve, called across the yard, interrupting his thoughts- \"Back to bed Mr walker, and you too Miss Eve, before you do yourselves an injury!\" The pair hobbled back to their beds, and the doctor spoke to them both for a time, before sending a nurse for a pair of crutches for Roy. When she returned with a pair the doctor instructed Roy on how to use them, told him once more not to \"over do it\" and that \"slow and steady wins the race\" before finally taking his leave of them. Roy found he could move very well on the crutches, his arms as strong as they'd ever been, and so asked the nurse to take the wheelchair away. Filled with new energy, and his dazzling smile lending a helping hand, he managed to convince a nurse to help him take a couple of chairs just outside for him and Eve and, pulling them as close together as they would possibly go, the pair sat in them, dozing in the near shade together, Roy's hand resting on Eves shoulder as she leant on his. As the nurses passed them on their rounds they smiled and giggled at the pair, who looked like (they thought) a couple of old pensioners sitting together after a long, eventful life. That afternoon Eve and Roy could walk to their patch of the orange grove by themselves, Roy matching his pace on the crutches with Eve's slow tread. On the way however Roy stumbled as one crutch stuck in a hole under the grass, and he tumbled down to the floor. Eve fell to his side panic stricken- \"Roy? Roy are you alright?\" her worries however dissipated instantly as she heard him laughing, and as he sat up and dusted himself off she let out a sigh of relief, ruffling his hair before passing his crutches to him so he could stand. \"You had me terrified for a moment there! You should be more careful.\" Roy smiled down at her. \"You're beginning to sound like me, don't you think?\" \"Oh shut up!\" Eve punched his arm playfully, and they made their way down the orange trees together, laughing and joking as they walked together.[Chapter 3] For the next few days Roy practised his walking, growing stronger it seemed with each step he took. He was determined to be every ounce the able bodied man he was before, and he was constantly up and about. On their afternoon walks down the plantation they would walker father than they had in the past, although Eve still needed quite frequent breaks. They would sit down the furthest edge of the plantations, looking up the rows of the orange trees towards the hospital as they talked. Eve's condition improved a little too, with a new type of pain medication they doctors tried out on her. However, she still had bad days occasionally, and Roy kept her company on these, sitting next to her hospital cot, his chatter and storytelling keeping her mind off things while his strong hands rubbing her shoulders and back numbed the physical pain. A new doctor arrived at the hospital that week. He was short and fat, in his mid thirties, and of the most hideous character. At first the nurses enjoyed his constant flattery, but as his comments became more vulgar they began to avoid him, as did most of the hospital staff. Eve however, was unfortunately one of the patients under his care. The first day he approached her she was sitting with Roy, and his warning stare kept the man reasonably polite and courteous. It was obvious though that he eyed Eve with ungentlemanly appreciation, his gaze never meeting her eyes, just staring at her body. Still, no one in the hospital considered him any real threat. However, the following day events took a more dramatic turn. The doctor returned to the ward early in the morning, before Roy or Eve had woken up, scuttling across the room almost silently. He drew the curtains around Eve's bed so she wouldn't see that it was a suspiciously early time. The man then shook her by the shoulder. Eve woke sleepily, saying \"Roy?\" before she opened her eyes to find the disgusting little man leaning over her. Sitting up quickly, she tried to put herself as far away from him as possible on the little hospital cot. \"Good morning. Miss Eve, is it?\" \"Yes...\" She said cautiously, pulling the sheets up around her. \"I've come to have a look at your back. Just a routine check up you understand, nothing to worry about.\" He moved around to the side of the bed she's was on, and proceeded to pull clumsily at the back of her nightgown. \"Excuse me?\" Said Eve, attempting to bat his hands away. \"Now now, don'ts lets be silly about this.\" He said, a crude smile on his face as he put a hand on her waist. Disgusted, Eve slapped the hand away, but the doctor just put it back, ignored her protests and continued to fumble with her gown. As Eve struggled away from him she called out- \"Roy? Roy!\" She heard him quickly get out of bed, and in mere seconds he was pulling back the curtains and pushing the doctor away from Eve, in his anger flinging the man halfway across the room. He then stood in front of her protectively, in such a way that he totally blocked the man from even seeing Eve. \"Don't you dare touch her again.\" Roy said furiously, his hand reaching behind him to hold Eves. She could feel him trembling a little with rage, and squeezed his hand to show that she was okay. Meanwhile the short man had gone bright red with anger, and advanced towards Roy. \"Who do you thing you are? You've got no right to tell me what to do. In fact-\" He gave Roy a shove, which in his still weakened state caused him to take a step back. \"I don't care what you think. I'm a doctor you know, and I can slip you some sleeping pills if I have to.\" Regaining his balance, Roy stepped up to the doctor again, dropping Eve's hand. \"Perhaps you were a doctor, but I doubt you are now\" The ugly little man follows his gaze to the group of nurses and senior doctors who now stood in the doorway, attracted by the loud words. A couple of them came and took the man away, ignoring his protests and apologising profusely to Eve and assuring Roy the doctor would be escorted off the land and to the police. Roy however was still angry, and worried about Eve, and everyone else had gone he fussed over her, asking her repeatedly if she was really okay. Eve reassured him over and over again, but Roy still kept her near, watching all who approached her with a calculating gaze. The male patients and doctors gave Eve a wide berth for the remainder of the day, Roy's whole stance warding them off as he kept his arm around her protectively. A week or so on Eve was returning from an X-ray, walking slowly down the corridors with a nurses helping hand at her elbow, when the nurse paused and spoke to someone. The nurse's hand was then replaced with the large, warm hand of a man at her arm. Surprised, she turned to find Roy standing next her, unaccompanied by any nurse and without his crutches. He just smiled at her, before pulling her to carry on walking down the sunlit corridor. Eve leant on his arm as they walked, a look of amazement on her face as she saw him striding, smoothly and normally down the corridor, as if he'd always been able to. Pausing and stepping away from him, she took a moment to look at the transformed man before her. He stood tall, with a straight back, broad shouldered and strong looking. If it wasn't for Roy's familiar face beaming down at her she might have had trouble recognising him at all. He led her out onto the veranda and sat on the bench there, patting the space next to him for her to sit down. Shivering in the chilly morning air, Eve did so, still looking at him speechlessly. \"I. I have no idea what to say\" \"You don't need to say anything,\" said Roy, pulling her closer to lean on his shoulder, and wrapping a warm arm around her. She picked up his free hand, and curled his fingers around her own. \"What did the doctors say?\" \"They say it's a miracle. As far as they can tell, I'm going to be fine.\" Eve wanted to ask him how much longer he was going to be here at the hospital, but not wanting to ruin the mood, kept quiet. However Roy, who had come to know Eve better than even she knew, knew she'd been worried about the prospect of him leaving, so said after a moments pause- \"Just a few more tests, and I'll be discharged in a few days.\" Eve still refused to look at him. \"Look, I'm not going to leave you here Eve\" said Roy, leaning forward and trying to meet her gaze. \"I'm not going to stop being here for you just because I'm able to be somewhere else.\" \"I know, I know. I just don't want to hold your back.\" \"You think you hold me back?\" Roy asked, his eyebrows raised. Eve stood and went to lean against the pole supporting the balcony above. \"It's just... I can't walk very far, I'm so pathetically delicate I can barely be left by myself, and when I have a bad day... I don't want you to have to spend all your time worrying and fussing over me, and unable to do things because my needs get in the way\" Still sitting on the bench, Roy looked exasperated, shaking his head a little. A look of determination coming into his eyes, he too stood. \"Eve?\" \"Yes?\" Eve turned, only to find Roy's lips suddenly pressed against hers. At first she froze, but as his hands came up to hold her face, his thumbs stroking gently along her cheekbones, she leant into him, her hands tentatively coming up to rest on his chest. When the kiss was over, Roy leant his forehead on hers, their noses touching as they stood together, eyes closed, savouring the moment \"Now do you believe me?\" Roy murmured to her. \"Yes\" she said, if a little shakily. Roy gave an almost smug smile at that before leant back from Eve a little, his hands dropping to cover hers on his chest. He looked at her closely, trying to memorize every tiny detail of her face, from the grey-blue eyes and the freckles that dotted her nose, to the slight rosy blush that he had induced in her cheeks. Eve smiled back up at him, curling her fingers under his. The fact that they hadn't said those three words yet didn't seem to matter-they didn't really need them-each knew how much the other cared. Nevertheless, this had been their first proper kiss, and it somehow seemed to validate their relationship. Winding his arm around Eve's slender shoulders, smiling as he felt her nuzzle against him and wind her own arm around his waist, Roy leant his head on hers. They walked off together, reassured from the kiss that signified the start of a new stage in their courtship. That night Eve couldn't sleep. It was hot again, without even the slightest breeze to relieve the humidity in the wardroom. She twisted and turned in her bed, the bed sheets seeming heavy, making her feel trapped. Eventually she threw them back completely with a sigh, expecting to be awake until the sun rose. But the silence of the night was then broken by a familiar voice. \"Can't sleep?\" Roy asked quietly. Eve started; unaware that he was also awake- he was lying on his side, his head laid on his hands as he looked across at her. Eve turned to mirror his position. \"No.\" Roy sat up, buttoning up his nightshirt before standing up. He extended a hand out to Eve, and she took it and let him pull her up out of bed. Putting his finger to his lips, he led her from the room, easing the door open quietly. The nurse sitting up for the nightshift pretended to be asleep in her chair, letting the two sneak out to the orchard together, with no little amount of thought spent on how she could gossip about this new development in the morning. News of the pair's kiss in the courtyard had spread through the wards, their blossoming love story a fast favourite with everyone in the hospital, even with the little girls on the children's ward, who would watch Eve enviously when she and Roy were walking about the orange plantations in the afternoon- among them Roy was considered some kind of fairytale prince. Of course though, as Roy led her down the rows of orange trees, the pair were unaware of this, thinking only of each other. Outside it was warm enough still that Eve didn't miss her cardigan, and the dewy cold grass was soft against their feet. While the moon shone down on them Roy still led her further and further down through the orange trees, where kerosene burners produced circles of yellow light among the trees- although the night was hot now, in the early morning it would grow cold, enough so to damage the fruit, so the burners were lit to stop the fruit from being damaged by the chill. Eventually Roy came to a stop just outside of the light of one burner, and, unfolding the blanket he had been carrying, spread it on the floor. Before he could pull Eve down to sit, he felt her tug at his sleeve, and he turned to find her looking up to him with an odd look in her eyes. Slowly she put her arms up around his neck, before, standing on her very tiptoes, she reached up and kissed him. Instantly his arms were winding around her, one around her waist and one hand between her shoulders as he pulled her close. When she finally broke away he carried on holding her, looking at her with a thoughtful gaze. After a moment he leant his head back down to her and pressed a tender kiss half on and half off her lips, surprising her as his hands gripped her more tightly and he swung her up into his strong arms, the long skirt of her nightdress trailing, before he gently sat down with Eve on his lap onto the stretched out blanket. They sat in silence for a moment, Roy's hand falling down to Eves hip, where his thumb stroked slow patterns. The orange light that the distant kerosene burner gave lit their faces, Eve's a little flushed. Her hands were curled on Roy's chest again, and once more she undid his shirt buttons and rested them and her head on his bare skin, listening to his steady heartbeat, the only other sound the quiet keening of a few cicadas in the distance. Roy moved his hand to her arm, and when she looked up at him gave her a crooked smile. \"I had a dream last night\" He said, still smiling down at her. \"What about?\" Said Eve, sitting up a little in his lap to get a better look at him. \"You.\" He reached his hand up to tuck her hair behind her ear. \"I dreamt that we were living in a house together…\" \"Go on\" she said, intrigued. \" It was a beautiful house, and we were standing in the front garden together. You were wearing a dress.\" \"A dress?\" \"A pretty one, all white and flowing. Your hair was down like it is now, and I kissed you.\" \"You did?\" \"Yes\" He said, his smile growing even wider. \"Like this.\" and he pressed his lips to hers, holding the kiss for a few long seconds. \"Go on\" said Eve, blushing profusely. Roy stroked her hot cheeks with one finger, smiling mischievously. \"There were flowers growing, and orange trees in the back garden, like the ones here but younger,\" He said. \"And…\" His eyes met hers, suddenly a little more serious. \"There were children playing under those trees.\" Eve was silent in his lap, and for a moment he was worried she was upset, but when she looked back up at him she was smiling like she had won the lottery. \"Tell me more.\" She said, tearing up a little. \"Well, the house was painted white, with a red door, and there was a blue car on the driveway.\" He caught a happy tear from Eve's cheek with his fingertip. \"It was the best dream I've ever had\" Eve buried her head in his shoulder, a small choked laugh of delight escaping her lips, and Roy gave a small chuckle in return as he buried his face in her hair. They sat like that for a while, before Roy pulled away and took her hands in his. A faint breeze rustled through the trees, opening his shirt further. He looked at her small hands for a while, before looking up and meeting her eyes. \"I love you\" He said, his gaze steady. \"And I love you.\" replied Eve, before Roy's lips came crashing down on hers and they tumbled back onto the grass together, laughing happily under the stars. ","Summary":" When she was brought back in, she was as pale as the sheets around her, her eyes still squeezed tig"},{"Movie":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","Title":"E T II: Darkness and Fears, Light and Love","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10239477","Passage":"[Chapter 1] April 16, 1985 Elliot Taylor sat at his desk in Astronomy class paying rapt attention to his teacher Mr. Rosner. It was a known fact around the school that Elliot paid more attention than any of the other kids. He had been this way ever since he had last been visited by his otherworldly best friend, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial at Christmas in 1982 and he was now in eighth grade and he loved learning higher levels of everything he had learned about previously. He loved history, biology, geometry, chemistry, and he even did good in mathematics, but his favorite subjects of all were astronomy and science for he wanted to impress Keys, who was now not only dating his divorced mother but had become like a second father to him, and he also wanted to honor E.T.'s memory with it for he had shown more about the truth than any human teacher ever could, though Mr. Rosner was a close second. \"So,\" he was saying at the end of his discourse, \"because the sun's rays take three-million years to reach the Earth when we look through the Hubble Space Telescope we can actually look back in time.\" \"Can we see into the future, too?\" asked Elliot curiously. \"I suppose so,\" his teacher replied. \"If we were on a distant planet. But I don't think we'll ever be able to travel back in time like in the movie Back to the Future ,\" he added referring to everyone's favorite movie this year. Elliot was just about to ask another question when he suddenly felt something poking him from behind his head. He looked around and saw a paper airplane lying on the floor by his chair. He picked it up and unfolded it. There was a message written on the white piece of paper and he read it out loud. \"I'm a nerd.\" The rest of the class which had until now been looking just bored now erupted in raucous laughter, especially Murray Findelmyer who sat across from Elliot and he pointed his finger at Elliot as he laughed at him much to the displeasure of him and to the teacher. \"Silence!\" he snapped. \"Mr. Findelemyer I will be seeing you after class!\" he said to Murray angrily. Elliot slouched down in his seat. He had just been reminded that although he was one of the smartest kids in school he was also one of the least popular. He supposed it was the price that came with knowledge that E.T. had mentioned, but he had also said things would get better eventually for people like him, but waiting was hard to do. Another thing that was hard for him was his physical education class which he had at the end of the day. He was never good at anything in this area, unlike his older brother Michael who was now in senior high school and was also a star at football and track, while Elliot couldn't kick a football far if his life depended on it, and he also could just never run fast enough before tiring himself out. Today they were climbing by hand to the top of a long rope. Elliot watched in fascination as Ben Neslie clutched onto the rope and maneuvered himself upward with his feet and bare hands until he was very close to the very top. \"Well done, Ben!\" said the coach as everyone applauded. \"Now it is your turn Elliot.\" Elliot gulped as he took hold of the rope and gripped it as tightly as he could. \"On your mark, get set, go!\" the coach said. Elliot tried hauling himself upward but the rope was too hard and thick and also rough on his hands and he kept slipping and he had only gone up three and a half feet when he suddenly looked downward and almost at once plummeted down to Earth on his backside. All the class laughed at him when he fell, especially Murray Findlemyer. \"I saw London, I saw France, I saw Elliot's underpants!\" Joan Pliers shrieked, and thus making everyone laugh even harder. \"Quiet! Quiet!\" exclaimed the coach. \"Never mind, Elliot,\" he added softly. \"You'll find your strength someday. Elliot hung his head as he walked to the back of the line feeling like a total wimp. As he walked out of the school building later in the afternoon he noticed Erin walking by him. She was tall and slender with long blonde braids hanging down her back and she was also the girl he had kissed on a sudden mysterious impulse three years ago. He had apologized to her about as soon as he could and she had said it was alright but to never let it happen again. She caught him looking at her and she smiled and waved. He waved back thinking of how pretty she looked walking in the sunlight. He went over to the bike racks to get his bike which he always rode to and from school on. However, Murray Findlemyer was there waiting for him and as soon as he was in reach he reached out and grabbed by the straps on his backpack and forced him to the ground. \"Because of you I've got detention!\" he roared as he continued to pummel him into the earth. \"You're not going anywhere until you give me all your money!\" \"I don't have any!\" Elliot screamed. Murray turned him upside down and shook him as hard as he could and a single quarter fell out of his jeans pocket which he had forgotten all about. \"Well, what do you call this, then!?\" he exclaimed as he grabbed the quarter from Elliot's grasp and then kicked him in the face. \"You're a nerd, a wimp, and a liar! Is this your bike?\" he asked taking hold of the handlebars of Elliot's bike. \"Yeah... wha...?\" Elliot muttered feeling tenderly of his jaw where Murray had kicked him. \"Then thanks for loaning it out to me!\" he exclaimed airily as he hopped onto its seat and pedaled fast away down the sidewalk. Elliot sat in the dirt with tears streaming down his face adding salt to the wounds Murray had given him. His bike had been a prized possession of his for his dad had given it to him and he had also flown on it with E.T. twice and now Murray had took it from him and possibly forever. He stood u shakily and stumbled along the sidewalk as he sobbed all the way home. When he finally arrived home it was almost evening. He opened the door and found his ten year old sister Gertie sitting in front of the TV watching The Smurfs and his seventeen year old brother Michael was on the phone apparently talking to his girlfriend. \"Sure, tomorrow night sounds great!\" he said happily into the phone. Elliot found his mother was in the kitchen standing over the stove preparing dinner and when she saw him come in she quickly put everything down and rushed at once to his side. \"Oh my God! What happened to you and why are so late?\" she inquired worriedly as she inspected his facial injury. \"Murray took my bike,\" was all Elliot could get out through his throat which was aching from sobbing so much. \"Oh dear! No!\" Mary sighed as she led him upstairs to the bathroom where she began to wash the bruise on his face with soap and water. \"I hate school!\" Elliot exclaimed as she began to apply disinfectant to his hurt skin which caused it to burn. \"Nobody likes me there, they say I'm a wimp! I wish I had left with E.T. in his spaceship and gone with him to his home. I bet everyone there is a lot nicer than they are here!\" Mary felt her heart breaking at his words. She had to remind him he was still loved and wanted here in his own home. \"There is plenty of love for you right here in this house,\" she said as she tenderly bandaged up his cheek. \"There really are good and kind people in this world, they just get hard to look for sometimes,\" she continued. \"We'll get your bike back soon. Why don't you call Keys and tell him about it.\" She added as an afterthought, \"And I'm sure E.T. wouldn't want you to feel this way. He's probably sad that you're so sad right now.\" Elliot began to think about E.T. He was not only his best friend he was his mentor and his soul mate. When he had first seen E.T. he had been afraid of him but when he had met him properly he had known instantly there was something very special about him, more so than any person on Earth. Now it seemed like it was written in the stars for them to meet and be saved by each other. He could still feel him with him all the time, for he was forever tuned into his mind and his heart and most of the time he could feel he was perfectly happy, he just wished he could be so himself. He went into his bedroom and stood by the window. He could see the first stars were out now and the sky was growing dim. He studied the stars for a moment and tried to imagine which one E.T.'s home revolved around. He remembered when E.T. had said he would always be right here for him, and just a call away. He wondered just how true that was. \"Hi, E.T.. It's me, Elliot,\" he said directing his speech toward the stars. \"I hope you're not too busy right now, but I wanted to tell you I miss you and I wish you were here now. My life really stinks right now and my bike got stolen, the one you and I went flying on before, remember? So... if it's not too much trouble for you, could you come back again and help me get it back, and not just because of it, but also because I would really like to see you again.\" He sniffed and wiped his eyes. \"Goodnight, E.T..\" He sat at his desk and took his homework out of his backpack and got himself busy with astronomy. A couple hours later he was startled to hear a mysterious humming noise which sounded almost like music. He looked up and was shocked to see the baseball on his desk rise up into the air and spin around, then he saw the flowers in the pot nearby blossom into full bloom. Then a bright yellow light came in through the window and flooded the room with its brilliance. Elliot gasped. He knew what this had to mean. \"He's come back!\" he whispered. He leaped up from his chair at the desk and rushed to the window beside it. He could see the bright light rising above the treetops over the houses and he could just make out the silhouette of a round blue object floating over them. Without another second's thought he raced downstairs and grabbed his jacket that was hanging by the door and rushed outside. He ran into the garden beside the house where he saw the lights descending and stopped short as he watched the spaceship land slowly and gracefully onto the soil and as the hatching doors opened a gangplank was lowered down. A small figure appeared in the light of the opening in the ship, it waddled slowly down the gangplank in the shadows attracting more light as it descended. \"E.T.!\" Elliot gasped as he recognized him the moment he was face to face with him. The gentlehearted little alien smiled serenely at him and held out his finger. \"Ouch,\" he said as the tip of lit up. Elliot smiled understanding. \"Ouch,\" he replied as he extended his own finger toward him and theirs fingertips connected.[Chapter 2] Elliot threw his arms around E.T. and hugged him like he was afraid if he didn't keep holding onto him he'd disappear. \"Greetings gentle Earthling,\" E.T. said as he tenderly rubbed Elliot's back. \"E.T. glad to see you again.\" \"Just as I'm glad to see you again!\" exclaimed Elliot looking up at E.T.'s smiling face. \"I just called for you now because I need you, did you already know?\" \"Maybe, or maybe it was just an amazing coincidence,\" replied E.T. \"Remember I can feel what's in your heart just as you can feel mine. I could feel your pain, anger, and depression, but I do not know what caused it, maybe you can fill me in on it and I'll see what I can do for you.\" \"You must be hungry after your journey,\" Elliot said. \"And so am I, it's almost dinnertime. Come inside and I tell you everything then. I'm sure my family will be happy to see you again also.\" E.T. smiled and nodded, a human gesture he had picked up on during his last visit. Elliot led E.T. into his house and at once his brother and sister got up and rushed up to E.T. to embrace him. \"E.T.! I missed you!\" exclaimed Gertie kissing his cheek. \"It's good to have you back, little fella!\" added Michael as he patted E.T. on the head. \"We were so hoping you would come back just now,\" said Mary gratefully to him. \"And your just in time for dinner, we're having baked potatoes and green beans.\" \"My favorite!\" exclaimed E.T. delightedly. As they all sat around the dining table Elliot told them all about what had happened to him at school that day. \"And then Murray took my bike and just rode away on it!\" he said heatedly. \"Taking my quarter wasn't enough for him, he had to have my bike too!\" \"Why would Murray take what was your and not his?\" E.T. asked not understanding it at all. \"Because it was mine, and because he didn't like me,\" replied Elliot miserably. \"Why does he not like you?\" asked E.T. very confused. \"What's not to like about you?\" \"I'm a wimp,\" Elliot replied despondently. \"What's a wimp?\" inquired E.T. curiously. \"Someone who can't make the team?\" replied Elliot, starting to get tired of E.T.'s questions. \"Why can't you make the team?\" E.T. asked. Elliot thought about it but just couldn't come up with a good answer for it. \"I... I don't know,\" he said. \"Murray is a very bad person! You should give him a good punch in the nose next time you see him!\" Gertie declared raising up a clenched fist. \"No, Gertie,\" Mary objected. \"Elliot, violence is never the right solution, two wrongs don't make a right.\" \"But I have to get my bike back somehow,\" Elliot exclaimed. \"It was very special to me.\" \"Well, why don't we just report Murray to the police, and they'll tell his parents and you'll get your bike back, and hopefully Murray will get suspended,\" Michael suggested. \"That would just make things worse!\" exclaimed Elliot in despair. \"Murray still lives in the neighborhood and he knows where I live and he'll come around here and pound me into the dirt, I know he will!\" He turned desperately to E.T. \"E.T., why don't you just take me away from here in your spaceship so I can live with you on your planet?\" \"Elliot, please,\" Mary said in a slightly hurt voice. \"Running away never solves anything.\" \"Mary is right,\" E.T. agreed. \"But you need not worry, my friend,\" he said to Elliot. \"If Murray has your bike I will help you get it back.\" \"You will?\" Elliot's eyes lit up with renewed hope. \"I promise,\" E.T. assured him. After dinner Elliot went upstairs and into the bathroom where he began brushing his teeth and E.T. followed him and watched his movements curiously. \"Why do you do that?\" he asked. \"So I can wipe off the remains of the food I had for dinner,\" Elliot replied with toothpaste foam coming out of his mouth. \"Why?\" asked E.T. \"Because I have to keep my teeth clean so I won't get cavities or germs in them,\" Elliot replied as he began to rinse his mouth out. \"What are cavities?\" asked E.T. as he had never heard of them before. \"They're black holes that grow into your teeth and make them hurt,\" replied Elliot, wiping his mouth off. \"And what are germs?\" asked E.T., thinking he might have heard the term before but wasn't sure. \"They're teeny tiny things that you can't see but you know you have them whenever you get sick,\" Elliot replied, opening a bottle full of a green liquid. \"What is that green liquid for?\" E.T. asked pointing to it. \"It's mouthwash,\" said Elliot. \"To make sure all of the germs are washed away.\" He opened the bottle and took a large swig of the green liquid and began quickly sloshing it around inside of his mouth before he spit it out in the sink. \"May E.T. try it?\" he asked. \"Um... Okay,\" said Elliot handing E.T. the bottle. E.T. took a big gulp of the green liquid and swallowed it. \"Why, it's delicious!\" he exclaimed. \"Are you kidding?\" exclaimed Elliot in disbelief. \"That stuff burns my mouth up!\" As Elliot got into bed that night he let E.T. sleep on the floor beside him in his sleeping bag. \"E.T.?\" he asked after a moment. \"Are you sure you can get my bike back from Murray?\" \"E.T. is sure,\" he replied. \"He would never let you down.\" \"But how?\" asked Elliot. \"How will you get it back? I mean, I sure wouldn't want Murray to hurt you or anything.\" E.T. smiled with a look of confidence in his big blue eyes. \"No need to worry. My race has developed our own special defense mechanisms which we use mainly on dangerous plants, and I won't even have to be seen, it will look like you did it all yourself.\" \"Really? But how?\" asked Elliot. E.T. whispered his plan of action to him. The next day as Elliot walked to school he crossed the street and took a shortcut where he knew he would be sure to catch up with Murray. E.T. followed him and kept in the shadows and the bushes by the road. When they finally caught up with Murray he was pedaling Elliot's bicycle down the street toward them. Elliot ran out into the street and stood right in Murray's way with his hands on his hips. Murray stopped abruptly in front of him. \"Get out of my way, wimp!\" he yelled. \"Murray, you took my bike when it wasn't yours to take,\" Elliot said in a calm, emotionless tone. \"As it's rightful owner I demand that you give it back right now or I will be forced to get tough with you.\" Murray snorted and laughed loudly through his nose and teeth. \"Aw, come on!\" he guffawed. \"I'd like to see a wimp like you try and be tough like me! Now get out of my way before I run you down!\" \"I'm not going anywhere until I have my bike, Murray, I mean it!\" Elliot said in the same calm and serious tone of voice as before. Murray promptly reached out and lunged at Elliot with a huge balled fist and swung at him hard, however to his astonishment he couldn't strike Elliot and he only hit onto a wall of solid air around him. He blinked in disbelief and stared at Elliot as if he were suddenly seeing he was there for the very first time. Then he hauled back and took another swing at him with his other fist and then another and another but each time he was blocked by the shield of solid air in front of Elliot. \"What is with you, wimp?\" Murray said with a trace of fear in his voice. \"Don't you ever call me a wimp in front of me!\" Elliot said. \"I'll call you whatever I want to call you, loser!\" Murray shouted. \"Alright,\" said Elliot. \"Look up there!\" Murray looked up with a confused look on his face and the next moment with a shocked look because he suddenly found himself being lifted up into the air on the bicycle. \"Hey what are you doing! Put me down!\" he exclaimed. \"Put me down now!\" \"Not until you give me back my bike!\" Elliot declared defiantly. \"Never!\" shouted Murray. \"Alright then,\" Elliot said with a regretful sigh. The next moment Murray let of surprise and terror as the bicycle he was on suddenly turned itself upside down and he was clinging desperately onto the handlebars and his feet dangled trembling in the air. \"Stop this right now you little demon!\" Murray screamed as if pleading for mercy from Elliot. Elliot just blinked and a moment later Murray's trousers fell down past his knees and his boxer shorts covered with little yellow Tweety Birds were revealed for all to see. \"Alright! Alright!\" Murray finally said, almost in tears of humiliation. \"You can have your stupid back back!\" \"You promise you'll never pick on me again?\" asked Elliot demandingly. \"I promise!\" Murray shouted. \"Cross my heart and hope to die and all that!\" Elliot blinked again and the bicycle righted itself but Murray lost his grip on it and fell to the ground on his backside with his boxers still showing. Murray hurriedly pulled up his trousers and ran away bawling, while Elliot hopped onto his bicycle and pedaled over to a bush beside the road and whispered, \"Thanks E.T..\" E.T. poked his head out of the bush and smiled and winked. Then Elliot pedaled off to school while E.T. crept quietly back to the house.[Chapter 3] E.T. had been on his way back to the Taylors house, when he suddenly realized how curious he was about where Elliot had gone to. For this thing called school was something completely unheard of to him. He couldn't help but wonder if maybe it was a bad place to be if it was where Elliot could get his bicycle stolen from him and also be called a wimp for not making the team, and what did making the team mean anyway? E.T. was so curious he felt he just had to find out and so he turned back around and dashed quickly through the underbrush maneuvering himself forward with his extra long arms. By the time E.T. arrived at the school Elliot was in the middle of physical training and E.T. found a dozen human children in a barren field that was surrounded by grass and he saw about fifteen human children scattered around on it and in front of them there was a man wearing a blue uniform with a white birdlike symbol on the left breast and he was speaking rapidly to all his pupils. \"On your mark, get set, go!\" he exclaimed. E.T. watched as a light haired boy with a face dotted everywhere with freckles ran forward toward a long and narrow white bar that was placed in the middle of the field and as soon as he was close enough he made a great leap for it and flew over it in a single bound. Everyone cheered as he landed on his feet on the other side. \"Very good, Perry!\" exclaimed the coach. \"Now it's your turn, Elliot.\" E.T. watched as Elliot stepped timidly to the front of the line and and then set off at a run, rather slowly at first and then he began picking up speed and then when he was within inches from the white bar he made a jump for it. But instead of flying over it he fell on top of it and flattened it to the ground. Everyone laughed at his mishap and the coach went up to him and said kindly, \"That's okay Elliot, just try again.\" So Elliot picked himself up and backed up from the bar and then set off running at it again with an air of determination in his movement. He made a great leap at it but he apparently wasn't close enough and he came up just short of hitting the bar and fell flat on his face. Everyone except the coach laughed at him again and yelled boo. The coach went up to him and gently helped him to stand again and said, \"It's okay, Elliot. You'll do better next time. Remember, if at first you don't succeed, try try again.\" E.T. thought the coach had given very good advice, but then he watched as Elliot hung his head in disgrace and walked back to the end of the line his shoulders slumping as his ears filled with the things he heard from the others around him like \"Chicken head!\" and \"What a wimp!\" E.T. watched from his hiding place in the bushes and shadows and felt he couldn't bear to see Elliot feeling so ashamed of himself, and he could actually feel his remorse as if it were his own and it was so deep that it made him want to cry and he sniffled. The sniffle Elliot heard from him and he looked around quickly and spotted the top of his head in the bushes and crept quietly away from the line and walked up to him and bending down to eye level he whispered, \"E.T.! What on Earth are you doing here now?\" \"E.T. had to see you and find out about school,\" he explained. \"I saw you trying to jump over there, but is it important that you must make a jump over that white line there?\" \"So that I can show how good I am at jumping over things,\" Elliot replied dismally. \"But as you saw I am no good at all, am I?\" E.T. smiled and looked tenderly into Elliot's sad face. \"I do believe you can jump over it if you only feel you can. Come here.\" He put three of his four fingers together into a birdlike symbol and lit the one in the middle and very gently touched it to Elliot's forehead. \"There,\" he said. \"Let's see if this helps.\" Elliot suddenly felt all of his sorrow and shame melted away from him and replaced by an overt feeling of happiness and confidence in being just who he was. And suddenly he knew exactly how to leap over the bar. He ran quickly up to his coach just he was about to call the time and said, \"Coach, I want to try again now! I can do it! I can do it now!\" The coach looked into Elliot's eyes and saw the look of joy and confidence in them, it was more confidence than he had ever seen in any of the pupils he had coached before. And ignoring the sniggering that came from some of the other students he nodded and said, \"Okay then, give it your best shot!\" Elliot raced to the front of the line and stopped for only a second to get himself set and then started off at a steady jog toward to white bar and then gained strength and speed as he got closer and closer to it and then he jumped high into the air and manuvered his body weight forward in a great arch and soared high over the bar and landed gracefully on his hands and knees on the other side of it. He stood up and turned around and was met with gasps and murmurs of surprise and disbelief and then gradually he began to hear clapping and more and more clapping until it was all he could hear. \"Excellent!\" the coach yelled trying to be heard of the cheers and applause. \"Let Elliot be a great example to you all of what you can do if you just look inside and try your very best!\" E.T. watched from the bushes and caught sight of Elliot looking his way and he smiled at him as he lit his fingertip.[Chapter 4] Elliot rose his bicycle up to his house and parked it by the garage. He found E.T. waiting for him there. \"Elliot, what is wrong?\" asked E.T. concerned. \"You look so downhearted.\" \"I told Erin about you, but she thought I was making it all up just to make fun of her,\" Elliot sighed. E.T. looked like he understood. \"She just wasn't ready to believe yet,\" he said gently. \"Most of this Earth isn't ready to believe yet, but they will eventually, just give some time my friend.\" Elliot was about to reply when suddenly a large white SUV pulled up into the driveway, and he recognized it instantly. \"Keys!\" he exclaimed happily. Sure enough when the left front door opened Keys stepped out of it and ran over to embrace E.T. and Elliot. \"I had to be here!' he said as he hugged them both. \"Mary told me you had come back again.\" Elliot looked up as he heard the door on the right side of the SUV slam shut and he saw a tall older man with lots of gray wispy hair and a pair of glasses on over gray eyes wearing a pale brown suit with an ID card pinned to the left breast walk towards them. \"Allow me to introduce my new friend and colleague,\" said Keys rising up to the older man. \"This is Professor Meisner. He went to the same University as I did and he is a renowned professional in the research of extra-terrestrial life and he is a very nice gentleman and wanted very much to meet you two as I've told him so much about you.\" \"Hello there, young fellow,\" the old gentleman said as he shook Elliot's hand. He spoke in a noticeable German accent. \"I hear you are a very bright and inquisitive young man. Your name is Elliot Taylor, right?\" Elliot nodded and smiled and then Meisner turned to E.T. \"And you no doubt are E.T. the extra-terrestrial who I've heard so highly about from our friend Keys here.\" He reached down and patted E.T. on the head in very friendly manner. \"I must say you sure are cute my dear little friend,\" he said in a courteous voice. \"Now,\" he said in a more formal and buisnesslike tone, \"I've come to see you because I have a small favor to ask of you. I need yours and especially E.T.'s permission to run some tests on him for purely technical research purposes only. I promise there will be nothing that will harm him in my care and it will be just like when you Elliot go to the doctor for checkup.\" Elliot looked from Meisner to Keys and then to E.T. and then back to Meisner again. \"Alright,\" he said finally. \"As long as you promise not to let anything hurt him.\" \"I promise,\" said Meisner. \"You have my word. Cross my heart.\" So they all got into the SUV and drove out to the Medical Clinic where E.T. first had his blood drawn and Elliot held his hand all through it. He then had a EKG scan in which he laid down flat on a board while wires and tubes were attached to him up to his neck as a machine photographed his insides. Then Meisner touched a cotton swab into his mouth and took a slight sampling of his saliva from his tongue. Then finally he was placed underneath a highly sophisticated machine with a large helmet attached to his forehead as pictures were taken of everything inside his head, namely his brain. \"There, that will be all,\" said Meisner at the end of the day. \"Thank you very much for your cooperation, E.T..\" He patted E.T. lightly on the head and then shook hands with Keys and Elliot and then they went their separate ways. Meisner went into a private laboratory in which all the lights were turned off and he locked the door securely to ensure his privacy. He then took from his back pocket a walkie talkie and turned it on and spoke into it in a low whisper. \"Chief, this is Meisner. Come in chief. Over,\" he said in a voice with a distinctly American accent. \"Roger deputy,\" came an equally low voice from the walkie talkie. \"So, tell me, what did you find out about the alien?\" \"We did all the tests on him, sir,\" he replied gleefully. \"We did the catscan and you wouldn't believe it about his brain. It's the size and shape of a ripe grapefruit and slightly smaller than a human's and yet his neurons are even more dense than that of Einstein's and it has these peculiar canals running through it which seem to process some kind of mental energy waves. I wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't seen it, but I have the test results to prove it!\" \"Ah! Excellent!\" came his chief's deviously enthusiastic voice. \"If what you're telling me is indeed true than his brain is a true universal treasure and it should be worth a fortune!\" \"A fortune! Why I'd be willing to bet all the money in the world on it!\" Meisner replied with a low chuckle. The chief returned the chuckle. \"So how is that fellow everyone calls Keys? Does he like you alright?\" \"Oh yeah! The poor fool really thinks I'm a professor who went to the same University as he did! The fake degree really pulled it off, and the accent went over well too!\" here he impersonated the German accent. \"Very good,\" said the chief. \"And what about the boy?\" \"He is so naïve it's adorable!\" he laughed. \"It seems his mom never taught him to never trust strangers who ask for favors!\" \"Somehow that doesn't surprise me!\" the chief laughed with a hint of triumph. \"Well, I'd better go now,\" he said. \"I'll talk to you again when I get some more information on how to go about our business.\" He turned off the walkie talkie and quietly unlocked the door and walked out of the laboratory.[Chapter 5] The very next time Keys went to the lab Meisner approached him and said, \"Keys, my dear friend, may I borrow E.T. again for further experimenting... I mean examining?\" \"I'm terribly sorry, Meisner,\" Keys said regretfully. \"I am going away for a while on a camping trip with Mary and the kids and E.T. really wants to come too, and the kids are really excited so I can't break my promises to them. You understand, don't you?\" \"Why of course I do,\" replied Meisner, hiding his inner turmoil.\"May I ask where it is you will be camping?\" \"Near Mount Shasta by Clear Creek,\" Keys replied unsuspecting. \"Ah! I see!\" said Meisner smiling. \"Very good Keys. I hope you all have a great time on your trip, a very great time.\" \"Thank you very much, old friend,\" said Keys and went on his way. As soon as Keys was out of sight and range Meisner took the walkie talkie from his pocket and turned it and began speaking into it. \"Hello chief, it's Meisner. I just found out Keys is taking E.T. and the rest of the creature's guardians on a camping spree to Mount Shasta by Clear Creek.\" \"Alright,\" said his boss coolly. \"I trust you have a plan now?\" \"I do indeed,\" Meisner replied with a catlike smile. \"This will be just like taking candy from a baby... or rather giving it to an ignorant alien.\" he chuckled gleefully. The SUV rode down the hillside as smoothly as could be expected with Keys in the front seat driving it with Mary sitting beside him in the passenger seat and a double backseat behind them of three singing kids and an extra-terrestrial trying to sing along with them. \" John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith! His name is my name too! Whenever I go out the people always shout 'There goes John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith'! \" They sang Old MacDonald Had a Farm , Pop Goes the Weasel , and finally A' Camping We Will Go . After an hour or so they all grew impatient. \"Are we there yet?\" asked Elliot. \"Just a few more hills and we'll be there,\" Keys assured him. Then \"Oh no!\" for they had just driven up to a roadblock which had orange cone shaped objects positioning it for a few feet with a big orange sign in front which road \"Road Closed for Construction Up Ahead.\" \"Looks like we're stuck,\" Keys lamented as the kids in the groaned and whimpered. However just then E.T. leaned forward and reached out his long arm and stuck his long glowing fingertip into the ignition and they instantly felt themselves being lifted off of the ground and into the air, floating higher and higher above the treetops. \"Well, I guess you can always count on E.T. in a sticky situation!\" Elliot exclaimed happily. Keys drove the van forward as they flew above the woods and saw beautiful scenery far below them. Keys couldn't think when he had felt so pleasured in his life, to actually be flying. He had heard about how E.T. had made the bicycles fly and now he knew the thrilling sensation of it as he drove his flying SUV. \"This is just like in the movie Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang !\" Michael exclaimed laughing with ecstasy. They all began singing the theme from that movie. Then after a half hour Keys pointed to a clear space in the woods far below them and exclaimed, \"This is the place, right here. You can bring us down now,\" he said to E.T.. They floated slowly and gently down to the ground again, landing with only a slight bump. They all got up and Keys went around to the back of the SUV and unloaded their supplies including their tents and sleeping bags which they laid on the ground. As Keys was putting the first tent, they're were two, one for the men and one for the women, he began to talk again about the pleasures of camping out. \"We'll go on a hike as soon as we're set up. It'll be so much fun! There's all kinds of things you can see on a hike through the woods like animals, and some things you have to watch out for like poison ivy; and who knows, we may even run into a sasquatch!\" \"What in the world is a sasquatch?\" asked Gertie. \"It's also known as a bigfoot,\" Keys explained. \"A friend of mine who is a psychologist reported to me to have seen one on an expedition of his. He said it was an eight foot tall hairy ape like creature and it had large red eyes and it walked almost like a human on two legs and it had the eeriest, most unusual kind of animal call you'd ever hear.\" \"Cool,\" said Elliot fascinated. \"Have you ever seen one yourself?\" \"No, though I sure would like to,\" Keys replied. \"But I thought Bigfoot was just a legend,\" said Michael a bit confused. \"That it wasn't real.\" \"Well, remember extra-terrestrials weren't real either until you met E.T.,\" Elliot pointed out. Once everything had been set up and they had marked their area they set off on their nature hike with Keys taking the lead and E.T. riding in Elliot's backpack on his shoulders, it was no problem as he only weighed thirty-five pounds. Along the trail they saw many interesting plants which E.T. was able to out the names of, and they saw many animals through the trees nearby including a family of squirrels gathering nuts, a does with two fawns, a robin in high redwood tree building a nest, and a red fox with a white tail. They hiked on through most of the day and the sun was just beginning to set when they got back to their campsite where Keys built a campfire for them out of sticks and stones and dry leaves and then they all began roasting marshmallows and passing along stories. \"The little boy was now lost and he cried for his mother though he was sure no one could hear him,\" Keys was saying. \"But suddenly he saw two glowing red eyes staring at him through the darkness from in-between the trees and he heard a very strange growl. 'Who's there?' he asked and out of the woods stepped none other than sasquatch himself. The little boy wanted to be afraid of him but right now he was even more afraid of being lost and he pleaded with the beast with tears running down his cheeks, 'Please, can you help me find my way home?.' The sasquatch somehow seemed to nod and pointed upward and the little boy looked up and he saw a star which he remembered was called the North Star and he followed it until it led him all the way home.\" Everyone around the campfire clapped. \"That was a very good story,\" said Gertie. \"I liked it. E.T. bit into his toasted marshmallow on the end of his stick and then stuck his tongue out. \"Too hot!\" he complained. Then Michael told a story about a haunted house and then E.T. told them stories about the various kinds of people he had seen on the various planets he and his companions had visited around the universe. Then they all turned in for the night and got into the tents and tucked themselves into their sleeping bags. E.T. was almost asleep when he suddenly heard a noise coming from just outside of the tent and feeling slightly worried for the safety of his family he crawled out of his sleeping bag and went out to investigate. He looked around but could see absolutely nothing in the dark of night, and then he looked down at the ground and spotted something small, round, and yellow shining in the moonlight. He thought he recognized it. He picked it up and put it in his mouth and bit down on it and found he was right. It was Reese's Pieces! He looked down and found another one and then another one and he picked up each one and popped them into his mouth. He saw more and more the farther he went, there was a whole trail of them. He followed the trail as he ate it up and eventually when he was good distance away from the campsite he found the half empty bag of candy laying on the ground just waiting to be found. He reached out to take it but was cut off when it was snatched from his grasp by a large hand which came from out of nowhere. He gulped nervously as he looked up and saw a human being standing before him which he recognized as Professor Meisner whom Keys had introduced him to. For a moment he was relieved but that moment was quite short as he saw the malicious grin that spread across the man's face and the menacing look he had in his eyes. \"Didn't your mother tell you not to take free candy?\" he said mockingly in his real accent. He grabbed E.T. by the neck and picked him up as he slapped a thick bandage of duct tape over the alien's mouth and then tied up his arms with thick electric wires so that if E.T. tried to break free he would be shocked. Meisner took out his walkie talkie and spoke into it. \"Okay boss, I got the alien just like I said I would!\" \"Excellent!\" replied the boss. \"Bring him to the lab. I will meet you there in an hour.\" E.T. knew he had just been tricked and betrayed and he screamed and even though his mouth was taped shut the sound pierced through the night and it was carried to far and away.[Chapter 6] Elliot awoke with a start. He could have sworn he'd heard a scream, a very inhuman scream... rather like E.T's. He sat up in his sleeping bag and looked around the tent he was in. \"E.T.?\" he called. But E.T. was nowhere in sight. He saw Keys and Michael laying asleep in their own sleeping bags but E.T.'s was empty, and then Elliot realized the scream he had heard had most definitely come from E.T.. \"Keys! Mike! Wake up!\" he exclaimed as he jumped on top of them. \"Hmm... Elliot what's the idea!\" Keys groaned groggy and misty eyed as it was the middle of the night. \"E.T. is gone! I can't find him anywhere!\" Elliot yelled loudly. \"What?!\" Michael exclaimed much upset for he remembered how he he had found E.T. the last time he had been lost in the woods. \"He is!\" Keys exclaimed in realization of E.T.'s lone sleeping bag. \"Come on, let's look for him!\" The three of them rushed outside and began running around through the trees yelling \"E.T.! E.T.!\" \"E.T!\" Where are you!\" Elliot yelled out to the darkness of the night. \"E.T. answer me!\" he cried out almost in tears. \"E.T. come back to me!\" Elliot stood there and thought about E.T. and how much he loved him and all of the good times they'd had together and all the times E.T. had helped him especially now and he knew he would do anything for E.T. just as he would for him. \"E.T.,\" he whispered. \"Tell me where you are... I'll do anything for you.\" Meanwhile E.T. was laying tied and gagged in the trunk of Meisner's vehicle and he had been thinking that all was lost but now he felt the light inside his heart coming on casting a faint red glow in the darkness surrounding him and he heard Elliot's voice within himself. \" E.T... Tell me where you are... I'll do anything for you.\" E.T. felt his fear subside as he was consumed with Elliot's love and loyalty to him, and he couldn't speak verbally at the moment but in his mind he transmitted back, Elliot... I am all alone in the dark and I can't move or barely breath... Someone bad is taking me to somewhere I'm sure I don't want to be... Please come for me... please... In the midst of the woods Elliot heard E.T.'s voice inside of him and he got his message. Now filled with urgency he ran up to Keys and grabbed him by the wrist. \"E.T. is in trouble and he needs our help! Come on!\" he exclaimed jumping up and down. Keys knew by now he had to trust Elliot especially when it came to E.T., and so did Michael and so they followed his lead and piled into the SUV and drove swiftly down the road. \"Tell me, Elliot,\" Keys said. \"Did you hear E.T. somehow? Did he tell you where he was?\" \"He's in a very dark place and he can't move and a bad guy has him and is taking him some place he doesn't want to be,\" Elliot replied, remembering E.T.'s message as best he could. \"Well, have you at least some notion of where they were taking him?\" Keys asked hopefully. Elliot thought hard for a moment, trying to remember which direction he could feel E.T.'s message coming from \"That way!\" he responded pointing in a Northwesterly direction. So Keys drove at the speed limit in the direction Elliot pointed out and hoped they would be there before any happened to E.T.. Meanwhile, Meisner had just drove up to the secret laboratory and went around to the back of his car and lifted the hood and grabbed onto E.T. who squirmed and wriggled in his arms only to receive an electric shock from the wires entangling him and he cried out in pain from behind the duct tape over his mouth. \"Shut up and hold still!\" Meisner shouted at him as he punched the helpless alien in the jaw to silence him. At the same time in Keys SUV Elliot suddenly started trembling and convulsing as if he were having a seizure and he also put a hand up to his jaw and winced in pain. \"Elliot, what's wrong?\" Michael asked in great concern. \"I-It-It's E... T...!\" Elliot exclaimed trying in vain to steady himself. \"S-Someone is h-hurting him now!\" \"Not if I can help it!\" Keys declared as he suddenly accelerated the speed of the SUV. He was now going past the speed limit but he didn't care, not if E.T.'s life could be at stake. As they sped onward a policeman in a car parked at the side of the road took notice of them and promptly spoke into his walkie talkie. \"Sarge, I've got a speeder spotted at North ridge going 60 to 70 miles per hour. I'm on his leak! Over!\" The police officer then turned on his siren as he sped off after Keys' SUV. Meanwhile back at the lab Meisner had brought E.T. inside and was now fastening him to a long iron board. He then took a black marker and drew a circle of lines around E.T.'s head and then pulled the duct tape off of his mouth and before E.T. could cry out he stuck a tube down his throat and then poured a liquid through it which tasted so bad E.T.'s eyes watered up as his throat ached and burned as badly as if it were really on fire. Meisner then found what looked like a very large pair of tweezers and with them he forcefully extended E.T.'s neck to its full length and then left them clipped at the top of E.T's throat so he couldn't bring his neck down again. In the racing SUV Elliot suddenly gagged loudly and clutched at his throat as if someone were trying to strangle him. \"E.T.'s is in big trouble!\" he exclaimed in a voice hoarse and pained. \"Someone is wanting to murder him! We have to hurry!\" Keys needed no further explanation as he suddenly revved up the engine of the SUV and with a loud screeching of its tires it zoomed on through the night and was now clearly out of the woods and nearing its destination. The officer in the police car also sped up some as he spoke into his transmitter with urgency. \"Sarge, the speeder is now driving like a madman at approximately 100 miles per hour! When I catch him, Sarge, I promise you he won't hear the end of his recklessness! Over!\" The SUV reached its destination arriving at the secret laboratory and its three riders leapt out and ran for the front door which they broke down with brute force and then rushed inside. They were not a moment too soon for it was now that Meisner was lowering something that looked like the blade on a medieval guillotine down onto E.T.'s head when they suddenly burst through the front entrance. \"Stop right there!\" Keys shouted and then stopped and froze in shock. \"Meisner? What are you doing with E.T.?\" \"Keys?\" Meisner exclaimed so shocked he forgot to use his fake German accent. \"What does it look like I'm doing with him? \"It looks like you're trying to kill him,\" Keys replied eying the razor sharp edged blade about to come down on E.T.'s head. \"No! Nonsense!\" Meisner insisted. \"Our alien friend is afflicted with a terminal disease and I am trying to cure him!\" \"Mr. Meisner,\" Elliot said. \"I thought you were a good man, but you're not! You were faking it just like you were faking your accent!\" \"You can't hurt E.T.!\" Michael exclaimed furiously. \"What did he ever do to you?\" \"Keys, if you'll only listen to me,\" Meisner said. \"He is an alien, he is not one of us, so it will not be wrong to remove his brain especially since he'll be dead soon, and if you promise not to tell a soul about my little deception I will gladly share the fortune that it will bring with all of you!\" Keys felt rage take over him as he now felt more hatred for this con man before him than he had ever felt for anyone, if anyone at all, and he instantly lunged forward and struck Meisner a blow to the head which knocked him unconscious on the spot. As Meisner lay sprawled on the floor Elliot and Michael jumped into action and began untying E.T.'s bindings that held him down and helpless. Elliot pulled the tube out of his mouth and with a bit of difficulty he managed to free his neck from the tool that was choking it. \"E.T,\" Elliot said with deep sorrow. \"I'm so sorry. I had no idea!\" \"You've no need to feel bad,\" E.T. assured him. \"Were all deceived by him on the floor.\" The four of them exited the lab and stepped outside only to be met with a very irritated looking police officer holding out a large ticket in his left hand. \"What on Earth were you fellas doing driving twice the speed limit around here!? Do you not realize you could have killed somebody.\" \"I apologize, good officer,\" Keys said respectfully. \"But I had to for if we didn't get here just now he would have been killed by a very wicked man who is now laying in there, and he is the one who should be charged for his actions really.\" \"Which one of you was he trying to harm?\" the officer asked as he looked to Elliot and Michael. \"Him,\" Elliot said pointing downward. The officer looked down and on spotting E.T., who held a slightly sweet smile on his face as he looked up at him, his jaw dropped and so did the ticket in his hand.[Chapter 7] The day of the court hearing arrived. Keys entered the courtroom with the Taylor family close behind him along with a throng of spectators. They all took their seats and sat quietly for a while until the judge entered. \"All rise!\" said the bailiff. \"You may sit,\" he said a moment later as the judge took his place behind his desk. \"The court is now in session!\" the bailiff said loudly. \"The case of the Keys Space Agency for Extra-Terrestrial Life Forms versus Ed Meisner on charges of attempting to harm a real extra-terrestrial. The honorable Judge Harper presiding!\" Just then Meisner was brought into the room in between two officers, his hands were cuffed in front of him, his face held a petulant scowl as he was brought in front of the bailiff. \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you?\" the bailiff asked him. \"I do,\" he replied with a slight smirk on his face. He took his seat in the witness box. The judge banged lightly onto his desk with his gavel. \"You, Ed Meisner, have been accused of harming an extra-terrestrial life form. Is this true?\" \"Well, that all depends on what you mean,\" Meisner said pervasively. \"I wouldn't have actually been harming the thing.\" \"Answer the question, yes or no!\" the judge demanded sternly. \"Well, then yes,\" Meisner replied irritably. \"Can you tell us what your intention was?\" inquired the judge. \"To get to its brain for it was highly unusually intelligent brain of colossal proportions. It would have made me a world- renowned researcher.\" Meisner stated plainly. \"But why would you want to kill the creature in the first is I'm sure what we would all like to know,\" the judge continued. \"I mean after all, what did it ever do to you?\" \"Well, nothing to me, per se?\" Meisner admitted grudgingly. \"But haven't extra-terrestrials been known to abduct innocent humans from their beds and to experiment on them against their will also, and manipulate their brains so that they lose most of their sanity for the rest of their miserable lives?\" \"There have been reports of such things occurring, but there hasn't been enough evidence yet to prove such things have actually happened,\" the judge stated matter-of-factly. \"But they have happened!\" Meisner insisted, turning very red in the face. \"For I have known them to happen in my own family and among my friends and co-workers!\" \"Regardless of whether it is true or not,\" said the judge. \"It doesn't prove the extra-terrestrial in question here to be one of them as reports from the Keys Agency have shown otherwise, or perhaps you would like to hear from them again. I call Mr. Tedrow Garrison, also known as 'Keys' to the stand!\" Keys now stood and walked to the head of the room where he took his place in the witness box after being sworn in by the bailiff. \"Mr. Garrison,\" addressed the judge. \"You met with the extra-terrestrial in question first, true?\" \"Yes, Your Honor,\" replied Keys. \"Can you tell us what actually took place at that time?\" asked the judge. \"Yes, Your Honor,\" began Keys. \"Me and my colleagues of the time were investigating a UFO sighting three years ago on the night of October twenty-seventh, 1982. We encountered a glowing red light and we saw the shape of an unknown creature which we soon knew was the extra-terrestrial life-form we had all been looking for.\" \"And did this creature show any sign of wanting to harm you or your colleagues in any way?\" inquired the judge. \"No, Your Honor,\" replied Keys honestly. \"None whatsoever. It just let a very unearthly scream and ran away from us with a strange lumbering gait. We followed after it but it was too fast for us to catch. And then we suddenly looked up and watched as the Spaceship lifted off of the ground and disappeared into the sky. We searched all through the woods for the creature for days but we could find no trace of it.\" \"But you did eventually track its whereabouts into the home of a family by the name of Taylor, correct?\" inquired the judge further. \"Yes, we did, Your Honer,\" asserted Keys. \"We set up a homing device around the neighborhood just beyond the woods and found signs of unusual activity in the Taylor home and as soon as we had the chance we invaded the house and set up a quaraintine unit around it for he didn't know of what effect the extra-terrestrial's existence could have on a human's health. I admit most of this was my colleagues idea and not nine for I realize now we should have spoken to the family personally before we entered and we were also probably being overly cautious with our procedures.\" \"And I heard you found the extra-terrestrial in the house and it was at that time terminally ill?\" inquired the judge. \"Yes, correct, Your Honor,\" said Keys. \"We didn't know what to do for the creature and so we just looked him over in every place, and we found some startling finds as we did so, for instance he has DNA in much the same manner as a human-being does and also all his senses function in the same manner as ours do too.\" \"Very interesting,\" said the judge. \"And I heard, and correct me if I am wrong, that the creature actually died and was then resurrected?\" \"Yes, you heard right, Your Honor,\" replied Keys. \"I don't much understand it myself, and perhaps I will never understand it, but I did hear from a reliable source it may well have been the boy, Elliot Taylor's love for the being that brought it back.\" After a long pause in thought the judge said, \"Well, I have to admit I have never heard of such a thing before, but then this is a very unusual case in itself.\" \"I understand your confusion, Your Honor,\" said Keys. \"I think perhaps you should hear Elliot's side of the story, it really enlightened me when I first heard it.\" \"Very well then,\" said the judge. \"I call Elliot Taylor to the stand. Elliot stood and walked nervously up to the witness box where he was immediately sworn in. \"Tell me, young man, is this extra-terrestrial a friend of yours?\" asked the judge. \"Yes, he is, Your Honor,\" replied Elliot. \"He is and always will be my best friend in all the universe.\" \"Tell me about how you met him?\" inquired the judge. \"I heard some noises coming from outside one night, I thought it might just be my dog, but when I went to investigate I found E.T., that is what I call the creature, and I was terrified of him but he was even more scared of me and he ran away before I could. The next day a laid out some of my favorite candy, Reese's Pieces for him on my front lawn and backyard and he found them and he came to me. And he seemed so gentle that I just treated him the way my mom always told me to treat someone in need, and I fed him and clothed him and bathed him, and I even let him sleep in my robe in my closet. I admit I lied about being sick to skip school the next day so I could learn more about him, and then when I told my brother and sister about him I made them promise to not tell our mom about him, you see at the time I wasn't sure if I could trust her with him or not.\" \"I understand,\" said the judge. \"I might have acted the same way if it had been me in your place at your age. Tell me more.\" \"I wanted to keep E.T. for a pet at first,\" admitted Elliot. \"But then he began to make it clear to us he wanted to go back to his own planet, his own home. And so we helped him to build a transmitter out of old things around the house which would be of use, and on Halloween night we put it out in the woods and tried to call his people to come get him. The next day was when E.T. became very sick and Keys and his colleagues came into our house, I'd never been more scared in my life then, partly because I was as sick as E.T. was.\" \"But how could that be?\" asked the Judge curiously. \"Well, I can't really explain it exactly,\" admitted Elliot. \"But it's like me and have have our souls connected and everything that he feels I feel too. I don't think what is going on his mind, you understand, I feel whatever is going on in his heart like joy and sadness. I can feel them just as if they're my own. And when E.T. seemed to die I stopped feeling them, then I suddenly felt a spark inside of me and that was when he came back to life.\" \"Hmm... Very interesting indeed,\" said the judge thoughtfully. \"Tell me, has E.T. ever exhibited any other wondrous abilities besides telekinesis?\" \"He can levitate objects, and he took me flying on my bicycle once,\" recalled Elliot. \"And he can talk to plants and help them to grow as he is a botanist on his home planet, and he can also heal wounds. Both physical and mental, I believe. Because he healed a cut on my finger when I nicked it on a circular saw blade we used to build the transmitter, and when I was sad about him leaving me he made me feel better when he touched his finger to my head and promised to be right here for me, and since I've met him I've been more happier than I've ever been, especially after my parents divorced and I thought the world had just ended for me and my family.\" \"I know how you feel,\" said the judge somberly. \"My parents also divorced when I was just about your age and I sure could have used a friend like E.T..\" \"Speaking of which,\" said Elliot. \"I think you should hear E.T.'s side of the story.\" \"Is he here then?\" asked the judge in surprise. \"Yes, he is right outside waiting,\" said Elliot. \"Alright then. Bring in the Extra-Terrestrial,\" the judge commanded. At once the doors were opened and in waddled E.T.. Everyone turned to stare and gasp as he stepped up to the witness box, and E.T. merely smiled sweetly at them all. E.T. was sworn in. \"Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you?\" \"E.T. does,\" he replied, raising his long left hand with the glowing fingertip, which got a few awed gasps from the court. \"I object Your Honor!\" Mesiner said defiantly. \"On what grounds, may I ask?\" inquired the judge. \"E.T., as the court knows, is an alien. Therefore he has no right to speak here!\" \"Aliens are aliens only because we alienate them, and after all I've already heard I do think E.T. has as much a right to speak on his behalf as you and Mr. Tedrow and young Mr. Taylor have. Objection overruled!\" declared the judge with positivity. \"Alright, E.T., what have you to say for yourself?\" asked the judge politely. \"E.T. has been visiting Earth since it was in a young age, my people have watched the rise and fall of mankind, but our main interest has always been in Earth's vegetation which humans are so careless of. And we have collected specimens of all kinds over millions of years and we bring them back to our home to study gently and to preserve for all time.\" \"So you say your main interest in visiting Earth is plant life and not human life?\" asked the judge. \"It was up until three years ago when I met Elliot by pure chance,\" E.T. said, smiling with fond memories. \"I was scared of him at first because he was a human and I had been told of how terribly destructive humans could be, but Elliot was kind to me and he took care of me when I had nowhere to go, and I was even able to get through to him telepathically as I do with my own kind and some others who can receive well. Elliot is a very special person. He is so special I wanted him to come home with me, but he couldn't because his home is here, but I have come back to visit him. I came because he needed me just like needed him before.\" \"So then I trust you would never harm a living soul, plant or human, is that correct?\" inquired the judge. \"Yes, Your Honor,\" replied E.T with certainty. \"My race is of a peaceful nature, it always has been and always will be. If you're looking for destructive aliens look elsewhere in the universe. Some like to have wars among the stars, and some like to mess with humans in the way I was messed with,\" here he gave a severe look towards Meisner. \"But they do so only because they are curious and they don't know they are causing harm because they don't understand how the human mind operates. Though most other species of life are most peaceful and caring and would do anything to aid a fellow planet, if they only knew where to go to.\" \"Well, we at Earth have a lot of problems here,\" said the judge. \"Like disease, war, famine, and drought, and not to mention social injustice. It is hard for us to keep track of it all as we strive to make it better little by little so do you think maybe you could find an alien race that would know how to act fast to rid the world of these thing?\" E.T. smiled very sweetly. \"I will do my best,\" he replied humbly. The judge smiled gratefully and then banged his gavel onto his desk again. \"Ladies and Gentlemen,\" he said, addressing the court. \"In light of what I have heard today, I declare Ed Meisner to be found guilty of all charges and sentenced to twenty years in state prison. And I grant the Keys Agency funding for finding real extra-terrestrial life and I give our friend E.T. the permission to come back and visit us anytime he wishes. Case Dismissed!\" Everyone in the room cheered loudly as Mary and Keys embraced and kissed passionately, and Elliot ran up to E.T. and picked him up in a big hug, while at the same time a scowling Meisner was hauled away in cuffs by the same officers who had brought him in.[Chapter 8] \"So now you've heard the story straight from the source!\" a TV broadcaster exclaimed live. \"There really do exist other life forms out there and we are not alone in the universe and never have been, and now maybe there is hope for us if we stay on the good side of the lovable extra-terrestrial whom Elliot Taylor affectionately calls E.T.. Now other people who have had encounters with alien beings have the strength to come forward with their own story. You'll be hearing about them right after this.\" Michael and Gertie listened to the TV set while Elliot sat nearby playing chess with E.T., something which Keys had taught him to do and he was now teaching his best friend in the universe. \"Your turn now, E.T.,\" said Elliot. E.T. studied the chess set for a long moment in focused concentration, then slowly he levitated one of his knights and moved it over to one of Elliot's queen's. \"Check,\" he said. \"You're getting good at this!\" exclaimed Elliot. Just then they heard the phone ringing. E.T. got off his chair and went to answer it. He took the phone off of its cradle and held it to his ear and mouth. \"Hello?\" he said. \"Hmm... I'll see. Elliot, phone for you,\" he said, holding the phone out for Elliot. Elliot at once got up and took the phone. \"Hello, who is this?\" he asked. \"Hi, Elliot. It's me, Erin from school,\" said Erin on the other line. \"I just wanted to apologize for not believing you about E.T. because I just heard the whole story on TV just now.\" \"It's okay, Erin,\" Elliot assured her. \"I probably wouldn't have believed it myself if I hadn't experienced it myself.\" \"I'd also really like to meet him and get to know him myself, if that's okay with you,\" Erin asked hopefully. \"Sure, I'd love for you to meet him!\" Elliot exclaimed happily. \"But you'll have to come over now because his spaceship is coming for him this evening.\" \"Okay, I'll be right over,\"s he said. Twenty minutes later Erin arrived at Elliot's door. Elliot smiled as he stepped aside, allowing her to come in and then gestured toward E.T. \"Erin, this is E.T., my best friend in the whole universe. E.T., this is Erin from my school.\" Elliot introduced them proudly. \"Hello, Elliot's friend. E.T. very glad to meet you, Erin,\" said E.T. smiling and holding out his glowing fingertip. Erin gasped happily as she ran up to E.T. and threw her arms around him. \"All my life I've wanted to meet a real extra-terrestrial, and I read everything I could find on them. But when Elliot told me about you it seemed too good to be true at first!\" E.T. smiled sweetly and hugged her back, his heart light beaming warm and bright at her pleasure. \"There are so many things I want to know about you!\" exclaimed Erin ecstatically. \"What do you do on your home planet, and what is it called?\" \"E.T.'s home is the Green Planet,\" E.T. replied. \"E.T. is a botanist there and studies plant life througout the universe.\" \"And that was why you came to Earth originally?\" asked Erin, and E.T. nodded. \"We could see that earthly vegetation was in grave danger,\" E.T. explained. \"We weren't quite sure what the problem was, so we decided to gather samples of all the plants that were growing and all the plants that had ever grown.\" \"What could you learn that botanists here don't know already?\" asked Erin curiously. \"Plenty,\" replied E.T. easily. \"You learn a lot about a lot of things when you study them for a few million years.\" \"A few million years?\" Erin repeated. \"Sure,\" said E.T.. \"I'm ten million years old myself.\" \"Well, why haven't you tried to make contact with Earth people before?\" asked Erin. \"We realize that Earth people are very much influenced by how creatures look. We knew that they would find us ugly, at least at first,\" E.T. explained gravely. \"Well, you have to admit that you do look strange,\" Erin observed. \"You're short, pot-bellied, and you have only four fingers.\" \"I'm short by your standards. But where I come from everyone is short because of gravity,\" E.T. explained solemnly. \"I know all about gravity,\" said Erin. \"It's what makes things fall to the ground. But we have gravity here too.\" \"Yes, but you don't have as much as we do,\" said E.T. \"Where I come from the pull of gravity is so strong that it keeps us short and forces a lot of our weight toward our bellies.\" \"Why only four fingers, though?\" inquired Erin curiously. \"Why have five? All we lack is a thumb, which we don't need,\" replied E.T. simply. \"Why not?\" asked Erin. \"We don't hitchhike,\" replied E.T. with a chuckle. \"Oh. Very Funny,\" Erin smiled. \"But tell me, why did you trust Elliot?\" \"Maybe because he was a child who hadn't yet learned to distrust creatures because of how they look... and perhaps it was because I needed a friend, and so did he,\" replied E.T. thoughtfully. Erin smiled over at Elliot who said, \"E.T. can help plants to grow ten times faster than they normally do. We'll show you if you come out to the garden with us.\" So Erin followed E.T. and Elliot outside into Mary's vegetable garden where they saw long stalks of corn and vines with tomatoes growing on them. E.T. stepped forward and lit his left forefinger and whispered \"Grow, my sweet veggies. Grow to your fullest prime for all to see.\" And they did. The corn stalks lifted themselves up and their leaves revealed golden shining ears of corn, and the tomatoes became redder and fuller and juicer looking. \"That's... fantastic!\" exclaimed Erin in awe. Just then Elliot noticed the sun was beginning to set over the horizon and knew just what this meant. \"E.T.'s companions will be here for him soon. We'll have to take my bike to the forest to reach them in time,\" he said seriously. \"Please can I come with you to see the spaceship?\" pleaded Erin eagerly. \"Okay,\" said Elliot. Elliot put E.T. in the basket of his bicycle and after he seated himself onto it Erin got on behind him and held tightly to his shoulders. Elliot had barely started pedaling when the wheels of the bycycle slowly lifted up off of the ground and they rose lightly into the air. \"What is happening now?\" exclaimed Erin in surprise. \"Relax,\" Elliot assured her. \"E.T. knows what he is doing as he's done this before.\" They rose high above the treetops and flew gracefully across the setting sun which shined the last of its glow as they reached the forest's clearing below them. E.T. brought them down very gently. Soon the clouds above them parted and the great mothership appeared in all its glory for them to see. As the spaceship landed Elliot turned to E.T. and embraced him. \"I know I asked this the last time, but I want to know when I will see you again?\" E.T. smiled and Elliot detected a hint of sadness in his smile. \"You will not be needing me for a long time after now,\" he said very solemnly. \"But remember I will always be right here,\" he promised as he pointed his glowing finger at Elliot's heart. He then looked at both Elliot and Erin and said to them both, \"You two stay by each other's side. You will need each other in years to come. You are both the most special people I know.\" Then E.T. climbed up the gangplank to his spaceship and stood at the entrance where he waved goodbye to them until he could no longer be seen in view. They watched the spaceship lift off of the ground and zoom away into the star lit night sky again, leaving behind a rainbow in its wake as always. As Elliot looked at the rainbow, wistfully wondering what E.T. could have meant, he suddenly felt a very warm sensation run through his being as Erin leaned over and kissed him on the cheek and whispered, \"You are the best boy I've ever known, Elliot Taylor.\" ","Summary":" April 16, 1985 Elliot Taylor sat at his desk in Astronomy class paying rapt attention to his teache"},{"Movie":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","Title":"ET V: Revolution and Unity","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10394747","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: This story is about a colony of superior aliens and what they may think of us if they are out there. I assure you that E.T. and his friends will come in soon enough also.[Chapter 2] A large disk shaped object with a protruding middle hovered just above the Earth's atmosphere in space. Inside of it the Herods looked out over their target and studied it through a mighty telescope to figure their destination. \"Now that I look at it, the Earth is really quite beautiful if also quite wasted in appearance,\" remarked one of the pilots. \"Just keep looking,\" ordered the Herod leader. \"We are here for the inhabitants and then we'll see what we can do about their measly planet afterward.\" So the pilot continued to gaze into the telescope's eye and finally he exclaimed. \"I've found them! The very perfect starting point!\" \"Let me see,\" said the leader as he came over to the telescope and looked through it. In the optically enlarged vision of the telescope's eye he saw a large number of human beings of all ages and races dressed in their best and walking into a large white building with a high tower with a golden cross on it. They watched as they gathered inside and through their highly advanced sonar they could hear them singing. \"WAA-AAAAAAAA-AAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLCCCCCCCKKK -WITH ME – LAAAAAAA-AAAAAA-AAAAAWWWWWWDDDDDD!\" an old lady was heard squawking like an overgrown, overweight hen. The Herods listened in as a man with a deep and nasally voice began to speak to them loudly and obnoxiously. \"I welcome all of you here on this blessed day for no reason. I've spoken with our Mighty God, even though I can't see him, of course, and he says he is not pleased with all of us. He wants us to be the way he wants us to be, and not the way we want ourselves to be, or else he is not going to take us to Heaven. He loves us so much that he wants us to give up on our dreams and not think for ourselves and instead let him do all of the thinking, for we all know that the only thoughts and dreams we could have would be given to us by the devil, because none of us possess the ability to do any good without God.\" \"Here is what you must do, you must pray to God every day for at least twelve hours, you must not do or say anything without bringing God into it, you must only the bible, you must only watch movies that have God in them. Most importantly, you must hate yourself as much as possible, for if you are content with yourself, God will not be able to mold your pathetic selves into something useful and good. As it is clearly stated the holy bible, you are all absolutely nothing but dirt which cannot be molded unless wet and God is the Almighty Potter! Sing it!\" They all began to sing, \"Thou art the potter, I am the clay!\" The preacher concluded his sermon. \"I am sure you all realize by now that if you all were to die right now you would as sure as hell, go to Hell, for you are your own greatest enemy. You could get yourself cracked and be nothing more than an imperfect clay pot, and just as no one will buy an imperfect clay pot, God will never welcome you into His Kingdom if you are cracked. Amen.\" The Herods had listened to all of this with growing agony until they couldn't stand it anymore. \"Make them stop! Make them stop!\" shouted the leader. \"With pleasure, sir!\" responded the pilot. He dialed a series of buttons and a giant sized circular object which resembled a satellite opened up from the bottom of the space ship as it hovered over the tiny building building far below it. A long object protruded from the center of the satellite which resembled a largely imposed rifle and a hole slowly opened up in the eye of the gun and a long needle like pointer came out of it and was aimed directly at the center of the roof of the building as a red beam shot out from it and traveled down to its target. The Herods watched through their spy camera surveillance as the people in the building who all had their heads bowed and their eyes closed and their hands folded in front of them remained completely oblivious while the beam found them and zapped around them and in a second they had all but vanished from the place. The Herods watched as they all reappeared within the domain of their ship and looked up and glanced around with the most puzzled looks on their faces. \"Step one accomplished!\" declared the leader triumphantly. \"Now for step two.\" \"Right onto it, sir!\" agreed the commander as he and a number of other Herods went to deal with the abducted humans. \"Sir, what are we to do about the construction down there?\" inquired one. \"I mean, there will be no need for any places of worship once we're done with our mission now will there?\" \"Yes, a very good point indeed,\" agreed the leader. Then after thinking on it for a moment he replied, \"Well, let's just deconstruct them then shall we?\" \"With pleasure, sir!\" agreed the others. Then the same laser gun in the same satellite object was aimed at the white building and another beam was fired at it. This one struck the cross on the tower and for a moment it seemed nothing was happening and then all of a sudden the whole of the building exploded in flames and rubble. The hapless humans on board the ship meanwhile we're all looking at each other in confusion and gazing at their surroundings in curiosity. \"Where are we?\" asked one of them. \"I don't know,\" replied another. \"But for a moment ago I thought I felt myself leave my body... so maybe this is Heaven!\" \"Heaven? Why I never thought of Heaven as looking so gray and sterile,\" said the man in white. Just then the Herods entered the quarters and stood facing the humans with an almost curious look in their large insectlike eyes. \"Oh dear! This must be the other place!\" exclaimed the overweight woman. \"For here are demons!\" The Herods narrowed their eyes at them and then took from behind their backs objects which resembled a physician's syringe and a hunter's rifle. \"You will now have all of the thoughts within your brains removed along with all the memories which come with them. This is a painless operation. Please stand still.\" And so saying they all aimed their handheld devices at the humans heads and clicked on a button on the side of them and a beam of yellow energy zigzagged out of their tips and met with the foreheads of every last human in the room. Within seconds the faces of every human went blank and expressionless and they stood as still as statues as though petrified. Meanwhile the Herods maneuvered their ship to hover over another area of the Earth. This time focusing their satellite on a large golden building with two domes protruding from it. And they listened to what was being said and heard from inside. \"Fellow Muslims! Things turn upside-down when those who follow destructive and erroneous sects and beliefs falsely assume that theirs is the true faith and that the good ending and future belongs exclusively to them. But the fact that men of reason and understanding do not dispute is that, the future belongs to this religion of Islam; that it shall prevail over all other beliefs, for it is the only true religion that Allah has perfected for His slaves and with which He has completed His favour upon them and which that He has chosen for them as religion.\" \"The future belongs to Islam for it is the religion with which Allah raised the status of man and honoured him. He informed us in His Speech, which is the most-truthful of all speech, that He created man with His two Hands, breathed of His soul in him and made the angels prostrate before him. He honoured man by subjecting him to His worship Alone, for there is no deity worthy of worship except Him, glorified are His Names and Attributes. He honoured him by subjecting all that is in heavens and earth to him and gave him innumerable other blessings.\" \"The future belongs to Islam because it is the only religion that's message is characterised by pure monotheism and that agrees with the laws of nature and sound opinion. It is through Islam that Allah made lawful for His slaves all good and useful things and prohibited all filthy and harmful matters. Removed from this ummah are the heavy burden and fetters that were upon those who came before them; such as strictness in matters of religion like the imposition of self-killing as an atonement for sin, cutting the part of the human-body used for committing an impure act, purifying the cloth by cutting off the place of filth with scissors, compulsory implementation of the law of equity in murder cases (with no option of paying blood money or pardon whether the killing was intentional or accidental) and prohibition of taking war booty.\" Then just as they had done before the Herods brought out their satellite with the laser gunlike object in the middle and aimed it directly at the golden dome shaped building and zapped a red beam at it which teleported all of the humans inside to their ship. They then sent out a second beam which destroyed the golden domed building completely. They observed the humans this time were dressed extremely differently than the previous ones. The men were all bearded and wore turbans on their heads and the women all wore cloth veils around theirs. Though in spite of the vast difference in appearance they all looked around with the same astonishment as the others had. \"Where are we?\" one of them spoke. \"Where has Allah brought us to now?\" \"I would assume paradise,\" replied another one. \"But I don't see any virgins, do you?\" Just then the Herods repeated their operation with their special ray guns and zapped out all thoughts and memories from the minds of these humans also.[Chapter 3] It was a clear and starry night and Peter Parkinson came out of his house on 121 Maple Lane in Maryland to look at the stars through his telescope which was positioned in his backyard. Peter was a very bright, intelligent and inquisitive fifteen year old. He was well liked around his neighborhood, was respected in school and always got straight A's. He was also adored by his parents who did all they could to satisfy him in his longing for knowledge, particularly in astronomy which was his best and favorite subject of all and so his telescope had been a present on his last birthday. He held the telescope upward and looked through its eye and gazed in awe at all of the many tiny twinkling stars he could see within the dark blue sky. He often wondered what it would be like to fly to one of the stars and leave the Earth far behind and see other worlds and see how they compared to this one. He decided to zoom in on one of the stars in the milky way, and as he did so he suddenly saw a peculiar sight. It looked like a bright round shooting star with a long tail at the end and it seemed to be heading towards Earth. He drew back from his telescope and looked up at the sky rubbing his eyes to make sure he had not been mistaken in what he had seen. Could it be he had just discovered a new comet or asteroid perhaps? He looked into the telescope again and tried to find the comet but it was nowhere to be seen now. Had it perhaps just been a trick of the lens flare? Then he suddenly felt there was something coming up from behind him. He heard a faint humming noise which made the hair on the back of his neck stand up and his spine tingle. He glanced over his shoulder, and saw a bright round light hovering in the sky high above him. As he watched it it drew slowly closer until it was positioned directly over him and his house. Now that he could see it better he saw that it was oval shaped like a saucer and it was a dark blue color with a green ring around it. It took him a few moments to realize what he was seeing, and then he knew. It was a spaceship! Then suddenly a great beam of white light appeared from out of the bottom center of the spaceship and shined down directly onto him. It was so brilliant he had to shield his eyes from it. Then he suddenly felt something pulling at him, like a magnetic force field and his feet seemed to be slowly hovering off of the ground. It took a moment for him to realize what was happening to him and when he did he wanted to scream but found he couldn't. His body was lifted up from the ground as though the gravity were vanishing. He tried to grab onto his telescope for support but it was no use and he was pulled forcefully upward into the beam of light which sucked him into the spaceship in the small opening hole in the bottom. Inside the spaceship he popped up and fell down on his stomach as the beam dispersed itself. He stood up rigidly and rubbed at his side. He looked all around him and he found himself standing in a barren room which was made of some kind of material that was neither metal nor glass. Then he saw a group of short people with big heads and small bodies with thin limbs and beady black eyes coming towards him and once he again he felt he wanted to scream but found he just couldn't. \"Who are you guys? What's going on here? Why have you taken me?\" he asked, his questions tumbling out in a jumble. The alien in the front center spoke up. \"Greetings my young Earthling friend. You have nothing to worry about, quite the contrary you should be most honored that you will be among the first of the human race to be reestablished on Asteroid 962.\"[Chapter 4] Tedrow Garrison was also known as Keys because of his having every key to everywhere in the building of the company he worked for which was the Northern California Search and Research Foundation for Extra-Terrestrial Life. Tonight he was by himself looking through their telescope searching to see if he could find anything unusual since there had been reports of unusual activity in the Earth's atmosphere lately. He had been looking for a long time now and he was just about to quit for tonight when suddenly he spotted a most unusual thing. It was a large shiny round object. It wasn't bright enough to be a star, and it was too smooth to be a meteor, and it was moving too fast to be a planet. He was entranced by it and quickly zoomed in on it and took a picture of it. Then he had the picture enhanced through a computer so he could see the flying object in much more detail. He saw it was long and oval shaped with a thick line running through the center. There is only one thing this object could possibly be... a spaceship! Keys thought ecstatically. He wondered if this could possibly be E.T.'s spaceship, a friendly little extra-terrestrial being who he and his step-family had been friends with for nearly twenty years. But then he remembered that E.T.'s spaceship had been shaped like a sphere and had many round lights decorating it so this one had to from another extra-terrestrial planet. He hoped these aliens were as peaceful as E.T. was and decided his stepson Elliot should also know about this and vowed to show it to him the very next time he saw him. At the same time as this Elliot was sitting on a park bench beside his girlfriend Erin. They had their arms wrapped around each other as they were looking up at the twinkling stars and the full moon. \"The moon is somehow always the most beautiful during the summer,\" said Erin. \"I remember from the time I was five to ten I used to sit by my bedroom window and talk to the man in the moon and pretended he was talking back to me. Silly childishness now that I think about it.\" \"I did the same thing from when I was five to ten though,\" said Elliot. \"I guess all kids have got to have an imaginary friend to talk to. The funny thing is that as soon as I outgrew it I made a friend with someone who many would think was only imaginary.\" \"I know,\" said Erin. \"And I often wonder how E.T. is doing on his home planet. After all, it if it wasn't for him we probably wouldn't be together now.\" \"I think about him all the time,\" said Elliot. \"I can feel his thoughts and feelings vibrating through my own whenever I do and it makes me feel happy just knowing he is happy where he is and that he wants me to be happy. I also want you to always be happy, Erin, and you are happy when you're with me, aren't you?\" \"Yes, of course I am, always,\" replied Erin. \"Then how would you like to always be with me?\" asked Elliot. Erin looked over at him with a slightly confused expression and then with one of hope. \"Elliot, are you saying what I hope you're saying?\" \"Yes, I am,\" said Elliot smiling. He got off the bench and knelt in front of her on one knee as he reached into his jacket pocket for a small velvet box. \"Erin,\" he began. \"I have loved you since eighth grade and since then I have cherished all the moments we've spent together and would like nothing more than to spend my lifetime with you. So I ask will you marry me?\" He opened the box and revealed the ring inside it as he held it out to her. \"Oh, yes, Elliot, I will!\" exclaimed Erin as she slid off the bench and put her arms around him. \"I would like nothing more than to spend my lifetime with you, too.\" Then they kissed underneath the light of the moon and stars. The next day Elliot and Erin came to Elliot's mother and stepfather's house and also invited Elliot's younger sister Gertie, who was a lawyer, and his older brother Michael, who was a star football player and his wife Haily and their two children Nicole who was five and Nicky who had just turned three. \"Uncle Elliot, look what I made for you!\" exclaimed Nicole as she held up a drawing she had done of a panda bear riding on an elephant in a jungle surrounded by flowers and trees. \"Why, thank you, Nicole. It's very nice,\" Elliot said smiling. Nicky then reached out his hands as high as he could towards Elliot. \"Give me a rocket ride! Please! Rocket ride!\" he begged. \"Okay. Here goes,\" Elliot chuckled. He reached down and picked up Nicky and then swung him all around in the air by his hands as he squealed with ecstasy. Later as they were all having dinner Nicole was making a mashed potato man out of her mashed potatoes and Nicky, who was just learning to count, was counting all of his peas one by one before he ate them. Michael talked about his latest winning games and then Gertie talked about her latest successful cases. Then Elliot cleared his throat and tapped on his glass for attention. \"Everyone,\" he began. \"I have a very important announcement to make. Last night I asked Erin to give me her hand in marriage, and she accepted. You are all invited to our wedding. And, Michael, I'd be honored to have Nicole as our flower girl.\" \"Then you've got yourselves a flower girl,\" Michael said grinning. \"Congratulations, bro!\" \"So if you're the second one in the family to get married I guess I'll be next,\" said Gertie. \"You've all grown up so fast!\" Mary said, choking back tears. \"I can hardly wait to see you with your own kids, Elliot.\" Then they all drank a toast to Elliot and Erin. Then after dinner while the others were tucking the kids into bed for the night Keys came to Elliot and showed him the photograph he had taken of the spaceship hovering in the Earth's atmosphere. \"I took this last night,\" he said. \"I think it could only be a spaceship. What do you think?\" \"I think you're right,\" said Elliot as he looked at the picture in fascination. \"Though it isn't E.T.'s spaceship, that's for sure. I think we should call E.T. on his transmitter and ask if he knows anything about this kind of spaceship.\" \"I think that's a good idea,\" said Keys. \"And as long as were calling him why don't we invite him to your wedding?\" \"I like that idea,\" said Elliot. \"After all, this all got started with him. And I'm sure E.T. would be honored to be the very first extra-terrestrial ever to be invited to a Earthly wedding as he is always interested in learning about the ways of other beings just as we are.\" As Michael and Haily were tucking Nicky and Nicole into their bed, Nicole glanced out the window at the moon in the sky and asked, \"Does the man in the moon ever get lonely being up there all by himself?\" \"I'm sure he has plenty of friends in the stars,\" Haily assured her. \"But I wish I could meet him and be his friend, too,\" said Nicole wistfully. \"Sometimes beings from other worlds do come down here to meet with us,\" said Michael smiling. \"So maybe if you make a wish on a star the man in the will hear it and come to see you.\" And so Nicole did. \"Star light, star bright, first star I see tonight. I wish I may, I wish I might. Have the wish I wish tonight. I wish I could meet the man in the moon.\" The next day they took the intergalactic transmitter that E.T. had long ago built out of the attic and fastened it once again to the roof and sent him a message through it. The message traveled up through the atmosphere and entered through the far reaches of the solar system, and through the milky way, and into a whole other galaxy on the other side of the universe where it eventually reached the Green Planet, Brodo Asogi. On the Green Planet, the planet that was home to the most exotic plant life of the universe, the Jumpums were jumping, the flopglopples were flopping along, and the Singour trees were singing, and in the midst E.T. was in a field of Cillysuckle plants as he was teaching his students about them for a few years after his infamous trip to planet Earth he had been given a promotion in the study of botany. Then suddenly E.T.'s heartlight began to flash as he sensed something coming in through the air. Then suddenly a whirlpool of multicolored light whose center resembled an eye floated up to him. This was the Contentment Monitor of the planet. \"There is a message for you from Planet Earth,\" said a voice through the Monitor. \"Message accepted,\" said E.T. Then there was a twinkling and bleeping series of sounds coming from the Monitor as it relayed the message to E.T. through a translator. E.T. got the message. It was from Elliot asking him to come back to Earth to participate in his wedding. E.T. of course had no idea what a wedding was but his heartlight beamed at the opportunity to visit his best friend in the universe again. So as soon as lessons were over for the day he sent a message back to Elliot and made arrangements to launch a spaceship to Planet Earth.[Chapter 5] Back on Earth, E.T's friends received his message back and they were all quite ecstatic about it. \"He's coming!\" exclaimed Elliot delightedly. \"E.T is coming! He's coming to our wedding!\" He took Erin's hands and began to dance around with her. \"Who is E.T.?\" asked Nicole curiously. \"E.T. is the name of a friend we have that is short for extra-terrestrial,\" said Michael. \"What is an extra-terrestrial?\" asked Nicole. \"An extra-terrestrial is a name for being from another world in outer space,\" explained Michael. \"You see, long ago before you were born and we were small like you a being from another world came to us and he wanted to go home and so we helped him to go home again and since then he has come back to visit us often. He has really changed our lives in so many ways and I sometimes think that if it hadn't been for him I wouldn't have you two today.\" \"I can't wait for you two to meet him,\" said Elliot. \"You'll really like him. You know he likes Reese's Pieces as much as you do.\" \"I think we have a picture of him somewhere from one of his last visits,\" said Gertie brightly. \"Come on, let's go find it.\" So they searched through a few family photo albums until they finally found the picture of E.T. \"There he is,\" said Elliot. \"That's E.T. who is coming soon.\" \"He looks really cute!\" exclaimed Nicole. \"He looks just like... the man in the moon!\" \"He is,\" said Gertie remembering how she thought the same thing about E.T. when he first visited. \"I got my wish!\" exclaimed Nicole happily. \"The man in the moon is coming to see me!\" Nicky cringed as he drew back from the picture of E.T. \"I don't like him!\" he squealed fearfully. \"His head looks scary and his fingers look yucky!\" The adults all looked at each other puzzlement at Nicky's repulsion of the image of E.T. but quickly reassured each other that he would soon come to love E.T. as they all did when he came to them. Then three days before the date of the wedding they all felt the atmosphere in and outside of the house vibrating and when they looked out the window they saw they saw the sky had turned many different colors and clouds were quickly breaking apart as a a great beam of light was descending. \"He's here!\" exclaimed Elliot. \"He's come back again!\" They all rushed outside just as the spaceship appeared in the atmosphere and began lowering down to the Earth's surface. It dropped with graceful ease onto the grass of their backyard on its pistols. Then as they watched a hatch opened up in the center of it and a gangplank was dropped down. Then in the light in the spaceship's interior appeared E.T. himself. He waddled slowly down the gangplank and stood before them. \"Greetings gentle Earthlings,\" he said in his gentle gravelly voice. \"E.T. glad to be back.\" Elliot could contain himself no longer. Grinning from ear to ear he rushed forward and threw his arms around E.T.'s pudgy little body and hugged him for all he was worth. Now of course since he was so much taller than before he picked E.T. up off of the ground in his embrace. \"Elliot,\" E.T. said in wonderment. \"You've grown. You've become man.\" Elliot gently let go of E.T. and put him down. \"There is so much for us to catch up on, E.T,\" Elliot said beaming. E.T. looked at his other Earthling friends and so how they had also changed. Mary and Keys had more lines on their faces as well as a few gray hairs. Gertie now looked a lot like Mary did when he first visited, if much brighter with longer hair, and Michael seemed to be the tallest and most muscular among them and if he didn't already know him so well he would have felt intimidated by the sight of him. He then noticed two small Earthlings at Michael's feet, one was his size and one only came up to his neck. Michael then stepped forward a bit and gestured to the two small children. \"E.T. may I introduce our new additions to the family, Nicky and Nicole, my offspring,\" he said with a proud smile. E.T.'s eyes lit up as they opened wide and his mouth opened in a huge smile. He stepped toward Nicky and Nicole with his arms outstretched to embrace them both. \"E.T. love little Earthlings!\" he said. Nicole grinned and ran gladly into E.T.'s open embrace. However, her little brother's eyes widened with terror and he ran screaming behind his mother. E.T. held Nicole in his long arms and looked at Nicky with confusion and sadness written all over his face. Though his heartlight was beaming as he heard Nicole say, \"It's so nice to meet you, Mr. Man in the Moon!\" Haily picked up Nicky who was trembling all over with fear and cradled him in her arms as Michael said, \"Don't worry about Nicky, E.T. It's not that he doesn't like you, he's just... not very good around strangers.\" E.T. smiled with understanding. Then he turned to Elliot and said, \"E.T. has come back for your wedding. What is a wedding?\" \"Come inside, E.T.,\" said Elliot. \"I'll explain it all to you.\" And so they went inside and Elliot sat on the sofa with E.T. next to him and said, \"A wedding is a special ceremony we have here on Earth for two people who love each other so much they want to spend the rest of their lives together, and that is just how I feel about Erin, you see?\" \"E.T. see,\" he replied. \"What exactly happens at a wedding?\" \"A man gives the woman he loves a special ring that symbolizes their unity and she does the same for him,\" Elliot began. \"They invite all of their friends and family to the ceremony which is why I have invited you. The woman's friends become bridesmaids and her best is the maid of honor, and the man's best friend becomes his best man there, and I was wondering if I could give you that honor.\" \"E.T.. accepts the honor,\" said E.T. \"Good. I'm so glad!\" exclaimed Elliot. Then they began to tell each other what had happened in their lives since they had last seen each other. \"Shortly after you last left I graduated high school and got into college, thanks to Keys, to get a degree in science and astronomy. Then as soon as I was out of college I joined Keys at our company for the Search and Research of Extra-Terrestrial Life. And though we've discovered many new galaxies with many planets revolving around many suns we hadn't found any new extra-terrestrial life... until now it seems.\" He then took the enhanced photograph Keys had taken with the telescope of the strange spacecraft out from his pocket and showed it to E.T. \"We were wondering if you could identify this for us.\" E.T. examined the spacecraft in the photo very closely and slowly recognition began to light up his big blue eyes. \"Hmm... This is a spaceship belonging to the Herods.\" \"What are the Herods?\" asked Elliot. \"They are a race of highly superior beings. Far superior to yours and my race. In fact there is a legend that it was them who first discovered that space travel was possible. They are of a peaceful nature though they always tend to look down on anyone and anything that is below them, which unfortunately happens to be just about everything else in the Universe.\" \"Well, what could they possibly be doing in our atmosphere?\"asked Elliot. \"What could they want with us?\" \"Hmm... I can't really tell for sure,\" E.T. admitted. \"I suppose they may just be wanting to study you from a high vantage point and see what they can do to improve your ways of living.\" \"Shouldn't we learn to improve ourselves on our own, though?\" asked Elliot. \"I believe so,\" replied E.T.. \"But you can't really tell that to the Herods.\" Later that evening, E.T. was teaching Nicole about her Solar System by using a map of it that once belonged to Elliot. \"Jupiter is the fifth and largest planet,\" he was saying. \"It has sixteen moons.\" The adults watched them with adoration. They were very glad Nicole had grown so quickly fond of E.T. though they were sorry that Nicky was too scared of E.T. due to his appearance to go anywhere near him. \"What are we going to do about Nicky's problem?\" asked Elliot. \"I mean, I don't want E.T.'s feelings to be hurt because of him.\" \"Neither do I,\" said Mary. \"But in all of my experiences with three year old children you can't really expect them to accept people for who they are inside right away. They just haven't yet developed to where they can understand that what is on the outside isn't always what is on the inside.\" \"You know, I remember I was terrified of E.T. when I first saw him, too,\" said Gertie remembering. \"You sure were, and you screamed like a banshee,\" Elliot said chuckling. \"Come to think of it, I was also afraid of him at first.\" \"So was I, a little bit anyway,\" added Michael. \"And so was I,\" said Mary. \"I remember spilling my coffee.\" \"And we all came to love E.T. for who he is inside,\" said Elliot. \"We just had to take the time to get to know him better was all.\" \"But what can we do about Nicky's phobia of E.T. if he won't even come out when he's around?\" asked Haily. \"Hmm... I know!\" said Gertie. \"Why don't we read him the story of The Ugly Duckling ? That might work.\" \"It's worth a try,\" agreed Elliot. \"I'll be happy to read it to him tonight,\" said Mary. So then Mary went upstairs to read Nicky and Nicole their bedtime story while the others, along with E.T. stayed in the living room and watched the late news. \"Reports of mysteriously unexplained disappearances have been occurring everywhere lately,\" the news anchorman was saying. \"Just today Mrs. Alice Hynkel vanished without a trace according to her neighbor Mrs. Rosie Rosenberg.\" \"I saw her out hanging up the laundry,\" the distraught Mrs. Rosenberg said. \"Then I turned my back for just a moment and then she was just gone!\" \"Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Henderson have also reported their two sons David and Samuel never returned home from school yesterday,\" the newsman continued. \"They say there is nothing to indicate though that they could have run away or been kidnapped. Police are throwing out a dragnet for these strange disappearances.\" They all listened with fascination to this news report. Elliot took out the picture of the Herods spaceship again and looked at wondering if they're could possibly be a connection between the two things.[Chapter 6] The next day when Nicky and Nicole awoke and were brought downstairs to breakfast they found E.T. waiting for them and Nicole at once embraced E.T. while Nicky continued to shy away from touching the alien though he showed no fear in sitting across from it as they ate. \"Well, tomorrow is the big day,\" Elliot said happily to Erin. \"Will you be ready for it?\" \"As ready as I'll ever be,\" she replied laughing. \"That is, you're never really ready for your wedding and yet you still can hardly wait for it.\" \"How true,\" said Michael who had the experience. \"Oh, and also some of the guests agreed to stop by today and meet our very special guest and best man,\" Erin said with a look towards E.T.. \"That's wonderful!\" exclaimed Elliot. \"I can hardly wait to see their faces when they see E.T.!\" \"And I hope they'll react to him more like Nicole than Nicky,\" said Gertie with concern. \"Don't worry about them,\" Elliot assured her. \"Many of them are in the science field and wouldn't be scared of meeting an extra-terrestrial. As for Nicky, he seems to be starting to come around now. That story last night must have really helped. Let's just give him a little more time.\" After breakfast, E.T. followed Nicky and Nicole as they gathered around the television set to watch cartoons. Among them watched an episode of Muppet Babies which happened to be about looking inside to see the beauty in someone or something. Nicky listened to the song they were singing on the TV and couldn't help but think about E.T. and his initial fear of him. \" The Beast loved Beauty But she was scared Until she began to see That deep within His monster skin Was a sweet personality And the Beast said, Look a little bit closer Dig a little bit deeper There's more to see Than just the outside of me.\" Nicky glanced over at E.T. who was calming watching the cartoon with them. He remembered how his initial impression of the strange otherworldly creature had been of a monster that would eat him up or otherwise destroy him in some way. But now as he looked him he couldn't help but notice what nice looking blue eyes he had and also what a gentle smile grazed his face. He also remembered the story he had heard last night about the ugly duckling who was actually a swan in disguise. He wondered then if E.T. while he was ugly on the outside be beautiful on the inside. After they had been watching cartoons for a couple of hours Nicole got out her Candyland game and played it with E.T. who moved all of his pieces by levitating them telepathically. Nicky sat beside them and watched with wonder and awe. Next the children went outside and E.T. watched them as they played tag all around the yard. At first he didn't see much point in just chasing each other around at random for no reason but then he started to see how much fun it could be and he joined them in it. Then suddenly Nicky tripped over his left shoelace which had come untied and fell at full length onto the ground and scraped both of his knees. He screamed out in pain as he sat up with tears streaming down his face. Michael and Haily ran up to him and so did E.T. and Nicole. Michael was the first to reach him and he picked him up from the ground and carried him inside where he promptly washed the dirt off of his knees. Then he was just about to bandage them when ET waddled up to him with his left forefinger glowing. Michael at once understood and set Nicky down beside E.T.. Nicky then watched curiously as E.T. extended his glowing fingertip towards him and then touched it first to his left knee and then his right one and they were both healed instantaneously to his surprise and relief. He then looked up at E.T. not in fear but with gratitude and wonder as he saw this extra-terrestrial was really a kind and gentle creature who would never hurt him but would heal him when he needed it. He reached out and wrapped his arms fully around E.T.'s waist. \"Looks like Nicky is now seeing E.T. for who he is inside,\" Michael said well pleased. \"Yes,\" said Haily. \"Sometimes accidents can bring out the best in others.\" Next they played hide and seek and when it was E.T.'s turn to seek he was the best at finding them as his heartlight could sense their whereabouts telepathically and even when Nicky was hiding in the closet he found him in a second. \"E.T. is so good at looking after them,\" Haily observed. \"He would make a fine babysitter. E.T. and Elliot later took a trip to the local greenhouse to pick out the flowers for the wedding. \"Now, I must have the flowers most appropriate for the kind of wedding we're having,\" Elliot told E.T. \"How about roses?\" asked Elliot looking at some bright red roses. \"Too loud,\" said E.T.. \"How about some lilies,\" asked Elliot looking at some yellow lilies. \"Too weak,\" said E.T.. \"How about some violets?\" asked Elliot looking at some purple viloets. \"Too shy,\" said E.T.. \"How about some poppies?\" asked Elliot looking at some bright pink poppies. \"Too spicy,\" said E.T.. Elliot looked around but couldn't seem to pick out the right flowers. So finally he turned to E.T. and said, \"Alright, Mr. Expert of Plants, what do you suggest?\" E.T. walked behind a huge display of honeysuckles and hollyhocks and then came out carrying in an arm full of bright orange magnolias. \"These are what we are looking for,\" he said. Elliot went with E.T.'s wisdom and bought as many magnolias as he could. Later as evening approached some of the guests for tomorrow's wedding arrived and Elliot and Erin introduced them to E.T. Among them were Erin's parents and some of Elliot's old buddies from college, and also some of his favorite professors. \"So this is E.T.!\" exclaimed Erin's mother rapturously. \"Why, isn't he just the cutest thing!\" She pinched the corners of E.T.'s cheeks and then kissed him on his low forehead which left a dark red lip print on it. \"Why, I'll be! A real live alien!\" exclaimed Professor Oakly. \"I never thought I'd live to see one. Oh my! There are so many things I want to ask you and so much I want to know about you!\" He took E.T.'s long fingered left hand and shook it vigorously. E.T. looked confused as he did this. \"What sort of gesture does this mean?\" he inquired curiously. \"Why, it's a gesture of friendly greeting,\" explained Professor Oakly. \"It's how we humans tell new people we meet we are pleased to make their acquaintance.\" E.T. smiled as a light of understanding came into his eyes. \"This is how we on my planet say that.\" He then closed his eyes and let his heartlight turn on a bright red glow. It was so bright they could actually see his insides pumping. \"Oh my! I can actually feel so much warmth and pleasure radiating for the light of your heart!\" exclaimed Professor Oakly in great wonder. \"Me and my fellows always use our heartlights as a means of communication,\" explained E.T.. \"In fact, it was our only source for it for millions of years before we invented our own verbal language after we discovered that most other life of other planets had them, though we still mainly prefer to use our heartlights for everything, including powering the fuel for our spaceships.\" \"There is more life out there! How much more?\" asked Professor Oakly with much eagerness. \"Tell me are they all as friendly and peaceful as you are?\" \"There are billions of other life forms in the universe,\" said E.T. \"Almost as many as there are planets. A great many of them are gentle and giving beings also. Unfortunately though there are a few, not too numerous mind you, who are malicious and destructive. Though none of them are interested in conquering the Earth as they think its too small of a planet with not enough resources and that humans are too stupid to even bothering fighting against. And then there are also those who are peaceful but nature but don't show much in the way of being friendly towards other beings because they find them to be below them.\" \"How very interesting,\" said Professor Oakly. \"I really do wish we of Earth had the technology to travel to other life inhabited planets.\" \"Someday you may, though not in your time I am afraid,\" said E.T. \"Hey, wait a minute!\" exclaimed Elliot. \"Not everyone is here. Does anyone know where Perry and Jilly are?\" Perry and Jilly had been best friend with Elliot and Erin when they were dating in college. They had double dated with them numerous times in fact. \"Gee, I don't know,\" said Professor Oakly. And everyone muttered the same. \"We saw them just this morning though, and there didn't seem to be anything wrong that would make them not be here,\" said another professor. \"And it really isn't like either of them to be late at all either.\" Elliot looked very concerned. He remembered hearing about the mysterious disappearances last evening on the news and then he thought about the Herod's spaceship in the Earth's atmosphere and what E.T. said about them. Hmm... I wonder, he thought to himself.[Chapter 7] The next morning, bright and early, everyone awoke and headed down to the place of the wedding reception. It was a beautiful day, the sun was shining in a a clear blue sky, the weather was perfectly warm with just the slightest of breeze to the air, and the birds could be heard singing. All seemed to be just right with the world on this day. \"This will be the happiest day of my life,\" Elliot said cheerfully to E.T. as they were being driven by Michael to the place of their wedding reception. \"You're here to see me marry the girl of my dreams and everything has gone according to plan so far. I don't see how anything could possibly get in the way of things now.\" They arrived shortly at their destination which was a small town park. \"People usually either get married in a church or a courthouse,\" Elliot said to E.T.. \"But me and Erin aren't religious and we want our wedding to be extra special and personal so we decided to have it where we first kissed and where I proposed.\" They then headed over to a pretty gazebo with a light roof providing light shade from the sun. Elliot went under it and stood at the center with E.T. standing on his right side while Michael and Haily joined Keys and Mary in the seats just outside. As Elliot stood waiting patiently for Erin to arrive he noticed a few empty seats as they still didn't know where some of their guests were. Shortly, Erin arrived and walked under the gazebo and stood beside Elliot. She was in her snowy white wedding dress of pressed silk and Elliot was in his pressed and starched tuxedo. They waited a few minutes and then Erin whispered to Elliot, \"No one has seen Professor Oakley since this morning, and no one has still been able to find Perry and Jilly.\" \"Other guests seem to be missing also,\" replied Elliot. \"What can we do?\" \"Well, we can't wait forever,\" said Erin. \"Let's get married while we can.\" Elliot agreed and then the reverend they had chosen to administer the wedding stepped in front of them and began his speech. \"Everyone, we are gathered here today to witness the union of two of our dearest friends, Elliot Taylor, and Erin Lockhart. Over the years we have-\" Then just at that moment there was a sudden stirring in the air around them and then a breeze began to pick up and strangely it seemed to be coming from directly above them instead of around them. Then this was followed by a peculiar humming noise that filled the air. Then the sky seemed to be growing darker as though a great dark cloud had passed over the sun. \"What is going on now?\" asked Erin as she tried to keep her dress from rising up. \"I hope it isn't a storm coming,\" said Elliot. E.T. looked extremely worried and anxious. He was the only one who could tell what was actually coming but he knew he could do nothing to stop it. \"Everyone, stay close together!\" E.T. exclaimed urgently. Everyone got up from their seats and huddled around each other. \"E.T., do you know what is going on here?\" asked Elliot as the wind picked up increasingly. \"It is an oncoming abduction,\" replied E.T. somberly. \"An abduction? By who, or what?\" asked Elliot incredulously. \"I don't know,\" replied E.T. sorrowfully. \"But once it gets started there is no stopping it.\" At this Erin clung on to Elliot tightly as did Mary to Keys and Haily to Michael and Nicky and Nicole to them, and everyone else there clung to someone close to them. Then an extremely bright light appeared directly above them. When they looked up they saw a giant disk shaped object hovering over them and nearly filling up an entire corner of the sky. The light seemed to be coming out of an opening in the bottom of the disk which was surrounded by strange symbols all around. \"What kind of spaceship is that, E.T., do you know?\" asked Elliot. \"It seems to belong to the Herods!\" cried E.T. in astonishment. \"The Herods? But I thought you said they didn't care about us human beings,\" said Elliot. \"I thought they didn't,\" asserted E.T.. \"But now it seems they do for some reason.\" Just then the bottom of the spaceship opened up to the thinnest brim of it and the light coming out of it became nearly blinding. Then everyone began to feel a magnetic sensation pulling them upward. Elliot glanced down and saw that they were actually being lifted off of the ground inside the gazebo and pulled up toward the spaceship's opening. The ascension became increasingly faster until they were at last sucked forcefully up through the opening in the spaceship. They bounced up into the inside of the spaceship and hovered in place for a moment and then when the opening in the bottom closed up they came down with a soft thump, all of them still clinging to each other inside the gazebo. Elliot looked around and saw they were in room made of silvery gray metal with dozens of peculiar looking machines and devices in it. \"What is all this stuff?\" he asked. \"I'm afraid I do not know anymore than you,\" replied E.T.. \"I have never been inside a Herod's ship either.\" Just then a sliding double-door opened automatically and four strange being with big heads and small facial features and skinny limbs and compact bodies came in through it. They looked in smug satisfaction at all the humans, and then they noticed E.T. among them and their expressions became baffled ones. \"Why, look it is a miniature Brodo Asogian!\" exclaimed one of the Herods looking directly at E.T.. \"What in the name of the Universe are you doing amongst these human earthling beings?\" demanded another Herod of E.T.. \"These are my friends,\" replied E.T.. \"I came to Earth to visit them for the occasion of a wedding, which is a ceremony they have when two of them who love each other deeply are united in life.\" \"Why, how very interesting,\" said a Herod in a chillingly emotionless voice. \"What should we do with this Brodo Asogian stowaway on our ship?\" asked another Herod. \"Well, the captain will most certainly want to know about it, as much he doesn't like stowaways. SO I propose we should bring him with us to the captain,\" replied another Herod. \"First I want to know what you intend to do to my friends,\" E.T. demanded of them. \"The captain shall explain everything to you. Now come,\" responded the first Herod. E.T. was then escorted out of the room and through the sliding doors by the four Herods. They led him into the heart of the spaceship which was the captain's control room. E.T.'s eyes widened as he saw it was filled with much technological devices that were far superior to that of his own kinds. They stopped abruptly in front of a tall rectangular shaped silver chair. The first Herod spoke, \"Captain, we have found a stowaway on our ship. It is a Brodo Asogian of the miniature kind. What shall we do with it?\" The chair turned around slowly to face them and there sat the Herod's captain and leader. He stared fixedly at E.T. It was evident that he was very annoyed by the sight of him from the way his eyes squinted up. \"What was he doing amongst the humans on Earth?\" demanded the captain. \"He claims he has a friendly relationship with the ones we brought aboard, sir,\" replied the first Herod. \"He came to visit them because of a ceremony they have called a wedding. Have you heard of such a thing, sir?\" \"Yes, I have,\" replied the Herod captain in an irritated tone. \"It's a most nonsensical celebration of meaningless feelings of devotion which frequently do not last.\" He looked again at E.T. who quailed under his intense gaze. \"As for this stowaway, I'm sure he will be of no use to use, so just send him back to his home planet where he belongs.\" \"Yes, sir. Right away, sir,\" said the Herods with a nod. \"But not before we drop off our human captives onto their designated asteroid,\" the Herod captain added. \"Oh, yes, sir! Of course, sir!\" replied the Herods together. \"What asteroid? Why are you taking them there? What is your purpose?\" asked E.T. in puzzlement. \"It is Asteroid 962,\" replied the Herod leader coolly. \"We're bringing them there so they can start their lives anew on their new home.\" \"But why do they need a new home?\" E.T. was even more puzzled. \"Because they are now being reestablished as a species by us and Asteroid 962 is the most life-supporting one for them to live on.\" \"But why do you want to reestablish the human race as a species?\" asked E.T. further. \"Why, haven't you Brodo Asogians observed from your long lifespan and trips to the planet Earth what the human race is becoming on its own? They are turning into miscreants that like to destroy everything they build since from the very beginning. They seem to thrill at starting wars, attacks of or on terrorism, killing, stealing from, and just plain ruining each others lives, and the leaders they've had over the centuries have been the worst of them because they condone and initiate such acts. The time has come for them to reestablished, and we are just the ones to do it,\" the Herod leader said almost in one breath. \"Well, while I do agree that there are many human beings who are as you say they are, there are still a good many genuine human beings who give good nature to the definition of being human,\" said E.T.. \"Yes, I am well aware of that fact,\" said the Herod leader. \"So we are gathering up as many of the humans who are like that as we can and dropping them off onto Asteroid 962 where they may live in tranquil harmony with each other and not be disturbed or influenced by the worser of their species, of which we deal with in a separate way.\" \"And how exactly do you deal with them?\" asked E.T., rather fearful of the answer. \"I'll show you,\" said the Herod leader. He got up and led E.T. out of the control room and led him down a series of long hallways and then at the last one they turned right and went into a large room and E.T.'s eyes widened in shock and horror as he his mouth fell agape at the sight before them. He saw hundreds of human beings of all different ages and races standing in lines with strange metal caps on their heads. These metal caps had many wires connecting them to an enormous highly complex looking machinery that was constantly blinking lights and making a humming noise with occasional beeps. E.T. could see a very thin beam of electric energy transferring back and forth from the wires of the machine into the the wires of the connected metal caps and thus into the brains of the human subjects. The humans all held totally blank and emotionless expressions with their eyes wide and unblinking and their mouths slightly open with occasional mumblings coming from them. \"What in the name of the Universe are you doing to these poor humans?\" asked E.T. incredulously. \"We are only erasing the data of their minds and entering new data based on that which we found in the minds of the better humans when we ran tests on them so that they may eventually be fully reprogrammed and able to live in peace with the others on Asteroid 962,\" the Herod leader answered. \"But do you not realize that you are interfering with the ways of which the Universe works and that is wrong to do?\" asked E.T.. \"On the contrary,\" said the Herod leader calmly. \"We are really doing the Universe a great deal of good for if we were to just leave the human race as it was sooner or later it would destroy its home planet Earth which would no doubt wreck havoc on the rest of their solar system, their galaxy, and then indeed the rest of the Universe.\" \"But I was always taught by the elders of my home planet to never meddle in the affairs of any other life inhabited planet,\" E.T. countered, \"and also that when left to its own the race of the planets would get along well and fine as the Universe has its own ways of dealing with whatever may come its way.\" \"Well, I say that you are just a lowly miniature Brodo Asogian who doesn't know hardly anything about living things beyond the plant formations and you are not one to question my decisions in educating you or any race lower than the two of us, and especially the Earth race,\" the Herod leader said with an indignant glare at E.T.. \"But don't you realize that if it took the Earth billions of years to form itself and then make itself habitable for life form of many kinds that it must certainly be capable of withstanding many degradations those inhabitants happen to bring to it?\" E.T. pressed further. The Herod leader now looked thoroughly frustrated with E.T.. \"Listen,\" he hissed sternly, \"We are the most advanced, intellectual, and overall superior beings of the known Universe and so if we wish to do something about the disorder of the Universe then we have a right to do it. Now, I will hear not another word from you and you will go back to your home planet where you belong and you can tend to your own planet's needs.\" And so saying the Herod leader dragged E.T. out of the room and down the hall and into a vacant room which had a series of circular windows lining the left side of its walls. Then he closed the door behind E.T. and locked it securely. E.T. looked around and soon figured out he was in a miniature space shuttle which when they reached his home planet would blast out of the spaceship and send him spiraling down to his home on Brodo Asogi. He sighed as he went over to the windows and gazed out at the stars in space and tried to contemplate his situation. In the far distance he could see a tiny asteroid passing them by on its rotation and knew that it must be the Asteroid 962 that the Herods had mentioned they sent the better of the human race to for reestablishment. He knew that Elliot and his other earthly friends must be on it by now and felt a great pang of sadness for them for all Elliot had wanted to do was get married today just as the others wanted to watch him do so and none of them deserved this fate. He then thought about those poor humans he had seen in that awful laboratory and felt in his heart that their treatment was wrong and undeserving. It seemed to him that scary looking machine had turned them into brainwashed zombies and that was surely what they had become from now on and would therefore never be able to really mix with any human society ever again. Those Herods might be top notch on the list of intellectual and technologically advanced on the list of beings in the Universe but at the same time they were also the most arrogant and uptight and self-righteous, and condescending. They were just so full of knowledge in their heads that had become so heavy they couldn't feel any wisdom within their hearts. The wisdom of the heart which E.T.'s race kept sacred since the beginning of time and valued it above all else and tried to share it with anyone in the Universe who cared to understand it. He just wished the Herods could care to understand it, then they wouldn't be so dominating over things which didn't concern them. E.T. then remembered how he and his fellows stored their wisdom within their heartlights which glowed whenever they found new wisdom or shared what they already had of it. It was what not only kept them united as a species but also let them know the truth of all things of the Universe, including its inhabitants. He remembered that when the time was right they could transfer their wisdom to other hearts whether or not it was of one of them, which was how he had first been able to communicate with Elliot when they first met and he couldn't understand his language. Perhaps if he could summon enough energy from his heartlight to the heart of the Herod leader he would see that what he was doing was uncalled for and put the human beings back where they were. But then he also knew it would take more than one heartlight to reach out to all of the Herods who all kept their hearts buried deep within themselves. So, if he could just call out telepathically to his fellows on Brodo Asogi which this spaceship was now approaching they could perhaps generate the wisdom and love they had that the Herods didn't have into their own hearts and minds. It was worth a try. He went up to the farthest window and turned on his heartlight as he closed his eyes and spoke from within the light of his heart. Friends, comrade, and fellow Brodo Asogians, I need your help.[Chapter 8] The Herod's spaceship hovered over Asteroid 962, gracefully made its descent into the atmosphere, and when it was just twenty feet above the surface it opened up the shaft in its underside and ejected its newest captures from it. They all drifted slowly down onto the smooth sandy ground landing softly on their feet. Elliot and his family and friends looked around at their surroundings. They were standing in what seemed to be a vast desert and there were what looked like many dome shaped caves of many sizes. All around them they could see hundreds of hundreds of people of all ages, races, and ethnicities who were either wandering around, talking to each other, or building what seemed to be the beginnings of houses. \"What is this place?\" Elliot asked. \"I have a feeling it's far from Earth,\" said Erin. \"Well, let's ask someone here if they know what this is all about,\" said Michael. So they went up to one old man with long gray hair and matching eyes and Elliot said, \"Excuse us, sir. We just came here and we'd like to know if you know anything about what is going on around here.\" The old man looked at them and smiled a smile that seemed both painful and exhilarated at once and replied, \"You folks are about the hundredth to ask that around here. My name is Ernest Baldwin, by the way. Pleased to meet you.\" He and Elliot then shook hands briefly. \"So are we prisoners here or something?\" asked Elliot. \"Well, in a manner of speaking we are,\" replied Ernest still smiling. \"Those extra-terrestrial folks who brought us all here are called Herods and from what they let me know they're intention is to reestablish us here on this little planet because they don't like what the majority of us have done to our old home. So they've picked out who they think are the better of us and dropped us off here so we can all live in a perfect utopia with each other, and kept the more worse ones on board their ship so they can rehabilitate them as they see fit. By the way, you didn't see how they do it, did you?\" \"No, we didn't,\" replied Elliot. \"Be glad you didn't,\" said Ernest seriously. \"I saw it and let me tell you it is not a pretty sight to see what they're doing to them. But they say it is for the greater good.\" \"But this is all crazy!\" exclaimed Elliot.\"What they seem to be trying to do is the very thing that many dictators in various parts of our world had tried to do over the last century and all it did was ruin everything, the country, the people, and the dictators themselves.\" \"Yes, I am well aware of history myself,\" replied Ernest. \"But you can't tell that to them and expect them to understand it as they're heads are already so chock full of knowledge there's no room for any thing else in them. I know this because I tried to tell them myself.\" \"What are we gonna do?\" asked Elliot. \"I mean, I don't want to start a new life here in this place. I just want to get married. \"I'm afraid I don't think you can do that here with them governing over everything,\" said Ernest with regret. \"I personally though am not unhappy to be here as no one back on Earth seem to understand me anyway just because I always wanted to meet an alien and devoted my life to trying to make that dream come true, and now it has in a bigger way than I could have ever dreamed of!\" Elliot smiled sadly. \"I met an alien when I was ten years old and we're the best of friends to this day. He's called E.T. and he is the wisest and most loving creature you could ever meet. I invited him back to Earth for my wedding and so he was with us at the time of our abduction. I'm worried about what those Herods will do to him as they weren't pleased with having a stowaway as they called him.\" \"Well,\" said Ernest thoughtfully. \"If he really is the wisest and most loving creature as you say he is then maybe he will have a better chance and getting through to those big heads than any of us did.\" \"I hope so, I really do,\" said Elliot. He sighed and looked toward the sky. E.T. If you can hear me, please help. The Brodo Asogian spaceship was floating slowly in-between the Green Planet and the approaching Herod spaceship. Suddenly a capsule shot out of the underside of the Herod's ship and at the same time a hatchway opened up in the front of the Brodo Asogi ship so that the capsule flew directly into it. E.T. stepped out of the space capsule and into the main room of his friends spaceship. He smiled as they all greeted him with their glowing heart lights. The captain of the ship stepped forward and gave E.T. a slight bowing of his head to let him know they had received his message and would abide by his wishes. So then E.T. and his fellows all joined hands in a circle and closed their eyes as they let their heart lights brighten and expand beyond the capacity of their chests. Their heart lights floated outside of their bodies and swirled around until they met in the center of the circle where they connected together into one gigantic sized glowing red ball of light which just as it was as blinding as the light of a sun it was made of all of the love the short-stature extra-terrestrials had for their Universe and everything in it. Then the ball of energized love floated up to the top of the spaceship and glided its way out into space and then it was between the two spaceships, one that was hovering still and one that was on its way. Then a brilliant white light appeared in the center of the red ball and it exploded like a hyper-nova out into space, scattering itself everywhere all at once. Inside the main control room of the Herod's spaceship the Herod leader suddenly began experiencing an overwhelming sensation he never had before. He seemed to be feeling a lightness within his chest that was making him feel all warm and fuzzy all over and also strange and tingly. His mind began to feel clouded with confusion at this which was something which he couldn't bear as he was also completely unaccustomed to this kind of sensation also. He put a hand to his chest and then suddenly felt another peculiar sensation behind his eyes as his vision began to blur. What in all of the Universe am I feeling? He wondered. Then he was shocked at himself for that very thing, that he was actually feeling something. He had never thought much of feelings before as he had always thought of them as such things that only existed within the feeble minds of lesser life forms. And yet here he was experiencing it somehow for himself and when he had identified it felt both enticing and painful at the same time. But how could such a thing be possible? It just didn't make sense at all. What was wrong that could make him feel this way? With his hand trembling slightly he pressed on a button on his control panel and spoke into the intercom. \"Send in the Herod Adviser... at once!\" Within seconds the Herod Adviser stepped in through the arched doorway. \"Yes, Captain. What ails you?\" \"I am being ailed by an altogether peculiarly unknown sensation,\" he explained. \"It seems to be coming from right in here,\" he put his hand over the left side of his chest. \"And it feels wonderful and yet disturbing at the same time, and it is also boggling my brain which is most unpleasant. Can you identify it for me?\" The Herod Adviser stared at the Captain with glazed eyes as he spoke in a slightly faltering voice. \"I believe I can, my Captain. The unknown sensation you feel is coming from your heart and it is called emotion.\" The Herod Leader stared at his adviser in great shock. \"Why, how can you be sure of such a thing?\" \"Because... I am experiencing the very same thing myself at this very moment,\" the Herod Adviser replied with his thin lips trembling. \"But why is my... emotion... contradicting itself?\" demanded the Herod leader. \"I believe because it is new to you and therefore it is making you feel happy, and it is also bringing tears to your eyes which causes your heart to feel heavy.\" \"But why?\" asked the Herod leader again. \"Well, forgive me if I seem impertinent, sir,\" the Herod Adviser said with hesitation. \"I believe because your heart is telling you have been wrong and done something that was misguided.\" \"But what could it be?\" asked the Herod leader. \"I am in the regret of saying this,\" said the Herod Adviser meekly. \"But my own heart is telling me that we were wrong to take all of the humans that we did from their home planet against their will and wipe their minds of some without their consent and try to reestablish them as they have tried to do for centuries with failure.\" The Herod leader listened to his adviser's speech with a bubbling sensation welling up within his chest. Now he felt his eyes begin to leak as he said, \"I fear you are right. We have been severely misguided in our ways for many millenniums. I don't know where this new sense of right and wrong came from I admit or how we acquired it but now that it is with us we must set out to correct the wrong we have done.\" \"Yes, sir, indeed,\" replied his adviser. \"Our first action should be to attend to the humans we have attempted to purify the minds of in the laboratory,\" the Herod leader continued. \"I will go see to them and you see that the ship is put in the reverse direction to return to Asteroid 962 to pick up the humans there and return them to their Earth.\" \"Right away, sir,\" the Herod Adviser bowed and hurried out of the room. The Herod Leader went to the ship's laboratory. As he approached it he was expecting to hear the mindless mumbling of the zombified humans, but instead he heard happy and lighthearted laughing and chatting. When he entered the room he found them all smiling and talking amongst each other in a friendly way. It seemed the emotional energy had reached them as well. He suddenly realized just then the true reason behind his sudden change of heart. I don't know how you did it, little Brodo Asogian, but I am glad you did it. On Asteroid 962 Elliot and the other human captives watched as the great Herod spaceship floated down to the planet's surface. Alongside them was a smaller spaceship he recognized as belonging to E.T.'s race and it filled his heart with hope. \"Look, it's E.T.!\" he exclaimed. \"He's alright.\" The Herod leader stepped down from the gangway of his spaceship as E.T. stepped down from his own at the same time and together they approached Elliot and the ones surrounding him. \"I wish to apologize to all of you here,\" began the Herod leader with a heartfelt sincerity. \"For I, and all the rest of my fellows, realize now that we were misguided in our efforts to make you a better race. Your friend from Brodo Asogi here helped us to understand where we went wrong. We have erred tremendously in our ways and we will be forever in regret for it.\" \"Hey, no hard feelings,\" said Elliot with a smile. \"You guys were only doing what you thought what was right after all, and it is true that a lot of humans are bad and have a lot to learn we need to learn by ourselves without our journeys being interrupted. So, now if you will just take us home so me and Erin can get married all be forgiven.\" Then all of the humans there gathered into the spaceships of the Herods and the Brodo Asogians and they were flown back to Earth. \"Now that I understand better about love and its place in the Universe,\" the Herod leader said aboard the spaceship to Elliot. \"I would like to join you and your loved one together as it would be the least I could do to make up for all the inconvenience I have caused you.\" \"Sure, that'd be great,\" said Elliot. And so once they were all back on Earth Elliot and Erin were married in front of all of the humans that were returned and also the Herods as well as E.T.'s family. After the Herod leader made a poetic speech about how the Universe had heard them and their love for each other they said their vows and then he said, \"Then by the power invested in by the Universe, I pronounce you man and wife.\" Then Elliot and Erin kissed as everyone there applauded. ","Summary":" A/N: This story is about a colony of superior aliens and what they may think of us if they are out "},{"Movie":"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial","Title":"Celebrating Solstice with E T","Author":"WogglebugLoveProductions","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9464816","Passage":"[Chapter 1] December 16, 1982 Elliot stood in front of his bedroom window, his elbows rested on the sill. He gazed wistfully through the glass of the closed window, which was framed with frost. He looked at the sky, which was cloudless tonight, and black as ink. He saw stars sprinkled and scattered in every place on the enormous black canvas. Some were big, some were tiny, and some were in-between. Some were brighter than others, though they all really shone brilliantly. Elliot sighed as he began to remember. Almost two months ago he had met a very curious and friendly little creature who lived amongst the stars. He had at first been afraid of it, until he realized it was really lonely and scared itself, and took it into his home. He had shown it to his brother Michael, and sister Gertie, but had thought it best not to tell their mother. The three of them had fun with the creature they named E.T. until it become it became apparent that he must return to his own home and planet. Then E. T. suddenly became terminally ill, at the same time the government found out about him and their house had been surrounded by scientists. E.T.'s illness got worse and worse, and he actually died, and was somehow resurrected. His family had then come for him in their Spaceship and taken him home, to the Green Planet. Elliot could still feel the long hug he and E.T. had given each other just before he left, and E.T.'s last words to him, \" I'll be right here\" . Now that Christmas was approaching he thought about E.T. more than ever. After all, wasn't Christmas a time when one thought always of those he loved? As well as a time to be with them? His mother, Mary, now entered the room. She smiled as she saw him daydreaming at his window. She came over at sat down beside him. \"Thinking of him, aren't you,\" she said softly. Elliot nodded. \"I often wonder, where is he, how is he?\" Mary smiled as she leaned closer and looked at the stars with him. \"You were his best friend, and you were there to take him in when no one else was. Wherever he is now, he will never forget that.\" Elliot smiled now. \"It's almost Christmas now, you know? And, I just wish I could give him something,\" he pondered. \"Well, why don't you invite him to spend Christmas here?\" Mary suggested. Elliot looked at her. He hadn't thought of that. \"We still have the transmitter thing you built with him, and it worked before.\" Mary pointed out. Elliot's face lit up. \"That's a great idea!\" he said. \"You think he'll come?\" \"I don't see why not,\" Mary replied. \"I'm sure he misses us, just as we all miss him.\" Elliott nodded. After a moment, Mary gave a yawn and said, \"Best be going to bed now.\" and left his room. Elliot looked to the stars for just one more moment and whispered, \"Merry Christmas, E.T., wherever you are.\" The next day there was no school as Christmas Vacation had began. Elliot came down to breakfast he met with his siblings and asked them, \"Do you remember E.T.?\" \"Of course,\" said Michael. \"We thought we'd be helping him, but he was really helping all of us.\" He sighed as he remembered. \"I miss him,\" moaned Gertie. \"So do I,\" said Elliot. \"And that's the point. I think we ought to invite for Christmas by way of the transmitter he built. What do you think?\" \"Why didn't I think of that? I love that idea!\" said Michael happily. \"I'd love to see the little squashy guy again!\" \"Me too!\" Gertie chimed in sweetly. \"Maybe I'll be able to take him for show and tell, when school starts again!\" she added hopefully. So, that very afternoon, Elliot, Gertie, and Michael found the transmitter, which was made of an umbrella, a record player, a circular saw blade, a light bulb, and Gertie's Speak and Spell. Elliot dialed a message in the dialect E.T. had taught him. It said, Dear E.T., we all miss you and would like for you to come visit and spend Christmas with us. Love Elliot and family. They then placed the transmitter on the roof. For two days they waited and received no response. Then, on the third day, a message appeared which said, Elliot, I will come visit you for Christmas. Look for the Spaceship tonight. Love E.T. P.S. I miss you. Elliot was overjoyed. He was going to see his best friend again! That night it snowed, and Elliot, Michael, Gertie, and Mary stood close together in the forest clearing as they waited with anticipation for E.T.'s return. Soon they saw a bright light appear in the sky, as they watched it grew bigger and brighter, seeming to fill the whole sky, taking the shape of E.T.'s Spaceship. It appeared before them in all its glory, looking itself like a Christmas tree ornament, it's many lights casting a most beautiful rainbow pattern on the snowflakes, making them look like multicolored dots in the air. The Spaceship continued its descend, letting off steam and melting some snowflakes in the air. It landed very gracefully and gently onto the snow covered ground, supporting itself on pistols. Elliot was breathing hard and could see his breath evaporating in the icy air. He was clasping his hands together tightly, and not just from the chill in the weather. He stared unblinking as a door of the Spaceship opened and a ramp was let down. As he continued to watch, he saw E.T. appear in the doorway. E.T. descended the Spaceship's ramp with that endearing little shuffle of his. He stepped off, onto the snow, extending his long arms and said, \"Greetings, gentle Earthlings! E.T. glad to be back!\" Elliot felt like his heart was going to explode with happiness, for here was E.T., his best friend. He looked exactly how he remembered him from his very short legs and very long arms, to his extending neck, to his great big, wide, round eyes, which seemed more blue than anything. Elliot ran to E.T. and embraced the little alien, at the same time Gertie did, it was fortunate E.T. could easily hug them both with his extra long arms. \"E.T... love you,\" he said, as Gertie covered his face with kisses. Michael came over and knelt beside them as he tenderly rubbed E.T.'s long, eggplant shaped head. Mary looked on and thought how strange yet amazingly wonderful it was for her three children to find so much love and attachment in one cute little alien.[Chapter 2] Elliot and his family led their little extra-terrestrial friend to their house, and then Elliot led him upstairs to his room. Once they were inside Elliot looked at E.T. and said, \"E.T. I am so happy to see you again, especially at this time of year!\" He looked at the ancient voyager and thought of how lucky he was that he had chosen to spend Christmas with him on Earth when he could have been in any other galaxy, on any other planet. His blue eyes were shining with love and joy as his mouth was curved slightly in a sweet smile which let him know that there was no place he would rather be right now than right here with him. \"E.T. happy to see you, Elliot, again,\" he said in his aged, gravelly, yet gentle and loving alien voice. Elliot smiled delightedly. He reached over to the nightstand beside his bed and found the picture that Mary had taken on E.T.'s first visit. It was at Halloween and Elliot was dressed up like a hunchback, and Michael was dressed up to look like a hippie, and they were each holding onto a hand of E.T.'s as the little creature was hidden underneath a white sheet, pretending to be Gertie dressed up like a ghost. \"Remember when this was taken?\" Elliot asked as he handed E.T. the picture which was now in a frame. E.T. smiled and purred as his big blue eyes focused in on the image of himself underneath the sheet in the picture. He chuckled as he remembered how when it had been taken a flash of light had appeared so suddenly and brightly that he had fainted instantly. He remembered when he had fainted like that once before when his captain had steered their spaceship a little too close to a cosmic sun. \"You've learned about Halloween, and now you'll learn about Christmas,\" Elliot went on excitedly as he set the picture onto the stand again. \"It's my favorite time of year! It's so much fun! There is no school, and everyone gets together and gets happy together, and everyone gives out presents and gets one in return, and then there's Christmas cookies, and Santa Claus, and...\" \"Slow down!\" said E.T. gently as he held his hands up against Elliot's breathless speaking. \"E. one at time only.\" Elliot smiled. \"Sorry, E.T. Sometimes I talk too fast when I'm excited,\" he said with a slightly embarrassed chuckle. \"E.T. has noticed before,\" he replied with a kindly smile. \"Your English has improved, I see,\" said Elliot as he remembered when E.T. last visited he had only learned a few English words and phrases. E.T. smiled and nodded. \"E.T. has been studying at home with scholars. I'm far from perfect, but I can now tell you all you want to know about me.\" \"Really?\" Elliot never had any need for words to understand E.T., and yet now there were so many things he wanted to know about him. He spoke the first question that came into his mind. \"How old are you?\" \"I am seven-thousand years old, but I am young.\" Elliot smiled and was just about to ask another question when E.T. yawned softly and pressed his long fingers against his mouth. He smiled knowing that E.T. must be tired after his long journey. He took him by the hand and gently led him over to a small cot that was laid out beside his own bed. \"I made it just for you,\" he said as E.T. laid his pudgy little body down onto the cot, resting his head on a pillow that was designed especially for it's shape. E.T. smiled sweetly as Elliot draped a quilt over him and tucked him in. \"All planets I visited, never made me feel as special as you,\" he said and closed his eyes sleepily as he sighed with contentment. As Elliot laid down onto his own bed he looked at the peacefully sleeping E.T. on the cot for a moment and remembered when he had first came to him. . . As Elliot stepped outside into the cool October evening he shined his flashlight all around his backyard, and finding that nothing was there he sat down in a lawn chair by the garage and pulling his sleeping bag up to his chest he sat still and placed a bag of Reese's Pieces in his lap. He held the flashlight tightly in his left hand and kept his focus straight ahead as he watched and waited for it to appear. Just the other night he had seen a unknown creature in the cornfield that had terrified him, though somehow it seemed the creature had been more frightened than he was, so this morning he had left a trail of Reese's Pieces for it leading from the park to the edge of the entrance to his house. So now all he had to do was wait. Hours went by and there was still no sign of it. Elliot was growing more and more sleepy by the minute, he could barely keep his eyes open. Then finally his eyes closed and he fell fast asleep. Only a second later he heard a sudden shuffling noise coming from ahead of him. Startled, he opened his eyes and gasped as he was suddenly wide awake, for there standing at just the edge of the entrance ahead of him, was the creature. He sat up and held his flashlight as he stared fixedly ahead at the queer little creature partially concealed by the shadows. It had a blob-like body with a long and flat head, and long, wiry arms that touched the ground as it began to move forward on two very small and flat feet with a strange, awkward kind of waddle. As Elliot watched the creature move towards him his heart began to beat rapidly with fear as his breathing became heavy. He had always been afraid of strangers, and this was the strangest of all. He tried to cry out for his mother and brother, but he was so frightened he could only squeak. The creature waddled slowly up to him, stopping every few seconds and then coming ever closer. It somehow seemed anxious to reach him as it could clearly be heard breathing heavily. As Elliot watched it unable to move every nightmare he had ever had, every time he was ever afraid of something, raced through his mind in the form of a horror movie on fast forward. The creature was only a few feet from him as it slowly reached one of its very long arms out to him and slowly opened up its long fingered hand and gently dropped a small pile of Reese's Pieces onto his lap. He looked at them and soon realized that it had followed the trail he had left for it leading up to here and now it was giving a little of it back to him. As he looked into the creature's face he saw that it's big, blue eyes were wide and gentle, and somehow seemed to be pleading with him. Was it the candy he wanted? He reached into the bag beside him and held some out to it, and it accepted them and soon there was a gentle crunching noise as it placed them into its wide mouth. As Elliot watched he saw that the creature was really harmless and felt that he couldn't leave it outside in the cold air. So he got out of his sleeping bag, got off the lawn chair and using his flashlight for a guiding light, he began making another trail of the Reese's Pieces for it as he began to lead it into his house. He left the Reese's Pieces at his doorstep, and then led the creature up the stairs as he made sure to leave a little of the candy on each step. When at last he reached his bedroom, he left a little pile of them at the doorway and watched as the creature's long fingers reached inside and began collecting them once again. Smiling, Elliot went over to his desk and laid down the nearly empty Reese's Pieces bag, and picked up an apple as he thought the creature might like this as well. However, when he went to the doorway of the room he found the creature was no longer there and was now inside of the room. He watched as it looked curiously at the many things that were on his dresser and began reaching up to them with its very long fingers and touching them and poking at them,and then his long fingers upset a tin can filled with pencils and there was a great clattering noise that followed, and then the creature threw back its long arms and upset a nearby shelf, making more noise. Elliot was suddenly in a panic as he hurriedly closed his door, he listened at it for a moment to make sure no one had woken up. Then he quickly took a woolen blanket off of his bunk bed and wrapped it around the creature to conceal it, and at first it reacted as it muttered nervously but then it relaxed as it clutched onto the blanket and seemed to take comfort from it. Elliot stepped back as he sighed with relief and looked at the creature in front of him. He now had a very good look at him, and he was no longer afraid of him at all. He looked him over from his oblong head, to his long, thin arms and round belly which were mostly covered by the blanket. He looked it into its turtle-like face with its great big blue eyes which were spread far apart and saw that they were gazing at him with the very same curious expression, as if they had never seen a human before. As he continued to look at him in awe and fascination, he just happened to bring up his hand and slightly scratch his nose. He watched in astonishment as the creature in front of him scratched its own pug-like nose in much the same way. Elliot thought for a moment, and then slightly touched two fingers to the corner of his mouth, and he then watched as the creature pressed two fingers to its own mouth which had a different shape from his own. Then he touched his hand to the side of his head and rubbed his ear slightly, and it did the same, although its ears weren't as easy to see. Then he held up his right hand with all five fingers spread and sure enough, it did the same, except that it had only four fingers which were twice as long as his. He then held out just one finger and crooked it slightly, which the creature did as well, in the very same way. Elliot smiled then, and so did the creature. It seemed they were the same, just a little different. Then he began to feel very sleepy, and he noticed that the creature's eyes were drooping as well. He yawned, and so did the creature and it closed its eyes as it held the blanket. It was quite late, and so Elliot stepped slowly backward and sat down into his comfortable armchair and drifted off to sleep. The creature looked at the boy's sleeping form in the chair and smiled as now he was sure that he had found someone whom he could trust. The next morning as Elliot awoke from his slumber E.T. yawned as he opened his eyes and watched his human friend change out of his nightie-nights and into a new set of clothes. As he watched him with curiosity he found he was now able to ask the question he wanted to before. \"Why is it you wear... clothes?\" Elliot looked at E.T. as he tucked in his shirt and tried to think of a good answer for that. \"We wear clothes for warmth... and for... dignity.\" \"Dignity...?\" E.T. sounded out this word which seemed to be new to him. Elliot tried his best to explain. \"It means they show us who we are in way which we hope others will appreciate us that way, which makes us feel special.\" E.T. listened to this information very carefully and tried to make sense of it, for his race never had the need for clothing as their planet was always comfortably humid, and as for dignity, he and his fellow botanists could always give each other their thoughts and feelings through their heart-lights which he doubted any one of them would want to conceal with needless clothing. Just then they heard Elliot's mother call for them from downstairs. \"Elliot, E.T., breakfast is ready!\" \"Coming, Mom!\" Elliot called back. He looked at E.T. and smiled. E.T. smiled and nodded in assurance. Then Elliot took E.T.'s hand and led him down the stairs and into the kitchen where they found Michael and Gertie seated in their own chairs at the table while Mary served them plates of waffles with maple syrup and scrambled eggs and toast. Elliot smiled as he pulled out a chair for E.T. and gently lifted him onto him, and then sat into his own chair and started on his waffles. E.T. glanced around him and saw that he was surrounded my the four humans he had grown to love, and he knew he could trust, including Mary whom he had just barely gotten to know on his last visit but whom he loved nevertheless as she was the mother of the three children who had saved his life. Carefully, he picked up a fork which was set beside his plate and dug it into his waffles and after taking off a large portion of it he placed it into his mouth just as he watched Elliot do. Then all at once his mouth was filled with a sensational taste he had never tasted before. \"This is just exquisite!\" he exclaimed as he swallowed and looked towards Mary with his eyes shining. \"I'm so glad you like them!\" said Mary with joy and relief. \"I wasn't sure what to make for a visiting extra-terrestrial.\" Gertie could hardly believe that E.T. was actually having breakfast with all of them just like he was a friend of the family, which of course he was, it was a dream come true. \"Why couldn't you speak before?\" she asked as she noticed his improved vocabulary. \"I just did not know your language,\" E.T. explained.\"I hadn't known anything about humans before I was lost here last time, and now I am glad that I do know.\" \"Why were you lost here anyway?\" asked Elliot. E.T. told his story. \"My companions and I were on a plant-collecting mission to Earth, you see I am a botanist and I study and take care of plants. We had been visiting Earth for plant samples for centuries, yet whenever made any contact with human-beings.\" \"Why not?\" asked Gertie. E.T. sighed with regret. \"As I said we didn't know how humans were like,and we were afraid of them. We had only heard that they much bigger and more powerful than us, and about the damage they had done to their own planet in the past couple hundred years, and so avoided them altogether. Then there came that night I wandered far from our spaceship, and I looked over a hill to see your city below it, and then those men found me and chased me, I was never so scared in my life!\" \"But how could you ran away from them when your legs are so short?\" asked Michael. \"I use my arms to run,\" explained E.T. as he stretched out his arms a little so they could see how long they were. \"I have strong arms, and so I escape them. But I did no make it to the spaceship in time. My companions were so in hurry they leave me accidentally. I thought my heart would break.\" Elliot knew just how E.T. felt.\"But why were you willing to trust me if you were so afraid?\" \"I had nothing to lose, you left me a trail of something that somehow gave me energy,\" he looked deeply Elliot's eyes with his own great blue orbs. \"Then when we met there was something in you I really liked, as if we were meant to make contact.\" Elliot smiled as he and E.T. transcended another memory to each other. Elliot watched from his bedroom window as his mother pulled out of the driveway, taking his sister and brother to school. Once they had left, he stood in front of his open closet in which the mysterious creature he had welcomed into his home the night before was hidden inside of. \"Come on,\" he said gently as he knelt beside the closet and beckoned the creature out of it with his hand. \"Don't be afraid. It's alright. Come on. Come on.\" The creature waddled slowly out of the closet, still wrapped in the blanket Elliot had lent him last night, and stood in front of him. Elliot now had its full attention and he wondered if he could possibly speak with it. \"Do you talk? You know, talk?\" he asked it gently. The creature just looked at him silently, it somehow seemed confused. Elliot made another try as he gestured toward himself saying, \"Me human. Boy... Elliot... El-li-ot... Elliot.\" He sounded out his name but the creature only continued to look at him as if he couldn't understand him at all. He watched as it turned its attention towards the many things that were on the table beside them. He noticed his curious expression and began to explain the things to him. \"This is coke, see? We drink it,\" he said as he picked up a half empty can of soda and showed it to the creature. \"It's... uh... it's a drink. You know... food.\" These are toys,\" he showed it his action figures from Star Wars , one of his favorite movies. \"These are little men. This is Greedo, and then this is Hammerhead. See... this is Walrus Man, and then this is Snaggletooth, and this is Lando Calrissian. See? And this is Boba Fett. And, look, they can even have wars. Look at this!\" He gave a brief demonstration as he played it out. \"And look, fish,\" he said as he showed it his pet goldfish, two in a glass bowl full of water.\"The fish eat the fish food,\" he said as he put in a light sprinkling of it. \"And the shark eats the fish.\" He dipped a plastic shark head on a stick into the fish bowl. \"But nobody eats a shark.\" \"See. this is Pez,\" he went on as he held up a Pez dispenser. \"Candy. See, you eat it. You put the candy in here, and then when you lift up the head, the candy comes out, and you can eat it! You want some? Oh, this is a peanut. You eat it. But you can't eat this one, 'cause this is fake.\" He pointed to his peanut shaped bank. \"This is money.\" He held up a small silver disk. \"See? We put the money in the peanut. He dropped the coin into the tiny opening in the plastic peanut. \"You see? Bank. You see?\" \"And then this is a car. This is what we get around in.\" He picked up one of his toy cars and held it out to the creature.\"You see? Car.\" E.T. had been trying to listen carefully to Elliot's speech but it hadn't been easy because of his breathless delivery, and he was also very hungry as he hadn't eaten in twenty-four hours. He impulsively took hold of the toy car Elliot was holding out to him and sunk his teeth into its thin metal. \"Hey! Hey, wait a second!\" Elliot exclaimed as he quickly took the toy from the creature's hand. \"No, you don't eat them! Are you hungry? I'm hungry.\" He looked understandingly at the hungry little creature. \"Stay,\" he said as he began to slowly walk away from the creature. \"Stay. I'll be right here,\" he assured it as he stepped over to the door. \"I'll be right here.\" And with that he left the room with the creature alone inside it. Elliot entered into the kitchen and wondered what a creature like E.T. might like for breakfast. \"Let's see... what would he want?\" he wondered as he opened the refrigerator door. Looking inside he took hold of a bowl of fruit. \"He'll like this,\" he thought. He reached in again and took hold of a quart of milk, \"and this,\" he found a jar of peanut butter and of grape jelly, \"and he'll like this,\" and he closed the refrigerator door, found a loaf of bread, and set to making two sandwiches for him and his guest. Once E.T. had been left alone, he looked around the strange room he was in, and then true to his nature he couldn't remain in the same spot for long. He waddled over to a corner of the room where he saw a very peculiar looking object which reminded him of a kind plant that he once studied. It had a long and skinny stem while its long leaves were drooping downward. Once he had reached the far end of the room, he took hold of the stem of the thing that looked like a plant, and as he did so he heard it click slightly and before he could blink the leaves of the plant opened up into his face and he saw a slight glint of something shiny in-between them. Then he suddenly remembered how the plant he once looked at before could really bite if it was touched in the wrong way. With a high-pitched shriek of horror, he leapt from the corner and into the closet in a second, and hid himself in the stuffed animals. Elliot had just made the sandwiches and had gathered everything he had chosen into his arms and was just to carry them out of the kitchen when all of sudden, for no reason known to him, he became frightened. His heart leapt into his throat as he let out a scream and dropped everything he was holding onto the floor as he jumped up as if he thought something was trying to catch him. A moment later he stood, backed up against the refrigerator door as he looked down at the things he had dropped. He took a deep breath to calm himself down as he put his hand over his rapidly beating heart, wondering what possibly could have frightened so suddenly like that. I hope I'm not going crazy! he thought as he bent down and gathered all of the things he had dropped into his arms again. Then, glad that at least no one had been around to see him act so crazy, he climbed the stairs to his room. Once he was inside the room again, he looked around for the creature but could find it nowhere. Then he heard it moaning pitifully from inside his closet. Stepping over to the closet, he moved a few stuffed animals out of the way and there he found it, trembling as if it were terrified. \"Are you a okay? Too much excitement, huh?\" Elliot said. \"Want a coke?\" he held out a can of soda to the creature. It just continued shivering from head to toe, and pointed a long, trembling finger at the object of it's terror across the room. Elliot followed the creature's finger. \"I see you've found my umbrella,\" he said as he saw it lying open on the floor. As he went to the corner to pick it up, something very remarkable occurred to him. That the creature must have touched the umbrella and made it open, which must have frightened him if he didn't know what it was, and then when he was in the kitchen he had somehow felt his fright just as if it were his own. But how was such a thing possible? He quickly decided that the mystery of it did not matter right now, and what did matter was reassuring the creature it had nothing to fear. He brought the umbrella over to the frightened and trembling E.T. and took hold of his left hand, holding it tightly in his own. \"It's okay. Don't be afraid,\" he said soothingly. \"It's just my umbrella. I use it to keep dry when it rains. It won't hurt you. See?\" He held onto his umbrella and closed it, and then put it aside. Then he took hold of both of E.T.'s hands and pressed them into his own as he said, \"Just as long as you're with me you'll always be safe. I'd never let anyone harm you.\" Then another remarkable thing happened. As E.T. listened to Elliot he could not understand the words, and yet he also felt a real sense of trust and reassurance from him as he squeezed his hands. He calmed down and then the two of them started on their breakfast. As Elliot remembered about that time, he looked over at E.T. and thought he really had come a long way from the frightened little creature he had first met him as. Now Gertie had a question. \"Why did you get so sick?\" E.T. became very reflective. \"I wasn't used to the atmosphere of Earth, and I knew I couldn't last long after my companions left me behind, and my heart-light went out and I lost all my connection with them. I was alone. I worried I'd be lost from them forever, the more I thought of that the sadder I became, and I began to feel very bad inside, I couldn't breath.\" \"And then... did you really die?\" Gertie asked after a moment of silence. \"I don't know... I suppose I did,\" E.T. admitted. \"I thought I'd been asleep... then I began to awake... at first it was cold... and then it got warmer, and warmer... and then I saw the face of my captain as I felt my heart-light turn on and I heard him say they were on their way for me.\" He sighed happily as he remembered. \"What is your home like? What is it called?\" Gertie was suddenly curious. \"It is called The Green Planet, because it grows more plants than any other in the Universe,\" E.T. was quite happy to be able to talk of his home planet. \"I take care of many plants as I am one of the head botanists there, and the plants take care of us also. They keep our atmosphere clean and warm and comfortable, and that keeps us happy. Everyone is always caring of each other.\" As E.T. continued to tell them about his home, Michael listened with intense interest and a smile on his face. He had always dreamed of meeting an alien, or at least someone like E.T., and yet he was always sure he never would, and yet E.T. came along, and now here was again with all of them. He could remember when he had first met E.T. just like it was yesterday... He had just returned home from football practice, he entered into the kitchen and got himself a coke from the fridge. Then when he climbed the stairs, he saw the door of Elliot's room open. \"Mike! Mike, come in!\" Elliot called to him eagerly. He came to him and stood in the doorway. \"How you feeling' faker?\" he teasingly asked. \"I'm feeling fine,\" Elliot replied calmly. \"Look, I've got something really important to tell you.\" Then he couldn't help bragging about his friends. \"You know what? Tyler said he got 69,000 on Asteroids yesterday. But he pulled the plug!\" Elliot held up his hands for him to listen to him as he said, \"Look, remember the goblin?\" \"You're so lame, Elliot,\" he said with disappointment. \"Come on, Michael,\" said Elliot as he looked at him seriously. \"He came back.\" This just has to be a joke, he thought. \"He came back? He came back! Oh my God!\" He pretended something was pulling his head out of the door. Elliot promptly caught onto him. \"One thing!\" he said as he continued to look at him seriously. \"I have absolute power. Say it. Say it.\" Now he was confused. He had never seen Elliot look so seriously before. He remembered how two nights ago Elliot had claimed there was something hiding inside the shed, and then the next day he had said he had encountered a creature in the middle of the night, hiding in the cornstalks. \"What have you got? Is it the coyote?\" he asked as Elliot led him into the room, closing the door behind them. \"No,\" said Elliot. He led him to the center of the room. \"Okay, now... swear it. The most excellent promise you can make. Swear as my only brother, on our lives...\" \"Okay, don't get so heavy. I swear,\" he said quickly. What could Elliot possibly have that could be so important? \"Okay, now stand over there,\" he led him over near the closet, and turned him away from it. \"And,\" he added, \"you'd better take off your shoulder pads.\" \"What!\" He was proud of his shoulder pads. \"You might scare him,\" said Elliot. \"And, close your eyes.\" \"Don't push it, Elliot,\" he said annoyed as he took off his shoulder pads. \"I'm not coming out until your eyes are closed,\" Elliot said from inside the closet. \"Okay, they're closed,\" he said as closed his tightly and groaned with frustration. A moment later, Elliot spoke again with calm seriousness. \"Okay, swear it one more time. I have absolute...\" \"You are absolute power! Yes!\" he exclaimed in a Yoda imitation. Then he turned around... He was stunned as he saw a creature he had never seen standing right beside Elliot. It was short and pudgy with very long arms and very short legs. It also had a flat head and a wrinkled face with huge blue eyes... and it was smiling at him. He just didn't know what to think. Just as Michael ended his reverie, Mary re-entered the kitchen as she had left to get their mail. In one hand she held a few bills to be paid, and a letter in the other. Her face was very solemn. \"What is it, Mom?\" asked Elliot, sensing what it could be. Mary sighed as she held out the neatly folded letter. \"It's from your father.\" Elliot, Michael, and Gertie all became still and silent as E.T. just looked around at them as he couldn't understand the gravity of the situation. Then Mary handed Elliot the letter,which he unfolded and began to read. Dear Elliot, I have moved on from Mexico now and have made a few friends, though I have not really decided whether to settle down yet. I hope you all are are alright as I miss you all. It is almost Christmas and it is very cold down here, which makes me miss you all the more. Now, I cannot promise, but I am hoping to be able to visit you for Christmas, if even at the last minute. I love you always. Dad. Elliot had tears in his eyes as he finished reading the letter and slowly folded it up again. E.T. could sense his friend's emotions and he suddenly remembered one time from his last visit when he had been hiding in the closet that was filled with stuffed animals, and he spoken with them... \"Elliot is nice and you can certainly trust him,\" said a large brown teddy bear beside of him. \"He always took good care of me. I was a gift from his father when he was five years old.\" \"Where is he now?\" asked E.T. curiously. \"We're not sure,\" admitted a large blue elephant in front of him. \"He is no longer here,\"sadly said a Raggedy Ann doll. \"I was with Gertie when he left just a month ago. I can still feel her tears on me from that day.\" \"What was it that happened?\" asked E.T. sympathetically. \"If I remember right, it is called divorce,\" said a large yellow furred lion. \"Whatever it's called, their Dad has moved out for good.\" \"But why?\" asked E.T. \"We're not quite sure of that, either,\" said a long-armed monkey. \"But I used to belong to Elliot's big brother Michael, if you've met him, until he gave me to Elliot about five years ago, and I...\" However, it was just then that Mary entered the room. E.T. quickly stood completely still and silent with his big, blue eyes unfocused as he watched the tall woman gather some of the children's clothes for the laundry, and then calmly leave. E.T. breathed a small sigh of relief and looked again to his stuffed friends. \"I miss Michael, though,\" said the monkey. \"We used to have the greatest adventures.\" In the present time, E.T. tenderly laid one of his long arms onto his friend's shoulder. After a moment of being silent, Mary suddenly brightened a little and said, \"Well, now I hope you will enjoy your visit with us, my dear E.T.\" E.T. smiled at the kindly woman. \"I'm sure I will,\" he said. \"This will be my first Christmas, so it will be my best.\"[Chapter 3] That afternoon, Elliot took E.T. with him to get a Christmas tree. The two of them walked hand in hand to the local Christmas Tree Lot, where the smell of fresh pine filled the cold air around them. \"So, you see,\" Elliot said to his little companion. \"Every year we find the perfect tree and decorate it in the living room where Santa Claus leaves the gifts and stuff.\" E.T. was a botanist of his planet, and knew all about trees. As he approached a long row of evergreens, he began to converse with them. \"Hello! E.T. very pleased to meet you!\" he began, speaking through telepathy. \"Elliot say he need Christmas tree, would any of you mind if we chose you?\" \"We all want to be Christmas trees! That was why we were all grown!\" exclaimed the trees. \"Choose me!\" exclaimed one very big and wide tree. \"I have extra space and can hold many more ornaments!\" \"Choose me!\" exclaimed one very tall and proud tree with extended branches. \"I come from a very long line of Christmas trees! There isn't a member of my family tree that wasn't one!\" \"Choose me!\" exclaimed one very green and lovely tree. \"I am young and strong, and can last a long, long time!\" E.T. looked from one tree to the other, and couldn't decide. They all seemed like the perfect one, each in their own way. He put his hands to the sides of his head and shook it back and forth. Then he suddenly spotted one tree which was smaller than the rest. It stood by itself, its branches weren't too short or too long, its green was light and shiny. As far as he, as an intergalactic botanist, could see, there was nothing wrong with it. \"Don't mind me,\" said the tree shyly. \"It's one of the others you want, not me! I've already been rejected twice by a human customer!\" E. T's heart began to grow bright red within his chest, as he knew this was the right tree for him, and Elliot's family. Elliot, who was standing close by, saw E. T's heart-light glow and knew it meant something. \"This one!\" E.T. pointed his glowing fingertip at the chosen tree. Elliot smiled. \"Okay, E.T. If you think it's the perfect one, it is.\" The owner of the lot was rather confused with Elliot's choice, though one look at E.T. and he didn't question it. So Elliot soon had the tree tied onto the end of his bicycle, and with E.T. sitting comfortably in the basket with a sheet around him, he rode home and on the way they past by the park. Looking around, Elliot began to remember when he and E.T. had first met. It was late at night, and Elliot had been lying in his bed asleep when he was awakened abruptly by sudden noise coming from outside. He just knew there was something out there, even if no one would believe him. He put on his red jacket, without bothering to put on shoes, and taking his flashlight he stepped out of the back door and into the cool night air. He shined the flashlight around the shed but could find no signs of life. He walked farther away and into the garden in which his mother grew vegetables. All around him there was darkness except for the light of the moon which he noticed was a half crescent as he briefly glanced up at the cloudy sky. He shivered slightly, not entirely from the chill in the air. He began whistling lightly to himself to try to remain calm. He heard a sudden shuffling noise coming from within the cornstalks, and he approached them holding his flashlight in front of him, wondering what could possibly be hiding in them. He remembered how he used to hear about goblins that lived in the forest and came out only at night. \"Elliot, you're crazy,\" he muttered to himself. He began searching through the tall cornstalks. He could find nothing hiding in them. Then he reached the end of them and shined his flashlight onto some nearby bushes, and down into a small clump of cornstalks and discovered a set of very strange looking footprints covering the ground that led into them. His breathing became heavier and his hands trembled slightly as he clutched the flashlight tightly in his left hand while he pulled away the cornstalks that were in front of him with his right, and then... There was a very ugly looking creature with enormous eyes that were staring widely at him, and very long arms with very long fingers that were stretched out and waving frantically in front of him, and its mouth was open wide in a grimace as it made a very inhuman sort of noise. He was so terrified he dropped his flashlight and fell over backwards, screaming in horror. He glanced around in all directions quickly, and suddenly he saw the cornstalks rustling in the wind as if the goblin, or whatever had been in them, had just ran away. He quickly leapt to his feet and began chasing after the creature, but could see it nowhere. He stopped in front of a set of swings which were moving slowly as if something had just pushed them by. He looked straight ahead as he watched a few trashcans rolled down the hill. The mysterious creature was gone and he stood there for a few moments in bewilderment before he finally went into the house again. That was when he first saw E.T. It was amusing now, but it had been scary then. Once they had arrived home, Elliot dragged the tree inside and Michael and their mother took hold of it and stood it up against the wall in the left corner of the living room. It looked quite beautiful there. \"It's a very nice tree,\" Mary said, smiling as she looked it over. \"And it will look even nicer with all the decorations on.\" \"I'll go get them now!\" Elliot exclaimed eagerly. With E.T. following close behind him, Elliot climbed the steps leading up to the attic, in which all of their Christmas tree ornaments and other decorations were stored for the rest of the year long. Once he had reached the topmost step, he reached out and took hold of E.T.'s long hand and gently pulled him up the the last few steps and set him down beside him on the attic's floor. \"It very dark up here,\" E.T. muttered as he glanced around the darkness that surrounded most of the attic. \"That's easily taken care of,\" Elliot said as he pressed his hand against the wall beside them and turned on the light that hung on the ceiling of the attic. \"That better,\" said E.T. as he glanced around the now softly lit attic. It was a fairly small room with boxes in nearly every place they looked. He also noticed that many of them were lightly covered in a white and fuzzy substance which he had never seen before. Curiously, he rubbed his long fingers against the side of one of the boxes that were closest to him and then rubbed the fuzzy stuff between his fingers as he brought them close to his face. \"What is this strange stu - uhh- ahh...\" The fuzzy substance seemed to be irritating his nose and he began rubbing it to try to make it go away but it seemed to only make it worse. Fortunately, Elliot noticed his distress and quickly took a polka-dot handkerchief out of his back pocket and brought it to E.T.'s face, and he took hold of it and pressed it over his nose and mouth just in time to smother one big sneeze. E.T. wiped his nose and then handed the handkerchief back to Elliot, though he wasn't sure if he should. But Elliot smiled as he took hold of it and tucked it into his pocket again. \"Sorry it's so dusty up here,\" Elliot said with an apologetic smile. \"I didn't think of it.\" Dust, that was what the fuzzy stuff was called? E.T. remembered that not everything on this planet agreed with him to well. He took another glance at the dust that was on the floor and thought of something. He lit his right fourth finger and tucked it into his whole right hand so that it also began to glow just a little. Then Elliot watched in wonder as he gently laid his hand down onto the dusty floor and then for just a moment the whole room, and all of the boxes in it, were aglow with a strange pinkish light, and then once the light had vanished, so did all of the dust with not one single speck of it remaining. \"Wow...!\" Elliot whispered under his breath after a moment of stunned silence. Then he looked at his extra-terrestrial friend and smiled. Just as before, he never ceased to amaze him. Then Elliot took hold of the large, cardboard box that was closest to them and opened it's flaps and began to show E.T. the things inside it. \"See, these are Christmas balls, we hang them on the tree.\" He held up two round glass balls by two tiny hooks. One was red and one was silver and they both had a bright shine that slightly reflected Elliot's face in them. \"Shiny,\" E.T. observed. Elliot smiled and reached into the box again and took out a different set of ornaments from it. \"Look, see this is Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer,\" he said as he held up a little plastic reindeer with a shiny red nose. \"This is Frosty the Snowman,\" he held up a little plastic snowman with a top hat and a red scarf and round black eyes and a cute smiling face. \"This is the Nutcracker Prince,\" he held up a small wooden toy soldier by a string. E.T. smiled with interest, and Elliot reached deep into the box again and took out a a medium-sized snow-globe with a Santa Claus inside, holding a large sack, beside of a tall Christmas tree in front of a window, next to a lamppost. \"Look! You see, this is a snow globe!\" Elliot said excitedly. E.T. stared at it curiously as he extended his neck a few inches. \"Um...uh... h-how does it work?\" he muttered. Elliot smiled. \"Like this, you just hold it tightly, and give it a little shake... and now the snow is flying all around!\" E.T. giggled with delight. \"E.T. love snow globe!\" he exclaimed as he held it within his long and graceful fingers. \"And, you see this is Santa Claus,\" said Elliot as he pointed out the painted figure in the snow globe that was of a man with a long white beard and a round belly, and dressed in bright red costume, and his chubby face was kindly and rosy-cheeked. \"He is the guy that comes down our chimney on Christmas eve and puts the presents under the tree. He lives at the North Pole, and he has elves that make the toys in workshops and he has a sleigh that is pulled by eight reindeer, and faster than anything so that he can visit all of the houses with children in the world in just one day.\" E.T. listened to all of this with intense interest. \"How does Elliot know all of this?\" he wondered aloud. \"My dad told me all about him when I was a little kid, younger than Gertie,\" Elliot explained, and at first he was smiling and then his expression became more somber as he recalled a time when he had first learned about Santa Claus... It was the Christmas eve of when Elliot was three years old, and he was laying in his father's lap as they sat beside the fireplace. Elliot was thinking about a few things that were concerning him right now. \"Why does Santa Claus live at the North Pole?\" \"Because he is happy there, and he wants to stay in a place that is safe from the rest of the world. He wants no one to spy on him, or find out his deepest secrets,\" his father had replied, stroking his hair tenderly. \"So, no one ever sees him?\" \"That is not quite true. He has his own special ways of traveling, and sometimes in disguise, so only certain who deserve to see him can.\" After a moment of silence, Elliot spoke again. \"Are you sure Santa will come tonight?\" \"Of course I am,\" his father assured him as he held close. \"But how does he know where we live, and how does he know what I want when I can't write to him?\" he asked slightly worriedly. \"He has his own special ways of knowing about those things as well,\" his father kindly assured him again. \"The wishes of children everywhere will always reach him in some way, whether through the mail, or on the wind from their hearts, and wherever there is a house in which he is welcome it will be found by his magic sleigh.\" Elliot smiled, and then he thought of something else. \"Santa gives presents to everyone, but does he ever get any himself?\" \"Of course he does. You see, he brings joy and happiness to all in the world and so he receives love and respect from the world in return. Remember, Elliot, there are many different kinds of presents to give, and the best kind of all is the gift of love.\" Elliot smiled and closed his eyes sleepily as his father kissed his forehead. Elliot now sighed as the memory came to its end. That was seven years ago and he could remember it as if it were from yesterday. It was also from a time when he believed that his parents would always be together and his father would always be right where he has needed most; and now it was all he could do to hope for him to be able to come visit them this Christmas. Then all of a sudden he felt a strangely tender touch to his face. He blinked and turned his head slightly to see E.T. right beside him as he was very gently wiping away a stray tear from his cheek and his face held a sympathetic smile, just like he understood exactly what he was feeling right now from his memories. Elliot smiled at his otherworldly best friend as he felt that he was just grateful to be able to spend Christmas with him at least. After all, without him he would have been completely lost. He reached his hand into the box beside him again and felt something big and pointy inside. He smiled as he took hold of it and pulled it out from the very bottom of the box. \"Look! This is the Christmas Star for the top of the tree!\" he said cheerfully as he showed it to E.T. E.T. smiled as he took hold of the star and felt that it was made of some kind of plastic. \"Why made of this?\" he asked curiously. Elliot smiled and said, \"So that the light inside of it will be able to shine through it when it's plugged in.\" \"Plugged in?\" E.T. looked very confused. Elliot chuckled as he said, \"You'll see soon. Come on.\" They gathered a few of the boxes in their arms and left the attic. They brought the boxes into the living room and sat them close to the tree. Then everyone began to decorate the tree. Elliot showed E.T. how to put on the silver tinsel,and then they began to put the red and white candy canes on. At one point, E.T. took a small lick of one just to find out how it tastes, and it slightly burned the tip of his tongue with a rather unpleasant kind of taste. They began to put the ornaments on next, there were many different kinds of them and once E.T. found one which was blue with tiny yellow balls encircling around it and it's top ended in a small point. His big blue eyes opened wide as his mouth spread into a smile of surprise and delight. \"Spaceship!\" he exclaimed, and thus got everyone's attention. Elliot smiled as he took hold of it. \"It really does look like it!\" he said with a chuckle. \"The guy that made it must have seen your spaceship, and remembered!\" Gertie exclaimed with delight. \"That is so cool!\" Michael added. E.T. smiled and then reached his fingers upward as high as they could go, and proudly placed the ornament that looked like a spaceship onto a branch near the top of the tree where it could stand out above the rest. Then everyone put the colorful electric Christmas lights around the tree, and once they almost became tangled around E.T.'s long neck. Then, when the tree was fully decorated, E.T. took hold of the Christmas Star, which he had instantly f fallen in love with, and Michael picked him up, quite easily, and E.T. places the star onto the very top of the tree with loving care. Michael tenderly set E.T. down onto the floor again, and Mary found the cord that was connected to the lights of the tree and plugged it into the outlet. \"Here we go,\" she said eagerly. Everyone waited for the lights to turn on, and yet they did not. \"The lights seem to be broken,\" Mary said sadly. Michael, Elliot, and Gertie moaned with disappointment. E.T. seeing this quickly came up with a very bright idea. He waddled over to the outlet which the lights were plugged into, and very carefully unplugged the cord and replaced it with his long finger which he had lit, and then in a second all of the lights around the tree and also the star on top of it lit with a very colorful brilliance. Everyone in the room was soon smiling with surprise, delight, and relief. The Christmas Tree had never looked as beautiful as it did right now. E.T. noticing their happiness smiled and the light inside his heart began to also glow a loving bright red.[Chapter 4] E.T. waddled down the sidewalk with Elliot leading him along by his left hand and Gertie by his right one. They were now headed towards what they called a Mall, which E.T. had never heard of, although the name did remind of some other distant planet he and his companions had visited once long ago. He was wearing a bright red hooded jacket which Elliot had loaned him, and a pair of dark blue boots which Gertie had loaned him, and a pair of thick long-fingered green gloves which Michael had loaned him. Over his big blue eyes he wore a pair of big sunglasses with dark lenses. As they walked along he looked out of the corners of his big sunglasses and noticed all the things and creatures along their way, and he couldn't help noticing how different everything looked from his previous visit to Earth. There were streams of rainbow colored lights glowing around nearly every building they passed by. He also noticed many decorated trees, which were mostly set in corners. He saw signs pasted onto windows and doors of some buildings. He could barely read them, though he could decipher the words \"Buy one, get one free!\" and \"Happy Holidays!\" He once noticed a figure standing in front of a store which looked a lot like the Santa Claus whom Elliot had told him about, he was dressed in red and white with a long curly beard and he was ringing a bell as he was saying \"Ho ho ho! Merry Christmas!\" He smiled as he saw him. Then a minute later he saw another Santa Claus figure standing on a corner with a golden pot in his hands! \"Here we are, E.T.,\" said Elliot when at last they reached their destination. The Mall was the largest building he had ever seen. As they entered he noticed so many new things. Firstly, he noticed the many human beings of this native planet, They were all so different from one another, unlike on his own planet. They varied in all shapes and sizes, and some had hair on their faces, and some just on their heads, and a few had none at all. Some also had different skin colors ranging from light, dark, and very dark. Most were tall and straight, while others were built more like he was with their bellies bulging out. While most were two or three times taller than he was, he also noticed a few tiny ones here and there which were being carried on the shoulders of the tall ones, he easily figured out these must be what those on his planet called the saplings. He truly had never seen humans like this before. It was like looking at them in a completely new perspective. He remembered very well when he had first heard about humans from his Captain. He was a young student at the time, and he was learning about space travel, and how to collect plant samples from foreign planets. \"Our next mission is on planet Earth,\" said their Captain. \"Now remember, we'll all stay close together but if some kind of emergency occurs, or if one of you should lose your way, give out the internal signal from the light of the heart.\" Here they all turned their heart-lights on. \"Also if you are ever in trouble call out the distress call,\" here he demonstrated the call. They all listened carefully to the Captain's speech, especially E.T.. \"Now, are there any questions?\" the Captain asked. E.T. promptly lit his finger for attention and spoke the first of many questions he had. \"Is it true Earth is called the Blue Planet for it's oceans?\" \"It's true,\" said the Captain. \"Earth is the bluest planet in its galaxy, next to Neptune, of course.\" \"Is it also true the creatures on the Earth, known as human beings, are the only beings in the Universe who have no knowledge of space travel, or of other universal life?\" asked E.T. \"I'm afraid it is true,\" replied the Captain. \"But why?\" E.T. asked very curiously. \"Why are they so ignorant?\" The Captain sighed as he lowered his neck. \"I don't really know. But I suppose it is because they are so absorbed with themselves and obsessed with their own superstitious ways of living they never even bothered to learn about the treasures of the universe or even of their own planet.\" \"How awful!\" exclaimed E.T. \"Why can't we just meet with them and try teaching them what they ought to know now?\" \"I really wish we could, I really do,\" admitted the Captain sadly. \"However I'm sure it is for the best we never come in contact with any human beings, at least for a very long time.\" \"But why?\" E.T. asked very confused. \"Well,\" the Captain began slowly. \"They are, as I've said before, not the most universally refined species, and they have also been very slow in evolving. You see, I myself first encountered them twenty million years ago and at the time they looked a little like us, they had long arms and flat faces though they also had a lot of dark hair on their bodies except for their faces, hands, and feet. Then about ten million years ago I was visiting Earth again and saw they had changed a great deal, they were taller and straighter with less hair and had acquired a protruding nose, and they wrapped themselves in the furs of the animals they killed for food. Then I remember when only a millennium ago I was passing over the Earth on one of my first missions as a Captain and I saw them battling one another, there was war going on nearly everywhere on the planet I could see and I remember thinking to myself 'these must be the most vicious creatures there are in the universe'. I had noticed how much their appearance, ways of living and clothing themselves had changed, though I wasn't sure if it was a good thing at all for they didn't seem much more evolved in their brains and consciousness than when they were mere animals. Now they are gradually becoming more civilized towards one another, but alas they are ruining the beautiful planet they live on by deconstructing whole forests and species of plants, animals, and polluting the very air they breath with gases, toxins, and other poisonous substances which harm their atmosphere which is now almost lethal to our health if we stay there for a long amount of time I am afraid.\" E.T. and his companions listened to the Captain's speech with wide eyes and their mouths slightly opened in shock. For a moment all were silent, and then E.T. asked hesitantly, \"Are... Are they all doomed to destruction?\" \"I don't know,\" admitted the Captain candidly. \"I just hope they will someday be able to evolve to a higher understanding of themselves, their world, and the universe. Then maybe we will all be able to properly meet with them. Right now our main concern is for their plant life which we will collect samples of from the rainforests on our first mission.\" His Captain may have been quite right about everything he had said to them, and now E.T. had new information for them about the human race. The children were far more able to care for outsiders than the bigger ones, and with his adventure on Earth with Elliot and his family he felt more confident of the Earth's population evolving to a higher intelligence and understanding of the universe. He remembered the words of his Captain when he had related to everyone about his experiences, \"My young friend, you shall someday go down in history for I have never met anyone more worthy of leadership.\" His memories were suddenly halted when his human companions stopped in front of a display of Christmas wreaths and Michael announced, \"Alright, we'll all go our separate ways now and we'll meet back here at the end of the day.\" Then he watched Michael and Gertie head into a different area as he followed Elliot into another. They went into a room with a large disc positioned on the top of the doorway. Once inside, E.T. saw hundreds upon hundreds of shiny discs in shiny cases on dozens of shelves everywhere. He could also hear a mysterious string of music coming from somewhere... Welcome to my Christmas song I'd like to thank you for the year So I'm sending you this Christmas card To say it's nice to have you here I'd like to sing about all the things Your eyes and mind can see So hop aboard the turntable Step into Christmas with me As E.T. looked around, wondering where it was coming from, a man in pressed suit standing behind a counter spoke to Elliot. \"Hello, young man, and merry Christmas. May I help you find anything?\" \"No thanks,\" replied Elliot. \"I'll just look around.\" \"Is the little fellow there your brother?\" the man inquired, looking at E.T. \"Well, yes of course he is,\" said Elliot. E.T. followed the sound of the music which became clearer as he went into the center of the room. Step into Christmas Let's join together We can watch the snow fall forever and ever Eat, drink, and be merry Come along with me Step into Christmas The admission's free He approached the source of the music, which was a small clearing in the center where a large red metal box with white stripes down the side and a green ribbon at the top was positioned on a turntable, and the music he could see was coming out of a patch of tiny holes in the side of the box. Take care in all you do next year And keep smiling through the days If we can help to entertain you We will find the ways So merry Christmas one and all There's no place I'd rather be Than asking you if you'd oblige Stepping into Christmas with me. The song ended and E.T. was awestruck and very curious as a new one began. Try to Imagine, a house that isn't a home Try to imagine, a Christmas all alone That's where I'll be Since you left me My tears could melt the snow What can I do, without you I've got no place, no place to go. This new song was much more melancholy than the first one, and it gave E.T. a sudden mysterious wave of loneliness, like the way he felt when he watched his spaceship fly away and leave him behind on Earth and the light of his heart went out instantly. But he also knew he shouldn't feel this way now, for he was with Elliot and his siblings and they were like a second family to him, and also he knew his companions would return to Earth for him in a few days after he spent this holiday here with Elliot. It'll be lonely this Christmas Without you to hold It'll be lonely this Christmas Lonely and cold It'll be cold, so cold Without you to hold This Christmas The lonely song continued though E.T. couldn't bear to listen to it. He wanted intensely to turn it off, or to change it, so he lit his right forefinger and aimed it at the air holes in the metal box. Then there was a tiny click as the sad song vanished and a new one began. Hark the Herald Angels sing Glory to the newborn King Peace on Earth and mercy mild God and sinners reconciled E.T. listened to the first verse of this new song and felt deeply disgusted for it reminded him of the old myths of the universe being ruled over by a god who would reward, punish, and pawn the cosmos as he pleased. Of course his home planet hadn't believed in it for billions and billions of years, but unfortunately the Earthly beings of this planet still held onto the myth out of stubborn pride and foolish fear. When would they learn! The universe had no governing behind it, how could it? It was all a random process of mixed cosmos which just came and went with no regard whatsoever to the meager little beings inhabiting the planets of either his or this one. Promptly, he re-lit his finger and zapped the frustrating song off and a new one instantly came on. I don't want a lot for Christmas There's just one thing I need I don't care about the presents Underneath the Christmas tree I just want you for my own More than you could ever know Make my wish come true All I want for Christmas is YOU! While this song was considerably better than the last one, it wasn't much more bearable to listen to because of the unreasonably high pitches put into the lyrics which wrecked havoc on E.T.'s delicate eardrums. Trembling, he reached out his lit fingertip again and zapped onto another song. People making lists, buying special gifts, Taking time to be kind to one and all It's the time of year when good friends are here And you wish you could give more Than just presents from a store Why don't you give love on Christmas day Even the man who has everything Would be so happy if you would bring Him love on Christmas day No greater gift is there than love This song had a very enticing feel to it and E.T. loved it for it reminded him of why he had come to Earth again to spend Christmas with Elliot and his family. His heart light glowed a bright red as he tapped his wobbly little feet to the music. People you don't know smile and nod hello Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy It's that once a year, when the world's sincere And you'd like to find a way To show the things that words can't say Why don't you give love on Christmas day The man on the street and the couple upstairs All need to know there's someone who cares Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is there than love What the world needs is love Yes, the world needs your love Why don't you give love on Christmas day Every little child on Santa's knee Has room for your love underneath his tree Give love on Christmas day No greater gift is there than love What the world needs is love Yes, the world needs your love Give love on Christmas day... The song ended and E.T. was left smiling with his heart-light glowing bright and filling his body with warmth. However, he was completely unprepared for the song which came on just then. Last Christmas, I gave you my heart But the very next day, you gave it away This year, to save me from tears I'll give it to someone special! This song was so loud it seemed to knock E.T. out with a big WHAM! He fell over backwards and his right arm shot into the air and as he zapped off the explosive song he accidentally knocked over a small tower of CDs which were stacked right beside him with a loud clang. \"Ooh... Ouch...\" he moaned as he lay fallen on the floor with a dozen shiny cases containing CDs laying scattered around him. He listened as a gentle song about walking in a winter wonderland began playing, and suddenly his right forefinger connected with a CD case which was right beside of it and his fingertip began to glow again. He slowly sat up again as he picked up the CD case and smiled as he somehow seemed to be dissecting all of the music contained on the little disc. Carrying the CD with him, he waddled out of the music store as he felt overwhelmed at discovering how amazing the variety of Earthly music was. As Michael entered into the boys section of the clothing store in the mall he met with Greg, Steve, and Tyler, his three good buddies who had been with him when they outran the government agents to rescue E.T. and take him to his spaceship in time. \"Hey fellas! How's it going'!\" he greeted as they all gave each other their high fives. \"It's going' great, Mike,\" said Tyler. \"I was just wanting to invite you to the Christmas party at my house on Friday.\" \"What kind of party is it gonna be?\" asked Michael. \"We'll all eat Christmas goodies, and play Christmas Monopoly and Dungeons and Dragons, and tell stories, and dance to the latest Christmas rap; and you don't have to take a date really by the way, and we'll also exchange cards and a few gifts.\" Michael smiled broadly. \"Hey that sounds like a lot of fun. Sure, I'd love to come, guys.\" \"Great!\" said Steve happily. \"Remember the party starts at seven and it lasts until eleven.\" \"Alright guys, and I hope then you'll also be able to see the little squashy guy at my house,\" said Michael with a grin. All three of them looked stunned suddenly. \"You mean... He's come back?\" Greg said with his mouth agape. \"Yep, he has, to spend Christmas with the family,\" Michael said proudly. He knew they would remember E.T., for the little alien had changed all of their lives for the better. \"I'm also hoping I'll see my dad again on Christmas day,\" he added softly. \"I hope you will,\" said Steve kindly. \"I remember how hard it was on you when your parents divorced. Of course I don't really know what it's like as mine have been divorced since I was two years old.\" Michael nodded understandingly. \"Yep... Well, merry Christmas guys. See you at the party,\" he tried to smile again. \"Merry Christmas to you Mike,\" said Greg as he gave him a pat on his shoulder and the four of them went in separate directions. Later as Michael was coming out of the clothing store and heading into another department, he stopped suddenly as a certain someone caught his eye. There, standing about ten feet away from him was Hailey O'Rourke. She was a tall and skinny girl of fifteen years and had long reddish blonde hair and green eyes. She also had borderline autism which isolated her at times from other girls, and boys. She was very different from a lot of people, and that was the reason why Michael liked her. He thought she looked a bit lonely, and so he walked up to her and smiled as he greeted \"Hello Hailey. Remember me? I'm Michael Taylor.\" Hailey smiled shyly in response. \"Can I help you find anything?\" asked Michael politely. \"No thanks,\" said Hailey. \"I'm just browsing around.\" \"Well, would you like to go with me to the Christmas party at Tyler's this Friday?\" he asked slightly nervously. Hailey seemed suddenly melancholy. \"I... I don't know.\" \"It'll be alright,\" he assured her. \"You don't have to talk to anybody there, just have fun, and I'll be right there with you and I'll make sure no one lays a hand on you.\" Hailey smiled warmly and said \"Okay then I'd love to come.\" Michael smiled broadly in a way which said this meant a lot to him. Hailey smiled also, and after hesitating a few moments she quietly asked Michael, \"May I ask you something kinda weird?\" \"Okay?\" Michael said, somewhat confused. Hailey leaned close to him and muttered, \"I sometimes feel like there are other beings out there watching us.\" Michael smiled as if he understood. \"I know what you mean,\" he said. \"So do I, more than you'll ever know.\" E.T. waddled his way into the department which was filled to the brim with toys. He had learned about toys who lived in homes on his last visit, he didn't know about department store toys, yet. As he was looking around, trying to decide which ones he would like to speak to first, he suddenly felt himself being picked up by a pair of strong arms and set onto a shelf lined with a series of individual figures who looked a lot like him with big sunglasses, red jackets, boots, and gloves, the only difference was the noticeably more human head behind the sunglasses. He easily figured out he had been set onto this shelf because he had been mistaken for one of these figures. \"Hello,\" he said telepathically to the one nearest to him. \"I'm E.T. from the Green Planet. Where are you from?\" \"I was made in Japan, as were many of us here,\" he said. \"My name is Elmer, and these are my brothers, Murray, Freddy, Gary, Teddy, and Jack. We are called the Hyper-Ski Lift Brothers.\" \"Hmm... Why are you called Hyper-Ski Lift Brothers?\" asked E.T. curiously. \"Because we have a special battery in us which programs us to hyper ski whenever we com in contact with snow, which is why we have on these plastic skies,\" said Elmer. \"We hope to be bought soon, before Christmas comes,\" said Murray. \"We wish to be with the children who want to play with us, for then we will be able to do what were were built and programed to do which will give our lives meaning,\" said Freddy. \"Many of our other brothers have already been bought and sold,\" said Gary. \"We miss them.\" \"I know just how you feel,\" said E.T. sympathetically. \"Toys and dolls are always arriving and leaving all the time,\" said a new voice. E.T. concentrated his telepathic energy towards the source of the voice and focused on a shelf a few feet away which was lined with a series of green plush frogs with masks tied over their faces in red, orange, blue, and purple cloth which was also tied around their arms and legs. \"Hello,\" said E.T. to them. \"What are you called, and how long have you been here?\" \"We are called the Fantastic Fearless Warrior Frog Foursome, and we've been here for over a month now,\" said the first of them. \"We were told at the factory where we were made we were based on characters in a movie which is named after us, though we haven't seen it yet, and it just came out last week.\" \"I just hope we're good guys,\" said the frog beside the first one, \"and we teach the kids who will own us soon good moral values, and about playing fair.\" \"As far as we go,\" said a different voice, \"we just like to be loved and cuddled.\" E.T. turned his attention toward the direction of the new voice and he saw on a shelf just across from him a row of small round furry creatures with pointed ears, tiny beaks, fluffy tails, and large eyes. \"We are the Furbies,\" it said. \"Me Coco.\" \"Me Tyloo,\" said another with white and black spotted fur. \"Me Tytyle,\" said another one with brown and white fur. \"Me Gnola,\" said another one with pink and yellow fur. \"Hello,\" said E.T.. He liked the Furbies, they reminded him of creatures on a planet he had visited long ago. \"We just go for love and nurturing,\" said the bright blue Furby named Coco. \"So we hope to be adopted by girls.\" \"So do we,\" said a very soft and feminine voice which belonged to a doll with long blonde hair in a box with Barbie written on it. \"My name is Barbie, and so are all the others on this shelf,\" she said. \"We were all made especially for girls, to teach them how to like who they are and feel confident to be girls.\" \"Sometimes we also teach them about love,\" said another Barbie doll with long brown hair. \"I just hope when someone buys me they will also buy my Ken, I couldn't survive without him.\" \"I don't mean to brag,\" said a metallic voice from across the shelf, \"but I can teach girls and boys so much more. In fact, they won't have much need for school once they have one of me in their position. You see, I am the smartest toy robot in the world, and also the funniest for I have over two-hundred-thousand jokes stored in my memory bank.\" E.T. was just about to ask the toy robot more questions, when suddenly he heard a very, very well known voice enter his energy wave. \"E.T.! Here you are! I've been looking everywhere for you!\" exclaimed Elliot as he stood up onto a small stool nearby and picked him up from the shelf he had been set onto a while ago. E.T. was very glad Elliot had come for him, though he was also sorry to leave the toys for he was learning so much as he was talking with them. Gertie stood in line, waiting for her turn to sit on Santa's lap. As she came closer and closer to the moment she grew more and more excited to tell him what she wanted for Christmas, and then suddenly she thought of something else... What would E.T. want for Christmas? How could she give E.T. the right gift for Christmas which would show him how much he meant to her? If she could think of something, could Santa possibly deliver it? How did he make so many deliveries in one night anyway? She was so preoccupied with these questions she hardly noticed when it was suddenly it her turn. \"Ho ho ho!\" Santa chuckled merrily. \"Come on up here little one!\" Gertie smiled and blushed as she stepped up and sat down on Santa's right knee. \"Now tell me, what do you want for Christmas?\" he asked gently. \"I want a Strawberry Shortcake doll, and a paper-flower-maker,\" she said, and then she leaned into him as close as she could and whispered into his ear, \"What would the Man in the Moon like to have for Christmas?\" Santa looked surprised for a moment and then he began to laugh again. \"Ho ho ho! Why, I'd think he'd want to come down to Earth to celebrate Christmas!\" he chortled. Then he slowly stopped laughing as Gertie looked at him very seriously. \"I really mean it,\" she said. \"What would he like? What could I give him?\" She looked at him inquisitively. \"How do you give away so many gifts all in one night? How do they all fit in your sack? How can you carry it with you on your sleigh?\" Gertie smiled and nodded. \"Thanks for the secret,\" she said. Then the elf dressed employee at the front of the line set the camera for the picture to be taken. Gertie looked straight ahead and smiled. It was just then Elliot came in line while holding E.T.'s hand. E.T. extended his neck so the hood of his jacket fell from his head, and he removed his sunglasses to see clearer, and so he got a good view of Santa as he held Gertie on his lap. \"Santa!\" E.T. called out. \"Wha!?\" Santa looked in the direction of E.T. and caught the sight of the benign alien face which was smiling so big. Then there was a audible click as the picture was taken. \"Step into Christmas\" - Elton John \"Lonely This Christmas\" - MUD \"All I Want For Christmas Is You\" - Mariah Carey \"Give Love on Christmas Day\" - Solid Harmonie \"Last Christmas\" - WHAM![Chapter 5] \"So,\" said E.T. to the piece of mistletoe he had found after learning about its history. \"You are not poisonous though a lot of people are found to be allergic to your berries.\" \"It is true,\" it replied as he held it in-between his long fingers. \"Yet me and my other relatives still find ourselves inside the homes of human beings at this time of year.\" \"Why?\" asked a puzzled E.T. \"I am considered a source of good luck in Romanian traditions, and, although no one in this part of the world really knows yet, I can effectively treat an illness called cancer.\" E.T. truly was amazed at how ignorant these humans were of the treasures their plants held within them. \"Though I am primarily brought into homes because of a Christmas tradition of two people kissing underneath me. They believe my tell of bringing good fortune will rub off onto them as love.\" E.T. could vaguely remember some time during his last visit to Earth when he had seen a human man hold a woman in his arms as they're mouths became interlocked with each others, was it called kissing... was it called love? E.T. thought he knew what love was for he was sure it was exactly what he felt whenever he thought of Elliot and his family. When Michael had once rubbed his head tenderly he had felt a wonderful surge of positive energy flow through him, was that what connecting was like? As Gertie came into the living room she held a notepad in her right hand as she went over her list of what she thought E.T. might like for Christmas: shoes, a bath, a pet monkey, thermal heated underwear, a cell phone, a pony, a basketball, a strawberry shortcake. She was really having difficulty trying to think of something. She looked up and noticed E.T. was looking at the mistletoe attached to the window, and she smiled as she suddenly had a bright idea. E.T. was standing perfectly still, and then he suddenly felt the warming sensation of his heart-light turning on as Gertie kissed him lovingly on his right cheek. \"Ooh... Thank you for make E.T. happy,\" he murmured as he turned and smiled along with Gertie. Gertie giggled for a moment, and then she said \"Come on, E.T., let's make some Christmas cookies. E.T. followed to Gertie into the kitchen, where he stood onto a stool next to her as she put on an apron, which was white with green stripes and red dots. \"Okay, E.T. The only way to make cookies is the traditional way,\" Gertie began. \"Three and a half cups of flour, one teaspoon of baking powder, One half teaspoon of salt, one cup of margarine, one and a half cups of sugar, two eggs, and two teaspoons of vanilla,\" she directed, indicating all ingredients, which were set before them. E.T. listened as he took in the sight of everything laid out, and began to concentrate on his magic. Before Gertie's wide eyes, all the things on the table began to levitate, then they began to act out Gertie's instructions, all on their own, to the rhythm of \"Jingle Bells\"! The cups dipped themselves into the sacks of flour and sugar, the teaspoons dipped themselves into vanilla, baking powder, and salt. The eggs even cracked themselves up to the tune! \"Jingle bells! Jingle bells! Jingle all the way!\" Gertie began to sing the tune as the ingredients poured themselves into the large bowl, and the wooden spoons began mixing them, by themselves. When everything was quite mixed together, Gertie explained to E.T. how they would now need to cover the dough and let it chill for two hours. So while they waited, E.T. and Gertie went into the living room where Elliot, Michael, and Mary were busily decorating the tree. Once this had been done, E.T. and Gertie returned to the kitchen, where Gertie found a rolling pin, and clean baking sheet. Gertie took mounds of dough out from the bowl. E.T. levitated the rolling pin, then it began to roll on its own over the dough until it was flat as could be. Gertie found the cookie cutters, which were in the shapes of a snowflake, Santa Claus, elf, reindeer, Christmas tree, star, and candy cane. There was a new addition, an E.T.! After they had cut as many as they could, they placed the tray full of them into a preheated oven. After eight minutes, the cookies were done. Gertie found the icing and the sprinkles, and they began to decorate them. E.T. levitated the icing very carefully as he began to spread it thinly onto the cookies. Mary stood in the kitchen doorway and smiled. \"Well,\" she stated, \"for once I am glad to be able to see the cookies without the additional mess.\" Then as the sprinkles were sprinkled on, Elliot, Michael, and the dog Harvey, came in and everyone took their share of the cookies. Then they all went into the living room and gathered around the television set. Once they were in there and E.T. saw the big strange box he remembered from his last visit and now he was able to ask the question he wanted to before. \"What is that big and strange box?\" \"It's a TV,\" said Elliot. \"We watch things on it.\" \"It's really a mechanical box of wires and cables which are connected with a satellite which sends air waves through the transmission cables and the box receives them in the form of pictures with sounds and reproduces them to fit the size of the TV,\" said Michael. \"Ah... I see,\" said E.T. lowering his neck from the screen. He remembered, somewhat vaguely, the images he had seen on the box when he had first turned it on. He had seen the image of a cat with its tail on fire which had rather upset him, then he had seen the image of a spaceship, one not like his own but one which looked like the kind Cealans used; and then he had seen a man take a woman into his arms and connect his lips with hers which was one of the most fascinating things he had seen in observing humans, and then shortly afterward he had seen how humans use their devices called phones to reach out to each other and he had been inspired to build his own transmitter to reach his companions. \"Now we'll see what kind of Christmas specials are on the air waves,\" Michael continued as he took hold of a small rectangular object with many button on it, and pressing onto one of them. E.T. blinked and lifted his head as a new series of images and sounds appeared suddenly onto the box. \" Well, young lady, what's your name?\" \" Susan Walker. What's yours?\" \" Mine? Kris Kringle. I'm Santa Claus. Oh, you don't believe that, do you?\" \" My mother is Mrs. Walker, the lady who hired you.\" \" Oh.\" \" But I must say, you're the best one I've seen.\" \" Really?\" \" Your beard doesn't have those things over your ears.\" \" That's because it's real, like I'm really Santa Claus. Go ahead, pull it. Ouch!\" \"Aw, I've already seen Miracle on 34 th Street !\" said Elliot. Michael clicked the remote again to another station and a new show came on. \" Why'd you want to save me?\" \" That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.\" \" I wouldn't be a bit surprised.\" \" Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money.\" \" Eight thousand dollars.\" \" Yeah, I'll say. Just things like that.\" \" Now, how do you know that?\" \" I told you. I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.\" \" Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?\" \" I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel second class.\" \" I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.\" As Elliot, Michael, and Gertie began to laugh, E.T. studied the TV and remembered how he had been able to change the music on the stereo in the mall by aiming his forefinger at it when it lit. He wondered if he could the same right here now. He aimed his glowing fingertip directly at the screen and it instantly changed to a different station and a different show. \" It's a dream! That's what it was! A dream!\" \" It's not a dream, Ebeneezer.\" \" For pity's sake, Marley, leave me in peace!\" \" It was for pity's sake I came here! Pity for you! I leave you, with just the tiniest chance of escaping my fate.\" \" You were always a good friend to me, Jacob, thank ye.\" \" You will be visited by three ghosts.\" \" I... I think I'd rather not.\" \" The first will appear tonight when the bell tolls one.\" \" Couldn't I take them all at once and get it over with, Jacob?\" \" The second at two o'clock and the third when the bell tolls three. I must go now.\" \" Marley wait!\" \" I'm doomed to wander through the world in everlasting repentance. Remember what has passed between us. Farewell, Scrooge!\" Not finding special interest in this one, E.T. aimed his glowing fingertip at the TV screen again and it at once changed to another station. Suddenly, Elliot took hold of the remote and exclaimed, \"Hey, I bet I know what Christmas movie E.T. would enjoy watching!\" He tuned the set into channel 4 which was just now airing a Christmas movie called Santa Claus Conquers the Martians . From the beginning onward E.T. was captivated by the story in the film which was about the residents of Mars, the neighboring planet to Earth, kidnapping Santa Claus from the North Pole so their Martian children could be as happy as the ones of Earth, and also kidnapping a human boy and girl in the process. Then everything turned out all right in the end with Santa Claus teaching the Martians how to acquire their own ways of Christmas and the Earthly Santa and the two children returning to their home planet. Once the movie had ended, Elliot, Michael, and Gertie went off to bed and E.T. followed after them. Because his feet were so small he waddled slowly and stiffly and he was halfway to Elliot's room when he heard the sound of a phone ringing. He had seen but never heard a telephone before, and so his curiosity overcame him and he crept quietly into the living room. He stayed hidden in the shadows as he watched Mary take the ringing phone off of its cradle. She held it next to her ear and muttered \"Hello?\" E.T.'s ears were not easy to see but they were very good at hearing even the faintest of sounds and voices, and so he heard the voice of the man who was on the other end of the line quite clearly. \"Hello, Mary...\" he said. \"I wish I had something better to say to you at this time... but I'm afraid I might not be able to see you on Christmas day after all...\"[Chapter 6] The next morning E.T. felt he hadn't been able to sleep very much during last night for he had been so distraught over the melancholy conversation between Mary and Elliot's dad he had overheated his telekinetic aura in trying to find out why he couldn't come on Christmas day, and all he had been able to cipher was images of the man and woman being locked to each others lips he had seen on the television screen and various other fascinating and somewhat disturbing images. E.T. felt very confused. He truly didn't understand why Elliot's dad couldn't come to see him on Christmas day. Did his dad not love him? E.T. loved Elliot and that was why he had come back to Earth to visit him for Christmas. But why would Elliot's parent – one of his parents, choose not to live with him. E.T. had left because he was more needed on his home planet than here, but he couldn't imagine a parent not being needed more than at home with their children. While humans may not yet know the secrets of the universe there was still so much he didn't know about them. With these questions weighing heavy on his mind he turned to Elliot while he was dressing and addressed him with the topic. \"Elliot... did your dad love you?\" he asked. \"I thought he did,\" said Elliot. \"He did say he loved me, and Mom, and Mike, and Gertie.\" \"Then why did he leave you here while he went away? E.T. does not understand.\" Elliot tucked his sweater in very slowly as he replied. \"He left us for Sally, he met her on a business trip and I guess he just decided he liked her more than Mom.\" \"But why?\" asked E.T., still not understanding. \"I... I don't know, E.T., I really don't. You'll have to ask Mom,\" Elliot said rashly E.T. sensed he'd caused Elliot distress and said, \"E.T. is sorry.\" Mary woke up groggily after a very uncomfortable sleep, of course it seemed every night had been uncomfortable since the first one without him laying beside her. His call last night could not have come at a more inopportune time and now she didn't know when, how, or if she should tell the kids they wouldn't see their dad on Christmas day. Of course she might have known he couldn't be relied upon as he had proven to them before, and once again it was about Sally, he'd said things weren't going to well with her now and for all she cared Sally could just jump off a boat! This was to be their first Christmas without him and for a while she had really been hoping they would be able to recapture a little of what they used to have at this time of year. She felt she had been a fool to give him her heart in the first place all those years ago, only for him to give his to someone else when she wasn't looking. And yet, she felt she would also be fooled again if he was to come back to them, and kiss her like he used to, and even try to start things over again. Maybe some were just born fools, she thought. She looked around and she didn't seem to have a shoulder to cry on, as much as she needed one, and so she stepped into the bathroom to take a shower and try to drown out her misery. When she was done she stood in front of the mirror and tried to fix her face. Then she saw the door open beside her and glancing downward she saw E.T. coming in. \"Good morning, E.T!\" she said, trying to sound cheerful. \"Good morning, Mom of my friend Elliot,\" replied E.T. \"E.T. is curious and has questions which Elliot could not answer and said only you would have answers for E.T..\" \"Well, alright, E.T. What do you want to know?\" she asked. \"How do you humans love each other, and if you love each other why do you separate? These are what E.T. is curious about.\" These had been the very least of the questions she had expected and at the moment she was clueless as to how to answer them. She looked long at E.T. who looked up at her with his big, wide, gentle, inquisitive blue eyes, calmly waiting for her to answer, and finally she spoke. \"It all begins, I suppose, when you're very young and you hear tales of people who find someone special and fall in love with each other and live happily ever after and you wish with all your heart that this will happen to you. Then as you grow older you look around for that special someone and you just can't seem to find them and the harder you look the shorter you come up, or when you think you might have seen them they turn out not be who they were at first glance.\" \"Then if you're lucky enough you find a special someone who is everything he says he is, which is everything you ever wanted, and he makes you feel special and treats you like you are the most important person in his life. Then if you're smart you spend a long time getting to know each other, or if you can't wait because you want to have his children, as was what happened with me, you get married and move into the home you've always wanted with him.\" \"Then a whole new life begins for you and you have the children you've always wanted and they are a handful but you love them as much as you and your mate love each other combined because it was that very love which brought them into the world. You like to wake up each morning and start all over again because you've got a family you love and you have good times and bad times and you don't let the bad ones overrule the good ones because you believe your love for your family will see you through anything and everything.\" \"But if it is a good as that, then why should one of you leave the other?\" E.T. asked. \"E.T. does not understand.\" \"Well, one day,\" continued Mary solemnly, \"you wake up and your special someone is looking at you completely differently, like you've changed, or he's changed, or both. You feel as if you are no longer good enough for him, not smart, not pretty enough. You start having more bad times than good times, you feel as if you are reaching your end. Then before you know it another someone has entered the life of your mate and this someone is much more special to him than you are, much smarter, much prettier. And he wants nothing to do with you anymore, and later you find out neither with your children which you've been raising together for the past fifteen years. And so, after a long discussion you go to court and get separated from your no longer special someone and you keep the children because his new mate has no interest in them. He goes away with her to Mexico even though he hates Mexico which shows how much more he loves her than you. Now you're left behind to raise three children by yourself, struggling just to make ends meet, worrying forever about how this terrible twist of fate will affect your kids!\" Mary finished with an almost uncontrollable sob. E.T. now had all the information he needed as he could feel Mary's pain mentally and emotionally. He lit his left forefinger as he reached up and touched Mary at the tip of her heart, regenerating her with the happy energy she had felt in the past few days. Instantly her eyes dried, her face relaxed, and her breath calmed. \"E.T. is sorry,\" he said once again. \"It's alright,\" Mary said softly. \"I suppose parents never separate where you come from.\" \"No,\" he replied. \"Actually, we all have only one parent as we are the same gender and we self-implant our offspring when we come to the right age.\" \"You're so lucky,\" Mary said enviously. She then went into the kitchen to make breakfast while she listened to a song on the radio called Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas.[Chapter 7] Later in the evening E.T. came out of the closet and found Mary in the living room as she was on the couch sitting perfectly still and staring straight ahead at the television set looking about as stone faced as could be imagined. E.T. felt very curious as he listened to the news stories that were being broadcast through the television set. \" Talk about a Holiday scare,\" a reporter was speaking. \"A couple comes home to discover crooks in their living room trying to rip them off. The duo of thieves wearing ski masks held the victims at gun point as they took off with the goods. They quickly got away. Now police are in search of the Christmas Eve bandits.\" E.T. felt most disheartened at hearing this report for now he knew what the word bandit meant. Before he had assumed it to mean something good because it was a B word which had been the first letter he had learned, so now to learn it meant crooked thieves who ripped other people's good off of them was from troubling for him. The reporter went on to the next story, \"A little boy is still hanging on tonight after he was found in the bottom of a pond yesterday. The two-year-old is in critical condition in Children's Hospital, and we told you yesterday he had wandered off from his parents at Bay Side and neighbors found him in the water. The Rescue Crew said he had been underwater for three minutes\" The broadcast shifted to show the image of a small toddler laying very still in a hospital bed with an almost ghostly pale complexion. E.T.'s tender heart went out to the child and he lit his forefinger as he aimed it at the television screen and whispered \"Heal.\" However, before he could see if it took the desired effect the picture shifted again to the reporter continuing on with the next story. \" A Ukrainian Plane goes down over at Iran with fatal consequences. All forty-six people aboard the plane were killed as the plane crashed in the mountainous region as the plane prepared to land. Most of those aboard were Ukrainian and Russian scientists who were reportedly traveling to Iran to watch the maiden flight of joint Ukrainian/Iranian built passenger plane. There is no word yet on the cause of the crash.\" E.T. found this news report to be even more disturbing than the other two for it dealt with the actual deaths of forty-six people and it also reminded him of how careless and clumsy human beings could be in building and flying their aircraft. In the rest of the Universe there were rarely any such crash landings, with such exceptions as the Cealan crashing onto Earth's Roswell region of about forty years ago. He looked up at Mary and found himself wondering how she could manage to remain so stone faced at all these depressing reports the newscast kept giving. He pondered if it might have had to do with her having already experienced something to cause her much greater suffering. Then another newscast began. \" You won't find a lot of Christmas spirit in the town of Bethlehem this year which is being occupied by Israeli troops. There is no tree in Manger Square, no bells, no holly, and few tourists. Many in the region aren't happy about the condition.\" \" The people, they don't feel happy, you know, because the situation here is very bad,\" said a woman who was being interviewed. \" Today the Latin patriarch and a procession of people made the annual journey from Jerusalem to the Church of the Nativity and were greeted by Palestinian boy scouts carrying Palestinian flags,\" the reporter went on. Then the scene shifted to an old man wearing a long white robe with a big golden cross in the middle who was apparently addressing the congregation of people before him who were as stiff and as stone faced as Mary currently was. In the background there was the image of what looked like a miniature wooden house with a man and woman were long sagging robes in front of it kneeling over a tiny infant laying in a what looked like a wooden cradle filled with straw. \" I welcome all you naughty sinners on this blessed day of the birth of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ who as you all know, and to Hell with you if you don't, died for you, each and every one of you even though it was long before your time and you had essentially nothing to do with his murdering it is still all your faults as you have all inherited the unforgivably nasty selfishness of Adam and Eve of whom you all descended from six thousand years ago when they ate of the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden because they were childish enough to believe that having knowledge was good for them. You forced your Heavenly Father to condemn you and all of your children to the Lake of Eternal Fire but you were all saved turned himself into a baby and saved you all for he loves you all even though none of you deserve it at all!\" This was something which E.T. had never seen before and never heard before and he cringed as he listened to the old man's words which made his sensitive ears burn. How could he stand there telling those poor people lies that were so blatantly false he must surely know they were not true himself. For one thing the Earth was in reality 6.5 billion years old not six thousand and he knew this because his ancestors had watched the Earth form and grow from its beginning, and planets only a few thousand years old were too young support life on land. For another there are no such things as Saviors for Earth or any other planet for the matter for if Earth had one there would have been no need for his and other intergalactic colonies to make trips to Earth and try to research as much as they could of it and its inhabitants to save it from destruction. He began to think about the children of the Earth, especially Elliot, and their being exposed to these outlandish atrocities and how they shouldn't believe that they were guilty of committing a crime before they were even born and spend their lives trying to make up for it or paying for it for it would stifle their growth and damage their mental awareness. He knew he could never let this happen to the children whom he loved and had done so much for him and he began trying to think of a way to prevent this from happening, and the very idea of how to came to him. He trotted out of the room with Mary still taking no notice of his presence and went to look for Elliot. He hauled himself up the stairs to look for Elliot in his room. Once in there he found no trace of him and then it somehow occurred to him to look out the window and when he did he found him sitting in a comfortable looking position in the nook of the roof above the window below. E.T. carefully and quietly crawled out of the open window on his hands and short knees and crept up beside Elliot and sat with him as he was gazing into the starry sky. Elliot glanced over at him and put his hand on his shoulder. \"Can you see your home from up here?\" he asked. \"No,\" E.T. replied. \"It too far.\" \"There's the Christmas Star, you see it?\" Elliot pointed to a particularly bright star straight above them. E.T. looked up, extending his neck, and looked at the star Elliot pointed to. He thought he knew what star it was. \"Christmas Star? What do you mean?\" E.T. asked curiously. \"It's the star the three Wise Men followed that led them to Bethlehem,\" replied Elliot. \"Wise Men? Bethlehem? E.T. does not understand,\" he said. \"Well, it's like this,\" said Elliot. \"A man named Joseph and his wife Mary rode into Bethlehem and couldn't find any place to stay except in a stable and Mary had her baby in the manger and his name was Jesus and he was the son of God.\" \"Who told you this?\" E.T. wanted to know. \"I learned it at my Sunday School, five years ago,\" Elliot replied. \"I was told it was the reason why we have Christmas.\" \"And you believed it?\" asked E.T. intently. \"Well... why shouldn't I?\" asked Elliot, confused at E.T.'s questioning. \"Because it is wrong,\" E.T. stated calmly. \"It's wrong?\" said Elliot, more confused than surprised. \"Yes, it is wrong,\" replied E.T. \"Why?\" asked Elliot. \"Because there is no such thing as a god of Earth, or of any other planet, so he cannot have been the son of a god, if he even existed.\" \"You mean the whole thing was all made up?\" asked Elliot, now beginning to actually sound surprised. \"Yes, exactly,\" said E.T. matter-of-factually. \"The human beings of ancient, your ancestors, they led very ignorant lives, and many still do. They didn't know anything and didn't know how to learn anything for a long time and so they made those things up to satisfy themselves because it was the only thing they knew to do.\" \"Are you sure, E.T.?\" Elliot asked, feeling stunned. \"Trust me, Elliot,\" he said. \"If there were a god and he had a son my race would have long since known about it, but we have watched your species evolve over millions of years and it seems you have yet to understand, as we do, about how the Universe works.\" Elliot was so stunned it took him a moment to try to take it all in. \"Well, if what I'd heard at school isn't the reason for Christmas, then what is?\" he wondered aloud. \"Hmm...\" E.T. became thoughtful a moment. \"My race and I have observed the rotation of your planet around its star, or sun, and for three days towards the end of the year which you call December and some know as Winter the days and nights are equally as long. We have something similar on my planet and we call it a Solstice. So I believe what you and your race celebrate at this time of year is your Winter Solstice.\" \"Well,\" said Elliot, sounding slightly downhearted. \"If that's all there is to it then what reason is there to celebrate anyway?\" \"You have given me plenty of reasons to want to celebrate it,\" E.T. assured him. \"By inviting me here to be with you and your family again and showing me all of the wonderful little things of your planet, and just by being you.\" \"But, I mean,\" said Elliot. \"If there is no God then what is the purpose for life, and how did we get here in the first place?\" E.T. smiled. This was the question he had been waiting for. \"Well, I can't tell you all the details, so you'll just have to see for yourself. Look there!\" Elliot turned his head along with E.T.'s and looked towards an open space of black sky amidst the stars. \"Look harder,\" urged E.T. Elliot looked harder, his eyes focusing in on the empty black space. \"Harder!\" E.T. urged. Elliot looked harder with his eyes widening. \" Harder!\" E.T. urged. Elliot strained himself to concentrate on the dark expanse of space only... and then it happened. He saw a tiny white light grow and expand until it filled the whole sky and then it seemed to explode itself in a bang so big and loud it could not be heard and massive streaks of blue and white light covered everything and the light kept stretching out and enlarging into huge waves of energy and matter which kept colliding together over and over. Elliot felt like he was sitting up in the very front most seat of the biggest movie screen as he watched what looked like a giant pinball game of red and white streaks and dots of light and after a few minutes it settled down, decreased in size, and turned to dark blue. Then he seemed to be in the center of what looked like thick, foamy, transparent blue and green and red clouds of hydrogen. He watched as they began to condense over time and were being pulled together by their own gravity and turned from purple to violet to blue to turquoise to aqua to green to yellow to orange and then it became brighter and brighter until it seemed to explode in light and radiation, and when it calmed it left a huge glowing ball which looked like a star, and then it occurred to Elliot it was also a sun. The sun remained the same for a time and then it began growing darker and darker, turning orange and then red and then it seemed to swell larger and larger and then it burst like an overblown balloon, sending red and yellow dust particles everywhere like a cosmic dust storm. The dust kept scattering around and then it seemed to be drawing back as if being sucked in by a vacuum. Pulled in by gravity the dust swirled around and formed a disc with a bright red center. As the pressure built up the temperature rose and as more mass and energy was added to it it became solid and changed to orange to yellow. It was a brand-new star, and soon Elliot realized it was none other than the star at the center of his own solar system. Then he watched as leftover dust particles scattered away from the sun and began coming together and forming small rocks floating in space. These rocks began colliding with each other and formed into bigger rocks and as the rocks grew so did the collisions. Some rocks that hit head on broke apart while others stuck together and the more they grew the stronger was the gravity pulling them. Eventually, the gravity shaped them into small round planets, just a few miles across. They began growing from car sized, to house sized, to mountain sized, to the size of the moon, and a few of the bigger ones collided with others and then formed the three planets orbiting closest to the sun, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars. Elliot zoomed in like the lens of a movie camera on the third planet which was his Earthly home, except it looked very different from the one he knew. The Earth was nothing more than a fiery rock covered with lava. Volcanoes were erupting everywhere sending vast amounts of steam into the atmosphere which was causing heavy downfalls of acid rain. The newborn Earth was so full of energy as it was vigorously recycling and melting its materials over and over so constantly Elliot seemed to be watching a tape on fast forward. He watched as an asteroid, or a meteorite from outer space fell out of the red sky and crashed into the red liquid layers of rocks. Quickly, more meteorites began crashing down, generating waves of intense heat into the atmosphere. The combined effect was catastrophic and the planet became a raging furnace. As the temperatures reached thousands of degrees dense metal in the Earth's rocky surface such as iron and nickel melted and became a liquid rock ocean hundreds of kilometers thick. The melted iron sank into the Earth's center where it formed a molten core which gave the Earth a magnetic field that protected it from the harm of the solar wind. Still the Earth was a hostile and inhabitable planet with no oxygen and no water. Then suddenly another massive rock about the size of Mars crashed into the Earth. The impact was so great it melted both it's and the Earth's outer layers resulting in a new and bigger Earth. At the same time the collision threw vast amounts of molten rock into space which came together and formed the Earth's moon. The moon was at first about two-hundred thousand feet closer to the Earth than it is today and the Earth was spinning much faster making each day only six hours long, and with the moon so close its gravitational pull on the Earth was enormous and the land rose and fell about two-hundred feet during the moon's phases. Then as the moon began to slowly drift away the Earth's rotation slowed down and it's molten lava layers cooled to form it's crust. Then numerous mountain sized comets began falling into the Earth, the impact melting the ice in them and creating thick clouds which poured down hot rain which lasted for years, forming first rivers and lakes, and then eventually almost all of the Earth was covered in water. Although the planet was still unsuitable for life with poisonous gases filling its atmosphere. Then gradually small plants began to grow in the soil and as they sprouted higher and higher above the surface they gave out oxygen to renew the atmosphere. Elliot's attention was now on the surface of the ocean which had turned from green to blue and he saw dozens of tiny fish swimming in its waters. Then he watched as they grew fins and tails, and then teeth and limbs. He saw them crawling out of the water and onto the land now looking somewhere between a frog and a lizard. He watched them lay their eggs and watched as some of them hatched into much more lizard like creatures. The time seemed to be speeding up again as he watched the grow bigger and wider and form longer legs and sharper teeth. He watched these monstrous creatures hunt their prey and raise their young for a few moments before the scenery suddenly shifted again and became much dryer and barer and these enormous beasts seemed to be disappearing. Then he watched the smaller reptiles grow and change like the ones before them and start a whole new race called dinosaurs. Then for about three and a half minutes he watched a Jurassic park of Brontosauruses, Triceratops, Brakosauruses, Allosauruses, Stegosauruses, and Pterodactyls roaming in herds and battling the dreaded Tyrannosaurus Rex. He watched the dinosaurs migrate when their climates began to change and watched them hatch young which grew into new kinds of dinosaurs over the millenniums. Then before his eyes the dinosaurs began disappearing as the land began drastically changing. Then he watched as suddenly a meteorite hit the Earth and the sky was blazing and filled dust and debris. The dinosaurs' reign was officially over. Then he watched the land gradually redeem itself and he saw tiny mammals come out of their shelter. He watched how they grew as they adapted to their new environment and then suddenly the Earth was being dominated by mammals large and small who looked like the ancestors of elephants, giraffes, hippopotamus, rhinoceros, and wild cats, and he also saw giant birds with giant beaks walking around. Once again carnivores and herbivores were roaming around preying on each other and trying to breed young. There was one creature in particular that caught his attention. It was a family of monkeys jumping around on a tall tree nearby. He had never seen these kind of monkeys before and yet they seemed so familiar to him. After a moment one of the younger monkeys jumped down from a branch and began moving towards him. He was halfway to him when there was suddenly a bright flash and the scenery changed yet again and the monkey had changed as well for he was now walking erectly and had a different set of features making him look more related to a chimpanzee. Elliot stared at him for a long moment when it suddenly occurred to him that this peculiar kind of monkey looked like him in a much hairier state. Then suddenly the monkey heard its relatives calling for it and it scampered away from him. Then the scenery shifted again and he saw another family of monkeys in a somewhat different place and the monkeys now looked almost human or at least halfway. He watched as they played together and scavenged for food together and took care of their young and when he saw a mother nursing a baby he was so struck by how much it nearly resembled a human infant. He watched the scenery shifting again as they began migrating as the climate was changing as did their prehistoric relatives. With the new changing of time and place he saw another new family of whom he was now fully convinced were his own ancestors walking in a desert like place carrying large clubs and apparently hunting for beasts to kill for food and clothing. They looked just like humans except with apelike features and muscles. One of the leading cavemen let out a strange kind of yell and pointed to a large deer like creature ahead of them, and as they all rushed forward with their clubs and knives there came from ahead of them another tribe of human like creatures though they were hairier with seemingly much bigger bones and Elliot reckoned these must be the Neanderthals who he now saw were not his ancestors but rather the cousins of his ancestors. Then as it became apparent there was to be a fight over the feast the scenery began shifting all over again. He now saw before a family of homo sapiens that looked almost exactly like the human beings he was familiar with in his own time gathered around a campfire and roasting fresh meat and feeding each other, while at the same time attempting to nurse the wounds of one of their kin who was laying in the arms of an older female who was likely his mother. As the darkness turned to daylight it became apparent the wounded one wouldn't survive and the rest of them got up and left his lifeless body behind them. This seemed an abhorrent thing to do to Elliot but he reckoned these ancestors just hadn't yet developed their consciousness to mourn their deceased. As he saw the landscape changing, becoming hotter and dryer, he saw his ancestors changed with it. They became thinner with lesser hair and their skin turned a very dark shade of brown. He watched them learn to save food and water as they migrated from their inhospitable climate. He saw them make their way to the continent that would later be called Europe, and as he watched them adapt to their new environment he watched them change gradually over the centuries with their skin becoming lighter and lighter. He watched how they developed their language skills and invent writing and officiate names and then last names including the name Taylor. Then he watched how his ancestors came from England to the new American colonies around the time of the Mayflower Voyage. He watched them become Americans and then watched them attend the reception of the new Constitution and help get George Washington elected. Then he watched some of them participate in, and a few die in the Civil War and the first and second World War. He saw that overall and with rare exceptions all of his ancestors had been good and honest people and they had fought against slavery, racism, bigotry, the great depression, and homelessness. He had relatives who were policemen, firemen, archaeologists, astronomers, and watchmakers. He watched the history of his bloodline up until the moment he and his siblings were born, and when the film roll had run out the beam of light from the beginning repeated itself in reverse and then the sky became its normal self again. \"Wow!\" exclaimed Elliot when he had somewhat recovered from his thrill ride through time. \"That was quite an experience I won't ever forget! So that was how it all began?\" \"Yes,\" said E.T. confidently. \"What you have just seen is the knowledge my ancestors have saved up since the very beginning. You went through exactly four-billion years in fifteen minutes.\" \"Wow! Just like home movies!\" Elliot said breathlessly. \"But are you positive that the birth of the planet and the evolution of species I just saw was of my own?\" For just one moment E.T. looked offended, though the look quickly passed and he replied very calmly, \"Yes, indeed. My ancestors knew about your ancestors from their birth and also many other civilizations of other species and we have the technology to keep track of what we see and learn which your race has been lacking for such a long time.\" \"Well, it was certainly more awesome and inspiring than any made-up creation story I've ever heard,\" said Elliot matter of factually. \"And it also makes a lot more sense even though I'd never have been able to understand it if I hadn't seen it like I just did.\" \"Yes, I know,\" said E.T. solemnly. \"Your ancestor's brains developed so much slower than ours did that since they had no way of understanding how they came to be they did the only thing they knew how to do and that was imagine how they came to be. The imagination that your kind has is both a wonderful and a terrible thing for it has advanced you in every way for the past thousand years and has helped you to survive through hardships, yet it also causes many of you to become seriously deluded and to start wars and invent dogmas which you have no need for. Now you have just been given a special gift of insight into your species history of how they came to be and how the thrived, evolved, and advanced over seven-million years. So now what do you think the answer to your question is? What is the purpose of living?\" \"Well,\" said Elliot thoughtfully. \"I think the purpose of living, of being here, is to try to make the world a better place for all its creatures to live on, and to leave behind new knowledge or wisdom for the people of the future so that we will continue to grow and be in harmony with all the other lifeforms there are out there.\" \"Very good!\" said E.T. like a teacher praising his student. \"I was hoping that's what you would decide, because that is what I think it is also.\" \"I really do appreciate the gift you've given me and all, E.T.,\" said Elliot more somberly. \"But I think that now if I tell those I meet what I now know as truth and am honest about myself they won't believe it and will think I am a freak or something.\" \"I know,\" said E.T. gently. \"Because they are used to what they think they know already. But you won't find too much trouble with it in the future because within the next twenty years your kind will begin to understand people who know different things than most, and you will become a champion in the new century to come of understanding truth and evolution and other living organisms. It is my, as you will call it, Christmas gift to you, Elliot Taylor.\" \"E.T., thank you! You're the best friend anyone could have in the whole Universe!\" exclaimed Elliot as he threw his arms around E.T. and gave him the biggest hug this side of the Milky Way. \"I know you are, but what am I?\" asked E.T. Then as the temperature was dropping they went back inside through Elliot's bedroom window and found Gertie in her nightgown and bunny slippers as she came in from the adjoining room. \"So there you two are!\" she said in a rather scolding tone. \"Where have you been all this time?\" \"We've been out looking at the stars,\" replied Elliot. \"In fact, you ought to look at the stars more often, you could learn a lot from it.\" Gertie gave him the infamous little sister's 'oh brother!' rolling of eyes and then she heartily exclaimed, \"Come on let's hurry and get into bed! Santa doesn't come cheap to those who stay up late!\" Elliot chuckled as he joined her in racing for their beds and began quickly pulling of his shoes. E.T. began thinking about Mary and remembering how alone she seemed to be this evening and she kept her distance from the children throughout most of the day. He felt he wanted to do something for her to make her feel better, he also wanted to give her something for he knew that they would have presents by tomorrow, and why shouldn't she have something for Christmas herself. He thought a moment and then an idea for a gift came to him. He went over to Elliot's dresser and found the bag of Reese's Pieces on it. He took hold of it and reached in and found about twelve of the candies left in it. To him these were one of the most precious and glorious gifts of the Universe and he wanted to give them to her to let her know that he cared about her and did not want her to be sad. He strolled quietly and cautiously into Mary's bedroom and found her laying on her stomach on her bed with her bare back exposed as she was partially wrapped in a white sheet on the bed as she seemed to be sleeping peacefully. He crept up to her bedside and laid the handful of Reese's Pieces onto her pillow close to her face so that they would be the first thing she saw when she woke up the next day. Then he quietly crept out of the room and hopped downstairs into the living room to begin his next course of action. He went up to a set of framed pictures and picked out one of the kids absent father for he would need to see a picture so he could achieve the best results for what he was going to do, and the father looked a lot like Elliot which was all the more helpful. E.T. focused in on the image of the father in the picture until his mind was completely centered on it. He thought about how the kids and Mary all needed to see him again on Christmas day, and about how much he needed to see them also. E.T. also thought about how lonely he had been when he was left behind until Elliot took him in and had saved him from certain death by caring about him and telling him he loved him and even though he felt at home on his own planet he also felt a sense of being loved and belonging with Elliot and his family. His intention was to telepathically transfer these feelings to Elliot's dad wherever he was and all he knew was it was somewhere between here and Mexico. He continued this meditation up until he had exhausted himself from it. Then yawning he climbed back up the stairs hoping he had succeeded in what he wanted to accomplish. Thousands of miles away, Johnathan Taylor was laying huddled in bed with his girlfriend Sally after a festive and long Christmas party with all their friends and lots of beer and by the time it was over he felt that he was content with everything going on in the world. Then he began having a strangely vivid dream. He was remembering his past Christmases with Mary and their kids, about them being woken up early on Christmas morning to open the presents. Then he saw the situation his family was in in now and all because of him. He saw a bittersweet Christmas morning of Mary and the kids without him, he saw Elliot's face when Mary told him he couldn't make it over, and then he saw Gertie crying, and then Michael with a look of something like resentment on his face. Then he saw what future this could mean for them all and they had all nearly forgotten him and he was to never be a part of their lives again. He suddenly sat up wide awake and the remains of a hangover were still lingering but he didn't care for all his thoughts were on his family now. He got out of bed and dressed in a hurry and then without saying goodbye to Sally he left and had the intention of being with his kids on Christmas day if he had to steal a flight on the first plane out of here.[Chapter 8] E.T. Was awakened early the next morning when Elliot nearly knocked him over on the cot he was laying on as he jumped out of bed exclaiming, \"It's Christmas! It's Christmas! Wake up E.T.! It's Christmas morning!\" E.T. watched as Elliot bounded out of the room and thought he had never seen him so happy before, he just hoped it would last. E.T. crawled off of his cot and waddled into the living room where he found Elliot, Michael, Gertie, and Mary all gathered in the living room around the brightly lit and decorated Christmas tree which now had dozens of big and small packages under it all wrapped up in a shiny red and green paper with shiny red and green bows tied to the tops. \"Santa came!\" Gertie exclaimed running toward the first present she could reach. \"We must have been really nice this year,\" Michael chuckled as he sat down beside his siblings. E.T. watched as they all selected the presents that had their names on a tag attached to them and began pulling off the bows and ripping off the paper. Elliot opened his first present and found a brand new baseball bat and he was at once overcome with a wave of nostalgia as he remembered when when his dad would teach him how to play baseball and how he was the worst at first at batting but with his dad's persistence he was now a lot better. He opened another present and found a shiny red bicycle helmet with a purple zigzag across the top and once again he was flooded with bittersweet memories of when his dad had been teaching him how to ride a bike and how he had picked him up and hugged him when he fell down on his first ride without training wheels. With the next present he opened he found a skateboard and in the next one a pair of roller-blades and he was happy to at last find something new and completely different. Gertie opened her first present and found a new and genuine easy-bake oven complete with pans and trays and mitts. As a happy smile lit Gertie's face Elliot thought, Great! No more mud pies! Although he was a touch unnerved at the thought of sitting through more of her tea parties with her dolls and bears. When Gertie opened her next present she found a Raggedy Andy doll which was the brother for her Raggedy Ann doll. I am so happy to be here and to finally be able to know my long lost sister! E.T. heard the boy rag doll thinking excitedly and he was happy for it. When Michael opened his present he found it was just what he wanted, the Atari 8000 along with games like Space Invaders, Donkey Kong, and The Super Mario Bros. In the next presents he opened he found a skateboard and bicycle helmet similar to Elliot's except they were somewhat bigger and longer and had a Dungeons and Dragons symbol painted across their surfaces. The children then went to their Christmas stockings which were hung up by the fireplace. In Gertie's she found a dozen pieces of costume jewelry like beaded bracelets, shining necklaces, clip on earrings, and rainbow colored rings. In Elliot's he found a dozen pieces of rock candy which he divided generously between himself and E.T. and E.T. thought it so wonderfully peculiar that rocks could taste so good, after all the Reese's Pieces had been one thing but rocks were another thing altogether. In Micheal's stocking he found a whole new set of a dozen marbles which he quickly showed E.T. how to play with as he would aim the biggest marble called the shooter at one and try to get it to hit as many others as it could and whichever one got the most would win. E.T. was able to enhance the game by making the marbles glow as he levitated his shooter and had it magnetically attract all of the marbles. Mary looked on at her children as they all happily tried out their new things and she felt this Christmas was almost perfect, all that was missing was their father without whom none of this would have been possible. Her reflective thoughts were abruptly interrupted by a sudden knock upon the front door. She promptly went to answer it and found none other than Keys standing on the doorstep and holding four wrapped packages in his arms. \"Why Keys! What a pleasant surprise!\" Mary said smiling as she stepped aside to let him in. \"Aw, come on! You knew I was coming!\" Keys laughed as he set the presents down on the coffee table. Keys then knelt down as the kids all crowded joyously around him and embraced him one after the other and he hugged them all back. Then he looked up and saw E.T. He approached him slowly though he really wasn't far away at all. \"E.T...? That is what they call you, isn't it?\" he asked a bit hesitantly. E.T. nodded with a tranquil expression on his aged face. Keys knelt so that he was at eye level with E.T. \"Do you remember me?\" he asked. E.T. nodded. \"I was wondering actually if you remember me from about twenty-five years ago,\" he said and E.T. looked at him quizzically. \"It was the evening of August 2, 1957,\" Keys continued solemnly. \"I was little boy then about as tall as you an Elliot. You came to the site where I was camping with my family and we met, we came face to face, and you tried to speak to me but I couldn't understand your language and I got so frightened but I think I then frightened you even more because you were the first to run away. I felt kinda guilty after I watched you leave in your spaceship and I promised myself that somehow I would meet you again to tell you I'm sorry, and then I did meet you again only to scare you away again and so it must have been because of my being so intruding that you were left behind on this Earth and you nearly died from a breathing disease, but then Elliot saved you when I wasn't able to and I certainly see why you love him so much, I do too. Then you left once again in your spaceship and I never got a chance to talk to you yet again and now that I can I really don't know if you can understand my language when I tell you that I am completely sorry for frightening you the first time and the second time for what I put you through, me and my team, and now I am afraid you can't understand when I beg for your forgiveness.\" A calm, serene smile spread across E.T.'s face. \"E.T. understands and E.T. forgives,\" he said reassuringly \"I just didn't recognize when we met again because you are so much taller now but now I see you never meant me any harm at all. The only thing E.T. wants to know is why you allowed so many scary white hooded men to imprison him?\" Keys sighed with regret. \"Most of them were my colleagues and I agreed with them to track you down and find out if you really were an extra-terrestrial being. We humans can be just as curious as you. And then when we saw you were dying we just wanted to try to do everything we could to save you, and when it turned out we couldn't as it seemed I was more heartbroken than I had ever been in my life.\" E.T. gave a somewhat understanding smile and then looked at Keys more seriously. \"Only my people had the power to save me then, but they could do nothing with you and your own crew in the way of them and this was why things turned out as they did, though perhaps it was for the best they did anyway.\" \"Yes, I do understand it all now,\" admitted Keys sorrowfully. \"If there is anything we or I alone can do to make it up to you I would really like to know.\" E.T. smiled thoughtfully. \"I might like to tell you to stop looking for extra-terrestrial beings but then I somehow feel it wouldn't be right to, and so all I ask is that you find a more peaceful way of finding and observing them, like how me and my colleagues find and observe plant life and we study them but we never do anything they wouldn't want us to do because we learn everything we can about them beforehand so that we know what is right and what is wrong for them.\" \"Yes, of course we will,\" Keys promised. \"We are in the process of developing special telescopic equipment which can see onto other planets in other solar systems and also special sonar which can track signs of other life from other worlds. And if we should need any assistance in learning about what we happen to find with them can you help us?\" \"Of course,\" said E.T. \"I'm only a phone call away.\" Keys smiled and chuckled, and then to his surprise E.T. reached out his long arms and embraced him. As the Taylor family looked on with awe there came yet another knock at the door and when Mary opened it an elderly couple stepped inside carrying a load of three big packages each. \"Great Lord!\" exclaimed the old woman. \"I thought that cab driver would never get us here!\" \"Well, it's not like he could keep up in the traffic,\" replied the old man. \"You could have at least given him a tip.\" \"Grandma! Grandpa!\" the three kids exclaimed in unison as the rushed forward to embrace them and barely giving them time to put their packages down. \"Merry Christmas dears,\" said their grandma as she smothered them in hugs and kisses. \"Michael! You have grown into such a fine young man!\" said his grandpa as he looked him over. \"Elliot, you have grown a full inch since the last time I saw you!\" said his grandma bending down to look at him. \"And Gertie must have grown two or three at least!\" It was then they noticed E.T. for the first time. They suddenly became very quiet though they kept smiling and after a moment their grandma spoke. \"Well, who is your new friend over there?' \"Grandma, Grandpa,\" said Elliot proudly. \"May I introduce E.T., he is an extra-terrestrial and he is my my best friend in the whole universe.\" \"Greetings!\" E.T. said warmly to the old couple. \"Oh my Lord! A real extra-terrestrial!\" the grandma gasped in joy and surprise. \"I'd always hoped I'd see one someday!\" \"And I'm glad it was before we checked out of this Earth hotel!\" the grandpa added happily. \"You mean you really believe in aliens?\" asked Michael in surprise. \"Certainly,\" said the grandma. \"We always did, especially after the news of the Roswell Crashing of the 40s.\" \"We're wondering if you know anything about it?\" asked the grandpa to E.T. \"They were representatives of the planet Ceala,\" E.T. said. \"And they had come to Earth because they knew the Earth was at a time of war of prejudice and so many lives were being lost unnecessarily and as they were not as shy towards humans as me and my race are they decided to fly to one of the battlements and try to put a stop to the war by informing them of the true meaning of life and the universe and what you should be doing instead of killing each other all the time. But unfortunately there was a shortage of fuel in their spaceship, for unlike my race they fly their crafts with fuel, and so they had a crash landing a few miles from their intended destination.\" \"Oh my Lord!\" the grandma said again. \"Well, what is the true meaning of life and the universe?\" \"Ah! I cannot tell you those,\" E.T. said. \"But since you are both more than eighty years old you should find out soon enough.\" \"Do you know anything else that we don't know that you can tell us?\" asked the grandpa hopefully. \"What is the Loch Ness Monster? You see, I'm of Scottish origins and I always wanted to know.\" \"It is a descendant of one of the dinosaurs of the Triassic period called a Platheosaurus,\" E.T. replied. \"Oh my Lord!\" said the grandma again. \"I living dinosaur!\" \"What about Bigfoot?\" asked the Grandpa. \"What is he? I'd always wanted to know about him.\" \"He is a descendant of a giant ape called the Gigantaphithicus,\" replied E.T. \"And you need not fear him as he is more afraid of you than you are of him and that is why he prefers not to be seen, just like me and my crew were before I met Elliot.\" \"E.T. was lost when his crew left him behind two months ago and I took him in when he came to me,\" Elliot explained. \"I found out he likes Reese's Pieces, and he is so smart he actually built a transmitter out of junk we had around the house and called his crew with it and they came for him, and on our way to the spaceship he actually took me flying on my bicycle while he was riding in the basket!\" Elliot remembered the night he had flown with E.T. on his bike. Elliot had been pedaling until the ground beneath them had become too hard and too bumpy on his wheels. \"It's too bumpy. We'll have to walk from he-re...\" The words were barely out of his mouth when suddenly his bicycle began moving forward again seemingly on its own accord. \" E.T.! He exclaimed, not sure what he was doing now. They moved faster and faster picking up speed until they came to a cliff in the middle of the road. Elliot held his breath and closed his eyes as he felt them speeding off the cliff and taking a dive. However, instead of falling they rose up into the air again as if an invisible hand had pushed them up into the air. Then to his astonishment they began gliding upward higher and higher somewhat like when he was pushing himself upward on the swings at the playground. Looking around he saw the trees falling below them farther and farther away. Elliot continued pedaling his bicycle as fast as he could. \"Not so high! Not so high!\" he exclaimed as his heart tightened in his chest and he felt like it burst both from fear and from pleasure. E.T. obeyed and they soared just overhead of the tree tops. I'm flying! I'm flying! Elliot thought as he laughed as he screamed with happiness and exhilaration. They soared gracefully through the air and passed by the moon shining full in the dark night sky. \"You flew on a bicycle!\" his grandpa exclaimed. \"When I was your age if I wanted to fly on anything I'd tie myself to a kite!\" \"E.T. came back here to spend Christmas with us!\" Elliot continued. \"Me and him have this strange connection, too. I can feel anything he feels at any time even if we are in completely different places.\" \"That is because you have a great feeling of empathy for life,\" said his grandpa wisely. \"It runs in your family. I can always feel what your grandma feels at any time and place myself. Elliot looked lovingly at his grandparents and felt that with them and E.T. and Keys here this was the most perfect Christmas. Then he looked down and felt it was still missing his dad being here. \"Mom, where's Dad?\" he asked. Mary had been dreading this question ever since yesterday and she still had no idea how to answer though she would have to try now. \"Elliot... he,\" she began but never got to finish for just then there was another loud knock on the door. Grateful for the distraction she went to answer it and was curious as to who else could be here now. When she opened the door to her surprise and Elliot's great joy they found his dad standing there. \"I'm sorry I'm a bit late,\" he said. \"May I come in?\" \"Oh my! I -I mean of course!\" Mary said in shock and disbelief as she stumbled to the side and let him in the doorway. \"Dad!\" Elliot exclaimed as he ran up to him and embraced him hard and tightly. \"I thought you were in Mexico?\" \"I was,\" he said. \"But I've come back because I love you and I want nothing more than to be with you right now.\" After he and Elliot hugged for a few more moments he looked up and noticed E.T. for the first time and he knew at once he had to be an alien being of some kind, the strangest thing was he felt as if he had known he was here all along. He approached him and could somehow sense that the alien already knew about him. \"Friends and family are the only thing worth celebrating in this life,\"said E.T.. \"It is true,\" he said. They all enjoyed Christmas day together and it was just after dinner that E.T. announced it was time for him to leave. \"They'll be coming for me any minute,\" he said. \"We must get to the landing site before dark.\" Elliot nodded in understanding. \"Before you go I want to give you something.\" He went up to the stocking hung by the chimney which had E.T. written on it and took out a bag full of Reese's Pieces. \"Here, take these back with you,\" he said.\" \"Thank you, Elliot,\" said E.T. as he thought about his companions being able to finally taste this miracle candy themselves. \"I have something for you, too, E.T.,\" said Gertie. She went over to the tree and took a small green bag from under it. \"It isn't much, but it's the best I could do on such short notice,\" she said as she handed him the bag. E.T. reached into the bag and pulled out a small fuzzy light brown teddy bear with a pale pink ribbon tied around its neck. \"Hello. Will you be my friend?\" asked the teddy bear to E.T. \"I hope you like him,\" said Gertie. Tears filled E.T.'s big blue eyes as he smiled toothily at Gertie and exclaimed, \"I love him!\" He was so happy to now have one of the marvelous little beings known as stuffed toys to be able to take home with him and get to know it and show it to his companions. He threw his arms around Gertie and embraced her in a thankful hug. Gertie smiled glad that she actually had succeeded in giving E.T. the best present she could. \"What are you going to name him?\" she asked. E.T. thought for a moment. \"Zrek,\" he said at last. Then they all, the Taylor family along with the grandparents and Keys, piled into the car and drove E.T. to the bald spot in the forest where his spaceship was to pick him up. Very shortly after they arrived, about five minutes later, the spaceship descended from the heavens and parked itself onto the ground in the center of the landing site. Then everyone gave E.T. a big goodbye hug and when it was Elliot's turn he grasped E.T.'s hand and said, \"I love you so much, E.T., and I always will! You mean so much to me, you have made a real difference in my life. I have to know if I will see you again.\" E.T. smiled as he looked up at Elliot with his big, warm, kind, wisdom filled blue eyes and said, \"You will, Elliot. I promise you will, for you mean so much to me to and have also made a real difference in my life, and perhaps even the whole universe as we speak. Remember you are very special kind of human being, and never forget it.\" Elliot hugged E.T. again, and then E.T. with the bag of Reese's Pieces in one hand and the teddy bear in the other, walked up the gangplank of the spaceship. Once he was on board the doors closed and it rose into the air as it had the last time flying higher and higher until it was the first star in the sky, and then zoomed away leaving behind a rainbow trail of vapor in its path. ","Summary":" December 16, 1982 Elliot stood in front of his bedroom window, his elbows rested on the sill.

Elliotnwas in a trance, looking at the meaningless Algebra inside a trianglenscribbled on the blackboard, until his teacher brought him back downnto earth. \" Yes,nsir?\" He replied, with a start. \" Inhave asked you this question several times now.\" \" What'snthat, Sir?\" He asked. \" Whatnis A if B and Z are 50 degrees?\" \" Umm...\"nHe said blankly, \"Is it A for Algebra?\" Thenwhole class erupted into a state of screams and laughter. \" QUIET!\"nScreamed Allan Byrne. Thenclass fell silent within seconds, apart from the odd giggle and mock. \" Whatnhave I been talking about the past half hour, young Elliot?\" HissednByrne. \" Uh…nTriangles and numbers?\" \" Detention.\"nSaid Allan, Gritting his teeth. \" What?nYou've been talking about detention for three fourths of thisnperiod?\" Asked Elliot, sarcastically, not bothering if he got intonmore trouble because he already had detention lined up. Thenclass broke out into another spasm of laughter. \" Waynto go, Elliot!\" Shouted Ricky, A boy two months younger than Elliotnand had moved up next door to him just a few days ago. Elliotngrinned while Mr. Byrne wrote out a detention slip. \" Inwill see you this afternoon.\" Grumbled Allan. \" Yeah.\"nSaid Elliot, taking the slip out of Mr. Byrne's hand, \"Thanks.\" Thenclassroom was still in a huge laughing fit, but deep inside Elliotnfelt horrid. Itnhad been three years since E.T had left Elliot staring up at thenclear night sky in his Halloween costume, with his younger sister bynhis side. Each day from then on Elliot had longed to see his one truenfriend again. He felt he had a strong bond with E.T. Each day Elliotnkept on thinking about what E.T said to him before departing into thenGalaxy. \" I'llnbe right here.\" Thenwords never left him. Although he knew E.T was still in his heart,nElliot was beginning to become mad with not being able to physicallynsee his best friend again. Elliotnresumed his usual position in Maths class and stared blankly throughnthe board.[Chapter 2] Detention was terrible. Throughoutnthe entire Detention Period Elliot drew pictures of E.T, instead ofnthe Maths worksheet that Mr. Byrne had issued him with. He was toondepressed to bother about what Mr. Byrne would say, whatever he did,nElliot would have heard it many times before. * Elliot departed fromnthe yellow school bus at the bottom of his same old house where henfirst came into contact with E.T. He trudged up the long drive withnhis schoolbag slung over his right shoulder and took out his housenkeys from his jean pocket. Opening the door, he shouted out to see ifnanyone was in. \" Hey, I'm home!nAnyone in?\" He said \" I'm in, Elliot\"nsaid his older brother, coming around the corner and opening thenfridge. \" Hey.\" SaidnElliot, while throwing his bag along the kitchen worktop. \" How was school,ndude?\" \" Got Detention withnByrnie again.\" \" Damn, man. That'snlike the bizillionth time you've had detention.\" \" Yeah well it'snnot like you're a goody-two-shoes in school, is it?\" RepliednElliot, Sarcastically. Michael grinned andntossed Elliot a diet coke. \" Thanks.\" SmilednElliot weakly. \" What's up?\"nSaid Michael, as he sat down at the kitchen table. \" E.T.\" SaidnElliot, while opening the coke. \" Yeah. I wasnthinkin' about him too today,\" Said Michael thoughtfully, \"WhilenI was playing Space Raiders! Haha!\" \" Hey! Damn you!\"nScreamed Elliot, \"I thought you were past annoying me since you gotnoff school ill.\" \" Yeah ok.\" SaidnMichael, Sniggering. \" C'mon, man. Inknew you liked him too as a friend.\" \" Yeah. Ok. I admitnhe was kinda cool. His neck could stretch well far.\" Said Elliot'snolder brother, leaning back in his chair, sipping his coke. \" Heh.\" SaidnElliot before picking up his bag and running up the stairs. \" Hey, Elliot!\"nShouted Michael from downstairs. \" Yeah?\" Elliotnreplied, while tapping his goldfish tank. \" Yeah, I'm goin'nout for a few hours when Gerry comes for me. You think you can staynhere by yourself?\" \" Michael, I'm 14.nOf course I can stay here by myself.\" \" Alright, tell Mumnthat I'm away out when she comes back.\" \" Yeah, Yeah. Wherenis she?\" \" I Dunno.\" \"Ok.\" There was a rapidnknock at the door. \" Hey, I thinknthat's Gerry. I'll see ya later, El'.\" \" Damn! Stop callingnme that!\" \" Yeah, whatever,nsee ya.\" \" Yeah, bye.\" Elliot heard the doornopen, Michael have a brief conversation, some laughing, then the doornclose. Elliot crouched down beside his table once more and continuedntapping the goldfish bowl.[Chapter 3] It had been four hours since Elliotnhad last spoken to anybody at all. He sat in his bedroom on hisnbeanbag, reading a very interesting superman hardback book with fournhundred pages from lots of different superman comics that he boughtnthe day before. The warm night air drifted through his open window.nSuddenly he became aware of how long he had been sitting on thenbeanbag because his bum had went to sleep. \"Hmph.\" He walked over to the landing andnpeered over his balcony to the big grandfather clock. It read eightno'clock. \"What the…? Michael said he wasnjust going out for a couple of hours.\" Suddenly Elliot felt creeped. Whynhadn't his mother phoned him? She could of, to say she was going tonbe home later than expected, but she hadn't. Suddenly he beganngetting dark thoughts. What if she had been murdered? What if Michaelnhad been kidnapped? Endless terrible thoughts started to flood hisnmind. Elliot started to panic. He began to shake and became white. Henfelt sick. The first thought before retching is to run to thenbathroom. So he did. Leaning over the toilet, Elliotnretched for about several minutes before convincing himself he wasn'tngoing to puke. He rinsed his white face in the sink before staggeringnout onto the landing again and grabbing a towel to dry his face. \"I'll go and get some fresh air.\"nHe said, \"That'll help me.\" He walked down the stairs, holdingnonto the railing for support, and into the kitchen. He looked out thenfloor to ceiling windows and looked at the glass door before pushingnit open. Elliot sat slumped on the porchnstep, looking up at the night sky. \"I need you, E.T.\" He whispered,n\"Where are you?\" He sat there for half an hour, beforencatching a glimpse of a shooting star. Smiling weakly, Elliot spoke, \"Inwish— I wish that, I could see you again, E.T. I hope wishing onnthat shooting star will give me more chance of that.\" Elliot sucked in all the air he couldnmanage, before letting it out slowly. He felt better, and hungry.[Chapter 4] \"Elliot!\" Shouted his Mother,nrunning in on her black high heels towards him with her arms openednwide. Elliot gave no reply. He was too busy munching awayneffortlessly at his fourth 12 inch pepperoni pizza at the kitchenntable, with six more full pizza boxes stacked beside him. After hisnmother had finished smothering him in kisses and half strangling himnto death with her hugs, she asked a question, \"Where did you getnall these Pizzas from?\" Elliot finishedndevouring his last slice of pizza and moved on to the next box, whichncontained a pizza with its topping, being extra cheesy. \" I bought them withnthe money out of your purse.\" \" What?\" \" You left yournleather purse here.\" \" Oh. Well how muchnwas the bill?\" \" One hundred andnthirty four dollars, eight.\" \" WHAT?!\" Screamednhis Mother, \"How much are they each?\" \" Thirteen dollars,nforty eight.\" Replied Elliot, munching at his fourth slice. Elliot's Mum fellnback onto the cold tiled floor, but Elliot didn't notice and keptnploughing his way through the slices. After his Mother hadnrecovered she began to eat with Elliot. \" You know,\" Shensaid, \"You're gonna have to work to make up for this.\" \" Yeah.\" \" We're tight onncash. You can't just do this.\" Suddenly Elliot burstnout in a tantrum, \"WELL YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE ME HERE FOR SIXnHOURS BY MYSELF, CAN YOU?!\" \" Elliot! Sit down!nSIT DOWN!\" Screamed his Mum. Elliot obeyed and satndown. \" Where is Michael?\" \"How the heck should I know? He went out Six hours ago withnGerry and hasn't come back yet.\" \" What?\" \"Henwent out.\" \" For heavens sake!\"nShe screamed, \"I told him to stay here and look after you.\" \" Well he went out.\" \" I'll have tonphone Gerry's house. I hope Michael's there.\" She said, whilenstanding up and wiping crumbs off her suit. Elliot continued to eat.nHe was previously pale but colour was regaining in his cheeks. \" Hi, Joanne? Yes…nOh, I'm… Alright thank you… Is Michael there? Oh, alright,nthank you… Bye.\" Mary hung up the phone and bit her fingernail,nbefore dialling 911. She began to panic. \" Hello? Hello,noperator? Yes, Yes. Well… Oh yes, the service. P-police please.\" She waited for anmoment before she was directed through to the PD. Then Mary begannbabbling on without a moment's pause. \" Hello? Hello? Yes,nYes! Well, I went out to work and done my job like I'm supposed tondo everyday then I tried to come home after a hard day's work withnthe boss yelling at me then I got stuck in the traffic so I needed tonget fuel and so I phoned my eldest son and told him to look after mynyoungest son and once I had got fuel I got stuck ever more in thentraffic and I arrived home about half an hour ago with my son here bynhimself, without my eldest son and it's been six hours since myneldest son has got back and now, my youngest son is eating Pizza!\"nShe jabbered, before sobbing and leaning hard against the wall. A single, stressednword came from the other line, \"What?\"[Chapter 5] After Inspector Mackay had calmednMary down, he asked her politely to go through what Jargon she hadnjust babbled out. Mary tried to talk as slowly and efficiently as shencould, and after about several attempts Inspector Mackay got thenfull. \"Alright, so you're saying that your youngest son,nElliot, is that it? Yes, You're saying that he has been left alonenfor the past six hours, and you're eldest son hasn't returnednafter six hours also?\" \"Yes. That's correct.\" \"Alright, We'll send a unit overnto take details straight away, Miss.\" \"Just call me Mary, please.\" \"Alright, We'll send a unit over,nMary.\" \"Thank you.\" Mary said, with ansmile and a tear. \"That's what we're here for.\"nSaid Mackay, and asked if Mary wanted him to stay on the line. Maryndeclined the offer and sat down opposite Elliot after hanging up. \"Inspector Mackay says that he'llnsend a police unit over immediately.\" \"Cool.\" Elliot said, on hisneighth box. \"How can you eat like that?\"nAsked his Mum. \"I'm starved.\" Elliot said.n\"When I get nervous I get really hungry.\" \"Ok.\" \"Hey, where's Gertie?\" askednElliot, pausing for a brief moment with a meaty slice of Pizzanhalfway between his lips and the table. \"She's at Dana's.\" \"Oh, yeah. She has a kid too, huh?\" \"Yes.\" Just after Mary had finished her onenword sentence, there was a ring at the door. \"Michael?\" She asked as she ranntowards the door. As Mary opened the white door, shensaw her eldest son, Michael, half standing, half crouching on thenporch. He was also noticeably swaying from side to side with cuts andnbruised dotted all over his body. \"MICHAEL!\" Mary Screamed, ablenenough to wake up half the neighbourhood. \"Hey Ma!\" Said Michael,nMerrily. \"Where on earth have you been?! It's nearly elevenno'clock!\" Michael giggled before giving anslurred sentence. \"Well, ya see, Ma, Gerry and menwent out for a kick about down at the basketball court, ya know,nsoccer, and, well, we met these nice guys and they gave us a bottlenof Jack Daniel's. So we downed half the bottle and then they askednfor us back, I was a wee bittie drunk so I said nope and then they…nWell, they kinda hammered me.\" Mary noticed a large cut on the sidenof Michael's head. \"Look at the size of thatncut!\" \"Oh, yeah, I think my senses have went a bit numb too.\" \"GET INSIDE NOW!\" Michael giggled and stepped inside,ntripping over the rug as he did so. \"Whoops a daisy.\" He slurred. Mary stepped over to the kitchenntable again and took a bit off her Pizza, then, wagging it at Michaelnunintentionally, she said, \"You'll feel my wrath in the morning,nyoung man.\" Michael couldn't, help but giggle,n\"What'cha gonna do, Lady? Throw your Pizza at me?\"[Chapter 6] After Michael's mother had dealtnwith the police, telling them that his son was out late playing hisnfriend's PS2, and helping Michael with his wounds, she sent Elliotnand Michael off to bed and sat at the table with a mug of coffee. \" Gosh.\" Shensighed, \"What a day.\" And buried her head in her hands to think. Later on in thenafternoon, Michael woke from his slumber with a thumping hangover andnaching wounds. Elliot was on the couch watching TV and spewing fromnthe immense amount of pizza from the previous night, and his Mothernwas downstairs cooking lunch; which consisted of French toast andnbacon, since Michael hadn't even had breakfast. He trudgedndownstairs in his boxers, rubbing his temples and groaning. But thenlunch smelt delicious. \" Uh, Hi Mum.\" Henmoaned. \" Hey son!\" Shensaid, merrily. Michael was confused,nlast night his mother was on the verge of ripping his head off, nownshe was as bright and breezy as anyone could be. \" Don't worry, eatnthis up and rest today. You'll need your rest.\" Suddenly Michael hadna sense of a catch. \" Rest for what,nMum?\" \" I have just anlittle short of chores for you due to your behaviour.\" Suddenly Michael feltnlike a ton of bricks had plummeted down upon him. \" If I rememberncorrectly, two days ago you pronounced to me that you were ill. Wellnif you were fit enough to go outside with Gerry and get drunk, I'mnpretty sure you're in an able enough state to do just the twentynchores I have lined up for you.\" She grinned. \" Whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!\"nMoaned Michael. \" Yep, after todaynyou'll be up at dawn since tomorrow is Saturday and be doing choresntill dark.\" She smiled sinisterly. \" What aboutnElliot?\" He asked drearily, too hungover for an argument. \" He's vomitingnall over the place.\" She replied, shovelling the bacon off the pannand onto a plate alongside the toast and a hot cup of coffee, \"Nowneat up.\"[Chapter 7] Elliot was lying on the leather couchnwhile his older brother sulked in the kitchen, eating the beautifulnlunch, which he didn't give a damn about. Suddenly the Televisionnwent funny and came up with a static screen for about two minutesnbefore resuming onto a newsflash with a middle-aged woman reportingnsome sort of strange being. Then another screen of static came up. \"No! What was that on the news?\" He whispered The static got replaced with the newsnagain, a graphic of a small brown object waddling through some trees.nElliot's eyes nearly popped out of their sockets. It was E.T. The Television went crazy with staticnonce more then switched off.[Chapter 8] Elliot sprang up from the sofa,nspilling over a can of coke as he did so, then ran madly up thenstairs two at a time. He quickly got changed and snatched a bignpacket of Skittles off his desk and a hoodie. \"Bye Mum! Gotta go!\" He shoutednas he jumped off the last four steps of the staircase. \"What are you doing, Elliot?\"nShouted Mary, still holding her frying pan. But before she could hear any replynElliot was in the distance on his rusty bike. He zoomed through the traffic in thenmiddle of the lanes, not saying a word, only focused on where he wasngoing. Car horns blared as he went through a red light and nearlynsmashed into a lorry's rear end. \"Watch it, Kid!\" yelled a truckndriver. Elliot ignored the rebuke andncontinued cycling towards the woods. \"He's gotta be there.\"nWhispered Elliot, \"Just gotta.\" Once Elliot had arrived at the woodsnwhere he first tried to find E.T, He dumped his bike at the foot of angrand oak tree and started to walk forward, continuously trying tonget E.T to come out of hiding. \"E.T. Hey man. Where are? C'mon.nIt's me, Elliot.\" He repeated over and over. After walking for half an hour henheard a hissing sound. Elliot, curious, followed the sound and camento a small gazebo with hose type things running out of it. \"Whatnthe…?\" Elliot asked, and crouched down next to the flexiblenpipes. Elliot began to tread along thenshort, dead grass, following the piping. Eventually it led up to anwhite van filled with electronic devices. \"What the…?\" Suddenly a man in blue overalls camenaround the side of the van. \"Hey, Jim. You got any coffee?\"nAsked the man. \"Yeah, here's my flask.\"nReplied another man from inside the van. \"Thanks.\" Until the man had went away, Elliotnwas keeping as quite as a mouse. He remained prone against the backnof the van. He finally heard the man go away, so he popped his headnaround the corner just to make sure. Yeah; No one was there apartnfrom the man inside the van, Elliot could see him in the rear viewnmirror eating a bacon sandwich. \"Greedy.\" Elliot whispered. Henhad no doubt that all this was for E.T. He remembered what thenprevious scientists were like when they discovered E.T. This was thenperfect opportunity to get more experiments off him. \"Damn.\" Elliot cursed.[Chapter 9] Elliotnlooked around from the van again to check out his situation. Thenplace he wasn't far from a track because he could hear another vannrumbling in the distance, so if he got onto that then he'd be ablento make his way back. But he had his bike back where he left it.nForget the bike. E.T was better any day than that old thing. He wasngetting a new one anytime soon anyway. Cautiously,nhe crept around to the other rear end of the van and tried his bestnto see in the rear view mirror. As far as he could tell, the maleninside the van was reading a newspaper. This was a perfectnopportunity to make a dash over to a pile of crates just to the rightnof the van, but ahead of it. Elliot ceased the chance and went asnflat as he could against the van's cold surface. He then proceedednto slip along it, always keeping hard against the van's shiny side.nHe dared a quick glance through the window of the vehicle, but notntoo fast that he would catch the man's eye. He was still readingnthe paper, and now drinking out of the flask. The flask was even morenof a perfect invitation to run, the man had his eyes closed, and hisnhead was tipped back. Elliot promptly ducked back down and sprintednacross the short grass, before diving out of sight behind the crates.nHe briefly held his heart to see how fast it was beating, whilenresting to catch his breath, what little he had lost. The next stepnwas to… Wait… What was the next step? \"Fudge.\" Elliotnwhispered. Fudge? What a peculiar way in describing his emotion.nExtremely odd. Henlooked around. Only a pair of rubber gloves, a hose and a bolt. Notnvery useful. He had only though about going behind the crates becausenhe had seen it in another movie a couple of nights ago, the cop wasnin a massive firefight so he ran and rolled behind a big stack ofnboxes in a warehouse. It seemed like a good Idea at the time until ansniper shot his leg from another angle, where the cop was exposed. \" Ohnno.\" Elliot winced, realising that he had made a mistake. He peerednthrough the crates, seeing the van driver now looking out of thenwindow, as if he had seen something. Elliot wondered if the drivernhad seen him. No. He couldn't have. If he had the driver wouldnprobably be out here right now dragging Elliot to the psychopathsnthat ran this joint. He looked around the corner of another tent tonsee two middle-aged men having a conversation. They looked well builtndespite their age. Elliot didn't know what to do. Could he perhapsnuse the gloves, bolt and hose? How could he? They were close tonnothing. Elliot betted that the mad scientists had electronic batonsnto stun people with electric shocks at the least in there. Elliotnthought he could do something with the bolt. It would perhaps cause andistraction for a few seconds. Elliot considered it and it seemednlike a good enough thing. He picked up the bolt and looked aroundnhimself once again to see if there was anything he could throw atnthat would draw someone's attention. Therenwas a car. Itnwas an American Muscle. Yellow with black racing stripes. What wouldnsuch a stylish car be doing here? The mad scientists must have a lotnof money on their hands. It would attract a lot of attention. Innother words, It was perfect .nWeighing the bolt up in his hand, Elliot tossed it gently up in thenair a few times. Then he threw it. It flew effortlessly through thenair, basically microscopic to the other men, who were paying nonattention anyway. On impact, the bolt completely shattered the frontnwindscreen, which caused the alarm to go off. The two men that werendeep in conversation suddenly spun around and gazed at the car,nbefore exchanging worried looks. \" UhnOh.\" Said one of the men with a leather jacket on. \" Yeah.nUh Oh.\" Replied the other. Theynjogged over towards the vehicle and inspected the damage. \" Man.\"nSaid the leathered jacket man, while scratching the back of his necknuneasily. Elliotnsmiled to himself and ran around the side of the tent, remainingnprone, and continued into the tent door.[Chapter 10] What Elliot saw when he entered thenwhite tent was totally what he expected to see; plastic curtainsnhanging all around in different areas, tubes and wires hangingneverywhere above and below him, and, greatest of all, There, in thencentre of the room, Was E.T. Elliot rushed up to the clear medicalncurtains and ripped them down off their rails above, before nearlynpractically jumping on his long gone friend which he had found again.nE.T looked pale. \"It's okay.\" Elliot whispered, looking upnand down at his friend's frail looking body, \"It's okay.\" Henrepeated. Elliot put his index finger on E.T'sngreyish chest. It was cold to the touch. He slowly retracted hisnfinger back to his side and stared at E.T for a brief moment beforendevising a sketchy plan to get him and his friend out withoutnalerting anybody, or at least, getting out in one piece and back tonhis house safely. Safe. What did that word mean? You couldnnever be safe, within reason. Shaking his head to clear his mind,nElliot began to carefully push the metal framed medical bed that E.Tnwas on through the tent, bumping over many wires in the process.nCords and electrical items that were attached to E.T slowly fell offnor peeled away. Elliot just hoped that those things were fornmonitoring alien thoughts and not to keep E.T alive. No. E.Tnwasn't alien. He was Elliot's friend. Equal. Once Elliot had wheeled E.T over tonthe entrance of the canvas tent, he peered outside cautiously. Damn.nThe two men were now sitting on a pile of canvas tents that were notnput up; just one chucked on top of the other messily. They werenfacing in his direction. What could he do? He most certainlynnot make a dash for it, they would be on top of him before he knewnanything else. And if he did make it away, there was always thendriver of the van. Wait. Elliot left E.T where he was and rannover to the opposite end of the tent. There was another doorway. Where it went, Elliot didn't know.nBut it led somewhere and anywhere was better than here. He peered through it. It looked likena normal backdoor, just leading out into the forest. It could be angood thing. Elliot shot his eyes over to a tanglenof electrical cables near where E.T previously lay in the plasticncurtain area. Sparks. He ran over to his friend, E.T, andnbegan dragging the bed back towards the cables. E.T made a groaningnlike sound. \"It's okay.\" Elliot whispered, it seemed thatnwas all he could whisper. Finally, Elliot slipped his handnunder E.T's cold head and abdomen, then gently placed him on thencold floor. Then Elliot tipped the bed onto its side, then realisingnthat the bed had a tank below it, which looked explosive, Elliotngrinned a devilish grin. Once the bedsheets were spread over thenfloor equally everywhere, Elliot took a handful of wires and a basinnof water. \"Let's just hope this works.\" Elliot said throughngritted teeth.

Elliotnwas in a "},{"Movie":"Fall, 2006","Title":"beauty in the breakdown","Author":"xxxemoxbeccaxxx","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10615933","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: I do not own the fall or its characters but I do own becky and her story just to say there wont be any specific details until later as a child wouldn't pay attention to these things. Beauty in the breakdown it was in LA hospital where our damsel meets her heroes in the most unlikely of forms. Rebecca woke up in the hospital again to find out that she had been in a coma for 2 weeks, her muscles were sore and tired and her body was weak, she felt useless and just when she thought nothing would go right a little girl no older than 12 came wandering in, Rebecca followed her with her eyes the girl looked around at all the people and around the room. \"are you lost little one?\" Rebecca asked her voice quiet and soft as she forced herself to sit up more wincing at the immense pain in her ribs. the young girl looked at Rebecca in surprise before walking up to Rebecca's bed, \"I'm not lost I am just looking for my friend Roy.\" the girl responded clutching a wooden box in her chubby little fist, her arm in a cast and propped up, Rebecca smiled \"if you're looking for him doesn't that mean you are lost?\" the girl just looked confused and nodded her head then shook it when she realized. \"well if you're looking for the men's ward it's the next ward over sweetie...My name is Rebecca what is yours?\" Rebecca asked softly. the girl grinned and said \"my name is Alexandria and am going to see my friend Roy he promised to tell me an epic story.\" as she spoke Becky could help but smile \"well when your finished you'll have to come back and tell me, I love a good story\" she said before slowly turning and plucking out a piece of chocolate from her friends back home and handing it to Alexandria, \"here you go a little treat now you go and enjoy yourself and don't forget to come back and see me\" Becky said grinning at the look of wonder on Alexandria's face before Alex turned and scuttled of out the door. Becky sighed and lay her head down slowly drifting of to sleep wondering when her new little friend would come back to her. Alexandria walked in the men's ward and waited outside for Roy's friend to finish his visit, she walked in and plonked down on the bed next to Roy snapping the chocolate in half and handing him a piece, Roy accepted it with surprise and confusion on his face, he took a small bite before turning to her and asking \"Alexandria where did you get this? this is good quality chocolate\" he asked popping the rest into his mouth and smiling in appreciation. \"my new friend Becky, she gave it to me, she is on the ward next door. she is very pretty and she wants to hear you story too but she couldn't come with me.\" Alex said fiddling with her box, Roy frowned the ward next door was the women's ward and the fact she couldn't come and listen to his stories herself was bizarre. \"why couldn't she come with you Alexandria?\" Roy asked curiously while eating the last of the chocolate, Alex frowned and looked thoughtful for a moment \"well when she moved she looked liked she was in pain and when she smiled you could see it in her eyes, I didn't want her to her anymore she is a nice lady\" she said looking at her broken arm and frowning like it had bitten her. Roy looked at the girl and thought 'if she noticed it then it must be bad.' before being distracted by Alex's pirate question. Becky lay on her bed staring at Alex with eyes filled with wonder as the little girl retold the story that Roy had shared with her, Becky was captivated by the characters and couldn't help but think of some people that she knew especially odious, the very thought made her shudder and she dreaded the day he comes to visit. despite the wonderful drama of the story Becky couldn't help but feel there was a deeper, darker and more depressing understory and Becky could not help but yearn to seek out its creator and comfort him in his darkest hour. Becky paused looking at her lap \"Alexandria...do you think... I could...accompany you when you go to see him next?\" she asked looking at the girl with pleading eyes. Alex nodded enthusiastically \"oh yes of course, you can meet Roy!\" she grinned wiggling on the bed making it shake, Becky smiled and stoked Alex's good arm, \"would you like another piece of chocolate?\" Becky asked leaning over to get a piece for herself and her guest who was still bouncing with delight. \"oh yes please! thank you Rebecca!\" Becky smiled back and the cherub and said \"you can call me Becky my sweet, that's what my friends call me\" she smiled softly handing the chocolate to Alex, who looked down thoughtful , \"then you can call me Alex!\" she beamed and Becky smiled and nodded before becoming overwhelmed with a sense of tiredness and yawned, Becky glanced at the clock on the wall above the entrance \"oh dear me it's that time already! you better go back to your ward or you'll have no dinner, and we can't have that! you can come here in the morning then we can both go and visit Roy and hear the rest of his amazing story\" Becky said with a tired smile shooing the girl off to her own ward before calling to the nurse. \"Sister Annabella do you mind assisting me in the morning I'm going next door to visit a friend and I simply don't have the time to prepare myself alone, I may also need a hand getting to the ward if that's not too much trouble?\" she asked with a soft voice and a hopeful face. the nurse smiled back at her and nodded \"It's good to hear your getting out and about but I must insist that you take pain medication with you\" she said in an almost stern tone. Becky smiled in thanks as she once again drifted off dreaming of a certain Red bandit. the next day Becky got up early and sister Annabella helped her to clean up and fix her hair before helping her get situated comfortably in her wheelchair, this took them a good two hours and by the time they had gotten her in the wheelchair Alexandria came bounding in happily, Becky looked up and saw her little cherub ginning with such enthusiasm she couldn't help but smile back. \"oh look its our little cherub come down from heaven to guide us\" Sister Annabella said looking at Alex who grinned \"you go on ahead darling we will meet you there.\" Becky said and with that Alex shot off. Annabella turned to Becky and handed her a small half bottle of morphine \"You take two when your pain starts at most 3 ok?\" she said softly Becky nodded before Annabella got behind her and started pushing \" your as light as a feather...tell me your secret\" Annabella said giggling softly and Becky shook her head smiling holding a finger to her lips. just as they entered the ward Becky looked around for her cherub but couldn't see her, 'have we gone into the wrong room?' she looked around and said \"Alexandria are you in here?\" suddenly the curtain around the bed to her left flung open and Becky jumped in fright pain shooting through her as she jolted, the nurse put a hand softly on her shoulder and Becky breathed slowly her eyes shutting in pain. \"oh cherub you scared me!\" Becky gasped out in pain masked by a soft smile, an older man scoffed and turned back to the elderly gentleman who he was playing cards with. \"Becky! this is Roy\" she said giving a wild motion with her hand, Becky mock gasped as the nurse wheeled her over she placed a hand over her heart \"well now your telling me this handsome fellow is the genius behind the story you were telling me and here I was expecting some shrivelled up miserable old man\" she said grinning \"but it turns out that guy is just across from you\" Becky whispered with a wink. Roy stared at her in surprise before Annabella bough over a plastic cup full of water handing it to the wheelchair bound girl who sighed softly pulling out a glass jar of pills, morphine to be precise. Roy watched the young broken girl tip out two pills and watched as she swallowed them, taking in the sight of her. the petite girl had long hair that had been curled in the 20's style and her face was heart-shaped and pale, her brown eyes stared back at him and that's when he noticed the small ring of green around her pupil, he could see several cuts and bruised on her exposed skin old scars and the fact that she gasps when she moves suggests broken ribs, this lead Roy to believe she was a victim of spousal abuse. she adjusted herself so that she and the chair were as far in as they could and she thanked Annabella who turned and left with a soft smile, I do believe I came here for a magnificent story, but I worry that I may fall asleep these tablets make me awfully drowsy so please do forgive me.\" she said smiling but you could see the pain hidden in her eyes pained that screamed out for help, for mercy, pain so intense that Roy had to look away. there was a moment of awkward silence. \"why does that man keep his teeth in a glad of water at night\" Alexandria asked breaking the silence, Becky blinked and looked at her before bursting into giggle with were intertwined with pained mewls Roy put a hand on her shoulder as a comfort to which the giggle died down and the pain along with it, Becky smiled at Roy and sat back in her wheelchair listening to the ramble on about keeping strength in teeth when Alex's leg shot past Becky and accidentally kicked Roy's cupboard knocking over a cup of coffee which slightly splashed Becky in hot liquids, yet she did not make a sound so no one noticed. \"Im sorry\" alex said immediately as coffee spilled across the cupboard roy just stared at the coffee for a moment and looked back with a smile holing onto a cloth \"its alright no one was hurt right becky?\" Roy said softly while alex paniced slightly becky looked up at them and shook her head \"no I'm fine just watch your feet next time cherub, we'd hate to break anything before we heard the rest of the story\" becky said with a soft wiggle of alex's legs making her giggle. Roy put the cloth over the coffee and let the cloth soak it up continuing with his story immediately, Alex and Becky were hooked fascinated with all the twists and turned but alas Becky's medication was begging to take hold of her and she felt herself slowly slumping over the side of the bed despite the numbed pain she drifted into a deep sleep and the last she heard was the discovery of the slaves before sleep took hold of her. Read and review my lovelies...[Chapter 2] Im back again so soon you are so lucky haha just kidding onto the next chapter breath in Roy watched the young beauty sleep she couldn't have been older then 19, her pale complexion made her skin look like snow and it felt soft in his hand, he heart shaped lips were dark and glossy yet no makeup was present, he wondered to himself why such a beauty was in the hospital much less with a cast on her leg and bandages over her wrists and arm. By the time Becky woke up Alex was gone and Roy was asleep she had her head resting on his lap and at some point she had gripped on to his hand in her sleep, as she sat up she felt the familiar pain in her ribs and she gasped at the intensity that lying hunched over the bed had caused, Roy opened his eyes and lifted his head at the sound of her gasp and the grip on his hand tightening, he looked down at the broken girl with pity and concern. \"are you ok? do you want me to call for a nurse?\" he asked worry creeping into his voice with each word and tears built in her eyes and she fumbled in he nightgown pocket for the pills. she took 4 in hand and downed them, gasping for breath as the pain knocked it right back out of her. She gripped his hand harder and focused on her breathing after a few minutes she calmed and slumped back into her chair. she wearily looked up and Roy who was sat up leaning closer. she forced a smile \"I'm sorry...I fell asleep...I wanted to hear the rest of your story, you must think I'm so rude\" she said barely above a whisper, Roy just squeezed her hand \"it's ok I know what morphine does to you\" he said with a sad smile. Becky rested her head back her skin boiling beneath the surface still holding Roy's hand because she had no energy to let go. \"What did I miss?\" she asked softly as her eyes swept the area \"and where is cherub? has she gone out to play\" Roy glanced away \"I sent her out to play not long after you fell asleep, the 5 heroes where making their way towards the slave driven carriage and that's all, it didn't seem fair on you...\" he muttered not looking at her, she smiled and sighed her breath hitching in pain. \"so why are you in here?\" Becky asked softly gazing at Roy through tired eyes. Roy looked at her briefly before looking down I did something stupid... I tried to be a stuntman and the stunt went wrong, lost feeling in my legs and the women I loved, to the actor...\" he said sorrow seeping into his voice, Becky looked at Roy sadly \"I'm sorry, that must be really hard on you, if it's any consolation I can't walk too...I broke my leg snapped in two places...doctors tell me I'm lucky to be alive but that's not luck...if it was luck I would have died quickly\" she said tears creeping into her eyes, Roy looked at her in shock. \"how did it happen? if you don't mind me asking\" he all but whispered, Becky looked at him and sucked in a sharp breath the tears spilling over her lashes, \"I uh...I jumped of the roof of my house, apparently 2 stories wasn't high enough...\" she muttered bitterly, \"why would you do that?\" Roy asked still clutching her hand. Becky gazed up at him the tears still welled in her eyes, \"I wanted to die...there was no other choice.\" she shook her head lightly. there was a sad silence that hung in the air till it was broken by Becky sniffling and pulling her hand away from Roy's to pull out a handkerchief and dab her eyes dry \"I'm sorry I didn't mean to get so emotional I just...I'm glad that I could finally say it, to tell someone...\" she muttered her voice thick with emotion. Roy looked down at his lap in shame \"I want to die too, I'm just cowardly...and weak. Hell I couldn't even keep my own girlfriend I ended losing her to that rich actor.\" he said looking away from her he didn't want to see the pity in her eyes. Becky shaking but determined stood up out her chair her ribs screaming in protest making her gasp and groan in pain, the sound made Roy's head whip round he gasped at her figure towering over him while tears leaked from his eyes. Becky wobbled slightly but leant over the bed and embraced the broken man before her, \"It's not worth it, you have then I do Roy, don't give up when your just starting to live\" she whispered in his ear, tears dripping onto his shirt with a soft patter. Roy's eyes widen at the girls brazen act but he could not help but shiver at the sound of the girls honey tone voice so close to his ear. Roy turned his head slightly placing a gentle hand on Becky's back and whispered back \"you haven't even begun to live yet and I cant understand why such a sweet and innocent girl like you would want to die so badly.\" Becky shuddered and buried her head into his neck and a muffled reply came out as \"I'm not ready to tell you yet.\" she pulled back and turned her face toward his not realizing there was only mere inches between their faces, \"I don't want you to hate me when we only just met\" she whimpered slightly, Roy froze \"Why would-\" A sudden forced cough disrupted the pair. they turned to see the furious face of Walt who fumed about how this wasn't a ballroom dance or therapy and how there were \"actually sick\" people on the ward who were trying to sleep. Becky jumped up as fast as she could blushing in embarrassment \"I-I'm so sorry!\" she wobbled as she got to her feet \"I'll just be going now, goodnight Roy\" she mutter before turning and hobbling to the door her wheelchair forgotten. Roy tried to call after her but she just carried on limping away her head down. Roy turned to Walt and said \"do you realise that you just made a girl with broken ribs and a broken leg walk away without a wheelchair, the poor thing can barely stand!\" he was fuming with anger as Walt replied \"well she seemed fine to me, she must be exaggerating as women do.\" Roy refrained from grabbing Walt by the shirt again and punching him, he just glared at him as Walt walked away. Becky sat outside her ward her leg stretched out and her right arm clutching her ribs gasping for breath, Annabella came shooting outside and gasped at the sight of Becky. \"Becky! oh goodness you're white as a sheet, I told you to stay in your wheelchair and call for a nurse to assist you! why didn't you call for help?\" she said softly with worry and irritation in her tone. she ran back inside and came back with another wheelchair and helped Becky into it, before rushing her to her bedside and injecting her with a large amount of morphine before putting the young girl back into her bed where she fell into a painless sleep. The next day Becky woke up feeling sore but better, her ribs didn't sting as much when she breathed, she called for the nurse who got her food and medication. Becky asked to go back to the men's ward and the nurse was sceptical having heard of the previous day and after much of Becky's pleading she gave in on the agreement that she stays in her chair and calls for help when needed. Becky was thrilled, she hoped that her cherub was there and then they could hear the rest of the story with her. the nurse Ellie wheeled Becky next door and popped into the nurses station to warn them of Becky's agreement, Becky watched them for a moment before she was wheeled to Roy's bed. Roy was sleeping at this point and she told the nurse \"I will be fine from here thank you so much Ellie I really appreciate it\" Ellie placed a hand on Becky's shoulder and gave a soft smile, Becky placed her hand over Ellie's and gave a heartfelt smile. once Ellie had left Becky turned to the sleeping man and gently put her hand on his exposed arm, she stroked it softly, Roy's twitched in his sleep and inhaled sharply before his eyes slowly opened, his gaze turned to Becky who was smiling at him softly and couldn't help but smile back. \"you came back? are you ok? your not in too much pain are you?\" he asked quietly yet frantically, Becky just smiled and shook her head. \"I'm fine don't worry I got plenty of rest and I took my meds, and besides I had to come back or I'd miss out on your brilliant story but I suppose I worried for nothing as my cherub isn't here yet.\" she said smiling as she looked around, Roy smiled fondly at her and he glanced down at the lingering hand on his arm before placing his own hand over hers as she tried to pull away. \"I'm glad your ok but please be careful and pay no attention to Walt, I know I don't\" he said with a small laugh, before regrettably releasing her hand which she pulled back and returned to her lap. \"So have you always been this good with stories or is it a recent development?\" she asked with a grin, \"Well I've always had a passion for action stories and I just started making one up for Alexandria.\" he admitted smiling to himself, her smile was infectious and you couldn't help but return it. \"well I must admit I find it captivating but I cant help but feel like you telling a story within a story of things you want to do, like for example take down the man who stole your love away...\" she said softly watching as his smile faded and his eyes grew dark, he whispered \"well there are a lot of things I want but can never have, but don't stop a dreamer...\" his tone dark and sorrowful and Becky just stared at him in silence. \"there are some things we all want but can never have, there are some people who deserve it too\" she said reaching out for his arm again with a knowing look, just as Roy was about to talk again Alexandria came in walking slowly a thoughtful look on her face, Becky turned to her \"cherub!\" she said smiling at the little girl who rescued her from the darkness of her thoughts, Alex looked up and broke out into a wide smile \"Becky!\" she cried rushing over \"are you here for more of the story?\" she asked happily. Becky nodded and beckoned her to sit on her lap, Alex sat and wiggled getting comfortable and Becky wrapped her arms around her holding her in place. \"I saw something scary today, there was a lady with a boy and the boy was in the surgery he looked like he was sleeping but he had foam coming out of his mouth, the mother saw me, it was very scary\" she said dramatically and Becky frowned \"oh my cherub you should not be seeing things like that\" she said softly holding her closer to her, \"But the nice old man told me something to frighten away the bad things, he told me the magic words\" she said happily, Becky tilted her head at the young innocent girl \"Magic words?\" she asked confused. \"Yes, he said whenever I'm scared of something all I have to say is 'googly, googly, googly go away!' and I wont be scared anymore!\" she finished happily which made Becky laugh \"well he's right those are the magic words!\" she said to Alex with a motherly smile, Roy looked at Alex sternly \"did you get what I asked for?\" he said, alex nodded and opened her box handing a bottle of morphine pills to him, Becky frowned at the bottle, \"There are only 3 in here? Alexandria was this a full bottle?\" he asked in annoyance \"yes?\" Alex said confused \"where are the rest of them?\" Roy asked his temper flaring, \"I threw them down the toilet...will this help you sleep now?\" Alex asked hoping she'd done a good job. Roy frowned and said \"Maybe for a nap\" he sigh and Becky gave him a disapproving look that said \"we'll talk about this later\", Alex yawned tiredly and asked \"did they free the slaves?\" Roy sighed and continued his story as the three men rode their horses to the slave driven carriage. TBC I know its cutting off at a good point but its 3am here and I got work so please read, review and most of all ENJOY! any questions just review them and I will answer them in the next chapter =) xx[Chapter 3] this first part of the chapter is told from Becky's imagination where she adds her self into the story, and also there is an arrival in this chapter read and find out. give me love the horses galloped past the large hut and to the slaves pulling it, a small figure peaked out from behind and watched in awe as the mysterious men freed the slave and the cart pulled to a stop making her trip and fall to the floor a man in a large red fur coat mounted on his horse behind her watched her with curiosity, she huddled down by the steps of the large carriage and whimpered as the other joined the mystic and Darwin. The red bandit looked down at the strange figure, her clothes were tight fitting and as blue as the sky with a black sash tied round her waist, her face though was covered in a veil which only showed her lips, they were small and heart shaped in an alarming shade of red, the bandit frowned and turned to put on his mask, looking back at the small girl he bellowed \"Step aside women.\" the girl slowly stood and moved till the chain around her throat pulled taught, the men's eyes grew wide and the Indian stepped down off his horse and approach her his sword unsheathed. The girl saw the blade and whimpered trying to move away from him pulling on her chain in panic. The Indian lifted his blade above his head and she gasped as his brought it down only to sever the chain that bound her to the carriage, she collapsed to her knees bowing to the men, the Indian gently touched her back and pulled her up by her hand lifting her of the floor and walking her to the horses as the bandit lifted his gun and shot the lock off, the girl turned and gasped. A young boy came out slowly followed by a women in a luxurious Chinese outfit. \"just like a butterfly\" Darwin said almost breathless, the women turned her head and saw the girl \"why have you taken my nightingale?\" she asked pointing to the girl who cowered away from her \"she is with us now!\" the indian said boldly. \"As are you\" said the bandit as he scooped up the princess and put her on his horse, the idian helped the nightingale onto darwins horse who she clung to. The explosions artist shot the fuse of his bomb and they all raced off leaving the boy behind to their secret hide out, the palace in the middle of the lake. As they all went to their own favourite place in the amazing palace the nightingale wandered spotting Darwin painting his monkey and the indian blindfolding himself which made her frown behind her veil, she found where her mistress and the red bandit were talking and watched as the bandit revealed his face making the nightingale gasp, his face was handsome and strong, she felt her heart beat faster at the sheer beauty of the figure before her. she watched as her mistress unveiled herself and she frowned as he gasped out \"nurse Evelyn\" she looked away knowing she could not surmount to the immeasurable beauty of nurse Evelyn, she felt a small tear flow down her cheek, she felt her heart lurch as they grew close. the bandit turned to lady Evelyn and asked \"who is the nightingale?\" Evelyn turned to him \"she was a singer, the most beautiful singer in the eastern lands, I was taken to one of her performances by my fiancé who saw how captivated I was by her so he took her as a slave and tried to force her to sing, when she wouldn't he tortured her and she still would not sing, she would not even speak, I begged him not to harm her so he made my handmaiden...\" she said softly with a sad smile, \"I long to hear her again, if just her voice as she had the most beautiful soft tone they could warm the saddest of hearts.\" she whispered. the nightingale cried and walked away she hid herself in a quiet corner of the palace hidden from view and pulled back her veil where she wept in silence and solitude. Evelyn sighed and turned from the bandit \"may I be frank with you?\" she asked him \"of course\" he replied, \"although I've dedicated my life to god and goodness I've secretly loved throwing oranges at our priest.\" she said in a bored tone. \"take two turns to the left and go to the bathroom\" Roy says cutting of his story and pulling Becky out of her fantasy world, Alex wiggling on her lap frowned and said \"Nooo you read my note.\" Roy frown \"What are you talking about and go to the bathroom\" Alex frowned \"nooo...how do you know about the priest and the oranges\" she asked curiously and Becky giggled as Roy replied \"everybody knows you like to throw oranges at the priest, even the priest knows! but I didn't find that out from your gibberish message\" he said finally \"Its true Alex everybody know about how you throw oranges at the priest when you think no one is looking\" Becky said with a playful smile. \"Its not gibberish!\" Alex said annoyed, she wiggled more in Becky's lap until a nurse came up to them and said \"Excuse me its visiting time you all need to go back to your own wards.\" Becky gasped and Alex jumped of her lap before waving goodbye and dashing out the door, Becky stared wide eyed at her lap \"It's that time already\" she whispered a hint of fear in her tone, Roy looked down at Becky worriedly \"is everything ok do you want me to come with you?\" he asked quietly as a nurse walked up behind Becky and grabbed onto her chair \"right now miss your father is here to see you so better go back, and Mr Walker you have a visitor too.\" Becky gripped on to the arm rests with a tight grip and her breathing got heavy, the nurse wheeled her to her own ward and Annabella was there to help her onto her bed, once comfortable she walked away and came back with a tall dark haired man, he had a suit on but you could see the thick muscles under and Becky began to shake. the man was pointed to Becky's bed and he walked over sitting in the chair next to her bed, there was a dark silence as he sad there an angry frown on his face. \"h-hello father\" Becky whispered playing with her hands on her lap, the man continued to stare at her \"Did you think you were clever doing what you did child. Do you think it would be that easy.\" he whispered harshly before grabbing Becky's wrist and squeezing \"you cost me a lot of money and for what so you could go and try to kill yourself and waste even MORE of my money?!\" he spat as tears spilled down Becky's face, \"I'm sorry\" Becky whispered trying desperately not to scream at the deadly grip her father had on her arm. \"Your mother has taken your place, I hope your satisfied with yourself, she has too work twice as hard now thanks to you.\" he spat harshly before throwing down Becky's arm and storming off the ward. Becky curled up on herself and cried, the nurses rushed over and checked her over, they found that her right wrist was broken, they put it in plaster and put her arm in a sling while the whole time Becky just stared off into space. By the afternoon visiting time was closing to an end and Annabella and Ellie wheeled the unusually quiet Becky back to the men's ward as the went through the courtyard Becky asked the nurses to stop, she turned to the men on the bench \"your the actor aren't you?\" she asked quietly which caused him to turn to her with a smug grin, which faded as he saw her face. \"Your that singer, the one that tried to kill herself? My girlfriend was a big fan of yours before your accident\" he said the smug look returning. He leaned forward and whispered \"if you weren't stuck in here you could have been my girlfriend\" he said with a sick grin as he looked her up and down, Becky frowned and as fast as lightning she lashed out slapping him with her good hand \"I would NEVER date such a pathetic lowlife like yourself, unlike your girlfriend I realise the good in people not how fat their wallets are!\" she yelled as the nurses rushed her off into the men's ward. the stopped in the door way before they both looked on her \"Why did you do that Becky, don't you know who he is?!\" they said shocked by her actions she just frowned and shook her head looking over to Roy who had a man with a briefcase, \"You need to get off this suicide thing\" he said as he stood up and grabbed his suitcase, The nurses wheeled Becky over to roys bed before rushing off to catch a glimpse off the famous actor in the courtyard. Becky stared at her lap under Roy's gaze she heard him gasp slightly and she knew why \"Oh my goodness, Becky what happened to your arm?!\" he asked loudly, Becky just shook her head and stayed silent as Alex cam barrelling into the room wearing a newspaper mask. Becky zoned out of their conversation and stared at her wrist in thought she was scared of what her father would do to her when she got out of here, she heard a jingle and looked up to Roy swallow some pills, \"Roy?\" she asked softly he looked at her and gave a sad smile. she looked sad and tears filled her eyes as he swallowed the last of the pills, she couldn't stop him but she couldn't leave him, not now. Nightingale sat next to the Indian on a ledge looking down at the long way down contemplating jumping, with a single glance back her heart lurched for the millionth time as she watched Evelyn caress the bandits head as they lay on the bed. she watched them for a moment before turning back to the view as she had stood up to jump off the explosions expert Luigi said \"they should not come with us gesturing to nightingale and Evelyn, the bandit stood up abruptly and asked \"Why?\". Alberto stuttered \"It is too dangerous! if we are captured Governor Odious will surly kill them!\" Evelyn stood and nightingale whipped around to face them \"you mentioned Odious?\" Evelyn said worriedly, the bandit turned his head to her \"He is my sworn enemy\" he said, \"...and my fiancé...\" she said quietly, nightingale whipped off her veil, revealing the scowl on her face and the scar across her eye. \"That man...took me from my home, my family and tortured me!\" Nightingale yelled in anger hatred seeping into her voice, Evelyn looked at her in shock and fainted. \"I want nothing more then for that man...no...that monster to die the most painful death\" nightingale said stepping away from the ledge, tears of anger and pain seeping from her light brown eyes \"I want him DEAD!\" she said finally before collapsing into tears, Wallace the monkey jumped onto her lap and chittered softly as she cried and the men looked on in shock and pity. \"You know what we must do...\" the slave man otta benga nodded towards Evelyn, the bandit looked down and nodded and walked away they all left except the Indian, he held a hand onto the shoulder of the crying women, \"I know how you feel, as does my beloved, her name was Lakshmi for she was the most beautiful girl some say she was the human embodiment of beauty and I fell in love with her at first sight...Odious kidnapped her and when she refused to unveil herself to another he threw her into the labyrinth of despair, it was there that she jumped to her death.\" Nightingale placed a hand over his and squeezed \"thank you for telling this...but I'm afraid what happened to me was much worse, you have not seen my face nor my body. I refused to sing for him so he cut me up so that no one would be tempted by my beautiful. he said that if he ever found out I disobeyed him I would be punished. I'm scared of he'll do to me\" she finished with a whisper before waking away. Nightingale changed her clothes she wore a backless dress shirt and a long black gypsy skirt that faded to blue at the tips. she wore her dark brown curls in a messy up do, and walked down to the riverside where lady Evelyn was tied to a post, as luigi was about to blindfold her she said \"no I want to look at you till I die\" the bandit sighed and muttered to himself, Evelyn turned to nightingale and asked sadly \"will you sing for me one last time as I die...\" nightingale sighed and nodded. As she started to sing all the men looked at her, she sung a haunting aria that echoed through the air and filled it with an overwhelming sadness, the men turned away as the bandit raised his gun, but nightingale refused too, she would watch the women who saved her life till the very end. her song was cut off by the sound of gunshot and her breath caught in her throat as Evelyn threw her head back then started gasping for air. \"She's still alive!\" luigi said in shock rushing over, nightingale fell to her knees her breath shaky and weak, tears of happiness welled in her eyes. nightingale sung once more but this song was one of joy and happiness, as the two lovers vowed to marry, this pained her but she never let it show for she knew that she was unworthy of the handsome bandits affection. they rushed to a church to wed, where they stood witness to the act but as the bandit held out the ring the mystic stepped forward and took it from his palm and looked back at him before talking in his own language which Darwin translated. \"the mystic spies danger in your palm, you've taken too many pills, death is near.\" the bandit turns to the mystic \"danger?\" he mutters \"suicide is not the answer\" Darwin continues as the heroes look around \" he says he also knows of a secret chant, whenever we are in danger...something about googly googly? he says if you fall asleep you will never wake up\" they look around to find themselves surrounded by the governors enforcers, one strikes the back of the red bandits head as he looks at the grinning priest, the last thing he hears it nightingales scream as he blacks out. when the heroes come too they find themselves in the middle of the desert and right there in front of them is nightingale her back exposed and leaning over a rock being whipped, her back sliced up and bloody her screams echoing through the harsh desert. two enforcers taunt the heroes with water and ice not noticing the young bandit creeping stealthily behind them freeing the bandit and handing him a gun, he shoots the man whipping nightingale and aims at the remaining two. The enforcers leave in a hurry and the men groan tiredly, and the sound of nightingales whimpers fade as she fades into unconsciousness. Becky fell asleep with her head on the bed again, unknowing that Roy soon followed her and Alex left closing the curtains behind her. I know I cut it fine this time but this is a difficult scene to change and I don't want to plagiarise the film quote for quote you all know what happens next anyway =) please read and review criticism is accepted but no flames please.[Chapter 4] I know its been a long time and im sorry i lost my muse and i have had a hard time getting it back.

Bring me to life Becky awoke to the sound of a doctor talking and several porters removing a body under a white sheet, she gasped and looked up and to her surprise she saw Roy, still on the bed her heart sunk in her chest and she stood shakily over him. She pressed her ear to his chest and tears sprung to her eyes as she heard his heart still beating, she slumped back into her chair and let her head fall back. A few moments passed as people came in to clean the bed and a teary eyed Alex came in whimpering and sniffling crying Roy's name over and over, she looked up and gasped \"Roy!\" she said loudly and he started to stir. Alex stood by his bed muttering in broken English and sniffling, Becky grew worried as Roy started to sit up groggily, she gently pushed Alex back a little and place a hand onto Roy's. He ignored her and glanced down at his lap, pulling his hand from under Becky's he wiping his lip and tasted it. \"... Sugar...they're giving him sugar\" he mutter over Alex before ripping back the curtain. Becky grew more worried at the anger on his face and pulled Alex onto her lap, pushing them back slowly with her un-injured foot. The doctor oblivious to Roy's rage walked over smiling holding up an X-ray and trying to talk to Roy, he stopped short when to X-ray was ripped out of his hands and thrown away. Alex started to squirm in Becky's lap as the men started shouting and Roy grabbed the bed and started violently shaking it - with him still on it - screaming and yelling and propelling his gift basket across the room \"Alex go now! go back to your room\" Becky whispered to Alex urgently nudging her off her lap and turned watching as orderlies began to pin Roy to the bed and doctors started yelling at nurses to fetch a sedative. Becky couldn't do anything but watch tears welling in her eyes. After to doctor sedated Roy a nurse came and took Becky back to her room. Becky sat on her bed watching out the window as they began to light the kerosene in the groves, she sighed and looked down. she was worried, about Alex and Roy, and what her Father would do if he knew where she went everyday. Her mind swam with thoughts but she couldn't shake a bad feeling she got deep down in her heart. 2 hours later she stood up and slowly made her way to the chapel grabbing a spare crutch on the way. she finally made it to the chapel after 20 minutes of what should have been a 2 minute walk, she sat in a pew and began to silently pray. The silence was broken by a nearby scream, smash and thud. Becky's heart leapt into her throat, she knew that voice, she jumped up crutch forgotten along with the pain and all but ran to where the noise came from. the dispensary. she wobbled over to the window and screamed in horror at the sight of poor Alex laying on the ground blood pooling around her head. Becky rushed to the door and smashed the glass unlocking it from the inside all the while screaming for help. She rushed to Alex and threw herself to the floor she stripped off her gown and gently pressed it to Alex's head hand now covered in blood and the gown slowly becoming saturated with the blood of the poor child. Alex began to sob and scream. \"Some body please help me!, Alex! Alex can you hear me! Talk to me baby girl please!\" she begged as all manner of people came in to help. orderlies lifted Alex and carried her to the surgery next door. Alex sat on the ground sobbing and rocking \"please save her. please. she cant die. just help her please!\" she beg hysterically as doctors rushed around. A few orderlies picked Becky up under her arms and began to carry her out when she cried \"no please I cant leave her don't make me leave! if she dies I need to be there for her!\" the orderlies glanced at each other then at a nurse who said \"take her to the chairs by the operating room, she will only be worse if you don't.\" before rushing off elsewhere. Becky sat there for hours hands shaking and curled next to her face as she silently cried, her eyes were red and bloodshot. By 5 am the following morning Becky had fallen asleep her chin resting on her chest. A doctor came over to her and placed a gentle hand on her shoulder and she jerked awake head shooting up to the doctor, he smiled tiredly at her \"she's going to make it. you manage to stop her loosing too much blood. you saved her life. she's under sedation for a while so we can monitor her but she will be ok\" he smiled again and gently squeezed her shoulder as her face fell in exhaustion and more tears fell from her eyes \"thank you.\" she whispered to him before shakily standing and staring at Alex's Still body on the table. After a while she walked away from the window her feet stumbling in an unknown direction, by the time she'd stopped she was by Roy's bed, she touched a hand to his shoulder and he did not even flinch. she turned almost numb and quietly pulled a chair to the bed. she lay her head by his side and clutched his hand before drifting off to sleep. Becky awoke to Roy stirring, she lifted her head and waited as he opened his eyes, he sat up and glanced at her and he froze, he looked over her and saw the blood now dried on her hands, face and gown, her eyes were now a deep red and she looked exhausted. \"Becky, whats happened? are you alright\" he asked concerned gripping her hand tight. Becky's eyes filled with tears once more and she lowered her head so he couldn't see her face. \"It's Alex...there was an accident... she fell and hit her head... I found her-\" her voice cracked and turned into a sob. Roy grabbed her shoulder \"What?! is she alright?!\" he asked urgently, she nodded \"they finished surgery on her this morning... she was in all night... she could have died... why was she even there?\" she asked more to herself. Roy was confused \" where was she?\" he asked \"the dispensary.\" she replied wiping away the tears. Roy's face fell into one of shock and he slumped back into bed. \"it's all my fault...\" he whispered to himself, Becky looked up and him and shook her head \"no it wasn't Roy\" she said gripping his hand, he shook his head and tears welled in his eyes as he hung his head in shame. \"I asked her to get me morphine pills so I could kill myself. I was selfish and its my fault she went back there. if I hadn't of asked her to get me the damned pills she wouldn't have nearly died! he said growing more hysteric and tears fell in steady drops down his cheeks. Becky sat in shock for a moment, she stood and Roy let go of her hand and turned away not wanting to watch her leave. Becky climbed onto the bed and pulled Roy into a hug, he gripped her tight and sobbed and she just held him. she didn't know what else to do. ok so im going to leave it here for now as im in need of a drink and im not talking tea. depressing stuff. I will continue on soon! R&R; please xx[Chapter 5] Ok so i gotta finish this chapter really quick 2 in 1 day to make up for lost time. if its not posted the same day its cause i ran out of time and my fiancee came back from work. this is becoming a lil OOC but it my own idea of what would happen between them. My Immortal For the past week Becky has stayed by Alex's side non stop ignoring all doctors telling her to move, eventually they accepted that the broken women would not leave until Alex woke up, she watched over her like a mother fox to her cub. She knew that Roy admitted what he did and that he tricked her with the story to get her to help him and he took full responsibility...it broke him. he started drinking, Becky couldn't be around him when he was drunk, she was scared of what he would be like drunk, would he be like her father? abusive? or just angry? The doctors were furious and berated him for being so hung up on a women, Becky wanted to smack them when they said things like that. She never blamed him, she was just sad that this poor innocent child was brought into this and ended up paying for it in full. Becky sat in her wheelchair staring at Alex she could see light flutterings beneath closed eyes and smiled in hopes that her cherub would be waking up, she didn't but it would not be long or so the nurses said. Roy came and sat by Alex too, he watched her for a moment before looking at his lap as tears rolled down his cheeks. Becky lent over and held his hand \"Its okay, shes okay now, she will heal. so should you\" she said softly before raising her hand to his cheek and wiping away the stray tears. A soft groan caught thier attention and they both turn to Alex, she turn her head slowly and looked up at them both smiling that same guilty smile \"I fell again\" she muttered still groggy, Becky moved her hand to Alex's \"we know sweet girl. i was the one who found you.\" she said with a haunted smile. Alex frowned and looked at Roy \"you're famous...\" he said trailing off she frowned more \"are they angry?\" she asked in a sad voice, Roy sniffled \"yeah...but not at you.\" Alex started trying to explain how she fell but Becky couldn't bear it, she just kept seeing Alex lying on the floor head bloody and feeling the fear, she couldn't stop the tears falling and she bowed her head. Roy too couldnt handle the pain he felt and changed the subject. Things started to turn sour when Alex asked to continue the story, Roy on the verge of breaking told her it was all a trick to get her to get the pills, Becky glanced at Roy as he took a swig of his whiskey and inwardly cringed and looked away. \"you should ask someone else\" he said in a broken voice \"there's no - there's no happy ending with me.\" Becky's heart broke and she placed a hand on Roy's knee. \"I still want to know.\" Alex begged \"you should get nurse Evelyn to tell you it\" Roy replied \"No! i don't want her in it.\" she shouted back. \"no?\" Roy replied confused, \" well she's not in love with odious, she's just pretending\" he continued in hopes of changing her mind. \"I saw her with one of the hospital doctors, she was just pretending to love you\" Alex said quietly, Becky looked at her in shock and felt disgust that they were doing anything intimate near children, \"Just like you're girlfriend\" Alex said with a sad look on her face, Roy was shocked \"I see\" he said before continuing his story and Becky couldn't help but continue her own version. Nightingale stood near the ledge of the building hold herself up on a pillar as Darwin looked through his spy-glass. \"Governor Odious with nurse Evelyn?\" he said in surprise, Nightingale glanced at him before bowing her head, she knew that she would betray us. She knew that Evelyn was more enthralled by Odious's power than anything she couldn't have known that Evelyn would lead the trap spawned for them or that she would tell Odious that she spoke let alone sung. Nightingale tensed her shoulder and her back stung it was nearly healed but still hurt to move, and the pain just fuelled her need for revenge. Darwin turned back to the group shouted \"She right\" the bandit took a swig from his canteen \"we don't need her...you give them you're heart when all they want is your wallet\" he muttered bitterly. Nightingale looked back at the bandit and growled \"Not all women are that cruel and greedy, I had everything I could ever want and I earnt it myself, no man involved.\" she left out the fact that she had always wanted love but never found the man who she could give her heart to. As the group decided to move she stay near the back Darwin followed behind her, Darwin got through one of the many doorways and put his bag down to catch his breath, Nightingale stopped and turned to him \"Darwin we cant stop now!\" she said pacing back towards him as she got a few feet away, Wallace the monkey sprung from the bag and ran away up to a high ridge and started trying to catch a butterfly, Darwin begged for him to come down and suddenly a shot rang out and Wallace vanished from sight. Nightingale gasped in horror and ran after Darwin to find Wallace. Lying on a platform was Wallace, a hole in his chest and a butterfly in his hand. As Darwin cried in anguish at he loss of his closest friend swarms of guards poured onto the steps and the group had the leave nightingale grabbed the baby bandit and ran as fast as she could. Shots rang out and a loud splash followed and tears blurred nightingales vision. They ran for cover and another shot rang out, Luigi was hit. His courage let us escape at the cost of his life which went how he would of liked to die...with a bang, tears now freely flowing blinded nightingale she followed the blue and green in front of her. they stopped to hide and nightingale wiped away her tears she glanced around and notice there was no mystic \"...no\" she whispered looking for him but when she found him more tears sprang into her eyes, ambushed and powerless to stop them the poor mystic was left to die. baby bandit tried to go to him and nightingale screamed \"No!\" reaching out to grab her only to be grabbed by the red bandit, oto benga ran and grabbed the child and spun them just in time for the flurry of arrows to leave her unharmed. oto carried her and red bandit carried nightingale down to bank to a patch of grass where oto was hit by another round of arrows and he was took weak to protect the child, the Indian planted his sword and ran to them grabbing the girl and getting her to safety and oto fell back impaling himself on the arrows. nightingale screamed in horror and was pushed by the Indian. he stopped them both and untied his turban forming a rope and grappled them an escape, nightingale went first pulling herself up steadily feet planted on the wall for support. she then pulled baby bandit off red bandit so they could get up safely, she stood at the top looking down holding her hand down for the Indian when he Jerked and he looked up at her then to the bandits in the window before cutting the rope \"NO!\" nightingale screamed as he fell. She ran after the bandits who carried on ahead, when she arrived she found the red bandit pointing his guns at Odious, \"Roy!\" Nurse Evelyn shouted distracting them long enough for odious to escape. Becky had her face in her hands tears silently falling and she felt powerless, Alex began to mutter about Rory's girlfriend staying in the car when the actor came to visit. He told her to shut up and continued. The red bandit ran after odious coming into a beautiful serene pool area closely followed by Nightingale and baby bandit suddenly a pair of hands grabbed Nightingale and gagged her holding her so tight she could barely breath, her back screamed in agony and she had to watch through tears as Odious snuck up on the bandit and Punched him making him fall into the water. Odious taunted the bandit and his daughter on how weak and pathetic he was trying to break his will, he turned and winked at nightingale \"oh don't worry sweetheart we'll have plenty of fun later.\" Nightingale screamed through the gag and struggled against the guard holding her. the bandit cried and begged for help and baby bandit screamed at him telling him to get up and he just couldn't. he was dying \"Please. I don't want you to die, let him live.\" Alex begged through tears, Becky was out right sobbing now and she looked at Roy \"enough Roy!\" she begged, Roy looked at both of them and dipped his head trying not to cry more, he nodded before placing his head in the bed and groaning, \"you promise? and don't cross you're fingers\" Alex asked as Roy lifted his head. \"yeah I Promise\" he said through tears \"Show me your hands!\" Alex said loudly to which Roy showed her his hands \"See?\" he said. Becky grabbed his hand and laced her fingers through, she glanced up at him her heart racing she just wanted to take all his pain away. The bandit sprung from the water and punched Odious in the face before jumping out of the pool running over to the guard and punching him too. he pulled the cloth from her mouth and untied her hands, she stared at him. \"you saved me...that's twice now...i owe you\" she said with a soft smile on her face, \"Twice?\" he asked confused, \"when you stole Evelyn and I, you saved me from losing myself completely.\" she replied holding a hand to his cheek \"Thankyou.\" Bandit picked up his Daughter and walked away, nightingale however walked over to the oblivious Odious and with his own sword impaled him, before walking of the find her hero again. She found Evelyn trying to trick Roy again when he told her to follow her heart throwing her pendant of the tower, she walked over and punched Evelyn in the nose \"that's for selling me out to him. i thought we were friends. obviously not.\" she hissed. Evelyn ran away and was never heard from again... Roy had his head resting on the bed with Becky resting her head on his shoulder her arm intertwined with his, gazing into the distance, \" we're an odd bunch aren't we?\" he mutter softly and we both agreed. im leaving the chapter at this as the rest in my own content with the last few clips. the storm hasnt passed yet. R&R; as usual and I LOVE YOU FEW READERS. YES. YOU![Chapter 6] A few days passed and Alexandria was sent back to her ward to heal. Becky was making daily trips to see her and also to see roy, she'd convinced him to stop drinking so much and he reluctantly oblidged. One bright morning she went to his ward looking pale and nervous. Roy looked at her as she hobbled over crutch in hand and asked \"Becky? is everything alright?\" Becky looked down before saying softly \"there's... something i need to tell you... I've been putting it off for so long...\" she looked at him with tears glistening in her eyes. Roy sat staring at her unsure what to say so he placed his hand on hers and gently squeezed. She clasped his hand in hers and clasped it tightly. \"you probably already know who I am, the lounge singer for the ritz\" she started shifting slightly. \"what you dont know is my momma was also a singer before I was and my father... he was our manager. I never had a choice. It was sing or get a beating or worse. I learned to pretend to act like everything was fine. it took a little piece of me each time but I never let him break me. I still had my foolish pride.\" she paused for a moment her left hand loosening and tightening its grip on Roys and her still injured right hand picking at the edge of her gown. \"Things got really bad one night, I didnt sing high enough or something silly like that... after the set my father grabbed me and pinned me to the wall. he said if you dont do better next time I will throw you to the kurb... better yet I'll sell you to some young rich men for the night\" Becky lowered her head down to the matress ashamed of her tears. Roy was shocked, he gently rubbed her shoulders as comforting as he could. Becky took a shuddered breath before she continued. \" Not long after this I tried to run away from him, I was gone a week before he found me. He beat me so bad I had a broken collar bone, cracked eye socket, 3 broken ribs, fractured pelvis and a dislocated jaw.\" Roy stared in horror at all the poor young woman had gone through but didn't have the heart to speak. \"when I turned 19 he told me that he was selling me off to a rich oil tycoon and that I had 6 months before our wedding, I hadn't even met the man. I couldn't do it... so I climbing onto the roof of our home and threw myself off. I just wanted it to end... and here I am.\" Silent tears streamed down her face as she spoke, her lip quivered and in that moment she looked truly broken. \"Becky... I had no idea...\" Roy said wiping away her tears his thumb gently caressing her cheek. Becky leaned into the touch, relishing the warmth it brought. She climbed onto the bed by his side and embraced him which Roy returned gently stroking her hair. Roy felt something stirr within him, something he didn't know he could feel. He felt the need to protect Becky, he didn't know how in his current state but he knew he had to. He lay on the bed processing all the things Becky had told him as she drifted off into a peaceful sleep her head resting softly on his chest.

To me it had just been normal, I grew up movingnto a lot of different places, and I lived most of my life in Chicago.nAbout a year ago we had moved to a small town in Texas. I never knewnwho my father was and I didn't care. My named me October because itnwas the month I was born in. My mother and I had gotnalong pretty well until about a year ago. She developed a drugnproblem and everything was downhill from there. She began to drinknall the time, she lost her job and had began to use her body to makenmoney. I gave up on her and life at that time. I was sitting home whennI got a call from the police telling me my mom had been murdered. Thenscariest part about it was that I actually felt relieved. The onlynproblem was that I was 16 and I didn't have anywhere to go or so Inthought. The police car stoppednin front of what seemed to be a run down house. We were in Odessa,nTexas, the land of Football or so I heard. The officer opened myndoor and I got out, followed by the social services representative,nCathy. She smiled at me and grabbed my suit case. I followed the bothnof them onto the pathway. They knocked on the door and waited fornsomeone to answer. It seemed like an eternity before somethingnhappened. \"Can I help you?\"nWe all turned around and saw a guy standing there looking confused.nThere were two other standing behind him. \"If you're looking fornmy dad you're not going to find him, not now at least.\" He saidngetting closer. \"Where is he?\"nCathy asked. \"We made an appointment with him for today.\" \"I don't know wherenhe is, maybe at work or maybe drunk. Why do you care so much anyway?\"nHe asked clearly angry. \"Are you DonnienBillingsley?\" The officer asked. \"Its Don.\" Hencorrected him quickly. \"Well we need to getninside, so why don't you just let us in?\" The officer said. \"I don't thinknthat's a good idea.\" He said walking past us and opening thendoor. \"What do you want anyway?\" He asked unlocking the door. \"This is October, Inam sure your father might've mentioned her.\" Cathy said smiling. Don looked at me. \"No,nhe didn't.\" He said bluntly. \"Well she is going tonbe living here, with you and your father.\" Cathy said. \"Oh right.\" Donnsaid sarcastically. \"Come in.\" He offered opening the door, henwaved the other two guys away and they left. \"Sorry the place is anwreck, Dad doesn't do much but sit around and drink.\" He saidnfollowing them. As soon as I walked innI could smell the alcohol, it didn't bother me that much I hadngrown used to it with my recently. Despite the smell though it seemednlike a nice enough place. Everything seemed almost new. \"If you could justnshow us the spare room we will be out of your way.\" Cathy saidnstill smiling. \"It's the last doornon the right.\" He said pointing down the hall. She nodded as hernand the officer walked away with my stuff. \"Are you really livingnhere?\" Don asked grabbing my arm when I went to follow them. \"Does it bother you?\"nI asked pulling away. He shrugged. \"Your dad is my mom'snbrother.\" I said \"My mom is dead now and I am underage, sorry fornthe inconvenience.\" \"Sorry about yournmom.\" He said looking away. \"It doesn't matter,nshe was a drunk anyway.\" I said. Cathy and the officernwalked out. \"Well sorry to leave you like this but we must be off,nplenty of things to do. Call us if you need something.\" Cathy saidnhugging me. \"Nice meeting you Donnie.\" She said smiling. They both walked outnand he closed the door. \"Does she always smile that much?\" Henasked looking at me. I nodded. \"So I guess you're my cousin?\"nHe asked. I nodded. \"What's your name again?\" \"October Billingsley,nyours?\" I asked. \"Don Billingsley.\"nHe said. \"Can I call younDonnie?\" I asked He Shrugged. \"Can Incall you Tobe?\" He asked, I shrugged. \"Guess we have atnleast two things in common.\" I said. \"A drunken parent and thensame name.\" \"Your are a littlenshort.\" He said standing straight up, towering over me. \"How tallnare you?\" He asked \"5'3\", I know Inam short.\" I said. \"Very short.\" \"Guess so, cousin.\"nHe said pushing me. \"What's that for?\"nI asked confused. \"Isn't that whatnfamily does?\" He asked. I shrugged and pushednhim back. Later that night Donnientook me with him a party. He said it was something about the end ofnthe summer or whatever. I just agreed and went with. His father wasnat home drunk and I didn't want to be alone. We pulled up outside anhouse that seemed to be oozing drunken teens and beer. I followed himninside. He introduced me to a couple guys he knew, Boobie, Chavo andnIvory. I talked to them for awhile once Donnie disappeared with somengirl. \"Don't worry, hendoes that a lot.\" Ivory said noticing my lost face. \"Yeah, if you say so.nWhere is the bathroom?\" I asked. They pointed me to a generalndirection. I walked and saw three doors, one of them had to be thenbathroom. I opened the first one, nothing but an empty room. I openednthe second one only to see two people in quickly getting dressed.nThey both looked at me. \"I am so sorry.\" I said before shuttingnthe door. I walked away feelingnembarrassed. I walked outside and sat on the floor. I was sittingnthere hoping that Donnie would come out eventually. I gave up andnjust stood up. I turned around to walk back inside only to walk intonsomeone. Because of my I height I basically walked into someone'snchest. I stepped back to seenthe same guy from the second room, my cheeks felt hot. \"I am sorrynabout.\" I said looking down. \"Don't worry aboutnit.\" He said. \"Your Billingsley cousin right?\" He asked. Innodded. \"He asked me to drive you home.\" He said. I look at him, unsure.nI know when kids are little stranger tell me 'I'm your mom'snfriend' or 'I know your dad' so I was hesitant. He could tell. \"I am not going tontry anything, I promise.\" He said. \"My name is Mike, MikenWinchell.\" He said. \"Where is your car?\"nI asked. \"This way,\" Henpointed to a truck and began to walk, I followed against my betternjudgment. He seemed nice enough. I got in and he drovenme. The ride was quiet and he seemed concentrated. We finally pullednup in front of the house. \"Thanks for the ride.\" I said as Inopened the door. \"No problem,nanytime.\" He said as I got out.[Chapter 2] I walked up the path tornthe front door and heard yelling. I opened the door to see Donniernwith a football taped to his hands, while Charles hit it over andrnover again. There was a girl putting her shirt on in a hurry andrnlooking very uncomfortable. \"You gonna drop itrnnow?\" Charles yelled hitting the ball again. \"Dad stop!\" Donniernyelled. I slammed the door shutrnand all three looked at me. Donnie looked embarrassed and Charlesrnlooked like he could careless. \"I'm leaving.\"rnThe girl said and ran out the house. Charles huffed and then walkedrnout the room leaving Donnie with the football taped to his hands. \"Are you okay?\" Irnasked sitting next to him. He just shrugged. \"Need help?\" Hernnodded. I began to take the tape off in silence, a very awkwardrnsilence. Once the tape was completely off and Donnie had his clothesrnback on we were just sitting there. \"Did you have funrntonight?\" He asked suddenly looking at me. \"Yeah, your friendsrnare funny.\" I said. \"How did you getrnhome?\" he asked. \"I didn't mean to forget you just, got caughtrnup I guess.\" He said honestly. \"Its fine, Mike gavernme a ride.\" I said. \"Mike? MikernWinchell?\" He asked looking at me wide-eyed. I nodded confused. \"Irncan't believe that, he is really weird about meeting new people.\"rnHe said. \"He told me you askedrnhim to.\" I said now confused. \"I would never askrnhim.\" He said, \"He is a nice guy though.\" He added noticing thernworried look on my face. \"He is cool and nice but he is just in hisrnown world most of the time. He doesn't let people in easily.\" Hernsaid. \"Well I am off to bed.\" He said standing. \"You want torncome with me to practice tomorrow?\" He asked. \"Sure but for what?\"rnI asked. \"Football.\" He saidrnlike it was obvious and then walked away. Football town wasn'trnjust a joke around her. I woke up before bothrnDonnie and Charles. I went on a morning run, it was a habit I had started when my mom became a drunk. It gave me a reason to leave the house earlier in the morning. I ran around and finally decided to go back. I began to cook when Charles walked in. He had arnclear hangover. \"What's that horrible smell?\" he asked. \"its eggs andrnpancakes.\" I said not taking offense to his comment. \"Go wake Donnie up,rnhe can't be late.\" He said before walking into the bathroom. I went into Donnie'srnroom and I was stunned. The whole room was covered in footballrnposters, football pictures, everything had to do with football. Irnwalked to his bed and sat down and began to wake him up. He was surprisingly arnlight sleeper so it took only a minute. Him and I were sitting at therntable eating before Charles walked out the bathroom finally. \"You ready forrnfootball?\" he asked walking around the kitchen to get a cup ofrncoffee. Donnie just nodded and continued to eat. \"What time isrnpractice?\" He asked. \"I'm not sure, Irnthink 9.\" He answered. \"I will drop you offrnthen, need to work today.\" He said sitting at the table with us. \"You don't havernwork today.\" Donnie said standing and putting away his plate. \"Irncan drive myself.\" He said. \"Who are you to tellrnme when I do and don't work.\" He asked. \"You just want torndrive to the bar and I don't need that now.\" He asked barely loudrnenough for anyone to hear. \"Fine drive your ownrndamn self.\" Charles said flipping his chair and walking back to hisrnroom. Donnie took a deeprnbreath and then turned to me. \"Are you coming?\" He asked. Irnnodded. \"Well then get dressed cause we have to hurry.\" I nodded.rn\"You don't really talk much do you?\" He asked. I shook my head.rnHe laughed. \"Lets go.\" We were half way therernwhen I noticed Donnie's hands were still a little red from thernprevious night. I wanted to ask so badly why it happened, I wanted tornknow. I needed to know but I didn't ask. Donnie eventually noticedrnme looking at his hands and he adjusted them on the wheel. Donnie told me to sitrnon the player's bench because the stands would be crowded and Irnmight be uncomfortable. I just did as he said. I was sitting watchingrnthem warm up when the Coach came over to me. \"October right?\" Hernasked sitting next to me, I nodded. \"Its good to see some otherrnBillingsley family out here.\" He said. \"I'm Coach Gaines by thernway.\" He said. \"So you like football?\" He asked. \"Not really, don'trnreally care about games.\" I said, his face seemed to drop. \"I dornlike baseball though.\" I said. \"Baseball?\" Hernasked looking sick. \"I lived in Chicago,rnthey have two baseball teams and the football team kind of sucks.\"rnI said honestly. He stood up and blewrnhis whistle all the players froze and looked at him. \"Don come herernand talk to your crazy cousin.\" He yelled. \"What's wrong?\"rnDonnie asked confused. \"She likes baseballrnand not football.\" He said, the whole team looked at Donnie and hernlooked slightly embarrassed. \"Come on.\" He said to me as hernwalked onto the field. I followed close behind, my face gettingrnwarmer. \"Now boys, I want you all the pay close attention.\" Hernsaid calling over everyone. \"Its not her fault she wasn't taughtrnright, football is not just a game now is it?\" \"No coach.\" Theyrnall answered together. \"It's a way ofrnlife, it's a tradition, its an American celebration,\" He saidrnlooking at me. \"Well isn'trnbaseball an American celebration?\" I asked confused. There was a laugh fromrnsomewhere causing Coach Gaines to look at the boys. \"Sorry sir.\"rnMike said looking serious. \"Did you just laugh?\"rnHe asked. \"Yes sir.\" Mike said. \"Well if you got Mikernto laugh I guess your not half bad.\" He said patting my back andrnsmiling. He blew his whistle and they began their drills again. \"Irnam just messing with you, you know?\" he said as we walked back tornthe benches. I felt relief sweep through my mind. \"But you have tornknow a little about football to be here, so watch and learn.\" Hernsaid smiling, I just nodded.[Chapter 3] At the end of practicernI must admit at how amazed I was. I really never paid much attentionrnto sports, or football but there boys were so into it. They were sornintense that it made me have to pay attention. Seeing Donnie on thernfield was nothing like the way he acted at home. At home he was quietrnand depressed. Here he was smiling, laughing and seemed to be havingrna good time. I wished he was like that at home. We were walking to hisrncar when Chavo came running over to us. \"Hey do you want to getrnsome burgers real quick?\" He asked Donnie. Donnie looked at me.rn\"You okay with that Tobe?\" He asked. \"Yeah that's fine,rnDonnie.\" I answered smiling. \"She speaks.\"rnDonnie said sarcastically as we got in the car. He drove behind a truckrnwhich all the other guys had piled into. \"Coach likes you.\" Hernsaid breaking the silence. \"What makes you thinkrnthat?\" I asked. \"Well he said it forrnstarters and second you made Mike laugh.\" He said. \"Is that a hard thingrnto do?\" I asked. \"Well he never laughsrnor smiles during football season.\" He said. I nodded rememberingrnMike's smile. He had a nice smile, he should smile more often. Irnthought and suddenly stopped. No more thinking about Mike, I said tornmyself. The last thing I needed was a crush on the schoolrnquarterback. It was pretty clear what he was after, I had seen itrnwith my own eyes. We pulled in andrnfollowed the rest of the guys in. We sat at a booth; Donnie got uprnand ordered the food for everyone. \"So how long are yournstaying?\" Ivory asked looking at me. \"14 months.\" Irnsaid. \"That's a longrntime.\" Mike said from across the table. \"Why are you staying thatrnlong?\" \"Well that's whenrnI'll be 18 so I can leave.\" I said. \"Wait, so he has…well he like owns you?\" Chavo asked exasperated. \"No one owns.\" Irnsnapped. \"He is my uncle, only living relative kind of thing.\" \"Oh your mom died?\"rnChavo asked when Mike elbowed him. \"It's just a question.\" \"Yeah she died but Irngot over it. She was a drunk, runs in the family I guess.\" I saidrnjust as Donnie walked over with the food. \"Thanks Donnie.\" I saidrnas he handed me my food. \"So how old are yournthen?\" Chavo asked smirking. \"Too young for you.\"rnDonnie said shoving him his food. \"Whatever.\" Chavornsaid. \"What happened to your hands?\" he asked noticing how redrnDonnie's hands were. \"Nothing, just thernsun I guess.\" Donnie said shrugging and sitting next to me. \"You were wearingrngloves.\" Mike stated. \"What are you somernfucking detective?\" Donnie snapped at him. \"It was just arnquestion Billingsley, relax.\" Ivory said calmly. \"Whatever, just mindrnyour own business, all of you.\" He said as he began to eat. I looked away knowingrnDonnie obviously didn't want to talk about what happened. I turnedrnback and saw Mike looking at me but I ignored it. I stayed quiet thernrest of time I just sat listening. I liked listening to them; theyrntalked about stupid guy stuff. I must admit it was pretty funny,rnthat's when I realized Mike really didn't smile. Ever. We soon left and wentrnback to the house. Donnie said he had to leave so he did. He didn'trnask me to go which was fine. I just wanted a day to settle. I wasrnsitting outside on the steps when a little girl walked onto the yard. \"Hey are you Don'srnnew sister?\" She asked. She had bleach blonde hair and bright bluerneyes. \"I heard he had new family.\" \"I am his cousinrnactually, my name is October.\" I answered. Suddenly a woman camernwalking over and grabbed her. \"I am sorry about that.\" She saidrnforcing a smile. \"Is Charles here?\" She asked. I shook my head.rn\"Do you know when he will be back?\" She asked. I shook my headrnagain. \"I know you just moved in and everything but I just reallyrnneed someone to watch her. Just for a couple hours, the babysitter isrnrunning late and I cant miss work again.\" She said quickly. \"Yeah, I'll watchrnher.\" I said. She looked surprised. \"I used to baby-sit all therntime.\" I said. \"Oh my God, thankrnyou.\" She said. \"Kaylee go and behave. Charlie and Donnie will bernback soon, ok?\" She said kissing her cheek. \"Really, thank you.\"rnShe said walking to her car. I walked inside withrnKaylee. \"So what do you want to do?\" I asked walking her into myrnroom. \"Your make-up.\" Shernsaid laughing. \"Well how old arernyou?\" I asked sitting her on the bed. She held up four fingers.rn\"And you know how to do make-up?\" I asked. \"You have to trustrnme!\" She began to sing. \"Ok,\" I nodded. I shouldn't haverntrusted her; let's just keep it at that. It was getting late and nornone had showed up yet. She was lying on my bed sleeping. I just gotrnup to go wash my face when there was a knock at the door. I rushedrnover hoping it was Donnie, I opened the door and there was MikernWinchell. He looked at me, my make-up mostly and then looked at thernfloor stifling a smile. \"What's up?\" Irnasked trying to ask casually. \"Is Donnie here?\"rnHe asked looking at me. \"No, he should bernsoon though. You want to come in.\" I asked. He nodded and walkedrnin. \"So I see you were a little bored.\" He said motioning to mernface. \"Nothing in Odessa.\" He said. \"Actually I didn'trndo this.\" I stated. \"The little girl from next door did, Kaylee.\" \"Oh, is she stillrnhere?\" he asked. \"She's sleeping.\"rnI said. \"Oh…\" He said.rn\"Actually I didn't come over here to talk to Donnie; I wanted torntalk to you.\" He said, I nodded. \"I know you might've gottenrnthe wrong impression about me, what you saw at the party-\" \"It's yourrnbusiness.\" I said stopping him. \"I know but it's…Irndon't do that kind of stuff, ever.\" He said. \"Especially aroundrnthis time.\" He said. \"I just didn't want you thinking badly ofrnme.\" He said. \"Well its forgottenrnthen.\" I said. \"Let me go wash my face, if you don't mind.\" Irnsaid walking to the bathroom. I washed my face andrnthen went back to see Charles talking to Mike about football.rnCharles was clearly drunk and Mike seemed annoyed. I didn't knowrnwhat to do so I just waited for awhile and realized theirrnconversation was never going to end unless I interrupted. \"Hey, Charles.\" Hernturned to me. \"The lady from next door came looking for you, sherndropped her kid off here.\" I said. He sighed. \"Irnshould've known she would do that.\" He stood up. \"I told her Irnwasn't watching her kid anymore, little girl ruined the house lastrntime.\" He explained. \"Is she still here?\" He asked. \"She is sleeping, inrnmy bed.\" I answered. \"I'll go get herrnthen.\" He said walking out. \"Well I should berngoing already, got to get home.\" Mike said standing. \"Tell Don Irnstopped by for me.\" He said walking to the door. \"You said you weren'trnhere to see him though?\" I asked confused. \"Yeah but I don'trnneed him getting the wrong impression.\" He said walking out. \"What's the wrongrnimpression?\" I yelled out as he walked to his truck. \"Who knows, Don isrncrazy about some things.\" He said getting in. He waved and thenrndrove off.[Chapter 4] The followingrnMonday I started school with the rest of the Odessa teens. It wasrneasy, most of the classes I had already taken so I didn't reallyrnhave much of a challenge. When people found out I was Donnie'srncousin I was treated pretty well, by the guys at least. Girls hadrnalways been bitches to me regardless of where I went, so in Odessarnthey were no different. The first football gamernwas coming up and it was a big deal to everyone. The team was treatedrnlike celebrities wherever they went. I went to all their practices sornwhen the first game came I would be able to understand and CoachrnGaines made sure I understood everything. Charles showed up tornsome of the practices and just criticized Donnie for everything herndid. Every time he fumbled or tripped or missed a pass he wasrnyelling from the stands. I was embarrassed for Charles; he didn'trnrealize how ridiculous he looked. It was the day of theirrnfirst game and I was in the bathroom. I had just flushed the toiletrnwhen I heard some girls walking in and talking. \"I can't believernthey even talk to her, she isn't that pretty.\" One girl said. \"Why do you have tornbe so critical of everyone?\" Another girl asked. \"More like jealous.\"rnA third said laughing, I recognized her voice as a girl named Mariarnin one of my classes. \"Why would I bernjealous? I can have any guy I want.\" The first one snapped. \"Irnfeel bad for her actually, to have to live with Don and his drunkrnfather.\" She said laughing. \"Its not like itsrnanyone's fault.\" Maria snapped. \"You know you can't have anyrnguy so just stop trying to flatter yourself, Melissa.\" \"I can, your just madrnbecause I got to Billingsley before you.\" Melissa said annoyed.rn\"Cause we all know you have been in love with him since like 7thrngrade.\" \"You can be such arnbitch sometimes.\" Maria said footsteps and then the door closed. \"Why do you have tornact like that about Don, you know how she feels.\" The other girlrnsaid. \"I don't care, it'srnobvious. Not like he cares anyway.\" Melissa said. \"No one ever saysrnanything about you practically throwing yourself at Mike all therntime.\" She said snapping. \"Please I don'trnhave to throw myself at him. He likes it.\" Melissa said. \"Now yournbetter mind your own business Aubrey before you get put in yourrnplace.\" She said almost yelling. \"Now let's go, Mike might justrnget lucky tonight.\" \"He won't sleeprnwith you again; I heard he has a girlfriend.\" Aubrey said. \"What?\" Melissarnasked. \"Well Comer'srngirlfriend said to me that Comer told her that Chavo told himrnbecause he heard Don talking about it.\" She said. \"Number one, that is way too confusing and number two that's a lie,rnbesides who would his girlfriend be anyway?\" She asked interested. \"OctoberrnBillingsley.\" Aubrey stated. I felt my stomach droprnto my feet. I felt the walls of the stall closing in on me. I hadrnbeen in here for too long and felt sick. I wanted to vomit. \"That's notrntrue…You know what I will just ask him.\" She stormed out followedrnby Aubrey. I flung the door openrnand began to take deep breaths. I had never spent so much time in arnstall in my whole life. I felt my lunch coming back, I leaned intornthe toilet and threw up. I walked outside andrnsaw Mike standing there. Where was Donnie? He was supposed to take mernhome. Mike waved to me and I walked over to him. \"Are you okay?\" Hernasked. \"You smell like-\" \"Like puke? I gotrnsick, sorry.\" I said standing away from him. \"No, it's nornproblem. Everyone gets sick eventually, Don asked me to drive yournhome. He is meeting some girl.\" Mike said. \"Why would he ask yournfrom everyone?\" I asked. Mike shrugged. \"He told me he wouldrnnever ask you because you're not comfortable with new people.\" Irnsaid. \"Well that's truernbut he still asked.\" Mike stated. \"He didn't ask yournafter the party, why did you take me then?\" I asked. \"Well I knew he leftrnand you needed a ride home. Chavez and Boobie were completely wasted,rnthere was no one else.\" He said. \"Do you want a ride or not?\"rnHe asked annoyed. \"I don't know…\"rnHe just stared at me. \"Okay, fine.\" I said still unsure. \"Come on, I don'trnhave all day.\" He said and began to walk. I followed keeping behindrnhim a couple steps. \"Are you sure you are okay?\" He asked once wernreached the truck. \"You are acting really strange.\" He saidrnopening the door. I heard someone callingrnhis name. We both turned and saw Melissa waving. Mike sighed andrnclimbed in his truck and I got in on the other side. She walked up tornthe truck. \"Hey Mike, are you ready for the game tonight?\" Shernasked. He nodded. \"Are you going to the party tonight?\" He shookrnhis head. \"We could have some more fun.\" She said. \"I have to go, I amrngoing to be late.\" He said starting the truck. \"Can you give me arnride home, Maria left already?\" She asked. \"I can't, I amrnalready taking October.\" He said motioning to me. Melissa thenrnrealized I was already in the truck. She rolled her eyes at me. \"Irnhave to go, bye Melissa.\" He said and pulled out the parking lot. \"I think she likesrnyou.\" I said once we were driving. \"Yeah she likes thernrest of the team too.\" He said. \"I don't want anything to dornwith her.\" \"Well you didrnbefore-\" \"I told you before Irndon't do that kind of stuff.\" He snapped looking at me. \"Okay.\" I saidrnlooking at the road. \"Besides, she isrnannoying.\" He added, I nodded. \"Are you hungry?\" He asked. Irnnodded. \"Let's go get food; I am sure you don't want to seernwhat Don and Maria are up to now anyway.\" He said. \"What aboutrnpractice?\" I asked. \"Well we can eat andrnthen go back, aren't you going to practice and the game?\" Hernasked. I nodded. \"Well then there isn't a problem.\"[Chapter 5] We pulled into the samernburger place and sat at a table. \"I will go get some food.\" Hernsaid walking to the counter. I saw Cathy, the social services womanrnwalk in. I looked down hoping she wouldn't notice me but she did. She sat across from me,rnsmiling. \"Hey October how is everything?\" She asked. I put myrnhands in my lap; I hated shaking hands with people. \"It's fine.\" Irnanswered hoping she would leave. \"Well glad to hear,rnare you here alone?\" She asked looking around. Just then Mike returnedrnwith our food and looked at Cathy like she was crazy. She smiled atrnhim. \"Hi, I am Cathy, October's social services representative.\"rnShe said brightly. \"You mean like arnsocial worker?\" Mike asked sitting next to me now because Cathyrntook his seat. \"Yes exactly likernthat.\" She turned to me. \"The police have been working hard andrnthey believe your mom's murderer was an old boyfriend from Chicagornnamed David, do you remember him?\" She asked. I tensed up instantlyrnand looked away. I remembered him. Cathy and Mike both noticed. Irnfelt a hand against mine suddenly, I relaxed slightly. \"Yeah Irnremember him.\" I answered. I felt Mike's fingers wrap around minernas I continued. \"They broke up and he was upset about it.\" Irnfinished. \"Well ok, if we needrnanything more we will contact you.\" She smiled \"It was nicernseeing you.\" She stood up and walked away. \"Your mom wasrnmurdered?\" Mike asked turning to me. I nodded. \"You didn't sayrnthat before.\" \"Its not like itsrnsomething to be proud of.\" I said and began to eat. I hadn't realizedrnuntil we were done eating that Mike's hand was still in mine and Irndidn't mind. He looked at his watch.rn\"Well I am going to be late, are you done?\" he asked, I nodded.rn\"Well time to get going.\" He said standing, letting go of myrnhand, and I followed. We walked to the truck and got in. \"I amrnsorry about snapping before…\" I looked at him confused. \"AboutrnMelissa.\" He clarified. \"Don't worry aboutrnit, I got it.\" I said. \"You don't do that.\" I mocked hisrnvoice. \"Thanks.\" He saidrnsmirking. We drove the shortrndistance to the stadium; everyone was on the field already. I sat on the benchesrnand Mike walked to the locker rooms. A short time later Mike andrnDonnie walked out and joined everyone. I was anxious, I wantedrnpractice to end so I could watch the game. I wanted to see them playrnagainst a team. I wanted to feel what everyone had been talkingrnabout. I needed to feel like I was apart of them. Practice finally endedrnand there was an hour until the game. Donnie came running over to mernand sat down. \"Aren't yournsupposed to be changing?\" I asked. \"What are you doingrnwith Mike?\" He asked. \"What are you talkingrnabout?\" I asked confused. He stood up and beganrnto yell. \"I keep hearing all this stuff about you guys, Mike keepsrnto himself so its not like he would tell me, plus you are my cousinrnso I don't really want to know if you slept with him anyway but I-\" \"Donnie!\" I yelledrn\"I don't know what you are talking about, honestly. Nothing isrnhappening.\" I said. \"I didn't sleep with him or anything.\" \"You didn't?\" hernasked confused. I shook my head. Donnie turned to where Chavo andrnBoobie were standing. Mike looked at me embarrassed and then began to walk away.rn\"They said-\" \"Don't listen tornthem.\" I said watching Mike walk away. \"Where were yourntoday?\" He asked. \"I was with Mike, hernsaid you were with Maria.\" I said. \"Did you ask him to take mernhome?\" I asked angry now. \"Yeah but I meantrnhome, where did you guys go?\" He asked. \"Billingsley, changernnow.\" Coach Gaines called. \"I need to talk tornyou later.\" He said walking away. I was tired and wantedrnto sleep but my mind was on an overdrive. I couldn't stop thinkingrnabout Mike, about what Donnie said, about Cathy talking about David,rnit was just too much. I felt someone sit next to me. I looked uprnexpecting to see Donnie but it was Mike. My heart sped up. \"Hey.\" I saidrnturning and facing him. \"I am sorry aboutrnwhat Donnie said, I never said that I slept-\" \"Don't worry. Irndidn't think you did anyway.\" I said. \"You didn't?\" hernseemed surprised, I shook my head. \"Its just girls always assumernguys start that kind of stuff.\" He said. \"No worries, justrnplay your game tonight.\" I said patting his knee. He cleared his throat.rn\"What are you doing after the game?\" He asked. \"I don't know yet,rnit depends on Donnie.\" I answered. \"You want to gornsomewhere with me?\" He asked. I nodded. \"Even if we loserntonight?\" \"Baseball fan,rnremember?\" I said, he smiled. \"I almost forgotrnabout that.\" He said. \"Don't think I amrngoing to sleep with you just because you are a quarterback.\" I saidrnsmiling. \"I told you before…\"rnHe stopped. \"You were joking?\" I nodded. \"Ok, just glad you gotrnit now, I will see you later.\" He said once Donnie began walkingrnover. Donnie sat next to mernon the bench. \"Hey sorry about yelling before.\" He said. \"Irnjust got worked up that's all, you want to go with me and Maria?\"rnHe asked. \"To where?\" Irnasked. \"We are just going tornpick up food.\" He said. \"Sure but I alreadyrnate.\" I said standing and we began walking. \"What are you doingrnwith her Donnie?\" I asked. \"What do you mean?\"rnHe asked confused. \"Are you just messingrnwith her? It seems like she really likes you.\" I said. \"Yeah just likernMelissa likes Mike and Aubrey likes Chavo. All these girls playrngames, we know that.\" He said. He waved and I turned to see Mariarnand Melissa standing there. They walked over by us.rn\"Hey I asked Melissa to come with us, if you don't mind.\" Mariarnsaid smiling and grabbed Donnie's hand. He just shrugged and werncontinued to walk.[Chapter 6] We got in the car, Irnsat in back with Melissa who I felt like was trying to burn a hole onrnthe side of my head with her eyes. We finally pulled into same placernlike always I felt relieved. My stomach seemed began to turn when Irnnoticed Mike's truck and the guys sitting inside already. We walkedrnin. \"Hey I will join yournguys in a second.\" Melissa said smirking and walking over to theirrntable. We sat on the otherrnside; Donnie went to get their food. It was awkward sitting therernwith Maria. \"So how long are you visiting?\" She asked. \"I am staying herernactually.\" I said. \"Oh really? I didn'trnknow that. Don was telling me about you before, nothing bad though.\"rnShe said. \"Since you're his cousin and all.\" \"Are you just messingrnwith him?\" I asked bluntly. \"Who Don?\" Irnnodded. \"No, I would never do that to him. I have known him for sornlong and I wouldn't want that.\" She said. \"Maybe you shouldrntell him that, he seems to think you are.\" I said. She noddedrnslowly. Melissa came back andrnsat next to her. \"What's with the quiet?\" She asked. We bothrnshrugged lightly. \"Anyway, do you think-\" \"Here is your foodrnmadams.\" Donnie said handing Maria and me food. \"I told you I alreadyrnate.\" I said. \"A little food neverrnhurt anyone.\" Donnie said shrugging and sitting next to me now.rn\"When did you eat anyway?\" He asked. \"You were at practice withrnus.\" \"I went out withrnMike, remember?\" I said. \"Oh yeah, I forgot.\"rnHe said. \"It's not like it's a big deal.\" He said in arnmocking tone because of his reaction to Mike before. \"Anyway, back to whatrnI was saying.\" Melissa interrupted. \"Do you think Mike is goingrnto the party tonight?\" She asked. \"I thought he alreadyrntold you no?\" Maria asked. \"I am asking Donnie,rncan you convince him?\" Melissa asked. \"You are the one who gotrnhim to go to the last one.\" \"Yeah I know I dornregret that.\" He said. \"But no I can't do that.\" \"Come on, for me! Please, it would do him some good to get out.\" Melissa said. \"He already has plans with somerngirl.\" Donnie said shrugging. \"So I guess he is getting out.\" \"When did he tell yournthat?\" I asked quickly. \"Jealous orrnsomething?\" He asked smiling, I rolled my eyes. \"After practice, he said he wasrnmaking plans with someone and when I asked who he told me not tornworry.\" He said. \"And you assume it'srna girl?\" Melissa asked. \"Well who else wouldrnit be?\" Donnie asked. \"I don't know, hisrnmom we all know she-\" \"Don't go there.\"rnDonnie said before she could finish. It was awkwardly quiet afterrnthat. Once I walked into thernstadium and saw the stands filled it was a shock. They were notrnplaying, this was serious. I didn't want to sit on the benches, Irnwanted the full affect. I sat with Maria and Melissa because I didn'trnhave anyone else to sit with. Once the game startedrnit was crazy. There was shouting and yelling and cheering. It wasrnlike everyone was one body, all breathing together, chantingrntogether, calling together. It was amazing. I never realized untilrnbefore what it really felt like to be part of something this amazing. After the first halfrnall the players began to walk to the locker rooms, I smiled at Mikernand he waved. Melissa waved too. \"I told you he wanted this again.\"rnShe said to Maria who just rolled her eyes. \"I don't think hernwas waving to you.\" She said motioning to me, I was still smiling. \"What the hell isrnyour problem?\" Melissa yelled at me. \"What are you talkingrnabout?\" I asked confused, I had been floating on a cloud and was lost. \"Leave Mike alone, hernis mine.\" She said. \"You don't ownrnhim.\" I said. \"Besides if he wanted you he would go to thernparty, not out with someone else.\" \"Its not like hernlikes you anyway, you don't have anything to offer him.\" She saidrndramatically. \"He doesn't like girls with drug addict parents.\"rnShe laughed. \"Excuse me?\" thatrnhurt a lot to hear, I didn't know how she knew about that. No onernknew about that except Charles. \"You heard me, gornback to your drugs before you screw up his future too.\" She said. \"You're not evenrnworth it.\" I said and began to walk away. I was almost gone when Irnheard my name being called. I turned and saw Maria standing there. \"Don't listen tornher, she just talks a lot.\" Maria said walking closer. \"Everyonernknow Mike likes you, I don't even know why he would have plans withrnanother girl.\" \"He doesn't,\" Irnsaid \"He has plans with me.\" I said. Maria smiled. \"Thenrnthere is really nothing to worry about, lets finish the game.\" Shernsaid grabbing my arm and walking me back to the stands. Just as I satrnthe Permian Panthers walked back on the field. They were well ahead inrnpoints and everyone was happy. Then before anyone could say anythingrnBoobie was on the floor and not moving. The whole stadium went quiet,rnnot even the crickets could be heard. They carried him offrnand the game ended soon. I was standing outsidernthe stadium with Maria and Melissa waiting for Mike and Donnie. \"Dornyou think he is going to be fine?\" Maria asked suddenly. \"No.\" I said. \"Thatrnwas bad.\" \"What do you knowrnabout injuries?\" Melissa snapped. \"Hey ladies.\"rnDonnie's voice said suddenly. \"Ready to party?\" He asked. \"What about Boobie?\"rnMaria asked. \"He will be finernCoach said.\" Donnie said. \"I told you that yourndon't know anything.\" Melissa said looking at me. \"I still don'trnthink he is fine.\" I said. \"He isn't.\" Mikernsuddenly appeared. \"We are screwed.\" He said. \"Don't act likernthat.\" Melissa said standing closer to him. \"Let's just go tornthe party and have fun.\" She said grabbing his arm. He shook her off. \"Irntold you before I wasn't going. I have plans.\" He said looking atrnme. I smiled and felt my cheeks turn red. \"That has to be arnjoke.\" Melissa said looking at me. \"Come on.\" Mikernsaid ignoring her. \"I'll see you guys later.\" He grabbed myrnhand and we began to walk away. I felt my heart speed up and myrnstomach begin to turn. He pulled me closer to him. \"Not too late, that'srnmy baby cousin.\" Donnie yelled. \"She is only 16!\" He calledrnout. We got into the truckrnand drove in silence.[Chapter 7] We pulled overrnto what seemed to be an empty area. We got out and Mike pulled out arnblanket and set it on the floor. I sat next to him. We sat in silencernfor a while but then began talking. \"Our season is sornshot now.\" He said staring at the stars. I rolled over andrnleaned on my elbows. \"You guys won't lose because of only onernplayer.\" I said. \"Football is a team effort.\" \"You really have beenrnlistening to Coach Gaines.\" He said smiling. \"What people don'trnunderstand is that our whole defense is built around one person andrnnow he is gone. Who knows if and when he will play again.\" Hernturned to side and looked at me. \"They do have you;rnyou're good, really good.\" I said. \"Aren't you arncharmer?\" He said smirking. \"If we lose this whole place willrnhate us, who knows what Dons dad is going to do.\" He said. \"Andrnmy mom…\" \"Well then why don'trnyou just focus on something else.\" I suggested. \"I don't havernanything else, all I am is football. Its all I've ever been.\" Hernsaid. \"Most of the other guys don't care about leaving. They don'trncare about becoming their parents.\" He said. \"What is your dadrnlike?\" I asked. \"He…he is just notrnsomething I would want to be.\" He said. \"I need to get out, Irnwant to get out.\" He lay on his back again. \"I think you can dornit, people can always do what they want.\" I said. \"That's what they say inrnschool but this is real life, even you know that.\" He said. \"Yournlived in Chicago right? How is that place compared to here?\" Hernasked looking at me. \"Its…dirty andrncluttered.\" I said honestly. \"A lot of people, a lot ofrnopportunities too. So many people most don't even know whenrnfootball season is.\" I said. \"Like you?\" Hernasked. I moved closer to himrnand lay next to him. \"Yeah like me.\" I answered smiling. I felt his hand closernin on mine. \"I like you October.\" He said \"I like you toornMike.\" I said gently squeezing his hand. \"Can I ask yournsomething?\" He nodded. \"Is there something wrong with your mom?\"rnI asked. \"Where did you getrnthat idea from?\" He asked sitting up. \"Well Melissarnmentioned her and Donnie stopped her, he seemed upset about it.\" Irnsaid. \"My ma….she is...isrnfine.\" He said. \"Just most people don't get that.\" \"If there wasrnsomething wrong would you tell me?\" I asked. \"Not yet eventuallyrnsoon maybe.\" He answered honestly. \"I don't want you to thinkrnmy family is crazy yet.\" \"Compared to mine,rnyours already sounds better.\" I said. \"You have Don atrnleast.\" He said. \"I don't really have anyone.\" \"Well you can trustrnme, I am good at secrets.\" I said. He smiled and leaned over me. He starred at me; Irnlooked into his eyes and felt like I could see his full soul. \"Yournhave the nicest eyes I have ever seen.\" He said softly. He movedrncloser and I felt his lips against mine. I lifted my headrnslightly to deepen the kiss and I felt his tongue slowly enter myrnmouth. He pushed his body against mine getting closer than I thoughtrnpossible but I needed more. I pulled him closer if it was evenrnpossible. We stayed like that forrna while, I liked kissing him. It was sweet and soft. He wasn'trnaggressive like the other boys I had kissed, he wasn't pushy aboutrnanything either. After sometime hernpulled away. \"We should go.\" He said looking at me. \"Why?\" I asked. \"If we stay anyrnlonger I am going to want to have sex with you.\" He said. \"Who said I didn'trnwant to?\" I asked. \"You did.\" He saidrnsitting next to me now. \"I know, you'rernright.\" I said. \"Its cold.\" I said. \"Here wear my coat.\"rnHe said grabbing it from the truck. \"Thanks\" I said andrnput it on. \"Its smells like you.\" I said \"What do I smellrnlike, sweat?\" He asked. \"No you smell likernMike Winchell.\" I said smiling. \"Thanks.\" He saidrnconfused. He wrapped his hand around mine and I rested my head on hisrnshoulder. We sat like that for a long time. \"I really do like yourna lot Mike.\" I said. \"Me too.\" He said.rn\"We should go for real now.\" He said looking at his watch. \"Let's go.\" Irnsaid standing. We drove in silencernbecause neither of us wanted to say something that would ruinrneverything that happened. We finally pulled up in front of the house.rnThere was a police car in the drive way. \"That's not good.\" Irnsaid. \"You want me to go inrnwith you?\" Mike asked turning off the truck. \"No its fine, I willrnbe fine.\" I said. I looked at the clock, it was 2. \"It's late.\"rnI said. \"I don't thinkrnCharles is going to be mad.\" He said. \"You're right,rnthanks for taking me out.\" I said smiling. I leaned over and kissedrnhim softly. \"I had a great time.\" I opened the door. \"See you soon.\" Hernsaid as I got out. I walked up the drivernway and into the house. Sitting on the couchrnwas Charles, Donnie and Cathy. A police officer was sitting on thernchair, they were completely silent. \"Hey, what's goingrnon?\" I asked. \"Hi, my name isrnofficer James.\" The officer said standing. \"I need to talk to yournabout your mother and David.\" He said. \"Oh, okay.\" I saidrnunsure. \"Don't worry aboutrnanything, I am going to sit with you the whole time so anything yourndon't want to answer you don't have too.\" Cathy said, notrnsmiling this time. I nodded. \"Come into thernkitchen with me, this is a private investigation.\" Officer Jamesrnsaid and walked away. I looked at Donnie whornlooked completely scared and confused. I turned back to the kitchenrnand walked in.[Chapter 8] Officer James was sitting at the table he had a pen and pad out ready to write. \"Now I am just going to ask some questions.\" He said, I nodded. \"Anything you don't want to answer you don't have too but its in your best interest to answer all questions fully to the best of your knowledge.\" He said firmly, I nodded slowly. \"What was your mothers name?\" He asked. \"Caitlin Billingsley.\" I said. \"Her boyfriend was David Daniels?\" I nodded. \"How long were they together?\" He asked. \"About a year and half but that was a year ago. They broke up and then we moved down here from Chicago.\" I answered. He nodded and wrote. \"Do you know anything about David, what he did for a living? Was he violent? Did he ever drink or do drugs? That sort of thing.\" He asked. \"Well he never talked about work and he didn't drink ever. He got high sometimes, smoked pot...I mean marijuana.\" I added quickly. \"Okay, how did you feel about him?\" He asked, I stayed quiet. \"Did you like him?\" He asked waiting for me to answer. \"October if you don't want to answer you don't have too but its best if you do.\" Cathy said patting my back gently. \"I just don't feel comfortable talking about him.\" I said. \"Why is that?\" Officer James pushed. \"He…he isn't…I don't know.\" I stopped talking. \"It's late.\" \"You're right.\" Cathy said standing. \"Let's go James.\" She began to walk out. \"October we will expect to see you tomorrow morning, around 10 at the station.\" She said. \"We do need to talk to you more. Bring your cousin if that would make you feel more comfortable.\" She said and smiled now. I nodded and watched them walk out. I heard Charles and Donnie say bye to them. I stood up and went to walk to my room. \"Where do you think you're going?\" I heard Charles ask. \"To bed?\" I said confused. \"No sit down.\" He ordered and I listened. \"What in the hell makes you think you can come home at 2 in the morning?\" He asked. \"I lost track of time.\" I answered honestly. \"Where were you?\" He asked. \"I was…\" I started. \"I don't know what to call it.\" I said after thinking. \"So you went somewhere you don't know with some guy that could've taken advantage of you.\" He asked yelling. \"Don't even think about lying about anything.\" He said when I opened my mouth to speak. \"Whose jacket is that?\" he asked. I realized I was still wearing Mike's jacket. He needed it back. \"It's Mike's.\" I said. \"Mike? Mike Winchell?\" I nodded. \"Why would you be messing around with him, everyone knows what those guys want.\" Donnie looked away. \"Yeah I am talking about you too.\" Charles looked at him. \"It wasn't like that.\" I said angry. \"It's not like I slept with him.\" \"I don't want to hear that, I don't want you seeing him anymore.\" Charles said \"I don't have to listen to you, you aren't my father.\" I said standing. \"No I am not but you are living here and you will listen to me.\" He yelled getting closer to me. \"I won't listen to you.\" I said and began to walk away. He grabbed my arm and pulled me back. \"I don't let my own son talk to me like that what makes you think I will let you.\" He said in my face, he squeezed my arm and tears filled my eyes. \"Dad leave her alone.\" Donnie said grabbing Charles and pulling him. \"Listen to me; you do what I say and when I say it.\" He said finally letting me go. I almost fell to the floor completely but Donnie grabbed my arm. \"Come on.\" He whispered softly walking me to my room. I sat on my bed. \"Don't worry about that, he just had a little to drink and jut panicked with the police.\" Donnie said sitting next to me. I nodded and lay down. \"Are you okay?\" He asked moving closer to me. I nodded my head. \"Did you have a good time tonight?\" He asked trying to sound happy. \"Yeah I did.\" I answered taking off my shoes. \"That's good.\" He said smiling. \"Mike loves that jacket, so you should probably give it back tomorrow.\" He said. \"He said its real warm.\" He pointed to the inside of the jacket lined with sheep skin. I nodded. \"Thanks for helping me.\" I said. \"I am tired though.\" He nodded and walked out shutting the door. I got under my blanket without taking off the jacket or any of my clothes. My arm hurt a lot but I didn't want to look at it. I closed my eyes and I could smell Mike. I smiled to myself. I was glad I had his jacket. The next morning I woke up before Donnie and Charles. I decided to take a shower when I got out I looked at my arm. It felt a lot worse than it really looked. It was bruised but not badly, just a little blue and black. I put on a shirt that has sleeves to cover it, they were still short but long enough. I went outside of my usual run and took Mike's jacket. I had run past his house before so I figured I would drop it off. I stopped in front of his house, his truck in the driveway. I walked up the path and knocked on the door. I hoped it wasn't too early. When I left it was 8 so it must've been 8:30 by now. I remembered that I needed to go to the police station. I didn't want too. The door opened and a woman was standing there. She starred at me. \"How can I help you?\" She asked and began to open the screen door. \"I just wanted to-\" I started. \"Mom go back to your room.\" Mike appeared suddenly. \"You don't know who it could've been.\" He said as she turned and walked away. He opened the screen door and stepped outside closing the door. \"What are you doing here?\" He asked seeming upset. \"I just wanted to give you your jacket.\" I said holding it up. He nodded. \"Thanks but it could've waited. How did you figure out where I live?\" He asked. \"I run past here in the morning and noticed your truck before so I figured it was where you lived.\" I explained. \"Ok but you can't just come around here.\" He said firmly. \"Just don't do it again ok? I don't like people just coming.\" \"Sorry I didn't think it was a big deal,\" I said. \"Don't worry about it.\" He said. \"What happened last night with that police car?\" \"It's a long story…\" I said, he looked confused. \"Well they want to ask me questions about my mom and I need to go to the station but its far.\" I said. \"I can't ask Donnie to take me because you guys have practice so I don't know what I am going to do.\" I said. \"I can take you, I am sure you don't want to go alone anyway.\" He said. \"No, you will miss practice.\" I said. \"I don't want to get you in trouble.\" \"Hey don't worry about it; I have never missed practice before. Missing once isn't going to kill anyone.\" Mike said. \"Where do you have to go anyway?\" he asked. \"It's about an hour away.\" I answered. \"Well let me change and then I will drive you down there ok?\" he said and I nodded. \"Come inside.\" He opened the door. \"Just stay here.\" He said motioning to the couch.[Chapter 9] Soon we were driving the hour to the station. I couldn't go to the Odessa station which would've been easy. We walked in and both of us were uncomfortable. We sat down and waited for me to be called in. Suddenly an Officer walked out. \"October Billingsley?\" he called. I stood up. \"You want me to go with you?\" Mike asked. I nodded; he stood up and grabbed my hand as we through the doorway. I walked into the small room; there was a table with four chairs, two on each side. I sat in one chair and Mike next to me. Cathy walked in and sat across from me smiling. \"Its nice to see you again.\" She said brightly. The officer walked in. \"Hi, my name is William but you can call me Bill.\" He said sitting on the other side of the table. \"Miss Billingsley, is your father Charles Billingsley?\" He asked taking out a tape recorder. \"No, he is my uncle.\" I answered. \"Isn't that lucky, he has a son on the Permian Panthers right?\" I nodded. \"They are a hell of a team.\" He said. \"Yeah they are good.\" I said. \"Who are you?\" he asked looking at Mike. \"You look familiar.\" He said. \"Winchell, Mike Winchell.\" Mike answered firmly. \"I knew it, quarterback right?\" Mike nodded. \"What a lucky girl.\" He said looking at me. \"Now back to business.\" He put a tape in the recorder. \"Everything you say will be recorded and stored for evidence.\" He said. I nodded. He began to ask the same questions I answered from the night before. He finally got to whether or not I liked David. \"Now how do you feel about him?\" He asked and I didn't answer. My body tensed up and I felt Mike squeeze my hand gently to let me know he was there. \"He wasn't very nice.\" I said. \"What do you mean? How did he treat you?\" Bill asked. \"Well he was always yelling and throwing things, violent I guess.\" I answered. \"Did he ever touch you physically or sexually at all?\" Bill asked. \"Is that needed?\" Cathy interrupted. \"Well I need to know because David's story about October is the same as hers with him.\" He answered. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. David pulled out a pad. \"He said you were violent to him, always yelling. He said you were always trying to get with him, said you were jealous of the relationship him and your mom had.\" I felt sick. \"He thinks you killed her.\" He said bluntly \"What? Why would I kill my mom?\" I asked angry. \"That's what we are trying to figure out.\" He said. \"You showed no remorse when she died, you didn't seem upset or anything. That's a little suspicious for someone who just lost their mom.\" He said. \"How was I supposed to act?\" I yelled. \"She didn't care about me; she didn't do anything to help me. She acted like I didn't exist. She chose David over me, she didn't love me. Why should I be sad about her dying?\" I asked angrily. \"Relax October.\" Cathy said. \"She knew what was going on, she knew all along and never did anything.\" My eyes began to water. \"She didn't stop it, her solution was moving. Look what happened with that, she died.\" I was crying now. \"Relax babe.\" I heard Mikes voice say. \"Calm down.\" He was rubbing my back gently. \"What do you mean she chose him over you?\" Bill asked. \"David, it was David. She loved him more.\" I said \"He seemed so nice when we met him.\" I stopped crying. \"He bought me clothes, took me out. One day my mom gets home completely drunk so we have to carry her to bed. We leave her there and he starts talking to me.\" My eyes began to water and stopped talking. \"Keep going.\" Cathy said \"He was just saying how I was nice and pretty and I thought it was fine. I was 14, what was I supposed to know? And when it got late I went to bed…he insisted on going with me…I told him no.\" I started to cry again. \"I told him to stop but he didn't listen.\" \"Are you saying David raped you?\" Bill asked. I nodded. \"You need to answer.\" \"Yes he did and when I told my mom she didn't believe me. So it happened again and again. Finally she figured I wasn't lying anymore so we moved to get away from him.\" I wiped my cheeks. \"But he found where we lived and came down here. She couldn't take it, she began doing drugs and drinking. Lost her job and everything.\" I said. \"When she told him she had been selling herself he was so angry.\" I stopped again. \"What happened after that?\" Bill asked. \"You need to tell us what happened.\" \"He got angry really angry, he hit her a couple times and then left. A week later she was dead.\" I said. \"I don't know if it was him, I really don't but I believe he did it. No one else would've.\" \"Okay.\" Bill looked at me. \"Now are you sure everything you have said here is the whole truth and you didn't lie about any of it?\" He asked. \"It's the truth, all of it. That's how it happened.\" I said. \"You swear that's the truth to the best of your knowledge?\" He asked. \"Yes it is.\" I said. He turned off the tape recorder. \"Okay, you both can leave now. We will contact you if anything further is needed.\" He said standing. Mike and I both stood and walked out together. He was silent. I didn't know if he was scared or shocked. I just hoped none of it would affect our relationship, if that's what it was at this point. We drove in silence, Mike held my hand the whole time though and it was nice. It was a way of showing that he was still there. We drove straight to the stadium so he could go to practice. We pulled into the parking lot. \"Can I ask you something?\" he asked as we began walking. I nodded. \"What would you consider me?\" He asked. \"What do you mean?\" I asked confused. \"People have been saying that you're my girlfriend and I didn't exactly ask you and it was never brought up.\" He said. \"What did you say when you heard that?\" I asked. \"Nothing but I wished it was true.\" He said looking down. \"It can be if you want.\" I said moving close to him. \"I do, will you?\" He asked. I nodded smiling. \"Good.\" He said pulled me closer to him by my arm. I instantly pulled away from him with pain. \"What's wrong?\" He asked confused. \"No nothing I just…I have a bruise there.\" I said rubbing my arm. \"What happened?\" He asked pulling up my sleeve. \"You didn't have that last night.\" He said. We walked into the stadium and Charles was already there yelling at Donnie for dropping the ball. \"It doesn't matter.\" I said looking at Mike. \"Did he? \" He asked looking at Charlie. \"Just forget it, he was drunk and it was an accident.\" I said. \"No, no he won't do that to you. You didn't do anything.\" He said getting louder and walking faster. \"Mike don't do anything.\" I said grabbing his arm. \"Don't.\" \"No, It doesn't work like that.\" He pulled away and I couldn't stop him. I called out his name but he didn't listen. He got between Donnie and Charles and began yelling. Charles was drunk and started yelling back. I slowly began to walk over. When unexpectedly Charles pushed Mike and that set Mike off. Mike shoved him hard causing him to fall to the ground.[Chapter 10] I ran over and grabbed Mike by his arm and tired pulling him. He just shrugged me off quickly. I grabbed his arm again and pulled him away. I stood in front of him to stop him from walking again. \"Stop, don't do that.\" I said pushing him back. \"If you do that you are only proving to be just as bad as he is or even worse.\" I said patting his chest lightly. He nodded his head slowly and turned around. He began to walk away. \"Come on, you need to relax about all of this.\" I said. We sat at the benches. \"Its okay, don't worry about it anymore.\" I said grabbing his hand. \"I'm not exactly a child.\" He leaned over and kissed me, grabbing my face. He pulled away slowly still holding my face close to his. \"I'm sorry about all of that but just after listening about David and then Charles it's too much.\" He said as he let go but still held onto my hand. \"Don't worry.\" I said trying to reassure him. \"I just don't want you to get any more hurt than you already have been.\" He said softly. \"Don't worry about it Mikey.\" I said. \"I can handle anything this world can throw at me.\" \"I think that's what scares me.\" He said. \"What do you mean?\" I asked. \"You are so brave, after everything you've gone through and now you just deal with all of this.\" He said. \"It's amazing, you're amazing really.\" He said smiling. \"I think you might be giving me too must credit there.\" I said shrugging lightly. \"And your modest…\" He said shaking his head laughing. \"Well you're a bit amazing yourself Mike.\" I said smiling. \"Not compared to you.\" He said firmly. \"Why did you pick me?\" I asked. \"What?\" He looked at me confused. \"Me, from all the other girls like Melissa, why me?\" I asked because I had been wondering about it for a while. \"Because you're the first girl who didn't try to sleep with me when you met me, you didn't fall in love me because I play football and you're not too bad on the eyes either.\" He said smiling at the last reason. \"I think you're not so bad to look at either.\" I said smirking. \"Winchell, change now.\" Coach Gaines yelled from the other side. We looked up and saw Charles gone and the rest of the team watching us, along with the cheerleaders. I turned red hoping they hadn't heard everything we said. \"Gosh that's slightly embarrassing.\" I said. \"Don't worry, it could be worse.\" He said and kissed my cheek. \"You know that.\" He said walking away. I watched the football practice in silence. I began to think about everything, David, Charles, Donnie, and Mike. I began to think about my father also. I was grateful that I ended up in the middle of Odessa with Donnie because despite the things he did that I didn't agree with he was the closed thing I had to family. He was my only real family I had ever cared about. I just didn't understand a lot of things in my life and when Mike was around none of that seemed to matter. It was like none of it even existed any more. I was at peace. I cared about him so much. I had never really felt like that for anyone in my life and it scared me. If I didn't have Mike I wouldn't have anyone. I needed him more than he realized. I felt the bend shift slightly and noticed Melissa sitting on the other end. I just decided to ignore it. I was too deep in thought to worry about her now anyway. After practice I was walking out the stadium to wait for Donnie and Mike. I noticed Melissa standing alone. I didn't want anything to do with her so I stood a couple feet away from her. \"I am not going to bite you.\" She said looking at me annoyed. \"Yeah right.\" I said barely loud enough for her to hear. \"Look just because you have Mike doesn't mean anything, take him.\" She said snorting \"He's a big momma's boy anyway.\" She said shrugging. \"Too much for me to handle.\" \"That's convenient now.\" I said rolling my eyes. \"He is so weird about her; he never lets anyone go to his house.\" She stated. \"I don't care about any of that.\" I said. \"Yeah you don't now but what are you going to do a week from now, a month, a year, who knows?\" She said looking at me now. \"I actually feel sorry for you. You are too attached to him already.\" \"Don't worry, I don't really need your sympathy.\" I said annoyed. \"If I was you I would just try to not get so involved with him, he would never chose anyone over her.\" She said just as Donnie and Mike walked out. \"Hey there.\" Donnie said looking at Melissa. \"Why are you here?\" He asked smirking. \"Maria wanted me to tell you she was sick, from last night.\" She said smiling. \"Oh that sucks, let's go somewhere.\" He said to her. She shrugged and they began to walk away. He placed his arm around her shoulders. \"Hey Tobe don't get home too late.\" He said looking at me. I nodded annoyed. \"So what do you want to do?\" Mike asked looking at me as we started walking. \"Kill him.\" I said starring at Donnie as he walked away. \"What did he do?\" Mike asked confused. I looked at him like it was obvious. \"You mean Melissa?\" I nodded. \"That's Don's business.\" He said. \"Well its wrong, Maria likes him so much.\" I said. \"Yeah and she always has. She knows how he is.\" He said simply. I got into the truck and didn't say anything. Mike began driving. \"Are you really upset about that?\" He asked when I hadn't said anything for 10 minutes. \"Just because she knows doesn't mean its okay.\" I said angrily. \"Hey I know what're you are saying but it-\" \"It's not right to just sleep with people like that.\" I cut him off. \"Hey relax there killer.\" He said stopping the truck. \"Everyone knows what Don does, Maria has known since she met him. I know its wrong but what can I do? Don does what he wants and Maria lets him.\" He said. \"What do you mean Maria lets him?\" I asked confused. \"Maria and Don have been on and off again for like 5 years already. She lets him do it. If she honestly told him to stop I think he would.\" Mike said and began driving again. \"Despite what he says he really cares about her, she is the only girl to ever put up with his dad.\" \"Yeah I noticed that.\" I said remembering the duct tape issue from the other night. \"I want to take you somewhere.\" He said as he turned off the dusty road.[Chapter 11] After an hour or so of driving we finally stopped at what seemed to be an opening at a forest. We got out and Mike grabbed onto me and we began walking. After walking for what seemed like forever I was tired. \"How much further?\" I asked for the 5th time. \"For someone who runs in the morning you sure are lazy.\" He said stopping and smiling. \"Don't call me lazy.\" I said, \"We have been walking for…like-\" \"It's been 23 minutes exactly.\" He said looking at his watch. \"We could run?\" He said. \"No running.\" I said. \"Come on, you walk slow.\" I said grabbing him and walking faster. \"I walk slowly? You are one crazy lady.\" He said smiling. After another 7 minutes we finally stopped. We were in front of what was a little pond. It was beautiful, like something that would be out of a fairy tale. The water was clear and the glass soft as cotton. \"How did you find this place?\" I asked. \"When I was little I ran away and came here.\" He said sitting down. \"I went back home of course but I never forgot about it.\" He said. \"You can't forget something when it's this perfect.\" \"How did you get here, it's so far from Odessa ?\" I asked. \"I ran and when I got tired I walked. My dad wanted to kill me when I got back; I was gone for two days.\" He said and began to take off his shirt. \"What are you doing?\" I asked surprised by his action. \"Its hot, I just walked all the way here and besides I don't want to get my clothes wet.\" He said standing and began to undo his belt. \"Wait, wait, wait\" I said stopping him. \"I don't think it's a good idea.\" \"Its just water.\" He said confused. \"It's not going to hurt anyone. I've done it before.\" \"Okay but do you have to take your pants off?\" I asked. He smiled. \"I see that's what this is about.\" He took a step away. \"How about I get undressed over here and you over there.\" He pointed to the other side. \"I never said I was getting undressed.\" I said shaking my head. \"Well you can get in with your clothes then.\" He said shrugging. \"I'm not going in.\" I said crossing my arms. \"We walked all the way out here and you aren't going to get in the cool crisp clear water?\" He asked. \"It is hot out here.\" He said smirking. I thought about it. \"Maybe, you can get in first.\" I said unsure. \"Fine but you are missing out on a lot.\" He said. He continued to take off his pants. \"You better not watch me.\" He said joking. \"Not funny.\" I said from where I had sat. He just shrugged and walked in. \"Is it cold?\" \"No it's perfect. You should join me, it would be better.\" He said. \"Come on, its just water.\" He said begging. \"I don't even like water.\" I said. \"You don't like water?\" He shook his head. \"It feels nice.\" He said and went under. I jumped up and looked into the water. \"Don't do that.\" I said once he came back up. \"It worries me.\" \"You really don't like water, do you?\" He said wiping his eyes. \"It's okay.\" I said. \"I just…can't swim.\" I said sitting back down. \"Come on, I won't let anything happen.\" I didn't move. \"Trust me.\" He said sincerely. \"Fine but if anything happens I will kill you.\" I said standing. \"Turn around, don't look at me.\" I said \"Fine.\" He said dramatically and turned. \"You better stay facing that way, I mean it.\" I said and he nodded. I took off my pants my first and then my shirt. I didn't want to get my bra wet, I thought about it. I was going to be in the water. I took it off. I began to walk. \"Don't turn around yet.\" I said when he went to turn. I was in all the way. \"Okay.\" I said. He turned and looked at me, he was smiling. \"See was that hard?\" He asked moving closer to me. He wrapped his arms around me bringing my closer. \"Just relax.\" He instructed. I tried but it was hard. I was worried about something happening. \"I can't believe you never learned to swim.\" He said. \"It's not like I needed too.\" I said. \"Isn't Chicago next to a river?\" He asked. \"A lake actually but there is a river.\" I said. \"Thats not the point I don't like sand, so I don't go to the beach.\" \"I want to go to the beach someday.\" He said. \"It's not as fun as it looks in the movies.\" I said. \"I'll take you though, promise.\" I said kissing him. \"Thanks.\" He said kissing my neck. I wrapped my arms around him bringing out bodies closer. I felt his bare skin against mine and it was cold. I placed my head on his shoulder. He began rubbing my arm. \"Why did you let him do that?\" He asked softly. \"What was I supposed to do?\" I asked. \"Donnie tried to stop him but he was so angry, I've never seen someone that angry before.\" I said. \"Except David.\" \"Why was he angry?\" He asked running his hand along my back. \"He was drunk and I got home late.\" I said. \"So it was because of me?\" He asked. \"No, Nothing is your fault.\" I said kissing his shoulder softly. It began to get dark and the water began to turn cold. \"I think its time to go.\" He said. \"Come on, I won't look.\" He said grabbing my hand. I followed him out the water and got dressed quickly. It wasn't really cold but we were both wet so it was just worse. We walked slowly back to the truck in silence because there was nothing to say. We got in the truck finally. \"It's freezing.\" He said shaking and turned on the heat. \"I thought I would never have to use that in Texas .\" He said. \"You should try being in Chicago .\" I said. \"That's being cold for real.\" \"I guess.\" He said and started the truck. \"Its only 9, you want to go home now?\" He asked. I shook my head. \"Well we can wait here for a while.\" He said. \"What is there to do here?\" I asked. He smiled and leaned over kissing me hard. He felt so warm compared to me and I wanted to get closer. I kissed him deeper and pulled him over me. He pulled away breathing hard, \"If that's what you want fine.\" He said kissing me again while smirking. I felt his fingers trailing my sides. He reached under my shirt and I froze up. \"Are you okay?\" He asked stopping and looking at me. \"Yeah…just…not that now.\" I said. \"Not yet,\" I whispered. He nodded. \"Don't worry.\" He said moving his hand. He leaned in and kissed me again. There was a tapping sound on the window causing us both to jump. We looked at the window to see they had begun to fog up. I smiled. \"That's not good.\" He said sitting up. He rolled down his window. \"Hey officer.\" He said quietly. \"It's a little late, shouldn't you be heading home?\" He asked. \"It's past curfew.\" \"Curfew is 11.\" Mike said confused. \"Not here its not.\" He said. \"Its 9, I should take you two in and call your parents but I won't.\" He said looking from Mike to me. \"Good luck on Friday, we don't need a quarterback with a record.\" He said smiling. \"Get home safely kids.\" He said walking away. \"That was close.\" I said. Mike started the truck without saying anything and we began to drive. \"Are you okay?\" I asked because of he still had remained silent. \"I just wish for once I wasn't a quarterback.\" He said. \"It's so…old. I don't know. I don't want to be that, everyone expects me to win.\" He said. \"Everyone wants me to be their hero. What if I can't?\" He said shaking his head. \"Mike don't worry about it.\" I said patting his hand softly. \"I just don't feel like playing anymore.\" He said starring in front of him. \"Sometimes I hate it and that scares me.\" \"Well why do you still play?\" I asked confused. \"I want out of here, out of Odessa. Out of this whole place.\" He took a deep breath. \"Football is the only way to ever get out.\" He said. \"I won't get stuck here like Don's father.\" He said. \"Don't worry, you'll get out with or without football.\" I said. \"I believe in you Mike Wenchell. I really do.\" He turned and looked at me. He didn't say anything because he didn't need to. I could tell he was happy by what I said. And He knew I didn't just say it because I was supposed to. He knew that I really meant it.[Chapter 12] When I got home both Donnie and Charles were asleep. I was grateful. I went to my room and fell asleep instantly. I just felt tired and wore down suddenly. The next morning I woke up and the house was empty. I made breakfast for myself. I was eating then the front door opened and Maria came in. \"Hey, is Don here?\" She asked looking around the room unsure. I shook my head. \"Oh okay.\" She said still standing there. \"Is everything okay?\" I asked unsure. \"No I'm fine.\" She shrugged. \"Do you mind if I sit?\" She asked. \"Go ahead.\" I said moving over slightly on the couch. \"Are you sure you're okay?\" \"Do you know if anything is going on with Don and Melissa?\" She asked. I felt my head begin to spin and I suddenly felt sick. \"I don't know anything.\" I said. \"I'm not stupid.\" She said standing up raising her voice. She was yelling at me, just the situation. \"I know what Don does, I mean...everyone does!\" She began to shake to her head. \"He promised me it would be different this time. He promised and I listened to everything he said...just like a little school girl.\" She sat next to me. Her eyes were watering and he make up began to run. \"I'm sorry Maria.\" I said unsure of what I was supposed to exactly. \"Why? Is it your fault?\" She took a deep breath and slouched back into the couch. \"Do you know how shitty it feels to have Chavo call me and tell me about it?\" She said looking at me. \"What do you mean?\" I asked confused now. \"Melissa was supposed to be my friend, not my best friend but at least my friend. I know she's slut, she's slept with every guy on the team.\" \"Every?\" I asked but she didn't hear. She continued to go on. \"And to have Don's friend call me to let me know that she was having sex with him when I was sick. What kind of person does that?\" She said shaking her head. \"And she hates, she hates you so much.\" She locked eyes with me now. \"She has no reason to hate you. You've never done anything to her or to me or to anyone. You haven't even slept with Mike yet...so I don't see what the big deal is.\" \"What?\" I asked more confused about how she knew my private business. \"It's not like its a bad thing. Its a good thing.\" She said. \"Mike cares about you so he doesn't let the guys talk shit...and Don gets pissed at it too but whatever. No one cares what he says anyway.\" She stood up. \"I'm sorry for bothering you.\" She walked over to the door. \"The next time you see Don just let him know that I'm done with him, for real this time.\" She said before walking out the door. The screen door slammed behind her and I heard her car start. I sat in shock. I couldn't believe everything she had just told me. Everything she admitted. She just let it all come out suddenly. I wasn't feeling to good. I decided to go for a walk to calm my nerves and think about everything. I guess I wasn't thinking so much...or maybe too much. Soon I found myself outside the stadium just as practice was ending the guys were slowly walking out. They were tired and worn down. They weren't looking forward to the next game, only four days away. They were all stressed and scared that without Boobie they were going to lose. And according to Mike, they were going to lose. I stood against the gate and soon saw Chavo, Mike, and Donnie all walking out together. \"Hey look it's Mikey's little girlfriend.\" Chavo said in a baby voice. \"Are you jealous?\" I asked joking. \"Besides I came here to talk to Donnie.\" I said. \"Oh incest...gross.\" Chavo said walking off laughing. \"What an idiot.\" Mike said. \"Well I'll see you both tomorrow at school then?\" He said looking at me unsure. I nodded. \"Bye.\" He said before walking off. \"Where is your father?\" I asked as we began to walk to his car. \"Drunk.\" Donnie said. \"What's up Tobe?\" He asked. \"Maria came to the house today.\" I said. He stopped walking and turned to face me. \"She wasn't too happy.\" \"Well what did you tell her?\" He asked annoyed. \"I didn't tell her anything.\" I said and his face looked relieved. \"Some one else did.\" I added barely loud enough for him to hear. \"What?\" He said taking a step closer to me. \"What happened?\" He asked seeming worried now. \"She said for me to tell you that she is 'done with you for real this time.' and that was it.\" I said shrugging and trying to act like nothing big happened. \"I can't believe this.\" Donnie said before climbing into the car. \"Well did she say why?\" He asked once we were on the road. \"She said she isn't stupid, she knows how you are. But she also said you promised it was different and when she heard about Melissa...well she was done.\" I said shrugging. \"There is only so much you can do to one person before they really give up Donnie.\" I said looking at him seriously now. \"You think I don't know that?\" He asked once we pulled into the driveway. \"I don't even care.\" He said slamming the car door shut. He lied. I could tell. He did care. He cared a lot. He was hurting but like he always did he pretended like everything was okay. He was going to act like Maria was just another girl he slept with when she was more and they both knew it. And there wasn't anything I could do about it. I wasn't going to let it bother me though. I walked into the house and it was quiet. Really quiet. I didn't like it. I walked to my room and clothes were thrown around the room. I realized I hadn't seen where Donnie was when I walked in. I walked back out and saw Donnie and Charles sitting at the kitchen table. Standing behind them was David. I felt my breath get caught in my stomach. My lungs wouldn't work anymore. \"Hey there October, it's been a while.\" He said smiling. I could tell he was drunk, or maybe high. He lifted his hand up and he was holding a silver revolver. That explained why Donnie and Charles were completely quiet. \"What do you want?\" I asked feeling my voice shake. I wanted to sound strong but I couldn't do it. \"You know...you've always know.\" He said tossing the revolver between his hands. \"It's always been the same. Just you. Simple.\" \"I don't know what that means.\" I said feeling my heart speed up watching the gun. \"I told you before. You didn't listen so I had to prove.\" He said his voice suddenly sounding desperate. \"I told you I loved you and I wanted only you. Not your mother.\" He shrugged. \"That's why you killed her?\" I asked my eyes watering. \"Because of me?\" \"You knew it.\" He said taking a step closer to me. \"You never told the cops that though, did you?\" He smirked. \"I know it's cause you feel the same. And this new boy I've seen you with...he is nothing.\" \"You've been watching me?\" I asked my body shaking. I had never been so scared. \"Oh yeah, of course. The football kid right? He seems real sweet...to bad I'm going to have to show nothing can come between us.\" He shook his head. \"The same way I had to show your mama.\" \"No!\" I yelled looking straight into his eyes. \"You leave him alone.\" I said firmly. He walked quickly and was suddenly standing in front of me. He placed his hand on my cheek. \"Don't worry sweet pea. It'll be painless.\" He whispered. He kissed my cheek. I felt myself shudder under his touch. \"I'll see you around love.\" He said before storming out the house. I felt the cold air rush when he shut the door behind him. Donnie and Charles were both sitting in silence. They didn't know what to say to me. I felt a tear fall slowly down my cheek. Donnie suddenly stood up. He walked over to me. His arms wrapped around me. \"Don't worry about it.\" He said as I buried my head into his chest. I felt the tears coming out and they wouldn't stop. All I wanted was for me to disappear. I didn't want Donnie or Mike hurt. I didn't want even Charles to be hurt. It was all my fault. I didn't know what to do about it anymore.[Chapter 13] I'm so sorry this has taken so long to do. But I just started school a few weeks ago and I've had writers block but things seem to be flowing again. So please please please don't be angry! I promise to update sooner next time. I've just been soo busy with everything. Honestly. I won't let it happen again!! Please review! I woke up and looked at the time. I had to be in school but I wasn't planning on going. I had things to take care of, things that were more important than school. Donnie walked into my room. He forced a smile. \"Are you ready?\" He asked. \"I'm not going today.\" I said shrugging. \"What do you mean?\" He asked crossing his arms. \"You guys have a game Friday. A very important game and I won't take a chance on you guys losing because of something stupid David might do because of me.\" I said firmly. \"So where are you going?\" He asked confused. \"I'm going to the police station...and I'll be back tonight. Maybe.\" I said unsure. \"What about Mike?\" He asked. \"Did you tell him?\" \"Mike doesn't need to worry.\" I said. \"David won't really do anything to him. I know David.\" I said more than positive. \"So you're just leaving him?\" Donnie asked rolling his eyes. \"And you want to talk to me about Maria.\" \"It's not like that...and you know it.\" I said angry now. \"Mike cares about you a lot. He does. I don't know why this whole thing happened so fast...\" \"Donnie please don't do that.\" I said interrupting him. \"I know what I'm doing but there is nothing else to be done.\" I said firmly. \"Now just go to school and act like everything is okay.\" I said. I hugged him quickly. \"Thank you for everything you've done for me.\" He nodded slowly. He walked out and I watched him. Once he was completely gone I changed my clothes. I began to take everything out my drawers and I placed them carefully in my suit case. I couldn't believe I was leaving so suddenly. But I had to. Once all my things were put in I looked around. I knew I had everything but I still felt like I was missing something. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. I opened my eyes and looked around once more. I stood up and walked to the phone. I pulled out the card in my pocket. I dialed the number slowly. \"Hello?\" I heard a women's voice in the other end. \"Hello, It's me. October Billingsley.\" I said unsure. \"Oh hi, it's so good to hear from you.\" Cathy said. \"So is there anything you need?\" She asked. \"Yeah actually there is...\" I said unsure. \"I need a way to get to the Police station.\" I said. \"It's about David.\" \"What happened?\" She asked sounding worried. \"He came here...and well I just don't feel it's safe for me to be here and I don't feel it's safe for my uncle or cousin.\" I said being completely honest. \"Ok.\" She said quickly. \"I'm coming right now and I'll bring an officer with-\" The phone call ended. I wasn't sure if it was because she hung up or not. I placed the phone on the reciever and went back into my room. I grabbed my suitcases and placed them in the living room. I knew that Cathy would be there soon and I just wanted to leave. I walked back into my room and grabbed the envelop. I had written two letters, one to Donnie and the other to Mike. I needed them to know how much I cared. I walked into the kitchen and put them on the table. Suddenly I heard the door open. I turned and David was standing there. \"Going somewhere?\" He asked dropping my suitcases on the floor and glaring at me. \"David I don't know what to say to you anymore. I don't want anything to do with you. What you did to me...was wrong.\" I said. \"So please just leave me alone.\" I said trying to sound firm. \"No.\" David shrugged. \"I love you and just cause I'm not some high school quarter back doesn't mean you aren't going to love me.\" He said taking a step over to me. \"Now I want you to get in my car before I hurt you...or worse go hurt that insane mother of your little boyfriend.\" He said. I didn't move. \"I won't.\" I said my eyes began to water. \"I won't do what you say. I did before and I won't do it again.\" \"Fine.\" He said grabbing me. His grip on my arm sent a burning pain through my whole body. I tried to pull away but he only squeezed more. \"Lets go sugar.\" He said dragging me through the kitchen and into the living room. \"I tried to be nice.\" He said. We walked out the door. \"Let me go or I'll scream.\" I threatened. \"Go ahead, no one is here.\" He said. \"I looked around and not only that but I cut the phone lines.\" He smirked. He continued to drag me. \"Let go.\" I yelled. \"I mean it.\" I said trying my hardest to pull away. He suddenly slapped me across the face. I fell to the ground. He grabbed me again and I pulled away. He let me go and I fell onto the ground hitting my head on the cement. \"Are you going to relax now?\" he asked. I didn't move. My head hurt too much. \"Come on.\" He picked me up and placed me in his car. I looked out the window of the car as he walked back into the house. I opened the door and climbed out. As I stood up the pain from hitting the floor rushed into my head and I became dizzy. I stumbled but began to walk. I was going to get away from him. I sped up and began running. I heard yelling. I heard David yelling and another voice. I couldn't tell who it was. I heard a gun shot echo through the air. It pierced my ears. I heard another shot and suddenly my I couldn't run. I heard more yelling and then I fell. I looked and I saw Cathy along with a police officer. I saw David on the floor and then everything got dark. Mike walked out school and climbed into his truck. He started it just as Don came running out after him. \"Mike where you going?\" He asked. \"To your house to figure out the real reason October wasn't in school today.\" Mike answered. \"Mike she isn't there.\" Don said. \"What do you mean?\" Mike asked confused. \"She left.\" Don replied simply. \"She didn't want you to get involved with her problems. So she packed and left today in the morning. I don't think she is coming back.\" Don explained. \"That doesn't make sense.\" Mike said turning off the engine. \"Why would she leave without saying anything? Why would she leave to begin with?\" Mike asked. \"No thats wrong. She didn't leave.\" \"Mike, shes gone.\" Don said. \"Shes gone.\" Mike got out the car and slammed the door. \"Alright.\" He shrugged. \"Are you okay?\" Don asked unsure. \"If you want to talk about-\" \"Did I say that?\" Mike asked, Don shook his head. \"Alright then. I'll see you at practice.\" Mike said walking away slowly. He just wanted to walk to clear his head. He had to think about everything. He needed to figure out what really happened since he met October. Had all the feelings she claimed she had for him only been a lie?[Chapter 14] I sat up in the hospital bed adjusting my leg. I had been shot three weeks ago and today I was going to be able to go home. Although home wasn't really a place that existed really. When I decided to leave Odessa I was leaving and I wasn't going back. Cathy walked into the room smiling. \"Are you ready yet?\" She asked. \"Yeah.\" I said nodding. I moved my leg so it was hanging off the side of the bed. I grabbed the crutches and stood myself up. \"Do you want to stop by your uncles first?\" She asked. \"No they aren't home.\" I said looking at the clock. \"There's a football game tonight.\" I explained. She nodded. \"Do you want to stop and see the score?\" She asked unsure. \"You can go back. Don and Charles want you back.\" She explained. \"I know.\" I said walking towards the door. \"I decided to leave.\" I said. \"I know David is locked up and the chances of him getting out are so small but I can't take that risk. He is going to get out eventually.\" I stated. \"By the time he gets out October you're going to gone. He isn't going to care anymore.\" She stated. \"He made a plea with the jury.\" I said. \"In 15 years he gets to leave and go look for me.\" I said my eyes beginning to water. \"Look everything is going to be fine.\" She said. \"Ok but I still want to leave. I want to go back to Chicago.\" I stated. Cathy nodded. We drove to the field. The lights made the field the brightest place in all of Odessa. I walked up the gate and looked at the score. The Panthers were well ahead of the other team. I could see the number 20 flashing on the field. Running around doing the best he could. Being the best he could. I smiled watching him. I was going to miss Mike more than he realized it. The whistle blew and the team crowded around Coach Gaines, this mouth moved quickly and then they ran back onto the field. I turned and began to walk back to Cathy's car. I knew they were going to do good. Mike closed his eyes and rested his head against his pillow. He was more than tired. He was exhausted. Practice had worn him out and need to win every game was breaking down his spirit. All Mike wanted was to open his eyes and see October. It had been three weeks since she left and he didn't know where she or where she was going. Mike knew that's the way she wanted it. He wanted to respect her wishes but he needed her now. He opened his eyes and sat up quickly. He walked over to his dresser and opened the top drawer. He took out the envelop and opened it. He carefully unfolded the letter and reread it. The creases in the paper were beginning to get worse. Mike folded the letter when he was done and placed it back in the envelop and then back into the drawer. He sat back on his bed feeling slightly better. October was better now where ever it was she had disappeared to. He knew that. He also knew how much she cared about. Maybe even oved him. He wasn't sure. He just knew he had to get out of Odessa. He couldn't stay and become nothing. He needed to get out and find October again. She wasn't just going to come back and he knew that. There was a knock. Mike looked at the door and saw Don standing there. \"Hey there buddy.\" Don said walking in and sitting next to him. \"Whats going on?\" He asked his foot tapping the ground slightly. \"Nothing really.\" Mike answered unsure why Don was really there. \"Is there something wrong?\" He asked worried. \"Your Dad or October?\" He panicked slightly. \"No everything is fine. I think at least.\" Don said unsure. \"Well I haven't talked to her but I know shes fine. The crazy happy social services woman told me.\" Don said shuddering at remembering meeting Cathy. \"Thats good I guess.\" Mike shrugged. \"But are you here?\" Mike asked bluntly. \"I know October is fine.\" Don stated. \"I want to make sure you're fine too.\" Mike starred at him blankly. \"Well are you fine?\" Don asked. \"I'm good Don.\" Mike stated. \"I really am.\" Mike smiled. The sound of the final bell rang through the stadium and the Permian Panthers knew they lost the game. Carter High School beat them and there was nothing they could do to change that. The players on and off the field had uncontrollable tears flowing. The crowd that was supporting the Permian Panthers was feeling an overwhelming feeling of joy and sorrow. Their boys had failed. Their boys had lost. But they were anything other than losers. They all grew and changed over this football season and whether they received scholarships or not they were different. That moment replayed over and over in Mike's mind. He couldn't get it out. I looked down the street and crossed quickly. There was a group of kids playing football. They were playing for fun. One day football would become more than just fun to them and they would have to go through what Mike and Donnie went through. They would have to question the game they were raised to love. The football rolled off and thats when I saw him again. I wasn't expecting to. I was going to visit but when my eyes landed on him everything froze. He bent over and picked up the ball. He tossed it over to the boys. He knew what they would go through one day because he just went through it. Mike turned and Donnie and Chavo were standing waiting for him. I smiled seeing them standing waiting. It was like nothing changed. It was like everything was the same as before. I walked over quickly. Donnie spotted me first and his eyes widened. Mike and Chavo turned to see what he was looking at. \"Hey there boys, I heard there was a football game last week?\" I asked smiling at them. \"Well if you heard right you would know we lost.\" Chavo replied smirking at me. \"Yeah thats what I heard.\" I smiled. \"Hi October.\" Mike said his eyes locking with mine. \"We'll see you guys later.\" Donnie said grabbing Chavo and pulling him away. \"I didn't know you were going to be here.\" Mike stated. \"Back in Odessa that is.\" He clarified. \"Yeah well I wasn't going to come back.\" I stated. \"But then I remembered a certain promise I made to this guy I fell in love with.\" I said. \"What was that?\" He asked taking a step closer to me. \"That he would get out of here one day and get to see the beach.\" I shrugged. \"And since I'm living in Chicago now...they have beaches. I figured maybe you'd wanna see them sometime.\" I reasoned. \"I think that sounds like a wonderful idea.\" Mike stated. \"As long as you're there.\" \"I'll be there.\" I stated. Mike leaned down closing the space between us. His lips felt so perfectly against mine. I pulled back slowly. \"And for the record, I don't think you really lost that game Mike Winchell.\" Thanks for reading my story and all the reviews I got for it. Please let me know what you think of the ending. I know its kind of abrupt but there was nothing more to add to it. I think it was time for it to end but Please review still!

I don't remember that. I only recall a brief moment of weightlessness as I slowly passed out from the pain, but that's about it. Lying on the bed in the nurse's office two hours later, I wait for someone to fetch me. The nurse, a portly woman with cherry red hair and kind green eyes named Miss Fiona Underwood, gave me a pack of ice wrapped in a towel to put over my swollen eye. That was an hour ago when I finally woke up, so the ice is actually now a dripping, wet mess, but I continue holding it over my swollen eye anyway. It lessens the sting. Antsy and bored, I move in order to sit up on the stiff bed and my body screams out in protest, using my mouth to vocalize its pain as I gasp in shock at how much everything hurts. On instinct I lay back down, despite how uncomfortable the mattress seemed two seconds ago. The pain came from my lower back and my left side. My heart races erratically in my chest like it does after I finish running, but I know it's from the shock of the sudden sting and not an adrenaline rush. I want to go home. Closing my eyes to stop the sudden dizziness, I throw one leg over the side, swinging it back and forth. It looks like the only thing I can do without causing further pain to myself. Voices, muffled and indistinct, come from the other side of the door as I try to regain my breath. I don't know if they're talking about me or not, but there's an urgency in the quickly-spoken whispers. A few more minutes pass and nothing climactic occurs; I begin to gaze around the room, though this is not my first trip here. I've suffered through so many bodily injures doing track and soccer that the nurse and I are on a first name basis. Just then— Finally !—the door in front of me opens, and I stop swinging my foot as Vice Principal Woody (his name is just unfortunate) sticks his head in. His beady grey eyes stare at me (or rather, my injuries) in fascination before he clears his throat. \" Ahem! Follow me, Miss Baker,\" he says. Then he vanishes from the doorway. \"Oh no, I don't need any help at all, you ass,\" I grumble furiously under my breath. Wincing, I slowly begin the process of lowering myself to the stainless tile floor, ignoring my heart rate as it skyrockets once more and how my right ankle throbs on contact with the floor and how my vision slowly doubles…triples. I close my eyes for a brief moment and wait for the lightheadedness to vanish, then I head in the direction I saw the V.P. going, my gait more of a limp since apparently only one foot is remotely useful. It's not too difficult to figure out where everyone is considering the crowd of people in the Principal's office. Mr. Gaines, Mr. Woody, Principal Davies, and my guidance counselor, Miss Shay, all stand behind the big, mahogany desk. Their faces vary from concerned to nervous. On the other side of the desk: Janie, my mother, Sheriff Jefferson, and Nurse Fiona. Each adult talks loudly and tries to be heard over the other loudly talking adults, but the second I knock on the door frame to announce my arrival, a graveyard suddenly becomes more welcoming. Janie turns in her seat and looks at me, her brown eyes red from crying. Her face is dry now. In fact, the longer she looks at my face, the more I see her eyes flash with fury. Proving my point, her hands clench the ends of the arm rest of her chair, her fingertips turning red and actually shaking. She's an intimidating woman, and I have no doubt that she gave everyone in this room hell. \"Ah, Miss Clarabelle Baker,\" Principal Davies says, pushing his black-framed glasses further up his hawk-like nose. He gestures to the raggedy arm chair in front of him and beside my mother. I silently move past the Sheriff—he politely steps out of my way—and try to hide my prominent limp from the seven pairs of eyes watching my every move. I don't know which is more uncomfortable, this lousy excuse for a chair or the staring. A moment of silence ensues where everyone just looks at me. Then, Principal Davies begins speaking again. \"Miss Baker, I hope you realize the seriousness of this event. We do not take kindly to physical assault on school grounds. If you could please tell us who attacked you, I promise you that the proper actions will be taken immediately. Slouched in the chair, I fiddle my thumbs and stare down at the intricate woodwork of the desk. My heart pounds loudly in my ears—this time, because of adrenaline—and my stomach successfully loops itself into knots. The Sheriff misunderstands my silence for fear of snitching. \"Miss Baker,\" he comments stiffly, \"if you're concerned about the ramifications of turning in the culprit, then I must assure you that we won't allow further harm to come your way.\" \"They're right Clara,\" Miss Shay diverges, that smile I hate plastered on her skeleton face. She's so transparent it's disgusting. They all are. I struggle to keep myself from rolling my eyes to their faces, so I just continue to stare down. \"Clara, tell 'em what happened,\" Janie says in a low voice. Sighing, I finally look up, glancing at the face of each adult as if I'm afraid of the truth. Ha! The truth: God couldn't get me to spill the beans. Nothing would be done, they know it and I know it. \"I never saw his face,\" I whisper. Lie. I could delineate the scar right by the corner of his eye to what he was wearing, his height, approximate weight, and all other necessary physical descriptions. \"So it was a he?\" the Sheriff asks. His voice inquires for more information, but his eyes tell otherwise. \"You think I would let a girl do this to me?\" I point to my surely swollen and bruised (I refuse to look in a mirror yet) face. \"You never saw his face,\" Mr. Woody questions skeptically. \"How's that possible?\" I shrug, taking a slight pause to think of something. \"I panicked,\" I speak in impromptu. \"I didn't think to look closely.\" \"Many victims of assault usually aren't able to describe their attackers in such a dangerous and quick moment,\" Miss Fiona inputs quietly. \"It's quite common actually.\" God bless her. \"What were you even doing at Ratliff so early in the morning?\" Dickhead continues. God, he acts like I wanted this to happen, and if I could rewind, I'm pretty sure an accusation outlined his tone. I look him pointedly in the eyes but before I open my mouth, Janie snaps, \"Why the hell does it even matter? Focus on finding out who the hell laid their fucking hands on my daughter!\" \"Miss Baker, I'm going to have to ask you to lower your voice and calm down—\" Principal Davies begins. \" Calm down ?\" Just like that, the entire room is going at it again. I can't fathom why Janie even bothers; she should know better then to the think this school would actually care. Janie and I aren't of any importance to this damn town. We could catch fire right now and half the school wouldn't piss on us to save our lives. I look up and realize one person stands quietly instead of participating in the arguing. Mr. Gaines looks from my face, confusion written across his slack features, to the so-called adults. I look down to avoid eye contact, but I struggle to shake the look on his face out of my head. I'll have to get him alone and question him on what he knows. \"This is fucking ridiculous,\" Janie exclaims at last. Then she grabs my arm and practically pulls me out of the chair. It takes all the control in the world not to burst into hysterical sobbing. Instead, I grit my teeth and let her pull me to my feet, but I quickly remove myself from her tight grasp. She's so pissed she might yank me arm off without realizing it. \"Let's go, Clara.\" Outside in the main hallway an eerie silence claims the school as students sit in homeroom. Janie walks quickly ahead of me, her anger fueling her speed. I watch her, a sudden exhaustion claiming me at the thought of walking all the way to the front doors. My vision doubles again, and I lean against the wall, catching my breath and waiting for the kaleidoscope act to end. It doesn't. I see my vision begin to blacken at the corners. My lips try to form words to call out to my mother, but my tongues suddenly feels thick and swollen. I take a single step. I lose my balance and watch the tile floors suddenly rush up to meet me. I'm out before I hit the ground. o o o I was forced to spend the night at the hospital in Midland. My ankle turned out to be \"moderately\" sprained, so it was wrapped in ACE bandages before the nurse slid a protective brace over it. I have to keep the brace on for at least two weeks, but I should be practically healed in a little less than a month. Sprains are nothing new, but I listen raptly out of habit. As an athlete, I never know. I had severe bruising around my rib cage, but the doctor concluded that none of my ribs themselves seemed bruised or broken. My face is a little more…bad. My left eye is swollen and bruised, and splotchy bruising covers my lower jaw. My lower lip is split, but it stopped bleeding hours ago. Last, there is slight bruising on my knuckles from where I fought back. My mom, although extremely pissed, was still proud. She assumed that people could find my attacker based on his injuries, but I told her that I only got in a few lame hits that he could cover up with make-up anyway. She got mad at my pessimistic attitude and left for the cafeteria. When she brought me home this morning, I was glad that I had the weekend to mentally prepare myself for the onslaught I would undoubtedly face at school Monday morning. I had no question that a few—okay, a lot—of the students would laugh or say stupid shit, but I still couldn't pinpoint an exact amount. I did, however, choose to get one hurdle out the way. Better she hear it from me than someone else (which she surely would if I didn't tell her now). After I hang-up with her after school hours, I waited patiently in my bedroom for my best and only friend, LeAnn, who lives only five minutes from my house (walking). Our relationship is a funny story, because we originally hated each other. She was under the impression that I thought I'm better than everyone else because I got straight A's and played a strong center-forward (a position that most freshmen don't hold on the varsity team and a position that LeAnn had wanted). I just thought she was a bitch. But at the end of our ninth grade year, we both got kicked out of a game by our coach for fighting one another on the field, and we spent the last hour-and-a-half stuck on the school bus while our team got creamed by Midland. Somehow, screaming at each other, we reached a mutual understanding, and our friendship has slowly grown since. We're practically inseparable now. I'm lying on my back on my purple duvet-covered bed, my foot propped up on a college dictionary topped by a history textbook topped by a small pillow. A fresh bag of ice is wrapped in a hand towel and continues to de-swell my sprained ankle. Another bag of ice sits on my white nightstand while I let my face warm up. I feel better, but I'm pretty sure it has something to do with the pain relievers I took thirty minutes ago. Yep, I am all mellow. When the doorbell rings, I try to sit myself up more on the millions of pillows Janie put behind my back. My ribs, however, protest rudely, and I quickly resume my former position. I hear LeAnn make polite conversation with Janie before stomping up our stairs, her pace rushed. She throws herself into my room, her fair skin tomato red from exhaustion, and her ocean blue eyes wide in shock. \"I'll kill 'em,\" she whispers in a low voice. \"Lee,\" I moan, not wanting her to even go there. \"I'll fucking kill 'em,\" she states bluntly. \"No…that's too nice. First, I'll set 'em on fire, but I'll put 'em out before they die. Then, I'll pour vinegar all over their burns…and then I'll kill 'em.\" \"Did I ever tell you that you have a lovely personality?\" Her face remains impassive. She's a small girl; everything about her is small and delicate, making her a natural southern beauty. Brown freckles decorate her defined cheekbones, running across her small nose. Her fleshy pink lips are slightly parted, barely revealing two rows of perfectly white, straight teeth. Her heart-shaped face gives her an almost child-like look of innocence. She's only a few inches shorter than me, and I'm 5'6\". She has shoulder-length strawberry-blonde hair that always curls at the ends. She's toned and lean, curvy, but not too much. She walks slowly to my bed, sitting down on the edge by my knees and staring into my eyes. \"Janie says you don't recall what happened.\" I shrug. \"I don't recall much of anything about the incident really,\" I admit. Not an exact lie, because most of it is a blur. Just not who did it. LeAnn bites down gently on her lower lip, her eyes dropping to my twitchy fingers that clench and unclench the duvet. She looks back up at me. \"You're lyin' to me,\" she says gently. \"But I won't push anything because I'm just glad you're okay.\" She slides a slender hand into mine, squeezing tightly in reassurance. I look down at our intertwined fingers, our skin tones contrasting slightly, but not by much. \"Oh, I almost forgot!\" LeAnn releases my hand to dig around in her MAKE LOVE NOT WAR over-the-shoulder bag. She pulls out a manila envelope and hands it to me. \"Yesterday and today's homework from your classes,\" she tells me. \"The notes are in there too, but Clara the Genius probably won't need them.\" She grins at me, and I'm glad to see that she's lighting up around me now. I thank her before setting the envelope beside me. I'll get everything done over the weekend. I push my tongue against the inside of my cheek, wondering how best to approach my next question. \"Has anyone at school…err…said anything, you know, about…?\" I trail off while LeAnn sighs and looks out my bedroom window that encompasses Ratliff Stadium. She's quiet a moment, but without moving she finally says, \"Everyone heard the ambulance arrive on campus.\" I nod. That must've been not long after I passed out. \"And…?\" I probe. \"I think a few kids figured it was you simply based on the fact that you've never missed a day of school in your life.\" It's true. I've won Perfect Attendance since kindergarten, but it looks like my record is broken now. \"Did they say anything?\" She shrugs. \"A few people asked me what happened, but I just ignored them. I didn't want anything I might say to be used against you later.\" \"Oh…okay. Thanks, LeAnn.\" \"What are friends for?\" she asks, looking at me now. A faint smile plays across her lips, and I return it. She leaves a few minutes later, having to get home to help her mom with dinner. Suddenly exhausted, I grab the other ice pack and lay it over my eye. Dear Christ, how did I let this happen to me?[Chapter 2] CHAPTER TWO I listen to the silence of the library, my head resting against the spines of the Renaissance Era. Study Hall: my only reprieve from the torment of actually being around people. No one came up here. In fact, I would bet that 99.9% of the Permian Panther population didn't know we even had a library, let alone where the hell it is. It is my safety net from the outside world, and the one place I don't feel judged or hated. Staring at the shelves across from me, I gingerly reach for my guilty pleasure: Shakespeare's famous Romeo & Juliet . I lay the small, thin paperback on my lap, the spine worn from the millions of times I've opened and stretched its binding. I've never understood why the book meant so much to me. Quite frankly, I didn't care for Shakespeare or his plays, but after reading Romeo & Juliet freshman year in English, I became obsessed. Not with the tragic ending caused by a simple case of bad communication. No, I was in love with Romeo, or better yet, my Romeo. Because in the real world, he didn't exist, but I hope that he does. It's embarrassing really. But I blame it on my sexually-deprived being. It's not healthy, my thinking. But I can't help but envy Juliet, a mere child falling in love with someone so…breathtaking. It must be nice up there in Shakespeare's head…you know, until Juliet plunges the dagger into her breast. I imagine that scene going a thousand different directions except a double suicide. Flipping through the soft, brown pages, I find my favorite scene, reading softly to myself in the dull silence the balcony scene of the play. I didn't want to think about the homework load patiently waiting for me in my bag on the table. I didn't want to think about anything that reminded me of school, my bruises, or the fact that I feel utterly and completely alone. Clearly, I should've read something more depressing. Maybe Titus… Suddenly disgusted with my pitiful fantasies, I shove the frail play back onto the shelf and return to my bag, lying open from an earlier attempt at doing my homework, with my crutches tossed across the table. AP European history first because it'll take the longest considering I have to write a eight to ten page paper on cause and effect of the French Revolution, blah, blah. Grabbing my notebook and pen, I head to the appropriate section in the library with all of five sources. Great. Settling down, I get as comfortable as possible, my notebook settled in the crook of my lap. I grab the first book and flip through the index until I find what I'm looking for. I spend the next fifteen minutes as still as a statue save for my hand flying across my paper, jotting down names, dates, places, and events in chronological order, trying to embed everything I read in my mind so I really know it. I hear nothing but the scratching of the pen. Even my breathing seems silent, patient. Shame, I'm most relaxed surrounded by dead people and their stories. \" Ahem! \" I'm ashamed to say that I scream. Loudly. It was just that it was so quiet; I though I was the only living soul in the room. Even the librarian is gone (who I assume takes an extended lunch knowing that I'm the only one ever in the place in the afternoons). I guess I scare easier than I used to, but it makes no sense how I didn't hear anyone even come in. Knocking the books across the floor, my pen flies from my hands as I jump up, my instincts telling me to run. Suddenly my vision swims, and I suddenly see nothing. It's pitch black and suddenly I hear the soft voice in my ear, comforting me. \"Shhh, Clara, it's just me .\" \"Clara…?\" I feel sick. I can literally feel my fists shaking at my sides, clammy with nerves. Deep breathes, Clara. Get a hold of yourself . \"I'm fine,\" I hiss through tightly clenched teeth. Keeping my distance from whoever so rudely destroyed my mental safety net, I bend over to pick up my fallen materials. My side and ankle throb, reminding me that I'm not to make any sudden movements. Too little, too late . \"What?\" I finally ask, the single word coming out with more bite than I intended. \"Uhhh, I need help finding something.\" \"I don't work here,\" I snap loudly enough for them to hear, but I refuse to turn around. My bruises on my face suddenly seem to throb, as if to say, \" Don't forget about us .\" Don't worry, I didn't. \"Well, there's no one else here but you , so could you help me anyway?\" \"Christ,\" I hiss under my breath. I turn around, and I'm not surprised. \"Of course Don, you of all people would not have the slightest fucking clue how to work the damn Dewey Decimal System.\" \"Nice to see you too, Clara,\" he retorts sarcastically. I make a move to stand up using the shelves as support and I realize that this makes me look more crippled than the crutches would have. I move slowly to make sure there's not too much pressure on my injured foot. \"Excuse me but I believe you asked for my help. Do you want it ?\" He just looks at me, amused, before shaking his head slowly. Then he pulls a slip of paper out of his stonewashed pockets and reads, \"I'm supposed to get…an article about health.\" \"Newspaper?\" \"I guess.\" \"Well I need to know if you want my —\" \"Yes, Clara, a newspaper,\" he cuts off in an annoyed tone. I decide to bite my tongue and say as even-toned as I can, \"Newspapers are in the back.\" Besides, it's not completely his fault I'm a wreck. I blame it on really bad life choices. His heavy steps follow my limping gait into the room in the back of the library. It's where the newspapers, magazines, and copies of documents are archived. On a shelf against the wall, I pull out several stacks of the ODESSA AMERICAN and set them on the counter, trying to ignore how suddenly small the space around me feels. Tight and suffocating small, almost like the air has been sucked out of the room. I take another slow, wavering breath. When I turn around, Don is standing in the doorway, eyeing the piles. \"What the hell are those?\" \"Your articles,\" I reply snootily. He's still staring at the stacks as I slip past him and back into the main area. I return to my private space on the floor and I set to work on my homework. I work my way slowly through the paper. I don't know how much time passed; I'm so wrapped up in my studies, that when I hear a knock, I let out a gasp and jump what seems like a foot in the air. Again. Agitated, I shriek, \" What ?\" Don is standing, his fist still raised from knocking on the shelf. His light green eyes looked glazed over from a boredom-induced drug. Clearly, someone needed to get into a library more often. Or stay away from them; I wasn't sure. \"Just came over to say thanks,\" he says gruffly. He clears his throat, raising his article in appreciation before saying, \"Talk to ya later?\" \"Yeah, sure,\" I reply absentmindedly, already returning to Marie Antoinette and her tragic end. Ha, like us two beings from opposite solar-systems would ever talk again! This one conversation was purely forced and a work of chance. Don didn't say anything further, but his retreating footsteps alert me to his whereabouts as they drift further away. I hear the door slam, and once again I am alone. That was the first time I talked to Don Billingsly. / The next morning before school started, I sat on the collapsed wooden picnic table, sitting on the bench now only a few inches from the ground. I originally had my notebook open to study, but I couldn't focus as the main entrance slowly became busy and flooded with students milling about and waiting for the bell. Groups and cliques laughed and joked around, a majority of the football team and their Pepetts who, although not dressed up in their uniforms, stood out simply by the way they dominated everyone's attention, laughing the loudest and shitting on whoever happened to walk by who wasn't \"one of them\". I'm sad to say that even I looked at them every so often, but with the billowing laughter, they were kinda hard to ignore. Sighing, suddenly glad I was conspicuous tucked into a corner of the building, I looked down at my notebook where I had doodled on a clean sheet. I had been out of it, but looking at the sketch now, I felt slightly disturbed and even a bit frightened. I shut the notebook, my chest tight and my fingers shaking. I shove it in my bag along with my pencil, wishing I could scratch the image out of my mind. It suddenly became too hot, and I knew I needed to get inside. In the process of gathering my crutches under my arms, the lawn falls into a buzz, as if thousands of bees suddenly replaced the student population. I look up from trying to adjust my bag over my shoulders and my eyes immediately fall on the source of the whispers. Climbing out a beat-up Mustang is someone I've never seen before, a girl looking about my age. She seems tall (her legs are clearly long and toned) but with her four-inch heels on, I can't really tell. She has light olive-toned skin and ink-black hair as long as mine, but with strips of pink and red that scream, \" Look at me !\" I can't really see her facial features distinctly, but I can make-out her designer handbag and shades. If she had lived in Odessa all her life, she would fit in with half the female population at Permian. But there was also something different about her. Something about how she walked towards the stairs, sucking up all the attention without even glancing at anybody. I hated her already. It's nothing against her on a personal level, but it was obvious which crowd she would fall into. I gave it approximately two weeks before she was dumping milk over my head in the cafeteria. Wanting to get to class before the bell rang, I made my way slowly to the stairs as normalcy returned to the area. Wary of falling and busting my head open, I placed one crunch on the first stair, completely forgetting how the hell I got up yesterday. \"Here, let me help.\" \"Uh, no thanks, I've got it.\" Brian looks at me then up at the door that is my goal. He looks back at me and sighs. \"Sure is a lot of stairs. I would hate for you to fall or something.\" He grins at me, the teasing obvious. But Brian is different than the rest of his buddies simply because he's one of the few with a conscious. He's always been good to me even though we don't talk much, which is a shame really, because he was one of the few people I could stand. \"If it'll help you sleep at night,\" I say with a roll of my eyes. What I didn't say was how much I appreciated this, because getting up the stairs is a nightmare all on its own. I move the crutches to my right side, holding onto the lower handles with one hand. Brian wraps his muscled arm around my waist and I throw mine around the back of his neck, leaning gently into his side, cautious of my injuries. I pick up my foot, and we slowly work our way up the stairs, Brian being one-hundred percent patient with my snail-like pace. \"Hey Chavo, let the cripple go so we can watch her fall!\" I don't know who screamed it, but it suddenly seemed like the entire frown lawn erupted into laughter. My face burned and I suddenly felt sick. \"Just ignore them, Clara,\" Brian mutters gently. \"They're just assholes.\" \"But they're your friends, so what does that make you?\" I snap, humiliation fueling my anger at the one person who didn't deserve it right now. Brian is stunned into silence, and I inhale sharply as we reach the top. \"Thanks,\" I say under my breath as he steps away. I maneuver both crutches back under my arms, refusing any more help from Brian despite his offer to at least hold the door. I shouldn't be mad at him—a part of me realizes that. However, guilty by association, and Brian had some seriously bad associations. Not his fault, just the way it is. Inside, the building is cool and packed with freshmen, sophomores, and juniors who aren't worthy enough to be on the lawn with a majority of the seniors. They more or less ignore me as I make my way through the thick crowds, grumbling under my breath whenever I receive a shove and am pushed into someone. I just get out the thrall of the crowd when a thick hand falls on my shoulder, squeezing tightly enough so that I know to freeze. \"Come with me,\" Principal Davies orders. So I do.[Chapter 3] CHAPTER THREE Apparently, her name is Stasia Queen, and she's from Manhattan, New York. From far away I thought she would be pretentious, but she's so much more uppity close up. What's worse is that she doesn't do it on purpose, but I swear to God, if she squeals that one more thing is, \" soooo adorable\" I'm gonna hit her. It doesn't help that she's unbelievably gorgeous with her bright blue eyes, sharpened in the backdrop of her neutral make-up. She also happens to be 5'9\". She's practically a fucking model, so how the hell she wound up in the 5th worst place to live (thank you, Money Magazine , all of us in Odessa were so proud ) is a story I'm curious to hear. I can't fathom what the hell was running through Principal Davies head when he asked me to babysit her (not necessarily in those words) for the day so that she could learn her way around the school. You would think he would ask, oh, I dunno, the class president or Valedictorian or something. But no, he asked me, so here I was, glaring at Stasia while she tried to haggle with the lunchlady for something that didn't look like it had been squashed with a mallet. \"All I'm saying,\" she explains in a determined voice, her northern accent dripping from her tongue, \"is that you should offer a larger variety of food. I mean really, what person eats this load of garbage? Would you?\" \"Alright, Stasia,\" I say in a rushed voice, pushing her down the line where a huge gap had formed from where we stood to where we pay. \"What the hell?\" I hiss under my breath, glancing back at the Miss Wright who was growing purple in the face, eyes bulging out of her skeleton-like head. That'll come back to haunt me. Her face, that is. Christ, it just did. \"Do you always eat this crap,\" she says sticking her tongue out in disgust. \"I mean, can't we go off?\" Trying to shake Wright's face from my subconscious, I quickly answer. \"We can,\" I sigh, unable to lie because she'd find out eventually, \"but money is tight for a lot of people around here…\" \"Oh, okay.\" She said it like it was nothing, like it was something so easy to accept like it was gonna rain. I frowned but didn't push the subject. We paid for our food, and I began to lead Stasia to me and LeAnn's regular table in the back of the cafeteria. I had left one crutch with her (LeAnn) and had one under my arm so that I could balance my tray in my other hand. \"I'll introduce you to my best friend, LeAnn,\" I told Stasia as we began to move. Between my bruised, ugly face and her flawless beautiful one, we grabbed the attention of the entire room, whispers following in our wake. Self-conscious and wary, I ducked my head down, praying I didn't stumble and fall. I could see Stasia taking her newfound popularity in stride. \"Hey there,\" a voice speaks out from in front of us, \"you must be the new girl.\" \"Stasia Queen,\" Stasia says pleasantly enough. I look up between my lashes without moving my head. Maria Saunders, probably the most popular girl and the biggest whore after Melissa Tate. Maria, however, is the bitch behind a majority of my humiliation. She always finds some way to put me down since the ninth grade. I still don't know what I did to make her hate me so much. \"Welcome to Permian,\" Maria says brightly, flipping her dirty blonde locks over her shoulder and fluttering her stupid, slutty, long lashes. \"My name's Maria Saunders, and my friends and I would like to invite you have lunch with us. There are some people,\" she says looking pointedly at me than back at LeAnn, who is now standing, waiting for a fight or something, \"you just don't want to associate with.\" Stasia is silent a moment. \"I know what you mean,\" she says finally. I don't know why, but my chest aches at her words. I knew this would happen, but it hurts all the same. \"See, I knew we would get each other,\" Maria gushes. \"Yeah, because I would really hate to hang out with a total bitch like you.\" Once again, Stasia says it so plainly, but Maria's mouth falls open in shock and my head finally comes up in disbelief and little bit of respect. I couldn't even fathom calling Maria a 'bitch' simply because she has more resources to make my life a total hell (well, a bigger hell), besides, if it had been me she would just laugh in my face. Stasia's face remains impassive while Maria's quickly changes shades of red. \"Ex-fucking- scuse me,\" she gasps. \"You heard me,\" Stasia states plainly. \"Now where were we gonna sit, Clara?\" She struts away, leaving a pissed off Maria staring at me as if this is somehow my fault. I can't even shrink under her gaze, I'm too ecstatic. Slowly but surely, I follow after Stasia who already made her way towards LeAnn, probably figuring out our seating arrangement simply because of the way LeAnn was screaming my name. \"Relax, Lee,\" I assure her when I reach the table. \"Stasia put the nutsucker in her place.\" Stasia looks at me, confused, and LeAnn explain, \"It's our nickname for Maria because she gives so many blow-jobs a year.\" \"Oh.\" I sit down next to Stasia whereas LeAnn resumes her original seat across from us. \"Uh…Stasia, this is my best friend, LeAnn. LeAnn, this is Stasia, she's new.\" \"Nice to meet you.\" Stasia smiles, holding out her hand for LeAnn to shake, which she does. \"You too. What accent is that?\" \"Yorker,\" I explain. \"You're a yankee ,\" LeAnn asks, her voice dripping with a sudden disdain. Stasia immediately gets defensive, snatching her hand back and glaring at LeAnn with contempt. \"I'm not too fond of being surrounded by hicks, either.\" \" Tch , please. You should be honored Texas even wants you.\" Damn that Texas pride. It inflates our heads to the size of…well, Texas. \"Well,\" I interrupt quickly just as Stasia opens her mouth to retort, \"now that we've got introductions out of the way—\" \"Yo, Cuz, you gonna introduce me to your friend?\" A low growl escapes from somewhere low in my throat. \"What, James.\" Stasia looks from me to James (aka Bobbie, but I refuse to call anyone related to me a part of the female anatomy, even if it is spelled differently) and inquires, \"Are you two related?\" \"Unfortunately,\" I hiss. \"Can you leave?\" I ask my cousin. \"Not until I get a name,\" James says with a smile, moving to sit beside Stasia's other side. \"James Miles, but everyone calls me Boobie. Runningback on the football team and varsity ladie's man.\" I accidently spit out my milk before trying to hide my disbelieving laugh behind the back of my hand. God, my cousin is a cocky idiot, sometimes I'm actually embarrassed to share his DNA. Sometimes I wonder how James went from the sweet little boy who used to instruct me on the game of football when we were six to the conceited jock who hardly glances twice in my direction unless I have something he wants. I catch a glare from James from behind Stasia who had turned to face him, but I just ignore him. I look up at LeAnn and catch her gaze. She looks at my cousin then rolls her eyes. I totally agree. By the end of the day, my good leg is sore from carrying the brunt of the weight, again, and is begging for me to sit down and call it day. Stasia already left, her Mom arriving early. She tried to tempt me into introductions, but I opted out, complaining about the pain in my side from too much movement (not an exact lie). LeAnn had to stay behind in her English class to discuss a grade she received on a paper, so by the time she finished, I planned to be on my way home. This is me leaving. Slamming my locker shut, I shift my crutches so that both are under one arm, and then I try to pick my bookbag off the floor, which is more difficult than is sounds because bending my knees is turning out not to be such a good option for me. Wobbling forward, I tried to lift my bag by one strap when I almost toppled forward by the sudden weight of it, letting out a single gasp of panic as someone grabs me around the waist. \"Whoa…I gotcha.\" My heart pounding in my ears, the person gently rights me back up. The hallways are still flooded with kids exiting the building, and had the person not caught me, my senior year would've been down the shit pipe. \"Umm, thanks…Don?\" Having moved from behind me, bending over to pick up my bag, Don turns his head up to look at me, a slight grin on his face. \"Why, you are so welcome.\" He straightens, tugging my bag over one broad shoulder. \"I've got this,\" he adds when I reach for my bag. Right. I just nod, returning his grin with a tight-lipped and semi-uncomfortable-with-the-whole-situation \"grin\" before placing a crutch under each arm. I make my way slowly to the double doors that mark my escape with Don following along beside me at an equally slow pace and not seeming to mind it either. Feeling like I should say something, I blurt out, \"I'm sorry I was a bitch yesterday. It wasn't you, I was just having a really shitty day.\" \"Nah, it's cool. No offense taken.\" \"Oh, well, good then.\" We continue silently to my car, and the weight of the awkward silence makes my face burn. Like with Stasia, Don and I draw attention of the crowd, and I feel more self-conscious under each lingering and criticizing gaze. I can't wait for these damn bruises to heal so I can go back to being an ignored nobody. All this staring shit is unnerving. Then again, being caught walking with the \"new girl\" and the \"it\" guy of the school isn't helping my cause much either. When we finally reach my beat-up pick-up, I instruct Don to just toss the bag in the bag, which he does, and I follow up with my crutches. Opening my driver's side door, I turn to look at Don. I open my mouth but my words die on my tongue when I look at him looking at me with a really weird, intense look on his face. \"Uhhh…\" Don blinks. \"Yeah?\" \"I just wanted to say 'thanks' for helping me out,\" I tell him, as sincere as possible. \"I really appreciate it.\" Don just shrugs. \"It's nothing,\" he responds nonchalant. \"So…I'll see you around.\" It's my turn to shrug. \"I guess…\" I murmur half-heartedly. Don smiles and I'll honestly admit: it's a nice smile. Two rows of straight, white teeth as well as small crinkles at the corner of each eye. But there's something about it that put me on edge. Like a predator's smile. \"Let me rephrase…I really hope I see you 'round.\" My face heats up, my mouth opening and closing like a fish outta water. There is no mistaking the seductive undertone in his baritone voice. When I finally get my baring, Don's at least five feet away. \"Excuse me?\" Don stops and casually looks back over his shoulder. \"What?\" \"Don't ' what ' me,\" I snap indignantly. \"Where the hell do you get off trying to… flirt with me? Who the hell do you think I am?\" I'm hanging on to the bed of the truck, furious. My fingers press into the hot metal, the tips losing feeling in a matter of seconds. I'm so pissed, it's not even funny. I don't know guys well enough to know what exactly Don meant by his last comment, but I know me well enough to know that I didn't like the connotation that dripped off his voice when he said it. It sounded like he was trying to slip me a dirty phrase or something. Besides, he didn't mean it, he just said it the same reason guys asked me out freshman year, then turned to their buddies and laughed it out: I'm a fucking joke. Don frowns, turning slowly ninety degrees in confusion. \"I don't get what the hell you're talking 'bout. All I said was that I wanted to see you around again.\" I roll my eyes, scoffing loudly so he knows exactly what I think about his lame excuse. \"Don't bullshit me, Billingsly, your reputation precedes you. I don't know what kind of game you think you're playing here, but leave me the fuck out of it.\" I shoot him a glare as I climb inside my truck, the interior sweltering hot from being in the sun the entire school day. And as I pull out of the student parking lot, not once do I look back. I have no idea what kind of impact my words make on Don, but when he goes back to our usual relationship of ignoring one another, I figured they hit home. The words, that is.[Chapter 4] CHAPTER FOUR \"And we had to come to this stupid event, why ?\" I inquire, winded from the walk with only one crutch supporting me under my arm. We had to park all the way at the far corner of the school parking lot, and sadly the cafeteria is near the front. Had I realized the walk would be so dreadful on my ankle, I would've fought harder to stay home. \"To support your cousin. Remember, Sweetie, cousin is family in many cultures.\" \"I don't think I appreciate your tone.\" Janie smiled at me and just patted my back awkwardly. It was completely unfair that I was dragged kicking and screaming (metaphorically speaking of course) to one of the most mundane events in this God-forsaken town. Not only did it succeed in wasting my time, but it also gave ego boost to the one-hundred or so students who, honest-to-God, didn't need it. \"So, are you gonna drag James to one of my events in the near future?\" \"Clara, please, not now,\" Janie says through clenched teeth. Her brown eyes dart from one arriving family to the other, paranoid. She never did enjoy large gatherings simply because she had crowd issues: she's as popular in Odessa as a gay Yankee who hates football and takes the Lord's name in vain. I zip my lips, but I'm definitely not happy about being here. I used to be more supportive of my cousin. He had talent, that much was obvious, and I understood that he didn't have the academic stamina to make it any other way except football. However, when he started treating me like I was just another fan and he stopped showing support for me, well, we haven't gotten along since we were thirteen. The Watermelon Feed, a stupid event that just introduces the seasons football team. In all honesty, it was like a pre-season psych-up, because the official start of the season started in just two weeks, around the beginning of September. It was a major event, so naturally, I loath everything about it. Janie and I take a place near the back simply because we aren't in-tune very well with our fellow neighbors. I place my one crutch between my legs. Janie starts whistling the TV theme song to 'Dallas' while I scan the crowd. A few people get caught staring at my face, but when I catch their eyes, they looked away quickly. \"God, you would think these people would've seen a bruise before,\" I mutter under my breath. \"Just ignore them,\" Janie mutters uselessly. The seats fill quickly, families pouring into the Permian High cafeteria like ants at a picnic. They come wearing all black — (\"It's a football event, not a funeral,\" Janie noted with a roll of her eyes) — and grinning like it was Christmas. \"I can't wait for this to be over with,\" I sigh. Janie nods. \"Hey…Clara! Hey!\" Waving at me with ten times more enthusiasm than I can even muster at this point in life is Stasia. Ever since she practically defended me against Maria a few weeks ago, she's been hanging around with me and LeAnn, and it's not so bad. The girls still find things to disagree over, but they tend to keep quiet around me. I pat the empty seat next to me, and Stasia touches the arm of a tall, slender woman next to her before pointing to Janie and me. Stasia settles down comfortably next to me before turning back to the woman who I can only assume is her mother. They have the exact same builds, same eyes and facial features, the only huge difference is her mother's brunette hair, wrapped up in a ballerina bun. \"Mom, this is the girl I was telling you about, Clara Baker. Clara, this is my mother, Veronica Queen.\" I smile awkwardly past Stasia and at her mother, holding out my hand politely. I expect her to stare at my hand with disdain, sniff with contempt. That's what LeAnn's mother did. Instead, however, Miss Veronica Queen breaks into a wide, honest-to-God warm smile. She grabs my hand and lays her other one over out conjoined limbs. \"It is an honor to finally meet you, Miss Clara Baker,\" she says in a shockingly strong northern accent. \"Stasia talks so much about you, I feel like we've already met. You are so much prettier than Stasia gave you credit for.\" I feel myself blush, grinning. She has that kind of personality that a simple compliment like that could make you beam with pride, like her opinion is the only one that should get you through life, and no one else's matter. Stasia shoots her mother an irritated glare, but I much rather like Miss Queen. \"Oh, thanks,\" I giggle. Biting my lower lip, we release hands and I quickly introduce her to my mother. Stasia and Janie wind up switching spots so our mother's can talk. \"They really seem to like each other,\" I whisper, leaning in to Stasia so no one can overhear our conversation. I mean it though. The two women are talking animatedly about the Queen's move from New York, settling in, yadda, yadda. Quite frankly, I hope things work out between them. Maybe, if Janie has an actual friend in this place, she'll leave me alone and get a life. When the feeding finally starts (after prayer and a video of Permian's Proudest Panther Plays), I only half watch, my vision slipping into a boredom induced gaze that I bet mirrors Don's face when he came out from reading through all those papers. Janie is silent beside me, applauding politely and even letting out a \" whoo-hoo !\" when James is called up. The enthusiastic roaring of the audience becomes a loud buzzing in my ear, and I'm unable to hear a thing. Which is apparently why Stasia suddenly shakes me. \"Who is that?\" she screams in my ear when she realizes she has my attention. I follow her gaze to the front, not having been paying attention to who was up. I half expect Don to be up, but I'm shocked to see none other than Brian Chavez standing awkwardly on the \"stage\", his hands stuffed into the pockets of his dark jeans. With his charismatic, yet hesitant, grin and kind, brown eyes, I can see why Stasia would want him pointed out. \"Brian Chavez,\" I holler back. \"Do you know him?\" \"Not well,\" I admit. Stasia nods and falls silent. They rotate Brian for Ivory, and I like them both well enough to applaud briefly before laying my hands back in my lap. My leg bounces up and down impatiently, and the thought of them weeding through the entire football team makes my head hurt and my leg bounce faster. Janie doesn't turn her head at all, but her hand slams down on my knee, and I can feel her put all her strength into making me stop. I do for her sake, but at least she can't hear my nails tapping on the underside of the seat. Ivory walks off, replaced by Don. He's the first one to look remotely comfortable being ogled by the entire town like he's a piece of meat on auction—\" Do I have fifty? \"—but a second look reveals the same underlying fear created in the heat of nerves. The fear that they won't perform to the expectations of their coach, this town, or even themselves. Seeing that kind of fear in a seventeen year old almost makes me pity Don Billingsly and the rest of the football team. Almost. I don't mean to stare. But my thoughts are drowning me and I'm more focused on them than where I'm looking. I can't fathom how he felt my eyes on him in this sea of people, but Don's sharp green eyes find my hazel ones, and when I realize he's looking back, I blink to \"wake-up\" than again when I realize he's still looking at me. I keep expecting him to do something. But all he does is just hold my gaze to the point that I start fidgeting in my seat uncomfortably. I want to look away, I honestly do, but there's something in his eyes that holds my attention. I swallow nervously, not used to having the attention of a guy for so long. Why the hell hasn't he been called off yet? Were the other guys up there this long? I can't take it. The intensity of his gaze mixed with the screams of the audience and the building heat of the room makes me feel clammy and sick. I practically jump out of my chair as if it electrocuted me, and I look down, breaking eye contact with Don. Apologizing profusely for jamming myself into people, I scoot through the tight space, ignoring the dirty looks. The space where I should be able to walk freely is teeming by more people straining to see, with children on shoulders and adults on their tip-toes. I push my way through, but I stop excusing myself when I realize no one is giving me the time of day. When I finally reach the door, curiosity makes me look back, but Don has already walked off. Feeling stupid and insecure, I push open the door and walk into the deserted hallway, the noise not much quieter despite the thick walls. But at least there's space and air. Walking a few steps away from the doors, I lean against the wall, suddenly wishing that I had both crutches because my legs won't support me, and one crutch doesn't hold dead weight very well. Sliding down, I sit on the cool floor and put my forehead on my knees just as the doors I just exited open up again. \"Hey, there you are,\" Stasia says. I look up, seeing her with LeAnn trailing behind her. \"Yes, here I am,\" I sigh. I look at Lee and ask, \"Where were you?\" \"My parents and I were closer to the action,\" she grins. \"My mom wants pictures of Jerrod \"making the McDougal family proud . I just happened to look back and see you leaving with Stasia trying to catch up to you.\" I give her a sympathetic smile as she sits next to me. Stasia sits in front of her, grinning stupidly until I'm forced to ask, \"What?\" \"That boy was staring at you.\" My throat tightens, although I don't know why. It's not like I did anything wrong, per se. But judging by the way I heaved-ho outta there and Stasia waggles her brows, it's hard to tell. LeAnn looks at me, and I roll my eyes, trying to play the entire situation off. \"It's nothing, Don was looking in my direction—\" \"He was looking right at you!\" Stasia exclaims giddily. \"—probably trying to have eye sex with some girl behind more or something,\" I dismiss. \"Not true, I saw the whole thing ,\" Stasia jumps up. She points at me, almost accusingly, but she's riddled with excitement. \"He—Don—couldn't take his eyes off Clara. I swear to God, it's true!\" \"Even if that's true, it doesn't mean anything,\" I stress, trying to get Stasia to lay off. LeAnn just stares at me, a slight frown on her soft features. \"It doesn't,\" I whisper, but more so to convince myself. Biting my lip, I think back to the last conversation Don and I had, and I take a deep breath. I don't know boys, but surely Stasia and LeAnn could quench my confusion over Don's whole ' I-really-want-to-see-you-'round ' a week ago. \"Well…\" I begin slowly, \"there is something I want to ask you guys…\" I quickly rattle off my narration, from nearly falling over to driving off in a fury. Ever since Don \"rescued\" me, Stasia's mouth has been slowly falling open until it begins to scratch the floor, her eyes dinner plates. LeAnn's face remains impassive. When I finish, I take a deep breath, waiting for the worse. \"He's clearly trying to fuck with your head,\" LeAnn snaps. \"He, like, wants you, so bad ! It's sooo adorable!\" They speak simultaneously and I wince at Stasia's girly shriek, and I'm honestly more for LeAnn's conclusion, because it simply enforces what I've assumed all this time. I don't want Don's attention. In fact, I don't want anybody's attention unless they're an Ivy League or host a Division I soccer or track program. \" Pfft ,\" I dismiss with a wave of my hand. \"Stasia, I'ma have to be with LeAnn on this one. Don isn't interested in girls like me.\" Stasia frowns and slowly seats back down. \"Girls like you?\" I shrug. I don't even know what I mean, I just know that it's true. \"Because you're half black, you think you're not good enough for him?\" Stasia snaps. \"He'd be fucking lucky to have a girl like you,\" LeAnn agrees. \"But you deserve better.\" \" Guuuuuuys ,\" I whine, because this conversation is not going in the direction I wanted. I whimper and fall over at the waist, resting my head on the cool floor. Suddenly my head starts pounding worse than when I had the entire town screaming in my ears. Boys are such a taboo topic for me. LeAnn pats my thigh sympathetically. \"He's not interested . Don wants one thing outta girls, and it involves so much more thrusting and grunting than I'm ready for.\" \"Tennis?\" Stasia jokes, a light smile on her face. When I shoot her one of those looks, she smacks her lips impatiently and rolls her eyes. \"Just say sex, Clara.\" \"I have no problem saying sex, or fucking, or screwing, or whatever the hell people call it now. All I'm saying is that sex is all he wants.\" \"What's wrong with that?\" Stasia asks with a laugh. I fall silent, a hot blush spreading across my olive-toned features. LeAnn coughs awkwardly from beside me, diverting her eyes to the suddenly fascinating row of grey lockers. I suck and nibble on the inside of my cheeks, aware of how suddenly the temperature seemed to drop in the hallway. What's wrong with a guy only wanting sex, Clara? Hmm? Stasia realizes that she's the only one laughing and begins to fall silent. She looks confused, glancing from me to LeAnn, hyper aware of a memo she missed. \"Wait…\" she begins slowly, her eyes gaining a luminescent glow as a sudden realization came to her, \"Clara, are you a virgin ?\" \"The whole school coulda told ya that,\" LeAnn mutters dismissively. Shooting her the most murderous glare I could muster with a headache, I remain silent. They called me 'Mary'—as in the Virgin Mary—from eighth grade to tenth I recall to myself in a detached manner. I nearly shudder at the memories of what I consider the worst three years of my life. Dealing with the sordid jokes and taunting got slightly better once LeAnn and I started getting along, but I can still recall all the months afterwards I could smell salt on my sheets from all the crying I had done, despite numerous washings. Stasia's face fell, and I could see her dainty Adam's apple bob uncertainly. She licks her lips and then gives me a strained smile. \"There's nothing wrong with—\" I let out a bark of disbelieving laughter. I probably would've been fine with being a virgin thing if it hadn't been for those three painful years, but that's what college is for, right? And if not…well, I guess there's always women. Or being a Nun, which I'm already qualified for except I'm not Catholic. \"Clara, why the hell did you just run off like that?\" I look up, not having heard my mother and Veronica come out the feeding. Their faces seemed flush and their hair is sticking to their skin, especially on the forehead and neck. Both fan themselves dramatically with the programs, panting with the flair of a bulldog. \"Honestly Janie, I didn't quite care to watch men your age and up chanting like it was a f-ing Madonna tour gone wild.\" \"Don't be ridiculous,\" Janie snaps. Then she grins at me. \"Maybe Rolling Stones.\" I smile a genuine smile while Veronica stares at me, shocked. \"You call your mother by her first name?\" The hitch in her voice suggested that she thought it might be a southern custom. \"Mom makes her feel old,\" I state, and Janie nods. She's only thirty-four, popping little ol' me out at the ripe age of seventeen. Another reason the crazy-obsessed conservatives (everyone over forty) hated her: the daddy was white and apparently she was a whore—and there are plenty of people who make sure she remembers it, and I know where I came from. Like her daughter, Veronica accepts this simply at face-value, and I'm really starting to appreciate this simple \"don't ask don't tell\" policy in the Queen Family. \"Well, we should head home,\" Janie sighs. \"LeAnn are you sticking around or do you need a ride home or do you want to stay the night?\" Janie's offer is unexpected, but no unheard of. Besides, it is Friday. I look at LeAnn expectedly and she says, \"I'd like to stay over if it's no hassle.\" She is such a sweet-heart when she wants to be. \"Of course it isn't, just go let your mother know and we'll be waiting here.\" LeAnn runs off and I turn to Stasia just as I see her and her mother make a move for the door. \"Wait, Stasia, aren't you coming over?\" I didn't think much of my asking, but Stasia's eyes do that thing where they light up, and it dawns on me she thought I was going to exclude her. She looks from Janie to Veronica, and they both give her an affirmative smile. She squeals and throws her arms around me with more enthusiasm than I expected for someone simple going to spend the night at my house. But realizing how important this must be to her, I comply and uncomfortably but surely wrap my arm around her tiny frame, close enough to inhale her most-likely expensive perfume that I don't know the name of. Early the next morning, while the sky is still dark and after Lee and Stasia have just fallen asleep, I lay awake in my sleeping bag, arms crossed behind my head as I stare up at the ceiling. I know I'm somewhere between sleep and a semi-conscious state: my eyes are open, but I don't really feel like I'm even in my own body. I wonder what my first kiss might be like. Soft? Passionate? God-forbid, slobbery? All these questions, these innocent curiosities most girls get over by eighth grade, but I'm a senior in high school and couldn't begin to imagine what's so hot about a tongue getting shoved down my throat. But then again, I could be fantasizing wrong. I make myself close my eyes and I imagine all the romance films I've seen in my lifetime, where the kiss is so deep and passionate that any girl might wish to be kissed just like that one day. The way the man tenderly clutches the woman's cheeks as if she's the most fragile thing he could hold, but tightly as if he's afraid she might vanish. But like my Romeo & Juliet, it's just another work of fiction created to remind the saps like me that we have no one to caress and hold. I can only imagine what it must be like. Hmm…must be nice.[Chapter 5] CHAPTER FIVE The following is completely true (I swear): About two weeks after the Feed, things went more-or-less back to normal. It's officially football season in Texas, and the Odessa could appear black and white from the spacecraft (ha, in more ways than one). Despite everything, I too am excited for the upcoming game against Midland on Friday, but I know I won't go. I never do, since James and I started quarreling. Now, I just settle for the live radio broadcast while I study or something. Two weeks after the Feed, and my body is completely back to normal. (Hallelujah, praise the Lord!) My doctor gave me the all clear yesterday after school to remove the brace from my ankle. He checked where the skin had once been bruised and swollen, he checked my side for pain, but said I looked fine in both areas. Relief doesn't even describe how I feel. I feel ecstatic. Surely, everything that had happened since the attack would go back to normal now? I didn't know what would happen with whatever the hell is going on between Don and me. Or not going on, I don' even freakin' know. All I know is that I want him to leave me alone, and I hope that the disappearance of my injures send me right back to where I was before on the interesting factor. Right? Aw, jeez. I can't be this weak. The first guy to really look at me and I'm just going to throw away everything I believe in? And of course said 'first guy' would be Don. That's just my own damn luck. His intentions are probably to see if he can make me the butt of some joke, and I'd rather take a beating again before I'm the school joke. Again. Rather than continuing my mind-numbing tyrant, I crank up the volume on my cassette player, Michael Jackson's 'Dirty Diana' screaming into my eardrums until my eyeballs seem to vibrate in their sockets. Searching for a book that might assist me in my Calc studies, I scan the shelves, my finger running across each spine while I softly sing along to the lyrics that always manage to entice my attention. I find a book that might contain what I'm looking for, and as I flip through the unused pages (the spine hasn't even been broken in) I slowly head back to my table. Slowly, because I simply want to enjoy having my foot back. As a bona-fide athlete, the very thought of being without my limbs is reason enough for nightmares. So as I take my seat at an empty table, I bounce my leg and rotate my ankle as I tackle calculus. I'm not even an inch deep into the homework when I see, out of the corner of my eyes, a figure sit down at the chair beside me. Wary and curious, I pause my music and drop my headphones until they're around my neck. \"Don…why am I not surprised?\" And in a way, I'm really not. At the rate he keeps showing up, I half expect him to move into my house. I remove my headphones and toss them back into my bag. \"Clara, this is going to sound really random but…will you go out with me?\" Exact words. Swear. To. God. First, I stupidly look over my shoulder, truly expecting another Clara to be lurking behind my shoulder. Nothing. Damn. I look back at Don, literally speechless. This whole thing has really just gone too fucking far. But I couldn't find the heart to tell him off, because the shock hadn't worn off. Instead, I stand up and head towards the bookshelves, making like I forgot something important when really I just hope he'll leave. Naturally, he doesn't. \"Wait…Clara…wait!\" Don catches up to me, and the second I feel his presence behind me I say softly, \"No.\" \"Sorry, what?\" \"No…I-I don't want to go out with you.\" I don't look up. I don't look back. I stare at the stain in the carpet a few feet ahead, my heartbeat resonating loudly in the silence. There's no one here but us after all. \"Why not?\" I close my eyes, wondering to God why he didn't take a hint. I said 'no', do I need to spell it for him. Define it? Throw a book at his head? \"Because I don't want to,\" I snap. I walk to the other side of the shelves and Don doesn't follow, but I feel his eyes on me through the books. \"You know that's not a real good excuse for turning me down,\" he retorts playfully. Clearly, he's not heartbroken or dying a little more inside at my rejection, so why the hell is he still here? I look up, exasperated, and slowly formulating how to nicely say, \"Fuck off\" when I freeze. Most of his face is cut off by the top of the books and the bottom of the shelf —I guess he's slouching, because he's too tall to be looking right at me like he is now—and all I can make-out at first glance is his eyes. He's staring right at me, just like he did at the Feed. Except this time I'm close enough to see his eyes watch me. They're completely steady and unwavering from my gaze. But besides that is how sharply the green contrast with his tan complexion. They're brighter than I thought them to be. By God…they're mesmerizing. Wait… mesmerizing ? Laughing at myself, I duck my head and stare at the book titles engraved on the spines. My smile falters with the irony of finding my own Romeo & Juliet looking back at me. \"Look, Don, we don't even know each other—\" \"Um…Clara, that's the whole point of dating . To get to know each other.\" That teasing enters his voice again, and I find it unbelievably irritating. Rolling my eyes, I walk from behind the shelves and back towards my table when Don runs ahead and cuts me off. \"If you give me a good reason why not, I'll leave.\" \"I don't have to.\" I move to my left. Don moves to his right. \"Nope.\" \"I don't want to.\" I move to my right. Don, once again, blocks my path to my table. \" Definitely not feeling that one.\" \"Look, I don't know what kind of bet you made me your sick little—\" \"Why,\" he starts loudly, cutting me off, \"is it that you think I'm trying to fuck you over every time I try to hit on you.\" \"Is that what you call yourself doing?\" I ask snidely. He gives me that stupid grin of his. Does nothing affect this guy? He ducks his head, and then he pulls the slickest move I've ever seen. He looks up at me through his long, thick lashes. \"How 'bout just one date?\" I copy his stance, mirroring how he has both hands behind his back, looking up at him (literally since I'm only around five-six). \"You're serious about this?\" He gives me an innocent smile with his pouty lips. Yeah, I said it. They're pouty , don't judge me. There's a moment of weakness that my mind succumbs to in the silence. Why not? Why not? Why not? I want to believe that he has the purest of intentions, but…he's Don Billingsly. My very reputation could be branded 'Slut' if anyone happens to see how close we are now. The rumors that would circulate, the pressure to…what? To have sex? Yeah, I can just about anticipate that hurdle. Not to mention the booze, his whoring, and the whole 'jock' thing. I don't like jocks. And yet…why the hell not? Because…he's just not for me. God, I can't even imagine his idea of a date. I house party, surely, while I'm so drunk outta my mind I don't even realize he's trying to coax me out of my flower-print panties in the back of some dude's car. Christ, what's wrong with me. I shake my head slowly, this weird feeling settling in the pit of my stomach that oddly doesn't feel much like relief. \"I just…I can't. I'm sorry.\" I'm sorry? I'M SORRY? For the hell what? I'll never know; I don't understand anything right now. I push past him, not bother to excuse myself. My papers rustle in the ensuing silence as I stuff them in my bag. I just leave the library book on the table. I shoulder my bag and turn, stunned, to find Don already gone. Sadly, it was not the last time I saw him. / The day of the big game brings an anticipated buzz through the school hallways. Kids yell who's picking up whom and at what time across classrooms, gymnasiums, hallways, and the cafeteria. LeAnn agrees to take Stasia who, in my opinion, just wants to see Brian play. I note that Lee looks absolutely miserable at the idea of babysitting the New Girl to her first football game—(\"God, what if she starts cheering aloud for the wrong team ?\")—and after I assure her that Stasia's not a moron, I tell her to get over it. \"Then why don't you come to the game then,\" she retorts smartly. I shoot her a don't-go-there glare just as we join Stasia at our usual spot in the cafeteria for lunch. Stasia, whom I hadn't seen all day, is geared up for her first game, dressed up in a black Permian Panthers tee the cheerleaders were selling to raise money for something I couldn't care less about. Her red and pink streaks are gone, replaced with black streaks. Her hair is pulled back with both a black and white ribbon. She has GO on one cheek and PERMIAN on the other. Even I've never shown that much enthusiasm and I've lived here all my life. Go figure. \"Hey, guys,\" she chirps brightly. I wish I could be that peppy, but it looks like a full-time hassle. \"What's with the get-up?\" Lee questions, gesturing to Stasia's choice of attire and make-up. \"Just getting in the spirit,\" Stasia responds with a full-blown mega-watt smile. Me and Lee take our seats, and I listen calmly as Stasia goes into a monologue of how she's gonna catch Brian's attention at the game. Naturally, I'm reminded that I didn't tell either of them about Don asking me out. I could've, I knew that, but I figure if it's never spoken of, I would forget all about it. Besides, Stasia would never let me hear the end of it. (She already did MASH on scrap paper and figures that her \"predictions\" make me and Don and ideal couple. I'm sure she thought the same things about Othello and Desdemona, and look how well that ended. Surely, a sign of things to come if my luck keeps up at this rate.) With no lesbian intentions meant, I can't help but ogle Stasia's chest as I eat. Her boobs are kinda in your face with the v-neck of the tee, and I faintly wonder who makes v-neck tees. I glance down quickly at my pitiful lumps (Janie loved taunting me and calling them \"rosebuds\"; I am not making this up) and faintly wonder if my life would've played out differently with actual boobs. \"Clara, are you sure you don't wanna come to the game with us,\" Stasia ask eagerly. The way her and Lee eye me, I feel like they're ganging up on me simply because they don't want to hang out with each other. I give Stasia a wane smile. \"Yeah, I'm sure. I'll be listening though, don't worry. I never miss a game.\" We dig into our lunches, our silence quickly replaced by the chatter of the cafeteria. The few football players I can point out seem a little more silent and a little less…happy. I can't necessarily blame them. At least I get to have fun playing the sports I love. They might as well get paid, because in this town, football is a job, not an extra-curricular activity. \" Heeeellooo , lady,\" James drawls out sliding next to Stasia like the worm he so clearly is. \"Hi, Boobie,\" Stasia replies sweetly. God, why can't she just hate people like a normal teenager. All her niceness to James makes me feel guilty. (God, I almost couldn't think that with a straight face.) \"So, I see you coming to our game tonight. Gonna cheer for me as I score each touchdown?\" \"Did it ever occur to you that someone else might—God-forbid it— score , besides you?\" I interject irritably. James cuts his eyes at me, his cocky demeanor disappearing quickly at my challenge. \"I don't think I was talking to you, so mind your own damn business.\" \"I think you guys will do great,\" Stasia cuts-in weakly, but to no avail because we completely ignore her. \"I'm just saying, you're not the freakin' sun, the game does not revolve around you.\" He snorts. \"Do you even listen to the radio: Bobbie Miles is takin' Permian all the way to States . Me! Not anyone else and sure as hell not you , so why don't you crawl back to your Mommy and have her read your textbook to you!\" \"Thank God, you do know what a textbook is. Quick, who was the first president of the United States?\" \" Pfftt , man, fuck you, Clara!\" He stands up heatedly, his voice growing loud and attracting the attention of nearby tables. He starts walking away, but because he's still throwing insults at me over his shoulder, I stalk his heels and here the nastiest words he's ever uttered at me: \"Just because you fuckin' jealous that I get all the attention and you nothin' more than Virgin Mary, the little kiss-ass that has no friends and probably hasn't even kissed a boy—!\" The second he turned around to face me turned into the biggest mistake of his life, because I slapped him so hard the crack of my palm hitting his cheek resonated through the cafeteria, silenced the conversations, and put all eyes on us. But I wasn't worried about that. No. I was worried about who might've possibly heard James' last comment. No, I wasn't worried about the fact that, for the first time, I laid a hand on my cousin. I'm more concerned with what everyone else thinks of me. My morals have hit an all-time low. I put my finger in his face, my whole body quivering with a rage I only felt when Miss Jenkins called my mother a whore at the local market when I was ten. My eyes burn with humiliation, but I blink all possible tears away quickly and say, \"I hope you fuck up at the game you arrogant bastard.\" I leave in a rage, my steps the only thing I hear. It's only after I hear that James later injured his knee at the game that my last words register in my head. But by that point, the damage is already done.[Chapter 6] CHAPTER SIX In an indignant rage, I refused to take part in my seasonal routine of listening to the football game play-by-plays on the radio. At this rate, I could care less if the team went to fucking States or not. Nevermind the fact that I keep glancing out my window to where Ratliff stands off in the distance, wondering what the score is; that's beside the point. The lights seem like some sort of beacon, bright, tall, and captivating. In a metaphorical kind of way, they represented the closest thing to life in this town. And when they went out, so did the spirit of Odessa. For another week at least. Sighing, I close my blinds, but it doesn't help much. I'll just have to wait for the game to be over which…I check my watch and realize that it's technically over. It's a little past ten, and I know that when Janie comes home, I'll know the verdict. Not that I care. I head back downstairs to the living room—having gone up for a quick shower so I could jump into my pajamas—where my half-melted tub of cookie-dough ice-cream awaits me on the coffee table. The Cosby Show is on commercial. The second I move to sit back down on the couch, my doorbell rings. Janie has keys, so God forbid whoever the hell is on my porch at ten at night. If it's the Texas Chainsaw killer, then it'll just be proof that I was Stalin in another life, and clearly paying for something. But no, it's just Lee and Stasia. \"We won! Wewonwewonwewon…!\" I look at LeAnn while Stasia screams in excitement. \"So…heard we won.\" LeAnn rolls her eyes dramatically, but she gives me an enthused smile. \"Yeah, we did. Weren't you listening?\" \"Nah. Too pissed at Boob to care…What's up?\" They both kinda fell silent for a moment. I give them a push to explain with my eyes. \"Nothing,\" LeAnn shrugs. \"We were just wondering, well, the kids from school are throwing a celebratory party by the oil rigs on the edge of town. Everyone's invited, so we came by to pick you up.\" I snort. \"You know I don't do parties, Lee, so don't even bother.\" \"Actually,\" Stasia says with a sweet smile, \"you don't really have a choice.\" / \"I look like a whore, I should sue .\" \"Relax, you look hot !\" Stasia shouts enthusiastically. \"Guys will be dying to get into your pants.\" \"Ohmigod, thank you Stasia, because that's just what I wanted,\" I respond sarcastically. Stuck in the back seat of Lee's Camaro, I glance down at their choice of attire and wince. I'm wearing stonewashed skinny jeans I honestly forgot I had in my closet after Janie bought them for my birthday a year ago. The tag had still been on, but they hugged my legs perfectly as if they had been bought yesterday. I don't even want to contemplate how the hell I'm getting out of them though—and contrary to Stasia's belief, it won't be with the help of a guy. I'm wearing a dark purple halter top—Janie's—that I've been trying to yank up for the past ten minutes. At least I get to wear my plain ol' Adidas. Continuously running my fingers through my loose, ink-black waves, I try one more time to get out of this form of torture at the hands of my so-called \"friends\". \"Guys, really, why can't we go somewhere else to hang out? You know I'm the class freak, they'll hate to see me there.\" \"Will you relax ,\" Lee snaps. \"Damn, you're more bitchy than my brother. And he's a fucking diva.\" I huff indignantly and sit back, folding my arms across my chest. As Lee pulls up next to a group of cars, I can faintly see the signs of a…fire? Holy shit, is this a bonfire party. Great, now someone has the excuse of \"accidentally\" pushing me in. \"You really need to get out more,\" Lee says looking back at me as she shuts off the car. \"I know I do.\" I reluctantly climb out the back, jogging to stay behind Stasia and Lee, literally trying to hide behind them and praying I can go through this night without running into Maria or any of her goons. I'm the person who would not be caught dead at a party, and I can already hear the ridicule that would accommodate my sudden appearance tonight. The Texas night is cool enough that the bonfire doesn't seem suffocatingly hot. Glancing from side to side, I make note that nearly half the school does seem to be here, drinking and dancing to a song being blared from several of the cars parked in a circle around the fire tuned to the same station. There's laughing and talking, and when I realize people are too hyped from the game to pay me any mind, I allow a bit of tension to leave my shoulders. \"Let's go find something to drink,\" Stasia suggest with a bright smile and a laugh. I follow her despite the fact that I don't drink, and when she shoves the lukewarm beer in my hand, I tell her so. \"Oh, live a little, Clara,\" she scolds. Then she tilts her head back and chugs nearly half her bottle. \"Damn, New York, that's impressive,\" Brian says with a cheeky grin. Stasia responds with a flirtatious kiss in his direction and he laughs. The faint sparkle in his brown eyes tells me he's already had a bit to drink. \"Hey, Clara, can I talk to you for a sec?\" Faintly aware that I'm holding a beer in my hand, I nod stupidly and say, \"Sure.\" He pulls me aside a couple of feet, his hand warm on my bare arm. \"Don told me he asked you out the other day—\" I groan, kicking a few empty red, plastic cups away from my feet and off into the distance. \"God, what does he want now?\" Brian smiles at me, I think amused. \"You really don't wanna go out with him, do you?\" \"No.\" He laughs. \"You know, he's not gonna stop.\" I frown. \"Sorry?\" \"He's not gonna stop asking you until you say 'yes'.\" I just look at him, and Brian sighs before launching into a NASA-worthy explanation. \"You told him 'no'. Clara, you are probably the first girl in Permian Panther High School history to turn Don down, and he doesn't take 'no' well. You're a challenge . He wants you more now than he did before.\" I doubt I'm the first girl with proper morals to tell him 'no', but I don't tell Brian this. \"Uh…huh. Is that a guy thing?\" (I honestly think that is a good question.) \"I'm just letting you know,\" Brian says with an innocent shrug. Then he grins at me. \"You look really hot tonight, by the way. You should wear your hair down more often.\" Brian leaves me, blushing and grinning like a school-girl, to talk to Stasia. My smile begins to fade as the point of his pulling me aside begins to sink in. I stare at the bonfire, the kids dancing around it and having an all-'round good time, I wished I was home, sleep or watching TV with Janie. \"You don't strike me as a beer-kinda-girl.\" \"That's because I don't drink it,\" I respond curtly. I set the beer on the trunk of some car. Someone will enjoy it eventually. \"What do you want, Don?\" \"Jeez, I just came over to say that there are no hard feelings despite you turning me down. I forgive you.\" \"Uh…huh.\" \"But it's not too late to change your mind.\" \"Good God, man, save it. I don't want to go out with you.\" Don comes to stand directly in front of me, his eyes boring into mine to the point that I have to look down. But he grabs my chin and forces my gaze up. \"Look at me and say it.\" \" What ?\" \"Look me in the eyes and say that you honest-to-God have no interest in going on just one date with me.\" Is he serious ? \"I—\" \"Wow, you have some fucking nerve showing your face around here.\" I close my eyes in distress, praying it's not Maria. I turn around. It is. \"Well you know what they say, Maria: 'This land is your land…'\" \"You know you ruined the entire fucking season for us, you stupid whore.\" \"Whoa, Maria, cut it out,\" Don snaps in a surprisingly sharp tone. Whoa now. Crazy-white-she-devil just called me a what? \"Excuse me? What the hell are you talking about?\" \"Maria—\" Don begins harshly. \"Boobie injured his knee during today's game. Interesting, considering what you told him today in the cafeteria.\" Knee injury . I think back to the awkward pause between LeAnn and Stasia when I mentioned my cousin. I turn to find them looking at me, guilt ridden across their faces. Knowing my cousin injured himself they bring to this goddamn party where I'm bound to get called out by my earlier comment. I can feel my look of accusation laced with hurt. They practically threw me to the fucking lion's den without having the decency of enlightening me to my supposed crime. \"I'm not a fucking witch,\" I retort, turning back to Maria. \"If he injured his knee than he pulled some shit he wasn't supposed to. Not my problem.\" \"Oh, but you see, it is,\" Maria coos in a manner that sends chills up my spine. The last time I heard her take that tone with me was eighth grade, the same year she, for some reason, became my personal hell on earth. I'm vaguely aware that a small crowd is forming around us, beers inches from the lips that pause drinking to whisper excitedly behind hands. \"If your stupid curse costs Permian the Championships, you're so dead.\" And then, as if to emphasis her point, she takes the remaining beer in her red cup and tosses it in my face. I'm aware of Lee screaming obscenities while Maria howls with laughter. The disgusting stench of beer fills my nose and that wet grass taste is all I can feel on my tongue. It's in my hair, staining my clothes, and sticking to my skin. But I can't really move, utterly horrified and dangerously aware that my eyes are burning from more than just the alcohol in them. There's chaos in front of me: LeAnn is trying to get at Maria, and it takes Brian, Don, and Stasia to keep the girls off each other. In the confusion, I slip away, pushing past a few bodies and heading for the main road that'll take me home. I don't care to wait for a ride; I just need to get home as soon as I can. My quickened pace slows as I get further from the party. Suddenly, I hate myself. I hate my inability (on more than several occasions) to defend myself. Never, not once, have I stood up for myself. I've always had Janie or LeAnn for that. I'm a total coward. I deserved to get beer thrown in my face, but I don't do anything to stop it. Crossing my arms over my chest I swallow the urge to dry-heave into the dead grass. I shiver in the cool breeze, quickening my pace so I can get out of my beer-stenched wet clothes. When I'm bathed in headlights from behind, I'm kinda surprised Lee took so long. However, the petty side of me wants to say half of this is her fault, so I'm more than prepared to tell her that I'm walking home. But a car I don't recognize pulls up beside me, and when the voice that's becoming my living nightmare calls out, \"Hey Clara,\" I keep walking. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa,\" Don calls out. I hear his car shut off, but just as I'm making my way across the street towards town, he cuts me off. \"Do you need a ride?\" \"Nah, I think I'll walk.\" \"Clara, you live on the other side of town,\" he explains. \"So?\" \"So?\" he mimics. \"That's nearly ten miles. Are you seriously about to walk ten miles simply because I'm your only other transportation option?\" \"I'm considering it?\" I move past him, shoving his shoulder in a manner that conveys \"Leave me the hell alone\" without words. \"Clara, I'm…\" His voice barely comes above a whisper. But he should've kept my name off his lips, because now I'm even more pissed-off. Tears spilling over my lids, I try to cover up the fact that I'm crying with anger, which doesn't take much effort really. \"Don't you fucking dare.\" Turning, I throw an accusatory finger in his face, raising my voice to try to hide how it cracks, but I don't succeed. \"Don't you dare apologize. Don't you dare pity me. God knows you're the last person I want pitying me. So thanks for the offer, but I will take care of myself .\" There's a moment of silence where Don just looks at me. \"It's just a ride home, Clara. It's non-binding, swear.\" I look down at my feet, a little ashamed at my outburst. Covering my wet eyes with my hand, I take deep shuddering breaths, my brain trying to reason with itself. He just wants to help, that's all. Just helping, completely harmless. Finally, I shrug. \"Yeah…\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah, okay.\" Walking quickly before I talk myself out of it, I climb into the passenger side of the car, trying to kick a couple of water bottles out my foot space. \"Sorry 'bout the mess,\" Don says with a nervous cough. \"I usual don't get a lot of girls in my car.\" I look at him curiously. \"Why does that surprise me?\" He looks so offended I actually laugh. Well, it's more of a chuckle, but same thing. \"Just kidding,\" I retract defensively. I pick up a bottle as he starts the car. \"Can I borrow these?\" He just looks at me, so I climb out the car, and bend forward at the waist, dumping whatever amount of water is in the bottles on my head. I wash the stickiness off my skin and try my best to at least dilute the smell of beer until I can wash my hair. Then I pull my thick strands together as if I'm making a ponytail before twisting it and then twirling it into a bun, tucking the end as tight as it will go. I'd rather have a band or something to hold it together, but I never assumed I would get beer thrown in my face either. When I slam the door shut Don immediately pulls away from the curb, heading into town. I stare out my window, glancing up at the clear, dark sky. It never dawned on me that I'm positively famished until my stomach lets out this loud sound that sounds like a muffled burp. My face flushes and I tuck my lips together. I glance over at Don who's staring at me and trying his damnest not to laugh. \"Are you hungry, Clara?\" \"Shut up.\" But he lets out a snort before busting out laughing and I don't know if I'm laughing at myself or at his response, but either way I have my temple to my fist and I can't stop smiling. \"Hey, I know this great diner that's open twenty-four seven, you wanna grab a bite to eat?\" I bite my lower lip nervously, I wonder if he means as a date or as…friends? Acquaintances? I don't really care, I am hungry. I shrug, as if it's no big deal. \"Sure.\" He looks at me, his face impassive and most likely surprised I said 'yes'. \"Wait…\" I begin, and he nods, as if he expected this, \"I don't have any money on me—\" \"It's fine, I have enough to cover the both of us.\" \"No, really, at least drop me off so I can grab my wallet.\" \"Seriously, Clara, it's fine. I don't mind paying.\" \"Yeah, but—\" He pulls over in front of some house on the corner, shutting off the engine and turning to look at me. The only lighting comes from the dim streetlight on the other side of the road. I notice how particularly silent the neighborhood is, so when Don starts talking, it sounds obnoxiously loud. \"You're really trying to fight me on this?\" \"It's common courtesy, Don; I'm not fighting you on anything.\" \"Then why won't you just let me pay?\" \"Because…because…\" I stumble on my thought process. Biting my lip and scrunching my brows like I've been asked a difficult question. \"It's not rocket science, Clara.\" I turn my head and he's hunched forward, forearms resting on the top of the steering wheel. He's staring straight ahead, giving me a pretty good look at his profile. Something in his voice makes me wonder if we're still talking about who's paying, but I can't be sure because he's not looking at me and what I can make-out is nothing but stoic. \"I know,\" I respond softly, my stomach fluttering with nerves. \"But no one's ever offered to pay for me; I'm not use to the idea that someone would want to.\" Now he looks at me. \"No one?\" I shake my head, and I curl my lips in a smile that's meant to portray my indifference, but it doesn't last. \"Guess I was just never worth paying for?\" My cheeks flush, and I know by the way he's looking at me he realizes we're not really talking about money. \"Well if it's any consolation,\" he says slowly, \"a girl like you is worth every penny.\" Hook line and sinker. Damn, he's gooood. \"How many times has that worked?\" He just looks at me innocently. I smile. \"Thanks, Don.\" He gives me a nonchalant shrug, but his smile is sincere. He flops back in his seat, but I guess the aged piece couldn't handle the sudden weight because it fell back, taking all of Don with it as he lets out a surprised \"oomph\". I bust out laughing at all his long limbs flailing to right himself. His face is red as he manages to sit up; forced to yank on the chair until it's righted in its proper position. I can't breathe, laughing so hard that there is zero inhaling. \"It's really not that funny,\" he laughs. I nod my head, my eyes watering. I gasp, my lungs letting out a Hail, Mary at the sudden oxygen intake. \"Yeah, it really was.\" \"You think so?\" I nod. \"You know, I think that seat is broken too…\" He throws himself across my lap, and the second I realize he's going for the lever on my right, I let out a shriek. \"Nooooo,\" I laugh, fighting his hands for control. I can hear his laughter in my ears, ringing with their deep yet charismatic sounds. \"Cheater!\" I scream when he wraps his arm around my waist, pinning one arm to my side. When I realize his inches from the lever on the side, I put my feet on the side of the door and push back. Catching him off guard, he topples backwards until his body is thrown across all three seamless front seats, me right on top of him. I laugh even harder. It takes me a few seconds for my high to come down, leaving both of us silently trying to catch our breaths in the semi-darkness of his car. I can feel that my hair is a complete disarray, torn from its holding on my head by our fooling around. And as my breathing slowly falls back to normal, I realize that so has Don's because I can feel his chest moving up and down considering it's where the back of my head is resting. His arms are still wrapped around my middle, and I innocently notice how years of football seem to have blessed Don with lean, toned arms. His muscle definition is…impressive. And I can really feel how defined his chest and stomach is through his tee. A slow blush creeps across my flesh when I pay attention to how my body's laid out between his legs. Our positions somehow look oddly…sensual. At least to me they do. Is it weird that I don't really want to move? I want to blame it on the fact that this moment, right here, marks the closest I've ever been to a guy. His hot breath in my ear sends shivers up my arms and back, and his large arms wrapped around my torso feel oddly comforting. \"Clara…?\" \"Hmm?\" \"I think you should move.\" His voice sounds strained or breathless…or maybe both. There's a moment of silence where his words replay themselves in my head. I don't even have time to take into consideration how much of a dumb ass I feel like right now. His arms fall to his sides, and the area they once occupied seems suddenly colder—as does the rest of the atmosphere in the car. I sit up and Don lets out a miserable groan, clutching my hips tightly. \"God, Clara…\" \"What?\" I look at him, absolutely furious, when something in his face makes me pause. I can't really describe it because it's not a face I'm used to seeing. His features look twisted somehow, but I can't really tell why… Oh. My. God. I can feel… it . Oh Jesus God, I mean Christ, I can feel it pushing against the back of my upper thighs. \"Oh God, I am so sorry!\" I panic, scrambling off his lap and into the passenger seat while Don pulls his legs back. I don't know who's face is more red, mine or his. \"Clara…I'm sorry, I didn't mean.\" \"No, I know it's not your fault. You're a guy, I'm sure it happens randomly all the time…\" Don sits up, licking his lips nervously. As he turns to face the front again, as I ask, \"Do you want me to leave—?\" He frowns and looks at me. \"What? No, of course I don't—\" \"—Because I can, if this is awkward or anything. I didn't mean to…\" Give you an erection , I finish in my head. \"Clara…\" His voice is so soft I feel my eyes burn. This is the worst night of my life. God, I can already hear his explanation. It happens all the time, it wasn't you, it's me. Ha! That's probably where they coined the ever-popular saying: It wasn't you…it was me. \"What?\" I whisper, trying to keep my voice from cracking. My fingers stroke the handle, waiting to make a run for it if need be. He sighs dramatically. \"It wasn't random…okay?\" \"Your point?\" \"My poi—Clara, I like you ! Not on a bet, not on a joke. It's just me here and I honest-to-God really like you! I don't get these things for just anybody.\" I feel sick. I mean, I feel literally sick. Don Billingsly is not supposed to be declaring himself to me in his car. \"I need air,\" I breathe. I throw open my door, holding my stomach and welcoming the cool breeze that slaps me in the face. It wakes me up and clears my head. I shut the door behind me, leaning on the side of the car, palms on the cool metal. I hate that I realize that I'll never lay down again without thinking of Don underneath me. That doesn't sound right. A single tear falls down my cheek and I take a deep shuddering breath. I'm living every girl's fantasy. A boy—a cute, charismatic, charming, fun guy at that—is telling me he likes me. So why am I so upset? I hear his door slam and I take another breath, ready for an onslaught of questions. He comes to stand beside me, mirroring my stance. \"It's not you,\" I begin gently. \"I just…I'm not used to holding someone's attention unless they need homework answers. You're the first guy to ask me out and…that really freaks me out.\" \"Clara—\" \"And quite frankly I don't think the two of us would make a good couple. I'm a huge mess and the entire town practically hates me and—no offense—but you're not exactly boyfriend material.\" \"Ouch, what's that supposed to mean?\" I just look at him pointedly. \"I'm not that bad,\" he argues. I gather the courage to turn my head and look at him. He's gazing off into the distance, his features slack but his shoulders oddly stiff. \"Why should I believe you?\" He lets out a sigh of surrender, dropping his head until he's staring at the sidewalk. \"What would it take for me to convince you I'm worth one date?\" I really wish I knew .[Chapter 7] CHAPTER SEVEN Well Maria is back to her old tricks. I don't know how she always rallies so many people on her side, but it's infuriating. And humiliating. On Monday she somehow convinced a few people to scream \"Witch\" whenever I was around, and on Tuesday—as I exited the cafeteria because I had to dump some things in my truck—an egg was thrown at me. It missed and landed on the wall beside me, but the message was clear as crystal. And that's not even the worse part. About a week after my last conversation with Don, I never saw him again. Fine and dandy, it's probably better that way. Right? Wrong. Wrongwrongwrongwrongwrong! Because on Monday (the Monday after Maria tried to modernize the Salem Witch Trials) he shows up to school in jeans and a dark blue polo (both ironed, I might add), no hat, and he practically avoids eye contact with everybody except Brian and Mike. Naturally, my first response is to spit out my water on some poor sophomore who's unfortunate enough to get the locker beside me. They scurry away, thinking it's some form of a senior prank. Poor sap. As I'm staring, dumbfounded, at the floor with my water bottle still in hand, LeAnn comes up behind me and says, \"What's with Don's getup. Who's he trying to impress?\" \"Who knows,\" I squeak. Sadly, Stasia is not as obtuse as LeAnn, because while I'm in the library during my free period, she bombards me in the Renaissance Era. \"Don looks really nice today,\" she says \"conversationally\". \"Why aren't you in class?\" I inquire as I flip through the celebratory end to the Black Plague. \"Why aren't you scoping out Don?\" \"You can't answer a question with a question.\" \" Clara ! I'm not fucking retarded, I know he dressed up for you. And word in the bathrooms is that he didn't drink or screw anybody at some party this past Saturday!\" She looks at me, big, blue eyes hopeful and wide with my approval. \"It was just one time, Stasia,\" I mutter. \"Yeah, but it's one time more than he's ever done for any girl!\" I give her a look and she raises one shoulder. \"That's what someone wrote in one of the stalls anyway.\" \"Nice, so your evidence is writing on the wall?\" \"No, he's six foot tall, gorgeous, and dressed up in a freakin' polo . An ironed polo . Why don't you give him a chance? You might learn to really like him.\" \"That's not the problem alone, Stasia,\" I argue. \"What isn't?\" \" Liking him,\" I admit. She gasps and her eyes scream Details! but I suck on the inside of my cheek, wondering how much I care to reveal. \"'Cause I do,\" I continue. \"He makes it hard not to.\" I shake my head. \"But like I told him already, it would never work. The whole school is practically spitting on me because they think James' injury is my fault. Can you imagine what the town would do to me if I start dating one of their precious \"white\" kids?\" A look of hurt and even a bit of disgust crosses over her once enthused features. I snort in retaliation. \"Don't give me that 'I Can't Believe You' look, Stasia,\" I scold. \"I just don't see how race plays into a fucking date with a guy who genuinely seems to like you.\" \"You wouldn't understand,\" I snap, slamming the book back on the shelf so forcefully that the whole thing quivers. \"Then explain it to me, because I'm really confused.\" \"Of course you are!\" I didn't mean to raise my voice, and I lower it dramatically before someone hears. \"You've been in Texas—hell, you've been in the South —for two months, Stasia. Two! You can't possibly fathom the racism that goes in these states. And even if you were aware you wouldn't really know because look at you !\" I gesture to her, and my eyes feel wide and crazed. God, I would hate to see myself in a mirror right now. \"And I'm literally stuck in the middle,\" I continue. \"The black kids here are under the impression that I think I'm better than them, and the white kids hate all blacks, no matter what freakin' percentage you are!\" \"Not all of 'em,\" she whispers, her eyes wet. I slump my shoulders. \"No, not all of them,\" I admit after a brief pause, \"but enough of 'em to make my life a living hell if anyone even sees me talking to Don. Janie, she's strong enough to put up with the slurs and insults, but…I'm just not, okay? It's just easier for me if we don't try.\" I twist my foot on the rough carpet, staring at my shoes with a bit of shame at my cowardice. \"I just don't know how to tell Don.\" Suddenly, we both hear the library door slam shut. I look up just to see a figure stalking away from the library, shoulders hunched over as if not wanting to be seen. It doesn't take a genius to know who would be up at the library at this time. \"Looks like you already did,\" Stasia whispers. / When I got home from school, miserable, guilt-ridden in the worst way possible, and exhausted, Janie's tear-stained face in the living room did not make my day in better. \"You left your notebook here,\" Janie says with a sniff. Her voice croaks, and I realize she's been crying for a while. Frowning in confusion, I drop my bag on the floor against the wall before making my way to the coffee table where her finger is pointed. It is, indeed, my notebook, flipped open to the drawing that had disturbed me the day I saw Stasia walking across the courtyard a brand-new face to Odessa. \"I needed a piece of paper for message I was taking,\" Janie explains in a somber voice that cracks often. \"God…Clara, is this how you really feel?\" I stare at the heavy lines, shaded in to the point that the grey lead appears black. The obvious shape of a figure curled up in a dark corner that disturbed me two months before have Janie hanging by a thread. I also realize this is the chance to tell her everything. Tell her what happened the morning I was attacked. And as I gaze into her wide, scared, brown eyes, I almost do. She worries about me all the time, I know it. And I also know that I never make things easy on her, the way I curl myself into a tight protective ball just like the figure in my picture. This is the chance to uncurl myself, to release all my fears and insecurities on her because that's why she's here: for me. But I know I won't tell her. It won't make a difference who knows the truth, because there will be no swift action in my honor. I can only make things worse. And I can't put all my problems on her. \"No,\" I lie with a gentle, fake smile plaster on my face. I'm burning in hell after I die. \"Janie, I was just doodling one of the kids at school—\" \" Don't you dare lie to me , Clarabelle,\" she screeches. I literally jump out of my skin, taken aback by the sudden increase of hostility in her voice. \"I…you know what, forget it. When you're ready to talk— honestly —come find me.\" She brushes past me, stomping down the hall to her bedroom and slamming the door like a child. I cringe as the hollow Slam! echoes across the now silent house, and my face burns with one more pound of shame added to my already slumped shoulders. The awkward silence Janie leaves behind prompts me to grab some spare change out my bag and stuff it into the back pocket of my jeans. Then I grab my car keys, prepared to head anywhere. Thirty minutes of aimless driving and dry heaving brings me to Al's Diner on the edge of town, and I wonder if this is what Don was talking about all those nights ago. Wiping the corner of my eyes where my tears had burned but not fallen, I sniff as I cut off my engine and climb out into the dry heat. Inside, the AC briefly chills my hot flesh before my body finds a way to adapt to the change in temperature. Wishing I had brought a jacket with me, I walk with my head down to an empty booth by the large windows facing the parking lot. Pushing my hair back from my face, I hold back a scream as an older waitress hollers, \"Hey, Sweetie-pie, what can I get you?\" I blink. \"Umm, I've never actually been here before…\" \"A newbie, eh? Well, Miss ol' Carol gonna take real good care o' ya.\" She scurries off and in less than a minute is back with a menu and rattling off the day's specials. My mind is trying to process everything at once, and when she finishes off, she takes a deep breath and grins. \"You got all that, Sweetie-pie?\" \"I'll have the bacon double cheese-burger with double fries and I'll wash it down with a coke, little ice, and for desert can I get the special apple pie with a scoop of vanilla and a cup of coffee.\" She just laughs. \"I'm impressed, Newbie. Say, who's chil' do you belong to?\" \"Uh, Janie Baker.\" \"You Clarabelle?\" \"Yes ma'am.\" She gives me a sweet smile. \"You're order'll be up in sec, Sweetie-pie.\" Ten minutes later a plate of foot is slid in front of me with Carol assuring me that she'll bring my desert out when I've finished. She inquires if I'm sure I'll be able to finish everything, but with years of sports, I have a stomach the size of a soccer ball. I dig in, eating slowly and watching the sun lower itself to the top of the houses. I don't mind staying out because the last thing I want right now is to go home. \"You know, I usually cry into Mr. Whiskers. Always makes me feel better.\" I blink in surprise. And I only realize the comment is directed at me when I feel the wet trail on my cheeks. I wipe my face, laughing off my total humiliating at crying in a diner. \"Sorry,\" I mutter. \"Don't apologize for being human, Sweetie-pie.\" She gives me a toothy smile and I return it appreciatively. \"Well, this outta brighten your day—or what's left of it anywho—but a young regular of mine wanted me to hand you this.\" She slips a folded napkin into my hand, curling my fingers over the soft fabric as if I held a key to saving the world and must protect it with my very life. She winks, under the assumption that it's a flirty, dirty message. Oh Miss Carol, if only you knew me. I give her a quick, \"Thanks\" and she scurries off to wait tables. Hesitantly, I unfold the carefully folded napkin, still sniffing. Taking a deep breath, I stare at the unfamiliar writing. WE NEED TO TALK. MEET ME AROUND BACK . Closing my eyes, I realize it's Don. My guilt from him having overheard my excuses earlier washes over, and I realize I can't bail. I quickly tell Carol to hold my table and that I'll be back momentarily. She happily agrees, probably under the impression that I'm rendezvousing with a hot lover or something. If only. I slide out the cushioned booth and head around back. The parking lot is oddly quiet. My heart hammers in my chest and I turn the corner of the metal building and step into the cool shade. In the seconds it takes for my eyes to adjust to the contrast, he has me pinned up against the wall, squeezing my jaw with his large fingers and his other hand grips my throat tightly. \"Who the fuck have you told?\" Stunned into silence, I don't answer right away, but instead gasp at the pressure on my neck that isn't choking me, but is enough to hurt like a bitch. \"Answer me, you fuckin' mutt.\" \"No…body,\" I breathe, my voice shaking in a panic. Dare I scream? As if reading my mind, his fingers tighten on my neck. \"I swear.\" My voice only comes out above a whisper. \"Yeah? And why the fuck has Billingsly been dicking around?\" \"I'm—,\" His fingers squeeze into the kind of grip that promises death, and I know this is his warning to tell the truth. \"—his tutor,\" I finish, sobbing so hard that my salty tears start mixing with the snot that drips out my nose. He sniffs. He tosses me to the ground. I just barely have time to put out my hands to catch myself. \"Fucking disgusting,\" he spits, glaring at me. \"You fuckin' tell anybody what happened, I'll fuckin' kill ya.\" I just curl up, praying to a God I believe less in every day that he'll go. He does. As quick as he came, he's gone. I vomit beside me and just lay there, puke inches from my face and I don't really care. My throat burns from his touch. Curling onto my knees, I make such a shaky way to my feet that I marvel briefly in how a baby feels taking its first steps. My knees barely hold my weight, and I actually stumble towards the ground, letting out a pained sob of utter distraught and humiliation. Walking to my truck, I feel violated, the sanctity of my mind shattered the instant he laid hands on me a second time. And once again, I failed to protect myself. I wasn't asking for him to come after me. I didn't do anything. Why? Why couldn't he leave me alone? Reaching my truck, it takes me a minute to find my keys in my pockets. My fingers shake so bad that I drop them several times into the sand. When I finally have a firm grip on the keys, I realize I can't even see. My vision is blurred to the point of blindness and I begin thrusting desperately into the air, the heavy ping resonating in my ears each time I only manage to scratch my truck. \"Come on,\" I scream between clenched teeth. \"God, fuck, come…on!\" In despair, I sink to the dirt, tossing my keys to the ground in surrender. No one comes out and asks if I'm okay. I wonder if they even care. And as I duck my head into my arms, crying a fucking river into the dry town that so badly needs it, I wonder if he did me a favor by keeping me alive. Because the worst thing about surviving is realizing that no one else cares or knows that you even did.[Chapter 8] A/N: I hope I doing this right, because that means I've finally figured out this blasted website. No judgie, but I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to type my disclaimer (BTW: I don't own FNL) or to thank all of you for your reviews and alerts. I'm sure I look like a thankless author, but I'm not. Me and technology just have an unbalanced relationship. So thank all of you for you reviews (even if I haven't commented on them yet, know that I love reading them) and patience :) I hope you all enjoy Ch. 8! [Fall 1988] CHAPTER EIGHT After about fifteen minutes of applying, smudging, reapplying, and smudging the concealer along my jawline and throat, I deemed myself presentable enough to attend school. It had been hell trying to sneak myself into my bedroom with a newly purchased thing of makeup considering if Janie had busted me: 1) I would have to explain why I was taking the initiative to buy makeup when the most I ever put on my face is chapstick, and 2) she would see the finger-shaped bruises that I was working to hide. I hadn't even realized the marks were there until I was halfway home from the diner and happened to look up at myself in the rearview. Sighing, I tucked the makeup up my sleeve so that I could return it to its proper spot tucked behind a book on my shelf. Janie and I were avoiding each other like the plague after my little disappearing act, and I wouldn't put it past her to sneak into my room praying she wouldn't find evidence of depression or thoughts of suicide. She was overly dramatic, but she always meant well. I looked at myself in the mirror, stroking my bangs in an attempt to get them to lie flat…er. They were the only pieces of hair not violently yanked back into the ponytail lying flat along my back. I briefly thought about cutting the locks that fell to the middle of my back: they were nothing but a hassle during the soccer season, and they seemed to act as beacons whenever I was in public. It wasn't my honey-toned skin or vibrant eyes…no, it was this damn hair. I pulled my hair over my shoulder without taking my eyes off myself. I could do it. I could cut my hair. It would take some time for Janie and my friends to get used to, but they'll get over it. But I knew I never would. No. Cutting my hair might bring unwanted attention, and with my injures healed and gone, I was thisclose to returning to my invisible existence. Besides, sometimes the length could almost act as a shield if I wore my hair down; over my shoulders, I could only see ahead of me. The end of the semester loomed closer, bringing graduation that much closer. God, I could almost taste the freedom. Surely, once I leave here, everything would get better. It just had to. Throwing my hair back to its place down my back, I take a deep breath. \"Just a few more months, Clara,\" I whisper in my own little mental pep-talk. \"Just keep your nose clean.\" I wanted to laugh at myself. I had to be the most ridiculous person in the world. Stepping out into the hallway, soft snores drift in and out my head from Janie's room. Must be nice to sleep in. But she worked the graveyard shift at the Walmart and had to report to her secretarial position at the firm in Midland Lee in a few hours. I smiled, leaning against the frame and just listening to her sleep. She didn't deserve what I had put her through…what I still put her through. Grabbing my things at the door, I throw my strap on my shoulder and leave silently, making sure to lock up tightly before heading to my truck. My neighborhood was silent as the grave, so I felt pretty bad starting my engine as its roar filled the air. But I used the drive time to prep myself into staying calm during school. Sure, I see him in the hallways and cafeteria, but we have no classes together. I just need to make sure I don't make any sudden movements that might give me away. / I used to believe that I was a pretty transparent person. Wearing my emotions on my sleeve and all that jazz. But as the morning progressed into the warm afternoon no one seemed to notice the sudden appearance of make up, or that I seemed jumpier than usual. I thought I was being obvious. I guess not. And I'm not sure how that makes me feel. On one hand, I don't want word of a second attack spreading around school again. I really don't. That kind of infamy is still weighing heavily on my mind from the first round, and if it happens again, people would likely assume I did it to myself for the attention. (Because the people at my school are, honest-to-God, that moronic.) But I want the people who are supposed to care about me (or say that they do) to just know me well enough and tell when I'm upset. I know it's not fair to be that expectant of them, but it's how I feel. Lee and Stasia are prime examples if only because of the fact that they left me to fend for myself in the lunchroom. Stasia's meeting me later but she had to run to meet with a teacher and Lee's cheating off a boy in her physics class for a homework assignment. I suppose I could've eaten lunch in a classroom due to the fact that food and drink were prohibited in the library, but truth be told, it's just as easy for me to sit here alone and read my— \"Hey, Clara, mind if we join you?\" The fruit speared on my plastic fork pauses halfway to my awaiting mouth as I glance up, stunned to find Brian grinning at me. I gap like a fish, the word \"No\" nearly out of my mouth when I swallow it back down. Instead, I ask, \"We?\" \"Cool.\" He sits down, and I'm about to protest when out of the blue, Mike Winchell sits beside me, shooting me what seems to be an apologetic smile. \"Hey, Clara.\" I love his slow, southern drawl. \"Hi, Mike,\" I say softly. \"Do you mind if I sit down?\" I look up and blush at Don's emotionless stare. He hasn't really said or done anything since my little overheard outburst in the library, but since my attack, I haven't the nerve to at least apologize. Besides, this is what I want. Distance. I nod in quick, short increments, almost spastically really. \"Yeah, yes, of course.\" He ducks his head and sits down beside Brian. They eat calmly, as if this is something we do every day. I, however, can't help but notice that sudden stares from our peers, and I feel my palms become sweaty and I swallow nervously. Just as I formulate some kind of question as to what the hell they're doing, Brian opens his mouth (full of fries) and says, \"How've you been, Clara?\" \"Why?\" I didn't mean to sound defensive or petulant, but for me, I always expect an ulterior motive. Clearly Brian senses this, because he frowns before covering it up with an amused laugh. \"Because I haven't seen or spoken to you in ages!\" I feel my hairline sizzle. \"Right, of course. I'm fine, great even. Fantastic. And you?\" He smirks and I flush again. \"I'm good, Clara.\" Not wanting to seem rude, I turn to Mike. \"And what about you? How have you been, Mike?\" He nods as if trying to reassure my discomfort. He probably would understand better than anyone. \"I've been good, Clara. Real good.\" I give him a nervous smile. God, this is all so awkward. Why are they here? \"Good.\" We fall silent and I'm staring at my fruit salad stupidly, wishing the table would swallow me whole and quickly. \"Aren't you gonna ask me how I've been?\" My attention span stumbles and my gaze jerks until it lands on Don. \"What?\" \"Well, you asked Chavo and Mike here how they've been but not me.\" A proper response to his gentle accusation evades me. So naturally, I go for the next best thing: \"Oh, well, of course. I didn't mean anything…it must've slipped my mind. I'm…so sorry…\" We just look at each other, silent understanding passing between us as he ducks his head down and then looks back up at me, once again, up through his lashes. I don't know how long we sit like that, but Brian suddenly calls out, \"Hey, what's up?\" My gaze jerks from Don and instinctively towards the edge of the table. I look at his face for a moment before a chill washes over me, forcing my eyes down. I feel myself wanting to curl up but I stop myself. Act normal and he'll go away. Act normal and he'll go away. Suddenly, the bruises on my neck seem to burn. \"Nothing much, Brian, just got a message from Coach for the players.\" You're that Baker Girl, right? \"Shoot.\" \"Just that practice is being pushed back an hour while the paint on the field dries for this week's home game.\" What are you doing out here by yourself. \"Hey, have you met Clara yet? Clara Baker?\" \"No, I don't think I've had the pleasure.\" Who the fuck have you told? Out of the corner of my peripheral vision, I see his hand move. I flinch, pushing into Mike. When I realize he's holding his hand out I almost cry with humiliation. Why, for the love of God, can't he leave me alone? \"I have to go, I'm so sorry.\" Without thinking, I leave my things behind. Without thinking, I plan to exit through the doors. Without thinking, I run straight into the last person on this earth that I want to see right now. \"What the fuck, Clara?\" I'm aware of a few people laughing, but otherwise the cafeteria is eerily silent. Looking down, I see spaghetti sauce splattered over my jeans and sneakers, but it's nothing compared to Maria who's literally lying in her lunch. If I wasn't so terrified of Maria, it would be hilarious. But as my life would go… \"Oh, God, Maria! I'm so sorry, I didn't see you—\" \"Don't. Fucking. Touch. Me.\" I was holding out my hand to help her up, but she nearly scooted away from me, as if I carried some kind of contagious disease. Maria stands up, food falling to the floor as she does so. \"I should make you pay for my lunch you stupid bitch!\" I say nothing and this only seems to fuel her enraged fire. \"God, you're a fucking embarrassment, you know that right? For Christ's sake, take a fucking hint, do us all a favor, and drop dead, Clara. No one wants you here.\" My face is so hot it's any moment now before my hair catches fire. I hear Maria snort and mumble under her breath before the squeak of her expensive shoes signal her leaving. Which leaves me standing in the cafeteria, covered in Maria's lunch. It's as if I've disassociated from myself, feeling numb. Facing my two-timing attacker and a bitter Maria in less than thirty seconds is enough to overwhelm all good instincts that tell me to get out now. Stone-washed jeans entertain my downcast gaze and I can only feel a slight relief that I'm no longer standing alone. \"Clara? Wanna get out of here?\" Old Clara would've said, \"No\" because she knew it was wrong to skip school for no good reason. But as I stood in that silent cafeteria, I had an epiphany of sorts: I didn't want to be Old Clara. I didn't want to feel too cowardice to defend myself, too ashamed, too silent. In all honestly, it just made me tired and secretly bitter at the world for being so cruel. But the whole world wasn't cruel. Take Don right now, for example. Showing a simple act of kindness, or Brian, who pushed his friends to join me at lunch so I didn't have to sit alone. Take LeAnn, who use to hate me, or Stasia, who didn't know me from eve. All good people I intentionally distance parts of my life from because it just makes everything…easier. \"I heard there's a twenty-four hour diner that's pretty good,\" I say softly. I hear Don chuckle, \"Is that so?\" I nod mutely. \"In that case…\" He grabs my hand, and I only have a second to notice my bag in his other hand before he's pulling me along. And for the first time in my life, I don't pay attention to the stares that follow me…us, out the cafeteria. All I can do is stare at the back of Don's head and smile. / \"I never did thank you, for what you did for me today.\" Don looks up from the takeout tray full of fries to find me staring at him. \"It's not something you have to thank me for, Clara. I should've busted Maria in the mouth—\" \"No, you shouldn't've,\" I correct with a soft smile. \"But I wish you could.\" He grins before popping a fry into his mouth. Naturally, they were cold by now, but neither of us noticed as we ate in silence. We sat in the bed of my truck, our backs against opposite sides so that we face each other with the tray between our stretched out legs. I never, in the years since Don moved here and became \"It\", would've believed I would spend an entire afternoon with him, let alone enjoy it. He's surprisingly…comfortable. Safe, but not in a settling way. Safe in a way that makes my face flush when he looks at me for a long time, or my skin shiver as he voice roams over it, or my body warm when his arm accidentally grazes mine when he reaches for the salt. Safe in a way that I actual feel like I can trust him. \"Clara?\" \"Hmm?\" \"…Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, why?\" \"You're staring at me.\" I blink quickly. \"Oh, sorry, I didn't mean—\" \"What are you thinking about?\" You . \"Nothing.\" He grins as if he knows I'm lying, but thankfully doesn't push the question. Looking for a change of conversation, I glance off into the horizon where the desert sun leaves a warm palette of colors across the sky. I get so lost in the view that it's not until I stiffen at his arm around my waist that I realize Don's behind me. I turn in confusion as he pulls me between his legs, trying to urge me to lean against his chest. My chest tightens with nerves as my mind summersaults to the last time we were so close, and instinctively, I resist. \"I don't bite, Clara,\" Don murmurs, almost sounding insulted. \"I know,\" I respond quickly, \"I'm just—\" \"Not used to it,\" he finishes. \"Well get used to it.\" With that, he pulls me in so that I can feel the heat of his skin through my blouse. I watch his hands slide down my arms until our fingers are tangled together, and I marvel at how much larger his hands are than mine. Then he moves our arms so that they rest on my stomach. \"See,\" he teases gently, \"harmless.\" I can almost sense his patience as I mentally adjust to the change in atmosphere, from casual to intimate at his discretion. But of course he would have to push for it because I never would. He presses his legs against mine and I feel immersed in a cocoon. \"Yeah, h-harmless.\" This guy is gonna be the death of me. Yet, a single nagging thought prevented me from leaning completely into him. As if my body physically recognized one small, tiny detail that seemed to still hang in the air. \"People are gonna hate you for this.\" He stiffens and the comfortable silence becomes thick. \"Clara—\" \"No point in acting like you won't face the same kinda crap I get,\" I snap sharply, his ignorance irritating. The moment lost, I detangle myself from him and slide off the truck, turning to face him with my arms crossed and my emotions steeled for the ugly truth. He suddenly looks confused, likely wondering where the hell this came from. \"Clara, I don't understand what you want.\" I floundered in my thoughts. I didn't quite know what message I was trying to get across, and thought carefully about my next words. \"I'm not gonna lie, because…you already overheard me say it before: but I do like you.\" He studies me with gentle eyes that urge me forward. \"Today…I can't remember the last time I've laughed so much…ever. But as much as I wish today could last forever, it won't. Tomorrow we have to face our classmates, your friends, and you'll be Don Billingsly of the Permian Panthers and I'll be the Mutt—\" \" Clara —!\" I smiled ruefully but I'm sure Don saw past it. \"Don't act like you haven't heard the nicknames, the stories about Janie and I…and if we…if you and I…\" \"Date?\" Don said with a small smile. \"Yes, that. If we date you'd be in the same boat as me: an outcast. I watched it happen to LeAnn: all her friends, save for those on the soccer team who like me enough, ditched her because of me. And God knows I love her for that…but I can't ask that of you. It's not fair and you'd be giving up so much—\" \"Clara, shut up.\" Okay. Ouch. Don sidles over until his long legs dangle over the edge of my truck, and when his hands grasp my hips, I feel a sudden wave of my resolve break on the shore. \"How Maria treats you—the slurs, the beer, the threats—is cold and cruel.\" His eyes narrow and I swear his voice deepens with anger. \"She always thinks she has the right to tread on whomever she wants and it makes me sick, especially since you never asked for it, Clara.\" \"It's how she was raised—\" \"Doesn't make it right!\" He looks at me, right at me. \"And if I left you now, I'd hate myself as much as I'm starting to hate her.\" I can't look him in the eyes, so I keep my focus on the side of my truck, but I can't help the impact his words have on me. It's a shame that I've lived a life where a simple act of human kindness stops my heart with disbelief, as if it's waiting for the Catch. \"Clara…what do you want?\" I closed my eyes, thinking back. What do you want from me? Now he wants to know what I want, and I'm struck dumb. I wanted a lot of things: for Maria to leave me alone, for James to talk to me again, to rewind time back before my attack…like I said, a lot of things. Suddenly exhausted, I sit down beside Don as we both stare silently out at the sinking sun. It would be dark soon, and I couldn't avoid Janie's wrath for my afternoon absence any longer. \"Let's just take it one day at a time,\" I say finally. \"See where that gets us.\" \"One day at a time, hmm?\" He wraps an arm around my waist and pulls me into his chest. This time, I relax in his embrace. \"I think I can do that.\"[Chapter 9] CHAPTER NINE \"What are these rumors I keep hearing about you and Don?\" I hold off searching my locker for my English notes to look up at Lee with a look of disbelief. \"Just rumors, Lee. Don't tell me you believe that I had hot-and-heavy sex with Don on his couch while his Dad watched. I'm pretty sure that was Maria a few months ago…\" \"Doesn't change the fact that everyone knows that you spent an entire afternoon alone with Don Billingsly of all people…Clara what the hell were you thinking, he's trouble?\" Successful in my search, I add the loose sheets of paper inside my History textbook for safekeeping and slam my locker shut. Shrugging my bag onto my shoulder I give her a dark look that only last about two seconds before falling flat. \"Don seems sincere, plus I asked him to just be patient. I'm not trying to rush anything right now, Lee, you know that—I've still got college applications to finish.\" \"Are you still applying to Columbia then?\" I jumped at the opportunity to change the subject. \"Yeah, although I'm sure it's a long-shot—\" Lee snorts and follows me down the hallway as we head for our first period classes. I ignore the stares and whispers that follow me, choosing instead to focus on what LeAnn is saying. \"You and Chavo are the two people most likely to get into whatever college you want. You're so damn smart it's ridiculous.\" \"Still…\" I remark slowly, trying to hide the flush of pleasure on my cheeks, \"the students that apply to Columbia are the cream-of-the-crop at these top notch high schools and with Daddy's bank account in the fine print. I'm not ruling out my chance at a soccer scholarship yet.\" Lee sighs as she reaches her class first. Leaning against the doorway she turns to me and says, \"Don't stress so much about college.\" She turns to leave before, \"And one more thing!\" She pins me with a stare. \"Don't think our talk about Don is over.\" The warning bell signals overhead and I groan in frustration before hiking my bag up my shoulder and running towards my class at the end of the hallway. The second I walk in, however, all conversation ceases and every eye turns in my direction. Thankfully, I've always taken a liking the seat right in front of the teacher's desk, so I slide into my usual spot and drop my bag to the floor, trying to ignore the stares burning holes into the back of my head. \"Slut!\" Someone coughs. I feel my ears burn hot as I take out my notebook. Snickers erupt from around me but I ignore them, flipping slowly to a clean page while mentally running through old soccer plays. It's the best and only defensive strategy I've got to blocking out the world around me, otherwise I might drown in it. However, as the day progressed, it became clear that my sudden haste of leaving with Don the day before was clearly a judgment made rashly. Half-way through the day, I thought I was doing good, considering I hadn't vomited or burst into tears yet. I could ignore the comments that I'm, \"Easy\", \"a Tramp\", and other such words as long as I tried to focus on the lessons at hand or stared straight ahead, pretending as if the words just rolled right off me. Seeing Stasia and LeAnn waiting for me at my locker was like a breath of fresh air, and I felt my breathing loosen. Their faces of concern were apparent, but before they could open their mouths, I waved off their discomfort. \"I'm fine, you guys. Promise.\" \"Doesn't change the fact that I want to kick everyone's asses right now,\" Lee seethed, glaring at those who passed by. \"This has Maria's stank all over it.\" Stasia nodded as I smiled as if unconcerned. Putting in my locker combination, I shook my head and said, \"You two worry too much. Maria has better things to do with her time than start the ninth grade all over—\" I open my locker and my speech falters in horror. Throat constricted, I can only stare at the multitude of condoms that had made their way into my locker and were currently falling like water to the floor, scattering around my feet in shiny waves. \"Oh my God,\" Stasia whispers in horror. I can literally feel the blood drain my face as the hallway falls into a stunned silent. And just as if the Magic Man behind the prank had snapped their fingers, everyone erupted in roars of uncontrolled laughter. Absolute mortification kept me rooted to the spot, one hand still holding the locker door open, the other still hanging limply at my side. Hatred, unlike anything I've ever felt reared i's ugly head, and I almost gasped with the shock of it. And with that hatred, came a sudden wave of shame. No matter how hard I tried, no matter what I prayed to a God that had clearly left me years ago or wished on a star that was never mine, I just couldn't get people to like me long enough to leave me alone. And that's when I felt it. Felt him . Staring at me, watching me, waiting. I turned my head to the left and sure enough, there he was, standing next to Brian and Mike and seemingly frozen in shock. And the longer I stared at Don, the stronger my hatred for him grew. Why didn't he just leave me alone when I asked him to? Why did he feel the compulsion to push his way into my life until his actions resulted in my constant humiliation? Why, why, why, why, WHY? \"Come on, Clara, let's get out of here.\" Any other day, surprise might've kept me from moving, but suddenly, I was more than happy to let James grip my elbow and pull me away down the hallway. … James managed to get me to the front steps of my house before I completely lost it. Suddenly, my knees would no longer support me and I felt myself crumble to a heap. Despite the warm sun, I felt a cold shiver run over my skin and I hugged myself tightly, wishing I could curl up into a ball so small that eventually I would just disappear. James kneeled down beside me, his brown eyes the kindest I've seen them in years. I didn't really care what brought on his change of heart, but suddenly, I didn't want to be around anyone else except the one person who used to always be my confidant and best friend. \"Why d-do th-they h-ha-hate m-me so m-much?\" I gasped for air repeatedly, trying to work air into my lungs, something I've only struggled with after a hard work out. James shook his head slowly, dropping it as if my shame were his own. \"I don't know, Clara. I don't know.\" The last gasp for air seemed to pop the bubble that had grown in my chest. I sobbed into James' chest for what felt like hours. I could hear myself groaning in pain as if I were watching my breakdown, not actually experiencing it. Everything that had happened this year seemed to have built up: the attack at Ratliff and the diner, the beer in my face, every quarrel between James and me, Janie, Don, all of it seemed to only encourage the flow of tears. Each memory brought with it its own sharp pain that I suddenly couldn't bear. I cried myself hoarse, the tears ebbing away as the hiccups slowly began dominating. My eyelids felt puffy, as if they had absorbed as much tears as they had shed. Sniffing, I sat up, wiping my face as best as I could. Humiliation at being caught in such a vulnerable episode gave way to irritation when, the more I hiccupped, the more James seemed to find it amusing to mimic me. I tried to shoot him a deathly stare, but just like on Lee, it didn't last. In fact, I burst out laughing, as if everything I had taken seriously moments before had just become ridiculous. We got inside the house, James making himself comfortable on the couch while I went to wash my face, trying to rid myself of the tear stains on my cheeks and other such grime. After that, James and I talked. We had a lot of catching up to do as well as apologizing, for neither he nor I had been very…kindly (for lack of a better word) the past few years. When a lull in the conversation finally squeezed itself in, James took it upon himself to fill in the blanks that had led us here: \"So what's going on between you and Billingsly?\" I feel a torrid of emotions at his name and none of them really help me answer the question because I don't even know what the hell is really going on. He never actually asked me out yesterday, yet the setting combined with the way he kept touching and holding would tell someone couple , yet after today I'm not sure if I even want to be in the same room as him. It's nothing against him, of course, but…my life is hard enough. \"It's complicated…\" James gives me a hard look commonly used when he wants me to spill more than I actually have. I fidget uncomfortably in my seat until the doorbell breaks his concentration. Jumping up from the couch, I head to the door. \"What are you doing here?\" Brian doesn't exactly look comfortable in his current position, and I'm sure it has something to do with my tone of voice which was currently more hostile than surprised. But at this rate, if the wrong person saw him talking to me, I wouldn't be surprised if I was suddenly a \"two-timing hoe\" or \"sleeping my way through the Permian football team\". Shifting his weight from foot to foot, Brian just shrugs and says, \"Wanted to see if you're alright, I guess.\" \"Is school over?\" Suddenly he breaks out into a wide grin. \"You're not the only top of the class skipping this afternoon.\" I realized the irony and couldn't help but smile. \"It would seem that perfect attendance record has been tarnished this year, but I see no point in you ruining yours.\" \"Can we talk?\" I feel my eyes narrow defensively and without thinking, I take a small step back, ready to close the door. \"About?\" He just gives me a knowing look and I say, \"I'm actually—\" \"Free to talk,\" James says suddenly from behind me. \"I forgot I have an appointment in Midland,\" he adds apologetically. \"Chavo.\" \"Boobie,\" Brian says politely. They both nod their heads in acknowledgement but say nothing else. \"Do you need a ride?\" I ask, almost desperate. I can guess what Brian wants to talk about…or who, to be more specific. James snorts. \"I think I can walk around the corner just fine, Clara.\" I blink stupidly. \"Right.\" With James gone, Brian and I are left standing on the front porch, quiet and avoiding each other's gazes. Not wanting to get caught by nosy neighbors leading Brian in or out my house when I'm alone, I instead choose to sit on the top stair, gazing at the empty street and still houses. Without any gesture from me, Brian sits down beside me, leaving enough space between to keep the feeling informal and friendly. Nothing more, just in case. \"Do you hate him?\" \"Depends, are you asking or is he?\" \"…He is.\" \"Then why isn't he here instead of you?\" \"Because after the look you gave him in the hallway he assumed that you didn't want anything to do with him.\" \"Well, he's right about something.\" I can't keep the bitterness out my voice, and it's so obvious that Brian sighs. \"I'm sorry about what happened today, Clara.\" My anger falters in surprise at the sudden apology. I honestly expected him to defend his friend first. Refusing to look at him, I focus on the street until my vision clears. \"Doesn't matter,\" I say, my voice sounding rough. \"Clara…Don's really sorry—\" \"I do not want to talk about him, okay?\" \"Clara—\" \"You wanna know something, Brian? Yesterday, hanging out with Don, that's the first time I can remember feeling like a normal teenager for the first time in months! Honestly, I had a lot of fun just talking with Don. And after one day—one afternoon !—where I'm actually happy for the first time in my goddamn life, I get labeled a fucking whore by the entire student body! So excuse me for wanting it to end here and not let it continue until we graduate!\" Brian looks so small, and I realize it's because I'm towering over him. I have no idea when I stood up, but once I've finished my outburst and regained my breath, my knees suddenly seem weak from shock. I lean against the porch column, facing the front of my house so that my back is to Brian. I quickly wipe my face. Brian is standing beside me and I shake my head. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to yell.\" \"In retrospect…you had every right to.\" Something in his tone makes me look up, and seeing his brown eyes teasing and playful makes me smile. I'm forming the beginning of a question on my tongue when the absolute worst thing that could happen happens. Brian grasps either side of my face and pulls my forward. I'm sure this kiss itself lasted no more than five seconds max due to my shock and inability to think coherently, but it felt as if the world had suddenly come to abrupt halt. By the time I figure out that I need to push him away, it might as well be too late. I kissed Brian…I kissed Stasia's boyfriend and Don's best friend . I want to cry with the unfairness of it all. Brian looks so pale, as if his body's actions just reached his brain and it couldn't compute what the hell just happened. \"Clara…I…\" I push past him and into my house, slamming the door shut and locking it behind me. Terrified that someone saw, all I can do is stand at the door, horror keeping me from moving until I here Brian's car fire up. I don't look out the window until I no longer hear the sounds of his engine. Tears well up when I realize the damage I've done now. It's hard enough realizing that not only was my first kiss stolen, but it went to someone I hadn't wanted to take it. However, shame, unlike anything I've felt thus far, crept into my heart and nearly stopped it when I realized that, for a few milliseconds, I had kissed him back. … I'm not exactly in a rush, where I'm going. My feet carry me through town in a slow pace, my hands stuffed in the pocket of my varsity soccer letterman's jacket I received at the end of last year's season. The days might have been warm, but that didn't stop the desert nights from reminding Odessa it's nearly the end of October. It took me all afternoon to muster up the courage to face him. Sorting through the haze of my mind, it took me hours to realize that what happened between Brian and me had been nothing more than a mistake (at least on my part). There's no denying that Brian is a great guy and a safe choice, but I wasn't going to fake the disappointment either. Lately, I had been fantasizing about the idea of Don kissing me. The very idea alone usually sent my heart racing to the point that it felt as though I had been running. But I also had no idea how I could face him knowing I had momentarily willingly kissed his best friend. Hence, why I walked the quiet town streets at one in the morning. Bad idea? Sure it was, but I couldn't sleep until I talked to him. I turned on what I knew to be his street and was stunned when, in the semi-darkness, he flew out of his house. I almost called out to him when another figure coming out stopped me. He grabbed Don's arm so violently that the places where I had been grabbed weeks before winced in sympathy. \"Where the fuck you think you goin' boy? I ain't finished talkin' to ya.\" Mr. Billingsly voice was low, but the street was so quiet it just carried. I knew I should've turned around a left…if I got caught staring I could get into trouble. But I was transfixed at the sight before me, and I could no longer feel my feet. \"Let. Fucking. Go.\" \"Get your ass back in this house boy, I ain't finished—\" \"Fuck you!\" Don's head seemed to snap to the side. The hit was so quick that it took me a moment to realize that his father had punched him…hard. My hands covered my mouth, fingers shaking. The sudden urge to run to him took a whole lot of self-control to fight. \"You wanna leave, fine. Leave. And don't come back, either.\" He emphasizes his point by slamming the front door. Don seems to struggle back to his feet, the blow to his cheek having nearly brought him to his knees. I'm watching his retreating figure when I start jogging to catch up. He's moving quickly, and it takes me a minute to catch up to his long strides. However, I reach him quickly enough and touch his arm. He jerks violently as if expecting the worst. Turning, I catch a quick glimpse of pure anger on his face and I blink and it's gone. Replaced by surprise at seeing me instead of whoever he was expecting. Neither of us say anything, but when I begin to lead him in the opposite direction, he follows. Janie's working the night shift as usual, so the house is as quiet upon my return as it was when I left it. Don follows me in, his presence in my home heavy and I suddenly feel my unease kick in. \"Why did you bring me here?\" Without facing him, I shrug. I turn on the kitchen light and turn. Already a bruise is forming along the corner of his mouth where he was hit, and his lower lip is cut. \"I'll get you some ice.\" I fill a bag and wrap a dish towel around it before handing it to Don. He takes it slowly, his eyes lingering on me for a few seconds. \"Do you need to take something? Do you want something to drink?\" He's still looking at me and I swallow a bout of nerves. I lick my lips and suddenly find myself staring at his. I look back up at him and he begins to move in, slowly, as if giving me time to say, \"No\" or turn my head. But I don't do either of those things, because I want nothing more than for him to kiss me. One hand clutches my cheek, his thumb stroking my cheek gently. I close my eyes. The first touch is so soft, I barely feel it. \"Don?\" Then his mouth covers mine, catching his name on my lips. He pushes himself against me, and I can feel his head tilt as he tries for better access. Eager, I push back hard. He hisses, pulling away and touching his lip. I blush. \"I'm so-sorry,\" I stutter, excitement getting me carried away. He just smiles and shakes his head. \"I'm not.\" He kisses me again, and this time I feel my heart rate spike into a zone that can't be good for my health. I can tell that Don is working hard to restrain himself, because his hands, although roaming along my arms and hips and waist, never stray anyplace else. Feeling more daring than I ever have, I throw one arm around his neck and pull him closer, my other hand holding his cheek softly so as not to aggravate his bruise. He pulls away, but not by much. He kisses my jawline all the way back to the spot right below my ear and gently bites down on a small area of flesh before he runs his tongue over it. I know he did this to mess with me because when I let out a gasp of surprise and—I'll admit—lust, I can feel his body shake with his laughter. \"Ass,\" I mumble under my breath. He snorts and lifts his face up to mine. He captures my lips, but I can feel his smile. When we pull away for the last time, both Don and I are breathing loudly, our chest moving in sync with each breath. Eyes shining and faces flushes, we both look like kids on Christmas morning. He tucks a strand of my hair behind my ear and suddenly I fit of giggles overcomes me, and I can't help myself. I burst out into laughter, some of it nerves and some of it just adrenaline and excitement. Don stares at me for a moment, snorting in disbelief at my unexplained behavior, rolling his eyes at my uncontrolled emotions, before finally caving and joining in himself.[Chapter 10] CHAPTER TEN The next morning I sat in my car in the parking lot of the high school for what felt like hours. Each time I thought I had mustered enough courage to get out a group of people would spot me and point and laugh. Last night with Don…well, I had forgotten everything that lead up to him kissing me. But now, not only did I have to face the entire student body (who all, by now, I'm sure knew about the condoms) but Brian and Stasia. Together. I suddenly felt nauseous with nerves. I hadn't even told Don what had transpired between me and his best friend, and it was stupid of me to think I was brave enough to. But now I had to act normal in front of everyone and I felt so wired with stress that I wouldn't be surprised if the smallest thing set me off. I wondered if Brian felt this nervous but immediately shook the thought from my head. Any thought of him now felt like a betrayal to Don and Stasia. I heavy hand slammed on the driver's window and I screamed so loudly that the person outside the car started screaming. \"Jesus Christ, Clara,\" LeAnn breathed, clutching her chest. \"What the hell are you trying to do, give me a heart-attack?\" \"Me?\" I step out my car and slam my door. \"You couldn't knock politely? You had to go slam your hand against my damn window?\" \"You were out of it; you didn't even hear me knocking!\" I lean against my truck and continue breathing. \"Are you alright, though? You looked worried about something?\" \"I'm fine,\" I lie. My voice cracks and I clear it self-consciously. Lee stares at me as I suggest that we head inside. As the snickers follow me Lee wraps an encouraging arm around my shoulders and I feel myself lean into her for support. Stasia is leaning against my locker, a small smile on my face. I can't help but feel as though she's been here for a while watching my locker for repeat offenders. I'm a terrible, terrible person. \"Hey, Sweetie,\" she says gently. She hugs me, squeezing tightly. \"Hey, Stasia.\" I cautiously put in my locker combination, expecting pregnancy test or something this time. But my locker is empty except for my school supplies. I grab what I need and put up what I don't. Just as I shut my door I hear someone calling my name. I turn to see a face I don't recognize. I automatically expect the worst, as it's a guy wearing a humorous grin surrounded by his friends with the same facial expression. \"You dropped these yesterday!\" He threw several shimmery packets into the air. Some hit me in the face and some landed at my feet. His posse roared with laughter as I bent down to pick up my bag. LeAnn and Stasia had both taken a step forward when I mutter under my breath so only they can hear, \"Leave it alone. There's no point.\" … \"Can we go, please?\" I beg, my neck burning as the snickers and stares linger on me. Seated beside LeAnn and Stasia in the cafeteria at our usual spot leaves me open for further ridicule from the entire student body who hasn't had the opportunity just yet. \"Clara, you can't let these assholes win,\" Lee whispers under her breath. \"Hiding out in the library isn't going to make it any easier.\" \"As much as I hate to say it, LeAnn's right,\" Stasia adds over a mouthful of salad. \"Besides, what's the worst that can happen?\" I don't bother to fill them in on my classmates' ideas of a joke. Instead I stare mournfully at my leftover pasta from last night as if it too had just thrown a handful of condoms in my face. \"Hey, baby.\" I look up and nearly puke as Brian sits down next to Stasia. He avoids looking at me and just wraps his arm around Stasia's waist, kissing her cheek. \"Hey, Slutly Muttly,\" Maria says with a laugh as she sidles up to the table, blue eyes bright with mischief. \"Did you like my little surprise yesterday?\" \"Absolutely, I just hate you had to waste your entire supply on me.\" \"I don't mind,\" she says smoothly. \"I would just hate for you to get pregnant or something. Wouldn't want you to make the same mistake your mother did seventeen years ago.\" I can tell she's been thinking up that one for a while now. And that hatred I felt yesterday comes back with a burning passion as Maria walks away, golden tendrils of hair falling down her back as she throws her head in laughter. I don't know if I'm more pissed that she brought Janie into this or just the fact that I'm sick and tired of her bullshit. But it doesn't matter. \"Hey, Maria!\" She turns around, not realizing that I've followed her to nearly the exact spot where I accidentally ran into her two days ago. Huh? Looks like fate has a funny way of being ironic. She turns, confusion written across her features until she sees what's in my hand. She only has a split moment to register my actions when I'm throwing LeAnn's slice of chocolate cake into her face—it was the closest thing to me. And to really let the message sink in, I grab the back of her head so that she can't move and just rub the plate across her face. When I finally let my hand drop, Maria's appears to be in too much shock to say anything. But I'm not. Years of pent up emotion have been leading up to this moment. The moment where I would set Maria straight and tell her how her years of torment have devastated me from the inside out. But the longer I stand there, watching her try her damnest not to cry, I feel nothing but disgust that I wound up sinking to her level. There's absolutely no satisfaction—like a cake to the face really beats out condoms in a locker or years of emotional abuse—and I feel…empty. Damn my conscious. Without thinking, I grab Maria by the elbow and begin to drag her towards the doors. I hadn't realized that so many were laughing but the last thing I felt was accomplished. Maria, seemingly stunned, didn't fight me. I just led her to the bathroom and said, \"Get cleaned up.\" She walks to the sink in silence and practically dunks her entire head under the faucet. It doesn't take long to get the chocolate out of her hair and face, but her shirt is completely ruined. In my anger-induced haze, I didn't realize how far I had spread the chocolate. It seemed as though her entire front was covered. Hating myself all the more for what I was about to do, I unzip my jacket and hand it to her. \"I don't want your fucking charity.\" \"And I don't want your fucking attitude, but here we are,\" I snap. She dries her face with a paper towel, eyeing me hatefully all the while. Whatever. Then she snatches my jacket out my hand but before I can blink, she's standing in one of the stalls. I watch in open-mouthed shock as she flushes my jacket, clogging the toilet and causing the water to overflow. \"Go to hell, Clara.\" Maria bumps into my shoulder on her way out, and I just snap. \"What the fuck is wrong with you, you psychotic bitch?\" But she doesn't look back and she doesn't respond. Leaving me, standing in the doorway of the bathroom, wondering why I even bother. … It's nearly midnight when I hear a faint tapping on my window. At first I think nothing of it, continuing to read ahead in my history textbook until the tapping worsens, forcing me to think that either someone really needs to talk to me or they're really bad at breaking in. I lay my pencil down and stretch my fingers as I stand up and walk to the window. I pull back my curtain before lifting the blinds on my window halfway. Surprise fills me as I open the window. \"Don…what…?\" \"I wanted to see you…can I come in?\" \"Through the window?\" I ask slowly, confused. \"Well I don't think your mom would mind if I just walked through the front door.\" \"Actually, Janie's not here. She's working.\" \"Oh.\" \"…\" \"…\" \"Do you want me to meet you 'round back?\" \"Yeah, that'll work.\" He walks away from the window and I stand there for a little longer, moderately confused and stunned at his bold approach. I close the window and return the blinds and curtain to their normal state before heading to the back doors to let Don in. He walks in, surveying the dining room and living room with interest. Practically ignoring me, he goes to the multitude of picture frames Janie set up on the wall, TV stand, coffee table…as if looking at the room from a stranger's point of view, I guess we did have a lot of photos. \"So it's just you and your mom?\" I stay where I'm at, arms crossed nervously, as if he's examining Janie and I. \"Yep.\" He picks up a frame from the table in front of him and stares at it a while, a small smile on his lips. I fidget. He sets the photo down and continues on his lackluster journey through my house. As he enters the hallway, I begin to follow a few steps behind, my nervousness slowly becoming a sort of curiosity. He spies my open bedroom door and just waltzes in. I swallow, fearing his intentions and I drag behind. Leaning against my door frame, I find him doing the same thing. He's standing in the middle of my room and I suddenly realize just how big he really is in comparison. He looks at my various championship trophies and MVP medals from past, successful soccer seasons. He eyes the photos of me and Janie; me and LeAnn; and (more recently) me, LeAnn, and Stasia. He goes to my bookcase and fingers the spine of a few. I nearly burst with his silence, especially when I see his lips twitch, as if laughing at some amusing joke only he knows. But I force my silence. Finally, he sits down on my bed and looks at me. I force myself to stare back, but I'm reminded of our stare-down at the Feed, and I feel my heart race under his intense gaze. He smiles at me. \"Hi.\" Something in me, like a dam, breaks. Suddenly, my nerves are gone. I bite my lip, trying to hide my smile. \"Hi.\" … \"You know, I think this is the longest conversation we've had without you insulting me.\" I swallow the Oreo I had been in the middle of chewing. \"I have not insulted you every single conversation we've had,\" I retort as I reach for another cookie. \"Pass the peanut butter.\" Don slides the container towards me. \"Well let's look back, shall we.\" \"Fine.\" \" You of all people would not have the slightest fucking clue how to work the damn Dewey Decimal System ,\" he mimics (I'm pretty sure almost verbatim) in a high pitch. \"I do not sound like that,\" I say with a laugh. \"And besides, I apologized for the way I acted.\" \"Oh yes you do, and it still counts: you insulted my intelligence.\" He grabs a handful of chips. \"Whatever, next convo.\" \"Let's see,\" he taps his chin thoughtfully with the hand not currently holding food, \"I believe that would be when I helped you to your car because I'm chivalrous….Ah yes! You mentioned how my so-called \"reputation\" precedes me and then acted as though I was playing you on a joke…which I think you've accused me of twice.\" I frown. \"And then you rudely turned me down for a date.\" \"That's not an insult!\" I scoff. He snorts. \"It is to me.\" I roll my eyes. \"And then the next time, you…\" I'm licking the peanut butter off my spoon and look up when I realize he's not going to finish his sentence. At first I assumed he's just trying to remember, but he refused to look at me and his face seems really red. I frown. Did I do something? I think back to the next conversation we had after he asked me out. I realize it was the bonfire party…after James injured his knee because Maria threw her beer in my face and Don offered me a ride home. We were going to stop for dinner when he pulled over because of something I said… \"Oh,\" I say with a blush, remembering. \"Yeah…\" I fidget nervously, but not because I'm embarrassed. I recall how it felt to lie in his arms wrapped around my waist. I remember how his chest felt moving underneath me, slowing as he caught his breath from our horseplay. And remembering that I had somehow, in that time span, apparently managed to arouse Don made me flush with a bit of pride. It felt nice to be desired. I smile softly, reaching up and brushing my fingers across my lips. I can still feel the pressure of Don's kiss from last night. The way his body pressed up against mine as he wrapped one arm crushingly around my waist while his other hand tangled itself in my hair. \"Err…Clara?\" I blink, having forgotten that Don was even there. He's smiling cockily at me, his momentary abashness gone. And when I realize my fingers are still on my lips, I drop them quickly and divert my gaze. For once, I would just like to be as suave as LeAnn or as sexy as Stasia. Instead, I somehow manage to continue to make myself look like a jackass in front of the first boy to ever show any kind of interest in me. (Brian does not count, nor will he ever). A sudden shyness overcomes me; nothing like the usual anger, frustration, confusion, or even bout of nerves that I tend to feel around Don. This is something else. This is me, a girl, realizing that Don, a boy, are sitting alone in my bedroom with no adult around. I sneak a peek at Don through my lashes. And suddenly all the features I've never bothered to notice just suddenly jump out at me. The way his simple tee fits him, hugging the curves of muscles on his arms and accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow hips. Or his large hands, that always seems to find their way around my waist as of late. The way the corners of his eyes crinkle when he's sincerely smiling, or the way his green eyes seem to see the real me, and not the me the rest of Odessa seems to see—and yet still seems to find some part of me desirable. The way his dirty-blonde hair curls around his ears in the most adorable fashion, always looking as though he did nothing more than roll out of bed. Or the feel of his lips, hungrily pressed against mine. And most importantly, the way, without even realizing it, I've slowly lowered my defenses around him, my wariness about his intentions slipping away the more he proved he had my back, even if it risked being mocked in front of his peers later. I fidget again, but this time the strange sensation doesn't leave me. My stomach feels as though it's in knots, but that isn't what's bothering me. No, this feeling is lower and the more I think about Don the stronger it gets. It makes my heart race and my skin burn. Don's looking at me, and his eyes seem to reflect the sudden hunger and desire that's overcome me. I uncurl but Don is faster and reaches me in a millisecond. He's on top of me, pinning me to my own rug, and kissing me with such amped up passion that I hope I'm returning in the same eagerness. He moves his body between my legs and that feeling heightens to a near pleasant burning sensation. I want to harness this feeling and find a way to feel it every second of every day. Not knowing what to do with my hands, I mimic his actions last night, roaming the contours of his arms or feeling his abs through his tee. If Stasia could see me now she'd be so proud. I run my fingers through his hair, loving the feel of the smooth, thick strands slipping through my grasp. I feel something smooth and wet run across my lower lip, and I hesitate only a moment before parting my lips. As if sensing my hesitation, Don slows down a bit as his tongue enters my mouth. A rush unlike anything I've felt so far overwhelms my senses. All the pre-notions growing up about how nasty Frenching would be vanish the second his tongue brushes against mine. It feels so naughty and sexual, something I never saw myself doing, that I feel like an adrenaline junkie, feeding off what Don's throwing at me and harvesting it to up my own antics. Suddenly my body takes over and my mind is no longer in control. I can't lie to myself anymore, so I won't. Don's got me so aroused that whenever his thigh presses itself against my crotch I want to let out a cry of lust. I know we're moving too fast…we technically haven't even been on a date yet. But it's so, so hard to stop. And I don't want to. I break away. \"Don…\" I begin, preparing to tell him we have to stop. But he just thinks I'm asking for more, because suddenly his lips are on my neck and I feel my eyes close at the pleasure of his teeth teasing my flesh, of his tongue running over it. My breathing is so ragged it's shaky at best. I have to get control of the situation. I take a deep breath and strengthen my voice. \"Don!\" He jumps, pulling away from me until he's hovering above me, eyes alive and face flushed. \"What is it, did I do something wrong?\" The phrase ' If this is wrong I don't wanna be right' pops into my head, but thankfully I know better than to say it aloud. \"N-n-no,\" I stutter, my moment of resolve gone the second I see how he looks caught up in the mood. And the fact that I did that makes it ten times more attractive. I clear my throat. \"But we can't…I can't…you know I could never go any further than this right now, right?\" For a moment, some of the light leaves his eyes in disappointment. A wave of guilt washes over me before he shakes his head. \"I know…but goddamn it, Clara. You're not gonna make this easy on me.\" I snort. \"Shouldn't you be used to this sort of thing.\" \"Well I see your sarcasm is back, hello old friend,\" he teases with a smile. I roll my eyes when his fingers tilt my chin, gently turn my gaze back to his. He stares at me, almost longingly it seems, his fingers stroking my jaw and neck. But unlike when he touched my neck, I have no fears that Don would hurt me. \"You're beautiful,\" he whispers, his voice so low and husky it's almost inaudible and I nearly miss it. I blush, that sudden shyness returning. Unable to meet his gaze, I occupy myself by fiddling with his shirt that hangs a bit loose now that he's hovering over me. I rub the fabric between my fingers, but I can't hide the smile that Don's compliment created. \"I find you fascinating,\" he mumbles, almost as if he's thinking out loud. I frown in confusion and intrigue. \"Do tell.\" \"You ask me all the time, why? Well, that's why,\" he explains. He rolls over so that he's lying on his back next to me, both of us staring at my ceiling. \"That day in the library…the first time we talked…\" \"Yeah?\" \"I'd never seen so much anger in someone before,\" he whispers, almost as if expecting me to get upset and begin shouting back. But curiosity at what he was saying made me hold my tongue. \"You were so defensive I could actually see you trying to barricade yourself by insulting me. And the bruises…but something about you impressed me that day and it wasn't until recently that I realized what it was.\" I hadn't realized that I had rolled onto my side, my elbow propped up and my head resting in the palm of my hand. I was literally drinking in his words and leaned in, as if I might miss what he would say next. \"What was it?\" \"How strong you are,\" he says. Then he turns to look at me, and the impact of his words and his eyes are so strong that I feel myself lean back. I shake my head. \"That's sweet, Don, but I'm not strong. Strong people fight their own battles; they don't rely on their friends or their mothers to do it for them.\" I'm silent a moment. I'm a coward . \"Is that really what you think?\" Don scoffs. \"You're not a coward, Clara, you're one of the bravest people I know.\" I blush, not realizing I had spoken that last part. \"Then why can't I stand up to Maria without feeling guilty? Why do I let her and everyone else continue to walk over me and treat me like crap, huh?\" \"Because you're the bigger person,\" he says simply, as if that was the most obvious answer. I snort. \"Well, being the bigger person sucks. It gets you labeled Slutly Muttly and condoms thrown at you in the school hallway.\" \"Clara…\" \"It gets some asshole following you into the library asking how much for a quickie behind the desk—\" \"Clara, stop—\" \"I'm going to graduate the laughing stock of Odessa and there's nothing I can do about it.\" I'm horrified to hear my voice crack, but I clear my throat as if nothing's wrong and manage to regain my composure. I finger my frayed carpet. \"Have you ever…wanted something so bad but no matter how hard you tried, it never seemed within reach or if it was something snatched it back?\" \"Every damn day.\" I find the courage to look at Don and I'm surprised to see that he's sitting up now, his gaze focused on his fingers. His jaw is clenched tightly. But it's the anger and sadness in his eyes that gives away his thoughts. \"I'm so sorry,\" I say quickly, a blush of shame warming my cheeks. \"God, you must be so sick and tired of hearing me bitch and complain about my life when you—\" \"Don't mention it,\" he interrupts, laughing as if it's nothing. But the smile doesn't reach his eyes. I swallow nervously, wondering how far I'm allowed to push. \"Does anyone know?\" \"The whole fucking town, I'm sure,\" he retorts bitingly. He's working his jaw, grinding his teeth so tightly I can hear them squealing in protest. I've upset him, obviously, with thoughts of his father. I feel as though I should do something, I mean, he's been comforting me as of late, it's the least I could do. I stand up, but he hardly seems to notice. I kneel behind him, wrapping my arms around his neck and pressing my cheek to his. He doesn't move for a while, but I can feel him start to relax. I've been so wrapped up in myself and my issues that I didn't bother to see how everyone around me was dealing with their own shit. I never talked to Don about his father, assuming that he didn't want to talk about it, just like I avoided conversation with James, my own cousin, for years out of a stupid jealousy-induced rivalry. And clearly, they were people who had been hurting. Don suddenly reached out and touched my arm and then clenched it. Not roughly, but tightly enough as if to say, \"Don't let go.\"[Chapter 11] CHAPTER ELEVEN A week passed, and every single night Don came to visit me. They weren't as heated as his first tromp through my house. In fact, Don seemed to be trying to stay on his best behavior, giving me a space and time to get use to the fact that I was actually in a relationship. With a guy. I felt bad, forcing Don to keep us a secret, but I wasn't ready to face the public. I could tell Don didn't give a rat's ass, but he respected me enough to wait. I told him once State's loomed a bit closer, I would be ready. That left me one more game, against Midland, and if we beat them, the playoffs. I'm pretty sure Don was counting down the days. \"Tell me something,\" he commands. I readjust myself. We're sitting in a strange position on my bed where we're both curled up, but his head is resting on my thighs and vice versa so that we can still look each other in the eyes as we talk. He fiddles with the hem of my tee and looks up at me. \"What?\" \"Anything. Nothing.\" He grins at me. \"Something naughty.\" I snort. \"You're barking up the wrong tree there.\" I shrug my shoulders. \"My favorite color's green.\" \"Boooooo—\" \"Jesus, why are you so loud?\" I feign anger, but I can't help but laugh. \"That's boring, give me something juicy.\" He waggles his brows. \"Give me something to think about at night—\" I punch him in the arm \"—Ouch, fine! What about something that no one else knows about you?\" I begin to laugh, but the very idea of what he's asking makes my stomach twist. My smile falters as all the dirty little secrets of my life begin to make their way to the forefront. I know who attacked me , I think. But no, I don't want to cause a scandal amidst football season. There's my relationship with Janie or my lack of a relationship with my father, whom I've never met. Who I don't even have a picture of — \"All my life, I've wanted to play football, like my dad,\" Don says suddenly. I look up and find him staring at me, those beautiful green eyes holding me. \"Said it would make a man outta me. That's why I moved to Odessa in middle school…to play football.\" \"Hmm, little did a young Billingsley know that he would soon lay eyes on the most beautiful maiden of all the land, swept off his feet at the first insult that masked only her dearest affections,\" I tease in my best Shakespeare. It has the desired effect of making him laugh, my entire bed shaking. \"If that's what you wanna call it, be my guest,\" he chuckles. He grows serious though. \"It's hard, being the son of a Permian legend…a Permian who managed to make it all the way to State's—and win—without dropping the goddamn ball.\" His bitter tone is hardly hidden behind his nonchalant mask and sarcastic laugh. \"But…you love football too, right?\" I ask slowly. \"Of course,\" he begins, gazing out of my window. The lights are off and the street is dark, so I'm not worried about anyone peeking in. \"Every guy on the team has some part of him that loves the game—you have to if you want to play football down here.\" I nod, sitting up as he talks. He readjusts himself in my lap, but doesn't seem to really notice that I've moved. I hesitate only for a second. I'm the least forward of us. But I bring my fingers to his hairline and stroke his messy hair back. I do this repeatedly until I feel his breathing lighten and his body relaxing. He continues talking. \"It just gets frustrating, sometimes…\" I don't know how long he talks or how long I listen, silently stroking his hair from his face with gentle caresses. It's rather soothing, actually, to not talk about myself for a change. He talks of some of his practices from growing up with a fondness, and I find myself laughing or asking questions, but otherwise, I just let him get it off his chest. I don't realize his silence for a while. I look down, expecting him to be staring at me and say, \"You're turn\". Instead, I find his eyes closed and his breathing light and even. He fell asleep. I want to laugh at the idea that he bored himself to sleep, but I remain quiet, admiring his features in the soft moonlight. I don't have the heart to wake him up, besides, it's only Saturday. It takes me a while to get him in what I hope is a comfortable enough position because I'm trying to be quiet, but I manage. But he must be one of those deep sleepers because at one point I knocked his leg off the bed and all he did was grunt in his sleep before rolling over and taking up what little space I did have on my twin-sized mattress. \"This is gonna be cozy,\" I whisper under my breath. I have half a mind to sleep on the couch, but if Janie sees me she's bound to know something's up. But it's too soon to just climb into bed with Don. Even though the idea alone is tempting. Really tempting. Aw hell… Just to make sure Janie doesn't come barging in, I lock my door. No…then she might get worried. Damn, how do kids my age pull this off? I'm already getting a migraine and Don and I aren't even doing anything. I leave the door unlocked. I've been a straight A student since kindergarten, I don't drink, I don't smoke, God knows I'm a virgin…I think I'll allow myself tonight. I change into my pajamas in the bathroom. I suddenly realize that I probably should've swung for something other than flannel and a ragged tee, but I never assumed I would need to shop for sexy pajamas. I stare at myself in the mirror, taking deep breaths. \"You got this,\" I whisper to myself. \"He already likes you, just…relax.\" I smile with giddiness as I head back to my room. Don is exactly where I left him and I can't help but bite my lip at the idea of lying next to him. I feel stupid, like a little school girl with a crush. But these late night rendezvous' with Don have been the highlight of my days, and I can only assume the same for him considering he keeps coming back. I fold up my jeans and tee and put them in the closet. I close my window and dump my room into sheer darkness, save for what little light the moon is trying to push through. I try to give both of us some space by lying down close to the wall. Just as I'm getting comfortable, I feel a warm breath on my ear. \"You spoil me. Get up real quick.\" I raise my body and Don pulls my sheets down before pulling them back up over the both of us. Then he wraps an arm around my waist and pulls us close together. My head comes to the top of his chin, but the way he curls his body around mine you would think we just fit together. \"I told you, I don't bite.\" He kisses my shoulder once before getting relaxed again. It doesn't take long for his breathing to even out and he's asleep. And after a while, so am I. … \"We need to have a girls' night,\" Stasia proclaims from the candy aisle. \"What do you call this?\" LeAnn retorts from the drinks. \"Three girls shopping at a gas station. Not exactly facials and mani-pedis.\" \"That sounds fun,\" I say, coming to stand beside Stasia with my chips and soda. \"When?\" \"How 'bout this weekend? Friday? The guys will be playing Midland, we can have it at my house as we watch the game.\" I shrug. \"Sounds good to me. Lee?\" \"I'm in if you are,\" she sighs coming to stand on Stasia's other side. We pay for our things, but just as we're headed out, someone else is headed in. \"Ladies.\" Instinctively, I pull myself behind LeAnn, not that she notices. \"Hey, Austin, I haven't seen you in a while. How are you?\" \"I've been good—\" \"You're that Baker girl, right? \" \"—been keeping busy with football—\" \"Who the fuck have you told?\" \"—and school, the usual.\" \"Yeah, I bet. I think you know Clara, have you met Stasia?\" I don't know how long we stand there with Lee and Him making polite chit-chat, but finally I hear them give their parting-of-the-ways speeches before his footsteps begin to exit my vision. I follow his walk, my eyes rising the further he gets. But he's already looking at me as he walks away. He blows me a kiss and a wink. I'll never forget the smile on his face. I try to muster up as much loathing as possible into my expression. And even though my skin crawls the longer he looks me over and even though my hands shake and my skin burns on the spots where he's hit and grabbed me, I refuse to be the coward any longer. I hold his gaze as I push the door open with my back, only breaking contact when I have to turn towards the car. … Stasia had just finished straightening my hair when we reached halftime on the game against Midland. \"We're gonna lose,\" Lee mumbles in defeat. \"Not necessarily, we can still turn it around,\" I add helplessly, not really believing it. Watching Don drop the ball hurts a lot more now that I know his story, his pressure. \"You're such a hopeless romantic,\" Lee criticizes. \"We're getting creamed out there.\" \"You guys are so dramatic,\" Stasia croons. \"All done, Clara!\" I go to move myself off the pillow when she goes, \"NOT YET! We still have to do makeup.\" \"But we're not going anywhere.\" I protest. \"Seriously? Have you ever been to a girls' night out slumber party before, Clara?\" \"No.\" \"…Well, I'm glad I popped your slumber party cherry.\" I laugh at that as we settle in for the final half. Stasia's doing my eye shadow when Lee goes, \"Holy shit, is that Boobie on the field?\" My eyes fly open to Stasia's displeasure. Sure enough, I spot number forty-five jogging on the field. The worst kind of feeling sinks into my gut. LeAnn turns to look at me. \"Clara, you told me that his knee still didn't look any better for today's game. That it still seemed to be causing him pain.\" I shake my head in disbelief. When James told me that the Midland Lee doctor had cleared him to play, I had thought something was wrong. ACL's are very, very serious business. I was sure that he had been lying, but watching him walk onto the field surprised me. I mean, surely if Gaines had avoided putting him in the entire game he knew in his gut that James was not fully recovered. Lee looks from me then back to the game. \"Yeah…\" she says slowly, \"we're gonna lose.\" And when James gets carried off the field with just over a minute left in the game, I'm beginning to think she's right. Janie is gonna kill her brother in the morning for sending her nephew out there. Stasia doesn't come anywhere near my face the rest of the game. Lee and I are too busy shouting at the TV. We get a first down, a second, a third, but we need a touchdown and the clock has less than twenty seconds. \"Oh my God,\" Lee exclaims, \"my hands are shaking I'm so nervous.\" \"Come on, Mike, you've got it,\" I whisper, fingers crossed so tightly I feel as though they might break. We have less than three seconds when, \"Holy fuck! He dropped the ball!\" \"Wait, Lee, he recovered, he's passing it, we're gonna….!\" The word win freezes in my throat. \" …and it's too high !\" the announcer exclaims. It literally hurts my chest to watch Midland Lee run across the field, victorious. My mouth falls open as we stand there in stunned silence. Well me anyway, Lee is pacing furiously and swearing harshly. \"What does that mean, are we not going to the playoffs,\" Stasia asks. \"We're tied,\" Lee says with frustration. \"A fucking three-way coin toss is supposed to determine who's worthy when we fucking deserve to go!\" Stasia looks at me as I sit back down on the pillow where she's been working on me. I feel guilty. Clearly she's not as into football as Lee and I are (born and bred fans, you can't outgrow it) and I shoot her a smile. \"Well aren't you gonna finish my make-up?\" Stasia has just told me to go look at myself in her bathroom mirror when her house phone rings. She runs to answer it and I stand in her bathroom, flipping the light on and nearly turning it back off, but not because what I see is awful. I'm truly speechless. Stasia is some kind of miracle worker. I hadn't paid my hair much attention because of the game, but now….It's practically at my stomach, it's so much longer. And soft to the touch. The smallest nod of my head sends my dark tendrils flying. And if I push my hair away, it falls gently back into place. And my make-up…I've never worn make-up before, but Stasia somehow managed to make my eyes stand out with simple natural browns. But my lips are a rosy red, making them see full and sexy and my teeth seem pure white. I don't know who this creature is looking back at me, but she's beautiful. \"You like it?\" \"Stasia, I…thank you.\" She smiles, pleased, as she cleans up her magical instruments. I finger my hair giddily as I go sit beside LeAnn who looks so dejected that you would think she was on the football team. \"We were so close,\" she whines. I rub her back with my other hand and just let her get it out her system. Normally, I would be livid—it sucks being an inch from the playoffs. But we still had one more shot: the coin toss. That and…I think my late night talks with Don are changing my perception of the game. I mean, sure, I went to school with these boys for years—the once star athlete is my cousin for godssake. But I never really thought of the pressure to make every play perfect. To win every game. As an athlete I should understand, but the soccer team doesn't exactly pull the same turnout as the football team. \"So what should we do now?\" Stasia questions as she comes to sit beside me. \"Um, I'm the virgin, why are you asking me?\" LeAnn snorts and I slap her on the back. \"Christ Clara, what the hell?\" \"What?\" I ask innocently. \"You weren't choking?\" She slides away from me, mumbling under her breath and I smile. Turning to Stasia I say, \"We could go grab a bite. I'm hungry.\" \"Wanna go to David's place? It shouldn't be too crowded since everyone will be too upset to go out.\" \"Sounds good to me,\" I say with a nonchalant shrug. The less people, the better. … Wishful thinking is for saps. We watched long enough to witness our success in the coin toss and somehow failed to anticipate the celebratory demeanor of the town. Everyone had come out tonight. It seemed as though the entire high school was out, and it was only when I saw a flash of Ivory hovering over everyone that I realized the team must have come out to celebrate. And wherever they were, so was the party. \"Maybe we should just turn around,\" I pitch, staring nervously at the throngs of people seated on cars and tables and chairs and loitering around, chatting. \"Why should we, we have just as much right to be here as anyone else?\" Stasia said defensively. \"It's not you two I'm worried about.\" \"Stop being so damn dramatic, Clara,\" Lee snaps. I bite back a retort as she climbs out the car. Stasia gives me a sympathetic look before following suit, and I contemplate sitting in the backseat of the car until their return until warily climbing out, hoping to make myself as small as possible. Pulling my denim jacket tighter around my figure, I lower my gaze as we near the crowd of kids. Most people gaze over us, hardly noticing three more bodies to the seventy or so already crammed at the diner. But I can't help but feel the eyes of some, and Stasia only confirms this when she whispers in my ear, \"They can't take their eyes of you!\" In my experience, that's not a good thing, but since no food or drink or insult has been hurled my way, I force my gaze up to find that Stasia's partly right. \"The guys are totally checking you out!\" I blush as we get in line to place our orders. The place sounds like a hive: the only discernible noise is a low buzz of conversation with the occasional burst of laughter. Spirits are soaring with the prospects of playoffs looming. I wonder briefly how life would be if I was actually a part of the conversation, moving from group to group, laughing, joking, and listening to my peers. Fitting in. This thought brings with it a wave of loneliness. I love LeAnn and Stasia, but the realization that out of thousands of people I'm only openly accepted by handful is disheartening. I suddenly feel so out of place that I have half a mind to race home and bury myself in bed or in studies, like I always do on Friday nights. \"Lookin' good, Baker.\" I set my jaw, fingers automatically curling into a fist as I brace myself for the worst. Turning around, I find Austin leering at me. He openly looks me up and down, and I feel my resolve shrink a little under his predatory stare. \"Thanks,\" I mutter. I turn around when he says, \"Who you tryin' to impress?\" \"None of your business.\" \"Kitty grow some claws now that she's surrounded by her little friends?\" He whispers this in my ear, standing so close that I can feel his hot breath on my ear. I flinch, but try not to show my disgust…or fear. I stare ahead resolutely and Austin, frustrated with my silence, sinks his fingers into my upper arm. I have to clench my teeth to keep from gasping in pain. \"This ain't over, Baker.\" He slinks away, my arm throbbing and likely bruised. I close the space that appeared as the line moved forward and look up just as Lee turns to face me. \"You know what you want?\" I swallow before shaking my head. \"I'm actually not that hungry anymore. I'll go find us a table.\" I dart off before Lee can protest to my sudden change in attitude. I stumble around awkwardly, ignoring the looks from my peers. I don't know if they're stunned quiet by my physical appearance or my second appearance at a social event. Either way, I'm left alone as I walk around trying to find some kind of space where we can sit down. \"Hey, Clara!\" I hear my name, but it takes me a moment to locate the source. I catch Mike standing, his hand lifted in the air to catch my attention. He waves me over, and I blush as the stares increase as I move to the coveted spot with the football players. \"I thought that was you,\" he says with a small smile. I'm guessing this is the most happy he's been all season. He's certainly not as jubilant as the rest of the beaming faces, but for the first time, there's something in his eyes that appears hopeful. \"You look nice.\" \"Thanks. It was all Stasia.\" \"Is she here?\" Brian asks casually. I nod. \"She and Lee are in line ordering.\" Brian prepares to respond when from behind me we hear, \"I just took a piss in the bushes; the line is too damn long.\" \"That's disgusting, Don,\" Brian states flatly with a smirk. Surprised, I turn to find that Don is walking right by me and taking what's apparently his spot next to Mike. \"Ya gotta do whatcha gotta do. There're too many damn people here.\" \"You don't say that at any of the parties.\" \"That's because I usually don't remember them.\" Is he seriously ignoring me right now? I mean, I know I said I didn't want to go public, but acting as if I don't exist? \"I should go find Lee and Stasia,\" I mutter, more to myself than anyone. \"Do you guys wanna sit with us?\" Brian asks. I open my mouth to respond when I notice Don look from me to Brian, confused, before his gaze suddenly jumps back to me in shock. \"C-Clara?\" I fidget nervously as Don stares, earning a laugh from the rest of the guys at the table. \"I here we all thought you had taken the term asshole to a new level,\" Brian teases. \"I swear to God, I didn't even recognize you. You look…damn, Clara.\" \"I know right,\" Stasia suddenly says from beside me. \"You shoulda seen how practically every guy double-taked when we got here.\" I shake my head to protest this, but everyone ignores me. Don frowns, falling silent as Brian scoots down to make room for Stasia and Lee. Mike and Don both scoot apart, leaving a small spot for me in between. I slide into the space, muttering a thanks as Lee shoves a shake and fries under my nose. \"I said I wasn't hungry,\" I mumble, picking up a fry and nibbling on the end. \"And you'll still finish the food, so just shut up and say thanks.\" I find myself smiling despite the dull throb still on my arm. \"Thank you.\" \"You're so welcome,\" she says cheerfully. She studies me quietly, her face falling. \"Are you alright?\" \"Hmm? Wha—oh yeah, I'm fine. Cool. Great even.\" Lee huffs, but just shakes her head before eating. I drop my head, focusing intently on the food in front of me. It's one thing that whenever someone walks by and recognizes me I have to put up with the whispers, but just knowing that He's lurking around is really freaking me out. Paranoid, I look over my shoulder, as if half expecting him to be standing right behind me. I shiver at the thought. \"What's wrong? Are you cold?\" Before I can say anything, Don's suddenly reaching around me and placing his letterman's jacket over my shoulders. I should protest, but I can see in his eyes that he wants me to give him just this moment. And I cave. I give him a small smile of thanks. I don't know if I leave it as is or if I'm supposed to stick my arms in the sleeves, so I just leave it alone. Lee is staring in shock where Stasia looks like she's about to pee herself from excitement. She might want to hold it, apparently only the bushes are available, and I don't think she's an outdoor kinda gal. I clear my throat nervously before returning to my food. Even Don falls silent. I feel so uncomfortable with everyone staring at me as if I'm the least deserving to be on the arm of a Varsity Permian Panther football player, let alone Don Billingsley. Suddenly, as if reading my thoughts, a warm hand slips under the table and finds mine, squeezing tightly but quickly, sending a message of reassurance with a simple gesture. A small smile forms on my lips, steadily growing bigger. It takes all my restraint not to reach for his hand and just hold it.[Chapter 12] Why hello there fellow readers :) Before you start reading, I just want to Thank You once again for your reviews and alerting my story. I know I don't respond (mainly out of sheer laziness, which is a bad thing, I know) but I do enjoy reading what you guys have to say, & I love that you all love Don & Clara. I hope you enjoy this chapter (I throw in a twist I've been trying to write into the story for a while now, but the moment never seemed to present itself). Let me know what you think! CHAPTER TWELVE \"I have to admit, that jacket move was a nice touch.\" Don groans, as if embarrassed, and I smile. \"I don't know what came over me. You weren't even cold, were you?\" \"Not even a little bit. That's what my jacket was for.\" \"Christ, I must've looked like a tool.\" I scoff. \"I thought it was sweet.\" \"And you're still wearing my jacket.\" I blush. \"Oh, sorry.\" I don't get how these kinds of things work. I prepare to shrug off the jacket (I had taken mine off and switched them out) when Don stopped me with a laugh. \"No, keep it. I like seeing you wear it.\" I blush again. Ever since half the senior class watched us walk off together after Don proposed we walk around for a bit (which I appreciated because I was really starting to feel overwhelmed), my face has been red. Don found the entire thing amusing. \"I'm really glad you came out tonight,\" he says suddenly, looking down at me. \"Even if you are a cruel temptress.\" My laughter is so loud and sudden that it seems to crack through the quiet Odessa air like a whip. \"I'm serious! Fuck, Clara you look hot as hell tonight. Even Stasia said—\" \"Stasia has a tendency to over exaggerate and you should know that by now,\" I say reproachfully. But in a softer tone I add, \"Thanks.\" He looks as though he's about to say something but instead he just looks ahead, simultaneously wrapping an arm around my waist and pulling me into the side. I don't know how far we've walked, but I would walk to Dallas if I could stay this content. We wind up at Ratliff, circling the outside of the Stadium in silence. It's really cooled off, and I'm glad for Don's jacket. I feel guilty when I spot the goosebumps trailing up and down his arms, but he assures me he's fine whenever I try to offer his letterman back. I've never realized how large the stadium is or how secluded it is from the rest of town. It's so quiet and almost foreboding out here. The realization hits me that if Austin had gone any further that morning…I would have been completely helpless. No nearby neighbors or random passerbys to hear me. I'm snapped out of my thoughts when Don pins me against the wall, smirking, taunting me, but I can tell his inquisitive about something. \"What's got you such deep thought?\" \"Nothing,\" I say slowly. \"Why am I up against a wall?\" \"Because apparently it's the only way I could get your attention. I was calling you and you seriously spaced on me.\" \"Really?\" He laughs before leaning in to kiss me briefly. \"Really.\" He leans down and I tilt my head back to give him better access. I suddenly realize that I haven't seen him all week. Gaines had them working so hard that he would get home and crash. Which was fine by me because the space allowed me to catch up on some of my studies. But now, as he presses his hips into mine, hands pressed against the wall on either side of my head, and I clench the front of his tee, pulling him closer, I realize how much I missed him. (And this, if I'll be honest). He runs his tongue across my lower lip and I feel my knees shake. They seem to nearly cave when he presses his tongue to mine. I unconsciously let out a low groan of desire when something catches my eye. \"What?\" Don asks anxiously. \"I thought I saw a light?\" \"What?\" \"IS SOMEBODY OUT THERE?\" \"The stadium has security?\" \"If they do, it sucks,\" I whisper. The realization hits us just as a figure comes around and spots us. I don't recognize him but he sure as hell looks like security. \"Hey!\" \"Fuck!\" Don mutters. He grabs my hand and we take off in the opposite direction. \"Hey, get back here!\" I burst out laughing. I don't know why this whole thing seems hilarious to me. Two horny teens busted making out on state property. Go figure. Naturally we thought we were alone. And in all fairness, the security detail must be a recent addition. Perhaps after my attack? I haven't been back since, so it's possible. I can't tell if there are footsteps sounding behind us, but we don't stop running just in case. I should stop laughing, but I can't. And Don's laughing beside me—pulling me along although we're kinda equally matched—so I don't feel as insane. We run back into town, breathless, cramping, and still laughing, until we finally collapse in the lawn of my backyard. Damn, I could not stop laughing. Don collapsed in one of our lawn chairs while I leaned on the wall of the house, letting my heart rate slow as I tried to calm down from the rush. But I couldn't. Something about that rush of adrenaline, the thought of nearly being caught. It was all so exciting. Finally—finally—I felt myself begin to relax. \"I need water,\" I state. I slide open the door and walk in, fixing me a cup of water in the kitchen. Just as I'm leaning against the counter to take a sip, I hear Don walk in. I look up and smile. \"You want any—?\" Don stalks towards me and hugs my waist, kissing me so suddenly and fiercely that I drop my cup in surprise. Thank God we only own plastic. I ignore the wet splatter on my jeans as I melt into him. The kiss is different from the others, but a lot like the first time we made out in my bedroom: passionate, uncontrolled, invigorating, and slightly terrifying. I felt like I wasn't in control of my body, that my mind was thinking on its own and telling my body what to do and how to react, but not on a conscious level. Suddenly we're moving from the kitchen to the hallway, hardly breaking contact except to come up to breathe. And after a brief stint in the hallway, Don is leading me into my room, closing the door behind me before pushing me against the door. He presses himself against me, grabbing the back of my knee and hoisting my leg up in order to place himself between my legs. Suddenly that raging fire returns when he presses his erection into my crotch. I cry out in lust and my hand reaches out for something to hold on to and finds nothing but the smooth surface of the wall. Don, surprised by my sudden movements, leans back, looking at me. Face flushed and breathing hard, I can't say that I've ever found him more stunningly attractive before. That nervousness returns, but this time I find myself able to sustain his gaze. His hand gently cups my face, his thumb running across my lower lip before pulling it free from my teeth. He kisses me more slowly this time and I find myself responding the same as before. We walk backwards, falling into a heap on my bed with me on top. I feel myself begin to shake but I try to push it out of my head. Of course I'm nervous. This is it. I think. It feels right, and I know I want Don. He rolls us over and when I hear him kick off his shoes I feel myself begin to panic a little. He removes his letterman jacket from my arms slowly. Realizing we're half off the bed, I do the only thing that I can actually think of and scoot back, laying ourselves parallel to the direction of the bed. Don doesn't seem to miss a beat. His lips move to my jaw and then to my neck, gently sucking on my skin. I would be lying if I said it didn't feel good. It did. It really, really did. But I also felt like this rock had sunk into my stomach at the idea of having sex. Why had I never bothered to ask anyone about their first time? Is this normal? Surely it has to be because the only thing I've let up my vagina is a tampon, and I'm guessing by the feel of what's straining against Don's pants that he's not the same size as my tampons. \"Don, wait,\" I breathe, having terrified myself into talking. \"I need you to tell me what's about to go down because I'm freaking the hell out and I can't…I can't…\" \"Wait, are you okay with this?\" \"Yes, of course. I'm just…I don't know. Scared.\" \"You know I won't hurt you, right?\" \"Oh no, of course, of course. I'm just…does it hurt? I've heard some girls bleed their first time, I really don't want to. That's really gross—oh my God, I completely grossed you out, I'm so sorry!\" Don, who had flinched, begins to shake his head. \"I just…oh my God. Oh my God.\" \"Clara, baby, look at me. Look at me.\" I do. \"Deep breath, mm-kay? Breathe slowly…there you go.\" I calm down and my head clears a little. I nod my head. \"Alright?\" he asks. \"Yeah,\" I say slowly. He smiles at me, kissing me softly. \"Would you like to do the honors?\" He's pointing at himself and I shrug. \"My shirt.\" \"Oh. Right. Duh.\" I release a shaky laugh as my fingers clench the hem of his tee. I raise it slowly over his head, tossing it to the side as he hovers over me in all his bare-chested glory. I'm full-frontal blushing at this point. Curious, I touch the skin just above his jeans, running my finger from his narrow hip to his flat stomach. I run my fingers over the defining abs before striking up enough courage lay my hand flat on his chest. Part of me is procrastinating, but another part of me can't help but find his body oddly beautiful. \"That tickles,\" Don breathes. I feel my lips twitch, but I don't meet his gaze as his fingers run along the hem of my shirt. He lifts slowly, exposing only a few inches at a time. I lean back, stiff as a board, when I sudden sensations throws me for a loop. He kisses my stomach tenderly, leaving a soft, burning trail on my skin. I panic for a moment, but he continues past my breast for the time being. He raises my body and pulls my shirt over my head before adding it to floor. I feel so shy in just jeans and a bra. Don suddenly sits up with a sad smile. \"You're not ready, are you?\" \"What? No, of course I am! I'm r-ready.\" \"Liar,\" he breathes. He smiles at me and I feel my eyes burn with shame. Dropping my head I can only mutter a pitiful, \"I'm sorry. I didn't mean to go so far…I honestly thought—\" \"Don't apologize,\" he scolds. \"I should've have pressured you like that. I just…\" \"Lost control,\" I provide. \"Yeah.\" \"Yeah, same here. It just felt so nice.\" He smiles. \"Yeah, it did.\" He kisses me. \"Are you okay?\" I nod my head. His eyes drop to my chest briefly before he clears his throat. I refrain from laughing at his expense. \"I'm sorry I got you so worked up.\" \"Again.\" He's teasing, but I really do feel guilty. \"I heard cold showers work wonders,\" I say absentmindedly. \"That's a fucking lie,\" Don mutters. I laugh. \"It's not funny.\" \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to laugh.\" I clear my throat as I sit up, sitting criss-cross on my bed before giving Don a hard look. \"Can I ask you something personal?\" \"Umm…I suppose,\" he draws out, as if wary of the question. \"Who did you lose your virginity to?\" His eyes widen a bit, clearly caught off guard by my question. \"This is…awkward.\" He looks away from me. \"LeAnn never told you—\" \"What?\" I interrupt. Clearly I misheard. \"LeAnn McDougal, Jerrod's twin sister? My LeAnn?\" Don looks flustered. \"Well, yeah. I mean—\" \"I don't…how? She hates you? She told me so herself that you're trouble…\" \"It was around the start of the season freshman year,\" Don admits slowly. \"At a party.\" I can't speak. I stare, stunned, at the wall ahead. This bubble of betrayal blossoms in my chest. The disbelief that she blatantly lied to me for months when she had— Don touches my knee and I blink. \"I think I need to be alone right now.\" Suddenly, the kiss between Brian and me doesn't seem nearly as dramatic. … \"I'm being overdramatic, aren't I?\" \"Well, I—\" \"I just…he caught me off guard. I expected Maria, Melissa…anyone really. But never in a million years…\" \"She did seem to really dislike him,\" Stasia volunteers slowly. \"She acted as if she didn't want me to show any interest in Don,\" I continue. \"Is it possible that she could have feelings for him? Half the estrogen in the town do—Christ, how did I not see this coming? But she lost her virginity to him, she had to. She's told me before she lost it at a party at the start of high school, but how the hell would I have guessed that it was to fucking Don—!\" \" Shh , Clara!\" I freeze just as a young girl walks by Stasia's porch with her dog. She's not paying any attention, but that doesn't mean I want her to overhear any part of the conversation. When she's out of earshot, I continue: \"Do you think she's developed feelings for him?\" Stasia huffs. \"Clara, I know this must really suck, but you honestly know LeAnn a lot better than I do. But at least they did it in the past.\" \"Yeah, but past means history. I mean…what if whatever brought them together in the first place rekindles or whatever when she's around Don?\" \"Booze?\" I realize how stupid I sound, but I just can't shake the hurt that Lee kept this from me. Of course, I haven't exactly been honest, but if the man she lost her virginity to is pursuing me, her best friend, I feel as though I have a right to know. \"How'd it go last night, when you and Don went off?\" Instinctively I blush, but I try to play it cool, hoping she doesn't notice. \"It was nice,\" I whisper, honest. \"Until I asked him who he lost his virginity to.\" \"How did that even come up?\" Shit. \"I just asked him,\" I admit. \"Out of the blue?\" \"Yes.\" \"And he answered.\" \"Yes.\" \"Just like that ,\" she emphasizes with a snap of her fingers. \"God, yes, just like that.\" She snickers, trying to hold it in. I stare until I replay the words in my head. \"Get your head outta the gutter you perv.\" She bursts out into laughter and I can't help but smile. \"Well…he's being honest with you.\" \"I know. I'm not mad, honest. Just…\" \"It can hurt, yes. But you know LeAnn means well, especially when you're involved.\" Something in her voice changes and I look up to see her looking flatly, almost sadly, at the empty street. I drop my gaze, ashamed. \"Lee's complicated, Stasia. It's not you.\" \"I just don't get why she seems to hate me so much. She didn't even want to do the slumber party thing until you agreed to it!\" \"Lee…is a good friend, and a good person,\" I begin slowly. \"But, her attitude doesn't stem from a coveted friendship. She used to pick on me too.\" Stasia looks at me, completely stunned. \"What?\" I nod my head, smiling softly. \"We did not get along at all. And I had to see her every soccer season since sixth grade. She hated me and I wished the opposing teams' defense knocked her on her ass a little harder every game.\" \"But…you guys are so close. I assumed—\" \"We're close now, but we almost came to blows in the middle of a playoff game. We just could not make ourselves get along on the field. We got kicked off by the ref and coach forced us to sit on the bus 'till the game was over. Unfortunately, Lee and I are the best forwards on the team and we got killed after we left. But, somehow, arguing on that bus we somehow came to some sort of mutual…understanding. Which, became respect which, in turn, blossomed into a really twisted sort of friendship.\" \"That is twisted,\" Stasia breathed. \"Yep. But I think Lee acts partially as though to make up for the years of bullying me. I love her to death but she can't protect me from everything like she believes she can. She can't keep fighting my battles for me. I'm a big girl, and if I've made it this far than clearly I'm not as weak as everyone thinks I am.\" Don's words echo in my head, but this time with new meaning and understanding. I feel as guilty for kicking him out as I do for ditching Stasia. \"I'm sorry again I never came back,\" I tell her again. \"Sweetie, for a hunk like Don, I think I can find it in my heart to forgive you.\" I sigh. \"He is really hot.\" She laughs and I almost tell her about how far we got, how I took his shirt off and felt his abs. But I hold my tongue for now. I invite Stasia to come back with me so that I can make up for the time we lost last night. We talk animatedly as we walk, a heads ducked against the cool winter. Odessa never gets freezing temperatures, but as it's nearing Thanksgiving, the temperatures have dropped compared to our hundred degree summer. \"Jesus, it's freezing,\" I mutter, rubbing my arms as I shut the front door behind us. \"You call that freezing?\" Stasia scoffs. \"Look Yankee,\" I say sternly, \"we Texans have a different idea of winter, alright?\" She rolls her eyes and I smile. \"I'll be right back, Janie keeps a spare blanket in her closet. Feel free to help yourself to whatever's in the kitchen.\" I go into Janie's room, but I'm surprised to find that the checkered blanket Janie's grandmother knitted for her missing from its usual assignment. I check the floor of the closet and under the bed but no luck. I check the trunk last, and lo and behold it's sitting right on top. I move to join Stasia when I freeze. Turning back to the contents of the trunk I spy a stack of stamped envelopes held together with a rubberband. I pick up the stack, seeing as how the first one is addressed to me, but I've never seen it before. I close the trunk slowly and set the blanket on top. I remove the rubberband slowly, fingers shaking because, in my heart, I know what it is. And as I flip through the different colored envelopes, all addressed to me, I realize that LeAnn's not the only one who has been keeping secrets from me. ... By the time I hear the key in the front door, it's nearly ten at night. I haven't stopped crying since I opened the first birthday card, stamped on my first birthday. But it's more than just birthday cards; there is a multitude of letters from a man named Christopher Bailey. My father. \"Clara, are you home?\" I don't answer. My bedroom door opens and Janie freezes when she sees my face. And then she spots the letters. \"Clara—\" she begins quickly. \"How. Could. You?\" \"Clara—\" \"How could you keep something like this from me?\" \"I was trying to protect you.\" \"From what? What the hell could be so dangerous about growing up with a father?\" \"Clara, I understand you're upset but watch your mouth, I'm still your mother.\" \"You really want to reprimand my language , right now, Janie. That's what you're worried about ?\" I could tell I threw her for a loop. Never in my seventeen years have I raised my voice, let alone talked back. Today is just full of surprises apparently. I hold up the last letter. \"I don't know if he hurt you. He doesn't talk much about your relationship. But you had no right to decide for me if I was allowed to know my father. No right.\" I storm past her, physically shaking from anger. \"Clara,\" she calls out, following close behind me. I take off in a run the second I reach the sidewalk. \"Just leave me alone!\" … I knock hesitantly on the door, strongly aware that it had to be nearly midnight and they could be sleeping. But I had never been inside the house, and knocking on the window seemed like a bad idea. I wait for a moment, debating if I should knock again or just leave, when the door opens. Thankfully, it's Don standing before me in just sweatpants, groggy-eyed and surprised. I realize I must look a mess, face tear-stained, red, and raw from being wiped so frequently on my sleeve. \"Clara?\" \"I'm sorry, if I woke you…I just…didn't know where else to go.\" My voice breaks and I cover my mouth to keep from completely breaking down on his porch. Don steps aside and I step in slowly, aware of how vulnerable I am right now. But he's the only person I could think of who might understand—or at least welcome me in without question. \"Can I get you anything?\" I shake my head slowly. Mistaking my silence he adds, \"It's just me right now.\" I shake my head again. \"I just don't want to be alone right now,\" I manage to croak. I bite my trembling lip as Don pulls me into his warm chest. This time, I have no reservations about wrapping my arms around his waist, tucking my head under his chin. \"Do you need to stay the night?\" \"I couldn't, I can't impose like that—\" \"Clara…do you need to stay the night?\" I blink. \"Please.\"[Chapter 13] CHAPTER THIRTEEN I woke up to a moment of panic and confusion. The sun was streaming brightly through the closed blinds and when I turned over to avoid the light, I opened my eyes to a room that quite clearly wasn't mine. In fact, it was chaotic. I don't move, eyes roaming my surroundings with caution. I take in the clothes shoved haphazardly in random places, as if someone had tried to tidy and failed terribly. I blinked when I recognized a certain letterman jacket slung across the closet door handle and I breathed. Suddenly last night comes rushing back so forcefully that I can't breathe for a moment. The letters…Janie…my father. I sit up slowly, my lids heavy and swollen from crying, as if they had absorbed the water like a sponge. I throw the covers off, jeans and tee from yesterday wrinkled. I don't want Don to see me like this. I don't have a pretty 'good morning' appearance. Christ, I can't even brush my teeth. I climb out of bed, wary that I've never been here before and have no clue who is actually home. The last thing I need right now is to run into Charles Billingsley. I open the bedroom door slowly, poking my head out and listening for any giveaways as to who is home. I hear nothing but soft sounds from the kitchen, and that could be anybody. I debate waiting in the room when a figure suddenly steps into the hallway. \"Hey, I thought I heard something.\" I open the door wider, shyly. \"Yeah, I wasn't sure who was up, so—\" \"Oh, it's still just me. Dad must've gone over to Flippy's.\" \"Oh. Are they serious?\" Don shrugs, clearly not caring. I wonder if he thinks of his mom back in Oklahoma at times like this. \"You hungry?\" I smile. \"Starving.\" Breakfast is a rather silent affair. I eat slowly, still aware of the constrictions in my throat. I can tell that Don is bursting for me to tell him what's going on. I kind of cried myself to sleep last night, so he still has no idea why I'm in the condition I'm in. I don't know if I have the strength to tell him; I'm still processing all this information myself. \"This is delicious, Don,\" I say politely, try to break the uncomfortable silence that has consumed us. The chocolate chip pancakes are really good though. \"Mom taught me how to make 'em,\" he says fondly. \"Told me that the best way to impress a woman is to know how to cook.\" \"Well she sounds like a smart woman.\" He chuckles. \"Yeah…\" I finish my breakfast in silence, setting down the fork just as Don jumps up. \"I'll get that.\" He grabs my plat before I can protest, and so I slouch back in my seat, wary that any moment he's gonna ask me to spill the beans. I stand up, prepared to defend my silence when Don steps back into the dining room. \"Do you wanna shower and get cleaned up? There's a spare toothbrush you can use if you'd like.\" Thrown, I nod slowly. \"Sure, I'd really appreciate that.\" He leads me to the bathroom and shows me how to work the hot water. \"Wait, I don't have a change of clothes.\" \"You can just wear something of mine,\" he offers casually. Nice try. \"As much as I'm sure you'd love that, that's not gonna work.\" \"Why?\" \"Because the only thing of yours that fits me properly is likely your hat. Everything else is too big.\" \"I can give you a tee and you can throw your jeans back on.\" I open my mouth to protest when I realize that it's not that bad of an idea. I usually wear jeans twice before throwing them in the laundry anyway. \"Fine.\" But it's nice too, not having to go home and face Janie just yet. She's probably at work now…unless she called in. I'm sure she's accumulated enough vacation days considering she usually doesn't miss her shifts. Either way, I don't think I can handle being around her right now. I try to be aware of how long I'm in the shower so I don't use up the hot water. I'm able to shave time off by not worrying about washing my hair. Although I'm sure the steam is bringing some of my curls back by now. I step out, smelling like a man's soap, and wrap the spare towel left out for me around my frame. I dry off quickly and dress before brushing my teeth and tossing the toothbrush in the trash so no one else uses it on accident. I appreciate Don taking me in like this, but I'm not planning on spending another night here. I walk into Don's room just as he pulls his shirt over his head. I turn my back. \"Oh, sorry, I should've knocked.\" \"Why?\" he taunts. \"It's not like you haven't seen my chest before. In fact, I daresay, you seemed to enjoy it quite a bit.\" I fidget while staring at the hallway wall. I can hear him move but I don't realize his position until he pulls me into the room, closing the door behind us. I barely smile as he spins me around, pulling me into his still bare chest. I must admit, he does have a really— really —nice body. I avoid his gaze but I can feel his eyes probing me. \"Baby, talk to me. You're starting to freak me out.\" \"It's nothing—\" \"Bullshit. You don't cry like you did last night over nothing.\" \"Don, just don't worry about it—\" \"I'm not worried about 'it', I'm worried about you—\" \"Will you just stop?\" \"Why the hell are you acting so defensive….Clara, does this have something to do with the son of a bitch who attacked you at Ratliff?\" Oh, now someone remembers him. Whenever he's actually a factor in my current state of being, no one bats an eye at his sudden appearance. \"No, Don, it has nothing to do with him.\" \"Clara, you don't have to protect him—\" \"I'm not protecting him and this has nothing to do with him.\" \"Then why can't you tell me why you're so upset?\" I can't look him in the eyes. How can I look Don in the eye and tell him that I discovered a lifetimes worth of letters from my absentee father who apparently wanted me and loves me, though he doesn't know me, when Don has such a shitty relationship with his existent father? How much shittier of a girlfriend can I be, let alone human being? I shake my head. \"I'm sorry, Don, I shouldn't've come.\" I turn my back to him and open the door, stumbling into the hallway. He follows hotly on my heels, pestering me with questions. I reach the back door and slide it open before turning on my heel. I have to stand on my toes, but I manage to plant a deep kiss on him. \"I'll explain everything once I have a better understanding of what…it even is. But for now, I'm fine, I promise. And thank you, for…\" I don't know how to word it, but he doesn't seem to care. He kisses me again but I can tell he's trying to get me to stay. I push on his chest before taking my leave. … I regret not taking advantage of our time together that weekend…or at least not being such a bitch before leaving, because the following weeks were hectic for the football team as State's loomed just around the corner. Gaines had them working their asses off that Don was virtually non-existent in his little late-night visits and because of my rule, we couldn't actually be together in public. Whenever I saw him I had to settle for a lingering stare, praying no one noticed or suspected anything. In actuality, it was worse. I absolutely hated that he did this to me: made me feel like I needed him. No, not needed. Wanted him, craved him, which felt even worse. No, I wasn't dependent on him, but dammit if I didn't miss him at times. A week before State's and I was sitting in the cafeteria pushing my food around. The guys had grown reclusive from the public, and who could blame them? All they heard was talk about football and State's. They had taken to eating off campus, if they even came back at times. Naturally, their teachers excused it. \"If it helps them relax and win State's, I'll take their test for them,\" I had overheard one geography teacher robustly exclaiming in the teacher's lounge. It was like this every year. \"Clara, there you are.\" I look up to find Coach Sanchez (the head coach for girls' varsity soccer) smiling down at me. Standing behind her is an older gentleman with a familiar logo on his shirt that makes my heart race. \"Clara, this is Richard Meyers, he's a scout from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\" I can't breathe. He's smiles warmly at me and holds out his hand. \"I've heard great things about you from Ms. Sanchez, Ms. Baker. It's an honor to finally meet you.\" \"Thank you, Sir,\" I squeak, shaking his hand. I clear my voice. \"It's an honor to meet you, too.\" \"If you have time, Ms. Baker, I'd love to discuss some things with you in private, with Ms. Sanchez of course.\" \"Oh, no, of course not. Just let me grab my things.\" I begin shoving my lunch back into my bag, ignoring how Lee and Stasia are beaming at me. I give them a quick smile before following my coach and Mr. Meyers out the cafeteria. … It's a shame Janie and I aren't talking, because I'd love to share my good news. But I'm too stubborn and so is she. Mr. Meyers claims that, despite being an out-of-state applicant, my chances of getting into the university are highly likely—and with a sports scholarship—guaranteed. No amount has been set yet since the season hasn't started, but considering my coach let it \"slip\" (as she later explained it to me when we were alone) that other universities were interested, but apparently with my minority status, grades, athleticism, and low-income background, I could get a full ride. Even better, Coach wasn't lying when she said other schools were interested. Without my knowledge, she had contacted scouts from nearly every school I had applied to, and many had called back: Columbia University, UCLA, Northwestern, and the University of Texas at Austin. I had already shared the good news with Lee after she had called asking what happened, but other than that, no one knew. Don was busy, Stasia wouldn't care although I'm sure she'd be happy for me, and Janie… I shuffled out of bed to the stack of cards on my desk, sitting in the chair as I picked up a random card. I stared at it, wondering how things would have been different had my father been around. Christopher Bailey. Was he Irish? I don't know much about surnames, but Bailey seems Irish. Is he a Texas native? Did he move here? How did he meet Janie? Did he love her as much as he claims to love me? Why did he never try to find me if he wanted me so badly? So many letter, and yet still so many questions. There's no number, but there is an address. He's in Dallas…or was. The last letter was postmarked almost a year ago. A person can only write so many letters in seventeen years before giving up after no response. All this time…wasted. I think that's why I'm so angry at Janie. All those years she heard me cry myself to sleep because I believed that no matter what I did, I was unwanted. Unloved. And all this time, proof sat buried in her trunk that someone I believed hated me just like the rest of the world…didn't. Knowing that both parents, despite being two different races, wanted me could've had a huge impact on my life. No one could taunt me about how Janie was a tramp, or I was a bastard…well, okay, I still was, but if my parents had stayed together it wouldn't have been as obvious unless I had told someone. I run my fingers through my hair, literally feeling the overload of so many thoughts and what ifs. I wonder if he watched football. The chances are high that he does…it is Texas. Does he know that Odessa is playing Dallas Carter for the State Championship? Does he think about me every time that flashes on the TV or is broadcasted over a local radio station? I wish he had included a picture of himself. I'd love to know what he looks like. Do I have his eyes, or is my hazel a mixture of his green and Janie's browns? Do I get my unruly curls from his side of the family? Is he shy like me or is he outgoing like Janie? Is he tall like Don or average? So much of me comes from him, and I don't even know what. Thinking about it all makes my eyes burn more. As much as I love Janie for raising me by herself, I don't think I have it in me to forgive her. At least not anytime soon. I mean…I could understand if maybe he was abusive or an asshole. But judging from the letters, he seems anything but. That's obviously not a good way to judge someone, but I can't help but have this feeling that Christopher Bailey is, in actuality, one of the good ones. One of the good ones… Don. I stare at my window, as if suddenly expecting him to knock. I feel guilty for the way I acted. He was right: I was acting defensively. I know Don wants nothing more than for me to show him how much I actually trust him…but I don't tell anyone anything about how I'm feeling. In all honesty, no one has earned it. I like Don a lot but…despite the close physical aspects of our relationship, I'm not ready to open up to him—in more ways than one, if I think about it. But despite everything, I do miss him. I feel relaxed around him. Almost like myself. Normal. It was a nice feeling. I feel as though I should tell him this, so that he at least knows that I acknowledge the effort he's making and that, one day, I hope to return the favor. Just not yet. So much has happened this year. I can't help but speculate that my attack at Ratliff was some kind of catalyst for the unfolding events…and it wasn't even Christmas. The thought left me winded and exhausted. I returned the cards to their new spot in the drawer of my desk, shutting it firmly behind me.[Chapter 14] Just when I get the hang of one version of this site they go & update it on me. It's getting as bad as Facebook up in this piece (damn you Zuckerburg). But alas, I have update 2 days in a row, & although daily updates won't become a thing, I did feel as though I owed you amazingly faithful & unbelievably patience readers a little treat. I got stuck for a little while & worked on some other projects & waited for inspiration to strike! I expect the next update sometime next week, but until then, now that I do read your reviews and I love seeing that you're following the story! I hope you enjoy this chapter (Don & Clara take things to the next level) ;) CHAPTER FOURTEEN It was pandemonium in Odessa early Saturday morning. I've never seen so much white and black. The energy of the town was out of control. Banners and signs were created for the football team and everyone was making plans to follow the charter bus (which would carry the team) to Houston where we were playing in the Astrodome. The game that would decide the State Champions is tonight, and I haven't seen Don in nearly a month. I was desperate for some kind of contact, but applications for colleges picked up and so did my school work. The football team may get special privileges as far as exams go, but unfortunately the rest of us normal people don't. I wasn't bitter. It was just the way of Odessa. But I felt guilty for avoiding Don. And I'm sure the way I snapped at him, he probably assumed I needed space and would reach out to him whenever I was ready. They leave for Houston at noon from Ratliff stadium parking lot. That was in twenty, which gave me enough time to say what I needed to say to Don and… And what? Declare my feelings publicly for Don? Highly unlikely. But I was seriously considering it. I need to tell him I'm sorry, but more importantly, I want to be able to wish him luck before his final championship game. Win or lose, I just want him to know. But would he want me there? He talks constantly of us being able to go out in public—critics be damned—but what if he suddenly changes his mind when faced with the prospect? Should I wait? I honestly could not think of a better time than now. I quickly made up my mind. I drove above the speed limit, aware of how little time I actually had to pull this off. I felt pumped on nerves and adrenaline. This could either go really good or really bad. Surprisingly, the parking lot was fairly…empty. It's not as if it's closed, but I guess everyone is at home making final preparations before the team leaves. I pull up beside a familiar car. Uncle LV turns at my entrance, surprised etched across his face before giving me a soft smile. I return it, shaky, as I shut off the engine and clamor out of my car. \"Got room for one more, Coach?\" I pause as Gaines allows my cousin sanction on the bus. My heart goes out to him in ways I never thought possible. I can only imagine how much this must be hurting him. I'm reminded of when Don was telling me of his struggles at home with his father. I've been so blind. Even James was clearly hurting…and I had said nothing. Asked nothing. Thought nothing, but of my own problems. And I think, in a way, I knew that, I just didn't know I knew. Why the hell else would I be preparing to risk public scrutiny and humiliation for a boy a barely know. Because Don is not just any boy , I berate myself silently. Taking a deep breath, I send my first quick prayer in years. God, give me strength . Breathing, I turn to the bus, searching among the familiar faces for the one I need to see most. I find him, staring at me at the entrance of the bus, right in front of James. Don's gaze barely leaves mine as he steps down, allowing James to get on before him. My cousin, looks at Don and follows his gaze to me. Slowly but surely, everyone is aware of my presence and it sets my nerves on edge. I take small steps towards Don, arms crossed protectively over my chest. \"Fuck you doing here, muttly?\" Fuck. Austin. I freeze, face heating up as part of the bus roars with laughter. The rest are silent, gazing curiously at me and Don. I can feel minds connecting the dots. Odessa is smart when they want to be. Don's stare hardens and he shakes his head at me as if telling me, Don't listen to them . That I find funny, considering his temper is quicker to ignite than mine. When we stand a foot apart, his presence becomes so overwhelmingly strong I have to refrain from losing control like I normally would when we're alone. \"What are you doing here?\" I lick my lips nervously when someone calls out, \"Billingsly, you tappin' that ass?\" \"I hope to God you wore a condom!\" \"Clara has plenty—\" \"The next asshole that makes a crack about my baby cousin is gonna get a crutch up their white ass.\" I blush harder, but thankfully the comments become more or less stifled. But looking at Don, I begin to panic. Everything I had planned to say fell out of my head the second Austin opened his damn mouth. Humiliation seeped into my veins and clogged all thought processing. Don stared at me expectantly. So I kissed him. No thinking required, I pulled his head down and kissed him. And when I felt his arms wrap around my hips, the most amazing warmth spread through my limbs. I felt light as he kissed me back with vigor. Someone started hooting and hollering on the bus, and several others followed suit. I couldn't tell if they were taunting to taunt or to hurt me, but at the moment, I didn't care. \"Billingsly, let's go!\" I broke this kiss, breathing, but when I saw his smile I almost melted. \"You have to go.\" \"Do you have any idea what this means to me?\" I just hope it's worth it. His voice was so soft that I felt my face burn. \"I'm sorry it took me so long—\" He kissed me again until his name was called again by Coach Gaines. I pushed on his chest, smiling. His gaze hardly wavers until he's nearly pushed onto the bus by Coach. I touch my lips, smiling, as the bus pulls out of the lot. … I told Lee and Stasia the truth on the drive to Houston. Lee sulked in the backseat while Stasia screeched sentiments of joy. It was a rather awkward opposition to be honest. But at least they weren't upset. Well, Lee was because I hadn't told her, but we still need to have a conversation about who doesn't tell who what. The drive provided ample time for facts to be straightened and questions answered. I even told them how far Don and I had gotten the night we made it to playoffs. Everything. It was comforting, to have my third biggest secret out in the open. It was a weight off my shoulders, lying to my best friends about something I desperately wished to tell them. I also took the opportunity to ask them questions. Lee was more talkative here, which I appreciated, because my ideas about sex were so off I felt borderline stupid. \"Make sure he doesn't just shove it in you,\" Lee mutters bitterly, \"that hurts like a bitch.\" \"Oh, I wonder if he's into foreplay. That's always fun!\" \"Jesus Christ, Clara, make sure he wears a condom.\" Stasia nodded and I felt like a prepubescent child. I was inexperienced not ignorant. But I let them coach me on the dos and don'ts of sex. It was the least I could do. And besides, it's not like it wasn't all un helpful. Some of what they were talking about was kind of…exciting. And Stasia noticed when I started fidgeting in the seat. \"You're thinking about him,\" she taunted. Oh, I was thinking terrible things about him. I really shouldn't be driving. My friends both laugh at my expense, teasing me when I only blush harder. Needless to say, I was happy when we finally arrived at the astrodome with the rest of the caravan and found our seats. The conversation quieted since we could easily be overheard, but judging by the looks I was getting from some of our classmates, the who of our conversation had somehow already reached the knowledge of others and been established as either a lie or unbelievable. Someone shoved me roughly from behind and a familiar voice hissed, \"You're dead.\" Maria. I turned in my seat and gave her a taunting smile. She kept walking and I felt the smile leave my face. \"Clara, don't look like that. She can't hurt you.\" I shake my head, not wanting to talk about it right now. Maria wasn't the first and she won't be the last, no point in trying to make a scene now. With a few minutes left until the teams step onto the field, the stadium is already filled to capacity. White on one side, red on the other. It's surreal, being in the astrodome for the state championship game. And nerve wracking…I can just imagine how the guys feel. … My voice is horse, my heard is pounding, I think I have an ulcer, and if we get one more touchdown we win. We have a minute left in the fourth quarter, and I just witnessed what is likely the most spectacular Permian plays in history. With a turnover thanks to Brian, Panthers re-gained the ball. Everyone has been creating art on that field, the likes of which I have never seen before. And before I was all, win or lose, I'll be proud . And that holds true, but being a touchdown away from going all the way puts it in perspective. I wanna win. I wanna win so bad the game is unbearable to watch. But as a Permain with friends and a boyfriend on the field, it's my obligation to watch every lousy, dirty play by Dallas with my fingers crossed. \"Jesus, Clara, I can't hear.\" I blink, Don's name dying on my lips. Blushing, I quiet down. Considering he was helped off the field with a dislocated shoulder and then returned to give us our first down with seconds left, and I was too proud not to be ecstatic. Stasia and Lee grin at me. I clutch their hands for support as the clock counts down to zero. Please , I think, biting my lip hard. I watch Mike run the ball towards the endzone with heavy heart palpitations. \"I can't see, is it in?\" Someone asks from behind me. There's so much activity going on, I can't tell. I hold my breath. \"It's no good. It's too short!\" For a second I can't comprehend what this means until I see DALLS CARTER STATE CHAMPIONSHIP 1988 flashing across from me. My grip loosens on Lee and Stasia's hands, eyes blurring in disbelief. Our side is silent in processing disbelief as hoards of red overtake the field. My heart breaks for our team who are consoling each other in silence, but I must admit, I'm crying a little for me to. Nothing would have been better to end our senior year than with a championship. And now, I only get what ifs . But damn…what a game. \"You okay,\" Stasia asks me. I nod slowly, wiping my face and feeling ridiculous for crying. \"I just can't believe it's over,\" I admit. I look at Lee. \"No more Odessa football.\" She understands my sentiments and her face reddens with unshed tears. \"This is our last game,\" she whispers. For the first time, we're struck with the fact that at the end of the year, we're done. Not just with football, but with Odessa. With high school. I burst into tears. Somehow, with all that has happened this year, I had forgotten that I am, indeed, a graduating senior. Now, faced with the knowledge that I will never watch Odessa take home a state championship as a Permian Panther but as a Permian Panther alumni is heavy to deal with. Lee and Stasia both hug me, Lee and me crying. I begin laughing at the realization and slowly begin to relax. Wiping my face, we gather our things and begin to follow the crowd out. However, Stasia taps me on the shoulder and whispers, \"Look.\" I follow her pointing finger to number twenty-six on the field being intercepted by none other than Charles Billingsly. \"Oh God, no,\" I whisper. But I apparently had nothing to fear. In a shocking display of affection, Charles holds his son and I watch in awe as he slips his own championship ring on his son's finger. The initial smile that graces my face freezes with the realization that I still have not told anyone about my father and I have made no move to contact him. Suddenly, looking at Don and his father, I miss the man I never knew, if only because I can't help but think of all the times I wanted a father to hold me like that. Like he's proud, no matter what. \"Clara, are you okay?\" I blink, my emotions getting the better of me. \"Yeah,\" I whisper. \"We should get going; it's a long drive back.\" They exchange glances but I ignore them. Just as I prepare to descend down the stairs, this strange feeling that I'm being watching snatches at my instincts. Nervously, I glance over my shoulder, prepared for the worse, when I feel myself relax. I don't know how he does it, but Don managed to find me in a sea of black and white. He takes his helmet off, holding my gaze. I smile as he gestures for me to come to the field. I shake my head. He nods. I shake, laughing as he begins to pout. \"Go,\" Lee tells me. \"We'll meet you at the car.\" I nod. I head down the steps but veer right, towards the field. It's surreal, looking around and seeing what these boys have been seeing. The astroturf is soft under my feet. Don walks towards me, face stoic but his eyes are so emotionally burdened it's like reading an open book. I don't know what will happen between Don and his father now. If things will get better or worse with football over. But I don't care to ask right now. Honestly, I can't close the gap between us fast enough. He looks pretty hurt, so I don't throw myself at him like I would like to. I smile at him as he takes my face in his hands. He kisses me quickly before saying, \"Leave your window open tonight.\" … The feel of my bed sinking underneath me jolts me awake in a panic before I recognize Don's sturdy frame trying to squeeze through. Smiling tiredly, I move my legs so he doesn't step on them as he clamors clumsily through. Closing the window behind him, he turns to me. \"You were asleep.\" \"It's fine,\" I whisper. \"Just a long drive back. The girls and I took shifts.\" He nods before slipping his shoes off and lying beside me in bed. He smells good, like that soap I borrowed what seemed like a lifetime ago. \"I missed you,\" I admit shyly. He hums, pleased. Rolling over, he hugs my waists before burrowing his face in my neck. \"I couldn't stop thinking 'bout you,\" he whispers in my ear. \"There were some moments when it was killing me to stay away from you.\" \"Well…unless I'm lynched by the mob, I don't think that'll be a problem anymore.\" His face hardened and I mentally slapped myself. He just lost State's, I could at least give him this. \"I'm sorry. I'm really shitty at this girlfriend thing.\" \"Saying the wrong thing doesn't make you a shitty girlfriend.\" He kisses my neck. \"You need to relax…and I could think of a few activities that would help with that.\" The suggestive tone of voice made me squirm. I could feel his lips curl into a smile against my neck as they gently brushed over my skin. I closed my eyes and enjoyed the sensation. His lips sought mine soon enough. He grabbed the back of my head almost roughly and I turned into his body, wrapping my arms around his neck and throwing one leg over his. He clutched my hip tightly and when he ground his erection into my crotch, I felt my body go aflame with desire but I couldn't help but break the kiss in amusement. \"Already?\" \"Bite me.\" He kisses me once more before settling down beside me. \"I'm so exhausted.\" I roll over and place my arms on his chest before resting my chin on top, looking up at him. \"I was so proud of you guys today. That was a game of the ages.\" He's silent. \"I can't believe that was it,\" he mumbles. \"No more football.\" \"I know.\" I push his hair from his face. He purrs as my fingers skim his forehead and mess with his hair. \"I love when you do that.\" I smile, my confidence soaring at the compliment. \"You're so beautiful, it makes no sense,\" he mutters, staring at me from underneath his lids. I frown, my hand pausing as if it too were processing this. \"Why do you do that? Why don't you believe anything I say when it's a compliment?\" I blink, embarrassed. \"People aren't exactly tripping over their feet to hook up with me,\" I whisper, staring pointedly at him. \"Get called ugly long enough, pretty soon you start to believe it.\" Don is silent, aware that he's upset me. \"Look at me,\" he whispers. \"Clara, look at me.\" I can't. I sit up, frustrated, and tell him firmly, \"Can we not talk about this please?\" Frowning, he follows me, grabbing my hip so that I can't move away. \"No, we're going to talk about this now.\" This time, he grabs my chin and forces my gaze. His green eyes are full of such concern that I can hardly bare to look at them. I drop my gaze and I can hear him sigh, realizing that this is the best he's going to get. \"What's wrong, Clara. Ever since that night you showed up at my doorstep I can tell that something has been bothering you. Is it Maria, because I promise you I will—?\" \"No, it's not Maria…this time,\" I admit slowly. He takes my face in his hands and probes further. \"You can talk to me.\" I mull over this for what feels like a lifetime. I can hear Don patiently breathing in my ear and the sound is surprisingly comforting. I gently lower his hands from my face, making up my mind to tell him the truth. Or rather, show it to him. I receive the stack of cards and letters from my desk and drop them in his lap. He looks at me, curious, and I nod my consent. I sit down at the office chair by my desk, pulling my knees to my chest as he begins with the first letter on top. I watch with indifferent eyes as he makes his way through each written letter from my father. His face reveals nothing, and I wish so badly for him to say something. I still refuse to talk with Janie, and having someone else know this burden of mine feels almost freeing. When he finally set down the last piece of correspondence, he looks at me with such warmth that I feel my face scrunch up, and I have to cover my mouth with my hand to keep from completely bawling in front of him. I squeeze my eyes shut and a few tears escape, rolling down my cheeks. I take a few deep breaths to regain my composure and when I feel stable I drop my hand and open my eyes. Don just looks at me. Unable to meet his gaze, I stare at the floor, rubbing my hands across my bare thighs as I whisper, \"You're the only person who knows…besides Janie.\" He nods, as if expecting this. \"So, what are you gunna do?\" \"Do? There's nothing to do. I'm leaving in less than a year, what's the point? So what if I find him? We're not going to be some merry family that gets to live happily ever after. You of all people should know that I suck at relationships and I suck at confrontation. By the time we even develop some kind of connection, I won't be here.\" \"Why not? Where else are you going to be?\" I freeze, realizing my mistake. My cheeks burn with shame as I whisper, \"I've gotten two really good soccer scholarships offers from Columbia University and UNC. If I get accepted…I don't know which one I would go to though.\" \"You're not staying in Texas.\" \"Don…I hate this place.\" \"You hate me.\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"Well I live here. LeAnn and Stasia and Chavo and Mike…we all live here. Do you hate us too?\" \"Don't sit there and act like you've been there for me! You've known me since August and I've been getting bullied since I was seven. Don't act like you and your friends stood up for me and you forget that Lee used to give me hell too. Now stop twisting my damn words!\" Now it's Don's turn to look away. After a few minutes of silence in which I'm collecting my breath, Don speaks. \"You're right. I shouldn't have said that. I'm sorry. It's just…you just caught me off guard. I mean, fuck, I knew you were better than Odessa but I just never expected you to leave Texas. North Carolina, New York…\" he snorts in disbelief. \"Damn, that's far.\" It takes me a few moments to feel myself relax but when I do, I go to sit beside him. Taking his hand in mine, I gently kiss his jawline. He holds my cheek before turning his face. We kiss for only a moment before he whispers, \"You should contact your father. You'll always regret it if you don't.\" I nod. \"But for now…what were you saying before about some activities that would help me relax?\"[Chapter 15] This is for the fabulous reviewers who have the patience to put up with my late, late, late posting. I hit a road block with this story, but I've had this chapter ready for a while now. I know where I want this story to go, but getting there has been half the battle. Go figure. But this one is super long, IMO, but I hope you all enjoy it just the same. R&R;! CHAPTER FIFTEEN Monday at school was weird in that Don and I were now, as far as the school was concerned, a couple. I couldn't tell who the scrutiny was harder from: the guys or girls. But both kept their eyes trained on me, as if trying to figure out what it was about me that could attract the attention of Don Billingsly. I have to admit, that hurt. But I ignored them the way they ignored me for years. Lunch, however, was entirely different, but in a good way. Because Don could finally sit beside me as my boyfriend and not as the best friend of Stasia's boyfriend, Brian. The cafeteria hummed with the usual buzz of high school, but the tone was different as eyes shifted lazily over Don's arm wrapped around my hips, pulling me practically into his lap. It was if he was daring someone to say something against us. And although I felt he was being overdramatic, I was pleased with his protective stance. I was also eyeing Maria closely. She hadn't made a move yet although she had had since Saturday to do so. I guess she had peaked at condoms in my locker. The next best thing would be to fake a HIV report, and she doesn't have the brains to think of that let alone pull it off. I realize that something's moving in on the cookie Lee had brought me from the lunch line and without thinking I slap at it. Don swears loudly and yanks his hand back and I shoot him a cold look. \"Get your own.\" \"See, now you're just showing off in front of your friends,\" he mumbles, removing his arm from my waist to rub his sore hand. \"That actually hurt.\" \"You dislocated your shoulder two days ago and that hurt?\" \"I don't think I appreciate your tone.\" \"So?\" He opened his mouth to respond when a snickering Stasia interrupts and says, \"You two are adorable.\" \"Never thought I'd see the day a woman would put Billingsly in his place,\" Brian teases with a mouthful of fries. He had been pretty chill around me lately, and it was nice to know that we could put that awkward kiss behind us now. He smiled at me and I returned it, grateful that the tension was gone. \"She is not putting me in any kind of place,\" he protested indignantly. I snort and the table cackles with laughter. Chuckling lightly I reach for my cookie and split it in half. Taking a bite of mine I shove the other half into Don's open mouth, cutting off whatever he'd been about to say in retort. I laugh at his bewildered stare and he shakes his head, but seems to swallow the cookie whole. His arm returns to my waist, his thumb sneaking under the hem of my shirt and stroking the flesh softly. There were so many hidden promises in such a simple gesture that my body went aflame with desire. Thankfully, no one really seemed to notice. We parted after lunch. I was taking much more upper level courses than he, so we had no classes in common. In all honesty, that was alright with me. I needed to focus in school, not get distracted by Don. Not to mention Don had more or less invited himself over after school in order to formally introduce himself to Janie. With our silent argument still going strong, I had told him this was unnecessary, but he insisted that he \"be on good terms with the mother before deflowering the daughter\". Classy. The end of the school period brought with it a pinch of excitement at seeing Don and nerves at the fact that he was actually going to meet Janie. While I was rushing to my locker, I didn't even pay attention to anything until suddenly I was sprawled on the tile floor, my binders and textbooks spilling from my arms. The hallway exploded in laughter and I didn't have to look to make out Maria's telltale high-pitched shriek of amusement. Bitch. I began gathering some of my things, cheeks red but trying to ignore it, as per usual. I was expecting something, which lessened the sting a little. I would've been foolish to think that just because I was holding hands with Don in the hallways I would no longer be a target. Just as I reached for my AP Chemistry text, a heeled foot shot out, nearly hitting my hand, and kicked my book further down the hallway. \"You're still ugly, Muttly,\" she hissed, her voice so close I guessed she was hovering somewhere right above me. \"I don't give a shit who you're fucking.\" I didn't bother correcting her as I stood. Instead I said the first think that popped into my head: \"You must've been fucking awful if Don's messing around with the likes of me then.\" The hallway, which had been silent and trained on us, exploded with laughter at my words. I turned, wanting to see if I had impacted her at all. Boy was she red. I stood up, emboldened by the laughter that was no longer targeted at me. Clearly these kids weren't particularly loyal, they were just looking for entertainment. I smirked, not wanting to try and top my comment. I just turned to continue picking up my things. And that's when the bitch lost her mind. She hit my from behind and we both went falling. And although Maria had the element of surprise, I had the upperhand when it came to strength and speed. I was fit; I got tackled every year during the soccer season (especially during the more intense playoff matches). Maria weighed nothing compared to those girls. But she was fucking pissed. My being with Don had really gotten to her. I rolled us over so that she was underneath me and then I turned so that I could straddle her hips and hold her hands which were trying to claw at my face. \"Are you out of your Goddamn mind?!\" \"He's mine you fucking cunt,\" she screamed. Even I was surprised by her language. She managed to pull one hand free and slapped me before rolling us over. She kept clawing at me, but I wasn't worried about her losing control or some shit like that. I was still functioning partially under shock that she had even come at me. \"I've been seeing Don since September . He was never yours, you. Stupid. Bitch!\" And I punched her. I didn't even realize it until she had fallen off me, clutching her jaw and I realized my knuckles hurt. I stood up, breathing like a bull. I was furious but for the first time, she was the one cowering on the ground. \"You're nothing but a heartless piece of shit . It's none of your damn business who I'm with. Like it or not, you leave me the hell alone, Maria. Leave. Me. Alone.\" I gather my things quickly, terrified that I would get busted by a teacher and be suspended or expelled for fighting. I don't know how the noise we were making didn't attract any attention, but I guess when the students check out for the day, so does the faculty. But I wasn't going to chance a monitor coming out wondering why there were more students in school than on the busses. And besides, even if Maria tried to bitch that I'd hit her, no one would believe. I was invisible in these hallways. I doubted anyone would believe her without witnesses, and I would hope that everyone would admit that she had hit me first. The crowd parted for me in slack-jawed silence. And although I had bested her this time, I had an inkling she wouldn't stop. And she clearly had some effect on me still, because the word ugly kept rolling around in my head. I knew I shouldn't let her bother me, but it couldn't be helped. Don wouldn't change the fact that more people knew me as Muttly than Clarabelle. I waited for Don at my car, ignoring the glances of students pouring into the parking lot. News really does travel fast here. And sure enough, Don came stumbling out of the double doors, worry pressed into his forehead as his eyes landed on mine. He stalked towards me and I thought he was going to yell or something. But when he reached me, he grabbed my face and kissed me hard. I responded instinctively, forgetting we were still at school. \"Let's get the fuck outta here,\" he whispers against my lips. … No wonder Don had shitty grades. He had the attention span of a five-year-old and the academic drive of a bum. \"Will you cut it out?\" I snap. He keeps kissing me and touching me and I'm actually trying to study. \"Why?\" \"You told me you needed help studying. Christmas break is two weeks and we come back to exams. Are you seriously focusing on trying to get in my pants?\" \"Yes.\" I huff. At least I can't call him a liar. \"Don, I have to focus. Please—\" \"You've been focusing since we got here. Take a break, study my anatomy instead.\" I snort in disbelief and actually lower my pencil so that I can give Don a look. \"That was a terrible line.\" \"It's lucky you're already my girlfriend then, huh?\" I hate that I smile, pleased to hear the word fall from his lips. He smiles, knowing he's bested me. When he moves to kiss me again I nudge him away with my elbow, shaking my head. \"Seriously, I have to finish my homework.\" \"I thought you usually finished this crap during your study break anyway.\" \"Me and Lee had a Captain's Meeting today, remember?\" Don sighed and I realized that this boy wasn't motivated…enough. Feeling like a hooker and refusing to look up from my texts knowing I was about to blush, I said, \"If you finish your work before I have to leave for dinner I'll let you touch my breasts.\" \"That's not fair.\" \"Without my bra on.\" \"…I'm going to get you back for this in the worst way possible.\" \"I'm counting on it.\" I close my book, suddenly realizing I have to use the bathroom. I look at Don and teasingly add, \"And it better be worth my while.\" As I stand he looks at me trying not to look affected. He stares at the pages laid out in front of him, tapping his pencil erratically. \"You're good.\" \"Didja like that?\" \"I'm impressed.\" I curtsy. \"Glad to hear it.\" I quickly do my business and wash my hands. I return to the living room. \"So here's what I'm thinking about our little deal—oh.\" Charles Billingsly looks at me from his position standing over his son. Already Don's jaw is locked tight, and he glances at me with worry as I pause. I wasn't quite expecting his father home until well beyond after I left. Apparently neither did Don. Wringing my hands, I do the only thing I can think of and step forward, smiling in a manner I'm sure appears as awkward as I feel. I extend my hand. \"It's good to finally meet you Mr. Billingsly…sir.\" He stares down at my hand with an expression of disdain and amusement. He looks down at Don. \"You fucking kidding me son?\" He walks away without another word, disappearing in the back. I drop my arm, flushing from embarrassment. Of course, there were rumors that Mr. Billingsly never treated any of the girls Don brought home nicely, but the tone in his voice suggested something crueler than the fact that Don had a girl home. It was the fact that he had brought me home. \"We can leave,\" Don suggested, almost hopefully, as I sat back down on the floor. I reopened my text to the page I had left off on, grabbing my pen. I shook my head. I don't know what made me do it, because I really didn't know what I would do if Mr. Billingsly directed his anger at me or worse, at Don because of me. But hitting Maria the other day had been empowering. It had felt like, for the first time, I had taken back some of the control she had squandered from me in all the years of bullying. Knowing that I could fight back if I needed to had felt good. And I wasn't going to back down now. Of course, I wasn't planning on punching Don's father, but I would show him that no manner of intimidation was going to keep me away from Don unless it was what Don or I wanted. Don wasn't convinced, and he kept glancing at his father's bedroom door until I said, \"Shit, I gotta go. I'm gonna be late.\" I gathered my things as Don stood up beside me. He walked me out in silence and in frustration I said, \"It'll be fine. Try not to worry so much.\" I kiss him quickly before rushing home. I barely make it and Janie pesters me about what Don and I did that afternoon. \"My hymen is still intact if that's the point you're trying to get to,\" I say finally. \"Watch your tone,\" she says as she stabs at her green beans. Then she looks at me and smiles. \"But good to know.\" … The next day at school I'm sitting in the bathroom stall minding my own business when the door opens. I think nothing of it until the girls begin talking. I don't recognize the voices, and they sound very young. I would assume Freshmen or Sophomores by their excited whispers. \"Did you hear about Don last night?\" \"No? What happened? Did he dump that floozy?\" Bitch. \" Pfft, I wish. But you know how Tiffany Thorton lives next door?\" \"She swears she sees Don naked all the time in his room.\" \"Seriously?! No way!\" \"Uh-huh. Totally ripped with a nice package, she swears.\" \"Lucky bitch.\" I'm rolling my eyes, wanting to scream for them to hurry the fuck up. Definitely Freshmen. \"So anyway, Tiffany says they started arguing again last night—\" \"Nothing new—\" \"Not long after that Baker girl left.\" \"No. Way. Did he bust them fucking or something?\" \"It didn't sound like it. Besides, you know she's a total prude. I don't even know what he sees in her.\" \"Wait, so why are you telling me this?\" \"Did it even dawn on you that Don's not at school today? And Tiffany said when Charles left for work this morning, he had a nasty bruise around his eye.\" \"Whoa.\" \"Right. Hey, can I use your mascara, I need a touch up…\" I hardly notice their leave. I sit on the toilet still, pants around my ankles and imagining the worse. No, Don wasn't at school but I just assumed he was skipping or something. But if Mr. Billingsly had a bruise…Christ had they actually come to blows? Because of me? I quickly fix my jeans and flush, forgetting to wash my hands as I grab my bag and make a run for my truck. Suddenly I'm scared. Scared of his condition or if he's angry that I ruined his relationship with his father when it finally seemed off to a good start. This never should have happened. I should've known better than to let us go public. I should've never even dated him. I should've just stuck to my guns and never let him kiss me. Stupid, fucking arrogant charming, son of a bitch! I arrive at the house and I'm surprised to see a familiar car in the driveway. I can't place the owner until they step out of the house and onto the porch. Brian doesn't look particularly surprised to see me, but he holds his stance in front of the door. \"Clara—\" \"Is it true? Please tell me it's not true.\" Brian gives me a look, the truth without having to say anything. I'm sure Don made him promise I wouldn't find out, which could only explain his appearance. But why wouldn't Don call me? I would've come, school or not. \"Let me see him.\" \"Clara, I can't do that.\" \"Brian…move.\" \"I can't.\" I'm shaking, from anger and fear. \"Is he okay?\" With Brian's attitude, I'm half expecting him to say, \"He's not going to make it. I'm sorry.\" Of course if it were that serious, I would hope my competition for Valedictorian would have enough sense to get Don to a hospital. Instead he looks at me gently and says, \"He'll be fine. He just needs to rest.\" \"And I can't go in?\" He shakes his head and frustrated, I allow him to lead me down the stairs. \"It's not serious, Clara. I promise.\" He hardly finishes when I spin on my heel and run for the house. It's a soccer maneuver I've had to use way too often to not have perfected by this point. Not to mention Brian wasn't expecting it. I had an easy head start, so although Brian was fast, I was already in the living room by the time he reached me. Don lay on the couch, a frozen bag of vegetables covering his jaw. He looked at me and then at Brian. \"You suck at this,\" he accused Brian with a faint chuckle. He could still crack jokes. He was fine. Suddenly I feel stupid for panicking. Until he tries to sit up. He struggles, his jaw clenched so tightly I'm sure he'll break his teeth. I know that look from sustaining injuries to my torso. I close the distance between myself and the couch, dropping to one knee as Don collapses. I don't even have his shirt to his chest when I realize I can't see because I'm crying. \"What did he do?\" It's obvious what he did though. Bruises adorn Don's stomach and chest and for a moment I'm terrified that something is seriously broken until Don says, \"It's not as bad as it looks.\" He doesn't seem to have a hard time breathing, the tell-tale sign of a damaged rib. But I'm no doctor and I look between Don and Brian. \"Why the hell aren't you in a hospital?\" \"I hate that damn place,\" he hisses. \"I already tried that, Clara,\" Brian adds. I silently run my fingers across the bruises, looking for a sign of a more serious injury and thankful when I find none. \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive.\" Biting my lip I say, \"Well you can't stay here—\" \"Clara, sweetheart, I can't impose on you and Janie like that. I'm fine here.\" I blush. \"I mean on the couch. It's not good for your…back.\" \"Oh.\" Brian coughs loudly from behind us and I hide a smile. Brian helps me move Don to his bedroom where, when we lay him gently on the mattress, Don sighs a breath of relief. \"God. That does feel better.\" Nothing like a woman's touch. Smiling, I take a seat on the edge and force him to remove the ice pack. His jaw is badly bruised and the softer tissue of his cheek shows signs of swelling. \"You never let me touch your breasts.\" I blush, aghast, but Don laughs. \"Relax, Brian's gone for now.\" I turn. Sure enough Brian has vacated the room, shutting the door behind him. \"It's just you and me.\" Don's tone is suggestive and I stare at him in disbelief. \"You can't be serious. Now?\" \"Why not? I thought girls digged guys with bruises.\" \" Sweetheart ,\" I mimick playfully, \"I could probably break you in half right now.\" He lets out a guttural moan that, so low, almost sounds like an animal growling. I blush, realizing how he took my words and shake my head. \"I meant—\" \"I know what you mean; don't ruin this for me though.\" Smiling, I refrain from explaining that I was only referencing to his weakened condition, not my sexual prowess of which I had none. Don stares at my breast and I roll my eyes. He's not even touching me as long as Brian's here. \"Hey, guys. I'm running to grab some lunch. Want anything?\" Really? Don is smiling so widely that I have to look away or risk rolling my eyes to the point they fall out of my head. \"Nope. We're good. Take as looong as you want. You don't really have to come back—\" I hit his leg roughly. \"We're fine, Brian. Thank you.\" He looks at me. \"What the hell?\" \"Why are you such an ass sometimes?\" \"I was being funny. Chavo knows that. Right Chavo!\" \"No, I didn't catch it.\" Brian laughs and so do I. I hear his car start and when I turn around Don is eyeing me like candy. \"You promised.\" \"If you finished your homework—\" \"Not even in my battered state can you grant me this one reprise? Please?\" \"No, because you need to rest.\" We basically spend the next ten minutes until Brian comes back arguing the terms and conditions of my promises. Don is furious, pouting like a child when Brian steps in. \"Did I miss something?\" \"Nope,\" I say sweetly. \"We're all good.\"[Chapter 16] Sooo...Hi there. I know it's been a while and this chapter isn't as long as usual, but I really wanted to post something so you readers didn't think I had forgotten about you. Hopefully, I can write myself out of this god-awful writer's block and have some more updates for you all sooner rather than later. Enjoy! CHAPTER SIXTEEN A tap at my window slowly drags me out of sleep. My initial assumption is that I'm dreaming until the knocking grows a bit heavier as if in urgency. Slightly worried, I sit up in bed and creep towards the window, not sure what to expect. I slide open the glass, irritated with Don's cheeky grin having nearly given me a heart attack. \"Don, what the hell do you think you're doing out of bed?\" He holds notebook paper that he's scribbled on and I recognize Algebra formulas. \"I finished my homework,\" he announces in a loud whisper. I blink, confused. \"What?\" \"Seriously, Clara?\" I'm delirious with a lack of sleep. \"Are you still trying to touch my boobs?\" I don't need his expression to remind me that that was a stupid question. \"Don, you shouldn't even be out of bed and I have school tomorrow.\" \"I know, I know, but Clara I'm dying here.\" \"I don't care, Don, you're hurt and making it worse. Go home.\" \"No.\" \"Don, this isn't funny.\" His mood drops and I suspect he's about to tell me the real reason he showed up here tonight unexpectedly. \"I left.\" \"What? What do you mean?\" \"I mean, I packed a bag and left. Chavo was supposed to come get me tomorrow so I could stay with him and his folks until things cooled off between me and my dad. But I just…left.\" \"Oh,\" I whisper, shame warming my cheeks. Did I do this? \"Don I'm—\" \"Don't you dare feel sorry for me,\" he whispers, his voice low. \"I'm not sorry.\" I bite my lip nervously. Don takes my face in his hands and kisses me, nearly pulling my body out the window. I clutch the window sill until I realize he's too far for me to touch. Without thinking I pull on his tee, urging him into my bedroom by leaning back, forcing him to follow. He does, eagerly clamoring up the window until he lets out a grunt of pain, falling back to the ground and clutching his side. \"Shit.\" \"Christ, I'm sorry, I forgot.\" \"So did I,\" he chuckles. He looks at me, eyes glinting in the moonlight. \"That's pretty unromantic, huh?\" I smile, shaking my head. Stroking his cheek softly I say, \"Meet me 'round back, okay?\" Locking my door behind me, I lead Don onto my bed where I get him settled on his back. \"Do you need to take something?\" \"I've taken so many somethings lately...\" I crawl into the space between my boyfriend and the wall, lulled by the thought of sleep when Don's hand finds my thigh. \"No.\" \"I didn't do anything.\" \"I'm telling you don't do anything. I need sleep; I can't miss school tomorrow.\" \"I know that. Sheesh, it's like you don't trust me or something.\" I stare at him until he starts laughing at me. \"Relax,\" he whispers, his voice dropping again. I fidget. I can feel his hand stroking the skin of my leg. \"How the hell am I supposed to relax?\" Don turns to face me with a cheeky grin. \"Problem?\" \"Yeah. You.\" He laughs as I turn my back to him, yanking my one pillow out from underneath his head and fluffing it harshly before slamming it back onto the bed and throwing my head atop it. \"Clara, baby, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to be an ass this time, I swear.\" \"Then go to sleep, Don,\" I whine, hating that I'm actually more tense with him lying right beside me than usual. I want nothing more than to roll on top of him but I can't. And he's so close, not even a foot away from me. I can smell his soap, feel the heat radiating off his body and it's driving me insane. I clench my fingers at my side, because if I touch him I'm gone. I don't realize his silence until I feel the bed shift then rise. I turn, sitting up when I realize that he's limping towards the door, his shoulders stiff. \"Where are you going?\" \"I'll leave if I'm bothering you that damn much,\" he stated simply. \"Are you serious? Don, I'm not bothered by the fact that you're here otherwise I wouldn't've let you in.\" \"Then what's with the cold shoulder all of a sudden? If you didn't want me here, I'd rather you just say so.\" \"Don it's not that I don't want you here.\" \"Then what, Clara? Because the back-and-forth with you is really pissing me off.\" \"You, Don! You're driving me insane!\" \"Then why the hell did you let me in?\" I could tell he didn't understand my words, and that was my fault of course. \"Dammit Don, I'm trying to tell you I'm horny and it's because of you!\" I bury my burning face in my hands. \"God, fuck, I hate you,\" I snap into my palms. \"Do you have any idea how frustrating it is being with you? I've never felt this way before and I don't know what I'm doing so if I start acting like a bitch it's not always because I'm angry I'm just…\" I breathe, running my fingers through my hair in frustration but relieved that I've managed to communicate how I really feel. I cross my legs and add on a final note, \"This hasn't just been hard for you. I just…didn't know how to tell you.\" He hasn't moved from his spot standing in the middle of my room and I can't muster the courage to look him in the eyes just yet. After a while I prompt, \"Please say something or I might just die of humiliation.\" He doesn't say anything, but I can tell his breathing has deepened and I feel my heart start to pound in my chest. Out of the corner of my eye, I can make out his figure walking hesitantly towards me but I say nothing. He sits on the edge, dipping the mattress. Even I can see the tent in his sweatpants and I bite my lip hard. \"I didn't know,\" he whispers apologetically. \"How could you?\" \"You just seemed to have so much more control than me,\" he chuckles. \"I mean, I knew you were enjoying it, but I didn't think you were so…frustrated.\" I can hear the smile in his voice and a part of me knew he had to have found some joy in my words. \"I like you better this way,\" he whispers in a husky voice, his lips tauntingly close to my ears. \"You're enjoying this,\" I murmur. I don't think I've ever seen him this…erect, for lack of a better term. And I can only imagine what this conversation has been doing to his ego. In all honesty, I don't know which is bigger. Don leans back with a smile. \"And you're not?\" \"Not particularly, no,\" I mutter under my breath. I would've preferred to keep my feelings to myself. I liked Don a lot, but this feeling of vulnerability that came with it was unnerving. I spent my entire life building a wall around myself because eventually you get sick of crying all the damn time. And in less than a semester he broke that barrier. I wish I knew how, but it happened so suddenly that even I couldn't pinpoint an exact date and time. But the worst part was that a small fraction of my rational self didn't mind the intrusion. No human being willingly lives in solitude. I liked that someone was asking me about my day, my thoughts, my likes, my dislikes. I liked being able to trust someone enough to talk about my father or my insecurities. That isn't easy for me, but Don somehow made it just a bit more manageable. I found myself choking to tell him this, and I press my lips together. Too soon. I didn't want to spoil a moment any more than I already had. Instead, I offer Don a small smile, hoping that it conveys enough of my thoughts to satisfy him for the night. He pushes a strand of hair back from my face and I hold my gaze, taking in the small swell of skin on his jaw from his father. My eyes roam over the rest of his face, recalling the first time I did this, months ago in my bedroom after our first kiss. I feel myself lean forward on the bed, my eyes drooping as I neared my targeted goal. My hands clenched his shirt, fisting the material tightly as I pulled him closer to me. The first kiss was hardly anything worth bragging about, but it started a burning desire in me that only Don could quench, if I let him. Something drove me forward and I kissed him again, harder, my breathing already straggled. I can't quite explain the emotions that came over me, but they were no longer just lustful desires of a teenaged girl making out with her boyfriend. I wanted to touch him, kiss him, and do all that I could to please him, because I felt as though I had done nothing for him this entire time. But before I had the opportunity to say or do anything, Don said, \"Go to sleep. We'll talk more later.\" … Overnight, I seemed to from a nobody to the central hub for gossip at Permian. I got asked if Don really sent Charlie to the hospital, if Don fought defending my honor after we got caught doing it, if it was gang-related…really stupid shit. Some offered their condolences, patting my arms and tossing a smile as if we spoke regularly. By the time I sat down in the cafeteria for lunch, I was almost pining for my solitary confinement in the library. \"You look exhausted,\" Lee commented with a mouthful of salad. \"Don came over last night,\" I say without thinking. When Stasia gasps and Lee sputters with disbelief, I roll my eyes and hold up my hands. \"Not like that.\" \"Then what like?\" Stasia asked. I bite my lip, not sure if this was something I was supposed to be telling anyone. And I certainly didn't want the buzzing cafeteria to overhear, so I leaned in a whispered. \"He left.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean, he packed a bag and left. I had to call Brian early this morning to come get him before Janie busted him in my bed—\" \"You slept together!\" \"Jesus, Stasia,\" I hiss, glancing around. One group of freshmen paused right behind her paused, tilting their heads as if to see if they heard right. Only when they resumed talking, shrugging as if they had misheard, did I sit back down in my seat. \"Christ, watch it. I don't need any more rumors swirling around about me and Don. I really just want this to be as normal as possible, and that can't happen if people are always talking.\" She winced. \"Sorry.\" Then she grinned. \"Please, please, spill.\" I blush, trying not to smile. \"There's nothing to spill.\" \"Liar. It's written all over your face: something happened between you two.\" I looked at Lee who was waiting with curious eyes. I dropped my shoulders in defeat and said, \"I might've mentioned how \"attracted\" to him I was,\" I say. \"What the hell does that even men,\" Lee snaps. \"Were you not attracted to him before?\" \"No, that's not what I meant.\" I glance around us, isolated in our little corner and yet surrounded by so many other students. I couldn't risk it. \"Look, I'll tell you later, okay.\" \"You better,\" Stasia said sternly. \"I can just tell by how red your face is that this is gonna be good.\" ","Summary":" [Summer 1988] CHAPTER ONE They later informed me that the football coach, Mr. Gaines, found me.

For one week, I was the luckiest kid in the world. I don't feel so lucky anymore. There are consequences to helping an alien escape from the government. Because I helped him, only ET got to go home. I should have joined him in the spaceship. The men in Hazmat suits grabbed me the moment ET's ship disappeared. My big brother Michael and his friends tried to fight back, but then the adults pulled out weapons. Mom, who had been watching all of this happening, tried her best to get them to release me, you know, arguing that since the alien was gone, and I was perfectly healthy, they had no right to do anything to me, but they only pushed her away and threw me into the back of a black van. Someone said that I wasn't healthy, I still looked sick. I didn't feel sick. They did radiation tests, sticking me with needles and heart monitors and everything. I even had my hands cuffed to the stretcher because, I guess, they thought I'd pull another escape attempt. I could hear my sister Gertie screaming, but they'd put her in a different truck. \"What are you going to do with her?\" I asked, but the people in space suits weren't much on conversation. The truck kind of looked like an ambulance on the inside, or maybe an FBI surveillance vehicle. They had television cameras, oscilloscopes, radar, and a bunch of scientific equipment. I could hear the crackle of their radios, the squeaking of the reel to reel magnetic tape on their refrigerator sized computers. Still giddy from my recent victory, I chuckled, grinning at my captors. \"We beat you. You'll never see ET again.\" A fat face peered at me through the plastic window on one of the space suits. \"Yeah? That means you'll never see him either.\" I kept smiling. \"It doesn't matter. He can go home now.\" The guy had nothing to say to that. The van rumbled noisily away from the clearing where the spaceship had been. I touched my chest, thinking about ET's last words to me. That he'd always be in my heart. When we at last arrived at our destination, and the men had begun their work, I would be the one crying, \"Home phone.\" Unfortunately, no telephone on earth could fix this.[Chapter 2] The van bumped along for a few more minutes. I heard the crunch of gravel, then the road smoothed out. From my vantage point, I could only see the horizon out the back window, tree branches turning to telephone poles, the stars in the night sky. \"Where are you taking me?\" I asked the suited men, but nobody answered the question. \"When can I see mom again?\" No answer to that either. I stared up at the ceiling, watching the street lights cutting lines across the upholstered surface. My mind flashed back to the events of the previous days. I thought about Jamie, that cute pigtailed girl from my science class. We'd freed a bunch of frogs from dissection. I kissed her full on the mouth. I experienced bodily sensations I never knew I had. I remember feeling giddy, light headed, like I'd had too much cold medicine, but the feelings I had for her were real. She kissed me back. I know she resisted it a little, but she wasn't exactly opposed to it. I had another flash of memory, not mine this time. It was ET, taking a beer out of the fridge at home, drinking it as he watched Casablanca . I get this feeling that he somehow `pushed' me to kiss Jamie, sending this thought like `Okay kids, go to town.' Strangely, it got me thinking about dad. I could never figure out how mom and dad got together. My only guess is that alcohol had been involved. Maybe he's alcoholic still. Mom doesn't like to talk about him. The week ET showed up, we were so desperate to see dad again that we dug through his old stuff, and were smelling his shirts, you know, to remember him. I saw another mental flash, this one of a chemical equation. I didn't know what it meant, nor, in my current situation, could I write any of it down. Something about plants. The image faded with the lights flickering on the van roof. I awoke to the sound of an angry buzzing noise and the rattle of a fence. Through the back window, I saw coils of barbed wire and red lights moving around. I heard someone up front talking about security clearances. The back doors opened, and I found a group of men in army fatigues shining their flashlights in my face. The doors closed again, and the van rolled to a stop somewhere. After a long delay, they took my stretcher out, and I got wheeled through a long plastic temporary tunnel, similar to the one they set up around the house the day they came for ET. It looked like the inside of a vacuum cleaner hose, with windows. The tube ended in a sterile hospital corridor. They pushed me past a set of double doors, and they took me off the bed, ordering me to strip and stand on a conveyor belt in a decontamination station. It reminded me of something I saw in a movie, maybe Doctor No or that one about the space virus. I got sprayed with water, chemicals, powders, baked in a heat lamp, you name it, and then, at the end of the whole process, I didn't even get my clothing back. Instead they made me wear a white jumpsuit. Despite all these precautions, my captors still wore space suits around me. They told me to follow them. When I refused, they just grabbed me, dragging me into a padded cell. I screamed and tried to run out, but they only injected me with sedative. I awoke alone, imprisoned in the little room. I curled into a ball and cried. My cell had a mirror. I'd seen enough cop shows to know that it was a two way. I'd played around with a few at funhouses before. If you pressed your face right up against the glass and cupped your hands around to block the light, you could sometimes see through to the other side. On the other side of the wall, they had a setup like IBM, a whole bay of those refrigerator sized computers with reel to reel tape, a movie camera propped up against the mirror to record my every move. Nobody sat at the desks - it seemed they'd all gone to lunch, or breakfast, or gone home for the day. I sat down on the floor, absently staring at the white walls. One time when I was bad, dad threatened to lock me in a room and give me nothing to read but Mary Worth comics. I wondered where my comics were. I thought about the lessons I taught ET about my world. They seemed so dumb. I didn't teach him anything important about our history or culture or anything, I just showed him my toys. What must his people think of us? \"The human told me they eat a thing called a peanut. It is a large porcelain thing you put metallic coins inside. They must have terrible indigestion. Humans also enjoy torturing fish with little plastic idols.\" That's if ET understood a word I was saying at all. If he had to write a report on us, I figured it was going to be pretty bad. How old was he anyway? He looked like an old man, but he could have been a kid. It had been night when I'd been captured. Making an educated guess, I figured I'd awakened right around the time to watch crappy daytime TV, General Hospital, As The World Turns , One Day at a Time , and Bob Vila. Roughly 11 A.M. I guess Indians aren't the only ones who gauge time based on mythology. Anyone can tell you that kids have a low tolerance for boredom. We can't just sit in silent introspection for hours at a time. I started picking apart the wall padding. Admittedly, not an easy task, but I had grown my fingernails long enough, and it looked like someone had worked on the pad a little beforehand. I teased the stuffing out, then gasped in surprise as a key fell to the floor. Not a key to my cell. That only opened from the outside. I sat on the floor, pretended not to be concealing it inside my jumpsuit. Feeling an ache in my stomach, I peered through the window again. I saw only one person in the computer room, some buzzcut guy in a green uniform. I knocked to get his attention, but he was busy on the phone. \"Colonel North, please,\" I could just barely hear him saying. He followed this with something indistinct. I pressed my ear to the glass. \"...I'm not seeing any weapon potential here. It's just a kid. The thing got away from us.\" He started discussing transfers of guns and ammunition. Losing interest, I knocked harder. He glanced in my direction, kept talking on the phone. I slumped back on the floor. An hour later, two men in spacesuits put a caged monkey in my cell. I thought about sneaking past them, but these are grown men we're talking about. They shut the door, leaving me alone with the thing. I guess they were trying to see if I had a disease that would kill someone, like how they put canaries in coal mines. I would have let the chimp out, but the cage had a padlock on the lid, a padlock that didn't match the shape of my key. The monkey started off screeching and looking antsy, but when I looked him in the eyes, he calmed down. \"Yeah,\" I muttered. \"I'm a prisoner here too.\" The chimp grunted, stuck its paw between the bars. I shook it, and I got a monkeyshine. ...And Gertie's hair ribbon. \"Hey! Where did you get that!\" The chimp put a finger to his big lips, indicated the room number with hand signs. I glanced at the door, groaning in frustration. \"It's no use. I can't even get out of this cell!\" The monkey grinned.[Chapter 3] The monkey didn't offer me any immediate solutions to my imprisonment, but he did offer me a banana. I was so starved that I actually ate it. \"Thank you...Did you get anything to eat?\" The chimp whimpered a little, rubbing his belly. The message seemed to be `It's okay, I'll be fine.' \"What's your name?\" It responded with sign language. I don't know anything about ASL, but I had this... feeling that it was supposed to mean Henry...and when I looked into his eyes, I also had a hunch that it had its own name, something that didn't translate directly into English. It more or less meant `Strength.' I noticed he had a cut on his foot. It appeared as if he'd been given some rough treatment by his captors. Feeling sorry for him, I touched the wound and found myself saying \"Ouch,\" without even thinking about why. I felt, I don't know, some kind of warm energy flowing from my hand to the monkey's injury, and then my finger's glowing. When I noticed what was happening, and saw the wound healing up, I yelped and hid my hand up my sleeve. \"Oh shit oh shit!\" I'd seen enough movies to guess that if they saw me glowing, or making objects levitate with my mind, the government people would never let me leave. I tucked my finger into my armpit, waited for that part of my prison uniform to stop shining like a Glo-Worm. The light slowly but surely died out. Well, as far as I could tell. I backed away from the cage, staring at the chimp, and my hand. I briefly entertained a strange thought, that maybe ET thought of himself as the kid in the padded room, and I was the monkey in the cage. I sat on the floor, listening to the primate making soft \"Ook\" noises as it stared back at me. There was something weird and gentle about Henry's eyes. When the light reflected off its pupils in just the right way, I caught a flash of something like a memory...but not, like it were happening right now. I saw the interior of a spaceship, one that looked like a forest. A group of five creatures, members of ET's species, huddled around a big tree in its center, silently working together on mysterious projects. Squat little frog-like bodies, large heads, light brown-olive skin. To the untrained eye, the aliens all looked the same, but you could say the same about human beings. If you looked closely at these ET's, they had distinguishing features, birthmarks, scars, one even had a little facial hair. I knew which one was my ET. The navigator had his hands on a set of glowing crystalline mushrooms. Somehow the things allowed him to see the ship's position in space without a window. I think it connected to his mind. Other aliens were busy... gardening . They had samples of plants from all over earth, some really beautiful stuff from Hawaii and Japan. One of them was putting Gertie's pot of geraniums in better soil. I saw a bunch of vegetation that I didn't recognize from any encyclopedia, stuff from other planets with names that I didn't recognize, but came to me when I looked at them. Their ship provided everything they needed. The plants gave them air, food, juice, even a source of electrical power. The ship also had a...basement, where they kept zoological specimens. I got the sense that this were a kind of Noah's ark. Near the sleeping quarters on the lower floor, he lay in a reclining bed that looked like a pumpkin somehow grown in the shape of a chaise lounge. The glowing roots of the big console tree upstairs came down in this place, wreathing his body, connecting with a pair of crystal mushrooms at the head of his bed. Another alien observed...something in ET's brain. They seemed to be debriefing him. A crystal orb near the bed displayed scenes from earth, straight from his brain. The first thing I saw were clips of urban poor in places like Syria, Lebanon and West Germany throwing rocks at tough looking guys with riot shields, you know, the kind of stuff Peter Jennings shows all the time on World News Tonight. For a soundtrack, I heard John Mellencamp's Hurts So Good . I saw an atom bomb exploding, archival footage of Nazis goose stepping through Berlin, and the inside of my closet. ET spent a lot of time in that closet, so much that it looked like his crystal got stuck for a moment, but then i saw him playing with my radio, listening to Come on Eileen and Journey's Wheel in the Sky . He hid...a lot. Like a dream, it flashed to the reasons why, all those men in biohazard suits. So that's what ET's doing, I thought. Giving his report. And then I see myself in the orb, not a memory, but of me as I was at that very moment, in the padded cell. ET reached out to me...in the exact direction I watched him from. \"Elliott!\" I saw a blinding flash, and the vision disappeared. I found myself curled up in a ball on the floor. I could only hope I hadn't been glowing the whole time. An hour later, the men came and took Henry away. The monkey screeched and clawed at the sides of the cage as it bumped the threshold of my cell. Before disappearing, it slyly flashed me a thumb's up, then pretended to be sucking its thumb like a monchichi. When the door clicked shut, I noticed it didn't close all the way. Henry had stuck something into the locking mechanism.[Chapter 4] I crept up to the door, listening for sounds of people. When I heard nothing, I cracked the door, peering into the hallway. I knew they had cameras recording me behind the two way, but judging by what I had seen a few minutes ago, nobody was actually watching. It definitely looked like a hospital. I hate hospitals. Gray corridors stretching both ways, into a maze of other gray corridors. I had to find a way out. Somehow. But first, Gertie. Nobody seemed to be patrolling the hallways, at least for the moment. Like a hospital, they had signs telling you directions. Although it might have been clever to throw people off by not having any, the government didn't want their employees getting lost on the way to the bathroom... or Room 206. I tiptoed down the corridor to my left, peering around the corner. I saw a security guard stepping into a restroom. I had to go too, but this wasn't the time. I followed the signage, checking the numbers on the closed metal doors. Hearing footsteps coming my way, I ducked into a breakroom, diving under a table. A pair of boots clomped in. I watched the figure in green clothing put change into a Coke machine. He grabbed a glass bottle, tugged on it, but the roll bars refused to let go of the product. He shook the machine, kicked it with his boot, tried to pull the bottle free again. \"Son of a bitch.\" Still grumbling, he bought a packet of cigarettes from the machine next to it. The moment he lit up, the Coke popped out of the other machine, shattering on the floor. The liquid pooled my way, seeping under the table. The man swore, got himself a coffee instead. I heard him slurp the drink, then flinched as he noisily snatched up wads of paper towels. He squatted down to clean up the mess. My heart leapt into my throat when I saw his head turning my way. With as much silence as I could muster, I darted out from under the table, racing into the hallway with my pulse pounding in my head. 201...202... When I found the door, I pulled out the key, trying it in the lock. It didn't work. I mean, why would it? Some guy just tucked it in the padded wall. I sighed. If Gertie was in there, how was I to get her out? I heard bootsteps again. It wasn't very smart to make noise, but I had to know if Henry was right, so I knocked. \"Gertie!\" I hissed. No answer. \"Gertie!\" Any louder and the guy in boots would hear me. I kept knocking. \"Big brother?\" \"Gertie!\" \"How'd you get out?\" she asked. \"It doesn't matter! I...I'm going to get you out of there...somehow.\" I glanced back up the hallway, trying to think if I'd seen any place that might contain a bobby pin or a paper clip. The door popped open, and there was my sister, also clad in a bland prison uniform, her hair robbed of decoration. I didn't ask how the door got open. There wasn't time. She rushed up and hugged me, crying on my chest. \"I want mommy!\" I rubbed her back. \"Me too. C'mon. Let's get out of here.\" Easier said than done. Nothing was clearly labeled `exit' except a fire door that would set off an alarm the moment you pushed on the handle. I had to steer Gertie away from it. I figured the men hadn't taken me far from their front door, so I retraced my steps back toward my cell. Admittedly not the greatest plan, but it was all I could think of at the moment. \"How did you get out?\" I whispered as I led her past my room. \"I don't know. It just came open. What about you?\" \"A monkey helped me.\" \"Henry, you mean?\" I stopped, gawking at her. \" That's really his name? How...?\" She shrugged, answering my question the wrong way. \"I asked the nice lady with the granola bars.\" I frowned. \"You got granola bars?\" Gertie nodded. \"What did you get for breakfast?\" \"Never mind,\" I groaned, pulling her further down the tunnel. We snuck past a room full of ladies with electric typewriters, file cabinets and noisy phones. The air was filled with the sounds of clacking, phone conversations, mimeograph and Xerox machines. They had a fancy new telephone that made copies. That thing made a lot of noise too. \"I think that black lady saw us,\" Gertie whispered. Scowling, I glanced back for a second. There was literally only one non-white face in the sea of women in skirted military uniforms. The woman didn't look up from her hammering typewriter. \"C'mon,\" I muttered. \"She looks lonely.\" \"Do you want to keep her company, or do you want to see mom?\" Gertie whimpered and clutched my hand. We cracked a set of double doors, slipped into the next hallway. Spotting a guard in a glass windowed security booth, we both ducked, creeping around below his field of vision. \"What now?\" Gertie hissed. \"I don't know. If we move that door in any way, he'll see us.\" I heard gibbering noises, then the door to the booth creaked open. \"Henry!\" Gertie exclaimed. \"Shh!\" I pointed to the door we'd been trying to sneak through. \"But what about Henry?\" I heard the guard shouting as the monkey screeched and attacked him. \"I think he's helping us. C'mon.\" The door next to the booth was locked, but the key actually worked. We entered another gray hallway. \"Now what do we do?\" my sister asked. \"I...haven't thought that far ahead.\" Hearing the sound of clopping high heels, we pressed our backs against a door, the recessed frame offering us a slight amount of concealment. The heels clopped closer. A female figure stepped around the corner. White lady, red hair, gray pantsuit. \"Hey!\" Gertie cried. \"It's the nice lady!\" She moved her arm to wave, but I held it down. \"We can't trust her!\" The woman smiled, marched closer and waved to us. \"Hello, children.\" A moment later, Henry came scampering up to her, climbing up on her shoulder. It made soft \"Ook\" noises, saying `I'm sorry' with its face. The woman fed him a biscuit. The door behind me came open, and a pair of soldiers grabbed us.[Chapter 5] They split us up again. I thought the men were going to drag me back to my cell, but they instead took me to a kiddie room. It had a puzzle piece playmat on the floor, educational toys, shelves full of children's books, a little kid sized couch, and a round table with a He-Man Castle Grayskull playset. Since it was no use running from the guards, I sat down at the table and played with the action figures, flipping the Jawbridge open, posing Skeletor. A guy in a gray wool herringbone suit came in with a folder, a pint carton of milk and one of those peel lid disposable bowls of Cheerios. He set the food and a spoon in front of me, pulling up a chair. \"You were in close contact with the creature, and we weren't sure what toxins it spread to you.\" I dug into the cereal, not bothering to look up at the guy's face. \"We had to make sure you weren't carrying anything contagious, so we had you under observation for twelve hours.\" He was the kind of guy that crossed his legs, probably a shrink. I didn't respond or look at him. \"Henry seems fine. Since you've already been through decontamination, I think it's safe to assume that there isn't a health risk.\" He slid an 8X10 color photograph across the table, one depicting a strange assemblage of things from my house: An umbrella, Gertie's Speak & Spell, a Fisher Price record player with a saw blade on the turntable. \"We found this in the forest. What does it do?\" I swallowed. Before taking our last bike ride together, ET instructed me to load the basket and my backpack with those items. I didn't know what the hell he wanted them for, but I knew they were important. After the first mile, I really wanted to ditch that heavy phonograph. \"Why are you asking me?\" I said in between mouthfuls. \"You were with the creature. You saw it put this together.\" He was right. I knew it was a space phone, but I didn't feel like talking. \"Initially, we thought your friend had reverse engineered the turntable to serve as a wind turbine , using the movements of a tree to spin the saw blade, but the amount of scratch marks from the fork seem to be a little... light for electricity. You get what I'm saying?\" I didn't answer. A glance upward told me all I needed to know about the man. His name was Keys, the long nosed brunette guy that had been hounding me and ET the moment called the cops. He showed me a picture of the saw blade with the fork tied to the phonograph's center spindle, then a close-up of the scratches. \"Anyways, they were saying you would have gotten a better charge from cranking it by hand.\" I mutely set the bowl aside, playing with the toys. \"We think that the umbrella serves as a parabolic reflector, and the dismantled Speak & Spell seems to be set up for the sending and receiving messages, but we still can't figure out what the turntable is used for. Care to enlighten me?\" I'd seen ET tinkering with the inner parts of the phonograph, but I had no clue what he was doing. You'd need a degree in electronics. \"I don't know. I'm just a kid.\" The man leaned forward. \" A very special kid. You've just been in contact with an intelligence possessing technology far surpassing our own by several decades.\" \"That doesn't make me a genius.\" \"It doesn't make you stupid, either...Elliott, where's Michael? \" \"What?\" \"Your brother. He and his friends ran off into the woods when we captured you. Any idea where he may have gone?\" I shrugged. \"He probably went home. The only thing we planned for was helping ET.\" \"We checked your house already. And his friend's houses. Even your mother doesn't know where to look, and she's worried sick . You must have some idea where he was going.\" I had a mental image of him and his friends ditching their bikes and hiding in a nearby lake until the search party went away. There was a natural cave they knew about, one you had to swim to, to get inside. They had a stash of supplies, beer, canned oysters, beef jerky, a couple cans of pork and beans. They started a fire in the little cavern, drying their clothing. The can of beans blew up because they didn't open it before placing it on the flames. \"Why do you think I know anything? I was in the back of your van the whole time.\" The man steepled his fingers. \"He never said anything to you? Never mentioned any places he might try to hide out?\" \"What time is it?\" I asked as I dropped the Whiplash action figure through a trapdoor in the little castle. \"Why? You got to be somewhere?\" I opened my mouth to say something, but then a labcoated guy came in, whispering something to my interrogator. The two left the room in a hurry. I spotted a camera on the ceiling, but I figured I could still sneak a couple items out, something to aid my escape. In the corner, they had a Discovery Toys Marbleworks kit. I pocketed the marbles, then checked around the bookcases. On one shelf, I found a Badge-A-Minit button, one reading `IALAC', corresponding to the `I Am Loveable and Capable' kids book about self esteem gathering dust in the corner. The book was depressing, but the button could easily be dismantled, exposing the sharp and pointy thing inside. I tried to take apart a GI Joe vehicle, but it was all bendy or brittle plastic, so I instead worked on a die cast metal car, attempting to pry the tires off its axle. The room had only one door, but when I bounced a super ball off the roof, I noticed the ceiling panels could be moved. I quietly set the He-Man stuff on the floor, climbing up on the table. I couldn't quite reach. When I tried scaling the bookcase, the doors came open again, and a pair of men grabbed me, dragging me into a big white room with padded walls and an observation window where a bunch of serious looking people in labcoats stood around, staring at me. The put me in a chair, strapping probes to my head. \"We reviewed the tape,\" Gertie's `Nice Lady' called from the booth. \"You appear to have a glowing personality. \" I sunk in my chair, staring at the woman in horror. I thought about things to say, but all of it made me sound like a freak. I bit my tongue. \"Henry had a scratch on his leg, and now it's gone. On the cameras, we saw a light coming from your person. Care to explain?\" \"I smuggled a flashlight,\" I muttered. \"As for the cuts, maybe you just gave him really good bananas. \" \"Nice try. We checked your clothing when you came in. There would have been only one way for you to sneak something like that in here, and we didn't see you walking funny.\" \"You were dragging me the whole time... And I... have an iron constitution.\" Of course they had to check my pockets then. When a soldier reached into my pocket, the sharp from the badge stuck him in the hand. The moment he had his hand out, staring at his bloody hand, I punched him in the crotch, ripping the probes off my head. I wasn't a total idiot. The door had been cracked a little. I actually did make it out into the open. What I didn't plan for was the guy standing in the hallway. He pinned my arms behind my back, dragging me to the door. I heard a low rumble, like somebody running a bulldozer, then the power went out. The guy got distracted, loosening his grip just enough for me to escape his arms. I ran blindly in the dark, in some random direction. My chest was glowing. For a moment, I covered my heart, but then let it shine so I could see where I was going. I was okay until the backup lights came on. I bumped into the guy that had made all that mess in the break room earlier. \"Hey, what's the rush? Got someplace to be?\" \"I got lost looking for the bathroom.\" The man gave me a skeptical smirk. \" Right. In that case, I'll show you to the facilities.\" And he started dragging me back the way I came. I heard another rumble and the emergency lights flickered out. Dust rained from the ceiling. I was still glowing, so the man didn't let go. I think his radio had warned him. The emergency lights returned. As the man carried me down the hallway a bit, a door swung open, and the \"Lonely black lady\" from the secretary pool sprayed my captor in the eyes with a can of mace. Although army guys have eye spraying like that as part of their training (or is it the police?) the lady followed it up by hitting him in sensitive areas and sweeping his legs out from under him. \"C'mon,\" she hissed to me. \"Let's get you out of here.\" \"Who are you?\" She shushed me, leading Gertie out of a closet. \"You're glowing,\" my sister said. \"I know. They're not going to let me leave.\" The woman glanced back and forth down the hallway. \"We'll just see about that!\" More rumbling sounds. More dirt came down from the ceiling. \"What's that? Is someone bombing us?\" The stranger laughed. \"Honey, that's the fault line . Didn't you watch the weather report?\" \"Why are you helping us?\" \"I'm not just a secretary, I'm a mother . I see a child in danger, I try to help them. I don't care what color you are, kids is kids. \" The woman knew her way around the place. In a few minutes, we neared something that looked like an exit. It was a long hallway, with rows of doors on both sides, and a fire exit at its end. The woman fished a set of keys out of her pocket, apparently to unlock the alarm box. Before we could reach the big metal door, I heard guns being cocked and chambered, people shouting \"Freeze!\" I looked back and saw we'd been surrounded by army guys, each of them pointing pistols at us. One of them barked out his orders in clipped militaristic fashion, like he were biting the words out rather than talking. \"Make one move toward that exit and we can and will open fire! Do we have an understanding?\" \"Sir yes sir!\" the woman answered in a shrilly voice, slowly raising her hands in the air. \"Step back from the children and place your hands over your head!\" \"Why?\" the woman protested. \"So you can kill me?\" \"I repeat! Step back from the children with your hands on your head! I will not ask again!\" For some reason, the situation made me think of an angry chihuahua guarding its turf. I thought they would start shooting, but then the whole building shook, a big jagged fissure cracking the walls and the floor. The red backup lights went out. The door exploded, and I saw something like lightning flashing through the doorway. A cold fog rolled in, and the hallway filled with brilliant light. A robed angelic figure strode into the building. As it came closer, I saw that it wasn't an angel, it looked like a saucer man from one of those UFO abduction stories. Big head, almond shaped eyes, silver suit. My chest started glowing as it waved to me. \"They came for me!\" I cried. \" ET really went home and sent his friends back for me!\" The alien nodded vigorously, giving frantic waves in the direction of the glowing light. I noticed it adjusted its head a little after each nod. \"Sugar,\" the woman hissed in my ear. \"Let's go while the gettin's good. Your father's in the Jeep. \" I stared at her. \"What?\" For a moment, I thought I was dreaming this whole thing, you know, because of the highly unusual events being paired with dialog that doesn't make any sense. But then the alien picked up Gertie, making a mad, un-alien dash to the light. My companion grabbed my hand, rushing me after him. A second later, the guards opened fire. We burst out into a parking lot illuminated by a bunch of phosphor flares and big battery powered flood lamps, dashing to the side door of an army Jeep. The alien's head came off, and I saw my brother's curly haired one emerge, scowling at a leg wound that dripped blood on his silver pants. Wincing a little, he popped the door and jumped in with my sister in tow. And there the man was , square jawed, thick limbed, a bit paunched around the middle, clad in army fatigues, his black hair tucked under an army cap. He gave the secretary a wink. \"Hey, baby. Nice job back there.\" She hurried to the driver's side. \"Tell me that when we're out of this place.\" I gawked at the figure in camo. \"Dad?\" The man clicked his teeth at me. \"Hey kid.\" He mussed my hair. \"It's been a long time! \"[Chapter 6] Secretary Lady ducked as a bullet pinged off the Jeep's hood. \"Steve! Let's go!\" Dad shrugged, giving me an apologetic look. \"You heard the lady. \" He threw the door open and hoisted me into the cab, into the back. Gunshots shattered one of the headlights, struck against the exterior door paneling. The woman hopped in, starting the engine. Ignoring the diagram on the knob, she gave the gear shift a slight cursory wiggle, shoving it into drive and pressing down the pedal. The Jeep made angry grinding sounds in protest, jolting ahead through a cookie cutter military standard army base. When she shifted gears again, dad grabbed her hand. \"Sweetie...\" \"Fine! You drive!\" Under her breath, she cursed the manual transmission. She sped around the corner of a barracks, stopping behind a wall. I think dad enjoyed trading seats, because she wore a skirt. Well, until the soldiers shot out the back window and popped the spare tire. Dad shifted into drive the proper way, speeding around a mess hall as soldiers yelled and fired at us. We kept ducking down. The Jeep careened toward the front entrance of the complex. I saw a pillbox, guards, and a suspicious looking speed bump. \"Wait,\" said the woman. \"There's a bunch of road spikes up ahead. How are we going to get past `em?\" Dad grinned. \"Easy peazy. From what I've heard, Elliott here made a bunch of bicycles fly up into the air, soared right over a police car . Isn't that right, Elliott?\" I swallowed. \"That wasn't me! That was ET! Why-?\" Dad laughed. \"Relax. I was just Joshing you.\" To Secretary Lady, he said, \"Honey, you remember how I told you I mucked up the works-\" As he spoke, Gertie was leaning forward in her seat, holding her hand out in front of her with a determined look on her face. I would have thought it silly except for the fact her hand was glowing. The Jeep flew up over the bump, and actually floated in midair for a whole second . \"Holee shit!\" Dad cried. \" I thought that was just a story! \" The Jeep crashed down on the pavement a couple feet past the obstacle, jarring everyone in their seats. The ironic thing was, a set of road spikes popped out of the ground the moment we were rolling away. \"Jesus,\" Dad muttered. Secretary Lady crossed her arms. \"I thought you mucked up the works.\" \"I did too, babe.\" Dad mashed the accelerator to the floor. \"I did too.\" The front end of the Jeep collided with the gate, its chain links rumbling noisily beneath our tires. We rolled down a freeway. Behind us, I could see some army vehicles, but we'd put distance between them and us. That distance became greater when dad radioed a couple semis on his CB, making them block up both lanes behind us when we passed. We drove for a few miles in silence. Dad cocked a thumb at the woman. \"Kids, this is Ruby. Ruby, these are my kids.\" She leaned over the seat, smiling at us. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"So,\" Dad said. \" Elliott. I hear you've been hanging around with little green men.\" \"He's not green,\" I muttered. \"His chest glows,\" Ruby said. \" I saw it. \" \"You're not contagious, are you son?\" \"I don't think so.\" \"Your sister can lift cars. I think she got the better end of the deal.\" He grinned. \"Little Yoda. \" Dad glanced back at my brother, who was currently bandaging his leg. \"Hey, Mike! How you holding up back there?\" Michael looked kind of grim. \"The bullet's still in there. I think I should probably get a doctor.\" \"Ixnay on the octor day. I promise we'll have it yanked out the first stop we get to.\" I frowned at Michael. \"How did you find dad?\" \"He kinda found me.\" Dad leaned back in his seat. \"I was just buzzing by the old house, you know, to see how the ex and her kids were doing, when I see this big tent over the house, and helicopters, and black vans all over the place. I've pretty much been stalking you kids ever since.\" \"How's mom?\" \"She's out of her mind with worry. Unfortunately, there's also a black van parked out across the street, so you're not going to be able to go home for a very long time.\" He turned down a dirt road, into a seedy looking trailer park, rolling to a stop behind an even seedier single wide with rusty siding. \"All right, guys. Everybody out.\" I scowled in suspicion. \"What are we doing here? \" \"Swapping cars. We can't be seen driving around a stolen government vehicle, can we?\" He hopped out, unlocked the door of an ugly blue Torino, waved us over. \"C'mon, Chinese fire drill! Wanna get out of here before the owner of the trailer gets home!\" We raced over there, Michael limping at the rear behind Gertie. Not a great car. You had to fold the seat to get in back since it only had two doors. Dad started it up, and we were speeding off again. My brother took off his spaceman outfit, changing into jeans and an Iron Maiden t-shirt. That was kind of annoying because we didn't have much room to move around, and he elbowed us a couple times. He winced as he re-wrapped his leg. \"So...\"I said. \" Dad. Is Ruby...your new wife?\" Ruby chuckled. \"Steve...?\" \"It's, uh, a common law type of situation...We'll talk about it later.\" \"Common law!\" Ruby mocked. \"You know damn well-!\" He grabbed her hand. \"Looks like we'll have to talk a little, too.\" \"What's there to talk about? Either you-\" \"Rubes. Sweetie. I love you. But we got a couple kids glowing in the dark, and another with a gunshot wound in his leg. This isn't a particularly... romantic situation we're in right now.\" She slipped her hand out of his grip. \"Fine. But you owe me. \" My brother looked pale, and he kept wincing. Without thinking, I reached out and touched his wound. \"Ouch.\" Michael rolled his eyes. \"Seriously, Elliott? That's not fun-\" My glowing hand silenced his objection. I pressed my hand against his bandage. My brother screwed up his face in pain. \"Hey! That burns! Stop that!\" I pulled my hand away. Michael furrowed his brow, undoing the bandage. He stared. \"Oh my God! The wound's closing up!\" \"Tell him to stop,\" Dad scolded. \"If the skin closes up around that bullet, it's going to infect-\" I heard something clunk onto the floor. \"Dad,\" Michael said. \"The bullet's out.\" \"Huh. Never mind then . Guess we won't need those sewing needles and bottles of vodka after all.\" \"You sure? I mean, I'm still kind of in pain... \" \"Not until you're twenty one.\" \"So why are you glowing?\" Dad asked me. \"What's with the power? Did you get bit by a space spider, or did your alien probe you?\" I could only shrug. \"I don't know. I just...kinda... thought different after spending time with him. Of course, I did kinda touch him.\" Gertie grinned, proudly announcing, \"I put ET in a dress!\" \"Hell, Elliott, maybe you should have given him a manicure! You could have lifted spaceships and shit!\" \"Steve!\" Ruby scolded. \"These are kids! Language!\" \"What? Shit's a medical term. First you say it, then you do it.\" She rolled her eyes. Dad sighed, silently driving for a minute. \"Rubes, I'm sorry about the job...I know you had to go through a lot of racial... crap to get where you were...I know we're not exactly living in the fifties anymore, but I know life had just gotten a lot harder for you, especially with the recession...All I can say is, I'm sorry.\" Ruby put her hands on her hips. \"Are you kidding? I just saw a little girl make a car float in the air!\" \"You are ever the found of optimism. Guess that's why I love you so much.\" \"And you're absolutely certain my ass has nothing to do with it?\" He snickered. \" I wouldn't say that wasn't a factor , but it's not the factor. \" \"I think I'm going to be sick,\" Michael groaned. \"I'm not surprised. You just got shot in the leg...Speaking of which... \" He rolled into the parking lot of a cheap motel. Since we didn't know if we were truly in the clear, dad told us to stay in the car with Ruby, and to drive off if anything went south. Lucky for us, it didn't. A few minutes, and he was unlocking a two bedroom special, waving us in. We rushed into the room. The first thing dad did was make Michael lay down on the bed while he checked the wound. He found nothing but a scar. \"Oh my God, Elliott,\" he muttered. \"Whatever it is that you have, we need to bottle it up and sell it to folks.\" Dad got up from the bed, resting against a dresser. \"I'm going to grab you guys's dinner. You kids need to stay in here until we get you some new clothes. Taco John's okay?\" Ruby checked my jumpsuit size, then my sister's. \"How are you paying for all this?\" I asked. \"First National Bank of Couche-Mattress. Open twenty four hours, no minimum deposit.\" \"I have no interest in where this joke is going,\" Ruby muttered. Dad snapped a finger at her. \" Interest free banking! \" \"Could you get me a dessert pizza?\" Mike muttered. \"One dessert pizza.\" \"Can I get one too?\" Gertie asked. Dad clicked his teeth at her. \" Only if you can make it fly out of the restaurant. \" He chuckled and rubbed her hair. \"Sugar, you can get anything you want. \" Both he and Ruby stepped outside for a moment. I peered around the corner, to tell them I didn't want tater tots, but they were making out. My presence did not go unnoticed, nor did my staring, for when they pulled apart, dad asked, \"You're not prejudiced, are you son?\" I shook my head. Honestly, I was thinking more about mom, and what she thought about it. \"I think he just ain't seen that many black folks. He's been out in the suburb...\" Dad snickered, sliding one hand around her hip. \"Poor kid.\" \"Child, you don't know cooking until you've tried a black woman's cooking!\" Dad grinned and slapped his paunch. \"She ain't lyin'! We're going to be spending some time together. Who knows, maybe you'll get to find out!\" He glanced down at Ruby's outfit. \"Maybe you should stay here too. You're still in uniform.\" \"What about you?\" \"Got a change of clothes in the trunk.\" \"That's a handy place for it.\" \"Smartass.\" \"Shoot. They probably have my place on lockdown by now, don't they?\" \"Probably.\" He paused. \"Hey, come to think of it, I think I do still have your Oakland A's tee and a pair of hot shorts back there...\" \"Why didn't you give `em back? Plannin' to try them on?\" \"No ma'am! Just like to keep your memory fresh in my mind.\" \"You be sniffin' them, huh?\" They both laughed. Dad changed into some street clothes he had in the trunk, a faded red 49ers shirt ( \"Son, you can learn a lot about life from O.J. Simpson\" ) and Jordaches with oil spots along the legs. He didn't have the Oakland shirt he thought he had, so Ruby got an Allied Chemical shirt instead. The white hot shorts were barely decent, but it's all he had in the trunk. Dad drove off, and we hid in the motel room. Nothing about us on the news. People in some foreign country were throwing rocks and fire bombs again, and then there was some boring thing with President Reagan. \"I wanna watch Scooby Doo,\" said Gertie. My brother sat next to the window, peering through the venetian blinds. \"We gotta keep it on this channel to make sure we're not on any news reports.\" She pouted. \"You're just saying that because you want to watch Knight Rider.\" \"What's wrong with Knight Rider?\" He suddenly frowned, waving us back. \"Guys! Hide! \" I crawled under the bed with Gertie, watching with anxious dread as Ruby joined my brother at the blinds. \"What do you see out there?\" \"I don't know,\" Michael muttered. \"It's a black van.\" Ruby stared out for a moment, then let the slats drop. \"It's just pest control. See those cans they're carrying around?\" Michael furrowed his brow. \"So why do they have Geiger counters? \" Ruby cracked the blinds again, took one glance out, closed them hastily. \"Shit!\" The two retreated from the window, pressing their backs to the wall.[Chapter 7] Ruby cracked the blinds again. \"Children, hide in the bathroom. I got an idea.\" We did what we were told, Michael locking the door behind us. A moment later, the `exterminators' came stomping around in our hotel room. \"Oh thank God!\" I heard Ruby saying. \"This place is just crawling with bedbugs. I turned over that picture on the wall, and it's like they're having a party. And don't get me started on the duvet and the closet.\" More stomping. I heard the oil can clicking of one of those manual pump sprayer things. \"Anything in the bathroom?\" a man asked. \"Haven't really checked in there, but you know how those things hate the light.\" The knob turned and clanked as the man tried to enter. Ruby laughed. \"Oh right. Sorry. My boyfriend's in there. Poor baby got the squirts . Swears it's from my cooking, but I know that can't be it. \" Mike let out a dramatic groan, squeezing a large shampoo bottle into the commode. The bottle, near empty, did kind of sound like diarrhea. Me and Gertie, hiding inside the bathtub, suppressed giggles. \"You got some Pepto?\" Mike called. \"Hold on, let me check...\" \"Your boyfriend sounds young ,\" said the man outside the door. \"What can I say? I likes `em young. ..You know it's good you're spraying for cockroaches too, `cuz I saw a couple crawling around the set.\" \"Ma'am, we're spraying for bedbugs.\" \"Then how come you're not turning over the bed? I know how these things work! Are you going to do it right, or do I need to go complain at the front office?\" I heard the bed banging on its side. \"Ma'am, I'm going to need you to clear out of here for awhile. You and your boyfriend. \" She knocked on the door. \"Tom, you done in there? \" Mike continued making noise. \"I don't think so! Where's the pink stuff?\" \"Sorry, baby. Fresh out. Need to go to the store.\" To the man, he said, \"Can he just... stay in there awhile and hold his breath when he comes out? I don't think he's in a condition to move right now, unless you want to do his laundry... \" \"Ma'am, that's fine. We'll come back . We, uh, need to get some chemicals from the main warehouse anyway...You haven't seen a couple small kids around here lately, have you? A boy and a girl? Gray uniforms?\" \"You talking about prep school uniforms or what?\" \"They're kind of prison jumpsuits. They broke out of juvie. The boy's older, brown haired, got a little sister in pigtails. You'd know if you saw them. In fact, here's their picture.\" \"So they got pest control searching for missing children now? What kind of operation you running?\" \"Ma'am, we serve the community . Anyways, I hear they've been kidnapped by a stocky white guy and a black woman. They might have an older boy with them.\" \"Could you describe the black woman for me? `Cuz that could be anyone on the entire east side.\" \"I'm sorry. We have pictures, but they're back at the main office. The woman was a secretary for the Department of Defense. She may be dressed in uniform.\" \"A black woman ... in the DOD. Now there's something you don't see every day!\" \"I'm sorry ma'am. Not meaning to be insensitive or anything. If you see them or hear anything, could you give us a ring? We'd really appreciate it. There's a phone number on the back.\" \"I'll definitely keep an eye out.\" The men stomped out. I heard the hotel door clicking shut, then a long silence. \"I'm glad that's over,\" said Michael. \"'m out of dad's shampoo.\" \"Is it safe to come out now?\" Gertie asked. A moment later, it was like was having an epileptic fit. My eyes rolled backwards in my head as I convulsed in the tub. \"Brother?\" Gertie cried. Mike grabbed me. \"Elliott! Snap out of it!\" And then it was like we weren't in the hotel anymore. We were on ET's ship, all three of us standing in the lower level, gawking at what we saw. ET hadn't moved from the plant...couch... thing . He appeared to be resting, though, his debriefing ending some time ago. \"Is ET dead?\" Gertie asked. \"I don't think so,\" my older brother replied. \"I see his chest moving.\" The fronds of that tree thing were growing into his arms and upper body, but he smiled when he saw us. \"Mich-ael. Ger-tie. Ell-i-ott.\" \"We're safe, ET,\" I said. \"For the time being. Are you okay?\" ET nodded. \"Good.\" Gertie reached for him, but it only made the vision fade in places like a shimmering mist. \"Your power is fading,\" ET said. \"But will always be here...\" He pointed to his head. His finger glowed as it pointed in my direction. I saw a flash of something, an electronics diagram. For some reason, it made sense to me. I felt I could build it , whatever it was. \"Find...me.\" I heard hotel beds banging down, then a knock. \"Kids, you in there?...Food's getting cold!\" Our shared vision disappeared, and we were back in the bathroom. All three of our bodies glowed, but the light dimmed as we regained our bearings. Gertie and I had to wipe blood away from our noses. \"Yeah, dad!\" Michael called back. \"Just a minute!\" We came out to find taco meals and bags from the thrift store awaiting us on the beds. \"Hope this stuff fits,\" dad said. \"Kinda picked it out at random. Had to guess on the sizes.\" \"Are the exterminators gone?\" I asked. Ruby nodded. \"They sped off the moment they saw me come back with a pink bottle.\" Dad chuckled. \"You always did have a flair for the dramatic.\" \"Your son helped.\" \"You're out of shampoo,\" Michael said. We ate our dinner, silently watching Knight Rider for a few moments. \"Why aren't you with mommy?\" Gertie asked dad. The man sighed, sat next to my sister, rubbed her on the head. \"Your mom and I never got along because I'm a Catholic and your mom's a Jew. It was kind of like oil and water.\" \"Holy water,\" said Ruby. \"Yeah, anyways, that was only the tip of the iceberg. Admittedly I'm not a great Catholic, being that I'm living in sin and all, but that's beside the point. We didn't get along. That's all. And that bank book (whew!) never could catch all those random checks she kept writing until we got in the red...\" \"It wasn't because you didn't want to see us?\" \"You kidding? I've been missing you every... dang day!\" He gave his girlfriend a sideways glance. \"Hey, I'm going to talk with Rubes for a bit. Behave , okay?\" Gertie nodded. \"That's a good girl.\" Ruby and Dad stepped out. I spied on them from the window. \"All right,\" I heard Ruby saying. \"We got a free moment. It's quiet, we're alone, explain to me why we don't marry.\" Dad sighed. \"Look, uh, I got alimony and child support, which, honestly is going to pose an interesting-\" \"Don't care. Name another reason.\" \"Hey,\" he stammered. \"Say, for example, that you didn't-\" \"You think I'll divorce you and leave you with two debts? Is that it?\" \"Uh, in not so many words?\" \"Steve, baby. I love you.\" \"I know, but this ain't my first rodeo.\" \"Elliott,\" Gertie called from a spot in front of the bed. \"Sit on the floor with me. I want to try something.\" I sat Indian style in front of her. Gertie grabbed my hands. \"Close your eyes.\" I did. I saw a flash, then that same circuit board thing I saw before. \"Do you see it?\" The more I thought about it, the more the idea solidified in my head. \"Yeah. I think I know how to build it. \" I got up from the floor, grabbed a screwdriver I'd spotted while hiding under the bed, and, starting with the antenna screws, I dismantled the TV, piece by piece. I had an idea where all the components and circuits should go. It seemed easy as hooking up a VIC-20. \"Hey!\" Michael protested. \"You can't do that! What if someone-\" \"I know how to put it back together,\" I said, not believing the words coming from my own mouth. Michael, who had been with ET and everything, just stared at me, wide eyed. \"Okay, so what are you doing?\" \"Dunno. I guess we'll find out when I'm done.\" Dad had brought along a dufflebag full of interesting tools, I guess for assisting our rescue. Among the pliers, wrenches and associated hardware, I found a calculator and an analog multimeter. It seemed a good idea to take the things apart for use in this... thing I was putting together. The door swung open, and dad stepped in, hand in hand with Ruby. I spotted a ring. \"Kids, I have an announcement to make-\" He frowned when he saw the mess. \"Hey! We're going to have to pay for that!\" He scowled. \"Is that my calculator?\" I'd just created a rough version of a computer, complete with monitor, keyboard (the calculator), even something weird that went into the phone, maybe to call another computer, plus a parabolic reflector piece I'd built from a ceiling light cover and a flashlight. \"Son, I don't know what you're doing with all this stuff, but I hope you can put it all back or there's going to be a problem.\" I opened my mouth to say something, but then my improvised computer flickered into action, large block letters on the TV screen spelling out the word ELLIOTT. \"That's cute,\" said dad. \"Maybe we can find you a job. Now put that stuff back.\" That's when two more words appeared: PLEASE REPLY. \"It's ET!\" Gertie shouted. \"He's talking to us!\"[Chapter 8] A calculator doesn't give you much in the way of a keyboard. When you turn it upside down, you only get part of the alphabet. I would have used the telephone instead, but it was one of those rotary dial things. For this reason, the best response I could give to ET was 01134, or HELLO. Michael wanted to send 5318008, but I thought ET would be confused enough by my first message. No need to throw a dirty joke into the mix. ET took a long time to reply to us. I thought for a moment he didn't understand, but then this message appeared on the TV: 111, 1, 1011, 1011, 000=HELLO 8,5,12,12,15=HELLO \"Looks like Morse code and alphabet cipher,\" Dad said. \"Like on a decoder ring.\" \"Just pick one,\" Michael suggested. Alphabet cipher was shorter, so I used it to spell out \"ETISTHATREALLYYOU\". I don't know if it took a long time to get a signal out to space like that, or if he got confused by me not being able to put spaces between words, but the pause I got in response made me wonder if the message got sent at all, or if I should have picked something other than the equals button for the enter key. The TV screen filled up with incomprehensible symbols. I typed, \" . \" and got another long pause. Dad frowned at the phone cable. \"Are you making calls with this thing?\" I could tell he was worried about the room service charges. \"No, it's just a safer source of electricity. I think it does something to the signal.\" \"What do you mean, you think ? You built the damn thing! \" \"I...\" \"Honey,\" said Ruby. \"Have you heard of something called an Idiot Savant? \" He scowled at her. \"How dare you! My son is not an idiot!\" Ruby stifled a laugh. \"I didn't say he was, honey. I'm just saying that certain people can do brilliant things without understanding what they're doing. I saw a thing on TV one time where this guy memorized every single postal zip code in the country and could tell you what city it was just by saying the number.\" Dad smirked, cooling down a bit. \"Sounds like a Mentat.\" \"A what?\" He chuckled. \"It's a thing from Dune . It's a book. A bunch of guys specialize in being human calculators.\" \"Sounds like a boring book.\" \"No, no, there's giant sandworms in it. It's cool, kind of like The Hobbit.\" Ruby crossed her arms. \"This some kind of nerd thing?\" Dad gave her a look that said `Yeah? So What?' \"So,\" Michael muttered. \"You're not just calling some creep with a computer. This message is actually going into space?\" I nodded. \"I think there might be a way to call a radio telescope, but I'd actually have to find a scientist's phone number, and get him to agree with it...\" Dad thumbed through the white and yellow pages, set them down a moment later. \"I wouldn't know where to begin looking. I'm pretty sure even Carl Sagan's number is unlisted.\" \"If you're trying to type words,\" Ruby said. \"Why not just use the alphabet on the phone-\" Dad and I interrupted her with \"It's a rotary dial.\" \"ET still wouldn't know if I meant D, E, or F,\" I said. \"It's better this way.\" I wondered if ET had been using the saw blade and record player to rotary dial his friends in the ship, but having to convert my letters to numbers on a notepad every time I wanted to tell him something made this kind of conversation inconvenient. Gertie wrinkled her nose. \"Something smells like a hot hair drier.\" \"Hair driers are supposed to be hot,\" said Michael. She only frowned. The screen flared to life again. I saw, in inch-by-inch pieces, a sort of photograph slowly appear on the TV. When half of it had filled up the screen, Dad muttered something about a bad aspect ratio. He must have noticed my confused expression, for then he said, \" It's a photographic term. I've messed with a few computers before. You have to tell it what size to make the frame or it cuts off everything.\" I couldn't make heads or tails of what I was looking at. I just saw something brown in front of something green. Dad pointed. \"See, you can't even tell what that is. It might be your friend ET's butt for all we know.\" \" ,\" I typed. The picture disappeared. As a secondary, smaller picture began to take shape, the \"hair dryer smell\" Gertie described became a lot stronger. And then, without warning, the calculator exploded with a loud sizzling pop and a puff of smoke, the cords I'd plugged into the wall outlet and telephone jack bursting into flame. Dad swore. \"See? I knew this was a bad idea!\" He found a fire extinguisher and put out the fire, but we decided we'd outstayed our welcome. \"We're lucky this place didn't require a credit card,\" Dad said. \"As it stands, we're going to have to pretend everything is fine and leave early. Thank God the smoke detector didn't go off. I would have hated to explain this to management.\" \"You sound like you've had some practice with this kind of thing, \" Ruby muttered. \"Well, honey, nobody's perfect. \" He paused. \"Hope you're not having second thoughts about the marriage.\" She kissed him. \"You're not getting rid of me that easy.\" Dad kissed back, then frowned at the mess. \"Ellie, can you, I don't know, maybe put the TV back together, so that it at least looks like it isn't broken?\" The cords had, of course, been already been unplugged from the wall. Dad had taken care of that with some insulated electrician's supplies. It seemed Ruby had been at least partly right about me being a Savant, for I found it much more difficult to put the TV back together than take it apart. When I finally had the box screwed shut and looking halfway normal, my hands were bleeding from my fight with the sharp pointy things. Gertie tried to heal me with ET's power, but it didn't work. We ended up just using some bandages. We decided to cut the plug off the TV, just to make sure the next guest didn't wind up in the hospital. We slept a little, but left before dawn. Dad tried to look nonchalant and calm when he went into the office,, but when he came out again, he hurried into the Torino so fast that I wondered if he'd held the place up. \"No, no, I paid him,\" Dad insisted. \"I just don't want to hang around to find out what he says about the damages. In my college days, I started a fire with a hot plate...\" He shook his head, stepping on the gas. \"Where are we going?\" Gertie asked. Dad turned down a highway. \"San Francisco. Your brother can potentially make a lot of money if he hooks up with the right company.\" Ruby scowled. \"Steve, as much as I'd like to see him learning how to work a small business and everything, those agents are going to be searching the whole state for him. I'm not sure it's safe.\" Dad sighed. \"I guess you're right. If I involve him in a high profile business like that, he won't stay hidden for very long.\" \"High profile?\" She laughed. \" Please. Computers are nothing but glorified calculators. What kind of money are you really going to get from them?\" \"You'd be surprised, darling. Someday they're going to be big. \" \"I've heard a lot of those guys start in their garages anyway,\" Ruby muttered. \"Maybe you and Elliott can corner an untapped market somewhere else.\" \"You know, Rubes? I think you're on to something!... Of course there's the question of where we'd find the parts... \" He signaled for an exit ramp. \"Where are you going now?\" \"I've got relatives in the D.C. area. I thought maybe-\" \"D.C.? Are you out of your mind? You'll be within spitting distance of the Pentagon!\" Dad swore under his breath, pulled onto the shoulder. Someone honked at us. \"All right, Rubes. Where do you think we should go?\" \"I...I don't know, how about Kansas City?\" Dad rubbed his face in frustration. \"Why.\" \"For starters, there isn't a military base for miles, it's got a great jazz community, and you can't beat the barbecue...\" \"You got family there, don't you?\" \"Not close family...\" Dad groaned. \"Did I mention that the Royals are doing really good this year?\" \"I'll think about it.\" \"Ruby,\" I said. \"Didn't you tell me you had kids?\" She nodded. \"They're with their auntie. I don't think we're going to be able to see them anytime soon..\" Ruby sobbed a little as she thought about it. \"I'm not even going to be able to call them! They could be tapping their phones! Reading their mail!\" \"We'll work something out,\" Dad said, squeezing her hand. \"At least she won't accuse you of being a kidnapper.\" \"But how are we going to get them? Aren't those men going to be watching? If either one of us goes back there, we might end up in prison!\" \"We'll figure something out.\" He sighed. \"But first...\" Dad shifted into drive. We went on a long, meandering road trip, designed to lose anyone intending to track us. For example, we stopped at The Winchester Mystery House, a wax museum in Las Vegas, a ghost town in Grafton Uta, the hotel from The Shining , Mushroom Rock State Park. The Torino broke down five times along the way, but Mike and Dad knew how to do some temporary fixes to keep it going. We only had it in the shop once. The Torino ended up rolling into the obscure little town of Sidell, Missouri. With its incredibly steep hills, the place reminded me of San Francisco, but you had to cross narrow bridges to get into town, and its biggest businesses appeared to be Sidell Cellars Winery, the Tyson Chicken plant, and a toolbox company. \"What are we doing here?\" Ruby asked. \"Winery tours?\" \"This,\" Dad said as he pulled into one of the town's two filling stations. \"This is our new home.\" \"You're kidding.\" \"Look. I'm getting some phony ID's made, and the last thing I want is some big city police department picking apart our documents. If the local sheriff finds out they're fake, big deal. It'll be a lot easier to pull up stakes and move from here than Saint Louis or Kansas City.\" \"Yeah? Well by that same token, everybody knows everybody .\" \"Would you rather face a small army of enemies that you know, or an army of a thousand people you don't?\" All the black people seemed to be living across the railroad tracks, where the housing was cheaper. Ruby talked about buying a place there, but Dad found a secluded cabin in the hills that he liked better. The Torino gave us so much trouble that Dad towed it into the next county and sold it for scrap. He used the money to help pay for the cabin. Of course we had to get new names. Since they'd been taken from dead people, I didn't get a say in what I was to be called. The dead guy's name was Wolfgang Muller, so I was Wolfgang Muller. Michael got the name `Ludwig,' and Gertie became `Anna Maria.' It seemed the deceased were fans of Beethoven. Dad took a job at Tyson. Ruby tried to work at the winery, but she only got in at the tool box company. Even `Ludwig' started doing a part time gig at some old guy's carpentry shop. I tried to make a few computers for Dad to sell, but we both agreed that I needed to study up on electronics to get things past the prototype stage. Me and `Anna' got enrolled in a new school, some place called Charles M. Jones. They didn't ask for our social security numbers, and nobody had time to do fact checking on our legal documents, so they assigned us lockers and schedules just like anyone else. It was your ordinary rural middle school. None of the stuff had been updated since 1950, including the amount of African American students. Old raggedy books, mimeograph, some of the antique wall radiators didn't even work. The newest things we had were one of those tape recorder/slide projector things and a Betamax player. My hobbies didn't exactly make me a popular kid. In between tinkering with electronics and plants around the school, and me suddenly needing glasses after the first week, I got picked on a lot. One day, as I was putting my things in a locker, this guy named Jimmy Jackson shoved me into the door, spilling my botany books, a potted geranium and Green Lantern comics on the floor. \"Whoops!\" he laughed. \"Sorry, pansy boy! Guess I wasn't watching where I was going!\" As I bent over to scoop up the dirt from my plant, he kicked the pot out of my hands, smashed my comics with his sneakers until the pages came apart. He flipped through my electronics book. \"Why you reading this crap, Wolfie? Making some kind of potato clock?\" \"Some day it's going to get me into space!\" Jimmy laughed. \"How's that going to work? Gonna build a giant rocketship with a zucchini?\" His buddies chuckled. \"I don't know, but I'm going to figure it out somehow. And when I do, you're not coming along.\" \"Oooh!\" he mocked. \" Gonna fly away without me, huh? I guess them's the breaks!\" He threw a textbook down the hall. \"Go fetch, Wolfie!\" I had a feeling that ET wouldn't have wanted me to fight someone over something so trivial, but I'd had enough. When I saw him grabbing my botany book, I gave him a shove. He struck me in the face, knocking my glasses sideways. \"What do you have against me?\" I cried. \"Your dad's a farmer!\" \"You think I actually want to join the crummy FFA? You and my old man would get along great together!\" He slugged me in the stomach. I guess this kind of explained why he wore a leather jacket and studded wristbands instead of overalls or flannel. I thought Jimmy was going to pound me to a pulp, but then I heard a female voice shouting, \"Hey! Pick on someone your own size!\" With a laugh, the bully turned around. I saw a small figure do a couple karate moves, and Jimmy ended up groaning on the floor. I stared at my rescuer, then did a double take when I realized I recognized her. \"Jamie? How-?\" \"Elliott!\" she cried, kissing me full on the mouth.[Chapter 9] It defied explanation. The girl I smooched during science class, all the way over in California, somehow had made her way into this school out in the middle of nowhere. \"Jamie!\" I gasped when I finally pried her away from my mouth. \"How in the hell did you find me? What are you doing here? In my school? \" She grinned. \"A bee forages one to three miles away from a hive, and can find their home from eight miles a way. A dog can smell a mate from three miles away. And salmon, they travel hundreds of miles during their lifetime, to reach the ocean, their home stream, and feeding grounds. I just had this...feeling that you'd be here, so I knew I had to go.\" Jimmy groaned and got up. \"This isn't over.\" But he still took his buddies and left. I stared. \"Okay...so you had some kind of telepathic... thing . But my school? Do you live here? Where are your parents? \" I swallowed hard. \"Wait. Your folks work for the government, don't they? You're trying to take me back to that place! It's the only thing that makes sense!\" She looked genuinely puzzled. \"Why would the government be after you? You just...went crazy and freed a bunch of frogs from being dissected. It was brilliant, and then you kissed me. I've never been kissed like that before. Ever.\" She took a deep breath. \"I ran away from home.\" \"But your parents,\" I insisted. \" They'll be worried. \" \"It's okay. Daddy gets drunk and hits me. I'd rather be here.\" \"It's not going to work. What if they have a PTA meeting or something?\" \"I'll borrow your dad. \" \"I...don't know if he'll...\" Jamie gripped my hand, pulling me in close. \"Elliott, who's ET?\" I paled. \"What are you talking about?\" \"When I was searching for you, I...had this feeling . A word kept popping into my head. ET. ET. ET. Over and over again. I don't know what it meant, but I felt like it had some association with you.\" I narrowed my eyes. \"This is some kind of trick, isn't it? Who sent you?\" \"Nobody!\" she cried. \"Just my heart.\" I swallowed. \"He's...my best friend. He's...actually the reason why I did all that weird stuff in science class.\" \"He's a space man, isn't he? An alien, right?\" \"How did you know?\" Jamie shrugged. \"I... just got a flash of something just now. Maybe it's because we're holding hands.\" My cheeks flushed red. \"Don't tell anyone, okay?\" \"Is that why there were all those black vans? And that tent thing over your house?\" I nodded. \"Guess that explains why you moved and changed your name to Wolfgang.\" Her mouth hung open in surprise. \"Elliott! You're glowing! \" I wiggled free from her grip. \"Sorry.\" \"No! I love it! \" she grabbed my hand again. I pulled myself loose, glancing around to see if I'd been seen... doing that. \"Maybe some other time... Where are you staying?\" \"There's an abandoned factory down the street from your house. I've been sleeping in the manager's office.\" \"You can't be doing that! You'll get caught!\" \"Don't you get it, Elliott? I love you! I had to see you!\" \"But the police will come looking for you! When they find you, they'll find me!\" \"I don't know anyone by Elliott at this school,\" she said in a tone like she'd use with the cops. \"I've only been hanging out with this nerdy kid named Wolfgang. And he wears glasses.\" \"So, what, you're just going to squat in there like a hobo and go to school?\" \"It's a little dusty, and drafty, but I got some blankets...\" With an eager look, she blurted, \"Are you inviting me to stay with you?\" Now my face felt really hot. \"I'd...like to, but I don't know what dad and Ruby would say... I could bring you food, and more blankets... \" \"You got a kerosene heater?\" I frowned, unsure how I'd sneak one to her without being noticed. \"I'll.. .see what I can do.\" \"By the way, if you mention me to your dad, tell him my name's Lori.\" Our cabin was within walking distance of the school, so I always walked Gertie home at the end of the day. The cool fall wind blew open a discarded styrofoam dinner tray on our front lawn, reminding me of an undersea clam. Gertie ran into the house. Scooby Doo would be on soon. I found dad outside in the driveway, working on an ugly old Ford F-100. He rolled out from under the engine on a mechanic's creeper. \"Hey kid! How was school?\" \"Great,\" I said. \"I... just met a nice girl today.\" Dad chuckled. \"That's good. I was starting to worry about you. And Gertie. I know the move and everything wasn't easy on you...\" I reddened. \"Where's Ruby?\" \"She took a Greyhound back to California, you know, for the kids. \" He sat up, sighing as he stared at the ground. \"Honestly, not the greatest idea. I offered to go in her place, but she was worried about you guys not having a dad... Figure out the computer thing yet?\" I frowned. \"Maybe...Dad, would it be okay if I let someone borrow the space heater?\" Dad narrowed his eyes. \"Who's asking for it?\" I shrugged. \"A friend from school. \" To say he looked skeptical would be an understatement. \"Son, we're not exactly made of money, and this isn't a charity.\" I fumbled for a good cover story. \"Look, dad. The, uh, weather's getting colder, and her furnace just went out. \" A wry smirk crept up the corner of his mouth. \"Did you just say her? \" I reddened a little. \"Yeah?\" \"This wouldn't be that new lady friend you just described, now, would it?\" \"Um,\" I stammered. \"Maybe?\" \"That's how it always starts.\" He chuckled and put a hand on my shoulder. \"Son, let me as you something. Do you think she's really into you, or do you, I don't know, kinda have a gut feeling that she's using you?\" \"I think she's definitely into me.\" My face got a little redder. \"I mean, she kissed me on the mouth. \" Dad's eyes got real big when he heard that! \"Before or after she asked you for the heater?\" \"Before.\" I cleared my throat. \"Actually, she wasn't even the one asking at first. I mean, I offered to give her a few blankets... \" He patted my back. \"You're a good kid.\" He paused. \"Tell your girlfriend that if our furnace goes out, or we have a storm, there's going to be a problem. ..does this girl have a name?\" \"Lori.\" \"Lori! Is she nice?\" I opened my mouth to speak, but he just said, \"Guess she must be, to give you a sloppy French on the lips, huh?\" He gave me a kidding elbow. I marched into the house. Dad said our cabin looked like something from a horror movie, something that appealed to his odd sense of humor. Ruby said it just looked like something from an old western. The place was a little drafty, but we had a furnace and a fireplace, so it wasn't too terrible. I'd say the decor was the worst part, a tacky clashing of western motif and seventies art deco. The curtains were a gaudy striped green-brown pattern, our sofas distressed curbature. Dad had let me set up a science lab in the basement. Every weekend we'd go to the junkyard and the town dump, scavenging for discarded electronics, TV's, toys, electric typewriters, car parts, radios, sometimes a pinball machine, cassette and eight track decks, a broken arcade game...I made a few interesting computer-like things with them, but it wasn't anything I could peddle to a corporation, especially since I kept experimenting with plant power. Dad kept making jokes about potato clocks. We tried selling stuff to the bank, but they already had IBM business computers, and they said my computer looked to small to store anything on. Since dad attempted the sale while I was at school, he couldn't find the words to properly explain the miniaturization of electronics. During commercial breaks, and boring all-day news interruptions on TV, Gertie busied herself with the many plants I had potted around the room, talking to them as she watered and pruned and packed in soil. I had only taught her half of what I learned from all those books. Even dad thought her skill went beyond mom's repertoire. It seemed ET had given my sister a green thumb too. We did have a pretty good mini-greenhouse started, complete with plant lights. Dad made jokes about us being `pod people', especially since we ate salads, but we never had to buy produce. The heater stood in the corner. A medium sized one that I could, with some difficulty, lift up the stairs, provided I take the triangular fuel tank out first. Dad said you could cook TV dinners on top of the thing, what, with the heat coming off of it. The thought of giving Jamie an improvised stove in addition to heat made me smile. I had only loaded it on a dolly and gotten it to the stairs when the basement window suddenly popped open, a female figure nosily scattering equipment and sketches all over the place as she landed on my work table. Circuit boards and half finished projects broke on the concrete. \"Jamie?\" I gasped. She hopped to the floor, holding a finger to her lips. \"What are you doing here?\" I hissed. \"Coming to see you. What does it look like?\" I picked up my papers and other stuff, straightening up. \"Sorry about the mess...Is that the heater?\" I nodded. Jamie put her hands on her hips. \"Maybe if we sneak it around back, when it's dark or something...\" Gertie gawked at my girlfriend. \"Hey! You're Elliott's classmate!\" Jamie shushed her, waving her hands, trying to make my sister decrease her volume. \"I grew up here, all right?\" My sister wrinkled her nose, shaking her head. \"No you didn't! You were in California! You shouldn't lie! It'll make your nose get big!\" \"Please don't tell dad!\" I hissed. \"He'll think she's a spy or something!\" Gertie looked Jamie in the eyes. \" Are you a spy?\" \"No.\" \"Then what are you doing here?\" she paused. \"And don't lie. Your eyes do funny things when you're about to tell a story. Like right now.\" Jamie sighed. \"If you tell your dad, I'm going to kill you.\" \"I won't tell a soul. Cross my heart, hope to die.\" \"You're... Jewish.\" My sister didn't get it. \"What does that have to do with anything? And how did you know that, anyway?\" I was wondering that, too, but I didn't want to add to the noise level by talking. \"Never mind. Look. I ran away from home, okay? Don't tell.\" \"Is that why you need a space heater?\" Jamie swallowed, nodding a little. \"Don't tell.\" \"Where are you sleeping? Under a bridge?\" \"It's a little better than that.\" Gertie sniffed her. \"You don't smell like a hobo.\" My girlfriend rolled her eyes. \" Gee, thanks. \" \"I'm going to play with my dolls,\" Gertie said, marching upstairs. Jamie glanced at me with discomfort. \"She crossed her heart,\" I said. My girlfriend stared at my stuff. \"What's all this?\" \"I don't know. After I met ET, I started... thinking differently. Getting ideas. \" Ever since I'd had those visions of ET with Gertie, I'd been drawing pictures of... space vehicles, astronauts, you know, what a ship might look like if I were to build it, and how it might work on different terrain...and then a few of astronauts encountering ET and Yoda and the Green Guardians. I'd tacked and stapled and taped them up all over the place. Jamie pulled one off the wall. \"I hope you're not trying to build this. Rocket ships aren't supposed to be this round.\" All of my ship designs were somewhat round. \" ET made it work. There's got to be a way.\" \"Airplanes were inspired by birds, but they never worked until we made them more airplane shaped.\" She furrowed her brow. \"Are you glowing again?\" I stared at my chest. I really didn't think the glowing could be seen. \"How are you doing that?\" \"I don't know. It just happens.\" \"Like when you're around me?\" \"Maybe?\" She giggled. \"That's kinda cute.\" I showed her a couple computers I'd made. \"You're...really smart.\" I blushed. \"Thanks.\" Jamie handed me an oddly familiar looking walkie-talkie. \"I kinda took this from your house. Thought I'd give it back.\" I stared. \"You went in my house? Why?\" She leaned in close to me. \"Why did you kiss me?\" My blush deepened. \"Uh...\" \"I hope you're not going to say it's all because of your alien friend.\" \"Well,\" I stammered. \" I guess if you-\" \"This whole time, I've been trying to figure you out. You go from pulling my hair and acting like I was icky to freeing frogs and kissing me. So I did some investigating. I've seen your mom at PTA meetings before, so I kinda got into the principal's file cabinet and looked you up...your mom's really friendly.\" I swallowed. \"How is she?\" Jamie gave me an apologetic look. \"She misses you, but she understands why you ran off. Those men with the black vans scare her too.\" \"Are people still watching the house?\" \"Kinda. Your mom says it's not as bad as it used to be.\" \"Wait. If you went there, wouldn't they be following after you too?\" Jamie rolled her eyes. \"Why? I'm just a dumb kid . I didn't even touch your space man. Unlike you, curling up next to him in your longjohns...\" \"Wait. She told you about that? \" \"So maybe I exaggerated a little about my telepathic abilities. I still wouldn't have gotten here without your alien friend.\" \"Did you...find anything else in my room?\" \"Your mom said those men pretty much ransacked you guys's rooms, so there was mostly a bunch of toys, and clothes and mementos , you know, because they didn't have any use for them and gave them back. Of course, they didn't check the garage very well. \" She found a funny notebook in a Monopoly box buried under your dad's clothes. There's also some weird stuff scribbled all over one of your brother's Dungeons and Dragons manual.\" I stared. \"What did you do with them?\" \"They're in a backpack at my place. Along with one of Gertie's dolls and a bear.\" \"She was actually okay with you taking the stuff?\" Jamie looked sheepish. \"I kinda told her I knew where you were...and was helping you hide.\" \"So where did you tell her I was?\" \"In the attic of my old house. It's good I did, too, because a day later, your guys were swarming around the place, driving the new owners crazy.\" \"What about the backpack? Wouldn't they think it weird to see you walking out with one full of stuff?\" \"My pink backpack? I got weirder looks from my teachers. I told them I left all my books at my boyfriend's house. \" \"Elliott?\" Dad called from the top of the stairs. \"Who are you talking to down there?\" \"Shit!\" Jamie cried, ducking under a work table. \"... Myself! \" I said. 'I'm... thinking out loud.\" As he marched down the stairs, Jamie pulled a trash can and a chair around herself for concealment. Dad frowned at the heater. \"Need help with that?\" I slowly nodded. Jamie sneezed. Dad glanced up, trying to see what had caused the noise. \"You hear something?\" I tried to look puzzled. \"I think it's just a squirrel.\" He squinted. \"You left the window open.\" \"It was hot.\" He still looked suspicious. \"That squirrel sounded pretty close. You might want to close it a little better or we'll have to buy glue traps.\" I paled when he picked up the walkie talkie. \"Where'd you get this?\" \"Jamie,\" I blurted. \"I mean, Lori . She, uh, thought I'd like them.\" Dad turned the toy over. \"This looks like the one I got you for Hannuk-Christmas. \" That was dad's little joke. We celebrated Hannukah, but his best gifts came around the 25th...And the ones for the other days tended to have a suspiciously Christian flavor to them. Green and red gifts or packaging. `Hannukah deer.' He made figgy pudding one year. One time, he and mom even had an argument about ham. \"It's a common brand,\" I said. His thumb rubbed the scratches along the plastic, his face still reflecting suspicion. Dad sighed, set the radio down so he could grab the heater. \"Let's get this thing upstairs, shall we?\" He motioned for me to get the reservoir. Dad set the heater by his truck, groaned in frustration. \"Damn, forgot about the alternator. Your brother's supposed to be bringing it by when he gets off work.\" \"That's okay,\" I said. \"I'll use my Radio Flyer.\" The moment I came out of the house with the wagon, Jamie came walking up the front yard like she'd just gotten there. She waved to me and dad. \"Hey Wolfgang...Hi, Mr. Mueller. \" Dad grinned. \"So. You're the famous Lori I keep hearing about. \" Jamie looked bashful. \"I hope you've heard good things.\" He nodded. \"Got furnace trouble, huh? How long you think it'll take before you get it fixed?\" \"I don't know. Might be awhile . They're saying we might need to get the whole thing replaced. We're trying to save up.\" \"I'd say so. Those things can get pretty pricey.\" He kept scrunching up his face, staring at her. \"Say, haven't I seen you around somewhere before? \" \"I go to his school. You probably saw me around there.\" Dad rubbed his face, looking like he'd smelled a fart. \"I don't know. It seems like I've seen you somewhere else... \" It was hard to guess how much dad remembered about the girl. I mean, after the divorce... \"I hang around stores a lot.\" \"Maybe it was the hardware store,\" I suggested. Dad gave another piercing look, then muttered, \"We do go there a lot...\" Jamie sneezed again. \"Wow. Sounds like you're getting a cold. Maybe you do need that heater.\" He helped me load the wagon. I offered the handle to Jamie, but she said, \"Walk with me. I want you to...meet my parents.\" Dad rolled his eyes. \"Think you'll be back for dinner?\" I fumbled for words, but Jamie gave him a nod. \"What are you having?\" \"Probably TV dinners, if that's okay.\" She looked excited. \"Sounds wonderful!\" \"Poor girl,\" Dad muttered to me. \"When did she last eat?\" When I shrugged, dad gave me a wink and rubbed my shoulder, as if to say, `You're a chip off the old block'. The old factory building stood a block down from my cabin, at the bottom of a steep hill. A yellow thing with dirty windows and big garage doors that occupied most of the block. Debris lay scattered on its grounds. \"I thought you wanted to until it gets dark,\" I muttered as we drew closer to it. She sighed. \"Yeah, but your dad. ..And we can't exactly leave it outside. Someone might steal it.\" We didn't so much roll the wagon down the street as slow its descent past the building. A couple kids in one of the nearby houses stared at us, so we went around the corner. The sign for the business had been removed from above the door, leaving me guessing what sort of factory the place had been. We waited for the street to be clear of observant drivers (the area was secluded enough - we didn't have to wait long) but I noticed a fat old lady staring at us as we snuck the Flyer around the side of the building. We ended up pretend carrying it to the back yard of a nearby house. A chihuahua barked at us from the window above us. The woman scowled and swept her front porch. We watched the woman from behind a shrub, breathing a sigh of relief when she at last went back inside her house. The dog kept barking. \"C'mon,\" Jamie whispered. \"Let's go.\" My friend had the back door of the place propped open with a rock. She held it open as I wheeled the Flyer inside. The place appeared to have been a small scale printing factory, perhaps for one of the unions. Dust gathered on the big roller machines, the forklift, the typesetting equipment. Jamie switched on a flashlight, leading me up a metal staircase to a room with a desk and rusty old file cabinets. I saw a sleeping bag, a wind-up alarm clock, canned food, and some clothing on the floor. \"You think we can get it up here?\" \"I think I saw a ramp...how do you bathe? Or wash your clothes?\" \"Next door. The guy works nights at the gas station. I sneak in when he's leaving for work, or at work. \" \"Guess that explains the clock.\" I helped her with the heater. Jamie unzipped her pink bag, dug out my spiral notebook and a dungeon master campaign manual belonging to Billy, Michael's friend. The latter item had a bunch of blank pages, so you could fill in your own stuff for the game, but someone had filled it up for me. I stared at the writing. \"Make any sense to you?\" \"No...\" I muttered, but then something clicked in my head, like I had just activated the part of my brain that spoke Spanish, and I had to think in Spanish terms in order to understand everything. That wasn't the language I was reading, of course. \"Wait. I think...this has something to do with energy.\" Jamie had a puzzled dog look on her face. \"What?\" \"Energy,\" I repeated. \"It tells me how to make a liquid that provides electricity like a car battery, except better.\" Her ears actually seemed to go up like a confused dog. \"The only word I understood out of all that noise was `car battery.'\" \"C'mon,\" I groaned. \"Don't tell me you don't know what electricity is!\" \"Finally you're speaking English! What was that stuff before? Swahili? \" I paled. \"I literally wasn't speaking English?\" She shook her head. \" Are you really all right?\" I frowned, remembering how strangely my lips had been moving a minute ago. \"Yeah. I...just...think I know how to read this stuff now.\" \" Maybe your spaceman messed you up more than you know.\" I just sighed, glancing at the heater. \"Let me know if you run out of fuel.\" She slung her bag over her shoulder. \"Let's go.\" \"Wait,\" I said. \"Where's the dolls and the bear you were talking about?\" Jamie patted the bag. \"Why?\" \"Maybe we should leave that stuff here for the time being. Dad already acted kind of sketchy when he saw my walkie talkies.\" She frowned. \"Guess you got a point.\" He still got sketchy. \"What's that you got there?\" Dad asked when I stepped through the door to our cabin. He'd spotted the book. \"Uh...She was just telling me how she liked D&D.; I thought we might play sometime.\" He looked Jamie in the eyes. \"Your folks okay with you being here?\" \"Yeah. They always say I should get out more often.\" The dinner table stood right next to the living room couch, and a log wall. A stuffed deer head looked impassively down on us with its glass eyes as we ate. My sliced turkey TV dinner was like lunchmeat with soggy globs of croutons floating in grease. I took it because I wanted our guest to have the first pick. I resolved to have real food in my spaceship, if I ever got it off the ground. \"So,\" Dad said to my girlfriend. \" Lori. Tell me about yourself.\" \"Not much to say, really. I've lived here...awhile. Dad works at the car dealership. Mom runs the bar.\" Dad propped his elbow on the table, fingering his chin. he looked like he was going to say something, but Jamie blurted, \"I'm in El, Wolfgang's biology class. And home room.\" I eyed Gertie nervously, but she kept her mouth busy with food. Dad glanced at her. \"You're unusually quiet tonight, tyke. Anything on your mind?\" \"Is it a sin to lie if it helps people?\" He gave me and Jamie glances like he suspected something amiss, but then he rubbed her head. \"Still worried about that , are you?\" Dad shot Jamie an apologetic glance. \" We're under the witness protection program. I saw a guy get killed. Bad shit, excuse my language. Can't tell our real identities or the mob'll come after us.\" I and Jamie exchanged uncomfortable glances. \"What did he tell you? Something outlandish about a UFO? \" Jamie suppressed a giggle. \"Something like that.\" She elbowed me. Gertie looked troubled, but just stuffed a forkful of peas into her mouth. Michael opened the front door. \"Dad, I got the alternator.\" He frowned when he noticed our guest. \"Hey, isn't that-\" When dad looked his way, I mouthed the word no, shaking my head. \"Did I mention my uncle works at the hardware store?\" Jamie exclaimed. Gertie gave my brother a thumbs up when dad wasn't looking. Michael picked up the D&D; manual. \"Hey, this looks like Billy's-!\" I glanced at him nervously, again shaking my head. My brother thumbed through it a moment, frowned, set it down. \"Popular book.\" Jamie grabbed a couple rolls, looked at the clock. \"I should get home. My parents... \" Dad nodded. \"Nice to meet you. Any friend of El, little Wolfgang , is a friend of mine.\" \"Want me to walk you home?\" I offered. \"Thanks. I'm okay. See you at school tomorrow. Thank you for the heater, Mr. Mueller. And dinner.\" Greg stared. \"You gave her a heater?\" \"Her furnace broke,\" Dad said. \"She's just borrowing it for a few days.\" I followed Jamie out to the porch. She shut the door, once again kissing me on the mouth. \"You're glowing again,\" she said when she pulled away. I gawked at her. \"You are too.\" I wasn't joking, either. I could see a red glow spreading beneath her shirt, like someone had flicked on a light bulb in her rib cage. Her mouth hung upon in shock. I saw the light fading. \"It's not like a disease or anything, is it?\" \"I don't know. So far it seems to be a nice disease. I mean, I feel pretty good... ' She grinned. \"So do I.\" As she was leaving, she held out one of my walkies, wordlessly turning the volume knob to the `ON' position before dropping it in her backpack. The moment I stepped into the house, I found Michael and dad standing in front of them, expectant looks on their faces. \"Okay,\" Dad said. \"What did you tell her?\" I swallowed. At present, being punished for blabbing about ET seemed to be a better alternative to pulling up stakes on account of a little runaway girl. \"I... told her everything. But she's not going to tell anyone. We pinky swore.\" \"You... pinky swore, \" Dad groaned. \"Great. Who else did you tell? \" I flushed hot with shame, both at lying, and the crime itself. \"Nobody. Just her.\" He sighed, glancing at Michael for a second opinion. \"She's just a little kid. What harm can she really do?\" \"Michael, little kids have carried live grenades up to American GI's in Vietnam. How do we know she's not somebody's little spy? They are targeting a kid... \" \"So, what, we're just going to move out of town on account of one kid? Elliott's been a loner ever since we moved into this dump. It wouldn't hurt for him to have a few friends, especially ones he can trust. I'm just saying... \" \"Lord, give me strength...\" Dad took a deep breath, rubbed his face. \"Okay. We'll stick it out for the time being. But if I catch someone else, anyone else, sticking their nose in where it doesn't belong, we're getting out of Dodge, capische?\" I nodded. \"Yes sir.\" I went to my bedroom, switched on the walkie. I only heard static (I figured it was out of range anyway), but I decided I needed something soothing to calm my guilt ridden mind into sleep. I set it on the dresser and shut off the light. The first thing I dreamed about was dad finding out my secret. He yelled at me, took Jamie to the police station to notify the parents, then we started packing again. I woke, watched The War of the Worlds on my little black and white TV, you know, the late night monster show. I kept the lights off, to avoid disturbing the others. It was storming outside, raining to beat the band. I worried about Jamie in that big cold drafty building, hoped the heater would be enough. \"Elliott, are you awake?\" I heard a voice say on the walkie. I clicked a button. \"Yeah. You can't sleep either?\" \"No. Whatcha doing?\" \"Oh, just watching TV.\" \"Can you hold the thing up to the TV so I can listen?\" \"If I do that, I won't be able to talk.\" \"That's okay. It's probably better that way anyway.\" \"You warm?\" \"Yeah.\" \"How's the heater?\" \"It's great. Glad I'm not outside. Thanks again.\" I used a few rubber bands to hold the button down, pressing the walkie to the TV's speaker. I started nodding off about halfway in, so I spoke up again. \"I'm going to shut this off, all right?\" \"Sure. Good night Elliott, I mean, Wolfie. I love you.\" I stared at my radio receiver. Did she really just say that to me? \"Elliott?\" I gulped. Apparently she wanted me to say something back. \"I...I love you too.\" \"Is your chest glowing? Mine's shining pretty bright. It makes the place look kind of spooky.\" I was lighting up the room too. \"Yeah.\" \"Oooh! The Martians are coming! Look at my hand!\" I chuckled. \"It's not going to keep glowing while I'm at school, is it?\" \"I don't know. I hope not. Those guys might come after you. \" \"Maybe I could staple a magazine or something to my shirt.\" \"You'll look weird.\" \"Can't look any weirder than a glowing chest.\" I sighed. \"Guess you're right. Anyways, pleasant dreams.\" I don't know if what I dreamed was actually pleasant, but it was highly unusual and life changing. I flew over an immense circuit board, zooming in between its chips and capacitors like an X-Wing on the Death Star. I could see the board from every angle, turn it three hundred sixty degrees like a model. I saw the pattern, knew how to put it together. Mostly. My eyes snapped open, and the glowing of my chest intensified to the brilliance of a desk lamp. Drenched in sweat, I sat up, fumbling for a notebook. I'd filled every page of the front half with sketches before the strange muse left me, and I sat staring at my notes. A moment later, my bedroom window slid open with a loud hiss, and Jamie came climbing in, shrugging a damp rain poncho onto the floor. She stared at my notebook. \"You dreamed about it too?\"[Chapter 10] I gawked at Jamie. She was glowing, and so was I. The thing I dreamed about seemed very important, and somehow connected to ET on a deep, complicated level. If she knew something , if ET chose her to come along whenever we found a way to meet him, it changed everything. \"You...\" I stammered. \"What did you dream about?\" She sat down on my bed, flipping through my notebook. \" A circuit thingy. Like someone took that cover thing off a computer. I was flying through it, and somehow I could tell what things were. Don't ask me how, but...\" She dug a stack of paper out of her shirt, diagrams, symbols and equations drawn in pencil and ink, half smudged by rain. \"Just like any dream, it's perfectly clear and you know exactly what it all is right when you wake up and scribble everything down.\" She rubbed her forehead. \"Of course, right now it's like I just had a cup of coffee or something. It's... kinda confusing. \" \"I didn't know you drank coffee,\" I muttered. \"I don't. Usually. Sometimes I have some with lots of cream and sugar. Anyways, that's beside the point. Do you know what all this is?\" I shrugged, staring at the papers. We weren't glowing so much now, so I resorted to reading with a flashlight. These were plans for something. Plans for what, exactly, I couldn't tell, but if ET really wanted us to come to him, I figured it was going to be a lot more complicated than sprinkling a bunch of pixie dust and thinking happy thoughts. A hundred plus pages of notebook paper complicated. After all, ET did say our powers were fading. \"What do you think all this is? Blueprints for some kind of spaceship?\" I shook my head. \"I'm not sure. It could be anything. A landing gear . A formula for rocket fuel ...So how did that heater work for you?\" \"It's great. Really warm...Could you get me a towel? I'm soaking wet.\" I brought her one from the hall closet. She was dripping on the papers. \"Did you have matches or a birthday candle or something to light the wick? I know it's kind of tricky if you never-\" Jamie reddened. \"So maybe I just sneaked into your basement and kinda slept there.\" She sneezed. \" By the way, y ou guys should dust more often. \" I smiled as I watched her dry her hair into a messy frizz. \"Guess that explains the great radio reception.\" \"It was great, wasn't it?\" I gave her a sheepish grin, blushing a little. \"So.\" She turned a diagram over. \" Nothing at all springs to mind when you're looking at this?\" I returned my attention to the paper. It didn't seem to make sense. \"I think it's something to do with energy, but something's missing.\" Jamie tore a page out of my notebook, holding it up to one of her diagrams. \"Maybe it's like a puzzle.\" \"You...might be right. I guess a lot of computer programs have modules and things that have to fit together just right or they don't work...\" \"Can we go downstairs and try typing some of this in?\" \"No way! It'll make too much noise! You're not even supposed to be here! \" I turned my notepad over, showing her the mess of writing on the reverse side. \"By the way, some of these `puzzle pieces' are double sided.\" \"Oh. Guess we'll have to copy that onto another sheet and see if it fits together.\" We transferred the information onto a fresh page. \"Say, hypothetically, that we somehow get this jumbled mess to make sense. Then what? What are you intending to do with it?\" \"ET said to come see him. I don't think we're going to get to where he is, until we build this... whatever it is. \" \"You're trying to make that Christmas tree ornament thing from your drawings, aren't you?\" I didn't deny it. \"Well...\" She snickered. \"I hope it works!\" \"Me too.\" After working on the papers for several minutes, Jamie sighed in frustration. \"Couldn't you just, I don't know, take the Challenger? \" I rolled my eyes. \"Even if the government wasn't out to get me, you have to be an adult , and get in the air force . And take a physical exam , you know, to prove that you're a perfect model of fitness. \" \"Where's the fun in that?\" \"I know, right?\" \"Elliott!\" I heard dad calling from outside the door. \"Whatcha doing in there?\" \"Shit!\" Jamie gasped, ducking under the bed. \"Nothing!\" I cried. \"Uh, just... reading! \" \"You do know it's a school night, don't you?\" \"Yeah... Couldn't sleep. \" \"It'd help to turn the lights off.\" Jamie sneezed. \"What was that?\" \"Nothing,\" I covered. \"I...I think I'm coming down with a cold.\" \"Maybe if you didn't play with the windows so much you wouldn't have a cold. Go to bed!\" My girlfriend chuckled. I had to at least humor dad, so I stowed our materials and occupied the bed. Obviously, there'd be a problem if dad found me sharing a bed with Lori, or even saw her in my room. I compensated by slipping her one of my sleeping bags from the closet and having her sleep under the bed. Not very comfortable or hospitable, I know, but she wasn't supposed to be there. My plan worked until she had to go to the bathroom. \"Can't you, um, hold it? \" I stammered. \"Or get a soda bottle or something?\" \"Elliott...\" She fell silent for a moment. \"No. I really can't. I'm just going to dream about looking for toilets. And I'm not comfortable with doing that other thing while you're in the room.\" I rubbed my face in frustration. \"It'd almost be safer if you went outside. I mean, what if dad sees you?\" \"It's raining. I'm not going to squat out in the yard in the rain. I already risked a cold sneaking into your window.\" \"You slept in an abandoned factory,\" I pointed out. She sighed. \"All right, all right! \" \"Wait. Maybe if we time this just right...\" It wasn't the most elegant plan, but we came to the idea of having Jamie cloak herself in a blanket and carry my walkie-talkie to throw my voice, if needed. I checked the hallway first, to make sure the coast was clear, then sent her tiptoeing down the way. I gasped when I saw the bathroom door swing open. Gertie stepped out, scrunching her face when she noticed the figure huddled in blankets. She rubbed her eyes, then widened them when her sleepy brain recognized who it was. Jamie whispered something to her. Gertie covered her mouth, suppressing a giggle. My sister glanced at me, giving me this look like I were crazy. I only shrugged. She disappeared into her room. \"That was close!\" Jamie radioed to me. \"Yeah,\" I muttered back. \"Hurry up!\" My girlfriend rushed into the bathroom. I waited impatiently for her to finish her business and get out of there. The door came back open, and Jamie came creeping up the hallway. Dad's door suddenly creaked open. \"Elliott?\" Jamie tried her hardest to keep her face shrouded in cotton fabric, and facing far away from dad. I radioed, \"I had to go, okay?\" \"What's with all the blankets?\" \"It's drafty in here.\" \"Have you been painting your toenails?\" \"Actually, Lori...\" Before I could do anything about it, dad's arm shot out, grabbing my girlfriend. The blanket fell to the floor, leaving my girlfriend stupidly holding the walkie-talkie. Dad chortled through his nose. \"I knew those feet looked too pretty to be Elliott, Wolfgang's .\" \"It's not what it looks like, Mr. Mueller!\" she said. Dad glanced over at my blushing face. \"It never is.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Let me guess... homework? \" \"How did you know?\" A wry smirk crept up his mouth. \"Damn that kid moves fast! Chip off the old block!\" He grabbed the radio, pushing the button. \"Wolfgang, get your butt over here.\" I paled, doing what he said. Dad put a hand on my shoulder. \"El, Wolfgang, I know you're getting older, and your developing hormones and everything...\" \"We didn't do anything,\" Jamie blurted. \"It was just a sleepover.\" Dad chortled, shook his head. \" Right. An unauthorized sleepover. On a school night. One you don't want to tell the old man about! Believe you me, I've had a few of those quote-unquote `sleepovers.' Where do you think Michael came from? \" \"Can I have breakfast?\" Jamie blurted. \"It's four in the morning.\" Then, noticing Gertie standing in the doorway, Dad rubbed his face. \"What do you want to eat.\" It was a very awkward meal. For a long time, we just silently stared at each other and ate our oatmeal and pancakes. \"Why were you sleeping under the bed?\" Gertie asked my girlfriend. Dad furrowed his brow. \" Who was under the bed?\" \"Jamie. I mean, Lori . She had a sleeping bag and everything. It didn't look very comfortable.\" Dad burst out laughing. \"Did he coach you to say that?\" Gertie shook her head. \"It's a sin to lie.\" I frowned at her. \"I had the door shut.\" \"You were sleeping. And there's a crack under the door.\" Dad put his chin in his hand and just stared at my sister. Then he stared at me. \"Son, what's really going on? \" I opened my mouth to say something, but Jamie answered first. \"I'm homeless.\" Dad took a deep breath, let it out. \"Explains a few things, I guess. Like how you eat like you've starved for two weeks... So what did you do with the heater?\" \"It's safe. I sleep in an abandoned building.\" It seemed the smells of food had awakened my brother. He stood beside the table, just staring. \"What's she doing here?\" Dad frowned. \"It seems our cabin has become a hotel. \" Another tense silence. At last Dad said, \"Tell you what, Lori. I'll let you stay in Gertie's room. I mean, Anna Maria 's...\" Gertie looked excited to have a roommate. I noticed her grinning. \"That stuff you told me about your parents, that was crap, wasn't it? I've been to that bar... \" Jamie gave him a bashful nod. He twisted his lip. \"You have us at a disadvantage , miss. We're not exactly in a position where we can afford to talk to the authorities...\" \"I thought you were under witness protection.\" Dad gave her a sheepish grin. \"Yeah? Well the people that are after us... they go way up . Ever seen Serpico? \" \"No. What's that about?\" He shook his head. \"Corrupt cops. They flush a guy's head in the toilet. Never mind. The point is, we can't trust the police, so I guess you've got a place to stay until we can figure out what to do with you.\" Dad started working on a newspaper crossword. \"Hear anything about Ruby?\" I asked. Dad sighed. \"Not since the last one hundred times you asked.\" \"Who's Ruby?\" Jamie said. \"My fiancee . She just had to go back and get her kids.\" \"What do you think happened?\" \"She probably got caught, got taken to a military base or a prison. As we speak, they're probably pumping her for information or something.\" \"And you're not going to rescue her?\" Dad rolled his eyes. \"Look. We were lucky to rescue... Wolfgang from the cops the first time. His brother got shot in the process. If I try to rescue Ruby, you kids will either get captured, or you won't have food , or a roof over your head . I had to make a judgment call. I'm sure Ruby understands.\" Gertie sniffed, wrinkled her nose. \"Lori, you need a bath.\" \"From the mouth of babes,\" Dad joked. \"You know where the shower is. Guess you'll have to wear the same clothes until we can get you to the thrift shop.\" While she got cleaned up, Dad took me aside, giving me a talk on the birds and the bees that left my ears burning. The moment Jamie came back from the shower, Gertie asked if she could braid her hair. \"Maybe later,\" she said. We commenced our short walk to school. \"So,\" Michael said to my girlfriend. \"Now that you're going to be living under our roof, let's hear some answers . I know you've been lying, and you're obviously hiding something from dad...\" She reddened. \" I followed you all the way from California, okay? I may have run away from home.\" My brother grabbed her by the shoulders, glaring at her. \"What have you done! They'll be worried sick! The cops will be on us for sure!\" \"I changed my name.\" \"Yeah? But they have pictures of you. They could send them to the police here!\" \"They probably have pictures of you and Elliott too.\" \"She's been hanging out with me,\" I added. \"They'll probably want to take her to some military base too.\" Michael scowled. \"She could be spying. \" \"She doesn't seem like a spy.\" \"That only means she might be a good one.\" \"I'm not a spy,\" Jamie said. \"He's right. If I go back to my folks now, I'll be a hostage, at the very least.\" \"If those black vans start showing up here, I'll kill you.\" Jamie swallowed, giving him a grave nod. \"ET sent her here,\" Gertie said. \"She told me.\" \"Welcome to the family,\" Michael groaned. We dropped Gertie off at the grade school, went next door to the upper grade building. \"So when do you think we can give Gertie her stuff back?\" Jamie asked me. \"I don't know. If Dad sees anything, he's going to get upset.\" \"Hey,\" said Michael. \"How did you enroll here anyway?\" Jamie answered, \" I didn't. I snuck in. \" My brother furrowed his brow. \" And nobody said anything? \" \"I hid in the attic store room yesterday. Read The Neverending Story .\" I stared. \"It's a book. By Michael Ende. Kind of ironic, really. I got the idea for my hiding spot from the book.\" \"That will only work so long,\" my brother said. \"What if they catch you in the hall?\" \"I actually did get caught yesterday. Some guy asked what I was doing without a hall pass, and I said going to detention, I acted up in Mrs. South's class...He didn't even check to see if I went to the right room.\" \"I'm guessing you found a school roster.\" She nodded. \" And I overheard some things. \" Michael paused and thought a moment. \"Tell you what. I'll take you to the principal's office, tell Mr. Hiskey that you're my cousin, and that there's been a death in the family, so you've come to live with us. I'll tell him the paperwork will get taken care of later.\" \"Sounds good,\" I said. Of course, I reflected how weird it would look to the school, you know, Frenching my cousin and all. \"Can I come along?\" He shook his head. \"I got this. You just go to class. It'll look more official.\" \"Oh..kay,\" I stammered. \"Someone may have seen us kissing,\" Jamie pointed out. \"What if somebody says something?\" Mike rolled his eyes, looking rather disgusted. \"We're close to The Ozarks. I don't think they'll care that much.\" \"Kissin' cousins, \" Jamie said with a hillbilly accent. I laughed. The bell rang, compelling me to leave. My `cousin' blew me a kiss. Life was going to get awkward fast. Halfway down the hall, Jimmy shoved me up against a locker. \"Not so tough when girlfriend's not around, are you?\" I got beat up. I know, I'd like to tell you something cool like how I used Kung Fu and kicked his butt, but this isn't that kind of story. Yeah, yeah, I may have attacked an army guy at that base, but, well, that guy was only trying to grab me, not make mincemeat out of me. I tried to fight back, but it didn't work. He just knocked my glasses off, popped me in the face, and shoved me to the floor. I tried to get away, but he just pounded me until I cried. Mr. Cubits, the math teacher, who incidentally also taught gym, grabbed us both, dragging us to the principal's office. The look on his bearded face said he didn't care who was in the right. The principal kept paddles in his office, but I've heard that sort of `academic discipline' was being phased out. Both our parents, of course, got called in from work. Dad gave me a dirty look, probably because I didn't defend myself, but I got this weird feeling like ET would have wanted it this way. I mean, sometimes I got the opposite of that feeling just eating foods containing meat. One of the advantages to being beaten up, instead of having beaten someone up: Only you have a real solid ground to complain, and only you have the beauty marks to prove it. And you don't have to write `I will night fight' a million times in a notebook. When Mr. Hiskey dismissed me, Dad took me aside, muttering to me. \"Guess in some ways you take after your mother more than you do me.\" He took a deep breath. \"As much as I hate to say it, you probably did the right thing. Your suboptimal performance in battle might actually work in your favor. If you gain a reputation as a wimp, no one will mistake you for a top secret military property.\" \"Yeah,\" I muttered. \" Wonderful. \" \"Next time, just hit him in the crotch and poke him in the eyes . That's gotten me out of a lot of scrapes.\" He rubbed my shoulder. \"Congratulations about the new cousin , by the way.\" Dad left for work, and I returned to class. I almost got brought back to the principal's office for passing notes. Jamie was telling me how this or that symbol on our diagrams stood for something or another. About the third time I sneaked her a note, my bird nosed science teacher, Mr. Sigler, intercepted it. He smirked a little when he unfolded the paper. I could tell he was expecting a love letter. When he saw all the symbols and such, he looked around the classroom like he thought someone was playing a practical joke. The man turned the paper around and around a couple times, smirked, then added a few things, spreading the note out in front of me. \"What are you trying to do, make explosives?\" I swallowed hard. If I said one wrong thing to him, he could cause so much unwanted attention for me that black vans would be there in an hour. \"Um...it's kind of a game.\" He kept staring at me like he intended to put me in an advanced placement test for college or something...and call the black van people. \"It's a board game. You know, like Dungeons and Dragons , except it's science fiction. You know, Star Wars? \" The man furrowed his brow. \"Do you even know what these symbols mean?\" I shook my head. \"It's in a manual. I think most of them are alien words. \" He poked a finger at a section. \" That's a chemical equation. I just finished it for you.\" \"Uh, thanks. \" Everyone in class was staring at me. \"Nerd,\" I heard more than a few whispering. Any one of them could march up to the office and make a call to someone in the CIA. Mr. Sigler cleared his throat, tucking his pen into the pocket protector of his flannel shirt. \"Going back to our lesson...Wolfgang, can you tell me the difference between a metamorphic and an igneous rock?\" I rubbed my face in frustration. Now was not a safe time to be smart. \"Uh...metamorphic... are the ones with crystals. \" The teacher tapped the paper, frowned a little. \"Mr. Mueller, all three types of rocks have been known to feature crystals.\" I reddened. \"I meant quartz . It's a metamorphic rock.\" Mr. Sigler looked at me like I were crazy. \"Quartzite is metamorphic, but quartz can show up in sedimentary and igneous rock formations.\" He folded up my paper, stuck it in his pocket. \" Pay attention , Mr. Mueller. If all that chemistry is required to ` blow up the Death Star' , it wouldn't hurt to add some geology to your repertoire.\" I gave him a reluctant nod, mostly because I wanted the note back. I endured a lecture on rocks. Sedimentation, calderas, tectonic movement, enduring his corny jokes about apatite, magnetite and such. I bombed a question about twin striations. Jamie, likewise, failed t properly explain what Plagioclase meant. Neither of us had to try very hard to be incorrect, the chemistry thing seemed to be a fluke. I thought we were in the clear until the bell rang and Mr. Sigler kept us both from leaving. The man leaned back on his desk, crossing his arms. \"It's not unheard of for scientific geniuses to be related. William and Caroline Herschel, for example, were brother and sister, and they changed the world of astronomy. They discovered comets , and the planet Uranus ...\" \"I'm not as smart as you think I am,\" I stammered. The man grinned. \" You're just being modest .\" Jamie put her hands on her hips. \"Like he said. It's just a stupid board game. We didn't even know what we were looking at until you told us.\" I quickly added, \"And we're never going to figure out how to stop Vader until I can get that note back.\" \"Nonsense,\" he said, tapping the side of his head. \" The answer's right up here. You only got to think about it a little. \" He offered me the paper, then snatched it away before I could grab it. \" You guys are studying way above your grade level. I'll bet what I'm teaching just isn't stimulating you enough.\" My gut told me this was code for `I'm going to call the men in black vans.' Me and Jamie slowly shook our heads no. \"We have a test for geniuses such as yourselves. If you pass, you'll have the fast track to any college in the country. How does that sound?\" A great reason to tell dad it's time to pack up and leave, I thought, giving Jamie a sideways glance. \"We don't want to be freaks, Mr. Sigler,\" my girlfriend blurted. \" In fact, you actually embarrassed us today . Testing out is great and all, but we'll miss out on a lot of social experiences.\" \"We're out in the middle of nowhere. What exactly would you miss?\" \"Whatever regular kids do at our ages. \" The man squinted at my face. \"Like getting bullied?\" \"Whatever we do here, it builds character, for the rest of our life.\" The man rubbed his chin thoughtfully for a moment. \"Did your father coach you into saying that?\" Jamie shot me a questioning glance. I only shrugged. \"Well, he did mention it to me, but I think he's right. I hear prodigies miss out on all kinds of things like homecoming, field trips, senior prom... You really can't get those back.\" \"Plus we really don't have a clue about geology,\" I said. \"Or English, or history or...\" The man shook his head, handing the paper back. \"All right. Have it your way. But from now on, pay attention. \" We both breathed a sigh of relief as we escaped the classroom. \"Could you imagine what would happen if I did one of those tests?\" I said. Jamie giggled. \"Nothing, I'm guessing. We'd both get a big fat zero for other sciences, and I really suck at math. \" \"Yeah, but he could send the paper to Washington . Or Iowa . Someone might put two and to together, no pun intended. We could get caught...You think I should tell Dad?\" She shook her head. \" Not unless you want to move out of town. \" I sighed. \"He's probably going to find out anyway, once we have parent teacher conferences.\" \"That's then. You tell him now and he'll panic.\" She stared at me a moment. \"Your eye does look puffy on one side...\" \"Dad says it's better this way. You know, me not being so conspicuously amazing.\" \"As long as he doesn't find out about science class.\" \"Guess not.\" She gave me a light peck on the cheek. \"See you at lunch.\" We only shared a couple classes. The other ones like English and social studies I took alone. Honestly, not as good at those things, but my inadequacy wouldn't stop anyone from calling me a nerd. Not after that science class. At lunch, me and Jamie sat together. People snickered and murmured to one another, pointed to us. Only near the end of the thirty minutes did a plump long haired brunette come up to us and say, \"I heard your cousin kissed you on the mouth. Is that true? \" I reddened. \"...No. \" \"I'm adopted,\" Jamie said. \"What's the big deal?\" The stranger chuckled. \"Nothing. Just curious! \" I won't bore you with details of the rest of my day. I got educated, one of the teachers showed us The Peanut Butter Solution , they dismissed us. I accidentally bowled my sister over on the way out the door. She took a tumble down the front steps, but the stairs were short, so she didn't get hurt. \"Hey! Watch where you're going, you clumsy dumb head!\" As she got back up and dusted herself off, I noticed a Big Chief notebook had fallen out of her backpack, a few pages blowing away in the wind. When I noticed the diagrams and equations, I rushed to grab them. I stared at the large lined papers in disbelief. \" You had the same dream! \" My sister shrugged. \"You dreamed about the big computery thing?\" I nodded. \"We've got to get home and piece this together!\" Michael always went straight to the furniture shop after school, so only the three of us returned to the cabin. Dad wasn't home, probably making up time at work. I, Jamie and Gertie hurried to the basement, spending an hour trying to piece all our hasty scribblings together. \"How about we use one of your computers?\" Jamie asked. \"After all, that was part of the dream...\" That seemed as good an idea as any, so I booted up a system, programmed in a few sections of our... confusing mishmash of information . It was a tedious process. Coding was complicated, and I saved everything on a VIC-20 cassette tape machine. Not a terribly efficient memory device, even for restoring saved games on text adventures. After spending an hour writing and rewriting code, Jamie muttered, \"I wish there was some kind of graphical interface we could use for all this.\" \"Graphical?\" I said. \"Like pictures? \" \"Um, yeah. So you can see what you're doing. Or at least little squares or picture boxes that you can move around.\" \"Like a window? \" \"Yeah. Like a window. \" \"That's a great idea, Jamie. But I don't see how that'd work. Besides, we're just trying to get this thing to run , not make it look pretty. We don't even know what it is yet.\" \"Hey... Wolfgang !\" Dad called from the top of the stairs. \"Found you something. Think you'll like it. Some guy was throwing it out, along with a box of black plastic things.\" Dad brought me the floppy drive to an Apple II and some blank floppy disks. The new drive actually helped. I knew how to rewire it to fit my computer, so we had some memory stability. After we'd been at this for a couple hours, Dad visited our lab again. \"Don't you kids have homework ? Real homework, I mean?\" \"This is important,\" I said. \"So's homework. C'mon. Get going or I'll shut down the lab.\" We did what we were told. After homework was dinner, and shopping for clothes. The pay at Dad's job wasn't great. He often had to call the utilities people and credit card companies for extensions, so we had to get Jamie a wardrobe from Maj-R-Thrift. It wouldn't win us any popularity contests, but it wasn't like we could afford better. We were lucky to have what we did, with Ruby out of the picture. When we at last returned to the lab, I discovered that Gertie had stuck stuff up in between parts of our diagram, a crossword, stationary from the phone stand in the living room, pages from the TV Guide... \"Hey!\" I cried. \"Gertie! What did you do!\" \"I think Dad had the dream, he just doesn't want to tell us.\" I stared at the crossword. He'd filled all the boxes with symbols, trailing out at the edges. He'd `doodled' similar things while on the phone, negotiating with debt collectors and utilities people. His contribution was a jumbled mess, parts of it doubling back on other parts. One equation he had scribbled right through a Peanuts cartoon. We had to do a rubbing on the paper to figure out what he meant. Ironically, he'd filled in one line of the crossword with the word `Palimpsest.' When I looked it up in the dictionary, I decided it was a pretty good description of his handwriting. Out of desperation, I took our carefully pieced together duplication up to dad for an explanation of what clearly seemed to be missing. He scratched his head. \"I don't know. That's just some crap I dreamed about. Doesn't mean anything.\" \"Yeah?\" I said. \"Well, it's neat, and I can't read parts of it.\" \"I'm shocked that you can read any of it!\" He shrugged, took a pen, and drew some stuff on our paper. \"If you think you can use this to build your bomb, you're crazier than I thought.\" \"Is that all you...dreamed about?\" Dad laughed. \"Before I appeared naked in my high school cafeteria? Hell, I don't know, I guess there were some other pieces that go along with all that gobbledygook, but I figured they were just...things I picked up in college. You know, like Newton's Constant, or Einstein's Law of Thermodynamics, or whatever the hell you call those things. I only jotted down the stuff you can't dig up at the library. You know, the weird stuff.\" It was too late in the day to go to the library. We'd gone shopping about the time it closed for the day, and you couldn't just jump on the computer and pull up a science book. We would have needed a phone number of someone crazy enough to type all of that into their machine, someone who would let us dial in anytime we wanted, and we didn't know anyone like that. I told the others about the predicament. Jamie sighed. \"Guess we'll just have to wait until tomorrow to figure out what this is.\" As fate would have it, Michael was taking a chemistry class in high school, and early in the semester, the teacher had given them all textbooks that weren't exactly appropriate for the course. The teacher said the books didn't explain the material very well, and it often went off in strange tangents unrelated to chemistry. Michael was supposed to turn his in, but he kept forgetting that the book had been used to prop up a wobbly table leg. The teacher was right. The book seemed to be written for scientists who already knew everything, its only strength seeming to be brevity, making it a good fit for the table. That being said, we did find the reference section in the back very interesting . A couple of those equations fit perfectly into our system . The moment I punched the last character in, a glowing sphere appeared in the air in front of us, roughly the size of a baseball. I don't know how it happened. I mean, in addition to making my own computers, I had been experimenting with a laser, but the only thing I'd been able to do with it was make sort of a burglar alarm, slowly cut holes in wood, and scan in a serial number. Somehow this thing , this program, used that to create an energy field. Maybe it manipulated electromagnetism, or vibrated air particles. Whatever the reason, I now had a glowing orb. \"What do you think it is?\" Jamie asked. \"Dunno.\" Gertie pointed to the screen. \"Look! Pictures!\" It seemed we had created a graphical user interface, after all. The monitor now displayed a blueprint of the cabin basement. \"Hey neat!\" Jamie said, rushing to the keyboard. \"Maybe it's like Pac-Man!\" The moment she pushed an arrow key, all hell broke loose. It turned out that a dot on the monitor represented the location of our orb, and when Jamie held down the right arrow, a whole shelf of tools and computer equipment came crashing to the floor. The orb whipped around, broke a bunch of mason jars, scattered a socket set, obliterated a potted plant. The ball shattered the basement window, and I heard a cat screeching outside. \"Elliott!\" Dad yelled. \"What in the Sam hell are you doing down there!\"[Chapter 11] In response to Guest (geistklempner-I'm unable to private message a non member), this is not supposed to be an Explorers fanfic or crossover. Although I liked Explorers , I was wanting the ending to be different. If you're a fan of the other movie, you may find some of this to be familiar, but keep reading. The plot is going off in a completely different direction. [0000] I shut off the computer, but not before we'd discovered that the machine mapped out more than just the interior of buildings. Dad practically fell headlong rushing down the stairs to investigate. \"Boy!\" he shouted, pointing his finger. He stopped, staring at the mess. \"You really did make a bomb, didn't you?\" \"No,\" I protested. \"It's not like that. It's...\" Jamie spoke before I could offer my own muddled explanation. \" It's safer. \" Dad laughed. \" Sure as hell could have fooled me! \" He frowned at the smashed window. \"Great. That's just what we need. \" He made us staple plastic over the damage, and then he just stood there, staring at us with his arms crossed. \"I'd ground you, but you seem perfectly content to stay indoors.\" \"Nothing's on fire,\" Jamie pointed out. Dad rolled his eyes. \"True...But you made a mess, probably disturbed the whole neighborhood.\" \"They probably just thought we were playing baseball,\" said Gertie. He kept staring. \"Your mother would have freaked out and punished you. You certainly deserve it. Myself, well...I set up this lab for a reason . The only question I must ask is, is there any money making potential involved here? Alternative fuel, that kind of thing? At least spare me the inconvenience of stopping at gas stations!\" \"Um,\" I stammered. \" Maybe? \" Dad gave me a skeptical look. \"That's a no , isn't it? You gave me the same ` Maybe ' before I tried selling your computers.\" \"It looks like something the military could use,\" Jamie said. He winced. \"Let's, uh, keep that under the category of `home defense' for the time being. I'll leave you to it, as long as you don't blow up the cabin anymore.\" \"We didn't blow it-\" I began, but Jamie just elbowed me. \"We'll test it away from the house from now on.\" I could read dismay in Dad's face, but she cleared it up by adding, \" It's a secure place. No one will see us. \" He gave us a reluctant nod, then marched up to our paperwork, developing that look he got when he forgot where he parked the car. \"You dreamed about it too, didn't you?\" Gertie asked. As sort of an answer, Dad replied, \"Have you ever considered the possibility that your little green man may have an ulterior motive?\" \"Like what?\" I said. \"ET's my friend.\" Gertie looked puzzled. \"What's an all...terrier...ult...ter?\" Dad smiled and rubbed her head. \"You know... ulterior . Like, when Tom Sawyer's dad told him to paint a fence, so Tom tells the neighbor kids how fun it is to do his job, so his lazy ass doesn't have to paint it himself. You got a secret agenda that you're not telling folks. \" \"ET's not like that, and, and even if he was, I wouldn't mind painting his fences.\" Dad sighed. \" Tyke, how do you know you can trust him? Maybe when he goes home he takes his face off and eats people like they do in that TV show.\" \"Dad,\" I said. \"He doesn't want to eat us. He had plenty of chances. Mostly he just ate Reese's Pieces.\" Dad laughed. \"You sure? Maybe he just wasn't hungry. \" When he noticed my serious expression, he groaned, continuing his line of thought. \"Say you're a Zulu , living in a hut in Africa, and some rich white factory owner gives you blueprints to a power station. Okay, so maybe you make your own light bulbs or fans or something, but the guy's got an agenda . Next thing you know, he's trying to sell you a bunch of stuff you don't need, or the power station is something they need to run a new factory that will make him millions. Kills all the plants, dumps trash everywhere. You see my point?\" \"But ET loves plants!\" Gertie argued. \"He'd never do that!\" \"Yeah? What about his cousins? What about his government?\" She didn't have an answer to that. \"...For all we know, his planet could look like a trash dump. Maybe your friend is like one of those treehugger types that's trying to un-mess up our environment.\" Gertie's facial expression reminded me of that time when mom told her that babies came `From a woman's tummy.' \"Wait,\" Jamie said. \"He can't be both a tree hugger and an industrial expansionist.\" \"Okay, so what if his little machine starts blowing up lumber mills and McDonald's restaurants, and putting granola eating John Denver in the White House? My point is, we don't know anything about all this. You've got Pandora's Box. It could do anything, if it doesn't alert the FBI and everyone else to our presence first. \" \"We'll be careful.\" Dad's response sounded skeptical. \"If you say so.\" Michael, having gotten home about this time, joined us in the disaster area, looking annoyed at all the broken stuff. \" You guys are nuts. \" For the next hour, Dad had us clean everything up and put things away. It had gotten really late, and Dad wanted to sleep, so we couldn't do any further experiments. \"Off to bed, Doctor Oppenheimer,\" he had said. For Jamie, Dad had gotten an old army cot out of storage, setting it up next to Gertie's bed. Gertie got all excited about it because it was like she'd gained a big sister and they were having a slumber party or whatever. She kept the lights on, dolling my girlfriend's hair and playing around until Dad got mad and yelled, \"Jan! Cindy! Stop screwing around and get to bed!\" \"My name's Anna,\" Gertie corrected. \"It's a Brady Bunch reference!\" he snapped. \"I know tomorrow is Saturday, but some people have to work! Sleep! Now!\" I, on the other hand, found myself just lying in bed with the lights off, staring at the ceiling. \"Elliott...\" Jamie was calling me on the walkie. I picked up. \"You can't sleep either?\" \"You think Edison slept when he got the idea for the light bulb?\" \"I've heard people thought of the light before him, but yeah, he probably didn't sleep...\" \"So what do you think we just made?\" \"I'm not sure. It seems to be some kind of energy field. Maybe when we finally get our spaceship built, we can use it to, I don't know, smash asteroids ? You know, like a photon torpedo or something?\" I mean, if you fire a gun in space, your whole body goes flying back in the opposite direction, so this could prevent that...Anyways, we won't know until we test it some more. Away from the house.\" A moment later, Dad's voice came on the walkie-talkie. \"Go to bed, kids! Over and out!\" I didn't dream about anything special, just flying like Peter Pan and getting lost on the way to school with lions chasing after me. A gravelly male voice awakened me from my slumber. When I crept into the living room, I discovered a strange black man sitting with dad. The visitor had a short afro, a kind looking face, mustache, his well toned arms poking out of a Celtics jersey. He laughed and smoked, telling Dad a story I couldn't hear. The moment Dad noticed me spying, he grinned and muttered to the stranger, waving me over. \"Elliott, this is Nicholas , Ruby's brother.\" Nick shook my hand. \" Any friend of Ruby's is a friend of mine. \" I gave Dad a questioning look. \"Relax, kid. He's been briefed.\" He continued his conversation. \"How is she holding up?\" \"As well as can be expected. They had her locked up, but they let her out of the place. `Still can't so much as fart without some guy in a black van following her around.\" \"And the girls?\" \"They're fine. She's doing the single mom thing. You know that's nothing new to her.\" Dad sighed. \"I hate having to choose between her and my brats. She's not mad, is she?\" \"She's not mad, is she?\" Nick gave him a slight smirk. \"Naw. She still loves the hell out of you. You may be white, but you're a good man.\" \"You tell her I still love the hell out of her. \" \"Is it true you proposed?\" Dad shrugged. \"Can't say I see that ever happening now... \" Nick frowned. \" I know . Some heavy sh-\" he gave me a sideways glance. \" Stuff going down...\" \"You're a good brother, Nick. It's so hard for me to find people I can trust these days.\" \"I know what it's like to be on the run. Believe you me, I have no love for the po-po. I've had five years' worth of experience on the subject.\" Dad gave him a wry smile. \" Had mine remanded to community service. \" Nick rolled his eyes. \"Steve, sometimes you got a bad habit of not knowing when to stop talking.\" I pointed to a Topsy's bucket on the table. \"What's with the popcorn?\" The man gave me a cheesy grin. \" Peace offering. The girls couldn't just walk out of your dad's house with a wad of cash and a handgun , not with all those government types watching, so they staged a little movie night.. .I think there's a love letter under the cinnamon.\" \"I'm not going to blow my hand off if I decide to eat caramel, am I?\" Dad joked. Nick grinned. \" Naw, man, it's under the butter side. Only the shells are in the caramel...\" I stared, wondering how they managed to pull off that trick without being caught. \"So Ruby just handed you the bucket, and nobody said anything?\" Our guest laughed. \"Naw, man! Nothing that easy to trace. We played kind of a shell game. Filled the bucket a few times along the way. I was actually the last one to get it. At one time, the army dudes actually made us open it up. Good thing they didn't check the weight. \" By now, Gertie had awakened. \"Daddy, who's this?\" Dad put a hand on our guest's shoulder. \"Sugar, this is Nick, Ruby's brother.\" My sister wrinkled her nose. \"Smoking's bad for you.\" Nick chuckled. \"Are you certain, little miss? `Cuz I've seen some old assed Indians... \" The look on Dad's face said `Play time is over, Nick.' \"C'mon. She's right. Indians roll their own, and they'd be dead if they smoked like you do. Put it out.\" \"What about George Burns?\" \"He smokes cigars.\" Nick stubbed out his cigarette, glanced at the door to the hallway. \"Damn, man, how many kids you got? \" Jamie had been watching us. Dad shot her a disapproving glance. \"I only gained one extra since last time. Not mine. Let's just call it an adoption.\" Our visitor furrowed his brow, making this face like he recognized the girl. \"She's...cute. What's her name?\" \"Lori . She was homeless, so I took her in.\" The look on Nick's face said he didn't buy it. \"You sure she don't got parents looking for her?\" Dad shrugged. \" One of the many disadvantages of being a fugitive from the law. \" Nick nodded, rising from the table. \" I'll do some research. \" He shook Dad's hand, waved me and Gertie goodbye, smiled at Lori, and gave Michael a \"Goodbye, young man\" on the way out the door, Mike seeming to know the guy already. \"Are we having popcorn for breakfast?\" Gertie asked. Dad had made our breakfast while talking to Nick, but of course the little visit had delayed him, so he didn't have time to read us Ruby's letter. He merely fished the items out and left for work. Being that Mike was off to the shop, it was just us, so as usual, we were to not go far from the house, and keep the place locked up if we went somewhere...he also gave Gertie instructions to report to him if things between me and Jamie got \"More than familial.\" My sister had grimaced and asked, \" You mean like kissing and stuff? \" In response, Dad had laughed and rubbed her head. \"Exactly.\" When he was out of earshot, Jamie cried, \"Great! Now what do we do? If that guy finds out who I am, he'll tell your dad!\" \"He also said he wasn't friends with the police,\" I pointed out. \"Besides, you're the one who ran away from home. You didn't want to tell dad, so I guess you just gotta cross your fingers and hope he doesn't find out anything.\" She frowned. \"Gee, thanks a lot!\" \"What! I don't know how to help you. You're going to get caught, I just don't know when. Want to live in that abandoned building again or something?\" Jamie gave me a look like she might. \"Maybe I'll sneak out the moment he finds out.\" I sighed. \"Maybe you should just go back home.\" She reddened. \"No way! You're the coolest boy I ever met! Besides...what do you think they'll do to me if I go back?\" I shrugged. \"I'm guessing they won't lock you up like they did me.\" \"You made my chest glow.\" I blushed. \"Yeah, but they don't know that.\" She abruptly changed the subject. \"Let's go field test that asteroid smasher thing.\" In case you're wondering, things stayed \"Familial.\" We had a lot more important things to do. As I mentioned before, I'd been doing some experiments with alternate sources of electricity. Dad let me take apart some bad discarded car batteries for this purpose. A little sunlight, a little plant pulp, and a few lines from our Dungeons and Dragons manual got me all the power I needed to make my asteroid crusher mobile. We placed the equipment in the Radio Flyer and a wheelbarrow and set up everything in a heavily wooded area downhill from the cabin. I set the computer u on a stump. \"We're missing Kidd Video ,\" Gertie complained as she watched me type. Jamie stared. \"What's Kidd Video?\" \"It's a show. It's got a rock band and they get sucked into a mirror and someone turns them into cartoons.\" I groaned. \" You want to watch cartoons, or see ET again? \" \"ET,\" Gertie sighed, sitting down on a rock. \"What do you expect to accomplish with all this anyway?\" Jamie asked. \"I mean, say you build this. ..spaceship , and actually get into space. What then? What are you trying to do?\" I shrugged. \"Dunno. Maybe go someplace where I don't have to hide? \" \"So you're just going to leave earth and live with your alien friend forever?\" \"I don't really have a choice! I mean, what else can I do?\" \"You're talking about leaving your planet and your whole family behind.\" \"I've pretty much done that anyway. The moment I go back to mom, some guy in a van is going to pop out and drag me off to an army base. Either that, or I'll spend my whole life in hiding.\" \"What about your sister?\" \"Yeah!\" Gertie exclaimed. \"What about me!\" I swallowed. \"I'll take you along with me. I don't want anyone putting you in a cell again.\" My sister looked glum. \"But then I'll never see mommy.\" \"Gertie, I don't think we're going to get to see mommy again.\" This made her burst into tears, so I held her. \"Tell me it's not true!\" she whimpered. \"Please, Elliott!\" \"I...I can't. We're freaks, and those guys in vans want to stick us in an army base forever. If anyone tells you otherwise, they're probably lying.\" She cried more, but all I could do was hold her and pat her back. \" You're saying ET is our family now? We're going to leave daddy, too? \" \"We're only making things hard for him. He has to keep hiding from the cops and stuff. That's no kind of life. If we go into space, and live with ET, he won't have to worry about us being captured again.\" \"But then he'll go to jail! And what about Michael?\" I shook my head. \"I guess we probably should take Mike along...\" And then to Jamie I stammered, \" And if you wanted, you could join us... \" \"Why not fly to Mexico ...or Australia? Or even better yet, a deserted island? You don't have to leave the planet!\" \"Someone could still find me.\" Jamie rubbed her face. \"They could find you anyway, with radar , or a satellite . By the way, what's your dad going to do? \" I shook my head. \"He's the one that broke me out. He'll understand. I'd ask him to come with, but it already sounds like he doesn't trust ET very much.\" \"How do you even know you'll be safe with.. .ET's people ? For that matter, how do you know they'll have air? \" \"He seemed to breathe my air just fine.\" \"You ever seen that Twilight Zone about the guy that gets put in the zoo? That could be you, Elliott!\" \"And I'll get locked in a cell if I go home. What's the difference?\" We made the orb appear again. Jamie frowned at the display. \"I wish your friend had given us some instructions.\" \"Wait,\" I said. \" Maybe he has. \" I rushed back to the cabin, returning with the two books Jamie had brought from my old house. After studying the alien's handwriting for a few moments, I discovered our new invention was more than a weapon. \"Wait. It says here we can reshape the thing.\" Thanks to ET's writing, we discovered that the sphere could be opened and closed in different ways, and got a pretty good idea of how to control it. Now, a squirrel had been watching us the whole time from the bough of a tree. I know, it's weird, but some animals are funny, and just sit there and stare at you, especially if you don't make any sudden moves. Upon spotting it, Jamie pointed and pushed me away from the keypad, quickly typing commands into the system. The squirrel let out a frantic squeal as the glowing orb appeared around its little body, lifting it into the air. It rolled around and around inside the ball, like a hamster in an exercise toy, then gave up, lying flat on the bottom as it passively surrendered to the experience. I have never heard a squirrel make weirder noises. We must have toyed with the poor thing a little too long. It stopped moving, and didn't appear to be breathing. \"You killed it!\" Gertie cried. \"Shut it off! Shut it off!\" I quickly did so, rushing to examine our fuzzy little test subject. \"What do you think happened?\" Jamie asked. I shrugged, squinting at the tiny creature to see if its chest had moved. It really did look dead. \"Not sure. Maybe he ran out of air.\" \"Oh I feel so bad!\" Gertie started crying. \"No! Mister Squirrel!\" The squirrel let out a feeble gasp, then opened its beady black eyes. A huge breath followed, then several frightened shallow breaths as it realized it had been surrounded by humans. With a quack, and a terrified shriek, the rodent bolted, shooting off like a rocket into the brush somewhere. \"That's interesting,\" Jamie said. \"If we can lift a squirrel, we can probably move a whole person.\" \"Yeah, but anyone who tries it will just pass out like that squirrel.\" \"Any idea why he didn't stop breathing the moment we put him in the bubble?\" \"The same reason why a fish will live if you scoop it out of a river with a bucket.\" My sister stepped in the little clearing in front of our equipment. \"Do me next. I'll hold my breath.\" She inhaled and kept it in to illustrate. \"No, Gertie!\" I protested. \"It's too dangerous!\" \"Please? I want to show Mister Squirrel I'm sorry. \" \"Gertie, he's just a squirrel. \" \"And you're just a person, \" she pouted. \"He was okay, you just did it too long. I'll hold my breath, I promise.\" \"Gertie...\" \"How are we ever going to see ET if you're too chicken to let me try it?\" she whimpered. \"She's got a point,\" Jamie said. \"You saw how that squirrel flew. We just got to be careful about how long we leave her in the bubble.\" My sister grinned. \"Yaay!\" Gertie didn't hold her breath. At least, not before we put her in the bubble. Still, she seemed okay, even when she forgot and tried to breathe. She giggled as we floated her around the trees, way up above the branches and canopy. All of a sudden, my sister looked suspiciously tired . \"Gertie!\" I called. \"Are you all right?\" She shrugged. \"I dunno. I.. .guess . I feel... sleepy. \" \"Quick!\" Jamie cried. \"Get her down!\" As my fingers rushed across the keyboard, my friend hurried underneath the bubble, arms outstretched. \"Gertie! Get ready to fall!\" In her semiconscious state, Gertie didn't even try to prepare herself. Jamie had to jump back a foot to grab her before she hit the ground. For a moment, my sister just gasped in Jamie's arms. \"Are you all right?\" Gertie nodded. \"I...just... couldn't breathe , and my head got all swimmy and I saw stars.\" \"Running out of air will do that to you.\" My girlfriend and I stared at each other. \"You know what this means, don't you?\" Jamie nodded. \"But what are we going to do about the oxygen supply?\" I saw a guy making compressed air in a movie once. He hooked two empty barrels together with surgical tubing and poured water into one of them. The water forced the air in the other tank to compress. I improvised a small version of that by soldering together coffee cans and an industrial sized peanut butter jar. Jamie frowned at my invention. \"Couldn't we just swipe some oxygen equipment from a nursing home?\" I looked at her like she were crazy. \"How could you even suggest such a thing?\" She shrugged. \"I've seen some people stockpile them . They're on a temporary recovery situation, back from the hospital or something, you know, `on the mend', and the paperwork gets messed up and then nobody comes to pick up the extra tanks.\" I stared, thinking she might be onto something, after all. \"Do you... know somebody like that?\" \"In California.\" I rolled my eyes. \"That's helpful. Anyways, ET's book showed me how to make a few things that could triple the natural air production of plants. I think we could probably do that.\" I tapped the coffee cans. \"We could also build a bigger one of these , I mean, fill a trash can with water or something...\" \"And breathe in garbage? Gross! \" \"I think there's a few rain barrels around here somewhere...\" Gertie was small, and had little lungs. That's why we let her play astronaut again. She got stuck in a tree and broke our homemade scuba tank. She had to hold her breath while we lowered her down in the bubble. We spent the rest of the day trying to figure out how to build our vehicle out of our bubble machine, and some sort of air apparatus. Okay, well, Gertie was trying to make flight suits out of shower curtains and pajamas, but Jamie and I spent our time drawing up materials lists, scrounging up whatever we could that matched the item's description. \"So,\" Dad said when he came home a little while later. \"What did you kids blow up today?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"It's not a bomb,\" Gertie blurted. \"We made a giant bubble, and I flew. I actually flew! I'm going to be an astronaut! \" Dad rolled his eyes when he noticed the sewing job she'd given to her pajamas. \"Is that a fact.\" \"I was the alien monster,\" Jamie said, spinning it into the `pretend' direction. My sister's face turned a bright red. \"No you weren't! You were helping me fly! Tell him the truth!\" Jamie gave him a cheesy grin. \"Oh yeah! I completely forgot! We were doing that!\" She made pretend spaceship noises, pantomiming walking on the moon. \"Shooooommm!\" And that's how Dad blew it off as a game. Not much of a stretch, really. Who would believe that we actually made my sister float in the air with a computer program? We ate dinner, and Dad read Ruby's letter to us, well, the parts suitable for kids. My guess is that he had been savoring the note all day long, refusing to read it until he got home, for he seemed as excited to read it as we were to hear it. In the letter, she said she missed us, she said that mom was still trying to find us, and talking to the cops a lot. They had a warrant out for Dad's arrest. I flinched when Dad read about \"One of E/W's classmates\" going missing. The moment he read that line, I could tell all the pieces had fallen together in his head. He suddenly stopped reading, just glaring at me, breathing heavily through his nose, hands shaking as they crinkled the edges of the paper. Dad set the paper down, balling his fists. He looked ready to hit someone. \"I'm disappointed in you, Elliott. Real disappointed. You lied to me. \"[Chapter 12] I paled as I felt Dad's glare cutting through me. I wasn't even making eye contact, and I could still feel the anger. \"I'm sorry. I...I trust her, but I didn't think you would.\" More sighing through his nose. I felt his gaze turn toward my girlfriend. \" And you, young lady...I'll get Nick to drive you home. \" \"Please don't!\" Jamie whimpered. \"I won't tell anyone anything! I promise!\" \"Good. `Counting on it. You'd be getting us into a lot more trouble than we're in already. Of course, your folks have probably already sent the cops after us, and if you can find us, so can they. \" He got up from the table. \"Wait!\" she protested. \"Where are you going!\" \"Calling Nick. What else?\" \"Don't! Look, Mr. Mueller, my chest was glowing, just like your son! And for the record, I didn't track you guys down the normal way. ET told me how to find you!\" Dad smirked. \" Nice try. Did Elliott put you up to this? \" \"Yes, I mean, only because he kissed me. Somehow he... transferred something to me . The point is, if I go home, they'll just put me in a cell like your son.\" Dad leaned over the table. \" Then you'll have to leave town. \" \"But what am I going to do about food and housing?\" \"You did it before somehow. You'll have to do it again. I'm sorry. Ordinarily I wouldn't put a child out on the street, but if they find you, they find my sons, they find me . We all go off in a big black van. \" \"You can't send her away!\" I protested. \"I'll run away too!\" Dad sighed, rubbed his face, winding up for a verbal barrage. He almost yelled his reply. \"You think you're so smart? What are you going to eat? Where will you sleep? What'll happen our little science project? More importantly, how will you hide from the authorities? \" I sighed, fumbling for answers. Jamie started crying. \"Don't do that,\" Dad groaned. \"Please don't.\" This only made Jamie cry more. \"I've been glowing just like him. They'll take me back and do experiments on me! I just know it! I'm not going back! You're just going to let a poor kid live on the street?\" She kept sobbing. Dad rubbed his face. \"Dammit. All right, all right. You can stay.\" He massaged his temples like he had a migraine. Dad was a self proclaimed \"Stay home Baptist.\" We never went to church, which is probably good, considering how people were looking for us, and we were running a risk even going to school. \"I've seen a few cops going to church,\" Dad had told us once. \"Elsewhere, they don't have as many excuses to hang out.\" And so Dad watched golf and football on Sundays, worked on the truck, ran errands, making us help him... a lot . Not the best time to be building a spaceship or testing things, not with him constantly watching us and trying to get us to do stuff around the house. Now that he'd found out about Jamie, he was paranoid, afraid to even let us leave the house. We replaced the basement window (once Dad brought the item home), made more plans for our ship. \"What you did yesterday wasn't very nice,\" Gertie said to Jamie when Dad left for the store. \"You made it sound like I made everything up. I really did fly , and he didn't believe me.\" She'd tried to convince Dad of this again at breakfast, and earnestly too, but Dad only smiled and rubbed her head. \" Of course you did, sugar.\" \"I'm sorry,\" Jamie said. \"Look, this kind of thing is hard for anyone to believe if you don't actually show them. And if your dad actually saw what we did, he'd never let us experiment with it again. You nearly passed out, Gertie. \" My sister reddened. \"I had oxygen!\" \"I know, I know. But until we have this thing looking safe as a car, I'm afraid your dad is going to get in the way. I mean, he almost kicked me out the moment he learned about me! \" \"You shouldn't have lied. People get in trouble all the time because they lie about things. If they all told the truth, bad things wouldn't happen so much.\" \"I know, I know,\" Jamie groaned. \"Can we at least get this spaceship... space worthy before we unveil our little project?\" Gertie reluctantly nodded. Don't ask me how she did it, but Gertie somehow managed to bring \"Mister Squirrel\" inside the house. It actually sat on her arm and let her pet it. When Dad saw this, he panicked, ordering her to get him out of the house. \"That's a wild animal! You want to get rabies?\" \"He doesn't have rabies,\" my sister told him. Dad laughed. \"And how do you know that? Did you ask him?\" Looking very serious, Gertie nodded and said \"Uh huh. I asked if he was sick, and he said no.\" Dad groaned. \"All right, Gertie. Enough fun and games with the wildlife. Get him out of here. It's bad enough I'm a kidnapper. No need to get child endangerment added to my rap sheet.\" And so Gertie sent the squirrel away. After a whole day of hiding like Anne Frank (he didn't let us outside at all - he even shopped without us), Dad said, \"Okay, this isn't going to work. We have to look normal or people are going to snoop on me for making you disappear. That means you all go to school tomorrow.\" I awoke the next morning to a grabby arm and a sensation of warm breath in my face. Apparently, during the night, Jamie had snuck into my bed. I let out a startled cry, rolling away from her. My body, clad in longjohns, ran out of mattress and thumped on the floor. I sprang to my feet, retreating to the corner. Jamie propped her head up on her elbow, giving me a mischievous grin. \"Good morning. \" I was too flustered to do anything but stammer. Gertie had been watching us from the doorway. \"I'm telling daddy.\" Jamie sat up, straightening her oversized Grateful Dead shirt. \"You do that, and I'll tell him you let Mister Squirrel sleep on your pillow.\" I gawked at my sister. \" You slept with Mister Squirrel on your pillow? \" Gertie scrunched up her face. \" He likes me, okay?\" \"We didn't do anything,\" Jamie blurted. \"By the way, Elliott... cute pajamas. \" I reddened. \"They're longjohns.\" I took a cold shower, went to breakfast. \"Daddy,\" Gertie said in between mouthfuls of cereal. \"If we took a spaceship to another planet, and stayed there a long time, would you miss us?\" Dad furrowed his brow. \"That's a strange question, sugar... Did your Martian friend say he was coming back or something? \" Gertie shook her head. \"I'm just asking. I mean, if we were to build a spaceship, and... \" Dad laughed. He still didn't believe we were capable of anything that fantastic. \"Of course I'd miss you, baby. Why wouldn't I?\" My sister took a deep breath. \"Elliott was saying that you'd be relieved, because you wouldn't have to hide anymore.\" \"Gertie!\" I cried. Dad crossed his arms indignantly. \"Elliott, what's this crap you've been feeding your sister? \" I sighed. \"Dad, I know... this whole situation...It's been hard on you. \" Dad swallowed. \"That doesn't mean I don't love you. Don't you realize that me, being here with you guys, has made me the happiest I've been since, well, since me and your mom were on speaking terms? Don't you know how hard I've been fighting to get custody?\" I stared, speechless. \"I wanted you to come with us to meet ET,\" Gertie said. \"But Elliott didn't think you'd want that.\" Jamie, who had just finished showering, chose that moment to join us at the table. \"ET's going to come back. With his friends. Are you honestly telling us that you want to go with them? To some unknown place on the other end of the galaxy?\" Dad, who had been lifting a mug of coffee to his lips, spilled some on his beard. \"Wait. He is coming back?\" Gertie shot me a questioning look. I shrugged. \"Not anytime soon, but yeah . You really want to come along?\" Dad wiped his face with a towel. \"Whoa whoa whoa! No one's going anywhere! I lost you kids once, I'll be damned if I lose you again!\" \"You won't lose us if you come along,\" Gertie insisted. Dad sighed, rubbing his chin. \"You're serious. They're going to pick you up and fly you off to...Dagobah. \" \"It's called Jufuceri , The Green Planet . He told me. \" He frowned, appearing to give it some serious thought. \" Do they have breathable air? \" Gertie nodded eagerly. \"Elliott's-\" Before she could finish, I said, \" Their ship will have plenty.\" My sister sighed. \"His planet does too. And two moons. He told me. \" \"And that makes it all true,\" Dad groaned. He thoughtfully sipped from the mug. \" So you're saying there's exactly enough air to carry you across the span of our solar system (which incidentally is thousands of light years - we can barely make it to the moon, let alone Mars!) and food, and water, and equipment to stall any sort of degenerative atrophy you might experience in a weightless environment. \" \"ET doesn't use rocket fuel,\" Gertie said. \"It didn't even take a second for his ship to leave earth!\" Dad grimaced, looking not at all convinced. \"Still, this isn't just a trip to corner 7-11. We're talking about hundreds upon thousands of miles. \" Jamie was giving me this look like we should completely rethink our plans. \"Um, Mr. Mueller...\" \"It's Henshaw . Mueller's just my alias. \" \"Fine. Mister Henshaw. Say they only flew us all to another country, or a deserted island. Would that be better?\" Dad's eyes narrowed. \"You really want to play Swiss Family Robinson for the rest of your life? \" \"We were going to play Lost In Space just a minute ago. That'd probably be worse. Anyways, none of us can go home, can we?\" Dad sighed through his nose. \"Let's table this discussion for when your space buddies actually show up.\" \"The spaceship needs to be bigger,\" Gertie told me. \"For him.\" \"Now I'm confused. Are you building a ship, or is one coming to you?\" \"Both,\" Jamie said. Dad chuckled. \"In that case, maybe I could squish myself into a tin can for a couple hours...\" Jamie, catching my pained expression, just rolled her eyes and shook her head, as if to say, `It figures.' \"How come ET keeps telling you all this stuff in secret?\" I asked my sister as we walked to school. \"She made it up,\" Jamie said. \"I didn't make up anything!\" Gertie shouted. \"ET really does talk to me! Maybe you can't hear him because he wants us to work as a team. Maybe he feels sorry for me because I kinda get left out of stuff.\" \"Left out! You were our first astronaut!\" \"After I begged you. And you made daddy think everything is a joke! I'm proud of what I did!\" I put a hand on her shoulder. \"I'm proud of you too. I just don't think this is something we should involve grownups in.\" \"We have to involve him eventually! He's our dad!\" Jamie stopped and stared at me. \"You think that's why ET only talks to her? Because we're fighting?\" \"Dunno. In Peter Pan, the adults couldn't fly. Maybe Gertie's more connected to him because she's not as grown up as we are.\" \"So what happens to us when we get to his place? Will he kick us out for being too old?\" I frowned. \"I...don't know.\" \"ET wouldn't do that!\" Gertie said. \" He likes you! ...I think he just wants you to be nicer to me.\" I gave her an apologetic look, but before I could say something, she added, \"Also, ET says you're scared, and he doesn't want to frighten you. You probably could hear him yourself if you just tried to listen harder.\" \"You're right. I... do get scared, especially when he makes me glow.\" \"That's why you're such a good astronaut, Gertie,\" Jamie said. \" You're not afraid of anything. \" My sister grinned at this. We kept walking. Michael, who had been eavesdropping the whole time, asked, \"What's all this astronaut talk?\" \"Long story,\" I said. He stopped. \"That's what you said yesterday when I asked you what all that stuff was in the basement.\" I glanced at Gertie. The look on her face told me I couldn't let her down again. \"We're building a spaceship. We've got an engine and everything. It actually works. \" Mike looked skeptical. \"You're serious.\" \"You saw how we trashed the basement, didn't you?\" He scratched his head. \"So what happens if you build this thing? You honestly think you can fly it up to...God knows where, and meet up with our space man?\" \"It'll work,\" said Gertie. \"We've done tests. I flew. \" I could tell Mike didn't buy it. \"You... flew. \" \"She's not lying,\" Jamie said. \"It uses energy fields or something. We sent her up in the air and everything.\" \"We can take you with us,\" Gertie said with a smile. \" You, dad, Elliott, Jamie, me, we can all go see ET together! It'll be fun!\" Michael gave me this look like Gertie had gone crazy. \"Whenever you get some free time, and I'm off school, I'll show you. This thing actually works.\" \"You...honestly built a spaceship.\" \"Not exactly. We're still trying to get parts together, but we've got an engine.\" \"And pressure shielding,\" said Jamie. \"Say you're telling the truth, and you do have some sort of starship engine. What are you doing for air?\" \"We got a few plans . Plant based air supplies, pressurized air...maybe borrowing medical supplies if we find anyone who has more 02 than they actually need.\" \"It'd help if we could buy some scuba tanks,\" Jamie suggested. Michael frowned. \"What about materials? You know rocketships have to be asbestos covered titanium and aluminum. You make something out of wood and it'll burn to a crisp in the atmosphere.\" \"That only happens when you go straight up or down really fast,\" Gertie said. \"If you put a shuttle on the back of a plane...\" My brother only responded with a look like he'd developed a headache. \"We've made something that acts like a shield,\" I said. \"Yeah? What if the shield breaks? Ever think of that? Then you gotta think about food, water, and how you're going to go to the toilet... \" \"We're working on it,\" I said. Mike blew a raspberry. \"Look, Elliott. If you're going into space, you need to make serious plans. Air and necessities for the entire length of your journey, waste disposal systems, fire systems, sleeping arrangements...\" \"Okay, okay,\" Jamie said. \"You're right. So we're not ready to fly all the way across the galaxy. The Wright Brothers had to test things out before they got their big plane off the ground. But we're on to something . This thing moves fast . I bet we could fly it around the world in a couple minutes. We might even have the Concorde beat.\" \"Yeah? So what happens if you hit a bird? Or an asteroid, for that matter?\" \"So we need a metal frame...\" I said. \"And someone who knows how to weld. \" Mike must have noticed the look on my face, for then he muttered, \" Me and my big mouth. \" We didn't immediately get to work on our project because we had school, and I still needed to find the parts. Michael left for the high school, Gertie for the neighboring lower grade building, I and Jamie heading up the steps to the middle school. Halfway to the door, Jamie kissed me right on the mouth. I flailed my arms, pulling away quickly. \"Oh my God! Right in front of the school! \" Jamie grinned. \"See you in class.\" I got some stares when I came in the building. I'd only gotten halfway to my first hour class before the school bully shoved me into a locker. I shrank from him, expecting the worst. \"Relax, wimp. I'm not going to beat you. I want to ask you something.\" Jimmy reached into his jacket, taking out a page he'd ripped from the Weekly World News . \"I've been reading an interesting story about a space man. Mind if I check something real quick?\" Before I could say no, he took my glasses and grabbed my face, holding the paper beside my head for a comparison. He turned my head to the side. \"Your real name's Elliott, isn't it?\" I swallowed hard. \"What do you want?\" He slammed my head against a locker door, talking through his teeth. \"I want you to friggin' admit you're the guy in the article!\" The color in my face drained away. \"Let me see what you're talking about.\" He held up the rumpled newsprint page, showing me my picture, paired with an artist's sketch of a generic bug eyed saucer alien. \" See? Now fess up! Is that you or not?\".[Chapter 13] Jimmy held out my glasses, then snatched them back as I tried to grab them. \"These aren't even real. They look like costume props.\" \"You're wrong! I'm really nearsighted! Those are prescription glasses! Give them back!\" He pocketed them, waved the tabloid picture in front of me again. \"Are you sure this isn't jogging your memory? Even a little?\" \"I can't see without my glasses.\" \"You're nearsighted, not blind!\" \"No,\" I stammered. \"It's not me. Please let me go.\" Jimmy grabbed me around the throat. \"You know what, kid? You really suck at lying. You're not even looking at me! \" \"I wouldn't look directly at a mad gorilla, either,\" I muttered. Jimmy's hands tightened around my throat. \"What's that, Wolfie? \" \"Nothing! I'm sorry!\" Jimmy snarled, pressing my head against the cold metal door. \"Look me in the eyes and tell me you're not that Elliott kid!\" \"Okay, okay! It's me!\" I gasped. \"I'm Elliott! What do you want!\" He let go of me with a laugh. \"Thought I recognized you! You know there's a reward out for you? They say your father is a kidnapper!\" \"The government kidnapped me,\" I sighed. \"If you tell anyone, they're not going to take me back to mom.\" Jimmy smirked. \"Is that what he told you?\" \"No. I was kidnapped by the government. Dad broke me out of an army base.\" He laughed. \"That's awesome!\" I slumped against the locker. \"You're going to tell someone, aren't you?\" \"No way! I don't care about that reward!\" He put an arm around my shoulder, whispering conspiratorially. \"Did he probe you? The alien?\" I shook my head. \"What did he look like? Is he really like the picture?\" \"No.\" Since I knew he'd ask anyway, I took out a drawing I had in my notebook. \"He looks like that. \" Jimmy chuckled. \"He looks like an old geezer!\" I shrugged. \" So it's not much of a picture. The point is, he doesn't look like the picture you showed me.\" \"I wanna hear more. Tell me everything!\" \"Why? So you can tell the newspapers? What?\" He pressed his hand against the locker, leaning over me. \" You've just become the most interesting kid in school . I thought you'd like not getting pounded.\" \"I'd rather get pounded than go back to that place!\" Jimmy put the glasses back on my nose. \"Did your alien teach you the secrets of the universe? Like how to use the force?\" I shook my head. \"Nothing that special. At least not anymore.\" He raised an eyebrow. \" But you did? \" I reddened. \"Kinda.\" \"So what did you do?\" The bell rang. \"We're not done,\" Jimmy said. \"Meet me on the playground during lunch.\" In science class, my girlfriend passed me another note. The teacher intercepted it, just like before, but this time he just rolled his eyes and laughed. \" Pay attention. \" I didn't get to see the note until the end of class, and when I did, the only thing I saw were a bunch of nonsense mathematical symbols arranged in a heart shape, with my name in the middle. Jamie blew me a kiss and went on to her next class before I could tell her anything about my aggressive new `friend.' I met the guy at the tetherball pole during lunch hour, as promised. He offered me a cigarette, but I declined. I stared as he lit up. \"You're going to get in trouble.\" \"I'm always in trouble.\" He took a drag. \"So what was that note you were passing around in science the other day? Was it really a bomb? Or were you making drugs?\" I shook my head. \"Neither.\" I showed him the love note. Jimmy frowned. \"I...kinda don't think this is what you were getting all those weird compliments on before.\" He shook the ashes from the cigarette. He thought he looked cool. \"What was it then? I know it wasn't a game. I've been looking around hobby shops ever since those church guys started burning game manuals.\" \"Look,\" I stammered. \"You can't tell anyone about this. Even my dad doesn't know what I'm doing.\" Jimmy grinned. \"Oh man! Now you've got to tell me!\" I swallowed. \"It's... rocket fuel , all right? We're building a spaceship. \" He laughed. \"I'm guessing it's some special kind of rocket fuel, because if you amass too much of the other kind, someone's bound to notice.\" I nodded. \"I got an Atari,\" he said proudly. \"And a whole bunch of games. Have you tried Montezuma's Revenge? \" \"Isn't that when you get the squirts?\" \"That's the same thing I thought. But it's a cool game. You want to come over and play?\" \"You mean right now?\" \"No, dummy! After school!\" I really really didn't want to hang out with him. \"Um, that's okay... \" \"What? You got other plans or something?\" I fumbled for an answer. \"That's right! You're building a spaceship! Who needs an Atari? \" I gave him a slight nod. \"Hey, let me help ! I'm really good with building stuff, and finding equipment.\" I stared at him with skepticism. \"Can you find me large quantities of aluminum and titanium?\" He frowned at me. \"I know where you can get some roller coaster parts. Would that work?\" I grabbed a quick bite in the lunch room, hustled off to social studies. Sometimes in life, you meet two people who have very similar names, and when you're just talking about them, the people listening to your story can get the two mixed up. To make things less confusing to you the reader, from now on I will refer to Jamie as Lori. \"Hey Elliott! Wait up!\" I heard Jimmy calling to me as I was leaving school for the day. \"It's Wolfgang!\" I hissed. \"You want me to get taken away?\" Lori goggled at me. \"Wait, are you actually talking to him?\" I didn't need to say anything. She knew the answer was yes. \"Isn't he that the same guy who beat you up?\" I gave her a pained look. \"Apparently I'm in the tabloids.\" Jimmy grinned at my girlfriend. \"Hey, you're that chick that kicked my ass!\" \"You want me to kick it again?\" she said. \"Go away!\" Jimmy didn't. \"Is she your sister or your girlfriend? `Cuz I've heard it both ways. \" I was going to be honest, and started saying \"Well, she is kinda my friend...\" But Lori finished with \"We're cousins.\" She was staring at me again. \"So, what, you're just going to let him and his buddies in on the secret? They'll blab and tell the whole school!\" \"What, hey,\" Jimmy protested. \"No one's telling anything. The guys don't even believe the story from the paper is true. Bruce doesn't even think there can be life on other planets. He calls it a ` nerd thing.' \" Lori looked nervous. \"We can't just show him the machine! He'll think it's a ride! He'll start charging admission, and having the whole school line up for a turn until your battery dies!...Or those government types show up!\" \"I get it!\" Jimmy groaned. \" You want to keep a low profile! I blab and you go away forever. No spaceship, no space man. Don't worry, I won't talk!\" Lori put her hands on her hips, sighing in frustration. \"He promised not to tell anyone. He just wants in.\" \"In?\" she said incredulously. \"You're making it sound like-\" \"I know, I know! But what can we do?\" \"So he's just going to hang around us while we work?\" I shrugged. \"He said he knows where to get supplies.\" \"I trust him,\" Gertie said. Lori paused in thought for a long time. At last she said, \"Can he get us some O2? \" It turns out he actually did know a few things about that. Jimmy lived in a mobile home on the other side of the railroad tracks, you know, the lower income area. I was shocked to find a little black girl thanking him for getting her doll out of a tree, and fixing the training wheels on her bike. Apparently he did other things besides pounding on classmates. His trailer was...well...not great. Ugly beige and green, wheels taken off, shoddy concrete job on the porch. We kept our opinions to ourselves. In addition to Montezuma's Revenge , Jimmy introduced us to some of his hobbies, throwing biscuit dough and eggs at passing cars, mocking passerby with a microphone and speaker system. \"Real mature!\" Lori said. The demonstrations ended when Jimmy hit a convertible, and the driver got out and yelled at him. Jimmy's dad owned some military surplus gas masks with air tanks. He also had an air compressor, the kind you use for nail guns and spray paint. \"You can pump up a tire with it,\" he explained. \"So I don't see why it won't work for other stuff. The only problem is you'll maybe get an hour of air out of these masks.\" \"We're going to need more than that,\" my girlfriend said. \"Relax, Lori! I'll get you a scuba tank and some 02 later. I just need to talk with grandma.\" \"She...doesn't... need the air , does she?\" \"No way. It was just a temp deal, and now she says they won't take the tanks back.\" He laughed. \"She still goes bowling and she's seventy four. Dad wonders sometimes if she's healthier than he is...I'm going to have a harder time explaining why I'm borrowing her Depend-O's. \" I frowned, not believing what I was hearing. \"Excuse me?\" \"You're going all the way to Mars or something, right? I'm assuming that's why you need the air... You'll eventually have to take a whiz. It doesn't take a brain to figure that one out. Unless you want to hold it all the way... \" He brought out an old vacuum cleaner. \"Hey, maybe we could use this with a funnel or something, too, you know, make an actual toilet . Might make it less rank . Of course, you'll be ejecting air... \" \"You know how we can get metal?\" Lori asked. Being a smartass, he showed her an Iron Maiden LP. Lori actually looked angry . I think she thought he was lying about the supplies. \" Seriously? \" \"What. It's metal. \" She crossed her arms indignantly. \"Gee, lighten up!\" he groaned. \"I'll get you the aluminum, but the place is super busy right now. We'll have to wait until closing time.\" \"That sounds... sketchy. \" \"Hey, you want the supplies or not?...Now, since I've helped you and all, when do I get to see this invention of yours? \" Okay, so fair was fair. We took him to the cabin so we could get the equipment. Jimmy whistled. \"Nice place!\" I rolled my eyes. \"You're kidding.\" \"Hey, you saw mine... \" \"Thanks,\" I mumbled. When Jimmy showed up at the door, Dad was puzzled at seeing him in our company. \"Wait, isn't he the kid who beat you up at school?\" \"Um,\" I stammered. He frowned. \"Yeah! That's the same boy! What's he doing here/\" \"He's forgiven me,\" Jimmy said. 'He's a better man than I am.\" \"Better man!\" Dad chuckled, shaking his head in belief. \"Okay!\" Dad asked some probing questions, but Jimmy kind of talked his way around the facts so we didn't get in trouble, distracting him with a conversation about his 49ers shirt, so we didn't get in trouble. \"I thought you said you had rocket fuel,\" Jimmy said as he stared at the equipment we had set up in the woods. \"I just said that because I didn't trust you,\" I muttered. \"This is better than any rocket fuel you could make.\" I know, it wasn't the smartest thing to do, but I volunteered to be the next guinea pig, you know, because Gertie had been such a sport about it. The problem was that Jimmy started playing with the computer when Lori was attempting to maneuver me safely through the trees. I ended up slamming against objects. Jimmy thought it was hilarious, but I didn't laugh about it until I was out of the bubble with my gas mask off. When my legs stopped shaking, and I noticed I hadn't felt a single one of those violent impacts, I actually giggled. \"That... was... kinda fun!\" It seemed my brother had gotten home early from work, for while I had been flying around hitting objects, I noticed Gertie leading him down to the site, and I had an audience. Michael hadn't been too wild about what Jimmy was doing either. \"Hey, don't do that, you'll kill him!\" I heard him saying more than once. Not wanting to get grounded, we took a break from our experiments and went home for homework and supper. Of course, we still wanted those supplies, so we also promised Jimmy we'd sneak out in the dead of night to do `equipment shopping.' I was familiar with the junkyard. There were only two in town, and I and Dad dropped by at odd times to get parts for projects. What I wasn't familiar with was sneaking up the back with the barking dog. \"This seems kinda illegal,\" I said as we climbed the fence. \"Shut up!\" Jimmy hissed. \"You want the equipment or not!\" A big headed pit bull came out from behind a trash can and barked at us. Jimmy gave it a hamburger laced with sleeping pills. Jimmy did find us some interesting scrap, construction materials, metal chairs...I asked about car parts, but he suddenly gained a conscience when I tried to take a hood or a fender. We hefted quite a few items over the fence. The best piece we found was an old Tilt-A-Whirl car. Jimmy said it had been sitting in the junk pile gathering rust since the State Fair ten years ago. Apparently it was broken and unsafe to put back in a ride, and nobody wanted to buy it. He heard they'd called an electronic billboard service and tried posting an ad, but nobody seemed to want it there either. The shipping costs were too high. \"It sounds like you were actually trying to sell the thing yourself,\" Lori remarked, but Jimmy only replied, \"Just help me with this thing, okay?\" The Tilt-A-Whirl car was too heavy. We had to push it along with its castor wheels and a dolly, which made huge amounts of noise. The dog woke up, went on a barking frenzy, and then a gnarled, weathered looking man in flannel and overalls came rushing out of the office, yelling at us. \"James Francine Myers! Where in the hell are you going with that!\" \"Building a treehouse!\" Jimmy hollered back. \"It's two A.M. on a school night!... Not like anything like that's mattered to you before! \" \"You think I'm actually going to go to bed with the chickens so I can learn a bunch of Con-Ag bullcrap? You're out of your mind!\" \"The Future Farmers ain't nothing to sniff at, boy! You think I want to be here selling junk? One of these days, you're going to look back at all this goofing off and ask yourself if it's worth it! By that time it'll be too late to do anything about it!\" \"Screw you, old man!\" \"What's that? You want some more belt action? I can give it to you!\" Lori stared at them. \"That's his dad?\" I frowned. \"I...I kinda thought I saw Jimmy hanging around here before...\" \"Why'd the dog get so upset?\" \"He teases it,\" Gertie said. The man rushed out and grabbed Jimmy by the scruff of the neck. \" What other shit did you steal from me this time? Fess up! \" \"Nothing!\" Jimmy stammered. \"Just the Tilt-A-Whirl! That's it! I swear!\" \"Don't lie to me, boy! What I hate more than anything else is a liar! I know you've been sneaking around my back! What else did you steal , you little punk?\" \"Hey, screw you! I ain't telling!\" The man's grip tightened. \"I'm fed up with all your disrespect and belligerence, you little cretin. Fed up to here! \" \"Hey! Let go!\" He didn't let go. He hit him with his belt, then beat the kid with his fists. Jimmy cried and screamed in pain. \"Keep yelling like that and someone's going to call Child Services on me. You want that? Huh?\" The man was talking through his teeth now. \"They'll take you away from me, send you to live with some fat greasy black mamadown in the ghetto! You want that, Jimmy? Huh? Do you! \" Jimmy shook his head violently. \"No sir!\" And so he let his father pound him. Me and Lori didn't know what to do. We just watched it happen. I mean, after what Jimmy did to me in school, I kinda felt he deserved it, and even the part of me that felt sorry for him didn't want to get involved in a family quarrel. His dad was trying to discipline him. It would be like Jimmy coming over and trying to stop my dad from spanking Gertie. If this was child abuse, who was I to step in and do anything about it? Deep down, Jimmy still presumably loved his father, right? Still, Gertie was crying. Actually, I think Gertie was the main reason why the beating stopped. \"You kids go home!\" the man yelled. \"And Jimmy, if I ever catch you sneaking around in my junkyard and taking things without asking again, you're going to wish I only beat you like I did today!\" Then, with a dismissive wave to our acquisition, he muttered, \"You can get that eyesore out of my junkyard. I'm not even sure it's good for melting.\" He picked up a whiskey bottle from a garden chair, stomping back into his office. Looking very sad and sympathetic, Gertie touched Jimmy and said, \" You're hurting... \" Her hand started glowing. Jimmy laughed. \"Hey! What...?\" A moment later, he was leaning into it, and looking a lot less miserable. In fact, the sight kind of reminded me of a cat stretched out in a sun beam. \" Woww ...that's amazing! Kid, you could put massage parlors out of business (Man, it's like he never even touched me)! \" I stared at my sister in disbelief, maybe some jealousy at the amount of power she still retained... And annoyance at the fact she'd gone out of her way to help my enemy. Gertie just looked at me like I were crazy. \"What.\" So...Jimmy's `old man' really did have no use for that Tilt-A-Whirl after all. We collected all the parts together and moved them to our testing site in the woods. As we approached our cabin from the rear to climb in the windows, we found Dad standing in our path with his arms crossed. \"You'd better have a good explanation for all of this.\" I just ran up to him and gave him a hug. \"Whoa!\" Dad laughed. \"What's this about?\" I fumbled for words. \"I...I'm glad to have a dad like you.\" He chortled through his nose. \" You trying to butter me up ? You must have gotten into some trouble...\" \"Jimmy's father is mean,\" Gertie blurted. Dad only sighed, rubbing my head. \"I changed my whole life on account of you kids,\" Dad scolded us when we got inside. \" I had to give up everything! Every damn day I live in fear of someone breaking in and taking you away from me.\" He glanced uncomfortably at the ceiling. \"Or abducting you. Did you seriously think I was dumb enough not to notice when my own children disappeared in the middle of the night?\" \"I'm sorry,\" I stammered. We more or less explained what we were doing sneaking around. He ordered us to bed. Lori stayed in Gertie's room all night, so Gertie had nothing to report to Dad. School time came before any of us were ready for it. \"Kids,\" Dad told us at breakfast. \"Today you're going to learn the importance of coffee.\" You know, because it's not something kids ordinarily drink. I and Lori didn't care for the taste, even with cream and sugar, but Gertie asked for a second cup. \"Whoa, there, squirt!\" Dad laughed. \"Give you too much of that stuff and your teacher is going to call me out of work from you bouncing off the walls!\" After eating in silence for a few moments, Dad looked at me and said, \"So you ran into Chuck.\" I shrugged. \"That's the guy's name?\" Dad nodded. \"Saw his kid once or twice down there. Funny I didn't put two and two together. Guess I got a lot on my mind. The guy's an alcoholic . I suppose you didn't go inside the main office to smell it on his breath. I think he sleeps up there so he can drink without his wife saying anything...you didn't see the mother at all?\" I shook my head. \"Funny. Maybe she's pulling double shifts somewhere. I know she does work at the bar...\" He cast Lori and accusatory look, making her shrink in her chair. \"What were you guys doing outside all night?\" Michael asked as he walked us to school. \"Dad was going crazy!\" We told him about our little adventure in the junkyard. \"We have supplies now!\" Gertie exclaimed with caffeinated jittery excitement. \"It's all in the forest at our special testing site! We can finally build our spaceship!\" \"All right, but don't let your school work suffer. Dad will kill me!...If you're still this excited about it after school, I might even drop by and see how I can help.\" He gave me a strange thoughtful look, but didn't say what it was about. \"Hey! Lori!\" Jimmy called when we approached the front steps of the school. Lori stared at him. I could tell she was a little annoyed, probably thought he was being extra friendly because of our great invention or something. \"Uh...hi?\" Jimmy cast me a sideways glance, then started stammering, red faced. \"Uh, hey. Um, you know, I've been thinking a lot...about you recently, and, well, you're really cool, I mean, you're a genius , you've got a great family, you kicked my butt the other day, because you're a badass , and the fact you've met an actual space alien is awesome...\" Lori rolled her eyes. \"Jimmy, what...\" He kept going. \"I... like how you look, you're really pretty . I... you wanna go out sometime? \" Lori's face turned a bright red. She shot me this look like I should have said all those nice things to her, but then told him, I'm sorry, I'm taken.\" Jimmy frowned. \"That's your cousin.\" \"Actually, he's not . He's my boyfriend . I ran away from home because of him, and we're both hiding from the authorities. That's why I pretended to be part of his family.\" \"You're kidding.\" Both I and Lori slowly shook our heads. \"So when were you going to tell me that?\" Lori shrugged. \"I didn't know you thought that way about me.\" Jimmy sighed. He looked crushed. \"Hey, we can still be friends, right?\" He wasn't too thrilled by that. \"Yeah...\" Then he scowled at me, looking jealous. \"See you at lunch.\" He marched into the building. I gave Lori a bashful smile. \"He's right. You are smart, and pretty, and...kick ass.\" She giggled. \"And you're still the most interesting boy I've ever met.\" In science class, I began to wish I had actually drank my coffee. I had my head on my desk before I knew what was happening. It was a good dream, too. Our spaceship had been completed, glistening, cherry red, it stood shiny and glistening in front of the classroom, the teacher praising me on what a great invention it was. I suddenly felt a hand on my shoulder. \" Mister Mueller ! What amino acids are required for biosynthesis in a human being?\" \"Uh...\" I stammered. \"Vitamin B?\" \"It's B5, Mr. Mueller. \" Mr. Sigler rolled his eyes. \"Okay, so you got the pantothenate.. .What are the other two?\" I frowned. \"I...I don't know.\" The teacher sighed. \"The correct answer is cysteine, pantothenate and adenosine triphosphate. Do your sleeping at home, Mr. Mueller. You're smart, but it's clear you're not quite at Nobel Laureate level just yet. I can help you if you just listen occasionally.\" He scowled at Lori. \" The same goes for you, Sleeping Beauty! \" Sigler leaned over the desk. \"Was there a late night monster movie on TV last night or something?\" I shook my head, then nodded when I realized how good an alibi it was. \"Could I have some coffee?\" My classmates tittered. \"I'm sorry, Mr. Mueller. This is not a cafe. If I gave you a cup, everyone would want one. If this continues to be a problem, perhaps you could bring along a thermos. \" I struggled to stay awake the best I could. At the end of class, I caught Lori at the door and quipped, \"See you later, Sleeping Beauty. \" She gave me a jab. \"Okay, Prince Sleepyhead. \" Throughout English and Social studies, I fought to keep awake, sitting straight in my chair, taking notes...It kinda worked, but when I re-read my handwriting, it looked like I'd scrawled something about Czar Nicholas being a blueberry. Lori's schedule had changed, so she didn't eat with me that day, she ate a half hour before me. I saw her leaving when I came in. At the cafeteria line, the cook stared at me when I asked for coffee, but she actually brought me a cup. The moment I sat down with my food, Jimmy put his backpack down on the table, unzipped it, and out fell a pair of car headlights. \" Thought you could use these . I mean, it's going to be dark sometime, right?\" I stared. \"Do you ever carry actual books in that bag?\" He snorted. \"What do I look like, a nerd?... Anyways, it turns out grandma does own a scuba tank. I just called her. And get this . She's actually glad to hear we're doing something with her O2. She says she breathes just fine on her own, `All they're doing is sitting around gathering dust.' I guess she tried to send them back once, but there was some problem and they never came to pick them up.\" I went on to class. Ms. Horne thought my fiction writing was hilarious. I guess it was, and probably wasn't that great, either. Since I hesitated to write about ET, I gave her fantasy stories that vaguely resembled my life, with a dragon . She commented that my \"Realistic piece\" she asked me to do, you know the one where you can't include any fantasy elements, was actually less believable than that one , because the mom and dad stayed together at the end. In the class after that, I found out the school had been given some new `toys', computers that gave educational tests about weather and rainforests and things, video painting programs, typing tutors that looked like video games, and a program you could use to control little machines made out of Legos. Neat stuff, but it didn't compare to my flying device. I quickly lost interest and found myself watching the clock. At last, school let out, and I was hurrying to meet with Lori and pick up my sister. \"Lori!\" I watched, with some chagrin, as Jimmy rushed up to my girlfriend, kissing her on the mouth. What followed was a surprise to all three of us. I saw something like a spark erupt from the point where their lips touched, and then Jimmy was on the ground, and there he lay for an entire minute. \"Oh my God!\" Lori cried, kneeling next to him. \"What just happened?\" Jimmy groaned and sat up, rubbing his head. \"Feels like I just grabbed hold of an electric fence! What did you do? \" \"Me!\" she cried indignantly. \" You're the one that was acting...\" she blushed. \" Disrespectful! \" I furrowed my brow. \"I saw a spark.\" Her blush deepened. \" That was not a spark! I...I was... just thinking about jellyfish and electric eels...and how nice it would be to have that kind of defense mechanism, and...\" She put a hand to her mouth in horror. \"I did that?\" The looks on me and Jimmy's faces answered the question. Jimmy's eyes bugged out. \"Gee, I'm glad I only tried to kiss you!\" She helped him to his feet. \"Next time, ask me first.\" He swallowed. \"Yes, ma'am.\" He did a double take. \"You mean you'd actually do it?\" I gave Lori an uncomfortable look, but she only shrugged. \"I don't know. You kinda started on the wrong foot. \" Despite the awkward social situation, we still had great enthusiasm for our little science project. We practically ran down to the clearing to make sure the equipment and everything was where we left it. I came to the crest of the hill and froze. Someone had beaten us there. It was a teenaged African American woman, curvy, but the plumpness was attractive - you could tell she took care of herself and exercised. She leaned over the Tilt-A-Whirl car, clad in overalls, protective face shield and gloves, welding on pieces of aluminum. Noticing us approaching, she shut off the torch, flipped back the welding mask. The young woman had aquiline features, dark, slicked back hair braided like cables. Overall, kind of attractive for someone way older than me. And she could weld! I stared with my mouth hanging open. \"Michael said you guys needed help.\" \"Hey!\" Jimmy shouted. \"That's our stuff! What's the big idea!\" \"Cook it,\" I said, marching up to the stranger. \" You're Michael's girlfriend, aren't you? \" The young woman's protruding beak-like lips curled in a smile. \"The name's Timmashay , little man!\" Jimmy gawked at her. \" That's your brother's girlfriend?\" Sensing a bit of disapproval in his tone, I just gave him a questioning look, like `What?' He raised his hands defensively, as if to say `No, no, it's cool!' Timmashay laughed. \"He hasn't told you yet, but sometimes brother comes home with a big smile on his face. Wonder what that's about! \" I examined her handiwork in dismay. In my absence, Timmashay had welded the pieces of aluminum scrap and parts of a Fiat shell to the Tilt-A-Whirl car. A ghastly 1970 puke green 850 Sports Coupe with rust spots. It looked really ugly, especially with the addition of the clothes drier doors we were using for side windows, and the chrome trash cans. She stared down her hooked nose at my disapproving expression. \"I skipped school to work on this for you kids. Say thank you. \" \"Thank you,\" I stammered. \"Some guy was selling a car for a hundred dollars. Drove for a block before it stalled . Folks looked at me like I was crazy when they saw me pushing it into the woods, but hey, it's my car. Don't even have to pay the insurance.\" She welded a door to the frame. \" Fix It Again Tony . That's what they say Fiat stands for.\" I scowled at the inelegant design. \"I had plans for what it was supposed to look like.\" Timmashay pulled a wad of folded papers out of her chest pocket. My drawings . \" These, you mean? Sorry, not happening . There's limits to my magic. You're going to be lucky if it's round! \" \"Could it have killed you to at least get a Spider?\" Jimmy complained. The young woman just glared at him. \"You get what you get, little boy.\" \"Why don't we just use the Fiat?\" he asked. \"It's got a frame and everything!\" Timmashay rolled her eyes, put her hands on her hips. \" What do I look like, Wonder Woman? I was lucky to get it near your little hiding spot! It was a workout just to get the parts down here!\" Besides, car engines and tires weigh a ton, and we don't need them, right?\" \"Right,\" I reluctantly muttered. \"We could cut the frame off and carry it down here,\" Lori suggested. \"Might add strength to the shell.\" \"Now that's thinking!\" Timmashay agreed. We all worked together on our little spaceship, grabbing parts from the Fiat, carrying them to the site, holding things in place as Timmashay welded. When Michael got off work, things sped up a little. Unfortunately, it soon got dark, and we were supposed to go home. \"We're so close!\" I moaned as I admired our handiwork. \"A couple more hours and we can actually get the thing in the air for a test run!\" \"Me and Timmashay will finish up,\" Mike said. \"I'm used to late nights. You guys get to bed.\" I gave him a questioning look. \"Hey, most of it's already put together. There really won't be much to do after this.\" \"No way!\" Jimmy cried. \"We're this close!\" My brother frowned, put his arm around his girlfriend. \"We got this.\" \"Yeah? Who's to say you and Timmy here won't just make out all night?\" Timmashay giggled. \"The thought had crossed my mind!\" \"Stop,\" Michael scolded. \"I mean, as much as I'd like to ...\" His girlfriend looked annoyed. \" I know. ..I've got to see this thing when it's actually working.\" \"Jimmy's probably not going to go home,\" I said. My brother sighed. \"Fine. I'll talk it over with dad.\" I opened my mouth to protest, but he just said, \" You know he's not going to let you just sneak out like you did last night. \" \"Just tell him we're building a treehouse, or working on a car.\" \"Tell him the truth!\" Gertie cried. Michael left us, and we worked some more. When he returned, he had a tray of sandwiches and a couple thermoses in his hands. \"Dad says you'd better be keeping up with your school work.\" We finished well after midnight. Our contraption turned out larger than we originally planned. I could see it maybe fitting three kids and two adults, if the adults didn't stand up, and they at close together. \"What should we call it?\" Lori asked me. \"I dunno. It's just a test model... Prototype One? \" \"That name sucks,\" Jimmy said. \"Let's call it... Thunder Road. \" We all stared at him. \"You know... like the Bruce Springsteen song? \" \"I like it,\" Gertie said. As we stared at our badly cobbled together vehicle, we debated painting the thing. \"It'll look pretty!\" Gertie said. I just scrunched my face. \"Don't be ridiculous. We don't even know if it'll hold together. The Wright Brothers never painted their projects, because they constantly had to throw stuff out and start over.\" \"Yeah,\" Mike grumbled. \"We've put enough work into it already!\" Gertie was tired, and pouty. She looked like she were going to cry. \" But I want it painted! You always treat me like such a baby!\" Lori hugged her and patted her back. \"C'mon, we can always paint it later when we know it works. Right now we need to test it out. We still don't know if it's going to hold together...Tell you what: How would you like to be the test pilot?\" Gertie gave me a nervous smile. \"Come with me.\" \"What about me?\" Jimmy asked. \"I want to go too.\" He provided the materials and the O2, so I thought he deserved a test drive. We'd done pretty well with the setup. Everything was sealed tight as a drum with caulking, tar and solder, we had a windshield, overhead lights for us to see the instruments and books, a fire extinguisher, heater, seats from the Fiat (not the most comfortable things-you couldn't stretch your legs-we'd basically welded them to the floor to give us extra room). The headlights worked, we even engineered an opening in the shield bubble and used the exhaust fan from the vacuum cleaner/prototype toilet to pump air into the cabin for our test flights - layers of coffee filters kept the dust out, we'd have to remove them later. The rear seat was a huge office chair that had lost its swivel base. The only thing we hadn't done was put the engine inside the vehicle. That particular item was too valuable to just slap down into any hastily assembled space raft. Our dashboard looked like an entertainment center with the TV missing. Lori literally had `Ground Control'. When she switched the machine on, our vehicle rattled and groaned, acting like it intended to shake apart, but the welds kept securely in place, and through the Italian made windshield I could see the ground recede beneath us. The Thunder Road rose higher, at level with the tops of trees. We giddily stared down at our controller, cheering and giving her the thumbs up. A moment later, Dad came stomping into the clearing. He looked up and just froze, staring open mouthed at us for an entire minute. \"Mother Mary and Joseph.\" The awe and mystery only distracted Dad for a moment. He was soon looking over his shoulder like a frightened rabbit, rushing to our control station. \"Shut it down! Get them back here and turn it off now!\" Lori's hands rushed across the controls, but I guess she wasn't moving fast enough, for then Dad was unplugging the power supply. I, my sister and Jimmy screamed as our ship came hurtling back towards the earth. I reflected, while the ground rushed up to us, that it might have been a good idea to install some sort of airbag or crash protection system. Of course, these plans wouldn't mean very much if I ended up dead or in the hospital, especially if going to the hospital meant being taken away in a black van. Due to the way the craft had been designed, I couldn't see below me, only out the front. That probably wouldn't prevent the floor from breaking up and impaling me, or my bones from shattering on the hard ground. Jimmy mashed down the button on the walkie-talkie, yelling into the receiver. \"Lori! For God's sake, plug it back in!\" \"It's too late!\" she shouted back. \"We've lost your position!\" As an unconscious reflex, I tried to stall our descent by stomping the floor like Fred Flintstone. All of a sudden, everything did stop, and I experienced weightlessness. Noticing a glow, I stared at my sister. Her eyes had rolled back in her head, her hands illuminated like she had light bulbs under her skin. And then I noticed my own hands glowing. Blood trickled out my nose. A second later, gravity returned, and the Thunder Road thumped down on the soil as gently as Dorothy's house in The Wizard of Oz , walls and overall structure still whole and intact (Seriously, how does a tornado drop your house without smashing it and you in the process?). Gertie fainted. Dad yelled at us the moment the ship's car doors came open. \"Jesus! What are you, insane? Someone could have died flying around in this thing! I almost had a heart attack!\" \"What were you doing unplugging it, you ass!\" Jimmy yelled. \" You're the reason why we almost died!\" Dad's face turned scarlet. I could tell he knew Jimmy was right, he was just too angry to admit it. \"Get your butts out of that death trap right now! I'm grounding you from science for the next week!...And this thing is going to the scrap yard where it belongs!\" \"Over my dead body!\" Timmashay yelled behind him. \"Do you know how long I've been busting my ass on this thing?\" 'She's right, dad,\" Michael said. \"We've worked some long hours on this.\" Dad sighed through his nose, leaned on the door frame. And that's when he took a closer look at my sister. \"Oh my God! What's wrong with Gertie!\" We quickly carried her out of the vehicle, laying her on the ground to get a better look. Dad shined a flashlight up and down her, checking for injuries. \"What happened, tyke?\" Gertie groaned, wiping her bloody nose. \"I got scared and had to do something. I felt power go out of me, then I got really sleepy. I'm sorry I scared you. I wanna go to bed.\" Smiling tenderly, Dad hefted her into his arms. \"We don't have to fly to his planet,\" my sister mumbled to me. \"There's some of his friends close by.\" \"How close?\" I asked, but by then she wouldn't wake up for anything. She sure looked happy, though. \"I wonder what she meant by that,\" Lori said. \"I mean, if they're just up there, hanging out, we could hitch a ride... \" \"Yeah!\" I stared at her, excitement rising in my voice. \"They could have the supplies we need and everything!\" Dad sighed. \"Are you really that eager to ditch your old man?\"[Chapter 14] \"Dad,\" I said. \"We don't have to leave you. I mean, there's room in the Thunder Road...\" He chuckled. \" Bruce Springsteen... \" \"Yeah. The point is, you could come with us.\" \"In that bucket of bolts? You have got to be kidding!\" \"Then you're leaving us, because I offered.\" Dad frowned. \"I'll think about it.\" After pulling an all nighter like that, we all had to dose ourselves with caffeine when we got up, even if we didn't care for the taste. Dad put his hand on my sister's forehead, checking her temperature. \"You okay, sweetie?\" She nodded. \"Um hum.\" \"Last night you passed out. Had a nosebleed.\" \"It's okay. I was just making things float, and it made me tired.\" He still looked worried, but gave her a slight smile. I could tell Dad wanted to say something to us, but it took awhile before it actually came out. \"I...may have overreacted last night.\" I gave him a look that said, `Gee, you think?' But kept quiet, eating my cereal. \"You see, I was afraid that someone would see you, maybe report their little UFO sighting to the authorities. He kind of pissed me off saying it, but your friend was right. I put you all in danger trying to shut down your little machine...and I'm sorry. This is all to say you're not grounded . And I'll let you keep your... flying thing .\" Me, Lori and Gertie grinned at each other. \"That being said, there's going to be some rules . I don't want you flying that thing where anyone can see it. Keep the lights off, stay in the forest, below the treeline, away from houses, and fly only at night. Actually, the next thing you take the thing out, I want to supervise the operation. Got me? From now on, no unauthorized flights.\" \"Yes sir,\" I said. Lori and Gertie also agreed to the terms. He frowned. \"Elliott, Lori, you sure you can trust this... Jimmy kid with your little project?\" \"Gertie trusts him,\" I sighed. \"She has a good sense for these things.\" \"I feel bad for him,\" Lori said. \"I think he fights people because he has it rough at home.\" \"How did he get involved with you guys anyway?\" Lori gave me an uncomfortable look. \"Apparently there's some truth to the tabloids, and Jimmy reads them.\" Dad looked unsettled, but said nothing more on the subject. \"Daddy,\" Gertie said. \"You saw the spaceship last night. You've got to believe I'm an astronaut now. I actually did fly a couple days ago. It wasn't just pretend. You believe me now, don't you, daddy? \" He sighed. \"Sweetie, I know you're excited, but what you're doing is very dangerous.\" \"That's why we're testing it. We tried it on Mister Squirrel, then me without the...thing...\" Dad stared at me in horror. \" You flew your sister around with that toy? Without even a damn parachute? \" I shrugged. \" She begged me . She was about to cry.\" \"And you just let her .\" Dad clenched his fists. \" Elliott, you've got to start learning how to do what's best for kids younger than yourself. One of these days you're going to be a parent, and you'll need to occasionally say no or they'll do something and hurt themselves . Thank God nothing happened!\" I and Lori looked at each other in discomfort. He got up from the table, staring out the window. After some slow breathing exercises, he returned to his seat, rubbing his red face in frustration. \"I really should ground you for putting your sister in danger, but I won't because I did the same damn thing trying to stop you.\" Gertie made the same suggestion I made to him last night. \"Daddy, you should come to Jufuceri with us. You only have to sit in the Thunder Road a few hours and we'll meet ET's friends. They could have a better spaceship, and stuff we need for a long space trip.\" Dad gave her a sad look. \"Sugar, you're safe here. With me .\" Gertie frowned. \"No, Daddy, we're hiding .\" \"We talked about this, baby doll. Daddy's going to save up and drive us all to Mexico. \" Lori gave me a questioning look. He had mentioned this briefly in passing, but I hadn't taken it seriously at the time. \"But you said you're the only one bringing in a good paycheck!\" Gertie protested. \" You said without Ruby... \" Michael looked hurt by this comment, but didn't argue. \"I know, I know...\" Dad groaned. \"We don't have any idea if we're going to see Ruby or Mommy again, and there's bad men trying to find us! With ET it's going to be safe! Please say you'll come with us!\" \"Honey, remember when we watched Planet of the Apes and we saw that man get captured by a bunch of talking monkeys? That could be us!\" \"So you'd rather have the army capture us?\" \"I didn't say that.\" \"ET's our best bet,\" I said. \"Last night you asked if I were trying to get rid of you. We're not. But we're going to do this with or without you.\" Tears rolled down Gertie's cheeks. \"If you say no, you're the one that'll be leaving us! I don't ant you to stay behind, daddy. Please say you'll come!\" Dad swallowed. \"Well...If me going into space to meet your moon man really means that much to you, I guess I could handle sitting in your tin can for a few hours... \" \"Yay!\" She brightened, throwing her arms around him. \"What does Michael think about all this?\" My brother sighed, rubbed his bloodshot eyes. \"Let me wake up a little more and we'll talk.\" We left for school. \"I...don't know,\" Michael said as we reached the end of the block en route to school. \"I...I mean, yeah, I'm going to miss you guys, but...\" Gertie frowned. \" You're going to miss Timmashay too. \" He reddened. \"Yeah. And she has a family. \" \"What if they capture you?\" I asked. \" I never touched ET. Have you ever seen me glow or do the crazy things you can? \" \"Well, no...\" \"So I'll, what, end up in a cell for awhile. I don't see why they'd hold me for anything.\" Gertie acted like she were about to cry again. \" So you're just going to leave us? \" \"Gertie ...I'm almost an adult. I can make my own decisions, and, well, I really love Timmashay . I'm thinking maybe when we graduate, we can move somewhere, find some better jobs... \" Gertie stopped in her tracks and started sobbing. Michael reddened. \"Hey! Stop with the waterworks! Look, when mom and dad had us, they moved away from their folks and started their own family. It was sad, but you know, that's how families work.\" Gertie stared. \" You're going to have a baby? \" My brother's face turned a deeper shade of red. \"No! I was just trying to explain... \" She sighed, wiped her eyes. \"You're right. If you have a baby, she'll want to have a daddy...Still, it would be nice if you and her came along...\" \"Yeah? For how long?\" \"I dunno, forever?\" Michael laughed. \"No way. One close encounter is enough for me for a lifetime! Besides, I haven't even begun to see all there is to this planet. That road trip we had was the closest thing we had to seeing the world in a long time!\" When we arrived at school, I saw Jimmy bashfully waving to my girlfriend, and when he approached, he started telling her how nice she looked, kind of laying it on thick, complimenting her on her clothing (\"These cheap things?\") and hair (\"I only washed it,\" she said). He swallowed, mumbling an apology for the other day. The moment he started to ask, she kissed him on the mouth. I didn't see Jimmy glow, except maybe on the inside. Maybe they did later, but I couldn't stand to watch any more. \"I guess we really are cousins now,\" I snarled, stomping into the building. In science, I did okay. I paid attention like I was supposed to, answered the teacher's questions when I was called. The coffee worked, and plus I (ahem) didn't have anyone like Lori to distract me. At the end of class, Lori came up to me, looking apologetic, but as she fumbled for words, I could tell she wasn't sorry, she just wanted to keep her options open. \"Elliott...I...\" Before she could complete the thought, I said, \"Are you going to stay with him, or are we bringing him along? He has a family, you know. \" \"Elliott, you've got a family. \" \"Yeah, but he's normal. I mean, sure, he's got an abusive dad, but that's not an excuse to leave the earth forever. It's not like he glows in the dark! \" She choked down a sob, rushing out the door. How do you comfort someone in a situation like that? I had kept awake in science, but my performance in gym was less than stellar. That was okay, but I doubted anyone would pick me for basketball again. At lunch, Jimmy plopped down at my table like I wanted him there. \"I was just talking with Lori... who said you could kick me out? \" He looked like he wanted to pound me, but I figured him beating me up would actually work in my favor. \"I dunno, your mom? Your family? People that would care if you disappeared into space forever?\" \"What about you, jerk? Don't tell me you were born in a test tube!\" \"I literally can't go back home. What's your excuse?\" He grabbed me by the collar, balling his fist. \"Go ahead,\" I said. \"I'd like you to explain it to Lori.\" Jimmy let go, and then, shockingly, sniffed and started wiping tears from his eyes. \"That's not fair!... What about you? How will you live all alone like that?\" I stared sadly at the table. \"I don't have a choice...You think I want to never see mom and the rest of my family again?\" He was still trying to be tough, wiping his eyes. \"So when are you leaving?\" \"Um...I don't know...when the Thunder Road looks safe enough to travel. Gertie said...our alien has friends waiting somewhere, but I don't know where they are...I don't exactly want to wait for the black vans to start showing up.\" \"I still want to help,\" he said. \"What we're doing is cool... and important.\" The bell rang, and we left for our next hour classes. In English, Ms. Horne had us read Macbeth , we studied something called gerunds, worked on grammar exercises. I didn't get the computer class after that because they decided it should be a reward for straight A students, so I went on to French. I was dreading my next meeting with Lori... and Jimmy , so I took my time leaving school that day. I found the two sitting on the front steps, talking to each other. I walked up to them and just stared. Looking pained, Lori said, \"Elliott, I... we've been talking.. .And, well, your dad seems to be the only one who knows that I've been glowing, and even he wouldn't have said anything if I hadn't told him. I think if the authorities did capture me, they wouldn't know any better. They might even let me go. Especially if I tell the right story. \" I paled. \"What are you trying to say?\" Lori frowned at me. \"Elliott, I...I'm not going.\" I tried to keep the emotion out of my voice, but it didn't work. You could still kinda tell I was upset. \" Because of him, right? \" \"Well, I mean, I can't just leave my family, Elliott. I'm not like you. I can go back. \" What could I really say to that? I glanced at her, and Jimmy, and my eyes just started watering. Wiping my eyes, I turned away, to get my sister from the playground. I found Gertie snoozing on a swing set. When approached, she rubbed her eyes and said, \"The teacher has been asking why I've been lying down in class. She asked if I was sick, but I said no, I told her I was up late building a spaceship with my brother.\" I stared. \"Did she believe you?\" Gertie shrugged. \"She asked me if it were Star Trek or Battlestar Galactica . She said she made a model of a Dalek and a TARDIS from Doctor Who using a technical manual once.\" She must have noticed my facial expression or something, for then she asked, \"What's wrong, Elliott? You look sad!\" \"Lori doesn't want to come with us.\" Gertie looked puzzled. \"Why not?\" And then, \"Why are you crying?... Ohh. \" She gave me a hug. \"Elliott, it's not about her. It's about ET.\" \"No, Gertie,\" I said. \" It's about family. \" \"Guys,\" Jimmy called to us. \"You want to put some finishing touches on our project? I know where we can find some red paint... \" Jimmy found us some pretty good house paint. It wasn't oil based, so it wouldn't catch fire in re-entry. Gertie was so excited about the idea that she nearly painted the windows so we couldn't see out. Since she was having so much fun with that, I, Jimmy and Lori took care of more important details. We stocked the ship with as many helpful items as we could, food, bottled water, some hardy plants, plus the O2 Jimmy had brought us the other day. I didn't want to think about the `Depend-O's, but he had brought those too. I also added my little liquid oxygen farm to the machine (algae), to lessen tank usage later on. My sister had come close to covering one entire side of the thing before Jimmy cried, \"Oh God! I forgot the asbestos shingles!\" I remembered they had torn out the ceiling in entire sections of my school due to that stuff. \"I thought asbestos gave you cancer.\" \"It's fireproof, dummy! NASA puts it on their shuttles!\" \"Jimmy, they don't use housing shingles,\" Lori said. \"So what? Asbestos is asbestos, right? It's not like we can find a spray !\" He glanced at my sister. \"Hold off on the painting, little girl.\" Lori dug in her bag, bringing out Gertie's stuffed toys. My sister stared in amazement. \"How did you-?\" \"Magic.\" Gertie pouted. \"But how! I wanna know!\" \"I saw your mom, okay! I've been keeping this stuff for a long time, but I didn't want your dad to see it because I knew he'd find out about me.\" Noticing her questioning look, Lori added, \"The last time I saw her, she was fine. The government people let me see her because they thought I didn't know anything, okay?\" Gertie hugged her. \"Thank you.\" Jimmy left the clearing. I'm guessing Lori would have left with him, but I needed her help to install the computer inside the vehicle, and Jimmy said he'd only be a minute. We didn't talk for awhile. Lori plugged in some wires. \"Elliott...\" \"Stop,\" I said. \"I don't want to hear it.\" I thought Gertie had been napping in the back seat, but it turned out she was eavesdropping. \"That's what mommy said to daddy before they divorced. I think, if they actually talked... \" My face flushed red. \" Gertie, this is none of your business.\" \"They said that too. You gonna start throwing things?\" My stomach did a flip-flop. \"Gertie! We're not even married!\" Lori giggled. \"Maybe not, but she's right. It doesn't hurt to listen.\" I sighed. \"Fine. What do you want to say? That Jimmy's a great guy?\" \"That's just it. You're both great guys... That's what makes this so difficult. Elliott, I love you...but you can't ask me to give up my family. I mean, if you could go back to your mom and everything, wouldn't you feel the same way?\" I reluctantly nodded. I think she was getting up to hug me or something, but the moment she came close, we heard a commotion outside, kids laughing and shouting. I looked out the windshield and saw, to my dismay, that Jimmy had brought his buddies to our secret lair. Jimmy rode a bicycle, a cart full of shingles and assorted junk hooked up to the back end. His two friends lugged cardboard boxes. \"Try to keep up, you guys!\" he called. \"We're almost there!\" \"Easy for you to say!\" called his friend, tall, gangly and freckled. \"You're the one with the bike!\" Dirt and gravel crackled against Jimmy's tires as he rolled down to where we were, squeezing the brakes. \"That's your spaceship?\" Mocked a dark haired boy in a ripped sleeveless denim jacket. \"How's that going to fly? It looks like crap!\" \"It looks like someone's crummy Honda Civic.\" \"Fix It Again Tony,\" Freckles corrected. \"Whatever. It's not going to fly.\" Jimmy scowled at him. \"What did I say, Kevin? I'll prove it to you! Just help us with these shingles.\" \"This had better not be some stupid art project.\" \"Does it look like an art project?\" \"Yeah. It does. A crappy one.\" \"Well it's not. The shingles are supposed to help us against the heat.\" \"They, isn't ass-sept-toes that stuff that gives you cancer?\" \"It's also used by NASA on space shuttles.\" Kevin put a hand to his breast. \" Wow. They sacrifice so much! \" \"It sure doesn't look like NASA,\" said the dark haired boy. Bruce, I presumed by elimination. \"Screw you! NASA has millions of dollars to work with. We only had a hundred. This is what a hundred looks like. Help me with the shingles.\" I rushed outside the Thunder Road, staring at the newcomers. \"Jimmy, you can't-\" \"Relax!\" he said. \" I told them the situation. Nobody wants you to get taken away to be dissected. They just want to see the ship in action.\" I sighed. \"Okay, fine. I hope you're right.\" The task of attaching the shingles wasn't as easy as we thought. We tried hammering, but the shingles were brittle if you struck them in the wrong spot, tended to shatter, and we were nailing into metal. We ended up using an electric screwdriver from Jimmy's house, regular screwdrivers, and hammering in small carpentry nails. Jimmy had a nail gun, but the nails didn't have any heads, so the shingles slid right off after you drove one in. Maybe we didn't know how to use it, I don't know. It was also kind of tricky getting the shingles on the underside. We tried floating the vehicle up, but of course the energy forcefield kept us from doing any sort of damage to the shell while it was on. We ended up parking it on cinder blocks, then rolling it slightly to the side to get the parts we missed. Of course, it still wasn't great because when we set it down, I could hear the shingles crunching like corn flakes. \"Give it up,\" said Kevin. \"This thing is just going to have to burn up in re-entry.\" Jimmy didn't disagree. \" Anyways. ..you guys believe me now, right? You saw it fly. \" Kevin nodded, but Bruce said, \"I don't know. I've seen hovercrafts doing that much on TV. You know they got them in Europe... \" When Jimmy looked at me, I could guess what he wanted before he asked. \"Not until it's dark. I'll take it up in the air, but we're not crossing the treeline or going out of the woods. Not until dad gets here.\" Jimmy's friends looked disappointed, but they agreed to the terms. We helped Gertie paint the shingles, but Jimmy and his friends didn't want to wait for it to dry. They wanted their test flight. When Jimmy boarded the Thunder Road, he brought along a BB gun and an echo mike thing he'd removed from a Snake Mountain Playset. \"Wait,\" I protested. \"What's that for?\" He added a flare gun and a pellet gun to the arsenal. \"Hey, what if you go to that planet and some wild...Bantha attacks you? You should at least have some protection!\" He brought in his microphone and speaker system with a car battery. \"And what's that doing?\" \"Um, long range communication? \" \"Sound doesn't travel in space. It needs air as a conductor.\" Jimmy only looked annoyed. \"Okay, at least I understand why you brought it. What's with the toy?\" Jimmy pressed the echo mike up to the microphone of his speaker system, switched on the power. \"You dare question Skeletor!\" So I floated his buddies up in the air. The next thing he said was, \"Take us to the State Fairgrounds!\" \"No,\" I said. \"I thought you weren't interested in the FFA.\" \"I'm not. I just want to scare the cattle.\" I gave Lori a questioning look. \"It's daylight,\" she said. \"Someone will see us.\" \"Yeah? Like who? A hillbilly farmer? They talk about UFO's all the time! C'mon, it's right on the other side of the woods.\" Of course, Jimmy wasn't satisfied with a mere fly over, he wanted to take over the controls. Seeing as we had a protective bubble, I reluctantly let him fly us low, causing a stampede and frightening a poor farmer out of his wits. I was glad the State Fair had yet to start for the year. It was just one herd. We eventually did return to the clearing, but not until we'd destroyed part of someone's barn and scared a bunch of horses on a nearby farm property. To my great relief, neither Dad nor my brother had returned home yet. The moment we stepped out, I thought I heard someone, but Jimmy said the rustling I'd heard in the bushes was only a rabbit, and maybe some other wild animals. We set about giving the shingles we'd attached to the shell a second coat, trying our best to look innocent when Dad showed up. By that time, of course, Jimmy told his buddies to scram, since he guessed how Dad would react to so many kids knowing our secret. \"That's...interesting, he commented when he saw what we did to the exterior. \"You sure that paint's not flammable?\" As promised, Dad did let us do some more test flying when it got dark, he and Michael supervising the operation. We kept below the treeline and out of sight of houses... at first . \"You're doing great!\" Dad radioed to us. \"I admit I was skeptical at first, but you guys really pulled it off!...Now set her down. Don't forget you have school tomorrow.\" \"No way!\" Jimmy cried. \" We got a friggin' spaceship! Let's do something cool with it! \" Of course he didn't radio that to Dad. \"I don't know...\" Lori said. \"I am kinda tired...\" \"What, are you guys chicken? This is your big chance to play around with this thing! Did Enzo Ferrari build a car just to drive up to the corner grocery store to buy milk? No, he's a race car driver.\" I rolled my eyes. \"Jimmy, I'm not a race car driver.\" \"So? Ferruccio Lamborghini used to be a grape farmer.\" \"What,\" I said. \"You got a subscription to all the car magazines or something?\" \"They're more interesting than all those plant books you read!\" I looked Lori in the eyes, wondering what she thought. \"Oh c'mon, Elliott! It's dark. What harm could it do?... This may be your last chance to... enjoy the earth, you know, before you leave it forever. \" I swallowed. \"Okay, but be careful.\" Dad yelled into the walkie-talkie as the Thunder Road darted out of the woods. Mike was yelling too, warning us this was a bad idea. Jimmy's buddies, it turned out, hadn't gone home, so he swung by and picked them up. Our radio got out of range and we heard no more warnings from the radio. At first, it was just a scenic joyride. We buzzed over the town, admiring the lights, zoomed over the vineyards, hovered over the river and quaint buildings on the high cliffs along its shores. \"It's times like these I wish we had a beach,\" Kevin complained. \"We could see all the chicks in swimsuits.\" \"It's night. You wouldn't see much anyway.\" Jimmy did the `next best thing', flying us along the upper portion of a hotel, where people left their curtains open. When the people saw they had an audience, they yelled and closed the drapes. I had to cover Gertie's eyes a few times. There were quite a few times that I yelled too, wishing I could un-see what I just saw. In fact, one really ugly lady even gave us a little show. The next thing I knew, we were flying over the junk yard Jimmy's father owned. Jimmy lowered the Thunder Road at level with the rustbucket exterior of the main office trailer, switching on the high beams. He opened a drier door, firing a flare and the BB gun at the trailer's window. He lit smoke bombs, dropped them over the side. \"Jimmy!\" I hissed. \"What-\" But Jimmy was already switching on the microphone system. \"Charles Allen Myers! Come out of that trailer this instant!\" I heard indistinct yelling from inside. Jimmy tried again. \"Charles Allen Myers! Get your butt out here! I command it! \" The front door cracked open. \"Yeah? You and what army?\" Jimmy fired a flare at the trailer, right next to the door. \"The Lords of Cobol!\" I admit, it did seem fairly impressive. Charles came outside with a rifle in hand. \"What the hell do you-\" He looked up at our vehicle, staring in disbelief. Gertie didn't know what was going on. I kept waving for her to stay in the back so nobody could see her. Jimmy leaned out the drier door, shining a flashlight in the man's eyes. \"Kneel before the Lords of Cobol, so we may have mercy on you and spare your sorry excuse for a life!\" Mr. Myers raised the gun. \"Oh shit!\" I cried. We braced ourselves, but the bullet cracked harmlessly off our ship's protective bubble. \"You dare attack us with your puny earth weapons?\" Jimmy mocked, his buddies keeping the flashlight shining in the man's face. \"Drop the rifle now or we will vaporize you with our photon torpedoes!\" Trembling, Charles obeyed, shakily dropping to his knees. \"Please... Cobol Lords ! I have a son! Do not kill me!\" I'm assuming this wouldn't have worked if the man weren't already drunk. \"You dare use your own offspring as a bargaining chip? You don't care about him, you filthy drunk! You only care about yourself!\" The man wrinkled his brow, as if gaining suspicions about his so-called ` Lords. ' \"What?\" \"You drink alcohol and beat him!\" Jimmy shouted into the microphone. \"Tell us why we should spare you... or your son! \" \"Please Lords!\" The man had his hands folded and raised, as if in prayer. \"I'll do better! I'll change my ways! I promise!\" Dropping the charade, Jimmy set aside the microphone, yelling out the door. \"You're full of crap, old man! Take this!\" He shot his father with the pellet gun, threw eggs at him. \"You little bastard!\" the man yelled, shaking his fist at him. \"I'll make you and your alien friends pay for this!\" Jimmy and his buddies burst out laughing. Mr. Myers hurled a beer bottle at us, but it just shattered on the ground. \"You gotta admit,\" Jimmy said with a grin. \" That was fun... Let's go to the drive-in.\" Thunder rumbled ominously in the distance, as if in response. \"We should go back,\" I said. \"I think we've caused enough trouble.\" \"C'mon, Elliott! Don't be a pussy! It's just the drive-in! \" I rushed to the controls, to steer us back to the woods, but Jimmy just grabbed me, pulling me away from the keyboard. When he started pressing buttons, I gave him a shove, and he hit me. We traded blows for a moment. Outside, the storm brewed, as if reacting to our inner turmoil. \"Boys!\" Lori scolded. \"Stop! Elliott, he's right, it's just the drive-in!\" \"It's always `just' something!\" I cried. \"We need to go back! He'll ruin everything!\" She frowned. Jimmy's buddies held me down in the chair. I could only watch helplessly as we flew off to Screenland 14. It wasn't the weekend, so the place wasn't packed as I thought it would be. Still, I did see a number of cars there. They had a promotion where you could watch a bunch of scifi films real cheap. Kevin snickered when he saw Star Wars showing on their big screen. \"Hey guys. I got an idea.\" He whipped our vehicle around a fence, and then, when it got to the part of the film where the Imperial Star Destroyer was chasing after a rebel spaceship, he slowly brought the Thunder Road out above the audience, making the sounds of the Imperial March into the microphone. \"Hey, what's that?\" I heard someone at the snack bar say. Someone else said, \"It kinda looks like...a Fiat. \" \"I didn't know Fiat made spaceships!\" The fun ended when Kevin collided with the movie screen. I guess, while the large white backdrop had withstood the wind and weather and so forth, it hadn't been designed to handle vehicular impact. The moment we ran into it, the rear supports bent and snapped, the whole thing toppled over with a loud crash. \"Holy shit!\" Jimmy cried, half laughing. \"Did we just do that?\" \"What the hell is that thing?\" someone shouted. \"We're being invaded!\" a woman cried. \"I want my money back!\" Another person clapped. \"Hey, this is great! Screw the film! Encore!\" I glared at Jimmy, angered at how much I'd let him get away with. \"Great. Now you've done it!\" \"We really should leave now.\" Lori pointed down. \"Look! That security guard is already calling backup!\" \"You don't have to tell me twice!\" Jimmy hurriedly rushed us away from there, returning us to the woods. ...A different part of the woods than we normally used for flight tests. He shut off the lights and landed. \"Uh...Jimmy?\" I stammered. \"Trust me, it's better this way.\" Once out, Jimmy started grabbing brush and leaves, throwing them over our vehicle. \"C'mon, help me with this stuff, will ya?\" And we all started adding debris to the camouflage. After we'd done that, Jimmy marched off down a hill. I hustled after him. \"Do you even know where we are? Or if there's any wild animals, or something else dangerous?\" He laughed. \"The only thing you're in danger of out here is tripping over a rock!\" He was basically correct. Bruce reported a snake, but it slithered away, a bobcat appeared but ran off, and owls just make a lot of noise. The scariest thing that happened was Dad yelling at us. Jimmy's friends made themselves scarce. When we entered the clearing, the first words out of Dad's mouth were, \"Where is the thing? It's got to be dismantled!\" We didn't respond quickly enough, I guess, for then he shouted, \"Now! Where'd you park it?\" I began to offer an excuse, but Jimmy spoke first. \"I ain't telling you shit, old man.\" Dad glared at him, clenching his fists. \"I don't think I heard you correctly. What's that again?\" \"I said go to hell.\" \"Kid, I don't know who you think you are, or who you think I am, but your reckless actions have put my family in jeopardy, and I don't take that kind of thing lightly.\" Jimmy reddened. \"How do you know it was me? How did you know we did anything?\" \"Doesn't matter,\" Dad said, though I noticed a pair of binoculars on the ground. \"You're going to show me where you parked that thing, and you're going to dismantle it before the authorities start showing up.\" \"Or what?\" Jimmy challenged. \"You'll beat on me like my dad?\" For a moment, Dad looked at him like he'd do just that, but then he just sighed through his nose and said, \"Ever since my pappy died, I swore not to strike a child, but you're pushing it, kid.\" Jimmy only looked smug., causing Dad's anger to boil over. \"You selfish boy! You think you're pretty clever don't you? Think you got it all figured out, as long as you personally aren't affected, you don't care who you hurt! Well I got news for you. I heard what they said on the police scanner. If your little excursion gets us any unwanted attention, your little friends are going away for a long time, and if the people after us catch wind of your involvement, you're going down with us. In fact, I'll personally see to it that they believe you have a third eye, and your ass glows in the dark. Get a nice padded cell in a military compound , with options open for exploratory surgery.\" Jimmy kept scratching his wrists and hands. I think he had picked up some poison ivy. \"You wouldn't! I'm a kid!\" \"And I'm a father with two sons and a daughter . Make no mistake, kid. Just because I don't work you over with my fists doesn't mean I'm your personal doormat.\" \"Whatever. I'm still not letting you destroy the Thunder Road.\" Dad frowned at Lori. \"Where did you put it? Don't make me put you out of doors!\" She swallowed. \"I dunno. It's dark . I wouldn't know where to begin looking.\" Gertie started crying, blubbering all kinds of reasons why we needed the ship. \"Oh Jesus,\" Dad groaned. \"Where is your mother when I need her? If she were here, you wouldn't be pulling the old waterworks routine. She never fell for it. Nearly had me buying a pony that one time. Not her. \" The anger left him. \"All right, you can keep your little flying machine. The sad thing is, we may actually need it to get out of town. Pray to God it won't play out like that, but...\" Dad sent Jimmy home. Due to the circumstances, I, Lori and Gertie ended up going to bed earlier than we had the previous nights, but Dad, being restless and fearful of the authorities, kept checking the windows and the radio to see if anyone had come after us. The following morning we found him asleep next to the police scanner. If Michael hadn't woken us up, we would have been late for school. The fact we had borrowed Dad's groceries did not go unnoticed, but he didn't complain when he was cooking us breakfast. Dad's fears weren't unjustified. During breakfast, a cop came knocking on our door. Dad told us to stay inside, but we peeked through the windows. The officer was old, heavy-set, and wore a ranger hat too small for his big head. I pressed my ear to the door to listen in. \"You seen anything...unusual in these woods lately?\" the man was asking. \"Uh, no officer,\" Dad said. \"Why, is there a problem?\" \"Well, I got some rumors about a hot air balloon or some fancy jet . Been causing some trouble in town.\" \"What kind of trouble?\" \"Oh, property damage for one, scared the piss out of the guy down at the scrap yard.. .Got him raving like a lunatic.\" He showed dad a painted shingle that had fallen off the Thunder Road. \"You know what this is?\" \"Looks like a house shingle. Why?\" \"It came off of the...balloon. Found it at the drive-in after it knocked over the screen. Seen any around here lately?\" \"No, can't say that I have...\" \"Let me know if you find any. Some higher-ups want to get to the bottom of this. We've been asking around, but haven't gotten any good leads yet...You'll let me know if you find anything, won't you?\" \"You got it, officer.\" At last the cop waddled back to his car and drove off. The moment the man was gone, Dad rushed back into the house and slammed the door shut, his face pale and drawn. \"C'mon, kids. Pack your things. We're going.\" \"What?\" I cried. \"We're going. Thanks to your little science project, we've outstayed our welcome.\" \"Wait,\" Michael said. \"Won't it look weird if we suddenly start packing up everything after the police showed up?\" Dad rubbed his face in frustration. \"All right. Get everything together so we can go when it gets dark. It's school as usual. I'll...guess I'll go to work. Try to at least slip a few necessities into the truck before we go, okay?\" And so we rushed through the cabin, packing our things, hiding the scientific paperwork, stuffing a few changes of clothing into the pickup. We ran out of time, hurrying down the street to school, sweaty, red face, flustered, imagining spies around every corner. \"Guys,\" Michael said. \"If for some reason we get separated, and I never see you again, I just want to let you know I...have always cared for you...And if I get captured by someone, maybe go to jail, I don't want you coming back for me...I...I can figure out things by myself. Just run, okay?\" Choked with emotion, none of us answered. \"I said okay! \" We reluctantly agreed. \"I love you too,\" Gertie said. I swallowed. \"Yeah, big brother. Me too.\" \"Remember. You see anything suspicious, anything that, you know, doesn't sit right with you , find an excuse to get the hell out of there. I'm sure they'll pull any trick they can to grab you.\" He frowned at Gertie. \"I don't like you being in that building alone right now, but it can't be helped. Maybe you could play sick and have Dad come pick you up.\" She gave him a reluctant nod. We didn't see Jimmy at the building. Instead, his friends came up to meet us. Lori asked where he was. \"The cops are after him,\" Kevin said. \"You know, because of what happened with the old man. You can probably understand why he might not want to come to school.\" When we walked into the building, we found people staring at us. Already a bad sign. No one said anything, so I had no clue what they know, or what they didn't . \"I didn't want to tell you,\" Kevin whispered behind us. \"But I saw some kids spying on us yesterday. One of them had a Polaroid. We tried to grab them, but they ran off.\" \"Act natural,\" Lori muttered. We had a test in science class. I barely got fifty percent of the answers right. Mr. Sigler sighed in disappointment when he handed the test back, not saying anything. I went to gym, had lunch. That was the last normal thing I would do for a long, long time. In the hallway outside, Kevin called to me and Lori, frantically gesturing to the window. \"Uh...guys?\" With my heart hammering, I rushed to where he stood, peering through the blinds. A black van with a radar dish on its roof had been parked along the school's front drive, men in Hazmat suits waving Geiger c counters around the building. \"We've got to get out of here,\" I hissed. Kevin pulled the fire alarm, hustling us down the hallway before anyone could pinpoint who'd pulled it. \"We should slip out the back,\" Lori said as we rushed to the stairs. \"Two kids sneaking out the back while the whole school goes out the front?\" said Kevin. \" They'll be expecting that! \" We tried to look normal, joining the herd of students as they filed their way out to the front lawn. We had teachers watching us, making sure no students slipped away from the property. The men in ABC gear stared at all the kids, checked radioactivity levels. Cops walked around, muttering to the men, pointing at people. \"I'm going to check on Gertie,\" Lori said. She must have noticed my questioning look, for then she added, \"Like I told you before, they don't know who I am. As long as I'm not seen with you, I don't think they'll notice me, or care who I am.\" \"Yeah, but what will I do?\" Lori rolled her eyes. \"Use your brain. Keep away from.. .those guys, don't do anything that makes you stick out.\" \"Wait. You're still officially my cousin.\" Lori reddened. \"Shit.\" She shook her head. \"Doesn't matter. They probably won't recognize me. They'll look for you first.\" With that, she slipped into the crowd. I kept to the border of the milling throng, not at the edge, but near it, stepping behind kids whenever an authority figure other than a teacher looked in my direction. Cops were showing my classmates pictures, and the pieces of asbestos. I couldn't tell what they were saying, but someone pointed in my direction. I quickly moved behind a couple tall kids and they lost me. Still, I knew I had to get out of there fast. ...But how? I spotted Dad's blue F-100 coming up alongside the curb, but it seemed like a galaxy away. Dad stopped, got out, talked with Mrs. Horne, showing her a little booklet. From the design, I guessed it to be a funeral program. The big woman gave him a sympathetic nod, looking around for me, but of course the cops were looking for me too. In fact, Dad didn't escape their notice, either . Boom! I looked back and saw Jimmy popping out from behind some bushes, hurling M-80's at the police cars. As the guys in Hazmat suits and police officers turned to look, I rushed up to Dad, giving Mrs. Horne a sideways glance. \"She's finally gone, isn't she?\" I ventured. Dad coughed, showing me his father's picture. I made myself appropriately sad, though granddad died five years ago, and Dad had marked through the date with a felt tip. \"Oh. Right. That is today, isn't it?\" Dad nodded, glanced at my teacher. \"This week has been a little hard on all of us. You probably noticed how tired he looks.\" Mrs. Horne completely bought it. She didn't even question how he kept hiding the program from her scrutiny. \"Oh! I'm so sorry! I had no idea. \" Dad rubbed my head. \" C'mon, kid. Let's go. \" I could feel tension in his hands as he noticed the cops. We hurried into the truck. Through the back window, I could see officers slapping Jimmy with handcuffs. \"You shouldn't lie, daddy,\" Gertie said from the back seat. Dad shifted into drive. \"Sorry, darling. Daddy can't tell the truth like you can. Folks are liable to believe him. \" A moment later, my sister had her face pressed to the window, pointing to something. \"Mommy! I see mommy!\" Dad smirked. \"Yeah. I saw her too. And her police escort. \" When people started shouting at us, Dad stepped on the gas. \"Wait,\" I said. \"Where's Lori?\" \"Probably with your mother,\" Dad said. \"These people pulled out all the stops. ..When were you going to tell me that girlfriend didn't have any supernatural powers?\" \"I didn't say she didn't have any, daddy,\" Gertie said. \"I just said nobody knows about it but us.\" I swallowed. \"Well...\" Dad sighed. \"We all got some hard choices to make. We can either let them whisk us away to their secret army base, or we can start letting people go... At least they won't try to dissect your girlfriend. \" \"Mommy...\" Gertie whimpered. \"I know, sweetie. Those guys will do anything to nab you.\" Hearing more shouts, he turned up the volume on the car's tape deck, Stay Hungry by Twisted Sister. It started raining. Thunder cracked in the distance, the sky turning dark as night. \"Oh great,\" Dad grumbled. \"That's lovely. Hope we can use the weather to our advantage.\" Dad tried to cross the bridge leading out of town, but ran into a police barricade. He swerved, turned around, driving back the way we came. Not to the school, of course, but to another route that would hopefully get us out. \"Why don't we just use the spaceship?\" Gertie asked. \"That's what we built it for!\" \"Sorry, sugar. I don't trust your little contraption that much.\" He patted the dashboard. \"At least with this baby, I know how it works!\" He sighed. \"Elliott, Gertie...if I never get to see you again, I want you both to know that your daddy loves you very much.\" I stifled a sob. \"I love you too.\" \"Me too, daddy,\" Gertie said. Only two bridges could get us across the river. When we reached the second one, we ran straight into another police barricade. Dad tried to reverse direction and go back out, maybe to take the southern road out of town, but then some army Jeeps and cop cars boxed us in. Dad slammed on the brakes. Soldiers, police, men in Hazmat suits approached the truck. A couple of them escorted my mother to the side door. Mom waved to my sister through the window. \"Hey, honey! Long time no see!\" \"Mommy!\" Gertie cried. \"Gertie, these nice men are going to take us back home. You'd like that, wouldn't you?\" \"Umm...\" Gertie stammered, glancing nervously at Dad. Dad mouthed no. \"Daddy says you're going to take us back to that army base.\" Mom sighed. Her reply wasn't exactly a no. \"I spoke with them. They're going to make some arrangements. We'll get to see each other, I promise.\" A tear rolled down Gertie's cheek. \"Mommy, you shouldn't lie.\" \"Honey, I will get to see you. They have some rules about visitation, but they told me they're willing to negotiate. \" Dad laughed. \"And you believed them, just like that?\" More tears trickled down my sister's face. \"I'm sorry, mommy, I can't! I don't want to go back there! Not ever!\" Mom put her hand on the glass. \" You love me, honey, don't you?\" \"Yes, mommy,\" she sobbed. \"But those men aren't going to let us be a family again!\" Giving up, Mom gave me a hopeful smile. \"Elliott... \" I sighed. \"Mom, I love you, but she's right. It's not going to be a home.\" \"It's not a home now,\" Mom protested. \"All right.\" A soldier pressed a rifle to Dad's window. \"We tried the carrot. Now here's the stick. Out. Now. We can and will open fire.\" \"Kids,\" Dad hissed through his teeth. \"Get ready to run. Passenger door.\" I gave him a slight nod. Dad flipped the door handle (he'd been having problems with the door closing mechanism anyway), dropping onto the seat at the same time he kicked the door into the soldier's body. The rifle went off, spraying glass and tearing holes in the ceiling. \"Elliott! Gertie! Run!\" \"But Dad!\" I protested. \"Go! Say hello to ET for me! \" As Dad got out and punched his attacker in the face, me and Gertie quickly rushed out the passenger side. Obviously, we couldn't just run away. Like I said, we were surrounded. The moment we got out of the truck and ran a few feet, a soldier picked up Gertie. I hit the man in the crotch, yanking my sister out of his clutches, but then someone else grabbed me from behind, pinning my arms behind my back. Mr. Keys stepped out of the crowd, waving to someone. Soldiers led Mom around the corner of the truck, followed by Dad, held at gunpoint by a couple more military guys. \"Elliott, it's time to go home.\" It seemed this was the end. Mom gave me and my sister an apologetic smile as we got led to a black van. As men popped the doors open, an ugly yellow Toyota Tercel rolled up to the barricade. Cops marched up to its windows, waving the car around, but instead of moving, the vehicle actually parked, and a weird gun on its roof turned and pointed at a nearby power transformer. To my absolute surprise, I saw a glowing ball, identical to the one I'd created when I first tested my project, shooting out the gun's muzzle. The transformer blew, throwing everything into darkness. In a flash of lightning, I saw Mr. Sigler stepping out of the car, throwing out flares. His wife sat in the driver's seat, gripping the wheel. Gertie pointed. \"Hey! That's my teacher!\" I heard a couple thuds, and in another flash of lightning, I saw Timmashay grabbing our hands, leading us away from the barricade. In another flash of lightning, we brushed past Michael in his tinfoil alien costume and fake alien head. He frantically waved us on. The soldiers switched on floodlights, but by that time we were running down the street, and my brother was distracting them with dry ice and smoke bombs and flares. I heard gunshots. Timmashay opened up a red VW Station Wagon, ushering us inside. Once I got in the back and looked out the window, I saw Sigler's bubble cannon blasting more glowing orbs, knocking cops and soldiers to the ground. Our driver started up the engine, and we sped down the street with the distinct puttering noise that that brand of automobile are known for. \"Daddy!\" Gertie sobbed as the barricade disappeared behind us. I gave her a hug. \" I know. This isn't going to be easy.\" \"You seem to have made an impression on your teacher. He said he reminded him of you when he was younger. Said he figured out why you guys had been sleeping in his class.\" The Volkswagen came to a stop in front of the school. \"Wait,\" I cried. \"What are we doing here?\" Timmashay clicked her tongue against her teeth. \" Thought you might like to see your girlfriend again . I hear she's got a plan.\" She clicked a button on a walkie-talkie. \"He's here.\" My mouth suddenly got dry. \"My...girlfriend?\" Timmashay nodded. \" I probably wouldn't keep her waiting. \" Spotting the flashing lights of cop cars up the street, I quickly dashed out across the front lawn in the rain, with Gertie close at my heels. Lori came running from the employee parking lot, hair damp and matted, radio in one hand. She rushed up to me, pulled me into her arms and kissed me. The jangling car keys in her hand indicated where she'd been hiding. \"They know,\" she sighed, pressing her forehead to mine. She dropped the keys in the grass. \"Hope Mrs. Sigler can find these again.\" I gave her a questioning glance, but a moment later I saw the reason she did it. The front doors of the school burst open, and a pair of men in army green came storming out. Lori glanced anxiously at the darkened sky, pushed the button on the radio. \"Bruce?\" Apparently we had a third walkie-talkie. I heard a voice saying, \" Just a minute! \" The soldiers were closing in. Cops and black vans zoomed up to the school. \"We don't have a minute.\" \"Gee, hold your horses, okay? \" A second later, the Thunder Road settled on the grass, door popping open. \"I'll take the army guys,\" Bruce said as he jumped out. \"You guys... Go to Mars. \" I swallowed hard. \"What about you?\" \"You think I want to spend any more time in that cramped little soup can? Get going!\" It was an uneven match, but Bruce charged at the men with a loud yell, doing his best to injure and trip them up. I, Gertie and Lori boarded the Thunder Road. I noticed that someone had added a fresh car battery to the interior. Important, considering the amount of energy we'd used up the day before. \"Goodbye, Earth,\" Lori muttered as she stared out the window. \"Guess this will be the last time we'll be seeing you.\" \"Goodbye Earth,\" Gertie whimpered. My girlfriend looked into my eyes. \"You sure you don't want to go to Mexico, or a deserted island in the Pacific?\" \"They'll just come after us again.\" \"ET's friends are very close,\" Gertie added. \"We should go.\" Sighing, Lori brought our vehicle up into the air. By then, we had radar vans and military vehicles encircling the property on all sides, driving on the grass. Kids, still in school, stared through the windows and muttered with excitement at all the chaotic goings-on. I don't know where they'd been hiding, but all of a sudden, a squadron of military helicopters swooped in from nowhere, gathering around our little ship, megaphones ordering us to land or they would open fire. \"You think the bubble is bulletproof?\" Lori asked. \"Dunno.\" I pointed to a chopper, a big scary thing like I saw Stallone flying in a Rambo film. \"I'm more worried about those rockets. Maybe we should set it down.\" Lori entered the commands on the keyboard, but we only dropped a few feet before our vehicle started... having its own ideas . With frightening speed, the Thunder Road shot out sideways from beneath the cluster of helicopters, whipped up in a diagonal, and ran a ring around a pair of them. \"What's happening!\" I cried. \"What are you doing!\" \"Nothing!\" Lori shouted as she frantically pressed buttons. \"I've lost control of the system!\" I dug my fingernails into the chair as our ship took us through another harrowing airborne maneuver that somehow resulted in two of the Rambo helicopters colliding and crashing on the ground. The Thunder Road shot like a bullet toward the clock face on City Hall. \"Shut it off!\" I yelled. \"We're going to crash!\" \"If we shut it off, we won't even have the bubble to protect us!\" Lori protested. We braced ourselves as the building loomed close. A moment before impact, the Thunder Road abruptly reversed direction, and we were soaring over the river. \"Now!\" I said. \"Shut it off! At least we'll have a water landing!\" \"Wait!\" Lori pointed to the monitor. \"Look!\" On screen, I now saw a diagram showing two blinking dots, one larger, indicating our position, the other smaller, somewhere further away, above us, with a line in between them. As I stared, the dot traveled further and further up the line, as if tracing a map. \"He's really doing it!\" Gertie exclaimed. \"ET's taking us home!\" ","Summary":" I made friends with a creature from outer space. For one week, I was the luckiest kid in the world."},{"Movie":"My Bodyguard","Title":"Ricky and Maryanne: My best friend","Author":"VoyagerG","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/4639466","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: I wrote this story many years before I even had internet and knew the rules of Fanfiction. I was just having fun with it. After a few revisions, I am now posting it in full chapter form and leaving it alone. It was my first attempt at writing a Fanfic and for that I'm proud of it. A lot of the original movie dialogue and plotting is intact. Being more familiar with my own hometown and inspired, I had made a change in the setting (Brooklyn for Chicago) and I turned one of the leads from boy to girl. I also attempt to capture what we didn't see in the film... bits of Ricky's home life. Despite all this I hope you can still enjoy the tale of: Ricky and Maryanne: My best friend (Written: 2002) Chapter 1: Maryanne's first day Maryanne Peache wiped the fog from the car window. Outside, the morning was gray and slimy, a perfect way to start her first day at Sheepshead Bay High School. The building loomed dark and ugly to her. Hundreds of students milled around talking, smoking, dancing, and making out in hidden corners. It was a far cry from the all-girls prep school she last attended in Upper Manhattan. She almost cursed her father for moving again. This was the third time during the course of her high-school career. Now in her senior year, she wondered how long her father would decide to remain in Brooklyn. Maryanne learned the hard way to never settle down completely. Every time she found stability, her family upped and left. Grant Peache was a go-getter, forever making new business deals and hopping on others. It seemed to her that his family was just an extension of him. They were like worn in furniture you never have the heart to throw away. Maryanne was normally a cheery girl with a big heart. But her father's pushy attitude and mother's pride somewhat rubbed off on her. Her mother Rachel was vain and independent. The Peache family could always afford to be. She taught Maryanne that in the modern world, 'women needed to be strong; there were no knights on white horses.' Maryanne then watched her lose all her dignity and beauty to a disease that wasted her inside and out. Rachel chose to suffer at home; she couldn't bear the thought of the world seeing her shrivel away to what she called \"A festering shell of a woman with stomach cancer.\" While the home arrangement worked well for her, the rest of the Peache family suffered. Eventually Maryanne shouldered much of the responsibility of caring for her mother's daily needs. Grant then took in his mother, Ruth. She and Maryanne were Rachel's sole caretakers and for Maryanne, her whole world. -Oo- Maryanne thanked her driver Charles and stepped out of the black Lincoln. She inched ahead a few paces and soon all five feet of her was engulfed in a sea of restless students and harried teachers. She ignored the snide looks the other students gave her. This part of town wasn't used to seeing her wealth. She glanced at her program card. It was already twisted and warped because she wrung it nervously in the car. Her schedule was light; she had completed most of her major credits in her last school. History, English and dance in the morning, lunch and lab science last. She took an immediate liking to her homeroom and English teacher, Mrs. Hanson. She had a calm smile and pleasant disposition. One student in class rubbed her the wrong way; his name was 'Moody' Abergo. The name fit his attitude toward life and he was severely disrespectful to both students and teachers. If there was any good to be found in him, Maryanne couldn't see it. She had the bad sense to sit in front of him in homeroom. He was a latecomer and as soon as he sat down he blew spitballs on her hair and incessantly banged her chair. \"Why don't you grow up?\" Maryanne seethed. Mrs. Hanson looked up from her book. \"Is there a problem, Moody?\" \"Yeah, this peach pit took my seat!\" \"I did not, I was here before you came in.\" Maryanne looked around for support; the others just kept their heads low. She realized quickly that they were all afraid of this moron. \"Melvin, stay in the seat you are in.\" Mrs. Hanson warned. \"I don't go by that no more Clarice, call me Big M, I wanna be called Big M.\" Maryanne smirked at him. \"I don't think big fits your profile, just your head and mouth.\" Moody glared at her with a vengeance. He was certainly taller than Maryanne, with longish brown hair and small dark eyes. He had threatening low, brow bone; if he was nice he could be passably good looking. \"You know what?\" He whispered, leaning forward and breathing into her ear. \"You better watch yourself and grow eyes in the back of your head.\" He sat back and grinned, then turned to talk with one of his friends. Maryanne felt a slight chill and held her tongue. She usually never let anyone step on her or treat her wrong, but this time, she felt he meant business. Mrs. Hanson reviewed her roster and called out a certain name. \" Ricky Linderman? Has anyone seen Ricky Linderman?\" There was a flurry of excited whispers; a few students called out rude comments. \"Who wants him?\" \"I hope I never see him!\" \"He's probably in jail!\" Maryanne leaned over to the kid next to her. He was short for his age with red hair, sunken in blue eyes and a smattering of freckles. She had heard his name was Russell Cartman. \"Who's Ricky Linderman?\" \"Nobody, just your local mass murderer.\" Maryanne put her head on her arm and the chill returned. What kind of school was this? -Oo- Maryanne and Russell also shared first period History class. The teacher was late, so everyone hung around talking. All Russell could do was sigh and hold his head and Maryanne felt badly for him. He had told her how he hated school, but his parents insist he finish. She discovered that he was very smart, and only sixteen years old. Sheepshead Bay thought him a genius and decided to skip him a grade. Maryanne consoled Russell with the fact that this would be his last year and he would never have to deal with these bullies again. \"Hey, I hope you get away with it...talking back to Moody I mean. If I were you, I'd avoid being alone anywhere in this school. I never go to the bathroom.\" Russell warned. \"Russell, that's silly, what do you do?\" \"I hold it in, don't drink any liquids. I heard that a kid got thrown out the window last year, and another kid once got his eyeball kicked out, they never did find the eyeball.\" Maryanne looked at him in disbelief. \"Oh my goodness! Did Moody do it?\" \"I'm not saying he did, and I'm not saying he didn't. All I know is you better start paying your protection money.\" \"Protection money from Moody? That is so ridiculous.\" \"No Maryanne, its protection against Linderman, Moody and his friends will be your bodyguards.\" Maryanne was annoyed that anyone was foolish enough to give Moody the time of day. \"Let me guess, you pay too?\" Russell shrugged. \"Yup, I guess I'm addicted to breathing.\" Maryanne shook her head. Moody had an extortion ring. It didn't come as a surprise to her. She decided she wasn't going to take part in anything going down. Her next thoughts drifted to Ricky Linderman. Who was he? What did he do that was so wrong? Maybe he wouldn't come back to school anyway. It seemed most of the students would be happy about that. They would just have to wait and see.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: A beautiful young man The first fewndays passed by smoothly. The only problem was facing Moody in Englishnclass, and to her dismay, Science lab. Mrs. Hanson knew Moody was antroublemaker, but she didn't change his seat. Maryanne was somewhatnrelieved that she had Russell on her left and Shelly Cusik on hernright. Shelly was a sweet girl. She was gangly beanpole with longnfrizzy curls; bright blue eyes and she never stopped talking. Mrs. Hansonnread off the first assignment, 'Romeo and Juliet' and it'sncounterpart, 'West Side story.' The entire class groaned. \"Gosh, it'snnot like we haven't read that one before, I read it in tenth, hown'bout you?\" Shelly whispered to Maryanne. \"Same here,nthink we should tell her Shelly?\" Theyndidn't have to ask; 'Catnin the hat' Murphy raised her hand up high. Before Mrs. Hanson could call on her,nMoody let out a long \"MEOW\" Most of the class snickered. \"Moody!nAnimals aren't allowed in my class, should I send you home?\" \" Naww, Miss, I was just…\" \"Please keepnyour noises to yourself.\" Moody salutednher and she continued with her introduction. \"I realizenyour concerns, most of you may have read it before, but you are goingnto love this combo. I will be assigning a term paper and comparativenessays; it is all explained in the assignment sheet I handed out. Younare not babies anymore; I'm preparing you for the real world. I'mnnot going to bother you, or remind you to turn in these assignments.nIt's up to you to get it together and hand them in accordingly.nDon't lose these sheets, I don't have many extras.\" The classngroaned again. As much as they demanded independence, they hatednresponsibility. \"Now, thesenplays are stories of love, passion, sex and how they were willing tondie for it...\" \"I'm dyin'nfor it right now!\" Moody cut in and nudged his buddies. \"Well,nwe can't do anything about that right now .n I'm talking about love in art, a place where values and morality were the law of the land and younhad to be married to do anything about it.\" Russellnwhispered, \"Younstill do\" in a matter of fact tone. Maryanne agreed. She appreciated highnmorals, even if those around her didn't. Maryanne zonednout as Mrs. Hanson recapped the plot lines. She soon had the feelingnof being watched and turned to look at the back door. A tall studentnwas peeking inside curiously. Mrs. Hanson slowed down and the classngrew silent as the back door opened. There was a barrage of hushedncomments, and none of them were kind. Maryanne looked at Shelly, herneyes were bulging and she chewed her already nubby nails. Russell wasnsprawled over his desk, shaking his head in defeat. The entirenroom was tense and uncomfortable. It was as if the grim reapernhimself had walked in. Perhaps it was the next worst person, RickynLinderman. Lindermannpaced in slowly, Maryanne followed the length of him. He stood overnsix feet tall, with thick legs and broad shoulders. His hair wasnunkempt; chocolate waves and curls springing out all over. Hisnclothing looked slept in and bedraggled. He wore dark brown pantsnwith an oil- stained white tee shirt. Over that, he wore a largenolive coat. Maryanne often called them 'depression coats.'nRicky's resembled an army jacket without the trimmings andncamouflage. He wore big steel-toed black boots, so you heard everynstep he took. Mostnof the girls shrank away and wrinkled their faces in disgust.nMaryanne ignored all the commotion around her and gazed at himnintently. Words like 'murderer,'n'rapist,' 'waste,' and 'degenerate' were spewed under their mumbled breaths. Ricky stopped to give Mrs.nHanson a pass; she handed him an assignment sheet and pointed to annextra seat in the back. He gazed around the room, as if sizingneveryone up, or maybe, preparing for the kill. Maryanne'sneyes never left him as he passed her desk. He glanced down at her.nHis eyes were a hazy blue that shifted hues with his mood. She didn'tnshy away, but kept her focus on his face. His tan skin was smooth,nlight sideburns grew down his angular jaw. There was a cherub-likengentle quality to his face where he had a long pudgy nose and firmnheart shaped lips. His eyes were heavy lidded, but he moved themnabout like a vigilant shark. He was a scruffy, beautiful young man. Maryannenfelt goosebumps, not from the rotten things she heard, but thenconnection she instantly felt. She had an intense desire to know him.nThe moment passed and he continued to his seat. From the corner ofnher eye she saw Russell sweating and chanting, \"Pleasendon't sit behind me, Please God! Not behind me.\" Sure enough, Ricky Linderman plopped down just as Russell swore henwould, \"havena heart attack.\" Linderman then quickly got up and dragged the deskntoward the window; he remained motionless, gazing outside. Mrs.nHanson had already begun continuing her summaries and the classnsimmered down. -Oo- During hernlunch period, Maryanne took to sitting with Shelly, Russell; a kidnnamed Paul and a few others at a table in the far-left corner. Shenwas waiting on the slow line with Shelly and examining the menu. Shenhated this orange and white cafeteria. It was nothing more than anstuffy basement. The atmosphere was depressing and gloomy and thensmells of chlorine and school food made her stomach churn. She wishednthe teachers would open a window. \" Hmmm, meatloaf or meatloaf?\" Maryanne joked feebly. Another boy on line complained loudly that itnlooked like another loaf. Maryanne and Shelly both giggled andnmoved along, grabbing their milks and snacks. Shelly tugged on hernarm. \"Maryanne,nits Moody, Isn't he so far-out?\" Shelly smoothed her hair and purple shirt. Moodynand his buddy Stan 'The man' shoved through the line. \"I'dnlike to send him farnout. Maryannengrumbled. \" Oh Maryanne, he's not that bad,nit's hard being the most popular guy in school. He'snjust…misunderstood.\" Maryanne onlynlooked at her in wonder. Poor Shelly had no self-esteem left fromnthis guy. \"Hi Moody, Insaved you a spot!\" Shelly wavednthem over excitedly. Before Maryanne could protest, Moody and Stannwere in front of them. Moody ribbed his friend and turned to Shelly. \"Hey Shelly,nwanna go to the movies?\" Her face litnup. \"Sure!\" \"Well, younhave a good time while you're there okay?\" The guysncracked up at their hurtful joke. Shelly's face dropped sadly.nMaryanne gave them a dirty look and led her away. \"Shelly,nwhy do you even bother talking to Moody? He's a jerk, a big one.nHe'll never treat you the way you deserve to be treated, trust me.nGuys like him only care about themselves, and they don't care whonthey hurt. He's nothing but a bully!\" Maryannenrealized she was getting over-annoyed and calmed herself. Shellynlooked at her sneakers and agreed. \"I knownMaryanne, but you're very pretty. I don't think you know whatnit's like not to get attention from the guys. When someone likenMoody takes notice of me, I can't help the way I feel.\" Maryanne putnher arm around her new friend. They would have to talk more about hernfeelings. Maryanne wasn't the boy magnet Shelly thought. Her teennyears were spent honing her dancing skills, caring for her mother,nand keeping a watchful eye over her vivacious grandmother. She rarelyngave boys a second thought, until Ricky Linderman came back tonschool. As theynmaneuvered toward their table Shelly was flagged down by her friendnChristine. Maryanne happened to look to her left and noticed RickynLinderman sitting at a table alone. He kept his head down, eatingnslowly. He looked a sorry sight and Maryanne's heart jumped. According tonRussell, Linderman killed a kid in cold blood and raped a teacher.nPaul claimed he shot a cop. Maryanne could not believe it, butnlooking at him now she could see how someone might. Linderman didn'tnsmile or talk to anyone and he was avoided like the plague. She tookna deep breath and headed in his direction. Her hands trembled as shenimagined his reaction. She stopped by the edge of his table. \"Is thisnseat taken?\" Ricky lookednup a second, and then continued to read his magazine. She slid in andndug into the bland meatloaf. She reached for the saltshaker in frontnof Ricky; he eyed her the whole time. \"I'mntaking some salt...just a little...\" She shook itnquickly and put it back in front of him and his four milk cartons. \" So …whatndo you call this stuff anyway?\" \" Garbage.\" He muttered looking away. \"Yes, Inguess so, I usually bring lunch. I packed a snack in my bag.\" Shenpulled out a clear bag with apple and pear slices and munched onnthem. \"Want some?nI may also have grapes somewhere.\" She started rummaging hernbook-bag again. \"No, thengarbage is fine.\" Maryannenallowed herself to chuckle. At least he wasn't a total drone. Henhad a quiet sense of humor that appealed to her. \"My name isnMaryanne Peache, I'm new around here. It's way out of my zone,nbut I heard they had a good performing arts program. And I didn'tnreally want to commute to Manhattan. I'm training to be a dancer.nYou look like a mechanic or something.\" She leaned innand peeked at the magazine. Ricky closed it in her face and she satnback abruptly. \" Oh, I guess you work with cars or motorcycles. That's cool. Our carsnare always on the fritz, maybe one day you could check them out, mynfather would pay you well.\" \"Yeah,nmaybe.\" Ricky mumblednthis not believing he even agreed. She was trying to make small talk.nHe could usually never be bothered, but he felt compelled to say atnleast two words. Right now he wanted to book; he began feeling bitterneyes on him as always. She just continued her chatter. \"Hey, I wasnthinking, a few of us are going to see The Superman sequel tonight,nwant to come? It's playing at the…\" Ricky stoodnup. \"No. Saw it.\" He marchednfrom the cafeteria. Maryanne packed up quickly and followed. \"What'snwrong? Did I say something wrong? I only asked...\" Ricky shovednthrough the doors. \"Just getnlost, okay?\" Maryanne wasnstunned. Who did he think he was? She decided to forgo an argument.nRicky stopped by the boy's bathroom and lit a cigarette. Maryannenskidded to a halt and quickly tried another approach. \"HeynLinderman, you know those will… stunt your growth?\" She laughednand did a little twist. A slight grin passed his lips but he kept hisnexpression firm. \"See,nit's not that bad! I caught that!\" Maryanne blurted out. Ricky rolled his eyes, \"I'm outta here.\" He tossed thencigarette and went into the bathroom. Maryanne threw her arms up inndefeat. Tapping into Ricky Linderman was going to be a challenge, butnit was one she was going to take.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Extortionists and Bullies Maryannenrushed down the long corridor and up six flights of stairs to get tonscience class. Sheepshead High was not a tall building, but it was annendless labyrinth of classrooms and corners. As she rushed into thenlab she settled at an empty marble table in the back. This class wasnsmall, only those who needed to repeat or make up the credits werenhere. Everyone had already paired with his or her friends. As shenpulled out her notebook she got the peculiar feeling of eyes on hernagain. Thenback door swung open and Ricky Linderman strode to her table on thenlast bell. He pulled up the stool beside her and kept his focusnstraight ahead. Maryanne gave him a long cool stare, as he had donento her numerous times. Moody and his platinum blonde friend, Billy,nstrutted to the table in front of them. With Ricky beside her, hernconfidence soared. Mr. Kessly, the lab teacher, scurried in behindnthem. He was skinny and bald with light blue eyes and a gray beard.nHe fluttered around adjusting the utensils; he noticed Ricky. \"Fornanyone new in class today, the person you are next to will be yournlab partner for the rest of the semester.\" Maryannenstole another glance at Ricky. She thought he would get up and leavenright then, but he stayed put. Mr. Kessly called up a representativenfrom each group to collect the lab supplies. Ricky made no move sonMaryanne went up. Today was the fun day of dissecting a frog.nMaryanne was braver than most of the girls when they had to pull thenfrog from the bucket. One girl kept insisting hers was still alive. AsnMr. Kessly explained the process, Ricky was ready and waiting with anscalpel in hand. The students began to murmur, but he pretended tonnot hear. When Maryanne placed the frog on the tray before him, henimmediately began making skillful incisions, gently peeling away skinnand muscle. Maryanne admired his long and dexterous fingers. Shentook the assignment of labeling the organs on the sheet; grateful shendidn't have to do the dirty work. Mr. Kessly was happy with theirnproject as he walked around. He called them a \"neatnand effective team.\" Maryanneneventually caught Moody watching and whispering to Billy. She had ansickening feeling they were planning something devious. Ricky was thenfirst in class to finish dissecting. He calmly stared out the window,nwhile the rest still cut and hacked away at the poor amphibian.nMaryanne kept watch on Moody; she noticed he picked up a hidden frognfrom the sink, still dripping formaldehyde. When she glancednnervously at Ricky, Moody aimed the frog and flung it across thentable toward her face. Ricky's arm shot out and caught it in ansplit second before it could touch her. Maryanne let out a littlenshout and ducked. The catch startled both her and Moody. Mr.nKessly scribbled on the board, telling the class to quiet down; theynhad also seen Ricky's catch. Ricky casually tossed the frog fromnhand to hand. He aimed it at Billy, but turned it into a curve pitchnon Moody's chest. The whole class watched with interest, andnMaryanne noticed some cheered silently. \" HEY! YOU JERK OFF!\" Moody shouted. Everyonenlaughed aloud, but hushed when Mr. Kessly marched over to the table. \"Quietndown now, or else I'll call the dean!\" He warned. \"Itnwasn't me mistuh! Itnwas Linderman! Jeeeeee...\" Moody tattled. \" Linderman? I haven't heard a peep from him. He finished his work, I suggestnyou do the same, I don't need to see you in this class anothernsemester, do I, Melvin?\" Mr.nKessly returned to the chalkboard and the rest of the classnsnickered. Moody began to mutter oaths under his breath, and gavenMaryanne and Ricky the finger. When the bell rang, Maryanne turned tonRicky, with a grateful smile. \"Thanknyou! Those chemicals could have blinded me. You have fast hands.\"nShe admitted shyly. Rickynstared at her, then quickly grumbled, \"Forget it, I gotta go.\" \"You're welcome!\" She called after him with a hint of sarcasm. She was glad her day wasnover. -O- Outnin the hallway, Maryanne saw Moody and his friends lingering by anfire exit. Moving closer, she noticed they held a pimpled freshman bynthe collar. She slid behind an art display to better hear thenconversation. \"Alrightndork, where's the money you owe?\" Thenboy struggled and croaked. \"I don't have fifty cents! I only haventwenty five cents and I need it for…\" \"Shutnup! Jeeeee! What did I tell you? If you don't pay your protection money in fullnand on time ,nLinderman will come after you and there's nothing we can do 'boutnit!\" \" Yeah! He'll turn ya into soup. You want to be the next casualty onnLinderman's list of victims. Probably on the front page or the tenno'clock news. Who knows how he'll off ya?\" Billy sneered. Moodynlaughed and tugged the boy's plaid shirt harder. \"So what's itngonna be punk?\" Thenboy was in a state of panic and struggled fiercly. \"I'll give itntomorrow, I swear! Why would he hurt me? I've never done anything tonhim, honest! I've never even met him before!\" Moodynsighed loudly and looked to Billy. \"Looks like we're gonna havento visit the office.\" Withnfiendish glee they grabbed the boy's neck and dragged him into thenboy's bathroom. Maryanne was horrified. Moody and his friends werenterrible extortionists and they used Ricky Linderman's allegednreputation to get the money. She couldn't believe all this whennRussell had told her. She ran past the bathroom just as Moody andnBilly stepped out. The poor freshman was red faced and his head wasnsoaked and smelled of urine. Moody knocked into her before she couldnescape. \"Well,nlook who it is, Peachnface, too bad the frognmissed ya.\" Maryannengritted her teeth, she was not afraid to stand up to him. \"Younare a dog Moody, you and all your friends! I'm telling PrincipalnDaniels everything you've been doing.\" Moodynpushed up close to her until she backed into the lockers. He grabbednher face in his hand and moved it from side to side. The freshmanntook the chance to escape when Billy loosened his grip. \"ListennPeache, we don't wanna hurt ya, I'll cut you a deal like anyonenelse. You give us fifty cents a day, and we give you protection.\" \"From what, Moody? You and your crummy friends are the only threat I see in thisnschool!\" \" Ha! You think so? You saw the glint in Linderman's eye, guys like himnare unstable and one day they just snap and… ROOOAARRR!\" Moodynyelled in her face and shook her from head to toe. Maryanne gulped innslight anxiety and he continued to harass her in a low tone. \"Inpersonally think you're the next victim, he couldn't take his eyes off you in English classnand Science. Pay up and we'll stop him. Gotnit?\" Maryannenshook her head adamantly. \"You are a weasel! Linderman hasn'tnhurt anyone. He helped me from a frog you threw! I'm not giving you or your ugly friends anything!\" Withnall her strength, she shoved him into Billy and they bowled overnagainst a bulletin board. She took off down the stairs. The bell rangnand freshmen and sophomores clamored through the halls. Thankful fornthe distraction, she bustled out the side exit. She kept runningnaround to the front of the building. Charles was waiting and shenhopped into the front seat of the Lincoln. \" DRIVE!nDRIVE! PLEASE!\" Thenchauffer stepped on the gas just as Moody and Billy caught up withnher. They only managed to bang on the windows. \"Whatnin the world was that, Maryanne?\" Charles demanded. Maryannenwas breathless. \"They're bullies from school. But I won't letnthem get me, somehow I won't!\"[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: Reputation and Humiliation Maryannenspent the next two weeks avoiding Moody at all costs. She tooknRussell's advice and stayed away from all their hangouts. Shenavoided dark corners of the school and walked with groups wherevernpossible. Her dancing was more focused and better than ever. Hernteacher, Ms. Francis, used her to lead the rest of the girls.nMaryanne involved herself in another school activity, swimming. Thenswim team met after school on Mondays and Wednesdays and she attendednextracurricular dancing classes on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Today theynwere rehearsing a number for an upcoming recital. The class decidednon 'SING,nSING, SING' fornthe show stopping finale. Maryanne enjoyed all the time away from the hotel.nShe was often bored and lonely there. Her father rarely made time fornher and her grandmother was only passive company for so long. Ruthnwas a social butterfly and she needed to meet everyone who stayed atnthe St. George. Maryanne spent many nights following her around andncoaxing her to come to bed. However, Ruth's answer was always: \" Live anlittle! Just one more drink!\" Maryanne wasntraining the girls in one sequence of steps, urging them to remainnfocused on the audience and not take the smiles off their faces. Itnwas vital no matter how tired or bruised their feet were. She did anfew variations on the move and kept flashing smiles at them. RickynLinderman sat hunched in the far-left corner of the gym bleachersnscribbling furiously into his notebook. He made furtive glances atnher. She was excellent and a good instructor to the younger students.nShe wore a black leotard and violet tights. She moved with boundlessnenergy and freedom, lighting up the entire gymnasium. Ricky imaginedndancing with her, though he didn't think he knew how at all. Henreasoned he could do the lifts. Maryanne was half a shrimp comparednto his towering frame. The majority of the girls in class were tallernthan she was. She blew thenwhistle to take five and he realized she spotted him; he lowered hisnhead and continued to write. He counted the seconds before her shadownloomed over him. He closed the book swiftly and shuffled to get hisnbag. \" Ricky! Were you watching? I'm a little rusty on the jitterbug, but I'llnget it way before the recital. It's nice to see you here. What are you doing?\" Maryanne madena move to sit next to him and he got up. \"Inwas just leaving… rightnnow.\" He murmured and walked away. Maryannensighed and stamped her foot. \"Ricky! Why are you running away from me all the time? Why are you afraid tontalk to me?\" Ricky's eyesntraveled down her frame, while small, she was noticeably curvy. \" Me, afraid of you? I think you got that backward. And I wasn't running, I was walking,nlike this…\" Maryanne putnher hands on her hips and cocked her head. \" Wait! It's obvious that I'm not scared of you; I don't care whatneverybody says. Most of it is probably baloney and I don't fall fornrumors that easily, got it?\" \" Yeah ...Ingot it, good for you.\" Maryannenturned red. He was being very difficult. \" Ohnyeah? Well...whatever your problem is… I could carenless anyway!\" Ricky shook his head and stood over her. \" Hey! I'm not the one following you around all day. You're rich! Gonfind yourself another hobby! I didn't ask you to care!\" Maryannenwanted to slug him on the spot for turning the tables. She held backnher anger. \"Just fornthe record Linderman, you're being used! Don't you know that Moodyncharges everyone in school money for protection?\" Ricky stoppednsullenly and his tone became subdued. \"From me?\" \"YesnRicky, don't you care about that? Don'tnyou want to get back at him for ruining your reputation?\" Maryannenwished she had kept her big mouth shut. Ricky was frustrated, notnwith her, but with Moody and all the students who bought into hisngame. However, he couldn't fault them, not after everything they'venheard about him. \"I don'tncare about my reputation! Everyone knows it! I kill, rape, steal, you namenit, I do it!\" Ricky's eyesnwidened and his jaw clenched. Maryanne looked deeper and saw the hurtnflickering, and his mouth trembled, but she was angry with him. Shenwas angry he wouldn't open up to her. \" Fine! Then go do it! I'll leave you alone; we'll leave each othernalone!\" \" Good! I didn't ask for this anyway!\" Ricky turnednon his heels and charged out. All the girlsnwere watching with surprise. Maryanne composed herself and blew thenwhistle. \"Okay,nwe have 20 minutes left, let's make it good!\" Ricky was seething all the way out of thenbuilding. Why did he even stay and argue? He wasn't going to let anspoiled rich girl get the best of him. He didn't understand it; shenonly wanted to talk to him. He hopped on the bus headed towardnanother side of the City. He had work to finish up. -Oo- It was thenfollowing day and Maryanne was nervous. She clasped and unclasped hernhands waiting in the school office. Secretaries gabbed and clackednaway at typewriters. Soft, light rock music filtered through a smallnradio. A row of delinquent students sat behind her; they popped innand out of Mr. Daniel's office like a conveyor belt, carrying tardynslips, detention and suspension papers. A gruff voice finally callednout: \"MaryannenPeache, comenin.\" Maryannenstepped inside cautiously. Principal Daniels leaned forward on hisndesk. He was gray-haired and overweight with glasses sliding down hisnbulbous nose. \"Have a seatnand let's get to the heart of this matter, okay?\" Maryannennodded, a little grieved over his inconsiderate attitude. \"I'llnlet you know now, Ms. Peache, I'm very much aware of MelvinnAbergo's reputation in this school. I've been here for 20 yearsnand there is always at least one of his kind every term.\" He pushed thenbuzzer of his intercom. \"Ms. White, please tell Melvin Abergo toncome in.\" Maryanne wasnthoroughly disappointed now. She had thought this would be a privatenmeeting with the principal and that he would listen to her complaintsnand tell her Moody would be expelled. \" Umm, Mr. Daniels, I didn't really tell you everything that happened.nI...\" \"Ms. Peache, I have it all on your complaintnsheet, I know how to fill in the blanks. It says here that he teasesnyou in all your classes, threw a frog with chemicals at you innscience lab, threatened you in the hall.\" \"Yes, Inknow, but what about the other kids I mentioned? He's doing thingsnto them too.\" \"I understand, but if they are keeping mum on it, how am I supposed to do anythingnabout it without proof? Do you get me?\" Maryannennodded again, now she felt truly alone. Moody entered the officenlooking extremely apologetic. His head was down and his arms werenfolded. \"Moody,nthere's a lot of complaints stacked up against you here, do youndeny them?\" Moody seemednto know he was hooked and shook his head 'No.' \"Well that'sngood. Man, do you realize that I could suspend you for this? Makingnphysical threats? Extortion? I don't want to hear about this again,ndo you understand me? Stop screwing up; this is your last year! Indon't want to deal with you anymore and I know you don't want tonspend another year here.\" Moody shooknhis head up and down, not making much eye contact. \"Good,nnow get back to class, one more time, Abergo, and you are gone! Inmean it!\" Moody leftnquickly. Maryanne gathered her books and turned to leave, but Mr.nDaniels stopped her. \"ListennMaryanne, I realize you are new here. It's not what you're usednto. This isn't a little private school. You can't keep cryingnwolf whenever one of these punks looks at you crooked. Do you getnme?\" \"Yes,nI getnyou.\" Maryanne she fumed. \"Fine, justnbe careful, don't give him any reason to mess with you, he'llnleave you alone soon enough. If things get worse I want you to let menknow.\" Maryannenheaded to the cafeteria. She wasted a whole period to hear that shenneeded to watch her back. She couldn't believe the school officialsnwere no help. This was why public school was in the rotten conditionnit was today. She stepped on the lunch line pulling foodnindiscriminately off the counters. She clutched her tray looking forna seat. Straight-ahead,nsix tables down, Ricky Linderman sat alone as usual. She watched himnthumb through his magazine, every so often he raised his head andnglanced around sadly. He looked very lonesome. She regretted thenargument they had. Despite Russell's warnings in first period, shendecided to try and talk to him again. She wanted to get at least one person on her side. She moved ahead, and was completely unaware ofnthe leg that shot out in front of her. Maryanne fellnforward, unable to retain balance. With a small scream she nearlynlanded on her face. Her food tray stopped her. She was covered innmashed potatoes, vegetables, chicken and gravy. She watched hernorange roll to a stop beside a big black boot. The moment played likenan eternity in slow motion. Moody's table burst out laughing, andnthen the entire section began to laugh aloud. She felt a few tearsnroll down her face. A tan hand appeared in front of her. Ricky wasnpoised over her, waiting for her to take it. She noticed the laughterndied down and everyone went back to eating lunch. She shook fromnhumiliation and grasped his hand tightly. Ricky pulled her up withnno effort. She wiped her tears away, feeling weak in her knees. Shenlooked at him for support as she brushed the remains of lunch fromnher shirt. \"I'm sorrynabout Wednesday. I don't want to argue with you Ricky.\" Ricky gave herna gentle look, a small gleam in his eyes. He nodded slightly enoughnfor her to notice. Maryanne burst into sobs and ran from thencafeteria. The janitor cleaned up the mess disgruntled while Moodynand his friends continued to snigger. Ricky fixed his gaze on thentable, making sure Moody saw him. They all calmed down and Moodyngulped, looking in other directions. Ricky stood up brusquely andnwatched them flinch. He was beginning to enjoy scaring them. InnScience lab, Maryanne had changed to her black leotard for a shirt.nShe remained silent, keeping her eyes only on her papers. Rickyncollected the equipment and completed the experiment for today. Henimagined how embarrassed she felt, but he knew she would get over itnsoon. They always forget stuff like this, but the unthinkablenhappened to him and he was branded for life, or at least until schoolnwas finished. He knew he would carry his burden… forever.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5:nI won't let you go Ms. Vitale'snwhistle screamed among the splashes and chatter of the girl's swimnteam, signaling the end of practice. Climbing up the ladder, Maryannensaw her beckoning. She grabbed her towel and went over. Ms. Vitalenwas an imposing woman, not fat, but solid nonetheless. She wore hernblonde hair yanked back in a severe ponytail and dressed in annever-ending wardrobe of red shorts and blue striped athletic socks,nalong with the standard navy blue swimsuit. \" Peache! I need more from ya; you're sinking out there. I have to seenstrength in your legs and that backstroke looks like my goldfishnturned up and died!\" Maryanne hung her head meekly. Subtlety was notnMs. Vitale's strong point. She caught the other girls making deadnfish faces at her. \"I'll trynharder, I promise, do you think I can stay a little later today?\" \" Mmmmm …Okay,nbut make sure the guard remembers your here, I'll tell him. And Inwant you to stop the second you get tired, you hear me?\" Maryanne nodded and began stretching beside thenbench. She thought the time alone in the pool would help ease her.nShe was very sore at the world today. Swimming calmed her, though shenwasn't the greatest at it. When the gym finally cleared she readiednherself to dive in. As she swam back and forth all she had were angrynthoughts. What kind of school was this when the principle accused thenvictim of 'Crying wolf?' And Moody and his friends never let upnfor a second on anyone. As long as she's around him, he'dncontinue to threaten her. Wherenwas the justice? And what was up with Ricky Linderman? What was his real problem? He skulked around school like a mute golem. She had onlyntried to be friendly. He sometimes seemed like he wanted to talk, butnthen he would quickly turn cold. What if the rumors about him werentrue? As she turnednto do one last backstroke the lights all went out. She gasped loudly.nIt was only 4:45; the guard didn't make his rounds until 5:30pm,nwhen the last of the extracurricular programs finished. She thoughtnof a creepy story that Russell told her when she joined the swimnteam. He heard from a friend who had heard from his sister'snboyfriend that they once found a body in the pool. Russell blamed itnon Linderman, but the event supposedly happened five years earlier.nMaryanne was afraid to move, but she made it to the ledge. She hatednbeing in the dark and was getting cold and tired. \" Hello? Is someone there? I was still swimming! Please! Please put on the lights, I need to get out!\" Her echongreeted her from the tiled walls. She heard faint obnoxious laughterndraw closer, surrounding her and she recognized Moody and his gang.nHer eyes adjusted to the darkness, there were slivers of light comingnfrom under the locker room doors and eerily lighting the pool. Shentried to climb the ledge but was pushed down; Moody grabbed hernacross the chest and held her tightly. \"Younthink you're something special don'tnya? You like telling Daniels about me huh? Huh?\" His tone was vicious and Maryanne grew verynafraid. \"Moody! Getnoff of me! I did what I had to! You deserved it! You...!\" Her sentence went unfinished. Moody dunked her andnheld her under. She became frantic and thrashed and kicked. Hisnfriends were getting edgy; he was taking the joke too far. \"Moody! Let'sngo!\" Billy shouted. His group was already inching toward the exit, butnMoody paid no attention. He needed to make a point. He let Maryannenresurface and she cried out. She tried to swim away but Moody yankednher back. \" Shutnup! Thanks to you I got a week of detention and I'm grounded for two!nI'll show you what happens when you mess with Moody!\" \" No! Please don't…She burbled, as her body was thrust under again. His friends ran to the exit as he dunked hernagain. \" C'mon Moody! She's just a girl, man! The guard is gonna come and I'mnnot getting suspended man!\" The lightsnshot on and they all ran away. Maryanne tried to release Moody'snarms. She flailed and kicked, then pretended to go limp. Moodynfinally let go and she faintly heard their sneakers pounding on thentiles toward the exit. Maryanne was dizzy and sank to the bottom; shenhad lost the strength and breath to resurface, her mind and bodynstill tingled with fear. Panic set in as she desperately but feeblynswam upward. She noticednthe water get agitated and saw someone swimming quickly to her in antorrent of bubbles. The figure powerfully clutched her waist; henkicked off the floor in short bursts until they broke the surface.nGasping, she threw her arms around the neck of her rescuer. He pattednher back firmly until she choked up the water she swallowed. She sanknher head on his shoulders and clung to him. The gym lights blindednher and she started crying. Her rescuer was big, he allowed her tonwrap hers legs around him and they floated for a few minutes near thenledge, he whispered quietly to soothe her. \" Shhhh …itsnall right, I have you…just hold on, I won't let you go.\" Maryannenreturned to her senses and realized something was very familiar aboutnhim. She pulled away and looked directly into the concerned face ofnRicky Linderman. She bit her lip and began to cry more, she startednsinking again and he pulled her tighter against him. She laid hernhead back on his shoulder, and felt his cheek brush her hair. Theirnfaces inched closer, but before she could speak he hoisted her ontonthe ledge. Feeling solid ground, she crawled away and collapsed in anheap. She was oblivious to him kneeling beside her until he pattednher shoulder. She sat up abruptly, remembering Moody's attack. Shenpanicked again and jumped to her feet. She grabbed a life preservernand held it before her as a shield. Ricky didn't flinch at her confused behavior. Henstood motionless. His grungy, white tee shirt was plastered to hisnbody revealing a burgeoning muscular physique, and his hair wasnpushed back from his face. His sharp eyes remained focused on her. Henstepped toward her, his mouth hanging open slightly, a naturalnfeature of his nearly chiseled face. Maryanne wentninto alarm mode. She threw the preserver on the floor between them. nNearly two months of pent-up frustration and a near-death experiencenwas too much for her to take. \" AAAAAAAAAUGGHHHHHH! Go ahead! You want your turn Huh? Inhaven't got all day you big, dumb freak!\" She said the words with all the ferocity she couldnmuster then quickly sniffled and became hushed. She knew she didn'tnmean them. Linderman understood, and a slow, deliberate smile spreadnacross his face. His eyes danced in amusement. She was stunned.nLinderman? The morose misfit of Sheepshead High School, was smiling? To top it off, it was the most beautiful smile she had ever seen,nwith long, white teeth. It changed his whole demeanor. Maryannenlooked down in shame, and then slowly raised her eyes to his, outsidenshe was shivering, but inside her body turned very warm. He wasn'tnthe raving lunatic, or calculating killer that everyone painted himnto be. He was a lifesaver and he was her hero. A fantasticnidea popped in her head, he would have to be willing to do it. ' Mynbodyguard! Ricky Linderman could be my bodyguard!'[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Andepressed monster Ricky trudgednhome cold and damp, his jacket offered little warmth. With every stepnhe heard a squishing noise from his soggy boots. The sun had set in anhaze of orange and purple and the winds picked up. Metal trash lidsnrolled in the streets. Leaves and debris whipped around like minintornadoes. Ricky zipped up his jacket and kept his hands in itsnpockets. His hair was nearly dry and blew in all directions. Henpassed all the te-amos and rinky-dink take-outs and housing projects.nAll around him people were shopping, drinking and shouting. Life innthis neighborhood never seemed to change. His area was alwaysnchillier than most, right near the beach. Rickynhiked along under the train, past the amusement park, and onto thenboardwalk. He often came late-nights to think alone. The park closednin September. The screams of roller-coaster riders and smells ofnpopcorn, hot dogs and cotton candy were a memory until May. Rickynpreferred the beach without all the noises and flashing lights. Henenjoyed the solitude. The later it became, the more the 'nightncrawlers' appeared. That was Ricky's nickname for the bums,ndrunks, prostitutes and drug dealers; they used the area like anbreeding ground. He spotted them under the boardwalk, the abandonednlots of boarded up rides and in the hallways condemned buildings. Thennight crawlers usually left Ricky alone. His height and build keptnthem at a distance. Ricky sat down on a bench by the hot dog andnknish Palace and mulled over his situation. He preferred to be anloner. The other students kept away and he didn't approach them. Hencared very little about their activities and what went on among them.nIt was all high school fluff that would be forgotten. The last monthnproved to be very different. The new girl, Maryanne Peach, had madenit her mission to know him and talk to him and he didn't know why. \"Shenmust be so curious; she probably thinks its big joke to get to knownthe class murderer.\" He thought wryly. Hendidn't get bitter; he couldn't be sure what her motives were yet.nHe thought back to his first day in English class, he rememberedneveryone's faces and their comments. \" Yuck!nIt's Linderman! He's so gross.\" \" Don'tngo near him, he'll kill you!\" \" Inheard he raped...\" Rickyntried to ignore them, but their cruel remarks played over and overnlike a broken record. He remembered how Maryanne stared at him; herndeep, dark eyes bore through to his heart. She was a tiny girl,nalways lost among throngs of students during hall passing. Her hairnbob contoured her delicate, heart shaped face. He was taken with hernthe moment their eyes met. Asnthe waves rollicked back and forth, Ricky suspended her image in hisnmind. He smiled in spite of himself and felt his cheeks warm up, anfeeling he never truly had before. She was the victim of Moody'snwrath from the beginning, yet she carried herself with boldness andnconfidence. At lunch she kept sitting at his empty table, everyonenknew there wasn't a soul where he chose to be. She always tried soninnocently to get his attention, his help, and possibly, hisnfriendship. Rickynwas touched. He was developing a fondness for her, more than henwanted to admit. He wasn't making the friendship too easy for her.nHe barely said more than four words at a time. She would getnfrustrated, but she wasn't a quitter and he admired her for it.nSometimes Maryanne seemed spoiled, but he felt like his distance wasnhumbling her. Ricky'snthoughts shifted to the events of the day. He slipped off the benchnand onto the sand. He plopped down just far enough from thenshoreline. The full moon cast a pale glow across the ocean. Henstretched his legs out recounting everything. Rickynwas requested to stay after school by Mr. Groscher, a part-timencounselor and psychiatrist. Ricky secretly thought he was one of thencoolest adults in the school. He had a blunt, no holds barrednattitude and asked open-ended questions. If you didn't respond henwould make you sit there until the session was over. Ricky suspectednhe was waiting for him to return to school. He always felt Groschernwanted to peer into his mind, but Ricky put up a mental wall. -O- Groschernkept him almost an hour and told him, \"Sincenyour vocabulary is limited to one-syllable words, we'll stick withnone-syllable answers.\" Hengave Ricky a mirror. \"Tellnme what you see, Ricky.\" \"Me.\" Groschernput it back in his hands and coaxed him sternly. \"Look harder. You know what I see? Let's start physically. A young man, highnbrow, blue eyes, strong jawed, tan, tall and muscular, what womannwouldn't want that?\" Rickynrolled his eyes, but kept focused on the mirror. He knew he wasn'tna dog face. \"Let'sngo deeper. I see a real trooper, a kid with great potential who'snmechanically inclined and talented. I see someone who never used tonbe afraid of life, until bad circumstances handed him the crap end ofnthe stick. What does he do afterwards? He gives up, and is ceasingnto exist! You can't change the past Ricky. You have to see that you are stillnalive.\" Rickyngrew exasperated and flung the mirror down. \"I don't see any of that! I see a born loser! A loser who murders…a giant monster! That's what I am!\" \"Don't pissnon my foot and tell me it's raining! Ricky, you are a human beingnthat got caught up in rotten situation. I don't believe any ofnthose rumors. What everyone else thinks is worth spit, because I knownfor a fact it's not true. You know it too, but you go around andnlet the world dictate to you who you are.\" Groschernhad made some headway with Ricky. He handed him his card and told himnhe would be scheduling a 'real' professional appointment with himnfree of charge. Ricky left feeling a little better, after thensession, he bummed around the football field and watched the guysnpractice. Coach Johnson always begged him to join the team. A youngnman with his strength and stamina would have been an enormous asset.nRicky refused, although knowing that with a little training he couldnout-run and tackle down even the biggest of them. He had no spiritnfor high school sports; it all played out like a big joke to him. Allnthe so-called sports stars wound up middle aged meatheads thatnirritated their wife and kids. They remained stuck in the past,nforever bragging about the winning touchdowns and homeruns. Theynforever regretted where life took them and made sure their familynsuffered the same regret. That was Ricky's dad. A few months afternChris died, his parents separated, and remained so today. Ricky hadnalready felt his family unraveling before he left. Aboutnthe time of helping Maryanne, Ricky was getting some books from thengym locker room. As he was leaving, he heard Moody and his friends.nHe peeked into the poolroom, and saw Moody pushing her into thenwater. Ricky was the one who put on the lights to scare them away.nAnd the rest is history. Rickynshivered as the surf pounded harder. He wasted no time to help her.nShe thanked him profusely. She kept insisting that she would make itnup to him and she wanted him to ride home with her. Ricky refused,nbut he didn't leave her alone until her ride arrived. It was firstnclass all the way for Maryanne Peache, and he was not about to putnhis soggy bottom on the sharp leather interior. They didn't talk verynmuch, but one thing she told him was that, \"Innsomething I've heard, whenever a person saved another's life,nthat person was bound to him forever.\" Rickynnever saved anyone's life before and the thoughts that followednfrightened him. \" Whatnif I hadn't been there?\" \" WhatnIf I found her dead?\" Tomorrownhe would have to face her again. A low rumble in the distance alertednhim to leave. He wiped off the sand and headed home. -O- When Rickynentered his mom was fast asleep on the worn and tan love seat.n'Family Feud' blared from the television. A burning cigarette laynin the tin ashtray between two other half-smoked butts. At her feetnwas a bottle of Jack Daniels, nearly empty. His mom had taken tondrinking and smoking again. Ricky turned the television off; his momnshifted, but remained sleeping. Alcohol always affected her that way.nThe clock read 8:45pm. Ricky slowly lifted her up. His mom was alwaysna beautiful, buxom woman, but now she was frail. Although stillnattractive, the ravages of stress were taking over. Ricky felt sonmuch pity to see her in this condition. He carried her to her bed,nput the covers over her and left the room. Rickynflung off his coat and adjusted the shades of his windows down. Henclicked on a small lamp. His room was a pale olive green. The colorngreen was his favorite; it had a soothing effect on him. Posters ofnrock bands, a few movies and old time sports stars dotted the walls.nHis dark wood shelves were lined with 8-tracks, records and books.nRicky had a liking for classics such as Frankenstein, The hunchbacknof Notre Dame and Phantom of the Opera, stories of outcasts likenhimself. Hisndesk was strewn with schoolbooks, automotive magazines and papersnwith scribbles and crossed out writings. He had one dresser. Therenwere pictures of him, his brother Chris and their parents in happierntimes that collected dust. Ricky paid little mind to his surroundingsnnow. There was a time when he enjoyed this room. Putting up thenlatest posters, buying the hottest records and seeing popular movies,nnow it was a nuisance. As the rumors about him spread, most of hisnfriends avoided him and eventually dropped him altogether. Evennparents feared him somewhat. Nobody dared ask what the truth was ornbothered to notice his growing depression. Rickynstripped down and threw his clothes in a large milk crate off to thencorner. Above the crate was a stop sign Chris had stolen on a darenand in the opposite corner was a bright yield sign that Ricky covetednfrom the junkyard. As he stepped into the shower he admitted tonhimself that his mother must still care for him. She did his laundrynand fed him well. Every so often she would toss him a new pack ofnunderwear, socks or tee shirts, or brought him soap and otherntoiletries. Ricky earned decent money himself often by doing odd jobsnin the junkyards and mechanic shops he frequented. Thenhot shower revived him. Afterwards, Ricky made himself a sandwich andnstarted his homework. He finished quickly. In the past, his teachersnhad always commended his intelligence; he just needed to focus more. Rickyncould hardly believe he was back in school. Mr. Groscher had made annunexpected call a few months earlier. Ricky didn't touch on thentragedy; he didn't have to. He felt the whole world knew. Thenrumors didn't stop Mr. Groscher from showing empathy. He pointednout that whatever happened that night, Ricky Linderman wasnstill alive .nIf he played his cards right he had a long life ahead of him on God'sngreen earth and he needed to use it in the best way possible.nGroscher focused on Ricky that night, not what everyone thought ofnhim, but rather, what he had to offer as a person. After revealingnsome of his ambitions, Ricky made a conscious decision to return tonschool for the last term of 1980. Rickynswitched off his chrome lamp and hopped into bed. He was wiped out.nOn any other night, he would be compelled not to come home. He sometimes slept in an abandoned '76 station wagonnat the junkyard. Home was not a pleasant place. Oftentimes, thenatmosphere kept Ricky away. His mom still treated him like a rovingnphantom. She was lost in her own depression. He began to believe innhis heart that was all he deserved to be. Tonight, however, annunusually sweet slumber engulfed him.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Tragedy revealed After the swimming incident, Maryanne quit the team. She didn't tell anyone what had happened. She told Ms. Vitale that she wanted to concentrate on her first love of dancing. This was mostly the truth. In her junior year, Maryanne secured a scholarship to a prestigious performing arts college in Upstate New York. She didn't want anything to interfere with her goal. Once Moody realized she wasn't a ghost, and that she didn't go to the authorities or school officials, the harassment gradually started again. His warped sense of pride would not let himself be beaten by a snobby little girl. Maryanne stuck by her friends like Shelly, Russell and Paul. Russell half-jokingly called them 'MIV's' or, 'Moody's innocent Victims.' To Maryanne's delight Shelly ended her blind crush on him. Paul admitted that Moody cut his violin strings in tenth grade and he cried the whole week. The 'MIV' list grew along with Maryanne's anger when she heard more stories. She tried to rally more support against him, but Moody reigned king. During lunch on Friday, Maryanne sat idly in the auditorium watching the cheerleaders. They skipped around in their Daisy Dukes and chanting. \"Their team is so slow, but our team- Let's Go! Wooh! Wooh! Wooh!\" If the other team was slow, then this high school was in trouble. The girls were laughing and all out of sync. Mrs. Hanson was trying to lead them, but her presence was better suited in a classroom. A thought struck Maryanne. If anyone could set the story straight on Linderman, she could. Teachers were usually above the scandalous rumors of students. Maryanne went down the aisle and climbed upon the stage. Mrs. Hanson was resting the back and placing her sandals on. \"Hi, Maryanne, did you enjoy that?\" Maryanne laughed. \"It was certainly interesting. I wanted to know if I could speak to you.\" Mrs. Hanson invited her to sit down. It was hard for Maryanne to open the conversation but her desire for answers overcame her fear. \"It's about another student in our class. All the students are saying terrible things about him, I mean, they're afraid of him, but I don't want to be.\" \"Have you spoken to anyone else about him?\" She asked knowingly. \"Yes, and I can't believe everything they say is all true, especially not now.\" Asking Mrs. Hanson to keep the matter in strictest confidence, Maryanne related what happened in Science class, in the cafeteria, and even the pool. She kept the pool incident low-key. She decided against using names and was glad that Mrs. Hanson didn't press her for them. Mrs. Hanson listened calmly, and was surprised at the outcome. \"Now Maryanne, after your experiences with him, do you really believe that Ricky Linderman would have done all the things he's accused of?\" \" No! It's so ridiculous. Breaking cop's legs? You would think he'd be in jail. Do you know why they say all this stuff, Mrs. Hanson? I know something happened, something bad. I can see it in his face.\" Mrs. Hanson took note of the deep sincerity in her voice and decided to share the tragic story. \" It was about a year ago. Ricky and his brother Chris were home alone. They found their father's gun and it accidentally went off and killed Chris. Ricky found the body. The story made it to the papers and the evening news.\" Maryanne took a sharp breath because she wanted to sob. This was his dark secret. Flabbergasted, she stood up. The lunch period was ending. \"Thank You Mrs. Hanson, I'm glad I talked to somebody who knew the truth.\" \"You're welcome Maryanne. It's nice to know Ricky has someone he can call a friend.\" They walked out together and Mrs. Hanson went up to the second floor. Maryanne crossed her arms and leaned on the wall, lost in thought. Being Ricky Linderman's friend had not really crossed her mind and she felt very guilty. Could she befriend him? Would he allow her to? She was certainly going to try now. -O- As she turned the corner near the gym, Maryanne halted. Moody and Stan were leaning against the sports heroes' display. She spun around and headed to the other exit, but their voices were growing closer and she panicked. She looked both ways and quickly barreled into a bathroom. It looked and smelled like the janitor took a permanent vacation. She jumped into the third stall from the left and slightly crouched on the toilet. The door swung open and Moody and Stan strolled in. It hit her with dismay that she was in the boy's bathroom. The two stood over the sink combing their hair. They kept gabbing about hot chicks. Stan fawned over Debbie Johnson in English class. Moody agreed that she was a girl who knew he wouldn't, \"Take no for an answer.\" Maryanne shifted to keep her balance; she picked at her overall buttons praying they would leave. Their voices drifted away and the door shut. She sighed and stepped from the stall. Moody and Stan were waiting against the door, arms crossed, with mean smirks. She was in for it now. She backed into the door of an occupied stall and groaned. Moody waltzed up to her while Stan locked the main door. \"See Stan, I knew she was a butch, look at her in the boys bathroom!\" Stan did a 'nyuck, nyuck' laugh. \"Nah, Maybe this is the only way she can a date?\" Moody's dark eyes pierced through her. \" No! I think she likes drinking out of our toilets, the water tastes better, since that's the case…\" Moody punched the stall she had been hiding in. \"Let's give her a drink! Come here, Stan!\" Stan sauntered over and snatched her right arm and Moody her left. Maryanne struggled, but they were stronger. \" Get off! Please Help!\" She shouted loudly. They kept laughing and dragged her toward the toilet. She planted her feet solidly on the tile, and in a desperate move pulled her body backwards, crouching for more resistance. She wasn't going down without a fight. \"This chick doesn't give up!\" Moody lurched on her arm and she stumbled forward. The occupied stall was flushed, and like a giant awakened, Ricky Linderman popped up instantly. He tossed his barely smoked cigarette in the bowl and put on his jacket. Moody and Stan dropped Maryanne's arms and she fell on her behind. \"Hey Stan, let's get some lunch, okay?\" Linderman remained silent. He strutted from the stall to the sink and washed his hands very carefully, even digging under his fingernails. He was stalling until they left. They elbowed each other and headed for the door. Moody couldn't resist a last comment. \"Hey Maryanne, we'll make sure to catch up to ya again soon.\" Maryanne dusted herself off. The whole scene was amazing. Ricky never said a word and they backed off in a heartbeat. She knew he had to help her. Ricky finished and stalked out. \" Oh no you don't!\" She said aloud. She hurried after Ricky; his gait was quick and she ran to keep up his pace. He headed straight out of school on the side of the football field. Maryanne stopped short. Even though the bell rang five minutes ago she didn't want to cut class. \" Grrr! Ricky skipped out and he's my lab partner!\" She thought angrily. She left the building and caught him cutting across toward the bleachers. She called to him. \" Linderman! Ricky! Ricky! Please wait, I just want to talk to you! Please!\" Ricky heard the desperation in her voice and reluctantly slowed down. He clicked his teeth and came to a halt; she always had an effect on him. \"What do you want, Maryanne? I already told you, I did what I did, and you don't have to keep thanking me. Why do you keep following me?\" He moved closer as a gesture of intimidation. Maryanne didn't flinch; he already proved he wasn't going to hurt her when he saved her life. \"Ricky, I want to ask you something important. You know Moody has been out to get me for a while, you heard his threat before, It's becoming way too much, I'm… scared.\" She looked down and swallowed hard, fighting back tears. She traced lines in the dust. \"I'm listening.\" Ricky said finally. A gut feeling attacked him; he couldn't deny that he was seriously attracted to her. \"I wanted to know if…you'd be my bodyguard. I would pay you of course! Fifty cents a day, and I can do your homework, I'm pretty smart, maybe the others will see you're not what they thought and hire you too. I have it planned out.\" Ricky looked at her incredulously. He didn't want all this pressure. The old familiar feeling of worthlessness sprang upon him. \"I…I don't think so.\" He went back into school to get some tools from his locker. She followed and did a semi-dance around him. Ricky forced himself not to look at her. \"Ricky… all I want ...\" He spun around. \"Do you always get what you want?\" The comment caught her off guard, but she didn't give up. \"Okay, forget me , you'd be helping everyone in school! It could really be to your advantage. You would be a hero! You're my hero Ricky. I want to be your friend, I owe you my life.\" She spoke the last part about friendship and her life softly. For a moment they looked tenderly into each other's eyes, and then Maryanne proceeded begging. \" Please! I promise I won't bother you anymore, I know you don't want to be bothered; I know what happened to your brother and you…\" Ricky's eyes flashed but his tone remained calm as he cut her off. \"Oh you do, huh?\" Maryanne looked away sheepishly, then back up at him. There was a glowing intensity in her face. \"Okay, I only heard about it. I'm sorry. It must have been awful to know he died and you weren't able to do anything about it. You feel like it's your fault don't you? I know you do, and sometimes everyone around you make you feel that way too.\" Ricky listened for a moment in curiosity. She depicted his exact mind-set but it was like she took it personally. Maryanne snapped out of her thoughts. Her almond eyes implored him. Ricky couldn't say 'no' to her. He wanted a friend. \" Alright Peache...Maryanne, I'll do it for fifty cents a day until your big plan is over with.\" Maryanne smiled brightly. As the last bell rang she jumped up and kissed him on the cheek. She caught him off guard and he grabbed her. He held her off the ground and their faces nearly touched. Maryanne took the opportunity and hugged him tight. \"Thank you so much! You're a life saver!\" She waved goodbye and ran to her locker. Ricky was dumbfounded. He had no idea what he was getting himself into. He softly touched his cheek and smiled.[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Bully standoff \" He would not have stopped then for anything less necessarynthan breath. It being a spectral sort of race that he ran, and onenhighly desirable to get to the end of. He had a strong idea that thencoffin he had seen was running after him. And pictured his hopping onnbehind him, bolting upright on its narrow end always on the point ofnovertaking him and hopping on at his side, perhaps taking his arm.\" \" It was a pursuer to shun. It hid in doorwaysntoo; rubbing its horrible shoulders against doors and drawing them upnto its ears as if it were laughing. It got into shadows on the roadnand lay cunningly on its back to trip him up. All this time it wasnincessantly hopping on behind him, gaining on him. So, that when thenboy got to his own door he had reason for being half-dead.\" Mrs. Hansonnclosed the book, allowing the class a moment to meditate on thenpassages. Maryanne peeked at Ricky. His desk was still near thenwindow, the sunlight reflected off his blue eyes. Today he had gottennmore comfortable and removed his jacket. He was wearing a light bluenbutton down shirt over a clean white T-shirt, dark blue jeans and hisnboots. She thought he looked handsome. She examined the smallnv-shaped scar on his cheek and wondered how he had gotten it. The passagenplayed in Maryanne's mind. She imagined Ricky as the boy beingnchased by the coffin of his dead brother. The imagery of the passagenwas frightening. Did Ricky feel death lingering over his head? Shennoticed he was sketching in his notebook, but she couldn't see itnwithout making a disturbance. Mrs. Hanson asked the class for theirnopinions and ideas on the meaning. Maryanne began thinking ofnherself. She sometimes felt like this boy, when she thought of hernmother. In her mother's last days she gave her constant care andnattention, right up until she found her dead in the morning, drenchednin vomit. Maryanne suffered with that image for a long time, hernmother's mouth open and eyes rolled to the back of her head. Shenhad fought long and hard to forget it, but it came back in a flash. \"Maryanne,ndo you have a comment?\" Maryanne didnnot realize her hand was up, but she did have a comment to make, hernvoice was shaky. \"I don'tnthink it has to be his own death that's chasing him. It could benthe death of someone he loved, and he knows everyday he could havenprevented it, now it's always on his mind and conscience. He cannotnescape the coffin because it mocks him and makes him feel guilt.\" \"That is anvery interesting thought, can anyone build on that?\" The rest ofnthe period dragged on; Maryanne wished the topic was lighter. Thenpassage was from Dickens' 'A tale of two cities.' They would benreading that next. When the bell rang, she watched Ricky crush thenpaper he drew on and toss it in the garbage pail. He glanced her way,ngave her a small smile and left. Maryanne reached into the pail onnher way out and quickly removed it. She examined it while walking thenhalls. Ricky had drawn a large coffin with a bullet hole in the sidenand a stick figure running. Underneath was a drawing that resemblednhim in a coffin. It disturbed her. She tore it in pieces and threw itnin a bigger garbage pail; the rest of her day was gloomy. -O- Itnwas now Friday afternoon, the day she would show up Moody toneveryone. In school she barely contained her excitement. She spreadnthe word to everyone to be at 'Joe's' the local hangout a few blocks from school. Russell and Shellyndemanded to know what was up, she told them to get as many people tonas they could, then just watch for the outcome. After science,nMaryanne left with Ricky to talk over her plan. \"Younremember what you have to do, don't you?\" Ricky heaved a sigh and rolled his eyes. \"Maryanne,nI'm not a dunce, you only told me fifty times, I wait in the alley across thenstreet and when you lead them all there, I popnout!\" Rickyncomically kicked his foot out and cocked his head with a big grinnlike a court jester. Maryannengiggled aloud. \"Please! Notnlike that, then we'll both be in trouble!\" \"Why not, itnmight just freak them out.\" He laughed. As theynentered the alley, Ricky grew serious again. He put a hand on hernshoulder. \"Don'tnworry, I got you covered. Moody is a coward, and his friends onlynfollow the leader. Everything will be okay.\" He left hernside to hide behind an empty, green dumpster. He complained loudly. \" EWWWW! What is that god-awful smell? Maryanne, you better hurry back 'causenit stinks!\" \"SorrynRicky, I'm going now!\" She leaped across the avenue and marched to thenwindow of Joe's. The place was packed, even for a Friday. Shellynand Russell did their jobs. Inside, Moody and his gang took up annentire counter in the center, eating and laughing. Moody nudged Billy. \"Watch this!\" \"HeynShelly!\" Shelly wasnsipping coke and engaged in a pleasant conversation with anothernclassmate, Victor Luft. She turned to Moody. \"Whatndo you want?\" \"Shelly, I'mnsorry about the problems I've given ya, I wanna take ya to a show.\" Shellynsquinted at him, she wasn't sure she could trust him at all, but henwas her biggest crush in her high school life. \"Okay... what?\" \"I'll meet you there actually, you like dogsnby the way? Cuz that's what it is, it's a dog show.\" Shelly smiled.n\"I love them! I have a cocker spaniel.\" \" Good, when you get there, ask for a number and a booth.\" \" Umm, why do I need a booth, Moody?\" Moody and the whole table burst out harshly. \"Where elsenare they gonna put a mutt like you!\" They all wentnhysterical, Shelly wanted to cry, and she now officially hated MelvinnAbergo. Victor made an angry motion to defend her, but she quicklynput her hand on his. she spotted Maryanne at the window and didn'tnwant anything she was planning to be ruined. Maryannenwaltzed right up to their table. She grabbed the mustard and ketchupnand squirted Billy, Stan and another buddy of theirs named Carter.nShe grabbed Moody's milkshake and dumped it on his head. Everyonenwas in shock, but wild cheers quickly erupted. Maryanne held onto thenmustard and ketchup giving a few last squirts and ran for her lifenback to Ricky. Moody and the rest jumped up and chased her intononcoming traffic. The cars swerved and honked to avoid hitting thensudden hordes of teenagers rushing behind them. Maryanne madenit to the alley, panting; Moody was right on her tail and shoved hernroughly. \"Looknwhat you did, you tramp!\" \"Yeah! This was a new shirt!\" Carter chimednin. Maryanne keptnbacking toward the Dumpster as they circled her. All the othernstudents stood at a distance. \"I hope shenknow what she's doing, I say we jump them if they attack.\" Shellynwhispered to Victor and Russell. Victor nodded,nand whispered to the others around them, they all stood tough. Just as theynmade a grab for her, Ricky stepped out and took his place behindnMaryanne. He put his strong, reassuring hands gently on hernshoulders. All four of them backed away. Staying as close to Ricky asnpossible, she folded her arms smugly. \"Moody, I'dnlike you to meet my bodyguard, anything you have to say to me, youncan tell it to him first.\" Everyonenclapped. Moody turned a beet red, and huddled with his friends.n\"C'mon guys, we can take em!\" \"Sorry,nMoody\" They mumbled and waved him off. Moody shooknwith anger and embarrassment. \"C'monnBilly, Stan? He's just one guy and a midget girl, we could do this!nDon't leave me hanging man!\" \"Sorry BignM, you're on your own.\" Billy put hisnhands up in defeat. They stalked away, trying to avoid the glaringncrowds. Moody sucked in his chest and stared intensely at Maryanne. \"I'mngonna really getnyou, your bodyguard won't be around all the time!\" Maryannenlooked up to Ricky, \"You'llnnever know when I'm there or not…\" He threatened. \"Why don'tnyou beat it, Moody?\" Maryannengave the last words, \"Oh, and by the way, Melvin, your protection services are no longer needed, bynanyone.\" All thenstudents hooted again. Russell bravely stepped out of the crowd,nsquashing a blue bag. \"You owe mena year's worth of lunches!\" He took hisnbeloved cheese doodles and crunched it on Moody's head, thennquickly ran behind Linderman's Jacket. Moody growled and ran away. Everyonensurrounded Ricky and Maryanne laughing, telling him how cool it wasnthat they stood up to his gang. Russell clapped Ricky on the back andnRicky glared at him for a split second. \"The little hypocrite.\"nhe thought, but then let it go. Maybe this was what he needed.nMaryanne was right; they didn't fear him now. He still didn't letndown his guard when they separated from the crowd. Maryanne,nhowever, was euphoric; she danced around the sidewalk, all pumped up. \"Thatnwas terrific! Did you see his face? And Russell with his cheese doodles! That was a great touch. This is only the beginning. We are not going to let up untilnhe pays back every cent he owes! We…\" Ricky stoppednher abruptly in mid hop. He pointed to himself and down to her. \" We are not doing anything.\" Maryanne'snface fell, but she pressed forward as he sauntered away. \"Ricky,nlook at all the good we did! It's...\" He gave anstrict glance, his mouth went tight and his eyes widened. \"LooknMaryanne, show's over, okay?\" \"What show? That wasn't any show! Ricky, I thought we were like a team now.\" Ricky didn'tnstop moving, but he circled and told her walking backwards, \"You thoughtnwrong.\" He disappearednfrom view. Maryanne stopped following and kicked at a wall. Didn'tnhe understand that she needed him? She wasn't going to let him getnaway so easily. She adored him despite his indifference. Shenunderstood now that he was suffering terribly inside from a freaknaccident. She knew that underneath his green 'depression coat',nwas a wonderful young man. She wanted to bring him out. Rickyndeserved every chance to be happy and she desired to make him so.[Chapter 9] Chapter 9: Ricky's world For the next few days, Ricky kept ducking Maryanne. She folded and unfolded her arms impatiently; Charles had been driving her halfway around the City to follow him. She never took her eyes off him, as he lumbered through the crowds and grime. This was the area he preferred to hang out in. The people around wore long faces, some angry, some were depressed, and many just void of expression. Each block Ricky passed seemed dirtier than the next. Rotted trash piled up on the curbs. The smell of sour fruit and vegetables mixed with backed up sewers permeated everywhere. There was a constant barrage of noise from the automotive shops and warehouses that lined the streets. Maryanne felt pity for the children that played on the stoops, dodging broken glass and garbage. The smells entered the car; Charles, being over-dramatic, pulled his handkerchief and covered his nose and mouth. \"You know Maryanne; I could lose my job for this. Even a criminal wouldn't be caught dead here. Couldn't you have fallen in love with a preppie or something?\" Maryanne gave him a look but made no protests. Ricky suddenly made a sharp turn on a deserted corner. She rolled down the window excitedly. \"Charles! Turn here! Turn here!\" Traffic was building up at the intersection and he was stuck three cars behind. There was a slight collision ahead of them and a fight broke out between the drivers. Charles glanced at the street. \"Maryanne, I can't it's one-way, let's just forget it.\" Before he could say more, Maryanne leaped from the car, ignoring his warning calls. She sprinted after Ricky. The block turned into a winding alley of abandoned buildings. Ricky weaned around corners until she was hopelessly lost. Her frustration turned to agitation. Homeless men of all sorts were sprawled around glaring at her. Ricky passed them by as if they were pieces of debris. They were demanding money. One of them spotted Maryanne. \"Hey Sugar! Give us a dollar!\" The other two beside him chimed in. \"Yeah baby, hand over a buck, c'mon ...give it here!\" Maryanne ran faster past them, her heart beating wildly. She hoped they wouldn't follow. Ricky made another turn and Maryanne skidded to a halt at the corner. Ricky's hand popped out and grabbed her. \" Hey! What are you following me for?\" Maryanne moved closer to him, feeling secure at last. \"I only wanted to talk to you.\" \"I already told you, Maryanne, once your plan finished, I was finished. Find yourself another bodyguard.\" He stalked away again. This was very tiresome for Maryanne; she tried to remain calm, and decided maybe Ricky thought he was being used. \"Ricky, it's not like that, I really appreciate everything you did, and you didn't even take the money for it. I just want to be friends.\" She admitted glumly. Ricky stopped, but didn't turn around. If she weren't sincere, would she have gone through all this trouble? \"Friends huh? What's in it for you anyway? I don't have...I don't want a friend…especially you!\" He regretted the words as they flew from his mouth. He was lying. Why couldn't he trust anyone? She was hurt, but there was a fire in her eyes yet. \" Ok … OKAY! FINE! Forget it then! Who needs you anyway? You big...you big ape!\" She stomped around in a bad impression of him, making a long, ugly face, and hunching her shoulders. \" I'm Ricky Linderman and I don't like anyone , because I'm mean and don't give people a chance!\" She caught her breath, and saw Ricky laugh quickly. She put her hands on her hips. \"What is so funny? I'm serious!\" Her anger faded, and she soon was giggling, she quickly composed herself and walked backwards. \"I'll leave, but one more thing… Where am I? And how the heck do I get out of here?\" Ricky shook his head with resignation and his slow, cunning smile appeared. \" C'maaannnnnn!\" He drawled. Maryanne rushed to his side, relieved she didn't have to be alone. He took her to a rusted doorway. \"Promise me you won't pull this again, this place is bad.\" \"You're not kidding… oh wow! You work in here? That's neat.\" She walked into the room; shelves with spare parts and tools circled it. In the center was a big metal table and a black and gray motorbike was mounted on top. \"You like it?\" Ricky asked proudly. \" Yeah! It's so cool, did you build this?\" \"Rebuilt it. I've been working on it close to a year and I can't find this piece called a cylinder, it won't run without it.\" Maryanne's eyes lit up as she circled and gently touched the bike. Ricky was amazing. She imagined him working in the shop late at night, seeing his deft hands placing parts together by trial and error. This was the world Ricky belonged to, where he was most comfortable and alive. She felt a deep respect for him. She was the only person now privy to this world and she felt honored. \"Ricky! That's great! You should really make this a career. I bet you can fix anything. You're like an engineer!\" Ricky glowed, realizing she was truly impressed. \" Yeah... well, until she actually moves with an engine, I'm no engineer. Wanna get on?\" \"Sure!\" She climbed atop the table and sat delicately on the black leather seat. She grabbed the bars and the bike jerked back. Ricky quickly pulled the front down with his arm around her back. \" Woah! Careful.\" \"Ricky, we have to get this bike running. Maybe I can get you the cylinder. My dad can make calls to the best auto shops in the City.\" \"Thanks, but the piece is rare, they don't make them anymore. Every week I check the junkyards, ask the shop owners, there's nothing.\" She got off the bike and held out her arms. Ricky gingerly lowered her to the ground. He could not brush off the tiny sparks he felt when he held her. She insisted on ingratiating herself into his life and he actually wanted her to. For the first time since Chris' death, the idea of a friendship didn't scare him. Maryanne wiped some oil from her hands. \"This means we'll have to keep checking. Maybe all you need is another pair of eyes to help you.\" She playfully batted hers at him and he grinned. \"So what's your schedule Maryanne, when do you wanna start?\" Maryanne wished she could be with him everyday, but she had a lot of obligations to meet. Her father wanted her to stay with Ruth; besides the tendency to wander around the hotel, she was often caught flirting with the husbands. \"My dad expects me to play baby-sitter for 'Citizen Ruth' all the time, I can try to go one weekday and make free time on the weekends.\" \"Neat, that's plenty of time. Tomorrow's Saturday, we can start… umm ...who is 'Citizen Ruth'?\" Maryanne laughed. \"She's my grandmother, I'll tell you all about her, and maybe you can meet her one day.\" Ricky shrugged contentedly; as they left the area he explained what the cylinder looked like and Maryanne committed it to memory. Ricky escorted her all the way back to her end of the City by the St. George hotel. They parted excitedly; he had a strong feeling that together they would find it.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: On cylinders and love Nearly two months passed and Ricky and Maryanne kicked around almost every junkyard in the Brooklyn. In her mind Maryanne made it a fantasy. It was a quest scouring the scrap metal kingdoms; the bored princess was with a handsome knight, to save his gallant horse. She thought about what her mother once said about knights. She was wrong; Maryanne truly felt she had found hers. For both, it was a prime opportunity to build a solid friendship. They had more in common than either had imagined. They shared similar tastes in food, movies, books and music. Both Ricky and Maryanne had a maturity lacking in their peers. She shared some of her dark secrets about caring for her mother and the guilt that she carried when she wished she would just die. No matter how much medication her mother was given, her condition never improved. Maryanne understood when she caught her mother feebly trying to flush her pills. Ricky caved in and saw the school Dance Recital. He told her he thoroughly enjoyed it, especially her dances. Maryanne couldn't see him from the stage, but afterward she caught him standing outside with a small bouquet of yellow roses. He shyly admitted to them being his favorite. She was so touched, and wanted to kiss him, but a large crowd came by and the dancers all wanted to celebrate at dinner. When she had finally turned back to him, he was gone. She really hoped he would have come to the dinner. -Oo- It was a cold Saturday afternoon and spring was delaying. They huddled on the benches of 'Sal's Auto-Parts' sipping hot chocolate. Maryanne was bundled in a wool lined denim jacket, purple scarf and matching hat, and she wore finger-less black gloves and her old overalls. Ricky still had his green jacket, along with a chocolate brown scarf and earmuffs that she had bought for him early in the winter. A rainstorm the previous night made the ground saturated and moist. Maryanne noticed Ricky was growing more disgruntled with their search every week. She often tried her best to keep him laughing or occupied on a certain topic that was important to him, like cars and mechanics. \"This is going to make our hunt a little more messy...I didn't think I could get this dirty.\" Maryanne complained. \" Awwww, it's not that bad, God made dirt and dirt don't hurt. We made it through the snow didn't we? This is the last shop for the day anyway, I'm pooped…pooped and wiped!\" He kicked a rusted taillight to the left. Maryanne just looked at him and laughed hard. \" Ricky! You know what you just said?\" \"Yeah…I said I'm pooped and... awwww! Man! Sorry! But I hope everyone is, ya know?\" He hung his head low, but she saw his smile. \" Alright , whatever you say, I'm pooped and wiped too! Let's get started! Here, finish this.\" Ricky gulped the last of her hot chocolate down with his. Their friendship became so tight they were finishing each other's sentences and eating off each other's plates. Everyday at school, Ricky waited eagerly for her to come to lunch; she would bring him heroes and leftovers from the hotel. Science lab became more fun. They completely ignored Moody and Billy as well as the rumors of some students once again. Maryanne asked Shelly to keep her up to date on what they were saying. Nevertheless, many students now respected Ricky Linderman, slowly but surely he was coming out of his shell. In the new school semester, they shared history and English class. Maryanne was more and more attracted to him, but she never dared let on, she didn't want to spoil what they already had. They both stood in awe at the mountain before them. Ricky's eyes glowed. \"If it's not in this pile, then I don't think I'll ever find it.\" He mused. \"I'll go around and you take this side, give me a holler if you see something.\" Maryanne nodded and went to work, she picked at the pieces nearest to the bottom; she didn't like the way the mountain swayed. A familiar shape caught her eye jutting out from the middle. Maryanne ran to it and in her excitement skidded into a mud puddle. Ricky looked up when he heard the splash, and noticed that the mountain shifted. \" Ricky! I found something, I need your help!\" Ricky ran around slipping, when he saw Maryanne's position, he stopped short. Maryanne was not more than five inches away from the pile. She was trying to loosen her boot and unwittingly kicked it. If she hit it again, pieces could fall on her head or worse, the entire mountain would collapse. Ricky jutted his arms out in a stop motion. \" Maryanne! Don't move a muscle!\" Maryanne froze with her foot in an upright position. The mud was like a suction cup and it had been hard for her gain traction and stand up. Overhead, the metal collided and scraped with an unnerving sound. She quickly realized her situation. She glanced up frightened. \" Ohhhh! Ricky! Help me! It's going to fall! I'm stuck!\" She pleaded. Ricky ran up behind her and grabbed her arms. \"Just relax; I'm going to drag you out.\" Ricky gave a swift pull and hauled her through the mud. When they were far enough he tried to lift her, but they both slid and fell down again. A strong wind blew and some pieces fell, splattering them. A few bigger pieces followed and Ricky shielded her, however, they were out of harm's way. \" Maryanne! Are you Ok? Did you get hurt?\" Maryanne wiped the mud from her face and gave him a long hug. Still holding each other, they helped one another off the ground. \"Yeah, I'm okay, thanks to you.\" She looked up and shuddered, she could have been killed had she been stuck in the spot she was. She rubbed his shoulder reassuringly and looked around, spotting what she had found. She pulled it out and shook the gook from it. Ricky looked on curiously. Maryanne was beaming, and placed the object in his hand. Ricky looked down at the cylinder he needed. His entire face lit up and he threw his body back in laughter. With a victory shout, he jumped up in the air, waving it around. He put it aside and twirled Maryanne over his head. It thrilled her to see him that way. They were both flushed with excitement. \"Maryanne, you are gold! This is it! C'mon we have work to do!\" He pulled her hand and they ran away filthy and ecstatic. The next morning, they stood proudly in front of the completed motorbike. Ricky could not stop grinning from ear to ear the whole night; even his mother was forced to acknowledge him. Maryanne had bubbled over to her father and grandmother. She told Ruth everything about Ricky. Ruth was aglow and she begged Maryanne to invite him for dinner. -Oo- Today they were having their first ride. Satisfied with his handiwork, Ricky looked at Maryanne with a gleam in his eye. \"Hop on! It's time.\" Maryanne lingered, she had never done this before and it seemed too dangerous. Ricky put his hand out to her. \"C'mon, you just hold on tight and I promise I won't let you go.\" His words struck a chord in her. He had said them when he had rescued her in the pool. He had such a soft and soothing way of speaking when he wanted to. She got on behind him and clutched his waist, she trusted Ricky Linderman with her life. The next few hours were a whirlwind of fun. Ricky maneuvered the bike like an expert. They rode everywhere, cutting across parks and bridges. Ricky constantly turned his head to talk and she constantly begged him to watch the road. They circled through building walkways getting followed by guards and chasing a flock of pigeons. Ricky finally made a rest stop in a small park area. \"Alright Maryanne, your turn.\" Maryanne was stretching her body, \"Ooooh! My butt is numb!\" \"Yeah, me too, and so are my b... other parts.\" He mumbled. Ricky patted the front seat. Maryanne zipped up her jacket and walked over hesitantly. \"Get on…that a girl.\" Maryanne adjusted herself on the seat. Ricky sat down and held her waist lightly. He leaned in to readjust the settings and laid his chin on her shoulder \"Just keep your main focus on the road...you know, like I did?\" He joked. \" Oh, no! Then we'll both be chop meat, or ride off the bridge or something tragic like that! And then everyone will think we did it on purpose.\" \" Naahhh , you already know I can swim. Seriously, the bike practically rides itself, like a car. Do you drive?\" \"Not yet, but I get you.\" She was aware of the closeness of his handsome face and she struggled to keep from melting. \" Oh ...yeah, don't keep twisting the brake bar, otherwise we'll both be tossed off.\" Ricky sat back fast. She smelled so clean and sweet. She had gotten a hair trim and the ends all softly flipped around her face. He wanted to rest his head on her shoulder forever. \" Umm, I'll kick start it for you.\" He stood up and pushed his right leg down hard. The engine whirled. \"Whenever you're ready!\" Maryanne turned the handle and they took off. She felt free and weightless as the wind churned around them. Ricky kept telling her she was doing great. At times he would grab the handlebars to help her steer. They headed down the long stretch of Eastern Parkway. Ricky stood waving at all the curious and elderly onlookers resting along the benches. He lost his balance and sat down immediately, patting her shoulders. She was relieved. \"Listen Evil Kneivel! Stay put! You're scaring me!\" They finally stopped by a hot dog stand in Prospect Park. Maryanne insisted on buying lunch and Ricky didn't argue. They wolfed down two hot dogs with everything, potato chips and shared a giant pretzel with cheese. The sunset was magnificent and they both wished the day wouldn't end. After eating, Maryanne got up and did her dance stretches, her legs were stiff and her arms were achy. Ricky tried to copy her and she laughed at him. \" What? I can't be a dancer?\" He asked, pretending to be hurt. \"No, I picture you more as a runner, or maybe a swimmer... umm, mountain climber, ohhh, maybe a body builder.\" She giggled coyly at the thought. \"Wow, I think I'm pretty buff, if I do say so myself.\" Ricky flexed his muscles in all directions and they laughed. They continued to talk on the bench; Maryanne harped on her grandmother the most. \"...She's so cool, so alive ...I think I know what scares her the most.\" \"What, growing old, dying?\" \"No, not being alive , she's such a restless spirit, she just wants to make everything right in the world in her own little way.\" \"Sounds like someone I know.\" Ricky said, sipping his soda. Maryanne shrugged shyly. \"A lot of people that know us say we're alike...well sometimes. I think she's way too flamboyant. Maybe it's just a roaring twenties thing. Old people are to be respected because they've lived their lives.\" \"Yeah, I guess it gives them the right to be kooky and grouchy and stuff. \" Ricky mumbled through chews. \"Okay, enough about me, what about you, Ricky? Tell me about your brother Chris.\" She sat Indian style on the bench and close to him. Ricky leaned back with his legs sprawled in front of him. His face drooped slightly, but he didn't avoid the question. He talked about his parents and their home life. He and Chris were inseparable at times, and then they could almost hate each other. His parents loved each other, but weren't 'Ozzie and Harriet.' They fought frequently; getting worse as the years wore on. His dad became more and more an alcoholic and would lash out on them. Once Ricky reached his size he backed off of him, but Chris received the brunt of his anger. Ricky would try to protect him, but it only made situations worse. Ricky gave them some credit and he still loved them. They weren't the worst parents. They just started falling apart and no one knew how to fix them. \"Sometimes I felt that Chris was changing. He was getting more reckless and disobedient. I wasn't the angel , but he took things too far sometimes. He was afraid of our dad. He's in the construction business, 6'5 and pure muscle. Chris always hid behind me to protect him. Most of the time I did, but when he got me mad, I let dad give it to him. It was spiteful and I regret it now.\" Ricky sighed and got silent for a moment. The setting sun was hitting his eyes. He stretched and changed his position facing her with one leg up and leaning on it. Maryanne noted his every movement and latched onto every word he said. Ricky was just a normal teenager trapped in a sad situation. Her heart went out to him. \"You tell him to do his homework, he'd read a comic book, tell him to clean his room and he'd watch television. He couldn't eat food without spitting it at ya, and he was a little shoplifter too. You go with him to a store he'd come out with half of it in his pocket...I practically raised him since he was two...he was a good kid. I'm going to...I really miss him. Poor little guy, poor little guy.\" Ricky rode her home; they cruised along quietly, Maryanne pondering all he had told her. When they pulled up in front of the hotel, she became happy again. \"Ricky, I almost forgot to tell you, you've been invited to dinner at the hotel.\" \"Really, when?\" \"Whenever is best for you, we'll be ready.\" \"That's cool, thanks. I'll let you know.\" He snapped and pointed his finger at her with a wink. \"Hey don't forget we have that project to work on for English, construct your favorite scene from a story we've read...how about hopping coffins?\" Maryanne shuddered. \"No thank you! That was terrible, it...I imagined my mother.\" Ricky put an arm around her. \"Yeah, I guess it wouldn't be in best taste for us. We'll think of something. Mr. Kessler was right; we are a neat and efficient team. Hey, my mom's not around most evenings why don't you come by this Friday and we'll work on it. I bet we could knock it out easy.\" Maryanne agreed. She took a quick opportunity and kissed his cheek. Not expecting it, Ricky turned his face and brushed her lips. They lingered, and then both pulled back embarrassed. Maryanne stepped away and patted the bike. \"I'm sorry, did you want to come in and freshen up or something?\" Ricky noticed her distance. He also became aware of his own stirrings. She demurely tilted her head and put her hands on her hips. It was a habit she had and he found it extremely attractive every time. \" Naaah ...I better not, I have to get home and I wouldn't want to come in like this and make a bad impression. That I'll do later I'm sure.\" \"Ricky, you would not! Trust me, if you're a man with all your parts intact my grandmother will be really impressed...stop laughing I'm serious! And my dad wouldn't notice you even if you're skin were green!\" Ricky kept laughing. He made a macho stance and looked down on her with smiling eyes and an exaggerated grin. \"Maryanne, I think your father would notice the green giant coming to dinner. And don't tell me you didn't think so, even I know I look just like him.\" Maryanne had to hold her sides from laughter. \"You know, I've been meaning to ask how you got that little scar on your face.\" \"I fell of my tricycle when I was three. My cheek landed right on the tip of the metal fence. I didn't realize I was hurt until my mom saw me and panicked.\" Maryanne stroked his scar. \"Awww! Poor baby, I bet you were an adorable three-year old.\" Ricky smiled sheepishly. \"I don't know…but I know my mom always said I really did have the terrible two's.\" They said a final goodnight and she ran to the elevator deliriously happy. On the way home, Ricky's stomach did flip-flops. When she kissed his cheek he wanted to grab her and give her a real kiss. He couldn't contain the smile on his face. He had fallen in love.[Chapter 11] Chapter 11-nChris' room It was earlynFriday evening. Ricky gazed at the flickering shadows on his ceiling.nHe heard his mother puttering around in the kitchen downstairs.nTonight was another bingo night. She loses more than she winsnevery-time but it doesn't faze her. She seemed to love sittingnamong the throngs of other women and brave men wasting hours andnmoney in a haze of smoke and idle gossip. Her shrill call broke hisnthoughts. \" Ricky! I'm leaving! Wash the dishes and take out the trash!\" The door slammed shut, as usual there were non\"good-byes,\" no \"see ya laters,\" no \"I love you's.\" Ricky rollednoff the bed, dragging his sheets to the floor. The house was asnsilent as a tomb and he hated it. He untangled himself and lumberednto the stairs. When he passed Chris' room, a shiver went throughnhim. Since his mother's nervous breakdown, she had kept the roomnexactly as it was. For Ricky, seeing it everyday was a nightmare.nChris' clothes still hung in the closet and were folded neatly innthe drawers. His bed remained unmade because he always hated makingnit. Records were strewn around the floor near a slight brownish stainnon the blue rug. It was Chris' blood. Ricky hastenedntoward the kitchen area. He collected the few dishes that lay on thentable, remnants of his mother's breakfast, burnt toast ends andnhardboiled eggshells. A black mug with bitter coffee and cigarettenashes sat nearby. He sighed and scraped it all away. As the hot waternand suds rose, Ricky thought of how she had lost all her diligencenfor real housework. Ricky tried to help out, but it was never enoughnor appreciated. The wind rattled the windows and howled as the skyndarkened for a storm. A fear began to seize him as he dried hisnhands. He closed hisneyes to recollect himself. On nights like this he and Chris wouldnhang in either of their rooms, shut down the lights, and tell scarynstories. They pigged out on hoagies or pizza. Ricky lost his tastenfor any horror since Chris' death. Reality proved far worse. Anloud slam from upstairs made Ricky jump back and knock into thentable. The noise came from Chris' room. He heard movement andnfroze. His heart thudded violently and small beads of sweat broke outnon his forehead. Ricky crept to the stairway. The soft light fromnChris' room illuminated the hallway. He didn't realize he hadnleft it on. Ricky couldn't go up. He grasped the wall and screamednin his mind. Nightmares had plagued him about Chris for a long time.nThe doorbell's loud chime startled him more. He ran and peekednthrough the window shade. Maryanne! He had almost forgotten their plan to do the project. He opened thendoor wide. Maryannenyelped as the door flung open. She stepped in, Ricky's face lookednpale and his eyes were widened with fear. She took his arm. \"Ricky, whatnhappened? You don't look well.\" \"Maryanne...I'mnfine...I'm sorry, I almost forgot you were coming, come inside, sitndown.\" Ricky movednstiffly and he led her to the kitchen table. His hands shook as henpulled out her chair. She slid her book-bag off and felt his hands,nthey were cold and he clenched his fists tightly. He kept stealingnglances at the staircase; suddenly glass broke from inside Chris'nroom. Maryanne jumped up and rushed toward the stairs. Ricky followednclose behind. \"What arenyou doing?\" \"Ricky,nsomething fell, we should see what it is.\" Maryannenclimbed the steps, gently shaking her arm from his grip. She stoppednby Chris' room. When she opened the door she immediately saw whynRicky was upset. This was his dead brother's room, but it lookednlike he would walk in at any moment. Ricky was gazing at the floornwith disdain. A picture had fallen from the shelf and cracked. It wasna Junior High portrait of Chris. His large, familiar smile shonenthrough the glass. The picture was taken a few days before thenaccident. Maryanne picked it up and went to hand it to him. Rickynbacked into the doorframe and a stifling claustrophobic feelingnseized him. A flash ofnblack and white fur skidded past Maryanne's feet; it was Chris'ncat 'Jackal.' His tail stood on end and he hissed at them, baringnhis sharp little teeth. Maryanne gingerly put the picture face downnon the desk. A loud crack of thunder followed by a bolt of lightningnmade them both jump and all the lights flickered. Ricky couldn'tntake the overwhelming stress. Leaving Maryanne, he flew down thenstairs and caught himself by the bookshelf in the living room. Tearsnblurred his eyes, he squeezed them shut and wiped them away. Henlooked up and his mother's grotesque cross only mocked him. Rickynsnarled and knocked it down feeling no regret. The fake icon was notnJesus at all; just a rotting hunk of chipped wood and rusted metal. Maryanne hadnfollowed, but stood at a distance, giving him time to composenhimself. She looked up sadly at the empty room. She imagined it wasnstressful for Ricky to see it everyday and know his brother was neverncoming back. Ricky had told her about his mother's behavior sincenChris died. It was depressing, and she knew it pained him. She creptnforward, swallowing the large lump in her throat. Sincenshe met Ricky Linderman she had always depended on him, and he nevernfailed her. Now, he needed her. She put a hand on his shoulder, gently stroking it. Hisnbody was wracking with sobs that she felt through her own being. Henspun around and silently embraced her in hug. He buried his head innher shoulder and they sank to the rug. She softly ran her fingersnthrough his shaggy curls, and then hugged him just as tight innreturn. She cried silently with him. \"I'm herenfor you, Ricky, you can talk to me, I want to help you if I can.\" Ricky heldnonto her as if he had never held anyone in his life. It had been anlong time since he felt the comfort of someone's arms, not even anfriendly embrace. He mumbled things about his mother and father andnkept apologizing over and over. She gently rocked him back and forth,nfor what may have been ten minutes. When his body relaxed and hisntears subsided, He refocused himself and rested his head on hernshoulder. \"Maryanne...don'tnleave me alone, please help me.\" Maryannensighed inwardly. Her stomach danced and her heart broke. She smiledntenderly. \"I won'tnleave you Ricky, I'll always help you, just like you've alwaysnhelped me, I promise.\" Ricky managednto smile back. \"Thanks, I think I'm okay now.\" With his armnaround her, he led her to the table. The incident wasn't mentionednthe rest of the evening and Maryanne certainly didn't bring it up.nThey completed the project and ordered pizza. By the time Mrs.nLinderman returned home they were chatting about nonsense in school.nMaryanne realized that Ricky wasn't always serious. He was actuallyngoofy and she loved it. Tonight Ricky had opened up and laughednloudly and freely, the first time in over a year.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12:nHotel Dinner Maryannentapped her foot incessantly, very nervous about this evening. Rickynwas coming to have dinner tonight at the hotel. Ruth was ecstatic tonfinally meet the boy Maryanne would not stop talking about. Ruthnhelped her pick up just the right outfit for the occasion and worenher favorite flapper style gold sheathed dress. Maryanne finallynopted for a cream angora tank top with a matching cardigan and ansoft, hunter green a-line skirt that was patterned with many ruffles.nShe wore a string of pearls and a slim headband to match the skirt.nWhen Ruth finally dug herself out of the mountain of scatterednclothing she asked, \"Why are younwearing green today? It's not Saint Paddy's day, is it?\" Maryanne hadnlaughed and explained that green was Ricky's favorite color. nMaryanne currently paced near the entrance. Ricky was expected atnsix-thirty and it was six-forty five. Her grandmother was holding antable in the main dining area. As usual her father couldn't come,nhe had a 'serious' business meeting to attend to. Maryanne wasnused to getting this rejection from him and rarely fazed her, but shenhad hoped tonight would be a little different. Grant's own motherncalled him a 'stick in the mud' sometimes. She scannednthe lobby area again and a tall young man caught her eye, he wasnexamining the murals. Maryanne sucked in her breath. It was unusuallyncrowded tonight and she was five minutes late coming down, but howncould she miss him? \"Because hendoesn't look like the Ricky I know, right now he looks like andreamboat.\" She sighed. His dark hairnwas combed back in a side part, slight curls flipped at the ends andnbehind his ears. He wore a brown pullover sweater with a pale yellowndress shirt underneath. Tan corduroy slacks hugged his long legs andnthe black steel-toed boots were replaced with brown loafers. Henturned his head and caught her eye as she maneuvered toward him. Hengreeted her with a hug. \"I almostnthought you forgot, but then again, I forgot about our project, wenwould have been even.\" Ricky lovednthe feel of her; her clothing was soft and warm. She was slightlynmade up with pearly eye shadow and tinted gloss. She smellednwonderfully sweet and he remembered it was her favorite perfume,nMagnolia blossom. She looked so pure and beautiful. He realized henextended the hug and pulled away pointing around the room. \"The art'snnot bad here, if you like abstraction and dots I guess.\" \" Ughh, my dad is still working out a new decor, I told him he should go fornthe more romantic look, flowers, candles, sconces, you know what Inmean?\" \"Yeah,nI do. That would work well, because this shade of orange doesn'tnmatch this shade of pink. I think a more brownish-tone pink or beigenwould work… Umm, not that I know colors or anything. So, what are we going to eatntonight?\" Ricky'snstomach growled loudly and Maryanne rubbed it in sympathy giggling. \"I'mnsorry, let's go right now, you can have the whole menu if you want!nAnd don't get so coy, I think it's great that you know colors,nmany of the best artists are males.\" She led thenway to the dining hall. A soft jazzy-funk mix played as patronsnstreamed in to dance and mingle at the bar. Ricky looked to thencenter and saw a tiny old woman waving them down. There was a passingnresemblance between her and Maryanne. \"Ricky, thisnis my grandma Ruth. Grandma, this is Ricky Linderman.\" Maryannenintroduced proudly. Ruth took hisnarm and smiled sweetly. \"Sonthis is the fellow I've heard about everyday, my is he looker! If I were...ten years younger.\" She squeezednhis forearm. \"Look at these muscles! And his stature, how's thenair up there, sonny?\" Ricky wasngetting over his initial shyness. He had never really beenncomplimented so much before. He looked down on them, cupping hisnmouth. \"Yo ho ho!nIt's clean and fresh!\" They allnlaughed, Ricky remembered to pull out their chairs. The womennexchanged glances and Ruth commented. \"He's notnjust handsome, he's well mannered! Now let's get to eating. It'snall on the house. Of course I expect you to order anything you want!nYou're a big man; you need your strength! And don't let littlenMary fool you, she can take on any man in chowing down.\" When Rickynlaughed at her, Maryanne covered her face. She loved Ruth to death,nbut her charm was always seasoned with tactlessness. Ricky rubbed hernback. \"I believenyou, Ruth! But…I know it's all put in the right places\" Henquipped. \"Hey, I don't even know what half this stuff is, I'llneat what you all eat.\" Maryanne andnRuth ordered Italian dishes all around. They had Chicken Parmesannwith spaghetti, eggplant rollatini and fresh garlic bread withnsalads. Ricky cleaned every plate; meals like this were few and farnbetween. Ruth ordered them chocolate and vanilla cheesecake toppednwith vanilla and chocolate ice cream and had the waiter bring over anfew baby canolis to dress the plates. Both Ricky and Maryanne wantednto pop. Ruth sat back idly pleased at the interaction of the youngnpeople. They made a darling couple, though Maryanne never admittednthat they were. On a whim she told Ricky, \"Hold outnyour hand.\" Rickynreluctantly moved it toward her but kept his fist tight. His sleevenrode up and large scar was clearly visible on his right wrist.nMaryanne had never actually seen it for what it was and she gaspednquietly. Ruth gave her a warning glance not to ask. She continued tonsmile at Ricky, paying no mind to it. She calmly unclenched hisnfingers. \"Dropnthe boon kid. It's okay, Ricky,nyou're among friends, you'renamong friends.\" Having this assurance Ricky relaxed his hand. Ruthnbegan to inspect it. Ricky glanced at Maryanne and she shrugged. \"When I wasnyoung, and this is way before televisions were ever invented, mynfavorite character was Sherlock Holmes. I used to love the books, andnthen later on the movies too. I always wanted to be like him. At thentime, women weren't allowed to be coppers or detectives. Sherlocknwas amazing; he could just look at a person and tell everything aboutnthem.\" \"Yeah, I'venread those stories, they are pretty good.\" Ricky said. \"You knownyou can tell a lot about a person by their hands.\" \"What do younmean grandma? Like palm reading?\" \"Oh, none ofnthat hocus-pocus. I mean real signs.\" Ruth turned Ricky's handnover. \"This sidenis a little rough, and callused. As scrubbed as they are, I see darknspots in the nails. I know Maryanne told me what you do, but if Indidn't know, I could easily say you work with your hands, either inncarpentry, but then those spots are oil, mechanics is more yournspeed.\" \"That'snright, I'm always in the shop. Darn it, I thought I got all the oilnout.\" \"Don'tnworry Ricky, a real man works hard for a living and is not ashamed tonhave rough hands.\" She felt hisnfingers, and noticed the smooth callous on the edge of his middlenfinger. \"I saynyou're a Hemingway also, and that's something Maryanne didn'tntell me. You're a man of many talents I see! You've got a brightnfuture ahead of you.\" Ricky lowerednhis eyes; he enjoyed writing poetry and short stories. \"I wouldn'tnsay that ma'am.\" Now Maryannennudged him. \"I've been trying to get him to show me some of hisnwriting for a while.\" \"It's nothing, really.\" His face got hot again. \"Tell me,nyou got many girlfriends?\" She asked coyly. \"No ma'am.\" \"Incan't believe it, a strapping, handsome boy like yourself! You'renpolite, intelligent, and sensitive and a great set of choppers, I'dntake you in a minute. We had a saying when I was young, just betweennthe girls. 'Thatnman could put his boots under my bed any day!' Maryanne nearly choked and Ricky started laughingnmore. She couldn't believe what a flirt Ruth was sometimes. No mannescaped this hotel without grandma Peache making a move. However, shenwas harmless and the men were usually amused. \"You knownRicky, I've been around forever and in my young days I had manynsuitors. I was a knockout, like my Maryanne. She's a darling.\" Ricky peekednat Maryanne and grinned at her. \"Youth is anwonderful time for love and romance, but you know what? There'snnothing that compares to finding your one and only, your true love.nMost people can spend their entire lives searching and they getnheartache after heartache.\" She heldnRicky's hand and took Maryanne's. \"If you findnit and feel it in your heart and your head, that's the one worthnfighting for. Life is full of turns and bumps, but if you love eachnother, you'll never steer each other wrong.\" She pattedntheir hands and snapped. \"Grandma,nit's not always so easy ...\"nMaryanne said finally. \"Oh poop! Who say's? You just both have to be willing to make it work, andnremember, give a little and live a little!\" Ricky's legnshook underneath the table. He felt like Ruth was talking in behalfnof both of them. He gave Maryanne a sidelong glance, but shenpretended to be preoccupied with her dessert. Their faces flushed asnthey reflected on her words. Ruth finally broke the ice. \"Boynam I full! Eating like this makes me tired. I'm going to bed, Ricky it'snbeen more than a pleasure!\" \"Yeah, itnhas! G'night, Ruth.\" He replied. Ruth kissednhis cheek and hugged and kissed Maryanne. \"Younkids behave yourselves. Ricky, one day I'll show you my photo album. I was andancer in the twenties, a flapper! Maryanne's making me so proud,nfollowing in my footsteps. Next time we'll trip the lightnfantastic!\" Ruth sashayednto the elevator and went up singing. Maryanne headed toward the lobbynwith Ricky. He had survived her grandmother and she was on her bestnbehavior. She would thank her in the morning. \"So... um, you want to see the roof? There's a great view of the City.\" \"Sure,nsounds cool.\" \"Great, Injust have to get the key from my dad.\" As theynapproached the front desk, Maryanne's expression went from happy tondisturbed. Her father was slouched over the counter; a wily smilenacross his face. An attractive blonde stewardess was standing innfront of him. Mary recognized her from frequent stays. Her shapelynbody lounged all over the desk. Her high-heeled leg was bent upnflirtatiously as she toyed with Grant's tie. Inside, Maryannenknotted with anger. Was her father behaving like this the whole timenher mother was dying? Was he gallivanting around all the times shenhad to stay alert at night to feed her, clean her and comfort her tonsleep? She wanted to really hate him at the moment but knew shencouldn't. He was just a weak man. Rickynrecognized the anger in her face. He felt it himself for his ownnfather whom he suspected of cheating, and those few times shortlynafter Chris' death when his mother brought home boyfriends. Therenwas one he had to physically throw out himself when he became toonaggressive with her. That night he and his mom actually had a longntalk and she decided to forgo bringing home the guys. She still lovednhis father. It pained Ricky to see her cry and he had long sincencursed his dad for leaving her to deal with everything on her own. Ricky tooknMaryanne's hand. She clasped it gratefully and gave it a smallnsqueeze. Mr. Peache spotted them and straightened up, clearing hisnthroat and imaginary paperwork. \"Thanknyou Ms. Rogers, I hope you had a delightful stay?\" \"Oh yes, it was.\" She purred. \"Andnthe service was... adequate?\" \"More thannadequate, I'll be sure and stay here again. See you around,nPeachy.\" Shensauntered past the teens eying Ricky up and down with a smile ofnapproval. Ricky tried to ignore her and squeezed Maryanne's handnagain, making sure her father saw it. It was a symbolic gesture onnhis part. He wanted to convey to Mr. Peache that his daughter was innhis hands now. He was the one that would take care of her, respectnher and love her. Yes, he loved Maryanne. For a long time that word had lost all meaning in hisnvocabulary. Maryannenpractically had to do a song and dance to get her father'snattention. \"Dad, dad? Hi...this is Ricky Linderman. The friend I told you about. We justnhad dinner with Grandma...\" \"Oh, good,ngood, did she get to bed?\" \"Well, shenwent upstairs, I'm pretty sure she did. Can we have the keys to thenroof? I'd like to show Ricky the view.\" Ricky extendednhis hand to the man. He was unassuming with straight dirty-blond hairnand mustache. His dark blue eyes darted all over the lobby. He mannernwas very high strung. \"Goodnto meet you son. I'm glad Maryanne is making friends. And I'mnproud that she's taken her family into consideration and allowed usnto meet you .nI'm sorry I missed dinner. I had important matters to attend to. Inhope she invites you over more often.\" Henabsentmindedly handed the key to Maryanne and went back to shufflingnpapers. \"Don'tnlose it honey; remember to put it back when you're done.\" Maryanne sighed as the headed to the elevator.nRicky shook his head. Her life didn't seem as easy as he oncenassumed. \" Nonhello's, No good-byes, No I love you's\" He said softly. \"Wow Ricky,nyou just quoted the story of my life lately, except for Grandma.\"nShe added wryly. \"It's goodnthat you have someone. I guess our lives aren't as different asnthey seem.\"[Chapter 13] Chapter 13: You're my best friend. The elevator hit fifteen and they stepped off. Ricky followed Maryanne down a corridor of unused rooms that were closed for renovations. He stayed closely behind as she went up a narrow flight of stairs. She opened a pad locked door and a blast of cool air swept over them. The sky was midnight blue and the stars twinkled brightly. To the left of them was an old water tower and to the right an abandoned Pigeon coop. The ledge was high enough to lean on. From the position of the Brooklyn Bridge you could still see cyclists, joggers, and couples strolling along. Ricky strolled to the opposite end and glanced down to his right. He noticed a set of fire escapes that led into the street. Maryanne was focused on the lighted skyline. Ricky joined her. \"Wow, look at the Statue of Liberty, I used to think she was made of green material, like marble or something.\" \"Yeah? Me too! Do you go to Manhattan a lot, Ricky?\" \"Only when I have too.\" \"I was born and partly raised there when my dad wasn't moving all over the states.\" \"My family moved to Brooklyn when I was about ten. I'm really from Chicago. My father had joined another construction crew, 'Defazio Brothers' or something. The only things I remember of Chicago were the L-Train, the freezing weather, the Chicago Bears... and of course if you put ketchup on your hot dog, they'll lynch ya! It was a pretty cool city, not as big as New York though.\" \" Oh, then I can't live there, I love ketchup on my hot dog!\" She giggled. Maryanne had been shivering for a few minutes, March was ending and the weather kept fluctuating. It hadn't escaped Ricky's notice. \"Hey, you look cold? Do you wanna go inside now?\" Ricky moved in closer and his sweater brushed her arm and shoulder. His insides were in a spin. He wasn't sure what he wanted to do next, however, if he was going to react the set up was perfect. He leaned down, slowly putting his arm around her back. She turned to him without a second thought and he wrapped his other arm around her. Ricky pulled her close. He lifted her up to him, and they kissed briefly. Their lips parted a moment but quickly met again. This time the kisses lingered. When they finally pulled away, both feigned surprise, but stayed in an embrace. Maryanne buried her face in his chest, picking at the tiny fuzz on his sleeve. Ricky rubbed her back in soft motions. She was so delicate and he never wanted anything to hurt her. \"Ricky, I don't know what to say, but that was beautiful. I won't apologize!\" \" Good! I won't either, you are so special to me Maryanne, I ...I..\" Ricky didn't finish his sentence. Maryanne leaped up and kissed him more passionately. He reacted by kissing her entire face. He tenderly kissed her neck lower and lower until he felt a small shove. \"Ricky, wait, please...\" She groaned. He pulled back. These experiences were kind of foreign to him. He had imagined them before, but the reality with the woman he loved was much sweeter. \"Maryanne, I'm sorry, I was just getting very...\" \"I know, it was my fault, I kissed you that second time.\" She finished out of breath. \"Hey, it looks like we did wind up apologizing.\" \"Yeah! Darn ...Maryanne, I think I should go now.\" They were silent down to the lobby. The guard waved goodnight and they walked into the street. Ricky was taking the train home tonight. \"Ricky, you're not mad at me are you? I don't want this to affect our relationship, I mean, it has... might have ...It does!\" She said in resignation. Ricky put his hand up to silence her, and then took her hands in his. \"Maryanne, stop . It was probably bound to happen, we're so close, and you're my friend, my best friend!\" Maryanne's heart soared. \"You are too!\" They gave each other a big hug, this time Ricky held himself and kissed her head before he left. Maryanne floated up to her room. She was desperately in love with him.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14:nYou think you're tough? Maryannenand Ricky resumed their friendship as normal at school. Neither wouldnadmit their true feelings toward one other and each felt justified in not doing so. It had been nearly a month and Maryanne finally convincednRicky to join her and others in the park for lunch. He tried a fewntimes, gradually warming up to the other students as they did to him.nRicky still stayed on his guard. He mingled, but he knew that hisnevery action and word was being scrutinized. If the slightest thingnwent wrong, he would be back to square one, forever ostracized by hisnpeers. Ricky forcednhimself to believe that Maryanne would never betray him. He honestlynfelt that she was the one for him. No matter where life took them shenwould always be in his heart. He was saddened by her decision to gonaway to college, but he knew it was her dream. She had an aspiringncareer and these realities existed long before he came into her life. Rickynimagined himself with her, but he knew she deserved much more, morenthan he could provide and more than he was. He understood the words,nechoed by teachers and his parents alike. 'Dysfunctional,nanti-social, unstable.' Mr.nGroscher was the only one who had confidence in him. Ricky felt thatnhis horrible secret would always come between them. He continued tonmaintain a friendship and still posed as her bodyguard. Moody and hisncrew had backed off from nearly everyone. Still, Maryanne sensednsomething was wrong. Moody would not go down in high school beingnbranded a coward and Ricky agreed. The whole gang of Maryanne's friends lounged atnthe picnic table on a Friday afternoon. They were just goofingnaround, with Maryanne trying unsuccessfully to guess everyone'snhobbies the way her grandmother did. \"Don'tnany of you donanything?\" She admonished jokingly. Ricky took a crack at the guessing game withnRussell's hands. \"Your nailsnare longish and your fingertips are red, there's a crease on yournright hand between the thumb and index finger, you play the violin.\" \"Yeah! Howndid ya know?\" \"I saw younand Paul playing in the gym.\" Everyonengroaned. \"But! But...\" Ricky concluded. \"It was still a good observation, had I not known.nI also notice your fingers are distinctly orange and smell like feet,nindicating an extreme love for cheese doodles.\" Everyonenlaughed as Russell tried to wipe his hands on his jeans. Shelly shooknhis red hair. \"He looks like a cheese doodle! You are what you eat!\" That invokednmore laughter, Maryanne caught Ricky's eye. He wore a genuine smilenthat she wanted to see on him forever. As everyone continuednclowning, Shelly nudged Maryanne. \" Uhnoh ,nhere comes trouble!\" She whispered excitedly and slid closer tonVictor Luft. Maryannenlightly kicked Ricky; he turned in time to see Moody and a bald,nbarrel chested man stomping their way. His belly and his musclesnprotruded from his red tank top. Moody stood over them with an evilnsmile. The bald man beside him crossed his arms and observed everyonenin amusement. \"Hey Peache,nI want you to meet my bodyguard. Mike, this is Maryanne, the chick Inwas telling you about.\" Mike winked atnher and held out his hand. She shook it reluctantly. His grip hurtnher and she saw Ricky's eyes flare. \"You didn'tntell me she was a little doll, Moody.\" Mike sneered blowing a kiss. \"Yeah, whatever, and this is Linderman!\" Mike droppednher hand and she rubbed her wrist. Mike grabbed Ricky's arm tightlynand forced his hand when Ricky ignored him. \"Moodyntells me you're a real tough guy, a real killer, is that right?\" He put morenpressure on Ricky's hand until Ricky glared at him. Maryanne andnthe others were growing agitated. \"Beatnup kids, rape old ladies, is that right?\" He leaned inncloser to him, reeking of booze and cheap cologne. \"Heardnyou even killed your ownnbrother and got away with it!\" He yanked Ricky to the ground, but Ricky remainednas motionless as a stone. \"Maryannenstood up for him. \"That's a lie!\" Mikenglared at her and then down at Ricky. \"Is it a lie... Isnit? Hey killer why you on you're knees? Are you a queer?\" He pullednRicky up with little strength. Ricky continued to stay frozen, hisnface void of expression. Mike shoved him with irritation. \"Youngonna hurt me? You really think you're gonna hurtnme?\" He slapped his jacket and pulled the chainnattached to Ricky's belt loop. \" Oooh, a chain. That's tough, you think a chain's gonna make you tough?\" He jerked onnthe chain and tossed it on the grass. He pulled Ricky's carnmagazine from his pocket. \" Hey! A tough magazine!\" He tore it upnand tossed it near the chain. Mike continued his harassment bynslapping Ricky's face left to right, trying to get a rise out ofnhim. Ricky still refused to move a muscle innretaliation. Everyone in the park was puzzled; he was letting Mikenabuse him. Mike was visibly annoyed. He violently shoved Ricky on thentable and everyone scattered. Ricky dusted himself off without a wordnand went to his bike. \"Mike, whyndon't you go kick his butt?\" Moody snarled. Mike hurriednto Ricky and prevented him from leaving the park. \"A motorcycle? Does that make you tough? Is this your tough bike?\" As he saidnthis, he grit his teeth in frustration and kicked off parts. Thenfront fell off and the headlight, bits and shards of metal wentnflying all over the grass. Maryanne watched horrified as Mikensuddenly punched Ricky in the face and he fell down. She couldn'tnbear to see him so defenseless and ran to jump Mike, but Moodynstopped her. Mike spit at Ricky and kicked him in the side. Ricky'snbody jumped and he grabbed his middle, breathing hard to ease thenpain. \"Moody, givenme a call when you really need me, I like to earn my money.\" Mike strollednaway like nothing occurred. Moody was fuming that Linderman oncenagain made him look like a wuss. He shoved Maryanne aside and jerkednRicky's head up by his hair; Ricky's eyes widened and his nosenbegan to bleed. \"I'mngonna kill... Jeesh! You want me to kick your ass?\" He shovednRicky's head up and down. \" Ha-ha! He wants me to! Jeesh!\" He let Ricky's head drop hard and ran to thenbike. He smashed it more and then ran off in a huff. After a fewntense moments, Ricky rose; he couldn't bear to look at anyone. Henwent to the motorcycle; grateful it started up. Maryanne wasnimmediately by his side in tears. \"Ricky,nwhat happened? Why didn't you stop him?\" Ricky couldnonly stare sullenly. She and everyone who witnessed the scene had anright to be confused. He felt so himself. He refused to answer her;nhe just steered his bike and rode away, ignoring her pleas. It wouldnbe four days since the confrontation in the park. Four days sincenanyone could claim to have seen or heard from Ricky Linderman.[Chapter 15] Chapter 15: All I want It was angorgeous spring day outside and the class was antsy that Tuesdaynafternoon. \"Now,nI know the flowers are blooming and the sky is blue, but we need tonbe here. I have your poetry assignment to turn back to you. I've pullednthree to read aloud. Don't worry, I won't reveal the authors, ifnyou rather I don't.\" Maryanne couldnnot pay attention as her teacher read them. She was tired; she barelynslept nights worrying about Ricky. He didn't call her or make annattempt to see her. Mrs. Hanson finally reached the last poem tonread. \"Thisnis a love poem that really touched my heart. It expresses thenauthor's innermost feelings and desires, but there is a melancholyntone, because they aren't able to attain their goal. It's titled 'AllnI want.' Moody snickered from the back. \"What is it, anChristmas list?\" \" Shhh, just pay attention please.\" \" All Inwant is for my poem to capture her finesse, but my words are tonslight, so I digress. The man she deserves I can never be, because mynsoul has lost its dignity. All I want is for her heart to know the truth of myntransgressions, to forgive me, to love me, to make concessions.nAlthough I'm a phantom roving each hall, cold, quiet invisible tonall, All I wantnis for her to feel that when she's in need for her alone I am real.nI am a drifter, the world may always shun, but when I stop and seeknhope, I know she's the one.\" The entirenclass was hushed; everyone pointed fingers and tried to guess whonwrote such beautiful prose. Moody was putting his hands up proudlynbut no one believed him. Maryanne turned red, she knew exactly whonwrote it. She stared longingly at the vacant desk by the window andntried to push the terrible thoughts from her mind. Ricky wouldnreturn, she believed in him with a passion. Maryanne hadnexhausted all her options looking for Ricky. He was not in any of thenspots they frequented in the last few weeks. She even braved some ofnthe junkyards alone, asking every mechanic she bumped into. Lastly,nshe went to his home. His mother looked exhausted, deep worry linesncreased her face. Maryanne felt the love she had for her first-bornnson. She begged Maryanne to tell him to come home when she did seenhim. It was nearly ten o' clock when she returned the hotel. Shendidn't chastise Ruth and left her to mingle freely at the bar. As Maryannentrudged into the suite she passed the hall mirror and lingered. Shengasped at the reflection of a ragged, desperate young woman. \"Was thisnall worth it?\" She thought. She wanted toncrawl back in bed and forget she ever met Ricky Linderman. However,nshe could not forget how much she loved him. She recounted his poemnas she washed up, and then took the spare key to the roof. Gentlenbreezes blew around her and she drooped on the ledge. She put hernface in her arms and her body shuddered with sobs for a few minutes.nA warm hand suddenly caressed her shoulder and she turned, Rickynstood before her. He looked thenimage of when he first stepped into English class, but even morenoil-stained and sloppy. Maryanne was awash with relief. She grabbednhim in a tight hug but he was hesitant and abrupt. He shoved her awaynand whispered closely to her ear. \"You got anynmoney, Maryanne? Give me some money.\" He spoke sonlow his words carried on the wind. She dug into her pockets. \"I only havensix dollars.\" She held it out and he grabbed it. \"ThanksnMaryanne, you're a good kid.\" Ricky turnednand bounded down the fire escape. She was stunned, following himnwithout much thought. He moved fast, charging down the ladders andnsteps. She was leaping and trying to dispel any fear of falling. Asnhe entered the station she was still on his heels. \"Ricky,nwait, slowndown!\" \"Go home, Maryanne!\" They shoutednback and forth as he stormed to the end of the platform. Maryannendemanded explanations. \"Ricky, whyndid you run away? I know you don't want to fight, you're angry atnwhat happened, you don't want to be tagged anymore!\" \"Benquiet Maryanne, you have a family that loves you, go home to them andnjust leave me alone!\" Henyelled more harshly. \"You walk around in a fog rejecting everyone andneverything all because you feel guilt over something you had nothingnto do with! All because you happened to come home and find yournbrother!\" She shouted desperately. Ricky swungnaround enraged and grabbed her shoulders, shaking her up. His eyesnblazed. \" Shutnup! I didn't findnhim! I shot him! Inshot him!\" He let her go, realizing his own strength andncruelty to her. Her distressed expression broke his heart; she wouldnbe better off never seeing him again. Ricky let the first train pass.nHe needed to get the truth out now. If anyone were to know, he wantednit to be Maryanne. He paced frantically by the edge of the platform.nMaryanne remained rooted to her spot; she would not leave him in thisnstate. \"Wenwere home alone and I was playing with my dad's gun, he said let menhave it and I said no! I was too busy showing off like a damnnfool .nHe got angry with me and grabbed it...and it fired! Myngod! I was laughing when it went off!\" He stoppednpacing, his eyes bathed in tears. \"Bloodngushed out of the side of his head and he didn't even know it. Henwas afraid that when dad got home he'd get spanked. Do know what hensaid to me as he was dying? He said, 'You'rengonna have to take the blame for this one.' I couldn't even do that right...I lied, I put the gun in his hand and said I found him that way!\" He wiped his eyes bitterly and approached her. Shendidn't shrink away, and put her arms consolingly around his waist. \"God, Innever told anyone before.\" He looked downnat her, his face awash with grief; he placed a hand on her cheek. \"Ricky,nyou're never going to get over this or be happy if you don'tnforgive yourself. It was an accident; you didn't want him to die. It was just an accident! I'mnso sorry.\" She said through tears. Ricky kissed her hair and then pulled her chin upnand kissed her lips. He lifted her off her feet and they kissedndeeper. She caressed his hair, face and neck, tracing his featuresndelicately. Their bodies pressed together. She spoke in heatednwhispers between kisses. \"Don'tngo Ricky please... I neednyou... Younneed me too! I'll...no... We'llngo away, stay somewhere for a while until you sort it all out. Just please, don'tnleave!\" She feltnfaint; He lowered her down; another train was announced one stationnaway. Ricky wanted to be with her, but he knew it wouldn't be inntheir best interest to stay. \"I'mnsorry Maryanne, you've been so wonderful and loving to me and I letnyou down, I let everybody down. That's just the way Inam.\" The train pulled up and the doors opened. \"Gonhome Maryanne... goodbye.\" Maryanne rannto the hotel dazed. The finality of his last words stabbed her; shenlocked herself in her bedroom and cried herself to sleep.[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: I love you, Ricky Linderman Ricky lingered on the trains for two complete routes before returning home. When he came inside he smelled food. His mother had actually cooked dinner this week. She came out of the kitchen and gave him a light hug. \"Ricky I'm so glad you're home! Where have you been? Look at these clothes! Get into a shower and get to bed...no, wait, have some dinner.\" Ricky removed his coat and made a plate of beef stew and rice. He did something he hadn't done in over a year, ate dinner with his mother. He was weary of the tension and silence. He still could not bring himself to tell her the truth; they had to somehow mend their relationship first. He finally asked her why she was in better spirits. \"I got a phone call from your father Ricky, he wants to come back home, and he misses us very much. And your girlfriend called, told me she saw you and that hopefully you would be home.\" Ricky's jaw dropped, his body began to shake. \"Wh... wh... WHAT! My father!\" He hadn't meant to sound harsh with her, but the thought of seeing his father again infuriated him. \"Ricky, it's not what you think, he wants to start over, and he knows he made a lot of mistakes...we both did!\" \"He made too many, mom, way too many . Where was he when we needed him? He takes off so quick after Chris dies, doesn't call or write for months! Then you fall apart and you treat me like crap! I'm sorry mom! I'm sorry Chris died! But I'm still alive! I'm still your son! I love you, why don't you love me?\" Ricky had started bawling like a baby, his head was lost in his arms. He felt his mother rubbing his shoulders and she leaned in to kiss him. He grasped her waist, the tears still streaming down his face. \"I'm sorry baby, I was only thinking of myself all this time, my own grief, I didn't take you into consideration, me and your father. I want to make up for that, I really do. And he wants to also; we talked for a long time. Just give us a chance, Ricky. I promise things will get better, and we'll help you…we'll help each other!\" She rocked him tearfully. Ricky eventually stood up; he didn't want to be alienated from his parents anymore. He didn't want to be from anyone. \"Alright, I'll try. I'm tired, I'm going to bed.\" Ricky sat down at his desk first; he opened the drawer and pushed aside some papers, looking for a pen. His hand brushed something sharp and he drew them back quickly, licking the blood from his finger. It was his sharpening blade. He pulled it out and tossed it in the wastebasket. He looked down at his wrists and cried more. Suicide was no longer an option; it was cowardly and wrong. If he had nothing else in the world right now he knew he had Maryanne, and would always be strong for her. As he prepared for bed, he thought deeply about his family situation. Maybe this would be a good opportunity to improve his relationship with both his mother and father; he decided he would certainly try while he was still at home. -O- Maryanne dragged herself to school the next morning. Ricky still had not returned. She didn't want to imagine where he had gone the previous night, with only six dollars from her. Her brain was too exhausted to conjure up any more scenarios. After school she moped around the jogging circle. Russell and Shelly caught up with her. Shelly was wheeling her bicycle along and seemed in high spirits. Victor Luft had asked her to the movies and admitted he had a crush on her since seventh grade. Maryanne was truly happy for her friend, but couldn't share her enthusiasm at the moment. Shelly always understood. Russell was in a sour mood also. \"Hey Russ, why the long face?\" Shelly inquired. \"It's worse than ever now! Moody is on the rampage now that he has Mike! He upped the protection money fifteen cents! I think I should just drop out already.\" Shelly sighed in irritation. \"I can't believe I ever liked that creep! What about you Maryanne? Heard anything from Ricky?\" \"No Shelly and I'm so scared for him!\" She blurted out. Shelly was ever the optimist and gave her a big hug. \"Oh Mary, don't worry, he'll be back! He just needs some time to cool down. I'm sorry we all treated him the way we did, he's pretty cool and...\" She whispered in her ear, \"He's gorgeous! Perfect for you Maryanne, and I know how much he likes you.\" Shelly nudged Russell and he responded wholeheartedly too. \"Yeah, I can't believe I was ever afraid of him, he's a real kitten.\" Maryanne managed a laugh. Russell was afraid of his own shadow sometimes and she knew he still cringed around Ricky. \"Maybe you're right, Shelly.\" \"I'm always right! That's one thing you're going to learn about me is that I'm always right. One day in the future you'll come to me and say, 'Shelly, Shelly darling, you were always right!\" Maryanne was laughing with them now and her gaze shifted toward the benches; she gasped. Ricky was walking his bike past the baseball field toward them. He had completely repaired it. \"You see! What did I tell you?\" Shelly called out to Maryanne as she ran to him. Maryanne threw her arms around his neck, staring at him profoundly. His eyelids and nose were pinkish from spending the night in his own tears. \" Oh Ricky, where did you go? Why did you…?\" Ricky didn't let her finish. He picked her up in a bear hug and pressed his cheek close to hers. \"I'm all right, I'm so sorry I scared you.\" He whispered. She nodded choked up and clasped her fingers through his, running her thumb across his scarred wrist. He watched her with an understanding. She couldn't bring herself to express her dark fears. He held her chin up. \"Hey Peaches, not while you need me... never again! \" Maryanne embraced him again. \"It's not just for me, Ricky, it's for yourself, for God, for life , you're a beautiful human being and you deserve everything good!\" \"Mary...right now you're everything good, getting to know you was the best thing that ever happened to me.\" They leaned in for a kiss and felt the surprised stares and grins of all the other students. They stepped back shyly and laughed it off. Ricky put his arm around her and escorted her to the bench with the stone chessboard where Shelly, Russell, Victor and some others waved them down. Ricky went back to retrieve his bike and out of nowhere, Mike and Moody appeared. Mike grabbed the handlebars and straddled the wheel. Everyone became hushed. Maryanne hurried toward Ricky, but he signaled her to stay put. \"Hey Linderman, thanks for fixing Moody's bike, I heard you were good you're your hands.\" Mike winked at Maryanne and she looked away in disgust. More onlookers formed, waiting. Ricky tried to move, but Mike gripped it tighter. \"This bike is Moody's now, let it go, or else.\" Moody took his cue and grabbed Maryanne. \"You know Linderman, I'm kind of against beatin' up on women, but Moody here isn't. I'm not responsible for what he might to do to your girl if you don't give it up.\" Ricky cast a worried glance at her. She was shaking her head firmly not to give it to him and Moody squeezed her tighter until she winced. Ricky glared back at Mike and released the handlebars. \"Okay, take it.\" He said quietly. Mike leaned toward him. \"I'm sorry, what did you say? We all didn't hear you?\" \"I said take it!\" Ricky growled louder. Mike grinned. \"That's a good boy, I really don't know what you're talking about Moody. He's a queer! He couldn't fight his way out of a paper bag! I'm gone.\" Mike walked away with the bike in tow, laughing. He passed by Moody and Maryanne and he rubbed her face. \"Hey Linderman, from one bodyguard to another, maybe you could share a piece of her, she's got the goods right on.\" Mike made a motion to stroke her breast and she spit at him. He reacted instantly by slapping her face. The slap stung and her eyes watered. No man ever had the right to hit a woman, and it really hurt her. \" Whoa, isn't she tough, you know, why don't drop that loser and check in with me? I'll show you a real man.\" Ricky's body heaved, his fists clenched and unclenched and he saw red. He let out a holler and advanced on Mike with a running leap. The bike fell down and Moody jumped out of the way. They both rolled in the dirt and down a tiny hill, everyone started shouting and cheering Ricky on. Mike regained his balance and barreled Ricky into the fence. Ricky doubled over and Mike socked his jaw. Oblivious to the pain, years of anger and hurt radiated from him. He lunged back at Mike only to feel Moody jump on his back. Mike again got the upper hand and began punching Ricky while Moody held him down. Maryanne screamed in panic. She hopped onto Moody and yanked his hair. \"Get off him Moody! Get off!\" Moody was forced to release him when she blocked his vision. Ricky was weakened and Mike threw him face forward into the fence. Still boiling with rage, Ricky spun around and kneed Mike in the groin. When Mike clutched himself, Ricky yanked his velveteen collar pushed him into the fence this time. He started pounding his protruding belly. Mike was choking and gagging, red faced. Ricky grabbed him and flung him to the ground, socking at his head. Mike tried to block the blows then fell out cold. Ricky halted when he saw him unconscious. He looked at him with hate, then pity, and gathered himself up. He took in a sharp, painful breath; he had forgotten Maryanne. In the meantime, Moody had thrown Maryanne to the ground, he tried to kick her stomach, but she tripped him up. She scrambled to get away but Moody caught her in a headlock and dragged her to her feet. She bit down on his arm hard. Moody howled and she stomped his foot. Ricky made his way toward them. He was hunched over with sweat dripping down his bruised face and a little blood trickling from his nose and mouth. The other onlookers made a circle around them. They wanted to help her, but they also wanted the satisfaction of seeing Moody beaten by a tiny girl. Ricky wanted to jump in and end it, but pain shot through him with every movement, slowing him up. He could only watch in suspense. Maryanne backed against him and he gripped her shoulders, nuzzling her cheek. Ricky whispered breathlessly to her, \"Maryanne, go for the nose!\" Moody regained his balance, he tried to punch her but she ducked and he hit air. Ricky was relieved. Maryanne threw back her right fist and punched him just as Ricky said, squarely in the nose. Moody crumpled to his knees and grabbed at it. \" Oww! You broke my nose! You dirty... My nose man!\" Moody rolled around the gravel like a wounded animal. Maryanne hobbled to Ricky, her hand on fire as much as her adrenaline. She put an arm over his back. \"He's right! You did do it!\" Ricky laughed aloud in amazement. The others crowded around Moody and sneered at him as he scampered away. Maryanne couldn't deal with it anymore. Ricky had the same idea and took her hand. He tenderly massaged her bruised knuckles, and then kissed them. They trekked toward where the bike had fallen. As Ricky picked it up he saw Mike dusting himself off. He caught Ricky's eye and gave him a surprising nod of respect. Mike stumbled away leaving Moody in the hands of angry High schoolers. Ricky laughed and couldn't resist mocking her. \"Hey, I was wondering if you would be my bodyguard, I would pay you of course, fifty cents a day.\" Maryanne forced a deep scowl. \"I don't think so.\" \" Please Maryanne! You don't understand, all I want...\" He whined. Maryanne put her hands to her hips. \"Do you always get what you want?\" Ricky laughed and pulled her close. \"No, but I have all I want… right now.\" Despite his throbbing jaw, he kissed her. Maryanne kissed him in return, gently on his wounds. \"I love you, Maryanne Peache.\" He breathed into her ear. She cuddled her face into his chest, her heart full. \" I love you , Ricky Linderman.\" -O- They continued cuddling and whispering sweet nothings until a loud cough got their attention. Shelly, Victor, Russell and Paul were grinning ear to ear. \" Ahem, if you two are finished, whose up for a pizza, it's on us!\" Shelly and Victor announced proudly. \"Thanks, but like this? We're a mess!\" Maryanne said embarrassed. \"Oh, stop being a girl, I'd love pizza, Shelly, I could eat a whole pie myself. I'll chip in, cuz I'm starved.\" He pulled out a wad of singles, counted out six to Maryanne and handed Shelly another four to cover them both. \"All right, we're in now.\" Maryanne said, trying to wipe the grass off her jeans. As the group moved forward Ricky continued badgering her playfully. \"Say, what about my offer Maryanne? Fifty cents a day!\" \"No, a buck a day.\" \"A buck a day!\" \"It's inflation buddy.\" She informed him, kissing his cheek. \"Inflation ...Jeeeeeeeee!\" Ricky imitated Moody dead on and they all busted into fits of laughter. As they continued down the path and to the Pizza Parlor they chatted up a storm. A car passed them by blasting Queen music and Maryanne excitably grabbed Ricky's arm. \"Ricky! That's our song!\" He looked at her confused. \"Since when did we have a song?\" \"Since now …it's perfect for us.\" She replied modestly, grasping his hand. The others chuckled, agreeing with her. Ricky shrugged happily. He lifted Maryanne on the bike seat and wheeled her along. Watching her endearingly, he locked a deep feeling in his heart that day; with his best friend, he would never be alone again. -Oo- ~Ooh you make me live, whatever this world can give to me…It's you; you're all I see. Ooo, you make me live now honey, Ooo, you make me live!
