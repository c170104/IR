Here is my first Chicken run story. Also, the sequel is in development, which is good news. So, I hope that you will enjoy this story. :) Hello there, my name is Kai and I am a chicken at the tweedy's chicken farm, I also have a younger sister called Ginger with the two of us having a strong sibling bond as well as coming up with escape ideas together, though, Ginger is the one that comes up with the ideas while I help put those ideas into action. The two of us, including the other chickens, have been in this horrible farm our whole lives and we still haven't managed a successful escape attempt, though, we tried many times and we ended up being caught by Mr Tweedy, one of the two tweedy's that own this farm, pretty much every time. One night, though, me and Ginger, as well as the other chickens, tried another escape attempt by using a spoon to create a hole under the fence, but, we still have to keep out of sight of Mr Tweedy and his dogs while we're at it, as me, along with my sister, Ginger, managed to get ourselves out. We crept over to the shadows as we silently called over the other chickens to try to have a go at escaping, though, things when badly wrong when Bunty got stuck which caused me and Ginger to roll our eyes in annoyance at the delay, but, we had to make sure that Bunty stays as quiet as possible. Unfortunately, Bunty's struggle to get free of the fence had caught the attention of Mr Tweedy and his dogs which caused me as well as Ginger to push Bunty back into the hut side of the fence before the two of us made a run for it as we were chased by Mr Tweedy's dogs that obviously chose me and Ginger as snack. We got to the front of the house and had our back against the wall as we tried to use a gnome to defend ourselves, but, the dogs somehow managed to bite through the whole thing as they kept coming towards us, until the door opened and in the doorway was a female human, the wife of Mr Tweedy, called Mrs Tweedy. \"Mr Tweedy\" said Mrs Tweedy with annoyance in her tone. \"What are those chickens doing, outside the fence?\". \"Oh, well, uh\" said Mr Tweedy as he picked me and Ginger up. \"I don't know, love, I-\". \"Just deal with it-\" said Mrs Tweedy as she got closer to anger. \"Now!\". With that, she slammed door in Mr Tweedy's face as he faced me and Ginger with his own annoyance while taking the two of us to a set of bins that me and Ginger would later call \"solitary confinement\". Mr Tweedy obviously thought that this would be a good idea to throw the two of us into this thing as he thought that it would be the perfect punishment for us due to our daily escape attempts as he opened the lid of the thing before turning his face towards with anger in his tone as he spoke to us. \"I'll teach you, to make a fool out of me\" said Mr Tweedy as he threw us in. Over the next few days or weeks, me and Ginger kept coming up with more escape plans despite getting thrown into solitary confinement repeatedly due to these escape attempts, but, we remained as firm as ever in the chance to escape this horrible place and live our lives freely in freedom. This farm is so horrible to the point where my younger sister and other female chickens have to lay their eggs day in and day out, only to be killed when they can't lay anymore eggs, something that we all found out the hard way as we had no idea that death was coming for one of us or possibly even two of us.

Take a stretch out side of my comfort zone? I'm quite satisfied with how this came out. It's based off a handful of fan-theories and artwork from the internet; and the conversations of one truly creative individual. (Yes, if you're reading this you know who you are! *wink*) After looking at various artwork of the characters being drawn sometimes all as chickens, and other times all as people, I started wondering: why not create some overlapping world? Clearly the chicken and human characters worked on different wavelengths. Communication between them was impossible in the movie. But what if, just maybe, there was an overlapping? People say our dreams are sometimes where we meet others: that on occasion they're more than just the pictures generated by our brains as we sort out the days' events. And what if, maybe, just maybe, in this place the humans and chickens did meet as equals? It takes place directly after the ending of the movie \"Chicken Run,\" and is written with a narrative that I hope sounds more like the lead character, and less like me. Standard disclaimer : I do not own Chicken Run, or any of the characters mentioned in this. They're all property of their respective creating entities. This is a non-profit piece of fan fiction. The old stone-barn was destroyed, Melisha was dead. That was it. For the first time ever in my life, I found myself truly alone. Even after my parents had died, my brother had still been there with me. When he left, I had already married Melisha. It felt so strange to return to my house after the authorities and mortician had come. Walking past the empty coops, climbing up the tread worn front steps, crossing the threshold. Everything was quiet, still. Even the dogs had run off in the confusion. Now, bearing in mind and all that things with Melisha had been on the sour for a long time, I still had become accustomed to her presence at the farm house. She was my wife, after all. I'd never truly come around to expecting I'd outlive her. Seemed like she'd be one of these women who kept her vitality for the ages. I stared at our wedding photo on the wall. It hung next to my brother's portrait. So strange, it all seemed a lifetime ago. Those faces, mine, hers, his in his uniform. Frozen smiles that in the end would outlast us all. My brother and I had grown up here, you see. As close as any two people ever could've been. And when the war came, well, he went with it. I was too young to join with him. Then, when I was older that old injury to my leg, that break that never did quite heal the way it should've cost me my entrance. What can I say about the war? Nothing I suppose that hasn't been said by blokes more well-spoken than I. My brother? He was shot down. Not even enough left for a funeral, they told me as they presented me with his medals, a burned photograph of us as boys (the one he always kept in his breast pocket), and their condolences. And the chicken. Somehow, my brother's pet chicken had survived. Of course he'd have a chicken. It confounded his fellows, but it brought a smile to my tear-stained face. Jack and his love of all things, great and small. He should've stayed here on the farm. Or maybe, taken those skills of his and become a medic on the field. But no, he had to be the hero. Where he'd gotten that bird was anyone's guess. A grey rooster with piercing eyes and a rather cantankerous attitude. The thing even wore a little scarf with an Airman's medal pinned to it. As the men departed, I turned to bring the bird inside. It looked battle-weary itself, some of his tail feathers still burned off. They told me his name was Fowler. My wife, may I tell the truth and shame the devil, did not share my joy at having one last piece of my brother's life to cherish. In no short order, she quickly banished the bird from the house to the coops with the rest. I suppose that brings me about full circle. This chicken, in fact all of them, proved more clever than I could've imagined. I knew they were up to something, organizing as it were. Of course Melisha didn't believe that. She questioned my soundness for thinking such outlandish ideas. Come to be honest, I almost started believing her over my own eyes and ears. That red bird though, she was the ringleader. Organize they did, and not just escape but flew, in some cockamamie contraption, piloted by none other than that grey rooster himself. I don't know what I felt then, watching them leave. I went to tell my wife, but the explosion in the barn caught her off guard. And that's the last I have heart to speak of there. It's grown late, the oil in the lamp is running low. I can only hope that sleep takes me soon. This house is too big, too empty to live in alone. You can't ever tell where reality ends and dreams begin. Things seem to merge. Maybe the reflection in the mirror's just a wee bit off center, or water seemed to be flowing uphill. It's not right, but it's not wrong enough to set the dreamer's mind awake in strangeness. I know I'm dreaming now. I'm walking the rows between the hen houses, but the fences are gone and the houses are the size of my own. It's not like I'm shrunk exactly, because the grass is the same as it always were. Chicken coops for people, or something. And as I walk past them, I peer into the doors. They look like little houses inside. Tables, chairs, pictures on the wall. I see this woman bending over tending to a pack of children that sit around a table. How can I describe this in ways that make sense? It's like seeing two things, but it's one thing. Blended together. Or I'm seeing both at the same time. That woman, she's also a broody hen. Her children are her wee chicks. I can see her feathers and wings, at the same time her apron and hair in a bonnet. Same with the little ones. They're wearing clothes, but they're also not more than balls of yellow fluff. I guess the best way to describe it is like looking through the triple-paned glass in the ice house at the farm. When I'm in, loading blocks into the sawdust and peer through those windows I see outside... but I also see my reflection and the room behind me mirrored in the glass. Depending on how I focus my eyes, I can see the barnyard, or the icehouse interior. Or, if I let my vision blur I rather see both in one, a room outside... a yard in the icehouse. Well, I hope that makes sense. Because that's the truth of the matter. Depending on how I looked at the folks here, I saw either chickens or people, or the vision of both in one. They didn't seem to take much notice of me as they went about their lives. Another woman passed by carrying a tray of bread. She gave me a nod, and I made to tip my hat to her with my hand... my wing! It was both in one, and I came up short and stared at my hand, flexing my fingers, watching the feathers mimic the movements. The hen paused, tilted her head. \"You all right there?\" She asked in a heavy Scottish accent. \"I'm fine, yes.\" \"Aye, well you best be getting on then, not standing here lost in the middle of the street, yes?\" she said with a friendly smile, giving me a pat on the back. \"Right then,\" I agreed, confused. My feet moved of their own accord, and like the rest of me, of us, they were both my feet and not in one. Each house had its own distinct style of decoration, representing the personalities of the inhabitants thereof. I passed one hut that had an American flag hanging on the wall inside. A large, red rooster was sitting with his feet up on a wood bin, plunking away at a guitar. He didn't wasn't the most skilled. I walked up the ramp to his house and peered in. Definitely an American theme. It was as if that rooster I'd had imported from the states had decorated the place. I continued my walk through this idyllic little village, then something caught my eye. One of the huts was set back from the others a bit, a dusty path leading up to the front door through the lawn. That wasn't what I saw though. It was the flag flying from a pole beside the front gate. I could've recognized that flag from anywhere. It was the same they gave me when they came to tell me Jack died. I walked up to the front path, looked up at that flag and felt myself completely lost in emotion, not the least of which, hope. \"Jack?\" I called out, my pace quickening as I ran towards the hut. \"JACK!\" A man stepped out of the house, pushing aside the curtain that served as a front door. He was tall and lean, wearing the uniform of a Wing Commander, the same blue grey that Jack used to wear, but it wasn't my brother. This fellow was far older, his face lined and serious, he had a grey beard, small and neatly trimmed. His hair was whisky silver, pulled back into a ponytail that fell down past his shoulders. He tightened the white scarf around his neck and glared at me, blue eyes narrowing behind under-rimmed glasses. He leaned on a cane, though it appeared more for style then actual support. \"What are you yelling about, lad?\" he barked, voice sharp. \"We've got ourselves quiet folk around here, don't need you all about disturbing the peace.\" \"I'm sorry, Sir,\" I replied, kicking the dirt with a clawed foot. Chicken foot. Boot, but also chicken foot. I didn't waste time thinking about that. \"I thought maybe you were someone else.\" The man strode up to me, back ramrod straight. \"Jack, eh?\" He peered at me through the thick lenses of his glasses. He was half a head taller than me, and his rigid posture only added to the sense of height. I tell you, he looked so familiar, like I should know him from somewhere. The grey feathers, the worn look... Then it hit me! Hit us I should say. \"You're -that farmer\" \"-that grey rooster!\" we blurted out in unison. \"Tweedy,\" the rooster hissed, narrowing his eyes and removing his glasses. He folded them and slipped them into his breast pocket. \"I've got more than half a mind to run you off my land forthright,\" he snapped, jabbing a finger into the center of my feathered chest. \"Fowler,\" I started, then realized I had no idea what to say next. Because it was a dream, after all. And so did it matter? But it felt real, and I wasn't waking up despite the bizarreness of it all. So I pushed on. \"You flew with my brother Jack! And you survived the crash.\" My hands trembled, I wanted to reach out, embrace the thin officer, but his bearing alone prevented it. \"I never thought I'd see you again.\" His lip curled. \"You planned to turn us into pies.\" \"I had nothing to do with that!\" He jabbed at my foot with a cane. \"Hog feathers!\" the old Royal Air Force officer coughed. \"Your farm, your land, your wife. Apathy in the face of adversity is the same as approval. You didn't stop it, as such, you condone it! If you don't seek to stop the enemy, you are the enemy. I am done with you. You're not welcome in our village. Begone with you!\" Fowler swung his cane, connected hard across my shin. I yelped, and clutched my leg, caught off balance, and fell into the dust of his front path. I tried to right myself, but wing and arm and boots and claws... it was all confusing and too much. I rolled onto my stomach, the most I could do, and buried my head in my arms. I tasted the gravely earth on my lips. It tasted like so many times the children in the Dales had knocked me down when I was a small boy: my dismay was the aim of their sport. I clenched my teeth, felt the crunch of grit between them. This was when Jack would come in, knocking them aside, helping me up. He'd wipe the dirt from my face, muttering his soft reassurances that everything would be all right. Not this time. Jack was dead. Even in this dream he wasn't coming back. Tears, hot and unwanted leaked from my eyes, hastily sucked into the dry earth. I clenched my fingers, I was nothing. The fat fool, the imbecile that Melisha had also said I was. Nothing. A waste. I punched the dirt, sending up clouds of dust from my clenched fists. I kicked. I ground my face against the path. A tantrum the likes of a small child, knocked down one too many times to risk standing up again. I'd probably be there still if a pair of shoes hadn't come into the very edge of my vision. I tilted my head, raising my cheek from the earth and looked at the mirror-shined finish of Fowler's military issue boots. He prodded me with the toe of one, a foot that was both a chicken's leg and an officer's dress uniform. \"Come off it. You're embarrassing us both,\" he commanded. I rolled on my side, but made no motion to get up. After a minute of quiet observation, Fowler reached down and extended a hand. I took it, marveling at the wiry strength of the old veteran as he hauled my embarrassingly plump self to my feet. \"What in the name of God and Country are you doing?\" Fowler demanded. I started blubbering right then and there, and to be honest I am just as glad I can't remember all I said. I should've stopped talking, but it was as if the words had been bottled up for too long, and someone had removed the stopper. They fell out of my mouth, pooling around us both, memories, stories, the entire litany of my truth. And Fowler? God bless him, he listened! He listened and he stayed until I had no tears left to shed. Then, only after I was completely spent did he talk again. \"You know, I do remember,\" he began as he leaned on his cane. \"You came down to the coops, you painted the Royal Air Force roundels in my coop when your wife banished me from the house. You tried, at least for a time. We could range free around the farmyard, return to our coops at night. There were no fences, no dogs. Life was good for us. What changed?\" \"I was weak.\" \"You were weak,\" Fowler repeated, agreeing. His words stung, but no more than any other truth. I looked at the dirt on my knees, and hung my head. \"Jack wasn't weak,\" I muttered. Fowler tilted his head, shifted his weight. \"Jack had his moments,\" the rooster replied. \"There were things you didn't see that I did. I suppose I shouldn't judge you too harshly. But still...\" his voice trailed off. \"What's going to become of me?\" I asked him. \"What do you mean?\" Fowler asked. \"The Tweedys have been egg farmers for generations. With no chickens, no eggs. No eggs, no money. I'll be starving and frozen come winter, if I make it that long. Farming's the only thing I know!\" Fowler stroked his beard thoughtfully. \"I might be willing to make you a deal.\" \"Anything!\" \"Let me talk with the rest of the flock,\" Fowler replied. \"But, in the meantime, you're going to have to do something for us. Tear down the fences, get rid of the dogs. Let us be able to come and go as we please, feel the grass beneath our feet. Though they might not know anything but the camps, I remember an earlier time. I make no promises, but I will see.\" It took me a moment to figure out what he was talking about. He was asking me to put everything back, to the way it used to be, before Melisha converted our farm into a prison. I was reaching out to shake Fowler's hand- -And I was awake. I was sitting up in bed, hand outstretched to no one but the still and heavy darkness. Of course, just a dream. Nothing more. Still, it seemed more than just some imaging. That strange sort of feeling in my guts that I couldn't explain then or now. So, that morning I was up before dawn ripping out the barbed wire fences, laying fresh straw in the coops, cleaning from sunrise to sun set. No one helped, no one stopped by to ask what I was doing. The carts on the road passed by without so much as a nod of sympathy to my loss. Poor old Tweedy , I imagined them thinking. He's gone round the bend for sure . And, telling the truth I wondered if they probably weren't right. Still I worked, pulling stakes, tossing the coiled wire in bails by the ruins of the old barn. That night, I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the downfeather pillow. If I dreamed, to be sure I didn't remember aside from one image that stood out in my mind. \"I did it,\" I told the old bird. \"I made it a home again. You can come back now.\" Whatever Fowler said, lord knows I'm a simple man. I wish I could recall. But I will tell you one thing. When I woke up the next morning it wasn't from the sunlight or hunger. No. It was a sound I hadn't heard in too long: to crowing of a rooster atop the garden shed. Fowler and his flock had come home!

Sus pequeños pulmones parecían querer estallar de un momento a otro, mientras que sus finas patas amenazaban con hacerlo caer en el instante menos esperado. Pero no podía pararse. En la intensa penumbra aún podía escuchar los pasos, sigilosos pero certeros, de su perseguidor. A su izquierda, de repente, empezó a resonar un chasquido sordo, como si algo muy grande se arrastrase con desgana por el suelo en su dirección. Rocky gimió en un jadeo y torció a la derecha, sin estar del todo seguro de a dónde se dirigía. No lo iban a atrapar otra vez. Tenía que escapar de aquella vida y no volver. ¿Cómo no se había dado cuenta antes? Entonces, como en un sueño, vio una luz al final de la oscuridad. Un diminuto triángulo que prometía la ansiada libertad. El joven gallo obligó a sus patas a correr un poco más... «Solo un poco más», se dijo, esperanzado. Al menos, hasta que una sombra se interpuso en su camino cuando sólo le quedaban unos pocos metros para alcanzar la salida de la carpa. Su mayor pesadilla, el cañón. El domador se erguía junto a él, estático, recortado contra la luz del exterior. Ahora esta había adoptado un brillo lúgubre y amenazador, nada parecido a la esperanza que parecía irradiar unos segundos antes. A su espalda, sus dos perseguidores se detuvieron: una cobra jaspeada a su izquierda y un león enorme a su izquierda. Rocky no quiso contemplar sus sonrisas triunfantes. Total, siempre era así… Despacio, el domador se abalanzó sobre él y Rocky se encogió con un grito. Rezando, sin esperanza, porque aquello terminase pronto. Pero al abrir los ojos, lo siguiente que vio no fue el interior del temido cañón sino algo muy diferente. Jadeando desconcertado, el gallo se frotó los ojos y trató de enfocar mejor lo que lo rodeaba. Se encontraba en una pequeña caseta provisional de madera, tumbado sobre una cama blanda de paja. Esta y un par de estructuras de madera, que hacían las veces de banquetas, eran los únicos muebles de la estancia. Pero, sin quererlo, aquello provocó que Rocky se relajase de inmediato. El circo había quedado atrás hacía tiempo, aunque menos del que le gustaría. Y ahora… Gruñendo, se desperezó, se incorporó y bostezó sonoramente. Poco a poco, la realidad se imponía a sus demonios y volvía a recordar todo lo sucedido en las últimas semanas: la huida de la granja, la llegada a la isla, el comienzo de una vida nueva… El gallo sonrió, satisfecho, mientras se encaminaba despacio hacia el exterior de la caseta. Fuera hacía un día espléndido, sin una nube. Los restos del avión en el que habían llegado apenas eran ya un montón de tablas sueltas. La mayoría de sus hermanas habían sido utilizadas para construir otras estructuras: una escuela, casas nuevas, el almacén… Tenía que admitirlo: nunca le había gustado el estilo \"gallo del gallinero\", pero había llegado a apreciar a las chicas. Eran valientes, decididas y capaces de hacer grandes cosas juntas. Aunque, bueno: luego estaba… ella. Ginger se encontraba de espaldas a él, a dos metros escasos de distancia, discutiendo algo con Bunty y Mac que no llegaba a escuchar del todo. Solo oía palabras sueltas, pero por lo visto Ginger le estaba exponiendo una serie de ideas a Mac y esta argüía, generalmente en contra, en base a sus notas. Bunty se limitaba a hacer sus clásicos comentarios cínicos. Rocky podía haber estado observando toda la mañana. Pero su posición fue rápidamente descubierta por Bunty cuando esta se giró un poco de más hacia su posición. La gallina más grande tardó un instante en darse cuenta de que, en efecto, él estaba allí. Pero cuando lo hizo, se calló de golpe, lo que hizo que Ginger se girara a su vez y su mirada se iluminase. Rocky no se cansaría jamás de ver ese brillo en sus ojos verdes. –Buenos días, dormilón –lo saludó de lejos–. ¿Has dormido bien? Él fingió como si no llevase un rato escuchando, aunque sabía que a ella no podría engañarla por mucho rato, antes de bajar los escalones y aproximarse. –Bastante bien. Aunque no quiero interrumpir. Seguid a lo vuestro, por favor… Sin embargo, la mirada que cruzaron Mac y Bunty le dio la indicación precisa de que, por un rato, Ginger volvería a ser solo suya. –No hay prisa, esto puede esperar –arguyó Bunty guiñando un ojo. Mac, como de costumbre, masculló algo ininteligible para Rocky antes de seguir a su compañera colina abajo y desaparecer de la vista. Ginger casi hizo amago de retenerlas, pero después se lo pensó mejor. Como había dicho Bunty, la arquitectura podía esperar. Y más si tenía una estupenda alternativa aguardando a sus espaldas… –Oye, de verdad que no quería interrumpir –se disculpó el gallo con absoluta inocencia cuando ella se giró para encararlo–. Si estás ocupada… Ginger, por su parte, lo interrumpió en ese momento agarrándolo del pico y plantándole un beso en el mismo; algo de lo que, en honor a la verdad, Rocky tampoco se hubiese cansado nunca. –Nunca estoy lo bastante ocupada como para no estar un rato contigo –sonrió la gallina anaranjada mientras él pasaba un ala cariñosa por su cintura–. ¿Has dormido bien? Rocky dudó un microsegundo, sin saber si hablarle de sus pesadillas o no, antes de desechar la idea y asentir con la cabeza. –No te voy a mentir. Esto es mejor que compartir cama con el abuelo… Ginger se rio antes de volverse a mirar la isla, por donde sus compañeras y el propio Fowler se afanaban en seguir dando forma a lo que sería su nuevo hogar. Lejos del recuento, del encierro, de poner huevos por obligación bajo pena de muerte… –¿Sigues enamorada de este lugar? –quiso saber Rocky, situándose a su espalda y rodeando su cuerpo con los brazos–. ¿Cómo el primer día? Ginger asintió. –O más –aseguró–. Aquí podremos formar una colonia a nuestro antojo sin nadie que nos diga lo que tenemos que hacer. Rocky sonrió a su espalda, emocionado. Él mismo jamás hubiese soñado con un paraíso semejante. Pero ahora que lo tenía delante y entre sus brazos, no quería volver a pensar en sus pesadillas ni en su pasado. El futuro se abría a sus patas como un sendero luminoso y colmado de felicidad. No pensaba desaprovecharlo. Como si hubieran pensado lo mismo, entonces, tanto Ginger como Rocky se giraron hacia la caseta y después se miraron, cómplices. –¿Los has mirado esta mañana? –preguntó ella. Rocky rio por lo bajo. –Lo hago todos los días, princesa –replicó mientras ambos se encaminaban, de común acuerdo, hacia la entrada de lo que sería su futuro hogar común. Una vez allí, ambos se quedaron quietos y abrazados en el umbral. Observando, con emoción contenida, los dos pequeños huevos que ocupaban un nido en el rincón junto a la cama de paja que Rocky y Ginger compartían. –¿Sabes? No sé si estamos preparados para esto –confesó Ginger con suavidad pero sin asomo de preocupación, al tiempo que apoyaba la cabeza en su hombro–. Pero sé que lo haremos lo mejor que sepamos. Rocky la ciñó con más fuerza y besó su sien con infinito amor. –No te preocupes por eso, muñeca –la giró para mirarla a los ojos y prometió–. Pase lo que pase, aquí estaremos a salvo. Y ellos –señaló a sus futuros retoños– también. Ginger lo abrazó de nuevo y ambos se quedaron así, mirando de nuevo hacia el horizonte; hacia una nueva vida sin miedo, sin persecución, sin barreras para su felicidad. En definitiva, hacia un futuro mejor para todos ellos. Porque, ¿quién podría encontrarlos nunca en aquel alejado reducto de paz?

Nothing was moving, nothing whispering, nothing at all. It was all quiet. Eerily quiet in the full moonlight. There, in the distance was a house, an old house where farmers that are a couple apparently used to live. Now, the husband of the couple only lives in the house, alone. As the crickets chirped, a black wolf appeared out of the middle of nowhere, with steel blue eye color. It has slick black fur covering the body and pointed ears. Then, it stood up on its hind legs, gazing at the window of the house, gazing at a figure on a bed. It narrowed its eyes slightly and smirked, revealing a sharp pointed pearly white tooth. It glanced at the chicken coops in curiosity and sniffed the air, smelling for any chickens that roamed the area. No chickens. It walked over to the fences of the area and glanced over at the house. It snapped its fingers and whispered, \"Its time to start a new beginning.\" and slashed the fences' chains with its claws, breaking the fence open.[Chapter 2] This morning, as the sun rose from the horizon, shining through the curtains of the same miniature house of the farmer that was asleep in his bed from last night. He woke up with a soft groaned and shifted a bit in his sleep, flipping over to his other side, facing away from the sunlight, trying to get more sleep since he doesn't have a farm anymore. He moved some blankets off his face, sighing to himself that the sun means that he has to get up. The farmer of the farm is a plump man with brown eyes, a chubby, round face, and fair skin color, with short brunette hair. The farmer was wearing his pajamas for bed last night, and he looked terrible. There are bags underneath his eyes, along with dark circles, and he looked miserable. He sighed again and got up from the bed, getting prepared to start the day. He got into clothes that he has, which is a green shirt and pants, a brown vest, a yellow dress shirt, and a blue scarf around his neck. The farmer is wearing socks on his feet, yes, but no boots yet. The farmer intentionally walked into the hallway of his house, looking slightly sad until he invariably heard something moved and then, placed back in the same spot. \"畜生。\" a female's voice spoke gently in fluent Japanese from the living room, cursing in a Japanese accent, making the farmer suspicious about the stranger that appeared in the house, burgling his house, stealing things. He sighed and glanced at the loaded shotgun that he typically carries and carefully picked it up, unlocking the case to carefully check if there are shots inside and there they are, properly loaded and ready to fire instantly at anyone that strikes him. He clicked it shut and clicked his gun, to adequately warn whoever's inside his house, to get out immediately. The farmer heard no window crashed nor no door opened then closed frantically. 'That is one stubborn thief.' He thought to himself. 'Looks like I 'ave to find whoever's inside and get 'er or 'im out.' He carefully walked down the hallway, carefully looking for the responsible person, and getting ready to genuinely scare whoever is intruding and attack back if the possible intruder is ambushing him without any warning. He continued walking carefully down the hallway, glancing cautiously at each hallway to carefully check for any more than one possible intruder in the modest house, aiming carefully his loaded shotgun down the hallways, before cautiously entering the living room, where he and his wife used to live inside before an \"accident\" happened naturally to her, and he is now alone. The farmer conveniently ignored the conscious thought and glanced cautiously around the living room, before instantly noticing some particular about the living room. His favorite back felt chair that he used to sit down whenever he is naturally thinking or when his legs are sore, is turned around to the window and someone, that is sitting comfortably in his favorite chair, is gazing out of the unique window. \"Oi! What are you doin' in me chair!\" he growled fiercely, pointing the loaded shotgun at his chair, thinking there is a person inside, or it's just his imagination and the possible burglar disappeared when he is coming. Then, the chair gently turned around to face him slightly and the figure's right eye, glanced at him from the corner of her eye, before smirked and replied, raising an eyebrow at him, in the same female's voice that he heard earlier in Japanese, except now in English, American English than the modern language he speaks, \"You know it's impolite to point things at people, hmm?\" He frowned in considerable annoyance and continued to point the loaded shotgun at her, didn't scare enough to move away from her. The chair gradually shifted the other way around and divinely revealed the female that he heard her curse before, and she has tanned almond skin color, long brunette hair that is down to the middle of her back as a streak of dyed blue hair on the right side of the temple, with multi-colored wires in series of hues on the left side of the head, and steel blue eye color, with a metal optic with the metal that covers her eye, therefore her hair frequently is wires which shocked him slightly about the fact that she is a cyborg. She is wearing a pair of opaque blue square glasses with round corners, a blue, white, cerulean, peacock, and sky cameo sweater with a hoodie that is enormous that reaches down to her thighs, with pockets on the sides and a silver zipper in the front, and with frost hems at the ends of the sleeves and the bottom of the garment. She is also wearing a pair of blue jeans, that is at the bottom of her ankles, and light purple, light blue shoes with white shoelaces. \"So, are ya the farmer 'round 'ere?\" she asked gently, as she twirled her first finger of her right hand as if this whole place is his. \"Yes, I am,\" he replied gently, still pointing the loaded shotgun at her head, ready to fire at any time at the strange American alien that just came into his home. She gazed at his shotgun for a moment, before smirking and calmly explained, not budging an inch about the shotgun, \"Let me make something with ya, I'll explain everythin' to ya and you'll put the shotgun down, okay?\" \"Unless you get out of me house,\" he coldly warned. She gently rolled her eyes in slight amusement and softly chuckled, gently shaking her head side to side slightly, crossing her arms over her chest, as she gently leaned back in his chair. \"Go ahead and shoot me then if ya don't believe in me,\" she replied, sounding brave, but as well as stubborn too. He frowned slightly in considerable confusion; but gently pulled his first finger on the trigger and instead of blood shooting everywhere in the room, there was a click from the gun. There was no smell of smoke either nor no smell of blood either. He blinked in confusion and unlocked the case and the bullets that were inside was gone! \"What the dickens?\" he gasped, glancing up at her in confusion, and she slightly smirked, before holding up one of the bullets from the case, in her right metallic hand, in between her first finger and thumb! \"I told ya that it's impolite to point things at people,\" she replied, setting the bullet case right next to the other one that is also from the gun and stood up from his chair. \"Now, as I said about the bargain, you,\" she began, as she gently pushed his gun down with her first metallic finger on his shotgun at the tip. \"Put the gun down and I'll explain everythin', okay?\" He was quiet for a moment, still suspicious about her, and he replied, \"Alright, I'll listen to you if you don't steal anything from me home.\" She gently chuckled and slightly pulled up her sweater to reveal her jean pockets and reached inside both of them, emptying them out for him to see. Apparently, she pulled out a miniature hand-sized red device from her right pocket, trailed along with black earbuds for her to listen to music as she also pulled out a small blue cloth with a logo on it. \"Just these two, that's all, bub,\" she replied, revealing them to him. \"Just to be more trustworthy to you, I'll check the butt pockets and the special place too.\" He rose one of his eyebrows in confusion, and she placed the two objects on the black long table that she is in front of, still standing in front of his favorite chair and started to rummage in her back pockets, or butt pockets as she entitled them. \"Nothin' in there,\" she replied, pulling her hands out from her back pockets of her jeans. \"Now, the special pocket.\" She first cracked her fingers and her knuckles, as the farmer was curious of how her knuckles and her fingers on her right arm can crack too, but, he ignored the thought and still is observing her as she rummaged through her hood, draped behind her back. \"Nothin' there either, now, the front pocket,\" she replied, as she unzipped her sweater. The farmer's cheeks went slightly red, and he swiftly glanced away to not watch her reveal the front pocket and after a minute, she replied, getting the farmer's attention, \"Hey, I'm done rummage in my pockets, you can look now.\" He glanced back at her, and she has her sweater zipped up now, and she has her hands in her large sweater pockets on the sides, slightly smirking at him. \"Let me see if you have somethin' in your pockets since I already showed mine,\" she bargained. He nodded his head and reached into his pockets revealing he also has nothing inside, and she gently chuckled, as she placed the miniature device with small black buds in her right pocket, disappearing and the piece of cloth with a logo on it, in the left, also disappearing too. \"Now, where were we?\" she asked herself, after she clapped her hands together, before snapping her fingers, remembering what she was going to do to him. \"Oh, yeah, I remember.\" She walked around the farmer's favorite desk, and he placed his shotgun down on the table, presently realizing that wielding his shotgun, is useless to an extremely clever girl. She gently chuckled and snapped her metallic fingers, her first finger, and thumb, and to his shock, the scenery changed from his home that he lived inside, to an open and colorful space, with varieties of colors like purple, light blue, spots of yellow and white and the gravity that holds him down to the ground is suddenly released, letting him in the air, and he immediately held in his breath, worried to die instantly. \"What do ya think 'bout the Intermagical Space?\" she asked, making a mention around, as she floated in mid-air, and noticing the farmer is holding his breath since he thinks he is in space. Her voice gently echoed around in the space, as he glanced around the area, worried about what might be inside than the both of them. \"Also, don't worry. We're not actually in space; we are actually in another special space where I like to place things in,\" she explained, before glancing upward. \"Look right there.\" He exhaled his used up air that he held inside and glanced upward where she was pointing and noticing an object, that is bubbled in a round light red bubble. \"Let me go get it to show it to ya,\" she replied, moving upward towards the pink bubble and when she reached the bubble, she gently stroked it and sighed. \"So that's where that went to,\" she softly replied, moving back down to him. She showed him the bubble and inside was a piece of cake. \"What is that inside?\" he asked, slightly confused about the strange cake. She noticed it and gently smiled. \"Do you want to try it?\" she asked, holding it out for him. \"Me? But, I don't know if I trust you,\" he replied, still a little nervous about her powers. Sighing the second time, she moved the bubble to the side and gently placed her hands on his shoulders, as he slightly jolted from her touch. \"Listen, it's fine if ya don't trust me or anythin', but, I'm not trying to force ya into things that I've dealt with. Like, for instance;\" she began, before using her powers to make a chair appear in thin air for him to sit down as she continued floating, along with the bubble right next to her. \"I have encountered buncha things that you've never seen, heard, nor encountered. As for me, I have a billion, well, maybe trillions of times.\" He listened to every word that she explained, gradually starting to follow her slightly. \"And I understand you never want to meet me since I am a cyborg and… I'm talking too much…\" she explained, before stopping, while pinching her nose bridge. \"So, you're sayin' that you understand what I'm feeling and don't want to hurt me?\" he questioned, feeling curious. She nodded her head, moving the bubble in front of her body, before popping it revealing the cake inside, and it is a light yellow cake, with some chocolate chips inside. \"Would you like to have some?\" she asked, holding it out. \"What is it?\" he questioned, worried about what could be inside. \"Banana chocolate chip bread,\" she answered happily. Curious about the answer, he took the bread from her, and she added, \"Oh, one more thing; since I just teleported here, I was just lost from last night and just noticed all the fences, so I… uh…\" Understanding what she is explaining directly, he nodded his head and said, \"You took down the fences that surrounded me farm?\" Admitally, she nodded her head, yes, accepting the fact that he's going to snap. But instead of snapping, he shrugged, taking a bite from the bread that she gave him to her. \"You're letting it fly?\" she asked. He nodded his head yes again, now, enjoying the taste of the flavors of banana and chocolate chip, as she shrugged her shoulders, letting that off her shoulders. \"This is amazin'!\" he exclaimed, as she rummaged through the bubbles. \"What's inside?\" \"As I said; bananas and chocolate chips,\" she repeated as she pulled out a bubble, that has a strange egg inside. \"And do me a favor and don't touch any other bubbles, because what's inside might be something that you don't want to know.\" Understandably, he nodded his head as she continued rummaging through, consumed the bread in his hand. \"Though,\" he spoke, glancing at her. \"What are you lookin' for?\" \"I'm lookin' for…\" she paused as she continued to rummage. \"Where is that?\" Curious, he glanced over at what she was doing, still sitting in his chair that she had made for her and noticed a light white bubble in the distance, that has something inside that he noticed. He got up from the chair and floated over to the bubble, with a little of the help of swimming, and took the bubble that he noticed. Inside has something inside, so, he tried to pop the bubble like how she has done it, but, instead, it was hard as a rock that he constantly felt. 'Weird…' He thought to himself, as he thought to himself about who is he going to pop the bubble. He turned to Stephanie who was still busy and said, calling to her, \"Ma'am, I think I've found what you are lookin' for.\" She glanced over to him and noticed the bubble, smiling. \"Yay!\" she happily clapped. \"You found it!\" He glanced at the bubble for a moment, before she quickly popped the bubble without him instantly noticing, as something that was inside the bubble suddenly came out of it, landing right in his hands. In his hands was a golden pocket watch, that looked like it wasn't touched for a long time. For some reason, he looked… sad… but also confused. \"Where did you find this?\" he asked gently, without direct eye contact. \"Well...\" she trailed off, thinking to herself. \"It's more like it found me.\" He glanced up at her, with a more confused face, instead of a mournful face, not gently clutching the golden pocket watch in his hand. \"What do you mean?\" he asked gently, asking her a question. \"During an adventure of mine, I was walking on the beach, just ignoring a… horrible memory of mine, and while walking, I saw something gleaming in the distance and I saw the pocket watch…\" she gently explained, as she trailed off a couple of times. \"After that, I kept the pocket watch here for a while, waiting until I wanted to take it out, or… maybe giving it to someone that it can trust itself.\" He listened to every word that she explained, understanding each word that she said, as he softened a bit, noticing she was just a normal person, not a person that wanted to look for trouble. But, yet, he doesn't believe in her. Not just yet. Right now, he just needs knowing what is her game, and what is she doing. ","Summary":" It was nighttime in the plain.

Based off the movie \"Chicken Run\", There would be bits of changes to the movie since I'm adding a new character to the story. Which that character will be Ginger's little brother. Nobby will not be introduced in the first chapter, due to Ginger told him to stay with Fowler during escape plans. Sorry if my notes were short, I did say everything I had to say. I Hope you'd like it! Here's Chapter 1 C: EDIT: August 16th, 2017- Yeah I edited Fowler's name instead of Flower. Thanks to three guests that noticed it & reviewed that I had Fowler's name as Flower. Thank u again ;) It was night time somewhere in a town in Yorkshire, England, Mr. Tweedy yet again guarding the Chicken farm along with two guard dogs in their leaches. Dogs panting, keeping their eyes out for em' chickens escaping. Mr. Tweedy checks the locked gate to make sure it stays lock, then continues walking and guarding. Then there is Ginger making her escape, sneakily hid behind the huts where she wasn't seen by Mr. Tweedy nor the Guard Dogs. While hiding, she slowly walks to the edge of the hut to peak out. Mr. Tweedy looked back, flashing his flashlight to the huts, and Ginger hid. She peaked out again, seeing Mr. Tweedy and the dogs not looking. She quickly ran to the gate sneakily, grabbed a huge spoon and started digging. One of the guard dogs noticed Ginger digging (sort of), Mr. Tweedy looked back where Ginger was digging. Ginger quickly hid before Mr. Tweedy flashed a flashlight over where she was digging. Then Mr. Tweedy continued walking, guarding. Ginger sees that she didn't get caught, she continued digging, then puts down the spoon. She went under the hole she made, and got out. She sneakily ran to the bricked wall across from her and hid. She gave a signal to the other chickens, Bunty, Babs and three other chickens along their side. They all ran to the gate, a bit sneaky & loudly. The gate shuttered as they got there. \"Shush!\" Bunty shushed. Bunty went under first as Babs whimpered a bit. It got a little bit loud to go under for Bunty. Mr. Tweedy stopped for a moment and turned his head back, then continued on. Suddenly Bunty got Stuck. \"Im stuck!\" Bunty whispered loudly. Ginger rolled her eyes and went to get Bunty unstuck while two chickens tried to push Bunty out of there. It made it loud that the guard dogs heard the gates rusling. They barked and start barking even more, pulling Mr. Tweety with them. Ginger had noticed them coming. \"Get back!\" Ginger yelled. Ginger tried to push Bunty unstuck and two other chickens tried to pull her unstuck too. Dogs continue to bark and run while Ginger looks up and looked back at Bunty. She pushed Bunty even harder, then Bunty became unstuck. Which made all chickens thudded to the ground. Ginger made a run for it. Knowing the dogs, first one had chase after Ginger, and another was on the other side of the farm where Ginger was running towards. Ginger stopped at the moment and turned back and ran towards the door. She turned back at the dogs, backed away slowly before she'd bumped into a gnome. Ginger uses it to defend herself with it, but one of the guard dogs bite the gnome's head off. A moment later, the door had opened, having the dogs stopped growling (both of them backed away & Ginger was backed away one step and gasped). \"Mr. Tweedy.. What is that chicken doing outside the fence?\" [Mrs. Tweety] \"Oh.. I don't know, love. I-\" [Mr. Tweety] \"Just deal with it, Now!\" [Mrs. Tweety] Mrs. Tweedy has slammed the door... Then Mr. Tweedy frowned at Ginger and went to the solitary confinement and opened its huge lid. \"I'll teach you to make a fool out of me.\" [Mr. Tweety] Mr. Tweedy threw Ginger in the Society Confinement and closes the the lid all angry. \"Now let that be a lesson to the lot of ya! No chickens escape from Tweedy's farm!\" Mr Tweedy yells. -The Next Day- Ginger uses a small stick to scratch out how many times she has been in Society Confinement, which counts over 15 times. Back at the farm, every chickens started to wake up and doing their routines, letting Mr. Tweety get eggs out of their nests & putting them someplace. He let Ginger out of the Society Confinement, having Ginger walk back in the Farm. Ginger gave Mr. Tweety a death stare after he kicked her in, then she went inside Hut 17 and came up with a new plan with Mac along her side (she showed the plan to the chickens). Later... several chickens tried to go pass the gate, but it failed cause they hit the gate. Ginger looked at them and gasped. They were loosing their balance and hit the gate once again and flipped over... Ginger rolled her eyes and she tried to go back in hut 17 (I guess), bit she was caught by Mr. Tweedy again! She screamed her way down into the Society Confinement, then Mr. Tweedy closed the huge lid. -The Next Day.. again- After Ginger uses a small stick to scratch out times again, it was time to go back in the farm. As usual. Mr. Tweety kicked Ginger in and closed the gate. In Hut 17, Ginger showed another plan she and Mac made up, hopefully the plan will work this time. Later, Ginger got out from a hole she made with a tool. Ginger looked around as she walks, but she bumped into one of the guard dogs. Back into the Society Confinement as she screams her way in there. -The Next Day... Eventually- Mr. Tweety once again kicked Ginger in the farm & closed the gate. Ginger and Mac showed another plan, which they'd disguse as Mrs. Tweety. 30 minutes later, Guard Dogs were on the lookout, bored though. Then the gate opens.. disguse Mrs. Tweety walk pass by the dogs, seems to the chickens the plan looks success until the dress was caught and ripped apart. Guard Dogs were shocked. Chickens screams as the guard dogs knocked all of them down. They all ran back in the farm, leaving Ginger outside after the last chicken closes the Gate. Mr. Tweety throws Ginger in and closes the lid. So many fails of planning to escape for the past two days.. Into the Society Confinement Ginger goes into... Author's notes: Qotd- When I introduce you to Nobby if I published chapter 2, which Actor would you think would voice act him?[Chapter 2] -The Next day- In the solitary confinement, Ginger sat,, throwing an tennis ball (maybe an turnip) against the wall and back, just waiting out her time to get back in the farm again. At last, a small door had opened and out she goes again to the farm. Mr Tweety had booted Ginger through the gate & she landed her face in front of the compatriots. \"Morning Ginger,\" Babs said pleasantly. \"Back from Holiday?\" \"I wasn't on the Holiday, Babs,\" Ginger explained, not the first time to explain. \"I was in solitary confinement.\" \"Oh, its nice to get a bit of time of yourself, isn't it?\" Babs said. Just then, a bell rang loudly. Instantly all the chickens sprang into panic stricken action, pouring frantically out of the huts. Babs hurried to join the line. Therefore... before going to the line, Ginger had to find Nobby, her youngest brother*, in hut 17. Although she did found him sitting on her bunk, scared. A moment later, Ginger & Nobby now hurried out of Hut 17 to join the line as Flower now stationed himself on top of the roof. \"Roll call!\" he barked. \"Come along now, you'll be late for parade!\" -two moments later- \"Discipline! Order! Why back in my RAF days, when the senior officer called for a scramble, you'd hop in the old crate and tallyho. Chocks away!\" -Flower \"Give over you old fool,\" Bunty groused. \"They just want to count us.\" \"Oh how dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer,\" Flower huffed. \"Why, back in my RAF days-\" Mrs. Tweety were now starting to head towards the gate. \"Ginger.. they're coming..\" Nobby said to Ginger. Ginger now turned to Flower after hearing from Nobby. \"Flower, they're coming, back in line.\" She hissed. \"Oh right, right.\" Flower said. A chicken was accidentally bumped into the ground again. The tweetys are still on there way. \"There will be a stern reprimand for you, lad. You're grounded.\" \"For what?\" Nobby asked all anxiously. \"No no, Nobby, Flower's not grounding you.\" Ginger said. \"He's probably grounding me or Bunty.\" The tweetys are now at the gate. \"Atten-tion!\" Flower ordered one last time. Now the chickens really did snap to attention.. & Ginger set her right hand onto Nobby's hand, holding his hand, protecting him.. now that the Tweety's are entering the yard. marched down the line like a camp commandant. \"Welcome back, hen. Is there a new plan?\" Mac said to Ginger. Keeping an eye on Mrs. Tweety, Ginger secretly slipped Mac a folded scrap of paper before Mrs. Tweety stopped right in front of them. -a few moments later- Mac looked confused. \"I thought we tried goin' under.\" Ginger quickly reached over and flipped the drawing right side up. \"Ah! Over. Right.\" Mac said. At the same time, Ginger has been handing Mac new plans while Mr. Tweety had been handing Mrs. Tweety a clip-board. She scanned it, her face- expressionless as usual. Then she marched up down the line. \"How's the egg count?\" Ginger asked Bunty anxiously. \"I've laid five eggs this morning. Five!\" Bunty reported. \"Well-chuffed with that, I was-\" \"Shush!\" Flower muttered. \"Flower..\" Nobby muttered under his breath. Mrs. Tweety had stopped marching.. she lowered the clipboard and was casting an stare in the direction of Edwina.. The other chickens shuffled nervously. \"Oh no..\" Ginger moaned. \"Edwina!\" Nobby gasped. \"Bunty, why didn't you give her some of yours?\" \"I would have. She didn't tell me, she didn't tell anyone.\" Bunty replied in agony. Mr. Tweety grabbed Edwina by the neck and carried her out through the gate, with Mr. Tweety following him. \"Oh. Is Edwina off on Holiday?\" Babs asked, clueless. 5 seconds later, Ginger had to see what's happening to Edwina. She stood by the hut, far cornered, just in time Mrs. Tweety put on her red rubber gloves. Mr. Tweety now handed Edwina to Mrs. Tweety. Ginger now climbed onto the roof of a hut, right when Mrs. Tweety entered the slaughter hut with Edwina. There was an ax on that chopping block, Mrs. Tweety now grabbed the ax and placed Edwina onto there. She raised the ax and then.. *chops Edwina's neck once* Edwina is dead.. In the yard, the chickens shuffled and clucked nervously.. Ginger turned away.. and bowed her head as she sat down. In that moment, Its all over. There's squawking overhead, Ginger looked uo to see a flock of geeses flying their way across the sky. Ginger's eyes followed them as they flew toward a particularly Luch hill in the distance... \"We've got to get out of here..\" Ginger sighed. \"Ginger?\" Mac said, standing on the ground below/ calling up to her. Nobby was beside her. \"Are we still on?\" Mac asked. \"Oh we're on all right,\" Ginger said. \"Spread the word, Mac. Meeting tonight at hut 17.\" -that night later- Bunty, Babs & Ducky (I guess) could be seen darting across the open space towards hut 17. As they reached the door, Bunty gave a knock. Ginger opened a peephole, her eyes peered out, then she closed get peephole. The door opened. Bunty & Ducky slipped in, but Babs looked behind her before Ginger pulled her inside. The door was quickly closed. Like two second later, another knock was heard & Ginger opened the peephole again. \"You called? Nick and-\" -Nick \"Fetcher.\" -Fetcher \"At your service.\" -Nick Door opened just enough to let Ginger slip out. Guard dogs were barking from the distance, it made Mr. Tweety look through the curtains. \"Over here.\" Ginger said quietly. \"Can I come with you this this time?\" Nobby's voice was heard inside the hut. \"Next time Nobby.\" Ginger said quietly to Nobby. \"Thats what you always-\" Nobby complained before Ginger closed the door. Ginger moved furtively over to the side of the hut, keeping an wary eye on Mr. Tweety. \"We need some more things.\" -Ginger \"Right you are, miss.\" -Nick Fetcher whipped out the briefcase (lunchbox) & lifted the top. \"How about this quality hand crafted tea set?\" Nick offered. \"Uh, no.\" -Ginger \"Or this lovely necklace and pendent?\" Fetcher offered. \"It's love-\" -Ginger \"Or this beautiful little number, all the range in the fashionable chicken coops of Paris. Simply pop it on like so, and as the French hens say: 'Volia'!\" -Nick \"That's French.\" Fetched explained. \"That's two hats in one, miss. For Parties,\" Nick flips the badminton upside down. \"For weddings!\" Meanwhile, Nobby snuck out and hid behind the hut, hoping to hear enough plans /or conservation from Nick, Fetcher & Ginger without getting caught. Nobby's POV: Well lets just see what you've been talking about with them, Ginger. :/ \"Oh, but madam, this makes you look like a vision, like a dream.\" -Nick \"-Like a duck.\" Fetcher added. \"No, thank you.\" Ginger gave Nick back the 'hat' and showed the drawing she gaven Mac eariler. \"We're making this. We need these things. Can you get them?\" -Ginger \"Oh, oh, oh, this is a big job, miss. Oh, bigger than the others. No, no. This is gonna cost. Nick said, studying the drawing, then puts it away. \"Same as always,\" Ginger said. \"One bag of seed.\" \"You call this *pay?\" Nick said. \"Its Chicken Feed.\" Fetcher added. \"What else could we give you?\" \"Eggs.\" Nick said. \"Eggs?!\" Ginger said, horrified. \"Eggs.\" -Fetcher Nobby's POV (meanwhile): No way... please don't give them the eggs.. 0_0 Ginger looked toward the farmhouse and lowered her voice. \"We can't give you our eggs. They're too valuable.\" \"And so are we..\" Nick, began packing the lunchbox and gave Ginger back the bag of Chicken feed. \"After you Fetcher.\" \"After I what?\" Fetcher asked. \"Move!\" Nick barked at him. They both moved away before they stopped where Nobby was. \"Kid, were you supposed to be playing with your sister's doll or something? Well she made us valuable for her.\" Nick said to Nobby before he and Fetcher left. \"..I heard, Nicolas.\" Nobby said quietly before he went back inside the hut. Inside the house, Mr. Tweety squinted out the window. He sat back down on a chair and still looked out. The left over carcass of dead, roasted Edwina sat on a plater on the dinner table. Mrs. Tweety seated at her corner desk, was feverishly entering numbers on her hand cranked adding machine. \"Twenty-two and nine. Fourteen shillings and threepence.\" She muttered to herself. \"Seven and sixpence times three. Two and nine. Fourpence halfpenny.. Do'h! Stupid worthless creatures!\" Mrs. Tweety got up from her seat, \"I'm sick of tired of making minuscule profits.\" She glanced down to the pile of mail on her desk, where, as it happened, there was a magazine piled below all of the other mails. The headline read, 'Sick of tired of making minuscule profits?'. Mrs Tweety pushed the rest of the mail aside. The rest of the headline read, 'Turn tour Chicken Farm into a Gold Mine!'. She picked up the magazine and flipped a page. She started hard at the words, even the 'I'm rich!' part. \"Hmm!\" -Mrs. Tweety \"Ooh yes.\" Mr. Tweety continued to stare out the window, oblivious. \"Those chickens are up to something.\" \"Quiet.\" Mrs. Tweety said. \"I'm onto something.\" Mr. Tweety lifted a pair of binoculars to his eyes and continued to stare as Ginger walked from behind the hut and stopped when she saw Mr. Tweety. \"They're organized. I know it.\" Mr. Tweety said. \"I said, quiet!\" -Mrs. Tweety \"That Ginger one. I reckon she's their leader.\" Mr. Tweety whispered. Mrs. Tweety slammed her fist on the desk. \"Mr. Tweety!\" she barked. Mr. Tweety jumped. \"I may finally have found a way to make us some real money around here, and what are you on about? Rediculous notions of escaping chickens.\" -Mrs. Tweety \"But- But-\" Mr. Tweety \" Its all in your head , Mr. Tweety. Say it!\" -Mrs. Tweety \"Its all in me head. Its all in me head.\" he repeated. \"Now, you keep telling yourself that,\" Mrs. Tweety said. 'because I don't want to hear another word about it. Is that clear?\" \"Yes, love.. but you that Ginger one-\" -Mr. Tweety They're *chickens you dolt! Apart from you, they're the most stupid creatures on this planet. They don't plot , they don't scheme , and they are not organized !\" -Mrs. Tweety. ","Summary":" Author's notes: Hi guys, its me again!

So it's my job to help the people who are Fangirling over this pairing and give them more than just a film that doesn't follow on. This is another One-Shot for the pairing DerekXWhittier, and to put a little bit of 'flavour' into the story I've made a pairing of my own MonicaXGreg It was a couple of hours after the competition between The Renegades and The Varsity Cheerleading Squad's, and Whittier took her cheerleading squad out for a couple of drinks in the campus nightclub, which turned out to be a drunken mess. The 4 colleagues (which consisted of Derek, Whittier, Monica and Greg) stumbled out of the nightclub and headed back to their dorm rooms, the only one out of the 4 who wasn't drunk was Derek Whittier was swaying as she walked, so Derek put an arm around his girl and helped her to stable her balance. Monica was leant against Greg as they both walked in a zigzagged pattern Whittier: You're a bad influence on me; you are turning me into a criminal –Whittier said aimlessly messing Derek's hair up Derek: Haha! I'm not, Do you see me drunk, and can't stand up on their own? –He said smoothing his hair back to how it should be Whittier: You're just boring! Derek: aha I have work in the morning Whittier ignored what her boyfriend was talking about, lumbered to the back of him, and contiguously jumped on his back. Derek quickly held his girlfriend up and began to give her an unprepared piggyback; the DJ just went along with it. Whittier: Woah! Giddy up horsey Derek: Shh, your gunna wake the whole campus up… The couple was just about to enter the block of dorm rooms Monica and Whittier was staying in Whittier: Monica? Where are you and 'Greg' going, Huh? – She shouted over to the couple walking drunkenly hand in hand away from Derek and Whittier, she winked at her best friend as she knew she had been developing feelings for Greg ever since they were on the Varsity Cheerleading squad Monica: Just going for a walk, Whit! See you guys later! Whittier and Derek waved the newly formed couple off, before heading to Whit's dorm room The drunken cheerleader and the sober DJ lay down on Whittier's bottom bunk bed cuddling and entwining their fingers with one another's as they looked up at the glow in the dark stars that was featured above Whittier's sleeping area. The blonde was resting her head on the DJ's chest slowly falling in and out of sleep as Derek talked away, even though she wasn't really listening Derek: Isn't this perfect… yah know? In high school you kind of girls wouldn't even talk to me and now I'm dating a cheerleader… ironic, right? Whittier: Aww I would talk to you… Derek: I'm just a scrappy boy remember –He mentioned putting himself down Whittier: You're my scrappy boy Derek: I've never told anyone this before Whit… but you're the first girl I've ever… ya know, loved… Whittier: Really? Derek: Yeah – he said with a smile on his face Whittier leant against Derek's chest to close the space between their lips, but just as they was about to touch, Whittier didn't feel to good Whittier: I'm gunna be sick! –The blonde drunken cheerleader covered her mouth with her hand as she pushed herself off her boyfriend and ran to the bathroom closing the door after her Meanwhile Monica suddenly burst into the room upset and hysterical, she sat by Derek on the bottom bunk bed in her dorm room Derek: Hey? What's wrong? Monica: Greg doesn't like me; I just made a complete fool of myself! –She cried smelling of alcohol and sobbing into a pillow Derek: Oh come on, I'm sure he does, he just probably doesn't show it Monica: Don't you get it?! He was just using me so he could keep he's cheerleading scholarship. He never liked me… not the way I liked him Derek: Well he's an idiot and a jerk; he doesn't see that he's just lost one of the best things that will ever happen to him Monica: You really think so? Derek: Yeahh There was a moments silence between the two friends until Monica pulled Derek in for an unexpected kiss, Whittier opened the bathroom door and Derek forced Monica away from his personal space before backing away from the bed in shock, looking back and forth at the two roommates. Whittier: What's this?! Derek: Whit! It's not what it looks like Whittier: Really? You really expect me to believe that Derek! Derek: No, but I'm asking you to trust me! Nothing happened! Whittier: Trust you?! How can I?... I'm finally seeing you for what you really are, for what you'll always be! Derek began to walk away for the argument Whittier: Where are you going?! Derek: I'm getting away from here Whittier: I want answers! Derek: No you don't, seems like you've got them all figured out! –He said before slamming the door behind him Monica: Whit? Whittier immediately followed Derek out of the room, but once she got out into the hallway he was nowhere to be seen, so she decided to go and look for him as she wanted to find out what had actually happened a few moments ago. 30 minutes had past and Whittier restlessly fell asleep on one of the campus benches outside on the quad, she spent the night there as she didn't want to face her roommate in the state she was in. It was a new day and a vigorous knock on the door suddenly woke Monica up, she glance at the alarm clock which read 12:30pm in the afternoon She opened the dorm room door to be greeted by Derek Derek: Oh, Heyy… Monica –Derek scratched the back of his head as he looked down to avoid eye contact Monica: Hi? You okay? – She replied unaware of what took place last night as she was too drunk to remember Derek: Err Yeah? Is Whit in? I'm just on my dinner break from the audio store and I need to talk to her about last night Monica: What happened last night? Derek: Huh? You don't remember? Monica:… Derek: Well you… you know, you came on to me Monica: Oh my god, I'm so sorry Derek: It's cool. I think you should be saying that to Whit though, I really need to talk to her and make things up Monica: Oh so that's why she didn't come back Derek: What do you mean she didn't come back? Monica: She didn't sleep here last night, probably trying to avoid me… Argh how could I be so stupid! Derek: So where is she? Meanwhile Whittier woke up unaware of her surroundings, the sunlight shore in her eyes waking her up off the campus bench. She scratched her head trying to focus on were about she actually was. Once she got to terms on where she was and why she was there, Whittier made her way back to her dorm room, but what she wasn't expecting was Derek to be there waiting his whole dinner break just to see her. As Whittier opened the door, Derek was half stood up half sitting on the window and Monica was sitting on the bottom bunk bed feeling ashamed of herself, they both looked up as she entered the room. Monica: Hi Whit? Whittier: … -She was about to walk past both of them ignorantly but Derek stood in front of her path Derek: Hey… Listen about last night, i- Whittier: I want you to leave – She said coldly avoiding eye contact by looking down at her feet Derek: What? – Confused as he desperately want to sort things out between them two Whittier: Out! I want you out! Derek: …Ok… -Derek didn't want to argue anymore and just went with what she wanted Monica: Whittier- Whittier: You as well! Monica: This is my room just as much as yours Whittier: I need to get ready for my classes, I'm sure you can give me a little bit of space after what you've both done! –She said distantly before heading to the bathroom and slamming the door behind her Derek headed back to the Audio Store as he's shift dinner break was over and Monica attended her lectures and classes she was majoring in Whit came out of the bathroom after freshening up and got ready putting new clothes on, slapping her hair back into a high ponytail and then picked up a dark colour hoodie, which she was just about to raise it over her head until a familiar scent came to her attention… It was Derek's 'Black Tribal Hoodie' the same sweatshirt he wore when they first spent time together breaking into the campus' swimming pool at 2am She stop getting dressed and sat down on her bed staring at her 'boyfriends' hoodie, unknown of what to do with it. The scene of Monica and Derek last night came flooding back into her mind, suddenly she felt a sense of anger and before she knew it the hoodie was shoved in the small trash can. Throughout the week, Whittier hasn't spoken to Monica since what happened between her and Derek, and Whittier has been doing all she can to avoid running into Derek around campus. The mix master even left Whittier a bunch of messages and phone calls of how sorry he was but she just ignored them. It was cheerleading practice in the gym, Whittier and Monica wouldn't even speak or communicate. Whittier called out the steps to routines and the rest followed, Monica Tried to get Whittier alone to apologise for what happened and talk through the situation but Whittier was having none of it. The Blonde cheerleader was about to shout out the final steps to the routine, but Monica couldn't talk it anymore and decided to tell her best friend the truth Monica: It was my fault! Not Derek's… Whittier: What? Monica: I was the one who came on to him. So if you want someone to blame, then blame me not him Everyone else in the gym stopped what they was doing to listen in the heated conversation Whittier: Monica! This is nor the time nor the place for this Monica: No, you need to hear this Monica: I was drunk and heartbroken over Greg –Greg suddenly looked down with shame Monica: And he was there… and after what happened I instantly regretted what I had done, because then I knew that I lost my best friend and ruined your relationship with Derek. I'm so sorry Whit, Please forgive me? Whittier then realised that she made a big mistake in letting Derek go when it was all Monica's fault Whittier: I need to go and find Derek – She said running out of cheerleading practice whilst Monica took over She ran out of the Gym and saw Derek get out of his truck on the other side of campus as he'd just finished his daily radio gig. Whittier ran up to Derek and she wasn't expecting the reaction he gave her, Derek noticed the blonde girl but ignorantly ignored her presences Whittier: Monica told me what happened Derek just ignored Whittier and carried on walking, but the cheerleader wasn't giving up so easily Whittier: Hey, you should have talked to me Derek: Well, you had it all figured out, I was guilty… no questions Whittier: I know and I'm sorry – She told Derek, running in front of his path Derek: You should have trusted me Whittier: I know and I will in future Derek pulled Whittier into a hug Derek: I'm sorry of what you thought of me Whittier: I should've known that you wasn't like that and I was wrong to think that of you Derek: So what about Monica? Whittier: I forgive her, we talked it through and it was a drunken honest mistake Derek: I'm glad we've made things up, because I've missed you so much Whittier: I've missed you to And with that Derek and Whittier was finally back together, this speed bump in their relationship was just an exercise of how to trust each other more and they did.

Derek and Whittier have both just broke into the campus' swimming pool area which is strictly off limits at that time at night Whittier: Are we allowed to be in here? Derek: 2 a.m.'s the only good time to swim… the rest of the time I'm working Whittier: Where? Derek: Well, I do work-study in the cafeteria. Part-time in an audio store.

Every now and again Whittier would check her phone to see if Derek had called back her 50 odd phone calls she'd left him throughout the day, but she got no reply… Monica saw the sad look upon her best friends face and knew that she felt slightly down after her fight with Derek this afternoon Monica: Don't worry, Whit… just give him chance he'll call you back Whittier's mind drifted back to this afternoon's event *Flashback* Whittier walked over to the fountain that was featured right in the middle of campus; she stumbled on the scene of Derek standing before her with a bunch of flowers and a mix tape in hand. The blonde 'super cute' (as Derek liked to call her) cheerleader ran up to her boyfriend and instantly hugged him Whittier: Hi Derek: Hey He returned the gesture as it was like they haven't seen each other in ages Whittier's phone began to ring which broke the embrace apart, she held the device to her ear and motioned a number '1' with her finger to her boyfriend, Derek just plonked himself down on the edge of the fountain, restlessly running a hand through his mousy brown shaggy hair, watching his girl argue on the phone to her cheerleading squad which needed her 24/7 She hung the phone up, and Derek arouse, handing her the flowers and mix tape, followed by a kiss on her cheek Derek: Happy 7 month Anniversary!

Derek: Look Whit. 'This' obviously isn't working out, I barely see you anymore, you never have time for me. Whittier: Like you have time for me with your 1 million jobs!

She left Monica to her packing as she was going home for Spring Break today, the blonde cheerleader walked to the other side of campus and into the block of dorm rooms her boyfriend was staying in Whittier came face to face with Derek's Dorm room door; she knocked lightly before calling his name Whittier: Derek?

Could you blame them? Besides all the school work, teachers, and parents nagging about your deteriorating grades – there's all the drama, the embarrassing haircuts, and the unattractive pictures that somehow made it into the school yearbook. High school is arguably something you wouldn't want to go through again. You just wish your life was like an 80's teen movie, where a guy would stand outside your window with a boombox, that person who tormented you would get their just desserts, and for one night you could just have the time of your life. You'd just wish that John Hughes would have directed your life. Amidst all that, however, somewhere in that deep hatred you have for your high school experience, are the little moments that actually made you happy: the times you spent with your friends. Located in the stunning town of Rosewood, Illinois, sits the esteemed Rosewood Academy. Rosewood Academy features a stunning campus complete with rustic brick buildings, lavish woods, and a dazzling lake right behind the school's main buildings. At Rosewood, you'll find just about any person you're looking for. You've got the popular girls sitting on the steps of the main building, dumping yogurt on the unsuspecting heads of passersby. The geeks messing around in the science lab, mixing chemicals until they blow something up. The jocks out on the fields, working themselves to the bone for another championship win and just about every other person. For example, there are the Heathers, a group of three girls whose lives consist of making you miserable and loving every minute of it. You can't avoid them. You have Jason Bender, the guy everyone is afraid of and he doesn't mind it one bit. Then you have the kid that can do practically anything and get away with it because his father is the school's dean, Freddie Bueller. What happens though when all of these personalities come together for one major party? You can just say, it wasn't a boring night. The Heathers got what was coming to them, Jason hooked up with someone he never thought he would, and Freddie finally got caught in one of his elaborate plans. This isn't all that happened though. So much more happened. These names sound familiar don't they? That's because the teenagers of Rosewood Academy don't know it, but they are reincarnations of famous Eighties and Nineties teen movie characters. Like in those iconic films, these teenagers aren't what they seem. The popular girls lives are most messed up than the freaks they torment, the jocks know that their time is fleeting, and the freaks are that way for a reason. This roleplay takes place after the events of that unforgettable party and the consequences of that night.

Disclaimer: I own nothing. By the way, I'll try to update and make long chapters. This is just a short introduction/prologue. 1. Introduction I never thought I'd end up here. In a safe home in Minnesota, with three children, and a wife... Especially a wife named Brittany. The first time I saw her walk through the school parking lot, I expected a snooty slut from Pacific Vista. Despite my expectations, I followed her around, observing. Immediately, I had known she was someone like me - a cheerleader or gymnast. Being a guy cheerleader kind of ruins your lady experience, but I loved cheerleading. And then, that day when I found out Brittany already had a boyfriend, my heart snapped. But it turned out great. I don't know how, but maybe my grandparent's were right about California being lucky to us, despite the violence. I never would have met Brittany any other way. \"Jesse?\" I hear Brittany call. A shy smile slithers onto my lips as I realize all the children are asleep. Time to play! That night, as Brittany gently snores beside me (which I find cute), I think back to the first day I saw her. Boy, I sure didn't expect it... ","Summary":" Follow Jesse's standpoint during Bring it On: All or Nothing. Disclaimer: I own nothing.

I'm catfreaklol and well I like the movie Chicken Run. I decided to make a story based on it, but I didn't know how. Then one day, while I was looking at all the stories... I came across a story call Rooster Run by SomeRAndomGal. Well, that story was based on the movie, but through Rocky's eyes, so I got the idea to one like it and this time through Ginger's eyes. Since I'm new to this website and is 13 years old please R&R;, it will be a lot of help to me and know my errors. :) Ginger So, like yeah, I'm Ginger and I obviously live in a chicken farm. Since we're chickens, life is just, well, laying eggs, getting plucked, and then getting roasted into the oven. 'Are we still on, hen?' 'Yes we're on. Spread the word Mac.' 'Aye' This plan has to work. It has to be worth more than one bag of seeds and a whole lot of trouble. Come to think of it, I wonder how the rats are so sneaky… well they are rats. I hope they bring a big light weighted spoon. I guess I will head to hut 16 for our meeting. Great... It's gonna take me an hour to keep the chickens quiet. Think, Ginger, think! Oh I know what to do. 'Everyone, BE QUIET!' Wow, that actually works… for the first time. Now time for me and Mac to tell our latest plan. I just hope I don't end up in solitary confinement again. 'Ok, Mac, would you like to explain our new plan?' 'Aye… Ok everyone, look … This is Ginger and over here is the spoon. Ginger runs to the spoon and makes a hole. Then we go under after her.' 'Hmmm, not bad. I guess we can give it a try.' Seriously Bunty? Give it a try? Well, I know how you feel about this and I understand. Now to look for the rats and tell them the location of the spoon. -At Night- Great. Mr. Tweedy is guarding the fence again! I will just have to wait, wait, wait, and NOW! Phew! That was close. Okay, here's the spoon and now to dig! Oh come on…I will to have hide. The dogs have a lot of senses and Mr. Tweedy had to turn around. Oh good… okay to continue digging. Now, time to see if we can fit. Okay, if I can fit, they can fight too, right? I signal them to come over, so they can go under the fence. They made a little bit of noise, but good old Bunty shushed them. Even from far away I can hear Babs whimpering. Ok, so Bunty is going under first. 'I'm stuck.' *sigh* Seriously Bunty? Oh well, I guess I will have to come over and help. Oh no! The dogs caught us! Great! They are barking too. 'Get back' Looks like I will end up in solitary confinement once again. Now to push Bunty back into the fence and NOW TO RUN! 'Hmmm' Yeah Hmmm Mr. Tweedy! It's me again! I'm getting tired. I wish there was a hiding place. Guess I will go up the stairs. Great! I'm trapped. Hey, there's a gnome behind me. It's good enough for a weapon… ah never mind the dog bit the head off. Huh? The door just opened and a lot of bright light is coming out. *GULP* Mrs. Tweedy! 'Mr. Tweedy' 'Eh' 'What is that chicken doing outside the fence?' 'Oh-he he, I don't know love, I – ' 'Just deal with it-NOW!' Okay Mr. Tweedy you are now frowning at me, but trust me ending up in solitary confinement won't stop me from trying to escape the farm! Oh yeah and congrats for getting in trouble with Mrs. Tweedy! 'I'll teach you to make a fool out of me!' You are already a fool. Now where is that chalk to keep track of time. 'Now let that be a lesson to the lot of ya!' Great! Now's he is screaming at my friends. What's next? No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm? 'No chicken escapes from Tweedy's farm!' Right as always. He should say something very different besides that old phase…*sigh* BUT YOU'LL SEE MR. TWEEDY! WE WILL ESCAPE![Chapter 2] Chapter 2; A New Bird? This is like my fifth time in solitary confinement which proves that the plan that me and Mac came up with didn't work to which is why I ended up here. And if you're wondering what the plan was, well… the plan was to hide inside farm things. My friends took the chicken feed dish and I took the part of a roof top thing, but sadly my dear friends made too much noise and I got caught by Mr. tweedy once again. I came up with a new plan which is to dress up a Mrs. Tweedy and today. So when I went back to the chicken farm I told my friends the idea. 'Huh?' Wow. Such dumb do-… wait please don't tell me that the dress is ripping apart. No no no please don't not now in our moment of freedom. Damm! It ripped apart and I guess I will say hello to my old friend Solitary Confinement again. - 4 days later - So bored! This old dirty tennis ball is no longer fun. *sigh* when do I get to come out? I'm angry for last time our plan didn't work and i'm really tired of coming back here over and over again. I hear Mr. tweedy footsteps outside as a little door opens up. Looks like I'm going home. Yay…but in a forced way since the douche bag kicked me inside. 'Morning Ginger!' I turn around to see it's my best friend, Babs. 'Back from holiday?' she asks. 'I wasn't in holiday Babs. I was in solitary confinement.\" 'oh. It's nice to get a bit of time to yourself, isn't it?' Huh? Not really, but it gives me time to think of a new plan to bust our selves out of her once and for all. Then I hear bells ringing and I see my dad, Fowler, on the roof giving directions. 'Roll call!' he yells. 'Come along now! You'll be late for parade!' Parade? Wonder where he got that word from. Anyways I can tell he is so busy telling us what to do that he doesn't even remember he is one of us too. 'Pip pip. Quick march. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right. Come on. Smarten up! Discipline! Order!' He gets off the roof and is now walking in front of us. 'Back in my R. A. F. days when the senior officer called for a scramble, you'd hop in the old crate and tally ho. Chocks away!' 'Give over you old fool. They just want to count us.' Ha-ha. Wow. Fowler and his back in his days are forever making Bunty mad. 'Oh how dare you talk back to a senior ranking officer? Why, back in my R. A. F. days-' Oh no! Here comes Mrs. Tweedy! 'Fowler, they're coming. Back in line.' 'Oh right, right' As they come closer my father whispers to me. 'There will be a stern reprimand for you lad. You're grounded.' Grounded? But why? What did I do wrong this time? 'Attten-tion!' Eek. Creepy. While Mrs. Tweedy is talking Mac leans over. 'Welcome back hen. Is there a new plan?' I tried not to smile and give Mac a paper. 'I thought we tried going under?' Huh? I look over and flipped the paper over. 'Ah! Over. Right!' Ha-ha. Silly Mac. Mrs. Tweedy got a clipboard from Mr. tweedy and I know she is going to check our egg count. I lean over to Bounty and talk to her for a while. 'How's the egg count?' 'I've laid five eggs this morning. Five! Well-chuffed with that, I was-' 'Shush!' Sheesh dad sure is over protective. Then I see why. Mrs. tweedy looks at the egg chart and stops at- 'Oh no! Edwina! Bounty why didn't you give her some yours?' 'I would have. She didn't tell me. She didn't tell anybody.' I was shocked at that and then I knew she was so busy trying to escape like me but why didn't she tell anyone? Then Mrs. Tweedy gets Edwina by the neck and carries her off. 'Oh. Is Edwina off on holiday?' Now that put me into thinking. I go up the roof to get a better view. I regret going to the roof now because what I see is Edwina getting her head chopped off. It's making me cry. We have to get out of this dump and fast. 'Ginger are we still on?' 'Oh we're on, all right. Spread the word Mac. Meeting tonight in hut 17.' I usually have the meetings in the afternoons at hut 16, but this time I felt that I needed more time to think of another plan. This time im going to need more materials which I hope the rats come tonight. - Night time - Knock. Knock. I open the tiny little window of the door and see two chickens which one of them is Babs with her newly knitted pink hat. Right after they come in I hear another knock. I open the tiny window once again and I see it's the rats! Yes they came which means I get to order the materials right away to start on the plan. 'You called? Nick and-' 'Fetcher' 'At your service.' Ha! Such a phony introduction but okay. I see they are trying to be nice to their number one client. I hear the dogs barking and I know I will have to make business with them fast. 'over here… we need some more things-' I began but then they cut me off. 'right you are miss! How about this quality handcrafted tea set?' 'uh no' I say quickly. I don't need anything UNuseful. 'or this lovely necklace and pendant?' 'its lovely-' I get cut off again. 'or this beautiful little number, all the rage in the fashionable chicken coops of paris. Simply pop it on like so and as the French hens say, \"voila\"!' says Nick as he puts the hat on me. 'that's French.' 'that's two hats in one, miss. For parties. For weddings,' he turns the hat over making the long part look like a veil. 'oh, but madame, this makes you look like a vision, like a dream.' 'like a duck.' Nows my chance! 'no thank you. We're making this. We need those things. Can you get them.' Nick takes the paper and looks at it. 'oh, oh, oh. This is a big job miss. Oh bigger than the others. No, no. this is gona cost.' He says like if it is really a big job. 'same as always. One bag of seeds.' I hand him a bag of seeds and he looks at it disappointed. -TO BE CONTUINED-ON CHAPTER 2 OF COURSE-[Chapter 3] Hello this Prince Sparkles, originally known as Cat Freak 101. And I decided to come back after such a looooonnnngggg time to continue on my project. This story, which I still remember, I was Inspired by SRG. And well tada, here I am, back at it again with writing stories. So cheer to more chapters FOR CHICKEN RUN FROM GINGERS VIEW. Chapter 2: A New Bird? Part 2 ON THE LAST PART! (Nows my chance! \"No thank you. We're making this. We need those things. Can you get them?\" Nick takes the paper and looks at it. \"Oh, oh, oh. This is a big job miss. Oh bigger than the others. No, no, this gonna cost.\" He says like if its really a big job. \"Same as always. One bag of seeds.\" I hand him a bag of seeds and he looks at it disappointed.) IN PART 2. \"You call this pay?\" spats out Nick spilling the feed out of the bag with such disgust. What an ungrateful rat. \"Its chicken feed.\" I respond as if reminding him about the contents he is spilling. \"What else could we give you?\" I asked uncertainly as its quite impossible to get them anything else. \"Eggs.\" He replied. \"EGGS?!\" I almost fainted. \"Eggs.\" He repeated calmly and quite greedily. \"We can't give your our eggs. They're too valuable.\" What are they thinking? Apart from escaping, these eggs are our only salvation. \"So are we.\" Nick replies. \"After you Fetcher.\" \"After I what?\" Poor Fetcher was lost in everything. \"Move!\" said Nick impatiently as he pushed Fetcher away. I watched them walk away. These rats are being rats right now because they won't bring what I ask for. Well, I guess that means I'll have to just continue on with the meeting. I look around with my oil lamp, making sure that Mr. tweedy nor his dogs are out on patrol before sneaking back inside in Hut 17. Once inside the warm hut, I find everything out of order and chaos. I slowly walk to Mac and starts slamming my wing against a table. \"Order! Order!\" Ugh, no one is listening to me. \"Quiet everyone!\" Oh what a pain. \"Settle down! I would like to call to order… Oh please!\" I feel overwhelmed not being able to control these hens, but luckily Dad stands up. \"Quiet there!\" All the hens finally started to quiet down. \"Let's have some discipline, what, what?\" \"Thank You!\" Im truly grateful. \"In my RAF days, we had no time for unnecessary chitchat.\" Oh no… Not again. \"Yes, thank you Fowler.\" I say a bit firmly and I believe my dad got the hint. \"I… Right, Carry on.\" Now on with plan. \"Now, I know our last escape attempt was a bit of a fiasco… but Mac and I have come up with a brand new plan! Show them Mac!\" I gestured towards her. \"Right.! We tried going under the wire and that didn't work. So the plan is.. We go over it!\" Mac unwinds the paper I gave her earlier today and puts it up and takes out a contraption that looks like a catapult and a turnip. \"This is us, right?\" She points at the turnip, \"We get in like this\" , she puts the turnip on the little contraption, \"wind her up\" , she winds up a little knob, \"and let her go!\" , and this part I regret. As soon as Mac let go, the turnip went flying and crashing against the wall splattering everywhere, destroyed. It definitely sent all the hens screaming their heads off. Dad sarcastically remarked, \"Good Grief! The turnip bought it!\" Suddenly one of spy hens yelled, \"The farmer's coming!\" We all immediately hid in all the spots and went to our own beds and even placed a fake chicken to fill an empty nest. All just in time as Mr. Tweedy opened our coop by the roof and looked inside with a cold glare and a bright flashlight. He did not let one inch pass by unnoticed. But thankfully Mrs. Tweedy called him, causing him to hit his head with our coop's roof and mumbling something strange as he walked away, rubbing his head. I immediately get out of my hiding place. \"Hmm… think, everyone, think! What haven't we tried yet?\" I said. I looked at everyone as they look at one another. Bounty steps up with an angry look.

So far she was the only one that was doing the routine right. On their first practice, Brittany and Kelly were showing everybody their new routine.

They all seemed to have it down so far. They tried lifting Ashlee and it turned out ok. They decided that was what they were going to do for the competition. The other cheerleaders were trying to get to know her a little better. They didn't know she was a cheerleader from her old school, so she told them all about it. She sat them all down and told them about how she had just become cheer caption and then she had to move. After she told them about her moving and being caption they understood how she knows a lot about cheerleading. Now that the girls know Ashlee a little better they know that they can trust her. \"The championship was coming up in about 6 weeks.\" Brittany said.

Anyways, life so far was sweet, I was team captain of the girls Varsity Basketball team and we were undefeated, my boyfriend was the captain of the boys Varsity Basketball team and he was awesome. I had just came home from practice and walked into the house when I ran into empty boxes, I laughed so hard I was crying, that's when my parents walked into the room and started to laugh at me too! I mean it was hard not too since I was a total klutz, well not on the court. When they had stopped laughing and looked at each other, I knew something was wrong. My dad helped me up \"What's with all the boxes?\" I asked and my dad looked at my mom. \"Honey we need to talk\" my mom stated and sat on the couch with my father, I decided to stand, \"Look honey, um your dad got the job that he wanted\" my mom started and I smiled and punched my dad in the arm lightly and winked at him, he laughed at me. \"But it's in New York and well I'm going to just say it were moving\" my mother finished and I laughed \" That's funny mom, you know I never knew you could tell jokes\" I said and winked at my mother, but she didn't do anything back and that's when I knew she was serious \"But what about basketball?\" I asked. \"I already talked to the coach at the school you'll be transferring to and he told me that there was a slot needed on the team and that when you arrive he will be having tryouts\" my dad assured and I got angry, but I don't know any of those girls plus everybody will hate me\" I said and my mom laughed \"That's all you care about?\" she said and I shook my head. \"No\" I stated \"All my friends are hear plus mom so is my boyfriend, I can't just move all the way to New York without seeing him, he will want to dump me\" I said \"That means Stephanie will take my place as captain and take my boyfriend too!\" I exclaimed and ran to my room. That night the only thing I could think of was that there was no say in this, that I had no choice and that I was definitely moving but how will my friends take this, I had to talk to Bryan tomorrow and tell him everything and, I have to dump him, but I hope that doesn't mean we could be friends, I mean I know that since I'm not going to see him anymore that he will want to date someone else too. The next day I called Bryan and asked him to meet me at school 30 minutes early, when I got there he was there waiting for me with flowers, I was going to miss him so much but I had to do this. I walked up to him and gave him a kiss on the lips and he gave me the flowers. \"What are these for?\" I asked and he sighed a pained sigh \"I heard you were moving\" he started to say and I blinked how did he find out so fast, oh I forgot his father and my father worked together so of course he would know. \"Yeah\" I said \"Is that what you wanted to talk about?\" he asked and I nodded. \"Look Bryan, you are the best boyfriend I ever had, and it hurts me to say this, asks this but…..will you break up with me?\" I asked and he looked upset knowing that I was right. \"I know that New York is far away from here and that the only thing we can do is email each other and I know that won't be enough for you\" I said. \"But you should start dating someone who you can actually be with\" I finished and he stroked my hair and gave me a kiss on the forehead. \"I'm not going to be in school today, and I was wondering since we aren't dating anymore would you be my friend?\" I asked and he laughed. \"Of course I will\" he said giving me a hug. \"I'll miss you\" he said and I nodded \"Me too\" I whispered.

enforced this year. \"So Kat,what're you planning on doing when we get there?\"Sara asked.Kat and Sara were very close,they liked alot of the same things,even though Kat didn't wear alot of black like Sara.Rubin sat behind Kat and put his arms on the back of her seat. \"I'm gonna help with the opening ceremonies.My mom makes me help the coaches with routine and we go over it a few times before it starts.I guess I have to since I'm a coach now.And,my mom's putting me in the Hall of Herky Heroes since I'm a reigning champ at Spirit Thunder,and longest lasting cheerleader there.I've gone thirteen years so far,making it fourteen this year.\"Kat said as they got off the bus and went into the airport to see the West Coast Jets at the check in counter. \"Why do we have to join with them again?\"Chelsie complained. \"Because Chels,Pepper needs us to.There's now way we can pull off last year without them.Pluse,they have our only chance at winning,as a full team.So suck it up,and deal

choreographer,Brooklyn.Pepper didn't see Kat when they came in. \"Watch this.\"she said setting her bag down.She took a running start and did a round off back hand spring back hand tuck.That got Pepper's attention. \"There's only one person I know that can do ten of them in a row without killing herself,welcome back Kat.\"She said hugging her daughter. \"Good to be back,mom.I'm ready to train with the Shets this year.There is no doubt we're gonna win again this year.\"Kat smiled as the Jets and Sharks came up beside her. \"Oh,you guys are gonna be the Shets from now on,are ya.\"Pepper

behind as they went ahead.He and Carson broke up after the Nationals last year due to a long distance relationship,now he was with Kat over the summer.He and Carson are still good friends after it,and Kat doesn't mind that they did go out before.Penn kissed her quick before he left with the others. \"What was that about,Kat?\"Pepper asked,smiling. \"What,oh, nothing mom,Penn was just saying bye

Five,six,seven,eight.\" Kat counted down as they started doing they routine.She ended up being the one at the top of the extention, then they had to do the double helix with her.The song was picked out by Pepper,which was 'Stupid Shit' by Girlicious. \"Mom,I told you I hate to be on the top of the extention.Why did you put me at the top.\"Kat said as the squads started coming in.She was in her varsity uniform that was black and red to compliment the Shets outfits. \"You need to get over that Kat and think about your team.\"Pepper said as they got ready to start. \"You're right,I completely forgot about that.It's been so long since I had a squad to worry about,thanks.\"Kat said as she went back to the other coaches. \"Welcome back to another year here at camp Spirit Thunder.We have a special guest here this year.Our reigning ten time squad leader,and official honorary legend here.She's our Best cheerleader ever here and Spirit Thunder,and it's great honor to have her back to lead

coaches and they did the routine perfectly.Then they all started to leave as the ceremonies ended.Kat met the others on the floor as they talked. \"That was great, Kat.The flamigos are gonna have a hard time doing better than us.\"Brooke said.Penn hugged Kat and wrapped his arms around Kat as everyone in the room got a video message from Vance Vorheese. \"Hey Pepper,check out our new stunt for Nationals,called the Diamond Back.Uh-How many of your coaches or cheerleaders can to a 180 double helix?None,not even your precious Kat?Good,cause we're gonna rule the mat this year.\"He said as

I am so happy her party is today and that she didn't invite Mary Liggo! Mary Liggo Used to be Jennifer's best friend until she started being all mean and stuff. And Mary acts like Jenn's Bff, but Jenn isn't her friend she used to be but not anymore! \"Carson do you want me to drive you to the pool now\"? \"Mom I told you I'm riding my bike there\"! Well it is our neighborhood pool and it's not that far well, I could get Hanna to drive me because she lives in the court next to me. \"Carson I don't want you going by yourself\". \"Okay Mom I'll just go with Hanna gosh\"! \"Okay I'll call Mrs. Lynn\"! I was already half way out the door when I remembered I left Jenn's present upstairs! I run up my big long old brown carpeted stairs and grab the present and run back downstairs and then run all the way to Hanna's house and I was out of breath and then I rang her doorbell. \"Hi Mrs. Lynn umm, I'm ready to go, so are you\"? \"Yes, Yes Carson we are all ready to go but we were just waiting for you\". \"Oh well sorry I ran all the way here and I forgot my Present and\". Hanna cut me off. \"Yeah yeah Carson just put your stuff in the car and let's go I don't want to miss my best friend's party\"! \"Hey and mine\"! We had arrived at the pool a minute late. \"C'mon Carson lets go\"! We both ran out of the car and pas t the old metal gate and then stood there and looked mad. Hanna's face was as red as a tomato and mine as watery as a watermelon. We trotted over to Jennifer and I started talking. \"Umm Jenn what are you dong\"? \"Ohh hey guys glad you could make it but Mary was here so I old her to come join the party\"! \"But Jenn you hate her and you only invited us\"! \"Hanna don't be rude to my friend\"! \"Oh my gosh Jenn I thought we were best friends not you and Mary you know just take my present and well I'm leaving\"! \"Carson bring her back here now\"! \"Jenn umm I think I'm going to go to\". \"Carson\"! \"Look Jenn what you did hurt her cause well she thought you hated her too and so did I and you even told us you wouldn't invite her\"! I said to Jenn's face. I ran to go find Hanna and I wanted to get away from Mary as soon as possible! I finally found Hanna next to the Pool trashcan which was on the other side of the Pool where Jenn and Mary couldn't see at all. \"Hanna what are you doing over her next to the trashcan\"? \"You know Carson\". \"Well Hanna do you want to come up in our secret Tree house\"? \"Well we only go in there all together\"! \"Well c'mon just for a few minutes\"? \"Yeah sure why not let's go Carson\". We quickly ran past Mary and Jenn and didn't look back at all. I think they didn't even notice it was us! \"Carson I know you must be mad too but you don't know Jenn like I do\". \"Yeah I do I am her best friend just as much as you are and don't say she likes you more cause she said she likes us equally\"! \"Carson I knew her before you did and we both knew Mary and We were all best friends an then we hated each other, then you came and we were friends and then she got jealous of you cause we didn't spend any time with her and then we all hated her\"! \"Wow Hanna that sounds like, you hate my guts\"! I ran down that ladder and I ran into my house and up to m y room I jumped into my pillow and my face started getting all red and puffy and I started crying. I opened my window because it was getting pretty hot in my room and then I saw Hanna sitting up against a tree and I felt bad for her really bad and I knew she was half mad at me and half mad at Jennifer so I shouted out the window \"Hanna\"! And Hanna looked up at me and then I think she knew I was coming down to come to her. \"Hanna I'm so sorry, I didn't know what to do and I know you and Jenn have known each other longer but I want us to be the best of friends but we can't because Mary but maybe we can\"! \"Really because I want to be best friends with you too\"! \"Yay\"! \"Yay\" I say after Hanna says it the first time. Hanna and I are watching a movie about Stuff and it's like 11:00 at night! And Hanna saw my phone light up so she picked it up… \"Carson it says you have a text message from Jennifer do you want me to delete it\"? \"No just say Open later or whatever\". \"Okay\". Now it's really late so I think me and Hanna are going to go to sleep but did I mention were sleeping in the Tree House! Hanna and I already put our stuff in there so all we had to do was go outside and get in the Tree House and I think we might spy on people tonight! Doesn't that sound fun! \"Come on Hanna we have to go\"! \"I am coming for the 10th time Carson but what if your mom goes in your room in the morning and we aren't there\"? \"Well I set a timer and it's in the Tree House and it will go off really early and then we can bring everything back up and go to sleep in my room\"! \"Good plan Carson\"! It is starting to get light outside so now me and Hanna have to run! I guess we'll get our stuff later! Me and Hanna are running back inside and we got into my room safely but then we heard footsteps so we acted like we were asleep and what is good is that Me and Hanna are Great at Fake Sleeping! Well surprise! Guess who it was, my foolish stupid geeky brother Nathan! I immediately smelled his colone and chased him out of my room and then went back to actual sleep! It is getting close to breakfast so Hanna and I are getting up and we are still tired! \"Hanna do you want to go tan at the pool soon\"? \"Yeah sure Carson\" Hanna said. We were walking downstairs when we took in the smell of Cinnamon Bun's and Pancakes and Toast, Waffles, Bacon, and my favorite Scrambled eggs! \"Mom are you cooking a feast or something\" I said sarcastically? \"Actually Carson I have some of my friends coming over for work\". Mom said to me. I hate it when mom invites her friends over cause then she makes my friends go home and makes me wear a dress and she makes me drink Apple Tea which she knows I hate and it makes me gag, I make sour faces whenever I have to drink it because it's gross! \"Oh girls I poured you some Cereal to eat in the kitchen\". \"How come we don't get any of the good food\"? \"Carson don't be rude now go take a shower and put on your white Capri's and your white shirt and while you're at it put conditioner in your hair it look's awful\" she said meaningfully! \"Oh Hanna your mom called she wants you home this instant and she said you are to go up to your room when you get there\". \"Mom what is going on\"? \"Hanna Natalie Lynn do you have any idea what this little girl is standing here for\"? I looked over my mom's shoulder and saw Jennifer trying to say something. \"Mom can you give us some privacy\"? \"Hanna after this you are to go clean your whole room and Fix yourself some breakfast\"! \"Okay mom please just go\"! \"Hi Hanna so how've you been doing\"? \"Uh Jennifer what do you want\"? \"I want us to be friends and I want things to get back to how they used to and you should because you left my party\"! \"If you really wanted us to be friends then you wouldn't have invited Mary to your party\"! \"Hanna go clean your room now\"! \"Gladly mom\". I stared back at Jennifer and she ran out the door and I didn't see where she went! \"Ding Dong\" the door bell rang! \"Hi Jennifer what are you doing here\" I said excitedly! \"Carson are you still mad at me\"? \"No but Hanna is\". \"Look Carson I'm really sorry for what I did but Mary looked really sad and I was just trying to be nice\"! \"I understand but maybe you should go apologize to Hanna\". \"Jennifer I am glad you and I are friends\"! \"Well Carson I could only be best friends with you not anyone else\"! You know what I haven't told Hanna, well I am still best friends with Jennifer behind her back and I am still best friends with Hanna behind Jenn's back! How selfish am I well Very! \"Carson have you gotten dressed yet\"? \"No mom I'll do that now\"! My mom can get annoying. \"Carson you should curl your hair and wear your white shirt with half sleeves rolled up and a light blue tank top underneath\"! \"Wow Jennifer I never knew you had a sense of style\"! \"Carson you are so rude\". I am walking downstairs and moms friends are eating Their Breakfast and staring at me. \"My goodness Kacy she's beautiful\"! Some lady said. \"Oh Kacy you didn't tell me she had Style\"! Another crazy lady said \"Wow you look cute\". I heard a boy say that. \"Umm thanks who are you\"? \"I'm Logan I just moved here\". \"Cool I have lived here about 3 years\". \"Carson why don't you two talk outside we have business to discuss\". \"So you're Carson well Hi\". He looked so cute and hot and Spicy!!!!! \"Yeah umm so do you wanna go in my Tree House\"? Sound Mature and Hot not like a fool! \"Sure so what do you do for fun around here\"? You are asking me! \"Well usually Jenn and I and Hanna go to the pool but they are fighting so really just me well I tan or go on slides well or play volleyball depending on how hot it is\". \"Let's go there I have my suit on now and I brought a towel with me cause my mom said after this we'll go swimming\"! \"Cool let me go get mine\". \"So what do you want to do Logan\"? \"Ugh go on the slide I guess\" it is so tall! He waited the whole way down for me! \"Nice Carson you came out and you just came out like a torpedo it was sweet\"! \"You think\"? \"Totally but I bet I can beat you\"! \"We'll see\". He was about to say something but then he stopped and leaned toward me and kissed my lips and I held my eye's shut. \"Logan um I gotta go clean my room\". \"Carson wait\". \"Carson do you want to go out with me like boyfriends girlfriend\"? \"Logan I really think it's best if we just ……..Have a date tonight\"! I wasn't going to say that but I didn't want to sound like a geek or an idiot! \"Great Carson, movies say about 8-ish and popcorn's on me\"! \"Logan I like you a lot\". Yeah nice going miss Fashion central!

I am so mad because now I have to study and I get no date and no boyfriend oh and the study time is now from 5:30 to 9:00 just because my mom thought I was being rude and now my head will be stuffed with algebra which is weird because I haven't taken algebra since February 17th . \"Carson I am sorry you and Logan didn't work out but maybe instead of studying till 9:00 you can study till 6:00 and we can see a movie\".

She needed to get away from the combined team. After the 'truth-out', she just needed some alone time. Especially after seeing Brook kiss Reuben. Something in her just clicked and she needed to sort through everything. Yes, she had a slight crush on him. He was always there. She could always confide in him and he always tried to protect her. But now things were different. He had come out of the straight closet, so to speak. And then that kiss. She couldn't lie to herself, it did sting to watch him kidding another girl. She grunted in frustration as she went to the center of the mat to stretch. \"Come on, Sarah. You've got to figure all this out before you see him again,\" she whispered to herself. She got up after stretching and went to the edge of the mat. She let her body go on autopilot, doing jumps and flips and other gymnastic moves, while her brain sorted through the mess her feelings had gotten her in to. For some reason, she could always think while she was doing gymnastics. It was always a nice get away. She didn't stop until she heard the door to the practice room open and close. She stopped tumbling and looked over to the doorway to see Reuben walking up to the mat. \"Great,\" she muttered to herself. She hadn't figured out anything yet. And she was far from ready to see him again. She couldn't help but see Brook kissing him every time she saw him. A couple tears escaped her eyes and she quickly grabbed her towel and wiped her face, removing the sweat and tears, before he got close enough to see them. \"Whatcha doing?\" he asked, standing in front of her on the mat. \"Practicing.\" It wasn't exactly a lie. \"Hey, you think you could help me with lifts?\" he asked. \"Um, there's no spotter.\" He moved closer to her. \"Don't worry. I won't drop you.\" She looked into his eyes and caved. \"Fine.\" He smiled at her as he moved behind her. \"Ready?\" she nodded. He grabbed her waist and threw her in the air. He caught her feet in his hands and she posed. After about a minute he called, \"Cradle.\" She nodded and fell into his arms bridal style, her arms around his neck. She looked into his eyes, trying not to betray her inner turmoil. This wasn't getting any easier on her. And the way he was looking at her didn't help. \"Just put me down before I do something stupid,\" she thought to herself. He smirked. She was trying so hard to hide her feelings, to keep it all in. It was so cute. His smirk turned into a smile and softly kissed her lips. He pulled back slightly and said, \"I told you I'd catch you.\" Once Sarah recovered, she asked, \"What about Brook?\" Reuben smirked as he set her back on her feet. \"She kissed me. Not the other way around.\" Sarah returned his smirk and pulled his head back down so she could kiss him again. She pulled back some and smirked, \"Now, about that apartment.\" ","Summary":" I Won't Drop You She peeked into the practice room, making sure no one was in there before walking "},{"Movie":"Bring it On","Title":"Bring It On: All Or Nothing Just Once More","Author":"JenniferArcher","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5414495","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One Britney sighed as she slammed hernlocker shut, gripping the red and black pom-poms in her hand as shenshook with fear.

This is just a short setup. This is also my second Bring It On fic and my first for this decade (the 2010s). I hope you enjoy it It's Cheeromantic Chapter Zero – The Opening It all seemed to occur in a series of flashes. Both Torrance and Missy had been accepted into UCLA for college and they had always looked out for one another. Missy always made jokes that since Torrance was in a long-term relationship with her brother, Torrance was kind of an honorary sister to her. Because of Torrance's excitement over it, she and Missy had gone to numerous sorority houses and they had joined one. It was something Missy had never wanted before she had met Torrance but her friendship was more important than some misplaced pride. That was why when Missy had been grabbed outside a bar, she had seen everything in slow motion. She had used some of the skills that she had studied in gymnastics to try to get away from the guy that grabbed her. However, when two other guys decided to join in, Torrance hadn't left her friend's side and had gotten pulled into the fight. Missy didn't know what had happened after that. They were in the parking lot and someone had grabbed her and had their hand between her legs and then she saw Torrance getting pulled down before people were screaming about a car and then Missy watched as Torrance's body was thrown into the air and her body landed limply with her face on broken glass from beer bottles. It wasn't good. This wasn't good. \"Somebody call 911,\" she said before elbowing the guy hard in the chest. \"Torrance?\" she asked as she saw that her best friend was unconscious. \"Damn it!\" she said before pulling out her own phone and took a photo of the guys without them knowing it. \"Come on, come on,\" she whispered as she tried to check over Torrance's head. There was blood. There was so much blood. Once she had finished with the call with the dispatcher and had been told that both the police and an ambulance would be there, Missy did what she knew Torrance would want for her to do – well this and calling her parents – she called Cliff, Torrance's parents would be next. \"So, how goes it party girl,\" Cliff smiled as Missy could hear him tuning his guitar, he had played Torrance a number of songs since they had become a couple. \"That fake ID work for you?\" \"No time!\" Missy said, \"Torrance is hurt! She got into a road accident, meet you at the hospital.\" Missy could hear Cliff's nervousness and heard the guitar drop to the ground. Cliff hadn't seemed to notice. \"She's okay, right? She's going to be okay, isn't she?\" he asked and Missy took a weak inhale. Cliff had decided to go to a school which had a more focused music program but he was still relatively close, he could be there in an hour or two. \"She's alive though okay is subjective,\" Missy said as she saw the ambulance arrive for her friend. \"Can't speak. Meet at the hospital. I have to call her family,\" she said and Cliff nodded before putting down the phone. Missy called Bruce Shipman, Torrance's dad, she just hoped that she wouldn't have to tell him anything too bad.[Chapter 2] Chapter One – First Recovery As soon as Cliff entered the hospital, he made his way towards Missy who had stood and had her arms open for him. She pressed her cheek to his shoulder and he pulled her in for a sibling embrace. \"I was so scared,\" she admitted as she closed her eyes and Cliff nodded. \"How is she? Are people allowed to see her?\" he said and Missy shook her head. \"Only family members right now, her family should be here soon. Thank you for coming so quickly. Torrance would really appreciate it,\" Missy told him and Cliff nodded before they sat down. He put his hands on his knees and looked straight ahead. He wanted to physically kill anyone who had led Torrance to feel this pain but that wouldn't do anyone any good. Cliff took a deep breath before turning to his sister, \"You have to tell me what's going on though. What kind of a road accident? How badly is she hurt? Is there surgery involved?\" Missy put a hand to his shoulder and looked down, \"I don't really know anything,\" she admitted and Cliff stared at her. How could she not know anything? She had been there at the time of the accident, right? That had to mean that she at least knew something. \"I don't…\" he shook his head and Missy sighed. \"We went to a bar, just two friends blowing off steam. We had a couple of drinks and we were heading home. I'd had one drink so I was driving. We were heading to the car and someone grabbed her. When the other two guys thought it would be funny to do some of their sick and psycho things. Tor intervened to help me and she got thrown into the pathway of a car which hit her. She fell into some glass and some of the shar-\" Missy stopped speaking but gestured to her face. She turned to Cliff. She knew that her brother wouldn't leave her just because of some scarring. \"Do you know these guys? Their names?\" he asked and Missy took a deep breath in. \"Two of them were caught by the police, I'm not sure if they're going to turn their friend in but they've got security cameras in the area. I'm sure that her family will do something about it.\" Cliff put his arm around his sister and allowed her to cry into his chest. She was usually incredibly strong but this worry about Torrance was more than understandable. He was feeling it too. \"How bad is her face?\" he asked and Missy looked at him nervously. \"Does that matter to you?\" she said as she pulled away. She knew that she was taking this anger out on Cliff and it wasn't fair. The night had been messed up enough as it was. Her brother couldn't find the physical more important, that wasn't him. He liked the small quips that Torrance made and how she cared about others and wanted to do the right things to get to her dreams. \"Of course I don't care,\" Cliff said as he looked at the ground, he shook his head. \"I don't care but she will. I want to marry her, the way that she looks isn't what's important. I just…I really do want to marry her but now…\" \"You can't leave her just because of an accident,\" Missy commented and Cliff looked at her, horrified that she would think that of him. \"She needs time to heal, if I move too fast and ask her now then she's going to get the wrong idea. I want to be with her when she's healing and then…when the time comes and all of this is behind us, then I'll ask her if she'll marry me,\" Cliff said and Missy hugged him with a huge grin. This was just the type of thing that every girl wanted. She wanted her brother and best friend to end up together and live happy lives. \"She'll be thrilled,\" she said and Cliff nodded slowly. He just wanted the best for Torrance. He knew that asking her right now when her emotions weren't stable was a bad idea. He just wanted to be with her. … ….. Missy nudged Cliff as Torrance's parents finally came out from the room and he jumped back. He hadn't expected to have fallen asleep so easily. He looked at them and saw the tragic expressions on their faces and Missy had to hold him back. She knew that the panic was rising within him. \"We'll have a plastic surgeon look at her face, the doctors say that she's stable,\" Bruce commented and Cliff felt a cold shiver over him. \"She's not staying like that.\" \"I mean it's ghastly, right?\" Christine said as she tried to wipe away the tears from her eyes. \"Yes. Yes. She's still our little girl.\" Cliff stared at them, watching them nervously. How could they say such a thing about their own daughter? Torrance needed comforting and understanding. They didn't need her parents treating her like a monster. \"The bandages will help but she won't have them on forever,\" Bruce said before seeing the two of them there. \"The two of you came, that's very thoughtful.\" \"She's okay, right?\" Cliff asked as he felt like a very small boy waking up from a horrific nightmare. \"The doctors…\" \"They think that she hurt her spine,\" Bruce told them as Cliff choked on his breath, did that mean she was paralyzed. \"Had to have a surgery on her lungs,\" that increased his fear, \"and her face is cut up. The doctor showed us pictures before the bandages were put on.\" Cliff nodded slowly and saw Missy wrap an arm around herself. He knew that his sister was blaming herself for what had happened to her best friend. \"Can we see her? Can we get your permission to see her?\" he asked and Missy put a hand to his back wanting to steady him. \"The injuries are very bad,\" Christine commented, \"And she has barely regained consciousness.\" \"But she's conscious right now?\" Cliff asked before the doctor came to them. \"If I get their permission, her family's permission, can I see her? I'm her boyfriend. We've been together for years.\" \"He really is her boyfriend,\" Christine nodded before looking at Bruce, \"Yes. We'll give our consent.\" \"In that case, you can sit with her but be gentle. There is a psychological component to her recovery,\" he advised and Cliff smiled in relief. He wanted to prove to Torrance that he wouldn't be going anywhere and that their relationship was something that she didn't need to worry about. The doctor led him into the room with Missy following him. The beeps made him tense up as he took in the machines and then saw her looking at him. Once she saw him, she smiled and he went to her side, taking her hand in his. \"You came,\" she whispered under the respirator mask and Cliff sunk down next to the bed so they were at eye level. \"I came, of course I came,\" he told her as he kissed her hand and squeezed it. He looked at her nervous expression and placed a hand on her shoulder. \"I love you,\" he said, \"and whatever happened, we'll figure it out together. I am going to be here for you as much as you need me to be. I do love you. Unconditionally, Tor. Nothing is ever going to change that.\" He saw her smile and mouth those three words too. Her eyes then turned to Missy who had wrapped both arms around herself and she was attempting to hold back the heavy sobs. Torrance had gotten hurt because of her, if Missy had just been watching where she was going and been on high alert for creeps then this wouldn't have happened. She was the one who suggested going to the bar in the first place. \"Nobody is blaming you,\" Cliff told her and Missy tried to not cry. Crying wasn't cool and she had always learned to use a tough exterior to mask any kind of pain. Still, she had been responsible for this and anything that might happen to Torrance in the future was because she sucked as a person. Torrance shook her head as she reached her other hand out for her. At least she had control over her arms but that didn't mean she wouldn't be confined to a wheelchair. Missy came to her other side and sat down, fluffing the pillow up. \"We'll stay as long as you want,\" Cliff tried to ensure the woman that he loved and Missy nodded in agreement. The next few days, weeks, months, maybe even years would be hard but all three of them had an unconditional love for one another. At least Torrance had a good support base. Cliff sighed, he was going to marry her one day she just needed to feel strong enough to say yes.

What were you missing? Were you just trippin? \"Let's just go home and pretend this whole sorry trip never happened.\" Carson glared at Aiesha in that moment, who had suggested what seemed to be the best option for everyone involved. Although nothing about the situation that lays before them now is ideal. \"What a nightmare.\" Carson groaned in defeat, burying her head in the pillow. The blonde had never imaged that any of this was going to take place this summer, especially the feelings that had developed between her and Brooke. It had all started when Penn-Carson's old boyfriend—had ended his relationship with her this past May, a month before they would see each other again at Camp Spirit Thunder this year. The long distance relationship had been hard on both of them, and in retrospect, the decision had been mutual and a long time coming. The day after the couple had broken up over the phone, Carson had called Brooke, and the other girl had been very supportive, saying that Carson was a beautiful person and that she deserved better. When a very unexpected 'I love you' came from Carson's end of the line, neither of them were prepared for what came next. Brooke confessed her love for the other blonde as well, and after a full two hours of romantic chat about anything and everything, they hung up. Before doing so, however, they had agreed to take things slow. Laying in bed now, Carson wondered how things had gone so wrong after Pepper had forbade the two from dating each other on camp grounds, insisting that it interfered with their teams' credibility. Pepper's reasoning had been a lot deeper than that though. After a tabloid writer in California—Where Camp Spirit Thunder was located—caught a snapshot of Carson and Brooke engaging in a heated lip-lock outside of the practice room, news of their relationship soon spread throughout the state. Sadly, all members of their new team, The East-West Shets, were forced to forfeit this year's competition. Running away from your fear was the best you could do. You made this decision, you chose our Division. Ooh ooh ooh, And I have no regrets, I wish you the very best, in all that you do-o. To Brooke and Carson's dismay, this also meant being separated from each other, with no guarantee that they would be allowed to return next year. Now, as both girls dose off in their separate camp dorms, each one can't help but think of the other, and of the fact that, in the morning, there would be busses waiting to take everyone home. Okay guys, so this was my \"In It To Win It\" One-Shot! Thank you for reading and please review!

Bye for now, and I love you all. ~LittleLiarLovesEmily[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Half of your friends would attend before they ever knew, why they are going, to this party I'm throwing. They would be thinking that I would be pleading to you... to get back together.. well how about Never. Ooh, ooh, ooh…. You're gonna miss me bad. So funny I had to laugh, you did this to you. Yeah you did. Carson awoke the next morning, saddened and discouraged. She was doomed to leave camp, and Brooke, for the duration of the summer. Unlike last year, no master plan in the world could save their team now. As she looked out the window, the young girl saw that the buses had already arrived. It was official, the 'Shets' were done for. The Blonde in the next dorm sighed, as she packed the last of her clothes. The suitcase had been given to her right before sixth grade sleep-away camp. Brooke remembered how nervous her mother was, being as her daughter was only eleven, and it was her first time being away from home for an entire two months. The girl also remembered meeting Carson the following year, when her mother decided it was the end of sleep-away summer camp, and the beginning of cheer camp for Brooke. Even at twelve years-old, the young cheerleader felt as if she and the 'Sharks' Captain would someday be more than friends. Shutting her eyes tight at the memory, Brooke sighs once more. So much has changed since then. Maybe I should just forget my love for Carson and move on. She couldn't help but wonder if something good could ever be achieved by breaking up- By Using Division. Congratulations, you've graduated, to being alone by yourself, let me throw you a party, Farewell. Farewell. Farewell… Farewell… Fare-well –well- well well… Congratulations.. Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

Somehow it was like I didn'tnneed to breath anymore; he moved his right hand to the back of mynhead and tangled his fingers in my hair, in return I slowly turned mynbody so that are legs were crossing in a sitting postition andnwrapped my arms around his neck and pulled back taking in a deepnbreath. \" I missed you. \"nI don't know why I felt it necessary to state the obvious, but I did. \" Missed you toonSkidds.\" As he gave me his arm to help me up my left foot fellnin a puddle of water and slipped, but he quikly grabbed me breakingnmy fall and picked me up bridal style but he didn't put me down henjust started walking. \" What are you doing?n\" \" Carryin' you, yourninjured I can't let you walk in this condition! \" \" Oh come one Pen!nI'm not injured now put me down! \" \" Na. \" Was hisnsimple reply. So I figured I'd just have to squirm my way out,but hisnlock on me just tightened. \" Chill out Skidds! \" \" Fine. \" Inhated how I was so easily defeated by him, it just wasn't fair! Henjust kept walking on until he suddenly stopped, turned around, andnsat down on a random hammok. He postioned me on his lap so that mynback was leaned against his with his hands resting on my legs wichnsent little shivers up my whole body. \" What are younthinking? \" He asked. \" Nothin much, it'snall about you anyways. \" \" What about me?\" \" I was thinking thatnI wish I could always kiss you like that. \" \" Ha! Trust me youncan. What else bout me? \" \" I was thinkingnabout how much you mean to me and how much I miss you when your notnthere. \" \" Can't be more thannme. \" \" You'd be suprised.\" \" We'll have to seenbout dat. \" He said giving a off a little smilethat showed offnhis adorable dimples.

Don't think so!

Evan: Lina, *Pause* I really like you, alot. Lina: I like you a lot too Evan. Evan: *Laughs* Lina: i should probably go i have cheer training.

The world tour. Now the Malibu Jaguars will trial at the Nations competition so we have to step up our game. Now ya'll down?' I enthused. \"Yeah!\" the team yelled, excited.\"Let's get to work than aye?\" I ran off to check the time on my cell and noticed i had a message. As soon as i looked at the screen i saw 1 Unread Message, i instantly thought Evan. Hey, babe. Only Me. How's Training going? Just thought i would tell you that the Jags are going For that huge world tour, because Avery finds loosing To you depressing and degrading, she won't stop crying! I'll call you tomorrow, Bye. Evan x ;) How corny can this guy get? I showed Sky, Christina, Trey & Gloria the message, Avery knows what our old routine looked & sounded like, we needed something new something fresh no-one had ever seen before! This was my chance to shine and Avery will not ruin this for us, we beat them fair and square at the All Star Championships. Now i had 3 months to have a totally new cheer routine. The next day – Evan: Hey Lina: Hello Evan: i was just thinking about you & i thought i would drop you a line. How are you? How was training? Lina: You also said you would call me today! *Laughs* Training was long & stressful, we have 3 months to come up with a totally original routine, but other than that i am great, yourself? Evan: I'm good. Hey i was thinking, if you need any help with the routine i could help out? Lina: For 1 Avery would flip out & how could you help. Oh, i got it, you could teach us some of your basketball moves and then remember when we had that salsa party thing? We could add couple dancing! That would be dope! Evan: Haha, i am not sure i approve of you dancing with another man Lina, being your boyfriend and all. Lina: If i say you can help can i use that in my routine? You can help show everyone what i mean! Evan: Only if you wear that sparkly red bra again, for me! Lina: mmm, maybe. I don't even know if i still own it! Evan: i am sure you'll be able to find it. Lina: *Laughs* So will you come down to training with me on Monday? To help train the team. Evan: Okay, so its what Thursday today because we are going out tomorrow night so yeah Monday it is! I'll pick you and the girls up at say 2? And Avery doesn't have to know about this! Lina: Of course not! I better go, Sky needs me. Evan: I'll pick you up at 8 tomorrow k babe? Lina: Yeh that sounds great. Bye x[Chapter 2] LPOV: I fell asleep that night clutching my phone to my heart. My relationship with Evan seemed like a dream, it was so unreal, so fiction, so fairytale. I woke to the sound of my mobile phone vibrating and playing the song Nothing on You. I pressed on, and my phone slowly began to turn on. Evan's photo flashed up on the screen saying \"1 New Message – Evan\" I was eager to see what the message said and without thinking pressed view. Hey gorgeous Lina, Just thought i would text you and see if your still on for tonight, are you? Uh yeah this is Evan, love you buy xx I loved getting a text from Evan first thing in the morning, it was so exciting. Evan was the perfect boyfriend; this began my rather long day dream of him. This was interrupted by Gloria coming into my room screaming, i glanced at my alarm clock. Crap! It was already 11 am! I just had time to get the group to training. I was in the middle of getting myself ready for training when my phone ran – it was Evan. Lina: Hello? Evan: Hey beautiful, did you get my text! Lina: The one that woke me up you mean? *Lina Laughs* Evan: Oh, I'm sorry i didn't realise. Lina: Haha, so what time am i being picked up tonight? Evan: ahh, so you decided to come? 8pm Lina: i was never not coming, by the way thank you for coming to training to training on Monday and teaching us those moves. Evan: Oh, anytime. Imma really enjoy spending extra time with you. Lina: haha Evan: too cheesy? Lina: nah i like it... Evan: well i should get going to basketball Lina: haha, have fun with that Evan: see you at 8 Lina: Bye Training Well everything was working out fine at training, until one of my lightest girls fell and broke her ankle doing a back handspring. Talk about depressing just under 3 months away from the competition. I am so SCREWED how could she quit on me? This is like my worst cheer-mare, i am so annoyed right now, this is not fair. Hopefully Evan can make me feel better tonight.[Chapter 3] Bring It On: Fight To The Finish Sequel Written by lucyflorence Evan is one to make people feel fantastic. On top of your game, his smile alone is enough to do that. I guess in a way it's destiny that I moved here from East LA. As much as I missed it, the opportunities here are so much better and bigger and richer. Now that I have been in Malibu for a while it's grown on me. It's still lifestyles of the rich and annoying, but in a way i think that Trey, Gloria and I fit in. The beach is the best thing about this place. Perfect to relax on, perfect to meditate on, perfect to stretch on and definitely perfect to cheer on. Beach practice is certainly my favourite of all. I miss some aspects of East Los, like the community and how the people there kept it real. But despite all, I am happy. UCLA is where I will be attending in the fall. It's strange! I am a college girl now. Unfortunately so is Avery. Maybe we might get along. Maybe we'll become cheerleaders on the same team. Maybe she'll come to her scenes that i am not so bad. Maybe she should be my enemy, sure she's not my favourite person (her brother is) but that doesn't mean I hate her. SKY's P.O.V It's almost 9 o'clock. I am nervous. Christina's nervous. Yet Lina is so excited. It's our double date with our totally hot boyfriends. The twins. Josh and Blake (Couldn't find their names). Tonight would be the time of our lives. We invited Lina and Evan, Gloria and Victor but neither couple could make it. Shame. I am so lucky to have a sister like Lina. She's the perfect cheerleader, makeup artist and she looks the best in tight leather pants. And that's a hard look to pull off. The doorbell just rang. Christina and Sky rushed down the stairs, their hair flying everywhere, the heels clunking and their smile wide. ","Summary":" SORRY IT'S A BIT SHORT, ITS MY FIRST STORY. I HOPE YOU ENJOY IT!

Wake UP! It is 12:30. I have some good news to tell you. .\" my dad yelled anxiously from downstairs. \"I'm coming!\" I said groggily in a rather mean tone. I slowly crawled out of my bed and brushed my teeth. I quickly combed my hair with a couple strokes of my hair brush and trudged down the stairs. Waiting to hear my dads \"exciting\" news. As I walked down the stairs I started to worry. Every time my dad calls me to tell me that he has some good news it's always something horrible. Like last summer, he called me downstairs to tell me that he had got me a sweater. You must be thinking, what's so bad about a sweater? You don't know my dad. He has the worst sense of style. The sweater was pink and frilly with little hearts on the side and in big letters in the middle there was daddy's little girl. I shuddered just thinking of the ugly sweater. As I got to the bottom of the steps I saw my dad grinning from ear to ear. I was starting to dread ever waking up. This was going to be a big one. My dad decided to go for it and tell me right off the bat. \"Sarah, you haven't seen your mother or your sister since your mom and I got a divorce.\" \"And….\" I said not understanding where this conversation was going. \"Your mother and I decided that instead of you and your sister, Abigail switching houses, we decided to have one big \"family\" get together\" \"WHAT!\" I screamed. \"We are all going to get together. You, Abigail, your mom and I .\" \"WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? I HATE ABIGAIL!\" I was bawling now. \" I'm not done Sarah, wait, since your mom is a nurse its hard for her to take days off, at the last minute, the hospital called her and told her that she needed to come to the hospital, so…\" I could see my dad was starting to get nervous and antsy. His face was sweating and he was biting his lip. \"What? Is the picnic cancelled?\" I said excitedly. I was suddenly starting to feel better thinking that maybe for once in my life I was having good luck. \"Actually your mom is going to stay at the hospital and…\" my dad seemed a little hesitant to say this. \" WHAT?!\" I am an impatient girl and I needed to know what he wanted to say! \" Your sister is coming alone.\" My dad whispered so quietly I had to strain to hear him. \"WHAT?\" I screamed so LOUD I think our neighbors could hear me screaming. After that I just wanted to get away and I didn't want to hear anything more my dad has to say. I ran up the stairs as fast as I could and slammed my door with a big bang. I ran to my bed and grabbed my diary. I wrote in my neatest handwriting even though my hand writing looks like Chicken Scratch. Dear Journal, I AM SO MAD! My dad planned some kind of \"family get together. I was kind of happy when he told me that I was going to see mom again. Then he told me that mom was on call at the hospital and that only ABIGAIL was coming. I HATE Abigail more than anyone. All she does is harasses me. You see, she is older than me, so she thinks that she is the boss of me. She pulls my hair and plays mean tricks on me. I'll have to ask my dad later when she is coming. I hope its not very soon. Maybe I will be able to get away at a friends house? 3, Sarah. I quickly shut my diary as I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. I dont want to talk to my dad, so I quickly went on the computer to log onto AIM so he couldn't bother me when he came in. Luckily, Bella was online, my best friend. Bells123- Hi! ItsSarahh- Hey! I've got some news to tell you. Bells123- What is it? Is it one of your dad's \"good news\" ItsSarahh- Yes. Bells123- Tell me. I heard a knock, oh no, this must be my dad. I thought. Sure enough my dad stuck his head in the room. \"Sarah? Can I come in?\" my dad asked. \" No, I am on AIM talking to Bella, talk to me later.\" I told him. \" Ok, but just to let you know, your sister is going to be here in 1 day,March 9. \" Okay. I'll be ready.\" I mumbled. My dad closed the door, and I heard him slowly walk down the stairs. By this time Bella had sent me 10 IMS asking me what happened and where I went. ItsSarahh- Sorry my dad came in the room to like tell me something. Bells123- So what happened? ItSarahh- My mom and dad planned a family get together, with my mom, ABIGAIL, my dad, and me. Then my mom got a call from the hospital saying she needed to be in the hospital. So now its just ABIGAIl coming. She'll be here in 1 day. Bells123- OMG! Sarah I'm so sorry! Your sister is going to tear you apart! ItsSarahh- I know! Just then I heard a soft squeak come from across the room. I quickly looked across the room, I saw my guinea pig sitting impatiently. I realized I hadn't played with her all day! ItsSarahh- I got to go, I'll talk to you later. I logged off of AIM and went to go and play with my guinea pig, Misty. She is so cute, she has brown around her eyes and then white on her back, then its brown from there on. I love multicolored guinea pigs! I took her out of her cage and put her down she immediately RAN for under the bed,her favorite place to hide. I shrugged and went to go and read my book on my bed, I left the cage open so she could get in when she was done running around. 30 minutes later, Misty ran back in her cage. I closed her cage and took a nap. I slowly slipped into a deep sleep. \"DING-DONG!\"The loud doorbell rang. I ran to go and answer it there standing there was my sister Abigail. She had curly, light brown hair. It was really frizzy, she looked like mad scientist. She was wearing the ugliest shirt ever. It was bright yellow with white lace on the bottom. It had IN YOUR DREAMS written on the front in dark red. Her pants were an ugly color of green, they had bright pink polka dots all over them. She slowly stepped in to give me a hug. She opened her arms and then gave me a hug squeezing me so hard I couldn't breathe. She let me go and I fell to the floor with a THUD! \"WHOA!\" I woke up with a jerk. I shook as I slowly got up to check the time. It was 6:30 PM. I quickly got out of bed and combed my hair. I went downstairs to eat some dinner. I didn't want to eat with dad so I just warmed up a frozen dinner. I didn't want tomorrow to come. I knew my sister was going to be here bright and early. I ate my dinner and then decided to just go to sleep so I didn't think about tomorrow. I laid in bed for about 45 minutes and then I finally fell asleep. I woke up from my sleep on Monday,March 9. Today was going to be the worst day of my life. Today was the day that Abigail came. I quickly got out of bed knowing that I soon would wish I didn't. I brushed my teeth and went downstairs. My dad was sitting at the dining room table drinking coffee and reading the newspaper. \"Good Morning Sarah.\" my dad exclaimed brightly. \"Good Morning Dad.\" I mumbled. \" Abigail is coming today.\" my dad said. I dont understand what part of I HATE ABIGAIL my dad doesn't understand. \"I know. What time?\" I asked. \"She will be here, at 12:00 thats two hours from now.\" my dad said. \" Okay, and how long will she be staying here?\" I asked. \" I am not sure, as long as she needs to.\" my dad said. Oh wow this is worse than I thought. She could stay for a whole year if she needed to and my dad wouldn't care. \"Dad? I am going to go upstairs to go and get ready.\" I told him. \"Alright.\" He said from behind his newspaper. I went up the stairs and straightened my hair,and then picked out the best outfit I could find. I picked out a pretty plain gray shirt that had FITCH NY 92 written on the top. I slipped on some dark blue pants. I pulled out posters of singers that I like and posted them all around my room. I had to make my room look good for Abgail so she has one less thing to tease me about. I was finally ready. I looked at the clock, it was 11:50 that gave me ten minutes to spare. I thought of Bella and decided to talk to Bella on the phone. I dialed the numbers. \" Hello?\" \" Hey, its me Sarah.\" \" Oh hi, How are you? Is Abigail over yet?\" \"No not yet, but she will be here in a couple of minutes.\" \" Oh,well you know that if you ever want to come over you always have the offer?\" \" Aw, thats so sweet. I will take that for granted. Don't worry.\" \" She should be here any minute now. I better go.\" \" Alright, Good Luck. I hope you don't get beat to pulp!\" \"Your such a good friend. The last words you say to me are going to be I hope you don't get beat to pulp!\" \"Haha, Bye Sarah.\" \"Bye, Bella\" As soon as I hung up the phone, the doorbell rang. \"DING-DONG!\" This time I was sure I wasn't dreaming. I went downstairs to open the door. When I opened the door, I gasped in horror.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Abigailnwas standing in the doorway with 2 suitcases and a carry-on. I thinknshe planned to stay for long. She was beautiful,she had long straightnbrown hair that wasn't frizzing a single bit. She had on a beautifulnyellow Hollister shirt on. She had pretty black jeans on that Incould tell were from American Eagle. She had new black conversen was so pretty I had a feeling that I was going to becomenjealous of her. I decided to be polite and I welcomed her in. \" Come in.\" I exclaimed trying to be positive about thisnwhole thing. \" Okay.\" She saidnobviously not wanting to talk. She seemed in a bad mood. My dadnwalked in the room. \" Hi Abigail!OH I'venmissed you so much!\" He wrapped her in a big bear hug. \" Oh, I've missed you too!\" All of a sudden she seemed tonbe all energetic and happy. \" Here give menyour bags.I'll take them up to your room.\" my dad said trying tonhelp. \" Thats so nice, thanks dad.\" Inwas suprised that she had already started to call her dad not feelingnshy at all. My dad slowly walked up the stairs and put her bags innMY room! \"DAD!\" I screamed. Henjumped in alarm.\" What is it Sarah you nearly gave me a heartnattack.\" \"Why is SHE in my room?nWe've got a guest bedroom.\" He sighed.\" Sarah, younhaven't seen your sister in nearly two years, I want you to bond withneach other.\" \"but...\" \"No buts Sarah she will sleep on your room on the air mattress.\"nI could hear a hint of annoyance in his voice. I stomped my footnon the floor in frustration and glared at him. I couldn't believenthis. We have a guest room but my dad decides to make her sleep here.nI felt the urge to call Bella and tell her this. Then I suddenlynremembered Misty,Would she do anything to her? \" Abigail you can unpack your stuff in Sarah's room or if younwant to have more space, you can just unpack in the guest room.\"nmy dad added. \" I think I'll unpack innhere, and if I need anymore space I'll go put it in the guest room.\"nAbigail said. \" Alright, well I'm going tonleave you two girls alone, to bond with each other.\" my dadnexclaimed as he walked out the room seeming rather happy withnhimself. \" So, Sarah,\" Abigailnobviously trying to make small talk. \"nSo, Abigail how have you been doing since I last saw you?\" \"Fine, She slowly turned away and started to unpack hernstuff. \" I'm going to go on the computer.\"nI said as I went over to the computer in my room. I wasn't everngoing to leave Abigail alone in my room this weekend if I hadnthe choice. I sat down and logged into AIM and my email. Bella wasnonline, so I decided to start talking to her. ItsSarahh- Hey! Bells123- Oh, Hi, I didn't even see you online, I was sending annemail to AnneMarie saying that we were going to have a meetingntomorrow, for a girls night out, which your invited to by the way. ItsSarahh- Oh, really? Well, I'll ask my dad but Abigail got herena while ago! Bells123- Oh really? Whats going on with her?nAnything bad? ItsSarahh- Well.... Bells123- what? ItsSarahh- nMy dad is making me share a room with her, you know we have a guestnroom but he said that we need to \"bond\" and so she'snunpacking right now, I am afraid of whats going to happen with Misty,nI know she'd do something to her. Bells123- You'll be fine! I'mnsure she's changed by now, and maybe she will be nice to you. ItsSarahh- I don't think so , when she was coming in she was likentalking to me in a bad mood and then when my dad walked in the roomnshe immediately perked up. I think she's up to something. Also did Intell you she has so much luggage. I think she plans to stay forna while. Bells123- You know that you can come over to my housenafter to school, tell your dad you need to study! I'm sure it can'tnme that bad. ItsSarahh- I hope your right. Bells123-nWell I have to go now, my mom wants me to go and clean my room, callnme later tonight to tell me whether you can come to girls nightnout. ItsSarahh- Alright, I'll talk to you later. Bye. Bells123-nBye! Bella logged off and I decided to get off too, I wondered ifnAbigail was done unpacking, I really wanted to go downstairs andnwatch some T.V but I didn't want to leave Abigail alone in my room,nwho knows what'd she screw up! I got up from the computer chair, andnturned around to see Abigail sitting on my bed reading my diary.[Chapter 3] CHAPTERn3 \"ABIGAIL!\"nI shouted angrily. \" What?\" Shenasked innocently, trying the hide the fact that she had been READINGnMY DIARY! \"You were just reading myndiary!\" I exclaimed angrily. \" Oh?nThis is your Diary?\" She asked as she held out my diary. \"OF COURSE IT IS! CAN'T YOU TELL BY THE DATES AND THE WRITINGSnCALLED DEAR JOURNAL?\" I shouted. \"Well,nI'm sorry, I knew but I just wanted to see what you were thinking.\"nshe said, blushing. \" That's nonexcuse,its my personal diary,and you shouldn't have been reading it.nI am telling dad!\" I said trying to sound calm. All of a suddennher face got red with anger and she looked like she was going to killnme. \"YOU WOULDN'T DARE TO TELL DAD ONnME!\" she screamed in my face. I could feel her hot breath on mynface. \" W-w-w-h-h-y-y\" Inwhimpered. \" If you want to go ahead, butnbye-bye Misty.\" Abigail exclaimed a little bit calmer thisntime. \" Y-o-o-u-u would d-d-o-o such ant-t-h-h-ing to poor little Misty?\" I stuttered building up myncourage for Misty. \" I might seem all nicenand preppy for dad,but for you, I'm still that evil older sister ofnyours. Don't think that I have changed and am going to be nice tonyou.\" she exclaimed with a feeling of triumph in her voice. \" Alright,I don't want Misty to get hurt,and just because I amngiving into this, doesn't mean that you can just tell me what to donall the time! YOU ARENT THE BOSS OF ME!\" I screamed at her. \"Suree.\" my sister said calmy. She was acting as if shenknew best and she thought she could just walk all over me. Myndad's head peeked out from behind the door,\" Is everything allnright in there?\" I looked at my sister with a face as if showingnher that I was the boss and I was going to tell him. She turned hernhead to look at me and give me an evil glare. I turned my head backnto my dad. \"Of course dad we were justnhaving a little arguement about who is going to sleep on the bed andnwho is going to sleep on the floor.\" I lied. \" Yea! Every thing is going to be all right. I am sure we cannwork it out.\" Abigail said. \" Wellnalright then, when you two are done unpacking and talking, pleasencome downstairs there is something I would like to tell you.\" myndad exclaimed mysteriously.

But worse thing yet her own brother Evan was dating Lina, \"Cat.\" Story begins in Lina's POV: Gosh, I'm freaking out so much, right now. Me and my girls started to join hands and cross are fingers. As ENEWS guest host is about to announce the results from the judges. \" So the new All Stars Cheerleaders are, \" The Malibu Dream Team\"!!! Ahhhhhhhhh!!!! , Me and Sky, Gloria, and Treyvonetta started screaming. Evan came down with Victor. Then immediately Avery started whining \" huh it's not fair\". Then Evan said awww… I know losing sucks\" . He hugs her tight, then in back of her he does to me the\"Call me sign .\" I just grined at him, it was pretty hyster- ical seeing Avery acting so child-like. Then me, Sky, Gloria, and Treyvonetta went to take the picture with are trophy. Later that night : Lina's and Sky's parents threw them a party to celebrate, The Dream Team winning the All Stars championship. Lina POV : Ya mama Ya mama by Alabina featuring Ishtar and Los Ninos de la Sara, was playing, me and gloria started dancing. Ya know the rib roll, and moving your hips to the music, type of dancing. \"Mirar a Lina bailar\", Gloria yelled. I yelled at her, \" Y POR QUE NO BAILAR CONMIGO ?\" We both burst out laughing, then Treyvonetta was tranlating to Sky. \" Jeez I seriously need to learn spanish\", DAM IT !!! , said Sky. Me ,Gloria, and this time Treyvonetta burst out laughing. Now there's some more kids from school arriving. I couldn't believe my fucking eyes, the Jaguars are here. I turned my head to Gloria, Treyvonetta, and Sky. \" Por que ellos estan aqui ??? \", I said. Gloria said, \" I don't know? \" My mom walked by and said, \" hija just ignore them ,and have fun, you need to celebrate, and your team winning the competition.\" UGHHHH!!!!, calm down I told my self. Then right that second, my stomach flipped. Oh no… Evan had just walked in with his parents. Don't get me wrong im glad Evan brought his parents to meet me. Im just scared on what they'll think about me. Think about it, see how Avery turned out, and that's his sister. Yes, I know im being stupid, but you know what I'll just be myself. Lina !!!, Evan yelled after me, I smiled at him and walked over. Hey cutie, I hugged him. He pulled my chin up and kissed me I kissed back, and depened it. We pulled back and he told me later. Caramba!!!, I yelled and he laughed. Congratulations !!!, he told me. Thank you, I see you don't have to deal with Avery whining. Yes, thank goodness, I mean common it's a competition, said Evan. So come on I have some people for you to meet, I said. Evan followed his girlfriend to the backyard huge patio. Hey guys, Evan this Carmen and Christina, Jordan and Sanders,etc. Everyone this is Evan, my boyfriend. Hey mami yo sabia que no eras solamente un amigo, Christina and Carmen said. Cerrar!!!, stop making me blush. Evan bent his neck down to my ear, and whispered your adorable when u blush. I whispered back in his ear, si pero tu te ves sexy cuando no tiene la camisa puerta. Especially at basketball practice, then I pecked his lips. Babe, your sexy when you speak spanish, BUT I HAVE NO CLUE WHAT YOUR SAYING!!! Your cuban yet you don't know spanish, I dios mio! Now what did you say, all I heard was sexy, Evan said. Tienes que learn aprender espanol, I yelled at him. Ok now I actually understood that, smart one, Evan said. I laughed then he just grabbed me, and forced his lips against mine. It went from intense to passionate, and it was amaizing. There one thing I know for sure about Evan is that he an amaizing kisser. We pulled apart and went ouside and joined everyone on the dance floor. You know the place where we did, flavor school. Drop it hot by Misty was playing in the background. I started dancing moving my hips to the beat of the music. He grabbed my hips, you know what they call, the love handle's. {authors note: copy and paste this link listen to song while reading: .com/watch?v=Thw0WQSn7_8 } ah ah whoh dale mambo ah (entre tu y yo) dale mambo (daddy) son cosas que pasan en el barrio fino. esa noche contigo la pase bien (whoh) pero yo me entere que te debes a alguien (yey) y tu fallaste pero ya es tarde y tu fallaste pero ya es tarde lo que paso, paso (daddy on the 4th time) entre tu y yo (x4) es una asesina ella conlleva la medicina engañadora que te envuelve y te domina una abusadora ella como sabe te devora y si no tienes experiencia te enamora una especialista para que te ponga ella a la vista para ser hechizera un hombre en su vista que si es maliciosa yo que la trate como una diosa me engano y ahora me llama como loca (aha) Every one started to do this part : you know guys have their hands around girs waist from behind and grind presea dale presea si ya no estamos juntos otra mujer me jaldea (mami) presea dale presea que pocos son los indios y hay mucha india en la aldea sabes presea dale presea no dejes pa mañana no dejes que te lo lleva (ama) presea dale presea ahora estas celosa porque otra me desea aha esa noche contigo la pase bien (whoh) pero yo me entere que te debes a alguien (yey) y tu fallaste pero ya es tarde y tu fallaste pero ya es tarde lo que paso, paso entre tu y yo (x4) presea dale presea si ya no estamos juntos otra mujer me jaldea mami presea dale presea que pocos son los indios y hay mucha india en la aldea sabes presea dale presea no dejes pa mañana no dejes que te lo llevan ama presea dale presea ahora estas celosa porque otra me desea aha (dile) yo si soy soltero ma y tu presea yo saco otra a bailar y tu presea tu comes en todo laos y me presea si tienes dueno ma por que presea (vamos a dejar esto claro ya ok) lo que paso, paso entre tu y yo (x4) ah (ah only say two ah once) dale mambo (x2) luny tunes son cosas que pasan en el barrio fino daddy elle (saci dad dad repeat 2 times) daddy yankee yo { authors note: i do not own song i dont own anything except where the story headed dont own characters credit for lyrics to .com } So what did you guys think of ep.1 and two ???

Evan and I went back inside. Evans sister who kind of my enemy, Avery was still here with her friends. She had to stay because she and Evan's parents were still here. I haven't been introduced yet, but I will soon Evan had assured me. As soon as Avery walked through my door earlier today, she was pissed. I later found out she was forced to come. So she brought a few members of her team. Evan and Avery's parents had met my mother and my step-father; right after Avery had walked in before them. My mother loved Evan, and so did my new step father Henry. So now a few hours later, I was currently lying down on the hammock with my head on Evans chest, by the pool. It was relaxing, there was a soft breeze going by and we were silent, but a conferrable silence. I felt so relaxed that I hadn't even realized that my eyes had closed. Evan started to rub his hand up and down my back. I started laughing when he thought it was funny to go a little bit further down, to my ass. I sighed and lifted my head up, you make me feel so…happy, and you know that, right? Evan grinned at me and then said, I should be the one saying that right now, because it's true, you do make me happy. I smirked at him, and then said, fine we both make each- other happy and I grinned at him. That's another thing I like about you, you're so stubborn. Your nothing like any of the other girls that I've dated or had interest in, he said to me. I frozed, is that a good thing? I asked. He laughed, of course you're unique and you act yourself, you don't put an act like most girls. You know what? He asked me. What? I replied to him. I love you, he said. Immediately without thinking I yelled out, I love you more! But once I realized what I had said, I didn't regret it. He just pulled me closer and then locked his lips in mine. I giggled while kissing him. He started to pull away and I pulled him back towards me, and he didn't pull away clearly understanding what I wanted. After we pulled away about…fifth teen minutes later, we were trying to catch our breath. He then asked me, you don't think we are moving too fast? Hell no!!! , I said and he laughed at my response. The wind was starting to shake a little too much, so we ended up falling out of the hammock. Then we started laugh like crazy. Gloria started laughing at us out of nowhere. Then we saw she was with Victor, Sky, Christina, and Trey-vonneta, who was laughing so hard she, was crying. I looked at Evan then back at him. Then I said, how long have you guys been standing there? Umm maybe fifth teen minutes or so, and we took some pictures, bye they said in a rush then they ran away. I laughed they think I'm going to kill them I laughed again. Evan raised an eyebrow, and then said are you??? I laughed maybe not right now maybe later. Then he started laughing at my facial expression. I know that you are going to kill them when I leave, huh? You know me so well, and that's what I love about you. Really, then show me that you love me huh, Evan challenged me. I crushed my lips to my hot looking boyfriend. He started to suck my tongue and I was beginning to moan. When out of nowhere we hear and saw a camera go off. I bit my lip, and then I started to yell to my friends without looking at them, and said, \"Tienes cinco segundos para corer ahora porque te voy a cohere!!!\" Translation is you have 5 seconds to run now because I'm going to get you. Evan was laughing so hard after I had said that he was literally turning red-purple. I got off him then, when they saw me get up they started running. I tackled Gloria and we collided into the pool. Victor and Evan were laughing when we hit the top surface of the water. Victor offered me his hand to pull me out and I smiled at him and took this as an opportunity. Evan knew what was coming and said dude she so got you now. Huh? Victor asked dumbly not understanding what Evan had met. I grabbed his hand and pulled Victor in the water with me and Gloria. Evan if you keep laughing at this rate you are either one, going to have a heart attack two, going to run out of air. I giggled at his appearance. He was on the floor, laughing his head off, his head was practically purple. Victor reached to him and pulled him in the pool. When Evan hit the top surface of the water we burst out laughing. Evan looked at me with an amused expression, \"You think this is funny don't you?\" I laughed at him and said sarcastically, si. He grabbed me and started tickling me to death. I burst out giggling like crazy. Evan! aye dios mio! I yelled at him, begging him to stop. Then he pushed the both of us under water and kissed me. When we hit the surface, Gloria said lets go change to swimsuits. I got out of the water. Then me and Gloria, asked Sky, Christina, and Trey-vonneta if they were coming with us. They thanked us but said no, so me and Gloria were off to her room and my room.

Ofelia dio una última mirada a la piedra y noto que encima del bebe se asomaban dos diminutos cuernos. ¿Que clase de bebe tenía cuernos? Ambos pasearon en el jardín del laberinto, Ofelia se había escapado a mitad de la noche después de una terrible pesadilla. Decidió acudir con el Fauno para que la consolara, su madre había muerto y Mercedes no se encontraba con ella. El sueño se había alejado de ella y no podía dormir, lo único que podría hacer era distraer su mente. Fue con su llamado protector. Con su Fauno. \"¿Alguna vez te has enamorado? \" Ambos habían estado caminando en círculos por minutos y el silenció entre ellos se estaba volviendo asfixiante. Ofelia pregunto sin pensar, se arrepintió al momento que la pregunta salió de su boca, tuvo que haber tapado sus labios y sellar la pregunta tonta. Ofelia se avergonzó y rápidamente intento corregir su error \"No es necesario que me digas, pregunte algo descortés, lo siento\" sintió que sus mejillas se llenaban de color, intento ocultarlas con sus manos pero estas eran visibles, incluso en la lúgubre noche. El Fauno se detuvo y miro a la pequeña Ofelia avergonzada. \"No es una pregunta tonta, su alteza\" se hinco a la altura de ella y retiro de sus mejillas las manos. Admirando como la luz bella de la luna pintaba la dulce piel de su princesa. Paso el dorso de su mano en sus suaves mejillas, con cuidado de no lastimarla con sus pequeñas ramas sueltas, sintiendo como la piel de la princesa se relajaba ante su caricia. El sonrió satisfecho, mirando la linda carita de su bella princesa bañada por la luz tenue de la luna. Ella disfruto tanto de su tacto que cerro los ojos y disfruto de la mano del Fauno descansando suavemente en su mejilla, sus labios se crisparon, llamando la atención del Fauno que no evito dar un visto bueno a los labios cereza de la princesa que parecían hipnotizarlo. Labios suaves y sedosos... 'Mi bella princesa, ¿me estarás torturando con tu encanto?' pensó el Fauno sin apartar la vista de ella, tan dulce e infantil en esta vida. Su esposa linda convertida en una pequeña puberta. Tan lejana a los deseos carnales que albergaban en el Fauno. \"Si mi princesa, yo me he enamorado y aún lo estoy\" Ofelia abrió los ojos, sintiendo una extraña pulsada de celos desconocidos y se aparto lentamente del Fauno. Midiendo su tono de voz rápidamente pregunto de quien se trataba, mientras caminaba a un pequeño sendero de flores y jugueteo con los pétalos. Ella no entendía que fue ese extraño sentimiento, tan raro y repentino. Las hadas aparecieron, volando al rededor de la princesa mientras emitían sonidos indescifrables para los oídos humanos, esto incluía a la pequeña princesa. El Fauno rápidamente entendió lo que las hadas le contaban, ella se había puesto celosa por su respuesta. Le causo diversión la actitud desinteresada que intento mostrar, pero fue todo lo contrarío, le estaba mostrando lo evidente, estaba molesta. Se acerco tras de ella y decidió contarle sobre su amor. \"Yo me enamore de una bella joven, tan bella y hermosa, que era la favorita de la luna\" Ofelia mordió sus labios por lo meloso que sonaba cuando hablaba de ella. No sabía porqué sentía esta clase de celos, por un lado era un picor molesto y por el otro un encanto, estaba en un estado de duda. El Fauno se hinco a lado de ella y la rodeó con sus brazos \"Era una bella princesa que hacía a este triste Fauno sentir un cosquilleo en todo sus robles\" la sostuvo más cerca y olfateo su sedoso cabello, aspirando el olor de la persona que más ha amado y que por fin a encontrado, después de tanto esfuerzo, él esperaría por ella, no importaba cuanto. En Ofelia un escalofrió se revolvió en su pecho y se apoyo más cerca del Fauno que le daba seguridad. El cabello de su protector le hizo cosquillas a sus mejillas y sonrió al presentir un recuerdo sin recordar en su corazón, era una experiencia similar que jamas tuvo la oportunidad de sentir. Quizás un recuerdo lejano que deseaba resurgir de la mente de Ofelia. El abrazo era tan intimo, tan dulce, tan familiar, tan... romantico. Ofelia sin pensarlo, como instinto, volteó hacia donde se encontraba el Fauno queriendola, y cerro con delicadeza sus ojos, poniendo sus manos al costado del Fauno y ofreciendole el beso más tierno e inocente en los labios del ser que más a estado esperando por ella. El Fauno agito sus orejas, pasmado por lo sucedido, abrió los ojos asombrado, dudando de regresar el lindo beso o retirarse. Admiro como los pequeños labios cereza estaban fruncidos, entre abiertos para recibir mil y un millón de besos más. El aliento a menta de su alteza lo volvía a llamar, y le pedía discretamente que dejara de lado sus restricciones y se entregara a su princesa que tanto anhelaba por él. Su princesa, su pequeña, su esposa. Acaricio las pequeñas caderas de Ofelia, acercandolo a el y poso sus labios contra los de ella, un beso que hizo suspirar a la princesa y pedía por más, más y más, ese \"más\" que aún Ofelia no entendía del todo. Las hadas comenzaron a reír y a revolotear mientras miraban la extraña escena del Fauno y su princesa. El Fauno se separo del beso sin malicia y beso por último la pequeña nariz de la princesa, que yacía casi derretida en sus brazos. Su princesa jamas parara de sorprenderle, aún así, ella ve hermosura en el. A pesar que aún falta mucho por restaurar por tantos años de vigilia. Notas de Autor: Se suponía que habría una relación más... carnal/romantica entre ellos, pero lo dejamos por aquí. En el futuro quizás si les dedique algo más, sexual. A si es, me gustan las parejas raras, que les puedo decir...

No se esperaba terminar cubierta de lodo y mucho menos arruinar el vestido que su madre le había hecho, pero al menos tenía una razón para todo eso; aunque aún asi dudaba que le creyeran si les decía que había salvado un árbol mágico de haber muerto por culpa de un gran sapo. Termino de lavarse, asegurándose de no dejar ningún residuo de suciedad en ella. Se colocó el pijama y a hurtadillas salía para dejarse guiar por el hada hacia el laberinto. Estaba emocionada por contarle al fauno que había completado su primera misión. Aunque también impaciente, quería preguntarle para que era esa llave. Empezó a bajar las escaleras y vio a su alrededor en busca del fauno. Pero no lo vio. En su lugar, sus ojos vieron aquella piedra central en donde estaban tallados tres personas. Se acercó sin miedo y pasó sus manos por los detalles de la pequeña mujer y el bebé. Al hacerlo, un extraño sentimiento de tristeza se posiciono en su pecho. No sabía la razón, pero de pronto se sintió decaída y sola. Todo eso se esfumo de su mente cuando vio al hada en su nueva forma y escucho un ruido a sus espaldas. Se giró con rapidez y se encontró con el fauno, quien al parecer estaba comiendo algo que parecía… ¿carne, tal vez? —Hola— lo saludo con timidez. Levanto la llave y se la mostro con la esperanza de estar un paso más cerca de su hogar —. He traído la llave. —Ese soy yo— dijo ignorando lo que acababa de decirle. Miro atrás de ella y se topó con la piedra que hace poco estaba viendo. Ya fijándose bien, era cierto lo que él decía. Podía reconocer sus cuernos —, y la niña sois vos. — ¿Y el bebé? — inquirió. Al preguntarle eso, lo noto algo inquieto; incluso había dejado de comer. En vez de contestarle le dijo lo mismo que ella ya había dicho hace poco, que tenía la llave. Decidio ignorar todo eso por el momento, tal vez no era nada y ella se lo estaba imaginando todo. La inquieta fue ella cuando, después de que él le diera la tiza, empezó a acariciarle el rostro con lentitud y firmeza. —Pronto pasearemos por los siete patios concéntricos de vuestro palacio— lo noto bastante feliz, incluso emocionado cuando le había dicho eso. Recordó lo que Mercedes le había dicho de los faunos y lo que pasaba entre ambos casi desde que había llegado. ¿Acaso debía desconfiar de él? Quién sabe. Pero por el momento solo debía concentrarse en hacer su segunda prueba. Ojala esta fuera menos sucia que la anterior. Tantas cosas habían pasado ya. Había dejado morir a dos de sus hadas por desobedecer al fauno. Había perdido su única oportunidad para volver a casa. Su madre había muerto durante la labor de parto. Y Vidal la había encerrado en su habitación después de haberla atrapado escapando junto a Mercedes; sin contar que la había abofeteado e insultado. Estaba destruida. Estaba sola. Y lo peor de todo, es que de alguna manera que sentía que era su culpa. Todo. Se sorprendió mucho al ver de nuevo al hada y al fauno en su habitación. En ese instante no le importo las dudas que tenía con él hace días, y tampoco que aún no supiera como era que lograba entrar sin que nadie lo descubriera. Nada de eso le interesaba. Lo único importante es que estaba ahí. Se levantó y corrió hacia el para abrazarlo con fuerza; se sintió aún mejor y con más ganas de llorar cuando lo sintió corresponder sin demora. Ciegamente, miedosa de volver a perder todo y quedarse sola de nuevo, acepto acatar sus órdenes al pie de la letra para demostrar que no se había vuelto mortal y que merecía ir a casa. —Recoged a vuestro hermano…y traédmelo al laberinto, lo antes posible, alteza. Eso le pareció raro, pero al intentar saber más la silencio. Solo le dio más tiza para que pudiera escapar y se fue ocultándose en las sombras como siempre. No tardo en ponerse a trabajar. Esa noche seria la luna llena. Ya no había espacio para errores. Lo único que quería, era regresar a casa y ya no sufrir nunca más. Llego con su hermano al laberinto y luego de correr sin rumbo fijo, vio como la pared que hace poco le había dado paso para escapar de su padrastro se cerraba, evitando asi que el capitán los encontrara. Reafirmo su agarre al pequeño bebé que era su hermanito y lo sujeto con mayor firmeza. Escucho al fauno llamándola y se apresuró a ir hasta donde él estaba. Le había dicho que era el momento para abrir el portal, solo necesitaba entregarle al bebé. Dudo por unos segundos al ver entre sus manos la daga que había obtenido del comedor del hombre pálido. Sin embargo, un recuerdo asalto su mente: las tres figuras talladas. Eran el fauno, ella, y su hermano. Ahora estaba claro. — ¿Planeaste esto? — pregunto con voz temblorosa a la par que retrocedía un paso. —No entiendo a qué se refiere, alteza… — ¡¿Cómo sabias que mi hermano estaría aquí para cumplir la ultima prueba?! — grito asustada. Vio como poco a poco el fauno disminuía su sonrisa y apretaba más el mango de la daga. El ser hizo un par de sonidos guturales, como los que soltaba al no poder articular fácilmente una palabra, antes de alzar una mano hacia el cielo y señalar la luna. —La luna ya está en lo alto del cielo, alteza. No hagáis esperar más a vuestro padre… —No. La luna se quedara ahí hasta que amanezca. Ahora, decidme la verdad. El fauno retrocedió un poco y luego le dio la espalda mientras veía a la luna. La última de sus hadas apareció de la oscuridad de aquel lugar en donde se abriría el portal; se acercó curiosa hacia su hermano y lo vio unos segundos antes de irse y empezar a volar alrededor de él. —Está bien, alteza— acepto el fauno con cierta molestia. Se acercó a ella un poco y se detuvo hasta quedar a dos metros de distancia —. Como vos sabeis, hay una historia en donde se cuenta como usted habéis escapado de su reino. Esa historia, se cuenta desde hace muchos años. Y ninguna historia se salva de…cambios. — ¿A qué te refieres? ¿Qué cambios? —La historia que hoy se conoce, no es la verdadera versión— hizo un ademan de rechazo mientras emitía algo similar a un \"Ugh\" —. La historia real dice, que la princesa…usted, salio de su reino, pero no porque quisiera conocer el mundo de los humanos. La princesa fue buscando…a su hijo— se inclinó y con la mano extendida señalo a su hermano —. Aquel que le fue robado por alguien que quería vuestro trono, y no se lo permitió. — ¿Estais-Estais diciendo que el…es mi hijo? — el fauno junto sus manos y sonrió levemente. Ella negó con la cabeza y lo miro a los ojos —. Eso es imposible. Solo soy una niña. —Tal vez aquí, pero en Bethmoora es tan adulta como vuestra inmortalidad os lo permita, alteza— aseguro dando una pequeña reverencia—. Cuando usted llego al mundo humano, el sol la cegó haciéndola olvidar todo lo que habéis vivido antes, incluyendo…el motivo por el que estabais ahí. Miro a su hermano y busco cualquier similitud entre ambos. Bajo la manta un poco para poder ver su rostro y vio algo en su hombro que no había podido notar antes: cerca del cuello, había una pequeña marca con forma de luna y otras más que pequeñas que simulaban estrellas. Recordó que la misma marca que tenía en su hombro y se quedó sin aliento. No podía ser posible. Alzo su mirada y encontró al fauno más cerca de ella mientras este la veía atentamente, como esperando a ver su reacción. Acomodo al bebé en sus brazos y se armó de valor para articular una pregunta más. —Entonces, si él es mi hijo, ¿Quién es su padre? El dejo salir una pequeña risa y se inclinó frente a ella para intentar estar un poco a su altura. —Oh, alteza. El padre de vuestro hijo es el ser más afortunado del mundo; ese que fue digno de conquistar vuestro corazón, y quien juro protegerla a usted y a su hijo, aún después del final de los tiempos. —… ¿y que paso con él? ¿También me espera como mi padre? El fauno asintió con lentitud al mismo tiempo que juntaba sus manos y las colocaba sobre su pecho. Sobre su corazón. —El los espera a ambos de regreso. Pero, antes de que ambos se casaran él os juro que haría lo que fuera para protegeros, aun cuando fuera ir hasta el fin de mundo…y de regreso. En cuanto supo que vos no ibais a regresar, fue con vuestro padre y rogo que le permitiera esperarla en uno de los portales que había abierto para vos. —Pero, creí que habías dicho que este portal era el último. El fauno asintió lentamente. Extendió una de sus manos hacia ella y mantuvo la otra en su corazón. El tomo su mano y con su pulgar le acaricio el dorso de la mano. —Solo el dolor de vuestro padre se compara al que yo sentí todos estos años que eh pasado sin vosotros a mi lado— se acercó a ella y volvió a acariciarle el rostro, ahora también pasando uno de sus dedos por la cara del niño —. No os imagináis lo mucho que los eh extrañado. Se apartó bruscamente y empezó a retroceder asustada. No. No se imaginaba a si misma casada con él, y mucho menos que su hermano menor resultara ser su hijo. Negó asustada y se detuvo para evitar quedar atrapada entre alguno de los muros. —Vamos, mi princesa. No temais. Yo solo busco que seamos la misma familia que éramos hace miles de años, antes de que todo esto ocurriera— retomo la daga y extendió su brazo hacia ella —. Entregadme a nuestro hijo. — ¿Por qué? —El portal no se abrirá si no se derrama sangre de un inocente. Solo un…pinchazo. No tiene por qué ser tanta. Solo unas gotas e iremos a casa. Sin pensarlo mucho, se abrazó a su hermano y negó rotundamente. Eso no pareció gustarle mucho al fauno, quien le grito recordándole que ella había aceptado obedecerlo. Ella se negó en cada intento del fauno por convencerla. Aunque finalmente, lo logro. —Bien. Si quereis seguir aquí y dejar todo sin mirar atrás, que se hago vuestra voluntad, alteza. Y asi, él se fue volviendo a esconderse en la oscuridad. Los segundos siguientes pasaron en un suspiro. Vidal apareció, le quito al bebé y luego le disparo al intentar recuperarlo. Cayó a un lado del portal y sintió como la vida se escapaba de su cuerpo. A su mente, llegaron recuerdos. De su padre trabajando en los trajes de los oficiales. De su madre despertándola en sus cumpleaños. Del primer cuento que leyó. Y eso hasta los recuerdos más actuales. En cierto punto, escucho su voz cantando una nana y la voz de fauno diciéndole lo hermosa que era su voz, y que cada vez que la escuchaba se enamoraba un poco más. Una lagrima se escurrió de su ojo izquierdo y se limitó a aceptar que iba a morir, sin volver a su hogar, y habiendo perdido a su familia otra vez. —De pie. Escucho de una voz profunda y cálida. Se levantó y se encontró vestida de forma hermosa, sin heridas y en un bello lugar lleno de luz. Avanzo y se encontró con tres tronos. Vio sorprendida como en el trono central, estaba su padre la veía feliz y con la mirada cristalina. —Padre. —Habéis elegido derramar vuestra sangre antes que la de un inocente. Esa era la prueba final. La más importante. Entonces, tras el trono de su padre salio el fauno, seguido de las tres hadas y con el bebé en brazos. Lo miro sorprendida y con una enorme sonrisa imposible de borrar. —Y habéis elegido bien— felicito el fauno mientras mecía con suavidad al niño —, alteza. Sin esperar más, corrió hacia el fauno y lo abrazo con cuidado de no lastimar al bebé, a su hijo. Al separarse, se vieron a los ojos y él se inclinó para que pudieran juntas sus frentes, como hacía mucho que no habían podido hacerlo. —Por fin están de regreso en casa, mi amada princesa. —Por fin estamos juntos de nuevo, mí querido fauno. Se separaron al son los aplausos que se oían de fondo, y ella tomo al bebé en brazos. Solo entonces, su ahora recordado y querido esposo la tomo de la mano y caminaron hasta el trono vacío. Debía retomar su lugar, ese que nunca debía haber dejado. Y asi, la princesa pudo volver a casa. En donde luego reino junto a su esposo y su hijo con amor y alegría. De quienes juro, nunca volver a separarse en su vida inmortal. Aún si eso significara combatir la peores alimañas mortales, o buscarlos después del fin de mundo. No importaba el lugar o la situación, los tres estarían juntos…para siempre. ","Summary":" Había terminado la primera prueba.

She had foreseen the coming of the night many times throughout her brief time on the mystic plane of her birth, often in subtle whispers throughout her dreams or in the soft reflection of her hourglass. She had felt the natural magics of her people gradually recede with the passing of time, subtle and light as sand drifted from white dunes. But she never thought the time would come, or at least not when it did. She had expected it to happen when her flesh had gnarled to a taunt, waxy sinew and when her hair had fell from her head to seed the earth. She had not expected it to happen during her maiden years when her soul, though keen and strong, had yet to fully flourish. She was an ancient to those of younger lineages, but to her race, she was barely a sapling compared to the elders of her people. She had tried to delay the inevitable, but in the end it was the northern wind that had drew the Lady from the withered alcove of her hidden grove, cast out beneath weltering blossom and rosy juniper ferns, bare to the skin save for a robe of silky thorns threaded into her delicate body. Her sense of unease and fumbling fingertips brought about a strange, near uncomfortable sight to the owls perched on the highest branches, but none could hold judgement on the young nymph after waking so early from her rest to the world she had found herself in. After all, snow had been a foreign concept for her. The small crystals of fallen ice that caught her outstretched hands were strange, cold flakes, but despite their coldness, when caught sparkling in the moonlight at just the right angle, she could not deny winter's beauty. And so she drifted over the white-crisp leaves and frosted bark of the land, surprised to find that despite the years she had slept, the world had changed little in its time, though that was the way of all things within the depths of the Underworld. In the Underworld the passing of the seasons, as of daylight and eve, were a calmer, gradual process than the world heralded above. It meant long slumbers for the native wildlife, bountiful springs for the roaming stags and doe, plenty of time for the young nymph to dream. There was little threat for her and so her rest had always gone undisturbed until sunshine had begun to blossom, and the warmth of the summer had taken root over the following years. Her wake within the midst of a snow-fallen winter was a troublesome sight for any that observed her wander, one that stirred whispers through the wind and secrets through the earth. Driven by anxiety, the Lady's wanderings led her west out of the moonlight and into the shadow of the forest, across the harsher terrains of smog to the depths of the thickest marshes. Then finally, when the land grew thick and steep, stone and steps replacing the natural wilds of the forest, had she found herself in the clearing of an ancient grove, where the Lake of Rebirth glistened in royal sapphire, rippling only the constellations reflected in its softer waters, while a thin film of silvery mist drifted ominously over the surface. The sycamores that guarded the lake's grand landscape curled over it in long, silver arches as vines of rusty amber intertwined within the cracks like muscle woven through bone, yet still allowing starlight to seep through. From the branches hung vials that seeped from their waxen stems, from the shores were caches of ornaments buried half-deep into the mud for the God of the lake to cherish, and though the pool itself lay in silent tranquility, the young nymph found her anxiety worsening despite nature's attempt to calm her nerves. Falling to her knees, the Lady dared to peer into the infinite depths of the lake. Spinning a thread of softly lit magic, she curled the length of her energy over her fingers, only to part the seal of the water and allow her essence to flow into the currents. Her fingertips tingled at the magic that parted from her. In reaction, the lake pulsed in vibrant hues of sage and shamrock. From there she waited for the water to clear and for her future to appear before her. The constellations began to dim one by one. The wind pricked along the archway, rustling the ivory lichen. The vapour on the surface flowed in a clockwise direction, rising and falling as the current of the lake rotated and lapped at the shores. And then after the lake coalesced mere strides from where she lay, the mist receded and drawn into the centre was a flash of colour, then movement. In the portal was a world the Lady had only heard tales of. Of a world far above the one she knew. She heard the distant clatter of hooves against stone, bore witness to the sharp corners of cobblestones along the ground and the great iron gates of what looked to be a city, encaging a twisted, angled building within. The mirage faded and reappeared, showing the twisted building in clearer detail, of the great oaken doors latched with black hinges; moss growing thickly within the cracks. But it was below the doors that intrigued the nymph, of the small bundle wrapped in a neatly hewn basket. It was only when the bundle writhed from the covers that she realised that the bundle was a baby. \"I heard whispers on the wind,\" had come a voice from the grove, from a shadow that dared to lurk along the border, \"flutters in the air of a lady walking down these dark paths. You should not be here alone, little one.\" \"I came because I have little choice,\" the Lady whispered, the long vines of her mane keeping her face from his viewing. \"My kind are taught that we are the guardians of the forests of the Underworld, that the lakes and seas and all in between are here simply because we have protected them for so long. But we nymphs must not be all important if some of us are this expendable.\" The shadow creaked into the light of the moon, but she did not see him enter. \"What is it that you see, little one, that disturbs you so?\" \"I see the world above our own. I see a city, thick in the ashes of the father-oaks and abundant in their walls of stone. I see a place that to the very definition is a nightmare to a child, and I see a mortal child, unknowing to the fate it will soon find itself in.\" She heard the flutter of wings and a felt a presence on her shoulder. When she dared to glance up, she spied the small frame of a fairy settling itself within her hair, burying into the confines like the most curious of magpies. Behind she heard the rickety rendering of the old faun's bark, of the twist in his bones and the stutter of his limbs. She felt the breathy pant of frosted air wisp into the night, and heard the deep, guttural croak of his voice when he prepared to speak. \"The lake is as ancient and wise as the moon, as cunning and deceitful as the mountains, and as knowledgeable and foreseeing as the wind. What you see may be lie, may be truth, but why it shows you the mortal realm is… intriguing.\" The Lady quietly shook her head. Curious, the faun carefully crouched to the young nymph's side and quietly pressed a twisted finger to her chin, tilting it up just so. \"What disturbs you, little one?\" he asked, the ancient carvings on his brow creasing over the bridge of his nose, and the mist of his eyes gleaming in concern. She lightly traced the black bristles of his jaw with her fingertips, followed the insignias of fate bound across his rind. \"Why did you come here, Pan? The Fae King will not be happy when you are to leave on the morrow for the surface.\" \"Ah, it is not the morrow I leave the Underworld, little one, but,\" he smiled crookedly, raising one finger, \"a day after. The king of Bezmorra is worried, begs for the daughter born by the moon. He has much to worry, but will not miss a lonely faun for one night.\" \"You cast your eyes away too quickly. You should be more cautious.\" The faun straightened, twitching his finger from side to side. \"Ah, you fear too much. Now, what is this talk of your people, hmm? Why do you peer into the lake? Should you not be sleeping until the summer?\" The nymph glanced away from him, casting her gaze back to the mirage playing still in the lake. \"I've known for sometime that the God of this lake had a plan for me. I used to hear stories as a nymph-ling, barely tall enough to see the lowest branches of the trees. I tell of the tales told of my kind being indebted to Him and his wishes. It was the pact we kept, the solemn vow we scarcely understood.\" She drew the edge of her robe up to her thigh and showed the elder creature the scarred lines of a constellation embedded deep into her olive skin. \"I have been chosen, Pan. And I'm not sure why, but I believe it has to do with what the lake portrays.\" For a moment the faun was silent. He lay his hand carefully over her thigh and observed the markings adjust, shifting as the reflection had been on the water, then pulled his hand away and rubbed the back of his ear. They both knew that the marking was of magical orientation, and that what powerful spell had been placed upon the poor nymph was stronger than any witch could cast. The constellation itself was the sign of Aquarius, and no beast could make it as perfect as it had been engraved onto the young nymph's skin. Still, the Lady saw the concern that befell him, at the way his mind ticked in thought. The fairies he had brought landed on either side of his thighs, staring up at their master as the final fairy left the safety of the Lady's shoulder to be by his side. Finally, he said, \"There may be a way to undo this. If I spoke to the Fae King, perhaps…\" Persephone frowned, forcing the thorns of her robe back over her knees. \"The king yearns for his daughter. A commoner will be of no thought to him.\" Pan gave a wry grin. \"You, my dear, have too little faith in me.\" \"Perhaps,\" she smiled, \"but I believe this is one trick you cannot so easily fool others into believing. The kingdom rests on the princess Moanna's return. No matter what you say to the king, I will not be helped. He will not see-\" \"Then I will make him see!\" The Lady stared helplessly at the faun when he rose to his feet and began to pace, mumbling words in a language she did not understand, in an accent she scarcely heard. It was not the tongue he used in the company of the king, it was not the language native to his mountain kin, instead it was a deeper, more ancient tongue, one spoken by the wind and echoed by the forest, one she was still to young to know. A tide rippled the lake's reflection anew, catching the nympth's gaze quite quickly. She observed the change in scene, at the way the watery image shimmered in blue and silver, spiraling with the long strands of her essence. Her fingers twitched in the water. She found that she could not feel them. Still the faun paced, arms braced behind his mane with the little fairies onlooking from the high branches. It was only when he heard the sudden shatter of the lake that he twisted round to find his young friend half-taken by it. Dashing over to her as fast as his old hooves could carry him, the faun pried the weak lady from the depths to the shore. His worried gaze swept over her paling form, the rise in her chest stilling on every third pulse and the light in her eyes disappearing in the moonlight. His hand came down to hers and it was then that he saw the power branching from her other hand, still and dangling towards the lake. His old bones creaked under the raw bite of consternation. Balancing the lady high in his lap, he scarcely whispered, \"Your essence… is dying.\" The fairies fluttered around the two of them, circling over her head and his antlers, praying to the moon to aid her. But it was not the moon that had captured her soul and twisted her destiny by its hands. It was not the forest nor the wind that dared disturb her from her slumber, but the lake and its God. Her kin belonged to Him, born from pacts of blood and trickery. And her time had come. Feeling the will in her slip away, she mustered enough strength to brush the bristles of his jaw; to comb the stray hairs of his mane behind his long, drooping ears. \"This… cannot be the end,\" she whispered shakily, a tear straying from her lashes. \"Pan… I'm afraid.\" The old faun curled himself around the young nymph, rocking quietly on his hooves. He bayed the moon to hide them from the God of the Lake, pleaded for the forest to pluck her oath from the water and free her soul from an ancient pledge she barely understood. But wishes had never been granted for the old faun, despite how he begged the heavens for a miracle. He was only in the company of his pets, and his pets, though mystical, barely held any power that could change the per-eminent mind of the benign. As he felt the Lady's body fall slack in his arms, felt the last warm breath quiver against his neck, the old faun peered down into the vast sapphire that was the lake and saw the last traces of her silver essence pass from her fingertips, into the greedy clutches of the God. She had gone from the Underworld far too quickly, was far too young to be taken. Yet as he watched the water hazily, rocking along with the tide, he saw the faint vision of the orphanage begin to dispel. Deep into the depths of his heart, he knew there was no changing what had been done. But he knew that no matter the rage he felt nor the amount that he wept, that the Gods, though finicky at times, were not completely, undeniably evil. There was a purpose to his loss, one that gave him some small comfort. She was left by the shore, soon claimed by the water. But Pan knew it would not be the last time that he saw the Lady of the Lake. For fate would have their paths cross once more… many, many centuries later. ... .. . I may have watched Pan's Labyrinth again and fell in love with the movie. I've been mulling over this idea for a while and though I may not get any readers since it is such an old movie, I still feel like writing and sharing this story. I just fell in love with the character of the Faun and the fact that the fairy kingdom has so little lore just leaves me with such unlimited creativity, it is just a setting I cannot help but indulge in.

Anyway this is the scene where she's just eaten the fruit from the table and she draws a door to get out. Except in mine she doesnt make it far. ~ Sirens I stood frozen, shallow breaths of air rising up my throat, as I watched the monster rise slowly out of his seat. The knife tumbled out of my hand and my mouth flew open to scream but no sound escaped. I watched as the leather man stood, his spindly legs bowing under his weight and I stood paralysed as he started towards me. 5 strides away his foot struck the floorboards, sending dust motes spinning in a celestial dance glinting of the firelight at the end of the room. Four steps left. The bony hands stretched out towards me, the cruel nails pointing out like vicious hooks. Three steps left. I could feel his ragged breath on my cheeks a mixture of blood and rotting flesh filling my nose. Two steps. His eyes bore into mine, there is no remorse, no pity for the small girl reflected in those glassy black pits. One. I feel my body shudder and crumple to the floor, the stagnant air filling my lungs making me gag and a small defeated noise fights its way up my throat. My eyes close tightly shut. I wait for death, wishing it swift, but the blow comes, not on my face, but on my back. The talons graze along my spine ripping the battered fabric of my dress and I feel wind rushing against my cheeks. I look down, my legs kicking, jerking, beneath me. I run. The monster staggers behind me each of his spindly steps matching three of mine. My flight whips tendrils of hair across my face and each ragged breath catches in my throat. I look back over my shoulder and his eyes find mine with such cruel conviction that I know its either my life, or his. I run. I run. I trip. I fall. My hands grazing along the ground as he lets out a cry of triumph. My legs once propelled by adrenaline made useless once more by fatigue and fear and I am reduced to a crawling my knees leaving a trail of blood on the floor. The monster gains rapidly. His spindly legs propel him forward with new vigour. My shoulder strikes a pillar and I hear a sickening crack. It no longer sits in its socket.

Pan's Labyrinth belongs to Guillermo del Toro. Ofelia hurried with her baby brother through the Labyrinth as she hurried to meet the Faun. She hoped and prayed that Vidal wouldn't find them. As she reached the center of the Labyrinth, the Faun, her mentor who told her the truth about herself. At once the Faun appeared before her and \"Hurry, Your Majesty! Give him to me! The full moon is high in the sky! We can open the portal!\" Ofelia paused at the sight of the large knife in the Faun's left hand. \"What is that in your hand?\" Ofelia asked nervously. \"The portal will only open if we offer the blood of an innocent. Just a drop of blood: a pin prick, that's all. It's the final task.\" The Faun explained. At once, Ofelia started to have second thoughts about the whole thing, becoming a princess and escaping her wicked stepfather was nice, but of it came at the expense of harming her little brother, than Ofelia decided that it was not worth it. Then the faun interrupted her thoughts with \"Hurry. You promised to obey me. Give me the boy!\" \"No! My brother stays with me!\" Ofelia replied firmly. \"You would give up your sacred rights for a brat you barely know?\" The Faun asked in a disbelieving tone. \"Yes. I would.\" Ofelia replied as she looked the Faun right in the eye, keeping her baby brother close to her chest. \"You would give up your throne for him? He who has caused you such misery, such humiliation?\" The Faun asked, still not believing what he was hearing. \"Yes. I wo….\" Ofelia started to say, but she was suddenly she was interrupted by Vidal's voice shouting \"Who are you?! Stay away from my son?!\" Ofelia spun around to see Vidal standing in the entrance to the center of the Labyrinth! Ofelia felt her heart start to race in fear as she looked at her wicked stepfather who currently had his gun pointed towards the Faun. Suddenly, the Faun pushed himself in front of the young girl and ordered \"Your highness, run.\" \"But what about you?\" Ofelia asked worriedly. \"Leave him to me and go on ahead.\" The Faun replied. Ofelia gave the Faun one last look before she ran down the steps. \"Ofelia! Ofelia get back here!\" Vidal ordered as he kept his gun on the Faun. \"You can't give commands...not any more.\" The Faun replied in a cool tone as he narrowed his eyes. \"Who are you? Are you with the rebels?\" Vidal demanded. \"I serve no one but Princess Moanna and you will never lay a hand on her again.\" The Faun stated with literal fire in his eyes. Vidal didn't know whether or not his eyes were playing tricks on him, but he did know one thing whoever this man was, he had no idea who he was messing with. Then almost as if he could read his thoughts, the Faun replied \"I am no man! I am Faun and it is you who has no idea who you're dealing with!\" Feeling spooked enough at last, Vidal fired his gun at the Faun, but to his complete and utter shock none of the bullets hit him. Vidal continued to fire until he was out of bullets. Quite possibly, it was the first time that Vidal had ever shown fear. \"That was your worst? Now let me show you mine.\" The Faun replied with a creepy smile.

Dans son moment de réflexion, elle se demandait comment en étaient-ils arrivés là. À errer dans la nature comme des chiens, à fuir à toute hâte sans jamais s'arrêter. La résistance avait peu d'aspect positif et on s'en rend compte seulement quand on y prend part, pour de vrai. Certains furent semblant et fuirent dès le premier coup de feu. Ceux-là étaient de simple lâches. En attendant, son ventre criait famine et les provisions n'étaient toujours pas là. En effet, pour s'approvisionner, la résistance s'initia à la ruse pure et simple. Un de leur homme s'était jeté en plein dans le territoire des franquistes, une demeure qui appartenait au capitaine Vidal. Tous les jeudi, il leur apportait du saucisson, du pain, du tabac et même de l'eau de vie, de quoi en rendre plus d'un heureux. Mais ce soir, rien. Marco n'est pas venu. Catalina est persuadée qu'il a perdu sa couverture, et qu'il s'est fait abattre, mais personne ne l'écoutait, comme toujours. Ils n'allaient tout de même pas rester là à attendre que la nourriture vienne toute seule ? Non, sûrement pas. Elle se leva en direction du camp, là où un feu brûlait abondemment. \"Marta , cria le chef de la résistance, éteint ce feu, on va se faire repérer avec toute cette fumée !\" Marta s'exécuta rapidement tandis que Catalina s'approcha de son grand frère. \"Francesco, il n'est toujours pas revenu.\" \"Il a sans doute eu un empêchement.\" \"Non, ce n'est pas un simple empêchement comme tu dis.\" \"Qu'est-ce que tu en sais, hein ? Arrêtes de te faire du soucis.\" \"Francesco, on pourrait au moins allez voir si tout va bien !\" \"Non, Catalina, la règle, tu te rappelles de la règle ?\" \"On ne va à la rencontre de l'ennemi qu'en cas d'extrême nécessité.\" \"Sì, et elle est autant applicable par les autres que par toi.\" \"Et nous allons mourir de faim pendant combien de temps ?\" \"Je ne sais pas, mais ne t'avises pas de t'approcher de ce malade de Vidal, c'est compris ? Il est prêt à tout pour accomplir son devoir, même au pire.\" Il se retira sans même laisser le temps à sa sœur de répondre. Catalina savait de quoi le capitaine était capable, c'était un homme d'autorité, doté d'une vision très sadique. Elle n'en savait pas plus sur lui, mais pour elle, elle en savait déjà trop. Après une longue réflexion, Catalina établit un plan pour s'infiltrer dans le camp ennemi. Elle attendit calmement la nuit, que ses compagnons se soient endormis pour s'exécuter. Elle marcha pendant de quelques minutes à travers les arbres reflétant des ombres et se retrouva rapidement près de son objectif. Encore cachée dans la forêt, et calcule son plan à l'aide de la scène qui se trouve devant elle: quatre soldats entourent le périmètre. Ça n'allait pas être chose facile de s'infiltrer. Soudain, elle entendit vaguement un des gardes s'approcher dangereusement vers elle. Il ne fallait pas qu'elle panique. Elle recula doucement pour éviter qu'il ne la voit. Le garde entra tranquillement dans la forêt et s'arrêta brusquement. De dos à Catalina, il commença à ouvrir sa braguette quand elle lui sauta dessus tout en l'assommant brutalement à coup de pierre.

Antonio no se percató de ello, estaba demasiado ocupado arreglando las tumbas. Estaban llenas de porquería, tuvo que frotar bien con un trapo húmedo que Pablo tenía en el maletero del coche, aunque lo malo era que usaba ese trapo para sus labores mecánicas, así que terminó dejando restregones de grasa. Se empleó a fondo para limpiarlo todo bien y adecentarlas, aunque no se le diera tan bien como a Mercedes. Ella sí que tenía idea de limpiar, siempre dejaba las lápidas brillantes y hermosas, y les dejaba unas flores preciosas. Pero, claro, Mercedes no podía ir allí tan a menudo como quisiera, y estaban en medio del campo, así que siempre que volvía se las encontraba desastradas. En fin, él hacía lo que podía. No tenía ningún ramo para dejarles. Aquella parada no había sido prevista: al ver en el mapa que pasarían cerca, había pedido a Pedro que pararan un momento para hacerles una visita. Lo bueno era que, al estar en aquel bosque, la hierba se encargaba de hacer que brotaran a su alrededor florecillas silvestres, así que tenían una ofrenda bonita sin tener que gastarse dinero ni arrancar ninguna pobre flor. Y él había rezado por ellas dos desde que tuvo el don de la palabra; habiendo oraciones, no hacía falta más ofrendas. Eso era lo que Mercedes siempre le había dicho. Rezó en silencio frente a las tumbas de su hermana y su madre, pero pronto su mente se desvió hacia las vacaciones que acababan de empezar. En los amigos que les esperaban en Valencia, en los días enteros que pasaría en la playa, los saraos. No tendría ocasión de aburrirse. Tras despedirse brevemente de su familia, a la que sentía no recordar, se levantó. Se giró a tiempo de ver a Pedro volver junto a él con las manos en los bolsillo. - Bonito laberinto el que teníais, ¿eh? - ¿Laberinto?-preguntó Antonio, justo cuando abrió la boca para anunciar que ya podían irse. - Sí, ¿no lo has visto nunca? Está justo ahí. Hecho una pena pero debe de tener un montón de años. Antonio nunca había visto nada parecido en todas las veces que había visitado la casa debido a que nunca había osado separarse de Mercedes para explorar, y se sintió invadido por la curiosidad. Dio unos cuantos pasos en la dirección que Pedro había señalado y vio que, en efecto, ahí estaba. Lo cierto es que se sorprendió de que Mercedes no le hubiera hablado de ello, lo encontró de lo más interesante: por el moho que cubría aquella piedra tan afeada y los bloques que se habían desmoronado, aquello debía de tener muchos siglos. Pero lo primero en lo que se fijó fue en aquella horrenda cara que coronaba el arco de la entrada. Después de dudar un poco, entró. No se atrevió a adentrarse demasiado, pero sí lo suficiente como para echarle un buen vistazo. ¡Qué buen lugar para jugar! Si su hermana hubiera vivido lo suficiente para jugar con él, se lo habrían pasado de miedo en ese sitio. Seguramente a sus padres no les hubiera hecho gracia, pero era un lugar demasiado tentador como para ignorarlo. Él ya era adulto y se veía explorando el laberinto, aunque no fuera más que un puñado de piedras mohosas. Y en ese enclave...¿Quién lo habría construido? Recordó aquel mito que les enseñó ese maestro que tenía que parecía un mono, el del Minotauro. Desde luego, aquel lugar era perfecto para encontrarse monstruos. Se lo comentaría a una amiga suya que hacía películas, Sandra. Podría usar aquel sitio como escenario para uno de sus cortos. Entonces, se quedó clavado en su sitio. En una esquina, frente a él, algo se había movido. Era algo muy alto, le pareció distinguir un cuerno como de carnero. No. No podía ser. Seguro que era su imaginación. Pero no osó adentrarse más, aunque su mente le pidiera que continuara, para ver qué era. — ¡Toño! ¡Que vamos a pillar atasco! Antonio sacudió la cabeza. Claro, una cosa era visitar la tumba de la familia y otra hacer el tonto en un laberinto, así que se dio la vuelta y volvió a la entrada, donde Pedro lo esperaba. — Es muy grande—le dijo. — Ya, pero no deja de ser una ruina. Se te podría haber caído un pedrolo a la crisma y entonces ¿qué? ¿Eh? ¿Qué hago contigo, si estamos en medio de la nada? — Perdona. ¿Nos vamos? — Sí, vámonos. Con un poco de suerte, no habrá mucho tráfico. Ambos hombres echaron a caminar. Antonio volvió la cabeza por última vez hacia la entrada del laberinto, pero su amigo lo distrajo. — Lo siento, chaval, pero no tienes ninguna posibilidad con Sarita. — Que te crees tú eso. Ella está loquita por mí. Tendrías que haber visto cómo me miraba en el cumpleaños de Pablo. — Sí, por esa barba de abuelete. Pero ella me lo ha dicho. — ¡Ja! ¡Y yo que me lo creo! A ver, quiero pruebas. — Me lo dijo, ¿cómo quieres que te lo demuestre? Mira, cuando lleguemos se lo preguntas. Te dirá que no, porque es muy tímida y no quiere que se sepa, pero ya verás como sí. — Tú lo que tienes es mucho cuento. Mientras los dos se alejaban, una figura se asomó y, finalmente, volvió a esconderse tras aquellos muros de piedra. En el laberinto de nuevo solamente se oyó el eco del trinar de los pájaros del monte.

Disclaimer: Don't own it, never will. Moanna had returned, and he with her, back to the home of ancient souls. Here in the world beneath, where the withered Faun stood silently among the immortals in their lofty palaces of gold and red and green, back to watch over his Princess and grow young again. She granted her father affection, her Faun curiosity. She returned to her play and her studies, choosing only the things she wished to learn, dismissing the rest into oblivion like the child she was. Her mind was quick and grew steadily, impatient to overtake her soul…her old soul that she did not - could not - know was waiting for her. It would be a long time before she found it and held it. It had been there, barely visible, when she stepped into a labyrinth to follow a fairy. She had seen it when the pale one chased her through the long stone coffin of his lair. It had flamed brightly when she accepted death in her brother's place. And now it was hidden where she could not find it. Already, she was forgetting them all. The mortals slid from her memory like smoke, and everything of pain and joy from the world above settled into the bottom of her chest like a heavy cloud of ashes. And she forgot this, too. One day, she held a doll close to her and looked into its eyes. \"Faun, I am old, am I not?\" Her voice was raw, flushed with her own magic and drunk on the joy of possibility. The Faun felt something else beneath her statement. He reached out and grasped her thoughts with his seeping, sifting intelligence. He placed his mind flush against her immortal heart, listening to the beats, counting them and measuring their worth. Already they were familiar. They had been familiar thousands of years before this. But still, he listened, and he heard it anew…a fluttering steady pulse against her ribs…a bridled river creeping through the dust. Her love. He drew back his mind and watched her. In earnest, the child sat with the doll in her hand, and her eyes were dark. He said aloud. \"You will not be old for many years, My Princess.\" You are old already. As she had been eons ago, before she was a child. As she would be eons from now, after she was a child once more. Restlessness was already evident in the lines of her face, and it was only a matter of waiting…for centuries, for millennia. It hardly mattered. She would slip back into the blazing mortal world. Into time. Now, at this moment of beginning, she fought it, a broiling battle in her little heart. She was born to war and never grew. She spoke again. \"Can fauns love, Faun?\" Her lips were cold and pink, her skin the color of light honey. The Faun's face twisted like old wood into a wild, cruel smile. But not a harsh one. Cruel, but never harsh with her. \"Fauns cannot love, Princess.\" Always gentle cruelty. \"Why not?\" So innocent. She held no pity for him, only curiosity. \"You, yourself, do not love, My Princess.\" Not in the way that you think you do. Cruelty, cruelty. The air hummed with it. But she grasped what he said and turned it over gently in her heart, testing it. And she put it on herself like a new cloak, this observation of his. And she grew older still. The Faun stood, her unmovable sentinel guarding her child's play. Soon, soon. Soon they would be separate once more, and he would be the Watcher in the frozen lands. But now, only the gentle cruelty of her Guardian, and a cloak of cold curiosity that would carry her up into the land of men. Death again. The Faun waited. She stood tall and proud, grown to womanhood, and gave him a furtive, sorrowful kiss…and he knew that she was leaving. He stayed near her after that, and, as was his task, guided her away from the gates into the land of men. Away from enchantments. Away from strange princes. Away from any that would aid her and in so doing harm her. She cursed his cruelty, and he saw her cold cloak billow around her heart, and frame her face in its desperate shadows. Her patience was great for one so young, and she waited years before evading him and running up the steps into darkness. Her patience was rewarded with her destruction. It was finished, for a moment, for a breath. But her soul was there, and the Watcher would find it. High in a marble chamber, the king her father showed him the future. Like a spirit from the high places, the Faun looked down across the mortal lands. The sky was drained of its bright blue nectar, and the earth shuddered as the thunder of war machines ripped across it and tore its mountains down. The black soot of uncountable fires filled the winds. Unnatural lightning floated above the great cities of man…cities that would someday be built, but were not yet. Cities that had been cities, for they were crumbled to ashen shells. \"There,\" said the king, \"will she be.\" So the Faun ascended once again to the cold earth, and the fairies settled in the crook of his arms, and they waited for her. The earth shivered. Faint screams reached him, but never roused him. In his mind he saw her as she was and would be and must be. He saw her cold cloak that he had planted and her loving heart buried beneath it. War would come and she would be born, an innocent, warm as ever a mortal could be.… He awoke to their broken voices around him. They passed by in shuffling procession through the damp tunnels into the belly of the earth. In his chamber, he waited, and when they were gone, he broke down the ancient walls surrounding him and followed them. The beams from their lights sifted the air like fairy dust. She was here. Alive. He found her, alone, too weak to stay with the others. A twisted child, born of the smoke from mortal destruction. Born of war. Tumors marred her honey skin. Her head was bald. Her voice was gone, reduced to a rasp. The eyes were still dark. The soul was the same. Old and innocent. Eternal. Who are you? She forced the words through her rasped throat. I am a Faun. He knelt down beside her and placed a fibrous palm on her fevered forehead. And you are a Princess. A Princess? Yes. And your father misses you.

She ran up those stone steps, despite my plea. She promised to return. The sun burned her memory away, coldness consumed her body over time, the darkness she once loved, became her enemy, and illness pledged her. She died. My queen was died, and I was bond to this earth, alone, to await Queen Julia for as long as it took… -x-x-x- \"Halleluiah, praise the lord, amen!\" I screamed while jumping up from my seat behind the desk. The teacher looked at me crossly, with ruler in hand, while I scratched the back of my neck. \"Err; I guess I'm not in church…\" \"Miss Mockie, you we sleeping in class, again!\" She snapped at me while slamming the ruler down on my desk once again. I smiled broadly as I continued to scratch my neck. \"Oops,\" I replied stupidly. \"I guess I did…\" \"Honestly,\" She pinched her nose in annoyance as I heard the class try to stifle their laughs. \"Can you at least tell me three things about Pan,\" I gave her a confused look and she pointed to the poster taped on the board. \"The Greek God of…\" \"Goats?\" I guessed, making the class start laughing. The teacher turned a glare at them to shut them up. \"No,\" \"I was just messing with ya,\" I said jokily. \"He's the God of wild, shepherds and flocks, nature of mountain wilds, hunting and rustic music, as well as the companion of the nymphs-\" \"I like his guy already!\" Randy, my brother figure, screamed while jumping up, causing the teacher to glare at him until he sat down. \"Maybe you're not hopeless after all, Joanna.\" The teacher muttered just as the bell rang. \"Class dismissed!\" I picked up my backpack and stuffed my notebook inside. I rushed out the room and to my locker, where Randy was already waiting for me. His icy blue eyes looked at me as smiled and ran his hand through his messy black hair. \"Yo, Jo-Jo!\" Randy called playfully, making me roll my eyes. \"I told you never to call me that!\" I snapped while he wrapped an arm around my shoulder. We walked towards the front entrance. I said goodbye to Randy and headed for my shortcut through the forest, where I could have some peace. I walked though the deep forest, not afraid to take any detours. Not like I have anybody at home waiting on me. I stopped abruptly when a small person flew pass my face. Wait, a small person ? I whipped around wildly to see her standing on a branch, waving her hands, urging me to follow her. \"I have nothing better to,\" I mumbled while fallowing the small… Fairy, I guess. She led me through all kinds of twist and turns, like some labyrinth or something. Soon we came upon a large hole; it looked as if it were overrun with vines. She flew down the hole and I followed behind. \"Hello?\" I called looking around the damp chamber. \"Yo, anyone home?\" I heard a creaking noise from somewhere in the strange chamber, and what happened next is what changed my life forever. \"Ah, is it truly my queen?\" A raspy voice spoke. I looked behind me to see this… thing? I blinked at him, despite the fact he looked like a tree, human, goat, hybrid, I felt no fear. \"It is! Finally my queen Julia has returned!\" \"Wait my name-\" \"Your kingdom will rejoice once you return!\" He smiled at me. He took note of my confused and shocked face. \"Please don't be scared, my queen,\" He opened a case he had slung over his shoulder, two more fairies flew out and they started to fly around me. I heard him walk to me, kinda hard not to do with the fact his body creaked every time he moved. Maybe he was getting old, or maybe he hadn't moved in awhile. \"My dear queen Julia,\" He smiled again, this time caressing my cheek with boney, twig like, fingers. \"My name is Joanna,\" I stated while staring at his bright eyes. \"Joanna Mockie, not Julia-\" \"Oh that just the name the humans gave you,\" He informed with a wave of his hand as if he didn't really like \"humans\". \"Of course you'll have to complete three tasks to make sure you are not mortal.\" I stayed quiet as he pulled out a book and a small felt bag, and handed them to me eagerly. \"The book of crossroads, open it when you're alone and it will show you the first task.\" He was about to step into the shadows when I finally spoke up. \"Wait, what's your name?\" I stepped closer to him. He must've found this question amusing, as he started chuckling. \"I've so many names… so old now, that only the wind and trees can pronounce,\" I watched him disappear into the shadows. \"But you can call me Faun, my highness.\" And he was gone. As I walked through the forest, looking for my path to my home, I couldn't help but mutter under my breath… \"No more Red Bull for me.\" -x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x-x- You know the deal, review, don't flame, constructive criticism wanted. More of a set up for sequel, I also would like to thank Wikipedia for the info on Pan.

It was everything I could have ever wished for or imagined. It was the way the stars were perfectly painted across the sky, peaceful, calm and cooling, until at halfway point it met the sunset, powerful, warm and wonderful. In front of me was this big clear ocean that only I could set foot on. I could walk across to the end of my ocean if I chose to and I wouldn't drown. And if I decided to go under the waves, I would have over a million dolphins, a crystal white palace, mermaids and all sorts. I'd rise above the surface again and there would be a white beach stretching for endless miles, perfect in the middle of the moon, the stars, and the sun. I could do anything I wanted to, I was free inside this planet of myself. I was alone but I didn't mind it. I would just have to reach up to the sky and feel the warmth of the sun on my hands and face, or feel the cold peaceful touch of the stars. To sit down and hold the snow white sand in my hands was such a feeling, the feeling of it being there and disappearing from me to where it belonged underneath my feet. I travelled along that beach every day. I lay down and I could feel the grass, long and short, cradling me, shading my face from the yellow warmth in the sky. I played with the dandelions and flowers surrounding me, and spoke to them about my dreams and my thoughts as though they were real people that could listen to me. I danced on top of the mountains, and it started pouring of rain, an umbrella fell from the clouds and sheltered me. But I didn't mind, the rain drops were so pure and calming. I lay down on the grass and laughed to myself, rolling around playfully in the ocean that fell from the sky. I stared out over the mountains and I could feel myself falling away from the breeze, it was pulling at my hair, tugging at my dress, weaving in and out through my fingers. It was taking me away, my imagination was falling away. A large ocean that I had hoped would be full of many beautiful creatures were below my feet. I swooped down like a bird from the mountains, and fell in to the ocean. The waves carried me away to yet another world. The night sky was so beautiful, it's like how I had always wanted it to be, the silver stars were painted against the black, purple and blue sky. It was as though I was in a dream when the girl sitting directly under the moonlight on a rock appeared to me. She was so beautiful, her hair was an emerald green color and her smile was so airy and bright. She had a long black and silver tail, and she had a swirl of sea shells and star fish embedded in her hair. She gracefully swam over to me and took my hand. I'd never saw anything so perfect before, there I was under waves with a mermaid. I didn't know who she was, but she took me to her world. A world not like mine, but under the ground, the waves, away from the stars, the moon and the sun. The ocean filled my lungs and I could still breathe, she took me deeper and deeper, until I was completely surrounded by all these colors and startling beams. I saw faces, watching me, some came close, and others didn't. I watched the way she moved, I felt her green seaweed like hair brush against my face. I smiled. I looked around me once more, the world above was no longer in my vision, and all I could see was this brand new underwater world full of neon lights and a palace made of crystal and glass. One moment that was so strange was a shark, a shark swam over to me until it's nose almost touched mine, the only thought that ran through my head was – '' I didn't imagine this, I didn't want sharks in my world.. This isn't safe.. .'' The mermaid still hand in mine looked at me, smiled and nodded, she took my other hand and reached out to touch the shark. I saw something in that sharks eyes, something so dangerous yet so peaceful and it swam away. A flush of relief entered me, and I thought to myself again, '' I didn't imagine that shark because this is HER world, she is a real person like me, she creates her world and imagines what she wants to be there. She knew I was the same as her, that's why she brought me here, because she couldn't speak, so she showed me .'' I could no longer breathe now that the green haired mermaid took her hand away from mine, it looked as though she was getting further and further away from me, until the point I could no longer see her, the shark, the neon lights, the glass palace or the unfamiliar faces surrounding me. Her world was just as pure as mine above. I returned, and lay on the sand, hoping I would see her mysterious face again. This is my world and I am the creator. To live every day and every night in a world where everything that you wanted, everything that you imagined, had now came to life, is something so magnificent and freeing.

Until then, here's a humorous story about the Pale Man and Ofelia/Moanna. By the way, try to imagine Doug Jones' [he played the Pale Man] voice when the Pale Man is speaking. Enjoy! Also, just as a warning: possibly crappy story is possibly crappy. I wrote this in half an hour, so... Princess Moanna had finally returned to her parents, the rulers of the underworld. They were overjoyed to see their daughter again, and requested that she tell them about how she returned to them. The princess told her parents of how she had come back to them, from when she had first met the faun, to the tall, strange monster that had almost eaten her when she went to retrieve the ornate dagger, to her death at the hands of her step-father. The king frowned. \"A tall, strange monster that had tried to eat you, you say,\" he muttered. Moanna nodded. \"That's right,\" she said. \"Did he have eyes in his hands?\" She nodded again. The king paused to think. \"That monster you saw is called the Pale Man. He is one of my servants used in the tasks for the mortal girl suspected to be my reincarnated daughter.\" he explained to her. \"His task was to devour anyone who was not actually the reincarnation. The Pale Man could tell it was the wrong person by sensing if they did not match the aura of me and your mother.\" The princess cocked her head to the side, slightly confused. \"He didn't attack me for that,\" she said. \"He attacked me because I ate the food on the table.\" The king was just as confused. \"That's odd,\" he said. \"I need to ask the Pale Man. He needs to explain what happened.\" He ordered the faun go out and retrieve the Pale Man from where he had been placed thousands of years before. When the Pale Man and the faun returned, Moanna stepped back a few steps, frightened by seeing the monster that had almost eaten her. He made the same ungodly noise as he had when they had last met. It turned into a cough. \"Could someone give me a glass of water?\" the monster asked. \"My throat is really dry.\" \"Y-You can talk,\" Moanna muttered. \"Of course I can,\" replied the Pale Man. \"Why would you think I couldn't, princess?\" The princess made a few steps toward the monster. \"Well, when I saw you in that room with the food and dagger, you only made that creepy-\" The monster cut her off. \"Wait, when was that?\" the Pale Man asked. \"I don't remember seeing you, princess.\" \"You don't remember? I ate two grapes off your table, you woke up, killed two of the fairies I was with, and then tried to eat me.\" she reminded him. The Pale Man did not answer immediately. He slowly said, \"Oh, you were that little girl. Well, jeez, I almost ate the princess.\" He laughed. \"Boy would that have been stupid, huh?\" His laughs grew louder. Moanna stared at the monster. \"I have another question, Pale Man.\" the princess told him, pulling his attention back to her. \"Go ahead, princess.\" the monster said, still chuckling a bit. \"Why did you attack me when I ate that food on the table? Father told me that you only attacked people because their auras didn't match the king and queen's.\" The Pale Man stopped to think. \"Oh! I remember! See, after the king assigned me to one of the tasks to find his daughter after she'd been reincarnated, I didn't think it'd take that long. I was really excited to see you again so I made a nice feast for you and me when you would arrive. While I waited, I must've fallen asleep. I was having this weird nightmare, so I woke up. That happened to be the time you had eaten two of my grapes.\" \"But, the faun said not to eat any of the food. Why did he do that?\" Moanna asked. The Pale Man replied, \"Oh, that? I seem the recall that he had visited me after a while to see how I was doing, and he saw all that food. He asked if he could have some and I said 'Get your own dang food'. Maybe he thought it was for me only and thought if you tried to eat my food, you'd get in trouble. That wasn't the case, as I explained earlier. \"Now I'm going to continue on with what happened when I woke up from my weird nightmare. I heard some noises so I put in my eyes to see who it was. My eyesight was kind of fuzzy because I'd been alseep so long, so I couldn't make out who it was. Your fairies started distracting me, and that's when I realized I was really hungry, so I ate them as a quick snack. I was trying to catch up with you to see who you were but you kept running and my walking was a little screwy because I was so brittle from not eating and because I hadn't moved in a lot of years.\" he explained. \"What about that strange sound you were making?\" she asked. \"Oh, that. See, my throat was incredibly dry for not drinking for a long time, so that's the most intelligible sound I could make. I was trying to tell you to stop but it didn't come out right.\" the Pale Man replied. Moanna sighed. \"And I suppose you have a reason for having those drawings of you eating children on the ceiling?\" The monster nodded. \"While I was waiting, I was really bored so I drew some pictures.\" he said. \"I think I'm a pretty good artist.\" The king smiled. \"See, dear? There's an explanation for everything.\" Moanna did not answer. She did not agree with her father, nor did she say anything to the Pale Man. All she did was facepalm. A/N: THE END. This is so ridiculous. It makes sense, though, how the Pale Man is actually nice because I can't take him seriously at the result of the interview with Doug Jones [is he related to Alfred F. Jones? Hats off to you if you get the reference.] while he was in the Pale Man costume. Thanks for reading, everyone!

Like the rest of the world she now inhabited, it held its own glow. Here, they did not need sunlight. She was still adjusting to a world without war, where people lived forever, where no-one ever got sick, where believing in faeries was a sign of sanity. She loved this kingdom. Her kingdom. Life was not worry-free, she had responsibilities. Lessons in history, magic, geography and medicine. Because one-day her father would rest and she would rule her people. As her father so often told her, she had long ago mastered kindness, but a ruler was also just, and needed the wisdom to choose between the two. The princess didn't fight her lessons, like she had once fought the Captain's dictatorship over her life. She enjoyed them. Like all things in the underworld, they passed with the ease and sweetness of honey. What time she had outside of lessons was spent strolling through the gardens. The green of the leaves ranged from pastel to emerald, the flowers that graced almost every surface were vibrantly coloured, crimson to aqua. Every day they were different, and she treasured every one of them. At night, the smells would fill her room through open windows, though the garden was several hundred feet below, and the aromas of jasmine and roses, which would have fought for dominance in the world above, mixed and made every breath of air sweet. With the fragrances of so many flowers invading her room, as her mother was laying her to sleep, she asked the question. \"Mamma,\" she began, no longer afraid of being inquisitive as she had been in the world above, \"who's is the room next to mine.\" Her mother smiled gently at her, silver locks framing her face as her as it shone. \"'To whom does the room next to mine belong.'\" She corrected, before answering her daughter's question. \"It is your sister's room.\" She sat back, awaiting the flood of questions that would follow. \"Where is she?\" Ofelia, still sore at being deprived of the chance to know her brother, wished to know all she could of her sister. \"She is in the world above, where she belongs.\" Seeing her daughter preparing more questions in her mind, she decided to explain it all herself. \"You sister is your twin, and your opposite.\" She raised a hand to tuck a lock of dark hair behind Ofelia's ear. \"Her hair is blonde to the point that it is blinding. Her skin tan from spending her life in the sun. You were born by the moon, your sister by the sun.\" She caressed the pale skin of her daughter's cheek, which Ofelia had long ago learnt would not darken despite hours outside. \"Why is she there? Did she run away like me?\" Ofelia pictured it in her mind's eye, the two of them distracting their guardians and running for the labyrinth. \"She belongs in the world above. You followed her there when she left.\" She gave another soft smile, but this one was sad, speaking of the many years she had lost her daughter. \"Your sister is who she is. This world does not need sunlight, it has its own gentle glow. It has the moon.\" She looked to her daughter, willing her to understand. \"It has you.\" \"And my sister?\" \"The world above idoes/i need sunlight. Sunlight is strong, if not taken seriously, it burns. It is harsh and cruel, and your sister can be harsh and cruel. But she brings life to that world. If there were no world above, then we would not be a world below.\" Ofelia sat for a while, thinking of all her mother had said, sorting it into the complex dynamics of a world she was just now coming to understand. Her mother patiently sat with her. And with the passage of time so different in a world without the sun or stars to call attention to the beginning of day and night, they sat together silently for ages, and barely any time at all. \"Will I ever see her again?\" Ofelia queried. She recalled fleeting glimpses of the girl her mother had described in her memory, but she wished for so much more. Her mother turned away from her, going through the rest of their routine for the night: closing the window, blowing out candles, tucking her into bed. As s left the room, she paused at the door and looked at Ofelia curled up in her bed. \"Do you ever see the sun and the moon together?\" She asked, before leaving the room without an answer. Ofelia looked up at her ceiling, and smiled at beautiful scene painted there. Two little girls, so different, so similar, laughed together in the twilight. With the moon and the sun watching over them.

I do adore the movie; in any case, it's a one-shot with absolutely no point. I feel a little silly writing an English fanfic based on a Spanish movie, but here I am, not caring enough to not write it. ;) Just fluff. Takes place sometime after Pan and Ofelia met (obviously) and before her mother has complications with the baby. Short and sweet. Most Humble Servant Ofelia lay next to her mother on her bed. Carmen's shirt was pulled up and bunched below her full breasts, aching from the baby. The skin of her belly was stretched taut and trembling with the child's movements. A tiny foot bubbled the skin below the bellybutton, and Ofelia traced its movements with her fingertips. \"Does it hurt?\" she asked softly. Carmen smiled and shrugged. \"Sometimes it's uncomfortable. You don't worry your pretty head, darling,\" she said, stroking Ofelia's hair. Ofelia smiled and pressed her palm against the warm belly. The baby again kicked up against her hand. Her eyes lit up and she looked at Carmen. \"Mama! He kicked me!\" Carmen laughed. \"He's quite a busy baby,\" she mused. They lay like that for some time, until Carmen started drifting off. She smoothed her hands over her belly and sighed. \"Time for bed, Ofelia. Go to your room,\" she murmured, kissing her daughter's forehead. Ofelia complied and closed the door quietly behind her, making her way through the dark. She glowed like a spectre, her skin oddly pale in the darkness of the hallway. Pan sensed her coming, and he waited in the shadows. Ofelia slipped out of her clothes, not noticing the faun's presence. He shied away from her nakedness, casting his gaze to the floor. She put on a nightgown and crawled sleepily underneath the blankets. She lay on her side, back to Pan, and let her eyes close. Before Ofelia fell asleep, she heard a distinct rustling sound and opened her eyes. She could make out the shapes of three fairies flitting through the air, their tough wings brushing against each other as they flew. They landed on her, tiny feet tickling her cheek and hair, her shoulder. She smiled and sat up gently, as not to hurt or frighten the fae, and turned to find Pan. He emerged from the shadows, grinning. His teeth glistened and his body cracked as he moved, the gnarls and whorls of wood ever-shifting. Ofelia clapped her hands together and scooted over to make room. \"Faun!\" A broad grin spread over his face as he took a seat next to her. The fae swirled around them, giggling like the tinkling of bells. Her eyes were lit up and her smile infectious. Pan reached over to stroke her hair, his rough thumb grazing her cheek. She leaned into the gesture and rested against him. \"How is my Princess?\" he asked. She closed her eyes as she felt his ancient voice rumble up through his chest. \"Tired... but happy that you're here. I felt the baby today.\" Pan looked down on the top of her head and continued to touch her hair. He took care not to scratch her or handle her too roughly. \"How is the baby?\" he askd. Ofelia's smile stretched further. \"He's a busy baby,\" she replied, echoing her mother's earlier response. Pan could feel the warmth radiating through her body. He listened to her pulse, the way it subtlely vibrated her skin and the air around it. He wished she could sense how it turned the air into music and heated his soul through and through. \"I want to have children someday,\" Ofelia murmured wistfully. Pan ran his fingertips down her arm. Her skin tightened and turned to gooseflesh, her body tightening up for a moment before relaxing. He felt a strange mixture of emotions inside of him. Ofelia was still a child; but her statement made him wonder. Could he someday give her what she wished for? He could read her skin and eyes and body like a book, he could see in his mind's eye the beautiful woman she would blossom into. He knew she was wise beyond her years, for her soul was so old. He knew Ofelia, even if she couldn't remember. At least, he knew Moanna . \"Princess,\" he whispered, too low for human ears to listen. But still he felt Ofelia tense up again. \"Faun?\" she asked, looking up at him. \"Did you hear something?\" He looked down at her, her beautiful young face. His heart seemed to burst into flames inside of him; it was certain to him that he loved her beyond words. He would do absolutely anything for her. \"Not a thing, lovely girl.

Tú eres la princesa. No necesitas alguien más.\" \"No... ¿Porque?\" El fauno dijo nada. Era un momento de silencio, y entonces el fauno respondía. \"No eres la primera.\" Ofelia esperó. Su padre continuaba sin decir nada, lo mismo con las hadas. El resto del mundo se quedaba quieto; Ofelia estaba solo con el fauno. \"¿La primera?\" \"Tú eres la princesa, si, pero lo no eres solo. Cada mujer en tu familia tiene una pieza del alma de la princesa en su corazón. La familia real. Con cada he intentado, y con cada he fallado. Mientras tu familia tiene su sangre real, yo tenía mi maldición real...\" Ofelia estaba helada. \"¿Maldición?\" \"Cuando has salado del inframundo para explorar el mundo mortal, muchas personas muy malas estaban muy felices. Personas como el Hombre Pálido. Ellos no querían que tú no regresas nunca más. Ellos son la razón porque el sol estaba radiante, porque tú has olvidado tus memorias, porque tú has muerto. Ellos te han dado su destino, y también ellos me han dado esta maldición: que la princesa no pueda volver a su mundo. \"Pero me hecho.\" \"Si, si, has hecho,\" el fauno dijo. \"Y no se porque. Pero estas aquí, ¿no? Tal vez la razón es tu corazón. La guerra civil, estaba un sitio espantoso. Vivías en dolor. Para algunas personas, ellos se ponen duros y malos, con este dolor. Pero tú... tú has encontrado la felicidad y la paz, donde no hay nada. Con tu hermano pequeño, con Mercedes, mismo con tu madre. Tienes este poder, y este poder es porque tú has vencido la maldición, porque tú puedes volver.\" \"Pero mi madre-\" \"Se ha muerto como todos los humanos.\" \"Quiero estar con ella.\" La voz de Ofelia estaba desafiante. \"Pero ella no puede venir aquí,\" el fauno repetía. \"¿Quieres salir tu mundo, perder tu corona y tu alma autentica? ¿Porque?\" \"Lo has dicho,\" Ofelia dijo, \"He encontrado la felicidad y la paz, donde no hay nada. Incluso con mi madre. ¿Como puede estar feliz sin ella?\" \"Pero tú tienes tu padre.\" \"No lo conozco. Conozco mi madre, ¡y lo quiero! ¿Como puedo feliz con un hombre extraño? ¿Y contigo? Has querido que sacrifico mi hermano. ¿Vas a darme la felicidad con mi madre?\" ¡Vale! ¡Sal! Elige tu felicidad inmediata en vez de la finalización eterna de tu destino. ¡Pero no puedes nunca regresar!\" El fauno desapareció. Todo desapareció. Estaba muerta, como un humano, no más la princesa del inframundo. ¿Estaba su madre con ella, en esta oscuridad? No supo. Tal vez estaba solo, sin madre, sin fauno o padre. Estaba un sitio sin feliz o paz. Sin esperanza. Pero entonces, recordó eso que el fauno dijo. Porque ella estaba diferente. No puede tener miedo cuando es muerte, luego Ofelia no tenia miedo, que estaba solo. De todas formas, en esto sitio donde hay nada, Ofelia ya encontró la esperanza. Ella continua a encontrar su madre, y con ella, la feliz y la paz. Todo va a estar bien. De nuevo, estaba la elección correcta. ","Summary":" AN: Esta historia es la tarea para mi clase de español.

She was being guided by a compass that belonged to her father. She came across Pan's Labyrinth and walked through the path coming up to a small area that had a small cement circle in the centre. She went home and returned with a music box the next day. She danced in the area until the music stopped. She could hear it play again but from somewhere else. She began to follow the music until she reached a set of stairs. She climbed down the stairs as the music stopped finding the music box by an old statue. She then met the Faun. He explained to her how he believed that she was to be a princess. He wound the music box and told her about the different tasks she would have to face in order to prove that she was indeed of royal blood. He handed her a key and told her that she would have to face her first task of courage and obedience. She grabbed the key as the Faun drew a door on the wall. He explained that she had a limited amount of time before the door closes. He opened it and turned the sand. She jumped into the lair of the Pale Man as the Faun's fairies followed. She ran through the hallway and came into the dining room. She sees the Pale Man and tries to talk to him. When there is no response, she slowly walks up to him and waves her hand in front of his face. When there was no movement she saw the fairies over by the locked cabinets. She opened the middle one as the fairies had told her and found an old music box. As she was walking out she saw some strawberries. After being warned not to take any food she realized she was hungry. The fairies tried pulling her away from the table but she didn't listen. She stood in front of the plate of strawberries as the fairies continued to pull her away. However, she gave into the temptation and swats the fairies away. She grabbed a strawberry and ate it. She then grabbed a grape and more food off of the table. The Pale Man awakens but has no eyes. He uses his sense of smell and hearing to guide him towards the Dancer. The fairies finally are able to gain the Dancer's attention as they pull her hair. She turns around and sees the Pale Man approaching her. She doesn't move due to fear and drops some berries in the process. She looks up and sees all of the paintings of the Pale Man consuming children. She then turns around to run and slips on the berries she has dropped causing the music box to slide across the room. She crawls quickly towards it and grabs it just as the Pale Man is grabbing her ankles. He begins to claw at her face with his long fingernails. Eventually he claws her eyes out just as she is able to pull away. Blind, the Dancer then tries to escape before the door closes. The Pale Man then manages to place her eyes into his hands and use them to see. He chases after her as she is running into walls and stumbling. She finds the door and runs through as it closes. Finding a corner she begins to cry blood as she hears the Pale Man banging on the door. It is then realized that she is able to see only what he sees. The Faun then appears and is disappointed at her disloyalty but is saddened by what has happened to her. He helps her up and holds onto her. The Dancer never returned home after what had happened. The Faun had vowed that he would be her eyes. After what had happened, the Faun guided her to the open area where she first arrived at. He placed a bandage over her eyes. She played her own music box and began to dance trying to get the Faun to dance with her. The two danced for a while before he let her go. He told her that she would always be a princess in his eyes, but she is not meant to sit on the throne. He explained to her that she did fail him, but he will make sure he will do what is best for her. He grabbed the music box that was in the Pale Man's room and handed it to the Dancer. He told her that soon he would leave for a little bit but he wouldn't say when. He said that he would be back making a promise to her. He wound the box up as she placed it onto the floor. The box began to play Pan's Lullaby. He told her to keep winding the box before the music has ended so that she could dance forever. The Faun walked away as the Dancer began to dance to the music. She did not notice that he was gone and continued to dance. It was until that she started looking for him to dance with her that she realized that he was gone. She wound the box before the music ended and continued to dance and wait for him. Little did she know, the Faun would not return until the true princess has returned to the throne. She spent year dancing to the music waiting for the Faun to return. Depression began to sink in as she began to turn into a young woman. Her heart was broken and was turned to stone. One day the box was nearing the end of the lullaby and she did not wind it up again. Instead she continued to dance until it had stopped. Once there was silence, the Dancer stopped dead in her tracks in the final dance movement she was doing. She turned to stone as a statue at the center of the small cement circle. A little inscription appeared in front of her reading, \"Cegado por la tentación\", \"Blinded by temptation\" with the music box sitting in front of her. The Dancer stands in the labyrinth for years as her skin being to look like stone. Standing there, she still sees what the Pale Man sees. Her stone heart causes her to grow into madness and turn spiteful against the Faun for breaking his promise. When Ofelia appears into the Pale Man's room the Dancer shares what the Pale Man sees as he is chasing her down the hallway. She sees that Ofelia has a dagger and knew that she was sent by the Faun. It was realized that Ofelia was in fact the true princess. However, due to being made out of stone she is unable to do anything. Still waiting for the Faun to return and play the music again, she stands there as a statue forever blinded by her temptation of the fruit.

I suggested it because you can get the full effect of the feeling of the story. Prologue I looked at the clock on my nightstand; 3:30 am, it says. This long countless hours during the night never end. I roll over on my bed and stare at the dark patterns on my gloomy wall paper. My eyes start to tear as I think about my life; as I think about my family . The abusiveness is killing me. The bullying is killing me. I don't know how to live any longer. I can't. Chapter 1 I walk to school in the dark hours of the morning. I changed with the hidden stash of clothes I hide in the woods a few houses down from my own. I pack the stash with my favorite black boots, black jacket, and black pants I wear everyday. I hide my tattered clothes I'm forced to wear at home in the stash. I walk up to the locked gates of the school and sit down at the entrance. I take out my notebook and I start drawing; I start drawing my imaginary life, and family and life isn't as good and full of love as others. My life is dull and full of gray everywhere. My family isn't the best either, though, other people have it worse than I do, so of course I wouldn't say anything about them; and I don t want anybody to think that I want attention, because I know how that ends. The sky is now starting to turn a light, dark blue and the administration and the teachers of my high school are starting to come in. I grab my bags and get up as the morning janitor opens the front gate. I walk all the way to the now open library and hide in between the confinement of the bookshelves. I often come here to hide from people trying to hurt me. I come here to cry to myself silently sometimes. I try to hide my feelings around everybody, and here, I don't have to. The kids who try to be over achievers are starting to get here now. They are the people that are nice to me, because they know what it's like to be bullied, but they don't care if they are bullied themselves.

But I still love me some Spanish Civil War History, and we watched El Laberinto del Fauno in SpanishIV. GOD THIS IS OOC I KNOW. And it's BAD. Este cuento es MUY MALO. Es un poquito estupido. Jajajaja. Carmen touches the mirror with fingers that don't have as much feeling in them as they once did. She remembers being young, when she had to use thimbles to keep the ends of the needles from hurting her skin, her thumbs specifically. Now, they are callused, well worn, the hands of a seamstress who makes uniforms for the Frente Nacional and are caressing the worn down lines in the mirror where her new husband has been imagining how it would feel to slit his own throat. She has seen him do this when he thinks she's asleep. He pauses, so calculated, presses the blade against the glass and makes sharp, self-assured slashes into his unfeeling doppelganger. Carmen's old husband was a tailor. This shop is his shop, but this shop is going to be sold soon. They are moving to the mountains in two months, her new husband Captain Vidal and her. And Ofelia and the baby, of course. But those two… One lives inside of her and one lives so far away from her, it is tragic. Carmen doubts the unborn or the unawake will even notice the shift. \"What are you doing, dear?\" Vidal appears in the doorway in his shirtsleeves and well worn black trousers, his suspenders at the sides of his legs. Nothing but the gleam of the chain of his pocket watch distinguishes him as a man of power. \"Nothing. Washing my face.\" He smiles at her, mocking. He is always mocking her, wordlessly. In this regard, he is very much like the first man she married, the first man who gave her only a daughter. \"There's no water in the bowl,\" Vidal says. Carmen smiles back. The 'you've-caught-me-oh-dear' smile she has perfected in his honor. It involves a tilt of the head, a forced blush, a downward glance. \"No, there isn't.\" He moves closer to her, wraps one arm around her waist and puts his other hand on her stomach, just barely beginning to show the son she is creating. It will have his name, like he has his father's. \"So what were you doing?\" \"Planning to wash my face.\" \"Planning.\" \"Yes.\" She looks back at the mirror. \"Are you taking that with you when you go?\" He turns them both. \"Yes.\" \"Are you sure you don't want a new one?\" \"Why would I want that?\" \"This one just…\" She breaks away from his embrace and touches the scratches again. \"Is beaten up.\" She refrains from saying, 'like me.' She wants him to start over up North, so that when she gets there after him, though it may only be a week after, she can pretend that the man she is married to now will be good for her children. \"It's familiar.\" \"Right.\" Carmen has become very good at acknowledging what has been said, making the necessary noises to pretend she agrees with whatever the statement is. He looks at her critically, demanding more. \"I want you to be comfortable up North, after all,\" she continues. He nods, kisses her again. \"I will be. We will be. The open air is good for children. You'll see.\" She nods in time with him, her motions often as precise as his. She has become good at that since he started courting her. He likes the moving part trinkets in his life to run smoothly, be they given to him by his father or fate. Every night he winds them up and then lets them tick the rest of the 24 hour period under careful observation, held tightly to his side by silver chain or by the strength of his hands. \"Will you stop, when we go North?\" \"Stop what?\" \"What you do to the mirror.\" Vidal looks at the mirror, at his sharp, dark features beside Carmen's smooth face. The lines, slightly below their collars from this distance, suddenly stand out like the scars he can mostly conceal from the War. \"Why are you asking me something silly like that?\" he whispers, holding onto Carmen's upper arm now, his grip tight. She squirms slightly, mind racing frantically. \"I just want to know. I was hoping they would have mirrors at your station. For us to start over. So that our son might be born in the New Spain.\" This is one of his favorite phrases, 'the new, clean Spain.' She tries to fit it in where she can to make him happy. It works, most of the time. It works this time. He lets her go gently and nods. \"Good thinking, dear.\" He lifts the mirror off of the wall and lets it crash to the ground. She doesn't ask why he didn't just put it out in the street for someone else to take. Why he didn't just leave it at the house for after they move out. She just stares at the broken pieces and tries not to make the whole into an analogy, because that is something that little girls to. Comparing your life to a broken mirror, where you can still see bits of who you are, but in too many little fragments, is not something that a full grown woman having a second child by a wonderfully protective (that must be the word) Captain does. \"I'll clean that up.\" \"Good.\" He stands looking at the pieces, hearing his watch in his head, and does a better job of not romanticizing it. He doesn't romanticize anything. \"A new, clean Spain. We'll wipe the slate clear.\" Carmen goes to get the broom and starts sweeping the glass up, but Vidal takes it from her. \"Darling, I thought you wanted…\" \"I changed my mind,\" he says softly. \"Go ahead to bed. You should rest for my son.\" \"Alright.\" She goes, turns the corner with the practiced precision in his honor, but then stops right outside the door. A small part of her is hoping that he will call her back, that he will force her to clean it up. She doesn't trust her husband with things like shards of glass. What if he mistakes the reflection for himself? What if he finally finds the right direction to put the razor to his own throat? They exist, then, in stalemate, not but six feet from each other, but both so far. Vidal is the man who feels things only to the tick of a watch that should have been broken. He does not know the time of his birth anymore (others call it the time of the death of his father) and wonders if he should stop the watch at the time of his death. But it is such a lovely piece of steel and quartz that it would be rude to break it just because of some selfish human whim. He feels more like that watch than himself. Whatever he is supposed to be or feel like. And Carmen, with her calloused fingers and quiet prayers, cannot feel at all, and certainly cannot feel what her husband does, even if she were to touch his neck in the place where he has been imagining to cut it. Their bodies are an obstacle, trapping them in a world of reservation and emptiness. Though Carmen knows it is wrong, she sometimes wishes for the old, dirty Spain. Perhaps that things have been wiped clean is the problem. Perhaps if things were dirty again, it would all make sense. Or maybe her husband is right, and all they need is to purify the rest of the country, to rid Spain of the rebel ideals. At least then everyone would feel the same. If what they would be could be called feeling at all. A nation of tired women and men unsure of the right self to kill. ","Summary":" A/N: Oh, WOWDAMN. It's been *forever* since I wrote anything.

It's just a little background history of Pan set...sometime in time and space, although I always thought after the movie. Enjoy. Fire s In The Sky By Weregrrl Pan relaxed slightly as the night air hit his figure in a rush. He was cutting it close, walking around at this time of night in the mortal realm. The sun had very nearly grazed his cheek as he unfolded from the shadows of the underworld, his limbs creaking as a tree's boughs, jagged and mercilessly aged by the seasons. Heavy with the years he carried on his back, he stood, silently allowing the wind to graze his skin and tangle his already matted hair as it danced nimbly by. His life was coming to an end, he felt, but as he stood in the glorious, dark, freedom of the upperworld, he could not find it in himself to care for anything, much less the future. His world was gone, regardless of what he wished. This was the very reason he was dying, because even an escapee from a massacre will eventually be forced to meet with his demise. And what better way to go , thought he, than head on. Being who he was, and after living throughout the lifetimes of many mortals and fae alike, Pan thought he had developed a fairly accurate pallet when it came to tasting the thoughts of others. Oh, he was no mind-reader, but it was not unknown to him the myths about his kind, the implications of the glances shot his way. He was well aware of his supposed \"immortality\"; his God-hood. In truth, satyrs lived very long lives, but they were far from immortal, and most definitely not invincible – just a tad harder to kill than most. And Pan had already died. Multiples of them. He was not entirely sure as to how the legend of 'Pan' had began, as it was a ceremonial name only, bestowed upon those who, at birth, had been chosen to tend the fields and forests of the Ancient Land. He snorted in his contemplative state. He hoped he looked dissimilar to the past Pan of the forests. His horns had been atrocious. He frightened even the young of his own kind; stumbling kids, still new to their hooves found themselves gaining accuracy quickly in running from the poor creature. Considering the ingrained love of all things new in the world by most fauns, this had upset the fool greatly until he had mated and produced his own kids, all blessed with the physical gifts of their mother, and the surprising kindness of their father. Alas, they had been driven with the rest of the satyrs from the upperworld when the rebellious fae of the North had appeared amongst the humans, convincing them to strip the forests of their trees due to their own envy of the hoofed creatures' prospering community. Pan shook his head slightly, as if to rid himself of the memories of that time, so far ago. The images still blazed, as the fires had that night, behind his eyes; on that terrible night that the forests had burned. Streaks of ebony and flaming red crossed his ageless memory, smoke suffocated, as vicious flames lapped gently at his skin, burning and peeling the bark-like substance without actually seeming threatening; becoming entrancing even to his innocence. He had been so young then…and he had failed his duty. If it were not for his negligence; if he had been there in time; if his sense of smell was more developed – so many ifs! And yet only one conclusion: the satyrs had retreated underground, falling into the darkness of myths and legends, and old wives tales as they did so. The majority of sidhe had followed soon after, and magic faded from above. Perhaps the most shocking of all for him though, was when the youngling fauns began to age at an alarming rate, loosing their glossy fur, their soft skin; turned to impenetrable masses of bark, foliage; when the lilting voices of his kind became the scraping gasps of a forest in agony; when going back into the sun resulted in the loss of memories and assurances of a most painful death. And then there was nothing to be done – the hooves of kids, concealed beneath twisting claws of wood, struck into the ground, gaining more strength each time they were upheaved, until the last of the fauns were trapped and became a wooden relic, breath slowing, hearts ceasing, and yet never did their veins halt in the production of magic. He was the only one left. He felt sure this was only due to his role as forest-keeper. The trees refused to let him die, or perhaps he was already so dead inside that it mattered not whether he still walked upon two legs, for his essence was missing now; gone. Pan rubbed the bridge of his nose gently, sighing. Try as he might, he could not help but dwell on his past misdeeds. A sudden brightness far beyond alerted the faun to a disturbance in the world, his breath hitching as he replayed thoughts of the fires. Catching sight of the sun rising, the creature smirked sardonically. So it was the heavens mocking him, was it? He almost laughed aloud at the irony. Such a 'God' he was. Thinking momentarily of letting the fire in the sky take him, Pan shook his head with disgust. He hadn't yet paid nearly enough for his sins. Perhaps one day…but not now. True, he sensed his death as imminent, yet for all his years, Pan was still only a young man-goat. He had so many things to do before he let death take him. Loping back into the darkness from whence he came, Pan allowed yet another twisted smile grace his lips. Perhaps the ending of his days was not so close after all. With that thought to guide him, the satyr hobbled through the low underground tunnels to an odd patch of trees, where he proceeded to settle down at the roots of a particularly wild looking oak, its leaves and branches twined throughout each other in an almost alarming array. Shaking his head drowsily, he could not help but think upon how truly unruly his father's horns had been before drifting off into a familiar state of oblivion.

Long ago, in a world more beautiful than anyone could ever imagine, where there are no lies or pain there lived a princess who dreamt of the human world. She dreamt of blue skies, the soft breeze and sunshine however her father the king always forbade her from traveling to that other world. He knew of the creatures that walked that other earth. The ones who passed humans daily going unnoticed, some camoflaughed to appear as mere mortals themselves. However he did not tell his daughter this and feeling as if her father was only being overprotective caused a tremendous sadness upon her. One day eluding her keepers the princess escaped. Once outside the sunlight blinded her and erased her memory. She forgot who she was and where she came from. She suddenly realised she was traveling through a strange forest and as the sun set the forest grew darker and darker and whispers and footsteps could be heard in the wind. For a grave monster, more terrifying and evil than any other had caught onto her scent and tracked her. Growing weaker by the days the monster watched her, waiting for his chance to strike and consume her. He knew consuming the heart of an immortal would cause him to become immortal and this he craved more than anything. Finally his chance came and although she fought hard she was not able to get away.

Ofelia – \"No,\" she reminded herself, \"Princess Moanna\" – only knew that she was almost asleep on her feet and that in her old world it must have been the middle of the night. The celebration had lasted for hours; everyone wanted to welcome and worship their returned little princess. She was introduced to countless people (all who seemed remarkably familiar), feasted until she could not eat another morsel (although she avoided the grapes, which conjured up frightening memories), and danced, mostly with the Faun (who, despite being significantly taller than her, seemed to fit her perfectly). It had been fabulously entertaining, but now she was sleepy, and the festivities did not appear to be slowing in the slightest. Moanna yawned loudly from the spot on the floor she had sat on out of sheer exhaustion, and the Faun looked down at her, a comforting smile on his face. \"Tired, Your Highness?\" He sounded like the earth and the water and forgotten, favorite fairytales, and she tilted her head and smiled back. \"Mmm-hmm.\" \"Come with me then,\" he said gently, taking her hand and helping her to her feet. \"I will take you to your chamber.\" She let him lead her through the twisted maze of a castle, refusing to let go of his hand for fear of stumbling in the dark. The dark itself was consuming, seeming to press down on her eyes until the dark of the night and the dark of her closed eyelids were indistinguishable. She stumbled and awoke half a minute later in his arms, the clacking of his hooves the only sound as he carried her down the hallway. \"Oh, I'm sorry,\" she mumbled, clumsily rubbing her eyes, \"I guess I'm sleepier than I thought.\" She yawned again, and he chuckled and turned into a doorway on the right. She could not make out the details of the room but could see the outline of a bed, which was all she needed at the moment. He placed her on the luscious, almost feathery comforter, and she found herself missing the embrace of his rough, tree-like arms, comfortable though her bed was. How peculiar. Then she hardly remembered he was there at all and began to slip her gown off, almost trancelike, so she could finally fall asleep. She had only succeeded in uncovering her shoulders when his strangled cry of \"No, Princess!\" broke through her foggy daze. She stopped and looked up at him in alarm and was surprised to see the spiral markings on his forehead glowing a faint blue. The moon marking on her shoulder was also glowing, she noticed, and she stared at him, puzzlement written in her childish eyes. \"I-I'm so sorry, Your Majesty,\" he said ashamedly, hanging his head. \"You were not supposed to find out so soon.\" \"Find out what?\" \"This.\" He touched her shoulder, and it seemed to burn under his fingertip. \"The moon.\" He touched his forehead. \"And the ocean.\" \"The moon and the ocean?\" she repeated. \"You mean, the tides?\" He nodded and then paused, mentally gathering his words before continuing. \"You and I, Your Highness, have a…a connection. One that has been since the beginning of time and will remain until the end.\" \"Oh.\" She lowered her head to the silken pillow and closed her eyes. For a moment, he thought she had fallen asleep, when she asked, \"What kind of a connection?\" \"Oh, Princess,\" he murmured, \"I wish that you did not have to know, not now. I wanted to shield you from the knowledge until it was more…favorable.\" She opened her eyes and gestured for him to continue anyway. He gingerly sat on the edge of the bed and took one of her small hands in both of his. \"Moanna,\" he spoke, and she was faintly surprised that he said her name without a formality attached, \"we are fated to be…I suppose 'married' is the term you would comprehend the most.\" This time, her eyes nearly doubled in size, all traces of exhaustion momentarily vanished. \"Y-you mean, we are betrothed?\" she stammered. \"No, no, not 'betrothed'. Simply destined. It is going to happen, regardless of any conflicting circumstances.\" \"But I…I'm just a little girl! I'm only twelve years old!\" she exclaimed. \"And you, well, you must be hundreds of years old-\" \"Ah,\" he said, waving his hand dismissively. \"Time, ages, they have no place in the Underworld. You have been here just as long as I, Your Highness.\" He tapped the tip of her nose and grinned. \"Perhaps you are older!\" She knew he was teasing her, and she giggled. Then his expression saddened, and her laughter ceased. \"You are correct, though,\" he said softly, disappointment evident in his voice. \"When you ran away, your form was much older. Not quite ready, but in about a season or two-\" He closed his eyes and broke off for a moment. \"We knew you might return in a different body. I was prepared for that. But I never envisioned…a mere child…\" He looked at her hurriedly. \"Not that it is any of your fault, my Moanna. You are still Moanna; the body is nothing but a physicality. But you must understand…I have waited for so long …and waiting is torture.\" \"Waiting for what?\" she asked innocently, and he laughed bitterly. \"The fact that you don't know proves that you are too young.\" \"Maybe if you show me-\" \"Do not tempt me, little Princess,\" he said quickly, removing her hand from his. \"It would not be right. You are not ready…and, for that matter, neither am I.\" \"No?\" she questioned curiously. \"I have to grow up, but what is it that you have to do?\" He turned and smiled. \"Do you find me handsome?\" \"No,\" she said truthfully, and he nodded. \"Fauns are stunning creatures, flawlessly beautiful even,\" he explained. \"Perfect in a way mortals never can be. But staying on Earth, waiting for century after century, battered by time and the elements-\" He flicked his shoulder, and a section of the bark-like exterior fell away to reveal smooth, pale skin. \"-it took its toll.\" \"Then why did you wait for so long?\" He touched her cheek, and she couldn't help but to lean into his touch. \"Because I love you,\" he said simply, \"since the beginning of time until the end.\" She smiled. \"That's very sweet of you.\" \"Oh, don't worry about not loving me back,\" he said kindly, \"you will soon enough. I used to look very much like your fairytale's Prince Charming: young and agile and…\" \"…and charming?\" she finished. \"Yes, and charming.\" \"Marrying Prince Charming would be nice,\" she confessed, \"although I think I would love you even if you stayed just as you are.\" \"You are very kind, Princess Moanna.\" He bent down and dared to place a delicate kiss on her cheek then gasped as she flung her arms around his neck. \"I suppose if I have to be destined to marry someone,\" she whispered into his long, blond hair, \"you are the best I could have.\" Then she let him go and closed her eyes. He strode to her door, slightly overwhelmed and was about to leave when he heard her ask one final question. \"That baby I'm holding…in the statue with you and me…it's our baby, isn't it?\" He smiled. \"Yes, Princess. He will marry the fairy that brought you to me.\" She laughed sleepily, already drifting off. \"But she's so small…\" He shrugged and exited the room. \"She too will have to change. Goodnight.\" Then he closed the door and was gone. \"I'm twelve,\" she mumbled then corrected herself. \"I'm in an twelve-year-old's body . And princesses are married when they are sixteen.\" Suddenly, four years seemed a terribly long time, and as she finally slipped into sleep, she hoped that time in the Underworld passed a bit faster than time on Earth. The End[Chapter 2] Ebb Moanna tiptoed down the black hallway, hoping she really was as silent as she thought she was being. This was madness, shear madness . And here she went doing it anyway, her continuing feet not caring about the madness in the slightest. She knew the way exactly, two years of following the same route having cemented the path into her mind. She had never actually been inside his bedchamber though. He had never expressly forbid her from entering, but he had also never invited her inside. She only knew the way because she constantly came there of her own accord, flying down the castle's passages until she could hammer on his door and ask for him to come out and visit. He would have come visit with her regardless of her eager summoning, but the second she was awake, she couldn't think of anything else she wanted to do besides see him. And so almost every day for the two years since she had come home to the Underworld, her morning started with her knuckles rapping on his wooden door. But this time, it was the middle of the night. This time, she was not a little girl anymore. This time, she wanted to give him everything that had alluded him for so long. Her hand raised to knock, but she dropped it at the last moment. He might not answer or worse, he might hold the door shut so she couldn't get in. That she was destined to marry him never fazed her, never troubled her like he always seemed to be sure it would. It was just a pleasant, little fact that played around in her mind as she played around with him during her childhood. Oh, she would marry her dear friend, and wasn't that nice, and they would have a little baby, and wasn't that nice too? The only fear she ever had over the arrangement was that of childbirth and blood, but there was no pain in this world, so that fear quickly diminished until she could hardly remember ever having it. She clutched the golden doorknob with a fervor that surprised her. The cloud that had hung over her happy fantasy picture had always been his look. His look, his longing, his lingering. There was something that he wanted - needed, she almost wanted to say - and it pained him to his core, and she had been powerless to help him. He helped her with everything, and the one thing that it seemed only she could help him with, she could not. Oh, how she wanted to, to ease his suffering! But how could she when she had not had the slightest idea what it was he needed, and he refused to tell her? She turned the knob and slid into the room, slowly, slowly closing the door behind her. It was a bit brighter in here, some light from outside making its way through the window. His chamber was almost barren, but there were so many leaves and roots and twigs and soil strewn about that the room hardly felt empty. The only furniture wasn't furniture at all. A large...nest, she would call it, for lack of a better word...hung from the ceiling by thick vines. That's where he was, but she only stood and observed for a moment. Two years had changed him, even more so than they had changed her. Two years had given her womanly curves and a womanly mind to accompany them, two years had practically given him a complete transformation. Practically because there was still some bark, his hair was still somewhat matted, he still managed to give people a bit of a fright when they first saw him. Her hair was long and wavy down her back like her mother's had been. She looked two years older, and he looked what must have been a century younger. He had asked her once if she found him handsome. Her answer had been no, and her answer was still no but the most tentative no because she could more than see how magnificent the end result would be. Her attraction to him had little to do with his looks anyway. It had to do with his tone and his soul and his mannerisms. It had to do with things that were ancient and earthy and secret. It had to do with his ocean to her moon. She was at the edge of the nest now. It was made of furs and sticks and feathers, and it was soft, and the whole bed swung slightly as she climbed up. He stirred, his eyes twitching behind their lids, but he remained asleep; she crept closer and gently touched his cheek. He jerked awake. \" Moanna... \" His voice was deep with sleep and what she now recognized as desire, and she shivered. \"Moanna?\" Now he sounded more like himself, soothing and concerned. \"Are you alright? What is wrong?\" \"I'm fine.\" She traced a finger up and down his arm, feeling the muscles move under the tip. \"But you are not.\" \"Me?\" He appeared confused, an always-amusing thing to see on his usually self-possessed visage. \"You haven't been fine for a long, long time.\" \"Your Highness-\" He chuckled good-humoredly. \"-I assure you, I am just fine. Shall I walk you back to your chamber?\" \"When did you know that we were fated to be together?\" \"I-\" He chose to not ignore her question. \"I can't remember not knowing.\" \"But when was that?\" \"...a long, long time ago.\" \"You haven't been fine for a long, long time.\" \"Perhaps not,\" he said hurriedly, \"but do not trouble yourself with the feelings of a sentimental faun like me.\" \"But I-\" \"I'm going to walk you back now.\" There was determination in his voice, and she wondered if the statement was to convince her or himself. He moved to get up, and she speedily put a palm on his chest and pushed him down. \"No.\" She did not have even a fraction of his strength, but her determination was stronger than his. She hadn't come this far to be turned away. He just stared up at her with wide eyes, a hundred conflicting emotions rendering him paralyzed. \" Pan ,\" she breathed, coming dangerously close to him, \" I know what you want. \" She was kissing him. He was still for more than a handful of moments. \" No... \" His hands were on her shoulders, but he was pushing her away with zero enthusiasm. Then, \" Please... \" He brought a hand to his forehead as if ashamed that the plea had been spoken. \" Moanna...you can't know...tell me you don't... \" \"I do.\" She pressed herself flush against him and could feel his heart thundering against her chest. \"And I want it too.\" \"I-I'm sorry,\" he rambled. \"You must think me vulgar and carnal and-\" \"I think that you are in love and have been for enough time that other men would have been driven insane.\" \"Insane.\" He scoffed. \"And who says I am not? You have no idea...you cannot comprehend how I have burned for you.\" She was frightened by his intensity, but it turned to a kind of thrilling burning of her own. \"You are not ready. You are going to leave now, and tomorrow we will fail to mention that this happened, and you will never come here again.\" \"You can't make me.\" She kissed him again, pushing against his lips with a ferocity that shocked him. \"Do you think you are tortured now? I will mention this tomorrow and the next day and forever. I will never give you a moment's rest. And you will break, I know you will, I don't care how long it takes.\" \"You give my self-control entirely too much credit,\" he said in a whispered hiss, and she was on her back, her hands grasping desperately onto his horns as his mouth moved with hers. It was eternal and powerful and gently beautiful and over too soon. \"I can't,\" he gasped, severing the bond. His eyes were clutching at something that looked like fright or maybe temptation. \"My Princess, I can't.\" \"Why-\" \"I've waited forever, surely two more years are manageable!\" She cupped his cheek sympathetically. \"You know that's a lie.\" \"A lie? I could wait another eternity if that was what you wanted.\" \"But it's not what I want. I want you.\" She leaned up into him, and she heard him groan. \"Please.\" \"You will have me one day.\" \"You would deny me?\" She was hurt, and she let it show. \"You would put me through the agony you are so familiar with? How can you, if you love me?\" \"I can precisely because I love you.\" The firmness in his tone made her shrink back a bit into the feathery bed. \"Because I love your honor, and I love your virtue. Because maybe I would...I would love to watch you experience the agony that I have. Because then when the restraints are lifted, and we can have each other freely, it will be...\" \"What.\" She was hardly breathing, hanging on his every word. \"What will it be.\" \"Perfection.\" He grazed his lips against hers. \"I will make you-\" His fingertips brushed against the peak of one heaving breast through the thin fabric of her nightgown, one by one. \"-feel magnified in reality-\" He ground himself against her, and she practically cried in frustrated pleasure. \"-what you could only dream of imagining.\" \"Two years?\" Her mouth hung open sorrowfully. \"Oh, Pan. How can I?\" \"If you promise to go when I tell you to, if you promise to leave me be, perhaps I can-\" He smiled. \"-do little things every once in a while to lessen the ache.\" She awoke in her room the next morning, lips swollen and hair disheveled. His words came floating back to her. \"I could never deny you completely.\" The End ","Summary":" Tides By: 1000 th Ghost *This story is dedicated to Charlie for yelling \"HE'S GOING TO RAPE HER!!"},{"Movie":"Pan's Labyrinth El laberinto del f...","Title":"Dear Diary","Author":"leroyjenkinsthe45th","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10161233","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Diary: Monday Mom will not quit bleeding. At least in my dreams. Its early the morning so I got out of bed and went to the bathroom to wash my face. I couldn't stop my hands from trembling and my eyes were just a little bloodshot, so the cold water felt good against my face. I changed clothes and took the time to right in you sweet diary. Afterwords I went into my Mom's room, usually she's on bed rest but last night I heard the doctor and captain talking; She needed some \"fresh air\". It is indeed a beautiful day outside. Diary: Tuesday Things are good, nothing serious going on. Mom is back to laying in bed all day. She said the baby was still keeping her up at night, I'll be happy when my brother is born; he's giving my Mom a lot of problems. If I could get rid of my brother to stop the problems I swear I would, but it's just not that simple. I just want Mom to be happy. Afternoon: I'm really starting to worry diary, the Faun seem really mad that I ate a couple of stupid grapes. He got really mad and said that I couldn't be a princess anymore. If I can't be a princess Mom can't be the queen! I'll figure something out, I have a weird feeling the Faun isn't done with me. Diary: Wednesday Something really bad happened today; early in the morning the captain found the resistance. Or at least some of them, I only got to see this one guy: his feet were dragging a trail of blood and he refused to look up so I didn't get to see his face. He really looked like he needed help and he certainly wasn't going to get it. Oh diary, I hope they don't do anything too bad to him. He's just fightning for what he believes in, just like the captain.[Chapter 2] Diary: Thursday Moms going to burst any day now. She looks like someone took the ration supply and stuck it all in her stomach. But, she's just as beautiful as ever, just sad. Who knows, maybe today will be the day. I'm writing so early in the morning because I just woke up from another bad dream, I can see the sun starting to rise above the trees that seem to be guarding us from the outside world, so I guess there's no point in going back to sleep. In my dream there's screaming coming from my Mom's bedroom, and everytims I try to go into the room the captain just pushes me back and tells me to go away. So I just sit on the cold, dusty floor and wait. Then it gets worse, after a couple of moments I hear an explosion and someone says \"the baby's here\". After that there's a pregnant pause (no pun intended diary).Then there's blood. Blood everywhere! Blood in the hallways, covering the floor, and its all over my clothes. The baby cries from inside the room and then the dream is over. That's what I woke up to today. Fortunately nothing like that is going to happen. I got myself out of bed and went through the same boring routine of washing my face, going to the kitchen to eat breakfast, today I could finally receive the privelege of being able to walk outside again. Yesterday the maid wouldn't let me go outside. I could tell something was going horribly wrong. There was screaming, yelling, even sounds of crushing coming from the ration-building. Maid had her eye closed and teeth clenched as she told me to go back up upstairs, it would \"all be over soon\". Oddly enough, she was right. You can hear the birds chirping and the wind blowing against our house. Kind of a deadly silence, but still. Silence none the less. Afternoon: I swear diary this is might be the last time I get to write to you for a couple of days. Moms in labor, and they won't let me go inside. I just keep pacing hallways, then after a while I went back to you to write this. I think I'm going to go back and sit by the captain now, my pacing was making me nervous. And that not good for either of us. Later: I have to talk to something! I can't believe it, I can't believe it! MOM DIED. She died! I'm never going to see her again, I...[Chapter 3] Dear Diary, I know I probably shouldn't be doing this, but I can't help it. This book needs a happy ending. No, I'm not Ofelia. To the disgust of everyone, Ofelia was killed by the captain late at night, yesterday. I'm Mercedes: the maid of Mr. Vidal and company. Understand, I'm not trying to add. Just simply finishing what Ofelia started. Shortly after the death of her Mother, Ofelia took her brother and tried to run away. I'm not for sure we're she was going. We found her at the labyrinth, dead. Without her brother, we suspect he was taken by Captain Vidal considering the fact that we found the baby in the Captain's arms. Thereforetee we assume she was shot by her own step-father. She was such a sweet girl, and whatever she was doing she had the best intentions. If there any one person caught in the middle of this that didn't deserve to die, it was Ofelia. I don't know if anyone will ever read this, and if no one does that's just fine. But, I know that wherever Ofelia is... she is much happier there than she was here. Her brother would be so proud. Ofelia, we will meet you on the other side. We love you.

His wife was gone. Long time. And, he chases her still. He thought she had loved him. But she loved power more. Influence. For a time, he provided it. He was big time boxer in Russia. His trainers said he cut though competition life hot knife in butter. He was in peak condition. He was near perfect specimen for boxing ring or other sporting games. But, like the harsh winters of Motherland, Ivan was brutal. He punished. He pummeled. He left opponent with no ability to stand, much less fight. He was top boxer for USSR back then. Went to Olympics and brought home Gold. Ludmilla clung to him with lustful vigor. She liked his brutality. She liked his celebrity. Such as it was in USSR. It gave her privilege. His Gold medal brought offers for fights in other countries. She saw them for what they could do for her. More money. More power. More. More. More. Ivan was blind then. Stupid Ox. He saw same things and wanted them too. With her. He was full of rage and pride and…love. He would do what she wanted because he loved her. He did not see that she did not love him. At least, in the way he had given himself to her. She 'loved' him as long as he brought home bacon. Like Americans say. His Gold medal brought an offer that neither she, and, by extension he, could not refuse. It was exhibition match with American former Champion Apollo Creed. He was no longer champion. But money was good. Trip to USA was good. Ludmilla was over moon. She saw USA vs USSR bluster as sexy. Like Khrushchev, she expected him to 'bury' capitalist pigs. He would do so for her. Las Vegas had been victory for Ivan. Creed was butter to his knife. Folded like St Basil's Cathedral of cards. Creed's promoters must not have done homework. Ivan had no mercy, and pride goes before fall. Creed fell for last time. In that place, Ivan felt no remorse, no guilt, no pain for having caused death of Creed. For most part, it is same now. But LasVegas was only beginning. Champion Rocky Balboa could not just be sad for friend. He had to come for revenge. He had to make it big show. Ivan had nothing to prove, but fight with champion is more money. More prestige. Ludmilla would be very happy. Which meant Ivan would be happy. Balboa came to Russia for fight. Brought family. Little boy. See the world. See Papa fight big bad Russian bear. Ivan thought Balboa would be same as Creed. Pushover. Revenge is strong motivator, but sheer force of Russian will would not be overcome. Ivan sighs heavily as he recalls bout with Balboa. His height, reach, and density of Russian tree was weakness to little bee stinging over and over. Balbboa was fast. Faster than Ivan thought. No excuses. He is champion for reason. Ivan lost. Lost bout. Lost money. Big money, anyway. Lost confidence of Ludmilla. After bout, seeing Balboa wrapped in American flag, Ivan spits in ground and hardens his heart. This would not be end. He would see awe in Ludmilla's eyes again. He would come back. It was dream that fueled him for a year. Two, three big fights. He won those bouts, but promoters say his fire is gone. No more Siberian Bull. More like Siberian Blizzard. Not as exciting. Cold. During that year, two things happened. Ludmilla turned sour. Like milk in ice box too long. Also, Ludmilla got pregnant. Two more years and she was gone. She left Ivan for politician. Power. Influence. He was left with baby Viktor. 20 years pass and Ivan has turned Viktor into mini-me. Younger, more powerful, more rage filled version of himself so many years ago. He has told self and son that what they must do to get mother back, to have wife come home. He has filled son with hate for USA, for Balboa, even for Russian establishment. He has trained his boy brutally. It was only way. Only way to regain Glory. There must be place inside Ivan that knows what he is doing is wrong, poisoning his son with lies. But that is bitterness. Sharing poison given to you with those around you, even those most precious. To make long repetitive story short, Ivan went to America with Viktor when he heard son of Creed was now Champion. Viktor was ready. History would be repeated. Creed would be crushed. It went like he expected. Little Creed was no match for Viktor. Total dominance. Creed was broken like his father. But lived. That's ok. But Viktor made stupid mistake; arrogant, unfocused mistake. It cost him Title after fight was over. Disqualified. Ivan could have lost control. But he remained focused. If Viktor was Champion then even now Ludmilla might come back. No, Ivan knew there was no going back. But, it was enough to see pride in the name Drago again, even for a son she hardly knew. It took long time for Creed to recover. Long time for him think he might be able to win a rematch. It was false hope in Ivan's mind. Viktor did not seem to care. He lived on his father's words even when they did not make sense to him. He would crush Creed again. But the false hope was not in Creed. It ended up in Ivan. Same arrogance. Same blindness. Same inability to adapt. Viktor was a brute, as Ivan had been, but brute force could not extinguish the heart of man who no longer had a father; a man with an identity to forge. Adonis Creed had heart where Ivan had none and thus his son had none either. Balboa. Not Creed's father. But the heart he needed. Ivan thinks he sounds like an old woman, now. Creed put beating on Viktor that may be equal to what Ivan had done to his father. But where Apollo Creed had been unwilling to relent, Ivan would not see his son dead for his own pride. He had thrown in the towel and conceded the bout. It was in the moments after his dear Ludmilla walked out in her son and former husband's moment of need. If he could not have her, Ivan knew that his son would be all he would ever have in this life. He would beat this bitterness with help of Viktor. Or, other way around. Viktor will help him. One way or other, he will find new reason to live. Perhaps, even talk to Balboa on next trip to USA. Who knows? ","Summary":" Throwing in the Towel Ivan Drago was a bitter old man and he knew it.

This is my first published work, so if you have any constructive criticism I would love to hear it so that I can be better. I wrote this because I felt that Viktor did not get enough love in the movie. This takes place directly after the ending fight between Adonis Creed and Viktor Drago. Hopefully, Viktor doesn't seem too out of character. I don't own anything except for my own character. Thank you for reading! Olena Markov took the long walk through the cement hallway on the way to her boyfriend's locker room. Following the loss, Olena knew that Viktor wouldn't have wanted her to come into the ring and console him. Instead, she waited until the crowds cleared and everyone had left the building in the hopes that she could have a moment alone with Viktor. After all of her waiting, Olena still didn't know what to say. She couldn't even imagine what he'd be feeling since he grew up and trained his entire life for this fight, only to have come up short. On top of losing the battle in the ring, Viktor lost much more than his pride. Olena watched as Viktor's mother left when he was not fighting up to her standards. Olena saw the look on Viktor's face when he took notice of his mother's absence and knew that his devastation would ensure his defeat. Olena was furious and almost went to follow Ludmilla out of the arena and give her own interpretation of the Drago family business, but she would not abandon her Viktor. Slowly, Olena approached the locker room with the bold letters spelling out Viktor's last name on the door. She became increasingly more nervous after each step and felt her hands sweat, but took a deep breath and walked in the oversized room, prepared for any outcome. What Olena did not expect to see was Adonis Creed sitting in the stall next to Viktor. Adonis looked up to see her dumbfounded face, stood and began to limp out of the room, but not before sending Olena a soft smile. When Creed finally left the room, Olena came out of her daze. She stood on the opposite side of the room and took a glance at Viktor. He sat on a bench looking miserable and exhausted. In all of Olena's time with Viktor, she had never seen him so damaged after a fight. Olena almost didn't know how to react to Viktor's distraught form, but she continued to stare at him until he met her gaze. It took a moment but he eventually looked up for a second and almost immediately avoided her eyes. Olena wouldn't accept this and sauntered over to Viktor. When she reached him, she grabbed a nearby stool that his trainer used before the fight to tape his hands, and took a seat. Viktor still towered over her even when they were sitting down. Olena gently placed her hands on his knees but was interrupted when his father, Ivan Drago appeared. \"May we please have a minute Ivan?\" Olena asked politely in Russian, her native tongue. He nodded wordlessly in response and shut the door behind him as he left the room. Viktor had yet to look up from the floor since he and Olena shared a brief glance several minutes ago. Olena brought a soft hand under his chin and raised it so that he would be forced to look at her. When he finally met her green orbs, Olena saw all of the pain and sadness in his eyes. She took her time before speaking and chose her words carefully, not sure how Viktor would react. \"I'm proud of you,\" Olena stated confidently. Viktor appeared stunned by her statement. How could she be proud of him when he just lost the biggest fight in his career? \"How can you be proud? I lost.\" He said quietly in his deep voice. \"It's not all about winning, you know. You fought your absolute hardest with everything you had, anyone would have been proud to watch you.\" \"Then why'd she leave?\" Viktor pulled away from her hand and looked down at the floor again, starting to shed silent tears. Olena wasted no time tenderly wiping his tears with her thumbs, only to have him wince slightly as she got near his bruised eye. \"Your mother is a cold and selfish and cruel woman. She does not deserve to have a child as wonderful as you,\" she saw his frown deepen and Olena tried to lighten the mood \"it took everything in my power not to knock her ass out.\" Viktor slightly looked up and gave Olena a small smile, a rare but welcomed sight. Olena started again \"I'm so sorry that she hurt you, but I'll make sure it never happens again. You have gone through your whole life without her and you've grown up to be kind, strong, and independent with her not around. Babe, you're so much better off without her.\" She spoke slowly hoping that all of her words would sink in and Viktor would understand their power. There was a long pause in the conversation until Viktor spoke up \"You're right. I just feel…\" he tried to express. Feelings were never Viktor's strong suit, but he always tried to communicate them accurately. \"I've just always wanted her to love me.\" He spoke. Olena stood up in anger and responded almost immediately with so much passion in her voice that she sounded like a preacher on Sunday morning. \"Look at me and listen well Viktor Drago.\" Viktor looked up, almost fearful of Olena. \"You do not need that woman's love because… because I love you and so does your father.\" Now it was Olena's turn to avoid eye contact. Viktor stared at Olena in pure disbelief. In the several months since they had finally made their relationship official after years of friendship, neither party had given any verbal confirmation of love. \"You love me?\" Viktor whispered incredulously. \"Why do you sound so surprised? I have loved you and will continue to do so. I will never abandon you or leave you when you need me, and I promise I will always be there for you whether you win or lose.\" No words were shared for several moments and Olena began to feel self-conscious that Viktor reciprocate her affection. With a pained moan, Viktor rose to his feet to meet her. He didn't even take the time to look at her, but instead, he wrapped his arms around her. It always surprised Olena how gentle Viktor actually is and how his arms could do so much destruction yet be so warm and inviting. Olena returned the hug ever so slightly as to not aggravate his injuries. After several moments, Viktor slightly broke away from the embrace and placed his forehead on Olena's. \"I love you too.\" She smiled and kissed him deeply, engulfing him in another hug. Viktor winced and tensed up and Olena immediately pulled away. \"I'm sorry, I got a little carried away there.\" Olena blushed. Viktor gave a short chuckle and gave her a short kiss. After they broke apart, she clapped her hands together twice \"Alright, let's get going. We need to go back to our hotel so you can get some rest.\" \"Who said I wanted to rest?\" Viktor asked playfully. Olena laughed and smiled at him. \"Honey, you wouldn't be able to handle me in your condition.\" Now it was Viktor's turn to laugh. His laughter was one of Olena's favorite sounds on earth and was always excited to hear it. As Viktor walked over to his locker to collect his things, he had an overwhelming thought. \"Olena, what are we going to do after this is all over?\" He blurted, suddenly nervous about the couple's future. Olena collected her thoughts and spoke \"I have a lot of money saved up, we can take some time, explore the world a little. Maybe, we could even find you something new that you enjoy doing.\" He looked at her and smiled \"I'd like that very much. As long as you're there with me.\" Olena walked over to him and placed her hands on his cheeks and responded with the only word that came to mind \"always.\" Thank you for reading!

He had seen enough. He had just watched his protégé, Adonis Creed, get the Hell beat out of him by Viktor Drago, son of the man who killed Donny's father and Rocky's adversary and friend, Apollo Creed. Rocky grabbed a rocks glass and a bottle of Jameson Whiskey from the behind the bar. He poured the whiskey into his glass. He was overridden with grief. More so now than when he when Apollo died in his arms in the ring the night he fought Ivan Drago. \"I tried to warn him. The kid's as stubborn as his old man.\" Rocky hadn't had a drop of alcohol since the night Adrian died sixteen years ago. He never felt the need for it until tonight. Guilt is a real son of a bitch. Rocky shot the whiskey from the glass into his mouth down his throat. \"Neither one of them would listen.\" Rocky refilled his glass. He looked up and saw the picture of Apollo on the wall. \"I'm sorry Apollo.\" Rocky shot the refill in the same fashion as the forst down his throat. A voice quickly shook him from his moment of self-pity. \"Maybe you should be Stallion!\" From the shadows appeared a long-gone figure dressed to the nines in an expensive suit and tie and shoes made out of genuine alligator hide. The dark figure walked with a swagger that echoed class, ego, style, and an aura of self confidence that Rocky would not confuse with anyone else in the world living or dead. The figure's smile lit up the room. Rocky knew he the figure was but couldn't believe it was him. \"Apollo?! Is it really you?\" \"Who else were you expecting? Paulie? He sends his best by the way.\" \"Damn. I'm never drinking again.\" \"This ain't the Jameson talking Stallion. It's really me. I'm here, and I gotta tell you, I'm not happy!\" \"I'm sorry Apollo. I tried to warn him I tried-\" \"Don't give me that shit Stallion! I didn't come here for no apology.\" \"He's just as stubborn as you are or were or whatever.\" \"You abandoned him Rocky! Why Damn it! Why?!\" \"I didn't want him to get hurt. I didn't want him to to\" \"To what? End up like me?!\" \"You don't know what its been like to carry the guilt like I have the last thirty-three years. I can't carry no more. Not for you or him!\" \"Oh God! Here we go! You've got guilt because of what happened. Let's clear the air right now: As far as you and I are concerned, you don't have a damned thing to be guilty about! I knew exactly what I was doing taking that fight with the Russian. I didn't take the fight because of me or him, I took it because of you Rock.\" \"Because of me.\" \"Man, nobody wanted to see me and Drago fight. They wanted to see you and him fight! I knew that! You remember when you asked me if the fight was about something else besides the fight. I wouldn't answer you, but you were right. I thought that if I could whip that boy in an exhibition, they'd look at me as a legitimate challenger to you. Then I'd fight you, get my belt back, and go out on top, like I was supposed to! But I was wrong.\" \"Obviously.\" \"You've been carrying around this guilt for over thirty years Stallion. Why? Because you didn't throw in the towel? If you would have thrown that towel in the ring, you wouldn't have had to worry about Drago coming after you, because the second I would have been healthy enough, I would have whipped your ass to Hell wouldn't have had it! I'm not mad because you didn't throw in that towel. If that was supposed to be it for me, I couldn't think of a better way to go then in that ring that night. You have no right or want to feel guilty about that. What I'm upset about and what you should feel guilty about is abandoning Adonis like you did. I never wanted any of my kids to follow me into the ring, but I knew Adonis would. And I knew that if he did, he'd find you and you would teach him the Eye of the Tiger and how to be the best and you wouldn't let anything happen to him. And man, you two were doing great. Won the Heavyweight Championship of the World. I'm looking down watching all of it with a smile on my face proud as a father can be and maybe even a little jealous too. Then you abandoned him, when he needed you the most. I want to know why Stallion? Rocky looked at Apollo uncomfortably. \"He was going to get hurt. I didn't want no part of that.\" \"You can bullshit a lot of people, but you can't bullshit me. You were scared. You know what, Adonis was scared too! And you let him down!\" Rocky bowed his head and began to cry. \"I'm sorry Apollo!\" Apollo placed his hand on Rocky's shoulder. \"I know Rock. I know. Now you got to make things right. You got to go to him. Let him know you're sorry. Let him know that you're gonna be there for him. He's not gonna let you back in so easy. His girl will. Maryanne will. But he won't. You're pretty high on his shit list right now. You hurt him. Maybe even more than the Russian did. You're going to have to give him sometime before he lets you back in \"Unc.\" He's going to fight Drago again. He has too! You got to make sure he's in the right place mind, body, and soul! You got to get his mind right! You gotta make sure he fights this fight, for all the right reasons. Not for me, you, his girl, Maryanne, but for himself! He needs to be a man! Show him the way! Take him to school Rock! That's what I want Rock! That's what I need Stallion!\" \"Absolutely. You got it Apollo. I'll do it.\" \"One more thing. I need one more favor.\" \"I don't think we can fight again Apollo. I'm old and you're a ghost I think.\" \"Yeah that would be \"highly irregular.\" No this isn't from me. It's from her. Apollo pointed to a picture of Adrian. \"She wants you to make things right.\" \"What things?\" \"She said you would know what she meant. Don't make her come down here.\" The two old friends shared a laugh. Rocky glanced down then back up. Apollo was gone. Rocky grabbed the phone and dialed a number. \"Yo, this is Rocky Balboa.

He wipes his face the dry tears and he smiles when he sees his mother holding his daughter. \"Look who's here.\" She points to Adonis for Amara and she jumps out of her lap, running to her father as Mary Anne followed behind her. \"Daddy!\" She hugs his legs. \"There's my girl.\" He lifts his daughter in his arms and kisses her cheek. \"Where's mama?\" \"She's tired but she's awake so we can go see her.\" She sets her down and ran his head over her curly cheasnut brown hair. \"How are the babies?\" Mary Anne asked as she hugged him. \"They're both doing great.

I hope you enjoy! (I took a little bit of poetic license with the timeline as far as when Rocky and Adrian meet since I can' t recall it ever being stated?) Rocky laid awake counting the watermarks on the ceiling. He never noticed them before. Twenty-eight he counted. Where did they come from? The bed must be underneath an upstairs bathtub. Another thing he started to wonder… why was he thinking about the stains on ceiling tiles? Why now? He looked to his side and smiled at the sight. Adrian, snuggled at his side with her arm draped across his chest. She'd never slept this way before. Tonight she fell asleep close to her new husband instead of maintaining a certain distance. Rocky couldn't remember a time he'd been happier. First, he'd gone the distance with Apollo Creed. Now could go on and start a new life with Adrian. Everything was good now. Sure, fighting Creed came with some battle scars. Seeing out of one eye was more of a challenge than he liked to admit to aloud, and some funny colored bruises were still hanging on, but it was worth it. No longer would he be considered a bum. He made a name for himself. Not only did he manage to knock the champ down, he survived all fifteen rounds. Two things no one had ever done with Apollo Creed. From the minute the final bell rang to laying here now on his wedding night, most of his thoughts centered on Adrian. Aside from the first few nights in the hospital, he didn't think about the fight. Other people thought about it as he was reminded wherever he went, but alone, it was all about Adrian. He wanted to give her as much as she'd given him. Not once did he think about how fast their relationship moved. Rocky felt as though Adrian had been with him for half his life as far as the way he cared for her went. They'd known each other a while, sure. She was Paulie's kid sister. Sometimes he wondered why he stayed friends with the guy. His good moments were few and far between. Adrian started working in the pet shop about two years ago. Paulie told him the night before, thrilled to see her getting out of the house 'even for a few hours in the day'. Before then, Rocky never met Adrian – he barely knew her name. For Paulie's sake, he went down to the pet shop on her first day. Besides, he was curious. Paulie spoke so harshly of her, yet, something inside of him couldn't believe it was all true. She must be a nice girl if she's working with animals, right? The pet shop wasn't out of his way, either. It was right across the street from the gym. He'd looked in the window now and then. One room apartments get lonely after a while. Everything added up – he would get a pet and also help Paulie's sister on her first day. Adrian wasn't anything like he expected despite the fact he didn't have a specific image in his mind. He figured she was shorter like Paulie, but that was the only thing he'd assumed right. She wasn't ugly as Paulie would have him believe. He could, however, see why men might not be lined up outside the door to catch a glance. She wore thick glasses almost too big for her face. They seemed outdated, too. Her hair was short and black, which she kept pinned back. Her clothes, like her glasses, also looked outdated. If not outdated, then something an older woman might wear. If not older, a woman her age who was settled with a family and only left the house to run errands. Those things weren't so bad because anyone in their right mind could see how pretty she was underneath. Lastly, she was the quietest person he'd ever met. Paulie said she was shy, but Rocky figured she just didn't like to carry on long conversations. Poor Adrian couldn't look him in the eye. Noticing this right away, he was sure to do all the talking for her. He introduced himself, telling her he knew her brother. It was hard to tell if she knew his name before now. Deciding it didn't matter, he told her what kind of pet he was looking for. Pointing out the different animals was the only time her voice was audible. Even then, the words were mumbled and she kept her head down. She struggled even with this safe topic of conversation. By the end of the visit, Rocky went home with two turtles and a mission. He wanted to see Adrian smile. It goes without saying that Paulie is a hard guy to live with. No wonder the girl didn't say much. He added visits to the pet shop to his daily routine. He stopped by, told a joke or two, chatted with her on days she humored him, and eventually bought a fish to keep the turtles company. Soon enough, it became his favorite part of the day. Paulie didn't ease up on his sister. He continued calling her names and could say nothing good about her. Having met her now, Rocky felt even more drawn to her. He kept his deeper thoughts to himself for the most part. Without a doubt, Paulie would use this attraction against her in some way. Telling Adrian was also difficult, so he didn't – not in specific words. From time to time he'd suggest getting a slice of pizza or walking her home on a rainy day. Each time she shook her head. From any other woman, he would have taken the rejection personally. Two years later and the shy girl from the pet store was lying next to him as his wife. All day the word went through his mind. When he hit twenty-five he figured he wouldn't marry. A family didn't appear to be in the cards. Of course, it would have been nicer if his relationship with Adrian could have evolved without a push from Paulie, but at the same time, he figured maybe nothing ever would have happened otherwise. It's funny how life works out sometimes. Having Adrian in his life made facing Creed easier. She gave him a reason to fight and to keep standing even when his entire body wanted to fall down on the mat and stay there until the pain stopped. She made the aftermath better, too. She came and visited him every day while he recovered. She sat with him in silence while he rested. Something so simple meant everything to him. One of the last afternoons he spent in the hospital after the nurse came and told her visiting hours were over, she stood to say her goodnights. Thinking he was asleep, she bent down to kiss his cheek. She lingered a moment, pressing her nose lightly along his jawline and whispered something he couldn't quite make out. Maybe she just breathed against him. Either way, this was the moment he knew he was going to marry her. No waiting, no games. The minute his head was unbandaged and was given the okay to go home he'd propose. How, he wasn't sure. All he knew was that he couldn't wait. Adrian stirring in her sleep drew Rocky out of his thoughts. He turned his head to look at her, wondering if it would be okay to wake her up. He missed her voice. Until recently, he'd done most of the talking. The disease of being shy must have a cure, Rocky thought. Time, love, and trust. He was proud and thankful to be the one Adrian came to trust. It was all he wanted from the start. Sometimes he felt her slipping back to distrust, or maybe fear could be a disease as well. Earlier tonight she acted this way. She was scared she was going to lose him somewhere down the line. Why would she think about those things? Didn't she know she was the only one he'd ever been able to say he loved? Adrian moved again. This time her eyes fluttered open. Had she not seen Rocky looking down at her with a smile, she would have shut them again. \"Is it morning?\" she asked in a dry voice. \"Nuh, not yet.\" \"How long have you been awake?\" \"I dunno,\" Rocky answered as he turned onto his side. \"I kinda never slept I don't think.\" Adrian yawned. \"Is something the matter?\" \"Yeah.\" He smiled. \"But don't worry. It's all good, you know?\" \"Good.\" Rocky kissed the tip of her nose, waited for a smile, and then kissed her lips. Both of his arms wrapped around her and his head rested atop hers. He was glad when he felt her bury her nose in his neck and her hand tighten around his shoulder.

If it did, I don't think I would'a fought so hard or cared none.\" Eyes opened again, she pulled back to reach his cheek. \"I'm proud of you, Rocky. And I love you, too.\" The end.

Tommy hated being a white-trash loser, so he decided to make a name for himself by entering a local junior boxing competition. His first match was against a kid called Sugar Frosting. Tommy knew what he had to do to win, his strategy was flawless: punch the other guy in the face repeatedly until he falls over. Needless to say, Tommy won the fight by TKO in the 2nd round. Tommy fought his way through the contest, destroying all who dared to stand in his path, until he earned his place in the GRAND FINAL against the reining regional champion, Arnold McFist. Tommy ran home that night with all of the joy and geity of a lesbian schoolgirl. \"Mum! Dad!\" He squealed, \"I got into the finals of the local junior boxing tournament and next week I'm fighting the legendary Arnold McFist!\" His family were so disinterested that they could barely be arsed to show their slightest acknowledgement. Undeterred, Tommy continued, \"There's a $500 cash prize for the winner.\" At that very instant, old Grandpa Joe sprung out of bed like a Jack-in-a-box and broke into a song and dance number. After the little sing-along, Grandpa Joe leered over to Tommy, his breath stinking of fags and cheap scotch. \"Hey kid, I got a little proposition.\" He breathed, \"I'm gonna be your trainer! Which would of course entitle me to 80% of that prize money.\" \"Eighty percent!?\" Tommy shrieked. Grandpa Joe chuckled and stroked his scraggly chin thoughtfully before responding, \"You're right, kid. Better make it 99.9%. Can't be too careful, what with all the expenditures and whatnot... Training begins tomorrow at 3am!\" Reluctantly, Tommy did as he was told. Training commenced the following day as planned with tea and cake. This was followed by tea and cake, then some more tea and cake. Next, it was tea and cake time, which was marked by the consumption of tea and cake. After that, there was tea and cake. The training session was rounded off with some trampolining, after which Tommy puked up all the tea and cake he'd just eaten, so Grandpa Joe gave him another helping of tea and cake. Training went on like this until Tommy couldn't look at a slice of battenburg without shitting himself. \"Now you're ready, kid!\" Grandpa Joe rasped, punching the air with the arthritic vigour of a dead sloth. But Tommy didn't feel ready. In fact, he felt like dog poop and had developed a severely irritable bowel from all the tea and cake he'd eaten. Before the fight, Grandpa Joe made Tommy some tea and cake, and even fashioned him a gumshield made out of marzipan. Needless to say the fight didn't go very well. By round ten, Tommy had been beaten to within an inch of his life. He was fucked and knew he needed to somehow score a knockout to win. So, he draw on all of the strength from deep within his hillbilly soul and slung a massive haymaker at Arnold! Sadly, the blow missed by miles and the sudden exertion caused Tommy to shit himself. Arnold siezed his opportunity and connected with a ferocious hook that sprawled Tommy out across the canvas in a puddle of blood, sweat and diarrhoea. Grandpa Joe loomed over Tommy's battered, shitty body with a cup of Darjeeling in one hand and a Victoria sponge in the other. \"Don't worry, kid. With a little more tea and cake you'll be unstoppable!\" He assured. \"What a total cumsock I was to think that my certifiably insane grandfather could train me up.\" Mused little Tommy. But it was too late for wise words now - Arnold was the victor and Tommy had to look elsewhere to find a new trainer. His search took him on a weird and wonderful journey across the Multiverse, where he tried out many different boxing trainers from distant planets and parallel dimensions, until he eventually found the one man who could make him the champion he'd always dreamt of becoming. Who was that man, you ask? Heh, just watch Rocky V, my friend, and all will be revealed... ;P ... It was Rocky.

Jordan. He's a great actor and he did awesome as Apollo Creed's son, Adonis aka Donnie. When I saw the scene where his character Killmonger saw his father in Black Panther, I wondered what it'd be like if Donnie saw his father in Creed. Well, this is how I saw it. I hope you enjoy it. Adonis Creed, aka Donnie fell with a thud. His opponent, Ricky Conlan had just knocked him out cold, and now, he was in a dark room. Suddenly, a light came on and filled the room. Now, he could see glazed hardwood floors, a training ring, punching bags. He was in a boxing gym. Looking over to another wall, a banner hung that said 'MIGHTY MICK'S BOXING'. He was shocked at the sight of the place. It looked different. It looked old. Not as much space. Old punching bags, boarded floor with a few crack in them. 'Must've been before dey remodeled da place,' Donnie said to himself. \"You really did it,\" a voice said. Donnie turned towards one of the rings to see a man standing in the middle of it. His eyes widened at the sight of him. He couldn't believe it, but the man standing there was none other than Apollo Creed. \"Apollo?\" Donnie said as he slowly walked towards the ring. \"That's right, son. Looks like you've been havin' fun with the Stallion, huh?\" Apollo laughed as he noticed the marks on his son's face. \"Aw yeah, just um... Just tryina' make it the best I can.\" \"You're doing pretty good at that.\" \"I don't think so.\" Donnie said as he hung his head low. \"What makes you say that?\" Apollo asked. \"I'm worried.\" \"Worried bout what, son?\" Donnie hung his head once again. This wasn't something easy to do. To some, he was already viewed as nothing but a mistake. And he didn't want that to ruin his father's legacy even more. Donnie took a few breaths before confessing his fear. \"I'm afraid of losing and puttin' shame on ya' name.\" Apollo nodded in understanding. The times were different and rougher than they were when he was growing up. So it was easy to see how Donnie felt. \"Trust me, Adonis. Even if you do win this fight, you'll have brought more honor to my name than I ever could've done.\" \"What do ya' mean?\" \"Well for one thing, you've fought to get here. Both literally and figuratively.\" The father and son laughed at that. It felt good to be able to do this with his father, even though he was dead. \"But my point is, not everyone will look at the outside appearance of you. As some result of a mistake I made. Cause that's how some will see it. But others who're smarter will look at the inside and see exactly what me and Rocky have. And that's the heart of a warrior. The fire that powers you. The Creed spirit. And you sure as hell got it.\" This made Donnie think. He had more than his father's good looks. He'd been fighting, literally fighting his whole life for this. And he made it. And it was all thanks to Rocky, Apollo, Bianca, and of course, his mom. And he was glad to have them in his corner. Wiping away a few tears before looking back at his father. \"Thanks Pop.\" He said. \"Nah, its my pleasure, Donnie.\" Apollo replied as he hugged his son hard and Donnie didn't waste any time returning the hug. \"I love ya', son.\" \"...I love you too, Pops.\" \"I'm prouda ya too. Keep listenin' to the Stallion, he knows what he's talkin' about.\" Donnie nodded against father as they broke the hug with smiles. \"Now you gotta get back up there and finish this,\" Apollo said patting his son's shoulder. \"How?\" Donnie asked confusingly. Apollo chuckled as he held up his fist, signaling he had to be sent back the same way he got here. \"Eh, figures,\" Donnie said as he readied his jaw. \"Oh, and by the way, you look good in those shorts.\" Apollo laughed. Donnie scrunched his eyebrows in confusion. \"What?\" Before he could say anything thing else, he felt the fist connect to his face, sending him flying through the darkness and back towards the light of consciousness. Donnie gasped as he awoke. That punch his father gave him had felt so real, but it sure woke him up. It gave him an adrenaline rush to get up quickly as if he hadn't been knocked down at all. And he was ready once again. Ready to fight. ***After The Fight*** \"Adonis, I know you never met your father. But if he was here tonight, what would you wanna say to him?\" A reporter asked. Little did he know, that in a way, Donnie had met his father. 'If only they knew,' He said to himself. \"I'll just tell him I love him.\" He replied, \"And I know he didn't leave me on purpose. And I'm proud to be a Creed.\" \"Thanks, Adonis, and congratulations on a sensational performance.\" The crowd was going wild over Donnie victory. \"Creed! Creed! Creed!\" \"Go on, talk to them,\" Rocky said holding up his arm with a proud smile, \"Go on!\" Using whatever strength he had left, he raised his other arm in victory and pride. Know good and well that he'd earned the name, Creed. ***Rocky Steps*** As Rocky and Donnie looked out on Philly from top of the stairs, a feeling of relief passed over Donnie. A feeling of love from his surrogate father, Rocky Balboa. \"'Ey, thanks Unc,\" He said with a grin. \"For what?\" Rocky said, finally getting his breath back after climbing all those steps. \"For making all this possible. If Pops hadn't chosen you, you never would've met 'im. And I might've never met Mom, or Bianca, or you. You made all this possible. Thanks for bein' there for me.\" Those words made Rocky's heart soar. He may have already had a son, and he loved him dearly. But if he'd had another son, he'd be proud for it to be Donnie. And he knew Apollo would feel the same. \"It's alright, son,\" the Italian Stallion replied, \"Now whadaya day we go get some food? You're gonna need to bulk up with some nice meat, and I know a great place that has the best Philly Cheesesteak ever.\" \"Aight, I'm in!\" Donnie replied as he walked back to the van. \"Hey wait! Don't get in!\" Rocky paced himself as he slowly walked back down towards the van. \"Why not?\" \"I drive, you run alongside.\" \"C'mon, Unc. Really?\" \"Yeah, you're still in training. You think Conlan was fast, who knows how fast your next opponent's gonna be.\" As Rocky got into the driver seat, Donnie sighed heavily as he loosened himself up to get ready, remembering he didn't get a chance to last time. \"Aight, how far is this place?\" He asked through the open window. Rocky turned on the car with a smirk, \"Not too far,\" he laughed as he sped off. \"Ey no fair!\" Swiftly, Donnie took off to catch up. After a block or so, he was finally alongside the van, trying to keep up with Rocky. \"That was your next lesson, the element of surprise!\" The Italian Stallion laughed as he drove on. Donnie smiled as he ran, knowing that things were gonna get better and crazier as he and Rocky kept working together. So what do ya think, emotional enough? I always liked scenes in movies where the father is passing the torch to their kid. And I just had to do this. So I hope you guys enjoyed it. Plus, it's just in time for Creed 2. Should I make a sequel one shot where Donnie and Robert Balboa(Rocky's son) meet? Make like a family dinner type of deal? Lemme know, and I'll do it. Later guys! Ninja-boy OUT!

I love their chemistry. I love the message of the story. And I wanted to write a little sweet something. Adrian is a closed book and she really becomes herself in the later films but I always knew she was interested in Rocky. It's easy to see from the first film she just probably has her demons. Just like Rocky did. Reviews are like candy! :) It was another bland, ordinary day at the pet store. Arriving early I decided to clean up the loose containers and boxes from the deliveries made the previous day, the place was a mess but frankly I liked keeping busy. Anything to avoid small talk, pointless conversation with my boss or as many customers as I could. Anxiety had always affected me, right back from my Mother walking out on me and Paulie when we were kids. Growing up quick and fast, I skipped the usual girl things that girls did around here. I didn't stay out late. I never so much as went anywhere at night because of the house duties and taking care of Paulie. My interest in boys had been sort of stunted, not that I didn't have any sort of need, desire or dreams but it was always hard for locals and folk to chat to them because we were on such different pages. We just didn't relate. It isolated me further from the \"in crowd\" or cliques - they just didn't get it. I kept myself to myself and that was that. Of course I wasn't to feel too sorry for myself, I did have one or two friends but we weren't exactly close sisterlike ones. Shifting the last boxes, my eye catches a looming figure as I tilt my glasses to focus on it - I flushed slightly, my heartbeat raising a little higher than seconds ago as I rummaged up and deemed myself presentable in a tiny corner mirror by the counter. My gaze preened down as I thought I saw him coming in. He didn't. Embarassed, I shook my head knowing it was too good to be true. Ah, Rocky Balboa. A nobody from around here. He was good friends with my brother and I had known him for years. He was a boxer presumably a bum with no direction as he flirted with everything in town. As far as I knew, he had been under pressure and in depression for a while now. I felt bad for him. Mulling over today's newspaper that lays strewn across the table, I check my horoscope printed in a tiny section at the back and become giddy with anticipation. I wonder if Rocky was a Cancer. He was forward, but too sweet and sensitive for a fire sign. Romantic at that. Too interested to be an air, and too nice to be anything else. Every day he passed with a joke, my low self esteem and shyness must have always disappointed him, but he never showed it. He was clever at masking giving in, then again Rocky never gave into anything. He held his head high. From what I knew anyway. I listened to him every day and though I never so much as knew somebody like him, he was very similar to me; alone, wandering around without a real purpose, getting by. He just didn't know I took everything in. I hated myself sometimes for pretending to not care but I just didn't know how to come across being what he wanted me to be. He would crack a joke, say my name and look at me with heavy lids as he waited for my reaction and all I could do was look down and move away. On another note, his eyes were beautiful, he was real beautiful and I could understand the attraction from rumor around the street. My silly school girl ideas were foolish though. Why would he want to be around me so much was beyond my understanding. My little crush on him was silly, but he lightened up my days, my pointless day wasted in a job I didn't particularly like but I did care for. It paid the bills, helped feed us along with Paulie's own job at the factory but I had so much I could've explored in my life. Something more than just a regular Jo. At night when I cry myself to sleep, I wonder what might have been if I had never lost my parents, if school would've enabled me to get a real education and do something with my life, see the world that was other than Philly. oooo Walking home, the cold air making me shiver as I folded my arms. Who are you kidding, Adrianna, you aren't that smart. I really wasn't special. Having an exciting life was never really for me but I liked to pretend it was. I'm comfortable here and I can get by, I suppose. Having a family and not abandoning my children was a top priority for me and I weep knowing there was very little chance of it happening. Spinsterhood was here and it was long. \"Yo, Adrian!\" My heart skipped a beat as I glance down at my shoes, turning to the voice of the culprit. He stands with an anxious look himself, as if he is wondering whether or not to even bother me. He probably thinks I am stuck up. Please, don't. \"You okay? Need somebody to take ya home?\" I don't reply but nod gratefully. It's the most I can manage as he smiles at me, offering his arm to escort me and although my heart is so full it could pop out of my chest, I remain cool and collected. If only I could talk to him and tell him how I felt. \"You okay?\" He asks again with caution, his voice comforting in the dark crisp night. Comforting to my life. \"Fine.\" I mumble, avoiding his piercing gaze. He looked at me with such appreciation, intensity and yet patience. I'd never known it before. We pass a tiny ice cream parlour that's been hanging around the district since my late high school days; I used to hang with the girlfriends I had after classes, a melancholy feeling washed over me, what if Rocky had been kicking around here too? It gave her delight to think he could've been watching her even back in those days. She catches her reflection in the glass window, also catching herself...he would be hypothetically watching her pretty friends. \"Adrian, whaddya say we pull up here and have some ice cream sometime?\" Picking up her stride, she shrugged shyly instead of nodding in agreement. \"Maybe a Saturday. I work all day and they're closed at night.\" I further explain. It was most I had voiced to him since he saw me today. God, she hated herself at times. Rocky seemed pleased at the answer, he fidgeted with his hands and shot in front of me, walking backwards. \"That's great, Adrian! Hey, maybe I could get you one tomorrow and bring it 'round the store. What's your favorite flavour?\" Oh this was too much excitement for one night. There was an urge to not wanna open up more to mess up anything else, and wished my real personality could channel through, make what went on in my mind somehow verbal, and there was something about the man I'd love to impress. \"Rocky road.\" The words came out all husky but clear, and I was making eye contact with him. A slight chuckle escaped my lips before I darted my eyes back down and continued to walk; he laughed along with me, my sudden witty demeanour relaxing him and complimenting his own flirtatious nature. Who knew I was capable of such a thing? \"Huh, no kidding! I thought you'd be up for sumthin more like berry or vanilla. That tells me a lot about you, ya know, Adrian?\" My cheeks must have been the colour of berries . Bashfully scurrying to the gate leading to the house, time went by far too quick, and on the other hand, I could thank the Lord for finally arriving. \"Rocky...\" Suddenly hearing my voice as I lose control of myself further. He stops in his tracks, visibly surprised but eager to listen, his face bent down to mine and there was a twinkle in his eye. We've stopped walking and it's a little close. \"Thanks. See you tomorrow.\" I finish as we approach my door. My stomach flipped in excitement and nervousness. \"Hey, I'm just a bum, what else do I have to do?\" He laughs lightly, stuffing his hands in his pockets. Glancing away, uttering quietly a 'goodnight' and rushing inside, I took a deep breath. It had been chilly outside but the palm of my hands were matted with sweat. Okay, it was just a lighthearted joke of his but I knew and he probably knew there was much more reason behind it other than being available and around. I couldn't wait to see him again. Every time we talked, or just spent more than two minutes together, I could feel my walls falling down more and more. I saw over the shield, the insecurities I had. I saw a future. I saw him. I loved him.

I'm just borrowing. Only the story belongs to me. Note: I got the idea for this story a while ago and wasn't sure if it would translate well from thought to written form. It takes place after the beach scene in Rocky III, which I have dubbed, \"the tough love scene.\" \"H ow'd you get so tough?\" I chuckled a bit and said, \"I live with a fighter.\" Those words couldn't have been more true. I had to deal with a lot of crap in my life, mainly Paulie and the stuff he'd do when he got drunk. When Rocky and I got together, I learned to be tough and face any challenge head-on. Today had certainly a been a challenge to say the least. Apollo was determined to train Rocky to defeat Clubber, which was why he suggested we come out here. He had said this was where he had gotten his start and, judging from the atmosphere of the city, I could see why. There was no shortage of hardship and Apollo had risen above it all to be the fighter he was now. During the training, I noticed Rocky wasn't giving it his all. Yes, Mickey was dead, and yes, Clubber had humiliated him in the ring, but this was a very deep kind of hurt. He was here physically, but his heart just wasn't in it. There were times I wanted to tell Apollo to take it easy on him, but I doubted he'd listen, being the stubborn man he was. It was at the beach that I decided I wasn't going to stay on the sidelines and watch my husband go through what he was going through. I waited until we were alone and approached him. It took some coaxing, but I found out why he wasn't giving it his best – he was afraid. I tried to tell him there was nothing wrong with being afraid, but he refused to accept it and for the next several minutes or so, the conversation turned into a verbal fight, me against the Italian Stallion, both of us not backing down no matter what either of us threw at each other. Finally, things calmed down and I told him Apollo believed he could do this and so did I, but in the end, he was the one who needed to believe in himself. I guess he needed that much needed push from me, to put him back on the path he was straying from and show him that if he was allowing himself to continue down the road he was on, then it only proved Clubber was right about him being weak and that was something I didn't want. We Balboas were tough, and we didn't allow bullies to get under our skin, no matter who they were. I knew from this point forward, there would be no backing down. Our reputation, as well as the Championship belt, was on the line and with Apollo in our corner, there was no doubt in my mind or Rocky's that we'd take it back. Watch out, Clubber, I thought. You're about to get a taste of your own medicine. Note: I know this was short, but I couldn't think of anything else to add. This was my first Rocky story, so bear with me.

The dusky figure made peace with his gods and calmly limbered up in stoic preparation for the trials and tribulations that lay ahead. His name... was Apollo Cream! - The ultimate futuristic clone-warrior! Spliced from a dubious stain discovered on the late Apollo Creed's star-spangled shorts and genetically augmented with improved speed, strength and charisma. His personality had also been carefully tweaked with painstaking precision to make him more violent, less remorseful, and above all, a stark raving homosexual! With an explosion of multicoloured pyrotechnics, huge floodlights illuminated the ring to reveal our hero in all of his fabulousness, clad head-to-toe in a pink sequinned gown, top hat and feather boa. Tonight, this whirling dervish of dancing demolition would be facing up against the toughest opponent of his life... Now... silently making his way through the crowd like a hammerhead shark manoeuvring through a shoal of hapless mackerel, a towering mechanical humanoid approached the ring. Hailing from the Soviet Union... His name? Iron Drago! - A cybernetic organism constructed from pure low-grade communist steel! Designed by a genius scientist who once solved a Rubik's cube with minimal assistance. This great, hulking assembly of pistons, gears and little flashy buttons that went 'bleep-bloop' glared at his glamorous opponent. It was illogical for Apollo Cream to live, therefore he must be exterminated! This pugilistic spectacle for the ages wasn't taking place in your everyday, run-of-the-mill sporting arena. Oh no! It was located in a secret underground nuclear bunker on the moon. You see, situating the punch-up in such a remote location was the only way to ensure the safety of mankind when these two bad-boys started throwing fists! Spectators traveled from across the Multiverse to see the exhibition. In just one small section of the crowd, one could witness a Klingon, an Ewok and a Xenomorph awkwardly rubbing shoulders, and in yet another section, an interdimensional fractal elf was perched alongside a sentient amalgam of gaseous discharge born from the sphincter of a galaxy-devourer. Between these two otherworldly spectators, a crap sock puppet was comically eating buttered popcorn - It was a pretty diverse bunch is what I'm getting at! \"I must break you.\" Drago asserted from his cheap, monotone voice modulation apparatus. \"Change the station, Metal Mickey! You're about to get creamed!\" Quipped Cream, removing his dazzling pink gown to reveal an impressively chiselled physique. His torso was like an Italian Renaissance mahogany coffee table; intricately crafted and built to endure. If Drago had been fitted with an emotional simulator chip, he'd be experiencing some pretty conflicting urges right now. Cream inserted a cherry-flavoured gumshield into his mouth and gave Drago a cheeky wink. The bell sounded for round one. It's shrill clang resounded around the stark concrete caverns of the subterraneous bunker like the ominous wail of an air raid siren. How fitting. For tonight, bombs shall fall... Mused the sock puppet, spilling his popcorn all over the gaseous being to his left. The brawl that ensued didn't fail to live up to stratospheric expectations! The pair duked it out for fourteen intense rounds in cheesy montage fashion with 80's synth music and funky slap bass playing throughout. But no matter how spectacular the contest, there could only be one victor. And by the final round, Drago had worn his flamboyant opponent down, delivering a brutal right-hook to Cream's chops that dropped him unceremoniously to his knees. Bloodied and bruised, poor Cream looked up at the indestructible iron collosus that towered over him as it raised it's huge ferrous fist, preparing to unleash the final blow. Closing his eyes, Creed welcomed the cold embrace of death within his heart. In his mind, he was kneeling upon the shores of oblivion, gazing out into the impenetrable void of non-existence, which, like a black hole, began to draw him in, deconstructing his consciousness, unravelling his being into a spiralling stream of sub-atomic particles. Cream drew his final breath... Just as Drago was about to deliver the coup de grâce, a stocky little beast-man leapt from the crowd, grabbed the unsuspecting robot and hurled it out of the ring with impressive, animalistic strength. \"Cream, old friend.\" He snarled. \"It is I, Rocky Balboa. In this reality, I am a werebadger.\" Cream accepted his statement without further question. Rocky continued, \"Now there isn't much time, so just listen, okay? I have been studying Drago's digital blueprints in great detail and I believe I may have discovered a fundamental flaw in his mechanical defencive systems...\" But before Rocky could divulge any further info, the enraged bot had grabbed him by the scruff of the neck and slung him into the corner of the ring, where it proceeded to pummell the poor beast into a semi-conscious heap of bloody, matted fur. Rocky's distraction, though calamitous in nature, had thankfully allowed Cream sufficient time to regain his composure somewhat. Hey, laser dick!\" He hollered, struggling to his doddery feet. \"What is your primary directive?\" Drago responded \"To exterminate the one that is named Apollo Cream.\" At that, Cream triumphantly held his arm aloft and opened his gloved fist to reveal a pink, sparkly cube. It appeared to be a semi-precious jewel of some description, no bigger than a standard six-sided die. I have concentrated all of my mystical life-force energies into the materialisation of this humble cube. It is a pure, crystalline manifestation of everything that is Apollo Cream; both eternal and indestructible! This empty husk of a man which now stands before you will wither and die within a matter of minutes, but the essence of Cream will live on, in this lustrous artefact... forever!\" Drago froze, trying to analyse this new data inside his tiny thought-processing unit. \"Non sequitur. Illogical. No makey no sensey...\" He relayed. Without any means of achieving his one and only purpose, Drago was effectively obsolete, and according to robo-logic, must be self-exterminated! Drago's positronic brain started to malfunction and go all glitchy, so Cream seized his opportunity and wrenched the bastard's head clean off with a massive crowbar - an act which instantly disqualified him from the fight. But Cream didn't care about hollow victory anymore. He helped his wounded companion, Rocky the werebadger, to his little hind legs and the pair limped out of the arena to the rapturuous applause of an adoring crowd. Overcome with concern, Rocky turned to his friend and snuffled \"What about the crystal? Are you really going to die now?\" A cheeky smirk stretched across Cream's lovely round face, \"Oh, this crystal?\" He smiled, with a twinkle in his eyes. He swiftly tossed the pink gem high into the air and caught it inside his gaping mouth like a Venus flytrap. \"It's just a cola cube!\" The pair laughed heartily. Rocky coughed up a lung. \"So... what was this weakness you tried to tell me about?\" Questioned Cream. \"Oh, there's this big red OFF switch on Drago's forehead. I thought you could just press it.\" Cream froze in his tracks for a moment, intense thought furrowing his moistened brow... \"Oh yeeeaaah!\" He squealed, slapping himself on the forehead with the palm of his hand like an embarrassed schoolboy. The pair hobbled off, hand-in-paw, into the sunset. Apollo Cream and his fuzzy little sidekick would go on many crazy adventures together, overthrowing evil space dictators and charming many-tenticled alien damsels into their bedchambers. Rocky would eventually settle down with a young female wolverine called Missy and start a family, but Cream continued to wander the galaxy like a funkadelic space-samurai until the time came when he would transcend his physical self and become one with the Universe... He then opened a chain of sleazy gay bars and overdosed on poppers. The End.

But at the same moment she looked up and crossed his arms, shouted: – Now you're talking! A great way to avoid answering. Especially boxer. You could not stand five minutes with me, how are you going to confront him. You're crazy! With these words Mrs. Balboa returned to the bedroom and, throwing off his Bathrobe, crawled under the covers, turning away. She could not accept the fact that her husband agreed to the suicide, but the painful part was that he didn't need her protests. I wonder when he was ever going to tell her? At the last moment? Waved goodbye from the car? If not for these damn reporters who are not allowed to pass a poor woman, he would have remained silent? \"I understand him like no other, but he can't go forward with what it has. Many people live with pain you need to endure, to try to rebuild. Perhaps my words sounded quite harsh, but I say what I think. Rocky is a tremendous fighter, I have great respect for him and admire him, but now it is the most that neither is suicide. I don't want to be the Mary Ann. I don't want to mourn her husband. But Rock has always been stubborn, he never quit anything, and if I decided something, that's all. For this I came. Oh, yeah, that's his trump card. Of course, something I often began to forget who I am. Especially when you look at his fights. This sight is so nice that... Hell, for his information, I never forget that I am the wife of a boxer. And it hurts me too. It can be very painful. However, it doesn't matter. Who cares what I say? He will still make his own way. Weird little man logic. He had knocked all the brains, once he decided on it... And me too, if I can accept his choice.\" And yet she decided to wait for him and try to talk again, though somewhere deep down this woman approved of his choice, but was afraid to admit it to herself. Yes, any would be scared in her place. Wonder what reaction he was expecting from her, when just days right before her eyes lost their close friend. Died in the ring. \"Sorry I don't have friends with whom I could consult. Although...\" The next fifteen minutes she spent in the living room, talking to Mary Ann. In the voice of both was heard with tears, and she asked any way to force rocky to abandon this idea. What can she do? After talking easier still did not. It was even worse. They both got worked up at all the worst. \"Maybe leave it as is? I remember, years since nine years ago, I told him I didn't want to do this, but nothing sensible ever came of it. Coma, long recovery, permanent guardianship... don't want to\" Downstairs in the living room she sat for about an hour, and maybe even more, she even managed to doze off, but the robot didn't shut down the baby, woke the woman, saying that a tobacco-yellow teeth. It made its first wince, then smile. This thing will drive her crazy. But then she heard quietly closed the door. Perhaps rocky had hoped that she was already asleep, and that he will be able to avoid conversation. Although it is believed that it is wrong. But Adrian she wasn't going to talk to him, so, quickly back up, pretended that already asleep. Yes, it's her favorite chair, but this is not the case. As soon as she felt that lying in bed and rocky's arm carefully origaudio her with a blanket, immediately turned on his side, opening his eyes. – I'm sorry... but that's just me. You this out, Adrian. He said it quietly, knowing that she can hear him. – I know you don't sleep, I wanna talk to you. Look - he gently hugged her, trying to deploy to face him. – You want, and I don't want to talk to you and listen too, I won't. There is no need, I already understand everything. Pulling back, she wiped away a tear and closed her eyes, trying to go to sleep. But it is very difficult to deal with their feelings, especially when sleep takes over you up, especially at night. Completely without realizing it, she closed the distance separating them, which is what made rocky a smile and he hugged her. He wiped her face of tears and said that this is a fair sports match will avenge the death of his friend. Even if I have to die, although I really doubt that Adrian hears it. It is unlikely that she will go with him after all this time, but he really wish she was there. She woke up early and had already managed to disappear in the big house. All this time they did not speak, even at Breakfast Adrian tried not to meet the eyes of her husband. And if she is so hurt right now, when he's around, what's to become of her when she spends it in another country? \"Well, the baby is still sleeping, otherwise it would be hard to explain to him why we don't talk. Although it's still tiny, he would not have noticed.\" Taking his mug of hot coffee, Mrs. Balboa rose in his own little room, where she was often alone, to read, or simply to put in order their thoughts. \"Now it is better not to touch\" - that's what said to myself, rocky, when he helped Polly to take the Luggage to the car. A conversation with my wife actually had to postpone, because he had not yet said goodbye to his son. They talked for a long time, probably more than an hour, but as time went on. He looked down and still went to her, stopping in the doorway. Myself Adrian stood at the window and made it clear that he doesn't want to talk to him. – Well, you get it, right? – he wrapped his hands around her waist and put his chin on your shoulder. She just nodded, a tight smile. – Well, spare me the weary sigh, as necessary. Maybe you're still coming with me? I need you, I need your support. Why don't you? – I'm scared! I told you that I am also afraid sometimes? I imagine these attacks... I can't... the thought is killing me. – I'll be fine, I promise you! I'll come back alive and unharmed as possible. You might change your mind and go? - I'm sorry! You know I love you, but I won't participate in this madness. No. no. Never... He nodded and kissed her on the cheek. She went to see him, only watched from the window of the room. In their bedroom, on the nightstand, he left her a little rose and a little instruction how to get in touch with Tony, and in fact, with himself. After landing on a chair, the woman closed her face with her hands, no longer able to hold back the tears. She never allowed herself to cry, except that sometimes, and the reason usually does not happen, and then... The call of the son made her quickly wipe the tears and go to him to help with Breakfast. He still loves Breakfast chocolate cereal with milk. Only here Mrs. Balboa was not used to tell my son funny stories, just that rocky is doing much better. Sitting opposite, she looked at the mug, stirring with a spoon already cold coffee. – Dad's gonna win, right? What? And, Yes, of course. Of course, he wins. Dad is very strong, he can handle it. \"But I'm not sure of anything. After the death of Apollo, the theme associated with the ring, it was more painful\". Why'd you stay home? You always leave with him, not to worry and to help to train. So many questions, dear! I think this time I'll be better at home. Finish up and I'll drive you to school. \"It's been a month and I'm still not resigned to the fact that rocky is no longer with us. No, not only him, but Polly. I must admit I begin to miss his grumbling, and most importantly I am madly missed my husband. According to his slick jokes, on joint runs, which he taught me. With the baby we are alone. When I was struggling with trying to control myself, but after driving him to school... I Wonder how he's doing? How do you train? How does he feel? Is it good sleep? Our last conversation was not the most pleasant, but there's no way I wouldn't have to apologize, I didn't say anything. He needs to apologize...\". No loud talking, Mrs. Balboa wrapped in a blanket, put the book down on the coffee table and comfortably settled in his favorite chair in the living room. From the day of departure rocky she cannot sleep and mostly it helps for sleeping. Without it in any way. The nightmares and the pressure of her deprived of sleep, deprived of its productive day. She has to mask the circles under the eyes, to the son did not ask a lot of questions. At the weekend he pulled her with him into the room to see Boxing matches in the record, thereby siple salt in the wound. It's not a secret, the boy knew that his father was a boxer, and Adrian, though his hands and feet against it, but sometimes allowed his kid to watch these recordings. But it was extremely rare, and rocky were well shared her position. Covering his eyes, she actually began to fall asleep, but after a while called to her and she slowly opened his eyes, still not knowing what was happening. – Have you done your homework? – Yes! Calling you Mary Ann. I said you were sleeping, but she said that's not true and urgent. – Okay, right. – You can take up here. – Well! But then you shut off, as Polly put it, this walking trash can, otherwise I'll take her on a short circuit. Okay? Go. He waited until the kid disappears from the field of her vision, the woman coughed and picked up the phone, welcoming friend. – Well, how are you? You really worry me, Adrian. Maybe I should fly? And anyway, how much you slept over the last week? – I'm fine, despite sleeping very long. Thanks, of course, but to fly is not necessary. I want to go to him there. I can't do this anymore, you know? I kill my own thoughts. I too long selected between fear and support rocky. What do you think, is it right? You would go? Well, then I'll go. I know where they stopped. Rocky would like a quiet place... where... Where ... He was recalled... well, I thought about it. I'm going to fly. And I'll call you later when I'm ready. Are you sure you're okay? Look, I understand how you feel, but... – All right. I feel much better. Better than in the first days of his departure. And you can always come to us to somehow change the situation. This is hard for you, I know. The death of Apollo and for us a very painful blow. Thanks for the support, I appreciate it. I'll call you later. With these words, Adrian hung up the phone. Unexpectedly for herself, visited her mad desire and her, clicking his fingers, hurried upstairs. Rocky quit Smoking almost immediately when I started hard training, preparing for battle with Apollo, but I knew where in our house he hid the printed pack. She probably was laying there for any special occasions. Quickly slipped into the yard, she holds a cigarette in the mouth, clicking the lighter, knocking the light. This cigarette was first in her life, and as soon as her lungs began to get the poison, she coughed. Oh my God, how disgusting. How could he smoke it before? – Tobacco-yellow teeth! – was heard from our gift for Polly. – You're going to patronize me, walking dustbin? You gonna rat me to my husband, if I will not throw? She has made another demonstrative tightness, coughing again afterwards. – If rocky has set some specific settings, I'll give you a short circuit. Late at night when the baby went to bed, Adrian has calculated the time and tried to contact Tony via the same instructions that he left rocky on the nightstand. Everything was much simpler than it seemed at first glance. She told him that if it is not next to rocky, she'll simply go crazy. It will not be able to withstand such pressure different thoughts. Tony said he will try to resolve this issue and will contact me later. \"It's already visible to the naked eye, you can hear it in my voice – being here without rocky, I clocked myself at all the worst. I can't wait for his return just sitting at home watching TV. I am ready for any emotion, just to be near him. I remember that Apollo literally forcibly dragged me down the hall, when I copied the errors of the husband that it's all because of me. I promise that I will provide him with what he needs — your support. But how much can I expect this call? Need to get away. I'll make myself a coffee and look through old albums. Despite the fact that there are lots and lots of photos of our Butkus. How I miss that dog.\" Another week... it's been seven excruciating days, and finally the car arrived at the destination. This is the place. What was he doing here for a month? They probably all went nuts here. Adrian told me not to tell rocky about his arrival, determined to make him kind of a surprise. Tony met her on the porch, indicating that it is time, Rock was about to return from a run, but Polly just went out to get some air. She did not have a big Luggage, because it is not come on holiday. Duke had a small tour, showed her where to sleep. The pictures on the mirror caused the woman to smile. Later, Tony handed her a mug of hot tea, presenting a smile. – I'm proud of you! It was hard to make that decision, right? Yeah. It was hard, she took a SIP. – How is he here? How do you say... Normal. All of what he's going through real hell. Good that you came. And here he is. Look out the window, it's coming. – Go meeting! I hope he will be happy to see me. Smiling sympathetically, Mrs. Balboa buttoned up the jacket and went out on the porch. The distance between them rapidly decreased. \"I think I haven't seen him in forever. A month without it too. In every sense of the word.\" – I could no longer stay in Dali. I missed you! – Me too! I'm with you, and I will not leave you. No matter what! – No matter what? Adrian nodded, quickly reducing the remaining distance between them. She even sobbed, but his arms felt much calmer, and she never pulled away, allowing himself to kiss her. She really missed it. Now the workout will be easier. Giving her a kiss on the forehead, he whispered something in her ear and pulled into the house, saying that not only she knows how to make surprises. Now she will have to participate in training, and it pleased him even more. ","Summary":" She followed him with her eyes full of tears and sighed sadly.

I only made these moments the movie didn't show.* \" Have you ever walked alone at night, like a man against the world; no one takes your side. A boat against the tide, when your faith is shaken; you start to break and your heart kind find the worlds. Tossed upon the sand, I give you a man against the world.\" It was a cold night in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rocky Balboa was strolling along the cold, dark street where the pet shop was. He glanced inside the window and saw Adrian Pennino stocking animal food on the shelves behind the register. Rocky had liked Adrian for quite a few months now, he always told her his best jokes to try and make her laugh and she did, shyly. He sighed to himself quietly maybe Adrian was too good for him; he was friends with her older brother Paulie. Sometime he should ask Paulie one day to set him and Adrian up on a date or ask him if she likes him back. Rocky sighed once again \"maybe all I is a no good bum\" he had no friends besides Paulie, he had no siblings and his parents were dead. Rocky had no one in this world; he was a man against the world. \"All the people cheer til the end is near and the hero takes a fall. Then they'll drag you through the mud, you're only flesh and blood. Oh I've walked the path from dark to light and have yet come to terms. Alone I take my stand; I'm only a man against the world.\" Rocky fell to the ground when Apollo swung at him, knocking Rocky to the ground. He wanted to lay there and fall into unconsciousness from his injuries. In the split second of hesitation of getting back up he thought about his wife Adrian and his kid at home. Adrian would be disappointed if he didn't get up, he had to get up for her; he didn't want them to struggle, he didn't want to disappoint her anymore. Rocky got rose up, he felt like his brain and limbs were going to explode but he still got up after all he was a man against the world. \" But love! Like a distant reminder, it tugs at my shoulder, it calls me home.\" I shout! Can a single voice carry? Will I find sanctuary within your arms? Someday when the answer's clearer, someday when I even the score; you'll reach and you'll find me near you. Right beside you forevermore! But for now I walk the night alone like a man against the world!\" Rocky was awake in bed the night before he would fight heavyweight champion Apollo Creed. Adrian had her arms wrapped around his large, muscular form. He was scared to fight Apollo! What if he lost again? What if he made a fool of himself? He thought back to a long distant memory of Adrian before they had dated. It was a night that Rocky had faced a tough opponent named \"The Batarang\" he had beaten Rocky badly and Rocky's spirits were low. He had made only $19.00 for that fight, broken and bruised he dressed in civilian clothing and begun the lonely walk home. Rocky stopped at the pet shop on the way home and saw that Adrian was working, he walked inside thinking maybe her beautiful smile would cheer him up and lift his sad spirits. Rocky smiled when he was her nervously feeding the hamsters towards the back of the shop, \"Yo Adrian how's business been tonight eh?\" \"Fine\" she said quietly and continued to feed the hamsters. He sighed sadly, Rocky thought maybe one day she would be impressed by me if I was rich, had nice car, maybe she would be impressed with him if he was famous and evened the score. He hoped to be Adrian's one day, lying in her arms but today was not that day; he was alone. \"Alright Adrian I'll come back tomorrow and tell you some funny jokes okay?\" she nodded shyly in response. \"Goodnight Adrian\" Rocky said so quietly he wasn't even sure if she had heard him \"goodnight Rocky\" she said finally turning around to look at him, she smiled and he smiled in return. He turned to walk out of the pet shop saying goodbye to Butkus before he left. Rocky was now alone on this cold night, Adrian wasn't in his arms and wasn't even interested in him. Rocky had felt like a man against the world. \"A brand new day will shine through the avalanche of time. Now the road's grown long, but the spirits gone and the fire within still burns. Alone I take my stand; I give you a man against the world.\" It had been one year since his beautiful wife Adrian had passed away. One whole year Rocky had been all alone, he still felt his heart soar when he saw a picture of Adrian. He only wished he could hold her tight in his arms again, Rocky had spent many nights; lying awake in bed alone wishing it had been him instead of her. Rocky knew Adrian would be furious with him for thinking like that but he couldn't help it. He was alone again and a man against the world.

You are the strength that keeps me walking. You are the hope. That keeps me trusting you are the light to my soul, you are my purpose, you're everything.\" Rocky Balboa stared deeply into Adrian's eyes they were about to become husband and wife. He was so happy after all these years he finally had someone who gave him a piece of mind. Father Carmine read off the vows in Italian and they both said yes and I do and now finally he could kiss the bride. He looked at Adrian shyly and almost nervous almost how she used to be like with him. Adrian smiled at him as he lifted the white veil from her face and slowly placed it behind her. Rocky dipped his head down towards her lips and kissed her slow and sweet. In that moment that Father Carmine announced her as Mrs. Adrian Balboa, Rocky knew that she was the light of his life; his everything. \" How can I stand here with you and not be moved by you? Would you tell me how could it be any better than this? You calm the storms and you give me rest, you hold me in your hands you won't let me fall. You steal my heart and you take my breath away would you take me in, take me deeper now.\" Adrian walked out of the OB-GYN's office smiling and Rocky looked up and saw her huge smile \"Yeah?\" he said \"yes\" she said still having a huge smile across her face. Rocky smiled too, he was so happy he yelled \"Yo Adrian, you did it; I knew you could do it.\" This was a moment he would never forget. They walked home, holding hands and talked about the baby, what gender they that thought the baby would be, if the baby would be more like Rocky or Adrian. Their curious thoughts continued and a few months later on a beautiful, sunny day in Philadelphia; Rocky woke up and looked at Adrian and could see the most small, barely visible bump on her belly. He was surprised and immediately woke her up \"Adrian look your stomach\" he said in a deep whisper. Adrian opened her eyes slowly and then looked down towards her stomach and she too saw the small bump, her eyes filled with salty, wet tears and so did Rocky's. Rocky knew that this baby had already stolen his heart, just like Adrian when he first met her. \" And how can I stand here by you and not be moved by you? Would you tell me how could it be any better than this? Cause' you're all I want, you're all I need, your everything\" Rocky was about to walk out the front door to go to the Philadelphia Spectrum to face Apollo Creed but he wanted to say goodbye to his baby son before he left. Robert Balboa Jr. lay in Rocky's arms he stared into his father's eyes curiously. Rocky gently laid the baby back in his crib, kissed his forehead and walked downstairs and saw his beautiful wife standing at the bottom of the stairs. He was so glad she was finally out of the hospital but said the doctor wouldn't allow her to go watch him face Apollo Creed. Adrian smiled at him sweetly and he wrapped his arms around her small frame and he wanted to just hold her tight and never let her go. He kissed her passionately before he head to the front door to drive down to the Spectrum he thought to himself as his hand was on the door handle \"how could life be any better than this?\" \" You're all I want, you're all I need, you're everything, everything. And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you? Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?\" It was May 19th, 2001 and Adrian had not been feeling well the last few days. Rocky had eventually convinced her to go to the doctor and so she did and returned home about two hours later. \"Yo Adrian\" Rocky yelled when he heard the door open and shut \"how was the doctor's?\" Adrian walked into the kitchen where he was seated at the dining table. She slowly walked towards him and sat down at the chair next to him, her eyes were filled with tears and Rocky was truly scared for the first time since Adrian had been in a coma after she gave birth to their son all those years ago. \"I have some bad news Rocky\" she said her voice cracking with pain from holding in tears. \"The doctor ran some tests when I was there and I have ovarian cancer\" immediately tears fell down Rocky's face \"no, no your healthy, your perfect.\" She shook her head \"it has already spread to the outside of my ovaries; I have about 7-9 months to live.\" Adrian's tears she had been holding in fell down her cheeks; Rocky reached out his hand and wiped her tears away with his thumb slowly. \"We'll be okay Adrian we'll be okay, we'll get through this together\" more tears fell down his face and he couldn't believe his wife of almost 26 years had cancer that was untreatable. He looked deep in to her brown eyes and whispered so she could only hear him \"you are everything to me.\" \" And how can I stand here with you and not be moved by you? Would you tell me how could it be any better, any better than this? And how can I stand here with you and be moved by you would you tell me how could it be any better than this?\" It was the first time Rocky had been in the pet shop down the street from his house. He was looking for some pets to keep him company in his lonely apartment. He walked in to the pet shop quickly; glad to escape the freezing cold Philadelphia weather. He looked behind the counter and saw a girl, shorter than him, brown hair, straight, short and glasses, she wore a couple of sweaters but he didn't blame her it was freezing cold. Rocky smiled at the girl and she smiled back at him shyly. He thought to himself \"Damn that is the most beautiful girl in Phili even if she does seem to be suffering from a disease of being shy.\" He knew right then she was special and he tried his best jokes with her and she laughed in a cute, shy way. She sold him turtles, a bowl, a mountain and turtle food he walked towards the door of the pet shop with his new pets and toys for them in a medium size cardboard box. His hand on the door handle but before he opened it, Rocky turned around to look at the beautiful, shy girl to look at her one last time before he left. \"Yo what's your name?\" he said to her, she looked up from organizing the turtle food to respond to him \"Adrian\" she said quietly he smiled \"Yo Adrian, I'm Rocky, Rocky Balboa...\" \" Would you tell me how could it be any better than this..?\" It was Rocky's first time visiting Adrian's grave since she passed away 2 weeks ago on January 11, 2002. The house was quiet and lonely now that she was gone; Rocky missed her more than anything he had ever missed. He had cried every time he thought about her he hadn't been alone in 26 years. Rocky brought with him on his visit an old wooden chair and had planned to hide it in a tree near her grave. He loved how with Adrian everything always felt new after all these years. He sat in the wooden chair and just cried into his hands wishing somehow she would come back to him, but he knew deep down it was impossible. He hadn't spoken a word to her since he had arrived at the cemetery about two hours ago. After a few more painful sobs he finally spoke \"Yo Adrian I miss you and I love you so much.\" He slowly stood up and placed 26 roses on her grave, one for each year they had been married and he kissed the top of the tombstone. \"I love you Adrian\" he whispered to her grave one last time, he folded up the chair and placed it in the tree. Rocky started to cry again, he felt so alone and he would miss her, forever. ","Summary":" *I don't own anything except the details of this.

''hey.'' she says and kisses him ''hey sweetie.'' he says and kisses her back ''you guys have a good day?'' Torrance asks him ''yea really good and you?'' he questions her ''yea I did...so she's asleep huh?'' she question's him and see's Gabby asleep in the backseat in her carseat through the window of Aaron's car. ''naptime?'' she asks him ''yea she fell asleep on the drive over here.'' Aaron tells her ''drive?'' she question's him ''where you guys go?'' she asks him ''took her to the really big Mcdonald's with the really big play place and let her play as long as she wanted until she tired herself out and she had a ball.''

''I got"},{"Movie":"Rocky","Title":"Rocky-A Change of Heart","Author":"classicsfangirl2019","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13239870","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1 Boom. Ivan's gloved fist struck Rocky across the cheek like a hammer, and an excruciating clap of thunder sounded inside his head that made him sure he had broken something. His jaw, his nose, maybe even his brain, but how could he tell? Everything hurt. All of those thoughts whirled through Rocky's mind in the matter of a second, and before he knew it, he was sprawled on the ground, unconsciously but desperately grabbing at the ropes to pull himself up. He couldn't lose. Not to Ivan, for the monster had killed Apolla in cold blood. Apollo...a dozen emotions crashed over Rocky, and he fell back against the floor of the ring, overwhelmed and fatigued. \"Eight! Nine! Ten! You're out!\" The crowd erupted into pandemonium, but he could do nothing except lay motionless and wish he could fall into a darkness where he could feel nothing. He had lost; worse, he had failed to avenge Apollo. \"Adrian..\" The word was soft at first as it escaped his broken and bleeding lips, but it soon grew to a yell. Rocky couldn't open his eyes, couldn't move. He felt so helpless, and without Adrian's gentle hand gripped tightly within his, he felt himself slipping...slipping down, down into blackness. # \"Yo, Rocko. It's Paulie...can you hear me? It's okay if you can't but the doctor said you should be waking up any time now. You put Adrian and the kid through a lot, y'know that?\" At the mention of Adrian, Rocky somehow found the power within himself to surge up with a great gasp, only to fall back down onto the bed because his entire body was wrought with pain. \"I didn't train enough.\" He mumbled to himself. Paulie surged up in his chair, and through the blur of his vision, Rocky noticed the bags that appeared like bruises beneath his eyes. He had clearly been fighting, but with life and not in the ring. \"What was that, Rock? Hey, take it easy!\" Paulie exclaimed, concern written all over his face. \"I should've trained harder! I let down Apollo! I let down you and Adrian.\" Rocky covered his eyes with his hands as if it could shield him from the fight that he was reliving over and over again. \"Rocky...you did everything you could. You did exactly what Apollo would have wanted you to do.\" \"This time I'll beat him. I'll break Drago's smug face.\" Rocky whispered angrily, ignoring Paulie. His jaw throbbed, but his fury overpowered the pain. \"No. I've been thinking, y'know? Maybe...maybe we've been going about this whole thing wrong. Maybe we shouldn't try to fight Drago. Maybe...we should get to hear his side of things. Help him.\" Rocky's stomach dropped. Was this really Paulie talking? He slowly eased himself up, clutching at his ribs he knew were broken, and stared into Paulie's wide, nervous eyes curiously. \"What do you mean? Since when have you thought this, Paulie?\" Hesitating, Paulie shifted anxiously in his seat before answering carefully, \"I've done some thinking, Rocko. I think this is the best way to go about things. I, uh, had a change of heart.\" \"What kind of a change?\" \"I, uh, found the Gospel.\" Jaw dropping, Rocky could do nothing but stare incredulously, mind whirling. Paulie? His Paulie? Losing the fight must have been harder on him than he had imagined. \"That's...I don't know what to say to that.\" \"It's alright. You don't have to.\"[Chapter 2] Chapter Two \"What happened, Paulie? I didn't know he was lost.\" Rocky frowned, unsure of how to feel about his new change of heart. \"You know Ol' Father Mills? He left our Parish a couple years back.\" Brightening, Rocky scratched his chin, wincing when he accidentally touched his busted up lip. \"Yeah. He was a good guy. I remember him!\" \"Well, I was going to O'Leary's because well, y'know, after everything that's happened…\" Rocky nods reassuringly, and Paulie continues with a renewed vigor. \"I met him there. He was just sitting in the bar, and he started talking to me.\" \"I know I might be getting a little soft in the head, but this don't make no sense, Paulie! Why would he be drinking?\" \"He was drinking a club soda, Rock. Anyway, he told me that he left St. Mary's because he found Jesus.\" \"Paulie, that just doesn't make no sense!\" \"I know! I know! I didn't think so either!\" A dull ache began to pulse throughout his head, so Rocky just sighed in response. Paulie looked as if he had something else to say, but he was interrupted by someone flinging the door open. \"Rocky!\" The slurred and heavily accented name escaped the lips of none other than Ivan Drago, and Paulie gasped instinctively when he caught sight of the cameramen trailing behind him. \"What are you doing here, Drago?\" Rocky mumbled sluggishly, the pain growing worse by the second. \"I wanted to see how you were doing.\" Drago said with a sickly sweet tone, stopping at the side of the bed to throw a dazzling smile at the cameras. Rage suddenly raced through Rocky's veins, making his blood boil, and without hesitation, he ripped the IV from his arm, threw back the sheets, and leapt from the bed; hitting Ivan squarely in the jaw with his bandaged fist so hard that Ivan collapsed. Paulie shouted something indistinguishable, and the cameramen eagerly circled the scene like vultures. \"Get up!\" Rocky cried, the fight between he and Ivan obviously still tormenting him. As if on cue, Ivan stirred, blood dripping from the corner of his mouth. Rocky drew back his arm, about to deliver the final blow, but was stopped short when a sudden wave of agony crashed over him, and he dropped to his knees, clutching his head with his usually handsome face contorted with pain into something bestial. The pain...it was all he could think about; it was an all-consuming, all-powerful, burning pain that split his head in two, and Rocky wished he could fall back into the comforting depths of unconsciousness. \"Call a doctor!\" Paulie shouted, and the cameras panned in on Rocky, who was writhing on the ground with a low moan escaping his lips. \"Hey! Get out of here!\" Paulie shooed the cameramen, blocking Rocky with his body. To Rocky, it was as if nothing else was going on around him. He didn't know that doctors were swarming around him; he didn't see Paulie calling Adrian through tears; but before he could open his eyes, he was pulled down into the darkness again.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three \"Hey, Rocko! Look at the nerve of that Drago! His men put you on the news! Look at the crap they're sayin' about you!\" Rocky glanced up from the book he was trying to read and focused in on the TV on the hospital wall facing him. \"Turn it down, Paulie, I'm growing deaf here.\" Rocky complained as the pounding in his head worsened. Where Paulie did so, Rocky gazed, slack-jawed, at the video of him first knocking out Ivan and then collapsing himself. A broad smile spread on his face, and he said, \"Hey, Paulie! I'm on the news! Tell Adrian, would ya?\" \"This is bad, Rock! You look like a schmuck!\" \"Don't be such a...what's the word...pes-pessimist!\" Rocky straightened when Adrian entered the room, teary-eyes, and his stomach dropped. \"Yo, Paulie, could ya give us a minute?\" Although he grumbled under his breath, Paulie stood up stiffly and waddled out of the room, shutting the door behind him. \"Hey, how ya doin'?\" He said in an attempt to be cheery to Adrian, noticing the red around her eyes. \"I heard. I heard about the fight. I heard that you have permanent brain damage. Did you not think to tell me? To tell your son?\" Her voice shook, but Rocky couldn't tell if it was from sadness or anger. \"I'm sorry, Adrian. I just didn't want you to worry about me.\" Rocky said sheepishly, looking away. \"Did you see the news? I mean, come on, Rocky! How could you? Not only did you embarrass yourself, but you embarrassed our family. You hit someone who was trying to help you on National television!\" Rocky felt defenseless against her accusations. Each word hurt worse than a blow from even Ivan, and he just gazed imploringly at Adrian. \"You know I don't want to hurt ya none! I love you!\" Her lower lip trembled, and she seemed to be torn. Running a hand through his jet black hair in frustration, Rocky cleared his was he supposed to do? After a moment, Adrian approached and unexpectedly reached forward to put her hand on Rocky's cheek, meeting his dark eyes tenderly. \"Rocky...I love you. I always will. But I can't do this anymore. I can't sit around and watch you destroy yourself. Destroy our family. Everything has to be a fight for you. You always have to prove yourself. I'm going to be gone for a little while. I'm taking Robert with me.\" \"No, Adrian, please, I need you now more than ever!\" A tear slipped down her pale cheek, and she turned around, clutching her purse tightly against her chest. \"I'm sorry.\" With that, she left. Unable to think, to breathe, to move, Rocky gaped at the spot where Adrian had just been. What had just happened? How had he let this happen? A strangled cry escaped his lips, and a lump formed in his throat. He couldn't do anything right. His heart...was so empty. So cold. Where had everything gone? His fighting career, Adriana, his son. With only anguish in his head, in his heart, Rocky rolled out of his bed, ignoring the massive headache that began plaguing him, and began running in his hospital gown. He ran out of his room, through the halls, past rooms that flashed before him, and up stairs. More stairs and more stairs until he was outside on the roof. When he finally stopped, listening only to the furious pounding of his heart, Rocky let out a cry of misery and pain. His life was over. What else did he have? Paulie? Fighting was over. Mick was dead. Adrian had left. He staggered to the edge, where he just sat down; sat with his legs dangling over the side of the building that was more than ten stories tall. The dots rushing by were cars. No one was stopping to look up at him. Noone cared. He shouldn't have to care either; he didn't have to feel anymore; face anyone. \"Yo...Rocko! I say you running down the hall! What-what are you doing up here? You should be in your bed!\" He recognized Paulie's panting voice immediately, but didn't respond. \"Can I come over? Is it okay with you?\" Rocky nodded numbly, still staring forward. \"Why don't you come back over here with me?\" \"Why? Why should I?\" Rocky burst out, his words slurred with emotion. \"What do you mean? I just don't want you to get hurt!\" Paulie's voice went higher and became more grating as his desperation grew. \"It doesn't matter if I get hurt, Paulie! Can't you see that? Everything's gone!\" \"What's gone, Rocko? I care!\" \"Adrian! All gone! All gone! What have I got? Nothing!\" Paulie closed his eyes, his lips moving as if silently in prayer, before sitting beside Rocky with confidence. \"That's what I thought, too. But now I know I got God.\" Sniffling, Rocky squared his shoulders. \"What about him?\" \"You said you lost everything. But not him.\" \"Then why did he make Adriana leave?\" \"It's all for your good, Rocko. Just...please don't do anything you'll regret later.\" Scoffing, Rocky swiped at his cheeks with the backs of his hands. \"My good? I just don't know anymore, Paulie! I just don't know.\" Slumping over, Rocky tried to convince himself internally that God loved him. But how could he know? He messed up. \"Why don't you just come down so we can talk about it?\" Paulie's hand was gentle on Rocky's arm; an unusual occurrence between the two. Somehow, it worked to calm Rocky down so that although his chest still heaved with labored breaths, he nodded and wearily stood to retreat from the edge. \"You make me go nuts there for a second, Rocko.\" Paulie said, relieved that he had managed to diffuse the situation.

That was the only thing going through Natalie Goldmill's mind as she wrapped herself up in a blanket from one of the paramedics, staring off into the distance with the sharp, intelligent blue eyes that she had gotten from her grandfather. She pulled her knees up to her chest as she stared blankly at the cluster of paramedics before her, swallowing the spit accumulating in her mouth. Natalie glanced at her watch, squinting to see the time. 10:37 PM. Man, it was earlier than she thought, way earlier. Natalie and her grandmother had been driving when her grandmother dozed off at the wheel, veering off the road and crashing into the sidewalk. Coincidentally, her grandmother woke up the moment before they crashed, and immediately began to yell at Natalie for Lord knows what. Even with a good chance of dying, she found the time and the energy to scream at the teenager, and Natalie couldn't help but let out a dry, humourless chuckle. \"Miz?\" Natalie looked up, her glasses slipping off the bridge of her aquiline nose. Apparently, she'd been re-named 'miz', which she didn't entirely mind. \"Yeah?\" she replied, furrowing her brow at the ruddy-faced paramedic. \"The ambulance is ready for you,\" he said, beckoning her forward, then holding out his hand. Natalie blinked. \"Oh- oh, okay,\" she stammered, slowly standing up. Her footing was tremulous and unsteady, and she started to tip over. \"Woah, woah, woah,\" a deep, slurred voice called, and before Natalie knew it, she had fallen into a pair of arms instead of collapsing onto the South Philly streets. \"You alright?\" the voice asked, and Natalie recognized it immediately. She looked up at the man holding her, her eyes wide and surprised. \"Mr-Mr. Balboa?\" the teenager stammered, drawing in a sharp breath as she stared at the tall Italian. Rocky nodded, and gave Natalie a lopsided grin. \"You got a good memory, kid,\" he replied, easing her back on the bench. Rocky turned around to look at the cluster of paramedics, firemen, and policemen surrounding the car. He looked back at Natalie for a moment, his lips slightly parted. \"Natalie…\" Rocky stood up, walking over to the cluster, a certain confidence in his stride. \"Yo, what's goin' on?\" he shouted, immediately drawing everyone's attention to him. Considering he was arguably the most notorious person in the neighborhood, it was difficult to ignore him. \"Car accident,\" one of the paramedics nonchalantly called out. \"We got a body, here.\" \"Well…\" Rocky turned back to Natalie for a moment. His brow was furrowed, and his eyes were filled with concern. \"Well, where's she gonna go? Tell me,\" he demanded, anger and fear bubbling up in his voice. \"That's up to social services, sir. If she ain't got no other family, off to foster care she goes,\" the paramedic replied, giving Rocky an apathetic shrug.\"Will you let her get in the ambulance, now?\" he demanded, an aggravated edge to his voice. \"Come on, Miz, let's get going,\" another paramedic said, taking Natalie by the elbow. The ginger nodded silently, defeatedly, getting into the ambulance as an EMT shut the doors behind her. The ambulance drove off into the night, flashing lights and all. Rocky sank down on the bench that Natalie had sat on just a moment before. He buried his face in his hands and let out a deep, defeated sigh, shaking his head. God, the poor girl was going to be thrown away into foster care and completely forgotten about… shit, she was just a kid, and she had to deal with this! Her future wasn't going to go anywhere, was it? Not in foster care, it wasn't... \"Sir, you alright?\" one of the paramedic called towards Rocky, a genuine concern apparent in his features. The tall Italian closed his eyes, letting out a tremulous breath before standing up from his seat on the bench. Without giving a second glance to the chaos behind him, Rocky began to walk, thoughts of Natalie swirling through his mind. He felt absolutely powerless, not only that, but disgusted with himself. He had made a promise to Mick, all those years ago, to protect Natalie, and he had failed. 'When I die, you protect her, and you protect her good. Don't make me haunt you, now,' Mickey had said, jabbing his finger in Rocky's face. He had spoken those words countless times, and to this day, Rocky could remember them verbatim. Well, he was in for a few wide open cupboards and upside down crosses, because he certainly hadn't done his goddamn job. The tall Italian violently shook his head. He had to stop dwelling on the past for a moment, he had a family to get back to, he had a certain brother in law to fetch from the bar. He'd worry about Natalie later, as much as he hated to do so. \"Come on Paulie, let's go,\" Rocky said, opening the door to the bar and roughly shaking his brother in law by the shoulder. The drunken man sluggishly shook his head and moaned something unintelligible to Rocky. Rocky let out a loud sigh, grabbing Paulie again. \"I said let's go, Paulie,\" he snapped. Having to drag the balding man away from the bar night after night was getting tiresome for Rocky; doing that nearly every day for years was truly starting to get to him. Rocky was just about to give up, roll his eyes, and leave, making Paulie the bartender's problem, when Paulie slowly got off the chair, taking another swig of beer before setting it down on the bar. \"Alright, Rocko,\" he mumbled drunkenly, tossing a ten dollar bill at the bartender before the duo walked out. Huh. Took a lot less effort than usual, Rocky silently mused. \"Yo, uh…\" Rocky momentarily paused, moistening his bottom lip as he debated saying something to Paulie. He doubted the stout, short tempered man would have anything to say, but… \"You remember Natalie?\" Rocky asked, lightly elbowing his counterpart in the side. \"Natalie who?\" Paulie asked nonchalantly, opening up his flask and taking a gulp. \"Y'know, Natalie. Mick's granddaughter,\" Rocky replied, nudging Paulie again. \"You gotta remember, now,\" Rocky insisted, taking off his fedora. \"Yeah, I remember. So?\" Paulie sluggishly replied, screwing the cap back on his flask nonchalantly. Rocky paused for a moment, unsure of what to say. Paulie glanced at his brother in law, arching an eyebrow inquisitively. \"Rocko?\" \"She… she was in a car accident,\" Rocky mumbled, shoving his hands deeper inside his pockets after placing his fedora back on his head. \"She made it, but, her granny didn't,\" he continued, letting out another tremulous breath as he continued to walk with his brother-in-law. \"Old lady Goldmill? Ain't nobody's gonna miss her, Rocko,\" Paulie said with a laugh. \"Remember them two? Mickey and Evelyn and their world class screaming fights? You could hear 'em in Jersey!\" \"Paulie, relax,\" Rocky groaned. The last thing he wanted was to deal with another second of Paulie's nonsense. Rocky opened the door to his home, ushering Paulie in. Adrian stood in the kitchen, drying off a dish before she placed it in the cupboard. \"Yo, Adrian, we're back,\" Rocky said, taking off his fedora and coat and tossing them on a nearby chair. Paulie shuffled off back to the depths of hell, or wherever he came from, leaving the couple to themselves. \"Was bringing him home much trouble?\" Adrian asked quietly, turning around to face Rocky. The tall Italian silently shook his head, leaning against the table. \"Adrian, do you remember Natalie?\" he asked after a moment. Adrian turned around, clasping her hands in front of her waist. \"Yes, yes, I do. I always wondered what happened to her,\" the brunette softly replied, beginning to wring her hands as her brow creased with worry. \"Did something happen?\" Rocky grimaced. \"She was in a car accident. She made it, her granny didn't. She's goin' into foster care, Adrian, I don't wanna think about what's gon' happen to her in there…\" The retired boxer's voice trailed off. He ran a hand through his curls, letting out a deep sigh. Adrian walked over to her husband, sighing softly she rested her head on his shoulder. \"I'm sorry, Rocky,\" the brunette muttered as she slowly pulled away. \"Poor girl. Lost her mother, then her grandfather, and now…\" Adrian let out a tremulous breath. \"Is there anything we can do?\" the petite woman asked, tilting her head to the side. Rocky shrugged defeatedly, letting out another sigh as he leaned over, kissing Adrian on the forehead. \"I don't know,\" he muttered. \"I don't know.\" Rocky made his way downstairs, calling out \"Kid?\" as he stepped into the basement. Sure enough, Robert sat cross legged on the bed, gnawing on a pencil as he stared at the piece of paper before him. \"Hey, dad,\" the teenager deadpanned, setting the pencil and paper down on his nightstand. He was no longer the rail thin, naive, pale-faced thirteen year old that he had been when he first came to South Philly. He had become tougher in the past two years, yet he still hadn't taken much of an interest in fighting. Art was what he loved, and that wasn't going to change any time soon. \"How you doin', kid?\" Rocky asked, plopping down next to his son and planting a soft kiss on the side of his head. Robert shrugged, giving his father a small smile. \"I'm okay.\" Rocky paused for a moment, unsure of how he should phrase his question. \"Um..\" Rocky moistened his bottom lip, looking away briefly. \"You remember Natalie? Mick's granddaughter?\" he asked, running a hand through his curls. \"Yeah, I go to school with her,\" Robert casually replied, shifting his weight on his bed. \"We talk every once in a while. Why?\" Rocky suddenly pulled away from his son. \"You do? Why didn't you tell me?\" the Italian said angrily, moving away from his son. Robert moistened his bottom lip, turning away from his father's gaze. \"I did, last year, but you were… busy.\" Rocky immediately felt the tension in the air get thicker. Tommy Gunn was still a sore subject for the family, he had nearly torn Rocky and Robert's relationship to shreds. Of course, it had been nearly a year since he went out of their lives, but the mere mention of him made Robert upset. \"Yo, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring nothin' up,\" Rocky said gently, putting a comforting hand on his son's shoulder. Robert slowly shook his head, letting out a humourless chuckle. \"That's okay. Why'd you ask?\" Once again, Rocky was unsure of what to say. It had been a habit for him lately, well, for the past couple years. Still, he had to find a way to muster up the words… \"Natalie was in a car accident.\" God, that must have been the third time he uttered those words in the past twenty minutes. Rocky could hardly understand it himself, he still thought of Natalie as a little girl, not a teenager, not someone who had just evaded death by the skin of her goddamn teeth. \"She made it, don't worry,\" Rocky said reassuringly. \"Mrs. Goldmill, on the other hand… not so lucky,\" he said with a grimace, shaking his head and letting out a sigh. \"Listen, kid, if you see her at school tomorrow, tell her 'hello,' give her our number, tell her if she needs somethin', we're here. Okay? Can you do that?\" Rocky asked, clapping his son on the shoulder. Robert moistened his bottom lip, nodding as he briefly looked away from his father. \"Yeah, I'll do that, no problem.\" \"Yo, kid.\" Rocky could practically sense what his son was thinking. Lightly hitting his son on the shoulder, he said, \"Hey, come on, it ain't like she's gonna be living with us,\" the tall Italian said with an uneasy laugh. \"Just…tell her everything's gonna be okay. Please? For me?\" Robert nodded again, raking a hand through his hair with a small smile. \"Okay.\" Rocky gave his son another smile before planting a kiss on his forehead. \"Goodnight,\" he said softly, patting his son on the shoulder once more before walking upstairs to the room he shared with Adrian. The lights were already turned off, and Adrian had long since crawled into bed. Rocky laid next to the petite brunette, lazily removing his gray sweater and tossing it off to the side. He casually wrapped an arm around her, just as he had done so nearly every night for fifteen years. His mind would not let him rest. If there was an afterlife, Rocky was sure Mickey had put some sort of hex on him by now. No matter how illogical it was, Rocky couldn't help but blame himself for Natalie being involved in a car accident, and he desperately wished that there was something he could do. Natalie's grandmother had cut off all contact with the Balboas after Mick's death. The woman had become a hermit, nobody had seen her in years. Natalie came and went, of course, according to people in the neighborhood, but her grandmother was practically off the grid. Rocky had heard countless rumors, including that Mrs. Goldmill had died and Natalie was somehow running a household herself. He found the idea completely egregious, of course, and couldn't help but scoff at the mere thought of it. \"You alright?\" Rocky nearly jumped in surprise before he realized that it was Adrian who had spoken. \"Yeah, I'm okay, just thinkin',\" he muttered, moistening his bottom lip. \"About Natalie?\" the petite brunette said knowingly. \"Yes,\" Rocky muttered, turning around to face his wife. \"I don't know what's gonna happen to her,\" he said softly, letting out a tremulous breath before resting his cheek against his wife's. \"Oh, sweetheart, neither do I. All we can do is hope. You told Robert to tell her hello when he sees her again, right?\" Adrian asked, giving her husband a gentle, comforting pat on the shoulder. \"Yeah, you're right, all we can do is hope. I told the kid to say 'hi', we'll see what happens,\" Rocky mumbled, planting a kiss on Adrian before he rolled over in bed, resting his head against his pillow before closing his eyes. The tall Italian drifted off into a deep, dreamless sleep after nearly another hour of meaningless pondering.[Chapter 2] Before this chapter begins, I'd like to say that I do not own the Rocky series, nor any of the characters other than Natalie, her grandmother, her mother, Dr. Johnson, Ms. Mark, and Natalie's future romantic interest… wink wink! I will not be making any profit off of this fanfiction. I'm aware that this chapter is very long, but nevertheless, I hope you enjoy it :) \"Alright, Natalie, other than the gash, you're perfectly fine!\" The doctor's voice wa unnnecessarily jovial for the occasion, and the bright, beaming smile accompanied with it was equally unnecessary. Natalie shrugged nonchalantly, took a swig (yes, a swig) from the juice box she had been handed earlier. \"Nice. Good to know the gash on my forehead and the lack of a safe place to stay are the only two things holdin' me back from success,\" the ginger remarked drily, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. Dr. Johnson, a thin, brown-skinned young woman, let out a hearty laugh, lightly hitting Natalie on the knee. \"Oh, you're such a joker. Social services should be here any minute now, dear.\" Natalie slowly nodded, letting the words sink in. \"Right. Social services, goin' to take me to some hellhole. Fun,\" the sullen redhead muttered, running a hand through her hair. \"Oh, honey, don't be like that. I'm sure your next of kin will take care of you, don't worry,\" Dr. Johnson said enthusiastically, patting Natalie on the shoulder. Natalie arched a blood crusted eyebrow. \"What next of kin? My pops was never around, my mama's been dead for twelve years, my grandpa's dead, my grandma's dead, and I doubt I got any long lost aunts or uncles beggin' to take care of me.\" Dr. Johnson stood there silently for a moment, unsure of what to say. The moment she opened her mouth to speak, Natalie heard a knock on the door, and before either of the two could respond, a short blonde woman opened the door and stepped into the room. She wore a painted-on, ruby red smile that was as fake as can be. \"Hello, Natalie, I'm Helen Mark, I'll be taking you over to the Balboa residence tomorrow afternoon,\" the woman said, moving slightly too close to Natalie's hospital bed. Mother of God. Natalie must've gotten a busted eardrum and a concussion to match, because there was no way in hell she had heard this lady correctly. Goddamn. Balboas? She was going to live with them, of all people? It wasn't like they were serial killers or something (well, at least Natalie hoped not), it was just that she didn't know them all that well. She had heard about the entire fiasco with Tommy Gunn about a year ago, and she doubted the Balboas would take kindly to another stranger invading their space. \"Uh…\" Natalie's mouth went dry. \"The…no, you ain't gotta do that,\" she said with a humourless chuckle and a forced, awkward grin. \"They're now your legal guardians, Natalie. Your grandmother appointed them in her will,\" Helen smoothly replied. Natalie didn't bother to ask how she had gotten access to her grandmother's will so quickly and easily, the thought never seemed to cross her mind. \"I…\" Natalie was at a loss for words. Her hands began to shake and her mouth went drier than it already was. Her heart began to race, and she let out a tremulous breath, running a hand through her hair. \"Okay, I… so, my granny's dead,\" Natalie stammered, moistening her bottom lip. Both the social worker and the doctor nodded in sync, neither of them placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. She was dead. Doris Goldmill, the one and only, was dead. Natalie no longer had to tolerate her constant rage fits, her relentless insults, her hair-pulling and face scratching. She never had to lie through her teeth to every social worker that made their way over to the Goldmill household, ever again. She would never have to- Before Natalie could finish that thought, she buried her face in her hands, bursting into tears. She felt every emotion on earth simultaneously, but oddly enough, she couldn't pinpoint a single one. Wait a minute. Shouldn't she be crushed, depressed? Unable to go on, completely and utterly devastated? She wasn't. She didn't know how she felt, but she certainly wasn't howling with unbridled grief over losing Granny Dearest. For a moment, only a moment, guilt burned into Natalie's soul. But then, she remembered. DECEMBER 27TH, 1989 \"You know, honey, I feel pretty bad for you. Sellin' yourself to get your granny cash ain't no way to celebrate your 13th birthday,\" Marie said, vehemently sharpening her nails, a cigarette dangling out of her mouth. Her hair, a tousled, dirty blonde mess, was piled up on her head in something that could only be described as a rat's nest. \"Uh-huh,\" Natalie deadpanned, eyes wide open beneath thick glasses, back pressed against the brick wall, hands trembling uncontrollably. That was all she had managed to say ever since her grandmother nearly shoved her out the car, hollering at her to ask the nice lady at the wall what to do. \"So, you already know what to do, right?\" Marie asked, stomping her cigarette out with her heel. Natalie opened her mouth to speak, but before she could get out a reply, she heard a yell. \"GET OFF MY PROPERTY!\" the voice screamed. It belonged to a stout, short man sporting a fisherman's hat and a filthy jacket, holding a baseball bat with both hands. \"Oh, honey, let's go over to the Atomic Hoagie Shop, there'll be customers there,\" Marie said with a sluggish groan, grabbing Natalie by the arm. The man's expression suddenly changed as he saw Natalie's face, and he reached out to touch her on the sleeve. \"Yo, ain't you-\" On impulse, before the man could finish his sentence, Natalie shut her eyes and let out a horrible, blood curdling scream that was loud enough to wake the dead. Immediately, she ran, nearly knocking over Marie as she sprinted away. After a minute or two, Natalie stopped, letting Marie catch up to her. The two were both out of breath, and Marie leaned against another brick wall, panting for nearly another minute. \"You know, honey, you better stop doin' that,\" Marie said, letting out another exhausted pant before she walked away with Natalie in tow, grabbing her by the elbow again. DECEMBER 29TH, 1991 - \"You okay?\" Dr. Johnson said softly, her voice smooth and silky. Natalie nodded, moistening her bottom lip and adjusting her glasses. \"I'm good,\" was her short, clipped reply. \"Alright, Natalie, I can tell that you're exhausted, I'll be leaving soon. Here's my card, call in the morning. I assume you're being kept overnight, is she being kept overnight?\" Ms. Mark asked Dr. Johnson, arching her eyebrows inquisitively. \"Yes, she is,\" the dark-skinned woman replied, nodding somberly. \"Alright, great. I'll see you soon, then,\" Ms. Mark said to Natalie, giving the ginger a small smile before exiting the room. \"Natalie, I'll see you in the morning, hon. Here's the remote control to the T.V if you'd like to watch anything. Goodnight, kiddo,\" Dr. Johnson said, brightly smiling at Natalie before closing the door behind her. Natalie let out a breath that she didn't know she was holding in before getting up to switch off the light. Her hands were trembling as she climbed back into bed. No, scratch that. Natalie's entire body was trembling as she laid her head on the pillow, and for just a moment, she was once again that innocent young girl, hanging out on a street corner waiting for someone to come by. God, she just wanted to crawl into her own skin. Natalie shut her eyes, desperately trying to clear her mind of every thought she had before she finally drifted off to sleep. DECEMBER 30TH, 1991 Natalie sat in the backseat of Ms. Mark's car, arms crossed, chin against chest, dozing off. Once they arrived in front of Natalie's old house, the ginger woke with a start almost immediately. She lightly hit the side of her face to wake herself up, letting out a tired groan as she hopped out the car. \"Natalie, do you need this?\" Ms. Mark said, tapping Natalie on the shoulder, holding out a garbage bag. Natalie shook her head, letting out a sigh. \"I ain't got a lot of stuff, Ms. Mark. It'll fit in my backpack with all my homework and school shit, uh, I mean, stuff,\" the redhead stammered, not bothering to wait around for a response. Jesus. What in the hell did Ms. Mark expect her to do, haul around a trash bag all day long until school ended? Natalie scoffed, shaking her head as she dug into the pocket of her worn out jeans. Inserting her key into the lock, she opened the door, stepping inside of the place she called home. She grabbed her backpack off of the floor. If she closed her eyes, and thought hard enough, she could practically envision her grandmother lying in front of the television, half-asleep. Natalie would always try her hardest to sneak by her, to get in bed and go to sleep without hearing another complaint, but unfortunately, she always failed. Letting out a sigh and shaking her head, Natalie walked into the bathroom, picking up her toothbrush, toothpaste, and hairbrush, carefully tucking them away in her backpack. She picked up a box of tampons, shoving them away in her bag before taking a look at the bathtub. Natalie had spent countless hours lying in that tub. It had become some sort of safe space for the teenager, she could be alone with her own thoughts. Oh, lord, she remembered the time when her grandmother burst through the bathroom door, yelling at her about an unfinished chore, or some dumb raunchy magazine that she had found, Natalie couldn't quite remember. Her grandmother had ended the rant with something along the lines of 'You're a horrible person,' to which Natalie retorted, 'At least I ain't pimping my own granddaughter out for cash.' Natalie had gotten a sharp pop to the back of the head for that. She didn't regret a single word she said, and she couldn't help but wear a giant grin for the rest of the week. People had asked why, of course, but it wasn't as if she could tell them. Jennifer (her mother) had died very young, only 20 years of age. Heroin overdose. Natalie had only been about three. Her father… her father could've been Tom Cruise, for all she knew. According to her grandmother, her parents had been in a relationship when Natalie was born, but he left about a year after. There was not a single thing to remember him by. Natalie placed the picture into her backpack, opening the closet door. She spent the next ten minutes or so tiredly folding her clothes and packing them away, letting out an exhausted sigh when she was finally finished. Hauling her backpack over her shoulder, the sullen ginger walked out of her former home and never looked back. She sharply rapped on the window of Ms. Mark's car, making the petite blonde jump. Natalie hopped back into the car, raking a hand through her hair before crossing her legs. \"Well, that was fast,\" Ms. Mark muttered with an awkward chuckle. Natalie shrugged nonchalantly. \"Told you I ain't got a lot of stuff,\" she replied, moistening her bottom lip as Ms. Mark started the engine. \"Natalie, what's your favorite subject in school?\" Ms. Mark abruptly asked, her thin, fragile voice cutting through the air. There was something about the blonde social worker that made Natalie uncomfortable, something that she couldn't quite recognize or pinpoint. \"Uh, history,\" Natalie deadpanned, lightly dragging her nails over her flesh, giving her something to do with her hands. \"Oh, that's great! When I was your age, I loved history,\" the doll-like social worker replied, immediately going off on a tangent about her younger years. The woman's high pitched, syrupy sweet voice made the car seem significantly more claustrophobic to the sullen ginger. Natalie did not pay attention to the petite woman's nostalgic rambling, opting to stare out the window with her chin resting in her hand, letting out a few 'mm-hm's and 'uh-huh's every now and then. \"Alright, Miss Natalie, here's your stop,\" Ms. Mark jovially said, turning around to give Natalie a lipstick stained, slightly yellow grin. Natalie grimaced, giving the social worker a nod as she stepped out of the car. \"Thanks for the ride, Ms. Mark,\" the ginger deadpanned, hauling her backpack over her shoulders and closing the car door behind her. Before Natalie could, however, she heard Ms. Mark let out a small exclamation. Holding the door open, the blonde leaned forward, opening her mouth to speak. \"Call me Helen, honey. When does your school get out?\" Helen asked, innocently tilting her head to the side. \"Three,\" Natalie nonchalantly replied, turning around once more. \"Oh, wait a minute now, honey,\" Helen called in that cloying, syrupy sweet voice of hers. She grabbed Natalie by the sleeve of her jean jacket. \"I'll be taking you over to the Balboas when you get out of school, okay? They're eager for you, honey, so don't you worry about anything, alright?\" Helen said, patting Natalie on the arm as the ginger gave her a tight smile. \"Right,\" Natalie replied, slowly pulling away from her counterpart. Finally, she shut the car door behind her and walked into the school before Holly or whatever her name was could give the redhead another cutesy little anecdote. Natalie didn't make it two steps inside the school before her name was called by a familiar voice, a voice belonging to whom Natalie liked to describe as a disgrace to gingers: none other than Chickie Martin. \"Hey, Nat, tough break, huh, sweetie?\" Chickie called, jogging over to his fellow redhead. \"Heard all about it on the news. Ain't nobody gonna miss your old lady's old lady, if you get what I mean,\" he said, giving Natalie his signature 'tough guy' smirk and an aggravating pop on the shoulder. Hm. How bad would the consequences be if she popped him in the nose right here and now? \"Aw, you ain't gonna talk to me? Hey, come on, say somethin',\" Chickie pleaded, giving Natalie another pop on the shoulder. The ginger clenched her jaw, balling her hands into fists. She itched to slap him in the mouth, give him a little lesson. Natalie was just about to teach the stout, ruddy faced teenager that you don't mess with a Goldmill when Robert and Jewel showed up. \"Leave her alone, Chickie,\" Robert deadpanned, casually shoving Chickie away as if it were part of his daily routine. By now, it probably was. \"Yeah, shut up,\" Jewel chimed in, tightening her grip on her boyfriend's hand. Natalie suppressed a laugh, Jewel barely came up to Natalie's chin, what was she going to do to Chickie? Tear him a new one? Natalie doubted it. \"Uh, thanks,\" Natalie hurriedly said, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. \"For, uh, gettin' him away from me,\" she hastily added, quickly looking away from the duo. Natalie moistened her bottom lip, and for whatever reason, hot tears began to form in her eyes, fogging up her glasses. \"Hey, Nat, you okay?\" Jewel softly asked, touching Natalie on the sleeve. The blonde was almost certainly the most touchy-feely person on Earth, which Natalie admittedly didn't like. Times like these, however- she needed the comfort. \"Oh, I'm okay. Uh...my granny died yesterday,\" Natalie muttered, taking off her glasses and wiping her eyes. Jewel gasped, her hands immediately flying up to her face to cover her mouth. \"Nat, I'm sorry,\" the young girl said, taking Natalie in her arms. Natalie moistened her bottom lip, hesitating before returning the much-needed embrace. Letting out a tremulous breath, she momentarily rested her head on Jewel's head before pulling away. \"Thanks, Jewel,\" the redhead muttered, giving her counterpart an awkward grin. Jewel tilted her head to the side, pursing her lips before opening her mouth to speak. \"Where you gonna live now? Got a place to go, or you sleepin' rough?\" the teenager asked, sounding genuinely concerned. Her brow was furrowed, and she was fiddling with the rosary on her neck. \"Well, uh… actually, I…\" Natalie's voice trailed off, and she locked eyes with Robert. She arched an eyebrow, giving the Italian an 'are you gonna tell her?' look. Robert blinked, moistening his bottom lip before turning to his girlfriend. \"She's gonna be staying with me, her grandma's will said that, uh, my parents are her legal guardians now,\" Robert said to Jewel, who turned back to Natalie momentarily to give her a tight, obviously forced smile. \"Oh,\" Jewel replied, looking Natalie up and down. She narrowed her eyes at the ginger standing before her. There was an unusually sharp look in her eyes, and Natalie couldn't help but be a little surprised. \"Hey, he's your boyfriend, Jewel,\" Natalie responded with a shrug before the blonde had a chance to say anything. She didn't need to be a genius to figure out what Jewel was thinking. Not my side of the fence, she thought to herself. It wasn't as if she was going to say anything, of course, she couldn't risk a gay bashing or a ban from the Atomic Hoagie shop, she knew how conservative the owners were. Word went around quickly in South Philly, if she told someone she was gay, the entire tri state area would know within a half hour. Natalie was perfectly fine with relentlessly daydreaming about Drew Barrymore being her girlfriend. Coming out didn't seem… possible. Jewel gave a humorless smile. \"You're right.\" There was an awkward moment of silence as Jewel walked away. \"She cares, what can I say?\" Natalie said with another awkward grin, flashing an equally awkward thumbs up. Robert grimaced in response. Jewel was usually a total sweetheart, but when it came to Robert- she could be a little protective. \"Yeah. See you, I guess,\" Robert muttered, giving Natalie a feeble wave as he walked off to class, leaving her in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the hallway. Natalie didn't blame Robert for being distant. She knew all about the fiasco with Tommy Gunn last year. Hell, every person in Philly knew every detail of the whole thing! Natalie had heard all about the notorious Gunn. vs. Balboa Christmas street fight, but hadn't seen it herself. She was… working. Natalie distinctly remembered walking home that evening, about three in the morning or so. The streets were empty except for a stray dog or two. Natalie couldn't stop shaking, due to the cold and due to the fear. There she was, all alone at three in the goddamned morning in one of the most dangerous parts of the city. Fear raced through her veins, it made her pulse feel like pure lightning, it made her heart pound in her chest until it hurt. Tears had cascaded down her face that night. Natalie had never felt such a horrible feeling in her entire life, and she couldn't pinpoint the reason why. She had done this more times than she could count, why was tonight so horrifically unbearable? Then Natalie realized: It was the holiday season. Every other person was curled up in bed, happy, peaceful, loving, filled to the brim with joy. And then, there was Natalie: selling herself to get her grandmother cash, heels in one hand, mace in the other. Her mother would be disgusted with her. That night, when Natalie finally got home, she scratched at her skin until she drew blood and screamed into her pillow until her throat ached and stung simultaneously. She realized, that very day, that she was never going to be happy. Someone brushing against her brought the ginger out of her flashback. Natalie jumped, letting out a small gasp before tightening her grip on the straps of her backpack. Immediately, she began to walk to her first class of the day, chills running up and down her spine. 3:05 PM - Natalie stood in the middle of the school yard, tapping her foot and checking her watch while she waited for Helen to show up and take her to the Balboa's place. Considering she was being driven, and Robert was walking, she'd almost certainly get there before him. Just as she began to consider forgetting all about Helen and walking over with Robert, the social worker pulled up in her beat-up car and loudly honked. \"Well, that's my cue,\" Natalie said to no one in particular, raking a hand through her hair before walking towards the car. \"Hey, Nat!\" Jesus. Seemed like everybody wanted to talk to her these days. \"Yeah?\" the redhead deadpanned, turning around to look at whoever was calling her name. Turned out to be none other than Robert Balboa himself. \"Uh, you know where we live, right? 2843 Abernathy Street?\" Robert asked, raising his eyebrows as he zipped up his coat. Natalie nodded, turning away from the short Italian. They did not speak another word to each other before Natalie got into the car. \"2843 Abernathy Street,\" Natalie quietly said to Helen, who was sitting in the driver's seat. Her hands gripped the wheel at a perfect '10 and 2', and her unnervingly blue eyes stared off into the distance. She was focused, no doubt about it, and Natalie couldn't help but let out a chuckle. Her grandmother had driven as erratically as humanly possible, so the social worker's precise driving was undoubtedly a change for Natalie. Speaking of her grandmother, Natalie didn't know why she had suddenly broke down in tears at the thought of her. The woman had raised her alone since her grandfather, Mickey, had passed, maybe she deserved some of Natalie's tears for that. Doris had fed Natalie, clothed her, and given her shelter (well, most nights), but Natalie could not remember a single time where she read the ginger a bedtime story, or helped her with her homework. 'I love you''s were only said three or four times a year, always with an empty stare and a deadpan tone. Natalie violently shook her head, forcing the memories out of her mind. The car had stopped. Helen turned around to face Natalie, giving the ginger another ruby red grin. \"Natalie, honey, it's been a pleasure. Here, take my card again, it's always good to have a duplicate, okay? I'll see you soon,\" the petite blonde smoothly said, having probably practiced the speech at least a hundred times. Natalie gave the social worker a wan smile and a toneless 'thank you' before stepping out of the car. Well. There she was. Right in front of where the Balboas lived. All she had to do was knock, and the Balboas would usher her in, scolding her for being out in the cold all alone. They'd be perfectly sweet to her, they wouldn't pimp her out like her grandmother, they'd never assign her a single chore and she'd be living the posh lifestyle until the day she died. Natalie scoffed, aware of how absolutely ridiculous the idea was. This wasn't some dumb story, this was reality, and she had to face it. Maybe this was all some elaborate scam, and she'd open the door, and they'd laugh in her face, calling her every name under the sun before they shoved her away. \"Natalie?\" The voice, as familiar as it was, made Natalie flinch. Robert was standing next to her, holding his keys. He arched an eyebrow inquisitively at the redhead. \"You wanna go in?\" he asked, sounding bored and disinterested. Natalie tried to match his tone, trying not to let on how nervous she was. \"Yeah, I guess,\" the redhead muttered, giving her dark haired counterpart a shrug. \"Alright,\" Robert muttered, inserting his key into the door, pushing it open. Natalie hadn't even gotten one foot in the door before she heard a voice. \"Yo, kid is that you?\" a familiar voice called. It had more of a slur to it than Natalie remembered. She had briefly heard Rocky talk last night, but considering everything in the past 17 or so hours had been a blur, she couldn't remember anything very well. Her train of thought suddenly came to a stop as she heard someone call her name. \"Yo, Natalie! How you doin'?\" Rocky called, walking towards her with a massive, childish grin on his face. His wife (Natalie couldn't remember her name) followed close by, her hands clasped in front of her waist and a tight smile plastered on her face. \"Hi, Mr. Balboa,\" Natalie said, giving the tall, muscular Italian a stiff, awkward hug. Physical affection did not come easily to her, primarily because of her upbringing. She immediately tensed as he embraced her, and she had to fight back the urge to pull away from him. \"Hello, Natalie, it's so good to see you again,\" Rocky's wife said, opening her arms to give Natalie another warm embrace. The petite brunette patted Natalie on the back before pulling away, the same tight smile plastered on her face. \"Ha, uh, you too, Mrs. Balboa,\" Natalie stammered ought, tears suddenly brimming in her eyes. Natalie didn't have a clue why, of course, but she knew one thing: If she kept on crying for unknown reasons, she was going to have a pretty big issue on her hands. \"Oh, sweetheart, please call me Adrian,\" Rocky's wife said, giving Natalie a pat on the arm. Jesus, did the woman have a 'patting' fetish or something? Was that even a word in the first place? \"And you can call me Rocky,\" Rocky added jovially, bearing the same childish, idiotic, toothy grin that he had when Natalie first walked in. At least the guy's consistent, Natalie thought to herself, forcing a small smile on her face. \"Yo, kid, show Natalie to where she's stayin', okay?\" Rocky said, giving Robert a lighthearted punch on the shoulder. The small teenager listlessly nodded, muttering something along the lines of 'come on' to Natalie before making his way over to the staircase. Natalie pressed her lips together in another awkward smile as she followed Robert downstairs into the basement. \"So, uh. Make yourself at home, I guess,\" Robert mumbled, giving Natalie a small shrug, pointing towards the couch against the wall. Boxing memorabilia hung from the walls, along with a sentimental family picture here and there. Natalie slowly set her backpack on the couch before letting out a long, tremulous breath. This was where she was going to live, this was her life now. The idea refused to settle in her mind, it didn't sink in at all. How long was she going to live like this? The next three years? Natalie couldn't even fathom it, and she'd only been here for about ten minutes. Natalie shrugged. Eh, she'd have to get comfortable at some point in time, wouldn't she? She might as well start now and get down to doing her homework. There were equations to be solved, and vocabulary words to be learned, dammit. 8:07 PM \"This spaghetti is real good, Adrian,\" Natalie said with a smile, cutting a noodle in half with her fork. \"It's rigatoni,\" Robert deadpanned from his seat across from her. Natalie's face immediately began to burn with embarrassment, and she looked down at her plate. Idiot, now they're going to think you're stupid, she thought to herself, all sorts of scenarios immediately popping up in her mind. \"Oh, Robert, don't, don't tease her,\" Adrian stammered, shooting her son a glare. \"It's Natalie, spaghetti,\" Adrian said with a nod and a tight smile, blinking hard as she realized her mistake. \"Oh, I mean, it's spaghetti, Natalie, I'm sorry,\" the petite brunette said, awkwardly chuckling before her eyes averted themselves back to her plate. Natalie nodded in acknowledgement as she began to eat again. There was a brief pause before Natalie heard a door open- well, more like she heard a loud crash, a familiar slurred yell, and a garbled, likely drunken scream all in the span of three seconds. \"One, two, three,\" Robert muttered, rolling his eyes as he twirled his spaghetti around a fork. \"Here they come.\" \"Ello,\" a voice shouted. It was oddly familiar, not as familiar as Mr. Balboa's marble mouthed, drunken-sounding, barely comprehensible South Philly slur, but Natalie knew it from somewhere… Natalie's heart stopped as the owner of the voice entered the kitchen. It- it was the guy, the man, the guy from two years ago with the baseball bat and the fisherman's hat, the guy who had charged at Natalie and Marie, hollering that they had to get off his property. He was the same man who had grabbed her by the sleeve and asked her who she was, he was the same man that Natalie ran from, screaming and yelling bloody murder- \"Who're you?\" Natalie blinked. The man had an eyebrow arched, and a hand clasped around a flask. The fisherman's hat he had sported when Natalie saw him last was tightly placed around his head, and the foul, resentful attitude was clearly ever present. \"Uh, Natalie… Natalie Goldmill, Mickey's granddaughter,\" the ginger stammered out, trying not to let on how relieved she was that he didn't recognize her. \"Why'd your mother name you that?\" the man drily replied, stuffing a flask in the pocket of his jacket before shuffling off to the cesspool he crawled out of. \"Yo, I'm sorry about him, uh, I ain't sure if you remember him, but, uh, that's Paulie, Adrian's brother. He ain't in a talkin' mood right now,\" Rocky hurriedly explained with his signature childlike grin, making a variety of quick hand gestures as he pulled out a seat to sit down. Natalie briefly nodded as she looked back down at her plate. Did he need to sit so close to her, was that his idea of being nice? She couldn't help but shy away from him, pressing her lips together tightly. \"You know, your grandfather, he, he was my trainer, you know?\" Rocky rambled, scooting even closer to Natalie until their knees nearly touched. Natalie immediately tensed up, drawing in a sharp breath. \"Woo, he could get real, real, nasty. Real nasty. You know, he, he'd always, uh…\" Rocky trailed off, resting his chin in his hand, pausing momentarily. There was some sort of energy in his eyes that Natalie hadn't seen. \"He, uh… he'd make me tie a string 'round my ankles, 'cause I ain't got no balance, right? He says to me, Mick says to me-\" Rocky moistened his bottom lip, pressing his hands together. \"Rocky Marciano had the same problem, you ever heard of him?\" Rocky asked, pointing his clasped hands toward Natalie. Natalie nodded. Of course I do, dim-wit, I got Mickey Goldmill as my grandpa, she thought to herself. Rocky nodded, opening his mouth to speak. \"Well, I-\" \"Natalie, how'd your mom die?\" Robert abruptly interjected, leaning forward across the table as Natalie's train of thought came to a screeching halt. \"Sweetheart, we've talked about this, don't get personal,\" Adrian said firmly, patting her son's shoulder with a warning look. \"I'm sorry, Natalie,\" Adrian whispered, briefly glancing at the ginger. \"Listen to your mother,\" Rocky added, gesturing at his son with a fork. He glanced at Natalie as well, but without an utterance of apology. It was almost as if he was telling Natalie not to answer Robert's question, and to be frank, Natalie didn't blame him one bit. Still, she could tell Robert felt a little guilty over asking, and she didn't want to be the one to upset him. Besides, he asked, didn't he deserve an answer? Well, on second thought, the truth would probably upset him even more than a brief reprimand from his parents. Before she could think it through, Natalie opened her mouth to speak. She looked Robert dead in the eye. \"Heroin overdose,\" the ginger said crisply and evenly, not breaking eye contact for a second. Her jaw was slightly clenched, her hands were balled into fists underneath the table, and there was a certain hot, unpleasant feeling in her chest that she was all too familiar with: the feeling of being violated, the feeling of her dignity being torn to shreds. Robert immediately recoiled, making a small choking noise. His eyes became a little wider, and his frame became a little smaller. He sat there in stunned silence for a moment before speaking. \"Sorry,\" he muttered, not looking directly at Natalie. The entire room suddenly became incredibly, incredibly quiet. Natalie never knew silence could be so loud. Natalie immediately regretted answering. It didn't make her feel any better about herself as a human being, that was for sure. For a moment, she questioned her intentions, did she answer out of spite, did she answer because she wanted to? Maybe she should've just told him to fuck off and mind his own damn business. Besides, if she didn't want to answer, nobody was holding a damn gun to her head, she didn't have to upset herself, or him... \"I'm sorry if I upset you,\" Natalie mumbled, letting out a small, nervous chuckle. \"Nah. I asked,\" Robert deadpanned, his face completely devoid of expression. Shit. If Mr. Salt-of-the-Earth, born and raised in the lap of luxury thought that was bad, wait until he heard about Natalie's days as a prostitute. Now that would knock his socks off, wouldn't it, Natalie thought to herself. \"Yo, uh…\" Rocky paused, getting up from his chair along with his wife. \"He asked, you know?\" The tall Italian pushed his chair in with an awkward laugh as he made his way over to the sink, Adrian following closely behind. \"Oh, uh, can I help with the dishes?\" Natalie asked, gazing up at the husband and wife. Rocky shook his head, making a 'shoo' motion with his hand. \"Nah, you ain't gotta help. You two,\" he looked at Natalie, then at Robert. \"Get to bed, you got a long day tomorrow. Gotta go to school and everythin',\" Rocky said, running a hand through his slightly disheveled black curls. \"Okay,\" Natalie softly replied, getting up from her chair. She wasn't used to being told what to do like this. Usually, instructions were shouted at her by Granny Dearest, she was never gently told what to do, she didn't even dream about it. \"Goodnight, everyone,\" Natalie said, forcing a smile on her face as she left the kitchen 'Goodnight's' and 'see you tomorrow's' followed closely behind her as she scurried downstairs and practically collapsed on the couch. Wowie. Had there ever been a more a more awkward, uncomfortable, tension filled moment in the Balboa household? Natalie doubted it. The ginger checked her watch. 8:38. She rarely, if ever, went to sleep this early. Dozing off around two or three was more her scene, but she doubted that would be A-OK with the Balboa family. The ginger shook her head, ridding herself of every thought she had before pulling the scratchy quilt the Balboa's provided her with over her chin. She'd wait until tomorrow to drive herself crazy and incessantly scold herself.[Chapter 3] 6:09 AM, DECEMBER 31ST, 1991 \"Good morning, Philly,\" Natalie muttered to herself, tearing off her quilt as her feet hit the cold, hard floor. Her eyes, still blurry with sleep, suddenly shot wide open. The ginger's heart immediately started to race as she drew in a sharp breath. Where was she, what was going on? Natalie frantically looked around her as she grabbed her glasses, her lips parting as she tried to make sense of where she was. Natalie let out a sigh of relief as she saw Robert lying in his bed, an arm hanging off his bed. Suddenly, everything came back to her. She was alright, there was nothing to worry about for the time being. Natalie took in a sharp breath, balling up the fabric of her jeans in her hands, feeling her chest begin to tighten. There had been countless times when Natalie woke up in alleyways, crackhouses, roach-infested apartments, or sleazy motel rooms, barely able to think. The awful ache between her legs and the sour, bitter taste in her throat told her everything she needed to know about the night before. Natalie shuddered as she tried to push the memories out of her mind. A nice, good cup of joe was exactly what she needed. The redhead walked up into the kitchen, pulling out a chair at the kitchen table and taking a seat. Tapping her fingers against the wood of the table, she let out a deep breath. What had she gotten up for in the first place? Coffee, right? Good ol' cup of joe to calm her nerves, Natalie thought to herself, letting out a sigh. Well, she felt perfectly fine now, except for the God-awful caffeine headache that she had to nurse at some point in time. Natalie looked up to see Rocky tiredly stumbling over to the fridge. He opened it and peered inside, letting out a deep sigh. Natalie widened her eyes as the statuesque Italian removed an egg carton from the fridge, opened it, and started cracking eggs into a glass. She tilted her head to the side, slightly furrowing her brow. He hadn't noticed her yet, had he? Well, judging by the way he was chugging those raw eggs, he certainly hadn't. Natalie tried to suppress a gagging noise, clamping her hand over her mouth as she looked away. She briefly contemplated ringing up Ms. Mark and telling her to get her the hell out of this joint, or maybe waking up Robert and asking him where the nearest mental institution was. Before Natalie could make a decision, the tall Italian wiped his mouth with the sleeve of his sweater, giving Natalie a jovial, toothy grin. \"It's good for you,\" Rocky explained, placing his glass in the sink before walking over to the table, pulling out a chair. The tall Italian grabbed a newspaper and began casually leafing through it. Natalie looked down at her lap, twiddling her thumbs. The air was filled with an awkward tension that likely wasn't going to go away anytime soon. \"Uh…do you got a coffee machine?\" Natalie asked after a moment, unsure of how to start a conversation. Rocky looked a little taken aback, and frankly, Natalie didn't blame him. Social interactions weren't exactly her specialty in the first place, she had to admit. She didn't know what Rocky expected out of her anyway. Maybe he expected a kind-hearted, impeccably mannered social butterfly that could talk your ear off, but if that's what he bargained for, he was going to be extremely disappointed. \"Yeah, we got a coffee machine. No, no, don't get up, I'll make it for you,\" Rocky said, getting up from his seat. \"You drink coffee a lot?\" the tall Italian asked. Natalie nodded before she realized he couldn't see her. Idiot. \"No more than the average American,\" Natalie deadpanned, staring off into space. Dammit, what did he want with her? Natalie flinched as Rocky placed a cup of coffee in front of her, startled by the sudden noise. \"Thank you,\" the ginger muttered, staring blankly at the pool of dark liquid sloshing around. Rocky opened his mouth to speak, and Natalie struggled to refrain from rolling her eyes. Mercy, what did this brainless dago want to yap about now? \"Last day of 1991, ain't it?\" Rocky said, leaning forward across the table. Natalie's eyes widened, she hadn't really given much thought to it. Last day of 1991. Huh, maybe 1992 would go a little easier on her, it wouldn't be as awful as the past fifteen years, Natalie mused, staring off into space. \"You lookin' forward to the new year? I sure am,\" Rocky rambled, not bothering to wait for Natalie's response. \"You know, I tried to tell Adrian we should hold a little get-together, you know? Have a little party. But, you know how Adrian is, she's sufferin' from the disease of being shy. After all these years, still sufferin', I think it's terminal, don't you?\" Rocky joked, laughing like a little kid as he continued to ramble. \"Ha. I mean, uh… guess she didn't get her shots in time,\" Natalie weakly offered, giving Rocky a wan smile as she took a sip of her coffee. Oh, sweet brown baby Jesus, take me now, the ginger thought to herself. I know I'm a Jew , but take me now. \"You're a funny one. You and I should get along good, real good,\" Rocky said as the lights switched on. Natalie once again flinched at the sudden noise. Rocky's wife stood in the doorway of the kitchen, a small, wan smile on her face. \"Morning,\" Adrian brightly said, making her way over to Rocky as she planted a kiss on her husband's lips. \"Mornin', Mrs. Balboa,\" Natalie muttered, her mouth closing around the rim of her coffee cup. \"Hello,\" Adrian replied jovially, giving Natalie a pat on the shoulder as she opened the refrigerator. \"Are you hungry?\" the petite brunette asked, turning towards Natalie with a carton of milk in hand. Natalie was about to reply before her mind took a turn towards something significantly raunchier than eggs and bacon. Adrian's nipples were pointing through the thin fabric of her nightgown. Natalie immediately began to blush, drawing in a sharp breath. She was not going to think about Adrian like that, she was not going to think about Adrian like that, she was not- \"Uh, well, I could eat,\" Natalie stammered, immediately halting her train of thoughts. \"Food, I could eat food. I could eat food,\" Natalie hurriedly said, immediately tearing her gaze away from Adrian. \"Alright, Natalie, how do pancakes sound?\" Adrian asked, not seeming to notice the way Natalie was looking at her. Staring at the breasts of the wife of a two time heavyweight world champion was most certainly not the best idea. Natalie had a pillow to hump and a Drew Barrymore poster to look at while humping said pillow, she would be fine. Natalie squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath, slowly letting it out as she tried to ignore the heat dancing across her skin. \"Natalie, why don't you you go to the basement and wake up the kid?\" Rocky suggested. \"We'll have breakfast as a family, you know?\" he said, giving Natalie a grin. Ho-ho-ho, slow your roll there, pal . Natalie blinked hard. There wasn't a chance he had just said- \"Yeah, sure, family breakfast, uh-huh,\" Natalie deadpanned, making a beeline for the stairs before she could get herself in trouble by making some sort of sarcastic remark. \"Family breakfast? Family breakfast my freckled ass,\" Natalie muttered as she walked down the stairs, making her way over to Robert. \"Rise and shine, darling,\" Natalie sarcastically drawled, knocking on Robert's forehead. The teenage boy let out a small groan of annoyance as he ran a hand through his hair. \"What?\" Robert muttered, not bothering to move. \"Your dad wants us to have a 'family breakfast', whatever that means,\" Natalie replied, placing her hands on her hips. Silence. \"Your mom's makin' pancakes,\" Natalie deadpanned, nudging the barely awake teenager huddled under a pile of blankets. \"Okay, okay,\" Robert mumbled, throwing the covers off of his body. \"I'm up, I'm up.\" \"Huh, that was fast,\" Natalie remarked, placing her hand on the stair rail. \"Wait, Nat, you wore that yesterday,\" Robert said pointedly, arching an eyebrow at the ginger. \"And?\" Natalie deadpanned, narrowing her eyes at the brown-haired, blurry eyed teenager. Robert rolled his eyes as he casually slid out of bed, walking over to the stairs. He did not have to say another word to prove his point to Natalie. Natalie placed her hands back on her hips as she let out a scoff. Like she was going to take orders from some stupid, rich boy wop like him. Who the fuck was he? Okay, Natalie, enough with all the goddamn ethnic epithets. He's right, you haven't changed out of this shirt in three days, Natalie thought to herself, letting out a deep sigh. Natalie walked up the stairs about ten minutes later, looking slightly more decent than she had shortly before. Violently raking a comb through one's disheveled hair could apparently do wonders. \"You need any help with them pancakes, Mrs. Balboa?\" Natalie asked, meekly walking over to the stove. \"No, no, that's alright,\" Adrian replied with a small, nervous chuckle, giving Natalie a barely noticeable smile. \"Natalie, do we have school today?\" Robert asked, slouching down in his chair with his chin resting in his hand. \"It's New Years Eve, slow-poke,\" Natalie deadpanned, rolling her eyes as she pulled out a chair. \"Don't be mean,\" Robert said defensively, furrowing his brow at the surly ginger. \"I was just askin' a question.\" \"A dumb question,\" Natalie replied with a snort, sneering at the boy sitting across from her. Robert shrugged, immediately returning to what seemed to be his favorite activity: Being a sullen little bitch. \"Natalie, you wanna watch the ball drop with us?\" Rocky asked, walking over to the stove. He rested his hands on the opening bar of the oven, casually jutting his hip out. Natalie arched an eyebrow. \"The, uh, the what? Huh?\" \"Oh, uh…\" Rocky quickly seemed to realize that Natalie didn't have a clue what he was talking about. \"In New York, there's a, a ball that drops every new year. It's fun. You wanna watch it with us?\" the tall Italian asked, raising his eyebrows. Well, it wasn't as if Natalie had anything better to do, did she? Then again, wallowing in her own self pity for the fifteenth new year in a row couldn't be that bad… \"Um…\" Natalie snagged her bottom lip on her teeth as she slowly exhaled. \"Sure, I mean, I ain't got much to do, so…\" Natalie mumbled, twiddling her thumbs in her lap as she sat silently in her chair. \"Excellent. Real, real, excellent. I'll tell you now, we're gon' have a little get together, a little party,\" Rocky rambled, an excited, childish smile that seemed to be planted on his face looking brighter than ever. \"Oh, Rocky, who said anything about a party?\" Adrian groaned exhaustedly, shoveling pancakes onto a nearby plate. \"Sorry, Natalie, they're a little burnt,\" the petite brunette quickly explained before returning to her argument with her husband. \"We're not throwing a party, Rocky, we do that every year. This year, I'd like it to be a little quiet, just you, me, Paulie, and the kid,\" Adrian said with a groan as she cast a glance towards Natalie. \"And her, of course,\" Adrian quietly added, almost as if Natalie's existence was a mere afterthought to her. Natalie's gut twisted uncomfortably as she took in a sharp breath. Perhaps she was being a bit oversensitive, but suddenly, she felt very, very small. Natalie's chest tightened as she twiddled her thumbs in her lap, trying to swallow the bile that was accumulating in her throat. \"We don't even know if she's Mick's granddaughter, Rocky,\" Adrian whispered, leaning forward and furrowing her brow. If she thought Natalie couldn't hear her, oh, boy, the bitch was wrong. \"Yeah, sure she is! Look, listen-\" Rocky abruptly clapped his hands together as he turned to Natalie. \"Yo, uh…\" The tall Italian's voice trailed off as he placed his hands on his hips, leaning back against the cluttered kitchen counter. \"What's, uh…. what do you call me?\" Rocky asked, one side of his mouth lifting up into a crooked, uncomfortable looking grin. Natalie furrowed her brow in disbelief and confusion, shifting her weight in her chair as she chewed on her bottom lip. \"Uh.. Rocky?\" the ginger replied, the confused twang in her voice growing slightly stronger as the tall Italian shook his head. \"No, what I am. Like, like, what we are. You know, where we're from. Our, uh…\" Rocky's mind scrambled to find the word he wanted to use. After a moment, he turned to his wife, looking at the small brunette expectantly. \"Our ethnicity,\" Adrian finished for her husband, smoothly sliding her arm around his with a tight, almost certainly fake smile plastered on her face. \"Oh, uh, that's easy,\" Natalie said with a shrug, more than slightly annoyed at the overly inquisitive couple. \"Eye-talian.\" There was a complete silence in the Balboa household for a good fifteen seconds before Rocky spoke. \"She's Mick's, Adri,\" the tall Italian said, raising his eyebrows pointedly at his wife. Adrian briefly glanced at Natalie, tightly pressing her lips together in a doubtful grimace. Speaking of 'Mick', Natalie didn't think of him nearly as often as she should. Mickey was, after all, the one who shielded her from Granny during drunken rages, the one who checked for monsters every night, the one who held her close, kissed the top of her head, and told her he loved her. Natalie was able to see a side of him nobody else had: The kind, loving, gentle Mickey was a far contrast from the perpetually enraged hardass that the entirety of South Philly knew him to be. To everyone else, he was an icon, a legend. To Natalie, he was just Grandpa. Natalie clenched her jaw, ignoring the aching pain in her mouth. He was also the one who abandoned her the second the opportunity for a better life showed up, she could never forget that. Mickey had moved in with Rocky about a year after his daughter passed, leaving Natalie to the wolves. He had abandoned her. If Mick had stayed his ass in South Philly, Natalie wouldn't have suffered at the hands of Granny Dearest as much as she did. She wouldn't have been a prostitute. She wouldn't have stumbled home night after night, thighs stained with blood, throat sour-tasting and raw, stomach aching, heart pounding. She wouldn't have spent a goddamn day being used- Natalie shuddered, forcing herself to stop probing the possibilities of what could have been, to stop thinking of the past. She'd probably have to do it again at some point in time, as much as she hated to admit it. It was just… her way of living. º º º The rest of the day went by like a blink of an eye. Nothing much had happened, Robert had given her a few dirty looks here and there, peppering them in every so often. In return, she had mouthed a couple ethnic epithets in his general direction whenever his back was turned to her. Natalie was just beginning to unfurl her middle finger again when Adrian trotted downstairs, her hands clasped tightly around her waist. \"Natalie, can you help me put up the decorations for the party?\" the petite woman asked, wiping her hands on her long, conversative skirt. Natalie blinked, moistening her bottom lip as she sat up in her chair. \"You're havin' a party?\" Natalie asked, furrowing her brow as she sat up in her chair. \"Rocky managed to convince me, so yes, we're havin' a party. Startin' it early, too,\" Adrian explained, raising her eyebrows expectantly at the gaping ginger. \"Uh, I'll help, sure,\" Natalie hurriedly said, getting up from her seat. The teenager's glasses slid down her nose as she made her way towards the stairs, hot on Adrian's heels. \"Remind me not to let Paulie pour bourbon into the punch this year,\" Adrian muttered as the duo walked into the kitchen. \"The whole neighborhood got sloppy drunk when he did it last time, not a good way to ring in the new year, I know,\" the brunette continued with an awkward laugh, lightly patting Natalie on the arm. The whole neighborhood got sloppy drunk? Natalie furrowed her brow. The only 'sloppy' Natalie got for New Year's Eve 1990 was sloppy depressed. Adrian casually handed Natalie half of a banner, hanging her half on a nail firmly planted in the wall. The banner read 'HAPPY NEW YEAR!' in obnoxiously bright, glittery letters that looked more appropriate for a five year old's birthday party, rather than a New Year's celebration. Natalie pinned her half to the wall as well, looking over to Adrian for approval. In response, the small brunette gave her a tight smile. \"Good job,\" Adrian muttered, patting her on the back as she walked away. \"I won an award for banner puttin' up in third grade,\" Natalie joked, a jovial grin making her freckled features significantly brighter. Adrian turned to her and let out a genuine, kind hearted laugh. It seemed like the older woman was beginning to warm up to the redheaded teenager very quickly. As much as she didn't want to admit it, she wanted the Balboas to like her. Well, except for Robert, of course, she didn't give a rat's ass what he thought about her. (Alright, well, maybe a little.) If she wanted to stay here for a while, she'd have to get along with the family well, right? Dumb jokes seemed to be the pathway to their hearts, especially Rocky. She doubted the slow-witted Italian needed much to be happy. º º º \"Now it's a party,\" Rocky proclaimed as people started filing in, tossing their jackets to the floor and letting out obnoxious shouts of 'HEY, ROCK!' Natalie's stomach twisted painfully as she looked down at the floor. Being around so many people… so many men immediately put Natalie on edge. Her heart started to pound as she analyzed the faces of the newcomers. Could they hurt her? Were they a threat to her? Did she know them? Did they know her? Natalie balled her hands into fists as her breathing turned shallow and quick. Her chest tightened up as she suddenly leapt from her seat on the couch and practically sprinted for the bathroom. Slamming the door shut behind her, the ginger sat on the ground, her back pressed against the door as worst case scenarios flew through her mind. Natalie hyperventilated uncontrollably, tears beginning to well up in her eyes. Natalie's chest painfully heaved as she gripped the edge of the sink, hoisting herself up. She stared at her reflection, forcing herself to breathe a little more evenly. The ginger violently shook her head, swallowing the bile accumulating in her mouth. Natalie winced, pressing her lips together tightly. The painful, tight knot in her chest began to undo itself, and her hyperventilating slowly stopped. Her wrists began to itch. \"Goddamnit,\" Natalie spat, screwing her eyes shut. She sure as shit wasn't going to go back out there and tap into her non-existent inner social butterfly, and she sure as shit couldn't stand another minute within the enclosed bathroom. Her eyes drifted over to the razor placed on the bathroom sink. It seemed as if the small metal object was waiting expectantly for her, like some sort of sadistic 'welcome home' gift. Before doubt could cloud her mind, the ginger grabbed the razor, pulled down the sleeve of her borrowed sweater, and made a cut. Natalie let out something between a guffaw and a shriek as the blade pierced her skin. Quickly, she put it back to its original place, breathing in and out as her free hand gripped the sink. The ginger forced herself to look at her reflection once more. God, she looked like a mess. Natalie forced an obnoxious, cartoonish, fake smile upon her face as she reached for a comb to brush her hair with. The ginger raked the brush through her hair, letting out a tremulous breath as she did so. Once she had deemed herself as presentable, Natalie threw open the door to the bathroom and promptly marched out, heading over to the kitchen to get herself a drink. It usually took a lot more for Natalie to have a panic attack. A nightmare, a flashback, her grandmother's drunken rages. Not a crowd of dago brutes. Jesus, what was her problem- Natalie stopped dead in her tracks, her breath immediately stolen away from her. Adrian was sitting at the kitchen table with a glass of wine in her hand, sitting across a plain-faced, unruly haired woman around Adrian's age. Next to them, however- next to them was the most beautiful girl Natalie had ever seen. Her eyes, a beautiful, beautiful green twinkled with joy. Her hair, a lovely chocolate brown, cascaded down her back, and her smile gleamed with mischief. She was ethereal. Gorgeous. Stunning. Every positive word Natalie could think of. \"Natalie, I'm glad you're here,\" Adrian said jovially, placing her lipstick stained glass of wine down and guiding the ginger over to the table. \"This is Angela, she's your age,\" Adrian said with a sticky sweet tone, patting the ginger on the back. Natalie blinked. Huh. Uh. Pretty girl. Gay, gay, I'm gay- my age, eh, uh- fuck- \"Hi, Natalie, I'm Angela,\" the ethereal girl said warmly, stretching out her hand with a kind smile. \"Wha- oh, uh, hi, real nice to meet you,\" Natalie replied after a moment, fitting her hand into Angela's. Her mouth formed a childish, crooked grin as Angela smiled again. Huh. Pretty girl smile, uh, ha- \"I've heard a lot about you, Natalie,\" Angela continued as she sat back down. Almost as if she were under a spell, Natalie blankly pulled out a chair, staring open mouthed at the gorgeous brunette. \"I seen you at school a couple times, you're always tellin' Chickie to shove off,\" Angela said with a shy giggle, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear. \"Yeah, yeah, he's a real disgrace to gingers. As far as I'm concerned, he's a strawberry blonde. Make him their problem, ha,\" Natalie stammered out, her brain completely running on autopilot. Pretty girls tended to have that effect on her. \"You're funny,\" Angela said, resting an elbow on the table. \"I like that.\" The statement was both simple and deadpan, but Natalie's heart melted all the same. The brunette's syrupy sweet South Philly drawl was making Natalie fall a little more in love by the minute. \"Well, we'll let you get to know each other,\" Adrian said as she left the kitchen, probably to mingle with the guests. Ah. Adrian Balboa. Best unintentional wingwoman of the year. \"So, I hear you're 'Mighty Mick's' granddaughter,\" Angela said, crossing her ankles as she leaned back in her chair. Natalie's heart sank as her hopes of having a decent conversation were dashed. Apparently, the change in her demeanor did not go unnoticed by Angela. The brunette leaned forward, giving Natalie an apologetic smile. \"Sorry, you must have been hearin' those words all night,\" Angela muttered, pressing her lips together sheepishly. Natalie gasped, flinching in her seat as she leaned forward to place a comforting, reassuring hand on her brunette counterpart. \"No, no, it's okay. I ain't even talked to anybody here,\" Natalie stammered out, her eyes wide with alarm. If she fucked this up, she'd never forgive herself- Angela giggled again, a sound that made Natalie grin like a little kid. \"Oh, don't worry 'bout it,\" the brunette said, patting Natalie on the arm. \"Introvert?\" Angela asked, tilting her head to the side. Natalie had no idea what that meant. She nodded. \"Yeah, been one all my life,\" the ginger replied, silently hoping that didn't mean something horrible. \"Well, I'm an extrovert, so we can, uh, balance each other out, eh?\" Angela suggested, a barely perceptible smirk creeping onto her face. The green eyed brunette could have been speaking Ancient Greek for all Natalie knew. \"Uh-huh,\" Natalie said, scooting in a little closer towards Angela. That was as brave as she could get regarding the flirting department. Angela moistened her bottom lip as she looked the clueless ginger up and down, making heat pool down into Natalie's stomach (and other places.) \"Natalie Goldmill,\" Angela drawled, almost as if she were sounding out the ginger's name. Natalie inquisitively arched an eyebrow, leaning forward. \"What?\" A smirk spread across Angela's face. \"Do you wanna dance?\" Huh. Dance. Pretty girl dance. Dance with me. \"Yeah, I'd love to,\" Natalie blurted out, momentarily forgetting that she had no idea how to dance. \"Oh, great. I hear they're playin' some real good stuff. But-\" Angela leaned in again, almost if she were telling Natalie a sweet secret. \"If we touch Mr. Balboa's Carole King records, he'll kill us,\" the brunette muttered from the side of her mouth, giving Natalie a sly wink. Natalie let out a guffaw as she got up from her chair, closely following Angela with the shyness of a small schoolgirl. The moment Angela took Natalie by the hand and led her into the lively, fun-filled living room, a pang of fear suddenly struck her. She took in a sharp breath, making Angela turn around to face her. Natalie didn't want anyone to think that she was...no, she didn't want anyone to know who or what she was. Angela leaned in towards her, looking very concerned. \"You okay?\" the brunette softly asked, furrowing her brow. Natalie briskly, enthusiastically nodded, forcing a smile onto her face. Angela shook her head, slightly narrowing her eyes at the obviously uncomfortable ginger. \"Nah, you ain't okay,\" the brunette muttered, raising her eyebrows as she looked Natalie up and down. The ginger's stomach churned with unease as she waited for Angela to say something. Anything. \"Oh, you don't want no one to know?\" Angela finally said after what seemed like eons, lowering her voice to a tone that was barely above a whisper. Natalie blinked. \"Know what?\" Angela's eyes suddenly shot wide open, and she jerked away from Natalie as if the ginger has given her some sort of painful shock. \"I'm sorry, I'm real sorry, I thought- well, you know what I thought,\" Angela rambled, taking in a deep, tremulous breath. She muttered something inaudible about having to leave and straight people and their bullshit, turning away from Natalie. Oh. She thought Natalie was straight- \"Wait, no,\" Natalie hurriedly called, grabbing Angela by the sleeve. \"You got me right.\" Angela blinked, a goofy, idiotic smile not unlike Mr. Balboa's appearing on her face. \"I got you right, eh?\" she said. \"Yeah, you got me,\" Natalie said with a small chuckle, trying to ignore the giddy, eager heat blossoming within her chest. \"And I don't mind dancin' with you, really. I don't,\" Natalie hurriedly explained, reaching out to awkwardly pat Angela on the shoulder. \"Yeah, I mean, no one's gonna see us dancin' and say, oh, there go them two lesbians,\" Angela replied, lowering her voice again with an awkward grin. \"I mean, we are them two lesbians, but, they don't gotta know-\" Natalie let out a sigh of both exhaustion and relief, deciding that some words were better left unsaid. \"So, uh, you still wanna dance?\" Angela muttered suggestively, snaking her hand towards the small of the ginger's back. Natalie grinned. \"Yeah.\" \"Okay, so, uh…\" Angela gently took Natalie's hands in her own, entwining them together. Natalie's heart skipped a beat. Living out fantasy of dancing with a real pretty girl? Check. Living out elaborate fantasy of threesome with Julia Roberts and Drew Barrymore? Not-check. Angela moved their entwined hands back and forth, her movements lovably awkward. She drew Natalie closer in with a small smile before letting out a guffaw. Shaking her head, the brunette leaned in towards Natalie and muttered: \"Do you know what you're doin'? 'Cause I don't.\" The uncomfortable knot of insecurity inside of Natalie's chest began to loosen. She let out a small, barely audible chuckle of relief. Angela didn't know what she was doing any more than Natalie did. They were a bunch of dumb lesbians attempting to dance on New Year's Eve, there was nothing more to i- okay. \"I ain't never danced before,\" Natalie sheepishly admitted, rubbing the back of her neck as if she had something to be awful sorry about. \"You and me both, Natalie, you and me both,\" Angela drawled soothingly, casually slipping her tongue between her teeth. The innocent, kind hearted grin made Natalie's heart melt for what must have been the hundredth time since they met. \"Hey, whaddya say…\" Angela nonchalantly pulled Natalie in by the belt loops, pressing their bodies together. The sudden action sent a jolt of electricity up Natalie's spine, and the devilish smirk accompanied with it sent another one. \"Whaddya say we get outta here, grab a couple of cherry sodas at the nearest corner store, and wait until midnight rolls around?\" Angela whispered, tilting her head to the side as her gaze slowly drifted over Natalie. That was it for Natalie. She was in love. \"Yes.\" º º º Angela swung open the door of Howie's Convenience Store, nonchalantly holding it open behind her. She gave Natalie a quick smile that made the shoddy, flickering lights of the corner store seem to burn a little brighter. \"So, cherry soda, right? That's your poison?\" Angela inquired, grabbing Natalie by the hand and leading her over to the massive cooler smack dab in the middle of the store. \"Yeah, never cared too much for the other stuff,\" Natalie deadpanned, giving Angela a blasé shrug. Angela had just grabbed two soda cans when she tensed up, drawing in a sharp breath as she abruptly took hold of Natalie's elbow. Natalie's pulse began to quicken as Angela leaned towards her, whispering \"Look behind you,\" to the startled ginger. Natalie did as she was told, fear already beginning to brew within her gut. Worst case scenarios raced through her mind as she- \"Oh, it's just Chickie, why you scared of him?\" Natalie unwisely asked, just loud enough for the entire store to hear. Unfortunately, that included the stocky teenager that Natalie had 'affectionately' dubbed a 'disgrace to gingers.' \"Hey, hey, Angela, you comin' to pick up your tampons?\" Chickie called, strolling over to the duo with a smug smirk planted on his ruddy face. Natalie had jizzed in her pants at the thought of smacking it off of him more times than she could count. \"Funny, I was gonna ask you the same thing,\" Angela deadpanned, sweeping past the ruddy faced teenager as if he were invisible. \"You goin' to a party? Jewel there?\" Chickie questioned, clearly not getting the hint from the aggravated brunette. \"You think Robert's givin' it to her good? Huh, you think Rocky Jr.'s got it goin' on?\" the stocky teenager obnoxiously insisted, wedging himself between Natalie and Angela. \"Hey, we're just tryin' to get some sodas,\" Angela mumbled tonelessly, slamming the soda cans onto the checkout counter. \"And I'm just tryin' to get some, if you know what I mean. Guy's gotta eat.\" Natalie's heart dropped to her stomach, her hands beginning to shake. Unease and fear coursed through her like liquid heat. Her entire being felt like lead yet like nothing at all, and she so desperately wished she still had Angela's soothing grip around her hand. \"Hey, you're upsettin' the lady. Get outta here, man,\" the cashier snarled at Chickie, making a 'shoo' motion with his hand. Chickie sneered resentfully. \"Hey, you know how broads are-\" \"Just get outta here before I call the fuzz,\" the cashier snapped, sliding Angela's change across the counter. \"Here you go, miss.\" \"Thank you,\" Angela said quietly, taking Natalie by the arm again as the duo practically sprinted out of the suddenly sinister convenience store. \"You okay?\" Angela softly asked, placing a calming hand on the small of Natalie's back. Natalie briskly nodded, holding back the tears prickling at the corners of her eyes. She refused to let Angela see her cry. She couldn't bear the thought of Angela seeing that- \"Oh, honey, it's okay,\" Angela whispered, and before Natalie could say another word, the tall brunette embraced her. Natalie paused for a brief moment, unsure of how to respond to Angela's comforting hold. She shook her head, clearing her mind of any and all thoughts as she returned Angela's hug, letting out a tremulous breath. As much as she didn't want to admit it, she needed it. \"Feelin' okay?\" Angela asked after a minute or so, warmly patting Natalie on the back. \"Real okay,\" was Natalie's mildly muffled response before she slowly pulled away from the kind hearted beauty. \"I mean…\" Angela's soft, loving voice trailed off. \"No one wants to deal wit' him, really. He thinks he's a hot-shot, but I ain't gotta tell you that,\" the brunette sardonically continued, patting Natalie on the back. \"'Sides, I think you me and you could both go without that mental picture o' Robert and Jewel,\" Angela said with a laugh, lightly elbowing Natalie in the side as the duo walked along the sidewalk. Natalie shuddered, suppressing the sudden urge to gag. \"You're right, I ain't gotta think about that,\" the ginger groaned with a roll of her eyes. Angela heartily chuckled, the light, ethereal sound echoing throughout the empty South Philly streets. It was the most beautiful thing Natalie had ever heard. \"You're a funny one, you know that?\" Angela said after a moment, turning to Natalie with a bright, jovial smile. Natalie awkwardly laughed, shying away from Angela so she wouldn't see her furiously blushing underneath her winter hat. Some time later, the duo made their way back to the Balboa house. \"You think they know we left?\" Angela asked, plopping down on the stairs leading up to the shoddy row home. \"I dunno, maybe,\" Natalie deadpanned, her hand tentatively reaching for the doorknob. Natalie paused. Frankly, going back into the obnoxious, unfathomably loud hustle and bustle of the Balboa household didn't sound particularly fun. Come to think of it, she'd much rather sit out here with Angela, drinking cherry sodas and staring at the stars until the clock hit midnight. \"You wanna sit out here?\" Angela asked, almost as if she could read the hesitant ginger's mind. Natalie jovially grinned. \"Sure.\" Natalie made her way over to the top of the stairs where Angela sat, carefully lowering herself next to the tall brunette. \"Pretty cold out here, huh?\" Angela said after a moment, raising her cherry soda to her lips. \"Oh, yeah, it's freezing,\" Natalie replied with a laugh, hugging her knees to her chest. She gave Angela a grin as she grabbed her soda can, gesturing it towards the brunette in a 'cheers' motion. Angela playfully swatted her hand away, letting out another laugh. Natalie shrugged, popping open the tab of the soda can. \"I'm sure this ice cold cherry soda will warm me up,\" Natalie sarcastically drawled, lightly elbowing Angela in the side. \"Yeah, nothing like a cherry soda to warm you up in freezin' cold weather, am I right, or am I right?\" Angela responded, taking a swig. There was a long, long pause between the two girls before Angela spoke. \"So, Natalie,\" she said, setting down her can of soda. She rested her elbows on her knees, leaning towards the fiery haired teenager. \"Tell me everythin' about you.\" Natalie blinked, mildly taken back by the teenager's brash, unexpected request of her. She blinked, her lips slightly parted in surprise. Angela clearly wasn't one to mince words, that had been evident from the moment they met. Natalie was briefly lost for words, unable to think. \"Well, uh…\" The red haired teenager moistened her bottom lip thoughtfully before turning back to Angela. \"Well, my grandpa was Mighty Mick, but you know that, and, uh, my granny was about… twenty years younger than he was, and they had my mother when she was forty and he was sixty, somethin' like that, I don't know all the details. My mama had me when she was eighteen, but, but my father never stuck around, really. He hit the road when I turned one, and he ain't never looked back,\" Natalie rambled, suddenly breathless from her rant. \"And, uh, my mother… she, y'know, died when I was three-\" Natalie pushed past the lump beginning to form within her throat, averting her gaze away from Angela. \"So, y'know, my granny and grandpa raised me. Grandpa treated me like one of his own. Everybody'd rag on him for it, no one thought of Mighty Mick Goldmill as the lovin' type, but… he was my grandpa. And, y'know, I loved him a lot. But…\" This was were shit got rough for Natalie. Sure, she could push past her mother's death like it was nothin', but when it came to her grandfather packing up and leaving… \"He left. I was maybe five or six, again, I don't remember all the details, when he up and left to move in with the Italian Stallion,\" Natalie continued, jerking her thumb towards the direction of the house behind them. \"And… I was alone. Sure, I had my granny, but she wasn't exactly about the whole knitting and baking cookies thing,\" Natalie continued, giving Angela a half hearted, toneless laugh. More like the pimp out your granddaughter and beat up on her when you're drunk kind of thing. \"So, y'know how it is. I grew up, went to school, and pretty much lived off the radar 'til now. Livin' with a world class legend gets you a lot of attention, believe me,\" Natalie said, intentionally leaving out the filthier parts of her life story. Underage prostitution was not exactly a good conversation topic. Angela moistened her bottom lip, her gaze drifting over Natalie not unlike it had when they had first left. \"Sounds like you've lived an interestin' life, Natalie Goldmill,\" Angela said after a moment, slowly nodding her head. Her eyes shone with emotions that Natalie could not pinpoint before she scooted closer to Natalie, her hand eventually finding a place on Natalie's leg. Electricity danced across Natalie's skin, a sharp contrast to the ice cold air. Their eyes locked. Green to blue, blue to green. Robert threw open the door, practically tearing it off its hinges. \"Come on, you guys, the countdown's starting!\" the teenager shouted, quickly darting back in to the house as fast as he came out. Oh, God. Natalie steeled herself. This is it. \"10!\" The delirious, intoxicated yells of the party goers echoed throughout the empty South Philadelphia streets. \"9!\" Nine seconds. Nine seconds to make a fucking decision, Natalie. \"8!\" Eight seconds. Eight seconds until their lips would meet, or eight seconds until Angela would walk away from her and her fairytale fantasy dream would be crushed. \"7!\" Seven seconds. Angela. Angela was all Natalie could think about. Long, dark hair. Piercing green eyes. Jawline that could cut glass. The most beautiful girl in all of Philadelphia. \"6!\" Natalie's heart raced. This was it. This was it, make it or break it. \"5!\" You have to kiss her. \"4!\" Kiss her. You have to kiss her, you have to. \"3!\" This girl could be the love of your life, you gotta kiss her. \"2!\" Kiss her now or you'll never forgive yourself. \"1!\" ….. Natalie's mind went blank. A surge of courage, a surge of lust, pulsated through her veins. Before she could stop herself, she leaned forward, took Angela's face in her hands, and kissed her square on the mouth. Angela tasted of cherry soda and spearmint. Natalie had never tasted anything better, anything. Her hands tangled themselves in Angela's beautiful brunette locks, pulling the teenager even closer. It was a kiss full of passion. Of love. Of hopes, promises, and dreams. It was a beautiful, beautiful kiss. When they finally pulled away from each other, both panting heavily, flushed in the face, and sporting red tinged, kiss bruised lips, it was far past midnight. Which meant.. far past their ethereal, perfect moment. Angela smirked. \"Natalie Goldmill, I like you,\" she said matter of factly. \"Come and find me sometime.\" Angela got up, brushed herself off, and walked away. Natalie sat there for a moment, perfectly still and silent. \"Please don't let that be the last time I kiss you,\" Natalie whispered, staring at Angela's figure until she walked out of sight, into the empty void of the South Philly streets.

He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter One: The Lullaby The kingdom, for the first time in many years slept peacefully, for they once again had their princess back, though one soul could not rest, the princess herself. Little Ofelia, Moanna , she reminded herself, sat in her bedchamber, the fire lit the room faintly and filled it with warmth, but it didn't ease the child's small fears. The little fears that sit with you when you're in a new place, a strange unfamiliar place, where every shadow look like a figure and you can't tell what's what, though her room was beautiful. Her room was filled with warm colors of golds, reds and yellows. The fire place was carved from Marble and Ivory, with marking and statues of strange creatures and familiar ones, such as the Faun and his fairies. There were beautiful carpets that would put Persian's to shame and mahogany chests, dessers and wardrobes that reminded Moanna of warm chocolate. The ceiling was hail and vaulted and while the walls were paneled with the dark chocolate wood from the waist down and covered in a soft pale gold up, the ceiling itself was painted to look like a scene from one of Ofelia's, I mean, Moanna's story books. Moanna had been trying to get to sleep for a few hours now, but she just couldn't sleep. Everything was still so new and Moanna was still had a bit of Ofelia still in her, she still hadn't gotten all of her memories back, though she recognized her true mother and father after a while and could feel that they loved and had missed her dearly, she still couldn't remember any times she might have spent with them. So there she sat in the middle of her bed, her large book in lap that her dear friend the Faun had given her, looking though all the stories and pictures it painted for her. Hoping she could remember something, anything. It wasn't long before a familiar shadow crept into her room. She looked up, a smile alright planted on her pale face. \"Faun!\" she gasped softly and jumped up to hug her dear friend, who accepted it without a second thought. \"Your Highness\" he spoke in his soft, ancient voice that reminded Moanna of the trees. \"You are still up?\" he asked, stroking her soft ebony hair and holding her chin. She smiled sadly and nodded. \"I can't sleep\" she admitted softly, \"everything is so new and . . . I . . . I cannot remember anything Faun!\" Slowly Moanna dark eyes began to mist, she pulled away to wipe her eyes, sniffling a bit. \"I can't remember anything about my life here, all I remember is my life above, what if I can never remember?\" Moanna was becoming Ofelia once again, afraid and crying because she didn't want to leave, she didn't want to be away from her new home and all alone. The Faun only smiled, he moved to hold the child, the faeries buzzing and chittering about as they too tried to coo their little princess. \"Now, now\" said the old faun, \"it has only been one day my princess, and your soul is very weak. Rest, my princess, in time your memories will come back. I promise\" he said, tapping her on the nose. Moanna sniffled a bit and wiped her eyes, but smiled at her dear friend and nodded. She moved to get back in bed and the faun tucked her in. \"D-do you know any lullabies?\" Moanna asked softly. The faun froze; his brow knitting as he thought back, way back to his youth but could not think of one lullaby for his princess. \"I am sorry princess but I know none\" he said as he made his way to the shadows, but seeing the disappointment on Moanna's face, he turned back. \"Actually, you highness, I may know of one\" he said, placing his hand on one of the bed post and holding up one of his wooden fingers. The faun moved to sit at her bed side; he began to hum softly, his old crooked hands brushing away her black hair as he began to sing; his voice deep and warm. \" Sleep, oh babe, for the red bee hums The silent twilight's fall Aoibheall from the gray rock comes To wrap the world in thrall A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy My love and heart's desire The crickets sing you a lullaby Beside the dying fire Dusk is drawn and the green man's thorn Is wreathed in rings of fog Siabhra sails his boat till morn Upon the starry bog A leanbhín ó, the paly moon Hath brimmed her cusp in dew And weeps to hear the sad sleep-tune I sing, my love, to you Sleep, oh babe, for the red bee hums The silent twilight's fall Aoibheall from the gray rock comes To wrap the world in thrall A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy My love and heart's desire The crickets sing you lullaby Beside the dying fire . . . \" The faun hummed softly as he ended the short lullaby, seeing Moanna had fallen asleep. The poor girl was more tired than she realized. The Faun smiled, leaning forward to plant a soft kiss upon the princess's forehead, so glad was he to have her back, to have her home. \"Sweet dreams, my Moanna\" he said softly before fading into the shadow. Hello Everyone! This is my first Pan's Labyrinth fan fiction so any comment is fine. I decided to work on one after reading a beautiful FF called 'To Wed a Faun' very good but rated M so careful kiddies. I'm gonna be pulling different mythologies in this one and will update every now and then. This story takes place after she arrives at the castle and follows up to a bit after she starts ruling, just an FYI, so it's going to be long and have a few drabbles here and there. Hope you all enjoy, will post soon :D[Chapter 2] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 02: The Library In the few weeks that past, Moanna felt herself feeling better in her new home. Yes her father was busy, but after losing his child to the world above, he hardly ever turned her away when Moanna wanted to speak to him, show him something she found, or show a picture she drew with Pan during her lessons. Speaking of which, they seem to be going well. Right away Pan was made to be Moanna's instructor and she took to learning like a duck takes to water. Moanna was fairly content with snuggling up to Pan with a book in her hands as they read together and learned about the world, important people and creatures. Creatures that would help her, creatures to avoid and some creatures that Pan would show her later in life. Some books Pan had to read to her, they were in a language that looked familiar but she couldn't quite read. It was the Fae language which looked like a mixture of Gaelic and Latin. Turning through one of the books, Moanna was showed a beautiful picture of one of the most gorgeous women she had ever seen. She look to be made of light almost and glowed with vibrant beauty. She had white eyes with flowing golden, almost white, hair and was surround by the forest and its creatures. Moanna made Pan pause as she looked over the picture. \"That is Aoibheall, your highness\" \"Ah-Veel?\" Moanna tried to pronounce. \"She is very pretty\". Pan nodded, \"she has great power, little one, and ruler of the northern lands from here\" \"There are other kingdoms?\" Pan nodded once again, his wild mane falling onto her head and shoulders. Moanna was starting to notice that, ever since she had arrived, the kingdom had been getting brighter. It was bright when she arrived but everyone seemed so happy and Pan was changing. Not drastically, little things at first, like she noticed his broken horn was fixed when she came back. His hair was getting more vibrant and body didn't shake as much as they first met. Moanna giggled and playfully tugged at it, making her old goat shake his big horned head and snort. He wasn't mad though, only smiled and tugged at her hair. \"How many Kingdoms?\" she asked curiously. \"There are four, including our own. Aoibheall lives at Carraig Liath\" Pan answered as they continued reading on. \"Moanna!\" It was late and both Pan and Moanna had been reading different books when her mother had walked up, holding her baby brother and a servant trailing behind. \"There you two are, you are both going to be late for dinner\" she smiled. Moanna was the first to get up and rush to her mother. Nuzzling into her robes as Pan placed the books upon a desk. \"Forgive me your Highness\" he bowed. \"We were both so involved in our lesson that we didn't realize it was late\". \"It's quite alright Faun\" she said stroking her daughter's hair with one hand while holding her brother with the other. \"Come we shall all dine together, the librarian can grab those books\" she said. \"Yes, Your Majesty\" The faun said, bowing his head and then following along the Queen, little Moanna holding his hand while they walked.

I'm half making this up as I go x3 lol.[Chapter 3] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 03: The Memories Of all the memories I could remember . . . why these memories? Moanna had awoken up to hear the screaming from her dream was reality and it was coming from her. The poor princess had been in the Kingdom a month, wondering when she would get her memories back and now wishing she hadn't. She shivered and her skin was drenched in sweat. Moanna felt like she couldn't get any air, sucking at it like a fish. It took a familiar wooden hand on her shoulder to get her to calm down. \"Faun!\" she cried, grabbing him and holding him as she cried and sobbed. Pan's heart broke, he hated seeing his princess like this and knew it would come, knew she had to remember eventually, he just hope the bad ones would come later. Moanna didn't want to remember but she did. She watched though her own point of view as she died . . . She was sitting, in a beautiful garden, watching as the fearies danced and sang in their chittery voices. She sang with them, clapping her hands, she saw golden hair fly about her. That wasn't her hair . . . was it? She could hear the happy chuffing noise of the faun, laughing and clapping his hands as well. It was so strange to see him, he almost shown like Aoibheall, he looked younger, his hair more vibrant and his eyes so bright, Moanna had wondered just how long had she been above. Pan had spoke but she couldn't remember what he said, then he had walked off, to get something . . . perhaps . . .That was when it began to turn into a nightmare. Moanna looked up to the sky, the twilight haze was purple and orange, a moon dancing along. She had sighed sadly, remembering how much she wanted to see the world above. She looked over, the faun was a few yards away, discussing something with her father. Moanna smirked. A peak . . . A peak of the world wouldn't hurt, would it? Moanna started to creep away. She heard Pan cry out to her and began to run. She ran along the towers, pass the mountain ranges. Pan was running after her but had lost sight of her. She remembered finding the stairs that led to the above world. She had paused for a moment, taking a look up to see how far she'd half to climb, before she heard Pan call out again. Quickly Moanna rushed up the stairs, faster and faster, she was giggling, smiling. So happy to finally get a peak of the above world. She came to door that would lead her out and just as she opened it. Bright light blinded her, burned her eyes so badly . . . She could remember pain and cold . . . she couldn't stop coughing . . . it hurt so much and she couldn't call of help. She couldn't call for Pan because she couldn't remember. It was so scary; dying was nothing like Ofelia's death. Dying was cold and dark, there was no light, no hope. . . Moanna shook in Pan's arms, \"It . . . it was so cold Faun\" she whimpered. Pan held her close, his ears falling back. He remembered that horrible day. He had left her only for a moment, only a moment and she had gotten away. He had tried to catch her, tried to save her but couldn't, he wasn't fast enough. Seeing her body . . . cold as ice and so pale. He almost died that day. Wanted to die, but the King, who was wise for such a young king, knew she'd be back. Knew her soul was still trapped there. Pan did nothing but search for her; countless times he had been too late. His Moanna had grown up and had children of her own, or was too old and soon to die once more. She was a flower once, he did his best to keep her safe but winter came early and killed her before he could see if it was truly her. He had failed but he wouldn't this time. \"Shhh . . . it's alright my princess\" he whispered softly, trying to calm her. \"I'm sorry . . . \"He whispered softly as she fell asleep. \"I'm so sorry my Moanna . . .\" Moanna fell asleep in Pan's arms, and he stayed by her side throughout the night. Hey guys thanks so much for the comments and reveiws, they really do help alot! Will write more later, see you all soon X3[Chapter 4] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 04: The Lord of the Wilds It had been a few days since Moanna's nightmare, she was still a little shaken, but Pan was able to get her to come outside. She didn't want to be alone. If she wasn't with Pan she was with her father, if not him then her mother, where she sat currently. Their castle was so large for being underground. It was like a large mound and they were inside it with spirals and towers that shot out from it, as well as bridges, walkways and gardens that lead to the mountains, plains and forest of their world. Moanna admired it all as she stood on the balcony of her mother's room. \"Moanna\" her mother called. She rushed up to her mother, crawling up in the bed with her and her little brother. He was so beautiful, a small, chubby baby with golden hair like her mother and dark eyes like her and her father. She wondered curiously if her hair would turn blonde or if maybe her father's hair was once black when he was younger. Her mother cuddled her closer, glad to finally have her two children back in her arms, she watched as Moanna looked at her brother with curious eyes. \"Was he born of the moon too?\" she asked. Her mother eyes rose up, she didn't expect that. \"No, he was . . . a surprise. Your father and I thought we could not produce another child. I am very barren\" she said sadly. \"I cannot have children easily\" she said when Moanna gave her a confused looked. \"Was that why I was born of the moon?\" Moanna asked. The Queen nodded, \"Your father and I wanted a child so badly. We had so much love to give\" she smiled and stroked her daughter's hair. \"But we could not bare a child. So we went to the Lord of the Wilds. Asked him to help us, but he said he couldn't, but he'd ask the moon to help us. It wasn't long after that, that the Lordo fthe Wilds visited us once again, a child in his arms. He said that the Moon had granted us our request. The mark on your shoulder proves you are of the moon\" she said. \"What's he like?\" she asked. \"Who?\" \"The Lord of the Wilds?\" Moanna asked. \"Well he is very old, and he mostly keeps to himself.\" She said. \"Sounds lonely\" she said, cuddling into her mother's side, closing her eyes. The Queen smiled, \"Perhaps, but he is a strange creature . . .\" \"Perhaps one day I shall go meet him, thank him for helping us and father\" Moanna smiled with a child-like joy. Her mother smiled back. \"Perhaps one day you can, when you're older and can walk in the forest on your own\" she said. Moanna spent the most of the day speaking with her mother and helping her with her baby brother, Cáel. They ate, and then Moanna was getting ready for bed when a familiar green fairy fly by to perch on her shoulder. Nuzzling into her hair, making the princess giggle. \"Ah! Your highness, she has grown fawn of you\" Moanna turned, smiling as Pan came into view from the shadows. \"Hello Faun\" she said watching as the fairy flew to land one of Pan's large curved horns. The old goat bowed gracefully this time, \"Shall I tell another story Your Highness?\" he asked, his old creaking body steeping over to her bed as Moanna got under the covers. \"Perhaps of Great Raja Naja of the dark seas? Or of the White Hart?\" \"No\" \"No?\" Moanna shook her head. \"I want to hear of the Lord of the Wilds\" she said holding the blankets on to her chin. Pan froze. \"The . . . Lord of the Wilds?\" Moanna nodded. \"Mother said he asked the moon to give birth to me, I'd like to meet him, thank him.\" Pan smiled and sat on the side of her bed. \"Ah well, the Lord of the Wilds is very old. Older than the forests! Older even than the mountains they root on!\" He started. \"He is an old creature who protects the forest and guides its creatures, but very secretive, I don't even know him that well\" Moanna was still giving him that look. That disappointed look, thinking she would never meet the 'Lord of the Wilds'. \"Ah, but do not so sad my princess!\" The faun said stroking her cheek. \"I do know that the Lord of the Wilds has always been watching you. I'm sure one day you will meet him. Perhaps even be able to thank him\" he chuckled as a fairy chattered and moved to rest in Moanna's pillows. She began to smile again and Pan was relieved, \"Shall I tell you some more stories? Until you fall asleep, Your highness?\" he asked tucking her in. To his surprise, she shook her head no. \"I think . . . I think I'll be ok\" she smiled snuggling up. \"As you wish . . .\" he said bowing. \"Faun!\" He turned right back around. \"Could . . . could she stay?\" Moanna asked point to the fairy that was snuggled in her pillows still. He nodded and bid her a good night before disappearing back into the shadows. Moanna was still afraid but fell asleep dreaming of what it would be like to meet the 'Lord of the Wilds'. Agh this chapter is kinda crap. But I wanted to get it out there before doing a time shift. Thank you again for all the reviews and favs! They do help![Chapter 5] The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry. He would watch her grown and watch her learn. Most importantly, he would watch helpless as he fell in love. . . Chapter 05: The Hiding Spot It had been a few more months and Moanna was finally settling into her life at the palace. She was also getting many lessons from Pan and even began to remember things again. Though, thankfully, none were quite as scary as the first time. She remembered people, names, places, things she and Pan would do like take walks in the gardens, the games they would play, she assumed that the Faun was some sort of care taker for her, as well as a teacher. They were studying right now, the Fea language. Though most Fea could speak most all languages, it was due to knowing Fea, the root language. Moanna was still trying to relearn it, though it was hard with her mind wandering. \"Your Highness?\" She looked up from the window, strange birds, more exotic than any of the world above, were flying by. \"Oh! Sorry faun\" she smiled and turned back to him. Pan smiled, she had such a fresh new look on the world. \"Mmm come on, faun. You've been teaching me all day, let's play a while\" Moanna said with excitement as she stood and tugged on his hand. \"Very well\" Pan said, closing his book and walking with Moanna to the several royal gardens. The gardens were alive with foliage and little creatures. Pan's odd eyes watched the small white hand that clung to his old wood one. He had missed his Princess, his heart ached when he was cruel to her in the world above, it rejoiced when she ran to his arms. \"Faun?\" Moanna's voice shook him from his memories. \"Turn around and close your eyes\" she giggled. Pan became wary instinctively. \"What for your Highness?\" he asked. \"Well we can't play 'hide and seek' if you're watching where I hide, can we?\" she said giggling. \"Now turn and count to ten\" she said, giving his belly a push, making the old goat grunt. Sighing, Pan reluctantly turned around, closing his wide eyes and began to count. His deep, creaky voice listing off the number from ten as Moanna took off to find a suitable hiding spot. She looked and looked, finally, near the edge of this garden there was a waterfall that lead to the next garden. Moanna quickly dashed down the steps that had been carved into the rocks and went to the water fall. It was perfect! The waterfall hid a cove that was huge to fit Moanna, the faun and even her family too. Moanna squealed as her side got misted from sneaking into the cove. About now, Pan had finished counting and began to 'look' for Moanna. He chuckled, well he sort of cheated, he followed his nose and his old, peach fuzzed ears listen for where she could be. Deep down he was worried, surely she wouldn't of headed for the surface again, would she? No, course not! He thoughts to himself. She remembered what happened to her when she did the first time. . . Her . . . her soul can't make a second trip up to the surface again. He thought with dread. When Pan finally reached the waterfall though, he froze, he couldn't smell Moanna anymore. The trail went cold, panic struck him hard. \"Your highness?\" He called out. Moanna heard Pan calling out and began to giggle and laugh, her faun clearly had no clue how to play hid and seek. Her giggles rose to Pan's keen hearing, he looked around, befuddled as to where she was. \"Princess?\" he called again, softer, looking among the rocks and brush. Glancing over the edge of the garden to the other he glanced curiously at the waterfall. His heavy hooves clopped down along the rock carved path, down to the small ledge that lead to Moanna new secret place. \"Your highness?\" he called ducking his huge horned head into the cove. Moanna giggled and popped up from behind a large rock. \"You are horrible at hide and seek\" she grinned, running up to hug Pan's waist, who sighed with relief. \"Then we must play something else\" he chuckled. Stroking his hand through her hair, \"come we will walk and let the sun dry us. I can show some of our worlds plants, what ones can heal and what ones can help you\" he smiled, leading her from the cold cove and shaking his body, much like a dog and making that high pinch noise that always made Moanna giggle. She took his gnarly hand tightly in her small hand, Pan giving it a squeeze as he lead her on to the next garden, pointing out flower that would cure wounds and bark to chew on when sick. He even showed her where the mandrakes grow. The day ending with Pan Sitting, curled around Moanna as she sat, leaning on his hip while weaving the small flowers and grass and making rings to place on Pan's head and horns. As she weaved they spoke, Moanna telling Pan and little bit of her life from the Surface. It wasn't all that bad, at least before her father had died. The children she played with, the kittens she would feed milk too and all the wonderful books she would read. Pan would smile and listen, helping her as she placed her own flowery wreath on her head, it was crocked and Pan adjusted it so, tapping her gently on the nose. They joked, laughed, told stories and finally ending the day with Moanna nestled against Pan's chest as he sang his little lullaby for her. He voice, deep and soothing. It sent her off into another world of dreams and wonders. While Moanna's ever watching guardian cradled her. \"A leanbhín ó, my child, my joy. My love and heart's desire\" He whispered softly as he carried her back to the castle. Thank you for all the reviews! Thank you so much! I'm working on so many things right now that it's gonna be a while till the next update, I'm sorry! But it'll be a sweet one. ~Irish Neko[Chapter 6] Chapter 06 The years past, in the blink of an eye it seemed for the old faun, Pan, watched his young highness grow into a young lady. The child of merely eight years old to a young princess of twelve, it was amazing how she went through the changes, though some traits stayed the same. Her hair stayed the same dark raven wing black, which was odd but no one question it. If anything Pan grew to like this color, her dark hair framed her white porcelain face beautifully as it grew to a long length, reaching all the way to her shoulder blades. Like the full moon on a dark, enchanted night. It was fascinating to watch her blend her dark hair and his golden auburn colored hair when she would braid them together, but slowly Moanna's powers grew. Yes, the young fae princess was slowly gaining the powers that the fae that she had only just started to use when she left to the surface. Moanna's powers was with the plant life. She was still new to it, but with concentration, Moanna could help flowers grow and make dying grass become healthy. Wasn't much, and she could only do so much before becoming tired, but Pan saw that she had a gift for it. Pan emerged from the shadows into the warm room of Moanna's . His body no longer creaked as grew healthier over the years. Though his skin still had the carved tattooed designs along his flesh, the hide itself soften and filled out. With the fae princess safe in their kingdom, he ran around, scouted and took care of the kingdom's land with far more care, as well as being Moanna's forever caregiver. His horns were thick and strong, no cracks, while his mane grew thicker and the golden hue shined. Pan smiled, wandering if Moanna would weave flowers through his mane once more. \"Faun!\" Moanna cried happily, seeing him appear in her mirror. Running and showing her new tiara, it wasn't so much new as it was finally passed to her from her mother. \"I'm so excited, I can't wait to see all the other fae kings and queens\" Moanna smiled. \"So much excitement, you'll start flying if you're not careful, Princess\" Pan chuckled and ears flickered. \"Come, let me comb your hair\" he cooed. Moanna nodded and sat on her little bench and watched as Pan walked up behind her and started to comb her dark locks. \"There will be princes there too\" she giggled. Pan stopped combing, only briefly before starting again, Moanna saw a look of distain on his face but in Pan's mind, the faun grew very protective and dare he say . . . jealous? To think that his Moanna was thinking of princes and not solely on her dear faun, it made the faun sizzle with rage at those princes. He snorted, \"They are frumpy creatures\" he lied, starting to braid her hair, taking the ribbons on her vanity desk and braiding them into it. \"Mother says I should try to play with them, the princess too\" she said looking up at her faun and smiling. \"Don't worry faun\" she cooed, \"You're still my best friend, ever\" she smiled and it made the anger that was in Faun's soul to vanish. He stroked her cheek and smiled back, leaning down to nuzzle her and hug her. \"As are you my dear Moanna\" he cooed. It made his heart ache, to think of the times he missed his sweet Princess. Pan finished up braiding Moanna's hair then led her down to celebration. It was one huge birthday party that was sure. The kings and queens of the East, West and especially the North! Moanna was so very scared when she first set eyes on who must be Aoibheall, the Queen of the Northern Kingdoms, she was white hair, not blonde, white and she practically glowed a soft aura of power. Her Husband was just as handsome and by her side was a boy. He was a bit older than Moanna, maybe fourteen, short white hair with the top pull back into a short ponytail. His eyes were ice blue and he spotted her first of his family and smiled. Moanna smiled back. The party ensued and Moanna met many people that day. Kings, Queens, creatures, Myths and various animals came to greet the youngest princess in the Kingdoms and welcome her to some of the few small steps to the fea realm. At twelve Moanna would start to learn not just how to use fea magic but to start helping her kingdom. Mind you, small things, but helping her people none the less. The children were nice to play with, the two other princesses were from the Western and Eastern Kingdoms. They were nice enough, but their older Brother's like to tease and play, it made Moanna giggle as one made the girl's hair freeze. Moanna had gotten a few gifts as well. A beautiful quill and ink set, scrolls and new books, as well as beautiful dresses and even a quilt. Looking outside Moanna saw that some of Pan's fearies floating about, dancing and motioning her to come with them. She smiled and was able to get away. Out on the porch the fearies floated around a gift for Moanna. It was, well she had never seen it before, it was group of wood pipes, all different sizes. Moanna picked it up and looked at it curiously, It was lovely orange color with lovely carvings in a language that Moanna could not read. Blowing on the pipes, it made noise. \"It's a Pan Flute.\" Moanna gasped and turned around to see the Northern Prince. She stayed silent as he stood there The fearies were hiding behind Moanna, they didn't seem to like the prince but didn't mind him. \"You . . . um . . . you play it\" he said looking at Moanna. The both stood in an awkward silence Moanna large eyes looking at the boy when spoke up. \"I . . . I um . . . I like your hair!\" He said blushing. Moanna blushed as well. \"Thank you . . . do you know how to play?\" she asked showing him the reed. He nodded \"I sort of know\" he said and showed her how to hold it. \"Then you blow in a reed for each note. The smaller ones are high notes I think . . .\" Moanna began to play it, she was terrible and mostly making noise but she smiled at the flute and looked up at the boy. \"Thank you . . . what's your name?\" The boy laughed. \"Cian\". \"You're Highness?\" Spoke the faun as he step into view. Both young royals looked up at him. \"You are both missing the celebration, I think we should head indoors\" she said, stroking Moanna's hair. As he lead them inside. Moanna holding her flute close. It was later on in the night, after the celebration had calmed down and people were getting ready for bed, Moanna sat up in bed, trying to play her flute. Pan sat with her, watching and grimacing with she hit and bad note . . . which was a lot. His ears were ringing after awhile. \"Perhaps you should try practicing tomorrow princess?\" Pan moved to start tucking her into bed, she gave him her flute and he put it away with loving care. \"Thank you for the flute faun, I'm not very good at it though\" the princess spoke sadly but perked up as her faun friend laughed deeply. \"You are learning, I shall get my own come tomorrow and we will learn together\" he smiled. Moanna grinned and cuddled into the blankets. \"Alright, tomorrow, we'll start\". ","Summary":" The Princess and the Faun He would watch her smile, he would watch her cry.

She opens her eyes and instantly sits up in bed. She puts her hearing aids in and grabbed the baby monitor off of the nightstand. She hears Amara making cooing noises and goes to check on her. She opens the slide door and sees Adonis holding their baby girl in his strong built arms. He turns around and smiles when he sees her. Two months apart has the both of them looking far different from who they were before. \"Hey.\" \"Hi. When did you get here?\" She says walking towards him. \"A couple of minutes ago. She's gotten so big.\" He looks down at his daughter and he let's her hold his pinky finger. \"Yeah, so have you.\" She points out his biceps and triceps growth. \"You kind of look like a hulked out teddy bear holding her.\" \"Well she likes it so I'll take it.\" He say, making her laugh. \"I wanted to see my girls before I leave and talk with you.\" He puts Amara back in her crib and he takes Bianca's hand as they sneak out of the room. They walk over to their bedroom and he sits her down in front of him. \"So what did you want to talk about?\" He gets on one knee and takes her hands in his. \"I know that I've asked so much of you and made so many promises that I've been trying to keep. We've been a team for so long and I've been acting like I'm running solo and for that I'm sorry.\" \"D, we talked about this. I've had your back and I still got your back.\" \"Yeah but I haven't had yours. You've been taking care of Amara and I've been closed off through this whole thing when we should be getting through this together. I'm not going to leave you hanging. I don't want to be that husband that just goes on the road and never be there for his wife or his kid. I will always be in your corner like you're always in mine. And that's why I want to give you this.\" He hands her folded pieces of paper. She opens it and sees that it's the lyrics to the song she wrote in the studio before he left. \"Where did you find this?\" \"When I was packing. I read it and it was dope. I instantly thought about people hearing your voice and figured why not give you that moment in Moscow.\" \"You want me to sing at the match? In a whole stadium of people?\" \"As my walk in song. I know you only have a couple more years left and I know you want to be independent-\" He's cut off by her kissing him. \"This is the most amazing thing you've ever done for me other than get me pregnant.\" She says in excitement as she kissed his face. \"So I'm guessing that's a yes?\" \"Yes. I was gonna go and surprise you there but this beats that.\" She kisses him deeply and he held her in his arms. \"There's just one thing you gotta do before we go.\" \"Anything.\" \"Marry me.\" \"Uhhh, we're kind of already doing that.\" He holds her left hand where her engagement ring was on her finger. \"I mean let's get married right now.\" \"Like today now?\" \"Today, tomorrow at the court house or Vegas. I don't want a big wedding, I just want to be your wife.\" \"Is that what you want?\" \"You're all I want.\" She says and he smiles. He kisses her and they fall back on the bed together. \"Babe, what about your legs?\" \"We have two weeks, we're good for one night.\" He takes off his whitebeater shirt and starts kissing her neck. They haven't been intimate in three months so the sexual tension was present between them. \"Okay.\" She wraps her arms around his shoulders and her legs around his waist. \"I missed you so much.\" \"I missed you too.\" He pulls her shirt off and kisses down her stomach. He's about to unbutton her jeans when they hear a cry from the baby monitor. They pause and sigh at the sudden interuption. \"Looks like your other girl calling you.\" She laughs rubbing his head. \"To be continued.\" He says and kisses her lips before sitting back up. He walks to the door and Bianca sits up on her elbows. \"I love you dork.\" \"Love you too.\"[Chapter 2] Adonis and Bianca sat in the ENT's office while Amara was asleep in a stroller in between them. They listen to the doctor talk to them about Amara's treatment and they were lost in all the medical terms and visuals they were given. \"Can you explain it one more time for us?\" He asks the doctor. \"Amara hearing loss is sensorineural, meaning she can only hear small sounds audiotory noise. What we're going to put these little hearing aids around her ears so she can be able to hear.\" \"And this will help her hear? \"Yes. She'll be able to hear small and loud sounds and react to them the same way as any other baby would.\" \"What about her development?\" Bianaca asks her. \"Right now, she's on track with at this stage of developing. The hearing aids will keep her track on track and with some therapy, she'll be fine. I'll give you two a minute while I get the nurse to bring her in.\" She steps out of the room and closes the door to give them some privacy. Donnie lets out a sigh of relief and sits back in his seat. He turns to his right and sees Bianca crying. He gets out of his chair and goes onto his knees in front of her. \"Baby, please don't cry. She's gonna be fine.\" He wipes her tears away from her eyes. \"I'm sorry.\" She sniffles her noise. \"What are you sorry for?\" \"I did this to her. I gave you a disabled baby and she is going to have it so hard.\" She looks over at her baby and puts her hand on top of her head. Donnie puts is hands on the sides of her face and turns it to look at his. \"Listen to me, you did not burden our daughter. She is going to live a happy and amazing life. She's gonna have that because her mother is the most selfless, brave, and strongest woman I've met in my life. And she's got a dad who will kick any guys ass who breaks her heart or try to mess with her.\" She laughs at his words. She smiles and kisses him, resting her forehead and breathes slowly. \"You're really good at this husband thing.\" \"I'm trying. We're gonna be alright.\" He holds her hands and kisses them. \"We got this.\" \"Okay.\" She hugs him and rests her head on his shoulder. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\"He kisses her shoulder and turns his head to see Amara opening her eyes. \"Looks whose up?\" \"Hey mama. How you doin?\" She unlatches her seat belt and takes her out of the stroller and onto her lap. \"Look at her, has no idea what's going on.\" \"She's gonna make it with a mom like you.\" \"You are such a sap you know that.\" \"You think it's cute.\" \"Yeah I do.\" She goes in to kiss him when Amara move her hand in between them. \"I can't kiss your mama Rara?\" \"You are such a daddy's girl huh?\" She kisses her chubby cheeks and hugs her tight.[Chapter 3] Bianca is in the bathroom undoing her braids and putting her hair in a bun with the sides of her hair on her face. She just got Amara to sleep and helped Donnie into bed and treated his broken rib. She finally got to take a shower and get herself ready for bed. She takes one of her birth control pills and drinks some water when she notices her husband behind her with his shirt off, only wearing his grey sweatpants and bandages wrapped around his waist. \"What are you doing out of bed?\" She says as she turns around and putts her hearing aid. Before she could get another word, he kisses her fiercely. \"What was that?\" She says catching her breathe. \"Catching up on lost time.\" He goes in to kiss her again but she pushes him back. \"Nah nah nah, you are not moving anything tonight. \"I can lay down.\" He wraps his arms around her and starts kissing her neck. \"The baby's asleep.\" She chuckles. \"She's in the other room. I got the monitor on in there.\" \"Baby\" She moves her neck and away and looks up at him. \"You almost died tonight. Almost didn't come back and got hit harder this time. You need to take it easy please.\" \"B, I thought I was never going to make it out of there. The only thing that kept me going was you. You keep me breathing and I never want to take that for granted ever again. We only so many moments left and I don't want to waste them. I love you so much and I want to show you how much I do. Whether it be just kissing you, or touching you, or making love to you.\" He presses his forehead against her kisses her forehead. She feels so much emotion just standing in front of each other. What he says relates to her as well, she can't breathe without him and she didn't want to miss any moments together. She moves her head up and kisses him deeply. She moves his hands to her sides and wrapped her arms around his neck. Donnie puts his hands under her thighs and lifts her up in the air. She wraps her legs around him and moans as he moved his hand toward her lower back. He walks out of the bathroom and into the bedroom, sitting on the side of the bed and laying down on his back and her on top of him. She straddles his lap and starts to undo the tie on her black robe. \"Tell me if you want me to stop okay.\" \"I promise. Just be careful.\" \"Okay. Shit, hang on.\" She reaches over to the night stand and grabs a condom in the drawer. \"Not taking any chances this time.\" She says making Donnie chuckle and he pulls her down and kisses her. Two Hours Later \"Hi.\" He looks at her as they lay on their sides after making love. \"Hi.\" She smiles at him back. He bites his lip a little, making her smirk. \"What?\" She laughs as she pushes her nose against his. \"You really know how to work a man.\" \"Fourteen weeks without you is too much for me to hold in.\" She says as she raises her leg over his side.\" You were putting in the work too.\" \"Like I said, I wanted to show you how much I love.\" He kisses her again. \"I missed you.\" \"I missed you too.\" She moves in closer into his arms and rests her head against his. \"You're so beautiful.\" He runs his hand through her hair and moves it down her leg. \"Easier tiger, we just beat our record. Let me get my oxygen back first.\" \"Alright.\" He held her close to him and they keep kissing until something pops into Donnie's head. \"B\" \"Yeah.\" She says as she kisses his neck. \"We haven't talked about if we wanted to have more kids.\" She stops and looks at him. \"This is not the kind of talking I saw having after what what we just did.\" \"I'm not asking to get pregnant again. We just need to have this talk and we can't keep avoiding it.\" \"I'm just scared. I don't know if I could go through it all again. Amara is best part of my life next to you but I going through all of that again. I just-\" \"No, I get it. I feel the same way. We don't have another one so soon. We can wait or adopt, I don't care how we get them. As long as we're their parents, that's all that matters.\" \"Thank you.\" She kisses and she moves over to get on top of him. \"Again?\" \"I told you, fourteen weeks is a lot of missed time.\" She kisses him again and is about to go lower when the monitor goes off. \"I got her.\" He says rubbing her shoulders. \"You sure?\" \"Yeah, I got. I'll bring her in here and she can sleep with us.\" He kisses her as she moves off his lap. He gets out of the bed and grabs his boxer briefs to put on. He pulls his sweatpants on when he catches Bianca looking at him. \"What you looking at nosey?\" \"Nothin, just admiring.\" She says as she lays on her stomach. \"I'm not a piece of meat.\" He jokes around. \"You sure about that?\" She chuckles as he kisses her. He walks out of the room and closes the door behind him. He walks into the next room and opens the door to find Amara crying in her bassinet. \"Hey Rara, it's okay baby daddy's here.\" He pick her up and rests her on his shoulder while holding her back with one hand, while grabbing her traveling bassinet with the other. She starts to fuss again and Adonis starts singing to her as they walk back to the main room. \" We're just ordinary people, maybe we should take it slow. Take it slow ow ow, maybe we should take it slow.\" She settles back down and he smiles at calming her down. He pushes the door open and sees Bianca sitting up in bed in a tank top, smiling from ear to ear. \"She has you wrapped around her finger.\" \"She really does.\" \"How is it that she loves you singing more than me?\" \"She's a daddy's girl.\" \"Well I call dibs on the next kid.\" \"You remember when I sang that song?\" He says as he puts her travel bassinet in the middle of the bed. \"I do. You tried to sing to me in hospital and I almost slapped you to shut you up.\" She laughs. \"At least somebody likes my singing.\" He says putting Amara in the bed. \"Baby I do. I just wished she liked my singing.\" She says laying on her side and rubbing her little belly. \"She'll ease into it.\" He gets into bed and lies down on his back with his head turned to look at his wife and daughter. \"She loves you just as much as I do.\" He holds her hand across the bed and kisses it. They smile at each other and look at Amara sleeping until they fall asleep.[Chapter 4] \"Don, where the heck are we going?\" Bianca asks as they drive through Los Angelas. \"I told you it's a surprise when we get there.\" He says to her as he's at the wheel. \"I know this is your city but I kinda wanna know what I'm in for.\" She says as she checks on Amara in the back as she plays with her mobile attached to her car seat. \"I promise you'll love it.\" \"Okay Indiana Jones. Lead the way then.\" She sits back and looks out the window as he kept driving.\"D, I need to talk to you about something.\" \"Yeah?\" \"It's about the label. They gave me a release date for my album and they want me to go on tour with one of their new artists for promo.\" \"That's great. Who'd they want you working with?\" \"You heard of 6LACK?\" \"Yeah, he's dope. The both of you would sound great together.\" \"Yeah, he's gonna be a feature on the album too. The thing is it's gonna be a two month tour. Twenty four cities and I'll be working with some producers in Atlanta.\" \"Okay.\" \"I'm gonna have to take Amara with me since she's so little or she can stay with you. It's all still fresh on the table and a lot of stuff to work out.\" He pulls over on the side of a random street in a neighbourhood. \"B, you know that I'll ride with you on anything.\" \"But..\" She was ready for him to turn down the idea. \"I don't want you sacrificing your dream for me. This is your time now and I wanna be by your side through all of it.\" \"So your okay with the tour?\" \"I'm all for the tour with only one thing. We go as a family.\" \"What about boxing?\" \"It'll still be there. This is your turn now. This isn't me being jealous or paranoid. I want to be by your side.\" He holds her hand and she smiles at him. \"And you call me sappy.\" She laughs and leans over to kiss him.\"Thank you.\" She looks out the window at where they are. They're parked outside a well put two story house. \"Where are we?\" \"Our new house.\" \"Stop playin D. Why are we-\" He pulls out a pair of keys and holds them in front of her. \"You said we were gonna need space so I looked all over town until I found your dream house.\" \"Are you serious?\" \"Merry Christmas.\" She jumps out her seat and reaches over to hug him. She kisses him and and he laughs. \"Easy there's a baby in the back.\" She still kisses him. \"Thank you. I love you.\" \"I love you too. You wanna take a look inside?\" \"Hell yeah I do.\" They get out of the car and she takes the baby out of her car seat. They walk up the driveway and Donnie opens the door to the house. They look around the house with the hardwood flooring and fresh painted walls. \"This is huge.\" \"Do you like it so far?\" \"It's great. The kitchen is beautiful, the carpets, and the-\" She pauses when she looks out the window.\"Is that a pool outside?\" \"With a grill and a basketball net. Five bedrooms, four bathrooms, home office.\" He says as he wraps his arm around her shoulder. \"This is amazing.\" \"Go look around the corner for the best part.\" She walks through the living room into the den area. \"We can make this a little studio. What you think Rara?\" She says to her daughter and she raises her little hand up in the air. \"I think she likes the house.\" \"Home Sweet Home\" He wraps his arms around the two them. \"Things are gonna be different now. You and Amara are my number one.\" \"Good cause we missed you.\" \"Da-\" Amara spits out. \"Did she just say dada?\" \"Baby, she's four months old. She just talk in babbles right now.\" \"I'm counting it as a word.\" He kisses her cheeks, making her and the baby laugh. ","Summary":" Bianca is asleep when she hears the sound of the door closing.

Perhaps these two have inherited my mother's room. \"Does not itself saves\" - not out loud said the Sara sighed sadly and patted her on the head. Adrian straightened up immediately, but literally five seconds later her face grimaced, and she began to knead the neck, which seems to be asleep, as sleep won her over faster than she was able to take a comfortable position for yourself. - Good morning, Adri! - No. And what are you doing up so early? – she asked, gathering the papers in one pile. At other times your house not to catch me to talk to you need. What are you again worked all night? Look, just cut it wrong. How do you even go to a site like this? To be honest, JAX after a wild booze in the morning looks better. Maybe I'll take the day off? - Are you finished? Great. So stop trying to treat me, please. You see that I already boiled. If you have a burning desire to ride the sister on the brain, let's do this again, and I can't give you an exact guarantee that will allow you to do this. It's hard for me. I have a lot of work, an important thing that we can't reveal for the third month... And plus, each of your can't leave me alone. Unable to explain to him that with whom and how I spend my time is not his concern. And with whom he spends time - I don't care. We only had dinner once, and he himself is there something already invented. Nervously sneer, Adrian walked away, starting to clean myself up and get ready for work. Her wardrobe was not rich in bright colors, and she almost never wore, believing that she's not a clown, and the profession does not allow. But if this happened, you only used concealer to hide the circles under her eyes, mascara to emphasize the eyes and subtle lipstick. In this he and Sarah were like. By the way, she doesn't eat Breakfast really, except that when you work comes to a sister or friend. Sarah called her to the table pretty soon, and while she was making coffee, Adrian opened the window, pulling out a packet. Striking behind-the-Zhigalko, she set fire to it, inhaling and puffing grey smoke dispersing in the cool air. In her lungs again gets the poison, and what to do? Bad habits always come back. Seemingly as an afterthought Sarah again told my sister about my doubts about my husband, that divorce is somehow delayed. And yet it seemed to her that he has something illegal cranks behind them. - And from me what do you want? So I followed him or something, I don't understand. If so, then she somehow. I already have enough problems. \"How about that From me what do you want?\". I need your advice. - I'm afraid you won't like my advice. Don't stress yourself. And it will pass. Sara poured coffee from the cezve into a small thermos, which Adrian usually takes with him to work and smiled slightly. Literally a minute later the woman's phone number vibrated and brought to the display name of the partner. She again heard the phrase so used to hearing: - There's a dead body - he said the man wants you here. - A corpse is a corpse. Once called and said \"Harris, in the city of any murder, and I take your visyaki\". Okay, on my way. Dropping the call and stuffed the phone in his jacket pocket, Adrian sadly looked at her sister, making it clear that Breakfast is cancelled and she needs to leave. - We'll talk about it. Let's have lunch together today? Great! Shut the door herself. Taking the flask, and, having kissed her on the cheek, Adrian took the bag from the bench, threw on a jacket and hastily left the apartment. New day - new opportunities and... Corpses. - It's time to meet the morning not just in Boston, but in Boston mental hospital. It was the first and last time I participate in your scams, Clark! Look for another idiot and I have better things to do. And the car, by the way, I have! What the hell is going on? Maura hastily dressed, as she was soaked to the bone because she had the mouth of a suspect without transportation in such a heavy downpour. And the most funny thing in this situation was that this was not necessarily because his alibi was confirmed long ago, colleagues at work, security and the Secretary. John and Adrian personally checked that. Now on the scene have to go, but, having phoned to Harris, they agreed to meet directly at Jane, and together wait for its conclusion about the victim. - Well, I'm sorry! How did I know that this client is not interested in us anymore? They all did in my time off, and John let me know about it recently. Well, Maura! The woman, using the time to spare, turn up the kitchen partner the pots of coffee and put to cook it. Turned out really ugly. Teri is well aware of this. - Watts, well my bad, I admit. An unfortunate mistake, better go have your coffee, I almost welded. - My only annoying bug was that I had contacted you. When I began to help you when you fired. Since you just got on my neck. This. • And who said that being a detective is easy? It's pretty easy, but Mrs. Harris even more difficult – she has to gain respect from male colleagues. And not only her. But, anyway, she's a good COP, Despite being rude and sometimes ignores the rules. On the way to the scene, Harris was in a small tube, and that path seemed to be endless, had to choose the most unusual, but fastest route. Most likely found the girl's body who disappeared a few days ago, although Adrian would like this at the moment is the least. Plus, she could not forget the robbery at the bar of a friend a few days ago. She first acted as a witness. At least the rain is gone... - Why you didn't have weapons, Harris? - I, you know, on weekends when I go for a drink with friends, forget about the fact that I'm a COP And what these assholes want? A gunfight like in the movies? \"Thank God, among us was a COP\". PF. By the way, I apologized, and what she was thinking, when arguing with a guy who has a gun pointed at her head? Yes, I know that your gun is always with you. You are the brightest example for all of us, John! Okay, not talk about it. It's the smell. Here that mice or what are you cooking? - Here near the dump, specifically asked you to come here so you don't waste your time and not trying to drive there. We have in place. He quickly carried the woman to the scene, and began to enter in the course of the case, although information was not so much. After she asked to see the left wrist of the girl, which must be drawn tattoo feather. His glasses up, the woman concluded: Is Sidney Clarke a missing girl. Not missing anymore... One thing is for sure, she's not related to our Clark. - What is all this? Will you look at that and not argue with me on the cause of death? Call. - I am a forensic scientist? I will more precisely tell Jane, when surveys. We'll argue another time. Near the body were found some correspondence which has'? What do you mean why? So, at least, it will be possible to find out which container was the body. Look, detective, Wilson, and I question Mr. frost. Then tell me, what's the story with surveillance, why Maura is so jerky. Lunch with Sarah did not work, so how much time was spent on gathering information about the victim, and Jane didn't hurry, even when asked to accelerate with the examination of the victim. She was beaten to the point of exhaustion: had broken both cheekbones, bridge of nose... well, someone was really mad at her. But the husband of this lady crying well, I gotta give him that. Today Adrian and I decided to switch to John duty, as she had something planned, but to go unnoticed failed. She did not take a bag, as in her field of vision appeared the Isles detective from the robbery division. - I brought you lists of those who was late earlier, and I want you to look at. - Now is not the time! - It does not take much time. And I want to apologize for the other night. I just have never had the cops in front of witnesses. Perhaps I was a little pushy...I understand that you have a good reputation, but I already took the pictures. Just take a look. - Later, okay? I'm trying to solve a murder, among other things. Mrs. Harris frowned, pulling on his jacket and black-rimmed glasses. The last time she had bad eyesight. I'm trying to solve the case of the robbery of the bar your friend. You're a little tired or are you always like this? - I told you, I'll look later! I need to be in court. Goodbye. With these words she took his bag and hurried away, along the way picking up Sarah's number with a proposal to turn the dinner into a family dinner. The rain finally ended and more was pouring in buckets. It was Mrs. Harris on the arm. She smoked on the porch of the plot of one cigarette, while talking to Maura Watson – colleague, which is also none of the male colleagues did not take seriously, briefly discussed her interrogation, which took place an hour earlier, wished her a good shift and went to his car. Even a few minutes, she breathed in the cool air, and then sat behind the wheel, turned on my favorite radio station went home. Her evening, almost no different from some other days. Along the way she stopped at a supermarket and bought groceries to cook dinner and feed my sister, possibly a niece, but also lectures about the fact that if we eat some sandwiches and scones, you can earn gastritis, also to be fed. And standing in the mirror, she spoke to John. By the way, he was a partner Until they worked undercover. And when Adrian was just beginning his detective work, has become a good friend for her.. but that's weird that he didn't tell her all this when she was at the station. Ten minutes had passed. - John, well, leave me alone! I'm very tired, could we finish this later? Tomorrow, for example. If you ask me, you all write down, please, and I just don't have. Say what you want. You can use the default options. Horse or my Kingdom for this. In the aisles reasonable course. And thank you for help. While! Tube already seemed endless, and Harris decided to shorten the route, circling her a few yards, and she soon left on a road leading directly to her house. Park your car at the same place as always, Adrian quickly got out of the car, pulled out packages and tsokaya heels, hurried inside. Soon, the woman rose to the desired floor and, finally ,was home. Removing outerwear and shoes off and she went to the kitchen to put the food and little air. Though the street was cool, and the apartment at this time, it was terribly stuffy. In the analysis of the products never took a lot of time, because it never gained a lot since she lives alone and eats once a day, and that is, do not eat, but this time bought three times because I didn't know how her apartment late Sarah. Once in the family of some ambiguities, it is possible that she wants to go live with her. Just had to change clothes and to have dinner. Yes, but that's Harris-he rarely cooks, but order food somewhere she's not wanted, she decided to treat daughter with her cooking. And it hasn't even been an hour and a half before the bell rang on the door and Harris, wiping my hands with a towel, hurried to open, sneak peek through the peephole. - What kind of people! Adrian crossed his arms on his chest, letting the daughter in the apartment. Hey! Come on we need to Talk. Going to the kitchen and turning off the stove, Harris poured coffee in the coffee pot and began to set the table, parallel to looking at a daughter who was clearly intrigued. - I spoke with John. He'd be happy to help, but... In General, specifically to monitor your pious, no one will, we just don't have time for this right now. - Adri, well, you're a detective, you know, all sorts of things for tricks special. - And you be the judge, - sarcastically smiled Harris. - If I used my connections and methods before, would know what mom's coming to visit my boyfriend for a long time and would have nailed him. Yes it would have passed even. Although the court would have acquitted me. It would be cool if treason were tried. And that like this bastard. .Change, and then we in homicide are plowing around the clock. Everything. Closing the topic. No work. Adrian sympathetically smiled at his sister, but then changed drastically in the face. - Damn this leg I ever killing me. Maybe their relations will help me to get an x-ray queue? You said you have a friend doctor. Like after a broken leg came back to normal, but sometimes like ache... Maybe there is something together, huh? - Yes do not talk nonsense. You just spend days on the heels, and the load on the spine. - You and Jane spoke today? Well. Let's eat, okay? I'm very hungry. Go wash your hands. Sarah nodded in agreement, but Adrian, after seeing his sister's gaze, he continued to set the table.[Chapter 2] The next morning, Adrian agreed with her colleagues about checking the alibi of the husband of the victim, and now she was going on some working questions to the court, to the hospital, and then immediately decided to go to her partners. Throwing a jacket over her white blouse and jacket, the woman hastily changed from slippers to ballet shoes in ankle boots with high heels and hurriedly left the house. It's good that she had her own car, otherwise she would have spent much more time. In court, Harris did not last very long, because she only had a couple of working questions that were easily resolved, and family ties helped. But in the hospital she had to wait, despite the fact that Sarah arranged everything. But Adrian did not have a single extra minute. They waited for her and for a long time the whole phone was cut off. It was for this reason that Sarah turned off the sound. To talk on the phone with so many people she did not, so she consulted and learned the details only by SMS-messages. One pleased. It seems that the case, which they have opened so long, will finally be closed today, and it's really worth noting. This many detectives cost health, and Teri Clark even suffered a serious injury. Nervously tapping his heel against the tiled floor, Mrs. Harris watched the display of the phone every now and then to control the time. Almost two hours have passed. Really it is impossible somehow faster? Her criminals in the interrogation split faster than this turn. And leaving was uncomfortable, because Sarah negotiated. But when the next SMS came, the woman realized that her leg is not so worried. She gave her place in line to the young girl, gave her a smile and, clinking her heels, left these scenes. Harris rarely dispersed her car to such a speed, but now found it necessary as never before. The meeting place was Mr. Clark's house. When Adrian found her colleagues, she was quite surprised. John Terry and Frank were standing near the garbage dump where Mora was digging. - Search, come on! John grinned, grinning. \"You know what, if I find a corpse here, then I'll go home.\" \"Well, do not be angry, we need to find an address, okay?\" It is very important. The man remained standing with Teri, and Frank Tyler approached her, immediately starting to dedicate it to the course of the matter in more detail. - I went around all the tenants of the upper floors, and no one saw or heard anything. \"Well, then she was not killed here.\" Someone had to see or hear something. Calmly, Harris said, hiding her hands in her pockets. \"But here's the perfect place to hide the corpse.\" No cameras, no windows are all planned well. And clever. We need to check his alibi, and then again with him to talk. Okay, here we are finished, let's go. - Stop-stop-stop! Wait a minute, but what does it mean \"here we are finished?\" Why did I rummage in this container among the garbage? Anyone can explain this to me? - Really. And why did you do all this, Mora? I'm also very interested. Harris grinned. \"Clark said you asked me to do this!\" Laughing and covering her mouth with her hand, the woman hurried off to leave. \"I thought it would be funny!\" Also chuckling, the woman hurried after her colleagues. Well, that was her nature. She sincerely hoped that Mora would not long be angry with her. The woman's leg for a long time ached, and she already regretted that today went to work. It is possible that immediately after the interrogation, she would go to the boss and ask for time off to recharge. The holidays are still very far away, and she still needed, because something still has not been solved. The man was not against only one condition, if anyone submenu. But who? Shift change no one. Harris decided to deal with it later, and now she was headed in the box, which has long been waiting for her Mr. Clark, clearly not understanding why he was summoned here, and the team of detectives, in turn, clearly understood that the meeting with this man today is not the last. In any case, he had to tell how \"fast\" moves the investigation. Together with Sarah in the interrogation room came John. Just in case. Who knows what to expect from this man, and the well-being of women. Sarah was staggered. Container where you dumped your wife is on the other end of the city. And the message sent to your phone sent from the same area. And that's all you know? Not a lot. She was having an affair. I didn't think it's so important detail to tell us about it when we met for the first time. Now that she's gone, I don't want to think about such things. Okay, just tell me the name of the person with whom she was having an affair. Harris threw one leg over the other, so it was more convenient to sit to make notes in a notebook. - Matthew...Matthew Worth. You know where he lives? Maybe you know where he works? In the business centre. I'll text you the address. Listen, if you need to search my house or office, then just say so. - You heard that? Sarah glanced quickly in my partner. - Go to the address that you will say. Thank you, for today is all. And you know what, in such a case as this, the victim needs to know everything, so guys will take advantage of your offer. After interviewing Sarah went home, and Maura and John started to check the alibi of Mr. Clark. It's so weird, but they still do not know the murder scene. Usually it turns out in a matter of minutes, and then... Another plus the fact that Sarah lives alone – she can enjoy the solitude and silence not only for personal but also for business purposes. Anyway, she's a workaholic, and any time off ends up reading. Reading new cases. If the situation has not worsened, because she still does not sit out on sick leave. But if her car is taken away the daughter, it will jump to land on one foot. Still will wear heels. Now Harris changed into more comfortable home clothes, made herself some strong coffee and moved into the living room, creating a perfect working atmosphere. And to work in such silence is a pleasure. Placing his pack of cigarettes and a lighter next to the mug, the woman was wrapped in a warm blanket, put his feet up on the coffee table, making a small SIP from the mug and took up the study is not considered documentation. Sarah had no idea that she had accumulated so much. \"We need to carry it all to the station\" - he noted for the woman is not aloud, turning the page. In the same situation, Mrs. Harris spent about three hours. Coffee has long been empty, and the woman's eyes stuck together from tiredness. Quite without realizing it, Sarah fell asleep, not letting go of the folder and removing his glasses, in black frames. Soon the trill of the phone woke the woman and she slowly opened her eyes, trying to understand, where is the signal. The phone rang in the room, she had to rise to answer the call. - What are ringing, my friend? There was some kind of information? M, was arrested this jerk. Great, so the matter can be considered closed, and give strength to the murder of Sidney Clark. Yes, of course, note. Come! When finished with the job, Jane Smith came down to colleagues, so were also going to go to Sarah's house, but nobody was in a hurry to move. Then she sat down in the Desk chair Harris and spun it a few times. Teri was finishing the report, saying that she needed five more minutes, but Maura was already putting on makeup. - Well, you long have to wait? Clark, your five minutes are long gone. How do you not ashamed? Gear up. Snorted the woman, looking for double photo frame in which was inserted a photo with Tara, and another photo was shared. With a new year corporate party. It was a good time. It was a good company, it is a pity that now many who are in this picture, is no more. Definitely not in this Department. Many have received the translation and are now in another place, and someone even started a simple civilian life, leaving a high post. When the detectives finished with their work and had left their jobs as a husky male voice men, marching towards them in the company of a man or slightly older than Maura. That is, he was not more than forty. Thirty-five, maybe. He was holding a box of medium size. It was with this once came here for Adrian Harris. - Everyone stay in their seats, I did not let go! I need someone to submit. By the way, very good that you're here, Jane. The rest, I hope everything is in place? Harris went day! - scratched his head, blurted out John. – In our Department finally new? Glory to the egg, finally, you bitches can find justice, you really let himself go! - Robert Balboa! Had the man, glancing at his colleagues. But I'd rather you just called me rocky. I'm not used to the full name and abandoned it long ago. - John Wilson. Responsively had the detective. - The eternally dissatisfied – Jane Smith – forensic scientist, the best pathologist in Boston. This short – Maura Watson. A great specialist with a great hook. Well, this is Teri Clark. If she'll come to work with a bruise, don't be surprised, it's well deserved. Less at will. - And now will dedicate his new partner up to speed. The working day is still not over. And Harris tell that her time off is canceled, she's needed here. Tomorrow. - Thank God I'm not a detective! All the while! – with these words the woman hurried out, sending Adrian a TEXT, warning that she can't come for personal reasons. Such bases Harris obviously did not expect, and arrived to work the next day around noon, she slammed open the door leading into the division, quickly rising in the Elevator to your floor. - Good morning, detective Harris. Late no good. Without you the person interrogated. - Burn in hell, creature! – hissed the woman, heading to his working place, trying not to limp. – Was it difficult to warn that you are coming so I wasn't expecting anyone like an idiot. And why do I know that I need some damn report from the boss, not from you? It was impossible to call!? Jane, you could not FREE to add a few words? That's right. Go, go upstairs to your room. - I understand that Adrian Harris is that you? I confess, I pictured you a little differently. Somehow older or something. Sam asked me to come over to him as soon as you appear in the workplace. Most likely, you want to remove from the case that you are doing, and hands it to me. The man smiled, hurriedly leaving of colleagues, having decided to go and have a coffee. Gimme fifty, Maura, I'm told that Harris did not bring this matter to an end. But...um... who is he? What the hell is he here... Perfect! Only one day I wasn't here, and they are doing...I to the boss, and if he tells me what I don't like, send to hospital send, I... I haven't figured out what I'll do with you, but it will be scary![Chapter 3] \"New day - new opportunities.\" These words Adrian says to himself every morning when he wakes up, but today something went wrong. Maybe it's the weather. Monday morning is not pleased with the people of Boston in good weather instead of the sun, as promised by weather forecasters, was a strong rain. Hardly anyone on their own would come out of the house when this is happening, but still working and other things are not postponed just because it is raining. Mrs. Harris didn't need an alarm clock developed over the years reflex, worked a hundred times better than him, and any other day she would have long raced to work, but not today. It did not even awakened by a rustling in the hallway. Sarah came into the apartment and threw the keys on the nightstand. You're home, SIS? She ran from room to room and then went into the kitchen to find sister at the kitchen table. The woman was asleep, his head in his hands and judging by the turned off laptop scattered across the table, the papers and the unfinished coffee, she again worked all night. In this woman's life was happening in the moment a lot of, basically all these experiences are related to work, and Harris is well understood and in any case not condemned sister, though this also occasionally happened. His dissatisfaction with judge Harris is usually expressed immediately and did not hesitate in expressions. Perhaps these two have inherited my mother's room. \"Does not itself saves\" - not out loud said the Sara sighed sadly and patted her on the head.

She smoked on the porch of the plot of one cigarette, while talking to Maura Watson – colleague, which is also none of the male colleagues did not take seriously, briefly discussed her interrogation, which took place an hour earlier, wished her a good shift and went to his car. Even a few minutes, she breathed in the cool air, and then sat behind the wheel, turned on my favorite radio station went home. Her evening, almost no different from some other days. Along the way she stopped at a supermarket and bought groceries to cook dinner and feed my sister, possibly a niece, but also lectures about the fact that if we eat some sandwiches and scones, you can earn gastritis, also to be fed. And standing in the mirror, she spoke to John. By the way, he was a partner Until they worked undercover. And when Adrian was just beginning his detective work, has become a good friend for her.. but that's weird that he didn't tell her all this when she was at the station. Ten minutes had passed. - John, well, leave me alone! I'm very tired, could we finish this later? Tomorrow, for example. If you ask me, you all write down, please, and I just don't have. Say what you want. You can use the default options. Horse or my Kingdom for this. In the aisles reasonable course. And thank you for help. While! Tube already seemed endless, and Harris decided to shorten the route, circling her a few yards, and she soon left on a road leading directly to her house. Park your car at the same place as always, Adrian quickly got out of the car, pulled out packages and tsokaya heels, hurried inside. Soon, the woman rose to the desired floor and, finally ,was home. Removing outerwear and shoes off and she went to the kitchen to put the food and little air. Though the street was cool, and the apartment at this time, it was terribly stuffy. In the analysis of the products never took a lot of time, because it never gained a lot since she lives alone and eats once a day, and that is, do not eat, but this time bought three times because I didn't know how her apartment late Sarah. Once in the family of some ambiguities, it is possible that she wants to go live with her. Just had to change clothes and to have dinner. Yes, but that's Harris-he rarely cooks, but order food somewhere she's not wanted, she decided to treat daughter with her cooking. And it hasn't even been an hour and a half before the bell rang on the door and Harris, wiping my hands with a towel, hurried to open, sneak peek through the peephole. - What kind of people! Adrian crossed his arms on his chest, letting the daughter in the apartment. Hey! Come on we need to Talk. Going to the kitchen and turning off the stove, Harris poured coffee in the coffee pot and began to set the table, parallel to looking at a daughter who was clearly intrigued. - I spoke with John. He'd be happy to help, but... In General, specifically to monitor your pious, no one will, we just don't have time for this right now. - Adri, well, you're a detective, you know, all sorts of things for tricks special. - And you be the judge, - sarcastically smiled Harris. - If I used my connections and methods before, would know what mom's coming to visit my boyfriend for a long time and would have nailed him. Yes it would have passed even. Although the court would have acquitted me. It would be cool if treason were tried. And that like this bastard. .Change, and then we in homicide are plowing around the clock. Everything. Closing the topic. No work. Adrian sympathetically smiled at his sister, but then changed drastically in the face. - Damn this leg I ever killing me. Maybe their relations will help me to get an x-ray queue? You said you have a friend doctor. Like after a broken leg came back to normal, but sometimes like ache... Maybe there is something together, huh? - Yes do not talk nonsense. You just spend days on the heels, and the load on the spine. - You and Jane spoke today? Well. Let's eat, okay? I'm very hungry. Go wash your hands. Sarah nodded in agreement, but Adrian, after seeing his sister's gaze, he continued to set the table.[Chapter 4] The woman's foot ached for a long, long time, and Adrian was already sorry that today she went to work. It is possible that immediately after the interrogation, she will go to the boss and ask for a day off to gain strength. Before the holiday, it's still very far away, and the forces will still be needed for it, because no one else has disclosed the matter. The man was not against only on one condition, if someone replaces her. Just who? There is no one to change on duty. Harris decided to deal with this later, and now she was going to the interrogation room, where Mr Clark had been waiting for her for a long time, clearly not understanding why he had been called here again, and the detective team, in turn, clearly understood that the meeting with this man was far away today Not the last. In any case, he needed to report how quickly the investigation was moving. Together with Harris John came to the interrogation room. Just in case. Who knows what to expect from this man, and from the well-being of a woman. Adrian walked limp and staggered. \"The container where your wife's body was thrown is at the other end of the city.\" And the message sent to your phone is sent from the same area. \"Is that all you learned?\" Not much. She had an affair. I did not think that this is so important an detail to report this when we first met. Now that she is gone, I do not want to remember such things. \"Okay, just tell me the name of the person she was having an affair with.\" Harris tossed her leg to her leg, so she could sit more and make notes on the pad. \"Matthew ... Matthew Worth.\" \"Do you know where he lives?\" Maybe you know where he works? - In the business center. I'll write you the address. Look, if you need to search my house or office, then just say so. \"Did you hear everything?\" \"Adrian shot her eyes at her partner. \"You'll go to the address they tell you.\" Thank you, for now that's all. And you know what, in a business like this, you need to know everything about the victim, so the guys will take advantage of your offer. Immediately after the questioning, Adrian went home, and Mora and John began to check Mr. Clark's testimony. This is so strange, but they still do not know the place of the murder. Usually this is revealed in a few minutes, but here ... Another plus of the fact that Harris lives alone - she can enjoy solitude and silence, not only for personal, but also for working purposes. Be that as it may, she is a workaholic, and any time off comes to an end with reading. Reading new cases. If only her situation has not worsened, because she still does not sit out on the sick-list. And if her car is taken by her sister, she jumps to the site on one leg. He'll put on his heels too. Now Harris changed into more comfortable home clothes, welded strong coffee and moved to the living room, creating an ideal working atmosphere. And to work in such silence is a pleasure. Having put a pack of cigarettes and a lighter next to the mug, the woman wrapped herself in a warm blanket, stretched her legs on the coffee table, taking a sip from the mug, and began to study the documents that had not been examined. Adrian did not even imagine that she had accumulated so much. \"We need to transport all this to the site,\" she said, not out loud, leafing through the page. In the same situation Mrs. Harris stayed for about three hours. A mug of coffee had long since emptied, and the woman's eyes were sticky with fatigue. Without even noticing, she began to fall asleep, not letting go of the folder and not taking off her glasses in a black frame. Soon the phone's trill woke the woman, and she slowly opened her eyes, trying to understand where the signal was coming from. The phone rang in the room, she had to get up to answer the call. \"What are you ringing for, my friend?\" Did you see any information? M, detained this bastard. Great, then, the case can be considered closed, and completely give up the power to kill Sidney Clark. Yes, of course, we will note. Come! Having finished with the work, Jane Smith went down to her colleagues, as she was also going to go to Adrian, but no one was particularly in a hurry to come forward. Then she sat down in the working chair Harris and scrolled it several times. Teri finished the report, saying that she needed another five minutes, and Mora was already adjusting her makeup. \"Well, are you waiting for a long time?\" Clark, your five minutes have passed. How in general are not you ashamed? Accelerate. The woman sniffed, looking at the double frame for photos, in which was inserted a photo with Sarah, and another photo was shared. Since the New Year's corporate. It was a good time. It was a good company, it's a pity that now many who are in this photo are no more. More precisely not in this department. Many have received the translation, and now they serve elsewhere, and some have started a simple civil life altogether, leaving a high post. When the detectives finally finished with their own affairs and had already left their jobs, like the hoarse male voice of a man walking toward them in the company of a man who was almost no older than Mora. That is, he was no more than forty. Thirty-five, maybe. He was holding a box of medium size. It was with this once came here Adrian Harris. - Everyone stay in their places, I did not let anyone go! I need ","Summary":" \"New day - new opportunities.\" These words Adrian says to himself every morning when he wakes up,"},{"Movie":"Rocky","Title":"No Matter What","Author":"markaleen","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12356151","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Adrian sat in the library curled up in her favorite chair by the fireplace. The library was her room. Rocky had his gym, and Robert had his playroom. No one was barred from visiting the other rooms, of course. The others just didn't happen by often. Right now, Adrian was glad of this. Today Rocky would board a plane for Russia. Even though it'd been a couple of days since she heard about the fight thanks to the mob of reporters surrounding the house, the thought still made her feel as sick now as it did then. Aside from her wish for Rocky to stay home, what she wanted more than anything was a nap. To her dismay, he was in their bedroom packing. She'd barely spoken to him since their argument a couple nights back. What almost bothered her more than the possibility of his death was the fact he never came to her. Not before, and not after she'd heard it from the media first. She went to him when she heard the car pull into the driveway. He wasn't interested in what she had to say about the matter. It'd happened before with other fights, but now the stakes were higher. Ivan Drago killed Apollo… why not Rocky as well? Sure, Rocky might have a few more rounds in him than Apollo. Rocky was in better shape and had more time to train, but would it matter in the end? Adrian buried her face into the nearest pillow and let herself cry. As if fighting weren't bad enough, she also had to worry about Rocky going to this country where tensions were high with America. She knew, no matter what she felt, she should be spending every possible moment with him until he took off. Alas, here she was hiding, feeling intimidated. Since the night they shared words on the over the stairwell, whenever she was near him she lost her voice. He talked and she sat staring into space, only looking at him when he said her name so many times in a row. Last night he kissed her, something she rarely avoided even in a bad mood. She didn't kiss back at first. Soon though, emotion overtook stubbornness and she fell asleep clinging to her husband. So much of her wanted to go to him and give her blessing. If he were to die, did she want this avoidance to be her last memory of him? At the same time, she needed to put her foot down. The only reason he was fighting Drago was in attempts to get back at him for Apollo's death. How, she wasn't quite sure. When Mickey died, Rocky went through a similar, yet, also the opposite response. He lost his will to fight, beginning to lose himself along the way. This time it seemed as though fighting was his only answer. He stood before her and admitted his willingness to die to prove something. Adrian still wasn't clear on what that something was. Was it for himself? For his country? For justice? No matter which, Adrian knew there had to be another way. Her head lifted from the pillow upon hearing Rocky calling her name from down the hall. She sat still at first. Talking to him now would further complicate her feelings. But, if anything happened to him, she'd regret not having said goodbye for the rest of her life. \"Adrian?\" Rocky called again, this time closer to the library door. \"Thought you might be in here,\" Rocky said when he saw Adrian peer her head around the corner several seconds later. \"I just came to say goodbye.\" Adrian tipped her head but said nothing. \"Look, Adrian,\" he said, taking her hands. \"I don't mean to upset you or nothin' by leaving. This is somethin' I gotta do. I know you don't understand, but can you at least trust me?\" Again, Adrian didn't say anything. Why bother, she figured. He wasn't going to hear any arguments. Rocky sighed. \"I ain't hear you say this little since you was working in the pet shop and I tried telling you that old knock-knock joke about the orange and the banana.\" Adrian had to smile at the memory. She hoped to keep it hidden by letting the ends of her hair fall in front of her face. \"Am I allowed to hug you goodbye?\" Now was the first time she looked up. The first thing she noticed were the dark circles under his eyes. While she still didn't speak, she lifted her hand from his and moved it to his shoulder. Here was Rocky's turn to smile, though, it was laced with sadness. Wrapping his arms around her waist, he pulled her close and kissed her forehead. \"You know I love you. You and the kid.\" \"We love you, too,\" she finally said in a whisper. \"You have no idea how glad I am to hear you say that.\" Adrian nodded as her arms wound around her neck. A couple minutes went by. Glancing at the clock on the wall, Rocky loosened his hold on her and took half a step back. With one hand, he reached into his back pocket and pulled out an old business card from the dentist's office. On the back, he had scribbled out an address. Handing it to Adrian, he said, \"Here's where I'm gonna be staying. They ain't got a phone there. Maybe you can write or somethin'. I dunno how their mail system works.\" \"So, this is it? This is what you want?\" Sudden anger made speaking an easier task. \"Complete isolation… that's the answer?\" \"Come on, Adrian. Let's not do this now.\" \"When then? Time is up.\" \"I don't wanna have to leave like this. Why do you have to make me feel so bad about going?\" \"I'm not trying to make you feel bad, Rocky. I'm trying to talk some sense into you.\" \"I don't need your sense. I need your support. You think I'm lookin' forward to this? 'Cause I'm not.\" \"No one is forcing you to go.\" \"I'm forcing me. I already told you, this somethin' I gotta do.\" \"I know you feel that way, but think of your family. Think of your son and think of me… think of yourself! Don't you value your life at all?\" In a raised voice, Rocky replied, \"Don't you? Why are you doing this to me now, Adrian? Huh? You know I fight lousy without you. I need you!\" \"I need you, too!\" she cried. \"And the thought of losing you is killing me.\" Adrian covered her face with her hands as though she were trying to push the tears back into her eyes. Rocky stood feeling helpless knowing the only way to make her feel better would be by staying home. \"Don't cry… you're not gonna lose me.\" \"You can't be sure of that.\" Taking her hands again, he said, \"Yes I can. I ain't promisin' I won't get hurt none. That I can guarantee you. But no matter how many broken bones or bruises I got, I'm comin' home.\" \"Is it worth the risk? You're going to hurt either way. Why disfigure yourself?\" \"I'm not Apollo, okay? I know what I'm getting into – he didn't. I've seen how strong Drago is. I'm gonna train longer and harder. This ain't a joke to me.\" Hearing him choke on his last words, Adrian hugged him. \"…I told him to postpone the fight, Adrian. I did.\" Adrian opted for silence again. She hadn't known this and wondered why he didn't mention it before. Normally he told her everything. Why was Drago prompting him to keep his thoughts to himself? \"Please come with me,\" he mumbled into her hair. She shook her head. \"I love you, Rocky… but this is one fight I can't watch.\" Letting out a long breath, Rocky gave her a light pat on the back as he stepped away. \"I gotta go. I already said goodbye to the kid.\" The hurt in his eyes made Adrian retake her stance of looking at the floor. \"I'm sorry.\" With a single nod, Rocky leaned in and kissed her cheek. \"I guess I'll see you when I get back then.\" He started walking to the stairs, only to stop when he realized Adrian wasn't behind him. \"Aren't you coming to the car?\" he asked. Adrian, having not moved from her same spot, once again shook her head. Rocky looked at her from the other end of the hall for a few moments. Then, admitting defeat, he disappeared down the stairs. All Adrian wanted now was a cup of tea while curling up in her chair again. Seeing as tea required passing Rocky through the entry way to the house, it would have to wait. Her destination was the chair, however, instead found herself looking out the window. The library overlooked the driveway, so she could see Rocky loading the last of his luggage into the trunk of the car. Why she watched, she wasn't entirely sure. A knot formed in her stomach when he looked up at her. He knew she was watching and knew all along she would. Neither of them waved before Rocky went inside the car and drove away. What else was there to say?[Chapter 2] No matter how hard she tried, sleep wasn't coming to Adrian. She missed Rocky. It wasn't as though she'd spent the night away from Rocky before, or vice-versa. But he wouldn't be gone for a simple night or a week. She likely wouldn't see him until after the first of the year. If he wasn't brutalized to death, he would require some weeks to recover. He would be away for Christmas. Instead of being shaken awake at six o'clock in the morning by Rocky and Robert, she and the kid would sit in front of the television set to watch a member of their family being pounded. Truth be told, she hoped Jr. would sleep through the whole thing. He'd seen his father get beat up before, but never by an opponent this vicious. Not even Thunderlips or Clubber Lang. Adrian shuddered at the thought of those men. Witnessing both of those fights in person took at least ten years off her life. At least Drago wouldn't throw Rocky out of the ring. Then again, being tossed around was a lot less dangerous than a towering man with a mean fist. Remorse didn't appear to be one of his attributes, either. Overall, Drago was a mysterious man of few words and no emotion. For all Adrian knew, he was out to kill Rocky on purpose. Her turn of thoughts ensured more tossing and turning should she climb back into bed. The clock read 2:30 A.M., give or take a few minutes. Moving over to her vanity, she reached into the back of the bottom drawer and took out her glasses. She couldn't remember the last time she'd worn them. The frames she had now were a bit more modern than the cat-eye ones she used to wear. Sometimes she missed hiding behind those lenses. People saw the awkward looking girl rather than the fear. Living back in the old neighborhood with Paulie were times of great uncertainty. Day to day she wondered what each moment would bring. Did Paulie make it home last night? Would he get a call saying he was fired? Was he going to yell and scream at her? What for? The only stability was her job. Even then, there were questions of customers and which animals she'd have to say goodbye to. Dealing with customers was the worst. Not only because of her shyness, but also some people mistreated the poor little creatures before they stepped foot outside the door. By the time she left the job she'd lost count of how many children shook their new pet fish until it went belly up. Those fears looked minor now. With time she learned how to put up with her brother's abuse and learned to hand the bagged fish to the parents with a note of warning taped to the front. How can one prepare for the possibility of losing their best friend, love, and universe? It wasn't possible. Even when the person is sick and given a specific time left, you never know what'll hit you until it happens. Adrian would never forget the look on Mary-Ann's face as she watched Apollo hit the mat. Or worse, when she tried pushing through the crowd and camera unable to reach her husband while the rest of the world watched him die. Adrian wouldn't forget her attempts to comfort the other woman as doctors tried bringing Apollo back – a lost cause from the start. Knowing all of this brought on more angst than preparation. Part of her envied Mary-Ann's ignorance. She'd gone to the arena that night well aware of the injuries to come. Adrian, too, was accustomed to this routine. As unpleasant as the blood and worry were, at least she knew by the end of the day everything would be okay. Rocky, like Apollo, could be real stubborn. Whenever anyone begged him to throw in the towel he flat out refused. Drago would make this stubbornness more powerful. All of these reasons and more led Adrian to her decision to stay home. She wasn't sure if Rocky believed her pleas about his health. After so many arguments and discussions about retiring in the past, he mustn't be thinking this fight any different. In his present frame of mind, he couldn't see that he'd been lucky so many times already. As Mickey used to say to Rocky, his fights with Apollo should have killed him. It only takes one stroke of bad luck to destroy a man. Realizing how long she'd stood staring at a pair of glasses, Adrian finally put them on to move downstairs to the den. Hopefully, she thought, putting TV would help lull her to sleep. Why is it when someone is missing from the house everything becomes darker than usual? More creaks and bumps sounded than she normally would notice. Before going downstairs she looked in on Robert. Fast asleep and peaceful… Adrian smiled. Thank God he didn't have the same knowledge as her. He knew what happened to Apollo, but not in great detail. After shutting the door most of the way, she continued to the den. Once sitting in this large room, Adrian realized the emptiness of the house. She and Robert were the only ones at home. When Rocky had gone away in the past, there'd been at least one other adult around as well. Mickey, Paulie, or sometimes Robert's nanny. Sincere loneliness fell over her. A loneliness more significant than the plain absence of her husband. Taking care of Robert would be the easy part as well as the silver lining. She didn't want him without his family over Christmas, nor for such a long period of time. School recently started up again, so it was good to be here to see if all was going well. There wasn't any reason to think otherwise, but as a mother, it was a natural worry. Perceptions of time were fascinating. With Robert, it felt like the days of diapers and middle of the night feedings were a short while back. Whereas looking ahead at the next several weeks felt like looking on to the next couple years. Adrian leaned her head back on the sofa. Best not allow herself to keep thinking negative thoughts, she decided. Closing her eyes, she started thinking more about her son and husband and happier times. When Rocky came home, the days of boxing would be over. And he would come home, she had to tell herself – no matter how much she did or didn't believe it.[Chapter 3] \"Mom?\" \"Yes?\" \"You made me the wrong sandwich.\" Adrian turned off the kitchen faucet and looked down at Robert. \"I did? What did I make?\" Tongue stuck out, he answered, \"Tuna fish.\" \"Oh… are you sure?\" \"I can smell it,\" Robert said with his face in a grimace. \"Can you make a peanut butter one?\" \"I don't think there's time,\" Adrian said, glancing at her watch. \"You'll have to buy your lunch at school. The bus will be here in a minute.\" \"Again?\" Adrian sighed. \"I'm sorry, sweetheart. I know my mind has been other places lately. I don't mean to take it out on you.\" \"Are you still thinking about Dad?\" Robert asked. \"I miss him, that's all. Don't you miss him as well?\" \"Yeah, but I still remember that I hate tuna.\" Adrian had to laugh. Time like this she could see Rocky's sense of humor shining through their son. If this was a good or bad thing she hadn't decided. \"If you kiss him so much,\" Robert continued, \"why don't we go see him?\" \"It's more complicated than you're thinking.\" The school bus horn sounded seconds later. Robert shrugged, accepting his mother's answer. Adrian stood at the kitchen window and watched until the bus drove away. She hated this feeling of relief when Robert was at school. Was she so depressed that she didn't want to be around her child? Depressed didn't feel like the right term. Preoccupied was closer. Unfortunately, the preoccupation wasn't happy. The last thing she wanted to do was subject Robert to her moods. On some level, she thought he might be understanding. It seemed as though he'd been on his best behavior. He hadn't even asked for friends to come over. Instead, he went to their houses. Adrian took a deep breath. Maybe she should sit down with him tonight and apologize. It wasn't right for him to be worrying about her. It was supposed to be the other way around. Better yet, they could use a fun night out. Robert had been asking Rocky all through summer break to go bowling. Helping Apollo train made finding time near impossible. After the fight, Robert stopped asking. Yes, a night at the bowling alley would do them both some good. Fun was needed. Since Rocky left, the household fell into a day after day routine. Even weekends became mundane. Adrian surprised Robert by picking him up from school. After his initial concern that something was wrong, he was happy to know he wasn't on his way home to do his weekend homework. For an early dinner, they went to their favorite pizza parlor and then down the street for ice cream. For the first time in a while, Adrian found herself able to live in the present moment. Night came. Even though she managed a few hours of laughs and distractions, as soon as Robert went to sleep, Adrian was once again aware of the emptiness of the house. She might have even settled for Paulie to come home at this point. At least then she would have a project. Her biggest wish tonight was for someone to talk to. Someone who could tell her whether or not she was making the right decision. It occurred to her how few friends she had. She spoke to the mothers of Robert's friends, joining them for coffee on occasion. She and the neighbors were friendly, but not quite friends. Her closest friend outside the family had to be Gloria back at the pet shop. Even then she wasn't close enough to call her up and talk about this. Rocky's schedule didn't leave room for friendships. Most of the time it didn't bother her. She didn't notice. Rocky's world was her world. Rocky's world with her world… and she chose to stay behind. Suddenly she flashed on the days before she and Rocky were together. Those days and nights he came to visit her at work. Normally, he would tell jokes, but sometimes he talked about boxing. He never thought she was paying attention, but she was. She heard about his losses and victories. Back then he spoke of fights with indifference. Win or lose his expression remain the same. Over the years, he came to care. True, his hunger to win turned to ego at times. With Drago, it was hunger mixed with hurt and anger. Safer than ego, perhaps, but dangerous nonetheless. What caused indifference to turn into passion? The fights with Apollo? The responsibility of a family? Pride? Whichever it was, she knew he needed her support. He said as much on many occasions. A lot of times she wondered if he said those things for her sake. It was hard to believe she could have that kind of influence on someone's life, especially someone as tough as Rocky. Then were the times she knew and could see the difference she made. The doorbell rang, pulling Adrian out of her thoughts. Glancing at the clock on the nightstand she wondered who would be coming to visit after 9 o'clock. After looking out the window and failing to see who was standing at the door, she threw on her robe and went downstairs. Once approaching the door, she called, \"Who is it?\" \"It's Mary-Ann.\" Adrian opened the door. \"What a nice surprise,\" she greeted with a smile. \"I do wish I'd known you were coming, though. Let me run upstairs and change. I'll be right back.\" \"Wait,\" Mary-Ann said, \"don't bother. I only came to talk to you for a minute.\" Growing concerned, Adrian, stepping aside to let Mary-Ann inside, asked, \"What's up? Would you like a cup of coffee?\" \"No, thank you,\" she said. \"I want to talk to you about Rocky.\" \"What's wrong? Has something happened to him? Did you hear something?\" Holding up her hand, Mary-Ann shook her head. \"Nothing is wrong.\" \"Oh, good,\" Adrian breeze. \"I'm sorry. I've been a bit on edge since he left.\" \"I don't blame you. That's why I came to talk to you. Can I ask you something?\" Adrian nodded. \"Why didn't you go with him?\" Adrian stared at Mary-Ann, not wanting to answer. She didn't want to mention Apollo to her. \"Adrian?\" Mary-Ann said when she failed to respond. \"It's complicated,\" Adrian settled with saying. \"Believe me, I know how you feel. I was terrified when I heard Apollo was going through with the fight.\" At least she hadn't been the one to bring him up, Adrian thought. Mary-Ann continued. \"I did everything I could to talk him out of this match. Everything. These men,\" she said, \"do what they want in the end. It can't be helped.\" Adrian knew well what she spoke of. \"You should be with him now,\" she finished. Adrian shook her head. \"I can't watch him. I can't be around him knowing what the end result might be.\" \"Don't go by Apollo. He wasn't in good enough shape and took it all too lightly. I've seen Rocky fight, and I know he can be just as dangerous as Drago when he wants to be.\" Little comfort came from the statement. \"Even if that's true, I know the damage will be permanent this time.\" \"Then isn't it better to be with him now while he is well?\" Looking to the floor, Adrian fumbled with the belt on her robe, so he serving as an excuse to hide her acknowledgment that Mary-Ann was right. \"I didn't come to upset you, Adrian. I planned to keep out of it. The matter is between you and Rocky. But, I couldn't live with myself knowing I hadn't reached out if, God forbid, something does happen.\" After taking a few moments to collect her thoughts, Adrian looked up again. \"Do you really think I should go?\" \"Have you thought of anything else since he left?\" \"…No.\" Mary-Ann gave us sympathetic smile. \"It will mean a lot to him.\" \"But what about Robert? I hate to leave him, and for so long, and over Christmas.\" \"I know how hard that can be, too.\" With a small smile of her own, Adrian said, \"Thank you. Your coming by means a lot.\" And it did. Funny how she heard the door just as she was wishing for a shoulder to lean on. She did consider Mary-Ann a friend, but she never imagined going to her given the circumstances. \"So, you're going to Russia?\" Adrian nodded, \"Yeah, I think I am. I miss him so much, and I feel bad about how we left things.\" Realizing what she'd said, she blushed. Catching her embarrassment, Mary-Ann tipped her head, signaling it was okay. \"Be safe… both of you.\"[Chapter 4] The flight to Russia was anything but a short one. Saying goodbye to Robert was even more of a challenge. He said he understood, but Adrian could see his sadness. Before, when he told her to go, he hadn't realized it would have to be without him. Adrian tried her hardest to sleep through the journey, but rest wasn't coming. Sometimes she found herself watching the hands on her watch go around and around. In her mind, she insisted watching made the time pass faster. In actuality, it prolonged the feeling. No one knew she was coming. Not Rocky, not Paulie, and not Duke. There was no way to contact them. Getting a card to that address Rocky left her proved to be another challenge. Her last name carried little weight. Hours passed before she was humored and taken to the farm. She kept telling herself the fuss was worthwhile. Duke was surprised to see Adrian walk through the door. Paulie, not so much. \"What took ya' so long?\" were his first words. Without batting an eye, he went back to his card game. Adrian ignored him. \"Where's Rocky?\" \"Training,\" Duke answered. \"Did he know you were coming?\" Shaking her head, she asked, \"When will he be back?\" \"Not due back for at least an hour. You must be tired, though.\" He started to get up from his seat. \"I'll show you to his room.\" \"I'm all right,\" she said. \"I'll wait for him here.\" Settling herself at the window, coat, boots, and all, she watched. Duke told her she would be able to see Rocky coming up the walk from there. Yet again, she played the waiting game. This time she didn't look at her watch. If she did, she would be reminded of how long it had been since the last time she slept. Going up to bed was tempting but would have been pointless until she saw Rocky. As Duke predicted, Rocky came up to the house around an hour later. Adrian leaped out of her seat and went to the door. She paused before opening it. Until now, she hadn't considered what his reaction to her arrival might be. The thought was fleeting, though. Her desire to see him reigned over any other emotion. Stepping out on the porch, she waited for Rocky to see her. It didn't take him long. Stopping in his tracks, he blinked a few times to make sure he was seeing correctly. He took slow steps toward her as she climbed down the stairs. They stopped with a few feet of space between each other. A wave of emotion came over Adrian as she stared at her husband. She couldn't recall a time when she'd seen him with a beard beyond five o'clock shadow. But even this wasn't as far as full as his eyes filled with disbelief. Through a lump in her throat, Adrian said, \"I couldn't stay away anymore… I missed you.\" \"I missed you,\" Rocky replied with a slight nod of his head. The next words out of her mouth were the hardest. \"I'm with you… no matter what.\" \"No matter what?\" Rocky asked, his voice unsteady. \"No matter what.\" No longer able to keep a distance, they walked into each other's arms, Adrian no longer able to control her tears. Rocky kissed her and held her head close to his, trying to convince himself this was real and that she was really here with him. \"I love you,\" he whispered. \"And I love you.\" \"You promise you'll be by the ring?\" \"I promise,\" she sniffed. Rocky ran his gloves over her damp cheeks, then reached for her hood and pulled it up. \"You'll catch a cold,\" he said. \"This place makes a Philadelphia winter look like the tropics.\" Adrian laughed, which ultimately led to more tears. How she missed this – being with him, hearing his voice, listening to silly jokes. In this moment, she knew she has made the right decision. No matter what happened, it would be the two of them, always. The End. ","Summary":" Adrian sat in the library curled up in her favorite chair by the fireplace.

Different squads were practicing cheers and clapping before a loud whistle sounded. As the girls and boys ran around to get into their designated groups, four judges were sitting at a table, watching a cheerleading squad run onto the blue padded matts in the middle of the green fields of freshly-cut grass. The judges were probably the only ones happy about being able to sit underneath a tent's cool shade as the sun was passing through the clear, blue sky. The group of mostly black cheerleaders were hopping up and down and getting everyone's spirits up as best as they could. Each girl wore workout shorts and spandex sports bras or wife beaters. The squads were cheering for them to show their attention had been gained. As the girls got into position, they waited for the number to start. After ten seconds passed, the boys in the front pivoted around to do numerous backflips as one girl cheerleader cartwheeled then flipped above one of the cheerleaders. The group performed a fun routine as the crowd gave them encouraging plaudits. The number was over and one of the girls rose her arm up and began to shout. \"Ready?\" the girl shouted. She was very pretty and had a curvy body like some of the other girls. Her other came up in a perfect arc as she shouted, \"Okay! I said Good God.\" \"Suns' playin' it hard,\" the team chanted, adding a bit of crumping into the cheer. \"We bouncin' off walls like the game is the jump off. Too bad, don't be mad. Clean up the weak act and you might not get had.\" \"Hold up, slow it down, a roll call is in order now,\" the leader shouted, getting into position with seven other girls. \"Reeses,\" one girl called, flipping her weave. \"Gabby Q,\" one girl called, blowing a kiss to the audience. \"Farah,\" another girl called, flipping her long hair out of her face and shaking her breast playfully. \"Eda K,\" another said, seductively twirling her fingers in hair and winking to some of the boys behind the judges. \"Cada,\" one more said, swirving her hips around before snapping her fingers. \"Sherry Cola,\" a curvy-bodied girl called, tracing the contours of her body with her hands. \"Nicki,\" the main character introduced, whipping her hair long, curly hair around as she swirved her hip around boldly. \"Jody,\" the second tallest girl called, slapping the side of her butt. The leader got in the middle of the circle and said, \"You already know, my name Unique.\" The number ended and the crowd cheered for the girls as they bowed and hopped around. As the Suns' team went to cool off and release their nervous and/or excited tension, the leader, Unique, relaxed her neck and shoulder muscles before turning to Nicki. She was planning to talk to her until the scout master called her and exchanged a few words with her. \"Alright, ya'll, water break before one more practice,\" Unique called, speaking to the scout master. Feeling this chat was going to be a bit longer than anticipated, Unique turned again and said, \"Ya'll know what, don't worry about practice. It's almost time to eat.\" \"You sure?\" Cada asked. \"Yeah, ya'll go head. I got something to take care of,\" Unique said, waving the team off. Everyone shrugged their shoulders as they went to their cabins to chill for a while. Unique watched as some of the team spoke to Nicki, one of her biggest enemies. The scout master brought her attention to something else for the time being, however, as the Suns walked off. Several hours passed and the sun was setting. The Suns and other squads were done with practice until tomorrow's demonstration. Everyone was running to get some water before dinner in the mess hall. Horns sounded, signaling dinner, and all the squads lined up in front of the door as if it were boot camp and not cheer camp. The mess hall was just a big log cabin cafeteria except the security came from the military for some reason or another and the pedestal area was in the style of an old church pedestal. Once everyone was seated, the scout master stood on her pedestal to speak. She had a roller-curled hairstyle and glasses with sharp corners at the rim set onto her soft, wide nose. Despite her age, she was very funny and cheerful. She had more energy than most forty or fifty-something year olds. \"Good evening, ya'll,\" the scout master greeted. \"Good evening,\" everyone returned. \"Tomorrow is our last day at Cheer Camp for the summer, you guys. Everyone should have finished refining new routines and blowing the dust off some old ones for the morning demonstration. Your judges for tomorrow will determine which of you girls have the most potential for regionals, which of you have made the most progress, and which of you are the best inspirational leaders,\" the scout master informed, earning some cheers and clapping herself. \"I hope you all get a good's night rest and bring it on like nobody's business. Tonight we're having pizza to commemorate our time together as a family and as a hard-working team. Hope you all will be well for tomorrow and don't shove no extra slices in your purses. We were kids, too; we know that trick.\" Some people laughed at that comment while others stood up and left before the cafeteria staff got the food ready. It was going to be another hour or so before everything was set up, so Nicki of the Suns' squad stood up and left to her cabin. Two other girls from the squad got up to follow her, which gained Unique's attention again, but before she could say anything to them they were gone from the mess hall. In the cabin, Nicki grabbed her purse, sat on her bed, and took out some nail polish and other products. She heard a knock on the door and looked up to see who it was. Her two best friends, Eda and Farah, were waving at her as they came to sit around her. \"Hey, ya'll, what chu doin' in here?\" Nicki questioned, grabbing some wipes and a stone out of the purse. \"Nicki, you goin' to the pizza party tonight?\" Eda asked. \"I know they're the worst thing for a cheerleader tryin' to lose weight.\" \"They only bad for me 'cause I'm allergic to the sauce,\" Nicki said. \"You alright, child. Go have fun with Trelli. You like him, right?\" \"No, she like that other boy,\" Farah said, taking a wipe before sitting down and taking her shoes off. She wiped her feet with the moist, powder-scented cloth before saying, \"Otherwise, she wouldn't be wearing her special green polish. She already showed off that funk-ass zebra print.\" \"You know what, I ain't worried 'bout you, Ms. I-can't-get-a-man-because-I'm-clumsy,\" Eda said, sitting beside Nicki and grabbing a wipe. \"Now, you need to stop 'cause you know you can't dance with yo' big offbeat self,\" Farah remarked. \"See, that's why I don't like you right there,\" Eda commented, pointing her manicured fingers at Farah then returning to wiping her feet of sweat. \"Then what you gettin' ya nails done fo'?\" Farah argued, not understanding why she needed to have them repainted if she couldn't stand speaking to her. \"'Cause Nicki got a nail shop in her purse. Don't play like you wanted to get yours done just because,\" Eda retorted. \"Alright, ya'll, calm down. Let's just finish this before the camp cop come up in here with his curfew bell. Hand me that yellow, Farah,\" Nicki requested, taking some nail polish remover out of her purse. \"But, Nicki, real talk. Let's do somethin' else,\" Eda suggested. \"Like what? You hit on just about every dude with legs,\" Nicki said, dabbing the polish remover onto a cotton swab and rubbing the cracked polish off her toes. She had considerably pretty feet with exception to the bruise on her toe that came from wearing horribly made tennis shoes. \"Let's go swimmin',\" Eda said, shrugging as though her suggestion was obvious. \"Oooo, let's go skinny dippin' like them people on TV,\" Farah said, getting excited and picking out red and gold polish. \"I ain't gettin' in no water with my ass stickin' out. You lost yo' damn mind,\" Nicki said, giving Farah a look. \"C'mon, it's just gonna be this once. We gon' do it before curfew out in the lake,\" Farah said. \"Just wear some pasties and come on. It's just gon be us. Who gon know?\" Eda asked. The girls looked at Nicki with anticipation and excitement in their eyes. If they were going to go out of Cheer Camp, they may as well go out with a boom. Skinny dipping in the lake should be okay since the lake had clean, blue water and was cool year round. Nicki looked into Eda's eyes then into Farah's and sighed resignedly. The party was in the middle of getting a bit more rowdy, and Farah was beckoning Eda and Nicki to hurry to the lake while the camp cops were sipping some wine with the scout master and the judges. The girls were giggling as they ran around in robes, with exception to a reluctant Nicki, and scattered to the lake. Once they reached the moonlit water, Farah took off her robe - revealing a tall, slender, light-skinned naked body - and dove into the lake. She cheered before covering her mouth to stay quiet and swam backwards a bit. Eda took off her robe to reveal a shorter, chubbier body then dove in the water and made a louder splash than Farah. \"Whoo, this water cold!\" Eda said, shivering a bit before relaxing. \"Alright, Nicki, jump!\" Farah called, laughing a bit. Nicki looked behind her to make sure no one was around then back at the girls waving to her. She was even more reluctant than before as she looked into the lake. It wasn't as refreshing and nice-looking as before when they went swimming during the day. This time the lake looked ominous. \"Ya'll check to make sure they ain't got no sharks in the water,\" Nicki said, waving her hand to the evil-looking lake. \"Sharks swim in the ocean, girl!\" Eda remarked. \"Hurry up and jump!\" \"You want me to come up there and jump with you?\" Farah asked, swimming towards the shore. \"Nah, that's alright,\" Nicki said to them. She took her robe off, shivering from the cool air caressing her lower back, then took some steps back to prepare to jump. She said, \"I swear on high if I scrape my ass up on one of these rocks I'm a kill them.\" \"Nicki, Farah comin' up there if you don't come down,\" Eda called. \"Alright!\" Nicki called, preparing for the run. \"Here I come!\" Nicki ran to the edge of the cliff, but as she jumped, her foot got caught on a tree root that was hidden by Farah's bright yellow robe and made her flip around in the air instead. As Eda and Farah watched her spin about, Nicki let out a yelp then fell onto the rocky shore and bumped her head onto a thick, smooth stone that made her world turn black and red. Voices were pouring through her ears as heat and cool air mixed and passed over her skin. Her head was spinning and beating as she felt a painful heat wave before her closed, lidded eyes. She flinched at the pain then heard more voices beat her skull mercilessly. As her eyes opened, she cringed at the flashlight waving in front of her face. She saw a man with a small afro holding a miniature flashlight in his gloved hand. He turned off his light and put something cold onto her chest as he examined her heartbeat. Nicki groaned as she placed her hand onto her forehead. A pack of ice was resting there. \"She's comin' to, sir,\" the afro man said. Suddenly, he was knocked over and Nicki's father appeared before her. He inquired, \"Baby, baby, you alright?\" As quickly as her father's image came, her mother shoved her father aside and shouted relentlessly, \"Girl, what the hell were you thinkin' jumpin' off a cliff like you crazy? Suppose the raper-man would've came and snatched you up. You are outside your mind agreeing to do somethin' dumb like this with no draws on! You ain't got the decency to wear none?\" \"My draws?\" Nicki questioned, not remembering or understanding her situation. Abruptly, the memory of agreeing to Eda's and Farah's request to do something different to commemorate the end of summer camp came to her. They agreed to go skinny dipping in the lake, but she only remembered taking off her robe. After that, nothing. She shot up from her laying position and said, \"Wait, where my draws at?\" \"Nicki, you alright, girl?\" Eda asked, sitting beside Nicki to see her head. \"You bleedin' anywhere? Did you scrape yo' ass?\" \"Eda, where my draws?\" Nicki questioned, looking around for her robe, clothes, anything really. \"Girl, you smashed yo' head on that rock hard. You alright?\" Farah asked. \"Where are my draws?\" Nicki asked, getting impatient and worried. Everyone looked down at Nicki, including the paramedic, and said nothing. Nicki shook her head, hoping she wasn't still naked. When she looked down at her own body, she was in fact still naked and perfectly exposed to everyone. She looked into everyone else's eyes and after losing her breath in shock just started screaming as she scrambled to cover herself. Oh, Nicki, you so fine You so fine you blow my mind Hey Nicki hey hey Hey Nicki Oh, Nicki, you so fine You so fine you blow my mind Hey Nicki hey hey Hey Nicki At the airport, a tall, youthful woman wearing a sundress and wedge heels with hair styled in a bob was texting someone with her Blackberry. She looked up every now and then to make sure she didn't miss anything. There were quite a few people at the airport this summer. Usually it was empty, but some families and businessmen were probably coming from all over to get ready for the working fall season. Kids have school in two weeks while businessfolk have their busiest work schedules around this time. Once she was done sending her message, she saw a tall, young girl running towards her through the crowd. \"My baby!\" the woman said, clutching her purse and putting her phone away. She ran to the girl in excitement and embraced her tightly as they squealed in glee. \"Farah! Hey, my baby!\" the woman said, rocking back and forth as she squeezed her daughter's slender body. \"Mommy!\" Farah returned, bouncing up and down. Two other girls came towards them and smiled at how cheerful mother and daugher were after not seeing each other for two whole months. Though Farah, the baby girl and daughter, was taller than her mother, they looked identical. They both had big, toothy smiles, light skin, straight black hair - Farah's being the longest since her mom cut it short, and sharp noses. Even their styles for fashion were similar. They both loved bright-colored dresses, which is what they were wearing, and sandals during the summer. The mother turned to the other girls and spoke to them with just as much excitement as she had for her daughter. \"Hey, ya'll how was camp?\" \"We had to do gymnastics for two weeks,\" Farah said, chewing on a piece of gum still. \"How'd you do?\" \"Good,\" Farah answered, hopping. \"I can do the helicopter now.\" \"That's my baby. Ya'll got all ya'll stuff ready to go? I gotta drop Eda and Nicki off before we go home.\" \"The only thing we lost is a cheap thing of lipstick,\" Eda commented, making Farah's mother laugh. Farah's mother led the girls to the Subaru van and helped them pack their bags in the trunk. Once the van pulled off, everyone was on their way home. There were some silent moments as the van took the interstate homeward, but once Nicki saw Young A. Wessex Senior High School she spoke up. \"Junior year comin' up, ya'll,\" Nicki started. \"We gotta decide who gon be the next captain.\" \"It's gon be you anyway. What you trippin' over?\" Farah asked. \"Don't say that! It might not happen,\" Nicki said, pushing Farah playfully. \"Well, if it ain't you, it's gon be itchy bitchy Beaux and her nasty attitude as co-captain,\" Eda said, gesturing a bit. \"Hey, now, watch that language,\" Farah's mother warned. \"Oops, sorry,\" Eda apologized, cringing. \"Unique's not that bad. She's just under a lot of pressure because of the last captain,\" Nicki said. \"Ya'll know Jody can be mean to her sister?\" \"Jody Unique sistah?\" Farah questioned. \"We called you twice to tell you that and you still forgot?\" Eda asked. \"Ya'll didn't call me to say that!\" Farah shouted, offended by not knowing such a valid piece of information. \"Nicki called you to make sure you knew,\" Eda said, wondering how Farah didn't know. \"Cheerleader captain runs in the Beaux family. They mama was captain in her high school, Jody became captain our freshmen year, so if Unique win that's a third captain of the family.\" \"That's gon be tough to beat, though. Unique gon have her sister's vote automatically, and if she impresses the graduating seniors she's got half the votes,\" Nicki inserted, beginning to worry. \"But you got all the lower classmen. You gon be alright. Stop worryin' so much!\" Eda said, pushing Nicki playfully. \"Daryl gon call you grandma if you get worry wrinkles on your face.\" \"Stop!\" Nicki responded, giggled. \"We should get a coach who gon help us get to regionals, though. Captains ain't got no money like that to bring like twenty of us to Houston,\" Farah noted. \"They gotta find a bus, pay the driver, get hotel rooms, worry about food - \" \"I'd worry about food, too, if I knew you was gon be there. You snacks on anything that ain't poisonous,\" Eda remarked. \"Now, Eda, you can't call the kettle black, child. You eat too,\" Farah's mother remarked. \"What we need to worry about is how we gon get the money for all that,\" Nicki said through chuckling at Eda's horrified face. \"A hotel suite can hold up to twelve people, so we need about two. That's like 2000 dollars.\" \"2000?\" Farah questioned, catching a small heart attack. \"For a hotel in Houston?\" Eda questioned, furrowing her eyebrows. \"Yeah, girl, suites ain't cheap. We would have to have a fundraiser every two weeks to get rooms in Houston. Not counting a bus or bus driver and not countin' food,\" Nicki informed. \"Damn,\" Eda, Farah, and Farah's mother said. Nicki couldn't wait to get home and tell her parents all that she learned at Cheer Camp. Farah's mother pulled up to Nicki's house and helped get Nicki's stuff out of the trunk. She pulled her keys out of her purse, opened the door, and waved to goodbye to Farah and her mother. Nicki pulled her suitcases inside, closed the door, and looked in the house to see...nothing. Everything was gone! The pictures on the wall, the trophies on the shelves, the dishes, the couch, everything was gone! \"Mama, daddy, I'm home. Ma? What happened to our stuff?\" \"Nicki!\" \"Courtney!\" Nicki called, getting excited for the moment. Courtney was Nicki's baby cousin. Courtney's mother was Nicki's aunt on her mother's side of the family. She gave birth to Nicki's dancing \"apprentice,\" Courtney, who was taking dancing lessons at Nicki's old studio. Nicki scooped little Courtney in her arms, embraced her tightly, and swung her around to make the little girl laugh and smile. A man came down the stairs, hearing voices downstairs, and suddenly became nervous. The man was Nicki's father, and he a very \"special\" surprise for his eldest and only daughter. \"Jenny, Nicki back from camp.\" \"Alright, I'm comin' down.\" \"Hey, daddy,\" Nicki greeted, smiling. \"Hey, baby, how was camp?\" the man asked, trying to find the right words to tell his daughter. \"Camp was fun! We learned routines from some other squads and helped change 'em up, and some squads from Florida, Georgia, Los Angeles, and Texas came to teach us the rules for regionals and nationals since they go every year. We were voted as the squad with the most potential to enter regionals and/or nationals.\" \"That's great, baby,\" the man complimented. \"I practiced my dance, Nicki,\" Courtney said, distracting Nicki for a moment. \"You did? Lemme see it,\" Nicki said, putting Courtney down to watch her dance. \"Shake your bodyline, shake it all the time,\" Courtney sang, shimmying as best as she could. \"Shake, shake, shake, senora, shake it all the time. Ta-da!\" \"Ah, you know the steps!\" Nicki shouted, hugging Courtney. \"That's my girl!\" \"So, where's regionals gonna be?\" Nicki's father decided to ask to find a way to break the news to Nicki. \"They moved regionals to Houston this year,\" Nicki answered. \"What about nationals?\" \"Nationals are in California this year. Last year, they were in New Mexico.\" \"Mark, you told Nicki the news?\" a woman asked, walking down the stairs with another woman trailing behind her. \"Hey, mommy! Hey, Tee Willow! What news?\" \"You get to see nationals this year in California,\" Mark said. This is it... he thought. There won't be an easier way to break this to her. \"We're going to Los Angeles tomorrow morning,\" Mark continued, smiling nervously. \"Oh my god! We're going to see nationals! Oh my god, I'm a call Trelli, Daryl, Eda and Farah and tell 'em we goin' to nationals this year,\" Nicki said, hopping around and about to run to her room until she remembered nothing was left in the house. She looked at her father curiously then said, \"Well, wait, nationals aren't until spring. That's months from now. It's August. Why we leavin' so early?\" \"I got a promotion at work, and I have to relocate to the base in Los Angeles by Friday, which is tomorrow, at two in the afternoon. We have to be at the airport by ten o'clock in the morning. The company's taking us to our new house.\" \"Baby,\" Nicki's mother said, \"we are all moving toooooooo Llllooooooossssss Aaannnggeeleeeeeesss...\" Everyone watched Nicki completely malfunction and freeze as she processed the words. Now, she wasn't a slow thinker like most cheerleaders; she was just about two seconds away from fainting. Nicki's aunt took Courtney away from Nicki, waved her hand in front of Nicki's face, and watched Nicki hit the ground and pass out. No one moved until Courtney said... \"Did she just die, mama?\"[Chapter 2] \"You're moving to Los Angeles?\" Eda and Farah questioned loudly over the phone. Nicki was a wreck as she sat on her aunt's plush, leather sofa with her little cousin's teddy bears and a few blankets. She had tissues in her hand that were supposed to catch her tears, but she sniffled through most of them and the rest fell onto her thighs. Her hair normally gave her some comfort when her face was hidden, but she had to roll her hair for the night and keep her curls looking fresh for the rest of the week. Her mother paid 95 dollars for her hair to be styled as it was; she wasn't about to ruin a hundred-dollar style so her mother can wreak more havoc on her life. She was upset with the move as it was. \"You can't run for captain if you're gone to another state. The long-distance thing don't work,\" Farah said, realizing Nicki really lost her chance to run against Unique for captain now that she's moving. Spirit law states that a captain must be enrolled in a school that he or she has been enrolled in for at least two or more years and other running captain must follow this rule as well. \"I know, Farah, but everything is already packed,\" Nicki said through a weak voice. \"I'm spending the night by my auntie house right now because it's closer to the airport. I can't just stay here with someone else with one pair of clean draws and some flip flops. Everything's on its way to Los Angeles, even my clothes. My mom already requested my transcripts from all of my schools to finish the process for my enrollment to another school.\" \"How long your daddy knew he got the promotion?\" Eda asked. \"He didn't know until mid-June. Mama said his boss came in his office one day and spoke to him for a few hours about relocating cross country. I was already at camp practicing, and he was ordering moving vans and calling other relatives to help him move while he was at work. When daddy came home, he told mama he got a promotion and he had to move to Los Angeles,\" Nicki explained. \"Well, why you goin' if he the one that had to leave?\" Farah asked. \"He's movin' to Los Angeles to stay there, Farah. He wasn't coming back,\" Nicki answered, sniffling. \"Oh, so your moms just said let's move the family?\" Eda clarified. \"Without tellin' me, yeah,\" Nicki replied angrily. She looked at the wall clock hanging over the fireplace and said, \"Well, look, ya'll I gotta go. I need to be awake to tell everyone bye in the morning. We gon be gone by 9:30.\" \"Wait, what airport ya'll gon be in?\" Farah asked. \"The one by the Lakefront,\" Nicki responded, hooking her phone up to the charger. \"We have to be on the plane by 10.\" \"We gon come see you one last time, okay? Don't worry,\" Eda tried, speaking in a soft voice. \"We can stay in touch on Facebook at least, and you can tell us all about nationals.\" \"I don't want to go to nationals without the squad,\" Nicki whined. \"We gon go to nationals together then. You said we needed to raise the money about every two weeks,\" Farah said, optimistically. Realizing that Farah, who was normally ditzy and couldn't come up with a decent plan on her own half the time, had a good point, Eda added, \"Yeah, we can scrape up the money during the year while we practice routines that'll win regionals. Once that's over, we gon be in Los Angeles at nationals.\" \"Ya'll gotta try to convince Unique to do all that stuff, though,\" Nicki said, being realistic. \"Unique is hard-headed; she don't listen to nobody except her sister.\" \"Who cool with you,\" Farah stated, smiling brightly. \"We gon say you told us how to afford getting to regionals and we need to practice to get to nationals. Jody'll tell Unique what you said and Unique'll help the squad.\" Nicki thought about Farah's idea and cheered up practically instantly. She was right. Jody and Nicki got along well enough for Jody to convince Unique to listen up, and she knew several ways to raise enough money each month to obtain rooms for a hotel in Houston for twenty people. It was going to take a lot of work and a lot of ideas and probably a lot of money to set up, but it would be worth it to get the team to regionals for the first time. Nicki smiled and got her confidence back once said, \"You the truth, girl. You the bomb, Farah, baby. You got that.\" \"What kind of fundraiser can we do when school open, though?\" Eda asked, not seeing many possibilites of obtaining close to 300 dollars a month. \"We need 2000 by the end of February. That's only seven months.\" Nicki thought of a few ways to get the money each month while maintaining a small budget from each member of the squad at a reasonable price. Finding one solution, she suggested, \"Tell everyone in the squad to put up six dollars for a fundraiser. Sell some school supplies for about a dollar a bag. Make sure the bag has a one-inch binder, three notebooks, a pack of paper, pencils, and pens, some erasers, a mini stapler, and some highlighters. You might wanna put some index cards and pocket folders in the bag, too.\" \"Nicki, six dollars ain't gon cover the expenses for that,\" Eda said, being realistic. \"You need at least twenty dollars for all of that. What about glue and scissors?\" \"No, girl, listen. Walgreens and Walmart sell school supplies on sale from the start of August to the start of October. A pack of paper is probably 35 cents right now if you pick up some coupon books. Have every member of the squad put up six dollars and collect it. You'll have 90 dollars altogether. That should buy enough supplies to start off with. Make the coaches put up ten dollars, so you can have forty dollars to make extra bags or signs to advertise the sale. You can sell art supplies for like two dollars if you want. That way one student is like three dollars if they buy both bags. Give out some snacks for like fifty cents. Some people be hungry once lunchtime start but don't wan' eat the cafeteria food. If you keep that up, by the end of August you should have about 200 dollars. If fifty people get one bag and two snacks, they spent two dollars. Fifty times two is a hundred, so you got a hundred dollars. Even if it's just ten kids a day, you got twenty dollars a day. If you keep sellin' for two weeks and you get ten kids a day, you still get 200 dollars by the first week of September. Kids gon need new supplies sooner or later, so just keep sellin' the bags. Don't change the price for any reason. More people come to you when the shit cheap, you know what I'm sayin'?\" Farah grunted, turned up her upper lip, and then said, \"I know that's right.\" \"I like that,\" Eda said. \"We gon do that idea first and ask the coach what she think.\" Nicki giggled a bit, breathed deeply, and felt her stress lift from her. She at least gave her team a stepping stone to make it to regionals, but if she wanted to see them she would have to make sure they made it to nationals and that she herself could get there. That meant she might have to buy tickets, which might not be possible since she wasn't a family member or invited friend, or join another squad and compete. Not wanting to do that, she sighed then said, \"I'm a miss ya'll.\" \"We gon miss you, too, girl,\" Farah cooed. \"Alright, well, I gotta go. I need to finish rolling up my hair.\" \"Ugh! I can't believe you leavin' me,\" Eda said, pouting. \"Promise to call us every night,\" Farah said. \"I will, Farah.\" \"Oh, Nicki, what about the squad? We the only ones who know you leavin',\" Eda said, just realizing this fact could make the squad cry. \"Daryl don't know either.\" \"Oh shit! I don't have time to call everyone now. I'm gon have to call 'em when I'm in Cali and let 'em know then.\" \"Let us tell 'em,\" Farah said. \"That way you ain't gon cry.\" \"I'm gon cry right now, girl. I don't wan' say it now,\" Eda said, waving her hand to fan her tears away. \"Can you do that for me, ya'll?\" Nicki requested. \"Yeah, I'm a tell 'em. You go on to sleep for your flight and don't cry no more alright?\" Farah said, tilting her head a bit. \"Alright,\" Nicki whispered. The girls hung up and went about their own business. All passengers report to Flight 62 for Los Angeles, California at Gate 26B. All passengers, please report to Flight 62 for Los Angeles at Gate 26B. \"Fly like a butterfly,\" Eda chanted. \"Sting like a bee,\" Farah added. \"Let's hear it for the girl,\" some of the Suns' squad members chimed sadly. \"Supa tricky fly girl, Nicki Brini.\" Nicki waved goodbye from the plane's window as the vehicle started to move. She took out a piece of gum and put some in her mouth to ease the pain that was going to come soon once the plane reached its angled take-off. Once she started chewing, she heard a \"psst!\" sound and looked up to see a guy smiling at her. He had dried clumps of mucous in his nose and acne that looked like a rash covered his face. He was white and had really oily hair that made his acne glow from the sunlight. His teeth were okay, but they were yellow and he smelled of cigarette smoke. Nicki decided it was best to ignore the boy and proceeded to put headphones on her ears to listen to reggae music. Luckily, there were magazines in front of her, so she opened one and proceeded to read. The boy wouldn't give up, though; he liked Nicki's lips as they showed her working the gum through her teeth. He wouldn't have minded if she worked those lips doing other things. The boy reached out to tap Nicki's magazine and wave a hand in front of her pretty face. Once he gained her attention again, he smiled at her and asked silently... \"What's your name?\" Nicki was pissed, so she decided to show it. She put her magazine down, stuck a finger in her mouth, and then twirled the gum around the finger and smiled seductively. The boy seemed to like that and bit his lip as he watched Nicki flirt with him. She crept closer to the boy's face then stopped flirting entirely and shoved her gum in the boy's nose and right ear before smacking his head. She iffed at him to completely scare him then went back to what she was doing. This was going to be a long flight. \"Excuse me, miss,\" a flight attendant called. \"Would you like something to eat or drink?\" \"Honey-roasted peanuts, Oreo cookie yogurt, and a grape juice?\" Nicki asked. The attendant retrieved what she asked for pulled her eating tray out from the back of the seat. Nicki paused her reggae tunes and asked, \"One more thing. Do you have any hand sanitizer?\" \"Hello, Los Angeles, this is your DJ, Ian Schiek the Shriek on FM radio rock station 95.9. We've got a young band named Stagnant Pulse from Nivaldo Gillian High, home of the purple knights, playing for us this morning as well as guest appearances from Green Day and Avenged Sevenfold to promote the punk rock benefit concert traveling all around California to support young artists from poverished backgrounds. It sounds like a very promising event, isn't that right, Danny?\" \"It sure does. For the struggling artists and for surprisingly cheerleaders.\" \"That's right, word on the street says the promoters and supervisors of the benefit concert are holding a competition for cheerleaders to perform with the bands and tour with them to a few cities for gigs,\" DJ Shriek announced. \"It's all for the cause for these kids; most of them are in schools like this new band coming up and live with struggling parents and with the music industry being you know what they find it hard to sell much.\" \"Things seem to be looking up for kids all over Cali. Let's quit talkin' and get the rock band from Nivaldo Gill, Stagnant Pulse.\" Outside of the recording studio, six teenagers dressed in some article of black clothing were sitting next to the door of opportunity. One of the boys holding drumsticks in one hand was rubbing his stomach as it twisted and turned in ways he was not liking. He wore a blue mesh shirt and black chained cargo pants with black and blue Converse. He wore leather arms bands with blue spikes on them and a blue nosering. His hair was cut short on the sides and gave him a mohawk look. He was bouncing his leg up and down, trying to fight off his nervous tension but that wasn't working very well. \"Man, I don't think I should've eaten that biscuit this morning,\" one of the bandmates said. \"Dude, I swear to god if you puke on me, you're going to wish you never ate,\" another bandmate threatened. The threatening presence next to the drummer was wearing a Slipknot t-shirt and regular denim jeans with Nike tennis shoes. His hair was spiked and he wore leather arm bands with a green skull in the middle. He was probably just as nervous as the drummer, but he didn't want to show it in front of the girls that were supporting the band. The guy next to the threatening kid chuckled a bit, making the leader of the group. The guy who laughed was wearing a shredded purple shirt with a black plaid fadora hat and black plaid chained vest. He wore black skinny jeans and converse with leather arm bands that had purple chains going horizontally across his wrist. \"Don't be so nervous, Allen. You'll look vulnerable,\" the hatted boy said, sarcastically. \"Stagnant Pulse, you're up!\" \"Yeah, I'm gonna start heaving,\" the drummer remarked, now feeling his stomach lose itself. \"Guys, come on, we've practiced this a dozen times. What's there to be nervous about? We've been together since middle school; no one's gonna kick anyone's ass for heaving a few chunks of biscuit. We have each other's support no matter what. Just see yourself giving it your all and you can't fail. Alright, guys, let's go,\" the leader said. He was the most calm out of the group. Vacious Ubersax, otherwise known as Vicious, was the vocalist and frontman of Stagnant Pulse; in fact, he was also the founder of the band and its mates. Since he was just a young boy growing up in Alaska with his little sister, Lara, he wanted to be an American rock artist like Chad Kroeger, Scott Weiland, Kurt Cobain, David Grohl, Axl Rose or even Dave Mustaine. There was always a sense of community and energy when he listened to rock n' roll and all of its content. He wanted to be a part of that. He and his band practiced for days, getting their songs perfect for this performance, and nothing was going to break them down now. They knew what they were going to open their gig with, and they only had three songs to get right. So Brian, the band's drummer, might heave some biscuit, at least he'll get back on his feet and play the rest of the way. If not, Colin, the bass player, could replace Brian at the drums. That's what they were prepared for since they were accepted to play on this station. The plane had finally landed in Los Angeles, California. Nicki was more than happy to get off the cursed plane and away from everyone on it. Her father, Mark Cabrini, was busying himself with pulling the bags out from above her head while her mother pulled her into the aisle to retrieve the small bags. Everyone got their bags and left out of the plane. Nicki followed her parents into the airport's lounge and noticed a woman holding a sign up high above her head as she looked about. The sign said Mark Cabrini and family. It seemed like the smallest things were going to remind her about her cheerleading squad back in her hometown. Farah used to hold signs up all the time because she was so tall, and she or Eda would stand next to her shaking their pompoms or cheering loudly to get the crowd's attention at the pep rally. What was that legend about cheerleaders and spirit sticks again? Oh, if it dropped, you'd be cursed for life, right? \"Daddy, that lady got your name on her sign,\" Nicki said, trying not to think about cheerleading legends and curses that follow. \"Hm?\" Mark questioned, looking up to see the woman with the sign. \"Oh! Hi, I'm Mark.\" Nicki watched her father run to the woman with blonde hair and waited with her mother. The woman came over to them after a few moments and directed them to a pick-up van in the parking lot. Los Angeles was a pretty city when you took a step back and just observed the surroundings. The palm trees were really full and tall as they reached toward the sun. Nicki got inside of the van with her family and just enjoyed the ride to her new home. An hour passed before the van finally stopped in front of a rather large two-story home. It was definitely larger than the small house they lived in back home. The house was a soft blue color and the windows were long and cut to perspective. The palm trees were small but nice. A little more landscaping and the house would be perfect. \"This the new house?\" Nicki asked, pointing to the ground in a circular motion. \"I guess so,\" Mark answered. \"I hope the rent is as nice as the house.\" \"You better hope the house note is nicer than the house,\" Nicki's mother, Geneva, commented. \"With you being new residents, we understand you're going to need some time to adjust to your new house,\" the woman said. \"Also, the utilities won't be on and working until five o'clock. Your furniture is in a storage facility right now and won't be moved here until another hour, so I'll give you a tour of the house and show you a map of the area.\" \"That's not too bad,\" Geneva said. \"It's after three now. Mark, show Nicki to her new school. I'm a stay with the lady.\" \"You sure, Jenny?\" \"Boy, go 'head. I'm a be alright,\" Geneva said, waving him off. Once she turned to the woman, however, she balled her hand into a fist and punched her open palm. She said, cracking her neck, \"Ain't that right, ma'am?\" \"Yes, we'll be fine,\" the woman said, terrified of death from a black woman from the hood. \"James, be a doll and show Mr. Cabrini the school he enrolled his beautiful daughter in. I'm sure you know where Nivaldo Gillian High is, right?\" \"Yes, Ms. Sanders,\" James answered, directing Mark and Nicki to the van once again. \"Alright. Come on, baby,\" Mark said, draping his large arm around his daughter's shoulders. \"We goin' to the school house!\"[Chapter 3] James, the van driver, and Mark, Nicki's father were talking in the front seats of the car as Nicki watched everything zip by in the back. They passed the most crowded beach in Los Angeles, but she thought it looked fun to rollerblade around in a bikini with an iPOD strapped to her back. There was a nice-looking ice cream dots stand, too. That could be something to look forward to. A skateboarder did a stunt on some railing before falling on his side. His friends ran to him, one with a camera in his hand, and the other one was asking if he was okay and smiled when he saw that he just stood back up and tried again. It was then that Nicki felt homesick instantly. She was wearing her earphones to keep herself busy and to stop thinking about her old school life. It was getting harder and harder, though. She felt like crying more and more as time went by, but she had to be strong for herself. She may be far away from her friends, but she could always make new ones. No one said it was going to be easy just a longer journey to happiness. Once she chose another reggae song to play on her Sansa Fuze, she looked up to see some high school cheerleaders walking towards a kiosk and reading some flyers. Now that she was away, would she be able to continue cheerleading in Los Angeles? She put her heart and soul into the Young A. Wessex Suns cheerleading squad. She didn't know if she could continue, especially with the knowledge that she won't ever be able to make captain. Spirit law in her school stated that no cheerleader is nominated captain unless he or she has attended a school since freshman year. Yeah, so those dreams of being captain were tarnished for good, but there shouldn't be any harm in checking out regionals or nationals. Besides, there was still gymnastics, dancing, and volleyball to keep her going. She had other interests, so she wouldn't be depressed for long. She was actually the only girl in her old squad who loved other things besides cheerleading and boys. Now that she thought about it, she wasn't going to miss her boyfriend, Daryl Joseph, at all. All he cared about was an ambitious woman with a big booty and if luck should be on his side some \"smokin' titties\" is what he would say. Maybe here in Los Angeles she could find a better boyfriend. A lot of actors and musicians move here to become international celebrities, and that took ambition, luck, talent, and intelligence. If lady luck liked her enough, she could probably find someone romantic and sweet but a little different and edgy. Being a girl from the hood didn't mean she was only into gangsters and thugs. When a bump interrupted Nicki's thoughts, she was finally able to see her new school peering back at her. Of course, it looked empty since it was still summer and no student wants to be at school over the summer, but its campus was large enough to make the school look deserted. The school building itself was a mix between an old Gothic church and a modern art facility. There was a metal statue in the middle of a fountain in the middle of the front lawn, and recycling bins were next to every trashcan. Apparently, Nivaldo Gill was \"going green.\" The campus was especially neat and clean to prove it. It was beautiful! The only thing that bothered Nicki about the school was its lack of flowers. That was a let-down, but Nicki believed she could fix that. She promised herself that before school started she would buy some flowers for the house and some for the teachers. No place was perfect without a little color, and Nicki was a girl who needed color to satisfy her now dull but potentially better life. As James pulled into the parking lot, Nicki took notice to the true size of Nivaldo Gill and realized it was a lot bigger in person than in posters. \"Damn, this place is huge,\" Nicki whispered, turning the music player's volume down. James parked the van in an empty guest spot, shifted the gears, and killed the engine. Nicki was the first to get out of the car and walk to the sidewalk in front of them. Mark stepped out of the van, put his sunglasses atop his head, and a made a disapproving hiss. \"Look at all that campus!\" he complained, walking to the sidewalk. He was no more than twenty or thirty steps from the van before he said, \"Anybody tryin' to lose weight can walk 'round the parkin' lot. Lose plenty pounds.\" \"Where are we goin'?\" Nicki asked, following her father. \"Counselor's Office to get your schedule together,\" Mark said, rubbing his round stomach. He wasn't exactly a skinny man, but he wasn't fat either. He just liked to eat. Mark turned to his daughter and said, \"You gon be goin' here from now on.\" Nicki sighed as she noticed banners hanging on poles that honored the founders of the school and the familiar armored knight mascot. She wasn't sure how she recognized anything related to this school, but something persistently told her that she knew this school. She asked, \"What's the name of this school again?\" \"Nivaldo Gillian, home of the purple knights.\" \"I know I've heard of that name before,\" Nicki said, thinking to herself of any possibility she may have had in crossing the name. \"I don't remember where, though.\" \"This might be one of them regional championship schools. They got a bunch of teams.\" \"Nah, their sports' teams suck,\" Nicki said, chuckled. \"I saw the records for the football games on yo' new Blackberry, and it wasn't that hot. They got a bunch o' teams fo' nothin'.\" \"What chu know about the football stats?\" Mark questioned, though a bit disappointed. He was a star football player himself in high school. \"The average winning for this team is two out of thirteen regional games,\" Nicki said, scoffing. This school made Wessex High's team look better; at least they won seven games out of the regional championships one year. \"So that's what? About fifteen percent of the time they might have a winning chance? Pfft!\" \"Well, alright, it's a little fall from grace of the football we used to, but we gotta make the best of it,\" Mark said, rubbing Nicki's shoulder with his rough hand. He pushed open the door and followed his daughter inside the Counselor's Office. Vacious Ubersax, the vocalist for Stagnant Pulse, was experiencing an emotional high and low as he walked from his car to the front entrance of Nivaldo Gillian. At times like these, he should be running around the school then to his girlfriend for a kiss and telling everyone that he got a spot on the radio and was able to sing a few songs as tribute to the Grunge movement and Thrash Metal. However, Vacious was less than excited as he should be. His girlfriend wasn't in his life anymore, even though he wanted her to be. He knew it was stupid to find love in high school because everyone knows you're a kid who should be studying but your friends pressure you into dating and sex, but he had genuine feelings for his sweetheart. Now, when he wants to shout about his successes to her, he just buries the euphoria deep instead and uses silence as maturity. Many in school think he's the cool kid who takes no shit, but he knows himself better than that. He loves being noticed for his talents in music; he loves hearing the praise from people who thought he was too different to make it; he loves having the opportunity to showcase his voice and lyrics and band. He just wished he could find someone to tell it to - someone who could see how hard he worked, someone who knew what he wanted to hear the most, someone he could talk to. It didn't have to be a girl, just a friend. Vacious made some decent friends among the goths at school and the circle of friends he had in the band, but he didn't have a best friend. Neither did his more outspoken sister, Lara, and she loved cheerleading. That cursed sport took away a lot of things from him and his sister: trust, optimism, a place to belong, passion. All those things were missing. As Vacious walked inside the Couselor's Office, he stepped to the sign-in chart in the office and read two names he hadn't heard before: Parent, Marquis Cabrini, and Student, Nicole Cabrini. Not wanting to think too hard about weird names, he shook his head then signed himself in for counseling. The minute he started signing, he saw a girl zip behind him and saunter over to the Kentwood water dispenser. She was probably the same height as his sister if not taller, had long legs, and she had a very clean hairstyle like a model or popular girl. The way she carried herself didn't seem like a popular girl or a model, though. Her swag was straight, in control, and mature like she might've been a senior who knew what she was going to do in college and no frat boy or pervy teacher was going to break her down, but Vacious knew a lot of seniors in NG High. No way would he miss a profile that hot. Though he was Alaskan-bred and raised in some shady neighborhoods growing up, Vacious wasn't always attracted to African-American women since a majority of them were into Denzel Washington, Jay-Z for hopefully the money, and some other people he would never hear about or be interested in. However, he did like how this black girl carried herself. He watched her bend over slightly to get two cups of water before noticing he was ogling at her butt. Just because a girl bends over in cute, striped shorts doesn't mean it's an invitation, right? Well, apparently, that didn't quite register in Vacious's mind. He tried to stay focused to write his name, but his eyes would wander back to the girl. Even as she drunk water, she held the cup from the top rather than the side which just fascinated him and made him thirsty at the same time. He turned to complete his name then licked his lips before walking to the water dispenser. The girl made good timing when a voice called out to her. She hurriedly filled the two cups with water again after drinking both cups down and walked to the direction of the voice. Vacious grabbed a cup, filled it with water, and then basically followed the girl to her counselor's office to overhear the conversation going on. \"Alright, Ms. Cabrini, it says here on your student account that you received some scholarship money.\" \"Which scholarships? I didn't have time to sign-up for any.\" \"You got the FANS Funding Program scholarship, which helps transfer students pay for their tuition for the first year at any school of their choosing, the LAF Grant, which gives transfer students money for books and supplies, and a work-study job at the cafeteria to pay for your lunch. This is all you have on your account. If you need more money, you can accept a loan from the school.\" \"We don't want to do that,\" Mark said, waving that suggestion off completely, \"so we'll work something out when she gets her syllabus. Is there a bus she can take to get here?\" \"Well, there's a public bus that runs through your area that stops two blocks away from the school; other than that, I don't know for sure if our school buses pass through your neighborhood. You would have to go to the transportation services on the second floor to find out.\" \"Oh, well, she can take the public bus,\" Mark said, accepting that suggestion over the other one. \"You gon give me bus fare?\" Nicki asked. \"Yeah,\" Mark answered, wondering why she had to ask that question. \"Alright, I'm a hold you to that. When are my hours for the cafeteria duty?\" \"You've got the morning duty from 7:30 to 8:30, and lunch duty from 10 to 1:30. You might be called for afterschool duty from 4 to 5 for the sports' teams, academic teams, and so forth.\" \"There you go baby. You can try-out for an afterschool team,\" Mark said, turning to Nicki and hinting he wanted her to at least try to cheer up and join a team. \"Oh, are you an athlete?\" \"Just cheerleading and volleyball,\" Nicki said, shaking her head lightly. No... Vacious thought, heart plummeting in his stomach. He took some deep breaths to control the emotional low that was beginning to overwhelm him then thought, It's okay, dude. You don't know anything about this girl other than the fact that she was a thirsty beast earlier. She doesn't mean anything to you. So what if she is a cheer-transfer? That doesn't mean anything to you, dude. Just calm down, calm down... \"Funny you should mention that. The cheerleaders are in the yard practicing right now; the volleyball team just left school for training camp, though. You just missed them.\" \"You wanna go check 'em out, baby?\" Mark asked. Nicki blew out a breath between her lips then said resignedly, \"Why not? It's not a guarantee I won't like it.\" \"Ready, girls?\" a teenager shouted, clapping her hands optimistically. \"We're gonna change the formation here to a right hip dip on 4. Alright, and 5, 6, 7, 8! And 1, 2, 3, dip, 5, 6, 7, 8! Good!\" The young teenager seemed to be a regular quirky girl at first glance, but, as she watched everyone's movements, her face turned red with dissatisfaction. She stomped over to the boombox, smacked the stop button, and began shouting her disapproval of some of the steps. The squad were very pristine and synchronized with a majority of their movements, but they didn't need someone pushing them to their absolute limit. They all were no more than eighteen years old at this point. Why push them to insanity over a little wrong move? Teresa Puccini, the curly red-head from a small town in Italy, cared a great deal since she was the Nivaldo Gillian Knights' cheerleading captain. She fought hard to be better than her previous captain, who was a striking brunette and cheerleading tyrant, but as she progressed to graduation with only herself to challenge her rule over the Purple Knights she was slowly beginning to realize why the \"spirit stick curse\" fell over all the captains at this school. She couldn't begin to wonder why that curse only wrecked a captain's insanity; she just wanted to win nationals this year without anyone's help and that included her own team. How she managed to make it this far was a wonder. \"Let's just take a water break!\" Teresa said, calming herself down. \"I'm just as tired of bitching as you guys are tired of listening. Hurry up, we only have one more hour before we talk about nationals this year.\" \"What's stressing you out, Poochie? You're normally a little more controlled than this,\" Teresa's brunette friend, Yonnie, said in playful concern. \"You already redid all the cheers and routines for us. Don't spazz out on us.\" \"Redoing everything was tough work alone since I made captain. I don't want the squad to hit rock bottom until we've gone sky high,\" Teresa said, flipping her curly hair over her shoulder. She looked out into the bleachers, noting that no one was there as usual, and tried to remember why she routinely looked in the direction of the bleachers. But, ever since she'd been working her ass off trying to rework routines her old captain drilled into their subconscious, she kept forgetting the reason she searched in the bleachers. Though she knew it was for a person, she couldn't really remember the face she was looking for. \"We are so dominating this year's regionals. I don't know how you do it,\" Teresa's blonde friend, Michelle, said with a big, confident smile. \"I do it the same way I got on this squad: with attitude,\" Teresa replied, heading to the bleachers to sit on one. It was then she began to remember why she kept coming to them. Her ex-boyfriend and the hottest goth in the school, Vacious Ubersax, used to watch her on the bleachers as he wrote songs in his \"Collections\" journal. It was on the third bleacher where he would play his acoustic guitar during practice. A bunch of the other girls would flirt with him, but he always had his attention to Teresa. When practice was over, they would play around and chase each other before he sang a sweet love song to her. Too bad her new boyfriend didn't sing to her like Vacious did; he wasn't a very good lay like Vacious was either, but that took practice anyway. How Vacious managed to have good bed skills for his first time was beyond her, but he was easy to forget about. At least her new boyfriend was the star running back and aspiring dentist. You can't fail in the dentistry business, but you can certainly waste your entire existence on a music career, especially if you're not as big as...Nickelbust, A7ten, or whatever those bands were called that Vacious loved listening to so much. \"Hey, Poochie, someone's dad is checking you out,\" a guy cheerleader said, pointing to a nearby window. Teresa turned to the general direction the cheerleader pointed in and saw a rotund man placing his rough hand under his shirt to rub his belly. She cringed her nose and said, \"Ew, he's not even that cute.\" Michelle turned to see a teenage girl next to the man. She waved at them in a friendly yet obnoxious manner and said, \"He has a daughter. Think she's cheering material?\" Teresa sighed, wondering where the goth pin-up boy might have been, but decided to think about more important things like someone's dad staring at her. She said, \"We'd have to see them up close and personal. She might be another nobody like those losers in the south. They make our losers look better. Did you see some of the skirts they were wearing? Their asses could barely stay covered. It was so cheesy.\" Michelle pouted a bit, trying to think of someone who wasn't cheesy among the Southern cheerleading squads. She remembered one girl and asked, \"What about that one gymnast in the Wessex Suns? I forget her name.\" Teresa crossed her long leg the sipped some water before saying, \"If you forgot it, she wasn't that important.\" Yonnie took a moment to think about who Michelle was referring to then suddenly remembered something, \"No, I know who you mean. There were four girls that stood out in the Suns. The big girl who had strong arm stances, the tall girl who practiced the helicopter, one girl named Unique, and another girl. Dammit, I can't remember her name! But she was good.\" \"I don't recall anyone being that good in the Wessex Suns except helicopter girl who I only saw do the helicopter,\" Teresa said, rolling her eyes and scoffing. \"Unique is a name, not a memorable performer. Fat girls aren't allowed on our squad unless they're good gymnasts or can hold up a pyramid; her fat jiggled stronger than her arm stances. Their coach would've made the best cheerleader on that cheer-tastrophe of a squad.\" \"Wait, the Cheer Camp didn't have coaches there,\" Michelle remarked, furrowing her eyebrows in confusion. \"Of course their coach was there,\" Teresa said in a matter-of-fact tone, \"or some choreographer they hired. She was the only one working with those losers.\" Yonnie pointed at Teresa's comment and said, \"That's the other cheerleader. She wasn't a coach; she was probably the captain.\" \"What good captain lets her team go around dressed in tight booty shorts practicing sloppy routines? Not even a great captain would let a team walk around that cheesy,\" Teresa said, placing her cup of water down. \"And if no one can even remember her name, she was just as forgettable as the rest of the Suns. Subject dropped.\" Teresa said, silencing any further conversation. She looked at her watch and noticed it was almost half past four. \"Alright, guys, practice is over. We'll meet here at 10:30 sharp tomorrow to finish this new routine. Get some sleep and get ready for early morning bitching.\" Mark and Nicki entered their new house with James to see the furniture perfectly set in place but still wrapped in plastics. Nicki's mother, Jenny, was opening the last box filled with dishes for the kitchen. She unwrapped one final cookout bowl from its newspaper and tape then placed it neatly in a drawer. James said his final goodbyes to the family before leaving out of the front door. Mark and Jenny began cuddling for a while as they put away flattened cardboard boxes in the recycle bin outside. Nicki decided to explore the whole house since she didn't get that opportunity in the beginning. The place was definitely bigger than her old home, and there was actually an extra guest room for someone to spend the night in. Her old house just had the three rooms and one-in-a-half bathrooms; this house had an extra of both. The good news about her new house was she got to have her own private bathroom. The bad news was she couldn't actually find her new room, but she did find a basement and the door to the garage. She walked to the end of the hallway underneath the stairs and found another door. She opened it, turned on the lights, and saw all of her things set in different parts of the room. She had wood floor in every part of the room except the tile floor in the bathroom and the carpet floor in the closet. Was that a walk-in closet? The walls were like a seawater green, which she didn't like at all but decided it was better than white, and her fan had dolphins on them. Whoever lived there previously liked the beach or something. The tile, wood, and carpet floors were all sandy colored. Yeah, she was definitely painting the walls a different color. That fan had to go, too. It wasn't that she didn't like dolphins and clean beach water; she just didn't want it in her room everyday. Good thing she knew how to paint and put tile down. The carpet floor could stay where it was, but the ugly spotted tiles had to go. Besides the ugly wall colors in her room, there were no flower gardens nearby. The first thing she was going to have to do was install a nice flowerbed by her window and maybe one in the backyard since her mother usually took care of the flowerbeds in the front yard. As Nicki looked at her furniture, she noticed nothing was matching with the stupid walls or floors. She was going to have to repaint everything just to match! But what colors would she use to match cream with cherry wood and light brown sand? \"Nicki, how you like your new school?\" Jenny asked, leaning on the door. Nicki turned around and smiled weakly before saying, \"It's bigger than the old one.\" \"I know it's gonna be hard to let go of your old life, baby,\" her mother cooed, wrapping her small frame in a warm embrace. \"It's only been a few hours since you left. If you want to cry, it's okay now.\" Nicki nodded then squeezed her mother's shirt tightly and let out her emotions into her bosom. Jenny rocked her daughter back and forth, knowing she was hiding everything on purpose so she wouldn't seem weak. Nicki was far beyond weak. She was quite strong in personality and in heart. As a mother, she knew how hard it was to have to leave a life so soon without many parting words. She knew because she had to leave her life in San Diego to move to Arizona then Texas and finally Louisiana where she met her husband, Mark. She bottled all her tears in until Mark gave his shoulder to lean on. \"You know, I had to move from San Diego away from my mother for college my second year,\" Jenny said, feeling her daughter's head pop up a little. Somehow her daughter's cute, little face reminded her of the fear she had with having a daughter: boys. Los Angeles was a different ball game with boys and daughters. She inwardly hoped that no tattoo-infested, headbanger or Compton thug tried to ask her out her first few weeks here. If that was going to be the case, her nerves would be tarnished. She ignored those thoughts and said, \"San Diego is a two-hour drive away from your grandmother's house. Maybe before school we can meet her at her house.\" \"You mean, Maw-maw Willa was commutin' from San Diego when she came to visit us every year?\" Nicki chirped through hiccups and tears. Her tears were beginning to dry with news of her grandmother being here. \"Mm-hm,\" her mother hummed, nodding her head. \"Let's go visit her over the weekend.\" \"Okay.\"[Chapter 4] Two weeks had finally passed for Nicki and her family. Her grandmother, Willa, was helping her get everything together for school tomorrow. Her clothes were finally in her new closet and dresser drawers, so all that was needed was to pull out anything the girl wanted to wear on her first day. Unfortunately, when Nicki, Willa, and Jenny went shopping to spend some quality \"mother-daughter\" time together, there wasn't much to do at the mall except eat. Most of the stores didn't have any event sales, even though school was coming up fast. Oddly enough, only jewelry, shoes, and purses were on sale the first day. Nicki got herself some nice pairs of shoes and a jewelry set, but not much else and that was particularly troubling for a girl her age. Most girls would be able to pick out something new and interesting from the mall, even if it was just a t-shirt or a book, but Nicki had different tastes like other different girls. She tried to convince the girl to get an animal hat like the kids were wearing now, but Nicki scoffed at the item and said \"I ain' wearin' nothin' that resembles a pawn shop bear.\" It was actually quite funny to hear her say things of that nature. As they traveled to the mall some more, Willa noticed Nicki had taken an interest in prom and homecoming dresses. She also saw Nicki turning away from the dresses and knew she was going to miss her old life while living this new one. Seeing the depression in her eyes made Willa realize Nicki was going to be completely alone here in Los Angeles. Nicki was a charming girl with a unique personality, but she had to be in a welcoming environment to show others that beautiful person. Los Angeles was a bipolar city: either the people were mean to one person or nice to everyone else, or the people were nice to one person and mean to everyone else. Willa had given Nicki a calendar to write down everything she may have needed to do at home like homework or nightly studying and another calendar for school to write down due dates for assignments, homework, and projects. She also made Nicki retell her schedule for tomorrow. The first thing she heard her granddaughter say was that she had to be sure to get a copy of the public bus schedule that passed through the neighborhood, so she went up to the calendar and marked that down for Wednesday since that's when school was starting. She also had to get a copy of her class schedule from the Counselor's Office. Enrollment was finalized, thankfully, so she didn't have to worry about classes. The mailbox and internet connection weren't in order quite yet, so she had to deal with keeping up with paperwork in the meantime. Not that she minded, though; it helped to have a hard copy of something. Nicki finished getting all her things together, sighed, and went to her vanity mirror to brush her hair. Her hairstyle had finally come out yesterday, so now she had the pleasure of wearing her hair straight down after flat-ironing it, but she couldn't exactly find her precious flat-iron anywhere. \"Maw-maw,\" Nicki chirped, gaining her grandmother's attention. \"Can you put buy another flat-iron on the calender for Saturday?\" \"Ya'll still didn't find the flat-iron?\" Willa questioned. \" 'Fraid not, maw-maw,\" Nicki sighed, brushing her ends first. \"I got a hot comb in my suitcase. Want me ta straight comb ya hair?\" \"Can you do it this weekend? It's gettin' late tonight. I gotta be up for 6.\" \"Alright, but it has to be before Sunday. You know, I got to go my sermons 'fore Monday 'cause ya never when ya gotta put a hurtin' on yo' daddy.\" \"But daddy not gon do nothin' wrong while he here,\" Nicki said, watching her grandmother leave her room with a look of 'yeah right' on her face. \"I don' wan' know what she talkin' 'bout no mo'.\" Nicki got up from her seat with the brush still in her hand and went into the bathroom to retrieve set-in lotion and leave-in conditioner. She plopped onto her bed, reaching for the remote, and turned on her TV to hear the weather reports for tonight and tomorrow. As she brushed out her hair and looked at the weather reporter, she heard screaming from the kitchen. It sounded close. She then saw her mother's shadow tugging at someone's clothes. Nicki hopped out of bed and raced to the hallway only to see her grandmother putting her father in a headlock and her mother waving her back into the room. \"Ah, mama, what the hell you doin'?\" Jenny tried. \"Nicki, stay in ya room! Stay in ya room!\" \"Get back, gal, unless you want some of this too!\" Willa shouted, snatching her wig off. \"I saw you feelin' on my daughter booty like I wa'n't here, boy! The Lord as my witness, you gon be a abstinent mofo, you hear me boy!\" \"Mama, he already got me pregnant once!\" Jenny said, trying to convince Willa that groping on her bottom was just Mark's way of playing. \"I'll be damned if he do it again, Geneva!\" Willa argued back, choking Mark to death...almost. Geneva managed to get her mother off her husband for a little while. Willa reached for her wig, placed it back on her head, and then stood up as if nothing happened to straighten out her clothes. Geneva turned to her husband, who was getting some comfort from his panicking daughter, and then knelt in front of him to see if he was okay. \"Baby, you alright? Did she pull something?\" \"Yeah, her wig off,\" Mark answered, rubbing his neck. Grandma Willa had a nice grip! He said, \"Yo' mama got ta get the hell up outta here, Jenny.\" \"Nicki, help ya grandma get this box,\" Willa called. \"Comin' maw-maw!\" Nicki wanted to kick herself for accepting morning duty for school. She had to be up for 5:30 in the morning just to catch a 6:20 bus that would take her to school in about fifty minutes down its route. The good thing was she would be dropped off at the bus stop right across the street from the school's back door where the cafeteria would be open. She stood in front of the back door, hoping it would be locked or that she didn't have to be here, but after she took a deep breath and turned the door's handle the door was nice, light, and easy to open. She rolled her eyes, scoffed, and then entered the cafeteria. It was spacious! There was actually a dip in the middle of the entire room where the tables were arranged like a mall's food court area. Above it were benches like the ones you saw at a restaurant lined up along the wall and near the exit was the area that she was used to. Little circle seats attached to long tables were aligned there. Nicki looked into the food court space again to see the mascot for Nivaldo Gillian High School. The minute she saw it, a look of shock and dread filled her face as she shouted... \"I remember now! The Gillian Knights, I remember! They were at Cheer Camp judging our routines. They're three-time winning national champions!\" \"Who are you?\" a voice questioned. Nicki snapped her head around and looked in an older woman's eyes. She was a round woman about her height with a scowl on her face as she eyed Nicki up and down. She was wearing a hair net, blue dress, and some white crocs. Her horn-rimmed glasses had pretty rhinestone beads hanging down, and her eyes were a beautiful shade of green. If the woman smiled a bit more and maybe changed her hairstyle, she would be quite the catch...for a lunchlady, of course. Nicki smiled brightly, surprising the woman as she arched one eyebrow, and laughed nervously to ease her embarrassment. \"Hello, I'm Nicole Cabrini. I'm the new work-study intern. I'm supposed to be on morning duty.\" \"Oh, the new girl,\" the woman realized, scoffing before laughing a bit. She was in for a long year, but she was cute so she thought about going easy on her for today. \"Go to the back, next to the restroom, there's gonna be a uniform for you to wear. When you're through, take out the garbage and wash out the cans for the janitors to put new trash bags in them. When you're done with that, wipe off all the tables so they look clean. After that, you can help me put the food in each of the buffets. A minute wasted is a dollar lost. Got all that?\" \"Yes, ma'am,\" Nicki answered, rushing off to find the restroom. \"New girl,\" the woman called, stopping Nicki. \"The restroom is to your left. Locker room is the second door to your right. Try to remember that from now on.\" \"Y-yes, ma'am,\" Nicki said, trying to figure out why there was a locker room in the back of a cafeteria. \"Well, get a move on,\" the woman said, waving a hand at Nicki to shoo. \"We got thirty-five minutes 'fore the other brats come in complaining their moms and dads don't care about feedin' 'em.\" \"W-w-wait, aren't you gonna tell me your name before I start?\" Nicki asked, stalling. \"Back in my day when I didn't want to do somethin', I tried to be as cute as you. Alas, here I am, lookin' at a spittin' image of my old self. Name's Beatrice, new girl. Now get the hell in there and change.\" \"Yes, Ms. Beatrice...\" Nicki mumbled, trudging to the locker room now. Lara Ubersax hated mornings. In fact, if she could pick a time worst than the first day of school, it was every Wednesday morning at 6:30. Thankfully, she could start a saving plan for the new year to buy her own car and insurance since her parents were already working early mornings and late nights with her father's full-time job and her mother's two part-time jobs. Vacious usually carpooled with his friend and bandmate, Allen Porters, but his car was a metal death trap. Perfect for the thrash/grunge metal band. Lara loved Vacious to death as her only brother, but he could just be a flat-out dick sometimes like today. Today, Vacious was supposed to wake her up so they could carpool with Allen to school, but Vacious spent the night over at Allen's to work on new material for other radio station gigs and didn't call for her to be ready. Her parents were rarely home as it was, so she had the house to herself until she had fallen asleep. Rising out of her bed, Lara went into the bathroom to check herself out in the mirror. As usual she looked tired. Not from work at Hot Topic in Antelope Valley Mall, not from sleep deprivation, she was just tired of being alone. Unlike her rockstar-to-be brother, she didn't have any friends other than maybe Angela, the one girl supporter of Stagnant Pulse other than herself, and being a goth who liked cheerleading didn't really do much for her either. Teresa Puccini, the new squad captain, made sure Lara stopped liking her favorite after school sport besides baseball. From what she heard on the radio last night, the punk rock benefit concert was going to be held some time after the UCA National championship. She had no doubts that the NG Knights were going for it this year. Tryouts this year were going to be brutal to ensure Nivaldo Gillian's place as four-year winning champions since the Rancho Carne Toros beat them out two years in a row, the East Compton Clovers won two years in a row, Pacific Vista won one year, and some other squads took them out until 2009 when the snobbish captain of the Knights got them their first trophy. With the pressure of being captain and trying to win her first competition, Teresa was probably going through hell...and that was all right with Lara. What goes around comes around, right? Exactly. Shaking her head, Lara took care of her daily hygiene and got dressed in some red plaid pants with a chain on the belt loop, a black t-shirt since it was still summer, plaid gloves, and black converse with a plaid red skull and shoe strings. She went back in the bathroom to hide her dark circles with black eyeliner and red eyeshadow before officially going to the kitchen to eat something. As Lara fixed two hot pockets, one egg, one piece of bacon, and one slice of toast, she got out the last bit of cranberry grape juice then turned on the TV. She started to grow curious about the national competition as she watched some of the weather channel, however. Wouldn't you know the weatherman says it's going to rain around lunchtime? The exact time when she has to go pick up her work schedule for the week is when it'll rain. Yeah, today was not going to be a good day. Suddenly, to her surprise, news on the national competition was on VH1 right when Breaking Benjamin's music video was ending. \"This oughtta be good,\" the teen said, tucking her brown hair behind her ear. Hi, I'm Tanner McRyan. I'll be your update news guy for the UCA National Cheerleading Competition. Now, you may be wondering why in hell does anyone care about cheerleaders, but a few weeks ago it was announced that iconic punk bands such as Green Day, Avril Lavigne, and Avenged Sevenfold just to name a few possible appearances were getting together as a support group to help young musicians experiencing problems at home or with health jumpstart their music careers and encourage them to donate to other charities like cancer prevention or go green. One of these bands will choose ten cheerleading teams from regionals or nationals that they think represents the purpose of the charity the most, and those cheering squads will enter another competition. Whoever wins that competition will not only appear in concert but they will also appear in a music video as part of a PA ad. More details on the competition dates, bands to appear, and more will be posted on our website. Just look up Punk PumpUp Details on our directory for more info posted by me. Lara scoffed, shook her head, and then turned off the TV. She said to herself, \"What a joke.\" With that, she put her dirty dishes away, grabbed her bookbag and house keys, and left the house to catch the bus. \"Alright, café's opening, people,\" Beatrice called, gaining the attention of the lunch staff. \"Let's get behind these counters. New girl!\" \"I'm still outside!\" Nicki called, turning the water back on to rinse out the weekend crap that was in the trashcan. Earlier, she had gotten some of it on her lip until she wiped it and her lipgloss off. She inwardly hoped she never took her lip balm treatment out of her purse. Otherwise, she was going to have one hell of a day. Luckily, it was her last trashcan. \"Well, hurry it up, you need to get the rules for the new policy here!\" Beatrice said, chuckling a bit. \"Coming!\" Nicki was finally done with the last can and set it aside. She ran out to where the staff were gathering and said, \"Ms. Beatrice, you can call me Nicole, or Nicki if you like. Instead of havin' to say new girl all the time.\" \"I'm old and I'm tired. I ain't got the time to be remembering no names; you see what I'm sayin'?\" Beatrice said, getting close to Nicki's face as she nodded hurriedly. Beatrice straightened up then said, \"Now, let's go over the new etiquette. Principal Berkley gave me last year's review summary for our luncheon and what not. Our ratings plummeted.\" \"What do you mean 'plummeted'?\" an older woman with blonde hair questioned. She was bit thinner and younger than Beatrice, but she was still one of the oldest staff members there. She didn't sound very surprised about the ratings decreasing, however. Nicki was probably the only one concerned about ratings plummeting. From a mathematician's point of view, a decrease in ratings was never good and it usually meant the quantity of the units exceeded the quality of the units' purpose. She began to calculate a basic percentage as an example to represent the rating. If the overall score for quality dining in the school was 5.5 and 100 students counted as one unit, theoretically ten units would equal 1,000 students , Nicki thought, gazing into space. Hypothetically speaking, if we're looking for a basic quality percentage, then we can say the overall score divided by the number of units is the basic decimal. 5.5 divided by 10 is just 0.55, and 0.55 times 100 is 55, so that means the basic quality percentage is 55%. That's not a bad average, but it isn't good either. The lower the percentage, the less students will eat during lunch and the moodier the classes will be. If the rating plummets to 4 with the same number of units as before, then the decimal will be 0.4 and the percentage will be 40%. That means 400 students will stop eating lunch, and some of the staff members are at higher risk of losing their jobs should the number increase in any way. \"Well, Miley, it means we sucked last year. Apparently, our rating dropped from a 6.9 to a 3.2. We all know how it is with the end-of-year surveys. They review us before the last week of school, and we always get crap statements like we don't smile enough or we talk down on them. They've yet to say that they try to stab us with sporks if they're ketchup is too cold for their sensitive little tongues. Or that we're simply using self-defense so the little savages don't eat our insides out 'cause they're nuts. What's really astounding, though, is that we've almost reached full capacity for this school. There's a lot more kids now who signed up for a meal plan or received some retarded discount from the government.\" \"Hey, Ms. Beatrice, how many students are enrolled this year?\" Nicki asked. \"Princey Poo says we got 3,568 students this year,\" Beatrice teased, making some people laugh. She noticed that Nicki immediately took out her cellphone but had a look of concern and intrigue as she pushed buttons. Beatrice raised her eyebrow and asked, \"What're you doing new girl?\" \"Math,\" Nicki answered, gaining the interest of the staff members as she stopped to think then typed something else. \"I need a percentage for what you're saying.\" \"Why do you need a percentage?\" Miley asked, seeing a decimal in the large set of numbers. \"To make you realize ya'll is close to losin' your jobs,\" Nicki said, satisfied with her answer but not with how small it was. \"You're serving food with 8.97% quality. If you keep working with a small number like that, over 3000 students aren't going to eat here. I'm surprised any of you are still here as it is. Ya'll gon be gone by the end of first quarter if the rating drops any further.\" Beatrice and Miley looked at each other in surprise as Nicki continued to explain how she got the quality percentage in the simplest terms. As the staff continued to listen to the girl, they grew to respect her and became somewhat attached. It was refreshing to see one person at least care that they were doing poorly with serving others. No one wanted to lose their jobs, even though they couldn't stand them, because they were all family in Nivaldo Gillian. Sure, working as lunch lady sucked some times, but it didn't mean it had to suck every day. When the bell rung for school to unlock the front doors and lock the back ones, Beatrice sighed then turned to everyone in new hopes that the new girl could help them get more people to eat here but also to be able to defend herself. Nicki was such a cute, little girl, and boys exist in every part of the world no matter what nuclear war tries to get rid of them. \"Alright, people, listen up. We didn't go over all the etiquette with the new girl, so let's break it down for her while setting up. Come on, new girl, to the register,\" Beatrice said, waving her hand for Nicki to shoo. She watched as Nicki ran to the back to wash her hands then put the hand gloves on. Beatrice smirked before realizing she was about to smile and said, \"First thing you should know, new girl, is to always smile for the kids. Personally, I like to imagine all my bills are paid in full for the year, so smile big and wide, say something nice, and don't snap no necks or you're fired.\" A tall, big-hipped woman came up to Nicki with some tongs and instructed, \"Also, watch your portion distribution. Every kid gets equal share; no one is a favorite. If you see a good-looking boy, don't fall for that face. Be firm and strong; he only gets one scoop like every other boy. If an ugly one comes up to you, give him two scoops. He might look better if he eats more.\" A tall, black man then proceeded to talk and informed, \"Now, sometimes, these kids catch an attitude because they want more food. This is a one kid, one meal policy. They don't like it, back of the line. If anyone jumps across the counter to choke you for more macaroni, call the cops or kick his ass. If anyone gets nasty with you, back of the line. Understood?\" \"Lemme get this straight. Be friendly to everyone if you can, watch the portions, and knock the shit out the crazy ones?\" Nicki summarized, feeling the 'inner thug' in her coming out. \"Think you c'n handle all that, new girl?\" Beatrice questioned. \"We good,\" Nicki said, cracking her knuckles then her neck. \"Bring it on.\" Unique Beaux was ecstatic this school year. Nicki was officially out of the picture as a candidate for the Wessex Suns cheerleading captain! Yes! She was going to be the captain for sure, and she could totally win Daryl Joseph's heart now. Her luck was finally changing! This year, she was going to be a better captain than her sister and her mother combined. Neither one of them could get their high school cheerleading teams to win regionals or nationals, but she was going to be the first to change all of that. However, she did have Nicki to thank for a lot of things. One, her choreography skills got them the vote for most potential to win regionals in their respective state; two, Nicki made some good suggestions for changing routines and uniforms; three, Nicki videotaped all her moves and the squad's dance steps. That little naive bitch gave Unique all the stepping stones she needed to come up with some kickass routines that would win everything. The only thing standing in her way now would probably be the financial support to get to Houston. Coach Adrienne was talking about the details for the cheerleading competitions now. Unique didn't pay attention to most of it since she didn't really care too much about that part. Yeah, they were going to need some money for Houston, but who cared? Nicki wasn't here and she was so going to be nominated captain. Daryl Joseph, star point guard of the Suns' basketball team, was watching everything on the sidelines. Like many of the other cheerleaders sitting on the gym's cold floor, Unique noticed that Daryl was seriously depressed. Normally, Daryl would be with his boys or something, but he was calmly watching the cheerleading squad and not pestering them in any way. Whoa, super shocker. The truth behind his depression was actually something no one would've guessed. He was sad because he lost his first love, Nicki. Ever since they were in middle school, Daryl wanted Nicki to be his girlfriend one day, and he managed to obtain that wish his sophomore year. As they got to know each other more, he wanted Nicki to be his first lay. She was his type: ambitious, cute, beautiful body - since he's the only one who's seen it out of uniform and into a swimsuit, dress, shorts, jeans, and all that good stuff, great dancer (he has two left feet), down-to-earth, super sweet, and surprisingly really smart for a cheerleader. He couldn't believe that she was just gone when Eda and Farah told everyone the news. How could her parents just take away his dream girl so fast? Daryl did come across as a jerk sometimes when it came to the topic of women and sex, but he was only interested in one girl to have sex with. Now that she was gone, he was going to have to find someone else to love and desire. It was going to be hard to find another like Nicki, though. She was the genuine article in his opinion. Without another word, Daryl scratched his head, feeling the oil spray from his haircut under his fingernails, and then left the gym. Poor Daryl , Unique thought, smirking deviously. Someone should comfort the sad, little boy. I'm sure he's going to need a woman's touch.[Chapter 5] Beatrice was feeling quite proud of her team. The new girl was blending into her role as a server and was attracting more of the male population to the breakfast area. If the principal could assign more cute girls and boys to the lunch staff, this cafeteria would be crawling with kids. However, she pushed her pride back and continued to monitor Nicki on occassion. Suddenly, to her dismay, the cheerleading squad entered the cafeteria. The redhead girl, Teresa Puccini, was just like Nicki when she first met her: cute, funny, charming, and full of spirit. She may not have cared if Beatrice and the others were losing their jobs like Nicki did, but she was certainly a pleasant young lady before she met that black-wearing punk. Inwardly, she was praying that Nicki didn't end up like Teresa in any way. She didn't want to see another charming young woman spiral into insanity because of some boy who can't keep his pants on. It pained her to see Teresa behave like a spoiled brat nowadays. Nicki went to retrieve a sandwich from the toaster before serving yet another junior with an adoring smile. The junior ended up flirting with Nicki like some of the other boys before paying for his food. Twice, some girls were flirting with her, but Nicki kindly stayed in her place and served them with the same courtesy as everyone else. Some football players shoved a few kids around to make an entrance for Teresa and her gang. The girls looked up to read from the menu and picked what they wanted. Lara Ubersax came in the cafeteria a little bit after the jostling occurred. There were a few people scattered around like usual, but lunch was the busiest hour. That's when she'll see everyone, including Vacious and his friends. She didn't really have any, so she just hung out with her brother and his gang. She changed songs on her iPOD and played Metallica's \"Fade to Black\" as she retrieved a tray from the side of the serving counter. As she helped herself to a few sides, she noticed that she was next to Michelle who was right next to Teresa. She turned the iPOD low to avoid speaking to the three cheerleaders that ruined her love of cheerleading and tried her best to fade away or become invisible. \"Hey, how can I help you?\" an unfamiliar voice asked. Teresa, Michelle, Yonnie, and Lara looked up to see a teenage black girl staring them in the face with a warm, gentle smile. Teresa was genuinely surprised that a cute girl like this one would work behind that counter. It was so uncool, but she had a pleasant voice and was being sweet. She then thought the girl probably acted sweet to everyone that came this far up the serving area. She wouldn't be surprised if the girl acted sweet with her boyfriend either. They probably bang each other senseless. Her lips looked experienced from the way she smiled and spoke. \"I'd like an egg sandwich with hash browns,\" Teresa said, smiling back at the girl. \"Alrighty, bacon or sausage, ma'am?\" the girl asked, pulling a long silver tray out. Teresa scoffed, disgusted by the suggestion of something fattening in the morning, and then wondered where the hell this girl came from. Even the people behind the serving area knew Teresa didn't eat the meat at school. They all were watching the new girl, as if they wanted to see what she'd say. Teresa questioned, \"What are you, new here? Pork is fattening, and cheerleaders don't get far fat.\" Lara put her head down, knowing the girl would just say an apology and roll over for the redhead, but was very shocked to hear... \"Take you and your attitude to the end of the line. Next!\" All the girls were godsmacked to see the girl change from such a sweetheart to a headstrong and angry woman. Lara chuckled a bit, happy that someone stood up to Teresa and relieved that she found someone who fought back. Teresa was not satisfied, however. She slammed her tray down and shouted, \"What the hell is your problem? I ordered my shit, so let's have it.\" \"Oh, I thought cheerleaders don't get fat,\" the girl said sarcastically. \"That doesn't mean that we don't eat,\" Yonnie retorted, supporting Teresa. \"Oh, really?\" the new girl said, fierce disgust in her eyes. She leaned close enough to Teresa before whispering ominously, \"Since you're so concerned with fat, let's have a quick rundown of some facts. Turkey bacon and sausage have more protein than regular pork which is a large contributor to obesity. It keeps you healthy so you can think. If you can't think, you can't remember even the simplest cheer; fact, you can't even stay on the squad.\" \"How'd you know they were on the squad?\" Lara questioned, realizing herself that the three girls weren't wearing their cheerleading uniforms. \"Oh, I know 'em,\" the girl reassured. \"I saw 'em practicin' befo' school started. To finish my sentence, you need a C average to stay a cheerleader, and a person who doesn't think doesn't get far anywhere. Take the sausage and sit down,\" the girl said, shoving the sandwich on the plate. She turned to the other people and shouted, \"Next!\" \"That's my baby,\" one of the tall, black men whimpered, wiping away fake tears. He was quite proud of Nicki as was Beatrice and the others. They all collectively smiled at her and laughed at Teresa's burning red face. Lara was ecstatic to have met someone who finally gave Teresa a snippet of what she truly deserved. She smiled a bit wider than she ever had and decided to order a bit more just to talk with the girl. For starters, she decided to say something now and that was, \"Impressive.\" Nicki turned to Lara and reverted back to her cheerful self. She asked, \"How may I help you, ma'am?\" \"Pancake slam with potatoes and eggs please.\" \"Shredded bacon or ham?\" the girl asked, retrieving the meal. \"Shredded ham, no syrup, and your name would be nice,\" Lara said. \"Nicole,\" the girl turned her head in suspicion before pushing whatever thoughts she had away and specifying, \"Nicole Cabrini.\" \"Lara Ubersax,\" Lara introduced, taking one of her earphones out of her ear. \"You know, I haven't seen you around here before. You a freshmen?\" \"No, I'm a junior,\" Nicki answered, chuckling a bit. \"I transferred here a couple of weeks ago.\" \"Really? I'm a junior too,\" Lara said, pointing to her chest. She cleared her throat and relaxed, sounding a bit too excited than she should be. She continued, \"Sorry, I got too excited there.\" \"Now why on Earth are you sorry for being happy?\" Nicki asked, passing the tray back to Lara. \"Ain't no reason to hide ya smile unless you wear dentures and you're 99 years old still trying to pass Geometry class. 'Sides, the boys like when you tease 'em. Show a little teeth not a little booty.\" Lara giggled for the first time in a while. She was happy to have met Nicole and hoped to see her around. Maybe this year she would make a new friend - her first girl friend. Lara went up to the register as the new girl waved her goodbye and said, \"Hey, Nicole. It was nice meeting you, keep the change.\" \"Thank you,\" Nicole said, smiling brightly. \"Hope to see you around.\" \"Yeah, me too,\" Lara responded, walking to a table close to serving area. The late bell rang for Nicki's first class of the day. Her hair was particularly messy since she had to wear the hair net earlier and didn't have time to brush it back into place. Hopefully, it wouldn't rain later on today; otherwise, she was going to be the wicked witch of the east going home. She looked down at her renewed schedule (since the Wessex High successfully transferred her credits) and rushed to class as quickly as she could. After all, she was already late. She was trying her best to look for her designated classroom, but the numbers for the rooms were so confusing. As she kept searching, she was patting her hair down and tying it up in a small rubberband provided by Miley. Good thing she was used to running to class this late back at Wessex High. Nicki started thinking about her old life again but quickly shook her head to escape old memories. This was her new home now. Room 2139's door was restained nicely. She could smell the fresh paint as though her father had just finished repolishing a peeling nightstand. Taking a deep breath, the teen straightened up, evened her breathing, and entered the classroom. Her teacher, Michael Pentone, was an attractive man in his early thirties who seemed quite friendly: his hair was a clean brown, his biceps were ripping through his shirt, he wore a nice purple tie, and in all honesty he had a cute butt. Oh, his eyes were a nice shade of blue, too. He had a mix between tan and fair skin, but it was healthy color and a nice glow accompanied the fresh look on his face. He furrowed his eyebrows in curiosity and discontinued going over the syllabus for his class. There were two sections in his classroom: the lab area and the lecture area. All the students were in the lecture area on the right side of the classroom. Vacious Ubersax and Teresa Puccini just so happened to be in the same class as Nicki and immediately recognized her face, but she hardly remembered theirs and didn't care to try and remember either. All she wanted to do was get this day over with. Vacious was inwardly happy to see Nicki again. She was especially cute today in her clothes: white undershirt with a yellow vest, black skinny jeans, and yellow flip-flops with cute white daisies on them. She'd make a pretty hot cheerleader if they did anything to change the uniforms for NG High. Teresa, on the other hand, was not pleased to see the girl who embarrassed her at lunch earlier with her smart mouth. She was going to make sure her life was a living hell in this school, and she was sure she could do it in a matter of this week alone. Since her boyfriend was a football player, she just needed him to unleash a few ropes on his dog team. Pentone was especially going to play an interesting role in this cutie's life. \"Can I help you, miss?\" the teacher asked, making the students turn around. \"Hi, my name is Nicole,\" Nicki introduced, smiling brightly. \"Is this Mr. Pentone's Physics I class?\" \"Yes, it is,\" Pentone answered, turning slightly away from his chalkboard. \"Are you new here?\" \"Yeah,\" Nicki replied, shuffling towards him. She handed him her schedule and pointed at some details for him to skim over before saying, \"I'm a transfer from Louisiana. I just got my schedule changed a few minutes ago.\" \"Oh, okay. Well, uh, have a seat in the front by that window. You'll have to look on with someone else to follow along for today. We have an odd number of students at the moment. After class we'll get you situated, alright, darlin'?\" \"Okay, thank you,\" Nicki responded, taking her schedule back. The minute Nicki sat in her seat and unpacked a small folder and sharpened pencil, gossip was starting to fly. This was all a part of school life anyway, though. It's not like she can't handle it. She started copying things from the board as Pentone was writing them and sparked an interest in the older man. Hardly paid attention to him as much as she did, and it was rare to see students write his sloppy notes. Other kids were starting to notice the looks Pentone was giving Nicki and realized that he was specifically giving her instructions. Amazingly, she followed along with him word-for-word and was the only one who asked to repeat certain things she didn't understand. This caught Pentone's attention that much more. Suddenly, a man came in the door and gained the class's attention again. He called for Pentone for a moment and began to speak with him outside of the door. Pentone turned to Nicki first to say he would answer her question later and then stepped out. Nicki took out her earphones for a minute to hear about the weather for the day and ignored her surroundings for a moment to listen. The kids around her just started talking. \"Chick's a goner,\" a football jock commented. \"She'll learn after class to watch out for him,\" a dance team member remarked. \"Tch! Yeah right. That loser's gonna be his pet by lunchtime,\" a flag twirler said. Vacious heard all these comments, being in the center of the room, and asked, \"What's wrong with being a teacher's pet?\" \"Mr. Pentone has a thing for the cheerful type. If she keeps it up, he'll have her in high heels and a thong with his name on it before the semester's over,\" the dance team member answered. \"Doesn't he get off on the prp then? All of you are optimists,\" Vacious reasoned in IM language. \"Dream on, Viva la Vacious,\" Teresa snapped. \"'Sides you're a prp yourself, radio boy. Every prp knows not to show-off in front of the Pentophile. Besides, he'll be the only sap who falls for her sweet smile. She's a b.i.d.: bitch in disguise.\" Vacious scoffed, angry enough to punch Teresa's arm but deciding better on it, and argued, \"If you assholes know the Pentophile has a thing for cheerleaders, why don't you tell her? And how do you know she's a bitch?\" Teresa chuckled quietly then responded, \"First off, she's not even a cheerleader; second, does anyone know anything about her? I didn't think so. I'm not telling her.\" Vacious was shocked, just plain shocked that everyone was going to let this new girl become a victim of some pedophile who probably forced young students to learn fluid dynamics for the wrong reasons. He was surrounded by complete jerks! Vacious rolled his eyes at the predictament and called, \"Hey, new girl. You can look on with me.\" \"Real? Thank you. You're so sweet,\" Nicki complimented, taking off her headphones and smiling warmly. Nicki turned her head and was surprised by her new helper. She looked into Vacious's beautiful brown eyes and felt her heart beat strongly. Nicki went speechless once Vacious started pulling a desk next to her, so she could look on with him. His hair was long and black, and he had a very handsome face with soft-looking lips. He had a nice build to him for a skinny kind of guy. His fashion was a bit peculiar: lots of skulls and calligraphy adorned his T-shirt and Converse shoes. Other than that, he had gorgeous features and was very attractive. \"She calls the creepy kid sweet? She won't make it before the bell rings,\" the football jock commented. Nicki was obviously not paying attention to the gossip behind her. She was busy. You know, watching her helper was far more important, right? He flipped his black hair out of his eyes, sat down in his seat, and pushed his Physics textbook over. He wasn't paying attention anyway, so he was just going to sit there and pretend to be reading. Nicki then took notice to the muscles in the dark teen's arms. She was aching to touch him, but she didn't want to be weird on her first day. \"Thank you fo - \" Nicki started, feeling the boy's rough fingertips pressing against her lips. Her weakest spot for a man was when they caressed her lips, and she especially loved a man with rough hands. Call it a fetish or what have you. Vacious also had a weak spot for a woman. His weakest spot was for a woman to pucker her lips or try to kiss his fingers, and he especially loved a girl with soft, plump lips. He called it a turn-on. However, he was not in the mood for a new romance with another cheerleader, and he wanted this girl to know he hated compliments of a romantic nature unless those compliments were being used to describe his music. He said, \"Stop. Just to help you, don't be all sweet for Pentone whenever you see him. He has a thing for the cheery type, and you're in his strike zone today. He probably has an erection the size of a laser pen right now. Watch your back and don't ever call me sweet again. Just look at the book and keep up in the class.\" Nicki had a hurt look in her eyes before that look changed to anger, even disgust. Vacious was surprised to see the changes in her eyes; it was remarkable for some odd reason. She took a deep breath, scowled deeply, and then changed her expression to say, \"Know what, man? Keep the book. I don't need your help.\" Vacious scoffed, rolled his eyes, and said, \"Fine. You're on your own with the pervert.\" Nicki simply popped her earphones back in her ears and kept her eyes locked on him. Vacious could feel the anger warm his skin from the girl's glare, but the minute he looked back up Nicki seemed disinterested and wasn't looking at him at all. Sure, he noticed that Nicki was into him, but he didn't think what he said could change her into such a calm, angry...bitch. She really was a bitch in disguise like Teresa said. He moved his desk back over in the other aisle, snatched his book and backpack away, and then nearly stomped off. Today was going to be rough. He started off on good grounds with the beautiful girl, but he had to say something stupid like he didn't like sweet compliments. Vacious knew damn well he loved hearing nice things said to him. He just didn't want to hear it right now was all. Now, on other circumstances like not in this classroom, he'd love to hear the beauty whisper sweet things to him. Thanks to Teresa yet again, he lost a potential girlfriend and she was going to be a hot girlfriend. Maybe one his sister would actually like. Feeling a bit peeved that he couldn't say something less mean to the cute girl, he turned to her and said, \"You know, some girls who've gotten involved with Pentone would kill for advice on how to handle him.\" Nicki took out her earphones and argued, \"Well, that's what's wrong with chu right now, black Buick: I'm not some stupid girl who lets their teachers just do whatever to 'em. I think about stuff.\" Vacious rolled his eyes, seeing the patches between them enlarge rapidly, and mumbled, \"Whatever. Don't start cryin' about panties up your ass when the Pentophile taps it.\" Nicki crossed her legs, leaned in her chair, and said, \"I've met worse people, Buick. Now, unless you want to fall behind, you might want to hurry to your seat and take very copious notes because I hear physics is what most, uh, what are you, a rock star? Yeah? I hear rock stars bomb in physics, but they love using dynamics.\" Vacious let out a shattered breath before nearly screaming, \"You are a bi - !\" \"Mr. Ubersax, I suggest you go back to your desk if you're changing your mind about sharing your textbook with the new student,\" Pentone said. Vacious didn't even hear the man come back inside the room. He said, \"Even rock stars, who make it up to this point in their academic career, should know the fundamentals of work and projectile motion. Have a seat.\" Vacious stomped back to his desk in the center of the room and made sure he was going to get revenge on Nicki for getting him in trouble. \"Are you alright, Ms. Cabrini?\" \"I'm fine,\" Nicki answered, smiling brightly and putting away her earphones. \"And rock boy, that's strike one for the day,\" the football jock commented, chuckling.[Chapter 6] It was lunchtime in Wessex High. Unique felt like she was at the top of her game. This afternoon was going to be her moment of truth for who gets to be the new cheerleading captain. Of course, she knew it was going to be her. No one else had the leadership skill or quality to take the role of cheer-dominatrix and bring the school a first place, second place, or some kind of place trophy. Nothing was going to get in her way this time. Unique took a deep, confident breath then applied some lipgloss to her lips before smiling cheerfully and opening the heavy, red gym doors. The minute she opened them, however, Daryl was in the midst of leaving. It was apparent that he was still upset about Nicki and her sudden move to Los Angeles, but to hell with that girl. Unique was always more confident than Nicki when it came to her body and her looks. So what if Nicki was gone? Daryl should get over her and fall for a real woman. She was ambitious just the way he likes, she had a beautiful body, and she was going to be the captain. A captain always gets her way and access to multiple perks: passing grades just to stay on the squad, sponsors from all around, and hot team player boyfriends. In fact, her first goal after she's declared captain is getting Daryl Joseph as her main squeeze and possibly her first lover. Nicki probably spoiled Daryl rotten; otherwise, he wouldn't even care if she was gone. \"Hey, Daryl, you been alright?\" Unique asked in a soothing, friendly voice. \"Yeah,\" Daryl sighed, looking into Unique's eyes. He felt something off with this girl; she was normally angry whenever he saw her. \"That don't sound alright to me. What's wrong really?\" she asked, caressing his arm then placing her hand on her shoulder. \"Nothing, I'm jus' confused,\" Daryl answered in somewhat honesty. \"C'mon, boy, tell me,\" Unique probed. \"I don't get how Nicki people jus' up and decide to move clear-across country. Like really?\" Daryl questioned, furrowing his eyebrows. \"The thing about it is she moved right when she came back from wherever the hell ya'll went for camp.\" \"Georgia,\" Unique interjected. \"Whatever,\" Daryl said, rolling his eyes and preparing to stomp off. Unique placed a hand on his chest and cooed, \"Hey, hey. You know, you're not the only one who's confused about this. I wouldn't be surprised if she knew from the beginning that she was movin'. I mean, what kind of parent doesn't tell their child that they're moving to another state that isn't within driving distance?\" \"Real talk,\" Daryl nodded, agreeing with the girl in front of him. \"I mean, if you think about it, what could Nicki gain from tellin' nobody that she was leavin'? You know, Los Angeles is the home of a bunch of famous people and cheerleaders there enter nationals every year no matter which team sucks ass. She like dancin', right?\" \"Yeah,\" Daryl answered, not quite seeing how dancing relates to Nicki moving to Los Angeles. \"Well, while she's in LA doin' her thing, mommy dearest might try to put her up for choreography. Once Nicki gets recognized, she'll be meetin' other guys and won't have to worry about breaking up with you later. It's almost like a plan. Let's say she wasn't gonna do dancin' for a career, she still got cheerleadin' and there's probably hundreds of high schools in California alone that'd take her under their wing. She'll get to nationals, win some trophy, and she'll forget all about this school like it was a dream but with black people in it. See, Nicki can do anything she wants in LA. Nationals, music video fame, rich boyfriends? Think about it. Nicki's probably in the best spot of her life, but what if she already knew all of that? She had to know somethin'; otherwise, there'd be no reason to leave. She could have just as easily told her daddy she wanted to stay here with Eda and Farah. She could've even said she wanted to stay with you, but she didn't even try to fight her daddy back. Don't get her twisted. I think she knew from the start, so I'm not mad that she left. Fact, I wish her the best.\" With that, Unique left Daryl in a daze and entered the gym with a devious smile. She saw two of her best and only friends in school waving at her and sauntered over to them in her new excitement. After a few days pass, she'll have Daryl eating out of the palm of her hands. It was all a matter of time, especially with what she just told him about her number one rival. Yeah, Nicki was in the best spot of her life at the worst time. \"Whatchu smilin' all big like that fo'?\" one of Unique's friends asked. Her name was Sherice (a.k.a. \"Sherry Cola\") and she usually had a boyfriend every week. \"Let's see. Now that Nicki's gone and there's no one to run against me for captain, I don't have a reason not to smile anymore. Fact, as far as I'm concerned, this whole school and whoever likes that deceivin' hussy can kiss my ass.\" \"Alright, ya'll,\" a tall girl with curly hair greeted, walking in the gym with a paper. \"I have some good news, bad news, and truly ugly news for this year. Which one ya'll wan' hear first?\" \"What's the ugly news?\" Eda asked, taking a sour straw from Farah's pack. \"We don't have enough money to go to regionals, buy new uniforms, or help buy concessions for the games, so we pretty much broker than the coffee cup that fell off the dinner table.\" \"What's the bad news?\" Farah asked, drinking a one-liter Fanta. The tall girl put her clipboard against her chest, sighed then pouted, and said, \"Nicki's mom called last week to tell the school that Nicki wasn't go'n be in this school no mo'. Eda and Farah just told us a couple of days that Nicki and her people moved to Los Angeles.\" \"What!\" the squad questioned, with exception to Unique, Farah, and Eda. \"Yeah, ole' Brini's gone to the West Coast,\" the girl said. \"But the good news is we still have a nominee for Wessex High cheerleading captain. Ya'll been good, faithful athletes since the beginning of your careers, and with ya'll new captain I hope you continue to be just that and more. She'll lead you through the financial struggles as best as she can and help you obtain the recognition you know you deserve. So let's hear it for your new captain... Unique Beaux.\" Unique jumped up from her seat and started hopping and screaming at her victory. Eda and Farah looked at each other, knowing they were in for the worse, and just shook their heads and clapped. They couldn't really change the ballots since all the votes went to Unique as runner-up, but if they could at least try to use some of Nicki's ideas that could liberate the work that was going to kick in once regionals' competitions started. They only had a few months. Unique can't possibly think of raising money to replace uniforms, concessions, and transportation to regionals and nationals that fast on her own. Not even their current captain, Jody Beaux, could think of an idea in a few days. \"Now, this year, I'm only going to be co-captain to make sure Unique doesn't abuse her rights as captain. After that, though, she's captain 'til graduation. Coach Higgens go'n go over the Spirit Law and rules for the routine, so pay attention and ask questions if you need to. What's up, Farah?\" The squad turned to the tall girl as she adjusted her sitting position. She asked, \"If we have an idea to raise money can we tell the both captains?\" \"Yeah,\" Jody answered, making Unique scoff silently. \"What's your idea?\" \"This somethin' Nicki thought of before she left, but I thought it'd be okay to use. She said - \" \"I don't think it's a good idea to use a squad member's ideas without permission from the squad member. Since Nicki's not here, we don't know if this is your original idea or if you're stealing ideas from her,\" Unique said, convincing Jody to be on her side as she nodded. \"That's true. Did you ask her if it was okay? I'll use her idea personally, but you never know,\" Jody said. \"Nicki said it was fine. She said it could earn us about 2,000 dollars if we do it right,\" Eda remarked. \"She said what we should do is put up 90 dollars and buy some supplies for the students from Walgreens and stuff while everything is on sale. Then put like two pens, a folder, some pencils, erasers, and highlighters in a bag and sell it for a dollar. If we put up an extra 50, we can sell art supply bags for like two dollars. During lunch, we can sell like granola bars or something small for like fifty cents to a dollar. If we keep doin' that, we'll have 2 to 300 dollars a month. On the side, we can do other stuff to raise money.\" \"That's good. I like that,\" Jody commented. \"Fine. We'll do Nicki's idea for the time being since we got nothin' else to start off with. But from here on out, we do it my way,\" Unique said, silently threatening Eda with a vicious glare. \"All other ideas are to be original. No phone calls to former members, got that?\" \"Whatever,\" Eda mumbled, rolling her eyes. \"Good,\" Unique replied, hearing the bell for lunch to be over. \"We practice our routines for the first pep rally first thing tomorrow after school. Five laps if you're late.\" \"New girl!\" Beatrice called, frowning visibly. She was practically hunting for the new staff member of her team. Beatrice kicked the back door open, wondering if Nicole was washing the trashcans again, and then looked both ways before noticing that Nicki wasn't in the back. Nicole was actually busy replacing the trashbags for the garbage cans and recycle bins before her lunch duty in fifteen minutes. Unfortunately, since this morning, she had run into Vacious Ubersax twice during the first half of her hectic day and Teresa Puccini only once. Apparently, she shared Physics I, English II Honors, and Spanish II with Vacious, which she wouldn't have minded at all if he were nicer to her in the beginning. She then began to think about the black clothes-wearing boy and started blushing. He really was cute and his hands were practically calloused. Suddenly, the image of her grandmother wearing Rey Mysterio clothes and dive-bombing on Vacious made Nicki realize she was just staring into space and thinking about some guy. She didn't even think about Daryl this much. \"New girl!\" Beatrice roared, standing akimbo and frowning. Nicki snapped her head to Ms. Beatrice's voice so fast a nerve in her neck gathered into a bundle and made a burning, tightening sensation right beneath her ear. She sucked in a breath between her teeth and hissed. Her mouth hung loosely as she moaned in pain, but she couldn't be rude or leave lunch duty on her first day of school anyway. Her finances didn't allow that. \"Yes, Ms. B?\" Nicki answered, rubbing her neck for a minute or two then smiling at the older woman. She said, \"Are there lunch duty rules I have to follow?\" \"Nah, most of 'em are the same as breakfast duty,\" Miley answered. \"The only thing that's different is the greeting.\" \"The greeting?\" Nicki questioned. \"Yeah, that's right. Unlike breakfast duty, lunch duty is where the most reviews kick in and that means you have to be extra sweet to these nutballs,\" Beatrice responded, scoffing. \"Let's go over the greeting. Miley, the smile.\" \"Every student has to have the same greeting, so what we've all developed is the Little Miss Sunshine smiling face, or the LMS smiley. It goes like this. First, you give a little wave - not a flirty wave - as if you've been friends for a week or two. Then, you say 'Hey, what can I serve you today?' Lastly, you flash a sexy, corporate American grin that suckers them into thinking you're a total bff and that makes them buy a bit more. You see, what most people don't know is if you can grasp the essence of a professional smile, you can sell more stuff for no apparent reason. Here, we call it the stock market.\" \"Alright,\" Nicki commented, not fully understanding the connection. Being a former cheerleader doesn't save her aching cheeks. She was almost through with smiling all the time. Nicki sighed, shaking her head, and then turned to say, \"Gotcha, Ms. Miley.\" \"Now, we'll see how well you manage the LMS smiley,\" Beatrice said, huffing to the register. \"Get to the serving area. It's only one lunch period for the whole week 'til Princey Poo's block schedule starts. We gotta make sure the kids get what they get then we're gonna move you to the teacher's lounge. You're gonna be learnin' from me there.\" \"'Kay, Ms. B,\" Nicki mumbled, walking behind the serving area. Once she got in her spot, Nicki rolled her eyes at the sound of the bell then erased her attitude and turned into an upbeat teen. Beatrice fought the laughter about to spew from her lips and sat on her stool. She was reminded of herself whenever she looked at Nicki or watched her complain. Sometimes she remembered her old high school crushes when she watched the boys flirting with Nicki. In a small way, Beatrice wanted to protect Nicki just as her mother wanted to protect her. Boys do stuff, let's face it. Once they start reaching that phase where girls are the \"it\" thing to worship besides cars and money, the girls have to wise up fast and be trained on how to handle them. One particular boy that Beatrice watched out for was the goth kid, Vacious Ubersax. His sister, Lara, was such a sweet girl, but if it wasn't for her brother and his girlfriend she would be a star cheerleader and probably wearing less black than usual. Vacious could change any woman he wanted into a demon without intending to do it. Beatrice didn't want him anywhere near Nicki for any reason. Unfortunately, the goths were always the first to lunch, which was the oddest thing for a group of kids who could give hell about the world or people. Even the creepy kids have to eat, though; it's a matter of survival. Beatrice watched one of the goth girls walk over to the serving area and ordering something from Nicki before turning her full attention to the group of black-wearing kids. There were only four people, but there were usually about ten to thirteen of them at the ends of the tables where shadows were prominent. \"Excuse me,\" the goth girl called, gaining Beatrice's attention. \"I'm paying for my lunch.\" Beatrice looked down at the tray, calculated the sum of the items, and typed in some numbers on the calculator. She scowled and said, \"$10.45. Card or cash?\" \"Cash. New girl gets a tip. Fifteen bucks,\" the girl said, handing Beatrice two bills. \"Try not to cheat her. She's a good kid.\" \"We know,\" Beatrice said, smiling softly then putting the money in the register. Nicole earned herself just about seven bucks in tips , Beatrice thought. Keep it up, kid. Lara was placing her new textbooks in her new locker this year. It had to change since more people enrolled this year and she had to switch homeroom teachers. She was a bit disappointed after not seeing Nicole since this morning at breakfast. She hadn't eaten breakfast at school in two years, but she at least had something to look forward to every morning. She wanted to tell Vacious about her new friend, but it wasn't official quite yet. She had to be sure that they were going to be friends and then slumber parties and talking about boys would come later. She hadn't actually talked about those things since middle school. Geez, Lara, how much more excited are you going to be? It's only been a few hours and you're already thinking about telling her your dream wedding. We're trying to make nice friends not scare the girl! Lara thought. \"Everyone out of the hall in two minutes,\" the disciplinarian bellowed. Lara closed her locker door then locked the combination lock onto the latch. She picked up her bag and left the hall to the cafeteria. School was crowded as usual but not too crowded since her last class was on the first floor. Algebra II Advanced was on the second floor thank goodness. She paced her way passed a bunch of other students who didn't like or wear black and walked in the cafeteria. The crowd was a lot bigger than outside the doors, and there were boys parading to one spot in the serving area. That was a sign that the new girl was there. Lara inhaled happily then hurried to get a tray. Out of nowhere, some jock tossed a wet piece of bread to his friend, who couldn't catch a ball to save his life, and laughed when it hit Lara in the face. Lara's mouth slowly hung open as she touched the buttery substance on her face then grabbed the bread and flung it back at whoever threw it. The bread hit someone in the eye. Abruptly, jocks started swarming towards her; however, the minute she almost cowered, Nicki and a campus officer were behind her. \"Hey, what the hell are you doing throwing things?\" the officer questioned. \"Hey, are you okay?\" Nicki asked, looking concerned. \"Nicole!\" Lara said, turning to Nicki. \"Hey, you're Lara, right?\" Nicki questioned, pointing at her fellow junior. \"Ah, you remember, huh?\" Lara said, teasingly. \"Course, Lara's not a hard name. Now, if you had a hard name, I'd never get it right or remember it. Did you get hit or someone else?\" Nicki asked, turning to the jock. \"Yeah, I think it was garlic bread or something.\" \"Hmph...\" Nicki scoffed, retrieving a warm cloth. \"Well, at least it was just bread. Here, wipe your face. You got some seasoning on it.\" \"Thanks. So, is that long line of boys for you or did you say something was free?\" \"Nah,\" Nicki said, laughing. \"I think it's the same ones from this morning. I remember one o' dem had a Bob Marley necklace and he just bought two pizzas. This morning, he bought a pancake slam. Since I'm on this side, what would you like today?\" \"Cheeseburger with onion rings. No tomatoes please,\" Lara said, watching Nicki gather everything. \"You know, I haven't seen around lately. You sure you're a junior?\" \"I'm quite sure. It's only been half a day; I'll see you around sixth period or somethin',\" Nicki joked, placing Lara's order on her tray. \"Don't lie to me. I'm gonna start lookin' for you,\" Lara cutely threatened. Freakin' hell, Lara! You probably scared her! Lara thought. Why are you being so weird? \"You a mess!\" Nicki remarked, laughing. \"Ms. Beatrice go'n ring you up, hea'?\" Lara walked away from Nicole with a warm smile on her face and felt genuinely proud of herself and happy. She paid for her lunch and walked toward the familiar corner where the goths were. Even though she had a thing for cheerleading, she also had a love for dark poetry and was kind of a romantic. Even if Nicole didn't love her love of dark romance and imagery, she might like the cheerleading thing. Lara opened her ketchup packets and started pouring its contents onto the cheeseburger. She turned back to Nicole from time to time as she put her earphones on and started thinking about cheering again. It was a pity she sat around people who hated cheerleaders, jocks, and anything potentially athletic and pointlessly noisy because they would take the punk rock cheerleading competition by storm. They loved punk music, would be instantly famous and at the top of the popular person pyramid, and could get other jobs besides supporting benefit campaigns. However, most of the goths she sat around were only interested in supporting one person within their own group: her brother, Vacious. While he was busy earning the attention of radio stations and night clubs, she slowly dwelled in his shadow and she hated it little by little. Talking to this new girl, Nicole, was beginning to be the relief she needed. Speaking of Vacious, Lara turned to see him walking through the cafeteria's front doors with his best friend, Allen. Lara realized sometime last year that Allen had a crush on her, but he didn't tell her or Vacious about it. He just so happened to let it slip when Lara ordered pizza for the band while they practiced. Since Vacious usually worked over the summer all day and very little during school, he hardly ever had to ask Lara to pay for food but that day he was broke until next payday. Since that time, Lara has paid very special attention to avoid Allen if he came by. Allen was a nice guy, but he wasn't Lara's type. Today, Lara planned to avoid Vacious and Allen and just stay close to Nicole; instead, though, she watched her brother change expressions. He went from being a playful, talkative guy to a demonic playboy. Concerned, Lara quickly got up with her tray in her hands and walked over to Vacious. As she got closer, she heard the oddest conversation take place. \"Hello, what can I get for you today?\" \"Well, if it isn't my fav newbie,\" Vacious responded in a seductive growl. \"Didn't think you'd be working the buffet. That inner bitch in you come out yet?\" \"Nope, I've been a very good girl,\" Nicki said, deception of joy in her eyes. \"Really? Because earlier you were checkin' me out and flirting with your customers is considered inappropriate. Oh! Is that a big word for you to remember, my little goody-goody?\" Vacious teased, deliberately lowering his voice to a sensual whisper. Vacious was once again taken aback by the change in expression the new girl emitted. As he watched Nicki become a seductive vixen, he practically melted in her confident smirk and mischievous eyes. At that moment, he knew they would never mend the pieces in their broken relationship. It was too shattered to fix and quite regrettable. She leaned over the counter, puckering her lips the way she knew (or had to know) Vacious liked, and licked her teeth before chuckling lightly. She said in probably the sexiest, raspiest voice Vacious ever heard, \"Not as big as your failure for trying to piss me off because it is epic. Anything else you want to try to say to me?\" \"Suck...my...cock,\" Vacious hissed, now pissed at the girl. Inwardly, the pervert in him wanted to see her lips work a penis, but he wasn't going to even admit that. He just wanted to shut the new girl up and make her life a living hell. If she begged for mercy, maybe the sucking of his genitalia would be the edge he needed to forgive her, but until then...yep, those lips were going to be put to really good use in the future. \"When you learn to speak to a woman nicely and maybe stop trying to impress the people around you and just be yourself, you can get the whole nine yards: a sucked dick, a kissed ass, and possibly the best sex of your short life. Since you don't know how to talk to girls or accept compliments from girls, you're gonna have to live with an un-sucked cock, an un-kissed ass, and an STD because I'm cursin' you for life,\" Nicki threatened, displaying a devillish grin. \"Chicken sandwich meal for two plus two oatmeal raisin cookies coming right up.\"[Chapter 7] I'm sorry. This chapter is actually really short, but I thought I should at least update it while I beta someone else's story. Farah Lockheed was pouting all day, even during lunchtime. She missed Nicole. The bell rang for school to be over, so she walked with Eda to the bus in the back of the school's yard. Here, they used to practice routines or dance just to be crazy and have fun. Sometimes, Nicki would randomly come up with cheers or walk over to freshmen or people who were by themselves and have them join in on the fun. She was just an all-around happy soul who could make people smile. She missed being able to see Nicki's face when she and Eda would eat Twinkies and marshmallow-peanut butter sandwiches. She would start praying for them not to get diabetes or junk food comas. Once, she even offered them her lunch and would starve herself before she dared touch their lunch. As she boarded the bus with Eda, she sat by the window and turned on her iPOD to listen to different songs while they waited to be dropped off home. They were always the last ones to leave. Eda missed Nicki just as much as Farah did, but they both had hope in meeting her again if they passed regionals this year. Tonight would be their first webcam conversation since Nicki left. They wrote notes to each other in class, wondering about what to say to Nicki since she left. Eda had just finished writing all of Nicki's ideas for fundraising and the game schedule for this year was being written up in the meantime. She was full of hope, but in the end she missed her friend. Eda wasn't pouting but she was watching out for Unique. She's been following Daryl all day and she already knew why. Daryl was a funny dude anyway, though. He mostly dated Nicki to prove he could get her virginity before anyone else. Ha! Devil is a lie! If Unique wanted to be stupid and date Daryl, she could have all the fun she wanted. Nicki probably found herself a better man on the plane ride to Los Angeles. There were fine men all over the place in that city. She would be just fine without Daryl. Plus, a lot of talent was lurking around in LA. Nicki was always a pretty girl, so she might find a musician or actor who was good-looking, too. \"Farah, you think we should tell Nicki about Daryl and Unique?\" Eda asked, trying to spark up a little conversation. Just because Nicki was gone doesn't mean they weren't still friends. They could talk to each other. \"No, Nicki not gon care 'bout dem,\" Farah answered, waving her hand at the notion. \"We just gon tell her about Unique bein' captain and what she said 'bout fundraisin'. I wonder what school she went to. She could probably be a cheerleader in her new school.\" \"Unless she comin' to nationals, she would want to be a cheerleader. How else we gon be able to see her?\" \"We could stay over by her house for a little while.\" \"Oh...\" Eda droned, thinking of an idea. You know, to say Farah was a bit of ditz, she could be a genius sometimes. \"Girl, if we go to nationals we won't have to stay at no hotel! Nicki live in LA. We can just stay with her for nationals!\" \"Girl, you the truth!\" Farah remarked, stomping her feet with Eda as they wrote down a couple of things to say and do about nationals. Things were definitely starting to look up. Farah then turned the page for ideas and noticed Eda wrote uniforms at the top. Below the title, Nicki drew a quick sketch of the Suns new uniform. Their old uniforms had a long red skirt that covered half the knees, black stockings, orange tennis shoes, and a yellow long-sleeved shirt under a red, orange, and black top. Nicki's sketch completely changed the look of the squad. The skirt was black and reached as low as mid-thigh and the shoes were also black. The undershirt was instead red and the top was red, orange, yellow, and black. The Suns' logo was yellow and had orange outlines, but the top itself was red and black. She forgot that they had to figure out what to do about the other two sketches for uniforms. \"We gotta talk about the uniforms, too,\" Farah said, taking out a magazine with different uniform colors and styles. \"The principal said we can't have high skirts or stomach-showing tops.\" \"That's cuz she scared o' thugs,\" Eda said, getting Farah to laugh. Nicki was ready to leave Nivaldo Gillian High School forever. She didn't want to see another trash can, cheerleader, goth, or jock until tomorrow. She was just done with school. Ever since lunchtime, she had been angered to the point of wanting to punch someone. She did, however, notice that she had two classes with Lara and managed to speak to her after class before she was almost knocked down by one of the football players. After that, the black-wearing guy who had been mean to her since early this morning in Physics I with Pentone was persistently picking on her about being bitchy or slutty or a mixture of both. She still didn't even know his name. Lara never actually heard what he said, but Nicki thought it might have been a good thing because she was close to punching him in the balls. Since then, she has just been ready to go home. As she walked down the hall away from seventh period, Nicki noticed the school's mascot walking towards her. Nivaldo Gill's mascot was a medieval knight named Henry the Awesome, Duke of Cheer. His plastic and fiber armor was silver, and he wore a white and purple jersey with a cape that had the coat of arms of the school on it. His shoes clanked on the floor since that was made out of some kind of hardened plastic painted metallic silver. The face of the knight had him sneering with a competitive growl. Of course, he was cheering other people up and making them laugh. Some of the girls asked if the mascot had a girlfriend to which the mascot mimed \"Sort of.\" Nicki knew that gesture. It meant he had his sights on someone, but she wasn't really responding to him much. To everyone else, it was read as a 'maybe.' One of the boys that was next to the mascot had a radio on his shoulders and was playing a couple of rap songs that the mascot willingly danced to. It was actually kind of cute when the mascot tried to pop. He did do the stanky leg really well, but the popping thing was an absolute no. Nicki was about to pass up her locker as she watched the mascot. She quickly remembered she had to retrieve a couple of books to read over the chapter for tomorrow. While she was getting her books, her favorite black-wearing friend came by to pay her a visit. Vacious smacked the back of her head, making her snap her head around, and then hopped as he walked and put up one of those gangster hand signs. His friend, Allen, was next to him, laughing a little at the gesture. Allen didn't realize the two were enemies. In fact, he thought Nicki and Vacious were flirting with each other. \"Later, cheer-pimp,\" Vacious called out, grabbing his crotch and sticking his tongue out like the rock star he aspired to be. Then again, it could have been a secret 'Suck this dick' gesture. Nicki took a deep breath before going back to getting the books out of her new locker. She had a lot of decorating to do to it. She said to herself, \"Positive thoughts, positive thoughts, positive thoughts.\" As she packed her book bag, Nicki noticed a tap on her shoulder. She turned around then saw the mascot getting down on one knee. Thinking it was proposing to her, she started hyperventilating. The mascot looked down at his position then realized this was the common proposal stance made by society. He shot up quickly then instead faked like he was kissing Nicki's hand, causing her to calm down and smile at him. \"Thank you, Henry,\" Nicki said, chuckling a bit. \"Ahem, the Awesome,\" the radio teen corrected. \"Be awesome if you could smack a few people in the face with that radio for me,\" Nicki scoffed, packing the rest of her books in her bag She bent over for a second to look for her schedule and daily planner, not realizing she was probably mooning a couple of people behind her. No one was behind her, though. Henry and the radio teen, however, sneakily went behind her to see the full roundness of her ass. The radio teen was the first to comment as he leaned his head over along with Henry. \"Oh, that's nice,\" he complimented, seeing Henry forming arcs with his hand gestures, implying a perfected roundness to the shape of Nicki's ass. \"Careful, man, you don't want that. It's diseased with the bitch syndrome,\" Vacious warned, making Nicki stand up and turn around. \"Vacious, let's go! Allen's gonna leave soon!\" Lara called. Vacious winked at Nicki, putting on his best 'I'm your worst nightmare' face, and then said, \"See ya tomorrow, cheer pimp. Rep it up.\" Nicki rolled her eyes then picked up her bag, slammed her locker shut, and then walked in the opposite direction of the middle stairway in the hall. She instead stomped off to the back stairway and went down the stairs. Henry took off his mask after everyone was gone and revealed a shy, charming teenage boy. He had stringy, brown hair after sweating in the suit for an hour, chocolate brown eyes, and fair skin covered in a few freckles and a little acne give or take. He also had braces that did little to hide his handsome, high cheekbone features. He looked in Nicki's direction and started wondering about her and Vacious' relationship for a minute. \"Wonder what she did to get Vacious to be a dick,\" the teen said. \"I dunno. But she sure was cute,\" the radio teen replied. \"So true. I mean her butt was a perfect sphere. How are you born with a symmetric ass?\" the mascot questioned, walking off to the restroom. \"Alright and 5, 6,..., 5, 6, 7, 8!\" Teresa Puccini was busy perfecting the squad's routines. Of course, Clover, one of the sloppiest cheerleaders in history, couldn't get the damn routine crammed in her ass far enough for her to know it like the lines on her hands. She was beginning to feel frustrated with her. It was a shame for the academic coach to determine who deserves to be on the cheerleading squad or not because Clover would be gone by now. The first pep rally for the year was in a couple of weeks; in fact, it was this Friday, which was in two days! Oh, but little miss floppy feet over here, couldn't get that through her thick skull! God, she couldn't wait to start legally drinking! \"Stop!\" Teresa demanded, turning off the music. \"Clover, get over here.\" Clover was a bright, charming girl with a glowing face and button nose. She had blonde hair that covered her neck and shoulder blades, nice slim figure, and was particularly flexible. She could do the stunts spot on, but the routines themselves were her weakest points and that isn't good for the squad or her. Teresa yanked Clover off to the side then showed her the routine step by step. They did it together about three times, and then Teresa watched her do it on her own. \"You're doing it again,\" Teresa spat out, earning a confused look from Clover. \"You keep tripping yourself when you pivot and then you try to cover it up with an extra step. Give yourself some space to turn. You've got enough elbow room to decorate a five-star kitchen. What is wrong with you?\" \"Well, sorry, geez,\" Clover responded, looking to the side. She noticed Nicki walking down the sidewalk while talking on her cellphone at the same time. She looked like she was in a hurry. Teresa looked in the direction Clover was looking in then saw her enemy. She scoffed then folded her arms as the new girl walked passed them, not even paying attention to the cheerleaders practice. She looked toward the jocks, pointing at her and making weird faces at her to try to gain her attention, and called out to her boyfriend. \"Alex! Shake her up a little. I wanna lay down some laws with her.\" Her boyfriend took one of his teammates footballs then got in position to throw it. A segment of the fencing was sectioned off to make an entrance/exit to the bleachers, so Alex decided to throw the football through there in hopes of hitting the new girl in the head or something. It would be too awesome if he did it. He threw the ball at a perfect angle, and it landed a hit on her hip. She snapped her head around, looking down at the ball spinning in front of her, and then reached for it. Alex was running towards her with a goofy grin on his face, waving a hand to say that the ball was his. He only slowed down when he got close enough to Nicki to see her face turn into a seductive grin. Feeling flirty, Alex swaggered toward Nicki instead and produced a seductive grin of his own but it hardly exuded the amount of sex appeal Nicki emanated. She put on an exotic sexiness to her smile. Teresa watched as Nicki walked up to Alex, gaining his full attention with her flirty walk as she twirled her hair in fingers, and started to grow angry as Clover giggled at her face. Within seconds, Nicki dropped the flirt act and shoved the ball in Alex's face hard enough to nearly break his nose then slapped him across the cheek. She stomped off then went back to talking to her dad on the phone. \"Hello? Hey, daddy, whatchu wanted? Oh, no, just some white boy thinkin' he was gettin' my number,\" she explained, hearing her father fuss on the phone. \"Before or after I shoved a football up his nose? Tch! I ain't playin' wit' dese people.\"[Chapter 8] \"Dude, what time do you go to work?\" Oscar Reynolds. Stupid name, right? Well, tell that to the Reynolds' family. The entire clan has stupid first names, but Oscar was one of the more normal. He was sixteen, standing at 6'2\" with a skinny frame and 7,000 biological allergies. He wore broken-rimmed glasses, his hair was never combed, and his skin was a pale white. He hated going to Nivaldo Gillian High, but if he stayed here until graduation with a 4.1 average his chances at Princeton University as a chemistry major would hit the roof. He just had to find something to look forward to in this school, but there was hardly anything to look up to. He didn't have many friends, and the few friends he did have barely spoke to him in public. Being called a freak for so long started to define his existence. Oscar was really a nice guy and was a big romantic. He didn't have much luck with girls, though. At least, not like how he had it when he was a freshmen. When he first came to NG High, he was a sweetheart and a lot of girls would ask for his number. Once the first homecoming dance came around and he was asked to be a horny girl's date, his life changed forever and he became a freak, a nerd, a womanizing geek. He hated it. He hated going to school. He hated being everyone's punching bag, but he didn't know how to fight back. He just took it like a champ and kept living in his own filth. He wasn't the only one who suffered, though. He had his legion of doom to sympathize with: Ignacious Peyton, Heoung Wulong (aka \"Ginyu\") and Nina Wulong. \"No work this year,\" Oscar said, walking next to his friend, Ignacious, to the bus stop. \"Too much to do. I have to study, compete in chemistry events, make sure the pep rally assholes get good enough grades to stay on the teams. You know, the football team alone has scores so low, they need a traffic cop to direct them to your ass.\" \"Pfft, maybe they should just live there.\" Oscar laughed at Ignacious' comment then said, \"Yeah, next to the hot douche. Front row seat to your toilet bowl.\" \"Dude, that'd be so weird having apartments come out of your ass!\" Ignacious remarked, chuckling. \"It'd be like space travel.\" Ignacious is a hardcore gamer who loves hot women, action movies, and getting everyone hyped up about something. On his own, he could make a party out of nothing but a mustard bottle and a rubber band. Some students liked him for his social skills and ability to cheer people up or on, but he was still a nerd and considered annoying after too much hype. The fact that he helped the mascot, who was Oscar himself, during pep rally season earned him some credibility but not enough to be considered cool. Ignacious's father was an architect while his mother was a local and celebrity florist. From them, Ignacious learned how to make some really cool party themes. He just never really got much of an opportunity to use his skills other than planning out birthday parties and Christmas themes. \"Hey, guys,\" a young Asian teen greeted, cuddling Oscar. \"Hey, Nina,\" Oscar greets, giving her a hug. \"Ginyu!\" Ignacious called, earning a high-five. Heoung, or Ginyu, is a heavy manga reader and anime fan. He wasn't much of a talker, but when he did speak he usually had something important to say. He loves music, wearing costumes, and designs his own cosplay costumes for conventions. On his own, he could turn a room into a club with a mixtape and a stereo system. He was the DJ in disguise for Oscar when he goes out as a mascot and does his thing for pep rallies. The other DJ, and his arch rival, Adrian Hunter, was most notably the school's DJ. Adrian stole a lot of Ginyu's mixtapes during class and only returned them a week after he used them up. Sometimes the CDs would be damaged. When Ginyu got enough money to buy a second iPod instead of carrying three cases of CDs, it made it harder for Adrian to steal his music. However, that didn't stop him from taking his iPod or leftover CDs that weren't on the iPod yet. Because of Adrian's selfishness, Ginyu is notably recognized as the costume dude who likes Adrian when he actually hates him. Ginyu's dad works in movie productions as the music director, and his mom is a capital accountant with an electric company. Nina is Ginyu's sister. She doesn't really hang out with her brother or his friends that much, but she does visit to practice trying out for the cheerleading squad. None of the boys have the heart to tell her she'll just be turned down until graduation next year. Nina loves cheerleading and is really good at doing the stunts, but, when it comes to the cheers or catchphrases, she sucks and the squad turns her away every time. Oscar tried helping since he has to deal with them every pep rally, but she was too offbeat. She cleaned up as cheerleader with her routines but that was it. Ginyu provided the right tune for her to move, Ignacious was good at hyping her up, but there was no music or hype at an actual rally or game. She had to find the hype in herself, which was hard when she looked down on herself so much. Yeah, Oscar, Ginyu, Ignacious, and Nina were a community on their own. There was always something kicking their ass in life, but they got through it together. Sometimes, they wished their lives would change for the better sooner, but good things came to those who waited. They knew each other's pains of being an outsider and not fighting back their enemies. \"Ready for the new year, guys?\" Nina asked, sparking some conversation as they walked side by side to the bus stop. \"You gonna tryout for cheerleading again?\" Ignacious asked, feeling an aggravated groan about to make itself known. \"I think I might give up this year...\" \"What?\" Ginyu exclaimed. \"You've never given up on anything no matter how many times things got bad. What would father say if you did? He's proud of you when you keep striving for what you love. He said it himself!\" \"Happy holidays to you, too,\" Ignacious said. \"You haven't spoken since last summer.\" \"Didn't have a reason 'til just now,\" Ginyu said, shrugging. \"I dunno, Heoung. I can never get the stupid cheers down no matter who's the teacher. I make the grades, I do the stunts, but... I dunno... maybe I just don't have enough swagger or rhythm.\" \"Swagger is a sense of style. Rhythm is a flow of movement, sound, or words. You've got it in you. You're either scared to get it out or need someone who can get it out for you. Keep trying,\" Ginyu advised, rubbing Nina's shoulder. \"There's not nearly enough big brothers out there like you,\" Nina said, skipping to the bus stop ahead of the boys. Once they got to the bus stop, they saw another teenage girl waiting for the bus. She was texting or looking up something on her cellphone before putting it away and watching cars zip by in the street. The outcast group didn't know how what to make of the girl, but with Nina being the most outspoken and preppy she cleared the air for them. \"Hey,\" she greeted, getting the girl to turn around. \"Hi,\" the girl responded. \"I'm Nina. What's your name?\" \"Nicole. Nice to meet you, Nina. I like your skirt.\" Nina looked down, giggled a bit, and then said, \"Thanks, I got it from the athlete store downtown. They sell cheerleader stuff there.\" \"Really? I'm a cheerleader,\" Nicole said, gaining everyone's attention then. \"Well, I used to be at my old school.\" \"Really? That's awesome! I used to cheer in middle school, but, after that, the high school varsity cheerleaders kept turning me down every time they have tryouts. It's a big conspiracy theory there. What school do you go to now?\" \"Nivaldo Gillian.\" \"Really?\" Nina questioned, looking at the boys who were looking at Nicole. \"We go to the same school!\" Lara was ecstatic to be home, but her brother, Vacious, knew how to ruin a mood. He decided to invite Allen over, and he might not know it but his best friend just so happens to have the hots for his little sister. She was so stoked they both were graduating this year. She didn't mind Allen as a friend, but he was...a jerk. He was rude, had a bad attitude, and he snuck weed around in school. She did not want that kind of guy in her life. Running up the stairs to her room, she opened the front door and tossed her backpack on the floor. Her bed looked so inviting. She plopped onto the mattress and sighed, letting her back feel the cool, soft cushion relax her spine. Vacious was downstairs searching for drinks in the refrigerator while Allen turned on the TV. VH1 was making another announcement about the cheerleading competition, making Allen switch to MTV to watch Guy Code instead. \"Why'd you change it?\" Vacious asked, opening a strawberry Fanta soda can. He leaned over the countertop while drinking then wiped his bottom lip free of sweet liquid residue. \"You don't wanna accomplish your dream of being a man-leader?\" \"Dude, I swear to Christ, I will kill you in your sleep if you even whisper that word again,\" Allen threatened, smirking. He nodded, catching a Fanta that Vacious threw at him. \"Why don't you be a man-leader? Even with your good arm, you refuse to join the football team or even the baseball team. You may as well be a spotter to look up a few skirts. Least that way you can get with that black chick.\" \"Pfft, whatever,\" Vacious scoffed. \"Okay, you are not about to sit here and lie to me. Dude, I watched you go back to her locker, which I have no idea how you found. I mean, that's some sketchy, stalker shit. And after playing around with her, you went back to see her bend her ass over?\" Allen asked, making Vacious glare at him. \"You can't stand there and say you're not into it. I have proof committed to memory.\" \"Goths and cheerleaders don't mix,\" Vacious reasoned, rolling his eyes. \"The girl's a bitch. She hates me; I hate her.\" \"Oh, really? 'Cause Teresa is a cheerleader and a bitch but you still went out with her,\" Allen said, turning back to the TV and opening his soda to drink it. \"Jenna sent me a text, too. She said her mom bought extra taco stuff. Want any?\" \"Well, beats McDonalds. Hey, skank, Jenna's comin' over with taco stuff! Wanna make some?\" Vacious called from downstairs. Lara officially wanted an escape once she heard that name. Jenna was the epitome of a soulless person. Her voice had no life or enthusiasm in it. Yeah, goths are usually known for not having much enthusiasm with the world and everyone in it, but that didn't mean they sucked the life out of everything around them! It just meant they hated life or its situations. Lara groaned then forced a Jack Skellington plush pillow onto her face, implying she wanted to just smother and die, before she thought of a plan to get away from her brother's annoying friends. \"No, I'm gonna go run some errands and get groceries. Thanks, though,\" Lara replied. \"Don't make partying an errand, skank,\" Vacious called, teasing her with a smile. Lara chuckled, moving the pillow, and said to herself, \"Dumbass.\" Teresa Puccini was getting a gut feeling that something bad was about to happen, but she pushed those thoughts aside and looked at her cheerleading squad. This Friday was the first pep rally. For the squad to have maximum support, she needed a routine that would blow everyone away. Why? The teams sucked, so the squad had to cover for their screw-ups. Plus, with enough popularity, they could earn more fundraising money to get to nationals and win the title of defending champions again. Since she recorded a lot of the cheer camp squads' material, she just meshed in different moves to create an original routine. One of the stunts a Georgia team did extremely well was that wolf's wall. It was perfect and covered for the screw-ups the man-leaders did trying to help out with the helicopters. \"Alright, let's try a wolf's wall to end the routine,\" Teresa commanded, earning some protests from the squad. \"Why are we doing the hardest pyramid to be invented? We don't have that kind of skill,\" a girl voiced. Her name was Hannah Menendez, one of the best gymnasts on the squad. She hated Teresa's attitude and was pleasantly surprised when that girl from earlier shoved a football up Teresa's boyfriend's nose. \"That's why we're gonna train for it,\" Teresa snapped. Hannah scoffed then rolled her eyes as she returned to her position. Teresa called out the eight-counts and watched the routine from the audience's point of view. It was clean, cut, and perfect to them, but it was still rough around the edges for her. She picked out where the wolf's wall was going to be and began to make decisions in her head. She nodded to one conclusion then spoke. \"Chloe, you're the left corner of the wall,\" she commanded, watching the blonde airhead run to her position. \"Hannah, you're center. Yonnie, you're right corner. Spotters, in position.\" \"What's goin' through that head of yours, captain?\" Michelle asked. \"I'm gonna shove that first place trophy up Marcy's ass and whoever else thinks they can beat me out of nationals,\" Teresa threatened, smiling evilly. She turned to the squad then said, \"For now, we'll take it easy until the first pep rally. We'll do a few 3HE routines then step it up each time. To make sure we stay on top, we're gonna meet up with a few choreographers to add some spice to our moves.\" \"Well, let's make sure we still have time to get to class. God knows how much that dumbass academic coach can be a bitch,\" Michelle remarked. Teresa chuckled then called out the eight-count. They practiced about three times, trying to get the girls in the right position. When they finally got it right, Teresa cheered for them. That's when hell broke loose upon her psyche. The spotters bounced a bit to prepare for Chloe to come down, but they put too much force into the bounce and she went flying through the air. All anyone heard was a scream, gasps, and then a loud THUMP! Chloe screamed in agony, holding her arm and writhing in the grass. \"Ow! Ow!\" Chloe moaned, tears about to fall from her face. \"Whoa, someone call an ambulance!\" one of the male spotters ordered. \"Teresa, her arm broke!\" Hannah screamed.[Chapter 9] Teresa was convinced that she was cursed. She watched the ambulance take Chloe away and pinched the bridge of her nose in frustration. Chloe was their MVC, most valuable cheerleader for those who didn't know, and, with her out of commission, they were in trouble. That means the pep rally had to be postponed, their routine had to be changed within a few days, and nationals would be further away from her grasp than before. FYI, that was not an option! She was so furious in that moment her head began to spin uncontrollably! Michelle and Yonnie tried to talk to her, but she just shook her head and stomped off to think. She would have to run tryouts earlier in the year than anticipated. First things first, though, she needed a plan for the upcoming pep rally and some ulterior motive for the new students to even want to consider joining the squad. They couldn't get another cheerleader ready by tomorrow to go over the routines for Friday. Unfortunately for her, that was out of the question so rescheduling was in order. Tryouts would have to take Friday's place instead. \"Yonnie!\" Teresa called, earning a swift turn from the brunette. \"Do they have any major TV events in the area?\" Yonnie checked her iPhone for events and spotted one. She cheerfully said, \"There's a competition right after nationals for a benefit promo. A couple of rockstars are gonna be there!\" Teresa scoffed and questioned, \"Pfft, rockstars? The thing that Vacious wants to be but is short of talent for?\" Michelle quirks an eyebrow then flips her curled hair with an indecent thought crossing her mind. Truth be told, Michelle had her eye on Vacious for a while after Teresa broke up with him, and she could see that Vacious clearly had talent as a musician. His voice was very unique with its gruff sound in rock and roll, smoothness in R & B, and a soulful variation in pitch and tone. He could go the distance with the right songs, right album, and maybe the right girl to be his muse. That's what Michelle wanted really. She wanted to be the muse, the groupie, the \"it\" girl so celebrities or even aspiring ones would come flocking to her and she could be more than just some cheerleader. Cheerleaders don't get paid much, but her choreography could get her some well-deserved attention. Speaking of which, Michelle decided to speak first this time. She asked, \"Is he still on about being rock royalty?\" \"He never gave up on that dream even after we broke up,\" Teresa replied. \"Neither has some of those talent scouts who keep their eyes out for him. I must have missed something major with him - \" \"Ha! You popped the guy's cherry at the tender age of fourteen. What'd you miss?\" Michelle asked, earning gasps and quick laughs from Teresa and Yonnie. \"Guys don't have cherries, Chellie!\" Teresa remarked, pushing Michelle playfully. \"Besides, if he really didn't want it like he says to some people, he would've stopped me before shredding clothes.\" \"Well, he is a hottie, and he was on the radio last week,\" Yonnie commented. \"Plus, he's not a virgin. Girls'll eat him up,\" Michelle remarked, making sure a good enough distance was between her and Teresa. \"Just sayin'!\" Teresa chuckled and then said, \"Did you hear the rumors about him crushin' on the cafeteria girl?\" Michelle gasped, hooked her arm into Teresa's and demanded, \"Spill!\" \"He's been stalking her since this morning,\" Teresa informed, walking to her pink Monte Carlo with a blue sheen glimmering in the sun. \"His band buddy, Allen, saw him staring at her ass three times the whole day. And... he knows where her locker is. One of the dance team girls even caught him taking a picture of her schedule on his phone!\" The girls gasp at this new information as they hop into Teresa's car and begin to laugh a bit obnoxiously. That was something they could use to their advantage. Vacious had the right idea. Keep your enemies close and them up whenever they're the most vulnerable. Oh, this was going to be a fun first quarter for the year! While the cafeteria girl was not an ugly teen, she didn't really scream rock royalty or rockstar hottie or anything that a rockstar would be interested in unless they really loved food that she doesn't even cook. The fact that Vacious was even remotely interested in another cheerleader, which he has been adamant about avoiding since his fling with Teresa, was a huge shocker. Michelle decided to question aloud, \"Do you think Cafeteria Girl was really a cheerleader? Cuz if she was, she might tryout.\" \"Pfft! Puh-lease,\" Teresa started, revving up the car before pulling off. \"That disgusting bug of a nerd is cracking down on the extracurric's more than ever now that school's started. If we keep her distracted from her studies, she'll be lucky to even walk through the gym doors.\" \"Let's keep an eye out for her,\" Yonnie suggested. \"I hear she's cool with Lara, and she was pretty good before Marcy the Martyr Bitch ruined her. With her gone and two top girls ready to go, they could be your biggest enemies.\" \"As though!\" Teresa scoffed, knowing full well Lara was too damaged to try to come back to cheerleading. Nicki was finally off the bus and on her way home. Not to say she hated the bus because she did make some new acquaintances: Oscar, Ignacious, Nina, and Heoung. She just wanted to be home because of the day she's had, but she can't even say that much. People have had worse days. This was child's play. As she tried to cheer up, she noticed a smoothie cart a little ways away. The guy serving smoothies was especially cute. He had long, wavy, black hair that reached his shoulders, somewhere between green and brown eyes, and his skin was a perfect tan color like a Latino. While he didn't have a full-on beard, the guy did have facial hair cropped close to his face that wasn't necessarily thick or thin. It made him seem older than a teenager, but she could see the youth in his face saying otherwise. He had the best lips, too! Now, if she were a slut (and she's not), she would definitely take him home. When she was about to pass him up, he called out to her in a smooth, low voice. \"Que pasa, mama?\" the smoothie guy asked, making Nicki turn to him. \"What's wrong?\" She looked around to see if someone else was behind her, knowing no one was but wanting to see anyway just in case, and then looked at the guy. She pointed to herself and said, \"Me?\" Smoothie guy chuckled and replied, \"Yes, you.\" \"Oh, uh, nothing. Just a bad day...\" Nicki responded, looking down at the ground. She looked up to see the man raising an eyebrow and then corrected herself, \"For me!\" Smoothie guy hummed and then began scooping blue ice cream in a small bowl silently. He decorated the dessert with a dash of cotton candy pieces and put a cute pink spoon in it. Nicki wanted to ask him out to dinner at that point. She much like her best friends Eda and Farah loved a man who could cook or do anything related to culinary art. Shaking her head slowly to avoid any lustful thinking, Nicki just watched him...and his arms moving. She does have a bit of an arm fetish. The man was finally done and said softly, \"Here you go. Try to cheer up, mama. A bad day is just a test to get you to your better days.\" Oh my god, he's so hot! Nicki screamed in her head. What I gotta do to get YOUR number? I need you in my life. \"Thank you,\" Nicki said, ignoring her thoughts. If she would've said them, Smoothie guy would've freaked out and left. She ran her lips over the spoon to let the ice cream melt on her tongue on its own and moaned a little bit when the sweet treat sunk into her taste buds. When she swallowed, she complimented in her typical fashion, \"Damn, that's good! Oops, my bad. How much for it?\" The boy laughed, flashing his perfect square teeth, and said, \"Free sample. You try to cheer up, though. You're too pretty of a girl to be angry like that.\" I want him ... Nicki thought. Lord, thank you for bringing him in my life . I'm sorry I'm cuttin' up right now, but you know I want him ... Nicki ignored her thoughts again and cooed, \"Thank you. I'll buy one for myself tomorrow if you're still around. Unless you givin' out mo' samples.\" \"Tomorrow's perfect,\" Smoothie guy replied, tucking a lock of hair behind his ear and showing off his arms. \"I come around this area two days a week then the skate park another two days. After that, I go wherever I want to go. If you come around while I'm in the area, I'll let you try out something new.\" \"Alright, I'ma hold you to that,\" Nicki said, pointing to the man and then skipping away from him. Well, her day just got a bit better. Another three blocks to enjoy her fantastic sample of ice cream and she'll be home free. Smoothie Guy was right, though. She should cheer up. Her first day wasn't exactly ideal, but it could have been much worse. The quality of boys in her life changed drastically within a few days. She went from Daryl, one of her school's top football players, to Vacious, the rockstar wannabe guy, and now Smoothie Guy. She was hoping to see him way more often than the previous two. His ice cream was so good! Of course, she had to focus on her studies more because her new school had much higher standards than her old one, but she felt she would be okay. If Smoothie Guy and her new bus mates turned out to be nice people, she could look forward to every day. As she was approaching a public trashcan in front of someone's house, she accidentally bumped into a familiar face: Lara Ubersax. Lara was especially surprised at seeing Nicole again. Her face brightened up a bit when she said, \"Hey!\" \"Hey,\" Nicki said with a bounce in her step. \"You're Lara, right?\" \"Uh oh, you're starting to remember me more now,\" Lara chanted in a sing-song voice. \"Ha ha,\" Nicki joked, closing her eyes gently in a teasing sort of laugh. \"Whatchu doin' in this part of the neighborhood? You live here?\" \"Actually, I live about two blocks from here,\" Lara replied, pointing behind Nicki to give her an idea of where she lived. \"I had to get away from my brother and his crap friends. One of 'em likes me or something. I don't friggin know anymore.\" Nicki hummed in understanding and then probed, \"But you ain't hearin' it, huh?\" \"Hell no,\" Lara responded, rolling her eyes and dismissing the notion like a bad habit. \"So what are you doing in these parts?\" \"Walkin' home mad like I don't have cheap shoes that could snap at the toe if I step the wrong way,\" Nicki responded, unfazed by the question. Lara chuckled a bit, happy that Nicki wasn't so judgmental, and nodded in response. Nicki then continued after she chuckled at her own response and nodded to the Smoothie Guy to say, \"That was before I met the Latino back there.\" \"Oh...\" Lara dragged, smiling. She was kind of happy to be able to talk about crushes with Nicki even though they barely knew each other. The Smoothie Guy was really, really gorgeous though! Which meant Nicki had extremely good tastes in men, but Lara could see clearly why anyone would be attracted to the Smoothie Guy. She even justified Nicki's opinion by saying, \"He is pretty hot. Which makes me wonder why I've never seen him before.\" Nicki turns to Lara for a second then back to the Smoothie Guy as he makes a smoothie for a customer and says, \"Girl, I know you lyin'. You ain' never seent him?\" \"Not once,\" Lara responded before hearing someone call her in the distance. She turned to see Allen and Vacious coming towards her and said quickly, \"Mind if I walk with you? I was going back to get over myself and just be harassed, but I really don't want to. I will walk to Vegas at this point.\" Nicki looked to where Lara had just turned and immediately saw the problem. She was in no mood to deal with Vacious right then, especially after she had been ogling at the Smoothie Guy and trying to figure out when she could try to find him tomorrow to buy his ice cream, but she wasn't sure whether she could just trust Lara around her family either. While her parents could fight, she didn't want them to be involved in any mess right now. As she evaluated her options, she decided to just let Lara hang around her for a little while. Her mom texted her on the bus saying she bought new plants for her to mess with, so she would see if Lara was even remotely interested in some daisies. Nicki tugged on Lara's arm, signaling to walk faster, and took off her shoes before asking, \"Do they have a lot of glass or sharp stuff on the ground on this street?\" \"Nope,\" Lara replied, preparing to run. \"Word,\" Nicki said before taking off with Lara close behind her. They ran down all three blocks to her house to avoid Vacious and Allen without stopping and pretty much laughed the whole way there. Nicki felt much better about her day, knowing that somewhere someone didn't like Vacious much either. He was cute but a complete dick. When the girls made it to Nicki's house, they panted their troubles away and giggled a bit. Nicki saw the flowers her mother bought in the front and was giddy to see her new gardening gloves and hat and shoes. Her grandmother even left her some cookies and juice on the front patio. Lara looked up from the boring view of her knees and was impressed by the sizable house Nicki was living in. Her parents were working late nights, so she had to make her own snacks. It must've been nice having someone there to do that for you. When a cookie interrupted her thoughts, she looked up to see Nicki opening the front door and silently inviting Lara inside. Lara was really surprised by Nicki at this point and then asked, \"You don't mind me coming in? I mean... we just met.\" \"We have classes together, see each other at lunch, and we don't want to be around the same guy. Plus, we practically live around each other,\" Nicki replied. \"Do you do drugs?\" \"No,\" Lara said, shaking her head. \"Any STDs?\" \"No.\" \"Convicted any felonies?\" \"No.\" \"Then get in here before I change my mind.\" Eda and Farah were checking in to a study room at the public library to charge phones and laptops while taking out their notebooks for each class. It was a good thing there was a soundproof sitting area in it. That way they could talk at a normal level without disturbing anyone. Once Eda plugged in her iPhone to charge in the wall outlet and Farah plugged in her pink Lenovo laptop in the same outlet, the girls began reading through their notes for the day to keep up with their classes and maintain their 2.0 average to stay on the squad. Since a plan is already in motion to get through regionals, they couldn't afford to make anything lower than a C on anything if they wanted to control Unique and see Nicki again. Tonight was their first Skype chat, too? No way will there be any screw-ups unless Nicki still doesn't have her internet ready. Speaking of which, Farah unlocked her cellphone and sent Nicki a text message to check to see if they could talk to her on Skype. Nicki, u there? FARAH! :-D I miss ya'll so much! Yes, I'm here. Wassup? :'-( We miss u 2. U got the internet hooked up yet? No, mama said we gotta wait 'til Friday. We have to change addresses and all that other bullshit before we can really settle down. I wanna cry... :'-( Nooo, don't cry! If you cry I'm gon cry! :'-( I know. How was ya'll 1st day back as JUNIORS!? :-D Girl... Unique made captain unopposed, you hear me? We tried to tell her to use your idea for the supply bags and she flipped the - yeah! She flipped out. It wasn't like she was screamin' at us or nothin', but she was not happy AT ALL. Girl, I know you lyin'. She really did that to you? Yasss, girl, yasss! =( I was too drove with her. Me and Eda was done the whole day. Lemme move on 4 I pull a muscle in my face or somethin'. :-D How ur new school? Any cute boys? My day was HORRIFIC, girl! You hear me! Ohh girl! =( It was bad. But I did find me a hottie after school. \"Gir - Eda, come see this!\" Farah said with excitement. \"Nicki found her a new man!\" \"Girl, what?\" Eda questioned, running over to the phone to see the text message. \"Ooo! Ask if she got a picture of him.\" You got a picture of him? How hot was he? No, I didn't get a picture of him, but I might catch him tomorrow. I'll get one then. Girl... he was GORGEOUS! He was a 14 on a scale of 1 to 10! I was walkin' home, right? Not payin' attention to nothin' and he called me out. Girl, I turnt around and saw this beautiful Latino lookin' dead at me with dem perfect brown-green eyes, thick lips and WHOO! This girl I met at school, Lara, was walkin' 'round my neighborhood too. And she said she ain't never seent him 'til today. Coincidence? Who Lara? Got a picture of her? Five minutes after Farah sent the last text, Nicki sent her a picture of Lara. She and Eda took a look at her and found her punk style kind of cool. For a white girl, she was very pretty too, but they believed all women were beautiful. The girl had a nice smile and her makeup was on point. Oh, she cute! Ask her if she post makeup tutorials on YouTube. Her eyeshadow look killah. We could use dem colorz for the Suns' pep rally. She said she can post one tonight. She don't have work 'til Saturday. I just told her 'bout dem colorz for the squad. Ya'll would look cute with the way she have it, but everybody eyes is different. You would have to change up the styles. You ain't lyin'. Remember when Jody wore that green and orange to the parade? Girl, what was she thinkin'? Then she put some kind of purple or gray in it, too. That's my friend, though. She was just happy she made that B in Algebra II so she could march with us. I'd be usin' all the colors of the rainbow, too. I ain't gon lie to ya. ;-D Oh, Lara said she used to be a cheerleader, too. I'm meetin' all kinds of people out chere today. They got some cool people on my bus I'mma be rollin' with 'til senior year look like. One of the girls was a cheerleader, too. You must've been cuttin' up on the inside. All dem cheerleaders and you so far from the squad. I'd of lost my mind. I did. ;-( I was so hurt after I left. I couldn't even hang my pictures up without cryin'. Eda said she cried after ur plane took off. I did, too. ;-( But on the bright side, it look like it won't be so bad. U met some cute boys, they got cheerleaders out there u might could just practice with, and we can always talk if u feelin' down. Thank ya'll. I did see this other boy in my class who was cute, though. He wore black like Lara. I think he a musician. If he wasn't a dick, I'd probably would've tried to get his number first. But that Latino, though. He sell smoothies, ice cream, and some other stuff. I wanna get his number so bad. Ain't that sad? The hell it ain't, girl! Take that picture of his fine self and send it to me. We gon see what you workin' with. We might fool around and go to Jared's to put a ring on him right fast! :-D Shiii... He a dime plus change, too? I'mma break up with Daryl for you, boo. Eda said Unique been tryin' to get wit him since you been gone. Now that is just too nasty and sad. She couldn't even wait 'til we broke up or nothin'? Eda said u gon be alright. Soon as we see this Latino lover tomorrow, we gon see who get the last laugh. She don't know. You might be hookin' up with the next Cake Boss or somethin'. Matter fact, he ain' even gotta be a Cake Boss. He could just be five-star master chef. Any man that could cook... GIRL! That is our dream man. You know we be greedy! :-D I wan' see what he look like now! Tomorrow ain't comin' fast enough! Girl, stop playin'! I gotta go find my BEST makeup for him TONIGHT. And get my hair together? Ya'll jus' don' know. I'mma work for dis number! ;-D I'm so pathetic right now. I didn't even break up with Daryl yet, and I'm steady tryin' to get somebody else number. :'-( I'm surprised ya'll made it this far. Cuz all he really care about is sex. We heard him talkin' to his boys about chu. I was gon break up with him before we went to camp, but we was rushin' to pack up and catch that plane and it's been hustle hustle hustle since. I didn't even have time to tell him when we got back because we was movin' the next day. Still can't cuz now I gotta catch up on assignments for these next 2 weeks. I'm behind like 4 lessons in 1 class by itself! The rest is either 2 or 3 lessons. Right as Eda was about to text Nicki to be a part of the conversation, she caught sight of Daryl walking up to the back of the library near the windows overlooking the after school traffic in the streets. That was a problem. Daryl never went to the library even when Nicki was studying there. The only time he came inside of the library was when Nicki begged him to help her carry some books and her laptop out to Farah's mom's car. No way he misses Nicki that much. Wouldn't you know Eda was right. Daryl was here for something else: to meet with Unique who was dressed in short shorts and a tight spandex shirt to make her boobs look as full as they could possibly be. Now, Unique had a body for a sixteen-year-old and was pretty freaking fabulous, but she was next in line to never coming to a public library. The only reason she ever came to one was because Jody was getting math tutoring from either Nicki or her crush, Tim, and even then Unique just read magazines the entire time and copied Nicki's homework whenever Nicki was too distracted with questions. Eda tapped Farah on her shoulder, getting the girl's attention, and pointed to Jody sitting at a table with Daryl. Don't worry 'bout breakin' up with Daryl. Ya'll over. With that, Farah and Eda looked at the new couple with an attitude that defied all conventional reasoning. Oscar was early for the first day of school; he always was. Since his father was a computer technician and his mother was a teacher at his little brother's elementary school, the entire family left early in the morning. Oscar wanted to be like other kids. They got to come to school way later, but the advantage for him being early was he always got first dibs on the school's breakfast program at a discounted price. That and there was hardly ever a line. Besides him, his first friend and fellow freak, Ignacious, joined him for breakfast, too. As Oscar walked into his only sanctuary at the school, he waved to Beatrice who smiled kindly at him and walked towards the serving area. Beatrice liked Oscar the most out of all the kids in NG High; he was her only favorite student. Since she thought of him as special, she decided to introduce him to Nicki today just to cheer him up. She cheered everyone else up. \"My favorite boy,\" Beatrice started. \"Hello, Oscar. How's your brother? Am I seein' him in a few years or does he have a little longer to go?\" \"Uh, he's - \" Oscar said, laughing nervously. His brother was only ten. He said, \"got a few years to go. Well, you know, unless he skips a few grades.\" \"He's a smart boy just like his brother. He'll be ready for the world if you keep him in the right direction. I'll be waitin' for 'im 'til then,\" the woman said, turning to the register. \"Bess, where's new girl? Let her get my boy this mornin'.\" \"Alright,\" Bess said. She was the big-hipped woman. She turned her head and called, \"Nicole!\" \"Still cleanin' the trash cans!\" Nicki responded. \"Stop and wash ya hands. You got your first customer!\" \"Okay!\" Nicki said, not wasting time at all. She ran to the sink, washed her hands and dried them, and ran to the front. Oscar was flabbergasted. The \"new girl\" was...hot. She had a big, pleasant smile, cute face, and was tiny compared to him even though she was clearly about 5'6\" or 5'7\". Tall girls were okay since he liked long legs, but he was practically dumbfounded in front of the girl called Nicole. For whatever reason, though, he couldn't help feel like he had seen her recently. He recognized her face, but he couldn't put his finger on where he might have seen her face. She was adorable! He suddenly found himself unable to speak and turned to a smirking Beatrice and smiling Bess who was cooing about how cute it was for him to lose his tongue all of a sudden. \"Hi, how are you today?\" Nicki asked, smiling brightly and bouncing a little. \"What can I get ya?\" \"Bess, whaddaya think about the greeting?\" Beatrice questioned. Bess hummed then said, \"Too much bouncing, but definitely an 8 out of 10.\" \"Oscar's usual are the cheesecake pancakes with a blueberry parfait. He likes,\" Beatrice paused and gestured something grand and with a theatrical voice said, \"dramatic dishes with a French flair.\" \"Ah, he's a romantic,\" Nicole commented, making a teasing sort of pout. Oscar felt his face about to explode, which wouldn't be good because there'd be zit juice flying everywhere, but he decided not to go down the road of imagining that. Instead, he just kept smiling like a dork and decided to say, \"I like Rome.\" Nicki laughed at him, but it wasn't a \"dude, you're weird\" laugh. It was more of a \"you're so cute\" laugh, the kind of laughter that he missed hearing from a girl. As Nicki turned to get Oscar's food ready, one of his friend's within the outcast community decided to make his presence known. It was Ignacious, the plump-faced jester of krunk. He was wearing a lot of red today. \"Hello, Nivaldo Gill! Give it up for the lunch ladies! Whoo!\" \"It's too damn early in the mornin' fo' this foolishness. Hush up!\" one of the male cafeteria workers shouted. \"Sorry, Nivaldo Gill!\" Ignacious shouted, swirling his hips around. He stopped and said, \"I'm done now. Hey, Oscar, whatcha gettin' this time?\" \"Meh, pancakes and a parfait,\" Oscar said doing jazz hands. He leaned in to his friend's ear and whispered, \"There's a hot girl here.\" Ignacious immediately shoved Oscar aside and said, \"You don't say. Where is this so-called hot girl?\" \"Dark and lovely is serving your buddy his breakfast right now,\" Bess replied, rolling her eyes at Ignacious. \"Ta da!\" Nicki cheered, handing Oscar his tray. \"Oh, hey! You're Nicki, right?\" Ignacious questioned, surprising Oscar and Beatrice. \"I think I saw you on the bus this morning. Were you in the back?\" \"You know her?\" Oscar shouted more than questioned. \"Dude, we met her yesterday,\" Ignacious reminded Oscar. ","Summary":" The sun was blazing as it shone bright and warm in the August morning. Different squads were practi"},{"Movie":"Bring it On","Title":"Finding a New You","Author":"DreamerGuurrl","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6198570","Passage":"[Chapter 1] \"Dad….why do I have to go to this school?\" Claire Edwards complained as she and her dad who was also the principal walked up the steps on the first day of school of sophomore year. \"Because I said so\" Mr. Edwards replied. He rolled his eyes at his daughter who had become very snobby in the last two years. He and his wife both decided it would be best to take Claire out of Greenland High and transfer her to Apollo High. Claire and her dad walked in the school as Claire scrunched up her nose in disgust. \"Now stop it missy! If you can show me that you will stop this little attitude of yours I will transfer you back to Greenland next semester.\" Mr. Edwards said annoyed of his daughter's attitude. Claire's face lighted up \"I promise I'll be on my best behavior dad.\" Claire promised. \"Good oh by the way I'm not your dad anymore I'm your principal now\" Mr. Edwards corrected her smiling. \"Whatever you say principal\" Claire said as she walked away to class. Claire crossed her arms against her chest thinking that maybe Apollo wouldn't be so bad after all. \" Who are you kidding Claire? Apollo High is the worst school in the county last year a girl got raped and a guy got killed.\" She thought to herself. Greenland High was rated one of the best schools in the county. So what was she the assistant captain of the Varsity Cheerleading Squad doing here at Apollo? As the day continued Claire kept on realizing how much Greenland High was better than Apollo High. First, Greenland High was kept clean and the flowers were always bright and welcoming. At Apollo the flowers were dead, trash flying everywhere, and the girls' bathroom reeked of feet and fish. At Greenland the girls' bathroom always smelled of lavender with mints at the exit. Lunch time came and Claire looked at what they had to eat. They had chili, peas, celery, and for the main entrée they had a sloppy Joe. \"Ugh you have to be kidding me\" She thought. She was used to the sushi, ceaser salad, and the smoothie and coffee stand that Greenland had to offer. Claire found a seat in the corner by herself. She slipped on her earphones as she tried to eat her food. She picked at her sloppy Joe and played with her peas. That's when a boy accidentally bumped into her table. \"Sorry\" he apologized. Claire looked up as she saw a guy in dark jeans and a black shirt with black hair. He had a light skin tone and gorgeous blue eyes. \"Ok\" Claire said. Instead of leaving the boy sat down on one of the chairs. \"So what's your name?\" he asked. \"Claire.\" She responded clearly annoyed. Who did this guy think he is sitting down with and talking to her but she had to admit she did kind of like it. \"What to cool to say your last name or something?\" he joked. Claire dropped her fork, \"fine Edwards. Happy? Claire Edwards.\" She said. He smiled. \"Name's Elli. Elli Williams\" he stated shaking her hand. \"Great…\" Claire said rolling her eyes and pulling her hand away. \"So what school did you come from?\" He asked. \"Greenland High\" She stated. \"Whoa if you were already at that rich, snobby school why did you come here to the ghetto Apollo High?\" he asked curiously. He didn't know anyone who would leave Greenland. \"Because my parents hoped I would lose this attitude I've been having. But I'm only here for the semester then I go back to more edible lunches\" She said looking at her food in disgust. He laughed. \"Hey you look kind of familiar I wonder where from?\" he said. \"I don't know\" she said. He looked at her for a moment before clapping his hands together. \"I got it you're that cheerleader from Greenland that everyone said is the bitchiest cheerleader. I heard you made a girl cry at practice is that true?\" he asked wanting to know. \"It's not my damn fault that I made her go run because she kept talking about her breakup with her boyfriend. God she was being such a cry baby. I need my girls focused not damn crying over a freaking boy.\" She said. He laughed as he looked over at Claire giving her look that gave her butterflies in her stomach. Bring! \"What's your next class?\" Elli asked getting up as Claire threw away her food. \"English with Mr. Zabera what about you?\" She asked. \"Same\" he responded. \"Cool.\" She said. \"I think we have the same classes.\" He said. \"Really? I haven't noticed.\" She answered. \"Yeah I didn't think you would notice me.\" He said. \"Sorry.\" She mumbled. Claire and Elli entered English, Claire choosing to sit in the very back and Elli in front of her. The bell rang and Mr. Zabera started class right away. 10 minutes before the class was going to end he gave them time to read. \"Psst Claire.\" Elli said. \"What?\" she said smiling. \"Want to be partners in P.E. I think we are doing the pickle ball unit today?\" The bell rang as everyone exited the room. Claire got up picking up her books. Elli turned to face her waiting for her answer. \"Sorry I have tryouts for cheerleading during P.E today\" She said. \"It's ok good luck\" he said as he started leaving the room. \"Thanks I'm going to need it.\" She said. He turned around smiling, \"No you won't\" he said as he left. Claire smiled biting her bottom lip as she hurried to get dressed out and she ran to the field. 60 other wannabe cheerleaders showed up some were decent while others words can't even describe how terrible they were. Claire felt like her tryouts were a success. She anxiously waited after school so they could put up the list. \"Number 14\" She repeated to myself. \"Hey what are you waiting for?\" Elli asked coming up behind her. \"To see if I made the team or not.\" She said. \"Ohh... You want to grab a smoothie afterwards?\" \"There's a smoothie truck around here?\" She asked desperately. \"No. There's a smoothie shop up the street. Damn you must really miss Greenland.\" He said. She nodded thinking of all her friends and her so called boyfriend. He said they had nothing to worry about but he hasn't talked to her since June. She sighed she wanted to cry she missed Greenland so much. At that moment a woman stepped outside with the list in her hands. \"Girls if your number is up on the list please come inside to receive your uniform and state what team you made.\" She said taping up the list on the window. Claire looked down the JV list and her number wasn't there. She grew worried as she looked over to the Varsity list. \"2, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 21, 25, 33, 45, 52, and 58.\" Claire and the rest of the girls that made it entered. Claire approached the lady. \"Claire Edwards and I made the Varsity.\" She stated. She nodded handing her a uniform. She smiled wide as she walked outside hiding it behind her back. \"Well…\" Elli said waiting for an answer. \"I made it!\" Claire smiled. \"I knew you would I mean that wouldn't make sense if you didn't make it considering trying to make the Varsity team at Greenland High is really hard since they chose less girls.\" He stated. \"True\" Claire said as they started walking to the smoothie shop. They approached the little smoothie shop and they ordered. Elli ordered banana berry and Claire ordering strawberry watermelon. They sat down in one of the chairs they had there. They were having a nice time when some Greenland High students came in. Claire gasped instantly recognizing them as she tried to hide her face. \"Hey Elli can I borrow your hat for a minute\" Claire asked grabbing her sunglasses from her bag and throwing them on her face. \"Uh Sure. Why?\" he asked grabbing his hat and handing it to Claire who quickly putting it on hoping not to be recognized. She sank low in her seat as she watched the students grab their drinks leaving as they laughed at how bad the drinks were and cracked some jokes about Apollo High. One year ago that was Claire making fun of Apollo High.[Chapter 2] Finding A New You Chapter Two Weeks went by even though Claire was miserable at Apollo High she was glad she had Elli as a friend. It made life at Apollo much easier. He was the only reason she wanted to go to school. She loved how easy and fun it was to flirt with him and he loved to mess with her mind. She didn't want to admit it but first, she was slowly beginning to like Apollo much more and she wasn't disgusted by it much anymore. And second, she was falling for Elli Williams and hard. \"So are we sitting together at lunch or will I be eating alone?\" he asked as he waited by her locker before lunch. \"Sorry the cheerleaders are having a meeting about the game at lunch and they are making me sit with them today. Are you coming to the game after school?\" she asked hopeful. \"Hmm Football games not really my thing.\" He said. \"Oh come on! Pretty please I'll take you to get food afterwards.\" She begged. \"Fine but I'm choosing today.\" She laughed. \"I got to go catch you later!\" she said running off to the lunchroom. The Varsity Cheerleaders team had the best table in the whole school. Their table was in right in the middle of everybody so everyone could see them. Claire approaches the table taking a seat. \"Finally little Miss Edwards joining us instead of sitting with that emo boy\" the captain says. Claire rolls her eyes as the captain starts talking about gossiping about some girl who Claire thought was a slut. \" Seriously? No wonder Apollo doesn't win any cheer competitions they don't take this seriously all they care about is popularity and parties. Which isn't too bad but competitions are fun and winning is even better\" She thought. Claire spotted Elli walking in the cafeteria as he sat down at their table taking out an apple from his backpack. She didn't like that everyone thought he was emo. He wasn't he just liked dark clothes and listened to heavy metal music. He was the only one who could annoy her and she would still love it. Every time he talked to her or even said her name she would get butterflies in her stomach. She sighed thinking a guy like him would never like a girl like her. She was so glad no one knew she was the principal's daughter because she hates when people try to kiss up to her. She didn't want to tell Elli because she was scared he would be everyone else but then again Elli isn't like everybody else… Elli sat in at the table where usually Claire and he will sit but today she was sitting with the rest of the cheerleaders. That kind of made him disappointed he really loves to mess with her. He really liked her. She was his dream girl. She was smart, brave, talented, and beautiful. He glanced at her laughing at whatever jokes the cheerleaders were saying. God he loved her smile. \"What am I doing? I'm Elli Williams who everyone thinks is an emo freak and I can't like a girl like Claire Edwards. She's a cheerleader and popular. Totally out of my league. And I can't be falling for her I'm Elli I don't fall for anyone but Claire is different she's special. Ugh I really need to get out of here.\" He thought as he grabbed his stuff and leaving the lunchroom.[Chapter 3] Hey guys! I'm so sorry that I haven't been updating. I started high school like 3 weeks ago ( Yup I'm a freshie!) and my biology teacher has loaded me with homework I'll try to upload and write as often as I can. I'm sorry that last chapter was really short. I just wanted to upload what I had written. No worries this time it's longer. I really hope to have another chapter uploaded today if not then hopefully this weekend. Please review and favorite this story! P.S. I'm thinking of writing a new story. Any ideas? Finding A New You Chapter Three Elli went outside sitting down at table by a tree. He tried to think of something besides Claire but he couldn't all that came to his mind was her. \"All I have is English and P.E. next I can afford to ditch today\" he muttered to himself. He really didn't want to miss English considering Claire was in that class but he needed to get away and just breathe. Claire was making him go crazy. He grabbed his backpack as he left the school. Claire noticed Elli was gone and wasn't at the table anymore. Maybe he went to the bathroom or something Claire thought. Claire became worried and disappointed when he didn't show up to English. She was sad he wasn't there she loved when they talked. Finally the school day was over and Claire headed to the football field with the rest of the Varsity cheerleaders. Claire put on her best smile as she glanced over to the stands in hopes of seeing Elli. \"Where is he? He promised he would come\" She thought. Just as the game was about to start there he was just arriving. She shook her head of course he would come at last minute just to get her worried and to mess with her. \"F-I-G-H-T! FIGHT FOR VICTORY!\" Claire chanted with the rest of the cheerleaders. Elli gave her a smile and Claire grinned huge. \"You like him.\" Manny one of the cheerleaders said. Claire blushed, \"No I don't.\" Manny gave her a look \"Well if you don't like him he likes you. I can see it by the way you two look at each other.\" She said. Claire looked back to Elli smiling. \"Annddd touchdown! Apollo High wins!\" the announcer shouted through out the stadium. The band played the victory song as the cheerleaders did flips and cartwheels. \"Woo!\" Claire yelled as she threw her pom poms in the air. As the football players were leaving to the locker rooms one named Johnny stopped at Claire. He took off his helmet turning his head to get his hair out of his face. \"Hi\" he said. Claire smiled as he ran off the field. Sure Johnny was cute but Claire liked Elli. She looked up to him one last time. \"Let's go Claire. Are you coming?\" Manny asked her. \"Yea sure let's go\" she said running to catch up to her. Elli watched as Claire ran off with the other cheerleaders. The whole game he had been watching her and he had become a little jealous when that stupid football player talked to her. He didn't know what he said to Claire but she smiled at him. He sighed as he got up and walked towards the entrance of the school. If Claire wanted to be with that guy then he would have to let her. That guy looked like exactly what Claire should be with. He was attractive, popular and a football player. It would make more sense for Claire to date him then to be with him. He waited a good 20 minutes before he saw he come out. \"Hey\" he said. She looked up at him \"hey so what do you say we got eat? I'm starving\" she laughs as she takes his hand. He looks down at their hands smiling. \"Uh sorry.\" She mumbled embarrassed pulling her hand away. \"It's ok\" he said. He stared at her admiring her beauty. Her nose was slightly crooked but it was cute. Her lips were perfect. He imagined how it would it feel to actually kiss her. He imagined her lips would be soft and tender. They had been talking and laughing while eating when Claire decided it was time to tell him. They had known each other for a month it was only fair. \"So I need to tell you something\" she said. \"Shoot\" he said taking a sip of his water. She bit her lip nervously. \"My dad is the principal of the school.\" He choked on his water coughing. Did he hear correctly that the girl he likes her father is the principal? The same principal who is never pleased to see him in his office. \"Your dad. Principal?\" he asked. She nodded. \"Yup.\" \"Then how come you went to Greenland last year. Wouldn't been easier to have you come to Apollo last year.\" He said. \"Well my parents are divorced. So my mom lives over by Greenland and all my friends go there. So last year I lived with my mom but this year they both decided for me to live with my dad and so I had to come to Apollo for some reasons\" She stated. \"And the reasons are?\" he said wanting her to continue. \"Long story.\" She said. He sat there crossing his arms. \"I've got time.\" She smiled. \"Ok well my dad walked in on my boyfriend and me making out in my room with my boyfriend's shirt off. And then I got detention for refusing to dress out for P.E. because they messed up my schedule because I was supposed to have cheerleading but it was fixed. Then I snuck out like a million times. Next I missed curfew by a couple of hours. Oh and my dad had to go on a search to find me because I snuck out to go to a party and he dragged me home. Then I got into a fight with a girl at a football game.\" She said. \"Damn\" he said. \"So that's how I ended up here at Apollo\" she said. \"Well I think your dad and I have already grown to know each other really well.\" He joked. \"Oh really how\" she asked. \"I visit him pretty much every week. He loves our conversations\" he said wiggling his eyebrows. She laughed. \"Listen I have to ask you something?\" she asks. \"What?\" he asks. \"Was this a date or something\" she asks as she bit her lip. \"Uhh I don't know I mean I like you a lot. I hope this but it's okay if you don't think so um but\" he rambled on. She giggled. \"I like you too\" she says bumping her knee with his. He grinned. \"So does this mean we're like together?\" She smiled. \"If you want to be\" \"Then Claire Edwards seems you have yourself a boyfriend\" \"And Mr. Williams you have a girlfriend\" she giggled. She couldn't wait for school tomorrow and she could tell everyone that Elli Williams is hers and she's his.[Chapter 4] Hey! See I try to keep my promises! Here's another chapter! I was very happy with the last chapter! I plan uploading Chapter Five tonight! So be on the lookout! Tell me what you think of this chapter! Finding A New You Chapter Four \"Hey boyfriend\" Claire happily cheered as she walked to Elli the next morning. \"Hey girlfriend ready to go to class?\" he asked closing his locker. She nodded grinning as she took his hand as they walked down the hallway. \"So I was thinking maybe at lunch I should introduce to my dad.\" She said. He looked over to her giving her a look. \"I already know your dad though\" \"Yeah but he doesn't know you as my boyfriend. Pretty please?\" she asked giving her best puppy dog face. \"Really a puppy dog face? Ugh fine only because your puppy dog face is funny and kind of cute.\" He said laughing. She hit him playfully. \"Gees I said cute!\" he laughed. \"I'm beautiful not kind of cute\" she said sticking her tongue out. He squeezed her hand gently. \"Of course you are.\" Claire blushed as they arrived to Claire's first class. \"Well here we are\" Elli said. \"See you at lunch?\" she asked. He nodded. \"See you later then\" she said giving him a hug. She walked into her class glancing back seeing Elli. She smiled gesturing for him to go and not be late to class. He smiled as he walked away. He felt a little disappointed he had to wait until lunch to see her. When she made the cheerleading team her schedule changed a bit. He was happy they still had English together even if it was the only class they had together. She was all her could think about when he went to class. For some reason he thought about what she said when they first met. \" But I'm only here for the semester…\" The semester ended in 2 months. Did that mean she was still planning on leaving? When they first met Claire seemed mad but now she was happy all the time. So was she going to leave him? Elli shook the thought out of his head. All that he knew was he better cherish whatever time he had with her. At lunch Claire and Elli walked together to her dad's office. She softly knocked on the door. \"Who is it?\" he called out. \"It's me dad.\" She responded. \"Come in!\" he said. Mr. Edwards's expression softened when he saw his daughter walk in but it quickly frowned when he saw Elli behind her. \"What brings you two down to my office?\" he said glaring at Elli. \"Dad, I think you already know him but this is Elli my boyfriend\" she said smiling. He nodded his head \"I see and when did you Mr. Williams ask my daughter for a relationship?\" \"Uh just yesterday sir after the uh football game\" he said nervously. Normally the father of the girl he was dating didn't scare him but this was his principal. Mr. Edwards nodded turning to his daughter. \"Does your mother know?\" he asked. \"No I haven't had a chance to tell her yet. I was going to tell her this weekend\" she said. \"What's this weekend?\" he asked. \"Don't you remember? I'm staying with mom. She hasn't seen me in 2 and half weeks. I told you a couple days ago at dinner\" \"Oh yes.\" He said. He turned his attention back to Elli. \"Look I'm saying this as Claire's father break her heart and I will find you. I have your address and number in the school file\" he said. Elli gulped nodding. \"Yes sir. I don't plan on hurting her.\" Claire smiled. Finally she was in a relationship where she felt safe in. \"Well I let you get back to work Dad!\" she said taking Elli's hand rushing out of his office. \"See it wasn't that bad\" she said. He scoffed \"It wasn't that bad? Your dad just scared the crap out of me!\" he said. She giggled. \"Hey compared to my ex-boyfriend you got off easy.\" \"That was easy? I don't want to see hard\" he said. \"Trust me you don't\" she said. \"So I'm guessing I won't be seeing this weekend?\" he frowned \"Nope my mom is picking me up after school tomorrow but she's dropping me off Sunday evening so if you want you can come to my dad's house at like 7\" she said. \"Ok but I'll probably be late since I'm helping out my aunt at her house on Sunday afternoon.\" \"As long as you show up I'll be happy\" she said. The bell rang to go to class. \"Off to English my lady\" he said putting his arm out. \"Of course sir\" she giggled as she wrapped her arm around his.[Chapter 5] Hey for some reason fanfiction wasn't letting me upload all of chapter four so I split in into two parts! Finding A New You Chapter Four:Part Two Saturday Afternoon \"Hey sweetheart are you hungry?\" Claire's mom asked her. It was almost 1:00 in the afternoon and Claire was barely getting up the reason was she spent the whole night chatting with Elli online. Claire told her mom about her and Elli yesterday when her mom had come to pick her up and saw Claire standing outside with Elli and asked who he was. \"A little bit\" she said. She sat down as she ate breakfast with her mom. It reminded of her when last year she lived with her mom. She really did miss her mom. She couldn't text her dad when he was at the store to buy tampons. That would just be gross and weird for both of them. Also she was sure if she asked him he would say no way. Also with her mom she told her how to drive a boy crazy and how not to sound desperate. She loved when her mom told her about her past relationships and told Claire her mistakes. \"I'm going with Christy to the store want to come?' her mom asked. \"I don't think I have that much energy to go with you and Christy shopping today\" she laughed. Christy was her mom's best friend from high school and when those two shopped they shopped like crazy looking for the best deals. Claire thought that the saying shop until you drop came from when her mom and Christy shopped. Last year Claire brought one of her friends to go and when they got home they were so tired they fell asleep on the ground by the front door. \"Alright then I'll be back later then. Don't throw a party while I'm gone\" she winked. \"That was one time in eighth grade!\" she shouted as her mom headed to the door. \"And my I still can't find one of my right shoes\" she laughed. \"Bye mom!\" Claire said as her mom left. Claire sighed as she went upstairs to take a shower. She got dressed and blow dried her hair. She really didn't feel like staying home when it was so pretty and warm outside. She took a walk around the neighborhood when she saw Greenland High School. The school looked clean and well kept. She did sort of miss it but she liked it at Apollo. She sighed it was November the semester ended in two months and it looked like her Dad was pleased with her behavior. She knew her Dad told her when the semester ended he would transfer her back to Greenland but she started having second thoughts. She didn't want to leave Elli and none of her old friends had talked to her since she left. Suddenly she heard footsteps behind her. Claire turned around quickly to see a familiar face. \"Claire is that you?\" the familiar person said. \"Ben\" she breathed out.[Chapter 6] Ok earlier when I said I 'll upload Chapter Five tonight I will! Chapter Four had to be split up into two parts so don't think Part Two of Chapter Four is all uploading today because I'm not! Who knows maybe even I'll add two more chapters tonight and a new story! P.S. this doesn't count as a chapter! I hope I'm not confusing you if I am I ignore what I just said![Chapter 7] OMG it's been so long since I uploaded for this story. Sorry :/ Chapter Five \"Um what are you doing here?\" he asked nervously scratching his head. \"Nothing just visiting my mom for the weekend and you?\" she asked. This conversation was really awkward since they are pretty much exes and haven't seen or talked to each other in almost 4 months. \"You know the usual just going to see my boys\" he smirked. \"Oh that's cool\" she said. \"Yeah so how's Apollo? Is it all ghetto like they say?\" he asked \"A little bit it's really fun once you get to know it. I'm on the cheer team and have a lot of good friends and I have a\" she stopped not sure if she should tell him she moved on. \"You have a what? Listen I have to be honest here. I moved on to another girl. Maddie.\" He said waiting for her reaction. \"Maddie! As in my best friend Maddie?\" she yelled furious. Last year she sorted of flirted with him but Claire ignored it because she thought Maddie would never do that to her. \"I'm sorry but during the summer we got close and then we hooked up and\" \"During the summer? What happened to nothing will come between us I guess I shouldn't be surprised you hooked up with her. You were always checking out other sluts when we were together!\" she shouted. \"Sorry if I changed! You left me to go to Apollo and you thought I was going to wait for you? You're sadly mistaken. If it wasn't for me last year asking you out you would've been pathetic because I was the only one who asked you out. No other guy would look at you.\" He spat in her face. She cringed at his harsh words. \"Oh really is that what you think? That I can't get another guy? Well you're wrong since when I went to Apollo bunch of guys were checking me out and as a matter of fact I moved on too! My boyfriend is so much better than you! You can never compare to him!\" she said as she pushed past him. She turned around to say \"By the way you're wrong there was a lot of guys who asked me out last year so don't think you were the only one. You were just the only one to go all the way with me. There was others.\" She said smirking leaving him with his mouth wide open. Later that day she video chatted with Elli. \"So what did you do today?\" he asked. \"Horrible I ran into my ex-boyfriend today. Man he's such a fucking asswhole I swear\" she complained. \"What happened?\" he asked worriedly. This was his girlfriend running into her ex and coming home all upset. She told him the story and he frowned. \"I'll drive over there and kick his ass if you want me too.\" She laughed. \"It's ok. I miss you though.\" She said pushing her hair back. \"I miss you too.\" He said softly. \"I'm really upset about what he said. His words kind of hurt\" she said quietly picking at a flower she had grabbed that day. He frowned he didn't like that she upset. \"I'm coming over there. I'll be there soon.\" He said. She shook her head, \"No stay. I'll be back tomorrow.\" Elli tried to open his mouth to protest but he was interrupted by Claire. \"I'm tired. I'll see you tomorrow?\" she said. \"Yeah see you tomorrow.\" He said. She smiled as she logged off of chat. Wednesday at Lunch… Claire hurried to the cheerleader's table. She had gotten a text today during 3rd period to meet there at lunch. She sat down just as the captain started. \"So as you know homecoming is this Saturday and the homecoming game is this Friday\" she said. The girls chanted happily at the news but Claire was confused. \"So I'm pretty sure you girls all know the Apollo tradition.\" The captain said. \"I don't what is it?\" Claire asked. \"Oh instead of wearing our uniform at the game, one of the football players asks us to wear their away jersey and we have to accept. So on Friday we wear them to school and we are pretty much theirs for the day.\" Manny explained. \"Do we have to like kiss them and stuff?\" Claire asked. Manny shrugged, \"Whatever they want. You just have to make sure they are happy for the day.\" \"What if no one asks us?\" Claire said again. The cheerleaders laughed. \"No one breaks a tradition. Don't worry you are going to be asked right away, to the guys you're hot.\" \"Uh thanks\" Claire said. \"Well that's it meeting is over!\" the captain announced. Claire got up and walked away to go meet Elli. She wasn't looking forward to this little tradition. She didn't know how Elli was going to feel about this. Well I better go find out she thought.[Chapter 8] So sorry that I haven't updated in ages! Ugh being sick really sucks! Well now I can upload more chapters! Enjoy and let me know what you think! :) Chapter Six Claire found Elli at their usual table and smiled as she made her way over to him. \"Hey\" she said giving him a light kiss on the cheek. \"How was the meeting?\" he asked. She grew nervous, biting her lip \"uh it went good\" she replied. Eli gave her a look that she knew he wasn't convinced. \"What's going on?\" he asked her. She took a deep breath. \"Well this weekend is homecoming and as tradition one of the football players has to give me his away jersey because I have to wear it on Friday at school. Which means whoever gives me their jersey, I'm theirs for the day\" she said. \"You have to do this?\" Eli asked as he thought this was unbelievable. Claire nodded her head. \"Apparently the cheerleaders said it's Apollo's homecoming game tradition.\" She said. \"That's a bunch of bull\" Eli spat as he angrily got up. \"Excuse me? It's not like I want this but I have to do this!\" Claire shot back. \"No you don't, you're choosing to.\" He said mad. \"Well what do you want me to say? That I have to break tradition because my boyfriend is mad that I have to do this even though as a cheerleader it's required to keep the football players and school pumped for the game?\" \"Yes! There are some things as a cheerleader that you shouldn't have to do\" he replied. \"Look I know you're mad but when I joined this team I made commitment that I would do whatever it takes to make sure I as a cheerleader would try to get everyone pumped even if that means doing something I don't want to do!\" \"Wow you're unbelievable! Are you even listening to yourself speak and how stupid you sound about your responsibilities as a cheerleader?\" he yelled. Claire couldn't believe he just told her she was stupid. A good boyfriend would try and support so what the hell was going on? \"I can't believe you just called me stupid! You know what if this thing about me being a cheerleader is making you angry then maybe it's not worth being with you if you can't support what I love doing\" She shouted. His expression went sad. \"You know I don't want that\" he softly spoke. Claire's anger went away as she wrapped her arms around his waist. \"Me either. Now can we stop arguing because even though I can't be with you on Friday I'm still yours and I really want to go with you to homecoming on Saturday.\" She said giving a slight kiss on the cheek. He smiled. \"You're mine and I'm yours\" he said wrapping his arms around her. She smiled as she leaned her head against his chest. She loved to hear him say that she's his. It let her know that someone cared enough to make her his. \"Don't worry we'll have a blast at homecoming even though dances aren't my thing.\" He said. \"Good. And you better come and cheer me on at the football game\" she smiled. \"Wouldn't miss it for the world\" he replied. Later that day…. Claire was at her locker, getting ready to go home after school. Usually Eli gave her a ride home but today his car broke down so he had to go take it to the repair shop which meant Claire had to walk home today. Claire took her book and put it in her bag as she closed her locker only to get startled by someone leaning against the locker next to hers. It was Johnny who had said hi to her one day as he was getting off the field. He trying to hide a jersey behind his back but it wasn't working since Claire could see it clearly. \"Hey Claire\" he greeted her giving her a smile. \"Hi Johnny what's up?\" she asked even though she fully aware of what he was doing. \"Well I know someone told you about the tradition we have here at Apollo and I was wondering if you would like to wear my jersey on Friday\" he said showing her his white and blue away jersey. Claire took it her hands. \"Sure. This is wonderful\" she said. She only talked to Johnny a few times but Manny told her that he told Manny that he liked Claire. \"Thanks. I'm really happy you said yes. Also I was wondering if you would like to come to homecoming with me since we're going to the game together. It's kind of funny too because you see everyone thinks that we would be the perfect couple. Pretty much we would be like Hollywood's hottest couple here at Apollo\" he gave a small nervous laugh. \"Johnny, I'm flattered and shocked really but I have a boyfriend and I already said we would go to homecoming together but I'll still wear your jersey on Friday because it's tradition.\" His face fell. \"I don't get it. I thought I was getting these signals from you that you liked me too\" \"Sorry you must've been getting the wrong reception but I have a boyfriend. Eli Williams.\" She said. \"Oh I didn't know you guys were still together. He has a history for dumping girls in the first week that they get together.\" \"I'm sure that's a rumor and besides I really like him and he likes me that's why he's ok with this tradition because we're going to homecoming together\" \"Oh well that's a great.\" \"Yeah it was nice talking to you but I better go\" she said as she quickly walked away. \"Some day Claire Edwards we'll be together and you'll see Eli is no good for you\" he whispered as he made his way down the empty hallway.[Chapter 9] I'm speeding this story up because you guys deserve for this story to continue. I'm so sorry for the loooong wait! The next chapter will be the last chapter and there might be an epilogue. Finding a New You Now it was Friday and Claire smoothed Johnny's jersey as put it on. It was really big on her, so she had to tie a knot in the back of it. \"Claire, let's go!\" Her dad shouted from downstairs. \"I'm coming!\" She shouted as she grabbed her bag and headed downstairs where her dad handed her a breakfast sandwich. She arrived at school and after going to her locker she headed over to Eli's locker. She went around the corner to see Johnny and Eli in a conversation and neither looked happy. She decided to stay out of it and hide behind the wall. Eli was much shorter than Johnny so he had to sort of look up at him. Johnny had a couple of his friends behind him that Claire had guessed was his back up to make him seem scary. Eli though, did not look scared and stood his ground. Now was the time that Claire had wished she could know how to read lips. Johnny then walked away before he shoved into Eli's shoulder. Once Johnny was gone, Eli turned back to his locker and Claire walked over to him. \"What was that?\" she asked. Eli turned to her and smirked. \"He's not too happy to hear I'm taking you to homecoming, I told him we're dating so he shouldn't be mad. Then he went on and on about how we're different and we shouldn't be together.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Well I guess it's a good thing that I don't care what he says.\" She smiled taking his hand in hers. \"People like that annoy me. I'm tired of it and I'm not going to let it go. He messed with the wrong person.\" He evily smiled. Claire sighed, \"Please don't do anything that you'll regret.\" \"Trust me I won't regret this.\" He smirked as he let go of her hand and walked down the hallway. Eli walked away and found the person he was looking for. He closed his locker. \"What the hell Eli!\" said Eli's long time friend Andy. \"I need a favor.\" Eli said. Andy turned to his Eli. \"Man the last time I did you a favor we almost got suspended. I can't get my brother to come in again.\" he groaned. \"Aren't you tired of these jocks walking down these halls like they rule it? I am and one certain football player is getting on my nerves and I plan to end this once and for all.\" Eli said. Andy looked over at Eli who had a face that could scare anyone who looked at him. Lucky for him, Andy was used to it. He sighed knowing he would regret this but this was his friend. \"Alright text me the plan. By the way when is this taking place?\" he asked. Eli smiled, grimly. \"Tonight at the football game.\" he said. Andy walked away, shaking his head thinking what he had gotten himself into. Claire waited at her and Eli' s table at lunch. She tapped her foot against the table causing the table to slightly shake. Then Eli came and slid into the seat next to her, wrapping an arm around her waist. \"Hey.\" she smiled but he wasn't even looking at her but instead he glared at Johnny who was across the room. \"Claire, I have the perfect plan. And tonight at the football game it will come true. I will need your help though\" he said. \"Eli, no. Whatever you are planning I can't be a part of this.\" \"But tonight I'm going to-\" \"Forget it Eli. I'm not doing it.\" \"Are you going to do this to me? I have to do this and if you won't do this then fine.\" he muttered. \"You know Eli this is probably the stupidest thing. If you get caught you will get suspended and what about homecoming? Here's an idea why don't you just forget it.\" she spat before she picked up her books and walked away. Eli sat there but he knew that he was going to continue the plan. That night, Claire took off the jersey and put her uniform on. She glanced in the mirror. She was really hoping that Eli wouldn't do this stupid plan of his. Why couldn't he just forget about what Johnny said and just be happy that he was with her but no guys always had to be stupid and fight for what's theirs. She re-applied her make-up one last time before pulling her hair back into a tight pony tail. She took one more glance before smiling and heading out to the football game. When she got there she was greeted by the other cheerleaders. She looked around in the stands and there was no sign of Eli. Soon the game started and he wasn't there. Even though Claire was sad that he wasn't there she was happy that he wasn't there planning whatever plan he was planning. Around half-time he still wasn't there. She smiled in relief. Maybe he felt bad she thought. Had she been to hard on him at lunch? Claire decided to call him after the game to see how he was. With a minute before the game ended suddenly the power went out. Everyone whispered and screamed in panic. The football players were rushed back to their coach and the cheerleaders gathered around in a circle. It was completely dark. \"Ladies and gentleman!\" a voice boomed over the intercom. Claire froze, instantly recognizing the voice. Eli. DUN-DUN-DUN! So what did you think he will do next chapter? I tried to make it longer but I have to go back to school shopping :( ew. Review if you want the next chapter! No review no new chapter! So the next one will be the last one and then the epilogue! I promise this time that the next chapter will be out on the date I say. I already wrote a little bit of next chapter and I already have an idea for the epilogue. So the last chapter will be out next Sunday! And the epilogue will be out a few days later on Friday night. Sound good? Again, please review! No review no chapter! Sorry but that's how it has to be :) ","Summary":" \"Dad….why do I have to go to this school?\" Claire Edwards complained as she and her dad who was a"},{"Movie":"Rocky","Title":"Vengeance","Author":"isabella2004","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6850511","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I always thought that Ivan Drago got a bit of a hard time in Rocky IV. I think that he was just a guy who wanted to box but he was corrupted, manipulated and drugged by the Russian government. So I wanted to write about what might have happened after he lost…plus he's hot! Vengeance After his defeat at the hands of Rocky Balboa in Moscow, Ivan Drago returns to America and, keeping a low profile, starts to train with small time coach Jim Baxter. To help Ivan adjust to life in America, Baxter ropes in his daughter Jenny to tutor him in English. Separated from her violent boxer husband, babysitting another fighter is a job she doesn't want. But as the pair spend more time together Jenny realises they may be able to help each other more than she thought… Prologue December 26 th 1985 New York City His fist hit the wall, inches from her face, causing her to yelp and jump back. Turning to face him, she saw the familiar fury in his eyes and, mustering every ounce of courage she had left, she squared up to him. \"You fucking piece of shit.\" His mouth trembled with anger at her insolence. \"You walk out that door, Jenny and I'll smash your fucking face in, you hear me?\" It was no idle threat. She knew that he would. She had the memories of the bruises and fractured cheekbones to prove it. \"Go ahead,\" she replied, her voice trembling slightly, \"it's not as if you haven't done it before. That's all you boxers know, isn't it?\" He didn't say anything. \"You think you can solve everything with a punch. You think that's how you get respect. But it's not respect, Dan. It's fear. And fears can be overcome.\" He started to laugh contemptuously, \"Really?\" \"Yes,\" she said, \"really. I've spent the last five years of my life letting you control me and treat me like a punching bag …but not anymore Dan. No more. Now I'm walking out of this door and I'm leaving you and if you want to smash my fucking face in for doing that, then go ahead. But it's not going to change the fact that I'm not afraid of you anymore!\" It was a lie, of course. She was terrified. Perhaps more terrified than she had ever been before. But this time, she knew she had to do it. If she didn't, she would one day die at his hands. She had thought the day before, Christmas Day, might have been that day. A petty argument over the Rocky Balboa – Ivan Drago fight had led to her spending the night wide awake, a kitchen knife under her pillow. Dan moved even closer to her, so close that their faces were almost touching and she could feel his breath on her lips. She thought back to years gone by, when being this close to him made her body weak with desire. There was no desire anymore. There hadn't been for years. Two voices screamed inside her head. One was shouting this is it, he's going to kill you and the other was shouting this is it, you've done it. \"Go,\" he said suddenly, quietly, his eyes sweeping her with a look of utter disdain, \"I'm done with you anyway.\" He moved away from her, creating enough space for her to be able to turn, open the door and get out. Knowing from past experience that turning her back on him was never the safest option, Jenny felt for the door handle behind her, turned it and opened the door. Her eyes never left his face as she reached down to lift the suitcase at her feet. Slowly, she manoeuvred her body out of the door into the hallway, waiting, bracing herself for the moment when he would pounce and smash her head into the wall. It didn't come, but he stepped forward as she stepped back, following her out the door. Sensing freedom was in sight, she backed away from him along the hallway to the stairwell and then, seizing the moment, turned and ran as fast as she could, dragging the suitcase behind her, down and out through the main apartment door into the biting cold wind of a Boxing Day morning. Without looking back again, she sprinted to the car, wrenched open the door, tossed the suitcase in and then jumped into the driver's seat. As she jammed the keys in the ignition, she looked up, in time to see him appear at the main door. He made no move to come towards the car but merely watched as she started up the engine. Go, go! The voice inside her head was screaming even louder than it ever had before. You're free! You've done it! Slamming her foot down on the accelerator, she roared away from the kerb, keeping her eyes forward, her mind focussed on what she was doing. Twenty minutes later, her father opened his front door after her insistent knocking and pulled her into his grateful embrace. December 26 th 1985 Moscow, Russia \"Disgrace to your country! Disgrace to your wife! Disgrace to me!\" He sat, head bowed, as he had since that terrible moment when he had been knocked down in the ring. In the heat of the moment, when he had grabbed Rimsky by the throat at the ringside and screamed at them all that he fought to win for himself, he hadn't considered the consequences of a loss. Hadn't contemplated not been hailed a hero. Hadn't contemplated not being able to live up to the huge image of himself hoisted prior to the start of the fight. But he had been enduring those consequences ever since. Dragged from the ring, battered and bloodied, Nikoli had berated him all the way back to the dressing room, spewed venom at him as he had been examined by the doctor, only ceasing when he and Ludmilla had finally made their way home. Then there had just been the terrible silence as she refused to speak to him and slept in another room. \"After everything that we did for you! All the time, energy and resources spent on you…! You would have be nothing without me! Now you are nothing, Ivan, nothing!\" A day later, Nikoli was still speechless with rage. \"I did my best,\" he said quietly. \"This man…he was…\" \"A man! A little man that you should have knocked out in the first round!\" Nikoli stood in front of him, leaning towards him, pointing his finger in his face as though chastising a child. \"He should have met the same fate as Apollo Creed and yet you let him beat you! I do not know why I wasted my time and money on you!\" \"I am a good fighter.\" \"You are not!\" Nikoli insisted. \"You are a loser, Ivan. You will never fight professionally again in Soviet Union, I will see to that! You have embarrassed me and everyone around you!\" He straightened up and adjusted his tie. \"You would do well to think on that.\" He turned smartly on his heel and headed to the front door, letting it slam shut behind him. Ivan stood and moved to the window in time to see his, apparently, former manager be ushered into a large black car and speed away from the kerb. With him, went everything that had been dreamed of for so long. \"He is right.\" His wife's voice jolted him back to reality. \"Milla…\" he turned to where she was standing at the fireplace, her back to him. \"Don't,\" she said. \"I cannot look at you. I cannot…\" she trailed off. \"Nikoli is right. You should have easily won that fight. You were fit, you were trained, you were ready…\" He stepped towards her and then stopped, recognising that he would receive no solace from her. \"It is not the end,\" he said. \"I can try again. There will be other fights…other men.\" Ludmilla turned to face him, her expression hard, yet betrayed by a lone tear descending down her cheek. \"Don't you see, Ivan? It is the end. Without Nikoli…we have nothing. There is no trainer, no manager, no equipment, no money…\" \"No drugs,\" he interrupted bitterly. \"No needles to be put in me.\" Her eyes hardened and she raised her chin defiantly. \"We knew what we were getting involved in, Ivan. You did not complain when you were told what would happen. You did not flinch when those needles were put in you.\" \"You did not flinch either.\" \"I knew that it was all for your benefit! For your own good! To make you the great champion that I knew you could be!\" \"You did not believe that I could win without Nikoli? Without the drugs?\" He asked her the question he had always wanted an answer to. She didn't reply. \"You did not?\" \"I wanted you to win,\" she said finally. \"I wanted you to move beyond amateur level and become heavyweight champion. Was that so wrong?\" \"But you did not think I could do it without Nikoli.\" Ludmilla lowered her eyes, \"Perhaps. But now I think that you could not do it at all.\" She met his gaze again. \"Because you didn't.\" He strode forwards and gripped her shoulders. \"It will just be us again, Milla. Like it was before. Before Nikoli, before Creed and Balboa. Before any of it. We can start again.\" She shook him off. \"Didn't you hear what he said, Ivan? You will never fight again in Soviet Union. There is no future for you in boxing here. There is no future for us. The embarrassment and disgrace…\" He stared at her, \"You are more concerned about that than being with me?\" \"I am an Olympic champion,\" she said, \"a success. I am sorry…but I don't see how we can be together any longer.\" As she made to move past him, he grabbed her arm to stop her and she swung around, landing a stinging blow on his cheek that hurt more than any punch from Balboa. Instantly, he released her and she hurried away from him. An hour later, as she closed the door behind her, carrying as many of her possessions as she could carry, he made no effort to stop her.[Chapter 2] Thank you so much for all your reviews! I'm glad you like the story so far! Please keep it up. December 31st 1985 New York City Jenny stood at her father's front window watching as fat flakes of snow fell onto the ground. It had started just after breakfast and continued all day so that the street and sidewalk were both covered in a thick, white carpet. Cars navigated each other slowly as people attempted to go about their daily business but she could see that her own car was completely covered and there would be little chance of being able to dig it out if the occasion warranted it. In the far corner of the room, the radio was still playing Christmas songs, even though they day itself had passed. It would soon be a new year. 1986. A new beginning, her father had said. She knew he was right. Freedom from Dan brought endless possibilities to her, but there was also the fear. Fear of the unknown, of being alone again, and of the bitter battle no doubt yet to come. There had been no word from Dan since she had left. No phone calls, no appearances at the door begging for her forgiveness. It was the first time that he hadn't chased her and she didn't know whether to see that as positive or not. Perhaps it meant he would finally accept it was over and yet, in her heart, she didn't believe that he would. \"Dinner's ready!\" Jim called from the kitchen and she turned away from the window and crossed the living room where the smell of her father's roast beef was mouth-watering. \"I hope you're hungry,\" he said as she took her seat, \"I think I might have made a little too much.\" \"A little?\" Jenny echoed, her gaze falling on the heaped plate he placed in front of her. \"I'm still full from Christmas dinner.\" \"Nonsense. You need fattening up.\" He sat down opposite her and opened a bottle of wine. \"I told you before, Jenny, you've been looking much too pale and thin of late. Not that I don't know why.\" \"Let's not talk about it,\" she said quickly. \"If that's what you want.\" \"It is.\" The last thing she wanted, or needed, was her father to start dissecting her relationship with Dan. Though she knew he would always take her side, there was a part of her that felt he blamed her for not leaving before. \"So, are you going to file for divorce?\" Jenny paused and looked at him, \"Didn't I just say I didn't want to talk about it?\" \"All right,\" Jim replied. \"But I just think...\" \"Dad!\" \"Sorry.\" He put his fork down, reached over and squeezed her hand. \"I'm just glad that you're here, that's all. Your mother would be too.\" Her eyes fell on the photograph of her mother on the sideboard. The smiling face was so familiar and yet, in years gone by, her mother had looked perpetually worried every time she had seen her. With a stab of regret, she realised it was because of what she had put her through by staying with Dan. How she wished her mother had been here when she had arrived on Christmas Day. \"You still planning on doing my books?\" Jim asked, jolting her back to reality. \"Of course. Whenever you like.\" \"First few days after the New Year should be pretty quiet. Why don't you come down to the gym with me? Give you something to do before school goes back?\" \"Sure,\" she replied. It wasn't as though she had anything else to do. XXXX He hadn't been back to America since Creed had died. Returning to Moscow after that fateful night had been a blessing. The newspapers had been full of what had happened. The American hero, slain by the Russian invader. Ivan had never intended for Creed to die. He hadn't expected for one moment that his blows would be so deadly. When the reporter had thrust the microphone in his face and asked him what he thought about the injured fighter, he had replied as Nikoli had told him to. He had realised, hours later that it had been the wrong thing to say. As he stood in the line for immigration at Newark Airport, he looked out of the window to where the airport was rapidly becoming more and more obscured by the snow. There had been talk before his plane had left Moscow, that they might have to divert because of the bad weather. He had laughed to himself at how ill-prepared the Americans always were. In Russia, a little snow would not bring everything grinding to a halt the way it did here. His decision to return had been made quickly, mere hours after Ludmilla had left him. What was there for him in Russia anymore? He could go nowhere without being recognised as the man beaten by Balboa. He was pointed at, ridiculed, in the street and on television. The memories of that fight, of how the crowd had suddenly turned against him, were raw and he hoped that here, in New York, he could simply disappear. When he stepped up to the counter and handed over his passport and visa, the man at the desk looked at the photograph, then at him, then back to the photograph again. He studied the other paperwork carefully and Ivan knew that he recognised him. He shifted from foot to foot, hoping the man would hurry up, wanting nothing more than to collect his bags and leave. \"Enjoy your stay,\" the man said, finally, stamping his passport and handing it back. \"Thank you,\" he replied. Lifting his rucksack, he followed the signs for baggage claim and, once his suitcase had been retrieved, he headed for the main airport door. As it opened, he felt the raw, cold sting of the winter air on his face and flurries of snow settled in his hair. If he closed his eyes, he could have been in Moscow. Straight ahead, he saw a line of New York's famous yellow taxis and he hurried forward to the first one in the queue. As he approached, the driver tossed away his lit cigarette and opened the trunk for his bags. \"Where you headed?\" he asked, slamming it closed. Ivan paused. He had no idea. XXXX Jenny had only stayed up to keep her father happy. Dick Clark was on and he insisted she sit with him, drinking brandy and eating peanuts until the ball dropped on Times Square and it was officially 1986. Once all the initial excitement had passed, however, she made her excuses and headed for her bedroom, the room she had occupied as a child, little changed from those days. Outside her window, she could hear laughter and shouting coming from down the street as revellers spilled out of their homes or the nearby bars. Climbing into her bed, she pulled the duvet cover up close under her chin and closed her eyes. She wanted to sleep, to put everything that had happened behind her and to wake in the morning refreshed and ready to grab 1986 by the balls. Twenty minutes later, she admitted defeat, snapped on her bedside light and lifted a magazine. XXXX The hotel was nothing compared to the luxury he had stayed in on his last visit to the country, but it was cheap and anonymous and those were the two most important things to him right now. He had taken the room for three nights, enough time initially, he hoped, to be able to find somewhere more permanent. In a somewhat desolate area of town and with it being New Year's Eve, the noise from outside was incredible. People were shouting, glass was breaking, sirens were wailing...it was just how New York was portrayed on the television. A violent, disordered place. For a while, he lay on his back, staring at the stained, cracked ceiling listening to it all, but eventually he fell into a dreamless sleep, only to be suddenly woken by a banging on his door. He lay, unmoving, presuming it was simply a mistake, but the banging came again, louder and more insistent. Finally, Ivan climbed out of bed and moved slowly over to the door. Glancing through the spy-hole, he could see the figure of a man on the other side. The light directly above his door was broken and the man's face was shrouded in shadow. He banged the door again and Ivan stepped back, unsure as to what to do. He knew he would be able to defend himself from any threat, but such an altercation would surely threaten his wish to remain unknown. He stood, waiting, his heart thumping in his chest, then he moved forward to the door again and peered through the glass. The man was gone. He slipped back into bed and pulled the covers around him, feeling a sudden shiver go through his body. How he wished for the warmth and comfort of another person.[Chapter 3] January 2nd 1986 Jenny shivered as she flipped the lights on, bathing her father's gym in a yellow hue that only served to highlight how desperately it needed painted. One light in the corner started to flicker mercilessly and she suddenly remembered reminding her father to change the bulb before the gym had closed for the holidays. He obviously hadn't done it, which was typical. She loved him to death and when he was immersed in the world of boxing he was a ball of highly charged energy, excitement and anticipation. But he was nothing if not completely and utterly oblivious to maintenance issues. Crossing the floor, the sound of her boots echoed around the room, bouncing off of every wall, comforting her as she reached the office and unlocked the door. Clearly the other thing her father had neglected to do before the holidays was tidy up. Stained coffee cups littered the desk atop un-opened mail, Christmas cards and, more than likely, bills. Sighing, she dropped her bag in the corner and sat down in the worn leather chair that creaked under her weight. It was unlikely that anyone would come into the gym today given it was still technically the holidays so she was guaranteed peace at least to get on with what needed to be done. Her mind flitted briefly to the stack of papers sitting in her room at home just waiting to be graded in time for school going back next week. There was no way she could go back to work without having them done and yet…her mind just wouldn't let her focus on them. They were a symbol of her life. Her other life. The life she had with Dan. The one she was trying so hard to leave behind. She peeled off her jacket and flicked on the ancient coffee machine. There was only one thing to do and that was to engross herself in the accounts of a small, rundown boxing gym. XXXX Ivan replaced the receiver in the cradle and retrieved his money from the slot. It was the third time he had tried to call Ludmilla since he had arrived in New York and no-one seemed willing to divulge her whereabouts. He had tried everyone he knew, everyone she might go to and yet, nothing. \"Ivan, come home,\" his mother had said when he had called to say he was safely in New York. \"What is the purpose of this? Come home to your family. Perhaps then, you and Milla…\" She didn't understand why he needed to do this, and he didn't expect her to. All he could do was reassure her that he was well and that he would phone regularly and that if she heard anything from Ludmilla, she must tell him. Stepping out of the phone booth, he pulled his hooded sweater tighter around him to keep out the chill morning air. People scurried past him in all directions, going about their daily lives, and not one person even so much as glanced at him. It was a relief. Pulling his hood up, he began jogging along the sidewalk, focused once more on his mission for the day. He needed somewhere to train. It had been several days since he had pulled gloves on, punched a bag or done anything remotely linked to boxing and he was starting to feel the ill effects. He could almost feel his muscles withering away beneath his flesh. It was like the drugs they had pumped into him at home. When he stopped training, he started to get withdrawal symptoms. He needed to find a gym. Somewhere out of the way, anonymous, where he could be left in peace simply to clear his head and forget everything that had happened in the past. Perhaps it was too much to ask, but he just wanted to be the man he was before. He kept running, with no real sense of where he was or what direction he should take. The bustle of the main streets gave way to quieter areas and before he knew how far he had run, he found himself in what appeared to be a back alleyway. He paused and looked back they way he had come and yet, nothing seemed to be familiar. Looking up ahead, he saw a tired, grey building nestled between two brown stone buildings, the paint on its exterior flaking, wire mesh on the windows. There was a small sign above the door and, as he moved closer, he was able to make out the grimy picture of two boxing gloves. XXXX Jenny lifted her head and rubbed the back of her neck. A quick glance at her watch and a growl in her stomach indicated it was almost noon. Scattered on the desk in front of her were her father's accounts, mixed in with the un-opened bills. Trying to make sense of it all was starting to give her a headache and she decided that a brisk walk to the local deli and some decent coffee was required before she could even think about doing anything more. As she got to her feet, she heard the sound of the outer door bang. The noise made her jump and as she moved to the door of the office, she wondered who could possibly have decided to come and train. She recognised him immediately. Even though he was dressed so differently, in jogging pants and a hooded jumper, she would have known that face anywhere. It had been plastered all over the television for weeks and the Christmas Day fight had been advertised on billboards the length and breadth of the city. Moreover, she had watched transfixed as Balboa had slowly beaten him down, each round etching a further splinter of defeat on his seemingly flawless skin. He walked towards her, his gait unsure, his eyes darting around the gym as though expecting to be attacked at any moment. From the brash confidence of the man who had fought and killed Apollo Creed, Ivan Drago now looked unsure, scared even. \"Can I help you?\" she asked, surprised at the high-pitched quality of her voice. \"I…\" he looked around, as though wishing no-one else to hear their exchange. \"I look for gym.\" \"Well this is a gym,\" she replied, realising how ridiculous her words were the moment they were out. \"I mean…were you looking for a particular gym?\" Ivan shook his head. \"No. I look to…to train.\" \"Oh…\" Jenny paused. \"Uh….this is my father's gym and I'm sure…I'm sure he'd be happy to let you train here. He's a professional trainer,\" she added. \"I can box here?\" \"Uh…sure. I mean, there's no-one else here right now given it's still technically the holidays but…you're welcome to use the facilities if you want to.\" He frowned, \"Facilities?\" \"Oh, the ring, the weights, the pads…\" she trailed off, feeling her heart thumping in her chest for some inexplicable reason. \"I'm Jenny,\" she held out her hand. \"Ivan,\" he said, taking her hand in his. She was surprised by how gentle his touch was and the softness of his hand. Dan's had always been so rough. \"I know.\" He pulled away first, looking at the floor, as though unable to hold her gaze any longer. \"I can train now?\" \"Of course,\" she said, \"I'll show you where you can change.\" She crossed the gym floor towards the dressing rooms and opened the door. \"There's lockers and showers…uh…make yourself at home.\" \"Thank you,\" he said quietly and she found herself somewhat transfixed by the blueness of his eyes. \"I'll…uh…I'll just be in the office if you need anything,\" she tore her gaze away and, turning, hurried back across the gym into the office where she realised she had been holding her breath. It came out in a rush and she had to hold onto the desk for support. Sitting back down, she lifted the papers she had been reading over and tried to re-focus but her mind was reeling. Ivan Drago. The Ivan Drago was in her father's gym! Moments later, Ivan reappeared from the changing rooms, dressed in shorts, a wife beater and carrying gloves. Jenny watched as he crossed the floor to the nearest punching bag, pulled on the gloves and began training. His face was the picture of concentration as he danced around the bag, landing blow after blow, ducking and diving, as though the bag would suddenly reach out and smash him across the jaw. After a while, he stopped, his body glistening with sweat and, looking across, he met her gaze. \"Shit,\" she swore softly, lowering her head to the papers again. XXXX The girl, Jenny, seemed nice, Ivan thought as he caught sight of her watching him train. She was so different from Ludmilla, smaller, stockier and with a mass of dark brown curls cascading down her back. The oversized sweater she was wearing did nothing for her figure but he somehow found it more pleasing to the eye than his wife's sharp suits had ever been. Her face flashed across his memory and he landed one final, agonising blow to the bag before stopping to catch his breath and look again at Jenny. When she realised that he had seen her watching, she ducked her face out of sight. Rubbing his forearm across his forehead, he made his way across the room to the office door. \"Everything all right?\" she asked, looking up with a smile. \"Yes,\" he replied, taking in the wide brown eyes. \"You have many fighters here?\" \"A few,\" she replied. \"Mostly young boys from the neighbourhood, but a few older ones too.\" \"Your father is trainer?\" Jenny nodded. \"He was very successful in the late sixties, early seventies with some local fighters who made it all the way to national championships. Now…\" she trailed off somewhat wistfully. Ivan cocked his head to one side, \"Do you box?\" \"Me?\" she laughed. \"No.\" \"Not even little bit?\" \"Maybe some sparring every now and then, but not seriously.\" \"You spar with me.\" She looked at him as though he were mad. \"What?\" \"Spar with me,\" he repeated, pointing to the ring. \"We go, now.\" \"I'm not…no,\" she said. \"I mean, I…I…\" \"I be gentle,\" he reassured her, keen for the company. He saw the doubt in her face and realised, almost instantly, what she would be thinking. Apollo's shadow loomed over him. He would never be able to escape the events of that night in Las Vegas. All anyone in America would ever remember him for, was the death of their former champion. \"I understand,\" he said softly, turning away. \"Wait,\" Jenny said, causing him to turn back. \"I…\" Her words were lost as the window on the far side of the room suddenly exploded into a waterfall of glass, causing them both to jump and Jenny to scream as a brick smashed onto the floor and slid across to rest at his feet.[Chapter 4] Thanks for your reviews! Keep them coming! \"Jesus fucking Christ...\" Ivan turned as the words came tumbling from Jenny's mouth, and saw that she had gone deathly pale. \"Jesus Christ...Jesus Christ...\" Before he could say anything, she had hurried over to the far side of the room and then stopped dead, mere feet from the window. Slowly, she began to back away, her fists balled at her side, her body trembling. He moved beside her and looked through the shattered window to the other side of the alleyway where a man stood, angrily grinding a cigarette into the sidewalk. \"Do you know him?\" he asked. Jenny didn't reply. She turned and walked quickly down the corridor to the door, throwing it open and letting in a sharp blast of cold, winter air. He heard the sound of her voice, raised and angry, and slowly followed her to where, although shrouded in shadow, he could see her standing just outside. \"Fucking asshole!\" he heard her shout. \"Fuck you!\" came the response from across the street. \"You really think I was going to let you just walk away?\" Moving slightly to his left afforded Ivan a view of the man. He looked about his own age, dressed in jeans and a leather jacket, a bottle of vodka in his hand. \"I don't want to talk to you, Dan!\" Jenny shouted back. \"I don't want to see you and what the fuck was that?\" she gestured towards the window. \"You don't just walk away from me, Jenny,\" the man said, crossing and standing right in front of her. His voice lowered so that Ivan couldn't hear what he was saying but though he could sense Jenny's unease, she squared up to him. \"Go away,\" she said, loudly and clearly. \"I left you. It's over!\" She turned away but the man grabbed her arm, swinging her back around to face him. Ivan was poised to reveal himself when Jenny swung her fist and caught the man a sharp, stinging blow to the jaw. He reeled and staggered backwards, his hands at his face, his eyes wide with shock. \"Get the fuck away from me,\" she said, and he could hear her voice shaking. \"It's over!\" \"Do you know him?\" Ivan asked, as she hurried back inside, closed the door and bolted it firmly. \"My husband,\" she said, refusing to meet his gaze. Moving past him back into the gym she started wandering aimlessly between the bags, one hand continually coursing through her hair, the other pinching her bottom lip. He could feel the tension coming off her in waves and he stood helplessly at the door, unsure what to say or do. \"Can I...uh...do anything?\" \"Short of killing him for me, no.\" She stopped the moment the words had left her mouth and looked at him for the first time. \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean anything by that...I...\" she broke off. \"It's...it's complicated.\" Ivan chose to ignore the implication in her comment and pointed towards the changing rooms, sensing that it would be better if he left. \"I go?\" \"Uh...yes...yes if you want to,\" Jenny replied, distractedly, turning and heading back for the office. He watched as she sat down heavily in the chair and put her hand on the receiver of the phone. He waited, but she didn't lift it, instead lowering her head onto the desk in front of her. Mindful of his situation, he made his way back into the changing rooms, showered quickly and pulled back on his street clothes. As he re-emerged into the gym, he saw her replace the phone receiver. \"I go,\" he said. Jenny looked up, as though seeing him for the first time, and stood up to come towards him. \"I'm sorry about that,\" she said carefully, \"You shouldn't have had to see that.\" \"He is not nice man.\" \"No, he isn't.\" He waited, wondering if she would say more, but she simply pursed her lips together and looked at the floor. \"You will be all right?\" \"I'll be fine, thank you,\" she replied. \"You're...you're welcome to come here and train any time. My father usually charges a fee but you can discuss that with him when...if...you come back.\" \"Thank you,\" he replied. \"Well...goodbye.\" \"Bye.\" He turned and made his way back down the corridor to the door, unbolted it and slipped back out into the chilly air. There was no sign of the man, Jenny's husband, and as he made his back towards the main street, he knew he would definitely return. XXXX It was only once he had gone that Jenny felt able to break down. She sank to the floor next to the ring, sobbing, her body shaking with a mixture of fear and anger. Given the time that had passed, she had convinced herself that Dan had accepted the finality of the situation. Accepted that their marriage was over. Accepted that she had really and truly left him. His display of anger, however, made her realise that those thoughts had been foolishly premature. She pressed the heels of her hands into her eyeballs until she could see spots dancing in her vision. She had never raised her hand to her husband, other than in self defence when he had had her pinned to the floor. It had felt good, seeing the look on his face and yet she worried that it made her no better than him. \"Jenny?\" the door suddenly opened and her father appeared. \"Jenny, what the hell happened?\" He dropped to the floor beside her and pulled her into his arms, letting her cry against his shoulder. \"Is he still here?\" \"No. I mean... he didn't come inside.\" \"Why the hell did you go out?\" \"Because he smashed the fucking window!\" she exclaimed, pulling back. \"I can replace the window, Jenny, but I can't replace you,\" Jim said, pushing her hair back from her face. \"You're still my little girl, remember. Did you call the cops?\" \"No.\" \"Jenny...\" \"Dad, please don't start,\" she pulled away and got to her feet. \"You know what happened when I called them before, nothing. They didn't even talk to him, so what's the point?\" \"The point is,\" Jim said, scrambling up beside her, \"you've left him. You're not a wife too terrified to report her husband anymore. You're a woman who's made an important decision to leave him. Dan has to know that he can't get away with this!\" \"Then you call them,\" she said, \"report the window.\" \"They ain't going to do much about a broken window,\" Jim mused, \"especially with no other witnesses.\" \"Oh...\" she suddenly remembered, \"but there is another witness. Ivan Drago was here.\" Jim stared at her, \"Who?\" \"Ivan Drago.\" She laughed at his expression in spite of herself. \"I'm serious.\" \"Ivan Drago,\" Jim repeated. \" The Ivan Drago?\" Jenny nodded. \"He said he was looking for somewhere to train. To be honest, he looked more like he was looking for somewhere to hide.\" \"Well, is he coming back?\" Jim asked, his eyes suddenly alive with excitement. She sighed, \"After what happened with Dan, I doubt it.\" XXXX Ivan peeled some banknotes from the bundle in his pocket and handed them over to the woman at the desk. His quest to find a more permanent living arrangement had so far come to nothing given that most places were still closed for the holidays and he found himself forced to stay at the hotel for another few nights. The woman eyed him suspiciously as he passed her the money and he wondered if she recognised him or simply thought it odd that a tall, well built Russian was staying in the hotel. \"You had a phone call,\" she said, as he turned to leave. \"Telephone call?\" he asked, turning back. \"Yeah, some woman...\" she squinted at a piece of paper on the desk in front of her. \"Lud...Ludm...\" \"Ludmilla?\" Ivan asked eagerly. \"Sounds like it,\" the woman said, scrunching up the paper and tossing it in the waste bin under the desk. \"Anyway, she said to stop calling.\" Ivan felt his heart sink at her words. \"Stop...calling?\" \"That's what she said. I think. Her accent was kind of hard to understand, but that was about the long and short of it.\" He frowned, \"The long...?\" \"That's what she said,\" the woman said, in a tone that indicated she was wishing the conversation was over. \"Thank you,\" he said softly, turning away and heading for the stairs. When he reached his room, he closed and locked the door and then, as anger overtook him, he punched it once, hard. The sound was deafening and he couldn't help but remember that day when he had welcomed the world's media to his training centre and Ludmilla and Nikoli had showcased his incredible strength. Back then... He didn't want to think about it. That life was gone.[Chapter 5] Sorry for the delay in updating. Thanks for all your reviews and messages. Keep them coming! January 3 rd 1985 \"Oh my God Jenny! You must have been so scared!\" \"I guess,\" Jenny replied, twirling the phone cord around her fingers. \"But you know what, Rosa? I was angry too. Angry at the fact that he thought he could just turn up and smash the window like it was nothing.\" \"So what did you do?\" \"Well...I went outside and punched him.\" She smiled at the sudden silence on the other end of the phone. \"He deserved it.\" \"Holy crap...\" Rosa breathed. \"Jenny, you were lucky he didn't turn around and knock the hell out of you!\" \"I know...\" \"Jesus...\" \"It's not exactly something I'm proud of but...\" \"But...?\" \"But it felt good at the time.\" \"You are insane,\" Rosa chuckled. \"Have you graded those papers yet?\" Jenny glanced over her shoulder at the stack of papers still sat on the kitchen table. \"Not yet.\" \"We go back to work the day after tomorrow!\" \"I know and I'll get them done. It's just...\" she broke off. \"It's just what?\" \"Nothing. Listen, that's my dad back. I'd better go and heat up some supper for him. I'll speak to you later, ok?\" \"Ok, but you be careful, Jenny.\" \"I will.\" Jenny replaced the receiver and smiled at the concern of her closest friend. Rosa had seen her through every fight with Dan. Cried with her, helped her cover her bruises with makeup and given her a bed for the night when she hadn't wanted to worry her parents. She couldn't blame the other woman for being concerned. \"Hey,\" Jim said, opening the front door and stepping into the living room. \"What's for supper?\" \"Meatloaf,\" she replied, getting up off the chair and padding into the kitchen. \"Leave your boots outside!\" She switched on the gas and glanced at the heavy snow still covering the ground outside. \"It's cold enough to freeze hell over out there,\" Jim said, coming in behind her and switching on the kettle. \"You get any of that grading done?\" \"Ummm...well I moved some papers around, put them in order, that kind of thing.\" \"That's a no then.\" \"I'll bring them to the gym tomorrow and do them all in one go,\" she replied, peering into the oven. \"So...did he turn up?\" \"No,\" Jim replied and she could hear the wistfulness in his voice. \"I stayed open that extra half hour just in case but no sign.\" \"Well he didn't exactly get the best impression yesterday,\" she conceded. \"Can't hardly blame him if he went elsewhere.\" \"Guess not. It would have been good for business though, to have a proper fighter in the place.\" \"I know,\" Jenny sighed and put a hot plate down in front of him. \"Maybe he'll come back tomorrow.\" \"Maybe,\" Jim said. \"Maybe.\" XXXX \"You gotta be kidding me if you think I'm letting you stay here another night after what you did to my goddamn door! This is your last stop, buddy. Now get the hell out of my hotel!\" Ivan stood, staring at the woman in front of him, unsure what to say. The large dent in the bedroom door was obvious to everyone and yet, he hadn't expected to be thrown out. \"Where I go?\" he asked. \"That's your problem! You sure as hell ain't staying here!\" She crossed her arms across her chest and glared at him. \"What? You not understanding me, Ruski?\" Ivan grabbed his clothes where they lay on the bed and began stuffing them into his bag, humiliation washing over him. The woman was shouting so loudly that he was sure everyone else in the hotel could hear his disgrace. He felt his cheeks burn and knew that had she been a man, he would have struck her. Straightening up, he faced her. \"My money.\" \"You ain't getting a cent back from me,\" she snorted, \"and you're lucking I ain't demanding more from you to fix that door!\" \"But I pay you for three more nights!\" he insisted. \"I need money back!\" \"And I told you, you ain't getting anything back from me!\" She squared up to him, miniscule in stature and yet a giant in her fury. \"Now get out before I get someone to drag you out!\" In his mind, Ivan weighed up his options. He could refuse to leave and take his chances with whoever she might call on to remove him, or he could simply leave and start again. He elected to take the second option and as he hurried past her down the stairs, he could hear her taunts follow him until he was back out on the street. Darkness had fallen, as had the temperature and he pulled her coat tighter around himself. As he stared up and down the street, he realised that he had nowhere to go and no money. He knew no-one. No-one that could help him. He started walking just as the snow started to fall again and, like before, he suddenly found himself on a familiar looking street. Peering into the darkness, he could make out the sign above the gym where he had been two days earlier. As he drew nearer, he saw that it was in darkness and, after knocking loudly on the locked door without answer, realised that clearly there was no-one there. As he turned to walk back up the street, he suddenly caught sight of a wooden board, covering the window that the man had smashed when he had been there before. One corner of it was not nailed down properly and was banging in the chilly breeze. He realised that if he could somehow get in through the window, he would at least have somewhere to stay for one night. Slinging his bag across his body, he dragged a nearby trash can underneath the window and stood on it. It gave him the height to attempt to pull the board away from the window at both bottom corners, creating a flap which allowed him to pull his body up and under. The broken glass had been removed and he was able to slide in through the opening and drop down into the gym. The noise when he landed reverberated around him and he paused, waiting for someone to come and challenge him. But there was no-one. Afraid to turn on the lights, he moved forward in the darkness until he reached the door to the office that the girl, Jenny, had been sitting in. Pushing the door, he found it was unlocked and he stepped inside to where there was relative warmth. Sighing, he put his bag on the ground and prepared to settle himself in for the night. January 4 th 1985 Jenny unlocked the door of the gym and manoeuvred her way inside, balancing all of her papers in her arms. She had woken early and left a note for her father saying she was going to get a head start on her grading and that she would see him there later that morning. Flipping the lights on, she realised that he still hadn't gotten around to changing the bulb and shook her head. It had been the last thing she had said to him before he had left the house the previous day but, as usual, it had gone in one ear and out the other. As she opened the office door and switched the light on, a shape suddenly moved in the corner, starting her and she stepped back quickly, a scream about to burst forth from her mouth when she realised who it was. Ivan leapt to his feet and put out his hands, almost as if he were afraid she was going to attack him. \"I'm sorry,\" he said hurriedly. \"I did not mean to...\" \"What the hell are you doing here?!\" she exclaimed, her hand going to her chest where she could feel her heart thumping beneath her coat. \"You scared the shit out of me!\" \"I'm sorry,\" he said again. \"I...\" \"How did you get in here?\" \"The window,\" he gestured behind her, \"I...I was looking for place to stay and...\" he trailed off. \"So you thought you'd break into our gym?\" \"No, I...I'm sorry,\" he turned and lifted his belongings from the floor. \"I should not have...I go now...\" \"Wait!\" She stepped in front of him. \"I don't understand. Why were you looking for a place to stay? Don't you have somewhere?\" Ivan looked at the floor. \"I was asked to leave. They keep money and I could not find anywhere else. I remembered you and thought, maybe, you help me.\" As her heart rate returned to normal, Jenny felt her initial anger begin to dissipate to be replaced by curiosity. Ivan Drago, a great fighter, reduced to breaking into a rundown gym to sleep on the floor? \"Have you been here all night?\" He nodded. \"You must be hungry.\" He looked away, \"I...\" \"Look...why don't you take a shower and then I'll take you for breakfast.\" \"You do not need to. I can go...\" \"You at least owe me a little conversation after scaring me half to death,\" she insisted. \"Just let me call my father and then we can go, ok?\" Ivan nodded. \"Ok.\" He moved past her, out of the office, towards the showers. As he glanced back over his shoulder, she waved him on with her hand and, seconds later, he found himself standing under a hot shower, gratefully allowing the water to run over his body and ease his muscles, strained from hours lying on the floor. He was relieved that her reaction, although initially hostile, appeared to be becoming more favourable. After showering, he dried himself, put on clean clothes and stepped back out into the gym where Jenny was standing staring at the broken window. He came to stand beside her and followed her gaze. \"I am sorry about window. The wood was not...\" he fought for the right words. \"It was not...uh, how you say...?\" \"Secure?\" she finished for him. \"Yes, secure. I was able to...\" he recreated the motion of pulling the wood from the window with his hands. \"I get the picture,\" Jenny said. \"I called my father and he'll take care of it. He's dying to meet you,\" she added, walking towards the door. \"He'll come by later, once he's picked himself off of the floor.\" \"Did he fall?\" Ivan asked, as she opened the door for him. Jenny laughed, \"Not exactly.\" XXXX The cafe was quiet with only a few customers dotted around at tables. Jenny, for one, was glad of the peace. There were questions that she wanted to ask Ivan, something that wouldn't be readily possible if the place had been full of boxing fans. They both ordered full breakfasts from a waitress who looked as though she wouldn't have recognised him if he had been the President. \"So,\" Jenny said, when they were alone again. \"Why don't you have anywhere to stay?\" \"I punch door,\" Ivan replied, making the motion with his fist. \"They don't like that.\" \"I'm not surprised. Was there a particular reason or were you just sparring with yourself?\" He looked down at the table top. \"My wife, Ludmilla. She call and tell me to stop calling. I get angry and...\" \"I'm sorry,\" she said. \"You don't have to tell me anymore if you don't want to.\" Ivan shrugged his shoulders. \"She leave after fight with Balboa. She want to be with champion and I am not champion.\" He glanced up from under hooded eyelids. \"You see fight?\" She nodded. \"Then you know.\" \"Balboa's a good fighter,\" she said. \"You did your best.\" \"Even with drugs, I don't beat him.\" Jenny shifted uncomfortably in her seat. \"Well...I suppose that different countries have different ways of...\" \"No,\" he said sharply, meeting her gaze again. \"It wasn't right. But I do what I am told, always. I am told to fight Creed and I do it. Balboa want to fight me, so I do it. I do it for Nikoli and Milla.\" He sat back in his chair. \"Now I have nothing.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Not your fault. You see me as Russian, as killer.\" \"That's not...\" she broke off, knowing that it would be a lie to disagree. She had thought him a killer after the fight with Creed, a robot who cared nothing for his dying opponent at the ringside. She had joined in the conversations down-crying him, and cheered lustily for Balboa. But now, sitting opposite the man, she found him to be something she hadn't considered before. She found him to be human. The waitress appeared at that moment with their food and there was an enforced moment of silence. \"I suppose people aren't always what you think they are.\" Ivan speared a tomato with his fork and looked at her. \"You hit your husband?\" \"I've never done that before,\" she replied. \"At least not when he hasn't been hurting me first. He's a boxer too and rather than practice in the ring, he liked practicing on my face.\" She smiled at the expressed look of surprise that comment produced from Ivan. \"That's the look I get from people when they find out I was a battered wife. Either that or pity.\" She chewed on some toast. \"But I left him. The day after your fight, actually. When he came to the gym the other day...that was the first time I had seen him since I left. I wondered how he was taking it and now I know.\" \"You will go back?\" \"No,\" she said hurriedly, \"I'll never go back.\" She watched him for a long moment. \"Will you go back to Russia?\" Ivan paused. \"One day, I will have to.\" XXXX \"You know...\" Jenny said thoughtfully as they made their way back down the street towards the gym. \"There's a bedsit above the gym that no-one's using right now.\" \"Bedsit?\" \"Yeah, it's like...it's like a whole house in one room. There's a bed, couch, small kitchen and bathroom. It's not exactly in liveable condition at the moment but...you could probably stay there just now if you needed to.\" \"I don't want to...\" \"It's better than you sleeping on our office floor,\" she said. \"I'm sure dad won't mind. Not once he's met you and told you what a great fighter he thinks you are.\" Ivan looked at the ground again. \"He will not say that.\" \"Don't be so sure. Come on, I'll introduce you.\" As she reached out and grabbed the handle, Ivan's hand suddenly covered her own. She looked at it and then back at him. \"I don't know why you help me,\" he said, \"but...I thank you.\" \"Don't worry about it,\" she replied, her voice coming out more high-pitched than she intended. \"Maybe you can teach me to hit better.\" Ivan smiled as she opened the door. \"You need no help there.\"[Chapter 6] Gosh, it has been so long since I last updated this! I'm not sure if anyone is still interested, but here's a new chapter! Please review if you can! As soon as they went inside, Jenny could hear the sound of gloves hitting pads and realised that there were others there. Walking into the body of the gym she recognised two young boys from the neighbourhood sparring in the ring and prayed they wouldn't say anything unexpected. At first, they seemed oblivious but as she and Ivan walked towards the office, they suddenly stopped what they were doing and stared. Jenny glanced at Ivan and saw a look of uncertainty mar his features, but they were saved by Jim rushing out of the office, excitement lighting up his face like a child at Christmas. He hurried forward to greet them, extending his hand to Ivan as he did so. \"Dad this is Ivan,\" Jenny said, somewhat redundantly. \"Ivan, my father Jim Baxter.\" \"A pleasure to meet you,\" Jim said enthusiastically pumping Ivan's hand. \"An absolute pleasure! To think, you chose our gym to train in!\" Ivan glanced over at her with an expression that screamed confusion, but she merely smiled and nodded encouragement at him. \"I am sorry about last night,\" he said slowly. \"I did not mean to cause trouble or...\" \"Nonsense,\" Jim waved his hand dismissively. \"I'm only sorry we didn't know you were in need of a place to stay. You would have been most welcome here, most welcome.\" \"I mentioned to Ivan about the bedsit,\" Jenny said, lowering her voice so that the boys wouldn't hear her. \"He doesn't have anywhere else to go at the moment and it's lying empty...\" \"Not in the best of conditions,\" her father interrupted her. \"I know, but I'm sure that we could make it liveable.\" \"I do not want to cause problem,\" Ivan interrupted. \"Oh it's no trouble, no trouble at all!\" Jim enthused. \"In fact, Jenny why don't you show Ivan up there now? I've got some work to do with Tony and Frank here,\" he gestured to the two boys who were still staring open-mouthed. \"Ok,\" Jenny said, \"It's just this way.\" She led Ivan through towards the back of the gym and out of a door in the corner which led into an overgrown courtyard. A flight of rickety steps to their right led up to another door above them but when she put the key in the lock and turned it, she found that the door refused to open. \"Just a sec,\" she said, pressing her body against it to no avail. \"I can get it, just hang on...\" \"Let me try,\" Ivan said, gently touching her shoulder. Feeling a jolt go through her body, Jenny stepped to one side and, with seemingly little effort, he pushed the door open. \"\"I wasn't really trying that hard anyway,\" she joked, but the look of confusion on his face made her realise that he didn't understand her humour. \"So, this is it,\" she said, stepping inside and immediately wrinkling up her nose at the musty smell. \"It hasn't been used for a while and it's a bit of a mess, but I'm sure we can fix it up for you.\" She moved over to the window and pulled open the curtains, coughing violently as dust flew at her. \"I can sort that with the vacuum.\" Surveying the room for the first time in so long, she cringed at how bad it really looked. There was a bed pushed up against the far wall, a dining table with four uneven legs that meant it sat at an unusable angle and the yellow units in the small galley style kitchen were lined with grime. Two rickety looking chairs completed the set up and Jenny found she couldn't even bring herself to look in the bathroom. \"Look,\" she said, \"it's worse than I thought it was so if you really don't want to stay here...\" \"It is fine,\" he replied quietly. \"Ivan, it's a shithole.\" \"No,\" he looked at her and she saw the genuine gratitude in his eyes. \"It is not shithole. It is good.\" \"Well...\" she put her hands on her hips. \"I guess it's nothing a good clean can't sort out.\" XXXX \"I figured you workers could use some refreshments,\" Jim declared three hours later as he appeared at the door with a tray bearing three cups of coffee. \"I have to say...you've done a good job so far.\" \"Dad, the place still looks horrendous,\" Jenny turned around from where she had been scrubbing the kitchen and pushed her hair out of her eyes. \"Rather Ivan than me staying here.\" She tossed her cloth into the sink and gratefully came to lift a cup. \"Where is he anyway?\" \"In the bathroom, grappling with the shower. Hang on I'll get him.\" The bathroom door was closed over and when she pushed it open and went inside, the first place her eyes went was his naked back, stretched as it was over the bath, glistening with sweat from the effort of cleaning. \"Hey,\" she said, her voice coming out much higher pitched than she had intended. \"There's coffee out here for you.\" He straightened up so as to be facing her and she couldn't help admire the contouring of his abs, the perfect formation of his pecs and the strong muscles in his shoulders. \"It's...it's here when you want it.\" Turning, she hightailed it back out into the living area where Jim was peering at the carpet, oblivious. Moments later Ivan appeared, his wifebeater now covering what, seconds earlier, she had been stunned by. Wordlessly, he lifted a cup from the tray and sipped it, his eyes on her. \"What's wrong with the carpet?\" she asked, eager to distract herself. \"Reckon it needs replaced,\" Jim replied. \"But it should be all right for now.\" He grinned at Ivan. \"What do you think?\" \"I think it nice,\" Ivan replied. \"How I pay?\" \"Oh, don't worry about that,\" Jim said, waving his hand dismissively. \"I must pay. I have...little money but...\" \"It's not a problem...\" \"No!\" he said, stronger this time, causing them both to look at him. \"I must... I must...\" Clearly unsure of the English, he reverted to his native tongue, stopping only when he saw they didn't understand him. \"I am sorry.\" \"It's ok,\" Jenny reassured him, glancing at her father. \"Dad, maybe Ivan could help you in the gym? I'm sure there's lots of kids round here that could benefit from training with him.\" When she looked back, however, Ivan looked somewhat stricken at the prospect. \"Unless...you don't want to do that?\" \"It's not...I...\" he struggled for words again. \"I am known for...for killing. I don't want...\" he trailed off, his eyes begging with them to understand. \"No-one is going to think anything about that,\" Jenny insisted. \"I promise. Besides, we wouldn't let anyone coming to this gym treat you with anything other than respect.\" \"Of course not,\" Jim added. \"So, what do you say?\" Ivan looked between them, at Jim's eager expression and at Jenny's reassuring one and nodded. \"I say yes.\" XXXX Jenny had hoped that sleep would come easily that night. Her alarm was duly set for six am the following morning, ready to rouse her into the first day back to school and she knew that if she didn't get at least seven hours, she would be the crankiest one of them all, never mind the kids. Lying in the dark, she stared at the ceiling, willing her eyelids to droop but instead found herself feeling wide awake. His face, his body loomed before her, the image of him standing in front of her, his bare skin inches from her, burned the back of her eyelids every time she tried to invite sleep. She could imagine lifting her hand, placing it gently on his chest, her fingers tracing shapes in the sweat. Then she saw his body moving closer to hers, her nipples hardening at the sensation of his hands finding her waist and drawing her into him. His mouth on her neck as she felt his hardness through his pants... \"Jesus...\" she whispered, sitting upright in the bed. \"Get a grip!\" Ruefully, she had to admit that it had been so long since she had experienced anything approaching good sex than she had started to forget what it felt like. Latterly, with Dan, she had acquiesced out of fear, Rosa's stark words echoing in her head every time. \"He's basically raping you, Jenny.\" Shaking the demons of the past from her subconscious, she got out of bed and padded into the living room to get a drink, only to be surprised at the sight of her father sitting in the chair by the fire, peering at the television, the volume almost muted. \"What are you doing?\" she asked, causing him to jump. \"You almost gave me a heart attack!\" Jim exclaimed. \"I couldn't sleep but I didn't want to wake you.\" He peered at her. \"What are you doing up?\" \"I can't sleep either,\" she admitted, flopping down onto the couch and pulling her legs up underneath her. \"What are we watching?\" \"I have no idea. I switched it on about ten minutes ago and I've been trying to work that out ever since.\" He clicked the picture off. \"You want some hot milk?\" Hot milk...it was like being a kid again when she couldn't sleep. She would go through to her parents room and waken her mother who never chastised her, but would simply lead her into the kitchen, make her hot milk and sit with her in the big armchair until she fell asleep. She would wake the next morning, back in her own room with no recollection of how she got there. \"I should be making it for you, \" she joked, getting up and walking into the kitchen. \"I'm not completely helpless,\" Jim protested, following her. But he put up no argument as she pulled a saucepan from the cupboard and switched on the gas. \"You think Ivan's ok back at the gym?\" Jenny paused, her mind going back to him. \"I'm sure he appreciates the bedsit more than the floor of the office.\" \"He seems a nice guy,\" Jim mused. \"Not what I thought at all.\" \"What did you think he'd be like?\" \"I don't know. Perhaps more like how the news portrayed him. Unable to think for himself...cold...calculating...but he doesn't seem like that at all.\" \"No,\" she agreed, pouring the milk into the pan. \"Not at all.\" XXXX Ivan too was struggling with sleep. The bedsit was comfortable enough and he was grateful for the Baxters' generosity but something...something just wouldn't let him rest. Eventually, having stared at the ceiling for what felt like hours, he got out of bed and went to stand at the window that overlooked the courtyard below. Save for the moonlight, it was in complete darkness and the trees swaying in the night breeze only served to give the place an eerie atmosphere. He wasn't a man to scare easily, for he knew he could defend himself if needs be, but he couldn't help but think that there were people out there, waiting for him, waiting to hurt him. As he turned away to head back to bed, his attention was caught by a shape moving at the far corner of the building. At first he thought he had imagined it, but as he continued to watch, he saw the shape of a person creeping around the corner and peering towards the back door of the gym. The figure was dressed all in black, but as he turned his face upwards, Ivan saw the familiar features of the man who had thrown the brick through the window, the man Jenny had said was her ex-husband. For a moment, he wondered what to do. There was no phone in the bedsit and, even if there had been, he had no means of contacting him. There could be no other purpose for her husband to be there other than to cause trouble. Taking a deep breath, he slipped his feet into his running shoes and opened the door.[Chapter 7] Hello folks! Once again, I'm so sorry for not updating for a long time. I'm now on maternity leave having had my wee boy 7 months ago and thought I would have lots of time to write. How wrong I was! I do want to finish this story (still a long way to go!) and I was watching some Dolph the other day and just got the mojo back. Hope you enjoy it and please review if you can! January 5 th 1986 Dan had thought about going to the house to confront her. After all, he was a direct man who preferred the one on one approach. Sneaking around in the dark wasn't usually his thing. But he also knew that Jim, although past his best, could still land a pretty mean right hook and that when it came to his daughter, he no doubt wouldn't hesitate to do so. Dan had known for years that Jim didn't like him, most likely from the first time he saw a bruise grace Jenny's face. Accidents. They had all been accidents, mistakes, transgressions that he had apologised to Jenny for and she had graciously accepted. But not this time. This time, after their fight at Christmas, she had walked away. Packed her bags and left. No-one did that to him, least of all her. His mother had never walked away from his father and he would be damned if his wife walked away from him. He balled his fists at his sides to stop himself from punching the wall. His last approach had been stupid. Coming to the gym tanked up on vodka...he had been an easy target for her to land a lucky punch of her own. He had been surprised but, in some ways, it had also been a massive turn on. If things had been different, if they hadn't been in the middle of the street, if they had been inside he knew, as sure as he knew anything, that that punch would have led to some incredible sex. Jenny was nothing if not predictable. This was his next best option. Hit her and her father where it would hurt. Their precious gym. Once a place where many an up and coming fighter would train, himself included, now a rundown ghost of its past. And yet, they loved that place, kept it going, flogging the dead horse. He didn't know why. What was the point in sentiment? Not when there were shiny new gyms in the city to take over. Slipping the crowbar out from under his jacket, he levered it against the lock until it easily cracked and the door sprang open. There was no sudden burst of wailing alarms, no security guard shouting at him. There was nothing except the wind. Pathetic, he thought, as he lifted the can and slipped inside. In reality, he was doing them a huge favour. XXXX By the time he got down into the courtyard, Dan had vanished and, for a moment, Ivan wondered if he had imagined the whole thing. Perhaps he was starting to hallucinate, seeing enemies everywhere he went. Then he heard a soft thud, as though a door had closed without catching properly and, turning, he saw the back entrance to the gym slightly ajar. Clenching and unclenching his fists, he moved towards the door, trying to stay as silent as possible. Although he hadn't seen a weapon, it didn't mean the other man might not be carrying one. Quietly, he pulled the door open and slipped inside, making sure that he closed it behind him, before making his way slowly down the corridor towards the main gym. Although it was dark, the moon was full, giving him enough light to be able to see where he was going. As he drew nearer, he heard a clattering sound, as though something had been dropped, and he caught sight of a figure in the far corner. Ducking behind one of the bags, Ivan watched as he began emptying liquid out of a can onto the door and walls, moving along and across towards the ring. An acrid smell filled the air, one that Ivan instantly recognised as gasoline. His purpose became all too clear and, without giving it further thought, Ivan stepped out from behind the bag. \"Ostanovis! Stop!\" Dan jumped and swung around to face him, the can falling from his hand and rolling across the floor. \"What the fuck...?\" He peered in the dim light. \"Who the fuck are you?\" \"You should leave,\" Ivan said. \"I don't know who you are, but this has nothing to do with you!\" Dan said, his hand going into his pocket. \"So if you know what's good for you...\" he paused and frowned. \"Wait a minute...I do know who you are.\" Ivan stepped forward again, hoping this might give him some form of advantage. \"Then you should leave.\" \"You're Ivan Drago!\" Dan exclaimed incredulously. \"Ivan Drago! In this fucking hellhole? The Siberian Express! Death From Above!\" he walked up to him and started laughing. \"Knocked out by a small Italian! Way to go, big guy! You know, I box. I mean, I'm not exactly heavyweight champion of the world but I reckon that even I could have beat Balboa...\" He stopped suddenly. \"But, what are you doing here? Are you working with Jim? Don't tell me you left Russia to come here and work with him? Fuck me, times must be hard! But then, I guess you're not exactly flavour of the year as far as the old Ruskis are concerned...\" Ivan knew he shouldn't have reacted. He had never reacted, not in the days since his defeat. When he had been browbeaten by Nikoli, Milla, everyone...he hadn't reacted. He had accepted the criticism, taken it as best he could and internalise the feelings. Now, faced with this...man...this man that he knew could hurt...someone...he felt himself lash out, a stinging blow catching Dan across the face and sending him sprawling backwards. Dan leapt quickly back to his feet, his hand to his mouth and Ivan felt himself tense into fighting stance. He had fought no-one since Balboa, hadn't even considered another fight, but as Dan rushed at him, he knew he had no choice. XXXX Jenny's first concern, when she ran into the gym, wasn't for the fixtures and fittings and it certainly wasn't for Dan. When the phone had shrilled through the house in the early morning, waking her from a dream the details of which she couldn't now remember, and her father had answered it, something inside her had just known that he was involved. Part of her, the dark part that she would never admit to, had half hoped it had been the police to say that he had died, but as Jim had relayed the story of a break in and a fight, she had realised that she would never be that lucky and found herself suddenly desperate to know if Ivan was safe. Through the throng of people that had gathered, police, emergency personnel and curious bystanders, she only sought one person and felt relief flood her when she caught sight of him sitting at the edge of the ring having his hand bandaged. \"Are you all right?\" she demanded, skidding to a stop beside him. \"What the hell happened?\" \"Looks like a cracked knuckle,\" the EMT answered before Ivan could speak. \"Ice and bandages for a few days and it should be fine.\" He gestured over his shoulder. \"Looks like he came off the worst.\" Jenny turned to where a battered and bloodied Dan was having steristrips attached to a cut on his forehead, a police officer flanking him. His expression was surly, his gaze fixed on Ivan. She had seen that look so many times during their life together and she felt an involuntary shiver pass through her body. She turned back to see Ivan looking at her. \"What happened?\" she asked again, her voice calmer. \"I see him break into gym,\" Ivan replied. \"I stop him and...we fight.\" \"Bare knuckle fighting? Is that what you do now?\" He frowned, \"I don't...\" \"Never mind,\" Jenny sighed, sitting down next to him. \"You should have just called us, or the police.\" \"He would have seen me if I go into office to use phone. I have no choice but to fight him.\" His words were calm, his tone measured and yet there was a look in his eyes, almost like a child, desperate for praise. \"You always have a choice,\" she replied. Gently, she lifted his hand and examined it. \"Does it hurt?\" \"A little. Nothing to before.\" \"He didn't hit you in the face then,\" she said, observing that not so much as a mark grazed his flawless skin. \"He did, but it take more than him.\" He looked down. \"I am sorry if you are angry. If you want me to leave...\" \"Don't be ridiculous. You don't have to be sorry and you certainly don't have to leave.\" She glanced over towards Dan again. \"I should be thanking you, for protecting our property and for making him suffer.\" Pausing, she sniffed the air. \"Is that gasoline?\" \"He throw it over things,\" Ivan said, \"I think he try to set fire.\" Jenny glanced over his head towards Dan again. \"Asshole...\" she got to her feet, \"You're a fucking asshole, Dan!\" He glared at her but said nothing as the officer began cuffing him. \"Too scared to do anything or say anything when the cops are around? Such a fucking coward that you have to beat your wife in private and break into our property in the middle of the fucking night?!\" Before she knew what had come over her, she was flying for him, fists raised, ready to beat the living shit out of him. But before she could reach him, before she could inflict the damage she wanted to, she felt arms go around her waist and pull her back as two officers stepped between them. \"Knock it off!\" One of them shouted at her, his hand hovering over his holster. \"We're taking him downtown to be processed for breaking and entering and attempted arson. If you want to join him on an attempted assault charge, then carry on. Otherwise...\" \"It's fine officer, \"Jim said, stepping in front of her. \"My daughter's just upset about what's happened here tonight. We all are. If you can just remove Mr Sullivan then that would be much appreciated.\" It was only seeing her father standing in front of her that made Jenny realise that he wasn't the one holding her back. Allowing herself to go limp, she turned and saw that it was Ivan's arms she was encircled in, his hands that were on her waist and she felt a sudden current jolt through her body. Almost as if he had felt it too, he let her go, stepping back as he did so. Her face flushed, Jenny turned back to where Dan was being led away, meeting his gaze as she did so. A realisation seemed to flash in his eyes, his gaze suddenly darting between her and Ivan. Before he could say anything, and before she could refute what she knew he had seized upon, he was gone. \"You should have let me hit him!\" she turned and snapped before she could stop herself. Ivan said nothing for a long moment, as though he was weighing up the meaning of her words and the reason for her sudden anger towards him. \"You would have been arrested.\" Anger began to build inside her like a volcano brewing and bubbling before it erupted. \"Maybe that wouldn't have been a bad thing! Maybe it would have been worth it for me to land a few on that son-of-a-bitch!\" \"No,\" he shook his head, \"it would not be worth it.\" The volcano erupted. \"Oh, because you would know, would you?! You know what it's like to have a husband who likes to hit you?! Who think it's all right because his Daddy used to hit his Mommy?! You know what it's like to have to cover yourself in make-up and hide the bruises?! To tell everyone that your marriage is perfect when you know that it's nothing but a living hell?!\" Her voice reverberated around the room, the few remaining cops and forensic team staring at her as though she had suddenly lost her mind. \"To lie there, night after night and let him fuck you because you're too afraid to tell him to stop?! Who are you to tell me that I shouldn't have just fucking killed him right now for everything that he's ever done to me?!\" \"Because I have killed!\" he snapped back. \"Because I have killed and it is...it is...\" he fought for the right words in English and found himself wanting. \"I don't want...you don't want to know...\" The fire and anger left her body as quickly as it had come and she suddenly felt depleted, as though she had, in fact, just gone fifteen rounds in the ring. Glancing at her father, she saw a look on his face that made her want to break down and cry and she realised that there were things in her marriage that he had probably suspected happened but hadn't really wanted to believe did. \"I'm sorry,\" she said, her voice calmer, more under control. \"I'm sorry, I shouldn't have...I shouldn't have said anything... oh God...\" she caught sight of the clock on the wall. \"I should be getting ready for work.\" \"Jenny...\" Jim said, his voice shaking slightly, \"Maybe...\" \"I have to go to work,\" she interrupted him. \"It's the first day back and the kids will be expecting me and their graded papers. I should get going...\" she paused and turned back to where Ivan was still standing, his gaze uncertain. \"I'm sorry Ivan,\" she said. \"I shouldn't have said...I shouldn't have said what I did. You...you were right to stop me.\" Ivan watched as she hurried to the main door of the gym and slipped out into the dull morning light, the door banging behind her. For a moment, there was silence, no-one in the room knowing what to say. But, gradually, the forensic team continued their work and the cops began talking amongst themselves again. He stood, not quite knowing what to do, not sure of what his place was. \"Thank you,\" Jim said, \"for stopping her.\" \"It was...how you say...instinct?\" Ivan replied. \"Yeah, well...\" Jim sighed. \"Next time I'm face to face with him, I hope your instinct fails you.\" ","Summary":" I always thought that Ivan Drago got a bit of a hard time in Rocky IV.

She is so beautiful, but so fragile and defenseless, though recent attempts to prove otherwise. But she has changed. I still could not understand that it was different, but it's something I was attracted even more. And then, Adrian has filled the void, and all these years was beautiful. — Good morning! — I whispered in her ear, patting on the back. — I see that you're awake. I could Wake you a few minutes earlier, but his conscience did not allow me to do you here so comfortably. Still, it's time to get up, how would you not want to... soon for training. Believe it or not, but would send all to hell and stayed home, but once agreed. — And let me use my hook, which you loved so much yesterday? — hugging me tight, she mumbled sleepily. — Ho-Ho. This is why? Why? Well, it is necessary for me to enjoy the beautiful morning. Will be in and out a couple or three minutes... Yes, I love you too! And because of you I didn't have enough time to sleep. What kind of animal instincts? And how the hell are you going to work today? — What? You pounced on me! Perhaps that's Boxing for you so act. — What? Ah, so that's all we had. Yeah. And to me it seemed different... And since we're both up, how about coffee in bed? — Well, bring it! — I can't. I... I'm not really dressed. Ha ha, nice recovery! OK, I'll go cook! — gently kissing Adrian in the head, I released her from the embrace. Rising from the bed and bringing myself up, went down. POV Adrian I think he broke something... well the morning started. Throwing robe, I went downstairs to the kitchen, where, in fact, I heard the beating plates. A couple of enterprising breakfasts, and our house will be new dishes. Of course, I don't mind, but fragments of something all over the kitchen to collect me. That you broke? — I gave Polly and her husband an indignant look. — Late to practice? I used to be able to say... go, I will clean it up. Kissing me, he left, and I began to pick up the pieces. All would be nothing if she is not talking with me on my sick theme. What kind of person? Not only that, I am a long time because he felt a failure and had completely let myself go, so now he decided to take me to the other side. What the hell are you doing, SIS? he grabbed one of my hands broom. — Doing what I always did every day, living with you. — He needs to continue to box. And because of you he... I don't understand what you mean. And it's all a lie, he decided to leave the box. — Yes, it would be rubbed to powder your fault. You tortured him completely... brought so that it barely drags. You look at him. — Stop it! — I cried. — Don't speak. I don't wish anything bad rocky... I love it, I don't want another blow turned him into a cripple... and let's close this subject once and for all. — No, sister, you'll go to him and tell him that he didn't mind that he was going to do. Go. Now! What have we got happening? suddenly was heard the voice of her husband. We have everything in order, rocky. Don't worry, I looked at him with eyes full of tears — think I'm stupid? I know you are drawn to Boxing. I don't mind! I hope I have satisfied your wish, Polly. But so you both know, I'm not going to participate in the madness. On your workout you don't drag. And creed especially. And then you're... — I'm a bit downcast eyes, looking at his brother, just a pig! Come on, tell me what I owe you until the end of days. Because you brought us together. And that... So not more to say nothing more, I hastily left the room. This is totally unlike me. But everything else was quite in the style of my unlucky brother. — Adrian... Polly, don't talk to her! I'm more alert I will not. Rocky came up to me and put his arm around her shoulders. Hell, I don't want him back in the ring. It's time to think about something else. Well, how much they can stand? One, five rounds, and then? — Honey, don't take his words to heart... you know Polly, and his tongue. Don't you cry, he pulled me close, I know you don't want my return to the ring, I know what you're afraid of it, but to hang up the gloves — my personal desire. I was quite happy with the workout, honestly! — he patted me on the head. Follow me promised to call Apollo today train in his room... And if you want to vent, feel free to punch bag in the yard... Go, you need it. And you should not tolerate it. I know you're very strong, but I want to warn, if he continues to hurt you, I would deal with it differently. Don't look at the fact that we were related. All. Get dressed and go to training. The husband left, and I do not have it yet, decided to take his offer and work out, along with steam release. Son was playing under my nose, Butkus, too, was hovering close by and every time they jump out of the pool, shook off right at me, then the son began to laugh. Ah, at least somebody's having fun... I Think I got too excited about beating this bag. Lost track of time and didn't notice the return of rocky and Apollo, yet they do not come to me with rounded eyes. — Honey, are you still... — rocky handed me a towel. — Oh, boys! Not noticed as you came... Yes, I still. Uh, out of breath. Mrs. stallion, I see you got a taste. Powerful hammer — said creed. Well, when such teachers... I showed eyes at her husband — okay, I go shower, and you, if you are hungry, on the stove is soup. — M-m-m, I could scrub your back, the husband approached me. — No, thanks, I got it! — encouraging wink to them, I hurried away, leaving them alone. — She finally came to her senses after your last fight. And you know, Hoss, you got very lucky with his wife. Beautiful, wise, understanding, and favorite thing you shared. Who would have thought. And yet... strong. My rarely been in fights, it's hard. And Adrian... I think the fight with Clubber painful moves so far. We looked at her, because she's sitting next to. And when you fell down a series of powerful strokes and you fell, she loudly shouted:\"Stop the fight\". This is similar to my wife... I know, no, I can't even imagine how hard it was it all to see any other in her place would have long screaming flew out, and she... until recently sat. Falling, he noticed how she closed her face with her hands. I needed her presence, she's my mascot. The secret of this victory is not only yours. I still remember her words. I had no idea that she was able to scream to get through to me. Well, this woman knows how to find the right words that will set me... — You take care of her. You need it more than you think... okay, thanks for the workout, I gotta go, wife is waiting. The evening cultural program. In the evening, when I took a shower after the second workout, I decided to talk with her husband. Oh, Yes... this is the sore subject of our conversations. But anyway, we should discuss it. — Rocky... — I called out to him when he comes into our room. — Yes! — he stared at me. — Um... I wanted to ask you. Of course, I anticipate your phrase, but I still ask. Tell me how you will relate to what I go back to work in a pet shop? — How would react? You know! Well, why would you, Adrian? You deserve this and more! Why do you again come back to where you started? Why? — Please... this place I have so many memories! Well, Rocky! — embracing him, I quickly kissed him on the cheek. — A favorite! Native! The most remarkable, — I continued to kiss him, you don't mind, right? — How can I be against it when you want to? Just let me get this straight... you don't recycle! Okay, okay, okay. Although I can't promise anything... I just want to work! — Don't forget what happened a few years ago — he said, — okay, I'm sorry, this is getting bad... by the way, you food for the Butkus and turtles. Just see that there were fewer moths. The moths get caught in their throats, then have to slam them on the shell. How to know what will happen to them... shell shock... I laughed when I remembered this joke. Okay, I'm going to choose the right food, I promise! TWO DAYS LATER... For the second day I went to work in a pet shop for their legitimate half-time. Gloria have been looking for some help, so without any hesitation took me in. However, she said the same thing and my husband:\"Why do you need all this?\". Well, like me! And nothing I can do about it. After a small incident with a stranger, the husband came every evening to me and we went home together, and the day before your training runs to see how you're doing or how late I'd be late. Before he left, he helped me with the heavy bags. Or pour the contents, or simply drag and drop to another location. Today I spent in the pleasant memories of the evening. So nice that they even forgot about the fact that the day is coming to an end. Mrs. jerebear! — I heard from her husband, when he placed jars of food. Heh, picked up the Apollo... and what I like. Butkus, whose rocky firmly held, broke and bullet ran up to me. Here is the speed... he nearly knocked me down. It seems too bored. — And to kiss me?! he whispered after I kissed the Butkus in the nose. After I was there with her husband and wound her arms round his neck, while kissing her briefly. It took not much time, and I missed you. Of course, I cheered on the work of such tenderness, but I'm done. A minute later I pulled away from him, and when I saw on the street the man quickly returned to his seat. — Hey, what are you doing?! Rock, there he is again... for a few minutes before you came in... things were said, and said he would wait for me at the pet store until I'm done... — Here's the thing. Don't worry, I'll handle this! Pack your bags just yet, but I just. I promise I'll just talk to you. — Rocky, wait! Wait, stop! ProShow! — tried to stop me. Oh, Yes... and who am I talking to? Husband now just can't stop! He'll kill him now. Quickly taking the jacket, I was about to leave, but noticed that rocky returns. — Adrian, I fixed it! More he won't go near you or to shop closer than a kilometer, he patted me on the cheek — are you ready? Stop hanging out at work. — I-Yes, done! And you, in my opinion, not really. Rock, you're bleeding. Think he'll do the eyebrow cut... have a seat, I'll wipe the blood. I sat down beside him and gently taking him by the chin, was careful to wipe his streaming down his face blood. Yeah, I haven't seen him like this, but I've had worse... I've seen injuries and more serious. Very soon we reached home. So quiet... probably Polly continues to write a story for kid in his room. I heard beginning today at Breakfast, they are rocky so interesting talks that I listened to and almost late for work. What an imagination my boys... Jesus, are we home? I do not believe... I think I overdid it today with dragging heavy bags with food. Who the hell is this morning pulled on my tongue to tell her husband \"I can handle this\"? Last time I was so tired... hell, I've never been so tired. It's so hard... to hide the fatigue from the wild rocky. If he will suspect something, then again start to say that I have to leave work at a pet store. — And we need it? — I asked our beloved dog, who lay down at the stairs, but after a minute ran to call her husband. And while rocky was feeding the Butkus, I barely trudged to our room. Climbing a couple steps, I heard the damn heel on my favorite shoes treacherously cracked and I fell on all fours in the middle of the stairs. — Adrian! the husband quickly ran heard the noise. Laughs... yeah, fun spectacle. It's not every day the wife lying on the stairs... after a few seconds his gaze was concerned. — Are you okay? — All right, just broke my heels... I smiled to hide the truth about what I really hurt. Sure? I can help you up, do you? Although what I ask you? To me it is good for the bicep. Well, I hope — he picked me up and walked quickly to our room. — I think I broke something, said I, when my husband put me on my feet, it hurts! I was told that the wearing of such heels nothing good is not over. And anyway, you look so exhausted like I hadn't noticed before. Come lie down and tell me what you did today at the pet store, even exhausted? In the truest sense of the word! — Well, I... fed the birds, gathered garbage, bags with feed hauled to another location and... — What, what, what? — killed my husband. Those heavy? Crazy? You said that you have no hard work today, when I went to help. I told you that you're a good liar? Well, when I was cheating on you? Just... something not finished. I don't want that between us there was some kind of innuendo. And let us agree: the more you have weights don't lift! And I'd like to revisit the conversation about your work. It seems to me that I now fly other Shoe that was left on your beautiful leg, but I will still say that you deserve more than that... well, I want something to work, please! Only without fanaticism! If you... if you're pregnant, huh? Well, Kaak? — How? Well, you have a husband, we sleep together and we have this happen quite often... Before he could finish, I threw his Shoe. — Quiet, quiet, I keep quiet, will you! Oh, honey, you're in this Shoe at all to the house it came? You have here the heel is about to fall off... — Damn shoes! — throwing a Shoe without a heel to the side, I lay on my bed, but at the same moment raised up. As it fails stood on bruised leg. — So, where are you going? Lie down, I kiss the baby for you. And Yes, I forgot to tell you that you have tomorrow off. OFF, I said. And no \"but\". I'll be right back... Is it morning already?... But with my husband it's easy to lose track of time... seven in the morning. Well, well... now we have to try to get up, and then tightly embraces the same. And once the job is canceled, I'm going to get a run that long planned. The pain in his leg subsided. It seems this is a common injury. I carefully got out of the arms of her husband, dressed up and kissed him, quickly slipped out the door. I hope I will be able to get back before he deigns to Wake up, and I will raise hell. Think that escaped. Butkus saw me at the bottom, immediately started. — Want me to take you? — I sat down in front of him on his haunches, and he barked quite loudly in agreement. — Quieter. After all, are still sleeping. Is this handsome man refuse? He loves to walk and run. Without thinking, we Butkus went out into the yard. And before I could breathe the cool morning air as he ran forward. My God, he's crazy... he's only at rocky and run, but I'm not him! I can't go at this pace. — Butkus, slow down! — I shouted. — I do not have a good speed, like rocky. Hell, where is he pulling me? That, by the same route, which runs husband? No really, my dear friend, I don't want! Okay, let's go. I wonder what people think about us, those people who usually see here rocky, and now see here Mrs. stallion, that is me? And if I notice that tomorrow will emerge in any press article. Some amount of time Butkus rushed forward, until we reached the monument rocky. So that's where they ran... you can see, our dog is well to remember this route. I hope we will go back to its normal pace, and then I will do something that escaped yesterday. I'll break something... Moving the breath, we ran home. Phew, good run around. — Adrian, you are already at this hour? — I heard from her husband when he closed the door. Oh, my God! It's a habit-such to sneak up on you and you frighten me so? — We ran! — Let me know why are you doing this? — Me? Well... need to lose a few pounds. And why are you so afraid of me? I have heart almost jumped, but you still... — A couple? It will be small! he laughed, but stopped short when he caught my indignant look. — Well, I'm sorry! Wait. Did I hear right? You ran with our dog? Truly sorry. — Although running can not be called! I still on your route pulled. In the truest sense of the word. Your companion, I said eyes on the Butkus — I even breathing to give. And anyway, it's all you! Yes. Tied me love to sports and... happy! The most interesting that I like it, and I am ready to share your passion with you. Well, if you want, then tomorrow you will be me! If you have the strength to repeat. You're not weak? You said that I was strong, is enough. And Yes, sharply, the pain came back, help me go upstairs, huh? I'm useful for biceps! — Very cleverly-invented, — he whispered in my ear, when picked up, I had to learn from you, then I would put Kluber in the first round...[Chapter 2] POV Adrian A few days I lived in the same mode. I ran the same route with Butkus, worked until late in the evening at the pet store, and came home feeling like rocky, who returns home with another fight. Forces were not absolutely anything, but to tell my husband that I got a little excited coming to work for the whole day, I decided not to. What am I, suicidal? Today I was walking home alone, I wanted someone who met me... now slowly walked along the path, softly banging his heels and enjoying the solitude, beautiful weather. On the way home, and indeed the entire day I was tormented by bad memories, memories that I still remember with some awe, but with fear. Last fight rocky with Clubber — like a knife in the heart, this series of powerful strokes, the temporary loss of the title, the death of Mickey in the end of it all. But I — the boxer's wife, I have to be strong and to live through something like that. I'm in too deep gone in my head and not even once noticed how the waist fell the strong arms of her husband. My neck was engulfed in his hot breath, and I held her from so close. — I missed you! — he whispered in my ear and nuzzled my hair. — I do not welcome such a fanatical attitude towards work, do you hear? It's like hanging out at work, even though you love animals. I love them, too, but I... honey, you need to have a break sometime, and you're not feeling sorry for myself, look at your palms. This concern was very nice, though I'm not very fond of when I'm in control and patronize. I kind of always was a reasonable man and knew what to do, where to pry and where not necessary. But what to do? Life with rocky is gradually knocked out of me all the crap. Probably for the best... — I also really miss you! turning towards him, I wrapped their hands around his neck, while easily kissed on the lips. Tomorrow I will not have, I plan to just grind this bag, I said eyes on the punching bag, it's all you, Rock. You gave me that love of the sport. By the way... in a swimming pool a couple of three circles. — Well, now to bed, love. — he deftly picked me up in his arms and brought to the house. But really, I had no strength for anything. Dressed, I went to bed and fell asleep almost as soon as his head hit the pillow. Dreams last month overcame a nightmare, and I had no idea what caused all this. Dreamed of the ring, the next fight and lots of blood... immediately after this I woke up with wild cries, and her husband was force-feeding me sedated most of the night. Today was too heavy, apparently I was just not up to remembering yet another nightmare, but it was impossible to miss the fact that the dream was prophetic. Of course, I drove from myself these thoughts, because she knew that her husband only beckoned to the ring, so he is going away, forgetting to consult with my wife. But on the other hand, rocky promised that no Boxing, and I believed, believed in the great hope that we will start a new peaceful life that I dreamed of is actually the day of pregnancy. Then after everything went awry, brother, work, training the husband, anyway... It is not surprising that the forces finally left me, and I was in a coma. I'm afraid to imagine what it felt native. Worried, was on duty at my bed at a time? I saw in a dream reading husband, and maybe it's not a dream? The next morning I went for a run with the dog. For a second I thought to run with me like him even more than her husband. And that, we have developed a new route to the monument, Butkus less tired, but occasionally still pulls me on his usual route. Develop a reflex and nothing more. We ran to the pet store, where I quickly made small work, and then continued running home. Oh, my God, I haven't felt so cheerful as now. At the end of the run when I was in the yard, I noticed my husband and our friend Apollo. To him we were always happy, and his wife Mary Ann, too. We have, as it turned out, many common and not just men boxers in excellent shape. Letting go of Butkus, who immediately jumped into the pool to my boys, and Apollo, I hid in the house where I quickly changed into a more convenient form for hitting a speed bag, which I was kindly taught to use Rock. Today in my garb was shorts mid-length and form-fitting knit tank. Gloves were also necessities. Coming out, I immediately started smashing, just repeating what was taught by the husband. I often catch myself surprised looks of the neighbors, husband, brother, even the famous Apollo creed. — Come on, darling, put this bag of blood! with a grin shouted the man, jumping rope. Damn, and just when he managed to slip past me to change? Keep it up, Mrs. stallion! laughing said our friend and patted me on the shoulder. — I don't want in the ring for a few rounds grind? — Oh, no, my friend! Behold I, even the enemy does not want. You yourself can not imagine that he feels the boxer's wife, when looking at how to get my husband. It's painful, very painful and hard. I f all these strikes together with him all had on me. And now, with your permission, I will continue training. Workout took an hour, maybe even an hour and a half. Well, it's not so little for me, a lowly female nature, loves to spend time usefully. After taking a shower, I made myself a strong tea and was just about to go upstairs to a little rest, but suddenly heard the painfully familiar sounds, the laughter of the son, and Polly didn't hold back from harsh words. They watched the fight. I couldn't bear to watch it, so I retired upstairs, wanting to be alone and in complete silence. He probably overreacted, leaving Boxing, I see well that he did not have enough. Training, views of old records speak for themselves. Well, okay, maybe I'm wrong, maybe it's just paranoia. But I confess, I miss the adrenaline that gets the viewer in the process of viewing. — Mrs stud — again I heard from creed. Hell, what kind of a nickname sort of stuck to me? Chuckling to myself, I went to him, trying to find out why I had abruptly withdrawn from reflection.[Chapter 3] So, what am I? What am I saying? No, no and no! Of course, of course, is paranoia. I'm just tired. And because no sane person wants to live through everything that happened. Must it always be? You're the boxer's wife. Well, answer yourself, stop thinking about it. In the end, in the next room, your family watch the recording of the last match. Forward, Mrs. Balboa, go to them. Go and remember how it hurts. Remember what hell you went through with your loved one. But if I really want to go down this, life with a boxer made me a real masochist. Hard to imagine what it's like rocky... does the fact that her husband will not return to Boxing will torture both of us? I do not want to. Don't want to interfere with us for the rest of your life. Need something to do. And... I am happy that we have a friend like Apollo, who simply will not allow my husband to waste away. And I'm not leaving him. For this I am ready to share with him such an ardent love to sport. Despite the fact that such stress on the body give me the hard. Don't forget that I'm a woman. The weaker sex. But, damn! In all this there is something that I sometimes lack. I quickly realized that such trainings are a kind of hell. Took me literally the morning of the next day. When I decided to try on his standard workout. God... I can clearly underestimated. And if I morally got all these beats with my husband, we have two brain turned into a real mess. But not worth this. I think I called. Stopping in the doorway, I slightly opened his mouth in indignation, but showed no sign that I came, just leaned against the wall and crossed his arms. They are so passionate about that didn't notice that I came to call Apollo. Polly as always used the most appropriate word in the presence of a child and clutching his head, and our boy just silently sat at the table and doodling in your scrapbook. It was very important that there is on TV, why it cries uncle Polly and what's going on. In order to attract attention to his person, I coughed into a fist, but remained standing there, with crossed arms. No reactions at all? Oh, so? Well, okay. Then I'll go. To me only ran Butkus, who complained he barked at the others. — And do not say, no attention. But still thank you, big guy. I owe you, ' I patted him and landed on his haunches, wrapped his arms around. What a glorious and strange dog. Went to owners. Super boxer and pet store employee, as another said rocky, silly and shy. Yeah, we definitely are made for each other. Rising to my feet, I stopped right behind her husband and put his hands on his shoulders. Slightly leaning, whispering to him that this is my place, I re-straightened. Yes, indeed. I loved this chair and the room. Here I can be alone with yourself, to put in order thoughts when it is hard for me to cry. I'm quite a private person and no one never share their feelings. Except that sometimes. And anyway, strong women also cry. — Well, boys, what do you want? You need something to bring? Towel, water, co-o-o-Fe, beer, maybe, uh, Polly? I will consider any suggestions. — Forget it. And just come here. You disappeared somewhere, and I would like you to stay with me. This is my last fight. I want you to remember and be proud of. Come on, Adrian, have a seat. Of course I wanted to indulge in all this, but in one second everything changed, and I would give anything if only not to see it. I've been looking for excuses until rocky pulled my hand onto his lap. Great. Just fine. To slip out of this grasp is not so easy. Now I just can't go anywhere. Hell, turn it off. I didn't have enough to contemplate how he was beaten in the ring, so now he forced me to watch the replay. And once I went to this conversation, then I remember. I remember, I'm proud and I have great respect for him. Why such complexity? Well, at least Polly somewhere departed, taking the baby, so not to be ashamed of emotions. Married to a boxer and be kind appropriate. And it's not him, but for me, I need to change. And he is a boxer. That's who I am. I fell in love with. Although it is unlikely that we can change ourselves. — Well, admit it, Adrian, you love it! — said Apollo, surprised at my reaction to experienced long-missing husband blows. Yes, I still squinted, covered his face with his hands, but I have to admit, it was a beautiful match. — E-GE-gay. It's all over, you can open your eyes. — Torture. It's just torture. By God, would once at your sly face, but I'm afraid that such a knockout will embarrass you to the whole staff. Don't you ever call me to view such things. Boys, this is masochism. Rock, let it go. If you wanted to cheer me up, I found not the best way. Better your jokes about a cow and a bell. Look, Apollo... and Mary Ann is also reviewing the records of your fights? — Yes, of course! Says something in this box is. Looks, of course, without such an interest, as we are with the stallion, but before the end. — We're women — I reminded, trying in vain to get out of the arms of rocky, fragile, weak, vulnerable women. But... I had promised something. And so, the Rock as soon as you are going to include match — call. Will make the company, I promise. — Not a question. And you, when you will inhabit this fragile, weak and vulnerable, tell her that my nose was already broken, easy night. — Admit that you'd be proud of me, if I would have broken his nose super boxer? You see... so don't be such a spoilsport. For intimate conversations with our friend, playing with my son and some household chores I didn't notice how began to grow dark. It's weird, but I'm not that tired, although the day still the same. After my small injury, rocky has forbidden me to work and not leave me a single step. But going for a run, I come the shortest way to the pet store and quickly did part of their work, because Gloria do not cope alone. So weird. Again, I work part time. I can't do anything else, and it's the only way to somehow diversify his life. But I did not put work ahead of everything else, just as the man box. The family is sacred, and I most of the time spent with family. Now while I was going for a walk, rocky went to put the baby. And he was surprised when I was asked to wait outside the door so I could change. Even for me myself, this request was very strange, in fact, what he's seen? And still something forced me to push him out the door. I must sometimes be the same, completely forgetting the fact that we are married. Much digging, I did not, and the closet I got was not something special in order to dig in it for hours. Today I settled on black trousers and a grey blouse with no sleeves, and since we had not planned today, usual walk, I grabbed a dark cream and a light jacket. Although it was not so easy as it seemed to her husband. By the way, I almost never wear makeup, but for some reason today I really wanted this. And it is not bright, only to hide some flaws. On the one hand, who sees me? And on the other... because it is Necessary to start sometime. Spreading hairs homemade bun and combing them, I change to more comfortable shoes and smiled at his reflection. For a long time I feel, sorry that this is only temporary. After a few minutes I looked to my boys and one of them already was in a deep sleep. They again made me smile. Kissed his son on the forehead, I took husband by the hand and we went downstairs, where he found the slumbering Polly. Well, we decided not to Wake him, just quietly left. I again strangely felt, as usual, unable to really breathe in this cool air, I run for the Butkus. From cold I shivered slightly, and still wearing the jacket, brushing the hair back. My eyes were already burning with excitement. Yeah, patted me life with rocky... In the best sense of the word. — Adrian, you're starting to worry me. — In terms of? What do you mean? — I blankly blinked, buttoning a zipper on a jacket to the middle. — What about \"rocky, I'm not getting on that thing, you're killing me!\"? He smiled slightly, handing me a motorcycle helmet. Wow, what a memory. And most importantly, with exactly the same intonation. That this stallion currently allows? — Come on, get in! I promise, you'll love it. And don't forget the helmet, although it is unlikely you will save, if we have somewhere to move. Thank you, rocky, you know how to calm my fears. I rolled my eyes. Not really I liked it when he mimics me, but I really did not mind having to ride the city at night. Well, let's see what our friend in this time of day. Wearing a helmet, I sat in the back as close as possible, and rocky asked me to hold onto it for a little stronger for my own safety. What could happen? Just think, he got that mad speed only for a couple seconds. The romance... One bike, two crazy, obsessed with sports and high speed. It's so weird and scary, rocky did not reduce speed on turns. Yes, I was right, he would kill, he'll kill us both. I wonder where are we going and why so fast? At some point, the speed increased and everything would be fine, but my husband was driving, not paying even the slightest attention to the bumps and potholes on the road. And when I was completely fucked up, I literally yelled his name like he's regained some powerful blow. Now I understand his request and I grabbed him even tighter. And... Those muscles will ever drive me crazy. Unfortunately, it's not just me. — Damn it, do not accelerate! Can you hear... — Are you scared? I don't believe it! It was in truth terrible, so much so that I didn't utter a sound. And I think my husband sensed it, the speed was sballen, but still to focus on anything was difficult. These billboards, trees and houses too quickly gone from sight. Remember, he wanted to show me a place that is considered ideal for calming. Told how he spent hours standing there after the funeral, Mika, and I was worried that it is taking so long at home. While there, we were going through the familiar byways, and it's two options: the my pet store and the gym or he just decided to make a big circle, which I personally doubt. But I have confidence in him once again sitting on this thing, and maybe in the morning, when my body starts to ache from the pain, because for a long time to be in this position almost impossible, I curse this day. I'm somehow not on itself, and I sincerely hoped that nothing goes wrong. Now my husband said something to me, but I heard almost nothing, so I answered all his phrases in monosyllables, and later thought of. I wonder what or what I just agreed? Joint jog? Training with a sparring partner in his face? On dismissal from a pet store? Well, we'll see. I'm always right. We were really close to my place of work, and I doubt that rocky showed interest in my case at this moment, though never missed this option. How can I know that he has in mind, which tried many times to turn to mush? Exactly... the pet store without the slightest attracted to. And the place is completely empty, not a soul except us. I cherish these moments and love our walks under the moon, as before, when rocky was Boxing, not for ourselves, we rarely indulged in such. I'm just sympathetic to his failures, because he was very exhausted by the workouts and thought only about the upcoming matches. And I can not impose. Is that just their support. We stood a little longer, and then he still took me where they had planned. And at that speed it domchal me less than ten minutes. Weird... It's just a bridge, and at the bottom something like a railway. What might this place be like? ... Gloomy and cold and scary. But soon it became very windy and rocky even gave me his jacket, we had to go home and in the yard, he showered me with his trademark jokes and couldn't resist the irony. My hair rocky is also appreciated. Because of the strong wind my hair's a mess, and after I removed the helmet, he immediately burst into laughter. Just look at him. Nervously after blowing a strand of hair which kept getting in my eyes, I closed the distance between us, and had already threatened to strike, began to doubt that he will put the block. — Hush, hush, I was kidding. Calm down, keep your hook out of the bag. Let's go inside. You need to rest, you have a big day tomorrow. What is he doing? Well, in the morning every secret will be revealed, and today I don't want to find out. Today's walk was a little out of me, and while rocky was walking our husky, I gave myself to the divine and the most suitable for sleep. I fell asleep very quickly, almost immediately as my head hit the pillow, hoping that the night will be calm.[Chapter 4] Suddenly I saw a husband. Next was a bunch of people. But his face looked different, as always, his face was covered in blood, large hematomas, even the left eyebrow was cut, and if someone told me that it's rocky, there's no way I won't believe it, although after his first fight with Clubber, I haven't seen before. He gave me a kiss on the cheek and disappeared into the crowd. I slightly looked down, seeing his eyes, and then it dawned on me... I'm on the next rematch. Why he brought me here? Oh Yes, it is important for him of my presence. But I can't watch because I was watching earlier, then it was not so painful, and now... What happened? He barely keeps his hands to protect himself. Well, maybe it's my rocky? I might punch better... Where is your courage? — Fight Rocky! Please-Ah... — I cried, voice breaking, — rocky... — I told you, sister, told you to leave him alone. Now it will erase in a powder, just destroyed in that ring, and you're to blame. Look, look what you made him. You're ruining everything. A little more and he will become a loser. — What about? I demolish? What are you talking about? What is my fault? Tell me, what is? What the hell are you blaming me? I just wanted to protect him, because all these attacks will make him a cripple. The damn bastard. Stop this insanity. Hey. Well, at least someone hear me and stop it. You can do it. Apollo, well, this, he drinks so much beer that there is from the brain hardly anything left, but you're a reasonable person. Stop the fight. Drop the towel, drop it, that's pure suicide. Stop the fight! Please... beg-I-I-Yu! — I cried in a frenzy, literally sobbing from the pain and an unbearable feeling of loss. And suddenly I felt someone shaking his shoulders, and I woke up from it, immediately throwing himself into the arms of her husband. — Lord... — You were yelling in your sleep. Nightmares again? Again the ring? Adrian?! I began the real hysterics, and I did not respond to his requests, but only sobbed on his chest, snuggling harder. He hugged me tight, whispering something soothing, and after a while I felt better, hysterical sobs ceased, he heard only so-quiet sob. Removing me from myself, rocky gently stroked my cheek and told me to wait for him here. I nodded and wiped his eyes with tears. What a nightmare. I hope I have no one but rocky didn't. When he came back, handed me a glass, telling to completely drain it, and when I'm completely calm down, to tell him what scared me so much. I did just that. After rocky had concluded that I'm obsessed with their fears, and they won't leave me even in sleep. He is always sensitive to the maltreatment Polly with me, and said that will never allow him to say these things to me in reality. He managed to talk me with your stories, and I even fell asleep and the last thing I felt his kiss to the corner of the lips. I woke up when the clock showed almost seven hours, and I have long wandered in the yard, trying to understand what this is all about, but to any reasonable conclusion we Butkus, who kept me company, did not come, but painful memories I soaked off. — What, hide and seek playing with me? — whispered in my ear my husband, hugging my waist. He appeared so suddenly that I flinched. — Good morning. — Good ... and ... uh... the Butkus for a run going. And I thought. — For a run? — For a run. — In a Bathrobe and Slippers? Look, I think he is a bit short, isn't it? Okay, go get changed, I'll wait for you. What do you mean, why? I thought you will accompany me, I am also going to run. — You... you're crazy, right? I know your speed, I tried for you to the jail. — But you're going to do our best, right? Oh, yeah, honey, that's exactly what I want at seven o'clock in the morning. And me who just pulled the tongue? Although... why not? I hurried into the house, almost tripping over the dog, who immediately ran behind me and as luck would have climbed under his feet. He was so excited. It can be understood. Quickly find in the wardrobe of his robes to run and workout, dressed and gathered the hair in a ponytail, so as not to interfere, I'm pinned to the collar of the Butkus leash, and then looked into the room of the baby. He was still asleep, and this means that we and rocky will have time to come back and make Breakfast before he wakes up. The dog has already dragged me outside to our champion, and rocky by that time, even warmed up a bit. — Well, big guy, as you know, you're bored of running on the new route with mommy? Honey, are you sure you don't need a warm-up, and are you ready? More than. — Mmm, okay. Butkus, follow me! For me, big guy. — Oh, no! No no no! I was joking, rocky Ro-Oh-Oh-TCG! This dog went crazy just like his master. The first time we ran together and I really enjoyed it, but I knew that this speed is not for rocky. This stallion had the audacity again to hasten our dog and accelerated. Crazy. He definitely set a goal to ditch me. Butkus are now just dump me. He wanted to catch up with rocky, but since his holding I almost never have time for him, it was difficult to do. He fairly jerked, thereby pulling the leash out of my hands. Probably a good thing it is still early and the streets are absolutely empty. I don't have time to catch the leash, the dog darted for her husband, and I accelerated, and I will kill him someday, I swear. Of course, if I don't give my soul to God, when he reached the monument. We often ran and, of course, I don't have the speed, like rocky, but also something that can, and I almost never lagged until I felt it was time for me to catch my breath. You can't do that now. We're almost there. Don't be so spineless, you're a boxer's wife. Steps. What beautiful stairs, I see them. I like it... This is already there. I think I can't feel my legs. God... When at last remaining distance has been covered by me, I exhaled. — Butkus, it seems that our mother is not good. — Not good? — I was indignant to catch my breath. — Yes, I almost did not spit out the lungs. I think they added a couple of steps. Phew-phew. — Time to go home on your route? You can do it, my lady? — WH ... what you want me to ... but no matter. Butkus, forward. Let's show this stud who who. Taking the leash again, and noticed that her husband was distracted, I rushed forward, hurrying up the dog. Rocky is no longer accelerated, and our run ended in my speed, but I still felt the devil's fatigue. After I took a shower and later decided to sit, and then do the Breakfast, I went into the living room. I feel this is just the beginning. What's he up to? Hope, shower it too cool, and he'll leave me alone for today. Somehow decoylab to the couch, I landed on him and stretched out his legs on the coffee table. A little more and I would have definitely fell into the realm of Morpheus, but my husband's voice made me open my eyes. Five minutes to dress up, relax and in the pool. You don't have to worry about Breakfast. Baby bedtime stated that it would be cereal. What, you don't want in the pool? Hmm, then get gloves and a band-aid. And legs probably too. — Someone promised to be my sparring partner. Remember? — Do you want to be destroyed? It was a joke. Come on, get up. — Ro-o-K-K-I. Please, not today. I understand what this is all about, and thank you. All right. I'm in the pool a couple of circles, and you're taking me to the pet store. Suddenly, to my throat came the nausea, and I had quickly removed, leaving a rocky one. But not for long. Very soon I heard his steps outside the door. I think I managed to scare him. Now I felt disgusted and went out and was just about to answer his question, but the ceiling had changed places with the floor, a good rocky managed to catch me. He carried me into the room and anxiously looked at me. — So, let me get up. I'm fine, just a little dizzy. — All. Today you finish work at a pet store and these your workout. Don't even ask me about it. If suddenly again there will be any complications? Adrian then was unbearable. And I'm sorry. I had it all to provide. Now we'll go to the doctor. Suddenly you're still pregnant. Don't look at me like that. Okay, okay. Will go later. — Well, your training has not been canceled. Go. Go, rocky, I'll do the Breakfast. I tried to get up but he stopped me, forcing again to lie down. I definitely can not hurt, and was worth one visit in a coma, and now you can take under such strict guardianship. This, of course, nice, but this is too much... Or are you lying now, or I put you in my own way. — Raise your hand to me? I wondered, quietly chobotov. — Out of your mind? I wanted to give you a sedative. Then I remembered that I promised Gloria to go to work closer to lunch, and I was impossible to fall asleep using sleeping pills. The sense of duty and responsibility ever ruin me. But a suicide I didn't sign up, so rocky about it does not necessarily know. He has long's apology and encouraged. An ideal husband, and it is not his fault. Perhaps all this is just from restless nights and I need to sleep. The last thing I felt as his hands lovingly covered me with a blanket. I slept until noon and felt that I really got better. And anyway, today I have to run. It is important not to catch the eye of rocky and the baby. Leaving the bedroom, holding shoes in hand, that didn't give me heels, I snuck past her son's room where I heard my husband's voice, it explained why I missed lunch with them, why not go out of his room today, and I was already headed down the stairs, but suddenly someone touched my hand, what I slightly screamed. — Butkus. Well, did you scare me, big man! — I squatted and patted his hair, to which he loudly barked. — I have to go. TS-TS-TS, I quickly came down, abuses, walked out the door. I didn't expect the heels to run not so easy, and I almost tripped, but still punctuality I have. Rocky is gonna kill me. I hope he will have a good mood when he comes to meet me. — You're acting strange today, even a little pale. Just cope alone? said Gloria, going home. — Living with a boxer was so interesting? He's got you hooked on the sport? — Oh, Yes. You don't even know how right you are. The most interesting thing I get from all this is tremendous fun, even ashamed in that him to confess. Happy. Well. I left. And you start with those boxes with food. His eyes followed her and a sigh, I began unpacking the contents of the box. One contagious song and spun in the language and it's probably good that the store was empty. I told that is better to sing differently. That's good. Rocky... can the same time and effectively appear. — Tell me, why do I have this? Do you really like it? You're worth more than that... it is not necessary to devote yourself to this place, look at yourself, you're sick, Adrian, you need to rest. I know this is useless, but after a few hours I'll take you home. The kid will also be pleased that you will be home earlier than usual. And while we spend time together. You do something to help? Don't say \"no\". I find it easier to peretaskat heavy bags than you back problems then we just need. Let me show you where to drag. Don't worry, Polly took the baby while I'm with you. I have no doubt that you would be here. I hope no moron to you here will no longer go, not rude, and nowhere is declining? — Comes, of course. And I wouldn't call him a scumbag. On the contrary, this type is really cute... strong... and his trademark jokes. A-Ah... And he declines. We have it by mutual consent. And I'm happy that this type of my husband... Well, seriously, anyone suspicious I have not seen. What? — I wound her arms round his neck. Well, I need to be, right? One on hand I generally will rise if anything? And you have time. Rocky helped me with the rest of the bags gave a kiss and left. Yes, and I was not bored. Almost to the end of my work day the store was filled with people, some bought pet feed and so on, and someone is just not resolved on this, however for one young man I found the right words. and he took with him two small turtles. To be more precise, I told him some history of our own with rocky. Our babies and the big man would also love food and new toys, but today I didn't want to do it, because you'd have to carry it all not at close distance. Husband it is unlikely that today she would meet me, if his exhausted son. And bag today I haven't brought any, so that there bag, I jumped out without a jacket. And for good reason. Lately the nights are so cold. Latest young girl left the walls of the pet shop near seven hours, and I also began to gather home, but rather while I was waiting for rocky. It became colder, and I shivered. At the gym leaning on the car, watched a small company of men, and they soon headed toward me. Moms. I was also a little crazy, so now these... rocky, honey, where are you? — Lady, don't want to come with us? We promise to sweeten your evening leisure. From afar it seemed to us that miss you. — And you... you don't want health problems? Leave me alone for good. — With character. Believe me, lady, we'll take you all the insolence. At the same moment I was pressed against the wall with such force that even a very palpable hit his shoulder blade. Now it will be a big bruise. — And my husband will beat you the last teeth and brains. Although, on a second I got excited. Let me through or I'll start screaming. — Calm down, buddy, it seems to be the wife Balboa aloud said one of them, — the hell-is it us? — Thank God at least one good head. Felt, rest of mind God gave. But it didn't stop it. He just smiled, said that he doesn't care whose, I wife, and grabbed me by the neck, squeezing it out so I coughed. So hard, but I struggled to hold back her tears, but at some point they are so treacherous gushed from his eyes, and began to breathe even harder. I was released only when the entire street heard the noise from our bike. Of course, rocky didn't see it all, but he quickly came to the desired conclusion. Kissing me, giving me his jacket and telling to turn away, rocky decided to deal with them differently. — Of course, it can't cope with three people, but one of you definitely not be good. You guys would have pity on his friend and... I really said it, turning away and crossing her arms. And yet we will never be able to solve problems in a civilized way, without using muscles. In General, I was pleased. Except it for me, no one ever stood up, even my brother. From that scoundrel of words of gratitude-it is almost not heard, and rocky the complete opposite. And now I was really scared to turn around to look at what is happening, but brute, I was already turned around, but his hands appeared on my shoulders, made me linger. But not for long. — I think I already said that will not allow anyone to hurt you. And so it is with everyone. We will return to this story at night and is home now. He corrected me on his jacket and handed a motorcycle helmet. Seconds hesitation and wearing a helmet, I sat back and as always, hold fast to him. Well busy same day...[Chapter 5] We came home when it was dark now and, frankly, I was very hungry, but I hardly have energy left to cook dinner. My happiness and surprise dinner was ready, and after eating we finally spent time together as a family. Watching cartoons before bed too tired baby, and he fell asleep. All this, of course, wonderful, but I felt that my husband and I both are tired of the routine. Well, need to move him to the room and rocky was ahead of me with this, giving my hands the TV remote. Now for some reason I remembered my dream, and today I just drink before sleep the sleeping pills, because another night like that I simply will not survive. Quickly cleaned up, taking from the chest the pill and pouring water, I went up to our room and left the glass on the nightstand. Then I stood at the mirror, trying to consider the consequences of hitting the wall. Well, a bruise. So I had arranged, a little touch me — you will immediately see the trail, and this guy pushed me with such force that a bruise for a month did not come. Well at least mark on the neck is not as noticeable, I can easily mask it with some beads. — Anything-about yourself. Where are you managed? I turned and saw rocky, but he quickly launched his back to me, I didn't have time to answer him. — These bastards have to do something? — Choose, please, expressions. No. I... I... myself. I was down to take a little food, but the stairs were a bit slippery so I... But I'm not hurt. Nonsense. And for the neck something strange. I just do not see? Everything else seems intact, said the husband, holding my chin, teeth doing his thing. With them, I'll handle this her way, but later. Today, I see you made the right decision. Sleeping pill is exactly what you need now. You're so tired, you should sleep. You don't have to dwell on their fears. By the way, I forgot to say, tomorrow arrives Tony, get in touch with Gloria and take the day off. — I think it's too much. I'll be home by noon. When exactly will it arrive? In the second half of the day. — See, I can kill several birds with one stone: I'll help Gloria at the pet store and then cook something tasty at home. Please note that I will have time to practice, and maybe tomorrow I regret to say, but... Tomorrow you can do whatever you want to me. But please, in the aisles reasonable. Don't forget that I'm a woman. Fragile, weak, defenseless woman. Okay. You talked me into it. No work. Only fresh air and exercise. But for an hour I go there just look. A little warped and giving my blessed a kiss, I washed down the pill with water and dived under the covers. Some ten minutes and I already didn't understand everything he tells me, but I felt like my neck splash hot breath, and his hands are on my waist, holding me to him. The morning began with the barking of Butkus. He raised us with rocky on his feet in area eight in the morning. He was accustomed to Jogging and, most likely, hinted at the fact that the time has come. To be precise, the fully awakened just me. Rocky just chuckled and patted me on the shoulder, clearly hinting that tonight he's with it will not run. Well, I'm sure to remember my Italian stallion. Panov him in the side, I got out of bed, stretching and yawning. Bringing himself into a more awake appearance, dressed in a comfortable Jogging and work clothes, I called the dog over. But we ran our usual route, although at first he pulled me in the direction I with great difficulty managed to stop him. The destination for today — the pet store. Yes, that's the one where I took it away. It seems that Gloria is already there. Strangely, her time today in the afternoon. — Good morning. What's wrong with you? You've come too early. Want to trade? You see, you're not alone. Hey, big guy. — I'm glad to see you, Gloria. Honestly, I would like to warn you, I won't be here for another few days. I don't feel well, and rocky is going through. A sense of duty and responsibility has brought me here, I'll help you now while he's still not awake. — That yesterday you were kind of weird. Look, Adrian, you would go along with the Butkus home. The Rock knows that you're here, both a good thrashing will register. I can handle it. And thanks for the help with the store. Since the day you came back here, it's even somehow revived or something. — I'm glad to be useful at least somewhere. I can't do anything else, and constantly in the four walls... it's not for me. I think somewhere deep down, rocky gets it but somehow always says the same thing. He himself is engaged in advertising and wants to prove that it does not pull on the ring. Don't know, I wouldn't return, and that he is not dead, share his interest. Maybe my body is just not used to such physical activity. Still, I'm not a boxer but a simple woman. Well, you really don't need my help, I will go. The damn pills. From them was a crack head, but thanks to the dog who is not used to the quiet and peaceful walks, I got a much needed boost and set a new record. Ten minutes. Ten. The usual step is much longer. Half an hour to an hour. The wall clock showed ten o'clock, and all members of our family has already had Breakfast. Appetite absolutely was not, and I decided to replace Breakfast swimming in a big hope that rocky does not come in the yard, in order to control how fast I do it, correct me breathless, and then be sure to follow the reproach that it is not the most appropriate clothing for swimming. Not once recall the neighbors, who will definitely be staring at me. Somehow today angered me the most is this. I even stopped and came up to him, leaning on pristupom. And it tells me the man who washes his car shirtless, who's staring crowd of women and simply undresses eyes. Although, there has to remove there is nothing. And I'm not talking about the fact that they brazenly hang on your neck and ask permission for a kiss on the cheek. — Adrian, what kind of conversations? You have to go for the gusto my tongue. And in General, stop the chatter, work. Five more times. And faster. Chats she comes up with all sorts of nonsense. Come on. — Mom is preparing for the match-revenge for you? — was heard from the baby. Rocky picked him up. — Yes, perhaps. Honey, do you mind sparring? — What about? Want me to completely ruin? I then made a joke, and I think I was talking about training in the aisles reasonable, but not about what our creed arranged. And don't distract me with your chatter, better bring me a towel. I'll make something if Tony will come earlier than promised, and then you will help me to wear gloves. Ten minutes left for drying hair, dressing up, and then I finally ended up in the kitchen thinking what to cook, but afraid that I will not do it, I called and called for help, Mary Ann. Together, we managed for a few hours and then she drove off about his business, saying that more will come and something will talk to me, talk about something important. Very interesting. So that's that, and intrigue this person knows. Must say that lately she's been acting really weird, like her worried about something. And Apollo we have not visited for a few days. I'm starting to miss his nickname for me in this house no-one calls. Unless my husband, but not often. Well, okay, I'll stay out of their relationship and family, I would be in their to restore order. All the things we don't like people. And I caught myself thinking that I too often change. What can I do? If you could train in a housecoat if this sport was not. Shorts and tight tank top — exactly what I was comfortable to do. Having kissed the baby, who was engaged in painting in the living room, I went out into the yard. After all, what is a good home. And no hall is not needed. Something here has already been arranged. I don't really know how to jump on the rope and didn't understand why should I need it. It had rocky, this exercise affected the impact, and speeds, at the same time strengthens the muscles of the legs. Well, if I must, I must. My job is to dutifully perform the task, since I volunteered last night. And pulled me for the language. I called rocky almost as soon as I started jumping. He landed near me and began to observe. I have long worked, and as soon as I was able to increase speed, legs treacherously intertwined with a rope. Hell. — Take your time. Everything works, just needs time. Let me show you once more. he took from my hands the rope and again started to do it. Damn, those jumps are like hypnosis. After a minute, rocky with crashing, dropped it on the floor. — Almost gets crushed. I asked you to go away, you know to be during this at close range is unsafe. Another half hour and then work on your punches right. Start with ten jumps. Although... for you it's damn hard, and don't have to pretend I'm not blind. Screw the rope. Bring gloves. In recent times you were waiting for some shady types, it would be nice if you can stand up for myself if suddenly I will not be next. And what I like. I asked the little boy to bring me gloves from the dresser, and then, rocky helped me get them on. They are so uncomfortable to do anything. But I loved to thresh this bag, it calmed him down and distracted me. Now he was holding my left hand so I didn't try to beat it. I want to beat the other hand. What are you looking at me? Maybe I'm this... whatever... a southerner. — Well, try. You know what I always say Mickey? He will break it for me. Somehow, this made me laugh. I fucking missed Mickey... his death is very painful impact on all of us. But later my left arm was free, and my husband long admired the fact that I know how to growl. What's the big deal? Oh, these boxers how many interesting things can be noted in the normal beating of the pear. Looks like I got carried away, just do not notice how in our yard a car came out of creed. Apollo brought Tony, who haven't decided where to stop. Behind them was Mary Ann, tall tsokaya heels on the pavement. Favorite nickname and applause. — What the hell is this? — Tony's eyes suddenly widened. Of course I have changed since our last meeting. — That's my girl! Rocky hung on my shoulder towel, making it clear that it was time to finish. After a vain attempt to remove hair from the face, I gave guests a friendly smile. But Mary Ann still bothered me and I knew that she wanted something to tell me. Getting rid of the gloves, I wanted to go into the house, but a female voice stopped me. We need to talk. Let's take a walk! The conversation that neither is confidential. I nodded in agreement, apologized to all, and departed with Mrs. creed. Five minutes or seven we walked in complete silence until she decided to speak first. Just starting it a little too far away. — Tell, please, and Apollo came to you in the last two days? I don't know it the night before, stayed out all night, and yesterday came almost at midnight. Constantly withdraws to some common cause with rocky, but what can be the case at this time? You have a small child. Or is he not lying? Adrian, please tell me the truth. — Dark something your creed. Just... just last night my rocky had a late night out, and yesterday some thugs to scare me began at the store, he met me and then we almost immediately went to sleep. Well, you don't get worked up, maybe something happened, he solves the problem, and you decided not to get involved? — Maybe he just found someone else? If so, it is very painful. Because we have children... I think she even sobbed. But I refused to believe that Apollo could do with it, perhaps I should talk to him. Although, I'm not one of those who climbs into other people's privacy. Of course, if I'd ask. — Yes, it's all foolishness. All you will definitely get better. Now let's go back to the house. And tomorrow, if you want to go through the shops. In life many things are happening, we need to unwind. Come on.[Chapter 6] Until the evening, Mary Anne was so unlike me, I watched her, noticing how she eschews a spouse, unfortunately, I didn't know how to help her, and to speak with Apollo decided tomorrow morning when he will come to us for training. If you will come. We have them couple to the car, and Tony stayed with us. Somehow, I didn't want to share their experiences with rocky, and then I promised to be silent. But strange as my husband noticed, he gave me a hug the waist from behind, resting his chin on his shoulder. I hate it when he does it in such moments I start to forget about everything. — Honey, I've been watching you all day today, and I'm worried about you. You said something to Polly? I go and punch him in kindred? By the way, where he... — No, no, Polly has absolutely nothing to do with it. Just today was a hard day. I'm tired. Very tired, I'm going to sleep early tonight. — I already knew that you're good at lying and now the truth. Okay, the poll has nothing to do with anything, but that's up to your conversation with Mary Anne, you're even smiling, despite the fact that I squeezed you dry of this training. What are you talking about? Tell me you'll feel better. Well, you want me to cheer? Do you remember why the cow bell? Yes, Yes... because her horns are worthless. Rock, I turned to face him, smiled through all its thirty two. So that's that, and to hide the experiences behind a smile I've learned. — All right. We just decided to go shopping tomorrow. It's cold, let's go inside. I pulled free from his embrace drove home our beloved dog, and then went to brew a fresh pot of coffee. The kid was already asleep, Polly, too, disappeared, with me just our guest and husband. They were discussing something, and I didn't follow why I need other people's conversations? Moreover, judging by the gestures, they discuss Boxing and this was a sore subject, well, if you take the fact that he is still talking about working in a pet store. How he misses the ring. But nothing. It will pass. In the end, it's time to give way to young guys. — Mrs. Balboa... I am Tony. — Adrian. You can just Adrian! And you were, and that to me kind of awkward. Must say I was quite surprised finding you in the afternoon for this exciting activity. Remember, you difficult given the presence in the training and... even participate in all this madness... Or who will lead? — And you about it. I just share with my husband his interest, what's unusual about that? Don't understand. And you surely noticed, I've been watching it all that was involved. By the way, it helps me be in shape, I sometimes forget about her figure. It is better to let it exhaust me, rather than turns your head to mush. And I now need it for self defense. I work, at least the Rock against. Maybe he was ashamed that his wife once again came back to where he started, but I can't do anything else and I really want to work. But don't worry about it. The area of the pet shop is not the most calm, and rocky can't be always be there to protect me from any noobs. And a lot of them. That's where a lot of them. Glued that bow to something, though, and I know who I am. My face often lights up in the Newspapers a couple of times I even took off rocky for the cover, well... not for anybody not a secret that I Balboa! And it is even weird... weird that I pay attention to these guys. I'm sort of not particularly good with beauty, a perfect figure, a wardrobe, and was wondering why the hell I needed someone, but everything turned out differently... bolted to the wall so that still back went out. Aw... I stopped short, catching his glance rocky. On the last sentence for some reason I turned to them, although I stood back, watching the cooking. I was hoping that he did not give my words a special value, I poured the coffee pots and put the Cup in front of Tony and spouse. Pouring a bit of this invigorating drink and myself, I sat across from them, smiling from ear to ear. He really seems to not understand or just do not want to chastise me in public. In any case, now he is silent. We exchanged the latest news, Tony even mentioned that I should think about a Boxing match, and my pious act as a coach. Of course, this is just a joke. At some point he even reminded me of Mickey. Later we gave our friend in one of the rooms, or rather I did, and rocky went into the shower, sending to hell the delicacy. Apparently, he was a shower more than me, since he slammed the bathroom door right before my nose. But after fifteen minutes the turn to me, and I don't know what they were discussing while I was gone, but when I came out, drying the hair with a towel in the house was already quiet, it seems, they finished and left. I quietly went into the room and really did not have time even to close the door, as were pressed to the wall, the husband literally loomed over me, enveloping my neck hot breath, both hands leaning against the wall, he probably wanted me to finally feel cornered. Again, a very palpable hit, I'm a little twisting, and then tried to escape, but rocky gently took me by the shoulders, denying this possibility. Just look at the guy. — Not only that didn't let me into the shower ahead of him, so still... — Well I'm offered to go with me, but you refused. Believe me, I would be very careful with your back, — he grinned, giving me a kiss on the neck. Really? Oh... and don't boxers from the women's legs ever get tired? What are you, really? It's you I begin to disturb, Rock. Do not... not... well, we have an in house guest and... it is ugly... we'll Wake the baby. Better see what's on the back, a large bruise? — Since last night nothing has changed. And I did not understand a bit, you bolted to the wall or you're in the store, getting food, crashed? Yes... you scored! Painful, slammed, if you want to know. You're so yesterday, gutted them, and if else to know about it... I decided to hold back... okay, enough, go to sleep. And forget about them! Just think, he was waiting for me, already had. And more than once. I'm even glad it did, whatever I said earlier. In this many advantages. Well, I guess. If I'm still stick, so I'm still... not such a dried apricot on a background with younger girls. The same ones who ask you for permission to kiss on the cheek. I do not know there is reason for jealousy. What do you think, should I be jealous of him, huh? Although, I think I'm worse though over two times. Thirty-three... a good age, right? Not for professional sports, of course, but I don't have to. — Beautiful! The most beautiful age and not invent tales, there are no girls. Off his shoulders with his hands, I took off my robe and approached the mirror, trying to examine the bruise, and there's really nothing had changed. If this track don't touch, it actually will not make themselves known, but it is unlikely I will succeed, because of work, training and my husband is not going anywhere. It's hard to resist, and I had no idea how he manages so deftly to turn my mind. I hate him for it! We fell asleep pretty quickly and I didn't even drink the night sleeping pills, hoping that it will not be needed. But it was very silly of me, it was silly not to foresee that the nightmares plaguing me in that day, will not make themselves felt today. I woke up as soon as I saw the bloodied face of a spouse and put their hands in the hair. Well, as you can? Is seen on the ring sight will now bother me for the rest of your life? Sighing, I kissed rocky on the cheek and settled next, soon feeling his hands on your waist. — I thought you took a sleeping pill... — I no longer need. I was assured that you need to get rid of fears, and she was using pills. Enough. — PA-a-a-p! — was heard from the baby, who ran to our room. He made us instantly to awaken. — You told me the tale until the end. Went-I. Rocky stifled a yawn and took a sitting position, trying to cheer up a bit. — Oh, you read the baby stories. And I you last read when I was six months pregnant. It is somehow ugly, aren't you, baby? — Yes! — Ugly! — I repeated, playfully clasping his neck with his elbow. — You're going to read our little book, eh? You read well! — And you're good at lying. And someone definitely had less lying in a coma. I read, among other things. And you use prohibited methods. Well, I'm below the belt you don't beat down not sent. Why not just do it for the sake of the baby at two in the morning. After seeing their eyes, I sank down on the pillow, thinking can be really worth to drink for the night sleeping pills? Quickly coming to the desired conclusion, I washed down the pill with water and after ten minutes were sound asleep, completely without thinking. Butkus woke us up with rocky in the morning around ten o'clock, and, judging by the fact that my husband had not planned to go up, it means that run with him will have me again. My nice little doggie. He heard the snoring. What? He fell asleep again or especially pretending to not running with Butkus. But in any case, I have to get up and make Breakfast to feed all the men of this house. I was very confused by the bandura, which stood on my side, she simply does not give me the opportunity to get out of bed. And even now. How interesting for me to climb over him so as not to Wake? Although he is so soundly asleep that not even feel. Hell, if not today, they pushed this thing back, I could do it. Reaching for the last time, I held my breath and began to climb over the soundly sleeping stallion, but slipped, fell on top of him, still trying in vain to shake off the blanket. Rocky's eyes flew open, he blankly looked at me. — Hey... where are you running away from me again? — Good morning! M-m-m, for lovers, of course. I already wanted to continue his journey, but he pulled my hand, forcing me again to come down upon him and captured my lips in a kiss. His hands boldly slid down the waist. He's crazy. Here at any moment someone to come, but judging from what we both experienced over the last six months, we have no surprise. I tried to pull away and get up, but fate has deprived me of this possibility, deepening the kiss, making me smile through it. Unexpectedly for us the door to the room opened with a rumble, the doorway seemed to Apollo. Judging by his expression, he was surprised. Just look at the contented face of this stud, he's put me in an awkward position in front of the other. What was even more unexpected, he quickly threw me back onto my side of the bed. I think I have deja vu. Nothing happened, we just... knock it! — If you want to be alone, so I would have said. You're a... and I have nothing against that. I think he laughs. God, they drive me crazy. — Are you crazy? We don't exercise, I didn't even think about it. — Trust me, creed, he thought. But I'm not fingers do. Living with a boxer, the main thing to understand is that women weaken legs, hence the balance problem. Interestingly, your that rocky Marciano had the same problem? — I don't remember so much his wife weighed. Almost got me crushed. What did you eat for dinner baby? Hey, don't hit me, I'm fragile. Well, I'm sure to remember my Italian stallion. He waited until creed hidden behind the door, I reached for the Bathrobe, and then hastily moved through the man, tugging the nightie. This whole situation has caused me laughter, and our friend at the door also laughed out loud. — I will make you choose the food, which is less than the mole itself, you understand? Crazy heavy! Masochist looking, all my fights, sitting in the first row. You'll practice with us? I can't, I have plans. I'll be back, and in a few rounds in the pool. But without you. Don't even bother to come and chase me. Don't think I'll be able to train. Disturbs me something, but I don't want to talk to you about all this. I'll check with Mary Ann... and then with Creed. After will tell you everything, it will just be too ugly. Secrets are not mine. I can't cook nothing would be able to surprise the heavyweights, Tony and brother and son, Mary Ann came for me an hour and a half, and we left to conquer the Philadelphia stores, leaving our boxers and Tony alone with the sport. In my opinion, they are not reconciled, I think I even heard a few not the most beautiful compliments that they bestowed each other. They all looked at each other, and I just sighed sadly. I guess they last a good noise. I can't believe that their family begins to disintegrate. I could not imagine that someday rocky will behave similarly. No, I even think about it could not. Now I tried to change the subject more interesting for both of us, it is true, then Mary Ann began to share with me their experiences. Hell, why did she even think that he is cheating on her, and how she managed to reassure me? One more word and I'll go crazy. We need urgently to understand all this until these two have ruined their relationship permanently. So it is impossible. I couldn't stay away just because Mary Ann is my only friend, and she is not for this as I nursed my husband after fights, it's not watched as he was beaten in the ring. Perhaps she does not pass it through themselves, as do I, but in any case, this does not mean that after all this, it is possible to do so. She doesn't deserve. Yes no woman deserves such attitude. Doesn't deserve to he lied to her. I think here it is necessary to let the heavy artillery. Not for seduction, so, for a change. They, of course, necessary always and all. Even I, though I am not a fan. Think it instilled in me Mary Ann when you came into my wardrobe is a black Jersey dress, which I still hate to pull over. He even rocky had not seen. I'll leave it for a rainy day, on a day when we shall pick up for each other exactly the same compliments. Honestly, it were these words... I like even his horse is not heard, he is quite the chatterbox. Though why was that? So he left... for that I love him. Even alone in the dressing room, I continued to listen Mary Ann who handed me the blouse and continued to complain about disregard for himself. — You know how frustrating? I means he this, that, and he. he... sleeping with someone. Are you listening to me? Beige blouse? Here you go. Hands still spreading. I slightly moved the curtain, looking at her. Maybe I thought I heard? It is unlike the Apollo. — Hit or something? Completely gone mad. Wait. You've lost me. And don't tell you if he really hit you, it is unlikely that I'm talking. And, you in this sense. Well, everyone has their own methods of reconciliation. Can I ask you something? Why do you think he's cheating on you? This is a very serious accusation. Well, what has been missing for a few days. Little did he cases. I certainly don't condone it, but you have no right to blame him... look, I talk to him? Well, what I can't stand to watch you torture yourself so. — No, it is not necessary to talk to him. I don't want you to get involved. We had a long conversation, walking down the street with acquired purchases. And I still felt uncomfortable in the company that we have at home, so I invited Mary Ann to your specialty coffees. Honestly, if I was with her, they will not get me to train with them. I'm usually for it, but when it happens... it will be difficult to concentrate, and rocky will be angry. We used a taxi to get home faster. Although we would still nobody noticed. I was greeted by only Butkus, the rest were busy. Great! Here they are... gentlemen-fighters. Well, now I'm gonna say something. She gave me his load and went to the Creed. What kind of woman? Run, run in their high heels I carried the packages into the house and went to him. Rocky and Tony shot me a look as if demanding an explanation. I just put a finger to her lips, trying to get closer to Apollo and Mary Anne. I almost stood between them, trying to stop the already started a scandal. — I'm sick already on your box, okay?! I hate it. — And I your Jogging in the morning! — Damn bastard! — Bitch! — And your friends know how you thank me for what I nurse you back to health after your fights? He cuckolded me! What are you talking about, crazy? — What, the truth? — Quietly, quietly, you both crazy?! I stood between them, arms outstretched to the sides, like a judge in the Boxing ring. — Calm down. Break, I say! Rocky, give me a towel. All is all, a white towel thrown. — I said I shouldn't have come. It's not a good idea. Thank you for keeping me company. She quickly took their purchases and... threw them into the car creed. Think Apollo forgot to think about is not very good to complete discussions, and when recovered, she was sitting in the driver's seat. Still, it's risky. Creed was about to say something, but Mary Anne just shot him a withering look and quickly pulled the key from the ignition, leaving behind only dust. This woman left. I left on the car creed. This made me laugh. Loud laughter, when I was in the house. But I soon became more serious. I disassembled the purchase, and suddenly in my head came a thought that I drove by myself all the time. Dressed, I went out into the air, searching look rocky. I needed help with gloves, so as to wear them on their own is impossible. Still the bandages... I have long searched for the paws until I noticed that they have a creed. Terrible day. Winding bandages Boxing is an art, which rocky owned in perfection. Rock, well, why so difficult? Maybe without the bandages? Why should they? So much time... Well, first, they kind of prolong the \"life\" gloves, otherwise you would have long since killed them. And most importantly, reduce the likelihood to injure the brush. Sorry, but your manicure flew... Hey, what's up her butt? I thought they all find out. It seems, rocky is also worried about this situation. Well, still, even a little, and all this became known to all the neighbors. — I'll check it out, don't worry. Finish. Thank you! And I will swim with you after lunch. I think training in the company Tony will be useful to you, and I need to talk to Apollo. Very. I playfully punched him in the jaw area, just as he once to me, preparing to fight, and went to the Creed. I hope you don't mind. Feet slightly higher. We need to talk. Come on, tell me why you come home so late, and why Mary Ann thinks you're cheating on her? I did not ask anything more, deciding to listen and not interrupt. But they could start to do something else, but they prefer the box and without realizing it, tied me love to all of this. But sometimes I think the pet store I would have been more useful than here and now, with his heavyweights, but I admit I like the beat Boxing paws day by day.[Chapter 7] Mrs. stallion, you will come to work in silence, and if you decide to talk, then let's change the subject. Tell me what you were doing with a stallion when I came to you. God, now this ambiguous situation is to embarrass me to the end of life. Isn't he supposed to knock? In the end, we do allow ourselves in the morning, things like that. But only when rocky moves workout. But now it's not about us, but about what does this type? — No, we're going to talk about it. Yes, it has no tears will not look. You like to harass her? — Okay. What gave you that crazy? Yes, it's all a lie. In a sense,... — I heard what she shouted you ten minutes earlier. I'd listen to it all the time until we went shopping. Dark something you, creed! If you do something with someone was... admit it. Tell her it is too late. Until it ruined your relationship completely. You have two children, if suddenly it comes to divorce, how are you going to explain to them? After all, they are still quite tiny. And what will happen when he is sixteen years old? And you know what, if rocky did something similar, I would never have forgiven me. Never! I'd break his nose with my right punch. What? Nose — his erogenous zone. As actually eyes. What are you looking at? Cheating is a betrayal. That is the ultimate betrayal. Don't know how after that do you love? This is not goodbye. Except for a couple things... but this is my point of view. Do you hear what I'm saying? Can I kick your ass? No well, okay? I talk to him, and he... what? — I'm confused, you see, miss buck? — Well, of course. You have long been all the brains on one side. And raise your legs above already. He got confused. If I could just put yourself in my place or on her. I want to help. Although... I'm not going to climb into your soul, in your relationship, I just want to warn you that this whole situation could end in tears. And still, it's none of your business, we'll handle it. Yes, you are certainly right. It's not my business, but your wife is my friend. The only. I'm a misanthrope. In some way. A shy misanthrope. You know what it is with me at all? — Adrian, you didn't bite, huh? — he looked at me and took Boxing paws. We talked and talked until, until he brought me out of myself. I have nerves of steel, since I watched all the fights of man, but the phrase creed instantly destroy all my barriers. Today he tested my right for yourself. In order not to repeat my triumph, I already went to the house, but rocky stopped me trying to ask. — Take off the gloves. — What happened? — Take off the gloves, I beg you. You too embedding? Hell, take them out! Under my withering look he took off my gloves and rushed into the room with a roar slamming the door. I dressed in the first thing that fell out of the closet, at least put makeup on and went down the stairs, smiling baby, something draws in his album. Taking the cream jacket, I walked out, noticing that my heavyweights and Tony approached my beloved brother, holding a bottle of beer in his hands. Probably talking about me. Of course, now a long time will remember the shock and my lectures. And it will survive, the main thing to restrain myself and not allocate the adrenaline. — Adrianna is an idiot. Head one void. Listen to her more. I said that she's sometimes so annoying that I could beat up her soul? I noticed that rocky was tense from his words, but personally I have not heard anything new. I hope the Rock will keep. Chatter Polly is not worth it... — And you get it. You have two ways to calm the woman can fight or tell a story that would bring her either to hysteria or to coma. Creed, talk to your brother believe me, Polly will teach you phrases which will bring Mary Ann to this state. Just for effect, you'll have to make a baby with her. I forgot when my brother thanked me for something or complimented. He just never shuts up, I owe it all to him. Just because he raised me because he is my brother. And I remember that he is my brother. I always care about him, and nothing he doesn't have to. As soon as I came in sight of creed, he pretended that does not notice me. Well, I'm glad. Not becoming more to talk to any one present, I pointedly withdrew, loudly banging his heels on the stone path. Rocky called after me, but I just sped up, literally running away from him. Still in heels, I run slower, although I speak it almost perfectly. To me, a humble worker of the pet store, to compete with a professional boxer, and besides heels? Damn, how fast he runs. He managed to grab me so that I couldn't even move. Hands, at least. — Wait, wait. Yes do not twitch you. Well, where are you, where are you going? — You there seems to be trained? Here you go ... let me go, or I'll hit you, Rock. — Let's really look at things? You can't resist me. First, you're not in that position. Second, you don't have so much health and strength. And third... But we are not in the ring, I'm not going to follow these stupid rules. I could below the belt hit. Damn, really stupid. Stupid, because I wanted to help a friend deal with family problems... please leave me alone, one Creed, and tell him that I'm not going to mind my own business, and let's not even asked to give him advice. What the hell is this, can you explain to me? And where you are going? I'll be on the track! Do not walk behind me, snorted, trying to escape from his embrace. The jacket is put on, it's getting cold already, ' he grinned, smacking kiss me on the cheek, and released. And that's all? That's all he could tell me now? His concern knows no bounds. Feeling his piercing gaze, I quickly disappeared from his sight. Inside was growing some kind of lump of resentment, but rocky I wasn't mad, because he is not at fault. He's not grossing me out, but Apollo could understand, although I fully support a friend. It was hard for me to digest the new information, and I came to a place where it is usually rocky, when he's hard. I'm afraid that nothing he showed me this place. It's so peaceful here, so quiet and the air is so fresh. By the way, down to the rails, I sometimes run through this railway with Butkus, it's his favorite route through my husband. But I didn't know that there is such a wonderful place. After standing here for two hours, maybe three, I forced myself to get out of here. I went towards the pet store. I spent the whole day there was not a sense of responsibility took me up. Most likely, Gloria today finished work earlier than usual, and if she is, you won't mind my presence, because she can not cope alone. There was no one inside, but the massacre, which staged there, made me freeze in the doorway and even to open his mouth in surprise. What the hell happened here? What is this, a Boxing match held? All right, Gloria will kill me. Yes, this week will not clean. And the animals? I quickly inspected the pet store, checking out all our Pets on the spot, if not, it is Gloria exactly I live will not peel off. Will have to remove it all and start remembering who it is we are so annoy that hurt our pet store. Most likely, this damage did those scumbags who hurt so much pinned me to the wall. Just how did they get here? But, by the way, I caught myself thinking that the door was not closed and as time was not quite later, Gloria probably went out to eat, and the door just slammed. Part bags had to peretaskat in the basement just because they bothered to clean up all this debris and shrapnel. But exactly until, until I heard a motorcycle rumble. Where only he knows I'm here? No, he can't see that I am lifting this much weight. He said something, standing on the street, but I couldn't heard, but clearly understood that he wants to get to me. And in a minute came the blow of God, he broke the lock. I now definitely over. — Baby, come on, I know you're here. The scent of your vanilla perfume that smell is not vanilla, it's not messed up. Come out and tell me what it all means. Adria-a-B. Here you are. Well, will you explain yourself? And hurry, I saw your partner. — I don't know what happened here, but I know that if I won't clean it until the arrival of Gloria — she'll kill me. What? And she saw you? Great! Rock, help me, please. — Okay, I'll try! Rocky ran a hand over my cheek, smiled and with his thumb rubbed my lipstick. Then he literally ripped my blouse so that half of buttons with their usual dings scattered over the floor. — I think I'm going to punch you. This is my new blouse, what have you done, rocky. How ... how am I home go something like this? He took my chin and pulled into a kiss. Oh Yes, found time, and before I hugged him as the door to the pet store again with a roar opened. We saw Gloria. A whisper telling me to go and wait for him the bike, he threw me on the shoulders of my cream jacket and nudged towards the exit. They spoke briefly, but I managed to freeze, probably, this jacket is too easy. And when rocky came to me with a smug smile on his face, gave me his. I wonder what he told her that she didn't even make a sound? Thanks, that helped! But... what did you say? I said that you and your pet have sex. Funny, isn't it? Okay, grab a helmet and hop in. — W... W-what? You told her... what? — Relax and don't worry, Gloria won't tell anyone provided that you are there tomorrow will put things in order. And the damage of the blouse offset by a delicious coffee in the morning. By the way, you promised to swim with me, remember? — Oh, no. No, — I shook my head, crossing my arms over my chest — coffee is too easy. Perhaps you can help me tomorrow. Food will just choose. Button bad eating one in which little moths. I guess I'll have to buy one. If this poor woman will cough, you will crack her shell. Just kidding, of course. You gonna help or want me to carry gravity? I am too weak for this. I am very, very weak. — That is the day you almost sent Apollo to the knockout, and now want to make me believe that you are weak? Okay, sit down. Just grab this. Come on. And Yes, creed was gone, and Polly apologize. I promise, I will. He'll apologize as well. You don't mind, I'm used to and it does not take offense. He is constantly unhappy with me, and you, by the way, too. But he's my brother, I love him, and I don't want you to fight for me using physical force. I am of course very nice, but... all silent. Go. We arrived pretty quickly, and if he continues to give me a ride, driving at that speed, our child will be an orphan. Hell, it was the last time I sat with him on the motorcycle. We almost crashed and he just laughed. He really funny? I removed his helmet nervously blowing the hair that treacherous climb straight in the eye. Some kind of nightmare week. — Take off your clothes! — What about? No, rocky, cold. I will not, do not want. — I'll warm you up, but too late. I promise I will cheer up and warm. And a couple of slices you need. — Warm? Ho-Ho, you can't afford it. I say it is very expensive. — Where did you learn this kind of smut? Tony — he left our guest's jacket, which he pulled from me and while he appreciated the look of my new look, rock grabbed me in his arms and threw him in the pool. I don't even have time to recover and come up for air, and he cried out with a \"Banzai\" to me. Yes, I wanted him to swim, but not like this. Who knew that the weather so drastically change? Although the day was very hot. Sick still not enough. Of course, he is doing everything possible, if only I didn't go to the pet store, but this is too much. And since I'm here — a couple of circles I do. Day one, I need to unload. — With your breath something, and over speed need to work on. Of course my breath something, I froze. I am very, very cold. And if I suddenly get ill — to the doctor, I won't go, and he goes to the pet store to my part-time job instead of me. I simply turn life into a nightmare. He just doesn't know how sick I am. Making last lap, I got out of the water, Tony smiled and went into the house. Still, I did not give rest a situation that has become a problem in the family creed. Probably, my problem is that I take everything too close to heart. All the little things. And what really there to talk about the attacks rocky, who had me. Need to do something, otherwise this whole story will lead me either to a mental hospital or in a coma, and the second option is more real than the first. My body is not ready for such pressure different emotions. Rocky is sure to be on the side of Apollo, they're friends. Need something to do. You can wait for everything else will resolve itself. It is a pity that long. Because rocky is going to go. I'm in jail, and he was in the hospital, though in our case, rather the contrary. Dressed in dry clothes and wrapped in a warm blanket, I sat down on the bed, combing her hair, but literally a minute later I jumped up, looking for a small neck scarf that I usually our with such blouses. Really, lost? No, maybe it's a gift from my husband. What will he think of me? He could be anywhere: in a pet store, somewhere on the bridge or in the yard. Rocky came into the room and immediately asked a timely question: \"have you lost something?\". He then asked me to guess where I lost my accessory. What we're going to play \"guess the melody\"? Why can't you just say so? Was in my place... well there, right? I knew you will come there because you have nowhere else to put his thoughts in order. Don't lose, you're really going. ... Thank you! I took from his hand his handkerchief, and was just about to kiss him in gratitude, but looked down, being a few millimeters from his face. — But I hurt! Playfully winking at him, I put the plaid on chairs and crawled under the covers, deciding not to wait until rocky is back here after a shower. I just pointedly turned away from him, making it clear that I will no longer talk to him. And I'd really like to rocky spoke with Creed, although both of us should not interfere in it. Let them understand. These thoughts did not give me to sleep, so as soon as Rock came back, I had to cleverly pretend to be asleep, and when you hear a light snore, it is possible to think again about what happened. I frowned. Well, what is it? The lights in our room went out, and soon I felt the waist of rocky's arm clutching me to him. With a sigh and a little toss of her head, I smiled. As well, he won't let me long to be mad at him. — Oh, Yes, I know you also wanted to spit on his own principles... and I demand explanations in the morning, okay? I only vaguely agreed with him, as the dream for a long time took me up. I was hoping that this night will be calm, that I don't Wake up with the heartbreaking cries and tears that will raise the entire house. Now I dismissed all bad thoughts, all the experiences and speculation. Now I understand why I can't sleep. They already drove me crazy. I'm too close to my heart was to accept anything. Although there is something I've always been like this, and rocky is right. My problem is this. But I can't help it, even though it absolutely not sleep. Should be, I could make a good psychologist, but I love animals. I love animals and if I had my way, I probably would have settled in the pet store. By the way about this place... I forgot... it's a mess. Nothing to do, I have to bring the workplace into shape and stop, finally, to think about what is none of my business.

They belong to Sylvester Stallone, Stephen Caple Jr. and the other talented filmmakers. I however created Sofia, Alexei, Popov, Yevgeny, Sasha, and Ayzere. The title comes from a line in the Survivor song, \"Burning Heart.\" (My favorite song from Rocky IV) Author's Note: I apologize if the descriptions of Soviet and Russian politics are inaccurate. Personally, I think while some of the allegations were no doubt propaganda and exaggerated by the American press, some were also true. Just like in the United States (especially nowadays.). I am just using how they are depicted in the context and framework of the Rocky and Creed movies. Oh and I am not very familiar with boxing terms so I am keeping them to a minimum using well known ones like cutting, faking, knockout etc. I am more interested in the psychology of such athletes: the persistence, determination, vengeance, etc. Of those who earn a living fighting each other. Author's Note Update: I decided to do some new things with this fic. It's pretty much the same but there were some headcanon ideas that I wanted to do differently and now having seen many of my favorite scenes of Creed II on Youtube and having some encouragement from my fellow Creed II fans on Youtube (like J. Rossi and Gunners 4Life 97), as well as from you wonderful readers and reviewers like EvenLynn and Queen of the Gale and the folks on AO3's Facebook group, I have decided to go through with it. The first chapter has been more or less rewritten to flesh out Ivan's parents and give them more of a backstory and to give hints of his upbringing. New scenes will be added to subsequent chapters and I will have more perspectives than just Ivan's. Before we had some with Rocky but we will also have Sofia, Ludmilla, Sasha, Adonis, and Viktor's pov's as well. Summary: Ivan Drago was never one to outwardly show emotion but that didn't mean he didn't feel it. I. Alexei and Sofia Lieutenant Alexei Ivanovich Drago was a drunk weakling. At least that's how his son Ivan always saw him. He hated his father but loved his mother. In fact he could never understand what she saw in him. He was a proud member of the Soviet Army and an amateur boxer but had fallen in disgrace. All the years Ivan knew him, the old man was lost to alcohol, self-pity, rage, and hatred. His father was a weakling who used his anger and fists to dominate others. His mother, Sofia, was technically weak in her own way as well but in a way that made Ivan pity her rather than despise her. She was a small fair haired frail weak hearted woman as compared to her larger dark haired dominant husband. She had soft hands and a beautiful bird-like soprano voice that soothed her son when he couldn't sleep. When she was younger, Sofia Nikolaievna Vorobey aspired to be a singer. At 12 years old, she left her native Ukraine and the cold orphanage that she had been raised in for two years to study music so she could eventually attend the Moscow Conservatory of Music. She could have been a great choral or opera singer but instead fell in love with Alexei Drago, a Russian soldier, when she was sixteen and he twenty-seven. They met after one of Alexei's amateur matches. He left the match full of drink and laughed with his friends about Nikita Khrushchev's recent trip to America, particularly how the premiere was denied the chance to go to Disneyland for security reasons. (\"Are they afraid Mickey Mouse will bite him to death?\") Of course none of them were bothered in the slightest that they weren't called to guard Khrushchev on his trip. \"Let's admit it, Comrades,\" Alexei joked to his buddies. \"The Americans would be too afraid of us! They know we could beat them.\" Alexei's comrades laughed uproariously as Alexei took another swig of his vodka. They were about to cross the street and head for another tavern when a sound interrupted him. Alexei faced the auditorium where he heard the sound of a woman singing. The voice was clear, high pitched, and mesmerizing. It was almost like a siren's. Alexei walked inside and approached the voice. He entered the auditorium where a young woman stood in the center. She was dressed like a rag doll in a white schoolgirl dress and a blue ribbon. Her blond hair ran in ringlets and her face was heavily made up. Alexei did not know much about opera, but he thought her voice was beautiful. She was a pretty good actress too. In the song, her character occasionally stopped singing as though she were a wind up toy going silent. When she was wound back up, she gave the audience a flirtatious saucy grin as she blew a kiss to the man who wound her up. After the song was over, the young woman turned to an older woman who watched the performance. \"How was that Madame Shirmateava?\" Madame Shirmateava, a tall severe looking blond woman in a black dress nodded. \"Better than last time, but the bridge still needs improvement.\" Alexei couldn't help but applaud. Both the young woman and her teacher looked annoyed. The older woman spoke crisply. \"This auditorium is closed.\" Alexei smiled and walked closer to the stage. \"Can I help it if I am captivated by her voice?\" The young woman blushed and smiled shyly as she walked closer to the edge. Alexei stuck out his hand as she held it. \"Jr. Lieutenant Alexei Ivanovich Drago.\" \"Sofia Nikolievna Vorobey,\" the girl replied. \"Lieutenant, I insist that you leave,\" Madame Shirmateava ordered. \"Not unless I am permitted to see your student again,\" Alexei said. Sofia blushed and absently removed her wig. The hair underneath was blond but was tied back. She turned to her singing instructor as if to ask whether it was alright. Madame Shirmateava, reluctantly nodded and rolled her eyes. \"Would tomorrow suit you?\" Alexei asked. \"That would be fine,\" Sofia agreed. They dated exclusively for almost one year. They attended dances, parties, had drinks and talked. They both were orphaned at young ages and had no other family members. Sofia's parents died of a fever when she was ten. The orphanage director in Kiev heard her sing and helped get her started on her path. \"Many directors are cruel,\" Sofia said. \"But I suppose he was kind enough to recognize something in me.\" In fact it was the director who referred Sofia to Nina Shirmateava, a singing instructor in Moscow who took in the orphaned girl. Alexei's mother died of cancer when he was five and he barely remembered her. He was raised mostly by his father who was himself a major in the Soviet Ground Forces Army. Major Ivan Drago raised his son with the strictest discipline and to have respect for the Soviet Union. (\"A Stalinist party member to the last,\" Alexei said.) He taught his son to suspect others and to not trust anyone except his father and not always that. Alexei learned that lesson so well that when his father died fighting the Germans in the War, 13-year-old Alexei withdrew from life for a time but forced himself to snap out of it. \"I picked myself up. Never looked back. Of course I acquired a fondness for the bottle after that but who doesn't?\" Nina, Sofia's singing instructor, was not happy about the romance between her protégée and the soldier since she felt that Sofia was throwing away a good career for love. The orphaned Ukrainian girl was like a daughter to her and she was very shy, unworldly, and somewhat featherheaded, practically a child. \"That man will break you,\" Nina insisted after a substandard rehearsal where Nina accused Sofia of having her mind on something, or rather someone, else. Always by Nina's side was Madame Raissa Cohen, ballet instructor and Nina's closest friend. Many of their students speculated that the two women were more than friends but none ever said so to their faces. Raissa was not as domineering as her friend, often preferred to be kind when Nina was sharp. \"You have so much more ahead of you,\" Raissa said. \"Romance will come and go but opportunities like this will only come once in a lifetime.\" \"I am doing my best,\" Sofia insisted. \"Not enough,\" Nina spat. \"You are missing rehearsals. Your phrasing isn't as good and your arias are not the same. The Conservatory will never accept you if you continue you as you are now! Either you end things with him or you end your career.\" \"I love Alexei,\" Sofia insisted wondering what this old spinster knew about love.\"Can't I have both?\" \"Nyet,\" Nina insisted. \"No woman is ever that fortunate! You will see. If you do not choose, the Conservatory's panel will decide for you.\" They did. At her audition, she performed Antonia's portion of the climactic battle in Tales of Hoffman. She sang the song several times but now understood the longing Antonia had caught between the man she loved and the mother (or in her case mother figure) who wanted her to sing. She never sang with such longing and sadness. By the time she finished, she was in tears. The judges were not moved. They insisted that while she was talented, she would not be permitted to attend the Conservatory To her credit, Nina Shirmateava was not smug nor did she say she told her so. Instead she walked the sobbing girl home to the rooming house for musical students. She put Sofia to bed and sat outside her room concerned about where she was headed next in her life. All those years of preparation ending in rejection. While she was still young, 17 and had many years ahead of her, Nina knew that Sofia would not see it that way. A loss was a loss. A rejection was a rejection. A defeat was a defeat and it would continue to haunt that girl for the rest of her life. She had seen many students fall into despair making the wrong decisions that made their lives worse losing themselves to alcohol, drugs, self pity, bad romances, and destructive behaviors that destroyed any potential that they would ever have had. A sharp knock filled the house as Nina bade Raissa to open the door. Nina glared when Jr. Lieutenant Alexei Drago entered the room. Talking of bad decisions, she thought wryly. \"I would like to see Sofia,\" he said. Nina was about to refuse but against her better judgement, she knocked on Sofia's door. \"It's Drago,\" she said. After some hesitation, Sofia exited the room. Her eyes were red rimmed and her face was flushed. She was dressed very primly in a long black skirt and white peasant blouse, but Alexei could see the passion underneath. \"I heard. Would you walk with me, Sonia?\" \"Nyet you may not,\" Nina insisted. Sofia glared at her mentor, cold rage filled her lazy blue eyes. Who was Nina Shirmateava to tell her who she was to be with? She tried her and Raissa's way to be a singer and it was clear that she didn't have it. Why not be like most girls and go out, fall in love, maybe get married and have children? Frankly, she was through listening to these dried up spinsters! Sofia took Alexei's hand as they walked out. She poured out her feelings over the rejection. Alexei held her tightly. \"It is for the best,\" he whispered. \"How can it be for the best?\" She said. \"Well I don't want my wife working now do I?\" Alexei joked. It took a moment before she understood the full meaning of what he just said. Before she could react, he asked for her permission to be his wife. \"We are orphans so there is no one else to ask.\" Naturally, Nina fumed when Sofia told her she was engaged. \"You are a fool and a stupid girl! You are making the worst decision of your life!\" \"They rejected me!\" Sofia insisted. \"What choice do I have?\" \"You were rejected by one Conservatory, one-\" \"-The best in the Soviet Union as you reminded me,\" Sofia argued. \"-You can still apply for others, even set your sights lower to teach music,\" Nina suggested. \"Like you did,\" Sofia sharply retorted. \"I have better things to do with my life than living through the achievements of others to make up for my failures.\" Nina hung her head. She had been a stage and film actress in the '30's and '40's but somehow never achieved success. Rather than despairing over the issue, she decided to become a singing and drama instructor and when Raissa's ballet career ended in an injury, the two long time friends decided to combine their resources and become mentors to young girls interested in starting careers in music, drama, and dance. \"So you would rather live them through your husband,\" Nina countered. \"Do you think that man cares for you? He only wants a mother for his children and a housekeeper that he doesn't have to pay. He will never let you be yourself.\" \"Neither will you,\" Sofia shot back. \"I am marrying him. I love Alexei and he loves me. That is all there is to it.\" Nina shook her head. \"Then we have nothing more to say to each other. You are alone in this. We will never see each other again. Pozhaluysta ostavite.\" Please leave. Tears filled Sofia's eyes as she packed her bags, left the dorm room, and joined her fiancé. It didn't take long for Sofia to realize how right Nina actually was. In fact it took their wedding night. Shortly after the two made love, Alexei looked her up and down and said. \"You will have to do better than that if you do not wish me to find it elsewhere.\" \"I was a virgin until now,\" Sofia objected. That comment only incensed him further and he struck his wife. \"If you wish to be a good wife, you will not argue with your husband,\" Alexei growled. Sofia nodded meekly. She never objected when her husband ordered her about. As a good military wife, she was required to keep the house in order cleaning and scrubbing for hours on end, have meals prepared for her husband the second he walked in, keep her head low, never object to her husband's demands, and always ask his permission. She learned rather quickly. One day, she stood up from scrubbing the floor. She straightened her back wearily and rested her hand on her womb. Five months pregnant and it felt like an eternity. Sofia hoped her child would be nothing like it's father. Since Alexei would not be home for sometime, Sofia decided to take a break and read the newspaper. An obituary caught her eye. It said that Nina Shirmateava, music and drama instructor died of ovarian cancer at age 49. Tears filled Sofia's eyes at the loss of her friend and mentor. She realized that Nina may have been ill when she left. Nina's final words: We will never see each other again haunted her. They weren't a threat, a warning. Sofia realized that they were a sad truth that she and the girl who was like a daughter to her never would see each other again in this world. Sofia's hands shook as she picked up the phone and dialed Raissa Cohen's number. \"Privet?\" The woman answered. Sofia could tell by that one word that the ballet instructor was filled with an intense grief. Sofia held the phone in dumb silence as Raissa's voice continued. \"Privet? Privet?\" Hello. Hello. \"This is not funny. We are a house in mourning.\" Sofia could hear the loss in the other woman's voice like someone whose spouse died. Maybe the student's theories about the two women were right.(A month later, Sofia read sadly that Raissa Cohen had followed her friend in death cause uncertain but Sofia wondered if she died of a broken heart.) Sofia hung up the phone unsure about what to say and knowing that she made the choice to marry and cut ties with her surrogate mother and aunt. Marriage and motherhood took the place of her aspirations. She had to accept that. Nina was right, she was alone in this. She was literally alone when she went into labor. Alexei was out with his drinking comrades having a good time. Sofia felt a tremendous amount of pain so much that she opened the partition to let the family on the other side know that she was going into labor. Most families that shared a Khrushchev apartment ignored each other. This was even more so in the military barracks. When the family on the other side screamed at each other, the Dragos did not respond. When Alexei beat and swore at his wife, the family on the other side never called the police because they probably did not want to be a bother. Sofia considered it a miracle that they helped at all. Two women, Sofia knew their names to be Olga and Irina, a mother and daughter respectively, helped the young mother back to bed. Sofia knew there was also a husband, Dimitri, but he was out. She wondered if he was gone for the evening maybe with Alexei. Olga told Sofia to push while her daughter rubbed her forehead with a wet cloth. She was in such intense pain but continued to push for her child's sake. Finally, the baby emerged from his mother. Olga cut the cord as she handed the crying little one back to his mother. \"He has quite a set of lungs,\" she said dryly. \"He has the look of a fighter in him.\" Sofia thanked them for their help. Sofia would have liked to be their friends, but they left the next day and she never saw them again. Sofia looked at her son. He favored his mother completely with fair hair and blue eyes. His features however were those of his father. Alexei. Would Alexei be as happy as she was now? She remembered how fond Alexei was of his late father and she thought maybe in a way that Sofia gave her husband his family back. When Alexei entered the apartment, Sofia breastfed her son. \"What is that?\" Alexei asked confused. Sofia laughed. \"That is Ivan Alexeyevich Drago, your son.\" Alexei's eyes widened then softened at the realization. \"My son? Ivan?\" He smiled and looked closely at the boy. \"You know there is something of the old man in him. He looks like a fighter already.\" \"It's what everyone thinks,\" Sofia said with a laugh as her husband kissed her then his son. Sofia hoped that fatherhood would mellow her husband and smooth his rough edges but it didn't. He was just as hard and critical as ever. He was extremely impatient with his son ordering his wife to make him stop crying then criticizing her for coddling him. Sofia could do nothing but hold her son and pray that he won't be like his father so filled with rage and anger. When Ivan was a year and a half old, his father returned home furious. Ivan had lined up his set of toy soldiers on the floor and played quietly with them in the corner. Alexei walked into the house and stepped on one of Ivan's soldiers. He screamed with rage and backhanded his son. Ivan ran to his mother's side in fear. That incensed Alexei even more. \"Make him be a strong man, not a weakling who runs to his coddling mother!\" He shouted. Sofia comforted her son and reminded him that he must put away his toys so as not to make Papa mad. \"Are you alright Alexei?\" She asked. Alexei laughed a chilling laugh. \"No I am not. I have been discharged!\" \"What happened?\" Sofia asked. Alexei told her. It took place after a boxing match. Alexei was fighting against a younger opponent Ilya Smirnov. Since Smirnov was younger and faster, Alexei had to resort to cheap shots to gain the advantage. He punched him after the bell rang which caused their superiors to stop the fight. Alexei was in such a white heat rage that when a sergeant major attempted to remove him, Alexei struck him. \"Apparently it was not the first time,\" Alexei said. \"They claim I have been insubordinate before.\" \"Well you have a temper,\" Sofia began. Her husband clenched his fist and glared at her. Sofia backtracked. \"What I mean is that you are always right of course with your temper.\" Alexei nodded. \"Be that as it may, they did not see that.\" They did not wait for a hearing. Alexei suspected that they were so fed up with his temper that they discharged him on the spot removing his insignias and badges and telling him to leave. \"They have it in for me you know,\" Alexei said. \"They all do! I lost because of them!\" \"No it's not your fault,\" Sofia agreed knowing that different opinions were not a luxury that she was permitted with her husband. \"So what happens now?\" Alexei shrugged. \"I collect my pension, this fucking government owes me that much at least. Find work I suppose.\" \"I could as well,\" Sofia suggested. Alexei laughed. \"And do what? Besides I don't want my wife working!\" \"Yes Alexei,\" she said. She then felt a tug on her skirt hem as Ivan toddled up to her. \"Mama gold'ny,\" he said putting his hand towards his mouth gesturing that he was hungry. \"Alright Vanyushka,\" she said. Sofia picked up her son and carried him to the kitchen feeding him his baby food. Shortly after that, Alexei, his wife, and son moved to the Kapotnya district in Moscow which was the only place he could afford. Sofia hated it but never said anything. The crime, drunken shouting, shootings, and riots feared her nights with terror. She could tell Ivan did not like it very much either. \"Gromko,\" he said one night covering his ears as a street brawl occurred right outside their window. \"Indeed,\" Sofia said. \"Far too loud.\" The only one who adjusted to this environment was Alexei mostly because he found many friends who were like him, former soldiers mostly but also unemployed laborers, former criminals, those who were without hope and spent their nights drinking their troubles away. Now Alexei was unemployed and unwilling to look for work. Most of the time he either sat at home getting drunk with his friends or go to the smoky pubs and get drunk there. He had a bad temper that couldn't be tamed and when he got mad, he got violent especially after several drinks of vodka. Ivan sometimes cried in the corner as his father swallowed more drinks and his voice became louder. He told bawdy jokes with his friends, laughed uproariously, and sang Russian folk songs at the top of his lungs usually ranting about the goddamned Leonid Brezhnev and the fucking Politburo and Kremlin. As he grew and learned about Soviet politics in school, Ivan wondered since Father never was hidden about his dislike of the government, why he hadn't gotten arrested yet. But he realized that nobody wanted to. No one took his father seriously. To his former military comrades he was just a joke, a harmless clown, better left to rot in his obscurity than made into an example. From an early age, Ivan learned the art and hidden power of staying silent. He learned that when he was three. His father lay on the couch hungover and Ivan watched Crocodile Gena on television. Alexei ordered his son to keep the sound down or else. Ivan kept it as low as possible and didn't say anything. On the screen, Gena and his little friend Cheburashka were talking about their latest caper when Gena took out his accordion to sing a silly song. The lyrics made Ivan smile. Before he could stop himself, he laughed. He covered his mouth but the laughter continued through his closed fingers. It stopped immediately when his father sprang up from his bed. \"I thought I told you to be quiet!\" He beat his son knocking him to the floor. \"I was being quiet,\" Ivan insisted. \"I'm sorry, Papa.\" \"Are you arguing with me, malachik?\" Boy. \"Are you being insubordinate?\" With each question, Alexei shook his son. \"Nyet,\" Ivan whimpered. \"You will learn not to argue with me,\" Alexei commanded picking his son up by the hair so hard that he actually pulled tufts from his scalp. He then turned his son over and undid his shirt. He then took off his belt and beat his son multiple times. Ivan cried hot angry tears. He wanted so badly to fight his father or run away from him. He couldn't fight since the man was much bigger than him. He couldn't run because he had to protect Mama. After all, Papa beat her too. The only thing he could do was accept it, let him beat him, and be quiet. Just freeze. If he argued or disagreed with his father, Alexei always found an excuse to rail on him and beat him severely. Ivan learned that it was best not to say anything at all. So he sat in silence observing his father with equal parts fear and hatred simmering inside him. Sometimes he went through a whole day without saying anything. The only thing that could bring Ivan out of his self- imposed emotional exile was how his father treated his mother. One night, Sofia delivered drinks and food to Alexei and his friends. One a very large bearded man, Oleg blocked Sofia's movement with one leg. She turned around but he blocked her path with his other leg. Sofia was terrified caught between this larger man's legs. \"Look what I caught,\" Oleg quipped. \"Careful she doesn't bite,\" another friend Gleb taunted. The other men laughed. As usual Ivan sat in the corner watching but not speaking. He was terrified what would happen but couldn't stop watching. Alexei laughed. \"Sonia bite? No she is a mouse, a morsel. You should see her in bed much too timid and frigid.\" \"Please let me go,\" Sofia begged but Oleg grabbed her by the arms. \"Too timid and frigid?\" Oleg mocked. \"Maybe we should find out.\" \"No please,\" Sofia begged again as Oleg stood up holding her from behind. Sofia screamed as Oleg pushed her to the ground. \"Vlad, Gleb, help me boys,\" Oleg commanded. Sofia was no match for these larger men. Vlad held her down and Gleb and Oleg removed her clothing. Alexei just laughed and taunted his wife. \"If you can't fuck me properly, maybe you will for them!\" Ivan shivered in fear and anger at the sight of his mother nude lying on the ground. He charged towards these men like a manic bull in a blind fury. \"You leave my Mama alone!\" He said kicking Oleg in the shin. There was a pause but the men just laughed. \"Hey look at the little Cossack riding to the rescue!\" Oleg mocked. \"You should get a look son,\" Alexei said. \"You will learn the facts of life.\" He held Ivan in his arms. The boy struggled to get away. \"Don't move. Stay silent.\" Alexei commanded. In his father's arms, Ivan wanted to get away but he couldn't. He wanted to turn his head or close his eyes but the image was burned into his brain. The image of his tear stained mother begging for them to stop lying naked on the floor as these grunting slobbering men, no not men pigs raped her one by one. Worst of all was the laughter from his father the satisfied moan like his wife's bad treatment was somehow arousing. When the men were finished, they stood up. Ivan tumbled to the floor next to his sobbing mother. He helped her rise. She collapsed in the boy's arms and sobbed. But Ivan's eyes were dry. \"Come comrades, we're finished here,\" Alexei said. \"I want to go see what Miriam and her women have in store for us!\" He knelt down to his wife and whispered harshly to her. \"I told you that I would get it somewhere else now so will you!\" Sofia said nothing only cried some more. Ivan kept his eyes fixed on his father. He wished he could kill him right there. After Alexei and the others left, Ivan practically gathered his mother's clothing. Her hands shook so the young boy helped her dress. \"I hate him,\" Ivan hissed as he helped button his mother's blouse. \"I wish he were dead!\" \"You mustn't say such things Ivan,\" Sofia said. \"You should hate no one especially not your father.\" \"I don't care,\" Ivan insisted. \"I wish he were dead! Someday I will fight him and I will beat him!\" That rape became one of several. Sofia waited on her husband and his friends meekly enduring their taunts, catcalls, and that Alexei's friends would continue to strip and molest her, and force her to sing to her husband's laughter and her son's shame. His father also alluded to the other women he slept with like Miriam who ran a brothel and her prostitutes and how Sofia didn't perform as well as they did. After she finished serving the men, Sofia ran to her bedroom or the kitchen with tears in her eyes while Ivan followed close behind and comforted her. Sometimes late at night, Ivan would hear his father's slobbering grunts of satisfaction and his mother's pleas of \"Alexei please stop!\" and \"No,\" through the partition. He didn't know what it meant but his mother's frightened tears and bruised face in the morning told him that it wasn't good. Everything about Sofia seemed to convey fragility like a fancy glass object that would break if the least amount of strain was put on her. After her son's birth, her health began to decline. A doctor diagnosed her as having a weak heart. For even that her husband had no pity and continued to rail at and strike her. During the day, she often tired easily caring for the apartment. Ivan followed her close behind and helped her clean up so as not to anger his father when he came home if the job wasn't finished. He then helped her into bed as though his mother was the child and he was the parent. Both of his parents had failed in their lives tremendously. Alexei ranted and raved about his losses, accusing them of being part of a conspiracy, and never accepted his own blame. Sofia on the other hand barely talked about her aborted singing career. The only tie she had to it now was to sing lullabies to her son when he couldn't sleep. She did every night and smoothed back his hair until he nodded off. Ivan thought of his parent's losses and vowed that it would never happen to him. He would never lose. He would always win. He remembered his mother's death, when he was 7 years old, and that fueled his continuing buried rage. Alexei was late coming home so late that his supper was cold. He greeted his son with a slap that sent him falling to the ground and his wife with a sharp reprimand and demand of where his supper was. Sofia, heavily pregnant with her second child, bowed and obeyed her husband. After Alexei tasted his first bite, he stood and railed at his wife asking if she was trying to poison him. \"It was warm an hour ago,\" Sofia said her bird-like voice trembling. \"What did you say woman what did you say?\" he screamed at her then punched her in the stomach. Sofia collapsed on the floor, her sobs filled the room. Lightning flashed in Ivan's eyes. He darted towards his father and pounded at him with his fists. He couldn't even make a dent in his father. Instead Alexei Drago laughed and peeled his son off his leg. \"Trying to fight your old man are you boy? You're only a puppy, a weak puppy!\" He tossed the boy down and laughed. \"I-I am not a weakling,\" Ivan stammered. \"You are!\" Alexei stopped laughing and shook his son hard. \"What did you say? You will show proper respect to your father!\" He tossed him to the ground. From where she lay, Sofia screamed. \"No Alexei, he's only a child!\" She wept as her towheaded son was thrown to the ground. She cried but then suddenly clutched her abdomen and screamed in pain. \"Mama,\" Ivan screamed running to his mother's side and holding her. He saw the blood emerge from underneath. Alexei laughed at his wife's condition. Ivan rose in fury and spat at his father. Alexei slapped his son and said, \"Quit being hysterical boy! She will be fine! She just exaggerates don't you, Sonia? Get up.\" Sofia attempted to rise but she fell back down and shook her head. Alexei's laughter got more nervous. \"Come now Sonia, rise.\" She tried again but she couldn't. Alexei became more terrified and yelled at his wife to get up. Ivan ran out of the apartment and called a neighbor to send for a doctor. He then ran back into the apartment as his father stood by the wall paralyzed with fear, worry, and guilt doing nothing more but sink to the floor and burst into hysterics. Ivan approached his mother and held her. \"It will be alright, Mama,\" Ivan said. Sofia smiled but her face was ashen. \"You would have been a good big brother,\" Sofia said knowing that she was about to lose the life inside her. Ivan didn't care about his unborn sibling. He only cared about his mother. He held her tightly refusing to let go as people came and took her to the hospital. Losing the baby caused Sofia Drago to lose the will to live. Her heart, never strong to begin with, was completely worn down from the physical abuse and the miscarriage. She was constantly bedridden and ill. Ivan sat near her talking to her when he didn't like talking to anyone else. He told her everything: events of the day, what was on television, things he learned in school anything that he hoped would take away his mother's grief and pain. Sometimes he begged his mother to sing for him but she never would. Occasionally she offered a thin smile but the sadness was always there. One day she ran a high fever and she faded in and out. She called her son over. \"Vanyushka, you are a strong boy and I know you will be a strong man,\" she said. \"One thing that I ask that you do not hate your father. He is just a sad man who has been defeated. He was once a man who showed love for his country and family. Now he does not. He shows only hate and anger and that's what defeats him. That makes him see everyone as an enemy. That does not make a person strong. It makes them weak because they have nothing to fight for. When they have nothing, they are truly defeated and they lose even when they think that they have won. Hate no one and find your own victory. Please don't be like your father.\" \"I won't be, Mama \" Ivan promised. \"I won't be weak like him. I will always win.\" Sofia lowered her eyes and for a moment Ivan thought he saw disappointment in her lazy blue eyes. She then held her son close. Ivan winced letting tears sting his eyes as he embraced his mother until her heart stopped. After that everything changed between Ivan and his father. Alexei's drinking escalated to the point where Ivan rarely saw him without a glass of vodka in his hands. Sometimes late at night Ivan woke up to hear his father sobbing and screaming Sofia's name, begging for her to return and for her forgiveness. Far from being sympathetic, Ivan lay back in bed thinking that if it weren't for that drunk foolish old man his mother would still be alive. Ivan did everything he could to stay away from his father. He saw some of the street kids in his home in Kapotnya and how the mob would beat each other bloody for a coat or a fresh piece of meat so he joined them. Even though he was younger than most of them, he was quick with his feet, fists, and reflexes, and a fast learner so he often got the better of them. His quiet demeanor often helped as many of them yelled before they attacked so Ivan heard them coming. When he attacked, no one noticed until he did. He jogged and practiced shadow punches. He watched the fighters on television wondering what made them strong and copied their moves. He vowed that he would be like them. He would enter the ring, fight his opponent, and show no mercy. He would then raise his fists in the air in triumph and no one not even his alcoholic father would defeat him. Sometimes Ivan did odd jobs for people in the neighborhood like shoveling snow, or yard work. He was already a physically strong boy and could work for a long time without tiring. He did the work and accepted the money feeling like an adult who earned his own money in the world. He saved his earnings inside a loose wooden plank under the floor and then use it to buy food for himself and his father. He knew that his mother would never have wanted him to let her husband starve. It was a good thing too. After his wife's death, Alexei blew his pension money on drink. It would no sooner be in his hands than it would be gone. In his drunken state, Alexei fought with his son. Alexei glowered and taunted at the boy often egging him on calling him names like \"Ivanushka-Durachok\", after Ivan The Fool, the imbecilic folk character. Ivan would not let Alexei get to him. Letting him anger him would be a sign of defeat and weakness. Somehow him standing there silent and glaring angered Alexei more but he could find no defense against it. The less Ivan spoke and glared his father down, the less likely Alexei was to strike back and somehow Ivan felt some small grain of power against him. However, Ivan knew this stand-down couldn't last forever. Eventually one of them would break. The break finally occurred on the second anniversary of Ivan's mother's death. He accepted money from a neighbor after he shoveled snow in the back of her house then walked inside his apartment. Ivan approached his secret hiding place to add this money with the rest, over a month's work, when he started. The floorboard was open and his secret hiding place was revealed. Ivan felt his hand inside and realized that it was empty. \"Looking for this?\" a slurred voice asked. Ivan turned to the sitting room to see his father laying on the settee surrounded by at least twenty empty glasses of vodka. He held up another and swallowed it down. Ivan glanced at the table in horror to see at least twenty more full glasses. He knew where that money went. \"Father that money was for food,\" Ivan said angrily. Ivan clenched his fists in fury at his father's selfishness that not only did he steal his son's money but he used it to buy alcohol for himself without even a thought for his son. Alexei chortled as he drank another glass. Ivan noticed that the old man was shaking as though he were having a small seizure. \"Oh he speaks,\" he laughed. \"After thinking that he is too good to speak to me he finally speaks! It's a blessed miracle! He doesn't speak to me,\" He rose on shaking legs as though he rose for the first time that day. Alexei reached over to hit his son then he hit him again. \"He hides money from me in my house!\" He hit him again. \"Money is wasted to give him food and clothing!\" He hit him again. \"You are no good to anyone not even your mother! I am glad she died so she didn't see what an insubordinate disobedient lying thief of a son she left me with!\" He lay another fist on top of his son but Ivan stopped it, not very well, but he managed to keep it from landing on his head. Alexei drew back in surprise as Ivan seized the opportunity to punch his father. Unlike the fight when he was 7, Ivan managed to get a few swings in. He wasn't overly impressive but he held his own for a 9-year-old boy fighting against his middle-aged father who was twice his size. As he punched his father, Ivan screamed at him all of the bottled up rage that lay hidden. \"Murderer,\" he yelled. \"You killed her! You broke her! I will kill you!\" He pounded on him again and again. The element of surprise plus the slower reflexes by the nonstop drinking binge caused Alexei to not react at first. When he did, he pulled his son off him and, like when the boy was 7, knocked him to the ground. He shook and was out of breath as he approached his son. His eyes were unfocused as though he were delirious and couldn't find his son. He swore and beat his son once before he fell to the ground. Despite what happened before, Ivan was terrified. Seizures ripped through his father's body as he collapsed on the ground. His mouth choked with vomit as some poured out of his mouth but Alexei began to choke and Ivan suspected some of the vomit remained inside his mouth. Alexei looked up at his son, his face flushed and his delirious eyes unfocused. \"Ivan help me please,\" Alexei begged. Ivan stepped back. He remembered his father's punches towards his mother. He purposely took a couple of slow steps backward to give his father false hope. \"Yes good boy, Ivan send for a doctor,\" Alexei pleaded, his body shaking constantly. Ivan remembered his father's laughter as his wife lay on the ground before her miscarriage and as his friends passed her around like a trophy and stripped her before they raped her. Ivan remembered his mother's tears as his father screamed at and struck her. Ivan deliberately stopped. \"Ivan,\" Alexei said. \"What are you doing boy? Send for a doctor.\" Alexei Drago winced as he realized that his son would do no such thing. Ivan stood over his father. He only said four words. \"Don't move. Stay silent.\" Alexei choked as blood and vomit emerged from his mouth. He soiled himself looking more disgraceful than Ivan had ever seen him. \"Damn you,\" Alexei hissed before he shook one more violent time as life was leaving him. Since neither of his parents had any living relatives, Ivan was sent to a state run orphanage. Because of his silent demeanor, many of the authorities thought the boy was in shock because of his father's death. After all they reasoned that it must have been a traumatic experience for a 9-year-old to be left alone as his father succumbed to alcohol poisoning right in front of him. They thought at first he was mentally deficient but after a week of him not responding and the instructors talking over him, Ivan said aloud, \"I am not mentally deficient.\" His answer settled that debate. The orphanage was understaffed and overcrowded. There were at least five children to a bed and the nights were filled with children quarreling over who got the most sheets or the biggest cut of food during meals.(Ivan quite often had the advantage.) Still there never was enough food to go around and the building was always noisy, crowded, and cold. Mikhail Berchenko, the director required the strictest discipline especially among the oldest orphans. They were required to stand and march in formation. They were discouraged from listening to music, posting pictures in their rooms, having personal possessions, or doing anything that showed individuality. There were many infractions and a penalty system was established so if an orphan disobeyed, then he would certainly be punished either by whippings, isolation, or other means at their display. Ivan once was caught fighting with another orphan. The other orphan, Yuri taunted Ivan about his mother. \"So where's yours?\" he asked. \"She's dead,\" Ivan answered. \"Probably of syphilis no doubt,\" Yuri laughed getting some of the bigger boys to laugh right along with him. Ivan didn't know what syphilis was but he knew his mother didn't die from it. \"No, she had a weak heart.\" The others laughed. \"No it was probably syphilis, that's how all whores die!\" \"My mother was not a whore!\" Ivan commanded. \"Of course, she was,\" Yuri said. \"How else did you end up here? How did any of us end up here?\" He was about to say more when Ivan sprang up and beat the other orphan. The loud cheers and shouts caused Berchenko to run at the sound. He pulled the two boys apart from each other. \"Now what is the meaning of this?\" \"Drago jumped me for no good reason,\" Yuri said. \"He called my mother a whore,\" Ivan shouted. \"Both of you will be punished,\" Berchenko commanded. The two boys were made to stand outside in the snow only in their boxers and undershirts in different shifts. Yuri went first. When it was Ivan's turn he elbowed him. Ivan made a fist but did not aim. The workers knew that none of the older children would ever be adopted so they accepted they would be there until they reached maturity therefore the adults were free to do whatever they wanted to do to them and that included physical, mental, and sexual abuse. Berchenko had his pick of which children that he engaged in private sessions. Every night he called one to his private chambers where they would be subjected to brutal torture including whippings, beatings, rape, and others. The children would do whatever they could to get out of it. Sometimes they begged or screamed to be left alone. Others would turn on other children hoping that Berchenko would go easy on them if it meant hurting another child. Sometimes Ivan would hear another child scream and cry during the night either because they were being abused or because they suffered from nightmares of it. Ivan never cried when it was his turn. He just accepted it and froze never saying anything or reacting. Instead just like with his father, he remained silent and defiant. Inwardly they frightened him but outwardly he would never show it. To admit fear was a sign of weakness and he would never do that never again. He lay awake during the night staring at the stars and thinking about people like his father and Mikhail Berchenko. His father was a weak man defeated by life and took that defeat out on his family. As much as he loved his mother, she was weak too because her love for her husband and her own regrets left her at his mercy. She never defended herself nor her son and while Ivan still loved her, he also began to hate her too for her vulnerability. Mikhail Berchenko gained power by abusing children. Ivan swore he would never be like any of them. They tried to make him feel powerless but instead Ivan felt stronger. That anger would fuel him and turn him into someone who could not be defeated, someone who had power, someone who would always be the victor. No Ivan Drago would not cry. Instead he vowed that he would train. He would fight. He would win. He would always win. Author's Note: 1. As Russian readers will know Vorobey is not an actual surname in Russia. It means \"sparrow.\" I thought since Sofia would marry a man whose family name was one letter off from dragon her name should also be an animal name to reflect her singing and fragile nature. 2. While not named the aria that Sofia performs when Alexei first meets her is \"The Doll Song\" from Tales from Hoffman. She is playing the part of Olympia, an automated doll who catches the eye of Hoffman, who is unaware that she isn't human. Her aria is sung as she winds down leaving her handler to wind her back up again. The opera is also referred to again when Sofia sings the part of Antonia, who as the narrative explains is caught between her love for Hoffman who wants her to give up singing for fear it may kill her and her love for her mother who was once an accomplished singer. 3. Nina Shirmataeva and Raissa Cohen are NOT original characters. They come from a YA novel that I read several times in high school called The Awakening. Nina is the protagonist who at the time was a young teenage girl during the Stalinist 1930's and went to a music and dance conservatory with the hopes of becoming and actress and singer. Raissa Cohen is her best friend, a premiere ballerina at the school. The book goes through Nina's youth as she is abused by her sadistic grandmother, cares for her weak-willed mother (much like Sofia), and has two romances one with Vakhtang, a film director while she is still a minor and he is a grown man and another with Viktor, a male ballet student who ultimately leaves her for another woman. (Who ironically is also named Ludmilla.) The book ends with Nina and Raissa deciding to live together and care for Raissa's mother who had been released from a Soviet prison after the death of her husband and Raissa's father. The book never comes right out and says whether or not Nina and Raissa are lesbians or have a lesbian romance but there is evidence to suggest that they might be. (While Nina is involved with two men as I said, Raissa's romances are never discussed and when Nina does get involved with Viktor, the dancer, Raissa reacts in a way that suggests she is extremely jealous. Also the last line of the book is Nina thinking about Raissa and her mother and saying that she \"had someone who loved her at last.\" 3. I enjoyed looking up Russian and Soviet Culture for this fanfic. It was a lot of fun looking up everything from district names, currency amounts, baby names, food, historic events, and mythological characters. I experienced much of it for the first time except one notable exception. I already knew of Ivanushka-Durachok, because my younger sister loved a Russian cartoon called The Magic Pony. (Or the Humpback Pony). Ivanushka-Durachok is the main character. I also knew of Grandfather Frost thanks to the MST3K episode . (\"Alright that's it. You just opened up a sled full of whoopass, Frost.\") 4. The repetitions of each chapter ending with \"Ivan would not cry\" is because this fic started out as a \"Five Times Ivan Drago Did Not Cry (And One Time He did)\" But this fic got too long and wordy for that, so I changed the format but I still liked the chapter endings since a lot of this fic deals with the theme of concealing and revealing emotion.[Chapter 2] The Unmistakable Fire A Rocky IV/Creed II Fanfic By Auburn Red II: Creed Ivan Drago looked down at the dying man before him. Apollo Creed lay on the ground, his body shaking with the last movements of life. Ivan thought how much it reminded him of his father, that shaking lifeless body. Ivan could look at him no longer. He answered the reporter's questions that he would not be defeated and he will soon fight a real champion. He looked down at Creed's body once more but no he had a job to do. He couldn't stop to feel anything now. But he did. He remembered the battles in Afghanistan where he shot at enemies but they were a mile or so away. They weren't up close and they were killed by guns and bombs not by his bare hands. Creed's trainer, Duke, and friend, Rocky Balboa, ran up to his body to see signs of life. He could hear the wail of Creed's wife, Mary Anne, from across the casino stadium. He remembered that desperation that he had when his mother miscarried hoping somehow she would be alright. No, he thought, this is a war and Apollo Creed is an enemy. We are not soldiers but we are still enemies. Do not think of him any other way. \"If he dies, he dies,\" he said flatly. He met the eyes of Rocky Balboa, the man he wanted to fight. He glared with such hatred and vengeance. The same way Ivan and his fellow soldiers looked on the battlefield. The way he looked at his father and the people at the orphanage. Balboa looked at Ivan as an enemy to be vanquished. So be it, Ivan thought returning the same stare to him. He would prepare for it the way he prepared for every fight ever since he left the army. After he left the orphanage, Ivan entered the military school and then joined the Soviet Army. There was no discussion of what he wanted to do with his life. Ivan was tested physically and mentally at the orphanage's accompanying school. When the evaluation determined that he fit the profile of a soldier in the Ground Forces Infantry, he accepted it. Inside he was just glad to be anywhere that wasn't the orphanage. It didn't take long for him to dislike the Soviet Army as much as the orphanage. Apart from the uniforms, there wasn't much difference between military education and training and his time in the orphanage: the fighting for anything, the conformity, even the punishments were all too familiar. As before, Ivan built up, trained, and remained stoic and quiet unable and unwilling to feel very much or show any outward emotion. He fought during the Soviet-Afghanistan War gaining quite a reputation for being a relentless but standoffish soldier. He participated in raids in the rural villages. He and other soldiers marched through the villages, looking for rebels and insurgents. They cut off supply routes, burned homes, and interrogated civilians to go after enemies. Many times Ivan and his fellow soldiers tortured and beat civilians for information: women, children, older people. People who should have no value to the soldiers but they did anyway. Ivan reacted to these raids with cold indifference unlike many of his comrades who delighted in them. When Ivan was ordered to shoot, he shot. When he was told to beat a captive, he beat the captive. He did his duties as a soldier but got no joy or remorse out of it. He didn't like his orders and felt that their actions were brutal and unnecessary. He just did them. He just fought. They are enemies of the people, he was told. Go after them or they will go after you. It didn't take long for Ivan to treat his actions on the battlefield with a mechanical detachment one that preferred not to feel a thing or act like he didn't. When he was filled with doubt or his nights were troubled by the memories of frightened faces and screaming voices, Ivan tried to suppress them. He forced himself to concentrate on his orders not how he felt about them. Some of the other soldiers teased him by calling him \"robot\" because he became very good at showing no emotion. Many of his comrades were not the same. Many of them delighted in the torture and killings. They were the types that would beat someone to death after they were ordered to quit. Ivan watched as some of his comrades took the younger females and gang raped them. Ivan never participated but he never spoke out against them either. He considered such behavior beneath him and it contributed nothing to the goal of catching insurgents. There was also a small part of him that remembered the times when his father's friends molested his mother or when he was molested at the orphanage. Those actions still filled him with a haunted loathing. Ivan never sought friendship from his comrades in arms. He never even referred to them by the term always referring to them by last name.\"Comrade\" suggested friendship and familiarity, things he didn't have. Some soldiers exchanged laughs over drinks which since technically alcohol was forbidden, the soldiers got really good at hiding vodka inside bottles of shoe polish and other liquids. Ivan did not drink often preferring to be as disciplined off duty as he was when he was on. A glass or two was enough but no more than that. Drinking too much made people, especially soldiers, out of control. Made them unstable, violent, useless. Made them his father. He was not there for social reasons to make friends, drink, and have a good time. He was there to fight, to please Russia. That's all he needed to do whether he wanted to be there or not. He rose through the ranks because of his relentless and reputation of being a blunt soldier. The promotions came because he proved his capabilities by firing on opponents, locating enemies before they fired, and never stopping. When he was promoted, he nodded but felt no real satisfaction. Even his Captaincy was not a cause for victory. It happened during a surprise raid. Unfortunately the mujahideen was alerted of their arrival because they were ready for them and started shooting. The result was a bloodbath as soon as they arrived. Many were shot including the captain and major both of whom died leaving the regiment temporarily leaderless. Sr. Lt. Ivan Drago instantly took command. He ordered the soldiers \"Strelyat!\" ,shoot, as another senior lieutenant, Alexei Baluk yelled, \"Otstuyplentiye!\" Retreat! \"You will shoot,\" Ivan said in command. Baluk, shouted. \"You can't order us about! You are not our commander! I will report you to the Ministry of Justice!\" \"You can report me to Yuri Andropov for all I care,\" Ivan declared. \"I give the order now!\" \"Who put you in charge?\" Baluk persisted. Ivan held up one finger getting irritated at this challenge in chain of command right at the moment when it was least important. \"Who put me in charge?\" He shoved Baluk to face the mujahideen across from them. \"They did! Now you pick up that gun and you fucking shoot the bastards!\" Rather than arguing any longer, Baluk and the others shot. They managed to fight back and succeed, but at a great cost. The regiment was almost completely wiped out. For his courage and determination in the face of battle, Ivan was promoted to Captain and was awarded the Order of Lenin for exemplary service. Ivan reacted with this promotion, the way he did with the previous ones with detachment and indifference not pride. Though he did take an internal smug delight that he outranked his father. He just looked forward to the day when he could leave the Army behind. While in the Army, Ivan also became like his father an amateur boxer. He fought his fellow soldiers in the ring to the loud cheers of his comrades as they passed money around. He had a reputation similar to his time in the battlefield of being a ruthless fighter who took his opponents out rather early. He began to see his opponents the way he saw his father or the orphanage directors as enemies to be defeated. He took delight that boxing wasn't something that was chosen for him. It was something that he had a genuine talent for, something that he took real pride in. He enjoyed the fighting in the ring much more than the fighting on the battlefield. Each time he won, Ivan considered it a victory to show the world and himself that he was unbent, unbroken, and undefeated. An indestructible master of war. After a match against Baluk that took place in Moscow during furlough, a short gray haired clean shaven gentleman greeted Ivan as he was about to head for the showers. \"Captain Drago my name is Sergei Vobet and I recruit athletes if I think they have potential and I think you could be on your way to becoming an Olympian.\" Ivan was skeptical but part of him was interested. He was never one to indulge in foolish daydreaming but he couldn't help but visualize himself on the platform with a gold medal around his neck. He visualized himself even more standing over a fallen opponent and holding the champion belt in his hands. \"You already have a fine reputation as the best boxer in the Army. With the assistance of myself and my trusted allies, you could be the best boxer in the Soviet Union even the world.\" Ivan offered a thin smile. \"I would like that,\" he said. Vobet gave the boxer his address and said that he hoped to see him there. Ivan arrived at the Vobet home and gymnasium in Khavamoniki. At first he knocked on the door but when no one answered he headed for the gym. Ivan's mouth dropped open in amazement at all the plaques, certificates, and pictures of athletes mounted on the walls and in trophy cases: everyone from gymnasts, to figure skaters, to martial artists, to football players, to swimmers yes even to boxers were represented. For an orphaned former street kid from the Kapotnya district this was amazing. It was as close as Ivan would ever be to royalty. A splash of water startled him as Ivan headed for the direction. He opened the door to see an Olympic sized swimming pool. A lone figure swam from one end of the pool to the other. She had a nicely sculpted body that he could tell was that of an athlete. She was dressed in a red and yellow swimsuit and a red swim cap. Ivan watched her move back and forth effortlessly like a mermaid or another mythological sea creature. He was aroused by the sight of her swimming unaware of the world around her. Ivan wordlessly watched the woman as she stopped and approached one end of the pool. For the first time she looked at her admirer. \"If you are here for the landscaping position then I regret to inform you that it has already been filled.\" Ivan stammered slightly embarrassed. He wasn't in uniform, so he could understand why she would make such a mistake. He stepped back. \"No I am here to see Sergei Vobet.\" The woman gave a cat-like grin. She exited the pool taking full advantage at her guest's amazement at her built body. She removed her swim cap revealing a short pert blond haircut. \"As you can see I am not Sergei Vobet,\" she said dryly. \"Now hand me a towel.\" Ivan pulled a towel from the rack and handed it to her. She began to dab at her wet body and rub her face. Ivan wanted to take her right then and there. \"What do you want with him?\" She asked. \"I was expected to meet with him,\" Ivan responded. \"My name is Ivan Alexeyevich Drago.\" The woman nodded. \"Ah yes, the boxer. Dyadya Sergei is expecting you. He will be back soon. Just wait while I shower and dress and I will take you to the house.\" The woman emerged dressed in a smart gray skirt and blouse. She beckoned Ivan to follow her. \"By the way I am Ludmilla Feodorovna Vobetova.\" Ivan nodded in recognition. He thought she looked familiar. \"You won the gold medals in 1976 and '80.\" \"That's right,\" Ludmilla said. \"Right now I am in training for 1984.\" Ivan followed her as she led him to their main room. Ludmilla motioned for him to sit on the ornate chair. The house was filled with antiques and portraits of ballet dancers and winter scenes. \"My aunt decorated the place which is probably for the best,\" Ludmilla said. \"If my uncle had his way it would just be full of exercise equipment.\" Ivan gave a smirk at her comment. Ludmilla sat as far from Ivan as possible and broke the ice by talking and taking out a cigarette. Ivan kindly relieved her of her lighter and lit the cigarette for her. \"An Officer and gentleman,\" Ludmilla said. Ivan was confused. \"It's an American film.\" \"How have you seen it then?\" Ivan asked. \"A lover of mine works in the black market,\" she said evenly. Upon a slight look of disappointment on Ivan's face she amended. \"Former lover.\" Now. This Captain Drago was incredibly handsome and from what her uncle said was quite talented. She didn't miss the enamored look that he gave her. She wasn't yet sure what to make of him but wanted to keep her options open just in case. Ivan knew what to make of her. She was beautiful and a dedicated athlete. Perhaps he could see her beyond training. The door opened and three men entered. \"Ah Drago,\" Vobet said. \"I see you met my niece, Ludmilla.\" \"Yes I have,\" Ivan said. \"He is quite the chatterer,\" Ludmilla said ironically. Volpet pointed at the two men next to him. \"This is Igor Sergei Rimsky, he is the trainer for the boxing team and this is Nikolai Koloff, he helps promote our athletes in front of the world.\" Koloff nodded. \"Yes and Vobet said you are a good fighter but we want to see for ourselves. We would like to see you in a few sparring matches.\" Ivan stood. \"Alright who do you wish me to fight?\" The three men and woman exchanged patronizing grins. Koloff spoke for them. \"That was not what we had in mind, Comrade Drago.\" Ivan's mouth dropped open at the sight of the gym before him. It looked more like a science lab with all of the machines and electronics. Ivan curiously touched a few. \"All of this is for boxing?\" They grinned. Koloff said, \"They are for all of our athletes. We want to create the ultimate athletes, those that can never be beaten.\" Rimsky pointed out some of the uses for the machines. One would monitor his heart rate. Another would be used to test his endurance. Still another would reveal the magnitude of his punches and many other uses that he wasn't sure about. \"It seems almost like you are training machines rather than men,\" Ivan said in admiration. \"Exactly,\" Koloff replied. They wanted to see how well he boxed. He sparred against a machine opponent. Ivan demonstrated his ability and quickly beat the robot. The three men stood silent as Ivan faced them from inside the ring. \"What do you think?\" Vobet asked. Koloff looked to Rimsky who nodded. Ludmilla's expression showed equal parts surprise, admiration, and lust. Definitely keep him interested, Ludmilla thought. \"Comrade Vobet, I think we have the Soviet Union's best boxer,\" Koloff said. The days were filled with training in the high tech gym. Ivan ran laps, sparred, and, exercised while the machines monitored his progress. He could see that he improved from his amateur status. He was impressed. He also spent a lot of time with Ludmilla. After a rigorous training session, he worked up the courage to ask her out for a drink at a cafe. His heart fluttered when she said yes. Ludmilla did most of the talking during their dates. Ivan realized that they had much in common. Like him, she too was an orphan. But unlike him, her parents died in a car accident when she was 11 months old and she didn't remember them. Also unlike Ivan, she was raised not cruelly in a state run orphanage but lovingly by her then-childless Aunt Tatiana and Uncle Sergei. In fact it was Tatiya Tania, a former Olympic swimmer herself, who taught her niece how to swim. \"They wanted me to be an athlete and a gold medalist so I am,\" she said with pride. Ivan couldn't help but be impressed. Ivan showed respect to her aunt and uncle. While Sergei boasted about his niece's boyfriend, Tatiana looked him up and down skeptically. She was a full figured woman but she still had the demeanor of a retired athlete. Her hair was blond and was tied back in a severe bun. She asked Ivan many questions about his family and background. Sergei and Tania followed their niece and her boyfriend as they walked outside. \"He will definitely be one that people will remember.\" Sergei said. Tania looked at the bracelet her husband gave her for her birthday. \"He could do quite well for us. Money, fame, power.\" Sergei said. \"I was thinking of the large picture. Here we have this young man came from nowhere, was nothing: orphaned, a street rat, grunt soldier, part of the system. Then we transform him into a superhuman, the best. He is proof that the system works and the world will see that. It is a benefit for the Soviet Union and for him.\" Tania nodded dryly. \"And the endorsements and recognition that Vobet Gymnasium receives by association in discovering him has nothing to do with it.\" Sergei nodded. He couldn't deny it. He fingered his wife's bracelet. \"There are many benefits and incentives in linking ourselves and Lyuda to a famous athlete.\" Tania laughed looking at her waved at the younger couple who waved back. Tania giggled at the childish \"go away\" expression on her niece's face. Tania already could tell that Ivan followed the girl around like a puppy. \"I think Lyuda is doing a good job of linking herself to him on her own.\" Ivan gave a polite half wave to Sergei. He was amused as Ludmilla waved grandly but made a disgusted face like a small child physically bidding them to go away. \"Not much privacy,\" Ivan asked dryly. \"Sometimes they are worse than the KGB when it comes to lyubovniki\" Ludmilla said. Lovers. \"Afraid that I may steal your virtue,\" Ivan kissed her boldly in front of Sergei and Tania. \"Under the circumstances,\" Ludmilla said placing her hand down his abdomen. \"I think they are more worried that I would steal yours.\" A clap of thunder filled the sky. Ivan and Ludmilla looked up as rain pelted down. \"We better go inside,\" Ivan said. He watched as Sergei and Tania walked back into the house. Ludmilla and Ivan were about to follow but Ivan gently held her back. \"Or we could avoid the watchdogs.\" The two lovers laughed as they ran into the rain. Ivan and Ludmilla ran hand in hand in the torrential downpour smiling and laughing. \"Come this way,\" Ludmilla said. She led him to an abandoned theater. She was about to open the door when Ivan held her by the waist and kissed her. They kissed again as they fell into the door. \"Come in here.\" Ludmilla said. Ivan followed her into the theater. Ivan looked around in amazement at the old film posters of such titles like the Battleship Potemkin, Ivan the Terrible, and Solaris. He could see the walls peeling and smell the mildew. \"How do you know this place?\" Ivan asked. \"A lover of mine used to take me here,\" Ludmilla said. \"Black Market Bela,\" Ivan asked remembering the boy who gave her American films. \"No another one Jerzy,\" Ludmilla said. Upon Ivan's long face she reassured him. \"Oh we are no longer together.\" As of last week. She took Ivan's hand and led him to the wall. His back was pushed against it as Ludmilla hungrily kissed him. \"You are quite experienced,\" Ivan guessed. Ludmilla smirked. \"My first time was when I was 15 during the Olympics in Montreal. It was with a boy on the Canadian team. We sneaked into the pool after hours.\" She slowly unbuttoned her blouse then reached for Ivan's sweater. Ivan pulled away. He felt himself grow cold. Unwanted sexual memories filled him. Berchenko stood on top laughing as the young boy lay like a stiff board underneath letting the orphanage director do whatever he wanted. \"It is a bit early for this.\" He buttoned up her blouse not wanting to admit the real reason. \"Are you experienced?\" Ludmilla smirked. Ivan turned his back on her. His silent response was her answer. \"You a soldier? I thought all you soldiers had your prostitutes or your village girls. You mean to tell me there is no half-Afghan child with extraordinary muscle, blond hair, and blue eyes wondering where his father is?\" \"Don't believe everything you hear,\" Ivan said. \"Or is it that I am the wrong gender,\" Ludmilla quipped. \"Perhaps it was the soldiers themselves you are more interested in.\" Once again Ivan didn't answer. \"Well which is it do you fuck women or don't you?\" \"You are very vulgar,\" Ivan said. \"And I want an answer,\" Ludmilla demanded. \"Alright,\" Ivan replied. \"I will tell you. You are not my first time, far from. My first was when I was 9 years old. It was with the director of our orphanage, the male director of our orphanage. I hated it. I hated that he had that much power over me. I felt sick, dirty, and violated. No one should take advantage of a child like that. He did that quite often and not just to me but to others. I froze. I froze, and that was the only way I could cope. He took advantage of me until I was 16 and left for the military school. I have not had sex with anyone since then not even during the War. You ask who I am attracted to. I suppose women. I have those feelings but don't act on them. I still freeze. I feel that way for you now that rush that I would like to have you, but I won't. There is nothing wrong. I am just….careful.\" Ludmilla at first looked serious but seemed distracted. Ivan wondered if she even comprehended. \"Maybe you just need someone to guide you.\" She unbuttoned her blouse once more then worked on his trousers. Ivan wanted to resist. He still felt frozen like he used to but something inside happened. He felt a sliver of longing that went beyond that. As she did her work, Ivan felt aroused. He lifted her head and kissed her. He then lay down next to her. A half hour later, Ludmilla lay in Ivan's arms. The two were nude. \"How was that?\" Ivan asked. \"Star pupil,\" Ludmilla said as she kissed him again. Ivan's training and developing relationship with Ludmilla gave Ivan a sense of hope. He accepted everything his trainers gave him. Nearly everything. When they suggested that his moniker be The Siberian Express or The Siberian Bull, Ivan objected. \"I am not from Siberia. I am from Kapotnya. I have never even been to Siberia except for military training.\" His three handlers glared at the boxer's objection. For a moment Ivan felt that his never having been to Siberia could be easily rectified. Koloff explained that the moniker is simply a promotional tool. \"Comrade Drago, it has to be easily remembered. No one will remember The Kapotnya Cat or some such,\" he and the others laughed. Ivan didn't. \"For example,the American boxer, Apollo Creed calls himself the Count of Monte Fisto. You do not think that he is a real count do you?\" Another laugh. \"Or that the Italian Stallion Rocky Balboa is a real stallion?\" More laughter. Ivan had the distinct feeling that they were making fun of him. \"We have to convey your strength, your power like a locomotive. That you are relentless like a bull and that you are as harsh, and as cold and unforgiving as the winters in Siberia.\" A more serious disagreement occurred later. One day Ivan trained like usual, but next to Rimsky, Koloff, and Ludmilla, a doctor appeared one that Ivan had never seen before. He held a needle in his hand and gave a slight prick on Ivan's arm before he jumped back in confusion. \"What is this?\" he asked. \"It's an anabolic steroid,\" the doctor, a man named Valentin Popov said. Ivan moved away in surprise. \"I don't need steroids.\" He said. He could understand if he was underweight but he wasn't. \"It will increase your skills,\" Rimsky said. \"You said so yourself that my skills are impressive,\" Ivan said confused. \"Impressive for the Army, maybe even for the Soviet Union\" Koloff said as if Ivan Drago was a slow witted child. \"That is not enough. You have to be the best in the whole world.\" Ivan said. \"\"The Olympics Committee would never allow this!\" \"They have looked the other way before,\" the promoter replied. \"They always look the other way. We also have ways of making sure you pass any examination and they are unable to detect it.\" Rimsky nodded. \"You want to win then you must do everything you can to win.\" Ivan stood up in fury. He looked around at this technological gym. He should have known there would be a catch. \"Not if I cannot win on my own terms.\" He marched out of the building with Ludmilla close behind. \"Ivan they are right. We have to be the best athletes and we have to prove it to the world. All of the Soviet athletes have done this at one time or another. It doesn't hurt. It gives you an adrenaline rush like you never have before. You feel a power from within like you could take on the whole world.\" Ivan whirled around to face his girlfriend. Her tone suggested that she had a first hand experience with the drug. \"Did they give them to you?\" He asked. Ludmilla at first didn't answer but upon Ivan's look changed her mind. \"I stopped taking them two years ago. They wanted me to stop so I could get them out of my system and eventually give birth to healthy children.\" Ivan was confused so she continued. \"They aren't just training us. They want to raise another generation of athletes. They want champions. You have to prove that you can win and best all competitors. We all do and to that we must make sacrifices.\" Ivan stood next to this woman. She was so certain. Ivan wished he could be. Ludmilla spoke again. \"You have two choices. You could be a regular boxer, train on your own, and be nothing more than ordinary, mediocre, a weakling, one who fights in taverns for coin or drink or you can be the best, strong, victorious, worshipped and admired by the whole world, and maybe even become the man that I see myself marrying.\" Ivan was agog. He secretly wanted to take his relationship with Ludmilla to a higher level, but it never occurred to him that she felt the same way. Ludmilla held out her hand. Ivan took her hand and walked with her back into the gym. From training to the matches. Ivan was quite relieved that the Army gave him permission to finish his military time with his boxing career. It made sense. It was a win for them as well that the premier Russian athlete was from their ranks. That he wore his uniform was a recruitment tool for potential young soldiers. Ivan faced his opponents with an ice cold demeanor that intimidated them. Sometimes he intimidated himself. He ended fights rather quickly and there were some opponents who he put into comas. Ludmilla was right about the steroids. Whenever he took them he did feel unbeatable and powerful like he could master the whole universe. He also could feel the extra pressure, everyone: his handlers, the press, even his girlfriend put on him. He was ordered to break his opponents and win every time. If he failed, his handlers implied that he could be imprisoned in Siberia on trumped up charges or he could be an outcast removed from his boxing status and be left to rot in obscurity like his father. For Ivan the message was clear: Break them or we will break you. Finally, the Olympics came. Ivan felt all of the eyes of the world bored themselves into him as he faced his opponents in the Los Angeles stadium. This was his first visit to America and with the little he had seen he was not impressed. It was loud, flashy, and given to excess everything that he had been taught to believe it was. He won and the moment that the officials put the gold medal around his neck and the Soviet Union National Anthem played was one he would never forget. As he sang along with the Anthem, his eyes met Ludmilla's as she grinned, her silver medal, won earlier, around her neck. Indeed it was the proudest moment of his life. Second proudest. At the closing ceremony the two joined their fellow Russian athletes in the circle, smiling and cheering. As the Olympic torch went out, Ivan leaned over and whispered in her ear, \"When we return to Moscow, will you marry me?\". She smiled, nodded, and kissed him. Their medals clinked together as their bodies joined in a loving embraced. After the Olympics, Ivan and Ludmilla were married in a private ceremony. Both were Atheists so they didn't bother with a church wedding. Just a few minutes in front of a justice with her family, Rimsky, Popov, and Koloff present. That night, the two consummated their love voraciously and passionately, two medal athletes bonded together by vows to love and honor each other. His success and marriage brought a whole new change as Ivan received more publicity than he was prepared for. He didn't like to speak much or be a public spectacle so he left the talking to either Koloff or Ludmilla who ended her swimming career to take charge of her husband's finances and to assist Koloff in promotion. While technically the Eastern Bloc forbade its athletes from competing on the professional level, the government paid handsomely if one could be shown as the perfect symbol of the Soviet athletic superiority. The result was that Ivan found himself very wealthy or as wealthy as the state allowed. He never cared much about money. Instead he preferred to live as modestly and austerely as possible. Ludmilla however enjoyed herself. The two moved to a larger apartment in Khavamoniki at her insistence. She began to wear jewelry and fancier clothes, and practiced several other languages like French and English so she could promote her husband worldwide. She confessed that she had seen the American television programs while in Los Angeles and Montreal during the Olympics and through her black market ex. Her favorite was Dynasty. \"I would love to live like those women,\" she said gushing. \"My wife the secret capitalist,\" he teased as he kissed her in bed. She laughed and kissed him back getting ready to mount his large body. \"Who knows maybe after the international professional fame, more money will follow.\" Ivan agreed, \" Da, Who knows?\" An earmark to this sudden change in Ivan's status was the powerful and influential people that began to rub elbows with him. He was invited to various social functions, but he felt uncomfortable and shy during them. He didn't speak until he was spoken to and only in monosyllables. This caused some dissension between Ludmilla and himself. \"Ivan could you at least pretend to enjoy yourself?\" She asked. Rather than answering back, Ivan didn't say anything. He just reluctantly attended the social events considering it another duty. For Ludmilla's part, she willingly spoke at these events on behalf of her introverted husband. She knew that he had potential to be a world champion and she dearly loved being at the arm of a successful up and coming man. He was handsome, strong, and while overly emotional was kind in his own way. He did whatever she told him to and bought whatever she wanted. Once she got him past his early sexual abuse, he proved to be a passionate lover. But there was an inherent dullness that she felt in her married life especially with a man who hardly ever spoke and wasn't always intellectually bright just a blunt instrument. Plus she became aware how much lower Ivan was to her. Alright yes in the Soviet Union everyone was supposed to be equal, but like many others Ludmilla was no fool. She knew that no matter the ideology, some people were always going to be considered a higher echelon than others whether people admitted it or not whether by money, status, power, or intelligence. She knew that she was ahead of her husband in intelligence, status, and power. All she needed was to be ahead of him financially. Ludmilla could outthink circles around him. It didn't take long for her to begin purposely covering up secrets just to see what she could get away with such as hiding her and Nikolai's flirtations and sexual byplay or spending just a little above her means. Ivan never said anything and she doubted that he noticed. It was at one of the social events that Nikolai introduced the Dragos to his younger brother, Yevgeny. \"He may just be an attorney now but he is on his way to becoming an ambassador.\" Nikolai said with pride. \"His circle is rather wide and influential.\" Yevgeny smiled. \"Yes Nikolai makes a point of watching people beat each other in the ring, I prefer to watch them beat each other at the Politburo.\" Many of the guests laughed. He shook Ivan's hand in a way that was overly friendly but also false. \"This is the pugilist I have heard so much about,\" he said. \"I am a boxer,\" Ivan corrected. Yevgeny smirked and Nikolai and Ludmilla laughed, though Ludmilla's was more embarrassed. \"You must be one of the smarter sportsmen,\" the attorney jibed. \"The terms pugilist and boxer are one and the same.\" Ivan glared embarrassed at his error but did not speak. \"Not much for words are you,\" Yevgeny said. \"My husband prefers to be a silent intimidating presence,\" Ludmilla said. \"Probably for the best,\" the lawyer quipped. Upon Ivan's stare, Yevgeny stepped aside as if to physically change the subject. He then looked at the blond woman. \"It appears that you are his spokesman,\" Yevgeny said. \"Comrade Drago has a very lovely voice.\" Ludmilla laughed as Yevgeny kissed her hand. \"You never told me your brother was so charming, Nikolai.\" Ludmilla remarked. \"You never told us you had a brother,\"Ivan pointed out. \"How did you know?\" Ludmilla laughed. \"Ivan, Nikolai and I work together. We do talk on occasion.\" Sometimes more. Ludmilla smiled at Yevgeny. He was average height, dark haired handsome in his own way but in a bookish academic way. She glanced between him and her husband, two completely different men but both could do different things for her. It might be best to keep both interested. \"It is a family trait,\" Nikolai boasted. \"You have seen the Games?\" Nikolai asked his brother. \"I have,\" Yevgeny said. \"We are rather fascinated and not just myself but the Premier's office as well.\" Ludmilla was amazed. Ivan's eyes widened. Nikolai was smug. \"I told you my brother is quite influential.\" Yevgeny continued. \"While he is impressed with Captain Drago's medal, when all is said and done the Olympics are an amateur athletics competition. Premier Gorbachev wants to see if Drago can beat a boxer on a professional level. Can he fight a heavyweight champion like Apollo Creed or even the current champion Rocky Balboa?\" The Dragos and Nikolai exchanged glances. \"Oh he can,\" Ludmilla said verbally expressing Ivan's confidence. A few months after his Olympic win, and after much legal wrangling and sociopolitical gymnastics, Koloff made arrangements for Ivan Drago to go to America to challenge the current heavyweight champion of the world, the American Rocky Balboa. \"Are you ready for this?\" Rimsky asked the young boxer. Ivan punched the training ball as the screen showed a rating of 1850 lbs. \"I am ready,\" he declared. If Ivan had intense pressure on him before, it was nothing compared to what he felt now. At the dinner before they were supposed to leave for America, Ivan was tense and nervous. Nikolai couldn't stop boasting about him talking about what a wonderful victory it will be. Ludmilla and her aunt squealed with delight about the jewelry and clothing they purchased with Ivan's earnings. Vobet answered questions dropping the name of his gymnasium every chance he got and displayed the cardboard cutout of Drago that would stand in the foyer of the gym. Ivan felt suffocated these days especially around Nikolai, Sergei, and Tania. As much as Ivan got along with his aunt and uncle by marriage, and respected his promoter they were starting to remind him of parasites or bloodsucking leeches that didn't mind living off the fame of others. He looked over at Ludmilla, but she did not meet his gaze. Was she the same way? Nikolai gently tapped his fork to the glass for a toast. \"I think we are all in agreement that we have found our champion. He has been educated, molded, shaped to fit our specifications and is the living symbol of what the Soviet athlete should be and when he defeats Rocky Balboa, he will prove to the world. Everyone will remember the name Ivan Drago! Zazdarovje. \" The other diners returned the cheer. Ivan felt extremely uncomfortable with the attention. He felt it even more so when one of the guests said to Ludmilla. \"Now all you need is to have your child become a champion and you will create a legacy.\" \"Oh we don't have children,\" Ludmilla said. \"Still it would be a wonderful thought to have any future child succeed in their athletic pursuits as much as their father and mother did in ours.\" Ivan lowered his head. He felt like he was some sort of a display, a thing, for everyone to gawk at. Now Ludmilla was planning on doing the same thing to another generation provided that they had one. He felt like he couldn't breathe. While the party wound down, Ivan stood outside the building looking up at the night sky. Ludmilla opened the door to see her husband standing in silence. \"You know Ivan it is considered impolite to behave standoffish at a party especially one where you are the guest of honor.\" \"I needed fresh air,\" Ivan said. Ludmilla grinned and sauntered closer to her husband. \"Just think in a few weeks time, you will return with a belt and a reputation as the greatest boxer in the world.\" \"It won't be a real championship,\" he reminded her. \"I cannot claim the belt or the title.\" The professional boxing commission and the Soviet government saw to that. \"But the prestige will change that,\" Ludmilla reminded him. \"Once your name is heard, our government will clamor to join the professional circuit. All you have to do is win.\" \"All we have to do is go over there you mean,\" Ivan said. \"You are celebrating too early, all of you are. Rocky Balboa hasn't even agreed yet. Suppose we go over there and he refuses.\" \"He won't refuse,\" Ludmilla said. \"He's a boxer. Would you refuse if someone challenged you?\" Ivan couldn't argue so she continued. \"Why are you so tense, Ivanushka? You are certain to win.\" \"Suppose I don't,\" Ivan said. \"Suppose I lose.\" Ludmilla rolled her eyes. Sometimes athletes had to be coddled told what they wanted to hear. \"You won't lose, Ivan.\" \"What if I do?\" Ivan said. \"What happens? I get sent to Siberia? I am abandoned? What about you, Lyuda? Would you stay with me if I lose?\" \"You won't,\" Ludmilla said more determined. Time to give a cold splash of reality. \"Ivan, do you really think there is even a possibility that you would lose? Do you think people like Nikolai and my uncle waste their time on a guess? As much training, equipment has been used? The drugs that you have been given? The Olympics proved nothing to you? You had been monitored since your time in the Army. Do you think that my Dyadya would have recruited you if there was even the slightest chance that you could ever be defeated? It was all a plan.\" Ivan sighed realizing that like in the orphanage and the Army, he was once again being used for someone else's gain. Even the sole thing he excelled at now would be tainted by the manipulations of others. Everything was planned. Ivan looked to his wife. \"And you? You were part of the plan?\" \"I was a benefit of it,\" Ludmilla said. \"Ivan you are still an excellent sportsman. No one disputes that. My uncle would not be interested if he did not think you were great. We just wanted to make sure that the advantage was always on our side.\" Ludmilla rubbed her husband's shoulders. \"Now come on, Ivanushka, let's celebrate before we leave for America.\" Ivan let go. \"Not tonight, I need to prepare.\" Before Ludmilla could protest. Ivan turned on his heels and left apologizing. Ludmilla fumed. She turned around and was about to return to the party when a whistle caught her attention. \"Trouble with your husband?\" Yevgeny Koloff asked dryly. Ludmilla could tell he was drunk. \"It is not your concern.\" \"Well if I were with a beautiful woman like you, I would never leave her alone at a party,\" Yevgeny said. \"He has much to do in the morning,\" Ludmilla said in defense of her husband. \"Of course big fight, big match, big nerves,\" Yevgeny mocked. \"You know without those muscles Ivan Drago is no different than the doorman at this club. Just a common muscular half-wit with plenty of good publicity. Oh the Athletics have done quite a bit for us, I will admit. We are known throughout the world for them but to waste all of your time on someone like him, someone so stoic, so dull, so common. It's almost embarrassing.\" Ludmilla was about to turn away again when Yevgeny's words made her stop. He said what she had been thinking all along. When it came right down to it there really was nothing special about Ivan Drago at all. \"You know the only reason he is worth anything is because of you,\" Yevgeny said. \"You speak for him. You build him up and what do you get out of it?\" \"I get my share,\" Ludmilla objected. \"But clearly not enough,\" Yevgeny said. \"Not enough money, not enough attention, not enough power.\" \"No not enough,\" Ludmilla agreed. \"But I suppose that is often the case of the wife of a professional athlete,\" Yevgeny said. \"One who deserves more than her husband is willing to give her.\" He approached her but then was about to turn around. \"Yevgeny,\" Ludmilla said. The lawyer turned around to face her. \"Do one thing for me.\" \"Anything,\" Yevgeny said. \"I would like to spend the remainder of the night not talking about my husband,\" Ludmilla said as she leaned over to kiss him. \"What husband?\" Yevgeny asked as he held Ludmilla by the waist and led her to his car. It was a surprise that Ivan would not battle Balboa but the former champion Apollo Creed. Ivan viewed Creed's matches against various opponents particularly his two against Balboa. Creed was an impressive fighter it was true: quick, fast, and was able to achieve his wins with sharp movements and quick cuts. But he was old and only recently out of retirement. He was also flashy and given to bombast and show. Ivan recognized that with his first match against Balboa in which he arrived dressed as George Washington. He appeared to underestimate his opponents. That conceit could prove to be a downfall. Ivan's assessment of Creed was proven correct at the press conference. While Ludmilla and Koloff engaged in verbal fights with Creed, and Creed volleyed back, Ivan sized him up. He was such a loudmouthed fool that he refused to see that he could ever be defeated. Ivan simmered with hatred for the man, who to him seemed to symbolize all of America's decadence. He ripped the cardboard cutout hoping that he would do the same to Apollo Creed. The opening of the exhibition was a joke, just like Creed, Ivan thought. The lights, the special effects, the dancing girls, the singer whom Ivan was told was James Brown the Godfather of Soul, and Creed dancing next to the bull wearing that red, white, and blue hat and cape. It was overwhelming and ridiculous. Ivan didn't know what to make of this bizarre spectacle that was less of a fight and more like a circus. Why didn't they just punch each other like they did in Russia instead of resorting to this foolish show? If Creed wanted to intimidate Ivan Drago with this jingoistic performance then it wasn't working. This decadent overblown display only proved Ivan right that Apollo was a fool for not taking this match seriously. Only when they touched gloves and Apollo winced in pain at Ivan's strong hands did he show real fear and intimidation. \"You will lose,\" Ivan said stating a matter-of-fact that he knew would be correct. At first Ivan didn't realize what happened when he connected his final punch to Apollo Creed. He was so caught up in the ice cold rage that he always felt in the ring, that it didn't at first register what happened until he saw Creed fall and not rise again. Later that night as Koloff, Ludmilla, and the others were celebrating, Ivan stared out the window of the hotel room and glanced out at the Las Vegas skyline. He had already received threatening looks from the hotel staff and found a message that simply said \"Murderer\" taped to their door. Ivan crumpled it up and threw it away. They also received so many threatening phone calls that Ivan took the phone off the hook. He listened to the laughter and applause from the next room as Koloff complimented Ludmilla that her husband delivered on his promise. Ivan did not join them. He told them that he wanted to be alone to mentally prepare to battle Rocky Balboa who challenged Ivan for a rematch. So it appeared that Ivan Drago would fight the heavyweight champion of the world after all. Ivan should have been celebrating. But he wasn't. He couldn't get that image of Apollo Creed out of his mind. The final shaking as life left him, the blood around him, that stillness from a man who earlier was full of life and energy and never stopped talking or moving. He looked down at his hands, so strong so powerful. Less than 24 hours ago they killed a man. Ivan killed a man. He was an enemy Ivan told himself. He is no one to me. But he couldn't make himself believe it. The door opened and Ludmilla entered very tipsy from the celebration. \"Hello my victorious Ivanushka. Celebrating your win?\" Ivan didn't answer. If she wanted to think that's what he was feeling then let her. After all he did win. He did prove that he was the strongest best boxer in the world. His fight with Rocky Balboa would only confirm it. Ludmilla didn't say anything. Instead she just undid his trousers and his boxers. She knelt down and began performing oral sex. Ivan looked downward giving a surprised and aroused moan. He knelt down and kissed his wife undoing her blouse. The two made intense love. Later that night Ivan and Ludmilla lay in bed their arms wrapped around each other. Ludmilla lay asleep her head on top of her husband's chest. Ivan thought once more about the match against Apollo Creed. He felt a wave of emotion coming through but he stifled it. Instead he thought of Rocky Balboa and how he was looking forward to beating him. No Ivan Drago did not cry over Apollo Creed. To him, he was his enemy. But he never could get Creed's dying body out of his mind. Author's Notes: I drew on various sources for Ivan's experiences during the Soviet Afghanistan War. Even the anecdote about Russian soldiers hiding alcohol in other liquids is based on an article. For the Afghan perspective on the War, I highly recommend the book The Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini. Alexei Baluk's name comes from a character from the video game Rocky Legends. I never played it and am not a gamer. I don't know if the game matches up with the movies but I thought the fans might like this little tip of the hat. The line where Ivan refers to himself as an \"indestructible master of war\" comes from the Disturbed song Indestructible which was a huge inspiration for writing about Ivan's time in Afghanistan. Also there is an obvious reference to another Dolph Lundgren character when after he is first given steroids, Ivan feels powerful like he could \"master the universe.\" The line \"why didn't they just punch each other like in Russia instead of resorting to this foolish show?\" Is a variation of a line from the Nostalgia Critic's review of Rocky IV. Critic (mimicking Drago watching \"Living in America\"): \"I don't know what you guys normally do but in Russia we just punch one another\"[Chapter 3] The Unmistakable Fire A Rocky IV/Creed II Fic By Auburn Red III. Viktor Ivan smiled at his newborn son wrapped in his arms. Ludmilla was asleep. Because of the difficult delivery, they had pumped her so full of drugs that she was out cold. No matter she would wake up later. In the meantime, Ivan could enjoy this little miracle that he held by himself. He was dark haired but Ivan had no doubt that this was his son. The dark hair and eyes were those of his father. The infant's grandfather. The small red faced infant opened his eyes and looked about ready to cry. Ivan gently shushed him and held him close. He was so small so fragile. He barely covered one of his father's large hands. Ivan was almost afraid that he would carelessly break him. He kissed the top of his son's head. \"I won't break you,\" he vowed. He remembered his mother's words about how he had to find his own victory. \"You are my victory,\" he whispered to the newborn as the boy gave a pleased sound. Viktor that would be his name. Viktor Ivanovich Drago. Ivan would do everything in his power to make the boy worthy of that name. Ludmilla woke up from her drug induced slumber to see her husband whispering to the little one. It was almost hilarious to watch the intimidating giant who sent fear down his rival's spines with just a mere stare cooing to an infant. \"Ivan,\" she said. Ivan kissed his wife. \"How are you feeling?\" He asked. \"Terrible,\" she sighed. \"Weak.\" \"You are wonderful,\" he said. \"So is Viktor.\" \"Is that his name?\" Ludmilla asked. \"It seems appropriate,\" Ivan suggested. \"But if you would prefer something else.\" \"No that's fine,\" Ludmilla said. \"It makes sense. He is the only victory you have had all year.\" Ivan winced at his wife's sharp criticism. He really didn't need it now. \"Hold him please,\" he asked. \"What for?\" Ludmilla asked. Ivan shook his head slightly confused at his wife's lack of enthusiasm. It was on the tip of his tongue to say because you're his mother. He handed Viktor back to his wife. \"You aren't taking my picture now are you?\" She asked just as Ivan took out a camera. \"Ivan you can't. I look terrible.\" \"You never looked more beautiful,\" Ivan said. Ludmilla shook her head and laughed but complied. Ivan was usually not one for sentiment but she supposed that parenthood melted the hardest of hearts. She held Viktor as Ivan snapped a photo of her and the infant. Ivan then returned the camera back to his pocket and relieved the infant from his wife. They sat in silence so many harsh words once said now hovering in the air. Ivan hoped that this would be a new fresh start for the three of them. Ironically, Ludmilla wanted the same but by different means. \"Dr. Davidov told you didn't he?\" Ludmilla asked. Ivan nodded. \"You must rest and not think about it.\" \"But now that my thyroid is a mess and not to be able to have any more,\" Ludmilla said. Her pregnancy and Viktor's delivery took a tremendous toll on her body. The doctor told her that more children were not possible. \"Then we have one and he is just fine,\" Ivan said. \"It makes him even more special.\" Ludmilla's eyes filled. \"It's the drugs really,\" she insisted. She couldn't understand. Why did she have two completely different men in her life? One who had much promise and was now a proven failure but clearly loved that child. The other a political success who promised her a life of untold wealth but wanted nothing to do with the child. Why couldn't she have all that with one man? Why in the world couldn't Ivan deliver on his promise? That would make her life simpler. She would be married to a success and she could have fun on the side occasionally. She remembered when the doctor told her that she was pregnant. At first she was in denial but then she accepted it. She hadn't used contraceptives the nights that she slept with Yevgeny or Ivan. The timing couldn't be worse. She slept with both so close to each other, one before the match against Apollo Creed and one after. She wasn't even sure who the father was. She could have an abortion. She had one before when she was 16. But she decided to discuss it with the father first, whichever one he was. She first decided to tell Ivan. She was concerned as she saw him running laps focusing preparing for his match against Rocky Balboa. KGB officials reported that Balboa was doing the same chopping wood, lifting hay bales, even running across mountain tops. The last report stated that Balboa's wife, Adrian (a frumpish American with no sense of style, Ludmilla thought) had arrived. If Ivan was still nervous about his chances of beating Balboa he didn't say. He just trained and worked hard. Ludmilla was confident that he would win. The machines made his endurance even stronger and he was pumped with so many steroids that it was a wonder that he didn't overdose. There is no way he would lose. Might as well add one more bit of dessert to the celebratory meal. To let the future Heavyweight Champion of the World know that he was going to be a father. Ivan wiped the sweat off his face at first still in the zone when she told him. It took a half second but when it did, the biggest smile spread across his face. She had literally never seen such joy on his face. \"A father,\" he said. Then he did something else uncharacteristic: He picked Ludmilla up, swung her around, and laughed. \"How many months are you?\" \"One almost two,\" Ludmilla answered. Ivan's face had a sense of wonder. \"Really? That means he was conceived-\" \"- while we were in America yes,\" Ludmilla replied. \"This is a second chance,\" Ivan said kissing his wife. \"I beg your pardon?\" Ludmilla asked. \"Oh it's nothing,\" Ivan said. He could not tell her that he was still haunted by Apollo Creed's death. The shouting. The people running around. Rocky and Duke's desperate actions. Mary Anne's wail. The shaking body. The blood. Now to find the child was conceived after Apollo Creed died? Ivan thought how fitting that timing was. Less than a day after ending one life, Ivan was responsible for creating another. In a way Ivan hoped that the baby's life would somehow make up for the loss of Apollo's. \"He will have a wonderful future ahead of him,\" Ivan promised. \"With a victorious father,\" Ludmilla said. Ludmilla had less success when she told Yevgeny. Actually, she made one mistake: she told Ivan in front of Nikolai and Nikolai Koloff told the press. It wasn't big news in light of the upcoming match. (The doctors even said Ludmilla wouldn't be showing by then so it wouldn't be noticeable.) But it was still enough to get tongues wagging and to reach the ears of an ambitious young lawyer with sights set in the political arena. \"I wanted to tell you first,\" Ludmilla insisted. \"Well my brother saved you the trouble,\" Yevgeny said dryly as he handed Ludmilla a set of jewelry that he purchased for her. \"What does Death from Above think of all this?\" \"Don't ever call him that name in front of him,\" Ludmilla warned. \"He hates it. It's just as bad as calling him Ivanushka-Durachok.\" \"Well he earned it didn't he?\" Yevgeny retorted. \"Anyway he's overjoyed,\" Ludmilla said. \"When he's not training, he is selecting furniture and other things for the infant. Right now his first priority is the match against Balboa. Second the child. Though I have a feeling the child will move ahead afterwards. Last me.\" \"What is the matter with that man?\" Yevgeny said. \"Exactly,\" Ludmilla said missing his faint sarcasm. \"Lyuda, I have to ask are you certain that it is his?\" Yevgeny asked. \"I don't know,\" Ludmilla said honestly. \"If it were yours what would you do? Would you claim it?\" Yevgeny looked serious. \"You know I can't claim it as mine while you are married to Drago. We are all public figures. The scandal would be too great. It would ruin all of us and if word gets around that I am sleeping with Ivan Drago's wife and is potentially the father of his wife's child well-\" Ludmilla didn't miss the look of petrified terror on her lover's face. \"Coward,\" Ludmilla hissed. \"Suppose I don't claim it as yours. Suppose it's Ivan's. If nothing else I claim it as his. Ivan wouldn't dare challenge that. He is too excited about the prospect. Suppose I divorce him then.\" \"You can't divorce him while you are pregnant,\" Yevgeny said. \"It's still a scandal and you will receive nothing from it. All financial gains go to him.\" \"To him?\" Ludmilla said angrily. \"I earned that money just as much as he did! Speaking for him, promoting him, going from one press conference after another! I worked twice as hard as he did!\" Privately, Yevgeny thought that Ivan Drago would probably dispute that claim but he didn't want to anger his mistress. \"I am afraid so.\" \"So I'm stuck with him,\" Ludmilla said. \"That durachok?\" \"I'm afraid so for at least nine months,\" Yevgeny said. Ludmilla looked crestfallen but he tilted his chin. \"Remember there is still the big match against Balboa.\" \"How could I forget?\" Ludmilla said. Once Ivan won, her affair with Yevgeny Koloff will fade into the background. True she would still be stuck married to Ivan but as famous and rich as they will be after the match, it won't matter. He would be too busy training, boxing, and probably caring for that unplanned interruption that just made Ludmilla's life more difficult. He wouldn't notice if Ludmilla worked late, missed appointments, and scheduled late night meetings with Yevgeny Koloff. If not him, then others. Both Ivan and Ludmilla had plans for a brighter future after the match. Unfortunately what neither of them counted on was a determined feisty Italian-American boxer from Philadelphia. Neither of them counted on Rocky Balboa. The fight against Balboa was awful. Ivan started out strong but the more Rocky continued the more his opponent began to weaken. He had to admire the American's perseverance and tenacity. He had seen his fights against Creed and Clubber Lang, even the exhibition match against Thunder Lips. That's what they all spoke about Rocky Balboa's relentlessness and refusal to surrender. Being at the opposite end, Ivan could believe it. Of course admiration did not equal satisfaction with his loss. Ivan kept going over and over in his head what he could have done differently. Did he fake left instead of right? Should he have started strong not giving Balboa a chance to seize the advantage? All of the what ifs came through his mind. It angered him that he could be so well trained and at the same time so unprepared. Along with the anger came the hatred towards Rocky Balboa, another enemy. He humiliated him in his country. Ivan vowed if he saw him again he would repay that one thousand fold. Not only did Ivan keep torturing himself with questions, doubt, and hatred towards his opponent but he received no support from his handlers, the Russian people or the press, even his own wife. Pravda called the match an embarrassment and a shame brought to the Soviet Union even wondering if somehow Ivan Drago was secretly working for the Americans to make Russian athletes look bad. They also didn't take too kindly to that, \"I fight to win for me!\" declaration. How dare he set himself above the Russian people?, they asked. Everywhere he went, people spat in his direction. He was restricted from competing in major events only participating in a few smaller matches but the crowds booed him. One incident after a match, Ivan exited the gym as a couple of other athletes, Lev and Pyotr followed him. Ivan's head was swimming from the steroids and the tension. He barely listened as one said to the other loud enough for him hear, \"Hey did you hear Ivan the Terrible was really Ivanushka-Durachok?\" Lev said. Pyotr smirked. \"Da, when he tried to fuck his wife she told him 'I fuck to win for me!'\" They laughed. Ivan ignored them but they continued to wheedle him. \"Maybe he could fuck Balboa then. He already did in the ring,\" Lev said. Ivan turned around to face him. \"Tishina,\" Ivan warned. Silence. \"Or what you'll kill me like you did Apollo Creed,\" Lev mocked. \"If you could even strike like that again Death From Above.\" Lev didn't get any farther when Ivan punched him. Lev retaliated by punching him back. The two tumbled to the ground as Ivan continued to pummel him. They only stopped when the police appeared. Sergei Vobet arrived to drive his nephew by marriage home. Ludmilla was on vacation at a health spa with her aunt. \"I won't tell my niece,\" Sergei said quietly. \"Thank you, Sergei,\" Ivan said. \"I didn't do it for you,\" Sergei snapped. \"I did it for my niece, my family! She is going through a hard enough time as it is being married to such a failure!\" \"I know,\" Ivan snapped. \"Just so you know, my wife and I have removed your name and pictures from the gymnasium,\" Sergei said. \"We cannot afford to be stained with your reputation.\" Ivan sighed. \"I understand, I am sorry that I failed you and your family.\" \"You have failed all of us,\" Sergei snapped. \"We relied on you, Ivan. We expected better from you! What happened? The crowd cheered for him! You denounced the Politburo right in front of them! That's how much you failed! You were supposed to be proof that our system works!\" \"Then maybe I am proof that it doesn't,\" Ivan suggested slowly. Sergei slammed on the brakes and glared at the young man, his face red. \"It has always worked before! The system is not the problem! You are!\" Ivan glared. He wanted to toss him aside like he did Nikolai, but a few things stopped him namely he was his wife's uncle and that it wouldn't be very bright to inflict physical harm on the driver of a moving car. \"Tania and I advised our niece to divorce you. For now she wishes to remain in the marriage but you are dead to us!,\" Sergei declared. \"Neither you nor your future offspring exist. My family will not be tainted with defeat!\" \"It will be her offspring as well,\" Ivan argued. \"I assure you that will not be her problem,\" Sergei said as he dropped Ivan off at the apartment. He spat at Ivan's feet and drove away. Ludmilla wasn't any help either. When she returned from the health spa, she glared at her husband. She said a few words in interviews that conveyed love and support but as soon as the reporters left, she withdrew her hand from his and snapped at him when he tried to kiss her. \"You sleep over there,\" she insisted pointing to a room across from hers. \"You are my wife,\" Ivan insisted. \"In name only,\" Ludmilla said and pointed at her abdomen. She was still angry that she was stuck married to the proven failure for life and had no way out. Well she was not going to be happy about it. \"I play the devoted wife until this comes out of me! After that we go our separate ways.\" \"Lyuda please,\" Ivan begged knowing that she was threatening to leave him. \"I cannot lose you too. I love you.\" Ludmilla gave a hard brittle laugh. \"Oh Ivanushka,\" his diminutive name sounded more like a curse word, a sneer rather than a term of endearment. \"I do not love you. I cannot love a man that I do not respect.\" That fight was the beginning of more fights or rather fights that Ludmilla had towards Ivan. She railed and yelled at him for things he did and didn't do. She didn't use fists but she cut him down to size with her words. One particular fight occurred after another argument about money. She returned home sporting a pair of large diamond hoop earrings. \"Isn't that a bit too extravagant,\" Ivan asked. Ludmilla admired her reflection in the mirror. She still looked good and fit. Ivan was as well but the stress of the past few months was starting to wear on him. He was beginning to be lined around the eyes and his posture sagged. He went from God to mortal in a matter of months. \"They didn't cost that much.\" She said. \"It is wasteful when we are about to become parents,\" Ivan said. \"We must watch our money.\" Ludmilla turned around. \"Really Ivan? Whose fault is that? You know we may have had more money if you had won!\" \" I know it's my fault,\" Ivan said. \"I failed! I failed Russia, your family, and my wife! I admit it! I regret it! I would give anything to take back that night and stop Balboa from winning! I would give anything to keep Creed from dy- uh keep others from using Creed's death as propaganda! I would dearly love to continue boxing, face another opponent, and never have to hear about that night and to never have to hear the name Rocky Balboa again! If everyone will allow me to forget it, I could continue! What more can you possibly want from me?\" \"No one will ever let you forget that!\" Ludmilla shouted \"You aren't the only one who wishes they could take something back! What a fool I was to marry such a weakling of a man! If my dear Dyadya Sergei knew what a failure you would turn out to be, he would have left you in the Army, no put you back in Kapotnya, where you belong!\" Like in the fights with his father, Ivan just accepted it never speaking never letting her know how hurt and angry she made him. He just stared which made Ludmilla laugh. \"Ivan, your stare may intimidate others but it does nothing to me!\" She also started on their unborn child. \"This had better succeed! If I find that it is anything like it's weak and foolish father, I would drown it in the Moskva!\" Ivan flashed at that. He clenched a fist and held it in the air. Ludmilla stepped back terrified realizing that she had gone too far. He wanted to punch her but then he remembered how his father hurt his mother. How his punch caused her to miscarry and broke her heart and spirit. He also remembered Apollo's shaking body. He lowered his hand knowing that he would not could not be responsible for taking another life especially that of his unborn child and his mother. \"I will never hurt you, Lyuda.\" He said as he pulled his wife closer. Ludmilla accepted but did not return the embrace. Ivan would love his child and continue to love its mother. \"I want to divorce him,\" Ludmilla argued with her lover. \"You are a lawyer think of something!\" \"I told you if you divorce him now it will only create a scandal and you would suffer the consequences and you would end up with nothing!,\" Yevgeny explained. \"Then I will divorce him after the baby is born,\" Ludmilla said. \"I will take the baby and his earnings. He will be left with nothing. It is what he deserves after he humiliated me!\" Me, Yevgeny mentally noted. Ivan humiliated Ludmilla not Russia. \"You will be left without any money,\" Yevgeny said. \"Divorce laws would never permit you to receive money earned by your husband.\" Ludmilla growled in frustration. \"So I leave him I get nothing!\" Yevgeny nodded. \"It seems that way. The only way you can get his money is to steal it.\" \"What was that?\" She asked. \"Well you are in charge of your husband's finances,\" Yevgeny said. \"If you could put him up to giving it to you and you transfer it elsewhere well technically, it becomes the holdings of that party namely you.\" Ludmilla considered. \"I have done a few things here and there in the past. Nothing serious but in private I skimmed a little, withheld some by telling Ivan he made less than he did.\" \"He never checks,\" Yevgeny inquired. \"He's a fool and he trusts me so no,\" Ludmilla said. \"It will be good. I get his money and the child and I leave him.\" Yevgeny started. \"This is the second time you mentioned taking the child.\" \"Of course I will take it,\" she said. \"I am its mother.\" \"Lyuda, I love you. I want to give you everything and when you are free to wed, I look forward to becoming your husband. There is a lot more here than what you could ever get from Drago. I almost live like a Westerner as wealthy as I am. But nothing has changed in one respect. I cannot claim that child as my own,\" Yevgeny said as Ludmilla was about to speak he interrupted. \"Nor will I raise another man's child if it is his.\" \"So what are you saying?\" Ludmilla asked. \"I keep you but I lose my child?\" \"And if you keep your child then you lose me and everything I could offer you,\" Yevgeny said. Ludmilla thought torn between the two options. When she was growing up, she read Anna Karenina several times. She had seen various film versions even the Hollywood versions. It never occurred to her that she would live that story in reality. Well she was not going to throw herself in front of a train for this. She would have to think and consider. At first Ivan didn't think that his handlers had any issues. True, they reduced his time at the gym often leading him to workout at a regular gym. When he did work out there, Rimsky and Koloff ignored him often speaking to the younger boxers. He didn't realize the implications until one day, several months later, when he appeared ready to suit up and Rimsky told him that it wouldn't be necessary. Koloff wasn't there. He was the sort of man who preferred weddings to funerals. \" I am still allowed to train am I not?\" he asked. \"No Drago you are not permitted to train here,\" Rimsky replied. \"These facilities are closed to you as is the Soviet Athletics Program for now. You are officially suspended.\" \"For how long?\" Ivan asked. \"Until we see fit to reinstate you,\" Rimsky said in a tone that seemed to suggest \" maybe never.\" Ivan gave a mirthless laugh. \"That's ridiculous.\" He was about to move forward but a pair of the younger boxers stopped him. Ivan looked around. The gym seemed smaller somehow what could it be? Then he realized what it was. The injections, drugs, even the table in which Dr. Popov administered the steroids were gone and so was Dr. Popov. \"Where is Dr. Popov?\" Ivan said. \"I need my injection. You are still going to give me that at least?\" He still received his daily injection. Sometimes that was the only positive release he had all day. Rimsky pretended to look confused. \"Who is Dr. Popov? What injections? We don't give those to you.\" Ivan couldn't believe it. Was he going insane? \"Of course you do! You give them to me once a day now where are they and where is the doctor?\" Rimsky glared and pushed himself forward gripping onto Ivan's arm. Not for nothing did Igor Sergei Rimsky train boxers. He himself had been an Olympic medalist back in the day. \"I suggest you not mention those injections or anything of that nature ever again, not if you wish to keep boxing,\" he commanded. \"You are no longer welcome here, now leave before I have you thrown out!\" Ivan's eyes flared. Igor Sergei Rimsky may have been a heavyweight boxing champion once but he was still a former heavyweight boxing champion and no match for a younger stronger athlete. Ivan glared giving Rimsky the same glare he gave Koloff in the ring. He said nothing instead he just threw his former trainer to the ground and walked away. Ivan kicked his steroid addiction that night alone. He returned home feeling the sweat cover him. Already the shakes were beginning. Ludmilla was dressed like she was on her way out. \"Ivan you look awful \" she said. \"I am suspended from boxing,\" Ivan said dully. His mouth felt dry. \"They….won't give me my injection.\" \"What injection?\" Ludmilla said. \"Ivan, have you been taking illegal drugs?\" Ivan's eyes widened. \"You know I have! You told me that you took them yourself!\" \"I don't know what you are talking about,\" Ludmilla said. Ivan felt sick. The confusion made him feel worse. Was he going insane? He was certain Ludmilla knew about the steroids. She had taken them. \"You're lying to me,\" Ivan said feeling his body shake. \"Lyuda please help me! I need them! I need you!\" He held his wife's arms as she pulled away. \"If you got yourself into something on your own then that is not my problem!' Ivan watched in dismay as his wife opened the door. \"Where are you going?\" \"Out,\" Ludmilla said. \"Don't wait up for me!\" She slammed the door amidst her husband's cries of her name. For the next two days, Ivan suffered the agonizing withdrawals of quitting cold turkey. Ludmilla wasn't around. He writhed in bed, sweating, vomiting, and craving the steroids more than anything else. He longed to put the needle once more in his arm and feel that rush, that power or at least to die in the attempt. What the hell? He had nothing now. The Russian public mocked him. His handlers washed their hands of him and were now going through the process of pretending like he didn't exist. His in laws disowned him. He was married in name only now, what did he have left to live for? He tumbled out of bed and panted feeling his whole body shake. Was this what it felt like to die? Was this how his father felt? Apollo Creed? To be at the end of your life and to feel you have accomplished nothing? He then remembered: he had something or would have something. He had a child. That baby growing inside his wife deserved to have his father alive and there to greet him. He would not could not die or be a burden on his child the way that his father was to him with his alcohol addiction. He had to survive and he had to kick. For his child, he had to fight his addiction and he was going to. In a way, he felt that child's spirit encouraging him and giving him strength to fight and succeed. Ludmilla went into labor in her eighth month. She had one of her regular shouting matches with her husband then fell over in pain. Ivan took her hand but she refused at first. For a brief second, Ivan had a flashback of his mother's miscarriage, but it passed. He sprang into action and called for a doctor. Then he carried his wife out of the apartment and took her to the hospital. It was a difficult labor and Ivan sat in the waiting room in despair afraid that he would lose his wife, the baby or both. Finally the doctor appeared and told him that his wife gave birth to a baby boy who while underweight was extremely healthy. His mother however was still very weak and because of the thyroid damage this child would end up being her only child. Viktor and Ludmilla were sent home within a few days. There were a lot of adjustments in getting used to having a newborn in the house. Ivan tumbled out of bed almost as soon as he heard Viktor crying. Since Ludmilla still needed rest from the delivery, Ivan opted to let Viktor sleep in his room. Ivan rubbed his eyes and picked up his son. He carried Viktor into the kitchenette and opened the refrigerator to take out a bottle. Ludmilla didn't want to breastfeed their son, so she and Ivan practiced weaning him towards the bottled formula. Ivan then put the bottle in his son's mouth. Viktor sucked hungrily as his father rocked him back and forth then carried back to his room. Ludmilla listened as Ivan took their son to his room. She then sneaked into the sitting room. She made her decision after Viktor was born. When Viktor came out, she held her newborn son in her arms and felt…. nothing. No affection. No maternal bonding. No attachment. Nothing except relief that he was out. It was nothing at all like the obvious love her husband felt. The lack of feeling for her child was the final decision. She waited until Ivan and Viktor were quiet. Silent. Just the two of them in a world that did not need her. Ludmilla picked up the phone and dialed Yevgeny's number. \"Yevgeny,\" she said. \" I made my decision about what we talked about. I can do it. I want you and your life.\" As he fed his son, Ivan marveled at what a second chance Viktor had given him. His life wasn't over yet. He could still box maybe not in luxury as the pride of the Soviet Union with that fine technological equipment designed to make a superman. Instead there were many small villages and bars that held prize fights. It was a step down and technically wasn't entirely legal but it would bring money and food to the table. Ivan would not surrender and would not allow Viktor to do so either. He smiled as the little one looked up at his father and gave a newborn equivalent of a happy grin. Ivan warmly kissed his son. No Ivan Drago did not cry holding his infant son as the little one fell asleep. But he had never been happier. Author's Note: In the establishment shot of the Drago's apartment in Creed II, the camera pans to two photographs. One of Ludmilla holding baby Viktor and the other of Viktor when he was about two or three. The photo that Ivan takes of Ludmilla holding Viktor in my story is meant to be that picture. I will also find a way to put the other photo in my fic too mostly because it is so adorable to see the Big Guy when he was a Little Guy and he's smiling. It shows that Viktor's childhood wasn't all being forced into boxing and raised on hate. He was once a genuinely happy kid and his father encouraged that. Of course I couldn't resist a play on Ivan's famous \"I must break you\" catchphrase. Now changed to \"I won't break you\" to his newborn son. Also I don't know how old Viktor actually is. I thought I heard 28 in the movie but I like the symbolism of him being conceived right after the fight with Apollo so I moved his birth up a little so he can be directly involved in those events sort of.[Chapter 4] The Unmistakable Fire A Rocky IV/Creed II Fic By Auburn Red IV. Ludmilla, Sasha, and Ayzere Ivan Drago sat in the train car, his two and a half year old son asleep with his head on his father's lap. He watched the Russian landscape go by through the window. He should feel something some sort of sadness about leaving his homeland but the truth was he didn't feel anything at all. The events of the past almost three years soured any loyalty that he would have had of his country by birth. Viktor stirred in his sleep and opened his eyes. Once undersized and underweight, he had long caught up to the size of most children his age and was even heavier. That's a fighter's son for you, Ivan thought proudly, a fighter himself. \"Papa I'm hungry,\" Viktor said. \"Alright Vitya,\" Ivan answered. He stood up and opened his bag. He pulled out a bag of roasted sunflower seeds and handed it to his son. The boy ate the snack contented. Ivan's own stomach growled but he ignored it. He had very little money and what he did have had to provide for Viktor. Viktor came before Ivan always. When Viktor was finished eating, Ivan put the bag back and took out one of Viktor's stuffed animals, Cheburashka, a big eared white faced brown creature that Ivan bought while the two were on the road as Ivan engaged in rough grueling and illegal boxing matches. Viktor held his stuffed friend close and spoke to him in childish gibberish. \"We're moving to Kiev, Chebu'shka. Don't cry. I know you're scared.,\" Viktor put his fingers on the toy's cheeks miming like he was wiping his tears the way his father did for him. \"You still sleep with me there.\" He looked up at his father. \"Will he Papa?\" \"Of course he will,\" Ivan said half amused by his son's imaginary conversation and half guilt stricken about their situation. Ivan silently watched his son play with the toy until he yawned and began nodding off. Ivan observed the landscape through the window again until the monotony of the scenery made him sleepy as well. Ivan was tired not the spirited kind of tired after a boxing match where he collapsed satisfied with the fight and relieved that it was over. He was exhausted from the turmoil behind him and uncertain about the future ahead for him and Viktor. What would he do in the Ukraine if he couldn't box? How could he earn a living? Where would he and Viktor live? How could he support his young son? Would he ever see Ludmilla again and was there even hope that she could love him again? Where would Viktor go to school and how would he be treated when he was there? Will Ivan's disgrace and shame stay for the rest of his life and into Viktor's adulthood? How would Viktor treat him if it did? So many questions filled his mind that even though Ivan was bone weary, he still found it difficult to fall asleep. After Viktor was born, Ivan and Ludmilla's marriage still did not improve. Ludmilla did not leave, but they were not happy together. They slept in separate rooms and had little to say to each other. Occasionally Ludmilla would make some sharp criticism or comment, but mostly she inherited her husband's art of silence. They just barely spoke to one another acting more like strangers rather than husband and wife. Sex was a distant memory. Since Ludmilla gave birth to one child and was unable to bear any more, she considered that part of her marriage done. She kept her door locked and refused to admit her husband. While Ivan still got a hard on for his beautiful sexy wife, he refused to appease it by forcing himself into her room or having an affair. Those were things his father did to his mother things that he could never do. Instead he honored his wife's wishes and returned to his room. Despite his faltering marriage, two things were more important to Ivan: caring for his son and revitalizing his boxing career. He took care of his little boy doing all of the parental duties such as feeding, changing, rocking, and soothing him to sleep all with a growing affection for Viktor. Ivan loved to hold and kiss his son or pick him up and swing him in the air. Ivan idly wondered when he picked him up, if Little Viktor's ears popped or if he felt that the air was very thin up there over his giant father's head. Ludmilla however was not affectionate towards their son. When she contributed her duties, they were always mechanical and rigid. She refused to breast feed Viktor so they both fed him from a bottle. She formed no attachment with her son in fact told Ivan that he was being too lavish and indulgent with his. They even differed on what they called him. Ivan addressed him by the diminutive pet name \"Vitya\" while Ludmilla used the more formal \"Viktor\" or more often \"that infant\" as though he didn't have a name. She did her expected duties as a mother but little else and with clear contempt for the child that she gave them to. Besides Viktor, Ivan also attempted to continue his boxing career. Because the high tech facilities were closed to him, so were the higher quality matches. His removal from the boxing world was not yet official but he could tell that it certainly was closed for now. Instead Ivan spent most of his time training in regular gyms and asking about the prize fights. Many did not wish to speak of them. Officially they did not exist and were not sanctioned by the Soviet authorities. Unofficially, many people attended them especially in the rural villages where they had very little entertainment. So even though someone always knew somebody who either attended or fought in them no one would admit it. So Ivan trained, practiced, and asked. Finally one day a letter arrived from a Sasha Orimenko inviting him to participate in a match in a tavern in Elyakovo and to talk. Ivan showed the letter to Ludmilla who nodded in delight and spoke with a warmth that Ivan hadn't heard in some time. \"Congratulations Ivan, I knew that you would come back.\" Ivan looked at the letter up and down. \"Would you come with me?\" Ludmilla shook her head. \"I can't, remember? I am going with Tatiya Tania to Georgia.\" Ivan nodded. Since the troubles in their marriage, Ivan no longer got along with Ludmilla's aunt and uncle. They also were disappointed in his loss and made not so subtle suggestions that Ludmilla should leave him. Ivan had a feeling that during his wife's holiday with her aunt that he would be the frequent topic of conversation. Viktor, then six months old, made an impatient sound from his high chair. Ivan retrieved his son's bottle. He put the formula in the boy's mouth and turned to his wife who looked at the father and son with vague disinterest and boredom. \"You will bring Viktor with you of course,\" he said. Ludmilla glared at him. \"I will do no such thing!\" \"Well he can't be left here by himself,\" Ivan objected. Ludmilla had a snide look that almost said \"why not?\" \"Tatiya thinks that I need a rest from my marriage and motherhood,\" she stated. \"How much of a rest will I have if I have to take that infant along?\" \"What am I supposed to do with him?\" Ivan asked. \"Can't you take him with you?\" She asked. Ivan shook his head not believing that she just suggested such an impractical idea. What was I thinking? A tavern is the perfect place to take an infant, he thought sarcastically. \"Ludmilla I am not taking him to my meeting with this Orimenko. It is dangerous and foolish!\" \"That is your final word on the matter?\" Ludmilla glared. \"It is,\"Drago insisted. \"He does not come.\" Three days later, Ivan stood in front of the seedy tavern with his boxing equipment over one shoulder and Viktor in his arms. How much of a rest can she have if she has to take him along, Ivan thought angrily to himself. More of a rest than I would have worried over what would happen to Viktor in there! Viktor pouted as he looked at his father with an angry grimace. Ivan continued. \"Now no trouble!\" The baby gave a loud sound like a raspberry. \"Well you started it!\" Ivan said as he held his son closer to him so he could be warm from his body and opened the door. The tavern was loud with raucous cheers and laughter and filled with cigar smoke. Ivan looked at the ring, a much smaller one than he was used to, as a large Tajik man almost Ivan's size pushed his boxing gloves and gave a guttural scream. From the letter, Ivan read that his name was Fazid \"The Berserker\" Abdulin Ivan's opponent. He would be boxing him in one hour. \"He doesn't look so tough does he?\" Ivan asked the disinterested infant. Viktor gave a sound that Ivan hoped was of approval. \"I know, your father must break him. Now where is this Orimenko?\" \"If you have any equipment leave it behind the bar,\" Lev, a scrawny ferret faced Armenian man said from behind the bar as he barely looked up at Ivan's direction. Ivan was distracted both by his opponent, searching for Sasha Orimenko and holding onto his wiggling son that he had just a minute to improvise. Without another thought, he handed the baby over to the bartender. \"Take good care of him until my match is finished.\" Lev looked confused. \"What? What's this?\" He asked. He was stunned at the squirming baby in his arms and looked like he was going to be ill. \"I can't take this!\" Ivan stood up to his full height and glared at Lev who gulped. All Ivan had to say were two words: \"Take him\" as he nodded terrified. An elderly man waved Ivan forward. The man was large in both size and girth though Ivan was taller. He had a snow white beard and a twinkle in his eyes. With his appearance and his bulky long coat, Ivan thought he looked like pictures he had seen of Ded Moroz Grandfather Frost. \"Ivan Drago, I am Sasha Orimenko. Have a seat.\" When he spoke, Ivan could detect the Ukrainian accent of his mother. He invited the younger man to sit next to him. \"Would you like a drink?\" \"No thank you,\" Ivan said. \"A Russian who doesn't drink? How is that possible?,\" Sasha laughed. He called a barmaid over and ordered a vodka. \" I make sure this place never goes out of business. I am their best customer. Now come order.\" \"A vodka will be fine as well, black,\" Ivan had a feeling that he would need it facing Abdulin. Ivan and Sasha looked up as a small wail rose over the tavern, an all too familiar wail to Ivan's ears. \"Is that an infant? Who would be so careless as to bring one in here?\" Sasha asked. Ivan winced in embarrassment. \"Yes some people are so irresponsible!\" The baby's wail got louder as the disheveled bartender approached the two men. Ivan figured something like this would happen with his luck. Lev glared at Ivan. \"Comrade, your child just vomited all over my bar!\" He put Viktor back in his father's arms. Ivan shrugged. \"He is the first person here to do that?\" He dryly asked. Lev nodded like he couldn't deny it. \"Today.\" He said as he stormed back to the bar. \"Ah, he is your son,\" Sasha realized as Viktor calmed down instantly playing with his father's fingers. \"He has no mother I take it.\" \"No he does,\" Ivan said. Sasha nodded as if understanding. \"Then you are divorced.\" \"No,\" Ivan replied. \"We are still married.\" The older man looked confused so Ivan tried to explain. \"Well you see- its-\" Sasha waved his hand. \"Bah you young people! It is complicated, da?\" \"Sort of,\" Ivan said. \"Since we have some time before we begin let me tell you about the circuit,\" Sasha said. He nodded over at the direction of Fazid Abdulin who was in a fierce discussion with his handlers. He screamed again as the crowd cheered loudly clearly excited for the upcoming match. \"You are aware that these matches are not formally sanctioned by the athletics committee nor by the Moscow government,\" Ivan nodded as Sasha continued. \"There are less restrictions so it can be more dangerous, even fatal at times something I believe that you are familiar with already.\" Sasha laughed until he saw Ivan's glare realizing that was a hidden comment about Apollo Creed. Sasha threw up his hands. \"It was only a joke. You know Vanya, I may call you Vanya da, you should learn to laugh once in awhile.\" Ivan did not respond. Instead he slightly rocked Viktor back and forth as Sasha spoke. \"There is a reason that they are not formally approved. It is because it makes us serfs out here in the villages happy. That's because Moscow likes to control everything. The Bolsheviks will not be happy until every aspect of our lives is restricted including the Breads and Circuses. You are familiar with the term?\" Ivan shook his head as Sasha tapped his forehead. \"Ah what do they teach children in schools these days? That is what I call these matches. In ancient Rome Juvenal was disgusted with how the common people were concerned with filling their bellies with bread and attending violent entertainment the Circuses. He thought that they were so concerned with their personal pleasures that they chose not to discuss philosophy or revolt. However, Vanya, I feel differently. I think the Breads and Circuses do serve a purpose. These people are so beaten down by the Communists that they have very little to rely on. They break their backs on farms that belong to the state. They are taught to fear their fellow man. Even the television programs or the films they see are tightly controlled. Out here in these villages, they play their music, tell their stories, and yes occasionally pay to watch two men beat each other bloody for rubles and why shouldn't they? They have so little out here.\" Ivan considered. He never thought of what the Soviet government meant to the common villagers. He knew times were often hard for them but they were hard for everyone. He had lived his whole life in Moscow, raised in Kapotnya, educated in the orphanage and the military school, joined the Army, fought in Afghanistan, and became a living symbol of the superior Russian athlete. He had been so used to the propaganda that he had become desensitized to it. He had forgotten what it meant to people who lived in fear every day of the system that he had followed without question. Ivan nodded at Abdulin's direction. \"Who are these fighters? How are they selected?\" Sasha shrugged. \"Different ways. Some are former street toughs, others worked in the farms or were part of nomadic tribes. Others like your new comrade Fazid over there, had been in prison in Siberia. The real Siberia not just a name on a robe.\" Ivan knew the older man was taking another jab at Ivan's boxing career. He was about to explain that he did not choose that name but instead glowered. \"You are aware of who I am and that I could report all of this and bring it to an end,\" Ivan said coldly. Sasha smiled clearly not at all afraid. \"It is because I know you who you are that I know you will not report it. I saw you in your fight with Rocky Balboa. I saw you declare that you fight not for the government nor for some national pride that no longer exists if it ever did. You declared you fight to win for you. Anyone who can say that with their fist held high in the air in front of the Politburo with the Secretary General present is exactly the kind of fighter we want. You are surrounded by people who fight for themselves. Oh they fight for their families: husbands, wives, children as I suspect you do-\" he nodded at Viktor who lay still on his father's lap. \"-friends. But what makes them different is that they fight for an individual they fight for the right to be individual. Not for some political slogan that is draped in front of a machine gun. That's who these fighters are. That's who you are.\" Ivan was doubtful. He wasn't sure if Sasha was telling the truth or not. \"It was nothing. It was something I said at the moment spoken out of anger and excitement.\" \"But it was said,\" Sasha said drinking some more of his vodka. Ivan had to admit that he was filled with a bold pride when he made that declaration. So many had subsequently used that line against him that he felt bitter and ridiculed by it. He had forgotten how proud it made him that for once he declared that he was tired of being forced, handled, and controlled. He felt less like the machine they expected him to be and more like a man. It surprised him that somewhere out there someone had listened to him and made that connection. Didn't Viktor deserve that right as well the right to fight for himself? Ivan gave his son a thin smile as he smiled back. \"Well I have been talking too long,\" Sasha said. \"It is that time.\" Ivan was about to stand when he looked downward at the infant still in his arms. \"What do I do with him?\" He asked out loud. Sasha held out his hands. \"I will take him.\" He said. Ivan was suspicious. \"You would?\" \"I am the father of six children,\" Sasha said. \"I will take him.\" Finding no other alternative, Ivan put the boy in the older man's arms. \"His name is Viktor.\" He said as he left for the back room to get dressed. The fight was intense more so than the usual matches Ivan was used to. Fazid Abdulin lived up to his nickname as he screamed and verbally taunted his opponent in a loud and obnoxious manner like a berserker. Ivan thought he reminded him of the Tajikistan answer to Clubber Lang. The two men glared at each other as the fight began. Abdulin mocked Ivan as he gave him a few punches. \"Come on Drago,\" he taunted. \"Fight like a man! You could not even beat Rocky Balboa on Moscow soil! You are a disgrace.\" Ivan punched Abdulin a couple of times but the man still continued. \"Is that what you did to Apollo Creed? Is that the best you can do? Is that how he looked when he died? You murderer!\" Ivan struck back as he punched him ruthlessly. Instead of his usual cold behavior he blazed with rage. Fire instead of ice. Passionate instead of stoic. Fierce instead of detached. It was as though Fazid Abdulin had unleashed all of the anger that Ivan held towards his enemies until it exploded. He beat the man again and again until he was on his knees with a look of fear in his eyes. Ivan had him with one more punch. Ivan answered his question \"No that is not how Apollo Creed looked when he died! He was not a coward!\" He punched his opponent sending him flat on the ground. The tavern erupted in applause as the customers threw coins and rubles at the fighters. Ivan raised his fists high in the air as the people cheered. Abdulin rose alive but defeated. Sasha held up Viktor and made the boy's tiny hands applaud. Ivan wasn't sure how much Viktor actually understood of what was going on but the happy smile on his son's face was enough. Ivan jumped down from the ring as the customers patted him on the back and offered to buy him rounds. Ivan accepted their thanks and walked up to Sasha and Viktor. He held his son high in the air and kissed his cheeks. \"My Vitya. My victory!\" He looked at Sasha. \"Well?\" He asked. \"You are our kind of fighter,\" Sasha said. \"You will do very well. I will send you the schedule by post.\" Ivan graciously accepted his comments. But he nodded at Viktor. \"What about him?\" \"Do you think that you would bring him often?\" Sasha asked. Ivan could not answer. This was not a safe environment for an infant child but he knew that Ludmilla would never want to be responsible for caring for Viktor that long. Sasha smiled. \"I tell you something. Let me know if you are taking Little Viktor with you and my wife or I will care for him during the fights.\" \"Your wife?\" Ivan asked. Sasha nodded. \"Ayzere. She loves these fights as much as I do and she gets bored puttering around the house now that our youngest turned 18 and married.\" He thought for a second. \"No 19. She would love any reason to watch them.\" He stuck out his hand. \"So what do you say? Are you with us, Ivan Drago?\" What could Ivan say? Ivan gave a thin smile. \"Da.\" He shook the man's hand in return. Ludmilla was instantly supportive of her husband accepting to perform in the Breads and Circuses. She said that she would not tell anyone but that she would not attend them. \"These sound like rather long trips and to be truthful I never liked going to the matches.\" Ivan was surprised. This was news to him. She used to love attending them and got a thrill every time her husband won. What had changed? Then Ivan realized that she no longer liked them because her husband lost. She could no longer watch in embarrassment accepting another potential humiliating defeat. \"If you like I can remain here and influence the officials to let you be reinstated\" Ludmilla suggested. \"You would do that for me?\" Ivan asked. Ludmilla tutted as if that was a stupid question. \"Of course I would. I am your wife am I not? I am also a much better speaker than you are and Dadiya has some influential contacts. It could work. You could be the pride of the Soviet Union again. Then in the meantime you can prepare for your return with these matches.\" Ivan smiled with delight that he had such a forward thinking wife. He was also glad that she was showing her love in her own way by bringing her husband's career back. (Later on he practically kicked himself for not asking why she didn't do this before.) \"Thank you, Lyuda.\" \"It is what any loving wife would do.\" Ludmilla said. \"But Ivan I would love for you to do two things for me.\" \"Of course anything,\" he said. \"First that you take Viktor with you,\" Ivan was reluctant so she explained further. \"That man Sasha offered to watch him during the matches. It would be foolish not to accept.\" \"I suppose,\" Ivan said. \"And second.\" \"You transfer the money into notes and send it to me so I will put it in the Gosbank in your account and take care of it,\" she said. \"You may have some for food of course and lodgings but wouldn't it be better if the money were here in Moscow instead of with you in some village where you could be robbed?\" It did make sense. His wife always managed his finances before so why not now? \"You will be alright here?\" \"Don't worry, Ivan,\" she said. \"I will be just fine.\" Ayzere Orimenkova was a small stout Kazakh woman. She looked like she was several decades younger than her husband but she had the look of a hardened peasant woman. Her dark graying hair was tied in a simple bun. She was dressed in a black and white dress and headpiece of her people. She smiled warmly at Viktor and held him on her lap. \"Don't let my wife's size fool you,\" Sasha said proudly with a laugh as he slapped Ivan on the back. \"Aza may be small but she was raised with ten brothers and lifted heavy farm equipment.\" Ivan looked at the woman up and down skeptically. While he knew that many of the rural women were as strong as the men, this woman's petite frame suggested otherwise. Plus he was well aware of sportsmen's frequent hyperbole. Ayzere grinned. \"You doubt my husband?\" She pointed at the floor. \"I suppose I should prove my skills.\" Ivan smirked at this short woman's bravado but he had to be realistic here.\"I do not wish to hurt you.\" \"I was thinking the same thing,\" Ayzere said. \"Go ahead.\" She handed Viktor to her husband and stood at the floor. Ivan couldn't believe he was doing this. He faced her planning on pulling his punches to go easy on her. He got in a fighting stance and Ayzere reached over and firmly put her hand on his arm. Before Ivan had time to react she grabbed Ivan's other arm, lifted him a few feet from the ground, and flipped him over knocking him to the floor. Ayzere and Sasha laughed as Sasha helped him stand. \"It's a shame that such sports are closed to women. She would be world champion wrestler and I would be quite a wealthy man.\" \"I can see that,\" Ivan said with admiration, respect, and a strong desire to never tell anyone what just happened. \"It is a beginning of beautiful friendship, da?\" Sasha said. Ivan nodded. Yes Viktor would be in good hands with these two no doubt about it. After his successful match, Ivan gathered his earnings, took out what he and Viktor needed for food and a place to sleep at night. Viktor will need a stronger coat with winter approaching and us going to the colder places, Ivan thought as he laid out some rubles for that and placed the rest inside a small locked box. He would transfer the money in the morning and send it to Ludmilla. He accepted Viktor from Ayzere's hands and bounced him on his hip before he thanked the Orumenkos. Viktor glanced up at his father, smiled, and laughed. In an unguarded moment, Ivan kissed his son. \"My Vitya my victory,\" he whispered. He then gathered up their things and headed towards the inn where they would sleep for the night. Sasha and Ayzere smiled warmly at the retreating father and son. \"I do not understand.\" Sasha said. \"No other boxer that I know brings their small children with them. Most of them leave them at home.\" \"Most of the other boxers have wives or other relatives to care for their children at home,\" Ayzere reminded him. \"Viktor only has Ivan.\" \"He is married,\" Sasha said. \"His wife is in Moscow.\" Ayzere snorted. \"If she were a good wife and mother do you really think that Ivan would choose to bring his son with him?\" Sasha had to agree. He could not think very highly of Mrs. Drago's parenting skills if Ivan would rather bring the boy to a tavern rather than leave him with his mother. \"That man surprises me,\" Sasha said When he is fighting his opponent, he is fierce unstoppable, almost a monster. It is like he is driven by anger and hate, not that I blame him, and unleashes it in the ring. But when he is with that boy, he is so gentle and tender. It is almost like he is not the same man.\" Ayzere shook her head and laughed. \"Oh Sasha don't you see? Inside the ring he only has eyes for his opponent. But outside the ring, well outside, he only has eyes for Viktor.\" Those first fights led to several. Ivan traveled by train sometimes for almost an entire day, checked himself and Viktor in to an inn, arrived at the locations, trained usually with whatever was lying around such as wood, stone, and other natural items, fought and received the money. They would go from one small village to another in various Soviet countries: The Ukraine, Latvia, Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Belarus,Georgia, Moldavia, Turkmenistan, Kyrgyzstan, Armenia, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Estonia, occasionally in Russia itself (but not in Moscow, Sasha said that would be tempting fate) up to Siberia, the real one he remembered Sasha saying not the name on the robe. Ivan's eyes were opened to the plight many of these villagers had against the Soviet government. He saw dilapidated farms, cold hungry winters, people who had prematurely aged because of their hardships, soldiers roughly arresting and beating unruly villagers into submission and taking advantage of female ones, and former gulag prisoners their dead fearful eyes and scarred rail thin bodies telling of unspeakable torture. Occasionally someone would dress or sing a song from their native country only to be silenced and reminded that they were all Soviets. Once Ivan Drago was proud to call himself a loyal Soviet, these days he felt less proud. He asked Sasha if he thought the people would or should rise up and revolt the way they did against the Tzar. Sasha shook his head and said bitterly. \" Vanya, what for? They did it once and this is what happened. They do it again and nothing will change. The peasants will still be poor. Moscow or some other city would still be in charge. All another rebellion would do is give us a few months of excitement followed by years of corruption and tyranny with many of the same faces leading us.\" Ivan wasn't sure how he felt about that. He didn't want to think about it again. Sasha and Ayzere traveled with Ivan and Viktor staying in the same inns as they did. They kindly watched Viktor as his father trained and fought. They also served as Ivan's trainers and corners often helping him prepare for fights. At first Ivan was simply cordial and polite to the couple, but as the four of them traveled together Ivan could tell they had developed a fondness for the father and son as he did towards them. Ivan at first could not understand this fondness. After all he did not have such a bond with Rimsky or Koloff. He began to understand when they stayed in Novosibirsk for an upcoming fight. It was a downtime since the fight wasn't scheduled until the next day so Ivan decided to take in some rigorous running and training to prepare for his fight. He returned to the inn to Sasha and Ayzere's room since they were looking after Viktor. Ivan could smell cooking from the stove as Ayzere stood in the kitchen area. Sasha held the 8 month old infant and told him the story of Odysseus and the Cyclops. \"So after Odysseus stabbed Polyphemus, the Cyclops opened the boulder and yelled 'I have been stabbed.' 'Who did this to you?' his brothers yelled. Because Odysseus introduced himself as Nobody the giant said 'Nobody stabbed me.' 'Well,' Polyphemus' brothers said. 'Then what are you going on for? Go back to sleep!'\" Ayzere chuckled and shook her head at her husband's story. She greeted Ivan and invited him to sit across from her. \"I believe the only reason my husband wanted children was so he could tell them stories.\" \"Viktor likes hearing them,\" Ivan said politely. Ayzere handed him a bowl of borscht. Ivan was about to respectfully decline and pick up Viktor to return to their room when Ayzere gently tapped him on the shoulder. \"And the only reason I wanted children is so they could eat my cooking,\" Ayzere said. \"Now eat hearty. I suspect that you don't eat enough.\" Ivan didn't want to say how close she was to the truth. After Ivan deducted the money he sent to Ludmilla, he was left with very little for himself and Viktor. Most of his money went to pay for rent and to buy formula, diapers, and other necessities for Viktor. Ivan skimped on meals for himself usually getting by with eating very little. \"I am fine,\" Ivan said. \"You will be much better if you get some food in you\", Ayzere said determined. \"You will do no good for your son if you do not care for yourself first. You hurt yourself enough as it is. You do not need to practically starve yourself as well.\" Ivan accepted the borsht and ate it. He covered his mouth to hide the grin that was threatening to form. While Ayzere could be a tough trainer holding bags while Ivan punched and shouting orders like any man, she was also very much a Mother Bear making sure that Ivan and his son were well cared for. Ivan didn't suspect too many male trainers were as forceful as she fact he would love to see Ayzere encounter Rimsky. Ivan had a feeling that the odds would be in Ayzere's favor. The smile turned into a laugh which Ivan attempted to cover with a cough. \"I am sorry.\" Ayzere smiled. \"No it is very nice even if I now owe Sasha 15 rubles.\" \"How do you mean?\" Ivan asked. \"Well Sasha and I had a bet to see whether or not you could laugh,\" Ayzere answered. \"I did not think you were capable. I have never been happier to be proven wrong.\" Ivan smiled at the woman's good natured humor. The two ate in silence as they could hear Sasha continuing the story \"So as Odysseus left he said 'Polyphemus my name is Odysseus, but you can tell everyone that you have Nobody to thank for your troubles-Nobody but yourself that is.\" He tickled the infant as both the boy and the old man laughed. p Ivan and Ayzere exchanged amused grins as Ayzere became wistful. \"It is nice to hear children laugh. I miss that.\" Ivan nodded. \"Sasha said your children are grown.\" \"It is more than that,\" Ayzere said bitterly. \"We had six children. Two of our sons and one daughter were sent to Siberia 15 years ago and never returned. About ten years ago another son and daughter emigrated to America with their families but we do not know where. Our youngest Larissa married the son of a prominent Muscovite two years ago so she wants as little to do with our family as possible.\" \"I did not know,\" Ivan said. \"I am sorry.\" \"Don't be,\" Ayzere said. \"You did not know us at the time and you had nothing to do with it. But now you see why Sasha and I spend so much time at these matches. I guess we now like to think of our boxers as family especially those who are without one of their own.\" She nodded at Ivan. Ivan looked downward at his borscht unsure of what to say. He was interrupted by Sasha who put his finger to his lips. \"The little one is fast asleep.\" \"Spasibo,\" Ivan said. Sasha accepted a soup bowl from his wife. At first he looked confused as Ayzere held up 15 rubles but then he looked at Ivan and a big smile across his face. \"I told you that he was not chiseled in granite.\" Sasha said merrily. Ivan shook his head at the jokes at his expense. Sasha sat and joined them. The three of them talked until a familiar cry surrounded them. \"A teething child is such a wonderful noise, da?\" Sasha quipped.. \"This is Father's job,\" Ivan rose. He winced realizing how bad it sounded in light of what Ayzere told him. \"I'm sorry.\" \"As I said don't be,\" Ayzere answered simply. \"Now you go care for your son.\" The fights were extremely graphic and brutal. While Ivan did not kill any opponents, they were often left severely bruised or bloodied as was he. Often the bloodier the fight was the more the audience liked it. Without any officials there, there were less rules and restrictions and no round counts so they could be extremely brutal by the end. The fight pretty much ended when one was on the ground. While Ivan won sometimes, his fighting style had changed. Like his fight with Fazid Abdulin, he became more aggressive, furious, and passionate. Maybe it was the audience's expectations or maybe it was the fights themselves. Maybe it was the rage that he felt towards his enemies like Rocky Balboa or his disappointment at his public loss. Ivan was still as quiet as ever and not given to outward displays of emotion except towards Viktor, but the fire that had long been inside consumed him in the ring and was unleashed with his fighting stance. It wasn't quenched until the opponent was defeated. Ivan also lost many times as well which was rather unfortunate because while both participants got paid the winner was paid more than the loser. Sometimes if Viktor gave him several sleepless nights by crying and needing attention, Ivan would come to the fights sleep deprived. Ivan could still fight well two to four days without sleep but over a week often left him at the mercy of whomever he was fighting. Also after he had participated in the Breads and Circuses for a couple of years, Ivan felt more and more pain. It became harder to bounce back from injuries. He spent more time in the steam bath houses soothing his aching bones and muscles. His body was going through tremendous amounts of punishment and he knew that it was prematurely aging him. He wondered if his boxing days were coming to an end. He hoped not. He hated to think that his only lasting legacy was killing one man in the ring and losing to another on his own home turf. He also worried what would happen if those days were behind them. He spent his whole life training to be a fighter. If he couldn't box, what else could he do? As promised, Ivan posted the money to Ludmilla. They often talked on the phone but not for very long. She thanked him for the money and asked how the fight went. Ivan told her as terse and succinctly as possible without any exaggerations or hyperbole. Whenever he mentioned Viktor, Ludmilla was usually quick to say that she had to go. She never wanted to hear about Viktor only about the fights. Ivan asked about his status and she told him that there was no response. He knew official Soviet response could often be rather slow but he wondered how much she was even trying. Once she mentioned that Nikolai Koloff's younger brother, Yevgeny, a lawyer, was interested in helping them out so Ludmilla decided to work with him to get Ivan reinstated. \"Don't worry Ivanushka, Yevgeny and I are working together on this. We will get you restored to Soviet glory. You just keep doing what you do best, keep fighting and I will do what I do best, keep thinking and talking.\" Ivan only missed one fight when Viktor was 2 years old. In their room at an inn in Estonia, Ivan helped Viktor dress as the little one started sneezing. His face scrunched up and he began to cry. \"Papa, I no feel good.\" Ivan picked up his son and noticed that his body was warm. He then put his hand on the boy's forehead and realized he was feverish. He informed Sasha that he had to cancel the fight because he had to watch over his sick son. He was surprised to see Sasha and Ayzere standing at the door a few minutes later. \"You are angry with me for cancelling?\" Ivan guessed. He sat next to Viktor as he lay on the bed. He absently handed Cheburashka, which he bought for Viktor that day, over to his sick son. Sasha gave one of his deep laughs and turned to his wife. \"I told you that's what he would think. Vanya dear boy, you are too suspicious.\" \"I am Russian,\" Ivan reminded him. \"You are suspicious even for a Russian,\" Sasha laughed. \"Even Zeno would think you go too far with your stoicism.\" \"Who?\" Ivan asked. Sasha teased him. \"Vanya, if you read more and fight less, you might live longer. Zeno of Citium Is the founder of stoicism that wonderful philosophy that you follow whether you know it or not. Restrained, expressionless, strong, not given to outward emotion. Many of your countrymen follow that whether they know it or not.\" \"If you are not angry with me then why are you here?\" Ivan asked. \"Because you have a sick child and to tell you that it is alright if you miss the fight,\" Sasha said. \"Vanya, you are a father first and a boxer second. Of course you would stay with the boy. You should stay with him.\" \"Also we want to give you this,\" Ayzere said as she handed Ivan a glass jar with a strange gelatinous gray glop inside. \"What is it?\" Ivan asked as he opened the jar. It had a very strong smell that he drew back. \"It is medicine that had been in my family for generations,\" she said. \"It will help strengthen Viktor's immunity. It is sour milk combined with beets, rutabagas, carrots, and potatoes.\" Ivan shrugged. Okay why not? he thought as he put some on a spoon and held it in front of his son. At first the boy closed his mouth and refused to eat it. \"Net, net!\" He cried. Nyet nyet. No no. He continued to cry until Ivan commanded, \"Eat it!\" Even though he was a small child, Viktor knew when his father had that tone of voice that it was best to obey him. He opened his mouth as Ivan put the medicine inside. \"He should begin to improve by morning,\" Ayzere explained. Ivan thought how odd it was, if Ivan was still the pride of the Soviet Union, Viktor more than likely would have been treated at one of the fine hospitals and subjected to state of the art technology. Now here Ivan was relying on a folk remedy from a Kazakh peasant woman. Either it was a sign of how far he had fallen or how much he had learned. He thanked the kindly couple as they were about to leave. \"Bolse spasbo Ta Ta and Dya Dya,\" Viktor said. \"Indeed,\" Ivan agreed knowing what his son said. \"Bolshoe Spasibo.\" \"No need to thank us,\" Ayzere said. \"You are our tovarich our comrade,\" Sasha said with one of his warm belly laughs. Ivan's mouth turned slightly upward. He wasn't used to such kindness. He was used to people who were only interested in what he could do for them. Sasha and Ayzere were nothing like people like Koloff, Rimsky, Vobet, or his father, maybe Ludmilla who used, abused, or abandoned him when he didn't deliver on his promise. Even when he lost fights, Sasha and Ayzere assured him that he needn't worry and there will be other ones. Ivan felt a strong bond with the elderly couple. They filled a hole in Ivan's life that he didn't realize needed to be filled. They talked to him as a friend and an equal not as a product of the Soviet system as so many others did in his life. Ivan didn't have many friends but he considered the couple his comrades. Comrade. Such a funny word, so overused that it lost all meaning. Sasha and Ayzere Orumenko were the only people in Ivan's life that he considered worthy of the term. Viktor also loved them. Since Sasha and Ayzere still cared for Viktor during his father's matches, he felt a familial attachment to the couple. When Viktor learned to speak his first word was of course \"Papa\" but he also said \"Ta ta\" for Tatiya how he referred to Ayzere and \"Dya dya\" for Dyadya for Sasha. The next morning when the fever had indeed passed, Ivan called Ludmilla and told her that he missed the fight and explained why. \"I hope it was worth the money you lost,\" was her only sharp reply. Ivan glowered. \"Your son is fine, thank you very much!\" He said sarcastically before he hung up the phone. The Breads and Circuses were too good to last. When Ivan, Viktor, and the Orumenkos returned to Elyakovo ironically Ivan was to face Fazid Abdulin once more. Before the fight even began as Ivan and Abdulin prepared their final touches, a troop of Russian soldiers entered the tavern. There was a tense silence. Terrified Viktor ran from Ayzere's lap and ran towards his father. Viktor had a fear of soldiers. Throughout the villages that they had travelled, many of them shouted orders, shot at the air or innocent peasants, and seemed to delight in their cruelty. If a soldier appeared and especially when they got in his or his father's face, Viktor would often cower behind or next to his father for protection. He even sometimes woke up with nightmares about them only to be soothed by his father. Privately, Ivan was glad that the boy never saw him in uniform. Viktor clinged to his father's legs as Ivan put his arms around his son. A captain stepped forward and said, \"We order these fights be stopped immediately.\" Sasha stepped forward. \"Who gives such order?\" \"It is direct orders from the state. You are to cease these matches and ordered to never perform them again.\" A cry of protest arose from the crowd. \"Silence,\" the captain said. \"If you cooperate none of you will be harmed. Now disperse immediately.\" He stopped for a minute and headed towards Ivan's direction a sly smile on his face. \"Ivan Drago so good to see you again.\" \"We know each other?\" Ivan asked. \"Bela Smirnov we fought in Afghanistan together,\" the captain began. Ivan shook his head. \"I don't recognize you. There were so many of us.\" \"We boxed together many times and you defeated me every time,\" Smirnov reminded him. Ivan shook his head. \"Do you have any idea how little that helps me to remember?\" He enjoyed how frustrated Smirnov got that he didn't remember him. Smirnov looked annoyed but then he waved his hand disdainfully and laughed. \"No matter you probably wouldn't remember. After all I am not an American that defeated you in Moscow or another American that you killed in the ring!\" He was about to say something else when he received a sharp kick to his shin. Smirnov looked downward at the young boy who kicked him. He picked Viktor up by his neck. The little boy screamed in pain as the captain handled him too roughly. \"Send this puppy to his mother where he belongs.\" He shoved him to the ground. Ivan's eyes flashed. Without another word, he punched Smirnov right in the jaw. One of Smirnov's brother officers punched Ivan in the stomach in retaliation. For that, Ayzere lifted the soldier and pinned him to the ground. That started a barroom brawl between the tavern goers and the soldiers. Ivan boxed a few and Ayzere wrestled a few more. He glanced over at Fazid Abdulin who screamed before he clubbed a man on the head. Ivan and he exchanged glances as they saluted each other in respect. Even Lev the bartender got into the act as a soldier was pushed towards his bar. The soldier sprang up and called him a filthy Armenian. Lev retaliated by breaking a glass bottle over the soldier's head. \"Yes and I am proud of it,\" he said dryly as the man went down. For Sasha's part he managed to punch a few and knock a few down flat but mostly he picked Viktor up, set him on his lap, and sat down. He calmly drank his vodka as he enjoyed the display. The fight continued until a gunshot sprang through the air and hit a wall. The glass bottle that it hit shattered. The people stopped fighting as Smirnov put his gun back in the holster. \"You may be strong fighters but none of you can withstand a bullet. Now, I order you to end these fights and leave this tavern immediately.\" The tavern goers slowly filed out not fighting but certainly not happy about it. They grumbled as they left. Sasha, Ayzere, and Ivan rose. Ivan retrieved his son from Sasha's hands and set him next to him holding his hand. The quartet rose to leave as Smirnov called \"Drago, you should be proud to know that it was you personally that we were told that participated in these illegal fights. You should feel fortunate that we rescued a former Soviet fighter from these vulgar nationalistic displays.\" Ivan, Ayzere, and Sasha sat in the Orimenko's hut in Elyakovo. Viktor sat on the floor playing with Cheburashka. It amazed Ivan how resilient children were that Viktor recovered so quickly from that incident with the soldiers and the brawl and was back in his innocent world as if nothing ever happened. \"I did not report them.\" He insisted. \"We know Vanya we know,\" Sasha said. \"You would not likely report on yourself.\" \"Do you suppose Ludmilla did?\" Ayzere asked. She never did care for Ivan's wife the little she knew of her. She could tell neither did Sasha. Sasha shrugged. \"It is a possibility.\" \"No,\" Ivan said rather quickly. \"She wouldn't.\" Ivan wasn't sure if his wife wouldn't report the fights out of loyalty to her husband or because she knew that she would receive no money if she did and wasn't likely to destroy her main source of income. He forced such disloyal thoughts from his mind. Ludmilla may be a little mercenary and their marriage hadn't been the best, but she was not about to cut her husband's throat to save her own. She loved him too much for that. Right? \"Bah,\" Sasha said. \"It does not matter who reported it. It only matters that it was done. It was bound to happen anyway. The Bolsheviks love nothing better than to ruin anything that we would consider entertainment. Still we had some good fights and certainly ended with one.\" The three clinked their vodka glasses in a toast in agreement. \"What will happen to you?\" Ivan asked. Sasha shrugged. \"We will manage, a pair of Arctic wolves like us.\" Ayzere held her husband's hand. The two smiled. \"And you Vanya what will you and Viktor do?\" \"Return to Moscow,\" Ivan said. He realized how long it had been since he had seen the city. The city and Ludmilla. He hoped that she would be there waiting for him. \"Work, care for my son, fight again.\" Sasha gave a small laugh. \"Not to offend Vanya but I am beginning to wonder if you should stop fighting. We see that you get injured more and your endurance is not what it was. This barroom brawl alone still gives you a sore back. Oh I have no shame in the Breads and Circuses, but even I know that fighters never lasted very long in them. One year is the limit, two if they are fortunate. You made it to almost three. You have a son and he has a birthday soon. He needs to know that his father will live to see many more birthdays to come.\" Ayzere nodded in agreement. \"Sasha is right, Vanya. For Viktor's sake, maybe it is time.\" If it had been anyone else, Ivan would have been offended by such a suggestion and would have beaten the person who made it senseless, but he knew that Sasha and Ayzere were not asking out of meanness or mocking him. They were sincere in their concern. Still he could not accept that suggestion. \"Not yet,\" he insisted. The couple exchanged glances clearly not happy with his decision but not finding their place to argue with him. Ivan looked squarely at the couple. \"I want you both to know that you are my truest friends. I think of you like a mother and father to me, better than my real parents certainly better than my father. I will always treasure our friendship.\" Sasha grabbed Ivan's arm in a firm but hearty grasp as he did the same. \"As do we, Vanya.\" They fell into a bear hug. \"You are as another son to us,\" Ayzere said as she embraced the younger man warmly. \"Come Vitya,\" Ivan said standing up. He took his son's hand to help him rise. \"We have to leave. Say goodbye to Tatiya and Dyadya.\" Sasha warmly picked up the toddler and kissed him on the cheeks. \"Dasvedanya Vitya. May you be granted your quota of smiles.\" \"Dasved'ya, Dya Dya,\" the boy said waving goodbye with his tiny hand. Ayzere kissed the little one on the cheeks. \"Dasvedanya, Vitya. You care for your Papa. He does not wrestle so good.\" Ivan smirked at the memory. \"Dasved'ya Ta Ta,\" Viktor said waving at his surrogate aunt. Ivan held out his hand and led Viktor out. Despite the emotion that was threatening to come, he actually was looking forward to returning to Moscow and his wife. Home he thought. He couldn't wait. Ivan took Viktor's hand as the two walked to their apartment. Viktor asked several questions mostly about his mother. \"Is Mama booful?\" \"She is Vitya very.\" \"Is Mama kind?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Is Mama smile?\" \"Sometimes.\" \"Is Mama fighter like you and Ta Ta?\" \"Not like us. We fight with our fists, our bodies. Mama is more like Dyadya. She fights with words.\" \"Why does Mama not come with us?\" With that question, Ivan could hear his son's voice quiver. He knelt down so he could be eye level with his son. \"Mama has things to do here and she couldn't be with us all the time, Vitya. Now enough questions. We are here.\" He picked his son up and perched him on his hip. He fished into his pocket and pulled out his keys. Then he unlocked the door. Ivan called his wife's name but the house was quiet disturbingly quiet. \"Ludmilla, Lyuda?\" He asked. He set his son down feeling a sense of emptiness that disturbed him. He walked into their bedroom and opened up the closet. His clothes hung neatly on the hangers but hers were gone. He opened the drawers and saw her other clothes were missing. He looked up to locate her jewelry box but it too was gone. Ashen Ivan returned to the sitting room. He picked up the telephone. \"What's wrong, Papa? Where's Mama?\" \"I don't know, Vitya,\" Ivan said as he dialed Ludmilla's aunt and uncle's phone number. \"Vobet residence,\" a familiar voice answered. \"Sergei, do you know where Ludmilla is?\" Ivan asked. \"Ivan you're back,\" he sounded at first surprised then disgusted. When he spoke again he sounded casual like he was trying to hide something and didn't want to let Ivan know.\"My niece and...wife are in Sochi right now on holiday.\" Ivan breathed a sigh of relief. Sochi. Holiday. That was all. It made sense that she would take….all her clothes and jewelry with her. \"Do you know when she will return?\" \"I do not know,\" Sergei said. \"When she does will you please let her know that we returned?\" He asked. \" Oh Ivan I will be more than happy to,\" Sergei said with a faint tone of irony that Ivan did not catch. Instead Ivan thanked him and hung up. If that wasn't a big enough surprise, the next one added to it. Since Ivan still had some rubles and coins left over from the last few fights, he didn't notice any problems with his finances at first until he ran out. When he approached the Gosbank to make a withdrawal, the teller told him that there was nothing in his account and furthermore that Ivan's access had been restricted. \"What?\" Ivan asked shocked. \"That's what it says here,\" the man said showing him the financial statement. Sure enough, Ivan saw that it said 0.00. \"That's just not possible. You are making a mistake,\" Ivan said. \"My wife transfers the money into my account every day.\" The man peered at his records through his narrow glasses. \"According to this, she has made some very sizable withdrawals for some time now. You did know about it didn't you?\" Ivan stood in frozen silence. She couldn't have stolen from him could she? The teller continued imperiously. \"Then Comrade, the mistake is clearly not on our part.\" He said that in a tone that indicated \"What kind of an idiot are you?\" When he and Viktor returned to the apartment, Ivan's head throbbed at the pressure he felt. He rubbed the bridge of his nose as he looked at the pile of papers representing money that his wife owed. That he now owed. He didn't want to believe it. Ludmilla wouldn't steal from him. She was his wife. He trusted her. Too much it seemed. \"You are suspicious for a Russian,\" Sasha once teased him. Obviously not suspicious enough. How could he have trusted her so much? He heard something about boxers getting brain damaged after being hit too many times. He dismissed it, but now wondered if that was what happened here. Was he incapable of reason to the point that he blindly trusted her or was he so in love with Ludmilla that he refused to see her dishonesty? Maybe his father was right all along. Maybe he really was Ivanushka-Durachok, Ivan the Fool. He tried to justify her actions in his head that he had been away for so long. She was probably lonely. They didn't have much of a marriage before that. Cost of living made her withdraw too much. At the very least, he should wait until she returned from Sochi to hear what she had to say. But no matter what convenient excuse he provided for his wife's actions, Ivan felt so drained that even though he hadn't boxed in awhile, he still felt like he had been knocked out. Below the pile of money statements, another more recent letter caught his eye. It was from the Soviet Athletics Department to inform him that he was scheduled to appear before a hearing to determine his status as a Soviet boxer. Ivan waited inside the Athletics Building for over two hours beyond the scheduled time. Viktor sat on his lap. Finally his name was called. Ivan stood and bade his son to walk with him. When Ivan entered the room, he motioned for his son to sit down on one of the chairs by the wall and not to speak. The boy obeyed as his father approached the Committee. Seven men sat behind a podium and faced Ivan. Most Ivan knew at least by sight and one rather well. Nikolai Koloff, his former manager and promoter glared at him with such a smug grin that Ivan longed to punch him again. The director opened his file and spoke. \"The Soviet Athletics Department will now begin our hearing whether Citizen Ivan Alexeyevich Drago is to return to our boxing program-\" \"-Strike the title Citizen from the charges,\" one official said. \"Drago is not a citizen of Russia.\" \"I have always been a good and loyal Russian,\" Ivan argued. The director read the added information. \"According to this you are only half-Russian. Your mother was a citizen of the Ukraine.\" \"\"My mother moved to this country when she was 12,\" Ivan said. \"She married a Russian soldier! I am a former Soviet Captain! I was awarded the Order of Lenin-!\" \"-Yes Drago we are aware of your previous record but you still are not a full native of Russia.\" Ivan felt punched in the gut. He was once the symbol of the Russian athlete. How could they suddenly decide that he wasn't Russian enough? His mother's country of origin never bothered anyone before. The director continued. \"Mr. Koloff will you read the charges towards Drago?\" \"Gladly,\" Koloff replied as he took out a form. \"Charges are noted as follows that Drago had enhanced his performance with the use of anabolic steroids-\" \"-I was given them by you,\" Ivan declared. \"-Please Drago, you will get your chance to speak. Continue Koloff.\" \"Thank you Comrade Director,\" Koloff said. He continued to read from the paper. \"Underperforming at the highest level, being responsible for the death of another boxer, and participating in so-called \"prize fights\" that are illegal and unsanctioned by the Soviet Athletics Department.\" \"- I have to earn a living,\" Ivan began. \"Drago please,\" The director commanded. \"Now we will discuss each charge one at a time.\" The accusations against Ivan went on and on. They practically skimmed over Apollo Creed's death while they endlessly discussed Ivan's underperformance. To this Committee the death of a man was nowhere near as important as a loss on Soviet ground. The worst accusation was the one involving the steroids. Dr. Popov appeared and said that he administered the steroids in Drago's home. \"That is not true,\" Drago said. \"It was in the gyms in full view of Koloff and others.\" \"Drago we don't want to warn you again,\" the director commanded. \"Continue Dr. Popov.\" The doctor nodded. \"Thank you, Comrade Director. I have records stating that I personally administered anabolic steroids to Citi- uh Drago once a day from 1983-1986.\" \" And there were no officials present during these injections?\" The director asked. \"There were not Comrade Director,\" Popov said. \"This was done without the approval or consent of the Soviet Athletics Committee. I personally administered them to Drago via his request.\" \"And you consented to this procedure even though it was not approved?\" Koloff asked. \"Well look at him,\" Popove pointed at the buff giant of a man. \"I would be a dead man not to. Plus with the steroids, his already ferocious temper along with his addiction was even more uncontrollable. We all saw what he did to Apollo Creed.\" Drago realized what was going on. Koloff and Popov destroyed all evidence that they had administered the steroids. Popov then claimed that his patient was a temperamental drug addict whose word could never be trusted. They would never admit that they had given them to him personally or that they required it. Ivan and Ivan alone was to be charged for receiving illegal performance enhancing drugs. The Committee spoke for a few minutes until the Director spoke. \"Drago do you have anything to say in your defense?\" That's when Ivan realized that he didn't. He could never verbally argue with these people or state his case in a way that would convince them. He was not a talker. The blunt truths that he already said did not matter. All of his usual means of defending himself, cold intimidating stares, shoving, and pushing someone down would never work here. Ivan was completely unprepared and completely out of his depth. He really had nothing to say. \"Again, his tongue did not make it through customs,\" Koloff jeered. He and the other committee members laughed. That was it! Ivan clenchd his hands into a fist. He really wanted Koloff down there so he could punch his lights out. The director then nodded. \"Then it is decided. Ivan Alexeyevich Drago, you are hereby banned from boxing for life. You will be stripped of all your titles and will turn in all awards that you receive including your gold medal. You will no longer represent the Soviet Union in any official athletics capacity and will not return to the sport. This case is closed.\" He banged the gavel that felt like a bullet into Ivan's soul. Ivan and Viktor walked out of the building hand in hand when Koloff called him. \"Oh Drago, I should let you know Ludmilla has returned from Sochi.\" Ivan turned around and faced his former manager. \"How do you know that?\" \" I am not the KGB. My brother informed me, in fact she is over there at his home right now,\" Koloff said clearly enjoying the psychological torment he was giving the former boxer. \"Apparently they had a marvelous time together. Much better than their time in Georgia nearly three years ago. She did not tell you this?\" \"With her aunt-\" Ivan began. Koloff interrupted him. \"I assure you my brother is not her aunt.\" Drago gave the former manager one of his intimidating stares. \"Where does your brother live?\" Ivan asked. Koloff smiled and told him. \"It is ironic is it not. You claimed that you fight to win for you now you will lose for you as well.\" Ivan turned around like he was going to leave but he whirled around and punched Koloff sending him to the floor. Ivan gave an icy grin. That actually felt good. Ivan knocked on the door of Yevgeny Koloff's house. He waited as a dark haired man dressed in a white bathrobe opened the door. He looked similar to Koloff in features that Ivan figured out right away that he was his brother. \"Yes,\" he said. \"What can I help you with?-\" He began but Ivan shoved him into the house. Both Ivan and Viktor followed him inside. \"Where is my wife?\" He threatened. \"I don't have to tell you-\" Yevgeny Koloff began but Ivan lifted him a couple of feet from the floor. \"She's not here,\" Yevgeny's voice cracked. Ivan lifted him a couple of more feet. \"Ludmilla!\" He squeaked. \"Genya, what is it?\" A familiar voice asked. Ivan dropped the other man and stared at his wife. \"Lyuda,\" he said softly. Viktor's eyes widened in surprise. \"Mama?\" Looking at his wife made Ivan realize how long it had been since they last saw each other. Ludmilla looked different, thinner but still beautiful and sexy. Her hair was dyed to a platinum blond and her face was made up and clearly worked on. She too wore a white bathrobe as well as diamond jewelry including a necklace, bracelet, large hoop earrings, and a ring that appeared bigger than three regular rings. She looked like a parody of the Snegurochka, the Snow Maiden Grandfather Frost's granddaughter. She looked pampered, polished, not the typical Soviet wife not even the young Muscovite wife. To Ivan she looked gaudy and overdone. In Ludmilla's hands was a filled champagne flute. \"What are you doing here,Ivan?\" She said not even bothering to conceal her contempt. Ivan looked from his wife to the other man putting the pieces together. \"You and Koloff's brother-how could you? How long has this been going on?\" Yevgeny stared at his mistress as she helped him stand. Drago's shocked demeanor gave him the advantage. He put his arm around Ludmilla and smiled. \"Three years now since Balboa wasn't it?\" He kissed her full on the mouth. \"It was before then as I recall,\" Ludmilla teased. \"Since before Ivan's fight with Apollo Creed.\" The two lovers kissed and laughed. Ivan tried to piece everything together. He wanted to deny what he was hearing. His wife had been having an affair? That long? Before Apollo Creed? Ivan glanced over at his son, his dark haired son. His dark haired son that had been conceived the night after the fight that Ludmilla said was two months premature. The son that Ivan swore shared his features. He looked over at Yevgeny Koloff. He had dark hair and was Viktor's chin like his? His face was also like Nikolai's. Ivan shook his head. No Viktor was his son, dammit, his son! Ivan was the one who was there at his birth, the one who fed him, the one who nursed him when he was ill, the one who cared for him on the road while Ludmilla was in Moscow. Viktor was Ivan's son. He always would be. Ivan felt not only knocked out but like his opponent was dancing on top of his fallen body the way Creed did before their match. He looked from Ludmilla to Yevgeny still in each other's arms and laughing. Viktor's eyes were on the floor. \"I don't understand, why?\" Ludmilla laughed. \"Because Ivan you are a failure!\" \"You said that before but you came back,\" Ivan said stunned. \"Lyuda, you came back to me.\" \"I was pregnant and had a difficult birth,\" Ludmilla said indicating Viktor who she saw for the first time. \"Giving birth to that child! I couldn't very well do anything about it then!\" Ludmilla walked towards the bar and poured herself some more champagne as Ivan followed her like a sick and damaged dog. \"Ludmilla, we shared everything. I gave you money. I went to the Gosbank and they told me-I didn't believe them-\" Ludmilla gave a thin smile. \"Ah yes the Gosbank. Thank you for the money, Ivanushka. It wasn't much but it certainly paid for many nice things.\" Ivan looked around the house at the art work, antiques, old books, jewelry, champagne. Her front closet was open and he could see elegant fur coats and evening gowns. Ivan was stunned. \"The money from the prize fights- Viktor and I went without so I could send it to you.\" \"Bolshoe Spasibo, Ivan. You fought and I collected like always. You have made me a very wealthy woman mostly with your original career of course but the prize fights have been profitable as well among other have definitely turned for the better in the past year.\" She took another sip. \"Perestroika and Glasnost have been very good to me. For the first time I live like a Westerner and I love it.\" Ivan looked around once more at the house and felt repulsed. Fighting in the Breads and Circuses was for nothing. All of the non-stop travelling, the fights where Ivan was beaten, broken and bloody, he and Viktor staying in one freezing inn after another, enduring hunger and sleeplessness, putting his body through tremendous agony, cutting short his athletic career, coming face to face with some of the toughest fighters as well as Soviet soldiers. All that he did and all that he earned was now on Ludmilla's walls, in her closet, in her glass and on her face, neck, wrists, and fingers. He felt like he was the proletariat worker working, suffering, and bleeding while his wife was the bourgeois manager sipping champagne while he starved. Worse he felt like he was a prostitute that sold his body and talents while his pimp of a wife benefited from them by selling her husband and spending his money. He looked over at Viktor. The boy silently gulped, tears falling down his face. \"You left us with nothing.\" Ivan said slowly and sadly. \"Not entirely nothing,\" Ludmilla said. She reached into an ornate box and pulled out a small piece of paper. She handed it to Ivan. \"I do not marry failures and I don't stay married to them either.\" Ivan opened the document: divorce papers. It was all perfectly legal and signed by her. It was just waiting for his signature. \"Nyet,\" Ivan said. \"You are my wife and Viktor's mother!\" \"That means nothing to me,\" Ludmilla said. \"You mean nothing to me! I don't want you and I don't want that child!\" \"But-\", Ivan began. Yvgeny rolled his eyes. \"Why don't you give up, Ivanushka-Durachok? She wants a divorce! She does not want to marry a failure who lost on his own soil and who participated in vulgar tavern fights. It's a good thing that I had them stopped when I did. Otherwise you still would be in them dragging Soviet Athletics's reputation down as well as Lyuda's.\" Ivan glared at what this man just confessed to. \"You reported the fights and had them closed down.\" Yvgeny smiled triumphantly. \"How else do you think they found out where you were? Your wife told me and I told them.\" Ivan clenched his fist and aimed. True he promised that he would never hurt his wife. He made no such promise towards her boyfriend. Yevgeny lay flat on the ground. Ludmilla ran to her boyfriend's side and glared at her soon to be ex-husband. \"Get out, Ivan! I never want to see you again. Get out and take that child with you!\" She walked up to him and slapped him across the face. \"I said get out!\" Ivan closed the door as Viktor looked downward. \"How come Mama don't want us?\" Ivan held his son close unable to answer. Some questions could never be answered. A few days later, Ivan looked at the divorce papers. The language was hard to understand, but it was pretty clear. Ivan and Ludmilla Drago's marriage had come to an end. He took out a pen and mechanically signed his name. Everywhere he and Viktor went, Ivan knew the word had gotten out of his losses. He could see people staring and pointing at him. A few laughed. People assumed since he participated in tavern fights that he was an exiled inebriate. Pravda even mocked him by saying \"Ivan Drago swore that he would break Rocky Balboa. Well he didn't but his wife and our comrades at the Soviet Athletics Department broke Drago.\" When he and Viktor sat somewhere to eat, customers would say \"Is that-?\" and then rise and move to another seat as if Viktor or his father had some contagious disease that they could catch. Money was scarce as for the past few days, Ivan resorted to begging. Thankfully there weren't too many people that refused to give money to a large intimidating man but still Ivan resented that he had to do it at all. He felt cold and alone like he was now a stranger in Moscow. Viktor stirred a little in his sleep and Ivan glanced at his son's direction. He knew the boy's belly was empty. All Viktor had to eat was a bag of roasted sunflower seeds which he already finished. He had another bag which Ivan suggested that he should save for tomorrow. A woman was kind enough to purchase them for Viktor and his father. Ivan insisted that they would both be for Viktor. He would be fine. He walked over to the boy and smoothed back his dark hair. \"My Vitya,\" he whispered. He couldn't say \"my victory,\" because there wasn't one. All he could do was kiss the top of his head. A loud imposing knock filled the room and made Ivan jump in surprise. Viktor's eyes flew open as a deep voice called \"Drago, open the door!\" \"What is it Papa?\" Viktor asked terrified. Ivan stood up and embraced his son. \"I don't know Vitya. Wait here.\" He opened the door to see three soldiers in the doorway. One, Bela Smirnov looked menacing. \"Now do you remember me, Drago?\" Ivan did not answer. The other two soldiers looked nervous like they didn't want to be the ones to turn in Ivan Drago but that they drew lots and lost. \"Papa soldiers!\" Viktor said running to his father's arms. \"What do you want?\" Ivan asked. \"Ivan Alexeyevich Drago you are ordered to report to Kievsky Station where you will be deported to Kiev. You are hereby stripped of your Russian citizenship and are ordered to comply immediately\", Smirnov commanded\" \"Papa nyet,\" Viktor shouted. He collapsed into his father's arms. Ivan simultaneously tried to comfort his son and glare at the soldiers. \"What about my son?\" Ivan asked. \"The orders only apply to you, not to the boy,\" Smirnov motioned to his subordinates as they reached for the boy intending to remove him from his father. \"Nyet Nyet! Don't make me go!\" Viktor screamed. \"Don't take my Papa away! I want to stay with my Papa!\" Ivan held his son even tighter trying to form a barrier between Viktor and the soldiers. He lost respect, his career, his only friends Sasha and Ayzere, his wife, and now his country. He was damned sure not going to lose his son too, the only person in the world that he had left to lose. He knew what would happen to Viktor. His mother clearly didn't want him nor would the rest of her family. Ivan could request that he be sent to Sasha and Ayzere, but they were not blood relations. Soviet authorities would be under no obligation to honor such a request. Viktor would undoubtedly be sent to an orphanage, a cruel harsh uncaring state run orphanage like the one in which he grew up. Ivan Drago would never allow that to happen. The soldiers pushed on him again and Ivan grabbed the soldier's arm tightly. Even with Viktor between them Ivan managed to shove him backwards. \"Do! Not! Touch! My! Son!\" He warned icily. The soldier unleashed his grip on the boy. Ivan glared at the men. \"My son comes with me,\" he declared. \"Sir our orders,\" one of the soldiers argued. Ivan's eyes flashed. \"My son comes with me or I do not!\". Smirnov rolled his eyes considering the argument not worth it. \"Never mind you may keep the boy. One less body for the orphanage.\" On the train to Kiev, Ivan once again reflected on the things he lost. He was no longer a boxer. Instead he was a national joke. The Breads and Circuses were closed to him or to anyone else and his only friends lost their livelihoods. His wife divorced him and now had all of his earnings. Now he was a man without a country. Four years ago he was the pride of the Soviet Union now he was no one, an abandoned stray dog with a puppy to take care of. All because he lost. He lost to Rocky Balboa. Inside Ivan seethed with a boiling rage. If he hadn't lost to Balboa none of this would have happened! He wanted revenge but he knew that he could never get it towards Balboa. It wasn't likely that he would return to the Soviet Union, not without special permission and Ivan sure as hell wasn't going to America. The only thing he had left was revenge and even that could not be satisfied. He pounded his fists into the walls, the seats anything. He wanted to kill something, strike it, beat it until he was satisfied! He kept hitting and hitting everything around him. He pounded the seats because there was nothing left to pound! Suddenly a small voice piped up clearly in a nightmare. \" Nyet, Nyet! Don't take my Papa! Don't take him away! Papa! Papa!\" Ivan reached over to wrap his arms around his son. He picked up Cheburashka, who the boy dropped during his nightmare and handed him to his son. \"It's alright Vitya. They didn't take me, I'm here. Papa's here.\" The boy wept in his father's arms. \"Papa, I'm scared.\" \"I know Vitya,\" his father said. He pulled his son away from him and looked in his eyes. \"Vitya, I know that you are scared and sad but you must do something for me and yourself. You must never let anyone see you fear or cry. They are our enemies and you must never show fear or sadness to an enemy. When you do, they will find it as a weakness and use that against you. You have to be strong so you can fight them and win. Do you understand?\" Viktor nodded. Not even three years old and already he understood. He wiped his tears and asked with a quivering voice asked. \"Can I show them to you?\" \"Just no one else,\" Ivan said warmly. The boy then clinged to his father's shoulder and sobbed into his chest. Ivan held his son tightly and allowed his son to cry the entire way to Kiev. No Ivan did not cry comforting his son and thinking of how he lost his career, respect, money, glory, country, friends, and his wife. But he seethed. He hated and inside he vowed that someday he would have his revenge against Rocky Balboa. Author's Note: 1. I made up the concepts of the prize tavern fights. I do not know if such things really existed in the Soviet Union or if they did they were that widespread. I thought of them kind of like the fights Rocky participated in in the first movie only he used them to work his way up and Ivan used them on his way down. 2. The other reason that I created the Breads and Circuses was because of Sasha and Ayzere. I felt it was important for Ivan to have at least a few genuine friends in his life for a few reasons: 1)It parallels Rocky's journey because they serve as Ivan's Mickey or Duke 2) To show that someone connected to Ivan's \"I win for me!\" declaration in a positive way 3) To create more sympathetic Soviet characters besides the Dragos 4) So Ivan could get a sense of how the Soviet system that he once represented treated people and 5) So in the next section Ivan could have one of his well-known catchphrases thrown back at his face in an epic manner. 3. The bit where Ivan leaves a baby with a staff member only for them to return them saying that the child threw up was from the movie Baby Boom (1987). Only since Diane Keaton isn't exactly Dolph Lundgren and can't silence someone with a look, she instead promised the coat check girl a very big tip and her Visa Card. 4. While more downplayed than in Rocky V, I am not dismissing that Ivan may have suffered brain damage from his fights. When writing Rocky V, Stallone considered making the script about a rematch between Rocky and Ivan until someone told him that they both would have sustained brain damage in their fights. That left Stallone to study the negative effects of what boxing could do and built his movie around that. Also the steroid use as well may have caused permanent cognitive issues as well. Not to mention as I wrote, the Breads and Circuses grueling fights prematurely aged him. So I paralleled his and Rocky's journey by being easily susceptible to manipulation and being reduced to poverty by a reckless loved one. Though in Rocky's case, it is caused by frivolous spending and Paulie's errors. In Ivan's case, Ludmilla deliberately ruined him. 5. The line where Ivan compared himself to an abandoned dog with a puppy to take care of comes from Film Switch's wonderful insightful Youtube review of Creed II called \"Why Creed II Made You Cry.\" 6. The line about how Ivan felt \"cold and alone like he was a stranger in Moscow\" is from the Michael Jackson song \"Stranger in Moscow\" which was a huge inspiration for this fic. 7. Of course the implication that Viktor may not be Ivan's biological son is based on how little Dolph Lundgren and Florian Monteanu looked alike even though they are both big guys. Considering what we know of Ivan and Ludmilla's marriage it's not out of the realm of possibility that she's been around. I purposely left it open ended because I like the possibility that he might be his son and even if not biologically then he is Viktor's father in every sense of the word.[Chapter 5] V. Russia Ivan Drago would always remember where he was and what he was doing when he heard that the Soviet Union ended. That New Year's Eve, he and Viktor were at the bread lines and the markets getting food. The line was very long, it was always very long. Ivan walked forward holding his five year old son's hand. Viktor was extremely quiet and listless. He often was when he hadn't eaten in sometime like a small feral kitten that was about to be drowned because he was the runt of the litter. Ivan gently brushed his and Viktor's hand across his cheek to wake him up. The boy reacted somewhat but he still drooped having the same look of hunger and sadness. Poverty had done this to him. Ivan thought with regret. Poverty was threatening to weaken possibly kill his son. It made him frail and vulnerable just like Ivan's mother. Ivan was going to have to find a way to strengthen the boy. When it was finally their turn, Ivan methodically went through the lines trying to figure out exactly what was needed and what they could do without. He had about 150 rubles and that had to last them through his next pay period from his job at the docks. Such hard work for so little pay. He selected some bread for Viktor and glanced over at the meat market. They had fresh meat. Ivan considered as he picked up another loaf of bread. If he bought the meat, he wouldn't have enough for his own bread. But if he bought the bread for himself, Viktor would not have anything more substantial. Ivan put his own bread back and selected a cut of meat. He then set the meat underneath the bread in his basket. A loud commotion erupted on the streets and several people ran and shouted outside the markets. Ivan couldn't tell what about whether they were protesting, rioting, or just plain drunk. Ivan did not look up nor did anyone else. Since the Coup d'etat, there had been so much unrest in the streets that they had grown used to it. The only good thing about the unrest was that since Viktor had gotten so used to the sight of soldiers on the streets he no longer feared them or at least acted like he didn't. Ivan felt a tug on his sleeve. \"Papa, can we have that?\" Viktor asked pointing at a jar of honey over with the sweets. Viktor loved bread and honey. It was one of his favorite treats but they couldn't always eat it. Honey was way too expensive. \"Not this time, Vitya. Maybe another time.\" Viktor pouted and almost argued but instead he nodded. So small so devoid of argument, Ivan thought. Yes, the boy needed to become stronger. Ivan and Viktor walked to the greens section and Ivan weighed whether he should get turnips this time. The last they had were rotten, but he and Viktor ate them anyway. Ivan put the turnips in his basket when a young man ran inside the market, a jubilant smile on his face.\"Did you hear the news? Gorbachev resigned! Communism is no more!\" An excited but skeptical murmur fell through the crowd. Since the Coup d'etat in August, a new rumor spread nearly every day. Mikhail Gorbachev was dead. No, that he was dying. No, that he was a prisoner in his own home. No, that he and the rest of the Politburo had been assassinated. No, that the American President George Bush declared war on the Soviet Union and any minute now nuclear bombs were going to rain down on the Eastern Bloc. So many rumors that no one knew what to believe. The young man said. \"No I heard about it on television. It's true! It's official! Gorbachev resigned! The Soviet Union has fallen!\" There was a long silence as if the marketers and merchants were letting the news sink in. Suddenly, a joyful but nervous cheer arose from the back. Then the cheer got louder as more people shouted, clapped, laughed, danced, cried tears of joy and hugged family members, friends, even complete strangers to share this monumental news. As for Ivan, he stood in silence absorbing the news. The Soviet Union was gone? He couldn't imagine something so hard to believe, so alien. He heard the Cold War was ending but he didn't believe it. A smile began to spread across his face as one thought occurred to him. \"What does it mean, Papa?\" Viktor asked. Ivan looked down at his son. \"It means Vitya, that we can go home.\" He smiled. This was definitely a cause for celebration. Ivan returned the turnips then picked up a jar of honey. He placed it in the basket with his other purchases. \"I don't understand, don't we live in Kiev?\" Viktor asked as the two sat on their cots inside their one room apartment, basement really, later that night. \"Not originally,\" Ivan answered as he moved to sit on his son's bed. He reasoned that it would make sense that Viktor would not remember Russia that well. He traveled with his father while Ivan participated in the Breads and Circuses from the time Viktor was six months old. They left Russia before he was three and they had seen so much hardship since then. \"We are Russian,\" Ivan said. \"We were ordered to leave the country when you were very small.\" Ivan good naturedly tickled his young son. \"Well smaller than you are now.\" He said as the boy laughed. \"What does Russia look like?\" Viktor asked. Ivan waved his hand to indicate the country around them. \"Much like here except larger.\" Viktor looked around skeptically. \"So why are we going back?\" Ivan shook his head and stifled an amused grin at his son's bluntness. \"Because Russia is my home, our home and things are different there. When things change, people who were once exiled return.\" \"Does my mother live there?\" Viktor asked. \"She does,\" Ivan said still feeling the pin prick in his heart every time he thought of Ludmilla. \"Will she know we are coming?\" Viktor asked. \"I will write to her,\" Ivan promised. Of course there was no guarantee that Ludmilla would answer. Every year on Viktor's birthday, Ivan wrote her a letter short but filled with details about how much Viktor was growing, how he was doing in school, what he did for fun. They were short, succinct, and terse but Ivan hoped that she understood the underlying message: I love you. I miss you. I long to be with you. Viktor needs his mother and I need my wife. Please let us come home. The letters were always returned unopened. Sasha and Ayzere were a lot more faithful with their letters. Sasha's letters were as long-winded and bombastic as he was: filled with jokes, laughter, stories, and encouragement. Ayzere couldn't write that well but she always included parcels of her homemade remedies with love. Unfortunately their letters stopped a few months ago. Ivan vowed that while they were in Russia, they would stop by Elyakovo to see how their old friends were doing. \"Why were we ordered to leave?\" Viktor asked. \"There were many reasons, but most importantly I lost a match to an American,\" Ivan answered. He told Viktor about his boxing career. He sometimes put his son to sleep with stories about his matches in the military, the Olympics, and the Breads and Circuses. However, there were two matches Ivan never talked about: his fight with Rocky Balboa and the one with Apollo Creed. This would be the first time Viktor heard about Rocky. \"They made us leave because you lost?\" Viktor said incredulously. \"That's wrong! They should not have done that!\" Privately Ivan thought that Viktor was right. But Viktor, like many children saw the world as black or white, right or wrong. \"Well they did. They wanted to prove that the Soviet Athletes were the best so when the American bested me in Moscow, I humiliated and embarrassed them. After some time, they felt it was best if we left.\" \"My mother too? Did she want us to leave?\" Viktor asked. Ivan nodded. \"She did.\" There was a long silence as Viktor lay in bed. He was so silent that Ivan thought his son had fallen asleep. He was about to rise when Viktor asked. \"Was he better than you?\" \"Was who better than me?\" Ivan asked. \"The American,\" Ivan said. \"Well that is no one is a better boxer than you. How was he able to defeat you?\" The way the boy asked was as though his father was a god-like being who couldn't be taken down except by some powerful divine intervention. Ivan offered a thin smile. He was touched by his son's loyalty and admiration. Secretly, he didn't feel worthy of it. \"Well he was persistent for one thing,\" Ivan said. \"It took 14 rounds for him to defeat me. Also he hated me even before the match because-\" No I won't talk about that, Ivan thought. \"- well it doesn't matter.. He wanted to fight me and hate can be a powerful weapon that can make a warrior.\" \"Did he know you before?\" Viktor asked. \"Nyet, Vitya,\" Ivan answered. \"We did not know each other.\" \"So why did he hate you?\" Viktor asked. \"We were opponents,\" Ivan said rising from the bed and not wanting to continue the conversation. \"But you said he hated you before the match,\" Viktor said. \"Why did the American hate you so much?\" Ivan whirled around. \"Viktor,\" he sharply retorted. Viktor drew back stunned at his father's sudden change of mood and that he called him by his full name not the diminutive. Ivan was instantly remorseful. \"I'm sorry, Vitya. You ask far too many questions. The reason that he hated me is not important. He's an American and he was my enemy that is all. It's time for you to go to sleep.\" He knelt down, tucked his son in, and kissed him goodnight. It took six months before Ivan finally received a letter granting permission for him and Viktor to come to Russia on a temporary basis. Ivan instantly posted letters to Ludmilla, Sasha, and Ayzere to inform them that they were coming. Ivan and Viktor waited as the train pulled in. Ivan thought how much things had come full circle for them that they were at the same station and the same train heading to the place from where they came. It was surreal. How much would Russia especially Moscow change? The people who had once cast them out were gone and Ivan outlived them. Maybe he would outlive all of his enemies. Inside the train, Ivan allowed himself a moment to imagine what his and Viktor's lives would be like in Moscow. They would live in a small modest apartment, one that would be just right for the two of them. They would live humbly without too much fuss, but Viktor would attend one of the best schools. He would have studies, friends, all the things his father never had. Maybe he would learn to use his brain rather than his muscle and become a great man, perhaps a lawyer or politician. Ivan gave a slight chuckle imagining the thought of Viktor Drago, son of Ivan Drago, member of the Politburo if it still existed of course. As for Ivan well he would get back everything they lost. He heard that many former Soviet and Eastern European athletes, even the ones formerly in exile were welcomed back to the Russian Federation teams. Ivan reasoned, why couldn't the same thing happen for him? It was too late for him to participate for the 1992 Olympics, but he could train, fight, and prepare for the 1996 games. Of course he wasn't exactly excited about having to go to America again this time to Atlanta, Georgia. (That confused him at first. He didn't know of a city in Georgia called Atlanta until he looked closer and realized that this Georgia was part of the United States and not the country.) But he could stomach seeing it again if it meant that his former glory would be restored. Ivan would start his life over with a fresh clean reputation. Not as a killer, or a failure, or a product of the Soviet Union. He would instead be what he was always meant to be: a boxer, a fighter who just happened to be from Russia. He would not have the technology or the steroids. Instead he would use what he learned at the Breads and Circuses and while training in Kiev and he would fight fair and honestly. He would fight against the former Soviet machine that bullied the people: fight for Sasha, for Ayzere, the deadened rural villagers, the poor people of Kiev, and of course for Viktor. He would hold his head up high once more. Viktor would be so proud as they put that gold medal around his father's neck and Ludmilla? Well Ludmilla always loved a winner. She would come back to him once more. On the train, Ivan shook his head from these foolish fantasies but still allowed them. Why not? Did he not earn the right to indulge himself in a little daydreaming? After all imagining the future was a lot better than living in the present where he and Viktor struggled to survive and only lived minute to minute hour to hour not thinking beyond their next meal or where they were going to sleep for the night. Since they arrived in Kiev, life had been a long difficult arduous existence for the pair. Ivan often struggled to find work. He accepted just about any position: road crew, construction, welder, street sweeper, bricklayer, machinist, factory laborer. Lately, he had been working at the docks as a stevedore. Any job that required a strong body that was used to performing strenuous backbreaking work, in horrible conditions, and for little pay. That was when he could find work. Many positions were temporary. Others had a waiting list of hundreds of people and even though Ivan performed the task well, they still chose someone else. Other employers weren't empathetic to the fact that Ivan was a single father and sometimes had to be home when he could not find or afford someone to watch Viktor or when his son was sick and needed nursing. One factory foreman recognized Ivan and routinely mocked him. Ivan would have let it slide and simmered with inner hatred, but the foreman said that his son should be ashamed to have such a father. The result was a flattened foreman and an unemployed Ivan. They also could not always find a place to live. They moved from one apartment to another, when Ivan was unemployed. The apartments were often cold drafty places with little running water, paper thin walls, and were right in the paths of protests and street riots. Still as bad as they were, they weren't nearly as bad as the times Ivan and Viktor had to sleep on the streets, especially in the winter. Viktor shivered and huddled next to his father as Ivan held his boy in his strong arms and tried to warm him with his body, the only thing that he had left with which to warm him. Ivan felt shame when he saw his shivering freezing son. He ached every time that they returned from the markets and Ivan knew the food he gathered was nowhere near enough to fill his son's stomach. He hurt when Viktor limped because he needed new shoes and a long stretch of unemployment prevented his father from buying them. It all hurt but he never let it show. Ivan returned from work bone tired with sore muscles and dead on his feet but he never let on. Ivan never told Viktor that he was just as frightened, hungry, and felt just as helpless as he did. Instead he always kept a strong front for his son, one who refused to break or be broken. Ivan was angry every day and longed to strike something until he was satisfied. He never struck his son. He remembered how his father took his despair out on his family. Ivan would never do that to his son. Instead he continued training in secret. Before sunrise, before his son woke up and his shifts began, Ivan rose, jogged, exercised, and worked out at a nearby gym. He sparred and practiced. One day he stood in front of a punching bag as he pictured in his head all his enemies. He punched the bag as he called a name: \"Alexei Drago!\" Again! \"Sergei Vobet!\" Another!. \"Igor Sergei Rimsky!\" Another! \"Nikolai Koloff!\" Faster! \"Valentin Popov!\" Harder! \" Apollo Creed!\" Another! Faster! \"Rocky Balboa!\" Faster! Harder! Again! \"Bela Smirnov!\" Harder! Faster! \"Ludmilla Vobet!\" Harder! Faster! Another! \"Yevgeny Koloff!\" Harder! Again! \"The Soviet Union!\" He practically knocked the bag to the ground and sank with relief that his anger had been temporarily satisfied. For now. Every morning he returned to the gym and punched the bag calling his enemies' names to appease his buried rage. He also got attention from some of the local gym owners who wrote referrals for Ivan Drago to be accepted into the Russian Federation Athletics Program. He mailed copies to the Committee and had duplicates made for himself. These letters rested on Ivan's lap on the train. He glanced through them skimming some of the contents that Ivan Drago was in the best shape of his life, that he was a skilled technical competitor, and had shown great resilience and power in his matches. He hoped the referrals would convince the Committee and the Director. Ivan ruffled his son's dark hair as he looked up from his American comic book. Viktor smiled at his father who smiled back and returned to his world of colorful illustrations and brave powerful costumed superheroes and villains. Viktor inherited Ivan's stoicism and quiet. While he was still curious and exhibited flashes of imagination and a child's enthusiasm, he was well aware how serious their situation was. He never asked for toys or anything of that nature always aware that he would do without. He didn't believe in fairy tales or creatures like Grandfather Frost full aware of the reality that surrounded him and his father. Viktor accepted the constant moving and the reduction of food in stride never complaining. One rainy night, shortly after they arrived in Kiev, a police officer ordered them to leave the city block in which they were sleeping. As the two ran, Ivan realized his son left Cheburashka behind. \"Do you want us to go back and get him?\" Ivan asked. Viktor shook his head. \"Nyet, Papa. He's just a toy.\" He said that with such determination that Ivan left the subject alone. While happy times were very rare, they happened on occasion. Sasha and Ayzere's letters were causes for humor, mirth, and support for the father and son. Sometimes Ivan and Viktor engaged in playful wrestling matches where Ivan pretended that his son pinned him. He fell over and as Viktor looked over at his fallen father, Ivan sprang up and tickled his young son. The boy's laughter, heard so seldom these days, was like music to Ivan's heart. While Viktor did not believe in fairy tales, there was one aspect of a child's imagination that Viktor had that Ivan refused to break from him. One day shortly before they left for Russia, Ivan returned from the docks when his son looked up from the glossy book he had been reading, threw it in the air in surprise, and made a great effort to hide it under the bed. Amused Ivan entered trying to retain a straight face. \"Vitya, what are you doing?\" Viktor faked a smile and twiddled his thumbs, \"Nichego.\" Nothing. Ivan sat next to his son. \"And you were reading-\" \"Nichego,\" Viktor repeated. \"Da, ya vizhu\" Ivan said. Yes I see. He reached under the bed. \"So you will not mind if I look under-\" Ivan reached under the bed as Viktor frantically waved his hands and dramatically shook his head mouthing \"Nyet.\". Ivan pulled out not one glossy book but several. \"-here.\" He continued as Viktor face palmed in frustration at getting caught. Ivan looked closely at the books. They were comic books, American comic books written in English. While Ivan could not read English that well, he recognized many of the titles and characters: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, The X Men, The Punisher, Justice League, The Escapist, Luna Moth and other comics. Many of these issues were very old. The Escapist and Luna Moth even had advertisements for a Hollywood film called \"The Scarlet Fox: A Sammy Glick production.\" \"Viktor where did you get these?\" He asked. No one had American things unless they were part of the black market. While the Soviet Union had collapsed, American items were still scant and unaffordable in their district of Kiev. Not many could afford them since they cost so much money. How could his six year old son get a hold of them? \"Boris,\" Viktor answered. Ivan nodded. \"Boris. I should have known.\" Boris Javorski was a Polish émigré boy at Ivan's school whose parents practically ran the local black market. He was the envy of other school children because he often came to school with American items: toys, cameras, rock and pop cassettes, sneakers, bubble gum, VHS tapes, candy, sunglasses, trading cards and others. Children traded their items in for some of his then traded with each other. Viktor was usually able to resist but Ivan supposed will power only went so far. \"And what did you trade to Boris for these?\" Ivan asked. \"My coat,\" Viktor said innocently. Ivan shook his head. \"You are going to regret that decision come winter.\" Ivan said firmly. Ivan patched and unpatched Viktor's old coat so many times that it was practically see through. He needed a new one anyway. \"Do you know anything about these?\" Ivan asked indicating the comic books. \"Well from what Boris told me of their origins\" Viktor said. \" I don't read English so good so sometimes I have to make up what they are doing in the books.\" He held up one comic. \"This is Superman.\" \"Even I know who he is, Vitya,\" Ivan teased. \"He comes from Krypton and is the Man of Steel.\" \"That's right,\" Viktor said. Viktor held up another comic. \"This is Batman.\" Ivan knew who Batman was as well. \"He flies like a bat?\" he teased \"Nyet,\" Viktor said. \"He has very sharp hearing and flies at night?\" Ivan said. \"Nyet,\" Viktor said. \"He is small, brown, has wings, lives in a cave?\" \"Nyet,\" Viktor said getting frustrated. \"Well he does live in a cave. It's his secret laboratory. He dresses up like a bat. His parents were killed so he fights villains out of revenge.\" Ivan nodded and pulled out The Punisher. \"And this one?\" \"That's the Punisher,\" Viktor said. \"He punishes villains because his wife was murdered.\" \"So many of these heroes are out for revenge,\" Ivan said. Viktor shrugged. Then he looked from the page to his father and back again in surprise. \"Papa, he looks like you!\" Ivan looked closer. \"Maybe a little.\" Frankly, Ivan didn't see the resemblance. \"So is he your favorite?\" No, that's not my favorite,\" Viktor pulled out an X Men comic. \"This one is my favorite.\" Ivan looked at the figure that his son pointed to. The cover showed a large muscular man with metal skin. He fought against another man in a yellow suit with long claws. \"His name is Colossus,\" Viktor said. \"He is one of the X Men and he is from Russia.\" \"Is that why you like him so much because he is from Russia?\" Ivan pointed in the direction of their former country, his former country. \"Nyet, Papa,\" Viktor said. \"Because he's you!\" \"I thought you said the other man-the Punisher-was me,\" Ivan said. \"Nyet he just looks like you,\" Viktor said. \"Colossus is you!\" Ivan looked at the picture pretending to examine it closely. \"Well it is not a very good likeness. I don't have metal skin.\" \"Papa,\" Viktor whined. He opened the pages and showed that Colossus, a very strong character, beating someone that Ivan assumed was a villain in red armor who moved things with magnetic hands. \"Boris said he lived on a collective farm and his brother was a cosmonaut and his sister is another X Man but I know the truth. I think Colossus used to be a boxer in Moscow. Now he lives in Kiev and he's poor, but he uses his strength to fight villains.\" He pointed to the villain. \"I make this story your fight with the American. See he's fighting his opponent who he used to battle in the ring but is now a supervillain.\" He pointed to an earlier illustration that showed the man in red fighting a small blue furry creature . \"See the other man defeated Colossus' or your friend and hurt him really bad, so Colossus seeks revenge. You say 'How dare you hurt him, I show you!' So you fight him even though the Mad American-that's what I call him-wants to kill you.\" Viktor turned to the page of Colossus fighting the magnetic man. . \"This is in the story, da?\" Ivan wondered if somehow Viktor knew or guessed the truth. \"Da,\" Viktor said. \"I don't know what the American hated you for-\" He paused as if he waited for his father to tell him. Ivan didn't speak so Viktor continued. \"So I make up that it was revenge like the others.\" \"Something like that,\" Ivan muttered. Of course he wasn't about to say whose friend actually was hurt, who it was who hurt him, and who it was that sought revenge. He flipped through the pages. \"And I win this version of the fight against the Mad American?\" Ivan asked. \"Of course you do,\" Viktor said. He pointed at the last panel where Colossus stood over his enemy triumphant. \"You beat the American because you defeat all villains.\" Ivan was charmed by Viktor's desire to rewrite history with his comics. \"Oh Vitya, how I wish that were true.\" He spoke sadly but he cleared his throat to change the subject. \"Ya vizhu, I fight villains do I?\" Ivan said. \"In between working and caring for my son when do I do this and how is it you have never seen me do this?\" \"Well you don't do it while I'm awake, obviously,\" Viktor said putting his hands on his hips and speaking in a tone like it was a dumb question. \"That would reveal your secret identity!\" Ivan laughed and tickled his son. \"Vitya, you are one strange child.\" After the two settled down. Viktor's lip quivered in fear. \"I am not in trouble about my comic books am I? Boris said I might get in trouble if someone finds out about them.\" Ivan ruffled his son's hair. \"Vitya of course not.\" Viktor didn't understand what he was reading and didn't know whether or not they were American propaganda. He just liked the pictures and stories. If he wanted to have a little imagination and fantasy in his life and think that superheroes really existed and his father was one let him, Ivan thought. Under the circumstances, Ivan was just grateful that none of the comics were Captain America. He couldn't imagine explaining that one to his impressionable son. \"So you won't tell on me?\" Viktor asked. Ivan smiled. \"Would Colossus tell on the other X Men?\" Viktor shook his head as he and his father made up other stories to go with the illustrations and English words. Ivan knew that Russia changed but he was not prepared for how much it had until he and Viktor emerged from the train and walked through Red Square. Ivan couldn't believe that this was the same city that he left. Once everything was sedate and austere. People wore somber colors and went about their business. There was always a feel of quiet and resignation that while wasn't always good was something that Ivan had long grown used to. That wasn't the Moscow that Ivan saw before him. There were bright colors everywhere and in nearly every market, Ivan could see Western merchandise. Characters that he recognized like Superman and Mickey Mouse and clothing and technology brand names that he didn't. Rock and Roll music pumped through the loudspeakers. Everywhere that Ivan and Viktor went, Ivan saw young people dressed in blue jeans and t-shirts and they spoke fast and enthusiastically on any topic. Ivan remembered his shock at seeing his ex-wife made up with her styled hair, large jewelry and pampered body. She looked so different and overdone. Now Ivan saw that same look everywhere. Many women wore heavy cosmetics, several pieces of jewelry, and teased hair. Everything was too bright, too loud, too artificial, too….American. Ivan looked at his former city with derision, confusion, and some longing for the past. Was this why the Soviet Union ended? So the people could become Americans? What happened to the Russia Ivan knew? Was it buried underneath the t-shirts, loud voices, and teased hair? Ivan as much as anyone wanted to see an end to the Soviet Union, but was this the way to go about it? Or was Ivan in the wrong? Shouldn't they be happy after so much control and repression? Had he outgrown his former country or had it outgrown him? Ivan and Viktor checked into a small hotel, which had all of the modern conveniences including a television in the lobby. As Ivan paid for the room in cash, he glanced at the program which was a documentary about the failures of the Soviet system. The focus was on athletics and Ivan winced as footage of his fight with Rocky Balboa shown on the screen. He could hear the sardonic announcer talk about how Ivan Drago had access to the best technology and was known to use anabolic steroids and still managed to be defeated by \"an underdog American.\" The screen then changed to a bloody Rocky telling with a translator \"If I can change and you can change everybody can change!\" Natalya, a young desk clerk in her late teens glanced in surprise from the TV screen to the man before her. \"Aren't you?-\" \"No,\" Ivan said embarrassed. \"I'm not. I'm no one. I get mistaken for him all the time.\" \"Of course you aren't,\" Natalya said clearly not believing him. \"Are things really better here?\" Ivan asked. She nodded and picked up a Walkman from underneath the desk. \"I think so.\" Natalya offered the former boxer to listen through her headphones. \"I love to listen to the music. This is one of my favorites by Sting.\" Ivan listened as she pushed play on her cassette player. He heard the strains of a familiar classical piece, Prokofiev if he remembered correctly from his musical studies at the orphanage. He heard the lyrics: \"We share the same biology regardless of ideology/What might save us me and you/Is if the Russians love their children too.\" Ivan removed the Walkman from his ears and returned it to the desk clerk. \"We do,\" he said glancing at his son watching the television set. Natalya shrugged. \"I just like the song.\" Ivan and Viktor walked by their old apartment. The complex had been torn down and Ivan could see advertisements for newer upscale condominiums. Welcome to the New Moscow, Ivan thought sarcastically. They then walked to Yevgeny Koloff's house. Ivan felt his heart leap in his throat as he knocked on the door. How would Ludmilla greet them? What after all this time would they have to say to each other? Viktor timidly hid behind his father. It made sense Ivan thought sadly, his mother was a complete stranger to him. The door opened as a grey haired maid appeared. A maid, really? Ivan thought in disbelief at his former wife's lover's pretension. What is next a robot servant? \"May I help you Com- uh Ser?\" She asked. Ivan supposed that over seventy years of Communism and \"Comrade this\"and \"Comrade that\" cannot be replaced so easily in eight months. \"I would like to speak to Yevgeny Koloff,\" Ivan said. The maid shook her head. \"No I am sorry but he is not here,\" she said. \"Then do you know of Ludmilla Dra- uh Vobet, Ludmilla Vobet?\" Ivan asked. \"I would have to be a complete idiot to not know my mistress,\" the maid said dryly. Ivan nodded. Of course Ludmilla and Yevgeny were still together. Had she remarried or were they just involved? \"Is she here then?\" The maid shook her head. \"I am sorry, Ser. Neither the master nor the mistress are here. They are in Paris.\" \"Do you know when they will return?\" Ivan asked. \"Not for another month at least,\" the maid said. \"Is there a message that you wish for me to give her?\" Ivan shook his head. There were plenty of messages that he would like to give Ludmilla but none she would like to hear. \"Nyet Spasibo,.\" He stepped from the doorway. \"Come Vitya.\" He took his son's hand and led him away from the house. As Ivan looked back at the house, he thought he saw a slight movement at one of the upstairs curtains as though someone were watching. He peered closer but he saw nothing. Ivan led Viktor to the Fallen Monuments Park. Natalya suggested that Ivan see the place. \"It's where they put all the old things,\" she said. The sun was setting and in the evening, the park looked ominous. Ivan reverently walked through the statues. Busts and sculptures of Lenin, Stalin and other leaders filled the area. He recognized figures made by Soviet-era workshops and their craftsmanship. Viktor stood not moving and shuddered. Ivan suspected that it wasn't from the cold even though the night air was starting to cool. \"This place is strashno, Papa,\" he said. Scary. \"They look like prizraki.\" Ghosts. \"Vitya, you know there are no such things as ghosts,\" Ivan corrected. \"But they look mertvykh,\" Viktor said. Dead. Ivan placed his hands on a sculpture of Felix Dzerzhinsky. How often did he know and memorize these names? How often was he made to honor, revere, practically worship the names of Vladimir Lenin, Karl Marx, Josef Stalin, Dzerzhinsky and others? He and many other children memorized whole chapters of The Communist Manifesto. What did children study in Russia now? Now these leaders, men and women were reduced to rubble observing the changed world around them while they remained frozen in time. Viktor was right. They were dead. Dead men. Dead women. Dead ideals. Relics of the past. Was Ivan a relic as well? Was he as dead as these statues? Ivan could have stayed all night just looking at the statues, still as they were, wondering. Thinking. A small hand tugged at his sleeve. \"Papa can we go now? I don't like it here.\" Ivan returned back to reality at his son's voice. It was so rare that Viktor disagreed or challenged his father about anything. \"Alright, Vitya,\" he said. Ivan arose as he and Vitya prepared to leave. On the way out, they bumped into a blond man with scars on his face. \"Pomilovanje,\" the man said. Pardon. Ivan returned the greeting. \"Come to remember the past?\" the man asked indicating the Monuments Park. Ivan recognized an English accent. The man glanced at Viktor in a way that was somehow regretful and wistful. He waved at the boy who waved back. \"Something like that,\" Ivan said not in the mood to talk. \"You?\" \"I've come to bury mine,\" the man said. The Englishman moved his hand inside his pocket and out of the corner of his eye, Ivan thought he could see a holster with a gun inside. Ivan shrugged. It wasn't his business. The Englishman disappeared as Ivan moved his son forward. \"Come Vitya,we must return to the hotel so we can sleep and go to Elyakovo tomorrow morning.\" Viktor smiled delighted at the prospect of seeing his honorary Uncle Sasha and Aunt Ayzere again. He and his father left the park as a car pulled up driven by an attractive dark haired woman with a dark haired man in the backseat. On the bus to Elyakovo, Viktor chattered in a way that Ivan hadn't heard from him in sometime. He was excited about visiting his Tatiya and Dyadya. Ivan offered a small smile at his son's barrage of words. \"I should show them my comic books,\" Viktor said. \"Dyadya will like them.\" Ivan knew he would. In his letters, Sasha still sent Viktor written portions of epic hero stories like when he orally told them while they traveled during the Breads and Circuses. Epic hero stories like Odysseus, Hercules, Perseus, Theseus, Achilles, Jason and others. \"I'm sure he will talk constantly to you about these books and about everything else,\" Ivan teased remembering his loquacious friend. \"Do you think that when we move to Russia, we might live with them?\" Viktor asked. \"I don't know Vitya,\" Ivan said. \"I do not want to depend on their charity. But we will see them often.\" The driver then called to exit Elyakovo. Ivan picked up his son and carried him out of the bus shifting through several passengers. Elyakovo was a small village so Ivan knew that he should see the Orimenkos' home from the road but he didn't. He had a bad feeling in the pit of his stomach as he set Viktor down. Father and son walked down the road to his friend's home. What was left of it. Ivan and Viktor stared in shock at the remnants of a once cheerful but impoverished house. Only ashes and the framework of the hut remained. \"What happened Papa?\" Viktor said. \"I do not know Vitya,\" Ivan said. \"I do not know.\" \"Hey,\" a strident voice commanded. Ivan and Viktor turned to see a man glaring at them. He wore a long coat but Ivan could tell by his stride that he was once a soldier. \"Who are you and what is your purpose here?\" The man asked. \"Who are you?\" Ivan asked. \"Vitaly Grinkov,\" the man said. \"I am in administration here. I ask you again who are you and what is your purpose?\" \"I am here to see Sasha and Ayzere Orimenko,\" Ivan asked. \"Who are they?\" He asked. Ivan was confused. Elyakovo was not by any means a large village. Grinkov would know who they were. Something about his indifferent face told Ivan that he didn't care who they were. \"They were the old couple who used to live here,\" he said. \"Sasha is a large Ukrainian man with a white beard. Ayzere is a small dark haired Kazakh woman. They used to attend the Bread- uh prize fights.\" Grinkov nodded in realization. \"I know who you are talking about. Are you a relation?\" \"Nyet,\" Ivan replied. \"I knew them.\" \"They are both dead,\" Grinkov said. The air was silent except for Viktor's gasp. \"When did this happen?\" Ivan asked. \"March of the previous year,\" he answered. \"How did they die?\" Ivan asked. Grinkov responded dispassionately. \"They were considered political prisoners scheduled to be removed to Siberia. They resisted especially the woman. She was shot after she was raped.\" \"And Sasha?\" Grinkov looked like he couldn't even remember their names. Ivan wanted to kill him. The least he could do was remember their names. \"The man.\" Ivan said. \"Ah he attacked after his wife died and he was shot in the stomach,\" he said. \"Surely, you know what happens after that.\" Ivan nodded. He remembered from his time in Afghanistan. Getting shot in the stomach was the worst place to get shot. In the head or chest brings immediate death. In the stomach is a long painful death that can last hours. \"He also died,\" Ivan said softly. \"After two hours,\" Grinkov said. Viktor began to sob uncontrollably. Ivan gave his son's shoulders a tight squeeze. He forced himself to remain calm but inside he was just as sad as his son. Sasha that kind talkative man and Ayzere who protected her loved ones like a fearsome tigress were dead? Because they were considered political prisoners? Ivan lowered his head in respect. \"Where are they buried?\" Ivan asked. He wanted to pay respects. Grinkov looked confused. \"Buried? They were not buried. They were burned with their home.\" Ivan shook his head. \"They could not even have the decency to bury them?\" \"You are not a soldier,\" Grinkov guessed. \"I was,\" Ivan answered. \"Then you know that there is no time for such things,\" he replied. \"They must be an example to all dissidents.\" Vitaly Grinkov spoke with such conviction and such a sadistic pleasure that Ivan knew he was no mere observer to the events. \"You were a part of it,\" Ivan accused He did not even argue. \"I was,\" he said. \" It was a waste of time. They were peasants, nobodies just some old couple.\" Ivan stared in silence. Viktor spoke for both of them. \"They weren't just nobodies! They were my Tatiya and Dyadya! They were our friends!\" He pushed forward ready to attack but his father pulled him back and held his shoulders. Ivan stared wordlessly at the man who smiled and began to laugh at the boy's impudence. \"What does it matter? They were old and weak. If they died, they died!\" Grinkov laughed but that ended quickly when he saw the expression on Ivan's face. Ivan struck hard and fast. When Grinkov fell down, Ivan's rage still consumed him so he picked him up and beat him again and again. At first Grinkov was too confused but he got up and started beating Ivan as well. Ivan beat him again. \"For what you did to them, you should die!\" Viktor stood behind him aiming his fists and studying his father's fighting skills. He copied his moves and yelled, \"Get him, Papa!\" Vitaly Grinkov moved away from Ivan as he picked up a piece of wood planning on defending himself. \"I was only following orders! A former soldier would understand that!\" Ivan held his opponent by the lapel pinning him against a wooden fence. \"Who gave such an order?\" At first he didn't respond but Ivan shook him again. \"I ask you again who gave such an order?\" \"Our captain,\" he said. \"Who is your captain?\" When he received no answer, Ivan spoke quiet and deadly. \"I do not like repeating myself who is your captain?\" \"Bela Smirnov,\" Grinkov stammered. Ivan almost dropped him in surprise. Smirnov? That officious Captain who ordered the end of the prize fights and Ivan's deportation. \"Where is Smirnov now?\" Ivan asked. \"He took a bullet to his own head shortly after the Coup,\" the soldier explained. \"I suffered as well. I was removed from the Army and am stuck in administration in this backwater village.\" \"That doesn't compare to what happened to them!,\" He continued to beat the man bloody until he fell to the ground. Ivan picked up the wooden plank that the man dropped and held it over Grinkov's head. He wanted to kill or at least blind him. \"Who are you?\" Grinkov asked. Ivan knew the perfect answer to that question, one that would make Sasha proud. \"I am Nobody,\" he said. \"Papa don't,\" Viktor said. Ivan looked towards his son. Viktor went from supportive to terrified. He may have been alright with his father beating the man and avenging their friends, but he did not want to see his father kill someone in cold blood, someone who was clearly no longer in any position to defend themselves. Ivan dropped the plank and reached for his son. Viktor looked scared of his father, but he slowly approached him. \"Come we will leave,\" Ivan said. He turned away but not before he turned back to Vitaly Grinkov still paralyzed with fear. \"You have Nobody to thank for your troubles-Nobody but yourself!\" Ivan declared before he kicked him in the ribs. Ivan stood in front of the Soviet-uh Russian Federation Athletics Department Building. The building looked older slightly faded but still looked the same except the hammer and sickle flags were gone replaced by the new red, white, and blue flag. The inside was sleeker and more modern with new office equipment and a larger staff. Ivan glanced at the walls. The imposing pictures of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin, and Josef Stalin as well as the illustrated advertisements showing the Soviet Athletes with their giant bodies, domineering features, and their flags and USSR symbols were gone. Instead they were replaced with corporate advertisements, photographs of Athletes in their events, and a portrait of Russian Federation President Boris Yeltsin. Idly Ivan wondered if the original office decor was also at Fallen Monuments Park. Ivan sat next to Viktor as they waited. He wouldn't admit to it but Ivan was nervous so much that his hands were shaking. He put one hand on top of the other to stop them. He rested his now still hands on top of his folder of recommendation letters. He mentally went over his answers. He was going to be prepared this time. He was ready. An assistant called his name. Ivan arose and almost took Viktor's hand but then he remembered. The Committee would certainly mention Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa. Ivan was not about to let his son learn that he was a killer and failure. He knew about his father's match with Rocky but somehow the boy turned it around in his head as a victory. Unlike his father's last meeting, Viktor was old enough to understand what they were saying, process it in his head, and change his perspective of his father based on that. Ivan could not let that happen. Let Viktor hold onto the one good thing he has left in his life: the belief that his father is a hero, Ivan thought. Don't let him know the real me. Ivan knelt down. \"Vitya, I need you to wait here. I will be a few minutes.\" Viktor looked disappointed. \"Alright Papa.\" Khoroshiy Mal'chik,\" Ivan said. Good boy. Ivan kissed his son on the forehead. \"I will be right back.\" Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Viktor open his Colossus comic book. Ivan hoped the Colossus in Viktor's life could face his enemies and win just like Viktor believed he could. Ivan walked into the committee meeting room. He felt his mouth go dry and his palms sweat. It was strange. When he was in the ring, he had no problem defending himself. He could fight with his fists or a look. Now he had to fight with his voice, and he was scared to death. No wonder I let other people speak for me he thought. He remembered when he first encountered the Committee and how other people talking for him became such a crutch that he was unable to speak for himself. Not this time. From now on, Ivan Drago alone would speak. No buffers, no promoters, no managers, no nothing. Just Ivan. He opened his folder as eight Committee members entered except the Director. The Committee members were a larger number than last time. They numbered nine instead of seven. Ivan recognized five from the previous encounter. Two new members were women and one was a younger man. Ivan kept his eyes focused staring the members down the same way he used to with boxing opponents. None of the opponents scared him and he was not about to let some people in business suits frighten him either. He was ready. He was confident. He would win. Then the Director of the Russian Federation Athletics Department entered the room and sat down. Ivan felt a chill go through him as Nikolai Koloff, his former manager/promoter gave Ivan a smug grin. \"The meeting to discuss the reinstatement of Ivan Alexeyevich Drago to the Russian Federation Boxing Team Begins now.\" He banged his gavel. \"Privet Ivan.\" Hello Ivan. One of the members handed Koloff the folder. \"I do not need to reread these tedious files. I am well acquainted with this case.\" He said. \"Drago you are aware that you must tell the truth and that your responses will be researched so lying is pointless. Do you understand?\" \"Da Director, \"Ivan said barely forcing the title out of his mouth. \"Then let us proceed,\" Koloff said. \"You do have your tongue do you not?\" The Committee members laughed as Ivan said through clenched teeth. \"Da Director.\" The members asked him various questions. \"Have you tested positive for steroids?\" \"Nyet,\" Ivan answered. \"I have not taken any in over six years.\" A female member raised her hand. \"Drago your letters are quite impressive and it is clear that you are still physically fit. At your age 30 years old are you still able to box as you did when you were on the Soviet team?\" \"I believe so,\" he said. \"My strength is as good as it was and I believe that my stamina is better than it was. I am able to last longer in the ring without tiring.\" \"According to these letters your punching average is significantly lower than it was previously,\" a male member said. \"Before you were quite impressive at 1850, 2100. It is now at 700 lbs.\" \"Disappointingly average,\" Koloff interjected as though average was the lowest rung on the ladder. \"Well since my suspension in 1986, I have not had access to the higher quality equipment and had to rely on what I had,\" Ivan said. \"I am able to improve and implement my technique rather than relying solely on blunt force.\" Another female member spoke. \"Drago because this country is in the process of great political and socioeconomic change, we have to ask about your politics. You were once held as the Soviet Premiere fighter and was a Captain awarded the Order of Lenin. Do you have a fondness for those days?\" Ivan understood the real question. Was he a part of any resistance group to the new government hoping to return to the glories of the Soviet Union and Communism. \"I do not,\" Ivan said. \"I have seen much in the past five years that has made me question my former allegiances.\" \"Are you involved in any organizations in the Ukraine?\" She asked. \"Nyet,\" Ivan responded. \"Do you have a preference to be a part of the Russian or the Ukrainian team?\" She asked. \"Your mixed breeding, half-Russian and half-Ukrainian suggests that you could go either way.\" \"Russia,\" Ivan answered. \"The Ukraine is where I was sent and where I currently live but Russia is my home.\" Another male member spoke. \"Drago you have not fought in any matches professionally nor amateurishly in the past three years. What have you been doing with yourself during that time?\" \"I have been working and caring for my child,\" Ivan said. Koloff gave him a sarcastic look that practically screamed 'Are you sure he's your child?' \"I am currently employed as a stevedore in Kiev.\" \"You are divorced and your child is in your sole custody correct?\" he asked. \"Da\", Ivan answered. \"And you still train?\" The first woman asked obviously impressed. \"Every morning before dawn,\" Ivan answered. \"Should we accept you to return will this be a hardship for either of you?\", one of the men asked. \"My son and I are used to hardships much worse than that,\" Ivan said dryly. \"But it will not be.\" The younger male member raised his hand. \"Drago you were responsible for the death of another boxer in the ring. I believe you can understand our reluctance to reinstate you from that alone. The world will be watching us to show that we are different than who we were. How can we be sure that such a thing will not happen as it did with Apollo Creed?\" Ivan considered. \"For one I am not as powerful a fighter as I was. I no longer destroy whatever I hit.\" He sneered at Koloff who glowered. \"Also because I have no steroids in my system I am a more controlled fighter.\" \"If an interviewer mentions your previous fight against Creed how will you address that?\" \"That I was a different person then,\" Ivan said. \"I have learned much. That has caused me to reconsider the things that I have done and to account more for the weaknesses of others. Apollo Creed was an older man and I should have taken that into consideration.\" There was a tense silence as Koloff raised his hand. \"I have one final question, Drago. You have proven yourself to be an embarrassment, a disgrace to Russian sports! Much time and money was wasted training and promoting you. You humiliated your country in the eyes of the world and made a fool out of all of us! You are fortunate that you are not in Siberia for those actions!\" Ivan glared at his former manager. For a moment it was just the two of them: manager and boxer. \"Da Director?\" He said not wanting to play his hand. \"Then my question is this, why should this Committee no this sport waste it's time with you again? You are clearly not worth any of that time or promotion or money! You lost to a soft older American, Rocky Balboa. How do you account for that and how can we guarantee this won't happen again?\" \"As I mentioned, Director,\" Ivan said. \"I am both a different boxer and a different person. My style and techniques have improved as did my stamina. If Russia is ready to be a different country and is ready to put the past behind them then I should be permitted to as well. I am a fighter and I am prepared to fight once again.\" \"Fight to win for you or for Russia,\" Koloff said. \"Both,\" Ivan answered. Koloff looked to the other Committee members as they talked quietly. Ivan stood at attention. In what seemed like an eternity, the Committee members faced the former boxer. Their faces revealed nothing except Koloff's. His leer told Ivan everything he needed to know. \"It is decided Ivan Alexeyevich Drago, you will not be permitted to be reinstated to join the Russian Federation team.\" Ivan stood stone faced and silent as Koloff continued. \"We might have forgiven a death in the ring, we were even going to overlook your other problems.\" Like the steroids you gave me, Ivan wanted to say. \"But this Committee cannot afford to waste it's time on a boxer who disgraced himself and his country. The truth is Drago you are old! You failed us in your prime and we cannot conceive of reintroducing a proven failed has-been into the sport when we have so many younger boxers. Now by the suggestions of my illustrious colleagues\" Ivan could hear him say 'Not my own.' \"Your ban has been slightly lifted. You are still forbidden from participating in the sport. Though if you wish to train others in the Ukraine that is entirely up to you. However not as a Russian! This case is closed.\" He banged the gavel. Ivan was furious as he exited the meeting room. Viktor looked up. \"How did it-oh?\" He saw his father's expression and realized how it went. Ivan moved his son off the chair. \"So what happens now?\" He asked. \"We return to Kiev,\" Ivan said knowing that they had no other choice. \"There is nothing for us here.\" Viktor took his father's hand as the two walked out the door. Ivan furiously threw his copies of the letters, the useless letters, in the garbage outside. They reached the cold air of the outdoors when an unwelcome voice called from behind. \"Drago a word with you,\" Koloff said. Ivan and Viktor turned around as Ivan faced his former manager. There were times when Ivan wasn't sure who he hated more Nikolai Koloff or Rocky Balboa. No he knew. At least Ivan could respect Rocky. \"I was not informed that you were the director,\" Ivan said. \"I was promoted two weeks ago and I told them not to tell you,\" Koloff said. \"Why?\" Ivan asked. \"And miss the expression on your face?\" Koloff said with a laugh then he became serious. \"You wasted your time coming here,\" Koloff said. \"Our minds were made as soon as we received those infernal letters.\" \"All of yours or just yours?\" Ivan asked. \"Well mine was, the others needed a bit more persuasion.\" \"From your pocket,\" Ivan guessed. Koloff just smiled at the accusation of bribery. \"You see Ivan you came here probably thinking this was the New Russia, but no it's the same old Russia. Whether we are Communist or Capitalist, the true power lies not in ideology but in the ruble,\" Koloff said. \"That is something people like you never seem to understand. All we have to do is make the right friends, chant the proper slogans, turn some coats, keep money hidden away in far- away accounts, and pass a few rubles around to the appropriate causes or the right influential people. Then people like me will always rule over people like you.\" \"A few months of excitement followed by years of corruption and tyranny with the same faces still leading us,\" Ivan said quoting Sasha's words. How right those words were now. \"If you like,\" Koloff said not bothering to deny it. \"But one thing we cannot and will not abide is failure! You failed us once and I do not tolerate a weak foolish failure of a man who needed to be blood doped before he could show anything resembling real talent!\" In a fury Viktor let go of his father's hand and ran up to the Director. He clawed at and punched Koloff like a feral cat gone mad. \"How dare you say that about my father!\" Koloff laughed as he pushed the boy off of him. \"Ivan you might as well spend your time training this puppy for all the good it will do!\" \"You leave my son out of this,\" Ivan warned. Viktor ran back to Koloff and attacked him again. \"My father is not a failure! My father is a hero!\" Koloff calmly removed himself from the boy. Ivan held Viktor by the shoulders as he struggled trying to fight the older man. Koloff knelt down and grinned at Ivan as if he found the coup de grace in destroying Ivan's life. He leaned over to Viktor and looked the boy directly in the eye. \"Your father is a killer!\" \"Koloff tishina,\" Ivan said deadly. Silence. Viktor's mouth dropped open but he still glared firmly at his adversary. \"You are a liar!\" Koloff had an expression of false surprise. \"You mean he never told you about Apollo Creed, the American man he killed in the ring?\" Viktor struggled. \"It's not true, tell him Papa!\" The boy's eyes met with his father. Ivan didn't respond. Didn't react. \"Tell him Papa.\" Viktor said again this time his voice was less determined and more pleading. \"Papa?\" \"Oh yes your father the hero murdered a man in the boxing ring in the second round. It was during an exhibition match where was it again Ivan in Los Angeles?\" He expected no answer so Koloff continued. \"I remember now, It was in Las Vegas! Why do you think he fought that American Rocky Balboa?\" Tears fell down Viktor's face and he stopped struggling. \"Creed was his closest friend. In fact it was Balboa who your father was supposed to fight but Creed stepped in instead. Well your father did what he did to Creed. Balboa challenged him. So your father fought Balboa and lost! Honestly, we would have been better off promoting and training Balboa at least he succeeded.\" Ivan looked downward at his son. The boys expression just about broke his heart. Viktor not only believed Koloff but when he met his father's eyes, he knew it was true. Koloff rose and turned around. \"Well I am finished here for good I hope. Dasvidaniya, Ivan. I really hope never to see you again.\" He was about to walk away when Ivan removed himself from holding his son. \"Nikolai,\" he called bitterly. Koloff turned around just as Ivan's fist met his face. \"700 lbs is still a good punch,\" Ivan mocked. \"Dasvidaniya, Nikolai.\" Ivan then motioned his son forward. \"Come Vitya. Viktor stood still for a moment. Ivan then waved his son forward. \"Vitya, come.\" Viktor absently flipped through his comic books until he pulled out Colossus. He slowly walked to the garbage can and threw the comic in the trash before he joined his father. Ivan and Viktor were silent during the return trip to Kiev. Ivan shook his head remembering all of the foolish fantasies that he had for a better life for himself and his son. It would never happen now. All they would have from now one would be Kiev, poverty, and each other. Ivan glanced at his son who looked out the window in sadness avoiding his father's gaze. Ever since Koloff revealed what Ivan did, Viktor pulled away from his father as though he were afraid of him. Ivan unlocked the door to their apartment as he and Viktor entered. He picked up the mail knowing most of them were money statements saying how much he owed. Ivan thumbed through them to see a personal letter with familiar handwriting: his handwriting. He barely acknowledged the \"Return to Sender\" on the front or the unsealed lip in the back. He was used to Ludmilla returning his letters except he looked at the return date. It would have been sent back while Ivan and Viktor were in Russia. He realized that Ludmilla had been in Russia the whole time and may have even known they were there. He thought someone was watching them at Yevgeny Koloff's house. Now he knew. Ivan tossed his letter to Ludmilla in the trash then sank next to the kitchen table. He buried his heads in his hands feeling like he was moving through ice cold water. He never felt so alone. So defeated. Ivan tucked his son into bed and sat over him smoothing his hair. He sat next to his son in silence until Viktor's small voice quivered. \"Did you mean to kill the American?\" Stunned at such a mature question coming from a six year old, Ivan considered. Did he? He couldn't remember what was going through his head at the time. He was barely conscious of the shouting all around him from Creed's supporters. He remembered one probably Duke saying that it was supposed to be an exhibition. Didn't Ivan shove the referee? Did that mean he didn't want the fight to be stopped? All he could remember were his gloved fists connecting to Creed's body and him not striking back. He remembered the final punch and Creed going down. He remembered the chaos and Rocky and Duke running towards him. He remembered Mary Anne's wail from across the room. He remembered Apollo lying on the ground and shaking and the blood. He always remembered the shaking body and the blood. Ivan looked directly at his son. \"I don't think that I did.\" \"So why did you do it?\" Viktor asked. Ivan wasn't sure how to answer that. He thought of the things that he had been taught, the training that he received, everything. \"Well many reasons,\" he said. \"I was very powerful to the point that I didn't know my own strength. I had been given something that I should not have taken and the American was much older than me. His age made him weak.\" Sure whatever helps you sleep at night, Ivan could hear a sardonic voice in his head. It sounded familiar to Ivan somehow. \"So it was an accident?\" Viktor asked. Ivan nodded. \"Da, that's all it was an accident that he died in the ring.\" 'Died in the ring? ' The voice mocked 'Died in the ring?' Why don't you just say it. You killed a man! Ivan silently begged the voice to be silent realizing that the voice had an American accent. In fact it sounded like an American black man. \"That's why the American hated you,\" Viktor realized. \"Because of his friend just like that awful man said. That's why he was able to defeat you.\" Ivan nodded. \"It is like I told you. Hatred made Balboa a warrior.\" The voice continued. Or it could be Balboa was a better boxer than you and a better man than you'll ever be! The type of man who would go halfway across the world to avenge his friends while you just let yours get killed by the Soviets! Oh you weren't there you are thinking, well whose fault was that? Those people took you in, kept you in the fight, and helped look after your son and how did you repay them? By not being there when they needed you because you were in exile. Oh you fought one of the guys who shot them? Well congratulations, but you ignored them! That's why you hated Grinkov so much. He's young you! A mindless grunt soldier who was just following orders. To Hell with your friends. That's why you fought him. You couldn't bear to hear your 24-year-old words coming out of his mouth! Admit it, Drago you pulled the trigger on Creed just as much as Grinkov did on Sasha and Ayzere! \"Nyet,\" Ivan moaned. He rubbed his forehead and swayed back and forth. \"Papa what's wrong?\" Viktor asked. Ivan took his hands off his forehead. \"It is nothing,\" Ivan said. \"Nichego.\" Ivan sat in silence waiting for the voice to say something else. What was going on? Was he going insane or was he haunted by the ghost of Apollo Creed? \"So the American thinks that you are a villain?\" Viktor asked. Why do you say thinks, the voice sneered. He knows you are a villain! \"Viktor, there is something that you need to understand,\" Ivan looked directly at his son. \"The world isn't like your comic books. It is not made up of heroes and villains. It is made up of people who sometimes make the wrong decisions and commit terrible actions and they have to live with the consequences of those actions for a long time. Apollo Creed died in the ring because I hated him. To me, he was an American and my enemy. It became easy for me to beat him. Rocky Balboa defeated me because he hated me. I was a Russian and responsible for his friend's death so it became easy for him to defeat me. I am not a hero. I am just a man who did something terrible and have had to pay for it ever since.\" The voice mocked him as Ivan put his hand to one ear to cover up the voice. Which something terrible are we talking about Ivan murdering or losing? \"Do you still hate Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa?\" Viktor asked. \"Are they still your enemies?\" Ivan winced. \"I hate that you had to find out this way. I hate that you are looking at me now with such fear. I could never hurt you, Vitya. You know that. I hate that we live here and now I know we will never get out. I hate that no matter how much Russia has changed we are still in exile so we have not. I hate that you have no mother. I hate that our only friends are dead. I hate that we have so many enemies. I hate that my defeat made all of this possible. I hate that the one thing that I excelled at has been taken from me. I hate that I lost and I hate that Creed died. So you ask if I still hate them and are they still my enemies? Then I will have to say, da I do.\" Viktor thought long and hard. He put his hand on top of his father's. \"Then your enemies are my enemies,\" he said firmly. Ivan wrapped his arms around his son and held him tightly. He could almost ignore the voice taunting him, Yes you're a really excellent father aren't you? Raise that boy to hate. Maybe he'll become a failed boxer like his old man. Ivan stood inside the MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas alone just like before that fight with Creed. The casino was silent eerily silent except someone danced onto the stage and sang to himself \"Living in America, eye to eye station to station.\" The man came closer as he removed his hat and cape still singing to himself. \"Hand to hand across the nation,\" he turned to face Ivan as he finished. \"Got to have a celebration! I feel good!\" He smiled. \"Hi there Drago. Looks like you came for another American boxing lesson.\" \"What am I doing here Creed?\" Ivan asked suspiciously. Apollo Creed gave an icy grin that frightened Ivan. The little he had remembered of Creed, he seemed like a gregarious jovial sort not cold like Ivan. \"Why it's simple Ivan, I'm taking you back to where you lost.\" \"I lost in Moscow,\" Ivan said. \"To Balboa.\" \"No you lost long before that, boy,\" Creed said. \"And now you're gonna learn the hard way!\" He took out his gloves. \"Now come on it's time to go to school!\" Their gloves touched like before and just like before Ivan's gloves did not move but this time Creed did not show fear or intimidation. \"This time, Drago you will lose.\" He said. Ivan managed to get a few punches in as Creed continued to pummel him. \"How do you like it Drago? You like it, Ivanushka-Durachok?\" He pounded him again and again. Ivan held up his arms to block but Creed showed no mercy. \"You still see me, Drago? You still see my body in your mind? You hear my voice? You were never a good boxer! You were always a failure! You were doped up that's the only reason you ever won!\" With each verbal blow Creed gave Ivan another physical one. Ivan collapsed to the ground out of energy and unable to fight back. Ivan looked up at Apollo through bloody eyes. \"Don't worry Ivan,\" Creed said. \"If you die, you die!\" Ivan sprang out of bed. He placed back and forth and ran his hands through his hair. His dream encounter with Apollo still fresh in his mind. Ivan walked over to his son still asleep on his bed. Ivan leaned down to kiss him on the forehead. Ivan glanced out the window at the light on the horizon revealing that morning had come. Ivan had to silence the voice in his head, the dreams, the emotions that were threatening to drive him to insanity. He needed to find something productive to do something to get his mind off of his rejections from Russia, the deaths of Sasha and Ayzere, his memories of Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa, and the emotions that would not leave. He put on his tracksuit and shoes. Even though he could not box, the least he could do is work out so when he came home he would be too exhausted to listen or care. He opened the apartment door, stepped outside, then broke into a run. He recited the names of his enemies adding Vitaly Grinkov and changing the Soviet Union to Mat Rossiya, Mother Russia, said very sarcastically. He repeated them almost like a mantra or the ramblings of a lunatic. A year later, Ivan stood over his and Viktor's laundry methodically washing them in the sink. He moved his hands along a pair of Viktor's jeans observing the holes in them. They would need to be patched again. Nothing changed in their lives. Ivan continued to slave away at the docks. They had to move once again to another apartment when the old one's rent rose too high. Viktor continued to go to school and was friendless. Many children taunted and bullied him because of their poverty which manifested itself in that Viktor's clothing were often worn and he didn't always have food. Though Ivan really doubted those children had it any better at home. As children would do, they bullied another child that they felt was worse off than them. Many of the locals in their district spat on Ivan calling him a nobody, a failure. Ivan wasn't sure if they still recognized him or more than likely they thought of him as they did many others, a beggar a poor waste of human life. Ivan looked at his reflection through the window. He was beginning to resemble a beggar. He was still strong and built but the suffering and poverty were beginning to reveal themselves. Ivan's once blond hair was now prematurely graying and he was pale with hollowed sunken cheeks, stubble on his chin, and lines on his face. Ivan ran his tongue along his teeth and felt the blood forming from them. They were going bad and yellowing. His back was permanently in pain and his head constantly ached. Ivan was 31 years old and began to look and feel like a man twice that age. He was still tortured by thoughts of Apollo Creed and Rocky Balboa as well as the nightmares. Some were even more graphic. One had him lying on the ground and seeing his father standing before him. This time it was he who begged his father for help and Alexei who refused to move. Another dream he saw the Orimenkos hut burn down as their bodies lay among the ashes. Captain Bela Smirnov stood next to Ivan still in his Army uniform and patted him on the back. \"Good Drago,\" he said. \"Anything for Russia,\" Ivan said sadistically, dropping the gasoline can that he just used. The dream that hurt the most was one where Ivan saw Viktor running through Yevgeny Koloff's house in delight. \"Papa!\" He shouted. Ivan held out his outstretched arms but Viktor ran past him as Yevgeny Koloff picked Viktor up and kissed him. \"I missed you, Papa.\" \"I hope you have one for me,\" a laughing female voice said. \"I missed you too Mama,\" Viktor said as he hugged and kissed Ludmilla just as fiercely as he did Yevgeny. Ivan helplessly raised his fists to strike Yevgeny and Ludmilla but his hands went right through them. \"No you stay away from my son!\" Ivan commanded but they didn't hear him. Yevgeny laughed and teased. \"Well since our son is so delighted to see us I guess he won't want to see the gifts we bought him.\" \"No I want to,\" Viktor begged. His parents laughed as they took the boy's hand. He marveled at the bicycle and hugged them again. \"Spasibo, Papa!\" He said to Yevgeny. \"No Vitya, I'm your father not him!\" Ivan yelled. They ignored him as Viktor returned to his gifts and read one of the cards. \"This is for always being a winner,\" Viktor read and opened the package to see a pair of new boxing gloves. \"Thank you Mama and Papa. You are winners too not failures.\" \"Like your birth father,\" Ludmilla said. \"Who?\" Viktor asked genuinely confused. Ivan frantically shook his head not believing what he heard. How could his son not know him? \"Vitya, I am your father,\" he said. But the boy ignored him. \"Vitya! Vitya!\" The nightmares were so overpowering that Ivan found it difficult to return to sleep. Some nights he didn't sleep at all but when that happened he stayed awake with his thoughts and regrets that continued to torment him. Sometimes Apollo's voice continued to mock and laugh at him. Ivan was too fatigued to debate which one was worse: the ongoing nightmares or the sleepless remorse. Instead he just threw himself into work, exercise, and caring for Viktor mentally receding the screams from the past into dull moans that less sharp never went away. Ivan placed the jeans on the clothing rack to dry and glanced at his watch. Viktor should be home from school soon. Looking out the window, he could see a pack of abandoned dogs attacking a stray. Though the stray was larger than them and barked back the other dogs clawed and bit him. The dog was seriously injured but continued to fight back against his pursuers. The dogs turned around the corner as Ivan put one of Viktor's shirts into the sink. A commotion broke into his thoughts. He looked out the window and saw Viktor surrounded by three older boys. They laughed, kicked, and punched Viktor. Viktor fell to the ground and at first Ivan wanted to run outside to protect his son but what he saw made him stop for a moment. Viktor sprang up and sauntered over to the largest boy. Without another word, he punched the other boy sending him to the ground. The boy sprang up and fought back. Ivan watched fascinated as Viktor managed to take a few swings and defend himself. The other two boys also fought Viktor sending him to the ground. Ivan pounded on the window not wanting Viktor to get seriously hurt. \"Hey,\" he yelled and pounded on the window. The boys looked up as Ivan ran outside and faced them. \"Get out of here, \" he yelled as he picked Viktor up. \"Teper idi!\"Go now! The boys were stunned at first but Ivan shouted again. \"Teper idi!\" The boys ran as if for their lives. Ivan washed Viktor's hair over the sink as the boy gasped and hyperventilated. \"I tried not to cry in front of them,\" Viktor said. \"I know Vitya, I know,\" Ivan said. He washed his son's face with a dish rag washing away the blood and cuts. \"You know you were quite a fighter out there.\" \"But they defeated me,\" Viktor said. \"Three against one is hardly a fair fight,\" Ivan said. \"Still you held your own, gave a few hard swings, and even made the other boy bleed. In fact how would you like for me to train you to become a boxer?\" Despite the pain Viktor managed to give a wide are grin. \"Da, I would love for you to. When?\" Ivan thought. Talent like that could not afford to be wasted. \"We start tomorrow evening after school. Today you need to get some food in you and a good night's rest.\" Viktor nodded as they shook hands ready for the lessons. The next day, Ivan paced back and forth angrily. Where the Hell was that boy? He was about to leave to look for him when Viktor entered the room carrying a bag.. \"The first thing that you will learn is to never be late! Now where were you?\" Viktor opened the bag. \"I had to get these.\" He showed his father a pair of boxing gloves. \"Where did you get those?\" Ivan asked. \"I traded my comic books to Boris,\" Viktor said determined without a trace of regret. Ivan nodded and led his son outside. \"Are you ready Viktor?\" He asked emphasizing his son's formal name. The time for childhood diminutive names was over. Viktor stood straight. \"I am ready…..Father.\" That night Ivan stood over his sleeping son. The boy was of course inexperienced but was determined, ferocious, and persistent. No doubt he would make a good boxer maybe even a better one than his father. For the first time in a year, Ivan felt hopeful about the future. It would take years of study and training but Viktor would learn. Ivan could afford to be patient as he would wait for the date when it would be Viktor Drago not Ivan who would step into the ring and hold up his fists in triumph. Viktor Drago would be the one who would get back everything his father had lost. No Ivan Drago would not allow his son to cry thinking of the things they lost. Instead Viktor would fight. Viktor would train. Viktor would win. Viktor would always win. Ivan also glanced sadly at his young son, smoothed back his hair, and wished that he didn't have to do it at all. Author's Notes: Incidentally I remember where I was when I heard about the Coup D'etat. I was 14 years old and was watching the movie, Romancing the Stone in my room when the news flashed along the screen that Mikhail Gorbachev had died. Of course later that night, on the news they revealed that he was still alive. My memories of his resignation are fuzzy but since it was New Year's Eve, we were probably watching Dick Clark's Rockin Eve. The bit where Viktor wants honey and his father says it's too expensive comes from a poem (I don't remember the author's name) in which an American woman lived for a time in Russia with her children and had a similar experience with them wanting honey and bread and she refuses for the same reason. A lot of people, myself included, compare Creed II to Cobra Kai in that in both cases we get a sympathetic portrayal of a former 80's villain: Ivan Drago and Johnny Lawrence. So when I wrote the scene where Ivan is telling Viktor his version of the events of Rocky IV and later Viktor retells the story through his X Men comic book, I was greatly inspired by a similar scene in Cobra Kai where Johnny tells his version of the Karate Kid to his protégée, Miguel. The Georgia the Country/Georgia the US state bit is a running gag that my family have whenever the country is mentioned. Being Americans, we joke about the state whenever the country is mentioned. (I would guess it's the other way around for Europeans. Someone mentions the US state and they think it's the country.) I think of the scene where Ivan punches the punching bag while thinking of his enemies as his \"No Easy Way Out\" moment. It also reminds me of Arya Stark's vengeance list on Game of Thrones. While most of the comic book characters are actual ones, The Escapist and Luna Moth are from the awesome novel, The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay by Michael Chabon. The Auburn Red Fanfiction Bylaws have a subclause which reads : \"Beware of Gratuitous Cameo/Reference to Other Fanfics.\" This time The Escapist and Luna Moth have ads for The Scarlet Fox which is a movie produced by Sammy Glick in my What Makes Sammy Run? Fanfic My Father Sammy Glick. (Incidentally that fic also shouts out to Kavalier and Clay a few times such as when Sammy Glick's older son Max gives his younger son, Chris an Escapist League of the Golden Key Decoder Ring as a symbol of brotherhood.) Of course there is a nod to Dolph Lundgren's other role as The Punisher. The song that Ivan hears through the Walkman is \"Russians\" by Sting, another great inspiration for this fic. It reflects many of the themes of this fic and the Rocky and Creed movies in general how Rocky, Creed, and Drago are more similar than different particularly that \"they love their children too.\" As much as I love the song I always felt the refrain should have been \"I know the Russians love their children too\" to prove the theme that we are all the same. I always imagined that a Russian parent hearing the song for the first time would have the same reaction Ivan had. (\"We do.\") Ivan and Viktor's trip through the Fallen Monuments Park is partly based on the scene in Goldeneye (my favorite James Bond movie) where Bond confronts Alec Trevelyan there and also from my favorite Percy Bysshe Shelley poem \"Ozymandias\": \"Look on my works ye mighty and despair.\" In fact if you read closely, you will see a tribute to Goldeneye in that the blond scarred Englishman that Ivan bumps into is none other than Alec Trevelyan/006 himself and the man and woman in the car are Bond and Alec's cohort, Xenia Onatopp ready for Bond and Alec's reunion. I couldn't resist a nod to Ivan and Alec, two well known villains with a lot of depth and ties to Russia encountering each other during these moments of great change in their lives. 11. The \"regretful and wistful smile\" Alec gives to Viktor is in reference to a fanfic that has long been on the back burner about Bond's nephew (we learn actual son) James Bond Jr, hero of his animated series of the same name becoming friends then enemies with Alec's son, Nico Havelock-Trevelyan. Like The Unmistakable Fire, the fic called \"Sons of Our Fathers\" deals with parent and child relationships because we learn not only that Jr. is Bond's son by former Bond Girl Anya Amasova (The Spy Who Loved Me) and he was raised by Bond's cousin and his wife as their son but we learn that Nico is Alec's son by Melina Havelock, the Bond Girl from For Your Eyes Only and that until her death Melina raised Nico alone when Alec left her to begin his revenge campaign against England. (In Goldeneye, it is revealed he blamed his adopted country for the deaths of his parents who were Lienz Cossacks during WWII). So in this fic when he looks at Viktor, Alec remembers regretfully the son he left and missed. 12. Don't worry I don't think Apollo is really that much of an a-hole. There is a reason that he's out of character that you'll find out in the next chapter.[Chapter 6] The Unmistakable Fire By Auburn Red A Rocky IV/Creed 2 Fanfic VI. Adonis, Rocky, and Viktor Ivan Drago sat over his comatose son in the hospital. That fight that horrible fight was over. He stood over his son's bedside and ordered him like his fights. \"Viktor, voznikat!\" Arise! \"Prosypaysya!\" Wake up! \"I order you to wake up!\" After awhile of his son not responding Ivan gave up in frustration. He felt embarrassed that at the fight he wasn't thinking like a trainer judging Viktor's movements, giving him an advantage. Oh he started out well giving his son solid advice like \"Up and down! Up and down! Finish him!\" Why couldn't he recognize his son's weakness that Viktor had no endurance that since his fights ended quickly he couldn't withstand a long battle? A good trainer would have recognized that especially since it was his own weakness when he was a boxer. He would have used that and turned it around to improve on it making sure that Viktor didn't make the same mistake that he did. The truth was Ivan was a terrible trainer to not foresee that and let his boxer become so defeated. He didn't intend to be. Ever since Viktor was 7 years old, Ivan trained him endlessly. They exercised, sparred, and trained every day. Ivan pushed and pushed his son to the point that it was a wonder that Viktor didn't break from that. He never did. Viktor never questioned, never argued. Occasionally he gave his father annoyed or disagreeable looks but he always accepted whatever Ivan told him. Sometimes Ivan pulled that thread just a little further just to see how the boy would react telling him to run extra laps when he was exhausted, or strike his opponent after he walloped Viktor. He wanted to see if Viktor would fight his father instead. He never did. There was no laughter. No childish conversations. No loving bond between a father and son like they used to have. They were just a trainer and his boxer who happened to share a last name and live together. Ivan wanted and needed his son to survive the hardship in Kiev so there was never any time for sentiment. Ivan channeled his hatred of others onto his son. He got a vicarious thrill as his son pounded the punching bag calling his father's enemies' names now his enemies' names. Ivan knew his son's hatred could make a warrior out of him and it did. He watched with pride as Viktor knocked out his rivals and showed himself to be as unbroken as his father. All those years, Ivan watched with patience for the day when it would be Viktor's turn to step into the ring. Ivan only considered stepping back in himself once in 2006. He watched the 24 News getting irritated that his son was late. Ivan's fork scraped along the plate of fish as he poured himself a glass of vodka. He had long ago lost his job as a stevedore and now worked nights at an arsenal factory. Ivan was already dressed in his uniform. Viktor needed to be home so they could get in some training before Ivan left for his shift. Ivan barely paid attention to the news about the Ukrainian Parliamentary Crisis and Gas Crisis until the anchor mentioned the sports news. The anchor opened with the death of the former Director of the Russian Federation Athletics Department, Nikolai Koloff. Ivan froze at the name. Ivan reached over to turn up the volume as it mentioned that Koloff's career in the Department ended with his dismissal because of accusations of bribery and corruption. He was set to stand trial but instead died of a heart attack. Ivan smirked thinking of the man who once bragged about Ivan and then destroyed him. Ivan felt nothing no relief, no remorse nothing. The former boxer raised his glass as if in a toast. \"Dasvidaniya, Nikolai, \" he said flatly as he drank. Another name made Ivan sit up and pay attention. The anchor's voice took a lighter tone as it mentioned that the American boxer, Rocky Balboa came out of retirement. Stunned, Ivan watched footage of Rocky older and gray boxing against a younger man known as Mason \"The Line\" Dixon. ( What kind of nickname was \"The Line?\" Ivan wondered. What did that even mean? ) Ivan watched the television incredulously as Rocky fought his opponent. The anchor said that the fight ended in a split decision in Dixon's favor. Rocky shouldn't be fighting at all. Ivan thought he heard that Balboa had brain damage after their fight. Was that information wrong, just a rumor, the diagnosis inaccurate, or did Rocky just want to go out in a blaze of glory? Like Creed. The clip showed Rocky receiving praise from his audience. Ivan shook his head. Just like in Russia he thought enviously. Is there anyone besides me who does not cheer for him? Rocky was next to a young dark haired man that looked enough like him that Ivan wondered if he was the son that Rocky wished Merry Christmas to all of those years ago. He was also with two older men that Ivan remembered were his trainer, Duke and brother-in-law Paulie. A young teenage boy and a small dark haired woman also stood with him. Ivan didn't know who they were but he thought the woman was rather attractive in an American way. Ivan wondered where Rocky's wife, Adrian was. He didn't see her and Rocky didn't mention her the way he always did after his fights. The little that Ivan had seen of them they appeared happy together and she appeared to be a loyal and supportive wife (unlike other wives he refused to name). Had their marriage changed and were they no longer together? Was she watching the match from their home or was there a reason that she wasn't? Ivan considered whether he should also reenter the boxing world. After all Ivan was a lot younger than Rocky. Perhaps he could come out of retirement himself. Maybe he could box for the Ukrainian team and eventually face his old foe once more. A glance in the mirror ended that train of thought right away. If Ivan wasn't permitted to box at 30 then he sure as hell wasn't going to be allowed at 45. True he was built so was Rocky but Rocky still had the physique and stamina of a boxer. He still looked like he could step in the ring with no problems. Ivan just looked like a grizzled old homeless man asking for spare change outside the arena where the fight was held. Ivan supposed that he could argue with that. He could train, practice, and build up. He could do something about his decayed teeth and make himself look younger. He could prove to the world and Lud- uh Russia that Ivan Drago was still a champion. He could do all of that but if he were really honest with himself Ivan didn't want to. He was too old and too tired. The boxing world was finished with him and he was finished with them. The only thing returning to the ring would do is turn Ivan into a laughing stock. He didn't want that for Viktor or himself. He already was one enough as it was. Ivan's time was over. It was Viktor's turn now. The door opened as Viktor stepped into the apartment. Ivan could smell the disinfectant that Viktor used in his custodial job on his hands and clothes. He dropped his backpack and greeted his father while he listened through his headphones. The headphones were something that Viktor had been doing more often lately. Ivan wondered if that was Viktor's sole act of rebellion towards his father to block out his constant stream of commands. \"You're late,\" Ivan accused. Viktor at first didn't listen until his father yanked the headphones off his head. The music was loud enough that Ivan could even hear the lyrics: \"I've become so numb/I can't feel you there/I've become so tired/So much more aware/By becoming this/All I want to do/Is be more like me/And less like you/I've become so numb/I can't feel you there/Tired of being what you want me to be!\" \"You're late,\" Ivan repeated. Viktor blushed embarrassed. He wasn't even 20 years old and was one inch shorter than his father. He didn't quite have the muscles yet but Ivan could tell that they were coming. \"I'm sorry Father,\" he said. \"There was this girl that I was talking to after work. She was very pretty and I wanted to ask her out!\" \"No excuses,\" Ivan commanded. He filled Viktor's plate with food and slid it over. Viktor and Ivan ate in silence. Ivan observed his son. Was this a good time to begin his son's professional career? He was young and some began even younger. Ivan considered then dismissed the idea. Viktor was impressive, but still unskilled and raw. He would be no match for Balboa or anyone else for that matter. He still needed better training. \"You will run after we eat,\" Ivan ordered. \"But I already ran this morning,\" Viktor reminded his father. \"You were off by three seconds,\" Ivan commanded. \"You need to improve.\" \"Yes father,\" Viktor said. \"Will you use the truck?\" \"Of course\", Ivan said. After a long time, Ivan and Viktor with their combined earnings managed to scrape enough together to purchase a truck. It was old, rusty, and threatened to break apart but it worked. It proved to be helpful when the two were evicted and slept in the truck homeless until they could afford to live in another apartment. There was also a blanket in the truck which Viktor used to warm himself during those times. There was no extra blanket for Ivan. The truck was also helpful for Viktor's training because Ivan would chase after Viktor when he ran. If Viktor outran the truck, it was a good day. \"Yes Father,\" Viktor said. \"As it should be, \" Ivan answered. The two ate again until it was time for more training. Ivan returned to the present and held his son's hand feeling shame at those thoughts and memories and anguish over what happened to Viktor. When he spoke to his son again this time his voice wasn't commanding and fierce. Instead it was pleading begging. \"Viktor prosypaysya,\" he said. \"Please come back to me. Don't leave me...Vitya.\" In the end in that final round when his son was beaten within an inch of his life and refused to back down, Ivan wasn't a trainer. He was a father who couldn't bear to watch his child getting beaten to death. Sasha's long ago words echoed in his mind: \"You are a father first and a boxer second.\" He couldn't watch his own son die. What else could he do but throw in the towel and surrender? And what else could he do when his son pushed him away worried that his father would hate him but hug him and tell him that it was okay and that he was so proud of him? Why did Viktor doubt that his father loved him? Did he really think that Ivan would walk away from him and leave him alone the way Russia and Ludmilla did to him? Then Ivan realized of course Viktor doubted. Why wouldn't he? When did Ivan ever show him any affection or praise? Until he threw in the towel and hugged his son, Ivan never told or showed Viktor that he loved him. The worst part was that Ivan was afraid those selfless actions came too late. As Ivan led his son out of the locker room, Viktor held onto his head in pain. He managed to say, \"Father help me, please!\" Before he collapsed to the ground. Ivan fell to his son's side and screamed for someone, anyone to get an ambulance. For the first time in over 30 years, his mother's miscarriage echoed through Ivan's brain. He felt just as helpless as he did when he was 7 years old and watched his mother almost bleed to death from the trauma that would eventually kill her. The doctors told him that the repeated blows ruptured his son's brain and that he was now in a coma. They worked on him to bring down the swelling in his skull but now the only cure would be time. If there was a cure. This shouldn't happen, Ivan thought, I threw that goddamned towel. I wanted to prevent this very thing from happening. So you can give it to someone else but you can't take it when it happens to someone you care about, Apollo Creed's voice mocked him. Where was that towel throwing then? In the over twenty years since he first heard it, Apollo's voice came and went in Ivan's mind sometimes receded into the background like white noise. It was like the nightmares, sometimes they faded sometimes they were less severe but they were always there. In times of great emotional stress they came in full force like now. Ivan covered his ears, \"Tishina!\" He said aloud. He breathed a sigh of relief that he couldn't hear it for now. The last thing he needed was to be mentally tormented as his son was going through physical torment. Viktor needed his father not a delirious mad man who heard a dead man's voice in his head. Ivan glanced over at the room across from them. Adonis Creed was awake and injured as well but he was with Rocky, his wife, Bianca and mother, Mary Anne. They were talking, joking, and laughing. Adonis held up his cell phone clearly in a conversation. From the gestures and high voice that he gave, Ivan assumed Adonis was talking to his infant daughter, Amara on the phone. They were all together but Ivan and Viktor were alone. Ivan envied them. Ivan picked up his phone and debated whether to call Ludmilla telling her about her son's condition. Ivan shook his head angrily. Ludmilla's actions or inactions as it were at the match spoke volumes. She walked away as though Viktor were a stranger just like Viktor said she was to him. Her expression as she left said it all He's your son not mine. He is just like you. He will never be good at anything, a complete failure. Ivan put the phone down. Ludmilla didn't give a damn about her ex-husband or her son. She never had. She was a selfish philandering gold digging bitch who only cared about wealth, power, and success. She didn't mind coming to the mansion dinner and reaping the benefits of her son's victories just like she didn't mind bragging to the press about her successful up and coming husband as his spokesperson. But she refused to stick around when it came time to do the heavy lifting of parenthood or standing by her husband or son when others turned against them. She was a fair weather cold hearted woman who abandoned those when things got rough. Ivan was sorry that it took so long for him to realize it. Why didn't Ivan listen when Viktor tried to warn him that Ludmilla and the others didn't care about them and abandoned them? \"They are here for you,\" Ivan said. No, in the end Ivan wanted them to be there for him not Viktor. He paraded his son around like a display or a bauble to be admired hoping to get that secondhand glory for himself. The glory that eluded him for so long. He hated when the Soviets treated him like a machine a mindless automaton and not a man. How was he any better than them? They did that to someone they didn't know. Ivan did that to his own son! Everything that he pushed Viktor to do was a waste. It was a waste to push himself and then his own son to please people who would never be satisfied would never forgive loss or weakness. It was a waste to expect their lives would ever be any different. It was all a waste just like Ivan himself. Ivan sighed and repeated the names on his Enemies List counting them off with his fingers. When he spoke, his voice was out of steam. \"Alexei Drago.\" Sergei Vobet.\" \"Igor Sergei Rimsky.\" \"Nikolai Koloff.\" \"Valentin Popov.\" \"Ludmilla Vobet-Koloff.\" \"Apollo Creed.\" \"Rocky Balboa.\" \"Bela Smirnov.\" \"Vitaliy Grinkov.\" \"Yevgeny Koloff.\" \"Adonis Creed.\" \"Mat Rossiya.\" He counted one finger in silence then said the name that was at the top of his list the one he hated most of all: \"Ivan Alexeyevich Drago.\" This was the result of all that selfish pride all of that pressure. His son lying there in a coma close to death. Ivan expected his son to be a better man than he was and now he will be a dead man and Ivan would be left alone with only his regrets. Well should Ivan expect any less? This was what he deserved wasn't it? He killed someone. No Apollo didn't die in the ring. It wasn't an accident. Ivan Drago killed Apollo Creed and now he was paying for it in the worst way possible. He remembered telling Rocky \"Because of you I lose everything\" but as much as he blamed Rocky the ugly truth was everything that happened was his own fault. He didn't lose everything in Moscow when he was defeated. He lost everything in Las Vegas when he beat a man to death in the ring. This was his punishment, his own prison, for taking that life long ago. His son, his only reason for being, would die. I deserve this, Ivan thought sadly. You're damn right, Apollo's voice taunted. But what kind of father are you to let his child suffer like this then die? Ivan realized what the voice was telling him. No it wasn't a fair trade: Viktor's life for Apollo's. Viktor deserved to live a full and happy life. He didn't deserve to die so violently because of his father's actions. He didn't deserve to suffer. Ivan knew who did. There was only one really acceptable trade in all of this. The bullet that Ivan fired that night took 33 years but would finally reach the right target. Ivan leaned over to kiss his son on the forehead. \"Pozhaluysta prosti menya, Vitya,\" he whispered. Please forgive me. He rummaged through his and his son's wallets to pull out 10,000 rubles. He needed money for what he was going to do. He briefly walked over to Adonis's room and stood outside where Adonis and the others were still talking. Ivan put his hands on the window and let sorrow envelope him. This must have been how they felt when Apollo died. Now he understood. Rocky looked up from talking to Adonis and saw Ivan through the window. His expression should be one of triumph. After all his boy broke Ivan's son. Instead it was one of sympathy and pity. The same look he gave Ivan when they first saw each other in Adrian's. No don't do this, Ivan mentally warned. He stepped back from the window and approached the front desk. He asked the receptionist if she had paper and a pen. When she gave the supplies to him, Ivan returned to his son's room and prepared to write four letters: or rather one letter four times. He folded the papers and wrote the names in English on the back: Adonis Creed, Mary Anne Creed, Rocky Balboa, Viktor. He then turned the papers around and wrote the letters in Russian opening the grief and guilt that he had been carrying for 33 years. Ivan finished off his final letters the ones to Adonis and Viktor. He realized those boys were so similar. Both were raised by only one parent and both suffered by Ivan's hand. Viktor had a terrible father and Adonis had no father at all. He put his signature on the letter as he heard a familiar voice moan, \"Otets?\" Father? Ivan stunned saw Viktor open his eyes and look confused at his father. \"Viktor,\" Ivan said. He moved to his son's side. Viktor tried to sit up but Ivan held him firmly down. \"Don't try to get up,\" Ivan said. \"How are you feeling?\" Viktor held his throbbing forehead. \"Like a large train hit me over the head several times.\" Viktor lowered his head. \"I am sorry I disappointed you, Father. You must be angry.\" \"Of course you didn't Viktor,\" Ivan said. \"Don't you remember after the match or how it ended?\" Viktor's face was a blank. \"I remember her leaving the stand. I remember Creed hitting me. I remember he kept hitting me again and again. He knocked me out didn't he?\" Ivan winced. Of course Viktor didn't remember. One loving act did not erase the over 20 years of abuse Ivan inflicted on his son. \"Something like that. I will go fetch a nurse.\" He rose and left the room. He reported that his son woke up from his coma. A doctor examined the young man and said that Viktor still had a severe concussion and would still need to be hospitalized for the time being. \"Still it is good that he is awake,\" Dr. Rumanov said. \"Yes it is,\" Ivan said. He should be happy that his son was awake but he wasn't. Viktor would be fine but he would still be forced to live with that horrible man he called Father. Viktor and Ivan talked for a bit as Viktor yawned. \"I just woke up and I am already tired again.\" \"Rumanov said that would be natural,\" Ivan said. \"You just lie back and sleep. Viktor, there is something that I need to do. Now that you are awake, I have to go somewhere else.\" \"Where are you going?\" Viktor asked. \"It is a private matter,\" Ivan said. \"You aren't going to see her again are you?\" Viktor asked. Ivan knew which her he was talking about. \"Nyet, you were right all along,\" Ivan said. \"I'm sorry for not listening.\" \"I'm sorry that I had to be,\" Viktor said. \"You will be back soon?\" Ivan didn't answer. \"Just get some rest.\" He lowered his son down and said, \"Dasvidaniya, Vitya.\" Viktor gave a small smile. \"You haven't called me that since I was 7 years old. I like hearing it again.\" His words were slurred as he relaxed comfortably and closed his eyes. Ivan didn't answer. Instead he sadly left the room. It was early afternoon when Ivan left the hospital. He lost track of the days. Was it two or three since the fight? They ran together. He had to purchase something first. He knew where he might get it. The tavern was practically empty as Ivan entered. It was afternoon so there were only a few people sitting at tables drinking. Ivan walked up to the bar and ordered a vodka. Drowning your sorrows Drago? Creed taunted. Finished writing to the kids and Balboa? \"Will you leave me alone?\" Ivan said aloud. Why you even bother? You know they are better than you are! Viktor would be better off being Balboa's kid. His kid loves him! He has a father who is worth admiring! \"Ukhodi,\" Ivan demanded.. \"I can't go away,\" the bartender said responding to Ivan's command. \"I am giving you your vodka.\" As the bartender set the drink down, Ivan asked. \"Pamoloinavije but if I were to purchase a firearm through less reputable sources and no regulations, where could I find one?\" \"You are the authorities?\" The bartender asked. Ivan shook his head. \"Then you're in luck.\" He pointed to the thin wiry dark haired man in the back. \"Dimitri will help you with that.\" Ivan thanked the man, paid for the drink, and approached the arms dealer. Ivan followed Dimitri to his car where he opened the trunk. Ivan looked through the various weapons, assault rifles, Uzis, handguns. \"What are you looking for?\" Dimitri asked. \"A handgun will be fine,\" Ivan said. Dimitri nodded. \"I have just the thing.\" Dimitri picked up a handgun. \"CZ 97B from the Czech Republic, .45 ACP.\" Ivan picked it up, cocked it, and inspected it. \"That will do. How much?\" \"20,000,\" he said. Ivan didn't have 20,000. \"5,000.\" \"15,000.\" \"6,000.\" \"12,000.\" \"8,000.\" \"11,000.\" \"10,000.\" Ivan said. Dimitri considered. \"Done.\" They shook hands as Dimitri gave Ivan the gun, bullets, and the holster. Ivan accepted it with thanks. This time when he heard Apollo's voice it was chilling, See you soon, Ivan. Ivan returned to the hospital with the letters in his hand as he saw an elegant American black woman climb the stairs and nearly enter the hospital. \"Mrs. Creed,\" Ivan called. \"Mr. Drago,\" Mary Anne Creed said confused. \"How is your son?\" Ivan asked. Mary Ann smiled. \"He's getting better. We might be able to check him out soon.\" \"Good,\" Ivan said. \"How is yours?\" Mary Ann asked. \"He has woken up from coma but still has concussion,\" Ivan answered. \"I'm glad he woke up,\" Mary Ann said. \"So am I,\" Ivan said. There was an awkward silence. Mary Ann spoke haltingly. \"Mr. Drago, I never got to thank you for what you did. If you hadn't thrown in the towel, I don't think either one of our babies would be alive.\" \"Viktor hasn't been baby in sometime,\" Ivan said dryly. Mary Ann held up a teasing finger. \"Uh uh, if you're anything like me no matter how big or old they get, they always going to be our babies.\" Ivan smiled thinly. \"Should have done it sooner.\" 33 years sooner. \"But it was done,\" Mary Ann reminded him. He held up the letters. \"You go inside you give these?\" Mary Ann took the letters and read her name on one. \"What are these?\" \"Things that must be said,\" Ivan said sadly. \"You give them to Balboa, your son...and mine.\" Mary Ann was confused. \"You're not going in there yourself?\" \"I cannot\" Ivan said. \"Well don't you think you ought to?,\" Mary Ann asked. \"Viktor's awake sure but he needs his father.\" \"I cannot,\" Ivan said. \"Something I must do.\" Mary Ann nodded clearly not understanding. \"I should probably tell Viktor something at least.\" \"Prizraki Mertvykh,\" Ivan said absently as he walked away. Mary Ann called \"Mr. Drago!\" But he paid no attention as he disappeared into the crowd. Mary Ann opened the hospital door hoping to see Ivan in the street but she didn't. Something told her that whatever Ivan was planning wasn't good. Rocky Balboa walked down the corridor expecting to see his friend, Adonis Creed lying in his bed in his room. Instead he saw him standing outside Viktor Drago's room. \"Hey kid,\" Rocky said. Adonis turned to his mentor. \"Hey Unk.\" For the umpteenth time Rocky mentally crossed himself and thanked any and all saints who were listening that this Creed vs. Drago fight didn't go the way of the original. He should have thrown the towel down this time. What was he waiting for? Another Creed to die at his hand? The hell with Apollo and Adonis's stubborn streaks. Rocky couldn't bear to be haunted by the image of Adonis's unconscious bleeding body in his arms just like his dad's. They were all lucky that didn't happen. Intensely lucky. When the time came Rocky hated himself for not stepping up but was glad someone did. He was just as surprised who it was. Ivan Drago. The man who killed Apollo. Rocky nodded at Viktor who was sitting up in his room talking to Bianca. \"Makin' friends with the enemy?\" Rocky teased. \"We've been talking,\" Adonis said. \"He's not really that bad a guy. You know we got to talking before the match and he said he didn't hold anything against me personally.\" \"Same thing wit' me and your dad,\" Rocky quipped. \" ''Sides someone's got to,\" Adonis said bitterly. \"His dad ain't been around?\" Rocky asked. \"He's been the invisible man since Viktor woke up,\" Adonis said. \"What kind of father does that to their kid ups and leaves them in the hospital?\" Rocky shrugged. \"I dunno, it's hard to say. Maybe he has I dunno like his reasons..\" \"Like what?\" Adonis snapped. \"You know Viktor told me that his Dad trained him since he was 7! 7 years old! For fuck's sake, I was barely reading chapter books at that age!\" Rocky remembered how at Adrian's, Ivan compared his life to a stray dog that had no home and went for days without food. \"Maybe he was tryin' to take care of his boy and make sure he survived you know the only way he knew how.\" Adonis shook his head. \"Why are you defending him?\" \"I'm not,\" Rocky said. \"I'm just tryin' to understand him.\" \"Far as I'm concerned, he ain't worth understanding,\" Adonis said bitterly. Adonis thought for a little bit. \"You know in California, there's this guy, Danny, a buddy of mine that I work out with sometimes. He's a nice guy, owns a car dealership, teaches karate, kind of a big mouth but he's okay. Well when he was in school, this other guy used to bully him. Apparently, the bully, Johnny, also studied karate and his teacher was apparently a real lunatic always pushing his students, abusing them, telling them stuff like fear and defeat do not exist in their karate gym-\" \"-dojos they're called -dojos,\" Rocky said. Adonis looked confused. \"Hey I know other fightin' sports besides boxin'.\" Adonis continued: \"Well anyway Danny's teacher was a good one all about teaching about meditation, defense, and stuff. Long story short when the big tournament came Danny whipped Johnny's ass but good. Flash forward 34 years later and Johnny revived the same dojo he studied in and was bullied in teaching a whole new generation of kids to pick on other kids. Well Danny started his own dojo to teach karate the way he learned it as a defense and self-discipline. So these two are still going at it. The thing is I met Johnny and he's okay I mean kind of messed up but alright. They are actually more alike than they are different not to mention Johnny's aggressive style with Danny's self-discipline would make their students unstoppable, but they don't see it that way. What I'm getting at is these two dudes have been locked away in this fight for over 30 years and they can't get past it, can't get past when they were 16.\" Rocky nodded. \"So youse saying we need to let go of our old anger at the Dragos and move on.\" Rocky guessed. Adonis looked squarely at his friend. \"Ah hell nah, I'm saying their fights are stupid. Neither one of them killed anybody!\" Adonis looked fierce but nodded at Viktor. His voice softened. \"But neither did Viktor. He wasn't even born yet when that happened. He had nothing to do with any of it. I like Viktor but Ivan. Damn, that man's cold.\" Rocky sighed. \"You know sometimes when you're fightin' youse sometimes forget there's a guy at the other end. In my mind, Ivan Drago was this ten feet tall, unstoppable killing machine like a robot like the one I used to have or somethin' not a man. But when I saw him that day at Adrian's and then when he tossed that towel down I dunno I didn't see a monster, a machine, or your dad's killer. I just saw you know just the guy at the other end.\" Adonis nodded at the door. \"I'm gonna go in. You want to join me?\" \"Sure,\" Rocky said. Viktor and Bianca laughed as she showed him a Facebook photo of Amara. \"Ah milyy,\" Viktor said smiling. \"What does that mean?\" Bianca asked. \"It is something we say to baby,\" Viktor said. \"It means cute, adorable.\" He looked closer. \"She looks like both of you.\" Bianca grinned. She then showed another pic this time Adonis holding Amara's arms up to strike a hero pose. \"She's already a fighter,\" Bianca said proudly. \"You sing I Go To War to her?\" Viktor joked. Bianca sighed. \" I would but she wouldn't hear it. She was born deaf.\" \"I am sorry\", Viktor said. Bianca held up her hand. \"It's alright. We have something in common.\" She pointed to her ears to show her hearing aids. ,\"Everyone lives with hurt. It's how they deal with it that is the real test. It's taken awhile but we're adjusting.\" \"That is good,\" Viktor said \"So you got a honey?\" Bianca asked as Viktor returned her phone. \"Honey?\" Viktor asked. \"Sorry I meant girlfriend or wife,\" she said. \"Oh no, no honey,\" Viktor said. \"I have no time for socializing. I am always working, training, fighting, and sleeping.\" \"Sounds intense,\" Bianca said. \"I am used to it,\" Viktor said. \"How long has he been training you?\" Bianca asked. \"Since I was 7,\" Viktor replied. Bianca was stunned. \"And he pushes you like that?\" Viktor nodded. She said. \"No offense, but if he were my Dad, I would have told him to fuck off.\" \"Thoughts cross my mind many times,\" Viktor said dryly. \"So why did you put up with it for so long?\" Bianca asked. Viktor shrugged. \"My father.\" He noticed Rocky and Adonis enter. \"Everyone says they know Father. They see what they want to see. America sees him as cold killer. Russia sees him as failure. Ukraine sees him just as one of many so many poor people. I don't see none of that.\" \"I see man who suffered, whose wife left him, and had no friends or relations so he did all himself. I see man who worked his fingers to their bones 18 sometimes 20 hours a day to care for me. I see man who would come home off work in morning exhausted but still want to train. I see man who wears clothes too big because he sometimes goes without food for days but makes sure I eat plenty. I see man who when we slept on streets or in truck, he gave me blanket while he shivered all night from cold. Never tells me any of that but I know he does. I became boxer not just to restore name, or get out of poverty, or make him proud though all of this true. I became boxer because I want him to know all he does is worthwhile. Someday I care for him as good as he cares for me. Everyone sees Ivan Drago. I just see Father.\" Bianca offered a small smile and tapped on her cell phone. \"I'm sorry I shouldn't have judged you and your dad.\" \"You are not first,\" Viktor said without malice. Rocky and Adonis stood by the wall. \"Guy at the other end?\" Adonis asked. Rocky nodded. Adonis grinned in a teasing manner as he approached them.\"Hey there making moves on my wife?\" He jokingly did the \"eye on you\" gesture. \"She all yours, Adonis,\" Viktor said holding up his hand in surrender. Bianca and Adonis kissed. Mary Ann entered flushed and worried. \"Oh good you're all in here,\" she said. \"Hey yo Mary Ann what's wrong?\" Rocky asked. Mary Ann nodded to Viktor. \"I saw your father outside the hospital.\" \"He did not come in?\" Viktor asked. \"No he said he had something to do and gave me these.\" She passed the letters around. Rocky, Viktor, and Adonis looked at their letters. \"They're in Russian,\" Adonis said. \"They would be,\" Viktor said. \"My father does not write English so good. It was that Soviet School System that said Capitalist America was evil so language was evil. I write English far better than he but speaking is easier for he than me.\" Mary Ann, Rocky, and Adonis handed the letters over to him. Viktor examined the letters. \"They are all same.\" \"What do they say?\" Bianca asked. Viktor read out loud: \"'Dear Rocky, Mary Ann, Adonis, and Viktor, It is meaningless to apologize. No apologies can fix what broke. But I am truly sorry for murdering Apollo Creed. There is Nobody to blame for my troubles -Nobody but myself. I cannot give reasons that make up for loss. Young. Inexperienced. Addicted to steroids. Product of Soviet Union. None justified his death. Because of me, Mary Ann lost husband, Rocky friend, and Adonis father. I am sorry Mary Ann is widow. You missed chance to grow old together. You should have that. You loved each other like Balboas. I envy you. I am sorry Adonis has no father. That he can not see what fine upstanding young man you become. He should be here to cheer for you in corner. He is not and I am to blame. I am sorry Rocky lost friend and our fight gave brain damage that ended career. I do not know Rocky's life now but at our age is likely that you probably lost much. I am sorry you no longer have friend that should be here with you. I did break you, but I broke me too. Above all I am sorry to Viktor'-\"Viktor's voice caught. \"You don't gotta read no more,\" Rocky said \"I want to,\" Viktor said simply. \"'Above all I am sorry to Viktor. I am sorry I train you to be good boxer not good man. I am sorry I show you to people who never care for us. I am sorry I robbed you of childhood. I am sorry I am not hero Colossus like you want me to be. My only hope is that you are better boxer, better father one day, and better man than I will ever be. So many things I wish were different. But know I can't return there and change them. Only thing I do is balance them by ending this. Do not worry. When I die, I die. Dasvidaniya. Sincerely yours, Ivan Drago.'\" Everyone stood or sat in silence. Finally Adonis spoke up. \"We gotta stop him.\" \"Donnie this ain't our country,\" Rocky reminded him. \"Look Unk he's clearly suicidal,\" Creed said. \"I hate Ivan Drago but Viktor's worried about him. I don't want my revenge like this! Nothing's worth that! We gotta find him!\" \"Naw, Donnie I meant I'm with you,\" Rocky said. \"But since this ain't our country we don't know where he is.\" Viktor stood up. \"I go with you. I help save Father.\" Adonis asked. \"Are you sure? You're worse off than me.\" \" My father,\" Viktor insisted. \"If he isn't-hadn't yet-who he listen to Rocky Balboa, Adonis Creed, or his son?\" Viktor were both fully dressed by the time Viktor tried to call his father's phone. He received nothing but a dial tone. He swore. \"Do you have any idea where he might be,\" Adonis asked. \"No I do not know,\" Viktor said. \"Don't know Russia very well.\" \"How can you not know Russia? Aren't you from here?\" Adonis asked. \"Yes, I was born here. But Father and I traveled through Soviet Union when I was baby. We were ordered to leave Russia before I was three. We only come back once after U.S.S.R. collapsed. My father believed Russian Federation welcome him back but they never would! We found only friends were dead, my mother not want to see us, and boxing finished with him. That was also first time I heard about your father.\" He nodded to Adonis. \"After father's hearing, an awful man, Father's former manager-\" \"-Comrade Big Mouth,\" Rocky quipped realizing to whom Viktor was referring. \"His name was Nikolai Koloff but that is good correct description,\" Viktor mused. \"He insult Father. I defend him. Koloff told me about Apollo just to break Father. Koloff destroyed him. My mother stole his money and left him for other man and destroyed him. Russia destroyed him and he never sees that.\" \"All kinds of excuses they say why they no longer want him to fight: the steroids, your father's death, fought in unsanctioned fights, wasn't fully Russian but half-Russian and half-Ukrainian, eventually telling him too old but none were real reason. Any one of those they could forgive! No real reason was he lost and they throw him away! They never cared about him! I never understood why he is so desperate to get approval when they shame him! Why he think he is no good for them when was they who were no good for him! No, I do not know where in this fucking country he is!\" He kicked a trash can in rage. Rocky patted the younger man on the shoulder. \"Sometimes it's really hard to live wit' defeat. Sounds like your dad took it all out on himself.\" Viktor nodded. Rocky turned to Mary Ann. \"Did he say anythin' to you?\" Mary Ann shrugged. \"Not much. I thanked him and asked if he wanted to come in. He refused then gave me the letters. He the words \"mertvykh\" and \"prizraki.\" \"What do they mean?\" Adonis asked Viktor. \"Mertvykh means dead and prizraki means ghosts,\" Viktor explained. \"Could he be at a cemetery?\" Bianca said. \"Is there a Drago family plot somewhere where parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles other relatives are buried?\" Adonis suggested. \"No nothing like that,\" Viktor said. \"Father had no family. Grandmother died when Father was 7 and Grandfather died when he was 9. Both were burned. He didn't like my grandfather so would not visit if plot existed.\" \"Is there like I don't know a haunted place or somethin'\" Rocky asked. \"This Russia, Rocky,\" Viktor smirked. \"Every place haunted.\" \"I mean did youse go to some joint that had ghosts?\" Rocky asked. \"Nothing like that. Father and I not believe in those things. Only one place I ever think was haunted.\" Suddenly Viktor turned ashen as something dawned on him. \"I know where he is!\" Rocky waved everyone forward. \"Alright let's get goin'!\" \"Shouldn't someone be here in case he comes back,\" Bianca asked. \"Maybe call around to see where he is if Viktor's guess isn't right?\" Mary Ann took her hand. \"We'll do it.\" \"Uh, we don't speak Russian, \" Bianca reminded her mother-in-law. \"That could be a problem.\" \"I have idea,\" Viktor said. Viktor waved them forward to follow him to the waiting room. \"Anyone speak English?\". He asked the staff. A brunette woman's hand went up. \"I do,\" she said leaving the nursing station \"I studied medicine in New York.\" She moved towards the family. \"You there what's your name?\" Viktor asked. \"Raissa,\" she answered. Viktor motioned to Bianca and Mary Ann. \"Raissa these are friends and we need assistance.\" Mary Ann \"Yes we are concerned about a ….friend of ours who might be in trouble and we need you to help make some calls for us.\" \"I'll do what I can. It is best we go inside my office,\" Raissa said. \"Tell me who you think we should call.\" \"Shouldn't we call the police or a mental health provider?\" Bianca suggested. \"No,\" Viktor almost shouted. His voice became softer. \"No police. No mental hospitals. As your friend, Bianca, I beg you. I don't have time to explain but Raissa could.\" Raissa nodded. They wished each other luck. \"I try to reach Father,\" Viktor said to Bianca. \"If I don't you try to call him.\" Bianca nodded as he gave her Ivan's cell number before he left. \"Any message you want me to give him?\" Rocky asked Mary Ann. Mary Ann nodded. \"Tell him, I forgive him like I forgive you.\" Rocky smiled as he followed the younger guys to the door. Raissa held up her phone. \"So who do we contact first?\" Viktor and Adonis strode down the hallway and approached the door when Dr. Rumanov nervously ran in front to block the boxer's paths. \"Where do you think you're going?\" \"We're checking out,\" Adonis said. \"Your release must be approved by attending physician,\" Rumanov declared. \"So approve of it,\" Viktor said. 'I cannot without full investigation, that could take few days.\" \"We don't wait that long! We are leaving now,\" Viktor said \"Go back to your rooms,\" the doctor demanded. \"Damn,\" Adonis said. He moved like he was going to walk away. \"He got us but good.\" He turned back to the doctor. \"Doc, I have a medical question for you. What's black and white and can kick the shit out of you?\" The doctor shook his head as both Adonis and Viktor grabbed him by the lapels. \"Us,\" Adonis commanded. \" Now, sign us out.\" They gave their most intimidating stares to the doctor. Rumanov let the two men sign with a flourish. \"Alright but don't be crying to me when spleens rupture.\" \"We won't,\" Adonis and Viktor said. The two young boxers smiled and fist bumped. \"Hey that was fun. I felt like we were a team, you know like Captain America and the Winter Soldier or Iron Man and War Machine,\" Adonis said. \"Or Kay and Jay the MIB or Murtagh and Riggs from Lethal Weapon,\" Viktor agreed. Adonis nodded. \"Now let's go get your dad,\" Adonis said. Viktor nodded in agreement. Rocky rolled his eyes at the duo's developing friendship. \"I'm gettin' too old for this shit. So where to Viktor?\" \"Fallen Monuments Park,\" Viktor said. Raissa talked on the phone as Bianca sat across from her and Mary Ann faced the window. She called another nearby tavern. \"Spasibo,\" she thanked the bartender. \"Not there either. Anyone else?\" Bianca shook her head. She tried calling the number Viktor gave her but there was no answer. \"I don't know. Maybe we should call the police or an ambulance and arrange an intervention or something to have him committed.\" \"You wish for this to happen for your friend's father?\" Raissa asked. Bianca shook her head. \"No but if he's a danger to himself or to others shouldn't he be in a hospital?\" \"Your friend's father should be cared for true but not in places like that,\" Raissa said. When she lowered her voice, Bianca could tell that this was going to be a private conversation not to be shared by anyone out of this office. \"Your friend has good reason not to have his father put in state mental hospital. You are American, da? In your country mentally ill are cared for and medicated. They talk to psychiatrist and get help and support from loved ones, da?\" Bianca nodded. \"Da I mean yes.\" Raissa waved her hand around the room. \"It is not like that here. Many believe that mental illness is sign of weakness something that brings shame. Your friend's father would be taken to hospital that is little better than prison. Your friend would not be permitted to see him which leaves his father isolated from loved ones. He would be subjected to whatever treatments they give him such as shocks or experiments. Hospitals are understaffed and use unsanitized equipment. He would not be cared for, instead he is ignored by staff, and left in his own hunger and filth. Your friend will not be permitted to contact his father. Because of that they are under no obligation to tell him what they do. When he dies from treatment they won't tell. Instead they burn the body and tell him that his father ran away or committed suicide. These hospitals are not to treat people. They are places that they put people to forget about them, people that need help the most.\" Bianca put her hand on her mouth. \"My God.\" Raissa shrugged. \"It is getting better slightly. Authorities are studying state hospitals. A recent documentary got much needed attention. There are compassionate private care facilities but many are expensive. There are also outpatient counseling services here and in other former Soviet countries. They are helpful especially to former soldiers in Ukraine. You said your friend and his father live in Kiev. They may wish to try them upon return. But still state hospitals need work and this country has long way to go.\" \"I really don't understand much about this country,\" Bianca said. Raissa smiled. \"You are like everyone else. You never know a place until you step inside of it. I never understood what America was like until I moved there .\" Bianca nodded. She tried calling Ivan's number but there was no response. \"I will try calling somewhere else,\" Raissa offered. Bianca walked towards Mary Ann and hugged her. \"It's strange,\" Mary Ann said. \"It's three days after the fight that almost killed my son and instead of thinking about him, I am worried about the man who killed my husband.\" Bianca didn't say anything just gave her mother-in-law wordless support as Mary Ann continued. \"There was a time when every time I thought of Ivan Drago, I seethed with hatred. I wanted to kill him with my bare hands but not before I shook him and said 'You did this! My children have no father because of you! I have no husband because of you!' I wanted him to know what it felt like to lose someone he loved. I wanted to curse him with all of the pain and suffering that I went through. Now that it's happened, I don't want to anymore. At that fight I ached every time Adonis went down but also every time Viktor went down. I kept fighting inside myself saying that this is what I wanted, but I realized that it wasn't. Then Ivan wasn't a murderer a remorseless killer. He was like me: a parent worried about his baby. Now hearing that letter and what Raissa says, he doesn't deserve that. No one does.\" Bianca gave Mary Ann another wordless hug and helped her sit down. Ivan rested on a bench at Fallen Monuments Park as evening began. His phone vibrated again. He glanced at the number: Viktor's. If it wasn't Viktor's it was an American number. Either way Ivan didn't answer. Instead he turned off the phone. He faced the statue of Vladimir Lenin. He supposed that it was fitting that his life would end here. In a place where history was tucked away only to be remembered as a cautionary tale. Ivan opened a bottle of vodka hoping to deaden his nerves. He never understood why his father was so weak to drink away his disappointments. Now he knew. It wasn't weakness, it was exhaustion. The feeling that you had when the fire burnt out and you couldn't fight anymore. It just became easier to crawl inside a bottle rather than confront those demons. Perhaps his father wanted to die and drinking was his way of poisoning himself rather than live with regrets. Ivan took another drink with the gun in his hand. It felt so sleek and heavy. He lifted it, placed the bullets inside one by one and stared at the barrel. Why was he so afraid to do this? He had nothing and no one that cared except Viktor. Viktor. His son would be distraught but in the end he would be better off living without a father that pushed him and forced him to make up for his mistakes. Ivan shook his head. He should feel something despair or guilt for leaving his son another blame that could be laid at his feet. But instead he felt nothing. Nothing but numbness and cold like he was staring into a dark void and couldn't see the bottom. He wished that he could just be frozen solid trapped in this abyss and never come out . My wish will come true soon enough, Ivan thought. Rocky, Adonis, and Viktor stepped out of the cab in front of the Park. Adonis looked around at the monuments. \"You weren't kidding when you said this place is haunted. It is creepy.\" \"It is where they put all old Soviet statues,\" Viktor said as they walked through. \"I wondered what they did wit' all this stuff,\" Rocky said. He pointed at a statue of Dzerzhinsky. \"I think I remember him last time I was here.\" \"I hate this place,\" Viktor said. \"Always hated it. No good living in past, I think. Too many ghosts in our life as it is.\" Viktor looked around. \"Lot bigger than I remembered.\" \"Well let's get a move on and look,\" Rocky said. He cupped his hands to his mouth and called. \"DRAGO!\" The only answer was his own echo. Adonis and Viktor picked up the call. Adonis yelled. \"Yo Drago!\" Viktor yelled. \"Father! Otets!\" Still no response. Rocky moved the younger men forward. \"So what are youse two waitin' for? Lead on Magellan.\" Viktor nodded and led the two Americans through the park. Ivan thought he heard his name called. He turned around but did not answer back. Instead he swallowed another drink and reopened the holster. Must leave no trace, he thought to himself. He poured the remainder of vodka onto the ground. Then he tossed it into the air and fired the gun sending the bottle to shatter to the ground below. The shot made Rocky, Adonis, and Viktor jump in surprise. \"No,\" Viktor gasped. Adonis pointed ahead. \"It came from over there!\" The trio ran to the direction of the shot. Ivan sighed and pointed the gun to his right temple. It was now or never. He thought of his son. \"Dasvidaniya, Viktor. Ya lyublyu tebya.\" I love you. He cocked the gun. Adonis looked ahead. Near a statue of Vladimir Lenin, he could see a large figure sitting on a bench with his back turned. \"That's him! I see him!\" They ran to the direction where he pointed. \"Father don't,\" Viktor said seeing the gun in his father's hand. Ivan uncocked the gun. Ivan aimed the gun first at the other three. \"Stay back,\" he snarled. \"I do this!\" He paused for a second and winced in pain. Then he pointed the gun at his own temple. Rocky approached his former rival. \"Come on, Drago give me the gun,\" he said. Rocky walked to the bench. Drago sprang up as though the American boxer bit him but kept his hand on the gun and the gun near his temple. \"Father please don't do this,\" Viktor begged. \"This ain't the way,\" Rocky said continuing to hold his hand out. \"Now give me the gun.\" \"It's the only way,\" Drago said quietly. \"It is the only way to end all this!\" \"No it's not,\" Rocky said. \"It won't end nothin'.\" \"Nothing. Nichego,\" Ivan said. \"It is so cold. The world has been cold since Creed died.\" \"I know,\" Rocky said. \"Believe me I know but shootin' yourself ain't the answer. All it will do is bring more pain and hurt!\" Ivan closed his eyes \"I have been in pain for 33 years! It never stops hurting! I just want it to be over! I did not intend for your friend to die.\" \"I know you didn',\" Rocky said. Ivan looked squarely at Rocky. For a brief moment, Rocky thought of the time after Apollo died when they stared at each other with equal parts malice and hatred. Now here they were 33 years later staring at each other again and this time Rocky had to save Drago's life. \"It does not matter my intention,\" Ivan said. \"He still died. Dead is dead whether I mean to or not. I tried blocking from my mind tried forgetting! Fighting, working, raising my son! Turning my son into fighter! Anything to distract me, to forget but he's still there! You miss him? Still feel his presence? You wish he were here?\" Rocky's long face was his answer. \"I can't stop thinking of him! I see his body, hear his voice! His ghost haunts me. Tells me I'm nothing but cold killer! I get no sleep because I hear him say I deserve death. He is right!\" \"No no he ain't right,\" Rocky said. \"And that's not Apollo! He wouldn't say somethin' like that! Hell, the guy refused to go to 'Nam because he didn't want to kill nobody! He said that 'No Southeast Asian ever called him uh-\" He looked over at Adonis-\"-well never mind what he said! My point is he didn't want to go over there and kill people! He said 'With boxing there are rules. You fight, you touch gloves, you pick up the prize, you go home! Sure you're a warrior sure you have the eye of the tiger but afterwards you two have a drink together! War ain't like that. All you do is kill them.'\" Ivan wouldn't listen.\"I still hear him even now telling me what terrible person I am that my son is better without me,\" \"Father no,\" Viktor said. Ivan shook his head and turned back to Rocky.. \"He says wonderful things about you. He says Balboa is good man, good fighter, wonderful father whose wife and son love him!\" \"Wait what?\" Rocky asked. \"Apollo didn't say that. He almost never called me Balboa. He always called me Rocky or Stallion. Drago, don't you get it? Apollo ain't hauntin' you. The only one who's hauntin' you is you! It's your own guilt, your own thoughts, that's eatin' you up inside and it's soundin' like Apollo! I know what that feels like!\" \"How can you possibly know? How it feels to be alone? You have friends family are loved. I have nothing except son I don't deserve!\" Viktor shook his head. Ivan said. \"Your friend died! But you did not kill him!\" Rocky lowered his head. \"Yes I did. I was supposed to throw the towel down and I didn't. I keep tellin' myself that Apollo didn' want me to, made me promise not to stop the fight. I say that was the way Apollo wanted to go that if it hadn't been then and you, it would have been some other young punk and he'd be dancin' to some other James Brown song. But youse right, it don't take away that he's dead. The other night, with their fight you did what I couldn't. You threw that towel down for someone you care about!\" \"And yeah I know what it's like to be alone and you know what I ain't better than you. My best friends, wife, my brother-in-law are all dead. I know how it feels to want to die! I boxed a kid half my age because I thought of goin' out like Apollo in some blaze of glory. I have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and didn' want no treatment at first so I could be with Adrian.\" \" I've been tryin' to die so much that my relationship with my son is a mess. He's in Vancouver and we have nothin' to say to each other! We don't talk! Your kid is right here and I can tell he's nuts about you! So no Drago I ain't a better man. I'm like you, just a man.\" Ivan's hand shook but he didn't remove the gun. \"Come on Drago let go don't be a fool,\" Adonis said. He tried to approach the older man but Ivan cocked the gun in warning. Adonis stepped back. \"You must long to see this Adonis, man who killed your father dead by his hand,\" he said. \"It is justice! You and your mother would be very happy! You want this?\" \"No I don't want this and neither does my Mom,\" Adonis said. \"In fact she said that she forgives you.\" \"And you? You forgive me?\" Ivan asked. \"I guess I do,\" Rocky said. \"Otherwise I can't forgive myself.\" Adonis said in silence. \"Donnie?\" Rocky prompted. \"I-\" Adonis began. \"Creed?\" Ivan asked. Adonis at first refused to speak. \"You do not forgive me then say it!\" Adonis hesitated so the Russian yelled. \"SAY IT, BABY CREED!\" \"ALRIGHT!\" Adonis shouted. \"You want me to say it? You want me to say I hate you? Alright, I hate you! Because of you I never met my father and I will never know him! You cheated me out of never knowing him! When I found out how my father died, I wanted to find some way to get to Russia and murder you and your entire family!\" Viktor looked wide eyed. \"Sorry man, no offense. I wanted to give you every blow you ever gave my Pops and find some way to make it hurt worse! Every time I step into the ring, every time I fight some opponent, I hurt just a little because my father isn't there to see it. You caused that and even now I would love to take that gun and blow your fucking brains all over this goddamned park!\" Ivan's hand on the gun loosened as if inviting Adonis to take him up on the offer. \"But I won't do it.\" Adonis's voice softened. \"See all that time I was picturing you and your family, you weren't real to me. You were just some abstract, an idea I had. Some evil enemy that needed to be destroyed like the Boss at the end of a game. I wonder if maybe that was what my Dad was like to you. It's easy to kill someone or want to kill someone when they aren't human to you, some invisible enemy that you are either taught to hate or set up in your mind as some monster.. Once you know who they are, it's a hell of a lot harder. Adonis looked over to Viktor. \"Now I know that I can't take someone else's dad from them. I will never know my father, I have to accept it. I have to live with it. But I can't wish that pain on anyone else especially someone whose dad is all they have. All it will do is hurt Viktor and if you're as half as good a Dad as Viktor thinks you are, then you won't want to either.\" Ivan's hand shook further and the gun lowered to his neck. Viktor approached him as though his father were a wounded animal. Viktor started when he saw something he never saw before: tears in his father's eyes. \"Papa, please.\" Viktor said. He put his hands on his father's covering the gun. Ivan sighed. The emotions wearied him as though he were finally aware of the weight he had been carrying for 57 years of concealing emotions of keeping a stony exterior from the outside world. \"You deserve better. You deserve better than I can give. A father not trainer who gets you hurt. A strong man who puts you through hardship not failed weakling who wants to end his life. The life we saw with your mother. The life I want for you.\" \"Papa,\" Viktor said. \"I have better. I have you. You are strong, always have been. You never abandon me though she did. You are mother and father to me. You remind me everything's okay as long as we are together. You can be hard and sometimes you push too far but I know it's all for me. When I despair and want to give up, you remind me keep going, keep running, keep fighting because you , sometimes I get hurt but it is my choice to do it not yours. You gave me determination and I decide what to do with it. To me, you have always been real champion no matter what is said by others. Papa, we'll get that someday belt, fame, championship, and if we never do so what? None of this means nothing to me if you aren't there to fight with me.\" Ivan winced trying to stop the tears but they came down. \"I can't fight anymore. I am so tired, so weak and tired.\" \"Papa you are not weak because you feel,\" Viktor said. \"You are not made of stone, you are human. You try to be strong, letting me cry to you. Now you cry to me. You took care of me. I care for you now. We care for each other and we fight together. Together we fight and together we win, and together we find our victory.\" Viktor helped Ivan lower the gun and let go. Viktor handed the gun to Rocky. Ivan practically collapsed into his son's arms as they embraced. For the first time in his entire life, Viktor found himself comforting his father. Ivan sobbed in his son's arms. \"It's okay Papa, it's okay,\" he said. \"I'm so proud of you too.\" Ivan turned away. \"You remember that?\" \"Of course I do,\" Viktor said. \"I never told you before that-\" Ivan began but Viktor interrupted. \"You never had to,\" Viktor said. Ivan whispered in his son's ear. \"You have always been my victory, my Vitya.\" \"And you mine, Papa,\" Viktor returned. Viktor held his father's hand as they, Adonis, and Rocky left Fallen Monuments behind. Yes Ivan Drago did cry in his son's arms. He cried for the regrets that he still had, the losses that he still felt but the second chance that he had been given. Author's Note I would like to take a moment to thank the songs \"45\" by Shinedown, \"My Own Prison\" by Creed, and \"Gone Away\" by Offspring and Five Finger Death Punch (particularly the Five Finger Death Punch video. Seriously watch it but bring tissues) for changing the tone of this chapter. Originally it was going to be quieter where Mary Ann and then Rocky come to Ivan's room and he apologizes for Apollo's death. While that was okay it was way too similar to some of my other fics like Unhappy In It's Own Way and My Father Sammy Glick where former enemies bury the hatchet over the bedside of one's sick or injured child. Listening to those three songs repeatedly and comparing them to my story gave me the idea instead to make it more intense and have Adonis, Rocky, Bianca, and Mary Anne rally around Viktor and a suicidal Ivan with Viktor, Rocky, and Adonis talking Ivan out of killing himself. I even paid tribute to those three songs with lines where Ivan believes his \"own prison is to watch his son die\", when he has the gun and Ivan literally \"stares down the barrel of a 45\" (whereas the song is actually a metaphor about the world and moving on), and he tells Rocky, Adonis, and Viktor that \"the world has grown cold since Creed's death\" and Rocky says he knows. 2. Actually there is a deleted scene in Creed II where Ivan apologizes to Adonis and Rocky about Apollo's death that is set after the rematch. Unfortunately we will have to wait for the Blu-ray to experience it but I know one of the lines is that Ivan says to Rocky \"I did not intend for your friend to die\" so I put it in my version. 3. Ivan finding Little Marie attractive refers to a potential fanfic idea in which Ivan and Viktor visit the gang in Philadelphia and their friends set them up with a couple of American girls. Viktor gets set up with Bianca's friend, an MMA fighter named Tasha Lang (\"Her dad used to be a boxer back in the day but he wound up in prison and found Jesus. Now he's a commentator and religious speaker.\" Guess who?) Ivan and Little Marie also start talking and agree to go out on a date. (I couldn't resist the fiendish delight imagining the girl who was like a kid sister to Rocky going out with his former rival.) 4. Adonis refers to he and Viktor having a conversation before the big fight where Viktor says he doesn't hate Adonis. That was a deleted scene from the movie. 5. Viktor talking about his father wearing clothes that are larger is a reference to Dolph Lundgren. When he returned to the role of Drago, he visualized him as being old and worn out. So they gave him bad teeth and larger clothes so it looked like he hadn't been taking care of himself and lost a lot of weight in the intervening years. 5. Yes another Cobra Kai reference. I know I know in Cobra Kai they refer to Rocky as a movie but keep in mind Rocky itself implies the movies exist in their universe. In III and V marching bands play Gonna Fly Now and in V, one of Bobby's bullies refers to him as Stallone (of course since he was played by Sage Stallone that might have been a flub).. Rocky movies might exist within the franchise itself but as true stories, biopics rather than works of fiction. If properly motivated I might expand on this link between Creed II/Cobra Kai by having Rocky and Daniel talk and Ivan and Johnny meet as well. I already have an idea where Daniel meets Rocky and gets all fanboy/geek out on him (\"Rocky Balboa! You're the guy that every East Coast Italian-American kid wanted to be like, well you or Michael Corleone!\") and Johnny expresses admiration for Ivan Drago (\"I was a big fan of yours well as big a fan as any American kid in the 'Reagan-Era-Commie-Hating-Nuke-'Em-All-And-Send-Them-To-The-Stone-Age' '80's could be.\" 6. Raissa 's descriptions on public mental health care in Russia come from multiple sources. 7. As many know the story about Apollo refusing to serve in Vietnam is based on his real life counterpart Muhammad Ali 8. I know this was six chapters but I have a 7th in mind with more closure involving the Dragos, Adonis, Rocky, Mary Ann, and Bianca. It will be called \"Tovarich.\"[Chapter 7] The Unmistakable Fire A Rocky IV/Creed II Fanfic By Auburn Red VII Tovarich Viktor Drago knocked on the hotel door and waited patiently as Rocky opened the door. \"Hey Kid, the others are inside.\" He led Viktor to the suite where he greeted Adonis and Bianca while Rocky sat nearby in the kitchen area. \"Hey Viktor.\" Hi, Vik.\" They greeted at the same time. \"How's your dad?\" Bianca asked. Viktor nodded. \"He is, he's alright as can be expected. Hasn't eaten in two days, but he sleeps mostly. It is good that he does. He is tired so very tired. In Kiev he does not sleep enough. Hope he wakes up soon though, we will check out tomorrow.\" \"Yeah we do too,\" Rocky said. \"Big thank you for making me go last night,\" Viktor said to his new friends. \"Hey you needed it,\" Bianca said. \"I think we all needed a breather,\" Adonis agreed. The previous night, Adonis and Bianca insisted on inviting Viktor with them as they went out drinking and clubbing. At first Viktor refused feeling that it was his duty to watch over his father. But his new American friends persisted telling him that he needed a break for one night. Rocky even offered to look in on Ivan for him. The three had a great time dancing, laughing, singing, sharing childhood memories, and lots of drinking. Viktor never knew what it was like to just have a good time with friends his own age. His father's training and his own introverted nature and suspicions of others got in the way. It was interesting how effortlessly Adonis and Bianca accepted him into their circle and how he actually enjoyed being included. \"Father gave you no trouble did he?\" Viktor asked Rocky. Rocky shrugged. \"Not really, I mean he woke up once and didn't seem too thrilled that I was there. Uh, what does 'Trakhni Tebya' mean?\" Viktor nodded sheepishly. \"Exactly what you think it does.\" \"Yeah thought so,\" Rocky said dryly. \"The pronunciation is you know practically universal. I answered with a 'Vaffanculo.'\" \"Same thing,\" Viktor realized. \"I seen Godfather. He did not fight you after?\" \"Nah, I told him you told me to look in on him. He wasn' happy about it none. But you know he fell right back to sleep and slept the rest of the night. Youse want me to keep that bag here?\" He whispered. \"For now, please,\" Viktor replied. The first thing they did upon returning hotel after rescuing Ivan was return the gun to Dimitri. At first he refused to refund the money but the obvious threatening looks from two young boxers made him return it with interest. The night before he left with Adonis and Bianca, Viktor gave Rocky a small bag of razors, knives, pills, and other potentially lethal objects. \"I keep them locked away from him, but I worry if I go out. Keep in your room please.\" Rocky nodded. \"Worried he'll try it again?\" Viktor nodded but didn't say anything feeling ashamed. Rocky patted the Ukrainian boxer on the shoulder. \"Hey no problem, after Adrian died I had to do the same thing.\" \"Lock means of suicide away from family member?\" Viktor asked. \"Lock means of suicide away from me,\" Rocky said. Viktor put his hand on the American's shoulder in sympathy. \"Hey Viktor come over here,\" Adonis invited. \"Bianca and I want to teach you something.\" \"Alright,\" Viktor said as he sat across from them at the table. He taught them a few Russian phrases the night before which they jokingly mangled but were able to catch on. \"We are gonna talk to our daughter soon on Skype\" Adonis began. \"Oh I can leave,\" Viktor said. He was about to stand when Bianca gently nudged him back down. Adonis continued. \"And we were wondering if you wanted to talk to her also.\" Viktor looked at the married couple. \"Really?\" He missed the conspiratorial grin between husband and wife like they shared a surprise. \"Yeah I mean you're our friend,\" Adonis said. \"Alright,\" Viktor said. \"I know no sign language, does that matter?\" \"Well at this age technically no,\" Bianca said. \"But it will help her get used to it when she starts learning it. So we want to teach you a couple of phrases.\" He followed his friends as they showed him how to sign \"Hi Amara\" and \"I'm Viktor\" with his fingers. Rocky let Mary Ann in the hotel room as they were talking. She offered them Turkish coffee and vatrushka which she bought at a nearby bakery. They accepted the treats with thanks. There was a sixth for Ivan in case he woke up that lay unattended. \"They're teachin' sign language,\" Rocky said as the trio returned to their lessons. Mary Ann nodded. \"How's he?\" Mary Ann asked nodding in the direction of Ivan's hotel room. \"Sleepin' all the time,\" Rocky said. \"Viktor said he hadn't eaten for a couple of days now.\" \"He's going to need some kind of professional help when he goes back to Kiev,\" she observed. \"Yeah but he ain't never gonna admit it,\" Rocky said. \"Now we all have gestures to go with our names,\" Bianca explained. \"It's sort of like shorthand.\" She held her closed hand to her mouth like a microphone. \"This is mine.\" Adonis then showed his fists. \"This is mine.\" He crossed his hands over his heart. \"This is Mom's.\" He motioned to Mary Ann who nodded. He then held his fists high in the air. \"This is Rocky. I have no idea where we came up with that one.\" Bianca nodded in mock innocence. \"It just came to us.\" \"I have some idea,\" Viktor said. \"Father and I visit Art Museum.\" \"Hey,\" Rocky teased. \"What were you doin' there?\" \"Stealing-what is phrase-thunder,\" Viktor teased back. \"If you're going to be our friend we got to think of one for you,\" Bianca said. \"We got too many boxers though so no fists.\" \"Well you know her Daddy's the best why bother with the rest,\" Adonis said flexing his muscles. \"Our previous match said otherwise,\" Viktor mocked. \"Yeah well I got this last one,\" Adonis said. \"Only because Father threw in towel,\" Viktor countered. \"Yeah but I was the reason your Dad threw in the towel,\" Adonis said back. \"Shouldn't we stop them?\" Mary Ann said. Rocky held up his hand. \"Ah no no no. Theyse friends now. It's like they are sparring. All boxers who were former rivals and later friends go through it. Now that the match is over, they can joke about it. It was like that wit' me and Apollo.\" Adonis and Viktor continued their verbal sparring until Bianca spoke. \"Do I have to separate you boys?\" She couldn't contain her laughter. The guys laughed right along with her as Adonis held her closer. \"So what do you think would be a good sign for you, Viktor?\" Bianca said. \" I don't know?\" Viktor said. \" Father says I am his victory, so maybe.\" He held up two Vs. \"For Victory.\" \"Ah the Nixon,\" Rocky joked. \"Is that alright?\" Viktor asked. \"I like it,\" Bianca said. \"That will work,\" Adonis said. \"Untrue but it will work.\" \"You just wait until rematch when.\" He held up the two Vs. \"Defeats.\" He held up his fists. \"Oh yeah?\" Adonis signed. \"Great,\" Bianca rolled her eyes. \"Instead of Trash Talk these guys will be doing Trash Sign.\" She looked at her phone. \"Oh it's time!\" She reached over to her laptop and turned on the Wifi. An older woman waved at them on Skype then picked up a small infant. Both her parents gushed. They spoke and signed.\"Hi Amara!\" \"Hi Beautiful, you being good?\" Amara giggled at her parents. Viktor could see the two hearing aids on her ears. Viktor couldn't help but think that she not only looked like her parents but her grandfather as well. They signed and spoke having a typical conversation with their baby girl. \"Yeah we're all here,\" Adonis said. He gave the gestures as he spoke. \"Mama, Daddy, Granny, Rocky and-\" He and Bianca exchanged a knowing smile as Adonis held a \"U\" sign to the side of his head and twisted it twice before he did the V gesture. Viktor was confused. \"What did that mean?\" He asked. Bianca grinned. \"Uncle Viktor.\" Viktor's mouth dropped open in surprise. \"Really that is why you want me to talk with her?\" Adonis smiled. \"Yeah we were talking about it and only if it's okay with you. We don't have too many siblings and the ones we do have don't keep in touch especially my half brother and sister. So you can be like our honorary brother. Or rather like my honorary brother and Bianca's honorary brother in law.\" Viktor smiled. \"I don't have friends and I would like that very much.\" Bianca waved him forward. \"You want to say hi to your niece?\" \"Oh I do not know,\" Viktor said. \"Suppose I start talking to her. She won't understand.\" \"It's alright,\" Adonis said. \"Just say what you feel.\" Viktor sat closer to the laptop camera so the baby could see him. He waved and signed. \"Hi Amara, I'm Viktor.\" He looked at the little one and spoke. \"You do not understand but I am friend of your mother and father. Your Dyadya. I am not related well you can tell by looking at us, no? I had honorary uncle and aunt when I was baby like you. They were friends, my father's best friends, but they were also family to me and my father. Our only friends, our only family. Well until now anyway. They died when I was small and I still miss them. Papa does too though he would never say. If you allow me, I will be as good uncle to you and as good brother to your father and mother as my Dyadya Sasha and Tatiya Ayzere were to me and my father. That is promise.\" Though she didn't understand, Amara's smile melted Viktor. \"Does she like me?\" \"Yes she does,\" Bianca said. Rocky smiled at the sweet scene in front of him. It was nice that they were all together and their wounds healed. If only all wounds could heal this much. He thought sadly of his own unfinished business that lay in Vancouver. A knock filled the room. Rocky and Mary Ann exchanged a confused look as Rocky opened the door. Ivan Drago stood on the outside looking like he would rather be anywhere else. He swayed back a little which Rocky attributed to the constant sleeping and lack of food that he had for the past couple of days. \"Is my son with you?\" He asked sounding nervous. \"Yeah he's inside with the other kids,\" Rocky said. From the hallway, Ivan could hear Viktor say \"See she is already speaking Russian. She signed 'da!'\" \"Uh no,\" Adonis corrected. \"She is signing 'Da Da' you know as in 'Daddy wiped the fwoor wif that big scawy Wukwainian man.\" \"No she is signing 'da' like \"Yes Uncle is much better boxer than Father!'\" \"I don't think she was really aware of what was going on guys,\" Bianca interjected. \"For all you two know she could be signing 'antidisestablishmentarianism.'\" \"She does that I'm booking her on Steve Harvey! Forget boxing!\" Adonis quipped. The others laughed. Ivan's eyes widened in surprise at the sound of laughter. \"Is that Viktor?\" He asked surprised. \"Yeah,\" Rocky asked. \"Who else you think he was?\" Ivan shook his head. \"No it is that I have not heard him laugh since- I don't even remember last time I heard him laugh.\" Rocky waved him forward. \"You wanna come in or somethin'?\" \"Oh no I could not,\" Ivan said. He was about to turn away when Rocky held him by the shoulder. \"Come on go ahead,\" he said. \"I forgive you for telling me to go fuck myself okay.\" Ivan hesitated but followed the American into the hotel room. Viktor broke into a smile as he walked up to his father. \"Are you alright?\" He asked concerned. \"Yes I just wondered where you were and Balboa invited me inside,\" Ivan said. Viktor squeezed his father by the shoulders. \"Really Viktor I am fine,\" Ivan said determined. Viktor awkwardly sat down next to his friends occasionally giving worried glances at his father. Adonis also looked serious and stone faced at the older Russian as though he wanted to say something but thought that it was inappropriate. \"Would you like some coffee, Mr. Drago?\" Mary Ann asked. \"Oh no thank you-\" He began. Mary Ann held up one hand interrupting. \"Let me rephrase that. Viktor said that you haven't eaten in two days. You. Coffee. Food. Now!\" She pointed at the kitchen table. Ivan stepped back faking intimidation. \"Well you put like that.\" He sat across from Rocky and Mary Ann as he sipped the coffee and ate the vatrushka. Ivan thought of when he first recognized friendship in Sasha and Ayzere. It was the same situation: he had been offered food. He refused but the woman serving it wouldn't take no for an answer concerned about his health. Ivan was no longer sure what he believed but he wondered if somehow Sasha and Ayzere's spirits made their way into this Philadelphian former boxer and Californian socialite reminding him that he was not alone. It was strange to think about. They would certainly make the oddest of spirits, Ivan thought. Ayzere would wrestle any other ghosts and Sasha would talk the ear off of any exorcist or paranormal investigator who was listening. Ivan's face broke into a smile and a laugh emerged from his throat which he tried to stifle back. Rocky and Mary Ann stepped back in surprise. \"What was that?\" He turned to Mary Ann. \"You heard that right?\" \"I did,\" Mary Ann agreed. \"I didn't think that he could do it.\" \"Is that one of the signs of the Apocalypse like a plague of locusts, or a reality show guy becomin' President? A laughing Russian?\" Ivan smirked. \"If you must know in Russia, we do smile and laugh just not in front of strangers.\" \"Ohh,\" Mary Ann said touched by the implication of Ivan's words. \"Huh?\" Rocky asked. Mary Ann slightly elbowed him in the ribs. Then he caught on. \"Oh I got it now. We're not strangers no more.\" \"You are one of smartest American boxers. I can tell,\" Ivan said dryly. Rocky shrugged. \"I dunno smart enough to outfight you. Smart enough to marry the right woman.\" Ivan sighed. \"You were that.\" He agreed. \"So what was the joke earlier?\" Rocky asked. \"It's just now you both reminded me of friends of mine,\" Ivan said. He suspected that they were surprised. \"Yes I have friends! Not many, only two in fact both dead.\" Rocky nodded to Viktor. \"Yeah he was sayin' something about them like they was like his aunt and uncle?\" Ivan nodded. He gave them a brief sketch of Sasha and Ayzere and what they meant to the father and son and how they died. \"I was laughing because I imagined their presence and how they would make very strange guardians. I don't suppose anyone would have stranger.\" Rocky laughed. \"Hey who am I to judge? One of my guardian angels once told me 'Wake up you son of a bitch 'Cause Mickey loves ya!'\" \"Sounds like something they would say,\" Ivan said. \"Hey Grandma,\" Adonis said. \"Someone wants some face time with you before she goes down for her nap..\" He pointed at the screen. \"Oh okay,\" Mary Ann said as she approached the laptop to communicate with her granddaughter. Adonis looked around. \"Ivan can I talk to you outside alone?\" He invited him to come with him to the balcony. Ivan nodded and followed. Adonis waited until he and Ivan were alone and the door closed before he spoke. His voice was firm. \"I want you to know Viktor's my friend and because of that I will be nice to you.\" \"Yes,\" Ivan said. \"I will be nice to you but I'm not ready to forgive you\" Adonis said. \"I did some soul searching about how I felt about you and my Dad. I know you didn't mean to and I know that you felt like he was your enemy but he was also my Dad, the Dad I'll never know. You're here and he's not. I don't hate you anymore but I can't forgive you not yet.\" Ivan sighed. He didn't expect those feelings to die so quickly. Adonis was young, hot headed, and still missed his father. \"I appreciate your honesty, Adonis. If it is consolation, I am not ready to forgive myself.\" Adonis nodded. \"You wanna come inside?\" He offered begrudgingly. \"I will wait out here, all same,\" Ivan said. Adonis shrugged. Ivan looked out the early evening Moscow skyline. Some things were going to take more time than others. Ivan watched the sunset over Moscow, the place that was once home. Where was his home? Where did he belong? Ivan had been through such an emotional wringer the past few days almost a week. He realized that it wasn't over. He recognized that even though he wanted to live, there was a small part of him that wanted to climb to the top of the balcony and jump off. It would be so easy just to dangle your foot ever so slightly off the edge and let the rest follow. Ivan gingerly placed one foot on the ledge. He was about to put the other one over when he heard the door open. He turned around to see Rocky. \"My opinion last night still stands,\" Ivan said gruffly. \"Not interested,\" Rocky countered. \"You plannin' on staying all night out here in the cold?\" \"It's not cold,\" Ivan said. \"It's -2 degrees out here, is sweltering!\" \"If you say so,\" Rocky said doubtfully. \"Where is Viktor?\" Ivan asked. \"Off with the other kids doing social media Millennials Insta-Face-Twitter-Gram-Book things I don't know.\" Rocky stood next to the ledge. \"So Viktor tells me youse grew up here in Moscow.\" \"Need a tour?\" Ivan asked dryly. \"No I thought I'd ask it's called conversation. Where abouts you grew up?\", Rocky prompted. Ivan pointed in the southeast direction. \"Over there Kapotnya. From what I understand hasn't changed much. You were either unemployed, criminal, or unemployed criminal.\" \"Sounds familiar,\" Rocky said. \"So youse get into any fights?\" \"Of course,\" Ivan said. \"Who did not?\" \"I would never have pictured you growin' up like that like I did,\" Rocky said. \"What exactly did you picture?\" Ivan said. \"Well originally created out of some kind of futuristic factory or lab,\" Rocky said. Ivan's confused state made him translate. \"It was a joke. If I had to think about it, I pictured I dunno you bein' disciplined a lot maybe an army brat, you know, a kid who's folks were in the military, or something.\" \"Well my father was in Army but was discharged by the time I was old enough to remember, so you are close,\" Ivan said. \"Discipline came later in the orphanage and then when I joined the Army.\" He said the last couple of words with a disdain that Rocky caught. \"You don't sound happy about being there. I take you didn't choose to go in.\" \"Balboa,\" Ivan said. \"When I was growing, no one ask you what you want. You did not choose what you did, is chosen for you. Orphans have less options than anyone. Occasionally one may go to University if they were scholar. But for most of us you fit profile and you have orders. Boxing was only thing that made me different made people notice something I had control over. When I stepped in ring, it was me they looked at not a faceless part of Russia just me. Suppose it's different in America.\" \"Well most people yeah but where I lived in poor areas was kind of like that,\" Rocky said. \"The smart ones went to college. The rest of us worked, got drafted, or like you said became criminals. As for me, well I didn't go to college or the military. I worked for a bit but mostly did stuff with loan sharks. It was kind of like that with me and boxing too. I wasn't just some dumb kid of a couple of broke Italian immigrants or crook beating people up to get money for someone else, I was somebody.\" \"You mean you did not go to 'Nahm,\" Ivan asked drawing a twang out of the American slang term for Vietnam. \"You would be right age.\" \"Yeah but I had a hardship deferment and a criminal record,\" Rocky said.\"Plus I was already starting to become a boxer. So I wasn't in good medical shape for Uncle Sam neither. I missed out on that fun.\" \"You were very fortunate,\" Ivan mumbled. \"So where you going from here?\" Rocky asked. Ivan shrugged. \"I really do not know. There is not much to return to in Kiev. But Moscow is no better.\" Ivan sighed looking out at Moscow's lights starting to turn on in the evening. \"I don't know why we even bother coming back here expecting things are different. They never are.\" \"Hey you're not Communist anymore,\" Rocky said with enthusiasm. \"That means nothing in the end,\" Ivan said. \"Balboa let me tell you secret. There is no difference between Moscow now, Moscow in 1985, and Moscow in 1992. Probably not in 1917 for all I know. No matter who leads or what they believe some will always be more equal than others. I thought coming back here, Viktor and I would be accepted and we find our home but is still the same. They only care when you win. We don't belong here. We don't belong in Kiev, where we are starving stray dogs. We don't belong anywhere.\" \"Maybe you can I dunno try your luck in America?\" Rocky suggested. Ivan scoffed. \"The place where I am thought of only as Apollo Creed's killer? Have that over Viktor's head? I thought my home was Russia. Now I don't know where it is.\" Rocky thought about it. \"You want my advice?\" \",You will give it whether I say yes,\" Ivan smirked. Rocky continued. \"You know I moved around myself. Not to different countries, or nothin' but I moved from my old neighborhood in Philly to a mansion, back to the old neighborhood. I was confused like you but one thing I knew that home wasn't the house we lived in or the country. It's the people we live with. Home was wherever Adrian was, and Bobby. Heck even where Mickey, Apollo, and Paulie were. For you home is wherever Viktor is.\" \"Is not a happy home,\" Ivan hung his head. \"My fault that it is not.\" \"You know there's still time to change that,\" Rocky said. Ivan shrugged. \"I do not know how. I spent my life hating you and so many others. I don't hate but I don't feel anything now just emptiness. I raised that boy on hatred pushed him for so long until he broke. Yes, he believes it is for his good but that did not make it right. So much that I have to make right and I have been one way for so long that I do not know how to be anyone else.\" \"Come on that ain't true,\" Rocky said. \"You really don't know me well,\" Ivan said. Rocky said. \"Look if you were really as hateful as you make yourself out to be would your son love you as much as he does? Would he have gone through as much Hell as he did the other day to keep you from offin' yourself? What about those buddies of yours Sasha and what's his name-\" \"Sasha was man and Ayzere was woman,\" Ivan supplied. \"Yeah them,\" Rocky said. \"Sounds like they practically adopted youse. They saw something in ya. You made friends before. You showed you loved that kid before. He clearly knows you love him. You can do it again. In fact I wouldn't mind being your friend.\" Ivan started. \"Mine? You remember who I am, yes? The man who killed your friend?\" \"Look we'd been over this,\" Rocky said. \"I told you I forgave you. Now I'd like to do more wit' that.\" \"Why?\" Ivan asked. \"'Cause you could use one and so could I,\" Rocky said. \"There aren't too many people my age left no more and youse been doing everything by yourself. It'd be nice if we helped each other.\" He stuck out his hand. \"So what do you say?\" Ivan did not take it. \"I am not ready.\" Rocky closed his hand. \"I am not even sure how to begin with my son. I am out of practice,\" Ivan said. \"So start easy,\" Rocky suggested. \" I dunno, go runnin' with the kid. Don't train him. Train alongside him.\" \"It's not easy to just turn off over fifty years of hatred,\" Ivan said. \"So it's gonna to take awhile,\" Rocky said. \"You got years and I don't think Viktor's goin' anywhere anytime soon. No one's expectin' it to be fixed right away, but at least start. Remember Viktor's where your home is. He needs to know that. My son Bobby and I call it the home team. You know that's like in baseball when they play a game in their hometown-\" \"- And the local team has the advantage because spectators should cheer for the local athlete,\" Ivan said sadly. \"I know what it supposed to mean.\" \"Yeah,\" Rocky said realizing how awkward that definition was for the Dragos when they had been rejected as the home team not once but twice. Ivan looked around. \"You have no home team.\" \"Well I got Donnie,\" Rocky said thumbing at the direction of Adonis and Bianca's room. \"But those other people you mention are dead and your son is in Vancouver and you do not speak,\" he said. \"That's about it,\" Rocky said. \"Does he know that you are ill?\" Ivan asked. Rocky shook his head. \"You want my advice?\" \"It's only fair I gave it to you,\" Rocky said. \"You should go see him,\" Ivan suggested. \"Both of you live. It is no good to spend your life in the past among the dead. I know this to be true. You go to your son.\" Rocky lowered his head. \"He has a son I never even seen.\" \"Then go see your grandson,\" Ivan said. \"You say Viktor and I have time but you may not. Bobby deserves to know truth about you and your condition. Do not leave Bobby wondering what may have been.\" \"Now I'm the one who's not ready,\" Rocky said. \"Then when you return to Philadelphia be ready,\" Ivan said. \"You helped give Viktor his father back and I thank you. Please do the same for your son.\" Rocky nodded. \"You know something, you're actually a nice guy.\" Ivan smiled. \"What?\" \"I don't believe anyone has ever called me 'niyece gai.'\" He exaggerated the American slang again that made Rocky laugh. \"It's about time someone did,\" Rocky said. \"Think about what I said about your son.\" \"And yours,\" Ivan agreed. \"It will take great change.\" A mischievous grin spread across his face. \"But 'If I can change and you can change…'\" \"Yeah I get it,\" Rocky laughed. \"You know I heard someone say that once.\" \"That someone is very smart man,\" Ivan said. Rocky was touched. \"You know you're probably the first person to say that about him.\" \"It's about time someone did,\" Ivan repeated. The next day a group of six headed out of the hotel as four headed for the airport to fly back to America and two headed for the train station to ride back to the Ukraine. Viktor hugged Adonis and Bianca as they posed for a selfie. \"You have got to come to America to see us!\" Bianca said. \"I can't wait for Amara to meet her Uncle.\" \"I cannot wait to see her myself,\" Viktor said. \"Yeah you guys will love California,\" Adonis teased. \"But don't scared when you see that ball of fire. It might confuse you at first but it's called the sun. It's supposed to be in the sky. It brings warmth.\" Viktor mockingly held his breath at this \"marvel.\" \"I have heard of such things but only saw them in pictures. Is it true that it burns skin?\" \"Always wear sunscreen,\" Adonis said imitating a wise guru. \"He has seen the sun,\" Ivan said sarcastically. \"July is warm and dry in Ukraine.\" \"Damn I thought we were onto something,\" Adonis said. \"Still I would not mind visiting my friends in Philly and L.A.\" Viktor said. \"He's sounding like a native already,\" Bianca said pretending to get choked up. Adonis wiped an imaginary tear. The three hugged promising to text, and DM each other. Bianca approached Ivan and warmly shook his hand. She then stepped back. There was an awkward moment as Ivan and Adonis stared at each other. But Adonis stuck out his hand. \"Good luck, Ivan. Viktor has a good dad.\" Ivan returned the handshake. \"And Apollo has good son.\" Adonis looked sad for a moment but nodded. Mary Ann approached Viktor. \"You looked at it?\" She asked. Viktor nodded. \"Yes I do not think he will like it but I will talk it over with him in Kiev, but thank you, Bianca, and Raissa for finding it. It seems like good place.\" He embraced his friend's mother. Mary Ann approached Ivan. \"Goodbye, Ivan.\" They shook hands. \"Goodbye Mary Ann,\" he said. Rocky gave Viktor a firm hearty hand grasp as they fell into an embrace. \"God what does your old man feed you? No wonder you almost beat Donnie.\" \"Emphasis on almost,\" Adonis yelled. \"Wait until rematch,\" Viktor called back. \"Goodbye Rocky.\" \"Look after your dad, kid,\" Rocky said. \"I will,\" Viktor promised. Rocky approached Ivan and stuck his fists out. \"To the end, Ivan?\" Ivan returned the greeting. \"To the end Rocky….tovarich...Comrade.\" Rocky nodded and joined his friends as they left. \"Now you promised,\" Viktor said waiting impatiently inside the truck. \"If you won, I do something for you. If I win, you do something for me. I beat you fair and square. You are coming with me!\" Ivan rolled his eyes. It was shortly after their jog. \"Maybe you becoming Adonis and Bianca's friend was a mistake. You have become very impudent of late.\" \"Will you just get in?\" Viktor asked. Ivan rolled his eyes. \"Where is this place that I just have to go?\" \"Somewhere that will help you prepare for your next fight,\" Viktor said mysteriously. \"I don't have a fight you know that,\" Ivan said. \"You'll see,\" Viktor said. \"Now close your eyes.\" Viktor pulled the truck up to the parking lot. \"Okay you can open your eyes now,\" he said. \"I still do not know why you had to go through such dramatics,\" Ivan began then he opened his eyes. The building looked like any other until he read the title: Kiev Counseling Psychiatric Services. \"It's the biggest fight you ever fought,\" Viktor said. \"Ivan Drago vs. Himself.\" Ivan glared at his son. He at first asked for the keys but Viktor refused. Ivan then opened the passenger seat and stormed out. Viktor followed him. \"Take me home right now,\" Ivan demanded. He gave him the intimidating stare that in younger years would have made Viktor instantly obey but Viktor was not going to back down. \"Nyet! This is for your own good. It's not a hospital like the state ones in Russia. It is just a place where you can talk to somebody. They help with former soldiers and others who have had traumatic experiences. It's a good place. I researched it on the Internet and so did Mary Ann and Bianca and a woman at the hospital in Moscow.\" \"You talked about me,\" Ivan said. Viktor retorted. \"Yes the same night when you wandered off to ubey sebya.\" Kill yourself. \"I had to!\" \"How much does it cost?\" Ivan said. \"Don't worry I paid for it with the money from our matches.\" \"You only know this place from the Internet,\" Ivan accused. \"You don't know what it is really like!\" \"Papa please,\" Viktor argued. \"I visited the office and spoke to the staff. In fact, I uh well I have been talking to.a doctor there myself.\" \"You have been?\" Ivan said. \"What about?\" \"Different things,\" Viktor said. \"About myself, about fighting, about you. It's helped.\" \"How has it?\" Ivan asked. \"It's someone else to talk to,\" Viktor said. \"It's no different than if I hurt myself I would go see a doctor. They are very kind and helpful.\" \"I am not going to do this tell my problems to.a total stranger,\" Ivan argued. He was about to walk off again when Viktor said. \"So you rather deal with them alone?\" Ivan turned around to face his son. \"That's what got you where you were in Moscow, Papa.\" Ivan walked off but Viktor stood in front. \"Papa I cannot go through that again,\" Viktor said. \"You need more help than I can give. Chert poberi, godammit, why are you being so stubborn about this? Are you afraid they might find everything about you? Think you are too weak?\" \"Going to see someone like that makes me weak,\" Ivan snapped. Viktor shook his head. \"Papa no it doesn't. The strong one is the one who seeks help. You cannot do this alone and you won't be. I will be in the waiting room. I will even go into the therapist office if they let me.\" Ivan stood still but did not move. Viktor held out his hand. Ivan approached him. \"You would be with me?\" He asked. \"You don't even have to ask,\" Viktor said. Ivan took his son's hand and caught his breath over a very familiar situation. \"What's the matter Papa?\" \"I just realized that for the first time you remind me of your mother,\" Ivan observed. \"The certainty, the forcefulness, the things I once loved about her.\" Viktor bristled. \"With one big difference.\" \"Which is?\" Ivan asked. \"Unlike her I actually do care about you,\" Viktor said. He squeezed his father's hand tightly. \"Now come, Papa.\" Ivan put his other hand on top of his son's as he led him inside. \"Alright Vitya.\" Ivan Drago smiled as his son led him inside showing the love and support that they always had. The End Author's Notes There's an inside reference to Ivan and Rocky's War of Curse Words. Viktor says he knows what \"vaffanculo\" means because he saw The Godfather. The curse word is yelled between Connie Corleone (Talia \"Adrian\" Shire) and her abusive husband, Carlo. Oddly enough unless I am mistaken I believe Sylvester Stallone auditioned for the part of Carlo which means he and Talia Shire would have played a married couple long before they were Rocky and Adrian though a very dysfunctional unhappily married couple. The line \"It's _ degrees out here it's sweltering!\" Comes from the MST3K episode The joke about the ball of flame in the sky called the sun is a running gag in our house when we have several days of rain or snow.

La princesa Moanna dio una pequeña risita de niña traviesa. Orara, pero si tú también estuviste ahí- dijo la princesa dejando de ver por la ventana. Sí, pero yo fui sólo un pequeño insecto en un bosque interminable, nunca trate con los humanos como vos- dijo la ninfa de color azul- ¿cómo es la vida de los hombres? La princesa no pudo más que sonreírse, después de regresar al reino de su padre esa era la pregunta recurrente por todos los cortesanos, por todos los súbditos ¿cómo es la vida de los hombres? La vida de los hombres está llena de mentiras- dijo una voz desde la puerta de la habitación de la princesa. La princesa Moanna pareció asustada al principio, Orara se puso de pie al momento entre la princesa y el desconocido. Los guardias no tardaron en llegar. ¿Podeís decirme por qué la interrumpción?- preguntó la princesa intentando verse más alta de lo que era. El recién llegado hizo una reverencia. No deseaba importunarla- dijo- pero esas conversaciones del reino mortal no son apropiadas para una princesa... Y aun un príncipe no puede entrar de esta forma en las habitaciones de una princesa- dijo Orara. El error ha sido vuestro, ninfa- dijo el príncipe- vos habeís dejado abierta la puerta. Orara se sonrojo lo que provocó que sus mejillas azuladas tomaran un color azul marino. Sólo he venido a informaros que vuestro padre os espera en la sala del trono- dijo el príncipe retirándose. Los guardias de la princesa al ver que no había ningún problema también regresaron a sus puestos de vigilancia. Da miedo- dijo la princesa Moanna cuando ella y Orara se vieron solas de nuevo. Un poco- dijo la ninfa. ....................................................................................................... En la sala del trono del rey de Bezmorra, con sus tres tronos de oro al centro, con los palcos repletos de cortesanos. La reina la luna con su pequeño en brazos a la izquierda del rey, el rey al centro con la blanca cabeza coronada por la corona de oro y a la derecha el trono de su hija la princesa Moanna aun vacío por su retraso. ¿Tarde?- preguntó el fauno con una media sonrisa al ver llegar a la princesa junto con Orara. Nos retrasamos un poco- dijo la niña arreglando su vestido. Orara con un paño limpiaba un poco los rojos zapatos de la princesa. Entrad, os esperan- dijo el fauno con una reverencia. La princesa Moanna hizo una reverencia al estar frente a su padre, el rey se sonrió; era el morador de Bezmorra más feliz de todos desde el regreso de su hermosa hija. Su majestad- dijo el fauno haciéndose escuchar por todos los presentes- el príncipe Nuada, lanza de plata; hijo del rey Balor rey de los elfos, señor del reino de Bethmoora. Al momento el príncipe Nuada, con la tez blanca como la nieve, el cabello rubio albino como la plata y las puntas de oro hizo su entrada. La princesa Moanna miro rápidamente hacia donde Orara y el Fauno se encontraban, la ninfa entendió la mirada de la niña y asintió. El príncipe no estaba ahí solo para dar sus respetos a los soberanos...[Chapter 2] 2 La princesa Moanna escuchaba con mucha atención todo lo que el príncipe Nuada decía, no podía creer que algo tan grave estuviera sucediendo. Según las palabras del príncipe Nuada, las sombras se encontraban preparando lo que sería un ataque contra el reino subtérraneo de Bezmorra y al reino de los elfos de Bethmoora. La princesita aun se confundía con la semejanza entre los nombres de ambos reinos, en una ocasión le pregunto a su padre el por qué del parecido y él solamente se límito a decir que siempre había sido así. En un momento la princesa se perdió entre las palabras del príncipe Nuada, y cuando regreso su atención al príncipe de tez blanca como la luna éste hablaba sobre hacerles frente. ¿Guerra? eso era lo que planeaba el príncipe Nuada. La princesa Moanna negó con la cabeza, sabía muy bien lo que provocaba una guerra, lo había visto en el reino mortal condenado a morir, aun recordaba con miedo al capitán Vidal, a Mercedes y su hermano tratando de detener a ese monstruo... No, no quería que algo así llegara al reino subtérraneo donde no se conoce la mentira ni el dolor. El rey de Bezmorra era de la misma idea de su hija, hablo con sabiduría al príncipe Nuada, no se unirían en una cruzada para acabar con las sombras, el príncipe Nuada no pudo reprimir su decepción al escuchar las palabras del rey. Algo planea- pensó la princesa Moanna. Ya antes había visto esa misma determinación en los ojos de alguien más... ........................................................................................................ Después de escuchar a los consejeros y las sabias palabras del Fauno los nobles de Bezmorra se retiraron, el príncipe Nuada hizo una inclinación muy leve de cabeza al rey y a la reina con su hijo en brazos. La princesa Moanna fue de las últimas en retirarse acompañada de Orara, el Fauno había partido después del rey. El príncipe Nuada aun continuaba de pie, el brillo en sus ojos no había disminuido. Planea algo- se dijo una vez más la princesa Moanna- y lo hara aunque mi padre no le de su apoyo. ......................................................................................................... El príncipe Nuada fue conducido a una habitación preparada específicamente para él, era un invitado de honor para el rey de Bezmorra. El hijo del rey Balor dio las gracias y se retiro. La princesa Moanna había regresado a su habitación, Orara estaba con ella como siempre desde que regresará al reino subtérraneo. ¿Qué piensas?- preguntó de pronto la princesa Moanna- ¿crees que corramos peligro? Orara no contesto, no sabía que contestar, estaba nerviosa, tener al príncipe Nuada ponía nervioso a cualquiera. ¿Qué crees que haría el Fauno?- preguntó de nuevo la princesa. Hacer la voluntad del rey- dijo Orara aun sentada en el suelo. ¿Y si mi padre se equivoca?- la princesa se acercó a Orara- no quiero que las sombras introduzcan el miedo y el dolor en nuestro reino. Orara tuvo un mal presentimiento. Pensaís abandonar el reino subtérraneo- dijo en un susurro temiendo las paredes le escucharan- vuestro padre se enfurecerá. La princesa Moanna se sonrió. Solamente quiero lo mejor para el reino- dijo la niña- pero para salir necesito tu ayuda. Orara se mordió los labios hasta hacerse daño, ella había sido quien ayudo a la princesa hacía tanto para ir a la tierra de los mortales condenados a morir, no, en esta ocasión Orara no quería ayudarle, no quería hacer enojar al Fauno, no quería volver a perder a la princesa, y aun así, el deseo de la princesa Moanna era una orden para la dulce Orara. El Fauno se dará cuenta- dijo Orara Será esta misma noche- djo la princesa Moanna- cuando los guardias cambien de turno, cuando mis padres se encuentren descansando... Pero no sabeís donde se encuentran las sombras- dijo Orara- princesa, vos no sabeís quienes son esas criaturas. Había miedo en la voz de Orara, no miedo por ella sino por la pequeña niña. La princesa Moanna se miro por un largo rato los zapatos rojos brillantes que siempre usaba desde su regreso al reino de su padre. En ese caso- dijo con una sonrisa- debemos ir con quien ya les ha visto... Orara no pudo reprimir un gemido de miedo. ........................................................................................ Bajo el cobijo de la oscuridad, una figura cubierta por una capucha roja caminaba lo más rápido que podía, las luces mortecinas le ayudaban a pasar desapercibida. Los guardias cambiaban de guardia, sólo era necesario tomar tiempos para que ninguno de ellos reparara en su presencia. De pronto una puerta de madera, grande y pesada se abrió protestando sobre sus goznes. La figura corrió para entrar antes de que la puerta volviera a cerrarse. Nadie me vio- dijo la princesa Moanna retirando la capucha. Es mejor apresurarnos- dijo Orara echando un vistazo a su alrededor. La princesa Moanna llevaba un pequeño bolso debajo de la capa con capucha roja que llevaba puesta. Espero no olvidar nada- dijo la niña mientras Orara indicaba otro corredor mal iluminado que debían tomar. Ahí estaba una vez más, la salida del palacio del rey de Bezmorra, cerca los jardínes concéntricos de los que siempre hablaba el Fauno. El Fauno, por un momento la princesa Moanna quiso regresar para contarle al más humilde de sus súbditos, al más sabio, a su mejor amigo lo que planeaba; pero, al momento rechazo esta idea, seguramente no la dejaría ir, es más, avisaría a su padre y todo su plan se arruinaría. La princesa y la ninfa debían apresurarse, el príncipe Nuada había referido durante la cena que pensaba marcharse, ya había cumplido al menos con su obligación de alertarles, si el reino subtérraneo de Bezmorra no pensaba enfrentar a las Sombras allá ellos. Rápido, rápido- se repetía la princesa Moanna mientras subía las escaleras en forma de caracol. Si ella u Orara equivocaban el camino terminarían en la tierra de los mortales, afortunadamente con la protección de la luna no había temor de que el sol las deslumbrara y olvidaran quienes eran. Ahora lo importante era dar alcance al príncipe Nuada, seguramente él podría decirles como evitar que las sombras atacaran Bezmorra. En un momento dado mientras subían los escalones la princesa Moanna piso su vestido perdiendo el equilibrio, Orara intentó atraparla pero fue inútil, la niña tuvo miedo de que todo terminara antes de empezar. Parecía que se haría daño al caer, pero tan rápida como el rayo una mano blanca la sujeto por la muñeca evitando que cayera. ¿Me estáis siguiendo?- preguntó el príncipe Nuada clavando en ella esa mirada de ámbar. La princesa Moanna tenía un nudo en la garganta ¿cómo reaccionaría el príncipe Nuada ante su respuesta? ¿Cómo detenemos a las Sombras?- preguntó la princesa intentando que su voz sonara firme sin temor. El príncipe Nuada pareció estar complácido con la actitud de la niña ya que al momento asintió con la cabeza. Debeís seguirme- dijo el príncipe. ¿A dónde?- preguntó Orara quien abrazo a la princesa al ver que estaba a salvo. ¿A dónde más?- el príncipe Nuada ni siquiera se giro a verlas- a dónde se encuentran las Sombras... a la tierra de los mortales... La princesa Orara no pudo evitar estremecerse un poco. Una brisa de aire nocturno alboroto su cabello, tal vez fue su imaginación, tal vez fue el miedo, lo cierto es que entre el susurro de la noche logró escuchar una voz que le llamaba, le llamaba con el nombre que creyó no volver a escuchar... \"Ofelia\" Continuara...[Chapter 3] 3 Ofelia... El nombre que la princesa Moanna recibió cuando era hija de hombre... Un nombre que la llenaba de recuerdos, de alegrías y de dolor. Recordar ese nombre era recordar a Mercedes, a su padre el sastre, a su madre Carmen, a sus libros de cuentos de hadas que tanto amaba; pero también era recordar cosas horribles como el hombre pálido, el miedo de la guerra, el dolor de las perdidas pero aun más terrible era recordar al capitán Vidal, solo recordarlo la princesa Moanna temblaba como una hoja en un día con mucho viento... ................................................... ¿A la tierra de los hombres?- preguntó la princesa Moanna, por más que lo intento su voz dejo traslucir un poco de ese miedo que sentía. El príncipe Nuada continuo subiendo los escalones de la fría escalera de piedra. No pretendo ir a las ciudades de los hombres- la voz del príncipe dejo traslucir su odio contra los hombres mortales- solamente utilizare uno de los pasajes del Fauno, vos debeís conocerlo, su alteza. Orara no dejaba de ver hacia atrás como si temiera que alguien en la penumbra les siguiera. Deja de hacer eso ninfa- dijo el hijo del rey Balor- nadie sabe que venís conmigo. Orara no estaba muy convencida. ..................................................... Llegaron a la parte alta de la escalera, y ahí la princesa Moanna se dio cuenta de que una vez más estaban en el fondo del pozo, en el centro del laberinto del fauno, cerca del molino, en el bosque donde ella había pasado sus últimos días mortales. La niña no pudo evitar pasar con cierta añoranza y tristeza la piedra donde en el centro del pozo se veía la imagen de el fauno, ella y su pequeño hermano. Orara también había reconocido el lugar, cómo olvidar los días y noches que había pasado transformada en un diminuto insecto junto al fauno en ese bosque esperando el regreso de su princesa. El príncipe Nuada no veía la piedra con la imagen de la princesa, él observaba con cierta tristeza la luna, como si pensara en alguien más. Pero cuando la princesa Moanna quiso decir algo él ya estaba revisando la escalera que subía a la superficie, al centro del laberinto. Pienso cortar camino- dijo sin ver a la princesa o a la ninfa- por el bosque. Orara estaba de pie junto a la princesa Moanna. ¡No puedo creer que lo hicieráis!- dijo una voz desde la oscuridad. Orara no pudo evitar bajar la vista como una niña que ha sido sorprendida haciendo una travesura. La princesa Moanna ya imaginaba que solamente era cuestión de tiempo para que la encontraran. El príncipe Nuada había levantado su lanza ante un posible ataque, pero solo ver que se trataba del fauno con su bolsa de madera al cinto la bajo como si no temiera ningún peligro. Fauno por favor no os enojéis- dijo la niña- fue mi culpa, no quería preocuparos, pero debía hacer algo, el príncipe dice que las sombras. Habeís desobedecido a vuestro padre- dijo el fauno arrugando la nariz. La princesa Moanna bajo la vista, una vez más sus hermosos ojos se toparon con sus zapatos rojos. El fauno dio un resoplido que a la princesa le recordo el sonido que hacen las cabras al estar molestas. En ese caso debere acompañaros- dijo el fauno dejando salir a sus hadas. La princesa Moanna no pudo evitar sonreir abiertamente cuando vio ese brillo en los ojos azulados del fauno, la niña corrió hacia él abrazándolo con fuerza, el fauno regresó el abrazo mientras cerraba los ojos y apoyaba su cabeza en el cabello de la princesa respirando su perfume. En ese caso adelante- dijo el príncipe Nuada- no podemos perder más tiempo. ........................................................................................................ El príncipe Nuada iba a la cabeza, el fauno le seguía, la princesa Moanna iba agarrada de su mano subiendo detrás de él los escalones, Orara cerraba la comitiva, la ninfa no se había equivocado, esa sensación de que los seguían era el fauno, por una parte eso la relajo, por otra no pudo evitar preguntarse si el rey de Bezmorra lo habría mandado para cuidar a su hija. ¿Sabrá el rey lo que planea la princesa Moanna?- se preguntó en silencio Orara. Afuera, bajo el pálido resplandor de la luna, el centro del laberinto parecía no haber cambiado, no se veía que el tiempo le hubiera afectado después de que los rebeldes se llevaran de ahí el cuerpo mortal de la princesa. La princesa Moanna pareció estremecerse por un momento al recordar lo que había pasado esa noche cuando los rebeldes tomaron el molino. El fauno puso su mano sobre el hombro de la niña para inspirarle confianza, la princesa Moanna respiro el perfume del fauno, era como oler tierra mojada, como oler la tierra del monte, al momento continuo su camino. El príncipe Nuada parecía conocer el camino que debían seguir para salir del laberinto, el fauno dejo que sus hadas bailaran sobre las cabezas de la niña y la ninfa mientras la luna era la única que les alumbraba el camino al exterior del laberinto. Por fin después de pasar por los corredores de ese laberinto de roca, el exterior les saludo, con los sonidos nocturnos del bosque. Caminaremos hacia el bosque- dijo el príncipe Nuada. El fauno no pudo evitar mover sus largos dedos frente al rostro del hijo del rey de los elfos. Es evidente- dijo el fauno con esa voz que tanto gustaba a la princesa Moanna- que el hijo de la tierra- dijo un balido- conoce bien los caminos que debe seguir en la tierra de los hombres. Fauno- el príncipe Nuada se detuvo girando hacia el fauno- debeís recordar que los hombres en su ambición nos relegaron a los bosques, a mi pueblo, a mi familia, no frecuentare una ciudad de hombres, es mejor seguir el camino del bosque. Y eso servirá- dijo el fauno sin alterarse- para que si hay alguna Sombra nos encuentre y... El príncipe Nuada se sonrió. Eres muy inteligente fauno- dijo el príncipe- también tenía contemplado eso... y es la única forma de tener información. \"Carnada\" pensó Orara. ¿Pensaís utilizarnos como carnada?- dijo la ninfa protegiendo con sus brazos a la princesa Moanna. No temáis ninfa- dijo el príncipe- no le pasara nada a vuestra princesa... Antes de que la princesa Moanna pudiera dar su opinión al respecto un ruido los hizo callar, al parecer alguien los estaba observando entre los árboles y en un descuido había roto una rama delatando donde se encontraba. No tuvimos que esperar tanto- dijo el fauno colocándose frente a la princesa Moanna y Orara. El príncipe Nuada hizo que su lanza se alargara. No temáis princesa- dijo el príncipe- aun no nace quien pueda derrotarme... Continuara...[Chapter 4] 4 La princesa Moanna tuvo algo de miedo al ver la lanza del príncipe Nuada, sin entender bien el por qué, esa arma le recordaba la daga que el Fauno le mostrara, la daga de su última prueba antes de regresar al reino de su padre. Buscando protección la niña se abrazó al Fauno, esté la cubrió entre sus brazos. El príncipe Nuada se lanzó al momento contra un enemigo que la princesa Moanna aun no veía, desafortunadamente la princesa del reino subterráneo no pudo apreciar la maestría de los ataques del príncipe de tez páida ya que el Fauno cubrió la cara de la niña con sus finos dedos para que no viera el enfrentamiento. Aun así la princesa escuchaba el chocar de las armas, los pasos sobre la hierba como si de una danza mortal se tratara, podía escuchar la respiración del hijo del rey Balor, tranquila a pesar del peligro. \"Aun no ha nacido el que pueda derrotarme\" había dicho el príncipe ¿sería cierto? la princesa Moanna pedía en silencio el príncipe no resultara lastimado. Parecía que había pasado una eternidad entre el escuchar el choque de la lanza y la otra arma y escuchar los latidos del propio corazón de la princesa cuando de pronto se hizo el silencio. ......................................................................... ¿Mirad qué tenemos aquí?- dijo el príncipe Nuada. La princesa Moanna suspiro aliviada, no parecía que el príncipe estuviera lastimado. Bajo la lanza del hijo de la Tierra estaba de espalda al suelo una figura envuelta en una capa con capucha completamente cubierta de pies a cabeza, la princesa no sabía de quién podía tratarse; con un rápido movimiento el príncipe Nuada hizo que la capucha cayera hacia atrás. La hija del rey de Bezmorra nunca había visto a alguien igual. Se trataba de aparentemente un hombre joven, de cabello negro como el ébano que caía hasta los hombros en finas ondulaciones, los ojos eran pálidos como dos lunas grises, y la tez era pálida como el príncipe Nuada; pero, como si se tratara del resplandor de la luna. Su rostro era noble, aunque ligeramente unas ojeras surcaban esos hermosos ojos. Es una pálida sombra- dijo el Fauno mientras la princesa se separaba un poco de él- tal vez un explorador. ¿Cuál es tu nombre?- preguntó la princesa. La sombra no contestó. ¿Preferís que mi lanza os haga hablar?- el príncipe Nuada no era muy paciente. La princesa Moanna temió por la vida de esa criatura. Esperad, tal vez tiene miedo- dijo la niña caminando un poco hacia la Sombra. Una sombra NUNCA tiene miedo- contestó la Sombra. Cómo te atreves a tal irreverencia- la lanza del príncipe tocaba el pálido cuello de la Sombra. No- dijo la niña acercándose- no le hagaís daño. ¿Cómo puede- comenzó la sombra mostrando algo de desconfianza- una hija de hombre estar acompañada de elementales? ¿Hija de hombre? Esa Sombra no había reconocido a la princesa Moanna. Mi nombre es Ofelia- dijo la niña sin mostrar su sorpresa- he conocido al fauno en su laberinto, ella es Orara, es una ninfa, y él- hizo una reverencia al príncipe Nuada- es el príncipe Nuada... Conozco al príncipe Nuada, lanza de plata, hijo del rey Balor del reino de Bethmoora- dijo la Sombra con una voz que recordaba el murmullo del viento entre los árboles en una noche de luna llena- y al fauno del reino subterráneo de Bezmorra; pero ¿cómo es que una niña puede estar con ellos? Eso no te concierne- dijo el príncipe Nuada- ahora ¿qué es lo que están planeando las Sombras? Se hizo un incómodo silencio. Contesta- sugirió el Fauno- vuestra alteza no es paciente. Las Sombras seguimos al Maestro, siempre debe haber un maestro- comenzó la sombra- ¿puedo levantarme antes de continuar? Ofelia dirigió una mirada suplicante al príncipe Nuada. Nada de trucos, Sombra- dijo el príncipe dándole un poco de espacio. La Sombra se sentó sobre la hierba. Siempre debe haber un maestro- continuó- pero ahora, nuestro maestro ha muerto, no tenemos líder... solamente un usurpador; se ha llamado así mismo maestro y ha declarado la guerra contra el reino de Bethmoora y el reino subtérraneo de Bezmorra. ¿Por qué?- preguntó Ofelia Por la ambición de poder- la Sombra levantó su vista para toparse con los bonitos ojos de la princesita-desea no ser solo maestro de sombras sino también señor de ambos reinos y poder recuperar lo que ha perdido... ¿Y qué ha perdido?- preguntó el Fauno aunque Ofelia sintió que él ya conocía la respuesta. Ha perdido el cinturon del antiguo maestro- parecía que la Sombra no estaba conforme con las acciones de quién hablaba- los hombres se lo han quitado y cómo teme a los hombres por eso ha preferido ganar poder controlando ambos reinos y después poder lanzar a mis hermanos y a mi contra los hombres mortales condenados a morir para poder recuperar el cinturón. Debemos detenerle- dijo Orara. ¿Y qué podeís hacer un fauno, una ninfa, una hija de hombres y un príncipe elfo contra todo un ejército de sombras?- preguntó el joven. Si he podido contigo, tu \"Maestro\"- dijo el príncipe- no me causará ningún problema... No deseo ayudar a los hombres, por mi que tu raza les destruya; pero, no dejaré que se metan con mi gente o con el reino subtérraneo. La Sombra se sonrió. En ese caso, no tengo por qué informar a los demás centinelas sobre lo que me he encontrado esta noche- dijo la Sombra poniéndose de pie. Tenemos que recuperar ese cinturón- dijo Ofelia. Pequeña Ofelia...- dijo la Sombra Ofelia- intervinó el fauno antes de que la sombra pudiera continuar- conoce muy bien a los hombres, así que podrá ayudarnos. La Sombra pareció inspeccionar de pies a cabeza a la princesa Moanna. En ese caso, si no tiene miedo, seguidme- dijo la Sombra. ¿Y cuál es vuestro nombre?- preguntó Orara. Mi nombre es Zathary- dijo la Sombra. ¿Zathary?- Ofelia nunca había escuchado un nombre como ese. Lo sé, Zathary es nombre de chica- dijo la Sombra- pero qué queréis- dijo encogiéndose de hombros- es el nombre que me han dado... Continuara...[Chapter 5] 5 Ofelia recordó su vida con los hombres mortales como si se tratara de un sueño lejano, su madre, su padre el sastre, Mercedes, al doctor, y como una pesadilla regresó el recuerdo del terrible capitán Vidal, el miedo de estar encerrada en el molino, la última noche antes de regresar al reino de su padre... ¿Estás bien, Ofelia?- preguntó Zathary. La niña sacudió la cabeza intentando alejar los malos recuerdos. Sí- afirmó con una sonrisa- solamente estaba recordando algo. Zathary los había llevado hasta un cuartel de hombres cerca de las vías del ferrocarril. Con mucho cuidado pasaron entre la locomotora y unos carros de carga que estaban en las vías. Esas bestias de metal- dijo la sombra- son tan terribles como el ejército dorado. Sombra- dijo el príncipe Nuada- no tienes idea de que es tratar con el ejército dorado. Shhhh- Orara se llevó los dedos a los labios. Dos hombres vestidos con trajes militares pasaron haciendo su ronda nocturna muy cerca de ellos. El fauno y Orara cubrieron a la princesa Moanna para que las sombras los ocultaran, el príncipe Nuada tenía lista su lanza por si acaso, Zathary había desaparecido. Los hombres no los vieron y continuaron su camino. El príncipe Nuada revisó que no hubiera algún otro peligro. Esa sombra escapó- dijo molestó. Yo no he escapado- Zathary salió de las sombras, era como si se hubiera vuelto uno con ellas- además no tengo por qué hacerlo. Pensé que tú también temías a los hombres- retó el príncipe Nuada. Las Sombras tememos a los hombres, cierto- dijo Zathary- pero por recuperar el cinturón del maestro, venceré mi miedo... Ofelia también salió de su escondite. ¿Dónde tienen el cinturón?- preguntó la niña. Ahí- Zathary señaló el cuartel. ¿Cómo entraremos?- Ofelia esperaba no tuvieran que enfrentarse a esos hombres que le recordaban tanto al capitán Vidal. Para eso- hablo el Fauno atrayendo la atención de la niña- necesitaréis tiza. Entre los finos dedos el Fauno le mostraba una tiza blanca, Ofelia se sonrió. No debéis ir sola- dijo Orara preocupada- os acompañaré. No, iré yo- dijo Zathary Yo también iré- dijo el príncipe Nuada. Ofelia se sonrió mientras marcaba con su tiza una puerta en una caja de madera que encontró junto a uno de los carros de carga. ........................................................................................... Debía agradecer las veces que la tiza la había salvado, del hombre pálido, del capitán Vidal, sí, Ofelia le debía mucho a una simple tiza. El bloque de piedra se abrió como si fuera una puerta. El primero en salir fue el príncipe Nuada, la puerta daba a un corredor sin ninguna luz. El hijo del rey Balor hizo una seña para que lo siguieran. Ofelia salió aun con la tiza en la mano. Zathary fue el último en salir. ¿No se cerrará?- preguntó viendo el pequeño bloque en la pared. Tenemos tiempo hasta que la arena en el reloj del Fauno se termine- dijo la niña- ¿ahora dónde buscar? Podríamos dividirnos- sugirió Zathary. Yo iré con la niña- dijo el príncipe Nuada, su lanza guardada a la espalda. Sois muy desconfiado, alteza- dijo la sombra. Bien, si quieres que la niña vaya contigo- el príncipe Nuada no espero respuesta y comenzó a andar por un extremo del corredor- pero si le haces algo- dijo antes de bajar unas escaleras- te arrepentiras... Zathary se sonrió. Tranquila- le dijo a Ofelia- no pienso hacerte nada ¿me ayudas a buscar el cinturón? Ofelia asintió, esa sombra no le daba miedo. .......................................................................................... Ofelia abrió con cuidado otra puerta, al igual que las últimas cinco tampoco había nada adentro. Zathary aparecía y desaparecía entre las sombras. Aquí no hay nada- dijo la sombra desilucionada. No te rindas- dijo Ofelia pasando su mano por el brazo de la sombra- lo encontraremos ¿quién puede tenerlo? Lo desconozco- dijo Zathary mirando con esos ojos tan enigmáticos a la niña- sólo sé que los hombres tienen el cinturón... Un murmullo de voces llegó hacia ellos, no había donde pudieran esconderse. Antes de que Ofelia pudiera hacer algo Zathary la protegió entre sus brazos mientras se fundía una vez más con las sombras. ............................................................................................ El príncipe Nuada tampoco había tenido suerte, ninguno de esos hombres parecía tener el cinturón que la sombra estaba buscando. ¿Habéis tenido suerte?- preguntaron de pronto detrás de él. Zathary apareció con la princesa Moanna. Aquí no está- dijo el príncipe elfo- ¿no será una broma de tu parte, sombra? Zathary negó con la cabeza. No juego con estas cosas- dijo muy serio- el cinturón del maestro es muy importante como para bromear con él. Al parecer de nuevo iban a discutir, Ofelia iba a decirles que se calmaran cuando pasó... ¡Alto ahí!- gritó una voz de hombre. Se habían distraido y ahora un soldado los había encontrado. Ofelia tuvo miedo, sabía lo que esos hombres podían hacer. Antes de que la niña pudiera hacer algo el príncipe Nuada y la sombra ya habían sacado sus propias armas, Ofelia tuvo miedo ¿podría detener una lanza o una espada una pistola? El príncipe Nuada se lanzó contra el soldado, el pobre hombre no tuvo oportunidad. La pequeña princesa dio un grito de miedo cuando vio caer al hombre muerto. Regresen a la puerta- ordenó el príncipe Nuada. Más voces de hombres se escuchaban cada vez más cerca, habían escuchado a su compañero y ahora iban por ellos. Necesitaréis apoyo- dijo Zathary. Ofelia te necesita- dijo el príncipe Nuada caminando hacia los hombres que llegaban. ............................................................................................ Zathary no tuvo otra opción, abrió una puerta de una habitación sin saber si estaba o no ocupada y empujó a la niña al interior cerrando la puerta, el príncipe Nuada era bueno con la lanza pero llegaban y llegaban hombres que le cerraban cada vez más el paso, las escaleras estaban llenas de hombres armados. Te dije que te fueras- dijo el príncipe Nuada tan orgulloso como siempre. La niña está bien, creo- dijo la sombra dando apoyo al hijo de la tierra. .............................................................................................. Ofelia intentó abrir la puerta, pero ésta se había trabado. La niña solo escuchaba como afuera sus dos amigos estaban peleando, de pronto tuvo miedo ¿y si la arena ya se había acabado? Estarían encerrados en ese lugar. Sin darse cuenta la pequeña pegó su espalda a un escritorio y un libro cayó al piso, el lugar estaba a oscuras y ella no sabía de que se podía tratar, en ese momento escuchó un ligero gemido. Oh no- musitó mientras buscaba entre su ropa la tiza. Por fin la encontró después de lo que sintió una eternidad, con mano temblorosa marco otra puerta junto a la puerta cerrada, cuando la tuvo lista empujó con todas sus fuerzas. ............................................................................................. No podía creerlo, en el pasillo los soldados continuaban cerrándole el paso a sus amigos, pero Zathary parecía estar herido, el príncipe Nuada se encargaba de detenerlos lo mejor que podía pero parecía estaban en serios problemas. Debemos salir de aquí- dijo la niña poniéndose junto a ellos pese al peligro. ¿Y cómo se supone que nos replegaremos?- preguntó el príncipe Nuada aun atacando con su lanza. Zathary hizo una mueca de dolor, sujetó con un brazo a la niña y con la mano libre tomó por el hombro al príncipe, una vez hecho esto los jaló con él hacia las sombras. Como si sólo hubieran cerrado y abierto los ojos los tres se encontraron en el corredor que daba a la puerta de tiza, está lentamente comenzaba a cerrarse. Rápido, rápido- ordenó el príncipe Nuada. Ofelia corría más deprisa que ellos y llegó primero a la puerta, el príncipe Nuada lanzó a Zathary al hueco en la pared, la princesa Moanna no pudo evitar gritar cuando el bloque de piedra se cerró. El príncipe Nuada estaba atrapado. Continuara...[Chapter 6] 6 Ofelia golpeaba con todas sus fuerzas la caja de madera, sabía muy bien que una vez que se cerraba el pasaje ya no era posible volver a entrar por esa ruta. ¿Qué pasó?- preguntó Orara solo ver las lágrimas de la niña El príncipe Nuada- dijo la princesa aun golpeando la madera. Necesitará una distracción- dijo el fauno después de haber visto a Zathary- Orara vos podeís hacerlo. ¿Yo? Pero Fauno sólo soy una ninfa- dijo Orara sin saber como podía ayudar. Una ninfa puede pedir ayuda a las aguas ¿estoy en lo correcto?- el Fauno movía una vez más de esa manera hipnótica sus largos dedos. Orara levano la vista, muy cerca del cuartel había un enorme contenedor metálico lleno de agua. Tal vez pueda funcionar- se dijo Orara mientras cerraba los ojos apretando los párpados con fuerza, había estirado su mano como si llamara a alguien- vamos, vamos, que funcione, por favor, os lo ruego, os lo ruego... Ofelia limpiaba sus lágrimas cuando escuchó como el contenedor se desplomó derramando toda el agua que tenía en su interior, el cuartel de los hombres se llenó completamente de agua que entraba por ventanas y puertas, los hombres que aun seguían en pie fueron arrojados al exterior por la fuerza del agua, todo fue confusión en todo momento. Del príncipe Nuada no había ninguna señal. ........................................................... ¿Habrá funcionado?- preguntó Orara cuando el agua dejó de escurrir entre los restos de metal. Lo habéis hecho bien- dijo el Fauno. La princesa Moanna y el Fauno revisaban a la sombra. No era necesario gastar tanta agua, ninfa- dijo una voz a espaldas de Orara. La pobre ninfa no pudo evitar dar un ligero salto de miedo, detrás de ella estaba el príncipe Nuada parecía estar bien aunque completamente empapado. Estaba a punto de salir de ahí, no necesitaba ayuda- dijo el príncipe. Orara lo tomó como su forma de decir gracias. Lo mejor será movernos de aquí- dijo el hijo del rey de los elfos Pero ¿Zathary?- preguntó la princesa Moanna separándose de la sombra. Esta herido por su culpa, lo mejor será dejarle- dijo el príncipe Nuada sin mirar a la niña. No- dijo la princesa Moanna con una determinación que sorprendió al hijo del rey Balor- no abandonaremos a nadie. Excelente decisión, su alteza- dijo el Fauno. Al momento en que Ofelia giró para ver al Fauno no pudo evitar sorprenderse, una vez más estaban en la parte central del laberinto del Fauno. ................................................. No me gusta el aspecto de la herida- dijo Orara junto al Fauno. Zathary parecía estar dormido aunque respiraba con dificultad. Debemos encontrar la forma de ayudarle- dijo la princesa Moanna. El Fauno y Orara continuaban hablando, el príncipe Nuada estaba sentad sobre el alto muro de piedra del laberinto como si todo lo que estaba pasando abajo de él le fuera indiferente. Ofelia se acercó a Zathary. Te pondrás bien- le dijo dulcemente- encontraremos tu cinturón ya lo verás. He sido un ciego- dijo la sombra débilmente- princesa Moanna... ¿Cómo te diste cuenta?- Ofelia paso un paño mojado por la frente caliente de la sombra. Por vuestros zapatos- bromeó Zathary. Ofelia sonrió, después de unos minutos Zathary volvió a quedarse dormido. .................................................................. ¿Hay alguna forma de ayudarle?- preguntó la niña al Fauno. La hay, su alteza- dijo el Fauno con unas de sus hadas revoloteando por su cabeza. Decídmela Fauno, por favor- imploró la niña. Será peligroso, su alteza- el Fauno la invitó a acercarse a él- deberéis visitar a un desagradable conocido, a una peligrosa criatura una vez más... La princesa Moanna sintió un escalofrío ¿no se referiría el Fauno a...? El hombre Pálido guarda entre los manjares de su mesa una fruta del color del fuego- explicó el Fauno- con ella podéis preparar el élixir necesario para salvar a la Sombra... pero ya sabéis que él no comparte nada de su mesa, y que si tocáis la más mínima uva esa criatura os devorará y él ya os conoce su alteza... Ofelia sintió mucho miedo de volver a enfrentar al Hombre Pálido no había criatura más horrible en todo el mundo, bueno solamente ella y el capitán Vidal, tal vez; pero, si no lo hacía Zathary no se salvaría, y si no recuperaban el cinturón de las Sombras, los reinos de Bethmoora y Bezmorra serían destruidos. Lo haré- dijo la niña. Así sea, princesa- dijo el Fauno. No es correcto que vayas- dijo el príncipe Nuada de pronto. Ofelia no lo había visto desde hacía un rato, al parecer había escuchado todo. Debo hacerlo, debemos encontrar el cinturón- dijo la niña Los hombres no lo tenían en ese lugar. Ofelia sacó el libro que había traído del cuartel de los hombres. Aquí dice que uno de sus capitanes lo tiene, al parecer es su diario- la princesa Moanna le enseñaba una hoja en particular al príncipe Nuada- debió estar fuera y ahora que regrese y vea lo que le hicimos a su cuartel no va a estar contento, necesitaremos la ayuda de Zathary. El príncipe Nuada no contestó nada, era más que obvio que no lograría hacer cambiar de opinión a la niña. ...................................................... Zathary- musitó Ofelia. La Sombra abrió los ojos, se veía muy cansado. Resiste, cuando regrese te pondrás bien- dijo la niña. Zathary intentó sonreirle pero no lo logró, una vez más volvió a cerrar los ojos. ....................................................... El Fauno dice que tendréis que ir sola- dijo Orara mientras la niña dibujaba otra puerta en una de las paredes del laberinto. Regresare, tranquila- dijo Ofelia terminando la puerta. Una hada de color rojo voló sobre la cabeza de Orara. Princesa, esta hada insiste en acompañaros- dijo la ninfa mientras la pequeña hada se posaba sobre su dedo- no se marchará de aquí hasta que consiga... De acuerdo- Ofelia giró el reloj de arena y la puerta en la pared se abrió mostrando un corredor que ella conocía muy bien- ven pequeña, debemos apresurarnos... Orara se sentó en el suelo a esperar el regreso de la niña. Continuara...[Chapter 7] 7 El hombre pálido, la pequeña Ofelia no había podido olvidar a ese terrible ser. Mientras la pequeña caminaba por esos corredores con los altos pilares a todo lo largo no podía dejar de pensar en la primera vez que se topó con esa criatura. No comais ni bebais nada- había dicho el fauno en esa ocasión. Ahora, Ofelia iba con la clara intención de desobedecer esa orden, era la única forma de salvar a Zathary. ......................................................................................................... Una vez más ahí frente a ella estaba la mesa del Hombre Pálido, repleta de manjares para tentar a los niños, en una esquina todos los pares de zapatos viejos de todos esos pequeños infantes que ese monstruo había devorado por años. ¿Dónde estaba el Hombre Pálido?- no pudo evitar preguntarse en voz alta la princesa Moanna. La silla a la cabecera de la mesa estaba vacía, no había rastro del cruel monstruo por ninguna parte. En ese momento la niña tuvo miedo, no lo había visto por el corredor que había tomado y tampoco lo había escuchado en ningún momento. El hada de color rojo revoloteó por todas partes intentando encontrarle pero fue inútil, era como si en ese momento el cruel Hombre Pálido no se encontrara. Debemos apresurarnos- dijo la princesa Moanna acercándose a la mesa- el Fauno dijo que era una fruta del color del fuego. Entre los platillos y platillos que había en la mesa del Hombre Pálido había infinidad de frutas que tenían un color rojo encendido ¿cómo saber cuál era la fruta del color del fuego que necesitaban? El hada de color rojo no dejaba de volar sobre la cabeza de la princesa mientras ésta buscaba, así si el Hombre Pálido llegaba no tomara por sorpresa a la niña. ........................................................................................................... ¡Esta debe ser!- dijo feliz Ofelia. Una vez más algo muy dentro de ella le había dicho cual era la fruta, fue como en aquella ocasión cuando debía encontrar donde estaba escondida la daga. La niña tomó con mucho cuidado una pequeña fruta del tamaño de una ciruela, era la que tenía el color rojo más encendido de todas. Solo tomarla entre sus manos, Ofelia sintió como esa pequeña fruta estaba tibia. \"El color del fuego\" Pensó la princesa Moanna mientras guardaba con mucho cuidado la pequeña fruta en una bolsa de su vestido. Debemos irnos- le dijo al hada alejándose de la mesa. Como lo había esperado la princesa, solamente tomar la fruta se escuchó un largo y aterrador gemido. El Hombre Pálido estaba cerca. ............................................................................................................. Sin esperar a que ese monstruo se presentara ante ella Ofelia comenzó a correr lo más rápido que podía, solamente pasar por el primer pilar algo muy extraño pasó. Las luces se apagaron sin previo aviso. La princesa Moanna se detuvo de golpe. ¡No podía ver nada frente a ella! En ese momento el gemido lastimero del Hombre Pálido se escuchó más cercano. ¡Se estaba acercando! ¿A dónde correr? Ofelia no sabía si iba hacia adelante o hacia atrás. De pronto el hada de color rojo comenzó a brillar como si de una antorcha se tratara. Ofelia agradeció en silencio que esa pequeñita estuviera con ella, utilizándola como guía la niña comenzó a correr a toda velocidad, detrás de ella podía escuchar el arrastrar de los pies del Hombre Pálido. Pese a su miedo, la princesa Moanna nunca giró para ver que tan lejos estaba esa cruel criatura de ella. ................................................................................................................ Por fin habían llegado a la parte más alejada de ese solitario pasillo por el que corrían. No es posible- dijo Ofelia golpeando con sus manos la fría pared, la puerta que había dibujado se había cerrado, ¿cómo iban a salir de ese horrible lugar? En ese momento una mano pálida la sujeto por la muñeca, la niña gritó de terror podía sentir el párpado del Hombre Palido cerrandose en la palma de la mano del monstruo. El hada revoloteó con fuerza sobre la cabeza de la princesa mientras se lanzaba contra la cara sin ojos del monstruo. Éste sin soltar a la princesa Moanna trato de quitarse de la cara a esa molesta hada pero al no poder ver no lo conseguía. En un momento dado mientras Ofelia intentaba liberarse del agarre de esa criatura ciega el monstruo apretó con tal fuerza la muñeca de la niña que ésta no pudo evitar gritar de dolor. El hada pareció incendiarse mientras se lanzaba una vez más contra la cara del Hombre Pálido, éste la atrapó con la mano libre solamente para quemarse el ojo que parpadeaba en su palma. El hombre Pálido abrió la boca dando un grito de dolor, el hada aun presa entre sus dedos parecía quemarle la blanca piel. Ofelia no podía liberarse por más que lo intentaba. El Hombre Pálido pese al dolor apretó con todas sus fuerzas al hada quien comenzó a retorcerse de dolor entre la mano quemada de la ciega criatura. Con un brusco movimiento el Hombre Pálido lanzó a la pequeña hada de color rojo contra el suelo, la pequeña se golpeó con tal fuerza que se quedó tirada sin reaccionar. El leve resplandor del hada aun iluminaba la obscuridad del corredor. Ofelia ahora estaba atrapada por ambas muñecas, el Hombre Pálido la levanto un poco del suelo ¡La boca del Hombre Pálido se acercaba peligrosamente al blanco brazo de Ofelia! ¡Va a morderme!- se dijo la princesa intentando liberarse. Ya podía sentir el aliento de la criatura, iba a devorarla ¡como a los otros niños! .................................................................................................................. La pequeña princesa no podía alejar su mirada de la boca del Hombre Pálido, no había salida, ese monstruo iba a comérsela. De pronto el Hombre Pálido la soltó ¿qué había pasado? Ofelia cayó al suelo, al momento levantó la vista. En el techo se había abierto una puerta, el Hombre Pálido había retrocedido al sentir sobre él la desconcertante luz del exterior. ¿Otra puerta? Ofelia se preguntó mientras tomaba al hada entre sus manos. ¡Princesa vuestra mano!- gritaron de pronto. El príncipe Nuada se asomó por el espacio abierto en el techo hasta medio cuerpo ofreciendo su mano a la princesa Moanna. La pequeña se estiró lo más que pudo para alcanzarlo. Antes de que el Hombre Pálido pudiera evitarlo, el príncipe Nuada ya había levantado a la niña hasta él para acto seguido cerrarse la puerta en el techo. Una vez más Ofelia había escapado del monstruo devorador de niños inocentes. ............................................................................. El corazón de la princesa Moanna palpitaba con fuerza, había escapado del Hombre Pálido, aun tenía el hada de color rojo entre sus manos y la fruta del color del fuego en su vestido. El príncipe Nuada la había jalado hacia él tan deprisa que solamente cerrarse la puerta en el techo cayó de sentón en el piso con la princesa entre sus brazos. La niña no pudo evitar apoyar su cabeza contra el pecho del príncipe de los elfos. Gracias- musitó Ofelia. El príncipe Nuada no contestó. Continuara...[Chapter 8] 8 ¡Lo habéis conseguido!- celebró el Fauno mientras tomaba la fruta color del fuego que la princesa Moanna le entregaba. ¿Con esto podrás salvar a Zathary?- preguntó Ofelia El Fauno no contestó, estaba más ocupado machacando la fruta con uno de sus largos dedos mientras Orara aplicaba un nuevo paño húmedo en la frente de la Sombra. … El príncipe Nuada no había dicho nada desde que salvara en último momento a Ofelia del Hombre Pálido. La princesa Moanna lo había visto sentado en una piedra con moho en la base justo a la entrada del laberinto. Una vez más se encontraba mirando la luna ¿Por qué observaría la luna con tanta añoranza? Se preguntaba Ofelia. Sin hacer ruido la niña se acercó hasta donde él estaba. Sois muy valiente- musitó el hijo del rey Balor. Al parecer Ofelia no había sido tan silenciosa como imaginaba. Recuperaremos el cinturón de las Sombras y evitaremos una guerra entre nuestros reinos- se animó a hablar la pequeña niña. El príncipe Nuada no dijo nada más. La princesa Moanna se sonrió débilmente, le había parecido que esa era la manera en que el príncipe del país de los elfos decía \"Sí, tienes razón\" justo cuando estaba a punto de volver al interior del laberinto reparó en que el príncipe tenía un ligero corte en el brazo, su ropa estaba manchada con sangre. Estáis herido- musitó Ofelia mientras rasgaba la parte baja de su vestido. Es solo un corte… pero me temo- dijo el príncipe mientras la princesita le vendaba- alguien más sufrirá por ella… La princesa Moanna no entendió muy bien a quien se refería el príncipe Nuada, tal vez se trataba de alguien al que él quería mucho, tal vez tenía relación con ver la luna con tanta añoranza… La hija del rey de Bezmorra paso tímidamente su manita por el brazo del príncipe, el hijo del rey Balor se giro ligeramente para mirarla directamente a los ojos, las pupilas ámbar y las cafés de la princesa se toparon por un segundo. El príncipe Nuada ya no se veía tan amenazante. Lamento interrumpir- llamaron de pronto. La princesa Moanna se giro para ver a Orara. El Fauno os llama, princesa- informó la ninfa mirando con recelo al príncipe Nuada. Ofelia asintió mientras se alejaba con dirección al centro del laberinto. Nuada una vez más observaba sin parpadear la luna. … ¿Ocurre algo, Fauno?- preguntó Ofelia temiendo lo peor. Todo lo contrario, princesa- sonrió el Fauno. Zathary estaba apoyado contra la pared, por fin se veía mejor aunque parecía cansado. ¡Estáis bien!- la princesa corrió hacia él para abrazarlo. La Sombra dio un ligero quejido de dolor pero soporto el abrazo de la niña. Gracias a vos- dijo con una sonrisa- Os debo mi vida. Habrías hecho lo mismo por mi- contestó Ofelia al soltarlo- Tenemos que recuperar el cinturón. Zathary asintió. Y lo haremos- intervinó el Fauno- pero… tanto la Sombra como las princesas deben dormir. ¿Dormir?- replicaron Zathary y Ofelia. Claro, debéis reponer fuerzas- sonrió el Fauno y ante tal sonrisa ambos supieron que no podían salvarse de esa. ¿Pero y la luz del día?- intentó protestar la princesa Moanna ¿Y el avance de las Sombras?- protestó a su vez Zathary. Todo estará bien- apareció Orara- yo os avisare cuando debéis levantaros, ahora a descansar… Ofelia se acurrucó junto a la Sombra, él apoyó su cabeza entre la cabellera café de la princesa. La princesita comenzó a tararear la nana que Mercedes le cantara cuando se encontraba en el molino. Era un melodía preciosa, la niña tenía una voz preciosa, tal vez la nana no tuviera letra, pero era un arrullo tan tierno y suave que no lo necesitaba. Zathary sonrió como no hacía desde no recordaba cuándo, era como si la nana de Ofelia le hablara de un recuerdo lejano, de esos sueños que olvidamos antes de despertar pero que al abrir los ojos nos dejan en la cara una tierna sonrisa. Sí, la nana de la princesa Moanna decía todo sin palabras. Lentamente Zathary comenzó a sentirse somnoliento… Gracias- musitó antes de quedarse dormido Solo fue cuestión de segundos después de que la Sombra cayera rendida ante los brazos de Morfeo, también la princesa Moanna comenzó a sentirse cansada y aliviada a la vez, había logrado salvarse con ayuda del príncipe Nuada de la maldad del Hombre Pálido, había ayudado a salvar a Zathary y estaba segura, también conseguirían salvar a todos aquellos que amaban de la destrucción de los reinos que cada uno de ellos llamaba hogar. Lentamente también la pequeña se quedó completamente dormida mientras la misma sonrisa que se dibujara en el rostro de Zathary también apareciera en el de ella… Dormid bien su alteza- el Fauno le hizo una reverencia a su querida princesa Moanna. Desde la entrada del centro del laberinto el príncipe Nuada observaba la escena. La ternura de la niña le recordaba la ternura de su propia hermana, ambas se preocupaban por todos los seres que les rodeaban, ambas darían lo mejor de cada una de ellas en bien de los demás. Nuada levantó la vista al cielo como si el rostro de quien tanto añoraba le sonriera desde esa brillante luna. Sí, la princesa Moanna sería una gran monarca. Aun tenía muchas cosas que aprender, aun era pequeña, pero finalmente sería una gran reina, sería perfecta al igual que su propia hermana… Continuara…[Chapter 9] ¡Feliz Navidad y año Nuevo!
