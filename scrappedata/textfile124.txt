She time travels and can be much more versatile than always lugging Doc and Marty into the mix. September 20, 1955, Madison Trinity stepped up into the elevator of the small condo in Sherman Oaks she had rented last week. The time traveler had stowed her GTR in the small barn attached to the unit and she had also rented a small Ford T-bird in order to cruise around in. The corporation she worked for had granted her three weeks paid vacation time in any place and any time that she wanted to be in. With the loan of the GTR, Madison had chosen a time so she could be close to and even meet James Dean. The young woman had parked her loaner T-bird out in the driveway and hooked up the outside hose and water pump so she could wash the car. Grinning, she took her button up denim shirt off and knotted it around her waist, revealing her slim figure and a black bra. Admittedly there was an ulterior motive at play here; Madison had seen James drive in late last night and she was hoping he'd see her. Adjusting the nozzle on the hose, Madison made sure that the hood of the T-bird was up, then proceeded to blast the car with cold water. She put a little bit of car wash into a bucket, then she added the water, making it foam up and form suds. Madison put such energy and suggestive mannerisms into her carwashing that a passerby would have thought she was making a dirty porn film. Eventually she finished washing up the car and hosed down all the suds, leaving a brilliant gleam of freshly washed paint behind. \"Oh yeah!\" she remarked to herself. \"If cars were men, why I'd have them all.\" a true car fanatic, Madison loved super cars along with the GTR, the Audi R8, anything by Lamborghini and Ferrari. To her disappointment, James didn't come out of his house during her little act, but she hoped that he'd at least seen her. She chucked the sponge into the bucket, emptied the bucket, then went into the garage to put the items away. \"Fuck him anyway,\" Madison unknotted her shirt and went into the backyard where there was an inground pool. \"let's have some fun!\" she took a running jump into the pool and splashed around for awhile. That night, Madison was curled up on the couch enjoying a book of classic literature, the Three Musketeers, all ready for bed. It was a bit cool outside so she was wearing flannel pajama pants in a tartan design with a plain blue t-shirt underneath a purple terrycloth bathrobe. She turned a page idly, not wanting to interrupt the flow of the narrative when the doorbell rang. Madison glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece, indicating that it was quarter to eleven. \"Prowler?\" wary of doing anything to disrupt the space-time continuum, Madison picked up a baseball bat and peeked out of the window. \"Who is it?\" \"James Dean,\" a disgruntled voice replied. \"can I come in?\" Madison was inwardly happy but wary at the same time. James had a history of being moody and unpredictable so she wanted to make sure he knew where she drew the line. Unlocking and opening up the door, she admitted the young man in, drawing it shut and locking it back up tightly. \"Well, Mr. Dean,\" Madison flung her hair over her shoulder. She'd let it grow longer since she'd visited Doc and Marty and kind of enjoyed the flirtiness it afforded her. \"to what do I owe the visit at this late hour?\" James stumbled into her condo with a leering grin on his face, smelling of beer and gin, giving her a smirk as he sat down lopsidedly on a chair. One leg over one of the chair's arms, his head leaning back in the opposite direction. Madison looked mildly amused, but was very cautious. The rumors in her time was of him getting wasted and aggressive and she did not want it to come to that. As she watched, James belched loudly then tried to straighten up, but tripped over his own two feet. The drunken actor made his way over to her kitchen and began ransacking the fridge, pulling out little bits and stuffing his face. He reeked of gin and smoke, not to mention a faint hint of car exhaust. James had been out carousing and clubbing on his motorcycle as he liked to do. \"Think you're John Belushi, do you?\" Madison muttered, walking over. She snapped the bottle back from his hand, stuffed it into the fridge, then grabbed his left arm, wrapped it behind his back, then propelled him out into the living room. \"The hell?\" he slurred, turning to face her. \"Oh look, you can barely talk!\" Madison blustered. \"You come into my house like it's your own and you just make yourself at home, don't you?! If you want to freeload, go find some other poor sap! I don't take kindly to your type!\" James had the grace to look stunned at least. He wavered a bit on his feet but kept his balance properly. \"Who do you think you are, talking to m-me like that?\" \"A much better person than yourself.\" Madison kept her voice low to be intimidating, keeping her distance from the young actor. \"Now go sober up. If you want to be friends with me that's fine, but I prefer you remember it the next day.\" \"Do you k-know who I a-am?\" \"Indeed I do,\" Madison boldly approached him. \"a lonely lost boy looking for his own way in life, the product of a very inattentive father and a mother who died,\" James glared at her now, one hand twitching in an ominous way that Madison did not fail to notice. \"gotta drink now to cover up the loneliness? Perhaps you go out and pay your way in female company?\" The actor's eyes flared with anger and he lashed out in a right hook, which Madison caught with a smug smile. \"I've had self-defense training. Very useful in my line of work.\" she shoved him away. \"You bitch!\" he lurched at her again but Madison easily sidestepped the drunken hulk. While she was itching to get inside his pants, she was unwilling to take advantage of him while inebriated. \"Here's what I'm gonna do,\" she hiked him up by the shoulders and pinned him against the door. \"I'll let you off this one time. Next time I'm hauling your pitiful ass in and locking you in the drunk tank for a few hours. In the meantime...\" Madison locked lips with James, giving him a kiss. Spluttering when she released him, James looked at her like she had grown six heads. The time traveler opened up the front door and gestured for him to go. \"Camp out on my front lawn if you like, but don't come looking for me unless you sober up.\" Without another word, James walked out the door, still stunned from Madison kissing him. He leaned against the post of her covered porch and glanced back at the front door, tracing his lips with one finger. A faint smile played upon his lips as the lights went out and the house was silent. The actor trotted down the path, thinking that the night wasn't a total waste after all. With a sigh, Madison locked the door after shutting it, hoping that she had managed to get the drunken actor to see some sense at least. Madison had the biggest crush on him when she was growing up, she had several friends who had encouraged her interest in cars from a young age, then had gotten in with the time traveling agency she now worked for. Leaning with the back of her head against the door, Madison realized she had never in a million years dream that James Dean gave in to his insecurities and drink. Her dreams of him had been a wholesome rebel, still kindhearted and good to those that he liked. She didn't doubt the fact that the person she had envisioned was still there, just that she had to dig a little deeper to find it. Some had spoken of James being shy and a little standoffish around people that he didn't know. He had to warm up to her first. \"You're shattering my illusions, James.\" was all Madison said, heading over to the bedroom to turn in. The next day, Madison was sitting on the porch swing with a magazine in her hands, idly swinging back and forth with one foot, dressed in the period skirt, top and shoes. Having been used to her modern wear of jeans, sandals and camisole tops, Madison found the fifties era style very confining. She wore them because she did not want to stand out, but she didn't have to like it. Some women did wear pants but that was mostly around the house. It hadn't been an easy night for Madison after James's impromptu visit. She had tossed and turned for hours, her mind preoccupied with the object of her affections. She sighed, studying her nails which were painted a vibrant red. Across the road there was no sign of life at James's house at all, making Madison think that he had gone away for a bit. Often times she had dreamt of being James's rebound girl after Pier Angeli broke up with him. Madison would take him aside in her dreams, comfort him at any time if he needed it. She would be the mother figure he didn't have for long. The time traveler tried not to get close to people in periods that she visited, but Madison was a hardcore fan of James for many years. It would be a real trial for her not to get emotionally involved in the legend. \"Hi,\" she glanced up from her magazine to see James grinning at her from the porch steps, leaning on the railing. \"can I join you?\" Madison involuntarily started, having been lost in her ruminations so much that she'd never heard him approaching. \"Wow, you clean up well,\" Madison moved aside as he sat down next to her. \"leave your Mr. Hyde character in the shed until nightfall?\" James gave her a playful look, his blue eyes piercing into her dark ones. The look she'd seen a thousand times in photographs which always made her heart melt. Madison wanted to lift up her hand and put it to the side of his face, slowly dragging it down until he reached for it and kissed it, but with great effort she restrained herself. \"You're well read.\" he swatted at her foot which she didn't move, teasing him silently with it. James looked good to her eyes, tan chinos, blue button up shirt. The top two buttons were undone, making him look enticing to her eyes. Madison had played along a similar line, leaving her red button up shirt undone so he could get a glimpse of her bra. \"You don't expect us women to read?\" she pretended offense which James took literally as she dragged her leg off of the bench so he could relax. Madison reached over the porch railing and plucked a prairie rose from the bush nearby, putting it behind her right ear. James smiled at the young woman beside him, thinking that the color of the flower suited her. \"No, I mean that-\" \"No matter. Lots of men think I'm a brain dead jerk.\" Madison was indifferent to her past, forgetting that people of the fifties reacted differently to what she had just said. James's eyes went wider, shoving one hand into a pocket and bringing out a blue lighter. Uncomfortable now, he started toying with it, glad to have something to concentrate on. \"Then they're wrong.\" \"Thanks. I don't think we've properly met. Madison.\" \"James.\" he wrapped his arm around her shoulders and set the porch swing into motion, swinging one leg casually with the other one tucked up under him. \"Oh, I know. Seen you around in my wanderings.\" the time traveler replied, a complete lie if there ever was one. Her assignments had taken her to the distant future and past, but never to the fifties. Madison had a lot of love for the Victorian age and always requested assignments regarding that time frame. \"Really? I don't recall seeing you anywhere before.\" James frowned, foregoing mentioning the confrontation the night before to which Madison appreciated. \"Oh, I've only been in town for about a week. I've got about a week and a half to go then I'll be gone again.\" her next assignment was to the far future for several purposes. James seemed interested but he did not press her for any details. She would not have been able to give them to him even if she had been asked, as secrecy was paramount. \"Where do you go?\" \"Wherever my bosses tell me to go,\" she said mildly, choosing not to say when. \"Madrid, Asia, Tokyo, Italy..\" \"Sounds nice.\" the porch swing resumed motion as it had slowed to almost a complete stop. James put his foot in the floorboards and gave Madison a shy glance, prompting her to smile. \"It is. I love learning about other cultures. You?\" she took his hand in hers, inwardly seeing it was bigger than her small feminine hand. Madison decided to put a little flirty edge in her behavior, wondering how James would react. \"I'm mainly between Hollywood and New York.\" he took a moment to observe Madison's hand, very small with capable looking fingers. They were calloused more on the right side than the left, and there was a small first degree burn across the back of the right hand. \"I took gymnastics in New York. Nice place but I didn't want to live there.\" \"Why not?\" \"I don't like cities. I'm country bred.\" the time traveler was of a suburban background, not quite country but not city either. Her father hated cities and he wanted his children to grow up in a suburban atmosphere. \"Same. So what about you?\" \"What about me what?\" Madison wrapped one hand around the chain of the porch swing as she glanced over her shoulder to James. \"Any family? You married? Children?\" \"Nope. I travel a lot and though I've had relationships, they never work out. My last guy pal was an abusive jerk so I ditched him.\" \"Abusive?\" James faced her, his eyes narrowing in the sunshine. After their confrontation last night, Madison had asserted herself in front of him to him, and he hadn't dared cross that line again. She had an aura of complete self confidence that could send any person running for cover if they got on her bad side. \"He was controlling. Yelled at me if I went out without him, tried to hit me but I broke his arm.\" \"Way to go then.\" he started puffing on a cigarette. \"He didn't hurt you, did he?\" \"He cut me.\" \"What?\" \"The jerk cut me with his knife and I needed 4 stitches.\" Madison pulled up her left sleeve and showed him the scar. James glanced down at it and let out a whistle. \"Goddamn!\" he took a deep drag on his cigarette. \"For that one I broke his nose. You know those smokes are bad for you.\" \"Says who?\" \"Doctors.\" \"What do they know?\" \"More than you,\" Madison proclaimed. \"I studied medicine for awhile until I was picked for my current job and those cancer sticks bring on a nasty and painful death.\" \"Eh.\" James took a drag and exhaled slowly, making Madison think he was a human chimney. She blinked fast as the smoke got into her eyes and stung for a second. \"What brings you to my side of the street anyway, James? Guilt eating at you?\" \"Sort of,\" he admitted. \"I woke up this morning on my living room floor and remembered what I did last night. I want to apologize.\" \"It's OK. Don't do it again and I'll be happy.\" \"Just like that?\" James tossed away his stub and stared at her. \"Is it really that easy?\" \"What?\" she smirked. \"You expect me to make a scene? Want me to backhand you across the face for being such an ass? No, I don't do that until you commit the same act with me twice. Then I tend to get nasty and violent.\" \"Like what you did to the abuser then? I'd have loved to see that.\" \"He won't be pestering other women now,\" Madison stretched out with a smirk on her face. \"the asshole got in my face for hitting on another guy and I admit I'm a shameless flirt. It's in my nature. My ex started going mental on me, screaming and yelling right in my face, so I called the cops on him. Told them that my ex was getting ready to hit me, so they took him down to the cop station. Turns out the guy liked little boys and had several ex girlfriends who all said he was abusive.\" James snorted and started giggling. \"What's with you?\" Madison asked, amused at his antics. \"All that shit happens and you can't tell me that you didn't leave a mark on him of some kind!\" he guffawed. \"Come on!\" \"Fine! I cut him with a knife like he did to me when he got too close for my comfort. I don't believe in violence, James, but I had to defend myself.\" \"I believe you,\" he smiled down at her. \"you need to get in a shot to assert yourself.\" \"That and I also threatened to cut his dick off if he got near me again. He tried to call my bluff but I wasn't bluffing at all. Came at him with a Swiss Army knife, unzipped his fly, then as soon as he felt the blade, he ran off like the wimp he was. Fuck him.\" \"Did you?\" \"Nope,\" Madison gave him an evil grin. \"he didn't have the right touch with me. I could get him off plenty, but he couldn't do anything to me that I liked.\" \"Did you fake it?\" \"Didn't have to. My gut instinct told me not to have sex with the guy and I didn't. He was really frustrated and I insulted his pride when I told him straight out he wasn't cuttin' it for me.\" James laughed again, imagining the look on the guy's face. \"Bet he loved that.\" \"Yeah. He was a big believer in pig sex. Asshole was a selfish dickhead and I'm well shot of him now. I'm just glad to be free.\" \"I can bet. God, the sun's gone down already.\" Madison stood up, stretching. \"It has, look at that. Want to come in?\" \"Sure.\" he opened up the door, making the after you gesture. Madison pranced in mockingly, swinging her hips so the skirt danced back and forth. James followed her in and shut the door, watching as she gripped the waist of her skirt and yanked on it. \"I can be a skank inside.\" the skirt came off to reveal the set of denim hotpants she had worn the day before. Tossing the skirt on the couch, the time traveler gave James a coy wink, wryly inviting him into her presence. The actor needed no further indication as he immediately went to her like a moth to a flame. \"You're a fine lookin' woman, you know that?\" just the sight of Madison was triggering an involuntary reflex. \"I put a lot of hard work into this body so it's time I get to show it off a little bit.\" she replied saucily. \"It's a fine job you're doing.\" to his eye she had curves in all the right places, an enticing figure, and she was sassy. He liked his females with fire in their souls. \"Well thanks. Play your cards right and I might let you see places you only read about.\" she saucily told him with a sly wink. \"Mind you that you do have to work for it.\" \"What do I have to do?\" James didn't mind putting effort in. He wouldn't object to getting her in bed, as she looked as fun as she was sexy. Madison pulled on a bathrobe and eyed the actor with a gleam in her eye. \"I'm not saying anything. You need to put some effort into it and do what you think that I would like.\" \"Oh. Well, come on then. I got nothing but time. You?\" \"Plenty of it. Let me get dressed properly first.\" \"Can I help you?\" he asked wolfishly. \"You haven't done anything to warrant that privilege, James.\" Madison retired to her bedroom to dress. \"Ohhh..\" the actor smiled, mystified and wondering if he would be able to get her in bed before the night was out. \"I don't give it all away up front!\" her voice reached him through the door. James laughed and wandered around the living room, seeing her books on the coffee table, seeing many works of classic literature. Jane Eyre was on the top; James picked it up and opened it to the spot Madison had marked. \"Where Jane confronts Mr. Rochester about his loony wife,\" the actor mumbled. \"always thought that would be a good scene.\" There wasn't much else he could glean from Madison's abode. She had no pictures of family dotting the walls or mantlepiece; there wasn't any personal touch to the condo at all. James frowned, confused at first, but then remembered she had told him she was only on vacation. \"Time for me to use my brains then.\" \"I didn't quite hear that,\" Madison reappeared, wearing simple pants and a brown peacoat over a white top. \"you were saying?\" her hair was braided and woven into a knot at the back of her head. \"You look good.\" \"Thanks. Let's do this.\" James and Madison went over to his house where his motorcycle was waiting. Without a word, Madison straddled the bike, put on a helmet, followed by James. The date went very well, James taking Madison to a family owned restaurant about 20 minutes away from their homes. He wanted to take her to the Villa Capri, which was a favorite place of his, but the memories of himself and Pier Angeli were too fresh in his mind. Madison didn't need to be at the place where he had some fond memories, so he switched gears and took her to another spot. \"So tell me a story,\" James challenged. \"anything.\" \"Hmm, a story...\" Madison grinned. \"my friend Diesel and I decided to challenge each other. Both of us took our cars and we converted them the best we could to be camping vans. Both of us had wagons, so I folded down the backseat, put a mattress pad and sleeping bag, then I even made privacy curtains!\" the young woman laughed. \"I had books and a sketchpad to keep me busy, a little space off to the side for my clothes and vice versa. Diesel made a much better job than me! He used old white sheets and duct tape to put impromptu curtains up, he could fit a twin mattress in the back, and he really had more space than me.\" \"Did you camp out in them?\" \"Oh god, yes! We went to the White mountains in New Hampshire, camped out for two nights. Diesel is a boy scout so he made fires we could use to cook over, etc.\" \"Were you comfortable?\" James's eyes sparkled. Madison burst out laughing. \"No! I have an old shoulder injury that suffered those nights and we both became sick because it was cold.\" \"Sounds like you had one hell of a time.\" \"Yes. I liked it, but I don't want to camp in a car like that again.\" \"Yeah...\" James regaled her with a few tales of his acting jobs, purposefully keeping away from his past romantic relationship. Madison thought he would be constantly talking about Pier, but he wasn't. Inwardly she had to commend James for not rehashing the past on his romantic life. A more inept woman would have asked, as certainly his romantic life was tabloid fodder and common knowledge, but Madison was not going to trespass into where she did not belong. The little restaurant James had taken Madison to was not widely known so there was no media around to hound James. It was a relief to him and Madison, who did not want to have her face caught in the tabloid rags. Upon returning to James's place, Madison removed her helmet and picked up a Siamese kitten who had been eyeing her suspiciously. \"Hey, kitty.\" \"That's Marcus,\" James shut the door. \"he's new here.\" \"Great.\" \"I know,\" James picked up his cat and nuzzled him, evoking a loud purr. \"isn't he sweet?\" \"I'm not really a fan of cats,\" Madison admitted. \"I was always more of a dog person.\" \"Well, maybe you need some time to get acquainted.\" he suggested. \"So what should we do now?\" \"My rule is I never ever have sex on the first date. Goes along with my policy.\" Madison teased, giving James a wide grin. \"Are you really sure? Don't I trip your trigger?\" the actor sidled up to her and began to kiss Madison gently. She responded to his touch, giving him a playful kiss on the cheek and making him take off his jacket. \"See? I can be a gentle lover.\" \"Well...\" Madison moaned a little bit as she succumbed to James's touch. He worked her jacket off of her, tossing it on top of his nearby. \"You do have a certain quality then the others didn't...\" \"Oh? And what's that?\" he sniggered in mid kiss. Apart from the fact that James Dean was a legend in her time, the first rebel before it was cool? The fact that he was the first bonafide rebel in American history? Madison could not give voice to what she was really thinking of course, but she wasn't at a loss for words. \"When you look at me, you seem to see me as a true woman, one with sexual desires...\" her other boyfriends didn't see her like that at all, therefore a rendezvous with James was all the more special. \"Why wouldn't I?\" unbuttoning her white shirt, James began necking her right between her shoulders and worked his way up. \"You are a woman after all who does have sexual urges and I'm here to help you release them.\" \"You make it sound like I'm a dirty whore almost..\" \"Everyone has those moments.\" the actor paused as Madison unbuttoned his jeans with a coy grin. \"Do your worst.\" \"You're a special person, James,\" Madison did what she wanted to earlier, putting her hand on the right side of James's face and letting it slide down as he reached up and held her face in his hands. \"I love the way you look and the way you look at me.\" \"I like you Madison, you're really gutsy. None of the other girls I dated have your fire.\" he was sincere in his statement and Madison could tell. She leaned up and kissed him, her mood turning devilish. James gave her a slight questioning glance as Madison backed him onto the couch and pushed him down onto it. \"Oh, all geared up are you?\" he laughed as Madison pulled her shirt off. \"Let's just say that I'm gonna let the cat out. No offense, kitten.\" Marcus the kitten was sitting on the end table watching them intently. James reached over and unzipped Madison's pants. Grinning, she gave him a suggestive look with her eyes, then straddled him, allowing the actor to pull her pants down. Several hours later, Madison woke up to a slight groan beside her. The couch shifted as James got up. She sensed him leaning over her as he spread a blanket over her form. He then moved away and Madison remembered that James often had trouble with insomnia. After waiting for a few moments, she stood up and followed him, drawing on one of his robes for privacy. The actor was standing in his kitchen, gazing out over the front garden as the stars twinkled in the sky. He was holding his kitten in his hands and even from a distance away Madison could hear the purring. \"Everything OK, James?\" she approached him tenatively. \"Thought you were asleep.\" \"Not anymore,\" she said with a rueful grin. \"something up?\" \"Not anymore... I'm not a machine you know.\" James teased as Madison took Marcus from him. \"I can definitely say that was the best experience of my life,\" she kissed him. \"I've never had multiple orgasms in one session before.\" \"Neither have I. I didn't know you liked it angry.\" \"It's the most fun when it's angry,\" Madison nudged him with one hip as the kitten jumped onto the kitten counter. \"you got insomnia?\" \"Yeah,\" he said with a sigh. \"I just don't want medicine for it.\" \"Understandable,\" Madison leaned her head on his arm. \"have you thought about alternate therapies?\" \"Such as?\" \"Trying to relax some. My mother did it to me when I couldn't sleep. Come on.\" she tugged on his arm, bringing him to the bedroom. James got onto the bed without protest as Madison gathered him in her arms like he was a little boy. \"Sometimes the simple ways are the best ways.\" James was sitting up with Madison's arms around him, his head on her breast. Trusting her to know what she was doing, the actor did his best to relax. \"Did your mom ever sing to you?\" \"Sometimes.\" memories of the past flooded his mind and he bit his lip as past pain and grief threatened to surface. \"This is a little song where I come from.\" \"Never mind, I'll find someone like you. I wish nothing but the best for you. Don't forget me, I'll beg, I'll remember you said sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead. You know how the time flies, only yesterday was the time of our lives. We were born and raised in a summer haze bound by the surprise of our glory days.\" James listened, surprised at how she could transform her voice and he was even more surprised to find he was relaxing and getting sleepy. \"I hate to show up out of the blue uninvited but I couldn't stay away, couldn't fight it. I had hoped to see your face and that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over...\" Madison crooned the chorus, noticing James's eyelids were closing. She softened up her voice a little bit. \"Nothing compares, no worries no cares, regrets and mistakes they're memories made. Who'd have known how bittersweet these would taste?\" There was no point in singing now. James was out like a light. Madison wondered how long it had been since he'd had someone to help him like she did. Giving him a kiss, Madison reclined back, closing her eyes. ~DREAM~ She was in a room which was stark white and had one window. Madison sat up from where she was lying right underneath the window and looked out of it to see a beautiful Japanese garden and a little koi pond. Wondering what was going on, Madison didn't have time to ponder it much more as a door was flung open and James barged in. \"Maddie!\" he was wearing blue scrubs and she saw a bright green ID bracelet on his left wrist. James flung himself at her in a big bear hug that almost knocked her down. He looked the same as always had to her, no evidence of grisly injuries he sustained during the crash. The whitness in the room was starting to give her a headache which James seemed to sense. Taking her arm, she was led into the Japanese garden right near the koi pond. Madison leaned down and put her fingers in the koi pond, letting the fish nibble at her fingers for a long moment. She glanced up at James, squinting through the sunlight at him. \"James, what's going on?\" Enjoying the quiet and relaxing atmosphere, the actor put his hands on hers, pulling her up from her kneeling position slowly. \"Don't you know?\" \"Enlighten me.\" Madison sat down in the small gazebo with James, who plucked a daisy from nearby and put it over her left ear. \"This is the hospital I was taken to after my accident. This gazebo and pond aren't part of it. I thought you'd be more comfortable out here.\" \"Why are we here?\" \"You mean why are you here,\" he corrected her. \"I've been here since the accident.\" \"Then...\" \"You're here because I asked to meet you in your dream. I know you're time traveling to meet me in the past.\" \"What's your point, James? Wanna get a little nasty?\" Madison's eyes sparkled and she leaned in for a kiss but James pulled away. \"James Dean refusing my candy kisses? Wow, you must have something on your mind.\" The actor ignored the little dig at him and stared at Madison straight in the eye. James picked up her hand and rubbed the back of it, bringing it to his lips and kissing her knuckles. Madison gave a little grin, watching him intently. \"I do. I want you to warn me of the accident so I don't die.\" \"James, if you know I'm a time traveler, then you know that I can't change the past,\" she protested. \"your present is written and I'm bound by the oath of time agents to uphold the laws of time travel!\" \"So you let laws get in the way,\" his eyes darkened. \"we were in love and you won't alter the future for me!\" \"Bullshit!\" Madison stood up and put her hands on the sides of James's face. \"You don't know how I stared at your picture when I was growing up and wishing that the outcome could have been different. You and me James, the world ours. I fantasized about you and dreamt about you for years. Now I'm an adult, I understand that what's past is past; you won't do any good living in it.\" \"So you refuse to save me.\" \"It was an accident pure and simple, James. Nothing I do will change it.\" \"You won't even try.\" his eyes were flinty cold like icicles. He walked over to the entranceway of the gazebo and glared out of it. Madison stood behind him and leaned her face on his back. James wanted to shrug her off but he didn't have the heart to. Even now he could still smell her scent and it drove him crazy with desire for Madison. \"It's part of the job, James. What happened is irreversible. I would lose my time traveling license and my livelihood.\" Madison wasn't about to launch into the soliloquy about how she found her job and how much she loved it. Besides if James had followed her all her life, he would already know everything about her. \"You won't sacrifice your job for love.\" he stated abruptly, turning away from her. \"James, it's a fling!\" she told him sternly. \"I have to keep on with my life and you should be having fun with your afterlife. Keep an eye on me, keep coming to me in my dreams. Warn me if you want to of danger ahead.\" James lit up a cigarette and exhaled, though Madison didn't smell any smoke. \"Tellin' me to be your guardian angel?\" She smiled tenatively. \"With my career it's a full time job. You won't be bored.\" \"I think I could deal with that. Of course I can appear in your dreams anytime I want, but it's up to the Almighty God for me to warn you. I can't just do it willy-nilly.\" \"Now you sound like me,\" Madison admitted with a wider grin. \"what's with the hospital getup?\" \"Hmm?\" glancing down at his garb, he shrugged sheepishly. \"I forget I'm still wearing it half the time. I woke up here in this outfit.\" in a flash he changed into jeans and a white t-shirt with an unbuttoned denim shirt. \"Better?\" \"Yeah.\" for the first time, Madison noticed she was wearing a white corset style dress. \"I hate how I look in dresses.\" \"Yeah?\" James measured her up. \"You look damn sexy to me.\" \"Thanks, James.\" the actor embraced and kissed her tenderly. \"I'll never stop loving you.\" \"Back at you.\" he raked his left hand through her hair gently, admiring the way it sprang back into its curly tresses. \"Name a son after me?\" \"We'll see. I don't stay in one time long enough to get hitched and punch out kids.\" \"I'll see you again... in your dreams...\" James reached up, gently pulling her eyelids shut as a wave of drowsiness overcame her. ~END DREAM~ \"Madison?\" Madison opened up her eyes with a little grunt. James was looking into her face questioningly, still in the same position as he was in the night before. Marcus leaped onto the bed, rubbing his master's arm with mews of complaint. The morning light streamed in through the window, nearly blinding her for a moment. \"What, James?\" \"You OK? You were restless in your sleep. Dreams?\" his left hand trailed down the side of her face, trailing it down to the top of her bosom, making Madison flush red and go hot at the same time. \"To say the least, yes.\" she admitted. \"What do we do today?\" \"Well, I would like to keep you in bed today so we can... play.\" he winked, picking up his kitten and stroking him. Marcus looked at him smugly, the picture of kitty innocence. \"I'm game for that one!\" Madison laughed as she got up, still wearing James's robe. \"First off I need a few things from my place. You get breakfast ready.\" \"You better back that gorgeous ass back in here in 10 minutes or less.\" James warned as he put his kitten on the counter and took the ingredients for the cat food. Marcus entwined himself around James's arm, prompting the actor to shoo him away gently while he fixed the cat's breakfast. Madison was back in two minutes, bringing her shampoo, toothbrush, and a change of clothes. Giggling, the two adults made up their breakfasts, poking fun at each other the entire time. James made Madison snort with laughter, relating several stories about growing up on a farm. \"Well, what do we do now?\"James teased as they sat down on his couch about half an hour later. Marcus jumped onto the sofa and headbutted Madison's hand, begging to be petted. \"I don't know about you, but I've got an itch that is just begging to be scratched,\" Madison winked. \"it came up last night when we went to bed together.\" \"You know, I felt like something was missing too,\" James recognized her pursuit and though he liked to be the dominant one, he was curious to see how far she would go. \"what do you think?\" Madison wanted to initiate sex rather like Rose in Titanic, but she cast aside all caution. \"Oh hell! I'm no good at foreplay!\" James burst out laughing, starting Marcus who dashed away in fright. \"Shall I?\" \"Start my engine.\" Madison acceded, wanting to see and experience what kind of a lover James Dean actually was. Within minutes Madison's engine was revving and her libido was primed up for action. James knew what to do and it seemed like he really knew just what got her going. He hit all the right spots, making her hot and cold at the same time. Soon she was confident enough to do the same thing to him, just exploring his body at first, then returning the necking he was giving her. \"Wanna do it in here or on the bed?\" James asked between necking and fondling. \"We're gonna fall off the couch at some point,\" Madison murmured. \"Come on.\" \"Point taken.\" he picked her up and went into the bedroom. Stripping her of her clothes, Madison posed for him as she undid his jeans and yanked his shirt off. \"Not yet it hasn't.\" she said breathlessly, forcing his pants off. \"Come on, you sexy beast!\" James laughed, allowing her to grab his hands and yank him down onto her. \"You look amazing, you know that?\" The time traveler rolled her eyes for a brief moment as James mounted her like a cowboy on a horse. Both of them were endowed in all the right places, not too thin but not fat either, and both had stamina. In the background, Marcus the cat strolled into the room casually, leaping onto the bureau and settling down. He didn't know what the two humans were doing but it was interesting to his feline eyes. An hour later the couple was happily lying beside each other, panting heavily. Madison grabbed a towel and began to wipe the sweat off of her body as James lit up a cigarette and exhaled. \"What do you think?\" \"Of our... rendezvous?\" he nodded with a cocky smile. \"Wonderful. I feel very satisfied and happy now.\" \"Are you up for experimenting?\" \"What kind of experimenting?\" James whispered in her ear. After spending a long time in the bedroom, James asked Madison if she'd like to go out for supper. Happily accepting, the pair donned their motorcycle gear and got on his bike. \"So where are we going?\" Madison yanked the strap on the helmet, getting on the back of the bike. \"Secret,\" he winked and flipped down the visor of his helmet, revving the engine and starting off with a small jerk. The time traveler knew it was his favorite place, Villa Capri. At her home she favored a small restaurant called The Dive and it was primarily seafood she loved. At the Villa Capri, they parked, went in, and true to form, James had steak while Madison ordered haddock and vegetables. The two of them said nothing for about five minutes until their hunger was blunted. James was recognized by the owner of the restaurant but he kept quiet, not wanting to spoil their blissful night out. \"So tell me about yourself,\" the actor requested. \"What's to know? I'm about your age, I have one brother, was raised in a normal house in a normal suburban street,\" Madison paused to take a drink. \"I did everything the other kids did, learned how to garden, enjoy boat rides, that sort of suburban upbringing. You?\" \"My mom died when I was 9,\" he stated simply. Madison, though she knew this already, feigned surprise. \"I lived with my aunt and uncle in Fairmount Indiana until I turned 18. I went to New York for a time to train as an actor and my big break came when Elia Kazan came and saw me in a play and gave me a part in his film East of Eden. I did Rebel Without A Cause as well, and I just finished Giant with Liz Taylor.\" \"I love her,\" Madison's eyes sparkled in the low light. \"she's beautiful.\" \"She is,\" James agreed. \"she's the one who gave me the cat.\" \"Marcus, eh? He's with a good owner.\" \"He's a little shit just like me.\" \"Oh yes. I had a guinea pig growing up. I would let her out of her cage and if I was downstairs away from my room, she would walk to the stairs and squeal for me,\" the time traveler smiled wistfully, remembering the times that had happened. James drank the last of his soda, belched, then extended a hand to Madison across the table. \"Shall we?\" Paying the waiter and giving him a generous tip, Madison nodded and they went out to his motorcycle. \"Shall we have a little detour on the way home?\" Madison was eager for adventure, so she agreed happily. James mounted the bike, started it up, then they rode out to a studio about 20 minutes away from home. \"Where are we, James?\" Madison put her helmet down on the bike as he stood up from the motorcycle. \"We are at a private studio where I had an audition here. I see they're still here so we can use one of the rehearsal rooms.\" he led her down a path to the building, knocked once on the door, then entered. \"It's easy. They have late hours and the rehearsal rooms are open to anyone who can use them.\" \"So what did you want me to come here for?\" the room had cherry hardwood floor and was a big empty room with two chairs and a long table in the center. \"I want to see if you can act,\" James picked up a chair and sat in it backwards. \"did you ever do theater?\" \"I was part of the backstage or technical crew,\" Madison answered, going over to him and sitting on the table, putting one leg in his lap with a grin. \"I even did makeup.\" \"Oh, I didn't think that you were a drama brat.\" he worked one hand up the pant leg teasingly. \"So do you think you can do a little improv with me?\" \"In awhile,\" Madison airily replied. \"I want to test your improv and acting skills by a unique challenge.\" \"What do you want me to do?\" \"This is a little challenge that my drama teacher showed her students once. I'm going to test your creativity and ability to improvise on the spot,\" she announced, getting off of the table. \"you will leave the room, count to five, then when you reenter, I will be on the floor in a position that you interpret however you want. Think of me like an object and make up the story of what happened to me. It can be as farfetched as you want it to be. I just want to see how creative you are.\" \"I think I got it. I can be as funny or as dramatic as I want?\" \"Yes indeed.\" she shooed him towards the door and he left. Madison got down on the floor, lying on her right hand side. Closing her eyes, she wondered what kind of story James would come up with. The door opened up again, then James came into the room. \"Madison?\" he called, seeing her on the floor with her eyes closed. \"Fall out of bed did you?\" the actor picked her up and put her on the table, sitting beside her, trailing one hand down the left side of her face, his fingers outlining the pink in her delicate looking lips. \"I never could tell you this while you were awake,\" he began his soliloquy. \"you are a one of a kind person, brave, sweet, all of the positive adjectives you could say about a person. My life is better for having you in it. When I heard you had been attacked by that brute of an ex boyfriend of yours, I wanted to hunt him down and kill him. I brought you home a few days ago and you just won't talk to me now. Why is that? Are you ashamed? Embarrassed? Why won't you talk to me? Afraid I'd go out there and hunt down that nasty son of a bitch that hurt you? The night I got the call I went straight over to your side, waited through a three hour surgery, and last week I was there at your bedside while you recuperated. I think I deserve more than what I'm gettin' right now. I get that you're weak, you don't want to talk about it, but I need to know sometime and it might as well be now.\" Madison, despite having been part of the production and technical crew at plays, wasn't a bad actress. She had been trained by several people over her high school career and while her talent was mediocre, she could hold her own. The time traveler decided to pipe up, just to show off her own skill a little bit. James had given her plenty of ideas to work with. Madison never had an abusive relationship so she could only guess, but she did have some friends who previously had abusive boyfriends. Time to cue herself in. The young woman muttered, \"James...\" turning her features into an expression of pain. \"Madison?\" he glanced down at her in mild surprise. \"Wake up, honey.\" She tilted her head towards the sound of his voice, slowly opening up her eyes. \"James.\" Madison saw that James's eyes were a little wet, remembering that he didn't like to do anything halfway. He wasn't the type for cutting corners when it came to acting. If the part called for him to cry, he would cry for real. \"Hi, Maddy, how are you feeling?\" \"Tired and sore. I didn't have to mouth off to the guy and provoke him to attack me but I did. Stupid me for being that way. Always have to get in the last word.\" \"Hey, it's OK,\" the actor raked his fingers through her hair. \"we all have those moments. Look on the bright side-he's in jail and you're safe.\" \"For now!\" she choked out the line, thinking of distressed Judy in her first scenes in Rebel. \"What if he comes back to me later on after getting out of jail?! He'll come back and finish what he started! He called me a disgusting dirty bitch, James!\" tears streamed out of her eyes as she turned away from him, pretending to be ashamed. James was nearly taken aback by Madison's pronouncement and realizing she was testing him with her own acting, he barged on: \"Do you think that's true? Any of it? It was something that happened and it can't be forgotten! You just have to face it.\" \"I can't, James-I'm really scared!\" \"Scared of what? He's in jail, he can't hurt you now.\" notes of frustration was seeping into James's voice. \"Maddy, just tell me what you feel and I'll understand.\" \"All right,\" the time traveler turned back to him, her eyes swimming. \"I'm scared he'll come back and try to hurt you too.\" James's jaw nearly fell open and he leaned over, embracing Madison. \"Don't you worry about me. I'll be all right.\" \"Thanks, James. I don't want anything to happen to you and I really mean it. You're the best thing I have in my life and I don't want to lose you.\" \"Back at you, hot stuff,\" James gave her a deep kiss. \"now, let's go home. Think you can walk?\" \"Yeah I can.\" she sat up and James applauded her. \"Yay! You're good, know that?\" \"I'm mediocre, James. Acting doesn't come naturally to me and I never pursued it.\" \"Perhaps you should reconsider,\" he suggested as she hopped off the table, studying her with his big blue eyes. \"I think you could make it.\" \"Well, I don't know. My career doesn't give me a lot of time to be involved with theatrical productions.\" she hesitated doubtfully. Madison did have a time machine on her hands but it wasn't hers and she could only take it on official business or a vacation in a time period with official permission. \"What do you do for work?\" James took her hand as they left the rehearsal room. \"I'm an agent for a big international firm. Obviously I work for the American branch. I get assignments to do some things and I carry them out. I've been all over the world so far.\" different times too but she couldn't say that. \"What kind of assignments?\" \"Oh, just here and there,\" she said airily. \"help out with a conflict, do random acts of kindness..\" \"How much longer you have on your vacation?\" \"Not a lot of time,\" Madison glanced at her watch. \"One more day to go.\" \"Let's make the most of it?\" James suggested. \"I have to pick up my Porsche tomorrow and take it to my mechanic friend. Want to bring me?\" \"You actually want to have me drive you?\" Madison teased as she strapped her helmet on and got onto the back of the motorcycle. \"What is the world coming to?\" James giggled and put on his own helmet, straddling the bike and turning it on. \"I don't know! Maybe you got me under a spell!\" Madison's laughter was carried away by the wind as the bike roared to life and sped away from the curb. When they reached James's house, Madison reluctantly got off of the motorcycle, removed her helmet and walked into the garage. In two days, she would be gone and James would be gone too. He had to leave the day after she did for the ill fated car trip to Salinas. In short, Madison wanted to leave James before he left her. \"You're awfully quiet all of a sudden,\" James remarked. \"what are you thinking about over there?\" The time traveler had sat down on the couch without even knowing it consciously. Marcus meowed a welcome to her and hopped up into her lap, batting at her fingers like they were his newest toys. Madison absentmindedly allowed him to play with her hand, ignoring the little nips the animal gave her. \"Not much,\" she lied. \"just wondering what my next assignment will be.\" \"I'm sure it'll be an exciting one,\" he snapped the top off of a beer bottle and sat down next to her, offering her a sip. \"you drink?\" \"Does a whore take a dump in the woods?\" she drank a gulp of beer. \"That a stout?\" \"Yeah. You like?\" \"Yeah. I'm partial to browns and blacks.\" Madison lay down on the couch, putting her head in James's lap. Marcus clambered onto her, sitting down on her ample chest. James laughed, lighting up a cigarette. \"I didn't think he liked you that much.\" \"No, he just likes the most cushiony spot in the house.\" she accepted the cigarette James handed her, taking a puff and handing it back. \"You smoke?\" \"On occasion.\" very rarely was more like it. Madison had smoked a few times in high school, but she didn't like it very much at all. \"I have a few Bible-thumpers in my household and they got after me about all the evils of drinking and sex before marriage.\" \"Bible-thumper?\" \"Like that guy in Eden, James. I'm about to besmirch and badmouth the good book so cover your ears if you must.\" she took another drink. \"Fire away.\" \"It's a good book, but people who Bible thump are nothing more than dirty hypocrites,\" Madison's eyes narrowed against the smoke. \"I've had my aunt preaching sermons at me on how to live my life. You know how I got back at her for butting in?\" a cynical smile appeared at her lips. \"How?\" \"When I was 16, me and my pals dressed up as ghouls and scary monsters for Halloween. We went over and TP'd her house, then put a mask of Satan in her mailbox. The neighbors told me she screamed loud enough to wake the dead!\" Madison laughed and James joined in. \"Did she ever suspect you?\" \"Oh hell yes! She's preaching this old fashioned prejudice that I should stay home, get married, punch out kids and not earn a cent. She says all good Robtians do it. My mom and dad are good Robtians but they don't do it. I got all self-righteous and said the Bible was written by a man therefore I can't take it seriously. I do the ten commandments to live by as the official declarations of my religion, but I don't do the Bible. Auntie had steam puffing out of her ears when I said that and she hasn't bothered me since.\" \"You're my kind of woman.\" the actor leaned down to kiss her which she accepted happily. \"You don't take crap from anyone, do you?\" \"Nope.\" Madison yawned. \"Man am I tired.\" \"Time for bed!\" stubbing out his butt, James picked Madison up, making her yelp with surprise and the cat jump off of her angrily. The next day after they had lunch, James and Madison both got into the rental T-bird with her at the driver's seat. It was true that James had a devil may care approach to driving but it hadn't gotten him into any trouble. Never had and never will-he'd been speeding but that was all. As forensics proved almost 50 years later, James hadn't been speeding at the time of his accident. It had been the inept student who really killed him at least in her eyes. Grinning wickedly, Madison pushed in the clutch and downshifted the car to third gear, cruising along until they reached the highway where she went 55 MPH. It was a two lane highway so she was able to pass people with ease, which she did. \"Whoa!\" James yelped as Madison steered into the left lane suddenly, passing a Packard. She got back into the right lane, flashing the brake lights carelessly, making the other driver lean on the horn. Madison cheerfully held her right hand up high with the middle finger extended. \"Woooo!\" the young woman laughed while James almost choked on his own laughter. \"Wow, girl! You can't tell me you haven't been in an accident before, driving like this!\" \"Just once!\" she told him. \"Almost six years ago. Some dickhead rearended me and popped my left shoulder out of joint. I had to get to the hospital to put my shoulder back into place.\" \"Musta hurt.\" \"They drugged me up pretty good, James. I don't remember it,\" Madison admitted as she made a turn. \"is this place it?\" \"Yeah!\" the time traveler wanted to powerslide the car into the parking lot, but the car handled a lot differently than the GTR. The steering wasn't as responsive and it was a bit heavier. James got out of the car and introduced Madison to his mechanic, Rolf, and a friend of his named Bill. The young woman hoped she looked presentable, wearing a tan pencil skirt with a white button up shirt with sandals on. \"Hello, Madison!\" Bill greeted her, followed by Rolf. \"how long have you known Jimmy here?\" \"Oh, only about four days or so.\" they exchanged lively chatter while Rolf showed James the Porsche. Madison got a look at it, wondering if the car would give her a creepy vibe like other said it had. The silver car sat demurely in the garage, looking innocuous. Creepy vibes did not register with Madison, who reasoned that her vibe tuner was out of whack as the car was just a car, not a Robtine or anything evil. She didn't think that the car had been hexed or anything of that nature either, so she concluded it was nothing. The mechanic and James were talking about performance enhancing, something Madison wasn't interested in. She could imagine James in her present time, watching her with the GTR and running it in a track meet. He would have been delirious with joy as Madison would employ traction control, the launch control, slip differentials, and all the other performance enhancing features the GTR was equipped for. \"Well, do you like it?\" James joined her as they appraised the car. \"Didn't want to spring for a Lotus?\" \"I find Porsches are better for my kind of racing.\" \"To each their own. What now?\" \"I need to attend a production meeting but I'll have Bill drop me off tonight, OK?\" \"OK. I'll go out and do something...get into trouble!\" she dodged James's attempt to grab her arm and sped out of the garage and into the showroom where Bill and Rolf were standing. Madison spent the afternoon by herself, tidying up her place and making it ready for the next occupant. Her luggage was stowed in the trunk of the GTR, every trace of her in the condo was erased. Madison completed her protocol checklist which the agency had provided for her with strict instructions to complete it before her departure. \"Took long enough to accumulate vacation time but by god do they pin the ball and chain on you the entire time you're gone!\" tucking the list into the small messenger bag, Madison got out and shut the scissor door. Taking a vacation in a specific period of time was a risky business, but it was a perk of being a time agent. Madison had planned hers out for a long time and though her vacation was short, only a week long, but she didn't want to stay for too long or she'd get bored. \"Oh Marcus,\" Madison fed the cat as it was getting dark. \"in less than 3 days you'll have run away to parts unknown; your owner will be dead. I can't interfere with history but I want to.\" Mercifully unaware, Marcus finished off his supper and meowed, licking his whiskers. Madison had flashes of the car accident scene in her mind, the twisted wreck of the speedy Porsche, the crunched section of the Ford. Thankfully she had never seen any photos of James as he lay twisted and broken. He'd had nearly the entire left side of his body broken, not to mention massive internal bleeding from the trauma. Death came as a mercy to James, Madison knew. He didn't last long with all of his injuries and even modern medicine probably wouldn't have made much of a difference. Madison didn't know much about medicine, but she guessed James would have been put into a drug induced coma, sustained several surgeries, had his jaw wired shut. Even if he survived, he would have needed extensive physical therapy. Then there was the psychological point of view. Some became too afraid to get behind the wheel and James was hard enough to discern mentally already. Madison speculated that he would have had post traumatic stress disorder from the whole ordeal and would need mental therapy to overcome it. It was likely he would have become dependent on drugs for the pain. \"Damn!\" Madison, being distracted by her thoughts, dropped a glass on the floor and trying to clean it up, cut herself on her left arm. Annoyed, she threw away the glass and was attempting to bandage herself when James came in. \"Madison?\" he saw a spot of red on the counter. \"What happened?\" \"I was distracted.\" the actor came over to her and held her arm out, putting a towel under it. James brought over his first aid kit and a lamp, aiming it at her injury. \"Not bad. I can bandage that for you. Hang on.\" he flushed out the wound with warm water and gave it a healthy dose of antiseptic. Madison watched keenly, admiring his dexterity as he rubbed the medicine into her wound. \"When did you get so good at first aid?\" \"My aunt made me take a course years ago,\" layering gauze, James pulled off a strip of tape and anchored the bandage down. \"that should do it.\" \"Well thank you very much, Dr. James,\" Madison kidded as she leaned back, not wanting to leave him the next morning. \"I have to leave at 6 AM tomorrow before it gets too light outside. You?\" \"Same,\" they walked into the bedroom and took off their clothes. Putting on their night attire, James gave her a look of horny longing. \"one last time?\" \"Oh, if you insist.\" Madison readily surrendered to his masculine wiles, really treasuring the last intimate sexual encounter. The next day at 6 AM, James was drinking coffee and Madison was getting ready to leave. Marcus was in his cat basket as James was about to drop him off at a friend's house. Madison peered over James's shoulder as he was scribbling down his instructions for the kitten's care. \"You spelled 'yolk' wrong,\" she remarked, prompting a swat on the shoulder, making her giggle. \"a genius you are not. In the literary sense...\" \"Go on!\" James teased her as he stuck the note into the side of the cat carrier. \"Time for me to go,\" Madison sighed. \"I've really enjoyed being with you, James.\" His blue eyes shone kindly down upon her. \"Back to work then?\" \"Unfortunately. I could have stayed with you forever.\" forever was about 6 that night when James would cease to be. Sensing that she was sad about something, James reached out and chucked her under the chin, giving her a lighthearted grin. Madison wished she could treasure that moment forever, when a screen idol (albeit posthumously), was looking into her eyes like he could see her soul and like what he saw. \"Hey, perk up. We'll see each other again. Call me or write me sometime, OK?\" It would never happen but Madison wasn't going to burst his bubble. \"OK. Goodbye, James. I don't know if we'll see each other again. My next assignment is in Peru.\" \"How long will you be gone?\" \"Don't know.\" they had one last kiss. \"I have to go so I'll see you out.\" James put Marcus in the Ford and gave Madison a bear hug. \"You stay in touch. I'll worry about you.\" \"I will, James.\" he started up the car and backed out of the garage, giving Madison one last wave as he turned into the main street and disappeared from sight. The time traveler brushed back a sudden tear from her left eye, drew herself up, then marched across the street to where the GTR sat parked in a shady spot, waiting for the agent to return to it. Madison took off the car cover, opened up the scissor door, then checked the time coordinates to make sure they were set properly. \"Farewell, James,\" she sighed, a slight hitch in her voice as she sat down in the seat, bringing her legs around, then closing the door. \"time to head back home.\" Starting up the GTR, Madison activated the cloaking device lest anyone see her, then drove the car out to the wide clearing, being extra careful of anyone else on the road. When she was at her landing spot, she accelerated the car, putting on her mirrored sunglasses, then let the car roar across the tarmac. Temporal displacement was instantaneous as always and Madison turned up in the agency parking lot. She brought the car into the parking garage, picked up her luggage, then walked into the office building. Her boss, Travis Lynne, looked up at her from the paperwork on his desk. \"Back safe and sound, I hope?\" her boss was a right character, loudmothed, opinionated, yet outrageously funny all in one. He had a cherubic face, gray hair, and merry blue eyes. Travis was rather rotund, but he was the soul of good nature and Madison liked working for him. \"Very much so. Here's the checklist you need.\" she handed it over without a qualm. Travis examined it, grinned, then handed her a folded up piece of paper. \"You'll want to read this when you get a chance.\" \"What is it? My next mission?\" \"No, but I think you'll enjoy it.\" Travis bid her good day, as Madison had some time to herself before the next mission was scheduled to start. \"OK. Good day.\" At her desk in the office, Madison settled in after changing her clothes to her trademark jean shorts, sneakers, and red polo necked t-shirt. She unfolded the paper and began to read it. \"James Dean, aged 24, died yesterday of a car accident. The actor had suffered multiple jaw and arm fractures, innumerable bruising among other injuries. Mr. Dean appears to have been speeding at the time of the accident, crashed into Mr. Donald Turnupseed's Ford sedan. \"At the time of the accident, Mr. Dean was driving to Salinas in order to enter his Porsche 550 Spyder in the Salinas races that are taking place today. His mechanic, Rolf Wutherich, was riding with him in the Porsche. The mechanic was thrown from the car with severe injuries and is expected to make a full recovery. \"Mr. William Hickman who was riding with Mr. Dean behind him in Mr. Dean's Ford station wagon, was accompanying him to the races and when asked, he simply remarked on his Mr. Dean's passion for racing and when inquiries were made about friends and family, replied that he would notify Mr. Dean's father immediately. \"Shortly before the accident, Mr. Dean had been sighted with a mysterious young woman around the Hollywood area in his favorite restaurant the Villa Capri, and in a vacant Warner Brothers rehearsal room. Mr. Hickman responded that he had met the young woman who's name was Madison, briefly. Mr. Dean had apparently been in a romantic relationship with Ms. Madison, as the two were seen kissing and canoodling in public. Mr. Hickman told that Mr. Dean raved about Ms. Madison, said she understood him more than anyone, even his ex girlfriend Ms. Pier Angeli. \"Of Ms. Madison, Mr. Hickman could only say that she was in town on vacation and Mr. Dean had told him that the woman traveled the world extensively, and had received an assignment to South America and had departed on the morning of the accident. Mr. Hickman would like Ms. Madison to know that she made Mr. Dean's last days more happy, as he was a moody person. \" 'He was crazy about her,' Mr. Hickman was quoted as saying. 'if things hadn't turned out the way that they did, James would have married that woman eventually.' The funeral will be held in Mr. Dean's hometown of Fairmount Indiana...\" Madison did not want to read any more. She had done what she wanted to do, give James the attention that he deserved and made his last days more fun. On to the next assignment and a new adventure. END A/N: I saw some promos for a new TV show on ABC called Resurrection and I'm going to do something like that for Madison and James. Stay tuned!

It was the greatest! T___T *cry* But it's gone....And by the way, I don't own the great movie/play that is Rebel Without a Cause...and so here's my story. ////////////////////////////////// -|- In Memory of James Dean, whom I love -|- ////////////////////////////////// I watched as the form of Plato collapsed into my arms and crumpled to the ground. My only real best friend. I remember all those other cities and towns...No one ever really cared about me. Hell, who would really care about a rebel like me? And then Mom and Dad moved me here. Here to this low-lifed town with shallow-minded people who like to run off the edge of cliffs....Yeah...And no one really cared. I didn't mind. I was used to it...But not Plato. That little messed up kid with no parents to love him. Just that silly old nanny. He was always there, and a lot of others might say that he was some kind of annoying little brat, or as Buzz called him, \"Chicken Little.\" But he wasn't a chicken...not really was he little... \"I got the bullets! Look!\" I tried screaming as if he would come back. As if the damned officer that shot him would reverse in slow motion and wouldn't shoot him again. \"Hey, jerkpot.....What'd you do that for...?\" Tears were beginning to form and burn their way down my cheek. I started to crawl away from the lifeless body that was my friend, sobbing and dragging myself. I noticed his different socks. That stupid kid was always doing stuff like that...Always forgetting something...I started laughing, not understanding why. Dad was trying to talk to me...but how could I listen? How could I listen to what I didn't want to hear? I grabbed onto Dad's leg, crying and sobbing. \"Help me...\" He knelt down with me and started talking. \"You can depend on me.\" He said. \"Trust me. Whatever comes, we'll face it together. I swear it.\" He took in a long breath and tried to pull me up. \"Now Jim, stand up. I'll stand up with you. I'll try and be as strong as you want me to be. Come on.\" He helped me up, myself fighting for resistance. I never wanted to leave Plato's side. He was only searching for a family. \"This poor baby got nobody. Just nobody!\" Plato's old nanny was crying just as hard as I, rocking back and forth upon that bench. I looked back at her and bent down to Plato, zipping up my red jacket for him, she putting in her necklace. \"He was always cold...\" I started to cry again as Judy pulled me into a hug. I stopped myself, controlling myself. I was supposed to be older. I couldn't act like a baby anymore... \"Mom...Dad...This is Judy. She's my friend...\" I swallowed hard and walked with Judy back to the car. \"You ok?\" I had my arm around her, the night air encasing us both. And me without my jacket... \"No.\" That's all I could say. That's all I wanted to say. Because in reality, I wasn't ok. For God's sake, didn't anyone understand that my best friend had just been shot and died?! Had no one realized that it didn't matter that I was guy, and that I have reason to cry?! No one? Not even Judy? \"I...um...Have to go.\" I quickly let go of Judy and started walking in the other direction. No one seemed to have a clue that I was in emotional trauma here? \"But Jim!\" Judy tried to call me back and all I did was look back to her and shake my head. Was I really in love with her? Someone who was beautiful, intelligent, a rebel like myself, and misunderstood? Someone like whom I've always wanted? I guess so...But what about Plato? I loved him too... I took a drive down old Memory Lane. Really, though, I was cruising down the street, past Plato's house...Past Judy's. I couldn't think straight at all. Death is life's worst mystery. I wonder why no one knows nothing about that absolute infinity...I guess we won't know until we die, right? I pulled over to the side of the grass. I was back at the bluff...That one night replaying in my head. I couldn't believe that Buzz went over the edge; but hey, better him than me, right? No...That's not how I feel now. I edged forward to the end of the cliff. That drop and the cold, dark ocean was starting to look real good...Real good. But I know it's not worth it. Parents always say that it's never worth it to hurt yourself. To kill yourself. To smoke. To drink. To do drugs. To drive real fast. To drop out of school. To be a class clown. To hang out with the wrong people. And all us kids can say is 'whatever'. But we really want to say is that 'You know, how bout you go back and tell yourself that', or something like, 'Well howcome you do it?', and the like. But they never take the actual time to listen, you know? In between this whole controversy in my head...I realized...That the one I loved was already dead, and that person would never know. The one I loved was not Judy....Not Judy. Plato. \"Goodbye...\" ","Summary":" Disclaimer and Author's Note: I wrote this because I asked for the Reel Without a Cause section, an"},{"Movie":"Rebel Without A Cause","Title":"He's Always Cold","Author":"KeeLimeArt","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13070002","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Part 1 3:00 AM I knew I was making a scene, but goddammit, why wasn't anybody else? Why is everybody so cool with this? Why am I the only guy here who cares? The cops just shot down a kid with a gun, but I have the bullets! It wasn't even loaded! Taking a deep breath, I shake my head a little. Easy, kid. Just take it easy. I have Judy under my arm, but maybe her's should be over mine. My brain has been scrambled, and if I get too dizzy, I swear I can fall and take her with me. Still, I can't help but to fuel the fire. I have to look back. Everything is happening way too fast, and it's all way too surreal for me. But no, no tricks. No illusions. There's Plato's body, forcing me to see the truth. You can't turn that off like the lights in the planetarium. It's all too real, and if I look close enough, I can still see the mismatched socks he put on getting dressed this- Gosh, I only just met him last night, haven't I? This morning. This afternoon. Ten minutes ago. Ten minutes ago he was still alive. I'm telling you, I was talking to him. I gave him my jacket 'cause he was cold and shaking. Maybe he was shaking 'cause he shot two kids, but I still gave him that warm coat. He cradled it in his arms like a baby before putting it on. Before he let me see his gun. Before I unloaded it. I violently shudder, making Judy look up at me, and I have to tear my eyes away from the ambulance. She lightly puts a hand on my shoulder, and her soft eyes tell me everything; she's sad. Sad, but not upset. Not like me. \"You okay, Jamie?\" she whispers, shifting her eyes to glance where I was staring. Jamie. Still don't know where that nickname came from. \"Yeah,\" I tell her with a phony smile. \"Yeah, I think we're going to be okay.\" Judy gets real quiet, and I can tell she's thinking of something. Then, she takes a deep breath. \"Are you sure?\" She tries again. \"Sure,\" I quickly answered again. \"But-\" \"Judy!\" I loudly announce. \"I say it's fine, and it is! I'm fine! You're fine! We're all FINE. Let's just keep walkin`!\" Something about the way she's looking at me says she's not really buying it. Even if she does, she stops in her tracks, making me stop with her. I look up, but nobody is paying attention to us. The cops are scribbling away notes and talking with their radios or megaphones or whatever. My parents are squabbling. Again. Plato and his family's maid are- Judy kisses me, trying to reenact the slow, passionate lock we had in the old mansion. I felt like I was on top of the world then. I should melt into her and push the rest of this universe away, but I'm numb now. There's nothing I can feel but stunned shock, and the stunned part is starting to do away. My wandering mind gets so lost that I don't even react to her. I let my heavy hands clop down on her shoulders, and I have to push her away. \"Now's not the time,\" I insisted, trying to suppress my anger. How could anybody think about kissing at a time like this? She smacks my arm, and I jump a little in surprise. \"Jim, I'm frightened!\" she tells me, almost pleading. This time I can see the tears in her eyes, just before she envelopes me in a strangling hug. I loosely wrap my arms around her and rub her back. Her whole figure is shaking from her sobs, but I can tell that she's only hysterical. This isn't what mourning looks like. \"I never wanted any of this! It's cold; I'm scared; and none of this should have ever happened! Jim, let's get out of here. I wanna go home. Can't we go home?\" \"Yeah.\" I'm out of it. I'm in a fish tank, surrounded by glass, and everybody else is the fish. I'm untouchable. \"Let's go home, Judy. Stop crying, I'm. I'm gonna hold you the whole way there. I promise.\" She doesn't want to talk about it. Good, neither do I. 3:45 AM I took her home, safe and sound, in the family car. She slept peacefully in the passenger seat, looking blissful. It's like nothing's happened at all. Wish I could say the same about the rest of us… I don't even remember what the drive home was like. Probably cold. Definitely lonely. 4:49 AM God, it's almost five in the morning, and I'm finally crawling into bed. No way in hell am I going to school today, so I guess it doesn't matter anyways. Looking down, I see I'm still in my street clothes, and I have to give a breezy chuckle. Mom would yell at me if she saw this. Funny. Still, the pillow is waiting for me, and I dive right in without changing. My eyes shut tight, and that's when the dam finally burst. Let it be a dream. I want it to be a dream. I wanna wake up to my first real day here. No knife fights or slashed tires. No playing chickie on the cliff. I just wanna have a clean start. Is that too much to ask for? I flip over to my back and stare at the ceiling. What happened tonight? My mind is buzzing like a hornet's nest, and every question I ask just makes things more crammed and harder to work out. Eyelids feel like bricks, but my mind is screaming at me to stay awake and think about what I've done. It's not even been five minutes, and I've already been tossed and turned more than a caesar salad. God, just let me get some sleep… A heavy thump lands somewhere downstairs. I'm not talking about footsteps, either. This is like somebody flipping over the dinner table or falling down the stairs. I push the pillow close to my face and block off the ears. Let Mom and Dad take care of it. I've done enough for them today, anyways. They're already so jumpy when it comes to noises at night. But nobody comes out to see what happened. Everything is closed off in thick silence again, and I'm starting to think that I imagined it. You see and hear a lot of weird things in between sleep and awake. I've already gone sleepwalking this week, so I'm not falling for it. Nothing is tearing me out of this bed until I'm good and ready to wake up. \" Jim?\" Somebody whispers right into my ear. I can almost feel their breath, but it's cold- and sticky in a way. Oh no, I haven't really slept any, have I? Mom's not gonna break in and wake me up for school just yet, right? I crack my eyes open and tilt my head up to tell her off, but I was met with the empty air. Now I'm a little bit spooked. My heart is starting to beat a little faster now, but I'm still trying to convince myself that they're just mind games. I'm just about to enter a nightmare if I fall asleep. My eyes try to shut again, but that's when I hear it. That loud thump came back, but it's closer this time, and longer. bam, Bam, BAM! I bolt straight up in my bed, and now, I'm totally drenched in sweat. My head is still hazy, but I know, I just know what's going on. Mom quietly snuck out of her room to check on the noise. It's way too dark to see. She's tumbled down the steps! \" Jim!\" The same voice urges me. It's shrieking. Mom needs me! I barrel over my bed, smacking into the floor as the sheets tangle with my ankles. Sense has totally left me, and now, I'm running, hunched over on all fours, down the hallway. A trail of blankets are still attached to me, smacking into any end table or railing along the journey. When I reach the top of the stairs, I'm moving too fast. My bare hands slip and slide against the hardwood floor, like it's been waxed recently. I scramble to stand on my feet, but the socks only make things worse. As I try to take my first step, my feet give way, and I'm sent sailing down the steps. I don't even have time to scream. The blankets wrap around me as I start to roll downstairs, and I can't even think of a \"Help!\" to shout out. I grunt with every edge that smacks into my ribcage. It ended in two seconds, but it felt like dozens of planks were assaulting me. Even when I was battered and bruised at the bottom floor, I still sprang up to my feet, grabbing onto a corner of the wall for support. I groaned out, \"Mom…?\" trying to look for her again. Crack! A plate. The kitchen! She's heading for the band-aids in the kitchen, 'cause she got hurt! Tearing the sheets off of me, I start running towards the kitchen, but now I'm hearing footsteps, the real kind this time. They're not my own, either. Dad. Well, he's just going to have to wait. I've gotta see what's going on in this. Dark. Kitchen. Nothing. The lights are out. There's nobody here. Everything is exactly the same as it was when I ran away last night. My place at the table was still made, too. The medicine cabinet was closed, and I was the only person in here. Or, I thought I was for half a second, but then I saw the shadows moving, outside the sink window. There's a face out there, and they're wearing a red jacket. Hey! That's MY jacket. They've taken my jacket! I leap for the door and rip it open, coming close to ripping it right out of the frame. A tiny crack of light reaches over the horizon, for dawn is here. The person in my yard faces the light, standing as still as a statue and making no noise. The soft winds coming in didn't even ruffle his hair. \"HEY!\" I scream out. They won't come in here and steal my stuff! The person tilts their head to me, looking out with one eye. My hand tightens on the doorknob. This guy is a real coward, not even daring to look me in the eyes. I check him over, about to charge him, but then I realize, he's not wearing my jacket. I gave my jacket to Plato at the planetarium. My eyes trail down, and all at once, I feel my heart sinking to my stomach. This guy is wearing mismatched socks. I freeze, and everything inside me seems to stop. At the same time, my unwanted guest turns around, and steps right in front of me. I'd recognise him anywhere. That baby face and doe eyes were unmistakable. The kid clutched his stomach, and I could see dark blood seeping through his fingers. \" Jim…\" Plato gasped. The lights flick on, and I whip around, feeling like a cornered animal. Mom and Dad are standing there in their bathrobes, a little dazed and confused, but still wide-eyed and alert. Mom is clutching her handkerchief to her chest, and Dad has his finger on the switch, mouth agape. Both of them are staring at me with horror. \"What's goin' on, Jim?\" Dad asks, his words sort of muffled. \"Did somebody sneak in?\" I stare. My mouth is hanging low on its hinges, and I'm breathing heavily. I can't speak. I can hardly breathe. My eyes flash outside, but Plato is gone. Or, actually, he was never there in the first place. No footprints. \"Jim?\" Dad asks again, voice even softer. Mom steps in with a shrill tone. \"For heaven's sake, Jim, answer us!\" I want to, but I thought you were hurt? I heard something. Was it one of you? Was it me? Plato. Plato was outside, and he needs my help! My knees buckle, and I'm out cold before I can even hit the floor...

I would like to dedicate this story to James Dean, the ultimate movie icon. With much love and admiration. Jim was in shock. His one true friend was dead. \"He's gone, Judy. What have I done?\" he cried softly. Judy looked at him and took his arm. \"There was nothing you could have done,\" she replied gently. \"He was messed up.\" Jim looked at her. \"He shouldn't have died. I should have protected him.\" \"You didn't know he was going to do what he did though,\" said Judy. \"Listen to me Jim. It wasn't your fault.\" Jim still doubted her. His head was all over the place. He couldn't think straight. His mind kept flashing back to when Plato, his one true friend was shot by that fatal bullet. \"It should have been me,\" he thought over and over again. \"He didn't deserve to die.\" \"Jim,\" called his father. Jim looked back. His father was coming towards him, with his mother scuttling along behind. \"Jim, wait.\" \"Not now dad,\" said Jim. \"I don't wanna talk about it.\" \"Well you will have to talk,\" said his mother. \"Stay out of this,\" Jim warned her. \"I've just seen my friend killed in front of me. How do you think I feel?\" \"Jim don't you dare talk to me like that!\" said his mother. \"Be quiet woman,\" said Mr Stark. \"The boy is upset and in shock. Can't you leave him alone?\" \"I want to know why he hung around with someone like that,\" demanded Mrs Stark, somewhat shocked by the way her husband was acting. \"Leave it will you!\" yelled Jim. \"I want to be alone with the only person who truly understands me.\" Judy felt a smile creep across her face. She managed to control it as she looked at Jim's parents. \"Mr and Mrs Stark, please leave him with me a bit. He's having a hard time. Please let me talk to him.\" Mr Stark nodded and Judy led Jim away, towards the bottom of the hill. Jim looked around. He was now alone with Judy. Finally he stopped walking and sat on the ground. Judy sat next to him. Jim slowly breathed and allowed the tears he'd been holding back flow down his face. He sobbed hard. Judy was somewhat surprised but remained strong for him. She held him in her arm and let him cry on her shoulder. \"This isn't how it should be,\" Jim sobbed through his tears. Judy held onto him and felt tears form in her eyes. She blinked them back. \"You can't change what happened,\" she said firmly. Jim pulled back and looked at her. His eyes were red and tears were still rolling down his cheeks. \"He was the only one who truly understood me,\" he sobbed. Judy nodded. \"He cared very much about you Jim.\" \"He came to me, and I needed him. I never knew how much he needed me, or what he meant to me until tonight.\" \"He was troubled,\" said Judy. \"You were his rock.\" \"I failed him,\" Jim sobbed. \"When he needed me the most, I failed him.\" \"You never failed him,\" said Judy. \"You couldn't protect him forever.\" \"But I should have tried harder,\" cried Jim. \"I was everything to him, and I let him down.\" Judy looked at him. \"You're everything to me Jim. You haven't let me down. I know you're a good person, and Plato knew that as well.\" Jim looked at her. \"What are you talking about?\" Judy moved closer. \"I love you Jim Stark.\" She moved in to kiss him. Jim pulled back quickly. \"No,\" he said firmly. \"This isn't right.\" Judy was surprised. \"What do you mean?\" Jim stared at her. \"My best friend has just died Judy. I can't do this, not now and probably not ever.\" \"I can wait,\" she said. Jim shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You're a great person Judy, but I just can't.\" He stood up and looked up the hill. \"I want to say goodbye to him and to say sorry.\" He turned and ran up the hill towards the Ambulance and Plato's body. \"I'm so sorry Plato, I failed you,\" Jim sobbed over the body of his friend. The police were all around him, watching him closely. He looked up and stared at the nearest officer. \"What are you staring at!\" he yelled. \"Give me some privacy.\" \"I'm sorry son,\" said the officer. \"We need to take him away now.\" Jim clutched at Plato's hand. \"Take me with him then,\" he pleaded. \"I've got to say goodbye.\" The officer looked around and spoke to Mr Stark. Mr Stark nodded and the officer turned back. \"Alright kid. Come with us to the morgue. You can talk to him there.\" Jim shook his head. \"No I want to travel with him.\" Mr Stark stepped forwards. \"Jim, I will take you behind him and you can spend time with him when we reach the morgue.\" He put his hand on Jim's shoulder and gently pulled him away from Plato. Jim sobbed quietly and allowed his father to guide him away from his friend, towards his father's car. The drive to the morgue was a hard one for Jim. His eyes burned with pain. His father tried desperately to talk to his son, trying to get him to talk. Jim wouldn't have any of it. His eyes were fixed on the ambulance in front, carrying his beloved friend's body. Finally Mr Stark spoke firmly. \"Jim talk to me.\" \"I can't,\" said Jim quietly. \"He was everything to me.\" \"You've still got me, and your mum,\" said Mr Stark. \"That's not what I mean,\" said Jim firmly. \"He needed me, and I needed him. I never realised how much until tonight. I still need him.\" \"Jim listen to me,\" said Mr Stark softly. \"You can't bring him back. No matter how much you care about him, he's gone and he can't come back.\" \"I KNOW!\" roared Jim. \"IT DOESN'T MAKE ITR ANY EASIER FOR ME THOUGH!\" \"Jim, I'm trying to help,\" said his father. \"I know what you're going through.\" \"YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH!\" Jim screamed. \"Then help me to,\" said his father softly. \"I love you Jim and I want to help you. \"I,\" Jim sobbed hard. \"I love….\" He burst into noisy tears. \"Jim, hey it's ok. I know he meant a lot to you. And I'm sure you meant a lot to him. He wouldn't want to see you like this. Come on,\" said his father. \"I can't help it,\" sobbed Jim, wiping the tears away. \"I know it's hard to say goodbye to someone like this but we must all do it,\" said his father. \"He loved me dad,\" Jim cried, fresh tears rolling down his cheeks. \"I never knew how much until today.\" Mr Stark nodded. \"We all love people who are close to us.\" Jim sobbed again. \"I need him now dad. I can't be without him,\" Mr Stark nodded and put his hand on his son's leg and gave it a gentle squeeze. \"Be strong for him son. We're nearly there.\" Jim wiped his eyes and looked at the morgue, looming out of the dark in front of them. \"I want to go alone,\" he said firmly. \"Please make sure I can be on my own.\" Mr Stark nodded and parked the car. Jim climbed out and watched as Plato was taken out of the ambulance and carried inside the morgue. Mr Stark came around the car and gave his son a hug. Jim hugged his father, taking in strength from his embrace. He then turned and followed Plato through the doors. Plato was laid on a table in the centre of a well lit room. Mr Stark came with Jim and saw several officers around the room. Jim stepped inside and spoke to the officers in general. \"I'd like to spend some time with him alone.\" \"Sorry son,\" said one officer. \"We can't leave him.\" \"Gentlemen,\" said Mr Stark. \"My son has just lost his closest friend. Let him say goodbye in some dignity.\" \"You got ten minutes son,\" said the officer. The room quickly emptied. Jim smiled at his father who gave him a nod, and walked out behind the officers, closing the door behind him. Jim turned to face Plato. He took his hand and held it tight. It was still warm. His eyes welled up with tears but he blinked them away. He kept a grip on Plato's hand and moved towards his head. \"Hey,\" he said softly. \"I'm so sorry. I should have protected you. I could have, but I failed you. Plato I need you.\" He sobbed as he looked at Plato's face. It looked so relaxed and peaceful. \"Plato I need you,\" he repeated. \"You needed me and I never saw how much. I…\" he wiped a tear away from his eye. \"I love you Plato. I love you so much. I can't live without you.\" He finally gave in to the grief he was feeling and collapsed onto his friend and cried into his shirt. Time ticked by and he heard the door open. Judy walked in and looked at him apologetically. \"I'm sorry Jim, your time is up,\" she said gently, putting her hand on his arm. He nodded and looked at Plato's face one last time, taking in every feature of his face. \"Goodbye my dear friend,\" he said aloud. He then turned and walked with Judy, out of the room, leaving Plato alone. The funeral took place a few days later. It was a simple ceremony in the local church. Jim was asked by Plato's guardian to read the eulogy. He accepted, feeling he had no real choice. It hurt so much for him to have to say things about Plato, knowing he was never going to see him again. He remained strong as he delivered his speech about how good and loyal a friend Plato had been, and how much he would miss him. As he spoke, he looked around the church at the congregation. At the front was Judy, tears flowing down her cheeks. Jim had to look away. He finished his speech and turned to the coffin that carried the body of his friend. \"God bless you Plato, my dear friend,\" he said. \"I miss you so much. Goodbye, and I will never forget you, I promise you.\" With that final sentence he walked back to his seat and sat down hard. Judy put her arm through his and squeezed it gently. He looked at her and gave a quick smile. Then he turned back to Plato's coffin and tears rolled down his cheeks. \"Goodbye my love,\" he said in his mind. Plato was buried in the churchyard. Jim stayed by the grave for a while after the rest of the mourners had left. Judy hung back, giving him some privacy. \"I don't like to think of you like this Plato,\" said Jim. \"I will always think of you.\" \"Jim?\" said Judy. \"Are you alright.\" Jim turned to her and shook his head. \"I don't like to think of him down there. I should be with him.\" \"What are you saying?\" asked Judy. \"I… I can't tell you,\" said Jim, not taking his eyes off the grave. \"You can tell me anything,\" said Judy. She put her hand on his shoulder and looked at the grave with him. \"Can you keep a secret Judy?\" Jim asked. \"Yes of course,\" she replied. \"Tell me.\" \"I loved him,\" said Jim quietly. \"I know,\" said Judy. \"No,\" said Jim. \"I really loved him, and I never told him.\" \"I see,\" said Judy. \"I'm sure he knew it.\" Several days passed. Jim returned to school with Judy and things seemed to go back to normal. His mind was never on his work though. His thoughts always went back to that fateful night, when Plato was killed. His eyes would often well up with tears but he knew he mustn't show his emotions around anyone. Judy always knew how he felt and made sure she met up with him whenever she could during the day, so they could talk and share some memories of Plato. Jim was over emotional and Judy became his rock. She accepted he could never love her like he had Plato, but she was happy that she could still support him. Every evening, Jim would return to Plato's grave to spend a few moments with his friend. He would tell him everything that had gone on and would frequently tell him he loved him, and ask his advise. And at night, while deep in sleep, Plato would come to him with an answer and a message of love and hope. Jim would often wake up and sob to himself, remembering what had happened. Jim never forgot Plato, and he never felt that anyone would ever be the right person for him. Once school was over, and he had returned from the grave, he would shut himself away from the rest of the world, only coming out for meals. He never went out, except to visit the grave, or if Judy made him come out. He wanted nothing more than to shut the world away so he could be alone with his thoughts and memories. Whenever he was alone, Plato would come to him and comfort him. It was all he needed. He could never forgive himself for having never said anything while Plato was alive, but he knew that Plato had always known the truth. It isn't often that someone comes along who makes a lasting impression on someone, for the rest of their lives. Plato was able to do that to Jim. His memory was a testament to the fact that true love never dies, that love is eternal and that love remains with us, for all time.

The sky was clear and everything was pleasant. Jim Stark was feeling strangely good today because there was no school and he got to spend time with his closest friends. Today Jim, Plato, and Judy were at the beach without the typical stresses of their teenage lives. It was rare when they had a day-off from school and they could just relax and play together. Times like these were valuable and made worthwhile memories. Judy spread out a yellow beach towel on the sand and sat down to relax. Jim and Plato went play in the ocean, holding each other's hands as the waves lapped over their ankles. The pair walked further and further into the cool water until they were up to their waists. Each time a large wave washed over them, Plato would grab Jim and hold onto him tightly. Jim found this quite cute and giggled, keeping a protective arm around the ethereal young man. From the shore, Judy watched them and smiled. It always warmed her heart to see her two best friends bonding. \"Doesn't Judy look cute in that bathing suit?\" Jim asked, over the roar of the waves. \"Not as cute as you look in your bathing suit!\" Plato replied, grinning impishly. Jim scooped up a handful of water and threw it at Plato, splashing him in the stomach. \"Hey, who are you splashing?\" Plato scooped up some water of his own and hurled it at Jim, who shielded his face and tried to duck. Then Jim splashed him back, hitting him in the face this time. Jim started to laugh but stopped when Plato covered his eyes and grimaced in pain. \"Are you okay?\" Jim asked, coming over to check on his companion. \"I…I just got some water in my eyes. Owie! It kind of hurts,\" Plato said, still holding both of his eyes. \"Here, let me see.\" Jim took a hold of Plato's hands and gently pushed them down. He then examined the younger boy's eyes – they were slightly red. Jim couldn't help feeling guilty. Why did he get the stupid idea to start splashing? \"I'm sorry, Plato.\" \"It wasn't your fault!\" Plato exclaimed, giving him a big hug. Jim hugged him back. \"You'll be fine. But maybe you should rest for a little while, okay?\" \"Okay!\" Plato agreed, giving Jim's hand a squeeze. The two boys walked back to the shore together and went to the place where Judy had set up camp. They were surprised to see that Judy had fallen asleep! Jim and Plato looked at each other and smiled. \"Looks like somebody is taking a little nap,\" Jim said. \"Do you think we should wake her up? Plato asked. \"I think we better…or she might miss out on all the fun.\" \"You're right, let's wake her,\" Plato agreed, winking at Jim. Then Jim and Plato sat down on the ground beside her bare feet. Plato grabbed her right ankle and put her foot in his lap. Jim took a hold of her left foot and placed it in his lap. The boys shared a devilish grin and began tickling her feet. Judy smiled in her sleep and tried to move her feet away, but the boys held her ankles securely. Soon she was giggling and finally she was laughing her head off. \"Hahahahaha! W-What are you doing!?\" she squealed, now completely awake. \"Just giving you a few tickles,\" replied Jim, smiling. \"We had to wake you up! Coochie coo!\" Plato teased, overjoyed to be forcing laughs out of his friend. \"Not my feet! Heeheeheehee! Okay, okay! I'm awake! Hahahahahahaha! I'm awake!\" she yelled, through her laughter. The boys continued tickling her toes for a while longer, before they let up. Judy then rolled over on her side as she caught her breath, ready to scold them and give them a wag of the finger. \"That was so funny!\" Plato said, grabbing onto Jim as both boys fell down on the sand and burst out laughing. \"Oh, you two! Why don't you go build a sandcastle? It will keep you out of trouble,\" Judy suggested. \"Only if you come with us,\" Jim said, excitedly. Judy raised an eyebrow. She put her hands on her hips and gave him a look of warning. \"Okay, but will you boys behave yourselves?\" \"Cross our hearts and hope to die.\" Judy's face broke into a smile. \"Well then, let's go already!\" With that, the threesome laughed and ran across the beach, talking and joking as they looked for a good spot to build their sandcastle. When they found a good place, they all sat down and got to work. \"I'm going to build the biggest sandcastle in the world!\" Plato said, wistfully. \"How big?\" Jim asked. \"As big as a mansion and we'll all live in it together!\" \"Ooh, that sounds like fun,\" Judy said. \"It will be…We'll live right here on the beach and if anybody bothers us, we'll pour sand on their heads.\" \"Sounds like a plan,\" Jim giggled, as he packed together some sand and pushed it into a high mound. The three friends played merrily together for the rest of the day. The End ","Summary":" It was a hot afternoon in late summer. The sky was clear and everything was pleasant.

Takes place post-movie, so don't read before you've actually watched it. His parents had kept him home from school the day after everything happened. Jim wished they hadn't—it just made things harder. Still, he could see things starting to change at home. His dad was really trying now. Trying to hold his own in the conversations Jim overheard when he was pretending to be asleep. Conversations about Jim and school and not moving and Judy and... Plato. Jim half expected to see that dark, curly-haired face when he closed his locker. He knew everyone was watching him and thinking about Plato, the kid the cops had shot. Shot because they saw him carrying an empty gun. \"Hey, I got the bullets!\" Jim closed his eyes and leaned on his locker a moment. Just a moment; then he could face all those classmates and teachers and other people who would never understand. He felt a hand on his arm and turned to see Judy beside him. \"Hi,\" he said. \"Hi.\" \"You didn't wait for me this morning.\" He wasn't angry - not now that he could see her. \"I woke up early and... didn't want to hang around.\" He nodded. He hated waiting, especially for things he didn't want to do anyway. He took her hand and they walked to class together. One of the kids moved away from his desk beside Jim's when they entered the classroom. Again, Jim wasn't angry. He knew he wasn't being shunned—the kid was giving up his desk for Judy. They couldn't be together in every class, of course. A few people hadn't heard the details of the story yet; a few didn't know how badly he and Judy needed to be together. They also had separate P.E. and health and fitness classes, and Judy had Home Economics while Jim had Wood Shop. At first it seemed impossible to get through a class without her, but midway through P. E. he started to realize he was going to make it all right. When he actually looked around at the other kids jogging on the small school track, he thought about how their lives might be very similar or different. You couldn't tell much by looking. But he could tell exactly what was going on when one boy deliberately tripped another. The coach hadn't seen it, of course. It was a carefully timed move. Jim didn't bother trying to blow the whistle on him; he knew that wasn't how things were done. Instead he jogged up to the fallen boy and offered him a hand. For a second, this kid reminded him of Plato. But his hair wasn't as dark or curly... he was thinner, too. \"You OK?\" \"Yeah... thanks, Jim.\" Jim jogged beside him after that. \"How come you know my name?\" he asked, his tone accusing, but his expression friendly. The other boy looked chagrined. \"I... heard somebody else say it.\" That was no surprise; everyone would probably know his name by the end of the week. \"So, what's your name?\" \"Mud, mostly... but really it's Tommy.\" Jim giggled. He couldn't help it. It really wasn't funny... but when a person feels as bad as Jim had lately, he needs to laugh. Anything will do. \"OK, Tommy Mud. Make sure you watch where you're going, huh? So you don't trip anymore.\" \"I will.\" He saw Judy at lunch. They sat together and ate in silence until Tommy approached their table. \"Hi... would you mind if I sat here?\" Jim looked lazily at Judy. \"Should we lettim?\" \"I don't mind,\" Judy said. \"This is Tommy. We met in P. E.\" \"Nice to meet you, Judy,\" Tommy said. Jim looked at Tommy's tray. His chocolate chip cookie was a crumbled mess in its compartment. \"What happened there?\" he asked, pointing. \"Uh... Mike Albright happened to it. It's no big deal. He always crushes my cookies.\" For some reason the wording of that statement cracked Jim up. He couldn't help laughing again, when again, it wasn't really funny. \"You can have mine,\" Judy offered. \"Nah. It's OK.\" A couple of days ago, Judy wouldn't have been so generous. Jim thought she had always wanted to be a nice girl - it had been the company she kept that brought out the less kind side he had met first. He held her hand a moment under the table and went back to eating. \"Can I ask you something?\" Tommy asked, keeping his eyes on the ham steak he was cutting up. \"Sure,\" said Jim. \"How come you were hanging around with John Crawford? John was like me... had to keep his head down.\" Tommy stole a glance up at them. \"Don't you know if you help kids like us, you'll get your head knocked in?\" This time Jim managed to keep the laugh down, but he still smiled. Judy answered before he thought of anything to say. \"Thinking that way never helped anyone. When I was with the popular kids, what happened? My boy friend died.\" Tommy looked down again. \"I heard about that. I'm really sorry.\" \"So am I. It was a stupid accident. But Plato... I wish we'd stayed with him every minute. Leaving him alone was the worst thing we could have done.\" Jim could hear her voice changing. She was going to cry if she kept on like this. If she cried, he might crack, too. \"We're not going to make the same mistakes,\" he said. \"We'll be friends with who we wanna be friends with. And we'll do what we wanna do. I don't see why anyone has to be bothered by us.\" Tommy was very different from Plato, but his expression was similar: wonder, admiration with a hint of nervousness. \"I wish I could be like that,\" he said, and it seemed like maybe he hadn't meant to say it out loud. \"You can,\" said Judy. \"Sure, you can,\" Jim agreed. \"Don't let anyone tell you what you can't do.\" He leaned over the table. \"Just, uh... keep to well-lit areas, huh?\" Tommy smiled a little. He understood. \"Yeah.\" They finished eating and Tommy pushed away from the table. \"Thanks for letting me sit here,\" he said. Jim nodded to him and Judy said, \"Come again tomorrow.\" \"Really?\" \"Sure,\" said Jim. \"Just—you know—don't tell anyone. Or everyone else will wanna come.\" Tommy laughed. \"OK. See you tomorrow, then.\" They lingered a little longer. Jim wanted to tell Judy not to worry, that Tommy wouldn't end up like Plato. That he wouldn't let Tommy become that important, that he wouldn't become their responsibility. But when he looked over to say something relaxed and cool, he saw her face and completely forgot what he had been going to say. There were tears standing in her eyes. She was looking right at him, not accusingly, but mournfully. She wanted this kid. She didn't want to replace Plato, but she wanted something to fill the horrible gash where his enthusiasm used to bubble out. She wanted Tommy to be theirs. Jim silently took her hand again. Whatever she wanted, he wanted it, too. \"Come on,\" he said. \"History next, right?\" She nodded. \"You remembered.\" \"I'm getting the hang of this.\" They didn't talk about Tommy, or much of anything, the rest of the day. Jim took each class one moment at a time, looking forward to the moment when he could drive Judy home. So that's my first RWaC fic. Hope you enjoyed. If you want more, let me know. Comprehensive reviews definitely give me motivation to write.[Chapter 2] Felt like writing more in spite of lack of feedback. There just aren't enough stories out there for this movie. I changed Judy's last name to Brown because I found out that's what it is in the play adaptation. \"I think we live too close to school,\" Judy said. They were halfway home, and it was the first time either of them had spoken since getting into the car. Jim nodded and eased up on the gas pedal. He glanced over at Judy briefly and then took her hand on the seat between them. After a minute, Judy said, \"The homework is starting to pile up. I'm already getting behind.\" \"What's your best subject?\" he asked, feeling as if he should already know this. He had known Judy only a few days, but it felt like they had been together a lifetime already. \"Literature,\" she said. \"I'm pretty good in English and History, too, and I do all right in math. What about you?\" \"I think I like science the best, but that doesn't mean I'm good at it. Literature is pretty good. And... I do all right in math, too.\" \"We should study together.\" \"Yeah, we should.\" A car was closing in on them from behind. Jim made sure they had plenty of room to pass him and eventually they did, the driver shouting something unfriendly at him. \"Idiot,\" said Judy. \"Must be nice,\" said Jim. \"What do you mean?\" \"He's got something he's in a hurry for.\" He thought he saw her smile, but he was doing his best to keep his eyes on the road. She did squeeze his hand. A few minutes later he pulled up in front of her house. He let go of her hand and put his arm across the back of the seat. \"Here you are.\" \"Do you want to come in?\" Jim looked the house over. Yes didn't seem quite like an accurate answer, but no certainly didn't either. He looked back at her and nodded. Judy had come around the car by the time he was closing his door. She took his hand again and they went to the door together. Judy's house seemed nice—but like his, it also seemed a little too neat. At Jim's that was understandable because they had not lived there long enough to clutter it up much, but here it felt uncomfortable. It was big and decorated with old and expensive-looking things. \"Is that you, Judy?\" said a feminine voice, and soon a middle-aged woman appeared before them. \"Oh.\" \"Mom, this is Jim. He drove me home.\" He could tell that Judy's mother had heard a lot about him from the recognition in her eyes, though she quickly covered it. \"It's nice to meet you, Jim. Thank you for giving Judy a ride.\" \"Nice to meet you too, Missus Brown. And it was no trouble,\" Jim answered. \"We live next door.\" \"Yes, of course. I should have brought something to your mother by now.\" \"Oh, that's all right. But if you want to, I'm sure she'd like it.\" He saw her eyes flick down quickly; they were still holding hands. If he let go now, he would seem guilty. \"Well,\" Mrs. Brown said, \"do you want to come in and sit down...?\" Jim looked at Judy. She looked like she wasn't any more sure than he was of whether it would be a good idea. \"I'd better not today,\" he said, \"but thank you. Maybe tomorrow Judy and I can work on our homework together.\" She nodded hesitantly. \"That would be fine,\" she said. Her tone didn't seem confident of her words. \"I'd better get home now.\" Jim gave Judy's hand a final squeeze. \"I'll see you tomorrow.\" \"Goodbye, Jim,\" said Judy. She opened the door for him, and her expression told him that she wanted to kiss him goodbye, but didn't dare do it in front of her mother. He gave her a little nod and slid through the narrow opening she had made for him. It felt silly starting up his car just to drive it a few yards to his own garage, but he did it anyway. But wait... there was a strange car in the driveway. He pulled up beside the car and looked it over. It was a simple brown sedan, not flashy but probably reliable. What he could see of the interior looked clean. Jim went on into the garage and parked. He came out and looked the car over again, not sure he wanted to go inside and see who the visitor was. He walked around it, finally backing away in the direction of the back door. He might as well face the music. He decided he shouldn't have been surprised when he saw Officer Ray Fremick in the sitting room with his parents and grandmother. The policeman stood when he entered. \"Hello, Jim.\" Jim looked at him and away—and at him and away again. \"Hello.\" \"I thought I'd stop by to see you. How are you?\" Jim opened his mouth to reply, but words didn't come out. He tried to find an answer, but he seemed unable to describe how he felt. He knew Fremick wasn't just asking about his health. \"Go on, Jim,\" his mother prodded. \"Answer him.\" \"Just a minute, Carol,\" said his father, Frank. \"It's not so simple.\" \"I'm sorry,\" said Fremick. \"Of course it's not an easy question right now. Jim, I just wanted to remind you that you're still welcome to come by the station if you want to...\" \"I did.\" Jim hadn't really meant to say it; it came out before he even thought about it. No one said anything, so he added, \"I came by and you weren't there.\" \"I'm sorry I missed you. You can always call to see if I'm there; I'll give you my home number as well if you want.\" Jim didn't know what he wanted. Did it really matter now? Now that Plato was... \"If you don't,\" Fremick went on, \"I know of a few psychiatrists in the area who might be able to help you.\" His mouth twitched. And then there came the laugh he couldn't stop. \"Jim,\" his grandmother scolded. \"You mean a headshrinker, right?\" Jim said. \"Plato went to one... he said it was too expensive, so his mom took a vacation instead.\" Everyone went stony silent again. Jim looked Fremick in the eye long enough to ask, \"Does she know?\" \"Plato's mother?\" asked Fremick. \"Yes, we notified her. She's coming home tomorrow.\" He paused. \"The funeral will be Monday.\" \"Jim, won't you sit down with us?\" Carol asked, clearly uncomfortable because their guest felt obligated to stand. Jim didn't want to sit down, but neither did he want to explain why, so he ignored her. \"What about his father?\" \"We've been unable to locate him. His mother said she hasn't seen him since Plato was very young.\" \"Didn't he have any letters, or a picture or anything?\" \"An officer cleaned out his locker yesterday. There was only one photo, and that turned out to be of Alan Ladd.\" \"The film star?\" Jim found himself chuckling again. \"Well, of course. I knew he'd want a picture of his father...\" \"Jim,\" Carol interrupted, \"you know that Alan Ladd can't have been his father! Won't you be serious?\" Jim managed to sober. \"I only meant... Plato made up stories about his father. Why not pretend he was someone famous?\" \"Anyway, there wasn't anything to help us find Mister Crawford,\" Fremick concluded. \"But once his mother has looked through everything, I wouldn't mind if you did too, Jim. Just to see if there's anything you wanted to keep.\" It got quiet again. Jim started counting every time he breathed in and out. He blinked several times. \"Yeah, maybe,\" he said at last. \"All right. I'll be in touch, then.\" Fremick got out a card and pen and wrote a number on the back of the card. \"Here. That's my home number on the back.\" Jim took the card and shoved it into the pocket of his blazer. Fremick took a small step closer and put his hand on Jim's shoulder. \"Don't forget, you can call or drop by any time.\" Words were stupidly difficult to form sometimes—definitely not worth the effort. Jim tipped his chin down slightly and then back up. It would have to do. \"I'll walk you out,\" Frank said, standing up. \"Dad,\" Jim said, and he was unable to say more. His voice was dangerously close to cracking already. \"Or... Carol will see you out, won't you, dear?\" Frank amended. Carol stood. \"It was good of you to stop by,\" she said, leading Fremick back toward the front door. \"You could have been a bit more polite,\" Mrs. Stark said to Jim once Fremick was out of hearing. \"Mother,\" Frank said, turning to her, \"I'm going to have to ask you to be quiet or leave the room.\" The matron closed her mouth with a bitter expression. Frank turned back to him, taking his son gently by the shoulders. \"Jimbo? It's going to be all right.\" Jim sighed and looked away. Breakdowns were horrible. He didn't want to have another one. Especially not in front of his grandmother. \"Come on, son.\" Frank led him to the stairs. Jim marched mechanically. They got all the way to his room, and he didn't remember going there. He sat on his bed and leaned forward, sighing and rubbing his hands together. Frank sat beside him. \"Do you... want to talk about this? Any of it?\" Jim shook his head. \"All right... well... Do you have any homework?\" \"Left it at school. I'll catch up over the weekend.\" His father was probably less than satisfied with that answer, but he didn't say so. \"All right,\" he said again. \"You can stay up here if you want to... I'll get you for dinner.\" He stood up. \"Dad,\" Jim said, standing beside him. Frank turned back and hugged him. Jim closed his eyes and for a moment held on as if his life depended on it. Then he took a deep breath and pulled away. Frank gave him a final pat. \"It'll be all right,\" Frank said quietly. Then he left the room, closing the door behind him. Jim sank onto the bed again. He could feel tears forming, even though he was trying hard not to think about anything. He couldn't stop them any more than he could stop the frustrated thoughts from rushing through his mind like an enemy army. Where were you? I went to the station to talk to you and you weren't there — if you had been, Plato might still be alive! A sob escaped, and then the tears made their bid for freedom. Jim put his face in his hands and let them come, one after another after another. Sorry to leave off on such a depressing note. Leave me some feedback please. :) ","Summary":" Could have more chapters if anyone shows interest; I've been extremely busy lately (ergo the lack o"},{"Movie":"Rebel Without A Cause","Title":"The World Ends at Dawn","Author":"Sophia Hawkins","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5325731","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The World Ends at Dawn Jim felt half awake and half asleep; half alive and half dead. He could also feel himself trying to swerve to one half more than the other, but right now he couldn't tell which one he was headed for. He tried to listen to the minister speak about Plato at the funeral on that gray, cloudy, dreary afternoon, but it was just noise, no words, no coherence, no meaning. At one time he could look and see Plato laying in the coffin, looking peaceful for the first time since he'd met the kid; but he also looked around the cemetery and saw everybody else who was there. Plato's nanny, his own parents, Grandma, Judy, some of the other kids from school. It wasn't a big turnout for Plato's life. His parents had been contacted by the police the morning after he died and the funeral had been held off for a few days to give them time to come, but they never did. Not really wanting to draw attention to what he was doing, Jim glanced up at the sky and saw the dark clouds. Oh they just hung in the air, looming, threatening to open up but they never did. He wished it would rain. There was nothing else that could be done to make everybody, himself included, feel any worse about being out here at the cemetery again than they already felt. Thinking back, Jim recalled the conversation he and Plato had had at the planetarium. \"Do you think the end of the world will come at night time?\" \"Uh-uh, at dawn.\" Why did Jim have to be correct? He didn't even mean anything by it when he said it, but it certainly had come true in the way that he said. Faintly, he could hear Judy's sniffs and sobs as she tried to keep from breaking down entirely. Glancing over through the corner of his eye he saw her, her cheeks wet, her eyes pink, all the while she kept a steady hold on the small camera she had brought with her and snapped a picture of Plato. Some people had thought it was in poor taste but she and Jim had agreed that if the people at the funeral home could make him look good enough for an open casket funeral, they would get a picture of him when he looked like he was just asleep. This was the second funeral they'd attended in one week. Buzz's funeral was three days before. His had to be a closed casket ceremony; all his friends came and throughout the whole event they glared at Jim as though he was responsible. He knew he wasn't, he was involved, as they all were, but he didn't kill Buzz. And yet, now as he looked at Plato in these last few minutes before they lowered him into his grave, Jim wondered how much a role he played in this untimely death. Nobody really stepped up to speak for Plato, though the housekeeper did keep going on about how her poor baby never had anybody in the world that cared for him. She kept telling everybody how John's father had left them and his mother had gone to Hawaii, and left him all by himself on his birthday. His birthday. Jim shook his head and swore, Plato died a day after turning a year older. What kind of cruel trick was that for fate to play on a person? Trying to forget about it, he remembered another cruel trick fate had done to all of them. At Buzz's funeral, his parents had been there, naturally both were about delirious with grief, they had just lost their only son. Sometime during the funeral, Buzz's father, a big, burly man, came over to Jim and grabbed him and started screaming at him, blaming him for Buzz's death. \" Get your hands off of my son!\" He had hardly recognized the voice at the time, but it belonged to his own father. His father, who he had never seen lose his cool before in all his life, grabbed this much larger man and knocked him cold right in the jaw. Buzz's father shut up after that, and everybody quieted back down, but nobody could believe that Frank Stark, who had been a quiet and passive man for most of his life, actually had it in him to punch another man. Especially not during the funeral of the man's own son. If Jim had ever figured anybody in his family had it in them to clock a large man, it would've been his mother, or maybe even his grandmother, they could both be very mean. That in mind, Jim looked back and saw his mother and grandmother. They stayed back from everybody else, close to the gates. His mother was dressed in a respectable black dress with a black veiled hat. Grandma on the other hand was wearing a fur coat over her dress and looked like she was on her way to a Hollywood cocktail party after the service. As far back as he could remember, Grandma always had the same look on her face. She never seemed to grow upset by something, just annoyed, bothered…that's how she looked now, like this whole funeral was an inconvenience for her. Well who asked her to come? In contrast, his mother actually looked sorry for Plato. He guessed even she couldn't be completely hardened by a kid dying, not when she had had to see it up close and personal. With Buzz it was different because she wasn't there, she didn't see his body, she didn't watch the car go over the buff. Remembering that scandalous event from Buzz's funeral, Jim couldn't help but laugh. He did it a couple of times but when he knew everybody was looking at him, he wiped his face in his hands and the laughs quickly became sobs as he started crying. What was going on? In one day, two boys had died, brutally, unnecessarily, and in one week, all who cared about them had come out to say goodbye to them. Judy went over to him and put her hand on his shoulder, when he turned away she rubbed his back comfortingly and said, \"It'll be alright, Jim.\" He shook his head. It would never be alright, he knew that. He thought back to the conversation he'd had with that officer at the police station the night they were all picked up. What was it he had said? I don't know what to do anymore, except maybe die. It sounded very appealing to him now. He wished he was dead, then he wouldn't be having to go through all this pain and misery. In a way he wished he was the one dead instead of Plato. Judy knew that they were going to bury Plato soon and asked Jim, \"Do you want to go over and say goodbye to him?\" He didn't want to but he knew he had to. Grabbing onto her hand for the courage to do this, he walked over to the coffin and looked at his best friend. He was dressed in a dark outfit like he usually wore, but it was highlighted by the flame red jacket that was lightly draped over his shoulders. It had somehow gotten discarded when they took him away so Jim and Judy went to the funeral home and gave it to the people working there, instructing them to put it on Plato before they released the body. Tears filled Jim's eyes as he looked down at this poor, lost, kid whose life had ended far too early. He couldn't say goodbye to him, even though he knew he had to. He couldn't say anything, there wasn't anything to say to him. In truth, he didn't want to say 'goodbye' so much as to tell Plato 'I'm sorry', but he couldn't even bring himself to say that much. Standing as close as he did to Plato, Jim saw that he was right, the people at the parlor had done a good job to make Plato look like he was just sleeping. Jim wanted to believe that was the case. What he wanted was to grab Plato and shake him and yell at him to wake up and quit playing this horrible trick on them. What he needed was for all this to be a horrible nightmare he would wake up from, but he knew he wouldn't. Jim felt his heart pounding like it would rip out of his chest, and suddenly he couldn't breathe. He pulled at his collar to loosen it from his neck but everything he saw started to see stars and he collapsed alongside the casket. He heard, only vaguely though, people calling his name as he felt them rushing over to him. The last voice he heard as everything he saw turned to black, was his father's. About unconscious, Jim turned over and saw his father hovering over him. Frank Stark in his black suit and hat, a worried look on his face, grabbed at his son and tried to get his attention. Jim heard his father vaguely, as if he were underwater and his father was standing on the dock calling at him, \"Jim, are you alright? Answer me, Jim, can you hear me?\" Everything turned to black and Jim laid his head back against the ground, and suddenly everything became still and quiet.[Chapter 2] Jim turned on his side and felt a tear that he hadn't felt in his eye, slide down his face and run down along the side of his nose. That was when it occurred to him that he had been asleep. He opened his eyes and looked around and saw he was in his darkened bedroom. Had it all been a dream? No, he knew it wasn't… He heard somebody's footsteps out in the hall and he looked to the door, hoping to catch a glimpse of whoever was coming by. \"Mom?\" The figure in the hall stopped and even in the dark, Jim could see his father sticking his head into the room, \"Jim, how're you feeling?\" \"What happened, Dad?\" Jim asked, feeling very confused and nervous right now. Frank walked in, closed the door behind him, leaving it only slightly ajar and turned on the lights. \"Don't!\" Jim cried as he put his hands up over his eyes. As quick as they came on, the lights went off, \"Sorry, son,\" Frank replied as he went over to the bed, \"You gave us all quite a scare at the funeral today.\" Jim finally lowered his hands as it hit him, \"I missed it?\" \"No,\" Frank assured him as he sat at the foot of the bed, \"You…I really don't know what happened…I think you passed out, right before they were going to…\" \"Bury him,\" Jim said, feeling the tears stuck in his throat, muffling half of his words as he spoke. \"We tried calling the doctor to have him come out and look at you to see if you were alright,\" Frank explained, \"But he won't be able to come until tomorrow.\" Jim didn't know what to say and he didn't bother trying. He still felt like this was nothing more than a bad dream that he was trying to wake up from. He buried his face in his hands and shook his head from side to side, as if that would put an end to everything he'd been through. \"You slept through dinner,\" Frank told him, \"Are you hungry?\" \"No,\" Jim answered before he broke down and started crying again. Frank reached over and wrapped an arm around Jim's back and pulled his son over to him and gently rocked him for a minute. \"It's alright, son, it'll be alright,\" Frank told him, \"I know it doesn't seem possible now, but one day it won't hurt as much.\" \"Frank?\" they heard Carol's voice echo down the hall a moment before she came to Jim's room and looked in. \"Jim, are you alright?\" Jim raised a hand over his face and quietly asked his father to make his mother go away, but Carol refused to leave. Instead she walked over to the bed and reached out and lightly stroked through Jim's hair as she told him, \"I'm not running away from you, Jim…not anymore, I'm sorry.\" Jim wanted to crawl under the covers and disappear, he wanted to yell at both of his parents to go away, but he couldn't. He had been trying for so long to make them pay attention to him and to notice him, now they were finally around when he needed them, he couldn't send them away now even if he felt like it. He felt his mother's hands wrapped around the back of his head, stroking it lightly, as though she were afraid of hurting him. He also felt his father's arms wrapped protectively around him, stronger than he remembered, and it all only worked to make him cry harder than he had been. \"Jim, what's wrong?\" they asked him. Jim's tongue felt like sandpaper and his throat was so dry he could barely swallow. Still he managed to get out a few words among all of the ones he was thinking. \"…It's not fair…\" he choked and gasped on a sob before adding, \"Plato.\" \"We know that you miss him, Jim,\" Carol said. \"Yes, and it's alright that you do miss him,\" Frank added, \"And it's important that you remember him.\" Jim buried his face in his father's shoulder and groaned before managing to get out, \"But why am I the only one who does? Where are his parents to mourn for him? How could…\" he pulled back from his father to look both of his parents dead square in the eye as he asked them, \"How…what kind of parent doesn't come home for their own kid's funeral? How could they do that to him? How could they?\" He rested his head on his father's shoulder again and continued to cry for Plato, the poor lost boy who apparently nobody ever wanted. Jim lulled in and out of sleep again when he felt something touching his nose, like a bug or something. Without opening his eyes he swatted at it but missed, and it touched him again, this time he heard it giggling. Opening his eyes he saw Judy standing beside the bed, looking better today than she had yesterday. \"Hi, Jim,\" she said. \"Hi Judy,\" he replied, feeling oddly calmer now than he had last night, \"What're you doing here?\" Judy took in a long, slow breath, a sign that she still didn't fully trust herself not to start crying again either. \"I came to see how you were doing.\" \"Don't know,\" he replied, \"Doctor's going to make a house call on me today and check me out.\" \"Well how're you feeling?\" she asked. Jim grunted and waved off that question and fell back against the pillows. \"Hey Judy,\" he thought of something. \"Yes?\" \"What happened yesterday? At the funeral, what…what happened?\" Jim asked, \"I mean, did he look nice?\" Judy awkwardly looked down at the floor for a minute before nodding her head and answering, \"He looked just fine…\" \"Yeah, did you stay and make sure that they buried him?\" Jim asked. \"Yes, Jim,\" she answered. \"Yeah? Is it…did they put him in a nice place?\" \"Oh, very nice,\" she said, trying to assure him, \"It's very beautiful.\" \"Good,\" he tiredly responded, \"Good…it's the least he deserves for everything he's been put through.\" \"I got some nice pictures of it, I'll have them developed in a couple of days and then you can see,\" she told him. \"Poor kid,\" Jim said as he shook his head, \"I feel sorry for him.\" \"So do I,\" Judy said as she lightly ran her fingertips over his cheek. \"He needed us so much and I let him down,\" Jim told her. \"You didn't let him down, Jim,\" Judy said, \"You did what you could for him.\" \"Yeah, but it wasn't enough,\" Jim replied, \"He still died.\" Judy was nothing if not sympathetic, but she tried to be assuring as she told him, \"That wasn't your fault, Jim.\" \"No?\" he asked, \"Then whose was it? A kid doesn't die for no reason, somebody has to be at fault. It has to be somebody's responsibility Plato died, and if it's not mine, whose is it?\" \"Jim, don't beat yourself up over this,\" Judy pleaded with him, \"You're not his father.\" \"That's what he said,\" Jim remembered, he laid his head flat against the pillows and looked up at her and was pointing at her as he spoke, \"Do you remember? That night at the mansion, he said that I wasn't his father, that he didn't want me to be his father…and very shortly before that he did…remember, Judy?\" he asked as he sat up, \"He said 'gee if only you could've been my dad', what…what happened? What changed? What did we do wrong?\" Judy couldn't answer. ","Summary":" The World Ends at Dawn Jim felt half awake and half asleep; half alive and half dead.

It was a school day but he was kept home today because of his fever. His bedroom was dark and he had nothing to do except listen to the rain and thunder outside. Sitting up weakly, Jim picked up his cup of water and took a sip. He had to drink lots of liquids since he couldn't keep anything else down. After a couple more sips of cool water, Jim settled himself back down and buried his face into the extra pillows that his mother had brought for him. As if being sick wasn't bad enough, he was also in a depressed state mind – haunted by the recent death of his beloved friend Plato. A sad smile came to Jim's face as he fondly remembered his young, dark-haired companion. He closed his eyes and let his memory travel back… Plato. Just thinking about him made Jim feel warm all over. He remembered this one time when Plato kissed him. It happened when the two were standing outside Jim's house one evening. There was nobody else around. The two friends were talking to each other when suddenly, Plato leaned forward and kissed Jim on the lips. Stunned, Jim ended their conversation and went back inside the house. But he wouldn't forget that kiss in a million years. Jim was straight. No doubt about that. He loved Judy very much. Dear, sweet Judy. But he knew that Plato had a massive crush on him, and Jim was flattered by that. Who wouldn't be? Plato was certainly a very, very handsome boy. Oh God, his eyes…those big, beautiful, Sicilian brown eyes! The way those eyes would get so adorably big when he opened them wide. And the way they crinkled warmly at the edges when he smiled. And Plato's lips were uber warm and incredibly soft. Even softer than Judy's lips. Jim couldn't believe how delectable that boy's lips were. In only that quick smooth, Jim tasted a delicious sweetness and all the spices of Sicily. Those were lips to melt in your mouth. And that gorgeous, dark hair…Jim loved everything about it. He loved how soft it felt and how good it smelled. \"Rest in Peace, my friend,\" Jim said suddenly, his voice sickly and feeble. \"I hope you know that, no matter what …I will always love you.\" The End[Chapter 2] Jim Stark found himself back at the old mansion, standing at the top of the staircase. He looked downward and saw Plato clinging to the banister, smiling proudly up at him. Plato was looking ever so enchanting with his black hair, adorable grin, and big wet eyes. Jim smiled back and ran down stairs, jumping over the side of the banister and spinning his friend playfully in the air. A smiling Judy was sitting on the floor, watching them fool around. Jim was feeling practically playful today, so he locked one arm around his friend and started tickling him with the other. Plato yelped and sweet giggles poured from his throat. \" No, Jim! Stahahap!\" squealed the dark-haired youth. Jim found this too adorable and wanted to keep tickling him, but he had compassion and soon let up. Plato took a moment to catch his breath, then he beamed and gave Jim a tight hug. Smiling, Jim returned the hug but was taken by surprise when he felt Plato's fingers tickling on his sides. Jim exploded with laughter and sank down to his knees. \" I gotcha! I gotcha!\" Plato exclaimed happily as he tickled Jim into submission. \" I-I know!\" Jim chuckled, when Plato stopped to let him get a breather. Then Jim and Plato looked over at Judy and started advancing toward her, with wiggling fingers. \" Oh no, you don't!\" she said, jumping up and running away. The two boys laughed as they chased after her. Soon the boys got tired out and laid down on the floor next to each other, panting. When Judy saw them looking exhausted, she came out of her hiding place and joined them on the floor. \" I want to live here forever,\" Plato said wistfully. Jim and Judy looked at each other. \"I don't see why not,\" Judy spoke. \" Both of you will stay here with me, right? Forever?\" \" Well, what do you think?\" Jim reached out to ruffle his friend's hair. Plato rolled over onto his stomach and rested his chin in his hands. He closed his eyes and a peaceful smile came to his face. Life was now perfect. Jim woke up in his bed. It was all just a dream – a dream about how things were that night, before the monsters came. A tear rolled down Jim's cheek and hit the pillow. Plato was dead. Life would never really be perfect. Then in a flash of fury, Jim punched his pillow. Thinking about how things could have been was too painful for him. He buried his face in the pillow and sobbed. The End[Chapter 3] Jim was half-asleep when he heard a light knock on the door. His mother poked her head in and whispered, \"Are you sleeping?\" \"Who has time to sleep?\" muttered the young man, as he buried his face in the warm pillow. Mrs. Stark cleared her throat. \"You have a visitor.\" Jim glanced up and saw Judy standing beside his mother. He sat up quickly and motioned for her to come in. \"I'll leave you two alone,\" said Mrs. Stark, smiling at the young couple. Then she closed the door and went downstairs. Judy walked over to the bed and sat down. \"Hello, Jim. How are you feeling?\" Jim moaned softly and stretched. \"Mmm…I've had better days.\" Judy nestled up to him, laying her head on his chest. It felt good to be so close to the man she loved. Her best friend in the world. Still, they both had a burden on their minds. \"I dreamed about the mansion,\" Jim said, after a moment. \"I see,\" Judy replied. \"Plato was there.\" Judy hugged him tighter. \"Oh, Jim…\" \"It felt so real,\" Jim continued, trying to keep his voice from cracking. \"He was so close…I could see him and touch him. I felt his sweet breath on my face as we played together.\" \"He loved us, darling,\" whispered Judy. Jim put his arm around her, burying his lips into her brown hair. \"We loved him too…\" \"That's right, and we'll never forget him,\" Judy stated, firmly. \"You and I will work together to keep his memory alive. If we have a baby someday, we'll name him after Plato.\" \"I'll look forward to it,\" Jim answered, wistfully. The couple was silent for a moment, listening to rain tapping against the window. There was a low rumble of thunder in the distance. Jim sighed, resting his tired head on top of Judy's. \"I don't know what I would do without you,\" Jim said, softly. \"I'm not going anywhere,\" she replied, stroking his chest. \"You'll always have me to help you stay strong.\" For the next hour, Jim and Judy continued to talk. They reminisced, reclining together on the bed. They talked about the good times that they had with each other, and with Plato. Jim's fever began to hurt less, because of the joy that filled his heart; talking about the fun times with his friends did that for him. Finally, he got too sleepy to talk anymore. Judy decided that it was time for her to leave. \"Get well soon, darling,\" she said, kissing him gently on the lips. She then got out of his bed and left the room, closing the door behind her. Jim stared after her until his eyelids began to droop. He thought about Judy's kiss as he drifted back into dreamland. It reminded him of Plato's kiss... Except… It wasn't the same. Something about the way Plato had kissed him was unmatchable. Irreplaceable. He would never forget that kiss in a million years. He knew he loved Judy with all his heart, and he knew she loved him. But there something about Plato. Jim soon fell asleep, dreaming of his deceased friend once again. The End ","Summary":" Jim Stark lay in his bed with the blankets wrapped around his shivering body.

He threw it up, about to catch it with his open mouth when Darwin popped around the corner, caught his attention and caused the sweet to bump right into the rookie's tuft. \"What are you doing there,\" the red guinea pig questioned, a critical eyebrow raised as he put a biting emphasis into the last word, \"Bro?\" Startled the white-brown giant tried to swipe the pastry out of this fur, which proved hard, yet not as hard as finding an explanation. \"I… just- I… uh…\" Darwin tilted his head as he impatiently tapped his right foot. \"We're guinea pigs, Darwin,\" Hurley sighed, \"Saving the world is totally cool and all, but…\" he slumped down, glancing up at the commander with pleading eyes, \"We need some cake and cuddles once in a while.\" The red guinea-pig remained disinterested and wordlessly urged his fluffy – not fat – companion to go on. The big one gave a weak sigh, before he forced himself back onto his feet. He was getting better on at least that everyday, but he still looked rather clumsy. \"Nooow?\" Darwin insisted. \"I'm just the rookie, man! Give me a break. Give ma a cuddle.\" The red commander pulled back, shook his head disapprovingly and left Hurley where he was. The fuzzy one let his head fall and glanced up at Marcie who was just working on something, her back turned on him. Sapless Hurley dragged himself over to the edge of the table, making himself look pathetic in an attempt to beg for cake, but really anything was fine for him at the moment. He looked at his human-friend for a moment and then removed his gadget. Sure the unusual animalistic squeaks would get her attention. And it did. She turned around, spotting the culprit. \"Hurley,\" she cooed, \"You lost your language decoder.\" When she lifted it from the desk, ready to re-attach it, Hurley backed away from her hand, and instead tried to make himself look cute with the best puppy eyes he could manage. He had gotten a lot of practise in this from the pet shop, and yet it had never worked well enough for anyone to pick him out from all the ones that had been on sale. \"Cakes. Cuddles. Cakes. Cuddles…\" Hurley repeated these little words like a magic formula for eternal bliss, and he didn't care if any of his cavy-pals would come around the corner right now and gawk. He was sure that even if they spoke his language, that they still wouldn't understand. Probably none of them had ever been cuddled before in their whole lives. Having a few problems first, since Marcie had gotten so used to the language decoder, the woman soon deciphered herself what the fluffy one intended. She carefully lifted him up like a little baby and Hurley, pressing close to her body, rewarded her with the highest response of all – the purring. Now if she somehow managed to get the cake from his back and give it to him – he'd be in heaven. If just this once; it was all he'd ever wanted. The strange sound of contentness didn't stay unheard by his team members and soon Darwin peeked around the corner again, spotting how Marcie was tickling Hurley's ear. Shaking his head with an unnoticed smile the red cavy decided to leave him be – just this once.

Blaster was playing DDR, Juarez was editing her blog on her computer, Hurly was looking through a dessert cook book, Speckels was working on a program, and Darwin was looking for Nickki who had seemed to disappear. That was odd for him. Nickki rarely left his room, and whenever the team can back from a mission, he would stand in his doorway and ask with a smile how the mission went. He didn't do that after this mission. Plus wherever he went he would take his iPod with him. Darwin found the iPod on his bed paused to a song called \"Without You\". Darwin had heard it once but didn't really pay attenion to it. He picked it up and continued to look for the missing team member. Laying in the afternoon sun with his body streach out as far as it could be on one of the window sills was where Darwin found him. Nickki is a white blonde guniea pig that has multi-colored bangs that cover his right eye and in the middle of his back was a multi-colored music note. As the leader approch him, one of his ears flicked in that direction. He rolled onto his side and opened his eyes halfway. Curiose chocolate brown eyes meet tired gold eyes. \"How did the mission go?\" Nickki asked in a soft voice and with a sleepy smile. Darwin gave a soft smile in return. He sat down next to the sun-bathing guniea pig. \"He got away again.\" There was a hint of disappointment and anger in his voice. The smile left his face as he thought about the mission. \"You shouldn't be disappointed or angry. He has always been good at escaping the eyes of the government.\" The softness never left. Darwin looked at him to see he was on his belly with his head laying in his arms and was still looking at him through half-ladden eyes. The smile was still there also. \"He'll make a mistake like he did last time, and you'll be there to catch him.\" \"How do you know he'll make a mistake? He could have learned from the last mistake he made.\" \"He didn't.\" \"How do you know that?\" \"I just do.\" Nickki closed his eyes and turned his head in the other direction. Darwin knew that this was a touchy sublect for him but if he knew something about the guy. The brown and white guniea pig sighed as he looked down at his lap. Nickki's ipod! Maybe he would open up a bit more if he was listening to music. Darwin looked over at his team mate and saw that he was watching him through half-lidded eyes. He turned his head forward in embassment. Thank god that a blush doesn't show through fur. Even if the fur is white. Nickki thought with a small smile. A headphone was suddenly dangleing in front of his eyes making him jump in surprise. \"I saw that you left your ipod on your bed. I thought that you might like to listen to something else after listening to nothing but silence for who knows how long.\" \"I'm still not going to talk about him.\" Darwin blinked in shocked. He knew and there was no hint at all. \"Your good.\" A smirk was the response he got back. He stuck the other headphone in his ear and waited for Nickki to put his in. He then hit play on the musical device and the simple rhythem flowed into his ear. I like when you whisper softly Things only I should hear That lead me on Darwin thought of Juarez for some reason. He honestly liked her but that was probaly because she was the only female on the team and the only one he had ever seen. She was one of a kind but he knew they all were. He sighed in confusen and listened to the rest of the song. I like the way that you smile at me And make me feel like nothin' Can go wrong Nickki thought about the two guniea pigs that had his heart torn in two different directions. They both made him feel safe but one of them made his heart jump into his throat when he is around him alone. Which one is it? He listen to the rest of the song in hopes of it helping him. Tell me this will last forever Don't you ever leave They both sighed at the same time in confusen and frustration. I dont wanna be without you dream without you walk without you talk without you baby Darwin thought back to the all of the past missons he was paired with Juarez. He smiled lightly. It always was fun with her around. Even when they were traing she made it more interesting. Was what he feels when hes around her love or just a passing crush? Never take a chance without you Dance without you Nothing is the same without You baby Nickki thought of one guniea pig that fit most of this song and he was worried. What a relationship do to their friendship? I could never deal witout you Heal without you Begin without you End without you At the same time again they sighed but this time in thoughtfulness. Baby, Im in need I can't breathe No, I don't wanna be... Without you Nickki turned his head to the side and saw Blaster and Juarez coming their way. His eyes connected with Blaster's rich copper eyes for a split second. Then Blaster smiled a smile that was only reserved for him. He quickly turned his head to face Darwin so he could tell him they were coming and so his heart would stop trying to break out of his ribcage. I love when your eyes wash over me With a look only I can tell Whats on your mind Did I really just see that? Blaster thought as he blinked in surprise. Was Nickki's cheeck's a cherry blossom pink? That can't possabile. I'm just seeing things. He watched as Darwin talked to Nickki with a conceren look. Right?

Hurley began sobbing as he face his own Fate. The team struggled more then ever to escape. \"Apologizes sir, In case if any of the Team members become recalcitrant, There are anesthetic machines below the table to help contend with their resilience.\" Ben explained to the Investigators.

Then the Investigators began banging on the door as they cried. \"LET US OUT BEN, I WILL RIP YOUR SPINE OUT OF YOUR BACK!\" The two officers had passed out from the neurotoxic gas. The Air vents ventilate the room before Ben comes inside the Room. Ben grabs the 4 members and put them in one cage as he made his escape with a getaway car. Darwin wakes up from the shaking of the Vehicle. \"Ben! What's happening!?. Why are the police after us? This must be a misunderstanding, we have to talk to them and convince them that you work for the FBI!\" \"They aren't after you! Darwin!. They are after me!\" Ben fanatically replied while driving at full speed. \"I don't believe you.. You wouldn't hurt anybody would you?..\" Ben opens the Cage and furiously takes Darwin to show him the Side mirrors. \"LOOK AT IT DARWIN. DO THEY LOOK LIKE POLICE TO YOU?.\" Ben yells at Darwin.. Darwin had observed that there also black Ferrari cars that were along together with the police in the chase. … \"I think we lost them..\" The car suddenly stopped as they heard a pop sound. \"Ben.. Are you alright?..\" Darwin asked. \"Thanks a lot Darwin, We've hit a car spike.\" Ben sighed. \"But, how is it my fault?\" Darwin asked with a puzzled face. \"You didn't take the tracker out of you\" Ben argued\" Darwin sat in utter confusion while Ben thinks up a plan of how to escape the situation. \"Oh wait you can't, It's implanted in your Brain\" \"BEN DO SOMETHING!?\" Darwin cried. \"Hold on, I'll try to Connect to the WIFI\" Ben replied \"Ben!, come on.

Because Papa knows what he is doing, alright?\" Ben tried to put a smile to his Daughters. The electricity stopped and the Four comrades came out of their chambers. \"What.. Happened.\" Darwin realizes that his size changed. \"I feel.. Tall\" Darwin utters. \"Look guys!, Ben became suddenly short!\" Hurley laughed. \"Ben didn't become short, We became tall\" Juarez answers Hurley. \"Papa!, They are as tall as you!\" Penny Exclaimed. \"Yes I know.. Ben sighed.\" An explosion was heard at the ceiling. \"Shit. We don't have much time left.\" Ben said in frustration. \"Alright guys. Take Penny with you inside the Time machine!\" There was banging at the Door. BEN LAY DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND SURRENDER IMMEDIATELY. He starts up the machine, scrambling with the computer. \"NO! PAPA!, YOU CAN'T STAY HERE!, YOU'LL BE DEAD!.\" Penny sobs. \"Don't worry penny!, I'll fix this\" \"BEN!, I'LL STAY!… GO WITH YOUR DAUGHTER!\" Darwin cried. I'm sorry Darwin. I have to fix this. The machine has already progressed to 80% \"Darwin.. Promise me one thing. Just take care of my Daughter.\" Darwin was speechless as his Eyes were covered with tears. The Machine fully Progressed. With no doubt Ben pulled the lever and wishes his last goodbyes to the Team and his Daughter. A bullet went through Ben's Skull leaving his smile of hope fixed to his face. Penny cried for her father and Juarez hugged her then watched the lifeless Ben fall down to the ground.

Technology, it was a no-brainer to him. Who would have known that one day it got the better of him? A harsh tug ripped the chip from the gadget and in one sweep was cleanly scratched by long and trained claws so that it would do no more harm. He had been so blind… not only because he lacked his glasses. Therefore his hearing had been all the better. \"I'm not quite done,\" Speckles stated before his visito- visitors revealed their presence. \"Well,\" Juarez, \"We thought you might want some company?\" The mole remained stiff for a moment until Darwin walked up to him and ripped the chip out of the next gadget. It proved to be of no danger anymore since the system was down. Speckles glanced over at him, blinking with an expression that the red guinea-pig found hard to read. Darwin, however, put a paw on his black friend's shoulder. \"I told you we're family, right?\" The mole gave a weak jerk and turned back to the next device, sniffling the air nervously. \"Don't make it worse than it already is.\" For a second the three guinea pigs exchanged a lost glance when a strange noise reached their ears. \"Sorry I'm late!\" it called and as the four small animals turned around they spotted a blur of brown and white rushing into their direction. The new cavy carried a piece of cake in his paws and almost stumbled over his own feet. \"Hurley!\" Darwin called, \"This really isn't the time for-\" SPLAT! \"Sorry,\" the big fur-ball bit his lip as Blaster and Juarez fought away some giggles. \"Hurley…\" the red guinea-pig hissed venomously, cream and biscuit dripping from his fur. The one addressed hid his paws behind his back, guiltily playing with the shaggy fur. \"This was for Speckles, actually,\" he explained, \"But it suits you almost better.\" At this Blaster burst out laughing, challenging the commander's nerves. Biting back a grump, Darwin wiped the not particularly healthy food out of his fur and tossed a paw-full over at the black cavy. The mole immediately ducked for cover. Stopping his outburst, Blaster removed the sweet from his fur and took a bite of it. \"That's good, Hurley. What is it?\" \"Strawberry cream!\" the fluffy one answered and took a chunk off from Darwin, who responded with a hopeless sigh. With the new load, Hurley then crawled down to meet up with Speckles. To him after all, it shouldn't have been any matter how the cake looked ; it still smelled great and tasted all the better. Hurley quickly demonstrated that for him and gave the mole an – empty – hand to come out from below the machine. Speckles only reluctantly got back to his feet. \"I…\" what was he supposed to say? \"It's okay,\" Juarez cooed and playfully ran a claw through their commander's new cream-skin, who then decided to shake the pastry off. \"Bucky almost found it,\" the fluffy cavy explained, \"I saved it from him for you.\" \"Looks like this mission's aborted,\" Darwin stated, attempting to keep his voice perfectly dry. \"Well if you're so crazy about it,\" the mole then spoke up freely for the first time and was immediately confronted with the cake's remains. Not bothering to wipe the present from his face, Speckles found himself giving off a genuine laugh, the first since a long, long time; and his team, his family , was all too glad to join in.

The group has been traveling all day. The mountain path seems endless, and Severac feels no closer then when they had begun their journey three days ago. Behmen and the other men chatter at the front of the wagon. Inside her prison, the witch-girl, Anna, stares out to the scenery of the forest, from which they had just barely escaped from. She lets out a sigh. the thought of arriving to the abbey puts an immense amount of stress on her. She knew the end was near, at least that's what she told herself. This was her last and only chance of ever being free of Him . The dark creature that lived within her shoul; and He took every chance to remind her of why she was accused of witchcraft, and why He wanted her to be delivered to Severac. There is something on the ground that catches her eye. It is small, but it doesn't belong with everything else around it. She scrawls to the other side of the cage to get a better look. In the long, light green patch of grass, a rose is blooming. It is fall; not the time of year for a flower like that to be blooming. And something is very special about the rose- it is a light blue. Anna is mystified by the color. Never before has she seen anything so unusual, so beautiful. Her eyes are locked on it, she cannot avert her gaze. Then she hears Behmen's voice. \"All right, let's get moving.\" he says. From behind, Anna hears a horse neigh. Behmen walks in front of her. \"Wait.\" she calls to him. Behmen glances over at her. He is blocking her view of the flower. she leans sideways and when she sees it, she points. \"That rose,\" she tells him. \"Give it to me.\" Behmen looks behind him. He spots the rose, the looks back at Anna. she is still peering at it. Shrugging, he walks over and picks the rose. He inspects it; its blue shade interests him. When he has had his fill, he comes back over to the cage and hands the flower to Anna. She gently takes it from him. Behmen gets back on his horse. The wagons tarts moving again. Anna's head bobs with the rhythm of the cage. She twirls the beautiful rose. It speaks to her. Not with words, but she feels it is trying to send her a message. It says that everything will be okay. The road to Severac is dark, but light will be shed on it. There will be struggle, but every success must have its hardship. She smiles lightly. She remembers when her mother had once told her a story about an strange blue rose that had been found long ago. Her mother explained to her that a blue rose signified something that was not meant to be. She thought her mother had made it up; there was no way a rose could be blue. But now Anna thinks differently. She has seen one with her own eyes. \"Something that is not meant to be.\" she mumbles to herself. Perhaps it mean that He would not be able to plunge the world in darkness. Perhaps this is good luck. Perhaps... Perhaps she has no need to fear. If her woman's intuition is correct, then this flower is a sign from God that the dark forces are not allowed to destroy His beloved creations. She closes her eyes in thought, and lets out a relieved sigh. ","Summary":" \"We'll take a break now.\" Behmen tells everyone. The group has been traveling all day.

Nothing against them, it's just depressing when practically everybody (including my favorite character!) dies. Warning: implied PTSD, brief mentions of violence and alcohol abuse Pairing: Behmen/Anna AKA The Witch if you squint and tilt your head He should be happy. Felson had demanded that the cardinal of Marburg dismiss all charges against them in exchange for transporting the so-called 'witch' to Severac; after completing their mission they're allowed to go on their way without the threat of arrest for deserting the Crusades hanging over their heads - not that Behmen cares much whether he's thought of as a knight or deserter, hero or rogue. He's just glad to be free of the church and far away from its 'holy' wars. His problem is that, no matter how far from the battlefield he goes, he can never truly leave the Crusades behind. For years he's fought and killed in God's name, but he no longer believes it was God's will that everyone the church deemed infidels be slaughtered. Stripped of his conviction that what he did was for the best, Behmen can't even be proud of his victories in battle anymore; instead he now sees the Crusades as nothing more than mindless butchery, and knows he is no better than a murderer. He thinks Felson feels the guilt also, but it's hard to tell. No weight ever seems to stay long on Felson's mind while he has women and drink to distract him - and they are good distractions. Behmen makes use of both more than he cares to admit, yet can find no respite from the nightmares that plague his sleep. Night after night, he finds himself unable to close his eyes without images of his final battle appearing behind his closed lids. Sometimes he thinks it strange that he had only a fleeting glimpse of the girl before she fell to the ground, but still she is indelibly fixed in his memory - her eyes wide in pain and terror, her blood-dripping mouth open in a silent scream, his sword plunged deep into her chest. He can still remember that moment in perfect detail, and he relives it each and every night. Sometimes he thinks the nightmare won't stop even after he wakes. When that happens, then he will know he has truly gone mad. There are other times when Behmen's nightmares of the Crusades are interrupted, when he thinks of her instead. He never knew her name until they reached Severac; it was only after a harrowing battle with the demon that had possessed her that he found out she was called Anna. He knew her only for a short time, but he will always remember her. She is the girl he saved, his one good deed. In his darkest moments, he forces himself to think of the way she looked at him after the fighting was done - when she awakened on the stone floor of the abbey, confused, disoriented, and frightened at finding herself lying naked among strangers, his eyes had been the first she had met and held with her own, and she knew that he was her savior. And he knows that there is someone (besides Felson) who sees him as more than a rogue with blood on his hands. One night, he jolts awake from yet another nightmare of the countless people he's killed and, unbidden, thinks of the day after Eckhart's death, when Anna saw how deeply the senseless loss of life troubled him and reached out from her cage, offering solace even though her predicament was much worse than his. Allow me to ease your pain, she'd said. He wonders what would have happened if he had taken her hand. So...my first SotW fic! Not sure what to say about it except that it was begging to be written, and since I thought the movie was WAY underappreciated I complied with my muse's urgings.

Now on a journey home with Kay, Anna thinks about the fallen men who had taken her to Severac. It had been a long three days; to Anna it seemed much longer. It seemed as if the whole journey to Severac had been a dream. Her actions had not been her own at that time. Deceiving the party of men, running away from them, pretending to be innocent one moment and evil another, playing with Beheman's head… all of it was the demon's work. Anna looked at the graves that she and Kay had made to honor Beheman and Felson's noble deaths. Indeed they had been noble- although deserters of the Crusaders, no one else would have dared to accept such a task as to take an alleged witch to be trialed at a faraway monastery. \"They only show two deaths…\" she whispered. \"What?\" Kay asked. \"The graves. They only represent two deaths. There are five deaths we should be honoring.\" Kay nodded his head in understanding. He looked at Anna with a look of emptiness. It shook her as she read it- he felt painfully lonely now that the others, the only people he felt belonging with, were gone. \"They are gone,\" Kay said, \"but they will live on in our hearts.\" Kay helped Anna onto her horse. She looked back at the graves one last time. Thoughts of the men, especially Beheman, filled her mind. Yes, Anna had felt a special relationship with Beheman. Maybe it had just been the demon's plan from the start, but she felt flattered that Beheman was so focused on proving her innocence. For so long, no one would take her side. She had taught herself to live with all the hatred from everyone else, courageously taking it in and not saying a single word of it. She may have even fallen in love with the man, given the circumstances. But even if those feelings had reached Beheman, it wouldn't have been possible. They lived in two completely different worlds. Only by chance had they met in the cell blocks of the church that day. She turned away. They bumped their heels to the sides of their horses and the horses neighed and began to walk. Neither of them said anything for a while. The silence was ominous as the events that had taken place earlier played endlessly in their heads. The never ending struggles and the heated emotions. Not to mention the buried emotions. Kay felt the aftermath of guilt from his inability to do more for the group. Although he had banished the demon in the end, he had done almost nothing along the way. Perhaps he had even been a negative influence. He looked over at Anna, who was into her own thoughts. Suddenly, a new emotion welled up inside of him. It was anger. He definitely knew that the demon had been the one who constantly interfered with everyone's sanity, but one thing about that still could not be dismissed completely- the actions were still, in a sense, Anna's. And so, Kay still had a hint of distrust and hatred. But now he tried to push those feelings aside. The demon was gone now, so he should have no reason to continue being angry. Anna was thinking the opposite of this. She believed that Kay should be angry with her. After everything that had happened, she could do nothing for herself or for the group. If she wasn't so weak, if she had been able to control the demon, perhaps none of the events that took place would have happened. No one would have been killed. Everything would still be as it should have been. She wasn't sure why God would allow her to be so breakable. Se took a deep breath and concentrated on her self-loathing and her weaknesses, then let the breath out while letting go of the negative feelings. \"They sacrificed so much for you.\" Kay said, \"Beheman especially.\" \"I know.\" Anna replied. The comment made her feel guilty. Kay noticed the sorrow in her eyes and tried to reassure her, \"I didn't mean for you to think you did anything wrong. I was merely trying to make a point.\" \"And what point is that?\" she asked. \"It is obvious that Beheman felt sympathy when he laid eyes on you. Because how could a girl like you be a witch? But do you think the rest of us would have joined along if we didn't have some curiosity or worry about you?\" Anna said nothing, so he continued, \"Eckhart, for example—\" \"What curiosity or worry would he have to show?\" Anna interrupted, \"He was ordered by Cardinal D'Ambroise to accompany on the trip.\" Indeed he was, but maybe Kay had a point, \"But do you not remember the first night of the trip? Eckhart had said you reminded him of his daughter.\" Anna had a blank expression. \"And so he saw me as a remnant of his daughter.\" she commented, \"All I was was a mirror image?\" \"Perhaps,\" Kay answered, \"but I also believe that led Eckhart to strive to protect you, no? He wanted a second chance to care for someone he held dear.\" That made Anna smile. She thought it was a strange reason to want to protect someone, but she was flattered by Eckhart's decision. She remembered the times when he defended her and claimed she couldn't have been a witch because she was so young. \"And Felson.\" Kay continued, \"When I had told them of your saving me from falling off the bridge, all of them were, of course, surprised. But then I saw a look in Felson's eyes. His eyes were saying 'maybe she isn't an evil witch. Why would and evil person save someone who is working against them?' You were starting to gain his trust.\" Anna laughed. It was funny for her to hear that Felson trusted her, or even cared about her. He never seemed interested in the task of delivering her from the start, and he seemed only to glare at her the whole way to Severac. \"I never realized that anyone could have been less than an enemy to me.\" she admitted, \"But I know I didn't gain everyone's trust.\" Now Kay was the one who fell silent. He remembered the two members of the group who had always been suspicious of Anna- Hagamar and Debelzeq. \"Hagamar feared me.\" Anna pointed out, \"I don't think there was anything that could have changed that besides my proven innocence.\" Kay nodded. But Hagamar hadn't seemed to trust anyone in the first place. He was always jittery and nervous. \"And Debelzeq…\" Anna sighed, \"He just loathed me.\" There was no doubt about that. It seemed as if he was only accompanying them to watch Anna be pronounced a witch by the monks. She remembered how much she feared him. Even before he raped her, there had always been a glint in his eyes that scared her. He had never given up a chance to show how much he hated her. She wondered how he would have treated her now if he hadn't been killed by the demon. Days passed. The two made their way back to the village where the journey started. As the two rode closer to the village they were happy to feel the atmosphere of the Black Death's passing. Although many people were still infected, the horrid screams of pain had stopped. Kay rode into the mouth of the entrance. Then he stopped his horse and looked back at Anna when he realized she wasn't following him. \"What's the matter?\" Kay asked her. \"I'm… scared.\" Anna answered quietly, \"After all, I was the one who brought the plague to the land. I'm sure I will not gain the village's trust so easily.\" But Kay simply smiled in reply. He reached out his hand for hers. \"They will not trouble you when we tell them of the journey,\" he persuaded, \"and that you, only a young woman, could not have fought off the demon on your own.\" He was right; Anna wasn't able to fend herself from the demon, let alone banish it from the earth, had not Beheman and the others joined the picture. Anna took Kay's hand in hers and the rode into town- a new beginning. Afternote: It's not a really good fanfic. I was really rushing through it trying to get my ideas onto paper. I just really wanted to experiment on Anna's feelings on the whole situation. I accidentally hinted Anna/Beheman and Anna/Kay romance at times.

Colvin, not knowing what Juarez said took it as a compliment; \"Ooh, gracias mamacita\" said Colvin in a slick tone even though he didn't understand a word she said, now Colvin was a team player but he had an ego thrice the size of Texas. \"She totally wants me\" chuckled Colvin as Blaster and Darwin just had a good laugh at him but Colvin brushed them off and wanted to get better acquainted with the team. \"So, Colvin what do you have to offer the team?\" asked Darwin \"I can pick locks and I can hack a computer without any traces of me doing so\" replied Colvin Darwin shook his head in agreement as he did trust Colvin and his knowledge of computer hacking and lock picking, and being in G-Force was pretty cool by his standards. Colvin had a lot of training to endure but he had to first show them if he could actually pick a lock; \"Alright everyone, stand back and watch the master in action\" said Colvin They had set him up in front of a locked door and he had a lock picking kit, and that little guy went to work on the lock; \"Alright…come on…and….GOT IT\" said Colvin as he managed to unlock the door with no struggle at all, this really impressed Darwin. \"Nice lock picking skills, that's gonna be very valuable to the team!\" exclaimed Darwin Colvin felt proud that he was excepted by the team's leader but he still had his heart set on Juarez but she really wasn't that interested in him, she liked him as a friend and teammate but Colvin didn't really see it like that. Colvin, Blaster, Darwin and Juarez had headed back to their respected pens even though Colvin didn't have one he was hanging out with Blaster who had a [miniaturized] Xbox 360 in his pen; \"You play Halo 3?\" asked Blaster \"Do I? Heck yes!\" exclaimed Colvin as the two went off to play. Juarez had gone into her pen to update her Facebook status; \" We got a new member to the team…he has an ego bigger than his body, still he is cute but he has no shot\" Juarez had a little chuckle at her status and she began to just surf the web, browsing various sites and checking her emails and other stuff like that. Meanwhile Blaster and Colvin were having a blast playing Halo 3; \"Plasma Sword KILL!\" exclaimed Colvin \"Lucky stab, watch me drive this Banshee up ya butt!\" teased Blaster Darwin was just hanging out in his pen just listening to Blaster and Colvin playing each other in Halo 3 \"I'm playing winner!\" exclaimed Darwin \"Sure…I'll be ready in three more kills!\" exclaimed Colvin \"Scores tied bro!\" exclaimed Blaster Then Ben had came in the room, he looked very serious; \"Guys, no time for games we got a mission! OK here's the debriefing; I've learned of a counterfeiting agency named SPANK who have just recently stolen a money printer from the US Mint and are using to print fake money which they plan to use for the purchase of nuclear weapons, your mission is to put an end to their counterfeiting ring!\" exclaimed Ben \"Alright G-Force, we've got a mission and we're gonna bring those thieves to justice!\" exclaimed Darwin \"Ben, what do we know about said counterfeiters?\" asked Colvin \"From what I know the leader's name is Eugene Austen, but goes by the nickname Gene\" said Ben \"Hmmm…Eugene Austen, now why does that sound familiar?\" pondered Colvin as him and the rest of G-Force prepared for their mission to bring those fiends to justice. \"Alright Colvin, since you're new to the team here are the rules: 1) I'm the leader you follow my orders, 2) No recklessness, we're spies not vigilantes and 3) We've all got each other's backs out there because not only are we a team, we're a family\" said Darwin Colvin shook his head in agreement and was ready to head off with the team to get more debriefing on the alleged counterfeiters and where they were located.

With that being said Chapter 2 will be up real soon![Chapter 2] G-Force and Colvin were being debriefed on their mission when all of a sudden Darwin noticed that Hurley was missing; \"Hey guys, where's Hurley?\" asked Darwin \"Yeah I just noticed\" replied Blaster \"He's probably off training\" replied Juarez \"I know where I'd probably like to be with you\" smiled Colvin \" Punk poco egoísta (translation: little egotistical punk)\" whispered Juarez to herself Darwin was cross at Colvin; \"Colvin, pay attention to the briefing!\" exclaimed Darwin Colvin had done what he was told as he didn't want to anger Darwin. Ben began debriefing them on their upcoming mission; \"From what I know, Eugene Austen is a down on his luck ex banker who had gotten his greedy little hands on this machine, now he plans to hold the world ransom as he is going to purchase weapons of mass destruction unless the government pays him exactly 1.2 Billion Dollars\" said Ben and Colvin began to think to himself; \"Eugene Austen…jeez where have I heard that name before?\" wondered Colvin, and this had aroused some suspicion. \"Do you know him?\" asked Darwin \"The name rings a bell, I just remember hearing that name somewhere else and then my mind draws a blank from there\" replied Colvin Juarez and Blaster were equally confused but had to go on with their mission, and then without warning in panic was Marcie; \"HURLEY'S MISSING!\" she exclaimed \"Are you sure?\" exclaimed Ben Marcie shook her head yes but was panicking as she didn't know Hurley's whereabouts, and now the team had to chalk up another objective to the mission and that was to find Hurley. \"Alright team, to the van!\" exclaimed Ben \"You got it, come on team!\" exclaimed Darwin as they all headed to Ben's van. They had gotten into Ben's van and began to debrief them a little bit more; \"OK guys listen up, I did a little more research and we found him located in a underground warehouse underneath his home, the machine is there and the place is guarded so remember stealth is key!\" said Ben, as he drove into the area where Eugene's house was Colvin began to feel a sharp pain in his stomach, Darwin was concerned; \"Colvin, what's the matter?\" asked Darwin \"You look a little sick\" added Blaster \"Are you feeling alright?\" asked Juarez Colvin just brushed them off and nodded yes and just shook off his stomach pains as he had a mission to complete. \"Alright guys, be careful I wish you all the best! I will get the FBI once you have the info you need!\" exclaimed Ben \"How about we just call the FBI?\" suggested Colvin \"Evidence buddy, need solid evidence\" replied Ben The team exited the van and headed around the back of his house but there was loud music and partiers, Eugene was having a 4th of July Barbeque, which really stunk because there were a handful of people there but that didn't stop them so they figured they'd enter through the front door. \"Colvin, you may do the honors\" said Darwin as he pointed to the locked door \"You got it Darwin\" replied Colvin as he had gone to pick the lock; he began to hum the James Bond theme, which had gotten on Darwin's nerves; \"Please don't hum that…or the Mission Impossible theme\" said a stern Darwin \"You're no fun\" teased Colvin as he finished picking the lock and the team was in. \"Good job Colvin, alright team we've got to head to the basement but it's probably hidden so keep your eyes peeled\" said Darwin The team went off looking for the door that led to the basement when all of a sudden out of the blue a little girl with blond pigtails, blue eyes and braces came downstairs, instantly she recognized Colvin; \"COLVIN YOU'RE BACK! DADDY, DADDY!\" she exclaimed \"Oh shoot!\" exclaimed Colvin as he ran for his life; Darwin had overheard her scream of excitement \"What did that little girl mean when she said you're back? \" questioned Darwin \"Something's starting to come back to me…I remember an evil child strapping me to a bottle rocket, luckily I was able to chew through the ropes before I was killed\" replied Colvin as it all went blank from there for him, and some of his pains were starting to come back, he only had that one memory but then something else had started to come back to his mind, as he and Darwin searched for the door to the basement, Juarez too had shown concern for Colvin as she didn't want to see a fellow teammate in pain nor be distracted from his mission.

Also again for the love of God please don't complain about the spacing...THANK YOU![Chapter 3] \"Look guys I'm fin-\"and before Colvin could finish, he was swooped up by the little girl; \"GUYS FOLLOW HER!\" exclaimed Darwin as the team followed her up to her room but she slammed the door on them, Darwin was cross; \"Dang it, we gotta find a way in and rescue him!\" exclaimed Darwin as the team searched for an alternative way in, meanwhile Colvin was in trouble. \"So Colvin…you're back!\" squealed the girl \"Hey…Susan, how've ya been?\" he nervously asked and that made the little girl mad \"MY NAME IS KATHY!\" she exclaimed \"Oh…my…how you've g-grown…what're you now um…six?\" stuttered Colvin \"I'M NINE!\" exclaimed Kathy, Colvin was starting to get pains again. He began to remember all the pain and agony he endured in that very room alone. \"Now, you're back and guess what?\" exclaimed Kathy as she pulled out a bottle rocket and a lighter \"Oh dear\" said Colvin as his stomach began to ache again \"That's right, bottle rocket time!\" she exclaimed as she lunged at him but Colvin quickly dove out of the way \"No way, you're strapping me to that thing!\" exclaimed Colvin as he ran for dear life but he was limited to space as toys and clothes were strewn all over the floor. Colvin was backed into a corner but out of a vent came the team. \"GUYS THANK GOODNESS YOU'RE HERE!\" exclaimed Colvin \"Let him go\" said Darwin sternly Now of course Kathy wasn't going to just hand over Colvin but he had an idea \"Alright Kathy, you can strap me to that thing… IF you tell my friends where the basement is where your dad is hiding that money printer\" said Colvin \"Sure, take the closet door on the left, behind the door is a stairwell\" replied Kathy who gave up that info relatively quick, Kathy opened the door to let G-Force out but Colvin quickly escaped along with them. \"DANG IT COLVIN!\" exclaimed Kathy as she gave chase. The team located the closet and to their luck it was open, they ran down the stairs and saw that in plain sight was the money printer, and it was printing money. Stacks of it, there had to at least be millions. \"Uh…guys?\" called out a voice \"I know that voice\" said Juarez Darwin took a look to see Hurley \"HURLEY!\" he exclaimed Hurley was strapped to 4 M-80s (For those who don't know an M-80 is a quarter stick of dynamite, 4 quarter sticks…do the math) \"Hurley what happened?\" exclaimed Blaster \"Well, I was minding my own business when all of a sudden I was grabbed from behind and the next thing I knew I was here strapped to these m-80s\" replied Hurley Just then they heard footsteps, it was Eugene coming downstairs, he was on his cell phone; \"Uh-huh, OK understood Mr. S\" he said on his phone as he stood near the money printer, then he went to Hurley as the team watched; \"Well, well my little commodity if I don't get paid then you is going out with a…BANG!\" he said as began to laugh maniacally. \"Not on our watch\" whispered Colvin to the team \"OK, Colvin since you're good at hacking, I need you to hack Eugene's computer, and I'll rescue Hurley. Juarez, Blaster keep lookout!\" said Darwin as they did what they were told. Eugene left the machine as he had gotten a call from the mysterious \"Mr. S\" \"Alright sweetheart, I'm gonna hack you\" said Colvin as he inserted a flash drive into the computer and began to crack it from bank accounts to email passwords and everything. Darwin had gotten Hurley unstrapped from the M-80s and took him to safety; \"Oh thanks bro! I thought I was a goner!\" exclaimed Hurley \"We never leave a man behind\" replied Darwin Colvin was busy hacking the computer when he saw a message pop-up; \" Abort printing? Yes or No\" Colvin clicked \"Yes\" and the printer shut off, then Eugene came and saw Colvin at his computer. \"So Colvin, you're back huh?\" asked Eugene \"Yes…\" replied Colvin \"Listen Colvin, I taught you how to hack a computer, I never thought you'd…wait a sec WHERE'S THAT OTHER? YOU LITTLE BAS-\"but Eugene didn't get to finish as right on cue, Mr. S popped up on a TV monitor and guess who it was…Sparkles (as if you didn't know) \"What the heck? You mean my boss was a star nosed mole?\" exclaimed Eugene This didn't shock Darwin or the rest of the team \"Speckles…I knew I smelled a mole!\" exclaimed Darwin \"Yes Darwin…and now with my money, I shall purchase that nuke and me and Eugene will hold the world ransom for a hefty price!\" exclaimed Sparkles as him and Eugene shared a maniacal laugh. \"A nuke?\" questioned Colvin \"Yes, Colvin a nuke\" replied Eugene \"But…why?\" asked Colvin \"For years, I was laughed at! I was the butt of every joke at the bank, then I bought you…I wanted you to be evil which is why I taught you how to pick locks and hack computers and such, then my demon child of a daughter did the things she did to you, but now I'm gonna show everyone who laughed at me that I'm not a force to be reckoned with!\" exclaimed Eugene. Colvin, was displeased at Eugene, but then Colvin's stomach began to kill him again, it was Kathy running downstairs \"DADDY WHERE'S COLVIN?\" she exclaimed as she frantically searched for him even though he and the team and Hurley were hiding \"Oh no…here's comes the spawn of the Devil!\" exclaimed Colvin as he clutched his stomach, Juarez went up to him and the damnedest thing he began to feel better; \"Well when she came downstairs my stomach was killing me but then you came next to me and now I feel better, weird\" said Colvin \"Yeah Colvin, very weird\" replied Juarez (A/N) There went chapter 3, chapter 4 will be up soon. I don't know when though and also I know this story is going to be short next chapter may be the last but then again I never really write long fics anyways. Well keep on Reading, Riting and Reviewing! Also if you're one who searches for plot points which I've seen many a person do, save it! ","Summary":" \"Hey guys, meet the new member of G-Force; Colvin\" said Ben as he placed the all white guinea pig"},{"Movie":"G-Force","Title":"End of the line","Author":"Lightning in a bottle","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6260210","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is my first G-Force story. This will be my twelfth story altogether. I hope you like it. I got the bad guy's name from an Xbox 360 game. See if you can guess which one. Hint: Cybran. Ben walked into the room holding something behind his back. \"Hey guys come here!\" He called to the team. \"Do we have a mission Ben?\" Darwin asked. \"Well yes but I have something to show you first.\" Ben replied. Hurly walked into the room with a piece of pepperoni. Blaster and Juarez came in next. As usual, Blaster was begging Juarez to tell him who she was interested in. Juarez was good at not giving away her secrets. \"You're not getting anything out of me Blaster so you might as well forget it.\" She said. Blaster stared at her for a minute and then kept walking. \"That's cold.\" He said. The team stood in front of Ben. \"What do you have for us Ben?\" Blaster asked. Ben grinned and held out his hands. In them sat a white guinea pig with cinnamon colored spots. \"I'd like you all to meet Sugar. She's going to be a member of the team.\" Ben said. He set her down on the table. She stood up and walked towards the team. \"Howdy boys.\" She said with a thick, Australian accent. She looked at Juarez. \"What's up girl?\" She said. \" Hola .\" Juarez replied, a little unsure of how to treat this new member. Blaster couldn't take his eyes off of Sugar. \"Maybe you should wear a tighter shirt.\" He said. Sugar grinned. \"I don't wear shirts. And apparently, none of you do either.\" Blaster shrugged. \"You got me there.\" He said. Ben cleared his throat. \"Your mission, is to retrieve some data from a man named, William Gauge. We have reason to believe that he is in possession of a nuclear missile that he plans to launch sometime this month. You will be airdropped onto his roof via remote control helicopter. \"You go in, get the abort codes and the time of launch, and get out. Speckles tells me that the file is called, End of the line. You leave tomorrow afternoon. But for now, lets make our new friend welcome.\" The team had a party for Sugar, who absolutely loved all the attention she got from Blaster. \"So Sugar, you'll have to stay with one of us until we can get you a room of your own.\" Blaster said. Sugar smirked and raised an eyebrow. \"Are you offering?\" She asked. Blaster grinned. \"I just might be.\" He said. She is so hot! Blaster thought. I wonder if she likes Chinese food? Juarez walked up to Sugar with a serious look on her face. \"Okay, here's how it's gunna go. If you're going to be on the team, you have to do what either I, or Darwin says. Got it?\" She said. Sugar smiled and said. \"Relax. I know my place.\" Juarez walked away shaking her head. She's almost as bad as Blaster was when he first joined. She thought. Ugh! Another Blaster. We're doomed. Later, Blaster and Sugar were playing his mini Xbox 360. \"BOOM! Headshot!\" Sugar shouted. \"You got him on your first shot?\" Blaster asked in amazement. \"I always do.\" They were playing Call of duty world at war. They were taking turns playing the campaign missions to see who was faster. \"Dang.\" Blaster said. Sugar laughed and beat the mission. \"Your turn.\" She said. Juarez was on facebook. She was typing something for mer profile when Darwin walked in. \"What do you think about Sugar?\" He asked. \"She sure isn't sweet.\" Juarez said. Darwin grinned and shut the door. \"That's the first time I've heard you make a joke in a long time.\" He said. Juarez closed her laptop and faced Darwin. He's fixing to ask again I bet. She thought. \"Juarez this is the last time I'm going to ask you, and I am ordering you to answer me this time. Oh shoot! \"Who are you interested in?\" Darwin asked. Juarez sighed. \"Fine. If you really must know.\" She stood and looked him in the eye. \"You.\" She said. Then she walked out of the room and closed the door. Darwin stood there in the middle of the room. \"Well Darwin,\" He said to himself. \"Are you happy? You got her to tell you.\" Darwin left the room and closed the door. He found Juarez standing outside. \"Juarez?\" He said walking up to her. \"Do you really like me?\" He asked. Juarez looked at him. Her fur was waving in the wind. \"I follow orders Darwin. So you tell me.\" She said. Darwin smiled. \"Is that a yes?\" He asked. Juarez smiled. \"I said you tell me.\" She said. Darwin laughed quietly and started to move closer to Juarez's lips. Suddenly, Hurly came out. \"Hey Darwin, Juarez. Blasters hooking up the 360s for system link you want to come?\" He asked. Darwin sighed. \"Well finish this later.\" He whispered. \"Yeah we're coming Hurly.\" He said. \"Who's on who's team?\" Blaster asked when everyone was ready. \"I'll be with Juarez.\" Darwin said. \"Blaster since you're the best how about you be on your own?\" Blaster nodded. \"Alright, and Sugar, you can be with Hurly.\" He said. They played until midnight. Then they all went to bed. Sugar slept on Blaster's couch in his room. She was going to as to share the bed but Darwin told her that wouldn't be a good idea. That was my idea to begin with. She thought. Oh well. Too bad for him then. Dang you Darwin. She asked for goodness sakes! Blaster thought. Oh well, too bad for her. Darwin lied awake thinking about Juarez. He couldn't believe she liked him! This was bad in a way because now if she were somehow hurt, it would make it harder for him to take. He would just have to watch out for her closer now. The next morning was busy. Everyone was getting their gear packed and Juarez did a few more hours on the G force simulator. Blaster trained on the motorcycle, and Hurly ate. And ate, and ate and ate. Sugar watched in awe as he devoured his fourth piece of cake. \"How the heck does he do that?\" She asked Blaster. \"I have no idea, but I'm glad I can't.\" Blaster replied. \"I hope he doesn't get sick during the mission.\" Sugar said. \"He never does.\" Blaster replied. \"It's a gift.\" Hurly said, licking his fingers. And that's the first chapter. I hope you liked it. I'm writing this for a friend of mine. She's been waiting for this fic for a while now.[Chapter 2] Here's chapter two. Thanks for the good reviews so far guys. You're awesome! Enjoy! \"Alright guys! It's go time!\" Ben called. The team loaded into the modified remote control helicopter and sat down. Ben grabbed the control and looked at the team. \"Good luck guys.\" He said. \"Remember, just get the data, and get out.\" \"We'll get it Ben, don't worry.\" Darwin said. Ben nodded and pressed a button on the control. The helicopter door closed, and Ben began flying it towards the target building. The trip took two hours. It was dark by the time they got there. The jump light in the helicopter turned orange and the door opened. Ben's voice came into the speakers overhead. \"Alright, be careful in there.\" He said. The team stood and lined up at the door. They had their chute packs on and waited. The light turned green. Darwin was the first one out. He pulled the rip cord and his chute opened. The rest of the team was out now, Sugar had done a few flips in the air and came dangerously close to killing herself. She opened her chute just in time. When the whole team was on the roof, they began making their way to the ground floor. Once there, they started searching for the office where they could download the time of launch and abort codes for the missiles. \"Darwin,\" Juarez whispered. \"I'll get the codes and time, the rest of you stand guard.\" Darwin watched her run into a large room. \"Blaster,\" He said. \"You, Sugar and Hurly stay here. I'm going to help Juarez.\" \"Sure boss.\" Blaster said. Darwin scurried across the floor and into the office. Juarez was on the keyboard typing in codes to get access to the data. \"Do you need some help?\" He asked. Juarez hadn't heard him come in. She spun around and aimed a tazer at him. When she saw it was him, she lowered it and sighed. \"Now is not the best time to-\" \"Juarez I-\" \"I said now is not the time!\" Juarez said. Darwin sighed. \"At least let me speak will you?\" He asked. Juarez nodded and continued typing. \"Juarez, when you said you liked me , you really did mean it didn't you?\" Darwin asked. Juarez looked at him. \"I've answered this question before, and the answer is still yes. Now will you push enter?\" She said. Darwin pressed down on the enter key and the download began. \"Oh no.\" Juarez said. \"What?\" Juarez looked at Darwin, and he saw horror in her eyes. \"The download is going to take half an hour!\" She said. Darwin almost shouted with anger. They didn't have half an hour. \"Go tell Blaster, now!\" He ordered. Juarez rushed out the door and found Blaster, Hurly and Sugar. \"The download is going to take half an hour. Get in here!\" She said. The team followed her into the office and they all climbed onto the desk. \"Darwin we don't have-\" \"I know Blaster!\" Darwin cut in angrily. \"Call Ben and tell him that we're going to be late getting on the chopper.\" He said. Blaster contacted Ben and told him what was going on. \"It's still twenty minutes.\" Darwin said. \"I don't know what we're going to do! Gauge gets here in fifteen minutes!\" Juarez thought for a moment and then looked sadly at the rest of the team. \"Get to the chopper. Blaster, you have the wireless connection right?\" Blaster looked at her. \"Yeah… but what-\" \"Give it to me.\" Blaster handed it to Juarez. \"When the download is complete, I'll send the data to the computer back at the lab. Go!\" She ordered. Darwin shook his head. \"No we're not leaving you here!\" He said. Juarez looked at him. Darwin could see a tear forming in her eye. \"Yes you are.\" She said. Sugar looked at the laptop. \"Ten minutes left! We can wait for you!\" She said. \"No!\" Juarez said. \"You'll die just go now!\" Darwin looked at the team. \"Get to the chopper.\" He said. Hurly looked at him. \"But-\" \"Now!\" Darwin yelled. The team made their way to the helicopter waiting on the roof. Darwin turned to Juarez. Seven minutes left. \"Juarez please don't do this.\" He begged. Juarez grabbed Darwin's shoulders and kissed him. She pulled away and looked him in the eye. \"I love you.\" Darwin said. The tear finally fell from Juarez's eye. \"GO!\" She shouted. Darwin ran from the room and found his way to the roof. He jumped into the helicopter and closed the door. \"Okay Ben.\" He said. The helicopter lifted off the ground and began it's long trip back to the lab. Two minutes left. Juarez heard a vehicle pull up outside. Time was up. The door opened and Juarez could hear a man walking towards the office. One minute! Come on, come on! thirty seconds. The office door opened. Twenty. William Gauge pulled out a gun from his coat. Fifteen seconds. He ran for the laptop and dove for the button. Five seconds! His finger pressed down on the mouse. The download was canceled. And with only two seconds left. Juarez screamed and threw herself at Gauge. She had turned on her video camera on her helmet so her team could see. \"No Juarez!\" Darwin shouted. Gauge slammed his fist into Juarez while she was in the air and sent her flying across the room. She slammed into the wall and fell to the ground. Gauge stood up and raised the gun. \"I know about your little team.\" He said. \"You're agent Juarez, you have stopped many criminals in the past, but you will not stop me.\" Juarez looked into the mans eyes. \"Then shoot me.\" She said. Gauge grinned. \"That's exactly what I'm going to do.\" He said. He aimed, and pulled the trigger. Back in the helicopter, the small screen had just turned to static. Those little black and gray lines dancing around the screen. \"NO!\" Darwin yelled. Hurly lowered his head. Blaster sat down on his chair and stared at the side of the chopper. Sugar just looked at him sadly. Darwin cried for the rest of the trip back to the lab. Gauge looked at the body of the guinea pig he had just killed. A small pool of blood surrounded her head where he had shot her. He smiled to himself. \"William Gauge one, G-Force, zero.\" He said to himself. And that's chapter two. Chapter three will be posted as soon as I can write it.[Chapter 3] Get ready for chapter three. Darwin stepped out of the helicopter and headed straight for his room. Ben was a bit confused. \"Darwin, where's Juarez?\" He asked. Darwin didn't answer. He just kept walking. Ben heard his door close and looked back the team. \"Guy's what happened? Did you get the data?\" He asked. Blaster looked sadly up at Ben. \"What does it look like Ben? Not only do we not have the data, but now we don't have Juarez!\" He shouted. Then he turned and walked into his room, followed by Sugar. When Sugar was in Blaster slammed the door. Hurly had stayed out with Ben. Blaster sat down on his bed an put his head in his paws. \"She couldn't do it.\" He said. Sugar put a paw on his back and sat down on the bed. Blaster started to cry. He hadn't cried since his parents died, but he didn't care. Juarez had died because of him, Darwin, Sugar, and Hurly. They had failed her. \"We should have stayed!\" Blaster shouted. \"I knew we should have stayed!\" In Gauge's house… William Gauge was sitting at his desk. He was looking over the plans for his missile for any flaws there might have been. Then he saw the guinea pig on the floor twitch. It stood up and walked over to him. \"You're luck I'm such a good shot, or I wouldn't have hit that ink pack. You're also lucky I remembered to make the casing out of Kevlar. If I hadn't, you'd be dead.\" Gauge said. \"Next time, I'll do the shooting.\" The guinea pig said. It reached up and grabbed the fur on the back of it's neck and pulled. The mask made to look like Juarez slid off. The guinea pig threw it into the fire and stretched, then ripped off the rest of it's disguise. \"I must say I did a very good job of making that. Excellent work Crystal.\" Gauge said. Crystal was a solid white color. Short fur and big blue eyes. She didn't look like the criminal type. \"They'll find her soon. What will we do then?\" She asked. Gauge leaned back into his chair. \"G-Force does not know that I will be launching the missile from my own backyard. It is that small. It will hit Red Square at exactly three P.M. tomorrow.\" Gauge smiled to himself. \"I will enjoy seeing my work on the news. The whole world will wonder where it came from. Oh that reminds me, I have a… debt, that I need to pay.\" Crystal sat down. \"I'll wait here.\" She said. \"Just be quick about it Gauge.\" Gauge stood and walked out of the room. He went outside to his car and cranked it up. \"Just a little debt.\" He said to himself. Back at the lab… It was midnight. Everyone was asleep. Darwin woke to a strange sound coming from his closet. He hadn't bothered putting his gear away. He got out of the bed and pulled his miniature gun out from under his pillow. He raised it and threw open the door. When he saw who it was, he dropped his gun. He found himself looking at a tied up guinea pig. Juarez. She had been gagged as well. \"Juarez!\" Darwin shouted. He quickly untied her and ripped off the gag. Juarez stood up. \"Where's the little bi-\" She found herself once again gagged, but this time it wasn't by cloth. Darwin kissed her. Juarez said something. She pushed Darwin away and looked at him. \"What was that for?\" She asked. Darwin was confused. \"I saw you die!\" He said. Juarez shook head. \"That wasn't me.\" She said. \"Gauge sent some chick disguised as me, somehow, and she tied me up. I was getting my gear on and she punched me in the back.\" Darwin didn't care. Juarez was alive and that was all that mattered. Darwin and Juarez walked to Blasters room. He and Sugar were asleep on the bed. Sugar was in the middle and Blaster was about to roll off. \"Blaster wake up.\" Darwin said. Blaster opened his eyes. \"Juarez!\" He shouted and fell off of the bed. He quickly picked himself up and hugged Juarez tightly around the neck. \"I thought you got your brains blown out.\" He said. \"No, thank God.\" Juarez said. Sugar crawled over and hugged Juarez. \"You scared the crap out of us.\" She said. Juarez rolled her eyes. \" I was locked in a closet. Some other guinea pig scared the crap out of you.\" She said. The group went to Hurley's room next. He was thrilled to see Juarez was alive. He almost strangled her with hugs. Juarez wasn't exactly happy to receive this kind of attention but decided to get it over with instead of giving him a black eye. \"It's good to see you too Hurly.\" She said. Darwin looked at the team. \"We've got to stop those missiles from being launched.\" He said. \"Get your gear on and let's go!\" They didn't have to be told twice. Even without Ben's orders, they were going to stop Gauge from firing the missiles. They each grabbed their guns and loaded into the chopper. They woke up Speckles and told him to set it to take them to Gauge's house. They were on their way again. This time, they would complete their mission. They would complete their mission no matter what the cost. They were going to win this. So Juarez didn't die! How many of you love me for that? Chapter four will be posted soon.[Chapter 4] Sorry about the long wait. Here's chapter four! \"Alright team, we go in, stop Gauge, and get out.\" Darwin said. Gauges home was just a few blocks away from the chopper. Suddenly, there was an explosion in Gauge's yard and what looked like a smaller version of a missile propelled itself into the early morning sky. \"Oh no.\" Blaster said. He stood for a moment then looked at Darwin. \"Did Ben ever make those jetpacks he promised us?\" He asked. \"Yeah, here.\" Darwin said, opening a container on the floor of the mini helicopter. He handed Blaster a pack that he slid onto the black guinea pig's shoulders. Blaster looked sadly at the team. He grabbed Sugar and kisses her before jumping out of the chopper. Darwin pushed a button on his headset. \"Blaster what are you doing?\" He could see Blaster's jetpack launch him into the air until he grabbed onto the missile. \"Stop Gauge. I'll stop the missile.\" Blaster said. He painfully dragged himself up the missile body until he came to a panel built into the side. He reached for his welding torch and flicked it on. \"Juarez?\" Blaster said into his headset. He heard a click and then… \"Yes Blaster I'm here.\" Blaster sighed in relief. The panel came off to reveal two wires, one red, one blue. \"Do I cut the red one or the blue one?\" He asked. Juarez thought carefully for a few minutes. \"Juarez?\" \"Cut the red one.\" Juarez said. There was a long pause until Blaster said, \"Goodbye Juarez.\" and cut the blue wire. William Gauge watched as his weapon exploded in the sky. He swore under his breath and turned to face Crystal, who was watching in horror when the missile blew up. He sighed and turned back to the window. Then he heard a click. He grabbed his gun and spun around, his gun aiming at Crystal, who was pointing hers at Gauge. She was holding a badge up in front of her. \"Put it down Gauge.\" She ordered. Gauge grinned. \"Crystal, we both know you won't shoot me.\" He said. \"I told Blaster how to destroy the missile. I told him about the wires, how the red one just arms the second warhead.\" Crystal said, sweat already dripping from her forehead. Gauge saw a tear fall from her eye. He grinned and raised his gun. \"I've known about you for months Crystal. Did you really think keeping that badge was a good idea?\" Suddenly, there was an explosion from the hall. Gauge turned away and that was when she did it. Crystal closed her eyes and fired. The single bullet at one thousand feet per second across the room, embedding itself into the back of Gauges head. The man was dead before his body could process what happened. He fell to the floor, but when he hit, his gun went off. Darwin ran into the room and slid to a stop in front of the body. Juarez jumped at Crystal and pinned her to the floor. Crystal rolled her eyes. \"I'm on your side. Let me up.\" Sugar and Hurly were next to enter the room. Sugar was holding a down to size rifle that was made especially for her. Her finger was twitching and lightly tapping the trigger. Her whole body was shaking with rage. She looked at Crystal and raised the gun. \"No!\" Juarez said. She had let Crystal back up. Crystal flashed the badge at Sugar and looked back out the window. There was a speck of orange light heading towards the window. It was Blasters jet pack. \"Hurly get down!\" Darwin shouted and dove at the fat, tan guinea pig. The jet pack hit right where he had been standing and exploded. The burning fragments shooting around the room. When the missile had gone off, it was in the upper atmosphere, but the explosion was so large you couldn't tell. Blaster had used the jet pack to escape the blast, pulling ten G forces in the process. He pulled on the cord and his chute opened. At his speed however, the sudden decrease in speed broke both of his legs and almost his back. The missile had been armed by Crystal so it only had the power of a car bomb. Blaster looked down just in time to see his destroyed jet pack crash through the window. There was an explosion and a giant fireball burst from the now open window. \"No!\" Blaster yelled as loud as he possibly could. He steered the chute towards the window and drifted inside. \"Darwin! Where are you?\" He shouted over the roar of the flames. Then he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. \"Blaster?\" Darwin dragged himself out from under a chair. Blaster looked up at Darwin and almost passed out. Darwin's legs had been blown off by the blast. Blood was dripping from his mouth and one of his arms was blown in half. \"Oh no.\" Blaster crawled over to him and pulled him into the hall so he could breathe better. Darwin coughed and pointed towards the office door. \"Get… them out… now!\" He said, his voice was scratchy and Blaster knew he wasn't going to make it. \"I'm coming back for you.\" He said. Darwin shook his head. \"No… you're not.\" Blaster sniffed and dragged his broken body back into the office. Juarez was pulling Sugar out from under some wood that had fallen onto her. \"Blaster!\" Sugar screamed and somehow got herself out from under the wood. She ran to Blaster and kissed him. \"I guess you missed me.\" Blaster said. Sugar slapped him. \"Don't you ever blow up anything unless I say you can!\" She said. Hurly came out from under the desk and picked Blaster up. \"Come on!\" He yelled and grabbed Sugar by the hand. Juarez followed them and picked Darwin up. The team ran up the stairs and onto the room. They loaded up into the helicopter and Sugar made herself the pilot. Juarez set Darwin down and lifted his head. \"Darwin no!\" She said through her tears. Darwin grabbed her hand and smiled. \"It's like… Gauge said. 'It's the end of the line.'\" And that was it. Darwin died in Juarez's arms. The grey guinea pig sobbed over Darwin's body. Hurly stared sadly at Juarez as did Blaster. The helicopter landed in the lab and Ben stood waiting for them. \"Well hoe did it- Darwin!\" He said. Juarez shook her head as she carried the body into her room and closed the door. Blaster dragged himself into his room and Sugar followed. Hurly went to his and Ben stood in the middle of the room, staring at the wall. It was over. Gauge was dead, the missile threat terminated, there was nothing else. Blaster, Sugar and Hurly could all hear Juarez crying in her room. They found it hard to believe that he was actually dead. They wished they could just go to sleep, and when they woke up, Darwin would be standing there. But no. He was dead. As for William Gauge, it was truly, the end of the line. This was my first fic with an actual sad ending. Slow Death was sort of a sad story but not exactly. Sugar was created by warrior crazy, her personality, looks, and overall appearance was all her idea. I take no credit for Sugar. Crystal was my idea though. I hope you liked it.

It's going to be pretty long. It will start the day she meets Buzz and it will end the day she graduates. Disclaimer: I do not own Rebel Without A Cause, any of the characters or anything else that has to do with that movie. Dear Diary, September 1, 1954[Chapter 2] Dear Diary, September 16, 1954 I didn't see Buzz all day but tonight around ten he showed up outside my window again. I wore a navy blue skirt and a light blue, buttoned up top. When we got to his car, he had parked around the corner so that my parents wouldn't hear him drive up, I saw that the usually eight other kids were already piled into his car. I climbed into the car and sat next to Buzz. I kept asking him where we we're going but he wouldn't tell me. He sped out of town and after a few miles he turned down a dirt road that looked like it led to nowhere. Actually, that basically just happened to be where it led. When I saw the cliff getting closer I got terrified and I cuddled closer to Buzz. He smiled down at me and wrapped his arm around my shoulder. I thought he would slow down but he didn't, not yet anyway. He pushed the gas down as far as he could and when we we're only about ten feet away from the edge he slammed down hard on the breaks. It looked like we we're about to go barreling over the edge but the car stopped a few inches from the edge. I had been screaming the whole time his foot had been down on the breaks. My screams, however, only made the other's laugh. Buzz smiled down at me, holding back his laughter as he held me tighter and kissed my forehead. \"It's alright, honey,\" Buzz whispered softly against my cheek. I just nodded. I was too terrified to respond but I clung to him like he was the only thing keeping me from falling over the edge of the cliff and onto the rocks below. Dear Diary, September 22, 1954 Tonight was so much fun! For the first time, Buzz and I went out alone. Yes, JUST me and Buzz. You heard me right. We went back to the cliffs. My father had told me not to go out tonight but of course I hadn't listened. I just snuck out like I did last week when Buzz took me up to the cliffs for the first time. Tonight I got to see a part of Buzz that I don't get to see in front of his friends. When we got to the edge of the cliffs Buzz pulled a blanket out of the back of the car, opened the passenger door for me and led me out to the edge of the cliffs. He spread the blanket out on the ground and sat down on it. Then he pulled me down so that I was sitting on his lap. He wrapped his arm around my waist and kissed my neck gently. \"Your beautiful, honey,\" Buzz whispered, \"so beautiful.\" I smiled and turned so that my lips brushed against his. A few weeks ago I wouldn't have been able to be that bold but just being around Buzz made me so much braver. The kiss started out slow and gentle but then he moved his hand to the back of my head and pushed my lips hard against his. I moved my hands to his shoulders as we kissed. When the kiss ended I instantly felt lonely but Buzz pulled me closer against him and I felt safe. In his arms I always feel like I'm free to do anything I want to do. He makes me feel so special. My father would never understand that. Monday is the first day of school. Buzz said he would pick me up for school so I'm going to meet him out back in the alley. I don't care if my dad sees or not. Dear Diary, September 24, 1954 Today was a great day. Even better than the last few weeks while I was hanging out with Buzz and his friends. Today I walked into school as Buzz's girl. He had his arm draped over my shoulder as we walked down the hall. Everyone was watching us. Even the teacher's we're staring at us. I couldn't keep the smile from my face. I didn't think the day could get any better but during my first hour class one of the girls that always hung out with us passed me a note. I opened it and read the small writing quickly so that the teacher wouldn't catch me with the note. Judy, We're meeting after class in front of the bathrooms. We're going to skip and go to the cliffs. I turned and nodded at her before slipping the note into my jacket pocket. After the class I headed straight for the bathrooms and smiled at Buzz when I saw him waiting for me with the others. When I got close to him he put his arm around my waist and pulled me close to him. I giggled and stood on my tiptoes to kiss him. He kissed me back softly before we started making are way down the hall to the doors that led out into the parking lot. We had so much fun at the cliffs. The boys stood at the edge and played around, pretending to start to push each other off the cliffs. All of us girls just sat on the hood of Buzz's car watching them, laughing at the stupid jokes they made and smiling at them when they turned to look at us. My new friends are great. They are dangerous and fun. I feel so free when I'm with them. Like I can do whatever I want and no one can ever do anything about it. Dear Diary, September 30, 1954 Tonight was amazing and so much fun. I never laughed so hard or had so much fun in my life. First, we went to the cliffs. Buzz got behind the wheel and backed up until he was about a hundred feet from the edge of the cliff. Goon, one of the other boys, climbed onto the hood and laid down on his back with his hands holding onto the hood. Everyone else stood back and waited patiently. Suddenly, Buzz hit the gas and started driving toward the edge of the cliff. Goon held on tightly for what seemed like forever when Buzz finally slammed on the breaks. When the car came to a stop Goon jumped off the hood and ran over to Buzz. He gave him a high five and then turned to the rest of us. \"Who's next,\" Goon asked. No one said anything. Goon laughed as they looked at each other with terrified expressions on their faces. I don't know why I did it. I hadn't intended to do it but before I knew it I realized I had stepped forward and volunteered. Goon ran over, grabbed my hand and led me toward the car. He gave me some brief instructions on how I should hold on and how I needed to just let my body be free. I nodded and got into the car with Buzz. He backed up to where he had been when Goon had got on the hood and stopped the car. He turned to me and slipped his arms around my shoulders. \"You don't have to do this,\" Buzz said. I nodded and leaned forward to kiss his lips quickly. I smiled at him, got out of the car and climbed onto the hood. I held onto the hood and waited. \"Ready,\" Buzz asked. I gripped the hood tighter with my hands before I answered him. \"Yes. I'm ready,\" I replied. He started the engine and a split second later he was speeding toward the edge of the cliff. I felt my fingers slipping and tried to grip the hood tighter. Right when I thought I couldn't hold on any longer he slammed on the breaks and the car stopped. It was the most intense moment of my life.[Chapter 3] DearnDiary, nOctober 31, 1954 I know it has been awhile since I wrote in herenbut I have been really busy lately. I have been hanging out with Buzznand the others and that keeps me pretty busy. Anyway, I have to tell you what happened. It wasnthe most dangerous, exciting and reckless night of my entire life. At around seven Buzz came to pick me up. Likenusual all the other kids we're in the car and ready to head out. It's Halloween so the boys decided that wenshould do something special. Crunch got this idea that we should pullnup into the alley behind the police station, sneak around to thenfront and mess with one of the cars so that's what we did. We stopped at a store on the way and got somentoilet paper and eggs. After we got our \"supplies\" we drove downninto the back alley and crept slowly around the side of the stationnuntil we could see the police cars parked in front. The boys spottednone of the cars that were parked in some shadows. It was the only onenthey could possibly get close to without being spotted. I wanted to go with them but Buzz told me notnto. He said that he didn't want me or the other to get intontrouble. I don't know why he was being so protective.nWe usually joined in with almost everything. It didn't take the boys long to finish. All ofnus girls watched them wrap toilet paper around the antenna and bustneggs all over the rest of the car. After they we're done they started runningnback toward where we we're hiding. Moose threw an egg at the glassndoor that was used as the entrance to the station. As soon as the eggnhit the door we heard someone cry out from inside the building. Asnsoon as we heard that everyone started running back toward the alleynand Buzz's car. Buzz started the car as soon as everyone wasninside and started speeding down the alley. I turned my head to looknback just as a police officer ran out into the alley and watched usnracing away from him. Buzz didn't slow down until we we're out ofntown completely. He looked into the rearview mirror and smiled atnCrunch. \"What should we do now?\" Buzz asked. Inturned and looked at Crunch. He had this strange smile plastered onnhis face. \"Let's go to the graveyard and see how braventhese girls are,\" Crunch replied, smiling mischievously down at thengirl in his lap. She just giggled and kissed his cheek. I glancednover at Buzz and he wrapped his arm around my shoulder and gave me anquick smile as we headed off toward the graveyard. It didn't take Buzz long to drive to thengraveyard. When we got there everyone climbed out of the car andnstared out over the jagged rolls of tombstones. Buzz went over the game rules quickly. Eachncouple had to go out into the cemetery and the last couple that backnto the car was the winner. I was scared but I knew that Buzz would want tonwin. Buzz would have to win to keep his reputation with the othernboys so as I looked around at the faces of the other kids I promisednmyself that I wouldn't let him down. Crunch held up his hand. \"On the count of three,\" Crunch said,n\"One…two…three!\" As soon as he said the word three we allnstarted racing out into the graveyard. Buzz grabbed my hand andnpulled me quickly behind him to the far side of the graveyard. Whennwe got past the last grave marker he sat down and pulled me down ontonhis lap. He wrapped his arm around my waist and kissed my cheek. An hour later we we're still sitting in thensame place. We we're one of the only two couples left in thencemetery. The other couple was Crunch and his girlfriend. We we'renall about to call it a tie and go back to the car when the flashlightnshined down into my eyes. The police officer glared down at me andnBuzz. At the police station I was the last one callednin to talk to the officer for the juvenile division because thenofficers we're having such a hard time getting a hold of mynparents. Buzz and the others had already left so when the officerncalled me and my parents into his office we we're the only onesnleft waiting. As soon as we entered the office my father startednspeaking to the officer. \"She's never been in trouble like thisnbefore. Well, there was that one other time but before this fallneverything was fine,\" my father said. The officer, Ray, nodded andnsat down at his desk. \"It's the crowd she's been spending timenwith,\" Ray said, glancing at me, \"she needs to make some newnfriends.\" My mother laughed like the officer had just saidnsomething incredibly funny. He looked up at her curiously. \"What she needs is punishment,\" my mothernreplied before turning and giving me a cold glare that I had onlynseen a few times in my life. She had never looked at me like that.nShe was always looking at my father when she did that. \"Well, we could always keep her in juvenilenhall for a few days,\" Ray replied. I glared at him and opened mynmouth to speak but my mother spoke first. \"That might be exactly wha..,\" my mothernstarted to say when my father interrupted her quickly. \"That won't be necessary,\" my father saidnquickly. This time he got my mother's glare. The tears streamedndown my face and I suddenly felt like I could not hold the pain innany longer so I turned to face the officer. \"She doesn't want me there,\" I cried. Mynmother looked over at me with a shocked expression on her face likenshe had no idea what I was talking about but I knew she did. Thenofficer talked to us a few more minutes before he agreed to let me gonhome with my parents. At the time it was the last thing I wanted tondo.[Chapter 4] Dear Diary, November 1, 1954 I'm grounded for one month. Well, at least that's what my parents think. Earlier tonight Buzz came to my window again and I snuck out with him and the other kids. We had a great night. First we went to a movie andthrew popcorn at the back of some ofthe other people in the theater. After that we went to an ice cream shop and got some ice cream. The real fun started when we went out to the beach though. Buzz, Crunch and Moose started a fire and we all sat around it in the sand. It was so much fun. After that we all slipped out of our clothes, down to our underwear anyway and ran out into the ocean to go for a swim. My father would have grounded me for another month if he knew that I had been that nude in front of all those other kids. Dear Diary, November 25, 1954 Today was Thanksgiving. Tonight is going to be great. Buzz is supposed to stop at the corner and we are all going to go out and have a little fun. At someone else's expense of course. Anyway, I have to get ready. I'll write more about what happens tonight when I get back. Dear Diary, November 25, 1954 Tonight was so cool but Crunch is so immature, in a funny kind of way. There is this guy, Plato who goes to school with us. He's a real geek. Anyway, Crunch tied a turkey upside down outside the door to Plato's house and rang the doorbell. He ran out and jumped in the car as a chubby woman opened the door. She screamed when she saw the turkey and we all started laughing. When she noticed us and started glaring at us Buzz started the car and we sped off down the road. It was so funny. Dear Diary, December 5, 1954 I'm officially not grounded. My father said my grounding was over this morning. Not like it mattered. I mean, it's not like I've been home in my roomlike I was supposed to have been for the past month but that's okay. As long as my parents don't find out it doesn't really matter. I've been having so much fun with Buzz and all of the rest of the kids. When we walk down the hall everyone moves to let us through. It makes me feel so...important! Dear Diary, December 24, 1954 Well, it's Christmas Eve, finally. I had a great day. I didn't get to see Buzz today but that was okay. He called last night and said that his parents we're making him stay home for Christmas Eve and Christmas but that's okay because we have a big party planned for New Years Eve. My mom made a ham for supper tonight and we are going to have turkey tomorrow. I love both. It's a tradition for us to have ham on Christmas Eve and turkey on Christmas. I wore a new dress that I hadbought for Christmas Eve today. It's really pretty. It's emerald green. My mother told me it was lovely and my father said that I looked beautiful. I don't really understand why but my mom glared at him when he said it. I'm just settling on the thought that she's jealous and I'm not ashamed to say that thinking that makes me smile. Dear Diary, December 25, 1954 Today was another good day which is pretty surprising around my family. I got 6 gifts. My parents got me a beautiful dark green skirt, a black blouse and a dark green jacket, the exact same color of the skirt. My little brother got me a silver bracelet with my name on it. It is so beautiful. I wore it all day and I'm still wearing it tonight. I received a beautiful red dress from my aunt. My dad hated it. I could tell by the look on his face when he first saw it but I love it. It's sexy and sophisticated. I've decided to wear it to the New Years Eve party. My last present was from my grandparents. It wasa beautiful jewelry box with little heart designs on the lid. When you raise the lid it plays a beautiful melody to a song I remembered my grandmother always humming when I would spend the summers with my grandparents. My Christmas was almost perfect. The only thing missing was Buzz. Dear Diary, January 1, 1954 Last night was so great. I walked out onto the beach in my new, red dress on Buzz's arm. All the girls complimented my dress. A huge bonfire had already been built and there was food and drinks in coolers and on hoods of cars. Buzz grabbed us two cokes and led me over to the very edge of the water, away from the other kids. He sat down in the sand, pulled me down into his lap and handed me my coke. I opened my coke and took a sip as I looked out over the ocean toward the horizon. Buzz wrapped his arm around my waist and held me close to him. \"How are you feeling?\" Buzz asked, kissing the top of my head. I smiled and rested my head back on his shoulder. \"I feel great, being here with you,\" I replied. I could feel Buzz's mouth curve into a smile against my head. I smiled too, liking the idea that I had made him smile. I loved to make him smile. I loved to see him smile. It made me feel so special, like his smile was meant just for me and I knew it was. We just stayed still, holding onto each other andstaring out over the wateruntil Crunch ran over to us and jumped into the waves in front of us, splashing waves all over Buzz and I. \"Come on guys. It's almost midnight,\" Crunch said, smiling. I sighed and Crunch reached for my hand to help me up. I took his hand and reluctantly stood up. I heard Buzz groan behind me as he started to stand up. I giggled and turned around to look at him. He walked up to me, put his arm around my waist and pulled me against him. \"What's so funny, honey?\" Buzz asked. I just smiled up at him, waiting for what I knew was coming. Just as I thought he would, he leaned his face down closer and brushed my lips with his. For a moment it was like I was the only girl in the world until he pulled away and started leading me back toward the bonfire.[Chapter 5] I have two stories that I'm writing on besides this one and I've decided to finish writing them one at a time. I pretty much know where I'm going with this one so I'm going to finish this one first. Oh and the January 1, 1954 should have been January 1, 1955. Sorry about any confusion. Dear Diary, January 10, 1955[Chapter 6] Dear Diary, April 12, 1955 Forty three years ago people boarded the Titanic on this day to come to America only to find out a few days later that their futures weren't going to be as perfect andas happy as they had expected them to be. Yesterday I learned that neither was mine. I'm not dead, of course, becauseI'm writing but Buzz is and Plato is. To have you understand I guess I should start at the beginning. Yesterday morning I woke up and ran out into the yard toget my brother when my mother asked me to. She needed him to come to the house so she could take him to school. After I got his attention I started walking out toward the main road to wait for Buzz to come pick me up. That's when I learned the boy's name. Remember? The one that I saw at the police station on Easter?It is Jim. At first I thought he was a joke and completely ignored him after I got into the car with the other kids and Buzz. Most of the day went by pretty okay but we had a field trip at the planetarium to hear some old guy speak about the stars and constellations and stuff like that. About halfway through the presentation Buzz made a remark about one of the constellations and a few minutes later Jim made a remark about one of the constellations. The boys felt like messing with Jim so we all agreed. After everyone was outside Buzz slashed one of Jim's car tires with his knife. That just started a huge fight that ended with Buzz challenging Jim to a chickie race. That's where all the problems begun. That night I was the one who was to signal for the race to start and when the time came, I did. I'm sitting here regretting that right now because Buzz didn't jump out of his car. He was in the car when the car went over the edge of the cliff and exploded on the rocks below. The other boys all blamed Jim even though everyone knew it wasn't his fault and that's what started all the trouble later that night. Everyone left my side besides Jim when we heard the sirens. I don't think I would have been able to move from the edge of the cliff without him. Afterwards, Crunch and a few of the other boys saw Jim going into the police station to tell the officer's what had happened. That's when they decided to go after Jim. Jim, Plato and I ended up hiding out in an old mansion that sits a little ways back behind the planetarium. Jim and I had no idea that Plato had a gun and we didn't find out about the gun until he shot one of the boys that had come looking for Jim with Crunch. After that Plato almost shot Jim but Jim got out of the way in time. Plato ran out of the mansion soon after the cops showed up and ran through the trees back toward the planetarium. A police officer close behind him, Jim and I followed close behind that. We heard a shot and we're worried about Plato until we saw him run out of the trees and break into the planetarium. Jim and I ran and hid in some bushes a few feet away from the planetarium entrance. Jim and I glanced toward the parking lot as we heard some cars pulling up in the planetarium parking lot. Jim's parents and Ray climbed out of one of the cars. It wasn't long after that when Jim and I ran into the planetarium, joining Plato. I waited in the lobby, hidden from view while Jim went to get Plato. After about fifteen minutes, Jim returned with Plato but right after we stepped out of the doors, Plato panicked and started running. Jim screamed to tell the officer's that the gun Plato had wasn't loaded but it was too late. One of the officer's had already shot Plato. Plato died instantly. Dear Diary, June 5, 1955 Today was the day we graduated. In the last few months my life has changed drastically. I'm a better person now than I was before. My parents still don't treat me very well but I haven't been back to see Ray since Easter. Jim's parents adore me and I adore them. I stay at Jim's house as much as possible. My parents don't seem to care what I do now since they don't have to go into the police station anymore. Jim and I go visit Plato's and Buzz's graves often now. I miss Buzz but I don't miss the things we did. I'm really ashamed of most of the things we did but I still hold a special place in my heart for him. I know that I never really loved him but I know that he did really love me. He would have done anything for me and I'll never forget that. I'll never regret having known Buzz Gunderson. He saved me from a time in my life that could have been a lot worse without him. Jim and I go visit the black woman who had been taking care of Plato often as well. Plato had been like a son to her and she loved him dearly. She's an amazing woman and I hope that I can be just like her someday. Crunch and the other kids haven't really changed much but that doesn't really matter much to me. They pretty much leave Jim and I alone except for the occasional glares that Jim and I receive in the halls at school. The best thing about all this is that I've finally found someone to love.

I always loved Cyrus \"the Virus\" until the moment he shot Baby O. I am a HUGE fan of John Malkovich but unfortunately this FF is taking me away from him. I always wondered how Tricia would greet Baby O when they meet for the BBQ that Poe promised him, so this is my story. I don't own the actors or the movie, but I sure wish I owned John Malkovich and Baby O. *sighs dreamily* (clears throat) Excuse the rambling. Press on! Cameron Poe made a sharp right turning the corner and looking at each number on the door. One. Three. Five. Seven. He stopped and took a breath before he pushed the door open. There he was. On the bed. Reading the bible. \"Light reading, eh?\" Baby O looked up and smiled. \"Something like that.\" Poe approached the bed and the men shook hands. \"You're a tough one, Baby O.\" \"Yeah, I get it from my daddy.\" Poe smiled. \"I'm still looking forward to that homemade BBQ you promised me,\" Baby O stated. \"When do you get out of this place?\" \"A few months. I'm getting out for good behavior.\" After all that had happened with the hijacking of the plane, Baby O's lawyer had managed to reduce his sentence. He was going to be free quicker than he thought. Poe smiled. He felt like a proud father. \"A few months then,\" he smiled. \"Tricia and Casey are going to love you. You got a place to crash when you get out?\" \"Not yet.\" \"You'll stay with me then.\" \"I don't want to impose.\" \"You wouldn't be. You just stay out of trouble and the rest will take care of itself.\" Baby O nodded. … … … FOUR MONTHS LATER \"Daddy! Daddy! He's here!\" Casey Poe squealed with delight as a car pulled into the driveway. Casey and Tricia had been looking forward to this day for months, but not more than Cameron Poe who had been counting down the days until his mate was free. Poe approached his daughter at the window and lay a gentle hand on her shoulder. \"You ready?\" Casey nodded enthusiastically. Poe smiled at his daughter. It had a good few months since his release and he and Casey had spent all that time trying to catch up the last seven years of her life. He had taken her to all the places that father's took their children. A museum. A theme park. Bowling. To the park to play on the swings. To the movies. Casey asked questions about his time in prison, but he always answered the same way. \"It's not a place I want you to know about.\" Casey usually accepted that until the next time. Poe already had the meat cooking on the BBQ in the backyard. Tricia was there now, waiting until Baby O came outside to meet her. Poe and Casey answered the door together and Poe's smile was wider than a kid at Christmas when he shook his mate's hand. \"It's good to see you,\" Poe nodded. \"It feels good to be out of there,\" he agreed. He looked down at little Casey Poe. \"Hey, you must be Casey. I've seen pictures of you. I'm Baby O.\" The girl grinned. \"Hi. We have a BBQ outside.\" \"Great. I'm hungry.\" \"Me too,\" she beamed. Baby O offered her his hand and the little girl led him outside to the backyard. Tricia turned just in time to see him approaching. \"Hi,\" she smiled warmly. \"I'm Tricia. Cameron has been telling me about you for years. It's nice to finally meet you.\" As he extended his hand to greet her, she pushed it away and leaned in for a hug. In a lot of ways she had known him for years. It was like two pen pal's finally meeting for the first time. They already had previous knowledge of each other and photos. \"You too, ma'am,\" he smiled. \"All I heard about was the two of you. He sure does love you,\" Baby O grinned. \"Yeah, I know. So, you'll be staying here a while?\" \"If it's not too much trouble.\" \"Not at all. I think Cameron would probably divorce me if I sent you away,\" she laughed jokingly. \"No, seriously. I've been looking forward to it.\" \"Me too.\" Cameron Poe stood back and watched. Finally, his mate was home. All was right with the world. So, that's it. That's my story. I hope you liked it. =) xo ","Summary":" A/N: I have loved this movie since its release date and have seen it a billion times.

The other kid looked at Garland and smirked. \"Yeah?\" \"Uh, I wanted to thank you for getting those guys off me yesterday. You might've hit Fanucci a little hard, though. But hey, it was awfully decent of you. I'm small.\" The other boy ran a casual hand through his close cropped hair. Garland noticed he was the only kid here wearing sunglasses, which were usually prohibited at this juvenile prison. \"You don't remember me, do you Green?\" The boy pushed his shades up on his forehead. \"We went to elementary school together for first and part of second grade? Green, right ahead of Grissom…alphabetical, you remember?\" Garland's memory of childhood was vague but…\"You left in the middle of the year, right? Something about the janitor dying?\" Grissom let the sunglasses drop onto his eyes again. One of the counselors looked over at the two boys, and then looked away again, and Grissom smiled. \"Yup. The janitor, who touched my little sister and two of her friends, and didn't get fired for it…no one cares about white trash children, but our custodial boy was found in the boiler room with his throat cut, and the letter opener belonged to my mom…I guess I shouldn't have just dropped it afterwards.\" \"You went to jail for killing the janitor?\" Garland asked, incredulously. \"What were you, seven? We're fifteen now…\" But Grissom looked like a very short old man…not fifteen at all. \"Naw, they couldn't totally prove anything, but we had to transfer schools. But other people have grievously annoyed me…I have poor impulse control, the docs say, and since they found my step-daddy in a wood-chipper, I've been languishing here at Utah Industrial. Shame, isn't it?\" Garland was fairly bright, but was having a bit of trouble following Grissom's patter. However, as he stood by Grissom, everyone else seemed to be leaving the two of them alone. \"Someone told me that you're in here for killing cats, Garland, it sure seems like kind of a hefty sentence, as this is the maximum security juvie joint in the state.\" Garland grinned. \"Yeah, but one of those cats belonged to a Provo councilman's daughter. It's not like I didn't give the girl a nice little throw rug back for her room.\" Cyrus Grissom threw his head back and laughed loudly. May, 1997 Garland left Harrah's after his last roll. It was nightfall, and Garland would have been worried that all the police action outside, what with the prison plane having ruptured along the Las Vegas Strip, would create problems, as he was quite the wanted man. But Garland had followed a chubby blonde croupier (or was it a blackjack dealer, a broad in a tux, basically) into the Ladies, and he'd come out wearing the skin of her face over his own. He was still in his own clothes, so he supposed he looked like a lesbian, and, just after he turned on a more private avenue, he dropped her moldering epidermis down a sewer. Garland had had $600 in his rectum when he'd boarded the prison plane, and he'd won a couple of roulette wheel turns…A basically honest man, Garland Green would never stoop to stealing. Now, with about fifteen hundred in his pocket, Garland figured he had to find lodgings for the night. Could he risk his face being seen? Suddenly there was a whisper from an alley. \"Garland! Hey!\" Garland turned around and Sweet Jesus, there was Cyrus Grissom. \"I thought you died after the escape, Cy.\" Garland looked at Cyrus with amazement. Only the good die young, he thought. After he and Cyrus had reunited during the hijacking of the jailbird plane, they'd not said much to anyone else about the fact that they were old friends… Garland had been somewhat relieved when he'd heard that Cy had died, much as he owed him—Cyrus \"The Virus\" was a bit of a loose cannon. But now he grinned inadvertently…you'd expect Cy to be covered with blood, and wearing the state's threads, but apparently Cy had come across some money, too. \"Nice suit there, Cy.\" Garland admired it. Cy was resplendent in an Armani with a bright blue tie that looked like one Garland had seen one summer when working at Rogers Peet while he'd been in mortuary school. Cy pointed to a bloody leg in the alley. \"He was a degenerate gambler, and thought I could give him a ten-spot. And then he tried to mug me. The guy was obviously a businessman, but too desperate for good sense, and of course I was desperate, too, right?\" Garland laughed, and shook his head. I guess we all pay for our sins, no matter how poorly the sins are acted out, the poor bastard. \"So we're both free, so far, right?\" Garland asked, watching Cy toy with a diamond tie pin on the necktie. Jeez, if the guy had thought if it, he could have pawned that, instead of trying to rip off Jack Abbott from Hell. \"Yeah, they thought they got me, but no go. I'm a little annoyed that Cinitas's plan didn't work out for us. It would've been nice to be on a tropical island, but I guess I counted my Pina Coladas a little early.\" Garland snorted. \"You'd have gotten bored, Cy.

Garland and Cy went down in a hail of bullets. At the end of the alley, little Casey Poe handed the Glock back to her mother, who said to Daddy Cameron, \"Isn't that great?

Does the new shooter feel lucky? Well, yes… yes, he does… short drabble. Luck. They say real men don't need it. Or that they make their own, or something like that. He knew he wasn't a real man, not like everyone else, but he'd still never believed in the stuff before. Maybe it had just never been on his side. But he knew now. You can't make your own luck, man or not. Maybe you can make a few of the right decisions to send you on your way, but that's not luck at all. Being shoved on a plane at the last minute and ending up wandering the Las Vegas Strip in plain clothes, the world in his hands, was luck. He had had nothing to do with it. It was luck that had put him on that plane. Luck that had seen the plane in sympathetic hands before he even embarked. Luck that had landed it right in the middle of Vegas. Luck that had placed some poor man's body right in front of him, perfectly his size. And sheer stupidity that had ensured nobody recognised him. His picture had been on every lamppost on the Eastern Sea Board for months when they were looking for him, one would think someone would put two and two together. Especially considering the fact that an aeroplane full of America's most dangerous criminals had just crashed in the middle of the street. Lucky everyone trusted their Police. Lucky they were all on holiday and excited by gambling. Lucky no-one saw him drag someone's dead body behind the plane, strip him and don his clothes. Garland Greene strode straight into the middle of a game now being conducted in the middle of the street. \"New shooter,\" the dealer called out in that typical commentator-voice. \"New shooter comin' up. And does the new shooter feel lucky?\" Greene felt a grin creep across his pallid face. \"Yes,\" he said easily, accepting a cocktail from somebody behind him, eyeing up the woman next to him and thinking how amazingly lucky it was that he could take her home and kill her later so easily. \"Yes, he does.\" ","Summary":" New Shooter: All it takes is a new set of clothes from a body on the street.

AN: I absolutely love Con Air, so much that I don't really feel the need to write fanfiction for it because it's perfect. However, this is just a fun little one-shot that I wrote yesterday. Hope you like. The knock at the door seemed inappropriate to Casey, it was unnecessary. Knocking was for strangers or unwelcome people; he was neither. However, she knew that knock belonged to him, it could be no one else's. Even from upstairs she recognised it. Casey listened for a moment to see if either of her parents would get the door; nothing, they must've been out the back and unable to hear it. She sighed and rolled off her bed to head down to the front door. As she passed the mirror in her room she gave herself a quick check and was horrified to find her hair a mess. She ran a comb through it a few times and once satisfied continued down stairs. As her bare feet hit the carpeted stairs with light taps she smiled to herself, of all her parents' friends the one waiting at the front door was her favourite. \"Come in,\" she called as she made it to the entrance of the house. Finally, he opened the door and looked inside. It'd been a while since Casey had seen him, a few months at least. Even though he and her father were good friends they didn't get to see him that often. He was pretty much a work-a-holic based in California and they were living the family life in Alabama. He was still wearing his work suit and looked a little tired but all in all he was the same as ever. \"Hey Larkin,\" said Casey. \"Casey,\" replied Larkin, a smile brightening his tired eyes. \"How are you?\" He stepped inside and Casey threw her arms around his neck. \"It's good to see you,\" she cried. \"I was beginning to think you'd forgotten where we lived.\" He returned her hug, a little awkwardly, and sighed. \"Work has been hectic,\" he said. \"But it's great to get the chance to come and see you guys.\" They both held the hug a little longer than necessary and then let go, Casey was surprised to find herself so reluctant to part from him. He looked at her and she felt herself blush, again she was surprised by her reaction. \"Make yourself at home,\" she said gesturing towards the door into the living room. \"I'll go see where Mum and Dad are.\" She then hurried off towards the back of the house, leaving Larkin alone and slightly stunned by her abrupt exit. Casey opened the back door and peered out at the outdoor dining area where she'd assumed they must be; empty. Damn , she thought to herself. Where are they? She wandered back into the kitchen and lent up against the bench thinking. She noticed a note on the fridge and looked closer in order to read it. Gone to the shop, back at about 5. Mum & Dad xx Casey ripped it off the fridge and re-read it. How hadn't she noticed them leave? She glanced at her watch, it was only 4:20pm, that meant she had over half an hour of having to entertain Larkin before they got back. Ordinarily she would've been fine with it but she was still shocked by her reaction to seeing him and didn't know what it meant. She peeked around the door and spied Larkin across the hallway in the next room, he was sitting on the sofa rubbing his eyes. He taken his jacket off and was wearing a white collared shirt, his gun and holster were now clearly visible. Casey couldn't help but think he looked hot... What am I thinking? She thought angrily to herself as she pulled back and stood in the kitchen. Her heart beat had quickened and she could feel it hammering away in her chest. She ran her hands through her long blonde hair in a distressed manner. My God, she thought. Am I crushing on Vince Larkin? Larkin stopped rubbing his eyes and blinked a few times rapidly, the vision of sixteen year old Casey Poe with her denim short shorts and tight white t-shirt were still dancing in front of them. He shook his head and slapped himself to snap out of it. He was tired from the day's work and the flight; that was all. A good night's sleep would bring him to his senses...but that was hours away, what would he do until then? You're a grown man, he told himself. You can handle this situation. He was forty years old. The fact surfaced to the forefront of his mind out of nowhere. A forty year old, single man with no life but his work and no sight of anything in the future but more of the same. Casey was a sixteen year old school girl with everything ahead of her, she'd never think of him in that way. What am I thinking? I don't want her to think of me that way. I shouldn't be thinking of her in that way, she's Poe's daughter! And that was the bottom line here; she was Cameron Poe's daughter. Larkin was one of the only people that Cameron really trusted, he'd told him that. How could he consider breaking that trust after everything they'd been through? Larkin was suddenly cast back to that night in Vegas when it was finally all over, he remembered looking over at the Poes, reunited at last. Casey was only a little girl then, she certainly wasn't anymore. Larkin had thought then, as he did now, how good it was to see them together, happy again. He entertained the idea of a family of his own for a moment but was bitterly reminded that he had no one, no one at all to share in his joys and his sorrows. Casey took a deep breath to calm her nerves. She'd been gone for ten minutes now and she knew Larkin would be wondering where she'd gone. She couldn't just leave him there by himself, he'd come to visit them not to sit in their living room alone. But how could she go back out there knowing that she felt this way? Pull yourself together girl! She told herself and before she could deliberate anymore, marched back in the direction of the living room to find Larkin sitting there looking hotter than ever. Damn it! He looked up at her and their eyes locked for a moment before he looked away guiltily. He knows! Casey panicked. She felt her cheeks redden. \"Casey,\" said Larkin, he seemed to be struggling. Was he going to let her down easy? She couldn't help it; she sat down next to him. \"Yes,\" she replied in almost a whisper. \"I...\" he was still struggling to talk to her and kept glancing away nervously. \"What is it?\" she asked, unable to take her eyes off him now. He turned and faced her, looking into her eyes. \"Nothing,\" he muttered. Casey didn't know whether to be happy or disappointed. He was still looking at her and she at him. His hand came up and touched her cheek. \"You're...\" he started. Casey couldn't resist any longer, not now his hand was on her face. She grabbed him and pulled him towards her, their lips met and she kissed him. He tried, half-heartedly to pull back but Casey just pushed him back so he was lying on the sofa looking up at her, on top of him. She watched as the reluctance in his eyes vanished and he lent forward to kiss her. SLAM! A car door alerted them that Cameron and Trisha had arrived home. They both froze. Then they both scrambled. Casey jumped up and started patting down her hair while Larkin sat up and straightened his shirt out as best he could. \"God, I feel like I'm in high school again,\" he muttered. \"I am in high school,\" replied Casey with a grin just as the front door opened and her parents entered the house. \"Hi Mum, Dad,\" said Casey when they entered the room where only moments ago she'd been making out with Larkin. \"Look who's here.\" Larkin smiled weakly and guiltily; \"Hi,\" he managed to say. Casey turned so only Larkin could see her and winked at him, he suddenly didn't feel so bad anymore. AN: So...what'd ya think? Please let me know in a review.

Note to young players, to request categories, email . Disclaimer: I own not Cyrus, though I have to admit that John Malkovitch is so amazing that I almost wish I did. I'm telling you, he was pure brilliance in this after I'd just seen him as poor Lennie in Of Mice And Men. He is pure briliance. I said that already. Ok. I'll shut up. However, I invented all the circumstances around him and Debbie (who's mine) based off his quote \"You know what my Daddy taught me? Nothing.\" I tried to keep him in character but he's quite complicated, so it was hard... I can hear and see him saying all the words I've put in his mouth, so I hope it's ok. Anywho, enjoy! writingtitan would like her name to feature here somewhere. Big thanks to her for calling me insane. \"According to my last psych evaluation, yes...\" -for you! Deborah Nees stood gingerly in her sunny dayroom. Her strawberry-blonde hair was pulled back neatly into a ponytail. A string of brightly-coloured glass beads hung awkwardly from one wrist. She walked to the window and looked out at the way the cold light of dawn was casting hesitant shadows on the neatly-trimmed lawn. She liked the life she'd built for herself here in Alabama, everything tidy and organised and the way it should be. Her husband had wanted to move away when he heard about the prison they were building on the other side of town, but she had refused. She knew, just like Frankie did, that they would move him there. But she, unlike Frankie and despite what everyone else thought of him, knew she would find it comforting to have him near. A knock on the door startled her out of her reverie. It'd be the postman – perhaps today was the day they'd finally tell her he was coming. She weaved her way quickly around her furniture to the front door so that he wouldn't knock again; it was Saturday and Frankie was still asleep. Come to think of it, it was very early. A slight tremor kept Debbie's hand by her side in front of her oak door. What if it wasn't the postman? What if he'd been in their new prison for weeks and they hadn't told her? They usually gave people like her warning, but maybe they had thought… she took a hesitant step away from the door. What would happen if she just didn't open it? If it was him, he'd find another way to get in, and if it was the postman, he'd come back later. She took a deep breath, and opened to door. A flying fist found its way to within an inch of her nose; panicking, Debbie yelped and ducked. A brief exclamation came from the man at the door. \"Sorry!\" The voice was beautifully ordinary; she straightened up, laughing in weak-kneed relief. \"That's all right, John. I thought you might be… someone else.\" The postman grinned apologetically. \"I was just about to knock again when you opened the door. I'm a bit early, but I figured you'd be awake. I need a signature to show that you received…\" he pulled an ordinary envelope with an official-looking letterhead out of his small stack. \"This letter. Department of Corrections.\" Here it was. She took it slowly and signed his form. \"Thank you,\" she said. John the postman grinned and left. She hurried back to the dayroom and slit open the envelope. Dear Mrs. Nees, We regret to inform you that your brother, Dr. Cyrus Grissom, passed away on Thursday 5 th August. Debbie sat down heavily on her crisp white sofa. Not transferred, but dead? How? The incident occurred when Dr. Grissom hijacked a high-security transfer aircraft and crash-landed it in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip last Thursday. She almost laughed, terrible as that sounded. Of course he'd died in an insane escape attempt, free and with the sounds of it echoing in his ears. The way he would have wanted. Not that he would have wanted it at all, she knew, but it was small comfort. The remains are being transferred to Alabama this Sunday and you are free to make your own funeral arrangements from there. My consolations for your loss. The remains… it sounded so final. How had he died? Remains sounded like they'd be sending bits of him to her in a shoebox. There was no point in having a funeral. No-one would come. My consolations for your loss – she snorted in disgust. They were probably slapping high-fives to each other as she read it, joyous not to have to worry about his latest escape anymore. Who wrote these letters? She looked for a signature. US Marshall, Special Agent Vince Larkin. Prick. Debbie put the letter down on the coffee table and massaged her eyes with the heels of her hands. So Cyrus the Virus was dead. Her big brother. Her only family. A tear slipped from her hazel eyes. Why was she crying? Cyrus was the reason he was her only family. He'd killed their parents when Debbie was twelve and then dragged her all the way across the country avoiding the authorities. She was lucky she wasn't dead or in prison herself, according to the cops that had taken him away. But he'd always taken care of her all the same, defending her when their father was in a drunken rage, fending for her in the most obscure locations on the run, at least pretending to love her if, as they said, he was incapable of actual compassion. He'd spent twenty-five of his thirty-nine years in prison. The last time she'd seen him was in Colorado ten years ago when he'd escaped a sentence he was serving for killing seven of his inmates in a previous breakout. Debbie's fingers gently caressed the glass beads on her bracelet, his last gift to her, probably stolen, or at least bought with stolen money. The rain pulled her ragged fringe over her eyes, dripping water down her nose and into the long-cold coffee she had no intention of drinking. Cyrus sat opposite her, his fingers playing with the soggy sugar sachets in front of him, avoiding her eyes but gazing at her face. \"We should go inside,\" he said in his slow, precise manner, but she was too wet for it to make any difference now, and she shook her head. \"Debbie, I'm sorry.\" \" Sorry for what, Cyrus?\" she asked slowly. \"For killing Mum and Dad, for kidnapping me, for leaving me to foster care when you got yourself arrested, or for something you've done since then?\" He looked her in the eyes for the first time since he'd arrived. \"For hurting you. With all of it. I never wanted to hurt you. I love you, Deb.\" She hardly knew what to say. \"The police say you're incapable of love.\" \" Who do you trust, the police, or me?\" She felt like laughing. The police never kidnapped her, killed her parents or forced her to hide in bomb-shelters and old fridges from the people that could help her. And yet she knew he was right. She trusted him, impossibly, ludicrously, irrevocably. She sighed. \"What do you want, Cy?\" He looked away again and suddenly she felt as though a pressure had been lifted and she could breathe easier. \" I just wanted to say I'm sorry. And see you again.\" He twisted uncomfortably in his seat. \"I'd better go. I love you, Debbie, no matter what the cops say.\" \" I love you too, Cyrus,\" she said, and stood up to embrace him; her brother was oddly stiff in her arms as always and she squeezed him gently. \"Be careful,\" she told him. \" I'm always careful,\" he replied. \"See you around, Deb.\" He nonchalantly threw a giftwrapped box on the table between their untouched coffees and then he was gone with a flicker of her eyelids, like a plastic bag in a hurricane, blended into the crowd, unrecognizable even by his bald head. \"Deb?\" With a start, she realized she was sobbing, clutching at his bracelet, rocking gently on the clean sofa. Her husband Frankie stood in the doorway, tousle-haired with sleep, a concerned expression on his kind face. \"I heard the postman. What's happened?\" With trembling fingers she lifted Marshall Larkin's letter from the table and held it out to him. \"Cyrus is dead.\" \"Thank God, they should have given that freak of nature the needle years ago.\" A tremor shook Debbie's frame again. Frankie relented. \"Oh, God, Deb, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.\" He ran to sit next to her and took her in his arms. \"I'm sorry. All I meant was… he kidnapped you. The guy's a monster.\" \"He's my brother , Frankie,\" she sobbed. \"All right. I'm sorry.\" He held her tightly and they stayed like that, both of them thinking about the man who earned a doctorate in prison, escaped impregnable facilities and died flying airplanes into the middle of Las Vegas. A/N: Ok, lame ending, sorry. How are you supposed to describe the brilliance that is Doctor Cyrus Grissom without making yourself sound criminally insane?

Juarez's POV: It was another day at our headquarters, and I was updating my facebook. Blaster and Hurley were playing on their mini wii I knew this as Hurly was complaining that Blaster cheated, and Darwin was checking out his new motorcycle, his pride and joy. Yes, it was all normal indeed, until she came along. At lunchtime, Ben left, probably getting some equipment for us like he always does. So we didn't think twice about it. We did start to worry, though, at 8p. Normally he isn't out that late. We all started to speculate what he could be up to, when we heard his car come up the driveway. He came in with a silly little grin on his face and a box in his hand. We stared at the box curiously. He came in and placed the box down on the table and started to explain himself. \"Sorry I'm late, but I heard at the last minute from my friend about a guinea pig that, if she wasn't given a home today, was going to be a hairspray tester for suave. As you guys can probably tell, I got to her in time. Without further ado, I present to you: Abby\". And with that, he opened the box. Out stepped a honey-coloured guinea pig, about my age and size. I hate to say it, but she looked cute. And I wasn't the only one to notice. Blaster and Hurley were checking her out. Darwin was also, but in a different way. \"So what can you do, Abby?\" He asked, \"Do you have any strengths or weaknesses you might want to tell us about?\". So she responds, in an Australian accent , all of the things she could do. It was an annoyingly long list. Only Darwin seemed to pay any attention to it (the list). The other two couldn't seem to get past her accent long enough to know what an ego-maniacal chica she was. Neither could Darwin much, for that matter. He tried, though. You see him and Blaster like me. Hurley does a little bit, but food is much more important to him than any girl could be. Or so I thought. I sighed. Oh well, at least Darwin's trying. Anyway, so she was droning on and on, and I kept getting more bored by the second. She saw this, and said that maybe we would like to see what she could do instead of tell us. I told her that I'd rather see it tomorrow and get spared from her today. She looked hurt at my words. Blaster, Hurley, and even Darwin looked shocked and mad at what I said. I could see that they were about to say some pretty mean stuff, so I quickly scurried off to my room and shut the door. I was safe in there. They knew better than to enter without my permission, and they also knew that I wouldn't give them my permission. Not tonight, anyway. Sigh. I am so going to get it tomorrow. So what do you think it basically the origainal but it'll change over time so REVEIW love Unspoken Goodbyes[Chapter 2] Jaurez's POV: \"Another day to either enjoy or regret,\" I posted on Facebook. Yes indeed, today was going to be something. Abby was going to show us her stuff after breakfast, or so I was told by Darwin when he knocked on my door this morning. I'm kind of nervous about seeing them again. Even I have to admit that last night's behavior was a little rude. It was, though, true. You can tell already that she thinks she is something special. Please, I've done a lot more than her. I have invested a lot more time and energy into this team then she ever will! I mean, who was one of the millions of guinea pigs nationwide that stopped the world from total doom? I'll tell you who: me. Not her, me. Just as I finishing up on facebook a very old friend of mine popped up His name was Adan he worked for the Spanish government we were best friend but then came the time that Ben took me away to join G-force, \"Hey\" was written I the tiny blue box. \"Hiya\" I quickly replied then the conversation just flowed we talked about old times and we'd been up to recently, I would have loved to talk longer to him but he had to go so I reluctantly got up and went to breakfast. Everyone else was already there and had been for so time. They didn't say much to me, and I didn't' say much to them. Obviously, we all wanted to put last night behind us. Blaster and Hurley were talking to Abby all through breakfast. Darwin and Ben were talking about some future equipment. I was wishing that I had an iPod to listen to instead of everyone else enjoying each other's company. After breakfast was over, Abby started to show us her moves. I don't really know what she did, I zoned out after a minute. All I know is that everyone else looked really impressed. Oh well, she still isn't better than me. She finished after a while, and started taking bows. Wow. What a diva. Blaster went up to congratulate her, and how did she reward him: by giving him a kiss on the cheek ! On top of that, she was looking at me smugly the whole time. That's it. It . Is . War ! Screw trying to put last night behind me. Well, Blaster stood there like a love-stricken fool for about a minute, until he noticed me glaring at Abby. He told me off, and then whisked her away to who knows where while I stood there feeling betrayed. How could he have done something like that! He knew me way longer than her! I can't believe it. That perfect chica is stealing my men. And there isn't much I can do about it. There isn't much at all.[Chapter 3] The boys were going to go with Ben and check out some tools for new equipment. Abby said she would stay, so, of course, I stayed too. The boys looked worried and gave me a lecture on how Abby is new and that I should be nice to her. Please. As if. So they, with reluctance, left. Abby said, to nobody in particular, that she was going to go and train. That gave me the opportunity I was looking for. If she's gonna be a witch, then so will I. I snuck into her bathroom. Hello soap, meet my friend, honey. I'll just leave her here to get acquainted with you. Bwahahahaha! I went to the training area to see if she was there, but for some reason she wasn't. I wasn't too worried; in fact, I was hopeful. Maybe she got eaten by a hawk. I then went to my room and watched TV until the boys got back. Abby obviously got them on her radar, because she appeared as soon as the boys stepped in the house. Darn, hawks are so unreliable. You want to know something: that chica is a really big flirt. And the boys just eat it up! Men, watcha gonna do? She asked them to please pardon her appearance, she was working hard. Funny, she wasn't working but maybe half the time they were gone. Anyway, to my luck, she said she was going to take a shower. I skillfully took no notice, and didn't look at all suspicious. I went to my computer room and went to go on the computer, but there was a problem. The system was crashed! The only thing you could see was Abby blowing a kiss and words saying \"gotcha loser!\" on the screen. I am sorry to say that I might have freaked out a little. There was screaming, and a few tears. Darwin tried to comfort me, and Blaster kept insisting that it wasn't her. Hurley was too busy eating a muffin to notice that anything was wrong. That witch is going to pay, and soon. Seeming as she is in the shower. And speaking of her in the shower…is that her I hear screaming? Ah. Music to my ears, and happiness for my soul. Blaster went to see what was wrong with her, which was a big mistake. He got an earful. You could hear what she was saying as she was coming down the hall to my room. Darwin took one look at her, and one look at me, and said, \"meeting in the living room. Now.\" We all went to the living room, and sat down. Darwin was pacing back and forth, looking angry and serious. Blaster was looking furious, and Hurley actually put down the muffin to listen. Darwin asked us both what we did and why we did it. Then he gave us a strict lecture. And finally, he took the other two out into the hall to discuss what they should do to us. As soon as they left, we glared at each other. But we didn't dare speak, for fear that the boys would hear us. It didn't matter anyway, our eyes spoke our hatred of each other for us. When the boys came back in, we quickly looked at them and only them. We were about to hear our punishment. \"You two haven't taking a liking towards each other, that much is obvious,\" stated Darwin, \"but now you guys have taken it too far. Hurley, Blaster, and I have talked it over, and we have decide your fate: you shall.\" \"I don't care Darwin\" I said as I glared at them as I left the room. They stood there as I walked out they didn't even turn round to watch me go. Actually I don't care anymore[Chapter 4] At the moment I was lying underneath my table trying to fix my computer since that little witch crashed it. After about fifteen minutes of replacing cables and endless cursing the computer made the comforting whirling noise. So I slide out form underneath the table a sat on my spinning computer chair. I had only just logged into facebook intending to write away my problems when the door swung in and Abby strode in. I turned round in my chair planning on shouting at her till the middle of next week, but before I could even open my mouth she started talking. \"Right lets get this straight once and for all shall we?\" what the hell is she up I thought. \"I only going to say this once do you hear so listen up I'm here now and I always get what I want\" oh here we go \"and right now I want you gone I don't care where you go but you should never return her and if you do your face won't be pretty anymore\" I knew it she's worse than a cat I a bad mood ughh just wait till the boys hear this. \"You what?\" I practically screamed. \"Well I would have thought it was obvious that no one wants you here seems and Darwin, Blaster, Hurly and Ben all like me better that well you\" I just glared at her like she was the devil herself wait sorry she is. \"Oh and Juarez is you tell the boys about his well they will take my side one way or another so there's no point really\". She smirked. With that she left my room. I collapsed on my bed. She's right they all love her; ever since she came they had being paying attention to her. She said I should leave go far far away but where? Spain yeah I should got there I can speak the language and I have a friends over there they would love to have me right? That's it I'll ask Adan if they could have me as a member of there team so I e-mailed him saying something came up ad weather I could join there team. His response was almost instant he said sure we'd love you have you on our team I'll arrange a flight so I can come pick you up in 3 days time. I replied back saying that was fine I'd meet him at the airport.[Chapter 5] Okay thanks for the great support with this story i would just like to say a few things 1.

I am in the process of writing some new chapters so keep checking up they should be on soon any whoo Love you guys for being so supportive and i hope you continue to be xxx[Chapter 6] Three days later…. The alarm on her phone buzzed indicating that it was 8' o clock. It's time to get ready she thought. This would be easy as G –force were out on a recon mission, so she could easily get her stuff packed and ready for when Adan would pick her up. She started by getting her tough military standard back pack from her closet and packing a selection of her clothes. Once there was a padded layer she spans round to see if there were any items she wanted to take with her. She spotted a picture which sat idly on her bed side table, t that frame was a picture of a happier time when it was just her and G-force. Hm she thought I'll take it for the sake of it she placed it gently in her bag and proceeded to fill her bag – when her room was bare she sat on the bed and thought about what she was giving up. Her family. She stood up and made her way quietly over to the door, she didn't look back. She walked down the dark stair well and when she came to the main room she stopped and scanned the room. There sat ben reading the newest mission she wouldn't be going on. She slide past and ran through the small door and the bottom of the door used by humans. Outside sat in ball rolling ball was Adan she hadn't seen him since she was younger, he had grown, he stood tall and his fur was the black as the night they were stealing away in. His fir was roughed up in areas giving him the bad boy look, which most girls would fall over themselves to see. \"Jaurez\" he said his voice was like liquid chocolate. \" come here\" I walked over and he wrapped me up in is arms. I almost broke into tears but I couldn't no here not now. \" Let's go – I'm ready to start my new life\" I said smiling at him . \"Sure\" he smiled back and helped me into the ball as we drove off.

Okay so with that over and done with i would like to say tha"},{"Movie":"Con Air","Title":"A living Virus","Author":"AshtonCat","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11218751","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This is pure unbridled mind vomit that had to get out. Chapter 1 There was a blinding pain in his lower leg and he vaguely remembered Poe, the free man, the troublemaker, driving the sharp end of a broken stick through his shin and calf. His entire body felt on fire, it had been through quite a lot and not even Cyrus the Virus could handle all of this abuse. He didn't know where he was, but he was aware he was somewhere quiet and comfortable. His battered body laid to rest in a comfortable bed, too comfortable for it to belong in prison, or even a prison hospital ward. He must have had produced some sort of sound, because the reply that came was a soothing voice telling him to calm down and rest. Someone was touching him, and even though it didn't hurt, he tried to avoid the gentle hand. He wasn't keen on being touched. His father used to beat him senseless when he was just a little boy, and his mother, too drunk and hooked on crack to even notice, did nothing to protect her young son. The hand on his forehead disappeared and was replaced by two hands touching his painful leg, causing him to squirm. Someone was hurting him and he wanted that someone to go away and leave him the fuck alone, but the voice returned, now clear. \"Easy, easy, Cyrus. Calm down. I'm trying to help you\" A woman? There was a woman touching him? Whatever, woman or not, unhand me. He thought. Get your fucking hands off me, he continued squirming after a moment of confusion. \"Don't fight me, I'm not trying to hurt you. You're shivering..\" a soft blanket was placed over him and only now he noticed he was cold. \"Get.. away from.. me\" he managed to rasp, trying to sound as angry as possible. But the hands continued, unwrapping his leg, cleaning the wound with a biting substance and rewrapping it in clean, cool band aid. The woman didn't answer, simply continued cleaning his wounds and placing a cool, wet cloth on his sweaty forehead. It made him shiver even more and he closed his eyes to the fevered sensations that shocked his already weakened system. \"Sleep, Cyrus. You need to rest, or you will die.\" The woman spoke. \"Am I not dead? It feels like I'm dead. It feels like I'm in hell\" he mumbled, his head going from side to side in everlasting restlessness, never at peace, never relaxed. \"You're not in hell.. \" she answered, placing a warm hand on his freezing shoulder. Her touch hurt, his shoulder was too bruised up and he growled in pain. \"I'm sorry. I will tend to your bruises in a moment. Your leg needed to be treated first. Rest, Cyrus, all will be well\" she said. He concentrated on his breathing while she tended to his injuries, staring at the white ceiling. He slowly became more aware of his surroundings. His attention was drawn to his right side, where a machine announced his heart rate with a soft, rhythmical beep. He listened to it for a few minutes, as it slowly calmed down. \"Your heart is fine\" the woman spoke, her face coming into view as she hovered over him to refresh the cloth on his brow. \"It's just a precaution. You've been on it for the past few hours, I'll disconnect you in an hour or so if it keeps beating this beautifully\" she was young, too young, to be tending to a murdering bandit like him, he thought. Whoever put her in charge of such a dangerous and ridiculous task deserved a good beating. \"Now tell me, Cyrus. I need to know this, do you feel pain anywhere else but your leg and head?\" her question brought him out of his thoughts and he tried to lock eyes with her, but her image was still fuzzy and trying to focus hurt his head. There was no use playing the tough guy right now, she was trying to help him, and help he needed, he knew that much. \"Breathing..\" he answered, swallowing thickly. She nodded in understanding. \"You hit electricity wire during your fall off the crane. It's possible your lungs got a little fried, it'll pass in a few days. Let me know if you have any real trouble breathing, I'll give you some oxygen\" she sounded like a doctor. But not a prison doctor, they were never this careful with him, and they were hardly ever young females. He felt a short, sharp sting in his arm and moved his head to see what she was doing. \"it's alright\" she said, holding an empty syringe. \"It's for the pain. Try to get some sleep, are you warm enough?\" he was still shivering, but didn't feel cold so he nodded and closed his eyes. He was exhausted, and with no other men around, he felt like he could relax and sleep for a little bit, maybe half an hour. What could happen in half an hour that he needed to be awake for? The woman continued soothing him with words of comfort, atleast she wasn't going to do him any harm. He drifted off to sleep listening to her calming voice. \"when will he be fit for travel? He doesn't seem to be very gravely injured, does he?\" A male voice disturbed Cyrus in his much needed sleep and he frowned, not willing to wake up yet. His body felt sore, but the bed was comfortable and he was feeling warm. There was no way he was going to open his eyes right now. Vaguely, he heard his heart monitor beeping up a storm at the tension the male voice caused. \"He's waking up..\" the voice said. \"You need to leave. He needs to rest.\" That voice he recognized, it was hers. He opened one eye when he heard a door slam shut. The man was gone and the heart monitor calmed down again. \"I know you're awake, Cyrus. That was marshal Larkin coming to check up on me\" she said leaning over him and adjusting the covers on his bed. So the authorities knew where he was, splendid. That meant he needed to get away from his place as soon as possible. His opened eye jumped through the dim bedroom, looking for an exit or escape route, there was a window on his right side that looked out on the many lights in down town Las Vegas. She finally had enough of the heart monitor announcing the man in the bed was having a slight panic attack and turned it off, removing the pads on his chest carefully. \"How are you feeling?\" she asked simply, waiting for his reply. Still looking around the room, he was distracted. \"I'm okay\" he mumbled, trying to sit up. His body protested in every way possible, feeling muscles ache he never even knew he possessed. The room was spinning in front of his eyes and he felt like he was going to be sick, but she was there at his side, placing a cup of water in his hand. \"Drink\" she said. He did as he was told, something very unlike him. But what of it? She was helping him, and even though that was hard to imagine for him, he was willing to accept it while he still needed her aid. Someone probably paid her a shitload of money to take care of his sorry ass. Maybe Larkin himself, he seemed to be a goody two shoes now more than ever, perhaps he thought that a pretty little nurse was just the thing to lift the Virus' spirits. He snorted at the idea, sipping the cup of water rather gratefully, he was thirsty but hadn't realized it before. He blinked when she came into view, now finally able to make out her features more clearly. She really was a pretty young nurse, or whatever she did for a living, coddling convicts if that was a real profession. \"You gonna throw up?\" she asked, her hands in her sides. \"In a moment, probably\" he answered matter of factly. She placed a large metal bowl in his lap when he started sweating and swallowing nervously and looked at him sympathetically when he emptied the contents of his stomach in the surgical bowl. He rested his forehead in his hand to catch his breath when he was done and didn't even notice when she removed the bowl and left to clean it. \"The last time I felt this dreadful, stomach flu was going rapid in prison, one by one they fell. I had it too, felt like I threw up my entire digestive system\" he said. She placed the clean bowl on his side table and gently guided him to lay down again, placing a cool, wet cloth on his forehead like she had done before. \"I can't imagine what it would be like to be sick in prison\" she said, dabbing his sweated face. \"Pretty unfair, actually. You're already serving time for what you did by just being there every day for years. And on top of that you have to feel like utter shit too\" he explained, gazing at the ceiling. \"Did they come to help you?\" her question was of an innocence he hadn't seen in years and it almost made him chuckle. \"I believe they gave me aspirin for my sore abdomen the morning after\" she nodded, atleast that had been a good thing. \"But they had to send a doctor to me anyway because the fever had cooled me down so much, I was freezing to death right there in my cell. I remember asking a guard for an extra blanket, but that request was ignored unfortunately\" he continued, not feeling sorry for himself, simply telling her what happened to convicts if they fell ill. Then again, he didn't know how objective his story was, the guards treated him extremely bad, worse than others. \"Let me know when you need an extra blanket\" she said simply, smiling down at him. He was silenced by her kindness, not familiar with it, he had been in a rough environment for so many years. He hardly knew what to do when someone was just simply being nice to him. He nodded, awkwardly and turned on his side to make himself comfortable, his stomach protesting at the movement. He fell asleep listening to the rain outside.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 \"Cyrus?\" Leave me alone. Fuck off, whoever you are. \"Cyrus, it's Marshal Larkin. I know you're not feeling very well but I can't wait any longer, I need to discuss a few things with you. Don't you want to know why you're not in prison?\" Because it would look bad on your resume if I died, that's why, Cyrus thought. \"You owe it to Lillian over here to behave yourself and answer my questions, how about that? She's been working her butt off to care for you. And she has done a marvelous job too, you're on the mend\" So her name was Lillian than. Good to know, thanks for the information, now fuck off. \"You're starting to get on my nerves here, Cyrus\" Starting? Look what I did to your goddamn plane. Eventhough it wasn't my idea to crash it into Las Vegas. He listened as Larkin left his bedside with angry strides and smiled to himself when he heard the marshal sigh in annoyance. \"He refuses to talk to me, Lillian. Will you be so kind as to ask him these questions? Maybe he answers them if you ask. He's known to be rather polite to women\" Larkin said, handing Lillian a document. She nodded and stuffed it in her pocket. \"I'll try when he feels a little better\" she said, smiling lightly at the marshal. \"I'll come back tomorrow to see how you're doing.. and how he's doing of course, obviously\" Larkin said and walked back into the livingroom to see Cyrus sitting up slowly in his bed, their eyes met for a second, causing Cyrus to roll his eyes. \"I'm glad to see you up. You've been sleeping an awful lot, I was starting to worry\" the marshal said, walking up to the bed. \"Yeah, people tend to sleep a lot when they get thrown around like a ragdoll, Vince\" Cyrus sneered. \"You'll be alright, or so I've heard. Listen, you know just as well as I that this isn't permanent. Once you're healed, you're going back to prison. Just so you know, I've got guards all around the building, there is no way you can escape. I know you won't harm miss Porter over here, and I trust you not to change your mind about that. Do I have your word, Cyrus?\" Larkin asked, sounding as dead serious as he possibly could. \"why, marshal. Do I detect concern in your voice over little miss Lillian over here? Is she in any way related to you perhaps?\" the marshal rolled his eyes. \"If you must know, yes. She's my sister's daughter. She volunteered for this and she's been watching over you ever since we brought you in here, and she's been doing it with more love and tenderness than you ever deserved, alright Cyrus?\" The criminal simply nodded in understanding, he never disliked the marshal, and he could easily promise to never hurt his niece. \"How did you get the blue prints of the plane?\" straight to the point the marshal was. Cyrus thought for a moment, how did he get those blue prints again? He flinched when he hurt his head by making his brain go into overdrive. \"I bought them from another convict that worked in the library\" he said, rubbing his temples. \"and how did he get his hands on those blue prints?\" Larkin asked, but Cyrus shook his head. \"I have no idea. I didn't know he had them till someone told me about it. I guess he wasn't all that good in keeping secrets\" \"who is this contact in South America that you apparently worked for?\" \"Cindino. A convict from another prison.\" \"You two were friends?\" \"Until it turned out he set me up. I set him on fire\" \"who shot the DEA?\" \"I did when he threatened to kill me. He did it himself, you know. I didn't know who he was and I didn't give a shit either. I thought he was another convict. Another one that couldn't keep his secrets to himself\" Lillian interrupted holding a glass of water. \"I think that's enough for today. He shouldn't be up for this long\" she handed Cyrus the glass and looked up at the marshal, who nodded in defeat. \"No, marshal. It's way past my bed time. I think I missed sesame street because of this interview\" the criminal sneered. Larkin gave him an unamused glare while pulling on his coat. \"you behave yourself\" he said and left the apartment. The criminal lay back down slowly, the ordeal had exhausted him. He had begun to doze off when he felt something cool against his forehead, Lillian was dabbing his brow with another compress, trying to help him fight his fever. He gazed at her for a while with his usual unreadable expression. \"well, well miss Lillian Porter. Taking care of dangerous convicts like you would take care of a sick puppy, aren't we? Well I suppose being the marshal's niece, if anything should happen to you, you know how to get your revenge\" Cyrus said, closing his eyes once more, the light hurting his tired eyes. \"I suppose I could should I wish for it. Get some rest now\" she answered. He sighed, he wanted to, but he couldn't right now. \"Help me out of this bed\" he grumbled and sat up once again. \"You shouldn't be up, Cyrus, your leg..\" \"Hurts like a motherfucker, little bitty miss Lillian dear.. but if I don't take a piss right now, I'll be doing it allover your pretty, white sheets\" he shot back, rendering her silent. He gingerly put some of his weight down on his wounded lower leg and hissed in pain, grabbing a chair to hold himself up. She reached out to support him, but changed her mind, she figured he might not want to feel weak. He limped away and locked the bathroom door behind him, giving her time to change the sheets on his bed. It was in the bathroom that he realized he was wearing nothing but his underwear, and that wasn't even underwear he recognized. So that's why he was so cold, was he that much out of it? Get your shit together, Cyrus. How are you ever going to get yourself out of this joint if you're not even aware of what you're wearing? He left the bathroom and slumped down on her couch while the young girl was still cleaning up his bed. \"You do this more often?\" he asked. She looked up at him. \"what, cleaning the bed?\" she said. \"Volunteering to take care of a murdering, escaped convict\" \"Oh, no this is my first time actually. Someone had to do it. Your bed is ready\" he simply stared at her, trying to make sense of what she told him. \"I suppose a hospital could have done this too, with less chance of me escaping, hijacking another plane and killing more people. Not to mention the risk I could be to your safety. I just wonder what made you decide to volunteer for this\" he said. She shrugged, cleaning up his side table. \"And drag your bed into your living room\" he continued, raising his eyebrows in question. \"I needed room for all this equipment\" she said, pointing at the heart monitor and oxygen tanks. \"why, though? Aren't you scared? At all?\" he asked, calmly. \"Should I be, Cyrus?\" he chuckled bitterly. What was left of him probably didn't look all that threatening, he could hardly walk to the bathroom by himself. \"Guess not\" he mumbled. After a moment of silence she walked over to the couch and sat down beside him, holding out her hand for him to shake. \"Perhaps it's time for a proper introduction. Hello, I'm Lillian Porter\" he hesitated for a moment but then took her hand in greeting. \"Cyrus Grissom\" he said. \"I know this all might seem strange to you, but I couldn't let them take you with them. You would never heal if they brought you back to prison right away. Don't you know you're malnourished? We ran a blood test on you, your vitamin levels are the worst I've ever seen\" he waited till she was done with her little rant. No, he didn't know he was malnourished, then again he never really gave a rat's ass about his health. He had been in prison for 25 years, no exactly good for one's health either. \"Vince called me when they found you and asked me to do this\" she finally confessed, making him chuckle softly. Marshal goody two shoes to the rescue. \"That must have been an interesting phone call\" he replied, making her laugh. \"they had placed you on a blue police coat and were busy hooking you up to fluids. Someone was holding a shirt to the wound on your head, you were bleeding out in front of us. I had to decide right there\" she continued, he was silent. \"Vince told me what had happened and who you were and what kind of interactions you had with him. He told me you'd never harm me. You never hurt any women\" Well, he put a gun to the head of that female guard on the plane. But other than that, he couldn't remember if he ever really harmed a woman. \"You were so tired, Cyrus\" I still am, he thought. I'd be in that bed snoring up a storm right now if it was up to me. \"How long have I been here?\" he asked simply. \"three days. You slept through the whole one and a half day. I was worried you might have slumped into a coma, but the doctor said you were simply sleeping. You reminded me of my cat. I got her out of the shelter, she slept for three days straight when I took her home. Sleep off the prison bars, they called it\" she said, smiling kindly at him. \"Lucky cat\" he mumbled, letting his eyes roam through the livingroom. She had a nice apartment. Spacious and well furnished, a cozy home. \"so you're going to hand my back over to your beloved uncle once I'm healed?\" he asked. She nodded after a moment. \"when you're strong enough to go back to prison\" he corner of his mouth twitched in a small smile \"well I guess I'm going to have to find ways to convince you I'll be a sick puppy for the next three months then, hm?\" he said, looking at her. \"You could try\" she answered. He nodded and got up from the couch, needing to lay down again, he limped back to his bed and lay down. \"Nurse, oh nurse.. I think it's time to tuck me in now. Will you read me a story, nurse?\" he said, causing her to roll her eyes. \"You're a big boy, Cyrus. I think you can manage that on your own\" he faked a look of hurt and disappointment. \"Now, miss Porter, I liked you much better when you still thought I was dying. Where did all the coddling go? I kinda liked it. Should I cough a little, would that help?\" he was mocking her, and she didn't like it, he could feel her withdraw more and more. \"Get some sleep, Cyrus\" she said and left the room, closing the door to her office so he was left alone with his growing headache. Now he felt bad for offending her. Cyrus, you dick. Show some gratitude or atleast be polite to a woman that is risking her life and reputation to get you back on your feet. That girl has taken better care of you in three days than your mother did in 14 years. He sighed in frustration with himself. Being nice was hard, really hard. \"Hey!\" he yelled, deciding to apologize. \"Come back!\" when she didn't respond he grumbled. \"I fell out of bed! I'm bleeding!\" he yelled, lying to get her out of that office room. She appeared in the doorway, annoyed. \"stop being the boy that cries wolf too many times. If something does happen to you someday, I won't come because I'll think you're putting on a show again. What is it?\" she said. He bit his lip for a moment. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have mocked you. Stay here, I like your company\" he tried to sound as sincere as possible, but she didn't move out of the doorway, she simply crossed her arms in reply, gazing at him. \"Oh come on, sweetheart. Don't be like that now. What do I need to do? Buy you roses?\" he sneered, getting impatient. She chuckled and shook her head, walking up to his bedside. \"I don't want to give Vince a reason to kill you. You're better off not giving me anything, especially not roses\" she said, straightening the covers on his bed. \"Ah no, we don't want dear uncle to think our relationship goes beyond that of a nurse and her patient, do we? Tell me though, are you a nurse?\" he asked, making himself comfortable in the bed, gazing up at her. \"I'm a veterinarian\" she answered. He laughed. \"of course you are. And you were just the person to take care of this animal. This explains the whole sick puppy thing, although I do believe I'm more talkative than most of your patients\" \"You're not an animal, Cyrus. I should know. Maybe you started feeling like one after being in prison for so long\" she said, her smile disappearing. She adored her freedom, she couldn't imagine giving it up and living in prison for 25 years. \"I have a rather convincing bark, though. I fooled many guards with my dog barking skills. Another thing I could train to perfection with this excessive amount of time they give when they lock you up\" she stared at him for a moment but then bursted out laughing. \"You barked at prison guards?\" she asked. He chuckled and shrugged, he couldn't deny he liked her more when she was laughing about him instead of being upset with him. \"Only if they deserved a concert\" he replied and sighed, his headache was ruining his conversation with the first friendly person he met in a long, long time. \"Are you alright?\" her voice snapped him out of his frustration and he nodded, giving her a slight assuring smile. \"I don't think any nurse or doctor could have done a better job fixing up this wild dog though, miss Porter, for what it matters coming from one\" he said. She was rendered silent for a couple of minutes. \"Thank you, Cyrus. You can call me Lillian if you want\" she answered. He rolled onto his side, his back to her, this woman was reopening wounds and awakening feelings he thought he silenced years ago. Things you lose when you serve a long time behind bars. The first five years are the toughest, it's when you have to learn to accept you'll never get out, even if you do manage to escape, they'll find you someday and bring you back. He never wanted to go back to feeling those realizations again, so he turned his back to her kind face and closed his eyes. \"Lillian then, whatever you wish\" he mumbled. he felt her adjust the covers of the bed and pull them over his shoulders, then she walked away, leaving him to get some rest. The last thing he heard before drifting off to sleep, was the persistent meow of a hungry cat.[Chapter 3] Told you I'd continue this. Enjoy. \"His fractured ankle is the main concern right now. I mean.. I saw the photos, it's.. a mess. But all the other stuff will heal without him noticing too much discomfort.\" Larkin's whiny voice kept bothering him whenever he was asleep. \"But he's gotta be able to move around with ease. It's a pretty tough crowd he's heading back into.\" Wonderful. \"They'll turn him into dogfood in a hot second if he'd so much as limp.\" Amazing. Was there anything dear Marshal Larkin didn't know something about? \"You sure he's fine without those heart monitors?\" \"There's nothing wrong with his heart.\" Lillian's voice was as calm as always, nothing of Larkin's agitated giddiness seemed contagious enough to affect her. \"He's got a very strong one according to the surgeon. He thinks that's what saved his life.\" A short silence followed. Larkin obviously didn't know how to respond to his cousin's observations. \"We're still looking for Garland Green.\" He got away? Nice fuck up, Vince. There's going to be a trail of dead children from Vegas to Denver. He wondered if Johnny 23 got out too. Last time he saw the famous rapist he was yelling at him to wake up after receiving quite the painful blow to the head with the end of a rifle. Sally Bishop. Lovely girl. A real treasure to the Department of Corrections. There was going to be a permanent dent in his forehead for the rest of his sorry life. But atleast Johnny 600, or whatever he liked to call himself, never got his hands on her. If he was out there, he could run into Lillian. There would be no more exceptions for him if he dared to lay a hand on Cyrus' pretty little nurse. No exceptions indeed. \"Fireworks tonight, Lilly. You'll be alright?\" \"Yea.\" Her voice was soft, but had a hint of nervousness to it now. \"I'm not alone this time.\" Aww. The sweetheart. That's right, honey. Cyrus The Virus will protect you from the fireworks. Whatever the fuck that meant. What, literal fireworks? It was Vegas after all. Fireworks was kind of a thing down here. \"Right. You two will be cuddling on the couch together, or what?\" Jealous much, Vince? \"Listen, Lilly, I'm starting to think this wasn't such a great idea after all. He wasn't supposed to live through this. You know that, right?\" Funny little fucker, aren't you, marshal Larkin? Lillian seemed at a loss for words now. Not sure how to respond to her cousin's crude comments in the presence of the subject itself. \"I know he wasn't supposed to survive this.\" Ah. So this whole set up was just a death bed. She finally admitted to it. Something she hadn't dared to mention straight into his face. \"But isn't it a good thing he's going to be alright? I don't want him dead, and neither do you.\" The marshal didn't respond right away, and for a moment, Cyrus expected him to deny his cousin an answer. \"Vince..?\" Her voice, full of doubt, filled the quiet room with the same gentility that had probably made the difference in Cyrus' prognosis. \"Of course I don't want him dead. I don't wish death upon anyone.\" Yawn. You'd be saying something different if it was Johnny 23 up for debate right now, marshal goody two shoes. \"But I don't want him to be fully recovered and in one apartment with you either, Lilly. The… The idea he could be gaining his strength as we speak and.. \" Yes? Finish your sentence, come on. Don't be scared to say it. You put her in this situation after all, you incredibly dense naive fuck. It would be your head on a platter if something should happen to her, and the guilt would eat at your soul for the rest of your people loving shit life. And the best part? I'd be back in jail, and I will make sure you look me in the eyes every time you pass my cell. \"Why are you so worried out of a sudden?\" She sounded defiant. That's right, sweetheart. Make him question this whole thing until it robs him off his sleep. \"You weren't worried about it earlier. Just because we all thought he was dying?\" Before Larkin could answer, Cyrus decided to let everybody know he was no longer asleep and sat up gingerly, his body protesting against the movement. Perhaps he wasn't dying, but he was far from healed. She was at his side in a hot second, readjusting the pillows behind his back so he could lean into them comfortably. \"Did we wake you?\" she asked apologetically. Cyrus kept his gaze locked on the agitated marshal and nodded. \"I'm sorry. We should have been more quiet.\" \"That's alright.\" Cyrus reassured her, giving her an innocent smile before looking back at her cousin. \"I was getting hungry anyway.\" Larkin rolled his eyes, his hands in his sides as he watched Cyrus push it even further by giving him a small wink. \"Are you here to bring me my wonderful prison dinner, marshal? I'm sure miss Lillian over here has a microwave to heat it up for me. Unless you want me to eat it cold, of course.\" Larkin pointed a warning finger at his prisoner but didn't quite know what to say. \"Like your boys enjoyed to turn off the hot water system every time certain prisoners took a shower. Including me.\" Cyrus continued. Larkin narrowed his eyes, but backed down when he caught the furious look on Lillian's face. \"That's torture!\" she said sharply. \"How could you allow that?!\" \"Yes, Vince. How could you allow that?\" Cyrus mimicked her exasperated tone, mocking his offense. \"I haven't taken a hot shower in over twenty years. That's your wonderful team of guards, marshal. So honourable and dignified. Truly a gem to the system!\" He was going to say more when he started coughing. His lungs were still healing, and he doubled over until he tasted blood. Her calming hand on his shoulder offered more comfort than he wanted to admit, and he allowed her to guide him back into the pillows. \"That's enough.\" She instructed kindly, dabbing his forehead gently. \"Let me handle this.\" He smirked at himself, still swallowing thickly to lubricate his swollen throat, and looked over at the dumbfounded marshal about to receive the treatment from his protective cousin. He had an ally now, and he was going to abuse that as much as he could. She walked up to Larkin, took him by his arm and pulled him away from her patient. Leading him to the kitchen and closing the door behind her, where Cyrus could still hear every word. \"Vince, I want you to explain to me, once and for all, how you envisioned this whole thing if he would live?! What am I supposed to feed him?! Am I allowed to let him take a hot shower or is he supposed to never wash himself until he's back behind bars?! Hm?!\" \"Lillian, please! I.. I never thought the man would live long enough to be up for such things! I don't know if I can arrange prison meals to be delivered here, I've never done this before! There's no protocol for situations like these. I don't even know if what I did is legal or not!\" They talked about him like he was some sort of terminally ill foster dog that needed to die or be send back to the shelter. He didn't want her to wind herself up over feeding him, he never ate much anyway and was pretty sure he could go without food for a few days, he had done all that before. That hot shower however.. he was going to push that one through one way or the other. The dear thing might even have a bathtub. While listening to their heated discussion, Lillian's cat jumped upon his bed and decided to curl up on the footend, purring up a storm. He now wondered if she'd fear for her cat's safety. There was nothing she had to worry her pretty little head over when it came to animals. He shifted his wounded leg underneath the covers, grimacing at the movement, to give the cat more room. He watched her kneed the blanket with her little paws, her eyes narrowed to slits in pure content as she purred while the argument in the kitchen continued without fail. \"You better start writing protocols for this cause it's happening in my home right this minute!\" She was livid, and rightly so. \"What kind of doctor examined him that he told you the man was dying! That he only had days left before his organs would fail! And all those stupid blood tests and samples!\" Calm yourself, sweetheart. \"And now you don't know what to do when he's showing signs of recovery! What if he kills me?!\" what indeed, marshal. \"What if he rapes me?!\" Alright, that's enough. With the greatest possible difficulty, Cyrus pushed himself out of bed, ignoring the agitated mewls of the cat being disturbed during her beauty sleep. A shirt would be nice. But he was going to have to set this straight in his underwear. He limped over and knocked on the door to the kitchen, the argument taking place behind it stopped immediately. \"hey, if you two are done bickering about when and how I'm going to die maybe it's a good idea to have her read my files so she knows what to expect.\" He leaned against the door, trying to hear what was being said, but his voice had rendered them both speechless. He sighed in annoyance. \"Either you let her read it, or I'll tell her all about it in so much colour, detail and imitated voices she'll be ready for the nuthouse once I'm finished, alright Larkin?\" something moved behind the door, and he stepped away before it could bump into his already sore body. The marshal appeared, looking like a guilty school boy who had just received the lecture of a lifetime from his mother. He ran his hand through his dark hair as he passed his prisoner and paced around the living room like he expected the solution to be written on a piece of furniture. Lillian appeared rubbing her arms shyly and allowed Cyrus to play doorman for the time being. \"Maybe..\" Larkin started, gazing out of the window at the bright lights of downtown Las Vegas. \"Maybe I should just have him transported back to prison. Have him receive medical attention there.\" \"I'm right here, Vince.\" Cyrus said. \"I know I don't get to decide over my own fate, but you could atleast show me the courtesy to stop talking about me like I'm not in the room.\" Meanwhile, Lillian was so obviously trying to avoid eye contact it was getting silly, and he realized it was probably because there was a half-naked criminal standing right beside her. \"And I know you're not into sexual intimidation either, so perhaps you could grand me the dignity of clothes next time you stop by to see if I raped your cousin yet.\" From the corner of his eyes, he could see her shy away from him more and more. \"I despise rapists, miss Porter.\" He told her, aware that his tone was cold and far from convincing right now. \"I've never done anything remotely resembling it, but I understand the confusion seeing I'm up and about and dressed in nothing but shorts.\" He gave the marshal a pissed look, and the latter cleared his throat in slight embarrassment. \"Clothes, marshal. To make the lady and everybody else feel a lot more comfortable.\" \"Right, yes. Of course.\" Larkin nodded, scratching the back of his head. \"No problem. I can get you that.. tonight, if you want. Scrap that, of course you want that. Lilly, I'm sorry.. we'll work this out. I can.. handcuff him if it makes you feel better.\" His eyes went from her to his prisoner, like he was looking for support from the mastermind behind his crashed airplane, but Cyrus only raised an eyebrow at him and said nothing. \"Handcuff him to the railing of the bed.\" Larkin continued, pulling out a pair of handcuff from his belt. \"Oh, marshal, what a great idea.\" Cyrus sneered. \"That's right. Handcuff a half-naked man in a vulnerable, sexual tinted position to a bedpost. That's going to make everybody feel right at ease with one another.\" Defeated, Larkin lowered the handcuffs, looking like his birthday had just been cancelled. \"Will you use my right wrist for it? Cause that one's already been through hell and back from having my full body weight hang on to it. It'll be extra sadistic and just the thing your institution is all about.\" He held up his right arm, showing the dark, angry looking bruises in a ring around his wrist. Larkin straightened his posture, looking offended. \"Don't act like you've been mandatorily tortured, Cyrus. Cause that's bullshit and you know it. You're just trying to make Lillian feel sorry for you.\" The marshal shot back. \"You know what's in your files too? You're a master manipulator. You're smart and she-\" \"She's not?\" Cyrus filled in for him, causing the man to pale at the deeply offended look his cousin threw at him. \"Careful, marshal. You don't want to make this too easy for me, do you?\" Ignoring Cyrus for a brief moment, Larkin turned to his young niece. \"Lilly, it's up to you. If you don't feel safe having him here, I'll have him removed. Or if you want me to handcuff him for you, I'll do that.\" She didn't seem sure, and gave the prisoner a timid glance, worried about his reaction should she tell her cousin to restrain him in order to feel safe in her own house. But Cyrus looked impassive, and left the decision entirely up to her. \"I don't want you to hurt his wrist even more.\" she said with a small voice after a few minutes of silence. \"He's too wounded to go back to prison, Vince. You said that yourself.\" \"Yes. I did.\" The marshal nodded. \"But if it's either you or him than that's a pretty easy decision for me.\" He looked at Cyrus. \"No offense.\" \"None taken.\" The prisoner replied dryly. Lillian was about to reply to her cousin's words when she noticed something else. \"You're shivering.\" She stated sympathetically to her charge. \"Yes, I'm cold.\" He didn't sound surprised at her observations. He had been standing there in his underwear, balancing himself on one leg while leaning against the kitchen door with his one good hand for far too long. His head throbbed, his spine was on fire and his insides felt like he had swallowed a pack of razor blades. He reached up to rub his eyes in an attempt to get rid of his dizziness, but it didn't do much and he could feel his knees start to buckle under his weight. \"And since no one is going to hand cuff me, I'll be in my bed.\" He forced himself to move past the two relatives, and dragged himself back to the only place he wanted to be right now. On top of the softest matrass he had had the pleasure of laying on in about 25 years, underneath a stack of warm blankets and a big, fat, purring cat. Lillian turned to the marshal, who was temporarily distracted by Cyrus' spell of weakness. \"He may not be dying but he's far from out of the woods.\" She whispered to him intently. \"I want his files. I want to know who he is, what he's done, and what everybody still thinks he's up to in the state he's in right now.\" Larkin nodded gravely at his cousin's orders. \"I want you to get him something to wear, because the last thing he needs right now is a lung infection. And I want permission from you to give him something to eat.\" The last request seemed to be met with more reluctance from the marshal. \"You're not going to cook for him, Lilly.\" He warned her. \"He's still incarcerated and should be treated as such.\" \"You're killing him, Vince.\" She shot back dryly. \"If he doesn't eat and drink his body will use up the little reserves it has and then break down. I don't want to be responsible for this man's starvation because of the rules of bureaucracy.\" Her cousin was silent. \"Does he have any allergies?\" \"What? No. I don't know!\" Larkin answered fervently, she hushed him quickly, not wishing to disturb the tired convict even more. \"I'd have to check his medical files for that.\" The marshal continued, now whispering. \"I want those too.\" The girl spoke determinately. \"If he's going to live, he's got a long road to recovery and we'll need all the information we can get.\" Her cousin nodded in approval. \"But I'll start with making him bacon and eggs. I'm sure he didn't have that in a long time.\" Larkin looked over at the man in the bed, breathing heavily under the covers. Cyrus was still far from ready to be send back into the hellhole from which he came, and his niece seemed quite determined to help him. He had instigated this project, it had no use to talk her out of it now. \"I'll be back with the files and some stuff for him to wear as soon as I can. It'll involve some paperwork and convincing people, so it might not be till tomorrow morning. But I think he'll be in a horizontal position for the rest of the evening.\" \"If not, he can laugh at me while I cower under the bed during that damn fireworks show.\" Lillian said. Larkin chuckled and pulled her into a comforting hug, which she grudgingly accepted. \"Call me when there's a problem, alright? I'll be back first thing tomorrow.\" With a last kiss to her forehead, the marshal left her apartment. He closed the door behind her, locking it from the outside, leaving her, once again, at the mercy of a dangerous convicted murderer. It was around midnight when Cyrus woke with a splitting headache. All was dark in the room, with no trace or sign of Lillian. He jumped a little when a loud bang caused the windows to vibrate, and a bright flash of red light lit up the room for a split second. The firework show had begun, and he could vaguely hear people cheering down below. For as long as that stupid shit was taking place, there would be no more sleep for him. He pulled himself out of bed and wrapped one of the blankets around himself to keep warm. His head pounded in protest at standing up, but he wanted to know what marshal Larkin's dear little niece was up to. Another bang that sounded like any explosion he ever witnessed lit up the room with a green flash, and he decided he wasn't much of a fan of fireworks either. He roamed the dark apartment, limping heavily, in search of his caretaker. \"Come out, come out wherever you are.\" He singsonged to himself softly, opening several doors only to be met by more dark rooms. He found her in the last room he hadn't checked, a little back office. Her presence was only betrayed by the cat announcing his arrival with a loud meow. He halted in the doorway, searched the walls with his hand for the switch and turned on the ceiling lamp. She was sitting underneath her desk, two pillows pressed against her ears and looked up blinking harshly against the light. He tilted his head at her in slight question and curiosity. \"You do this every time there's a fireworks show going on?\" Slowly, she lowered the pillows, placing them on her drawn up knees. \"Pretty much.\" She answered sheepishly, fumbling with the tresses on the cushions. \"It's not every night during the off season. But.. in the spring and summer, they do it.. daily. To entertain the tourists, you know.\" \"I see.\" The cat meowed again, and rubbed herself against his legs affectionately. \"Well, I'm going to make coffee. You want some?\" She frowned in confusion, and was about to say something when another loud bang caused her to cry out in fear and press her hands against her ears. \"I'll be in the kitchen.\" He said dryly, and turned around, leaving the light on so she couldn't see the bright coloured flashes. The cat followed him happily, her tail high up, and jumped upon the counter while he worked on the coffee. He half expected Lillian to eventually join him to atleast see if he wasn't turning her coffee machine into a homemade bomb, but she remained invisible. Once the coffee was ready, he moved back into the living room, now half expecting to find the girl there, but he had the room to himself again and sipped at his cup while gazing out of the big balcony windows at the crowd below, cheering at every festive explosion of sparks and colours. For a brief moment, he wondered what Garland was up to, somewhere out there in the city butchering a toddler probably. Then again, he didn't really care. The coffee sank mercilessly into the pit of his hollow stomach, and he could feel his intestines turn sour. Making a face at his own pale reflection in the glass doors, he placed a hand on his rioting stomach. After a few minutes, his own reflection wasn't the only one, and he watched her face become clearer and clearer as she approached him, still holding the pillows tightly pressed against herself. She stood beside him, thinking about what to say, and suddenly started chuckling. \"People can see you, you know. Standing here in your underwear with a cup of coffee.\" He raised his hand and waved carelessly, like he was greeting the crowd below. She laughed. \"I had to get used to these doors.\" She rubbed her arms nervously. \"And the neighbours. There's an old lady called Mrs Jennings living in the apartment next to me. She gets out on her balcony to say something the moment I step outside.\" He didn't respond. \"I guess she's just lonely.\" He handed her his cup, indicating for her to take a sip, and rubbed his scruffy chin in contemplation. \"I see. And how about you?\" He asked. She blinked. \"What about me?\" \"Are you lonely?\" He didn't seem that interested about her answer, so she wondered where this question came from. \"Well, not right now.\" She said, blowing on the hot beverage, she gave him a small smile, but he didn't meet her gaze. \"I'm not alone right now.\" \"Yes, well, this isn't permanent.\" Cyrus spoke calmly. \"And not exactly what I meant either.\" He watched another rocket hit the sky and explode in a wild variation of colours and sparks, followed by a loud bang that made Lillian jump behind his back. \"careful not to spill that coffee now.\" He chided gently. A few more of the same cheery colourful rockets followed the first one, and after a last loud bang, the crowd started cheering indicating that the show was over. \"Well, we seemed to have survived through that pretty good, won't you think?\" He peered over his shoulder at the shivering form of Larkin's cousin, her big doe eyes meeting his for a second. \"Are you okay?\" She nodded vigorously. \"Good.\" He turned to fish the cup out of her shaking grip to take another sip himself. It took a few minutes for her to regain her bearings, but he remained where he was, not moving from his spot until she was ready, and sipping his coffee while quietly enjoying the night view of the city. When she finally appeared from behind him, tucking strands of her hair behind her ear nervously, she dared not to look at him. \"I'm sorry about that.\" She said. \"Hm. Well you don't bother me half as much with this as you bother yourself.\" He explained, studying the many neon signs below. Not that it mattered, but he hadn't been able to look at anything else but the walls of his cell for quite some time, so this was a welcome distraction. \"Do these doors open?\" He asked, feeling the sudden need for some fresh air as his stomach turned unpleasantly. Her eyes widened at his request. \"Vince sort of told me not to let you out. That probably includes the balcony.\" At the mention of the marshal's name, Cyrus was already fumbling with the lock and opened the two grand balcony doors to let a rush of cool night air enter the apartment. He stepped out onto the small balcony, feeling his body instantly react to the cold air and every hair on his skin stand up, but his stomach settled. Despite now shivering like a new-born kitten, he smiled at himself and peered curiously over the modern looking, metal railing. He hadn't figured out on which floor he was yet, but now he knew. The apartment building had about ten floors, and they were almost at the top, only two balconies above them. He listened to the sounds of the city below. Loud music, car horns and drunk people having a good time. The siren of a police car sounded all too familiar to his ears. There was no way he could escape from this height. It made him dizzy even thinking about climbing over the banister. From a small distance, Lillian watched him examine her balcony like he hadn't been on one before. She rubbed her arms against the cold and wondered if his fever made him unable to accurately feel the outside temperature. The air smelled like rain. And even though the sky was still clear, and stars were visible, she knew the signs of a brewing storm in the distance. \"Cyrus!\" she tried to lift her voice over the strong gusts of wind, but he couldn't hear her. \"Cyrus, you're going to catch cold!\" But he was too occupied with what seemed like the balcony of her downstairs neighbours, to pay any attention. Worried he might worsen his condition, she went back inside to get a blanket, and walked up to him slowly. She also realized he hadn't been outside for a long time, and he was probably just enjoying himself too. \"Cyrus.\" She spoke more softly, now right behind him. He had heard her this time. \"What?\" He said, still stretching himself out, hanging dangerously over the railing. He felt her wrap the blanket around his cold shoulders, and held it there in fear of the wind taking it. Her gentle hands against his sore back made him eventually turn to face her, taking hold of the blanket himself. \"Thank you.\" He had to raise his voice to let himself be heard too, but she wasn't looking for a conversation, she just stood there looking worried. \"I'm fine.\" He assured her. \"Admiring your view.\" The dear thing just nodded, her long auburn hair dancing wildly in the wind. He was shivering, and couldn't feel his feet from standing on top of half frozen concrete for too long, but the fresh air had done him more good than harm, he was sure of that. Then again, he liked her more when she was smiling. \"Wanna go out and have a steak with me? I don't need pants for most of these joints anyway, right?\" she laughed despite trying not to, and her giggling was more contagious than he liked to admit. His stupid joke had worked, and she took a step closer to him, closing their distance, to reach out and rub his arms in order to get some warmth into his limbs. He winced a little at his sore muscles being touched, but he didn't want to push her off, she meant well. Easy, sweetheart, take it easy on me. \"Let's get back inside.\" He offered. Together they moved back into the warmth, and out of the wind. She closed and locked the glass balcony doors behind them, and drew the curtains to shut out the rest of the world for now. Gingerly, he sat down on the edge of his bed, slightly breathless from the cold and the hard wind. He watched her do everything in her power to somehow build up a barrier between her cosy living room and the rough nightlife down below. Why this girl ever happened to live in this ridiculous city was beyond his comprehension. She didn't seem like the outgoing type at all. His skin burned and tingled now it slowly warmed up again, and he could feel his arms throb from the rubbing treatment they had received. That was all going to be sore as anything in the morning, but what else was new. It was 1:30 in the morning, and she yawned into the sleeve of her cardigan. It was time to break up the party. \"Time for bed, sweetheart.\" He told her dryly. She nodded, rubbing her eyes like a small child, and walked over to him. \"Can I get you anything? A painkiller or something?\" she offered in a sluggish, tired way that made him let out a gruff chuckle. \"How about a bedtime story?\" He smiled his wolf like grin, wiggling his shoulders. \"Once upon a time..\" \"There was a convict..\" she filled in. He rolled his eyes dramatically. \"oh, I don't like this story already.\" Once again, her giggling made him smile. \"Just get some rest, Cyrus. I'll see you in the morning.\" He followed her with his eyes until she closed the door to her own little bedroom. Where she slept on a rickety old stretcher for his sake. He looked down at his bruised wrist, examining it like he hadn't seen it before. Sleep would probably be a good idea for him too. He got up, opened the curtains again and returned to his bed. He wasn't going to be denied his view of the night sky for one second longer. R&R; ","Summary":" This is pure unbridled mind vomit that had to get out.

What more needs to be said? I do own the concept of the agency they are in throughout this story. It is called S.I.P. (Super Inter-dimensional Police), and they are the best agents in the rodent division. The only characters I might own are any minor rodent characters, like a squirrel or a ferret or something. Maybe even another guinea pig. Enjoy! Chapter 1: Morning at the Warehouse Darwin's POV… I was walking around one morning at our warehouse training site, feeling proud to have so many trainees. Several different kinds of rodents, including hamsters, ferrets, squirrels, chipmunks, mice, and other guinea pigs had joined since we defeated the mechanical monster created by Saberling (well, legally owned by Saberling anyways). That was when the team only consisted of me, Juarez, Blaster, and my supposed brother, Hurley. Hurley was actually becoming a better agent by the day. I was proud of him. Speckles hadn't been released from jail yet. He still had to disable a lot more Saberling mechanical menaces. Who knew appliances could be so evil? \"Morning, Darwin,\" my favorite gray guinea pig, Juarez greeted me as she passed me. \"Morning, Juarez,\" I responded. \"How are things?\" \"Busy. Who would've thought so many rodents would want to become secret agents?\" she asked rhetorically. Her exotic accent was really hot. Secretly, I was in love with her. I don't know how I managed to hide it the past few years. Her bright blue eyes were like the purest lakes. \"I sure didn't,\" I responded quickly, yet calmly. Huh. I guess that's how I managed to hide my feelings. She was just as good at hiding her feelings, and if not, she was better. She claimed to like either me or Blaster, but wouldn't reveal which one of us. At one point, Blaster assumed she liked neither of us. \"I wonder if Ben and Marcie did. The more the merrier, I guess,\" Juarez shrugged. \"That's probably what they thought,\" I smiled and assumed. \"Maybe,\" she said. \"I have to go teach a karate class. Let's talk later, okay?\" \"Sure,\" I nodded. I mentally cursed myself for not making the move when I had the chance. I loved her. Naturally, I kept these thoughts in my head, just as I always did. I couldn't think straight. Ugh, I was so frustrated with myself. I looked towards the area where Blaster was teaching. He was teaching some ferrets and chipmunks how to use a rifle, rodent sized, of course. Now that I think about it, the only rodent we didn't have with us was probably the capybara. Compared to the rest of us, those things are huge . Blaster was my friend, but whenever my feelings for Juarez were on the line, he was my rival. I had no idea what would happen if—heaven forbid—he'd offer to get the door for her. That'd be a fiasco, no doubt. Why was I so love struck? I wanted to be with Juarez. \"Darwin!\" I heard Marcie's voice from behind me. I turned around and looked up to see her. \"Hey, Marcie. What's up?\" I asked. \"Ben wants to see you,\" she reported to me. Ten minutes later, I was in Ben's office and the look on his face was grim. He asked, \"How are you this fine morning, Darwin?\" \"I'm doing well, but if this morning is so fine, why do you look so stressed? And don't sugarcoat it. You only have that look on your face when something is wrong,\" I asked. \"I'm glad you asked. I'll get right to the point. There's a new threat. They are cunning, ruthless, and dangerous.\" \"Who are they?\" \"They are an evil organization called the Vipers. So far, they have been laying low. But they have been active. Our top stealth chipmunks came and reported that they even have a base here in L.A. What's worse is that they operate with both humans and snakes.\" \"Snakes, huh?\" I asked in wonder. \"Interesting.\" \"We know little else about them. But they are undoubtedly a threat that cannot go unnoticed. While trying to steal government files, they suddenly sipped away as if their connection dropped dead right when they were caught red-handed.\" \"How do you know it wasn't some crazy guy in his basement?\" I asked. It was a reasonable question. You'd be surprised how often it happens. \"Because before they escaped, they left an insignia shaped like a snake head and left the word 'Vipers' underneath it,\" Ben explained. \"I thought S.I.P. wasn't with the government,\" I pointed out. \"It isn't, but they've been doing this to all the major countries in the world,\" Ben replied. \"It always ended the same way. Before about ten or twenty years ago, S.I.P. was short for 'Super International Police', so we feel obligated to answer the call. Because you are the leader of the G-Force, I felt you should be the first one told.\" \"What else do we know about the Vipers?\" I asked. \"Not much. We know that they have many different species of snake within their organization. This is one of their commanders,\" he stated and showed me a picture. It was a bald man with amber eyes. He wore a maroon ascot, had not facial hair, and I thought I saw fangs peeking out from underneath his upper lip. \"This is James Anaconda. One of the mice retrieved this photo. Mooch took the liberty of doing a few more head shots of him.\" \"He doesn't look friendly,\" I commented. \"He isn't. There's even a rumor going around that he was involved with the Kennedy assassination,\" Ben informed me, \"among other assassinations. Yet he's always legally untouched. They always seem to let him off the hook. He somehow makes it seem like he did nothing wrong, that he's a simple resident whose time was wasted in court. This is your mist dangerous foe yet, Darwin. I need you to understand that.\" \"I understand,\" I nodded confidently. I felt like I did. But how could the Vipers be defeated? Who were they capable of hurting? Ben had given me something to think about. Talking to Juarez always made me feel better about these kinds of things. I went to find her. Finally, she had finished her karate class. I went over to talk to her after she gave advice to a young squirrel. \"Hey, Juarez. You got a sec?\" \"Sure, Darwin. We did say we would talk later,\" Juarez pointed out. \"What's up?\" \"Well, I just finished talking to Ben. He told me we have a new threat to deal with, and it's more dangerous than anything we've ever faced.\" \"What? Who?\" \"Some organization called the Vipers. Ben said that some of our stealthiest chipmunks reported that they have a base somewhere in L.A.\" \"I remember those chipmunks. The poor things looked terribly injured.\" \"So, now, I have a lot on my mind,\" I finished. \"That's natural, given that you are the leader of the G-Force,\" she assured me. She gave me a smile, not a sly one, but a sympathetic one. I smiled back at her. Something about her, probably everything, made me feel better whenever I was feeling down. \"Thanks, Juarez,\" I thanked her for talking to me. \"Anytime, Darwin,\" she replied.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Checking My Feelings Juarez's POV… What Ben had told Darwin obviously disturbed him. I'm glad he came and talked to me, but for his sake isn't the only reason. Deep down, I was in love with him. I felt guilty for keeping him and Blaster guessing which one of them I really liked, but he never seemed to care. That's why I kept him guessing. If he's paranoid that I like Blaster more than him, it makes him want me more. Confusing, I know, but I think it worked. It certainly works on Blaster, but Darwin…he's different from Blaster. That's what I like about him. Ay, who am I kidding? I like everything about him. He's a strong and caring leader. Those are the best kind in my opinion. \"So, Juarez, assuming that I'm the one you really like, do you want to go out for a pellet some time?\" Blaster approached and asked, trying to be suave. \"Sorry, not interested,\" I didn't attempt to meet his eyes. Don't get me wrong. Blaster was a really nice guy, but I preferred Darwin. Simple as that. \"Oh, let me guess, you like Darwin now,\" Blaster guessed. I always did like Darwin, but verbally, I claimed Blaster at some times, and Darwin at others. I remained silent. Blaster then asked, \"Do you even like either of us?\" I continued to remain silent. This silly game of mine must have been frustrating to him, because he then told me, \"You know, I only aim to please, but if that's the way you want to be, then fine! But I am tired of your stupid little games, Juarez!\" I felt guilty, but I couldn't tell Blaster that I really did like Darwin. It was my deepest and darkest secret. I didn't just like Darwin. I was in love with him. I was about to apologize to Blaster, but he was already walking away. Later that night, I was in my room, listening to \"Enchanted\" by Taylor Swift on my stereo. This song described how I felt about Darwin. There I was again tonight Forcing laughter, faking smiles Same old tired lonely place Walls of insincerity, Shifting eyes and vacancy Vanished when I saw your face All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you Your eyes whispered, \"Have we met?\" Across the room your silhouette Starts to make its way to me The playful conversation starts Counter all your quick remarks Like passing notes in secrecy And it was enchanting to meet you All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you The lingering question kept me up 2 AM, who do you love? I wonder 'til I'm wide awake And now I'm pacing back and forth Wishing you were at my door I'd open up and you would say, \"Hey, It was enchanting to meet you, All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.\" This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home I'll spend forever wondering if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you This is me praying that This was the very first page Not where the story line ends My thoughts will echo your name Until I see you again These are the words I held back As I was leaving too soon I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love with someone else Please don't have somebody waiting on you Please don't be in love with someone else Please don't have somebody waiting on you This night is sparkling, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home I'll spend forever wondering if you knew This night is flawless, don't you let it go I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone I'll spend forever wondering if you knew I was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love with someone else Please don't have somebody waiting on you Just as the sing ended, there was a knock on my door. I hoped it was Darwin. I opened my door, but I was disappointed to find that Hurley was at my door. He meant well, but he wasn't Darwin, even if he was supposedly his brother. He greeted, \"Hi, Juarez. I couldn't help but overhear you playing your stereo. I didn't know you liked country music.\" \"Sometimes I do. Usually if it's by Taylor Swift,\" I answered casually. \"Sounds like she really likes the guy,\" Hurley commented. \"Who?\" \"Taylor. I know she writes songs based on her life.\" \"Yeah. She's steered country in the right direction. I'm usually more of a pop or rock girl, but I like her music.\" \"Do you think that her song describes you in any way?\" \"Me? Why?\" \"Just wondering. We all know you like either Darwin or Blaster, and you must really like him—or the other him.\" \"I do,\" I admitted. But I wasn't about to tell which one. Hurley was a sweet guy, but I don't think I could trust anyone with such a big secret. Could I? No, no, no, I couldn't. Not even Hurley. I couldn't bring myself to tell him. I stared at the floor. \"Is it Darwin?\" he asked. I suddenly looked up at him. \"No,\" I lied. \"I mean…maybe…\" \"Ooh, it is!\" Hurley got excited. \"Oh, fine! It is Darwin, but you must swear—on your life—not to tell anyone!\" I warned him. \"I swear!\" he crossed his heart. Luckily, he knew better than to break a promise with me. \"Good,\" I calmed down. There were a few seconds of silence, and then I said, \"Well, good night.\" \"Good night,\" he smiled. \"And don't worry; your secret is safe with me!\" I closed my door and smiled. Maybe I could trust Hurley with a huge secret like that. Hurley wasn't the best spy in the world (he's getting there, though), but he sure does have a way of making everyone feel positive and secure. Like Darwin, only not as handsome. I yawned, fell onto my bed, and went to sleep. I felt refreshed in the morning. When I peeked out from my room, I saw Blaster talking to Darwin. \"Did you sleep a wink last night?\" Blaster asked Darwin. \"Yeah, I slept just fine,\" Darwin answered him. \"I didn't! Juarez was blasting her stereo to a Taylor Swift song again!\" Blaster complained. \"But aren't you the one who's always playing console games involving some war every night. You game station is a lot louder than Juarez's stereo,\" Darwin pointed out. \"Okay, I guess you're right about that part,\" Blaster mumbled. \"And what about your little scary movie marathon last week? All of our youngest trainees were—\" \"Okay! I see your point! I'm just mad at Juarez. Aren't you tired of being like a game piece to her?\" Blaster demanded. \"Like a game piece?\" Darwin asked. \"Yeah, man, she's totally toying with us! It's either she likes me or she likes you. That's what she claimed. We're both just nice guys who only aim to please.\" \"So your saying this little love triangle that only exists in your head…\" \"Her head!\" \"…is a conspiracy?\" \"Yes! I think she's trying to turn us against each other for her own amusement!\" \"Of all the craziest things I've heard, that is by far the craziest,\" Darwin told him. I felt hurt that Blaster would assume those things about me, but happy that Darwin was defending me.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Love Struck Darwin's POV… So, Blaster thought Juarez was treating us like game pieces. I don't believe that. It just didn't seem like Juarez. She was intelligent, caring, and beautiful. I glanced over to her door and saw her peeking out. I looked back towards Blaster, who didn't seem to notice her. I said to him, \"We'll talk more about your craziness later.\" \"My craziness?\" Blaster asked. \"You know, Darwin, if you do like her, it is okay if you get mad at her. I know that, and you know that I know that.\" \"I really have to go talk to Ben,\" I lied. I didn't want to hear anymore about that topic Blaster shared with me. \"What's the rush?\" he asked. \"The new enemy!\" I blurted out. I suddenly realized that maybe I shouldn't have said that. \"New enemy?\" Blaster repeated. He seemed pleased. \"Finally! Now's my chance to kick butt as hard as I want!\" I sighed in relief. I thought he was going to run away, screaming at the trainees to run for their lives, like he did during his week long horror movie marathon. I said to him, \"Look, I don't want you to scare anyone, so can you please keep it a secret until I can find a way to tell the trainees?\" \"Sure, Darwin! And thanks for telling me that. I don't even remember why I was so mad before,\" Blaster chuckled. I smiled at him. He completely forgot he was angry with Juarez. He walked away, and Juarez emerged from her room. \"Thanks, Darwin,\" she thanked me. \"Anytime, Juarez,\" I smiled. Gosh, her big blue eyes were beautiful. She was the most gorgeous guinea pig on Earth. Her light gray fur looked so soft. The earring she had in one ear sparkled dimly compared to her smile. When I started to walk away, she walked beside me. I suddenly thought about how we could strategize against the Vipers. \"Should you have told Blaster about the Vipers?\" Juarez asked me. \"Probably not,\" I smiled and shook my head. \"You—you gave up classified information just to defend me?\" Juarez stuttered. She seemed almost speechless. \"That is the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me. Thank you, Darwin.\" \"Anytime of day, any day of the week, Juarez,\" I stated. She graciously beamed at me with those big, blue, beautiful eyes. My heart melted like butter in Blaster's secret stash of pyrotechnics. She had the bluest and most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. \"Darwin!\" Marcie ran up to me. \"Ben told me that he wants to tell the trainees about the Vipers.\" \"Okay,\" I nodded. \"Understood, Marcie.\" She nodded and walked away, probably to tell Ben that I obliged to his decision. I turned back to Juarez, who asked, \"Now where were we?\" \"Ah-ha!\" Blaster appeared and pointed at us. \"You do like Darwin!\" \"Blaster? What is wrong with you?!\" I demanded. \"You don't just jump out at your teammates like that!\" \"So you were okay with the fact that she was going to kiss you?\" he asked me. \"I wasn't going to kiss him!\" Juarez defended herself. She started swearing at him in Spanish. Tears formed in her eyes and she ran away. \"Juarez, wait!\" I begged and scurried after her. Behind me, I heard Blaster say, \"I think I screwed up.\" \"YOU THINK?\" I yelled behind me. I chased Juarez all the way up to her room. Once there, she locked the door and turned on her stereo to its maximum volume. It was a Taylor Swift song, and I somehow recognized it as \"Mine\": You were in college working part time waiting tables Left a small town, never looked back I was a flight risk with a fear of falling Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts I say can you believe it? As we're lying on the couch the moment I could see it Yes, yes, I can see it now do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Flash forward and we're taking on the world together And there's a drawer of my things at your place You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes But we got bills to pay We got nothing figured out When it was hard to take Yes, yes, this is what I thought about Do you remember we were sitting there by the water? You put your arm around me for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you remember all the city lights on the water? You saw me start to believe for the first time You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine And I remember that fight, 2:30 a.m. As everything was slipping right out of our hands I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street Braced myself for the goodbye 'Cause that's all I've ever known Then you took me by surprise You said I'll never leave you alone You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water And every time I look at you, it's like the first time I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter She is the best thing that's ever been mine Hold on, make it last Hold on, never turn back You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter You are the best thing that's ever been mine Do you believe it? We're gonna make it now I can see it I can see it now When the song ended, I was knocking on her door. She opened it and gasped, \"Darwin?\" \"Hi, Juarez,\" I greeted. \"I'm so sorry about what happened back there.\" \"It wasn't your fault. It was Blaster's. Ugh! I've just never been so embarrassed!\" she exclaimed. I took her paw and tried to soothe her. \"That was just Blaster being Blaster. He means well, but isn't always conscious of his actions. He didn't mean to do that, Juarez.\" \"Thank you, Darwin,\" she choked on her tears. \"Now I don't want to kill him as much.\" I chuckled at her comment and gave her a comforting hug. She then said, \"Promise me one thing, por favor .\" \"What is it?\" I asked. \"Promise me you'll never tell anyone you've seen me cry,\" she requested. \"I promise,\" I vowed. \" Gracias ,\" she thanked me. \" De nada ,\" I replied. I didn't know much Spanish, but I definitely knew \"you're welcome\". I'm not sure the lyrics to Taylor Swift's \"Mine\" came out the way I wanted. But I'll go with it. Please remember to review! :)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: My Stereo Explodes Juarez's POV… Darwin was being so sweet to me. Another thing I like about him is that he is always looking out for his teammates. I can't believe that I cried in front of him. I cried! That's something I don't usually do. But I couldn't help it. Never have I been so humiliated. I was about to invite Darwin in my room (he's the only one I would ever make the offer to. Anyone else would be killed if they entered my room) when Hurley showed up. He greeted, \"Hey, guys. Blaster had a question for you, but he thought you both would be too mad to answer him.\" \"He thought right,\" I said bitterly. \"What was the question?\" Darwin asked. \"He wanted to know if you've seen any of his handmade exploding listening devices,\" Hurley informed us. \"Exploding listening devices?\" Darwin echoed. \"Who would be stupid enough to make a listening device that explodes? Listening devices are supposed to be hidden,\" I commented. \"Hey! I helped!\" Hurley claimed. \"Well, we haven't seen any, Hurley,\" Darwin assured. \"Okay. I'll go tell Blaster,\" Hurley stated and walked away. \"Now, would you like to come in?\" I asked Darwin when Hurley was gone. \"You're actually letting me in your room?\" he asked. He looked confused, and he looked cute when he was confused. \"Yes, Darwin, I am. You're the only one I'd ever allow in here,\" I promised him. \"So, come on in.\" \"Okay. Thanks,\" he shrugged and graciously walked in. I hoped he couldn't here the rapidness of my wildly beating heart. \"Nice place you have here.\" \"Thank you,\" I said. Then, on top of my stereo, I spotted what I thought was a bug. I approached my stereo and saw that is was a bug, but not the creepy, crawly kind. It was a listening device. I then realized something. \"Blaster was in my room!\" \"What? How do you know, Juarez?\" Darwin asked me and ran over to where I was. \"I think I found a listening device,\" I told him. He eyed it. \"I wonder how he arms them, or how they're set off,\" he wondered. Suddenly, there was a rapid beeping. Darwin yelled, \"Hit the floor!\" We both dived down onto my floor when the listening device exploded. My stereo was in flames. Blaster and Hurley barged in with a fire extinguisher. They sprayed my stereo until the flames were gone. Then, Blaster said, \"I thought you hadn't seen any of my eaves-bombers!\" \"Eaves-bombers?\" Darwin repeated. \"THAT WAS BEFORE WE CAME INTO MY ROOM! YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE, BLASTER! GET OUT! NOW!\" I screamed at him. \"Whoa, whoa, Juarez, calm down!\" he tried to tell me. \"FIRST, YOU YELL AT ME ABOUT WHO I LIKE! THEN, YOU HUMILIATE ME! NOW, YOU WRECKED MY STEREO! GET OUT WHILE YOU STILL CAN!\" I yelled. He must've seen the intense anger in my eyes, because he seemed frightened and backed out the door. Hurley was obviously scared, because he ran out so fast he ran over Blaster. \"Maybe I should give you time to cool off,\" Darwin said. He left my room and closed the door behind him. I plopped on my bed and began to cry. What did Darwin see in me now? Did I just make a fool of myself? Or did I make a jerk of myself? If I had made a drama queen of myself, I was going to commit suicide. I wanted to turn on my stereo and drown out the sound of my cries, but it was nothing more than charred metal now. It made me hope that Blaster accidently blow up his game stations. I had an idea. The iPod that I had hooked up to the stereo was thankfully undamaged. I pulled out a pair of rodent sized ear-buds and grabbed the iPod. I plugged the ear-buds in and looked through my music. Before I could put on a song, I heard an explosion and I assumed that Blaster found another one of his eaves-bombers. It was kind of a shame. I couldn't help but wonder who or what got wasted. I put on a loud song to drown out anymore explosions. \"Another one of Blaster's tactic gone awry,\" I muttered. \"Juarez? Juarez, we'd like you to meet someone,\" I heard Darwin's voice say. I opened the door. I went over to the door, and then I opened it. Darwin was standing there, holding the paw of a small squirrel. She was just a child. \"This is Monica. We recently found out that the Vipers destroyed her nest.\" \"Oh, you poor thing,\" I knelt down so that I was at eye level with Monica. She seemed shy, but she had big dark eyes. She was a cute little thing. \"So, we're taking her under our wing,\" Darwin continued. I gave the little squirrel a hug. \"When was your nest destroyed?\" I asked her. \"L-l-last night,\" she stammered, holding back her tears. \"I'm the only one left in my family. My parents and siblings were eaten.\" \"Oh, you poor little thing. Don't worry. You'll be okay,\" I tried to soothe her. I suddenly knew that the Vipers were capable of great despair and I knew that they had to be stopped. \"The worst part is that one of their leaders, James Anaconda, was there. He cut the tree down, and he had a pack of snacks with him,\" Darwin informed me. I nodded, showing that I got the rest. Monica was lucky. It must've been by some miracle that she got away. Darwin then added, \"Marcie and Ben found her early this morning and fed her.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter 5: Anaconda's Secret Weapon Darwin's POV… So, there I was, introducing Monica to Juarez. Poor little Monica, an innocent squirrel, got her home destroyed by the Vipers. I decided to take Monica to meet her fellow trainees. Shoe could really use some friends at this point. Juarez decided to come along, too. Clearly, she felt bad for the poor little squirrel and seemed to forget that several minutes ago, her stereo was in flames. She also understood what it like to almost get eaten, so she must've felt a sort of kinship with Monica. As we walked down the hall, Juarez whispered to me, \"When Ben was briefing you, did he mention this James Anaconda?\" \"Yeah,\" I muttered back. \"The guy looks like some sort of demonic snake man.\" \"Oh, poor Monica,\" Juarez looked back to the little squirrel. \"I hope the trainees are nice to her. She needs friends right now. Something tells me she never had the chance to make any before her nest was destroyed.\" \"Darwin, Juarez, Ben wants to see you,\" Marcie came up from behind and told us. \"Okay, Marcie, but can you please do us a favor?\" I requested. \"Sure,\" she nodded. \"Can you please make sure little Monica makes some new friends?\" Juarez asked. \"Of course,\" Marcie smiled. So, we went to see Ben in his office and we met Blaster there. I noticed that Juarez was angrily glaring at him. She must've been mad about the fate of her stereo. Blaster looked like he was contemplating her angry glare, and then he said, \"I'm starting to believe in karma.\" Juarez started swearing under her breath in Spanish. Her beautiful blue eyes were fiery with anger towards Blaster. Ben appeared and greeted us. \"Gentlemen. Juarez. I have some disturbing news.\" He pulled up a holographic screen from his desk. \"James Anaconda appears to be re-mechanizing Saberling appliances. We know we can't suspect Speckles, because he's virtually cut off from the outside world. He must have some incredible technological mind to be installing weapons and command functions into coffee makers.\" \"And to think we had enough of nearly getting cooked, shredded, and electrocuted the last time,\" Juarez said flatly. \"How could Anaconda be doing this?\" Blaster asked. \"We're not sure. But we do believe that this is his secret weapon. According to the video Mooch took undercover, he calls it 'Saber Sense 2.0',\" Ben answered. \"He's having a meeting with an unsuspecting Leonard Saber tonight. Or, at least, we assume Saber knows nothing about this. He's not exactly our friend after what happened.\" \"Now I know English, Spanish, and a word of Chinese thanks to that incident,\" Juarez said. \"So, why is Anaconda meeting Saber tonight? What are they going to discuss?\" I asked. \"That's what you three and Mooch are going to find out,\" Ben told us. \"What's the plan?\" I asked. Ben informed us of his plan. The only lead we had was that Saber and Anaconda were supposedly going business together, which could make Saberling Industries a Viper puppet regime. Were we ready? Of course, we were. We're special agents and at the top of the S.I.P. rodent division. \"Yeah! G-Force!\" Blaster cheered. He turned around and walked away, eager for the mission. \"You don't even know the plan, Blaster!\" Juarez groaned in frustration. \"Actually it will be similar to last time, only without the extermination virus on Darwin's PDA…I hope,\" Ben explained. Later, during Saber's little announcement party, I was sneaking around, understanding the feeling of deja vu. But all I could really think about was Juarez's safety. I spoke into a communicator, \"Juarez, are you alright?\" \"I'm fine, Darwin. We're right on time, too,\" she reported. \"Oh, sure! Don't ask about me! After all, I am the third wheel!\" Blaster said sarcastically. \"Remember, this plan is altered from the last time. You'll both meet me inside and you will not kill each other before then,\" I ordered. \"Understood,\" both of them said to me. I used my blowtorch to cut through a thin metal panel in the roof. Once I finished cutting the hole in the panel, I leaped inside and started to look around. For this mission to work, I was counting on everyone as much as everyone was counting on me. According to the readout of Saber's mansion Ben had given me, the fuse box should've been behind me on the right side of the hall. Lights out. Juarez's POV… When we saw the lights in Saber's mansion go out, we knew that was our signal. We put on our night vision goggles (rodent sized of course) and climbed in through a window. For guinea pigs, we were quiet as mice as we scurried around hundreds of panicking people. Then, we saw Saber and Anaconda. Both were wearing those flashlight helmets that miners usually wear. Saber announced, \"Sorry for the power outage. I have no idea what went wrong, because I just checked the fuse box this morning. But anyways, I'd like to introduce Mr. James Anaconda, my new business partner. He's just as skilled as my last business partner, and if not, he's better than that mole that tried to wipe out humanity.\" I had mixed feelings of anger towards many right then and there. I was angry with Saber for saying those things about Speckles, Speckles for betraying our trust, and Blaster for yelling at me, humiliating me, and wrecking my stereo. I said to Blaster, \"Come on. Let's go. We're running behind.\" \"Right behind you, princess,\" he said to me. He knew I hated when I was called that. What about when I was dressed up like one at the house of the little girl, Penny? Oh, that was torture. It better have been considered animal abuse, because I would like to file a report. So, we scurried up several stairs, ran up a few halls, down a few more halls, passed through some rooms, and I ran into Darwin (literally). Sparks flew (not literally). I suddenly realized that our lips had made contact. We…kissed. I kissed Darwin! It was a dream come true! I wanted more! My lips craved his! So, I pulled him to me and we kissed more and more. Finally, we both jumped back when Ben called in to check on us. \"Guys, are you alright? You three have been standing there for a minute and a half. It's a god thing you were all ahead of schedule when this mission started.\" \"Uh, we're fine. I just happened to witness guinea pig love,\" Blaster reported. I was suddenly fuming at him. I swatted the back of his head with my paw and continued onward after Darwin, who already went on ahead. \"So, uh…\" I was flustered. How unlike me. I was blushing underneath my fur. That was very unlike me. \"Did you…happen to…like that?\" \"What Blaster just said?\" he asked. \"No, no, no, before that.\" \"Oh. Uh…well, as it would turn out, I did enjoy it.\" \"You did?\" I asked. I was suddenly frustrated with myself for seeming so eager when I asked that. If I had a tail, it would certainly be wagging right then and there. \"Uh-huh,\" Darwin nodded. I felt my heart dance with delight. \"Would you ever want to do it again? You know, kiss?\" I asked. \"Hmm…well, uh…yes, as a matter of fact,\" he said to me. He also seemed flustered. Suddenly, I tripped and fell on my face. Now, that was most unlike me. Darwin gasped and helped me to my feet. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yes. I'm fine…now,\" I assured him. \"Good. Because we have a mission to finish.\" Finally, we made it to the room Saber's computer was in. Blaster turned it on (the computer and lights were on two different fuses. Leonard Saber was a strange man) and we hacked into his email. We found a long list of emails, and a lot of them were from James Anaconda. I kind of felt sorry for Saber. It seemed like his appliance franchise was always being used for evil, and right under his nose. Darwin, still looking at the computer, said, \"The name of the file isn't Cluster Storm this time. It's Long Fang. And it's right over….here!\" Darwin and jacked in his PDA and the file was being transferred. We were only 20% done with the transfer when we heard footsteps. We had to switch to wireless download. We ran over to the fireplace. Saber came into the room. The lights came back on. I could hear my heart pounding. Darwin held my paw in reassurance. For some reason I couldn't explain, I snuggled up against him. \"Oh, great. Why don't you two just do it already?\" Blaster rasped at us. The PDA beeped. The transfer was complete. Darwin wrapped an arm around me and fired a grappling hook out the chimney. With Blaster in hot pursuit, we escaped the mansion. After sneaking underneath the fence, we took an underground tunnel back to the warehouse. \"How'd it go?\" Marcie asked when we got back. \"It was amazing,\" I swooned. Darwin still had his arm wrapped around my shoulder. He handed her the PDA and we went into my room. \"Don't stay in there too long, or else I'm the godfather,\" Blaster chuckled. I barely paid attention to him. So, Darwin and I started talking and we were having a very good time. There was a knock on my door. I opened it to find Hurley. He gave me a thumbs-up and walked away. At first, I was skeptical, but then I smiled. Too bad my stereo was fried, because I was enchanted to have met Darwin, and now we were talking in my room. We shared one more kiss before we called it a night and he went up to his room.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: The Results Darwin's POV… The next day, we were finally getting the results of our mission last night. Ben was about to analyze my PDA when he sent Marcie to get us. Ben jacked in the PDA and selected the 'Long Fang' file. \"Here goes,\" he said. He, Marcie, and us guinea pigs watched the screen. I looked with wide eyes at what I saw. I saw…everything. First, we saw a layout of Leonard Saber's mansion with an interesting line up of snake themed booby traps. Then, we saw nuclear doomsday microwaves. Juarez and I were so nervous it took us a few seconds to realize that we had been holding paws. Lastly, a video played. It was James Anaconda, saying, \"Hope you like what you saw, S.I.P., because there's no stopping it. No one can stop my plans, especially not a band of brats and rodents. You've lost this war before it has begun.\" \"Oh, no,\" I moaned. \"It can't be true. We can stop him. We have to,\" Juarez said desperately. \"How are we going to take all of that down, Juarez?! He has like 84 different doomsday plans!\" Blaster snapped at her. \"Knock it off, Blaster!\" I snapped at him. \"We'll find a way. I have total faith in us all. It isn't just the three of us anymore.\" \"Darwin's right,\" Juarez said, though her breath was shaky. \"I have faith in our trainees.\" We left Ben's office and Monica was waiting outside for them, hoping for good news. Juarez just sighed and gave the young squirrel a hug, mumbling soothing Spanish words. I found it amazing how many things can end up on one's mind in a matter of minutes. One moment, I was hoping I downloaded the right file and that my PDA wouldn't be infected. The next moment, I was looking at the biggest montage of schemes and defense mechanisms known to man and rodent. But we had to save the world. There was a psychotic madman who had to be stopped. \"We have to stand up to this.\" \"What?\" Blaster and Juarez looked at me like I was crazy. \"We can't let this happen. These are just plans. They haven't been put into action. We still have plenty of time to stop these. We can do that by locking Anaconda away. We can sneak into Saber's mansion and delete the files! There's a lot that can and will be done! We can't give up. We're the best agents in the rodent division,\" I stated. I tried to motivate them any way I could. It seemed to work. Juarez smiled at me (her smile was gorgeous) and Blaster let a pellet hang out of his mouth. \"Are we going to fight back?\" Monica let go of Juarez and asked. \"Are you in?\" I asked her. I smiled at her, and she gave me a small grin back. \"Good. Ben told me that he'll inform the rest of the trainees about what's going on. I'll go tell him that we're taking a stand.\" Juarez's POV… That was another great thing about Darwin. He didn't give up easily, and he didn't let us give up either. Now can you see why I was so enchanted to be with him? He knew what was important, and no matter how big it was, he never backed down. When I was alone, I swooned and twirled around once. He got me excited for this fight against the Vipers. I spun around and saw Darwin behind me. I yelped and jumped back. He apologized, \"Sorry I scared you.\" \"No, no, it's fine,\" I quickly said. \"I think I can fix your stereo. I just wanted your permission first,\" he said to me. \"You can?\" I asked in disbelief. He nodded. Hearing that made me happy. I smiled and thanked him, \" Gracias , Darwin.\" \"You're welcome, Juarez,\" he replied. He had somehow managed to replaced all of the unusable parts, and with a bit of elbow grease, my stereo was good as new. \"Want to test it out?\" \"Is it ready?\" I asked. \"Yep,\" he nodded. I hooked up my iPod to the stereo and played one of my favorite songs, \"Enchanted\" by Taylor Swift. When I heard the rich, clear sound, I wrapped my arms around Darwin. \"Thank you so much, Darwin,\" I thanked him. \"You're welcome. I'm glad I could fix what Blaster broke, or blew up in this case,\" he returned the hug and said to me. We listened to the song together. There I was again tonightForcing laughter, faking smilesSame old tired lonely place Walls of insincerity,Shifting eyes and vacancyVanished when I saw your face All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you Your eyes whispered, \"Have we met?\"Across the room your silhouetteStarts to make its way to meThe playful conversation startsCounter all your quick remarksLike passing notes in secrecy And it was enchanting to meet youAll I can say is I was enchanted to meet you This night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet you The lingering question kept me up2 AM, who do you love?I wonder 'til I'm wide awakeAnd now I'm pacing back and forthWishing you were at my doorI'd open up and you would say, \"Hey,It was enchanting to meet you,All I know is I was enchanted to meet you.\" This night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet you This is me praying thatThis was the very first pageNot where the story line endsMy thoughts will echo your nameUntil I see you againThese are the words I held backAs I was leaving too soonI was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on youPlease don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on you This night is sparkling, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way homeI'll spend forever wondering if you knewThis night is flawless, don't you let it goI'm wonderstruck, dancing around all aloneI'll spend forever wondering if you knewI was enchanted to meet you Please don't be in love with someone elsePlease don't have somebody waiting on you[Chapter 7] Sorry for the long wait. I have a few other stories that are also in progress and it is now becoming hard to juggle. But I can manage. I have managed so far. Chapter 7: Stranded With Her Darwin's POV… We were assigned another mission. This time, we were bringing Hurley along. This time, we were tracking Anaconda's car (it was a good thing Blaster memorized his license plate number). We'd search Anaconda's mansion for any kind of lead we could get, and surely there must have been a lot of leads. We loaded ourselves into the Rapid Deployment Vehicle (which I dubbed RDV). Juarez got into her pinkish red gyroscopic hamster ball, Blaster got into his blue one, and Hurley and I were riding in my grayish black one. The plan was that we'd ride our three units down three different routes so we'd enter Anaconda's property from all sides. Hurley and I would come in from the north, Juarez from the east, and Blaster from the south. I asked, \"Is everyone ready?\" \"Always,\" Juarez answered slyly (and hotly) from her RDV unit. \"Yeah!\" Blaster cheered from his RDV unit. \"Did I remember my camera…?\" Hurley tried to remember from behind me. \"Ugh! Hurley, we are not going sight-seeing!\" I groaned and told him firmly. Juarez, Blaster, and I put the pedal to the metal (or plastic, or whatever our vehicles are made out of) and raced out of the warehouse in three separate directions. Trouble began to brew when we were within a mile of Anaconda's mansion. Human men with sunglasses, dark suits, and motorcycles with snake images on them raced out of the alleys. Each of us was being followed by five or six of them. \"Evasive maneuvers!\" \"Right!\" Juarez and Blaster replied through the comm. link system. I steered Hurley and I into and alley, along a brick wall, and over a fence onto another street. According to my radar, Blaster had performed a U-turn to disorient his chasers. Juarez seemed to have been having trouble losing her pursuers. \"What's wrong, Juarez?\" I asked, concerned for her safety. \"I-I don't know! I can't shake them!\" she reported, a hint of panic in her voice. Her blip on my radar, as I zoomed in, was swerving, indicating her desperate attempts to lose her pursuers. But the enemy blips swerved with hers, meaning the pursuers were copying her movements as they got closer to her. Then, I heard Juarez scream, \"Oh, no!\" and then all I heard was static. Her blip on my radar was flickering. Her RDV unit was badly damaged. I totally forgot about the mission. I just veered down the street and took several turns to get to her. Finally, we were on the street Juarez was on last. I got out of my RDV unit and rushed over to hers. There was a huge crack in it. Sparks were shooting everywhere. My favorite gray guinea pig was unconscious. I forced the unit door open and pulled her out. \"Come one, Juarez. Speak to me.\" \"Dar…Darwin?\" she slurred as she awoke. I held her in my arms. There was a cut on her lower lip. There was another one just above one of her crystal blue eyes. \"That's right, Juarez. I'm here. You got knocked around pretty hard, huh?\" I said soothingly as I stroked her fur. \"Yeah…\" she nodded. \"My foot got tangled on my controls at one point and I think it is broken.\" \"Whoa, J, your RDV got mutilated!\" Blaster exclaimed as he pulled up next to us. I shot him a cold glare, and he shut up immediately. \"Uh, guys, is it the 4th of July?\" Hurley asked from my RDV as he looked up at the sky. I squinted upwards and saw…missiles. Small ones, but they were still destructive. \"Oh, crud! Hurley, shut the door!\" I ordered. He shut the door to my RDV. I picked up Juarez and started running. The missiles hit the road and exploded. I shielded her with my body. We were caught in the blast and everything was a blur. I think we were sent flying, but I was too dazed to tell. I blacked out. When I came to, Juarez was sitting by me, watching me with worried eyes. I moaned, \"Ugh. Juarez, are you alright?\" \"I am, thanks to you,\" she nodded. She kissed my nose, and then I sat upward and looked at our surroundings. With a road at our one side, a house at our other side, and a tree in front of us as well as behind us, I would say that we landed in another neighborhood. She tried to stand, but she winced in pain and sat back down. Actually, it was more like she fell. \"Here, let me carry you,\" I offered and got up. I picked her up and asked, \"Are there any objections?\" She simply shook her head, and then laid her head on my shoulder. \"Where are we going?\" she asked softly. \"With luck, towards progress,\" I answered. I looked for somewhere where we could take shelter. Anywhere ground level would be best, given the condition of Juarez's foot. Finally, after walking several blocks, I decided to take Juarez under a bush and we would sleep there. She had no objections given the fact that she was completely worn out. \"Good night, Juarez.\" \"Good night, Darwin,\" she replied. We both drifted off in each others arms. I know this one was kind of short, but I hope you enjoyed it anyways. I will try to make the chapters longer, but that may be easier said than done. Anyways, thanks again and please review.[Chapter 8] Sorry about taking so long to update. This is the last chapter of the story, so I hope you like it. I know it may seem kind of rushed, and sometimes my works get to be too quick, but you have to admit, this is one of the longest G-Force stories out there. Thank you for reading. Chapter 8: Finishing the Job Juarez's POV… I woke up to find Darwin still sleeping. I was the one with the injury, yet he was more exhausted. Huh. I don't blame him. I tried to stand on my hind legs, but that was no good. I sharply inhaled out of pain. Pain. That horrid feeling surged throughout my right foot. It felt awful. My head still spun from getting knocked around so hard the day before. I wanted to cry, but I hated crying. I already let it happen once. No. Not again. I just sighed and sat there, waiting for Darwin to wake up. My stomach lurched. I peeked out the bush we sheltered ourselves in and saw it was twilight. Ugh! I felt so sick and sore. I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not. No matter how hard I tried. I noticed Darwin stir in his sleep. He greeted me, \"Morning, Juarez.\" \"More or less,\" I shrugged. I explained to him the twilight. He simply replied that morning would come around shortly anyway. He had a point. He always had a point. It was admirable. But it didn't ease the pain in my head. \"Ay!\" \"What?\" Darwin asked, showing concern. \"Nothing serious. Just a horrid headache,\" I reassured. I held my head with one paw and then noticed something was different. \"Where is my earring?\" \"It must have fallen out,\" Darwin hypothesized. I sighed, too sore to worry about it. He then said to me, \"We can find you a new one later. We have a job to do now. Marred or not, we have to stop Anaconda. That was the mission. You know how I always see a mission through.\" \"I do,\" I nodded. Another one of the admirable things about him. Another thing to go on the endless list. He stood up and I crawled over to him. \"Let's do this.\" \"Do you want me to carry you?\" he looked down at me and asked. I shook my head. Then, he offered, \"Piggyback?\" Eh. Piggyback seemed like the better option. I'd be less of a nuisance. I climbed onto his back and wrapped my arms around his neck. All he needed was a little rest, because he bolted out from underneath that bush like a rocket. \"Don't let go,\" he would say to me occasionally. \"Trust me, I never planned on it,\" I claimed tiredly. My eye lids felt heavy, but I had to stay awake. Darwin just ran and ran. Eventually, we reached Anaconda's mansion. Darwin crawled underneath the fence, and then pulled me in. \"This is the place?\" \"Yep,\" Darwin nodded. He dragged me into a gutter pipe where we could hide. \"I don't know where Blaster and Hurley are, or the other rodents, but we have to finish this mission. I'll go in. You stay here and—\" \"Oh, no. You didn't carry me who knows how many blocks just to leave me in a gutter! I am going with you!\" I insisted. I wanted to be in on the action, and even more so…I wanted to be with him. \"Okay,\" Darwin sighed and gave up, knowing I wouldn't. \"How will you be able to get around?\" I pulled out my grappling hook and showed it to them. He smiled at my cleverness, or maybe he thought it was cute that I came up with the idea. Either way, it didn't matter now. \"Let's roll.\" And so, we used the gutter to climb, and then swung into the mansion via a conveniently opened window. Darwin landed on his feet when he went in, and I came tumbling after. He got down real low and moved stealthily, and I tried to follow him the best I could. Then, I spotted it. I spotted an air vent. I whispered, \"Darwin.\" He turned to me, and I pointed to the vent. He smiled at me and used his grappling hook to climb up the wall. He unscrewed the grating over the vent and went in. I used my grappling hook and went up after him. Once again, he walked; I crawled. Every now and then, he'd place some kind of device on the vent wall. \"What are those?\" \"Blaster's explosives,\" he answered. \"And I have plenty of them.\" Rather than answering, I clutched my stomach, feeling it lurch again. Maybe I was just hungry. No. That wasn't it. Everything was still spinning. I was falling, but I placed my paws on the wall of the vent just in time to catch myself. I must have been exhausted. Darwin looked at me with concerned eyes. I just nodded reassuringly and limped along the metal vent wall. It made me feel more useful than crawling. He offered to carry me, and I refused. We exited the vent and fell into a room. Darwin left behind a few explosives, and we moved onward. I was still leaning on the wall as I limped. Crawling made me feel so helpless. We got to a huge room filled with computers. Darwin did the predictable, set bombs all over. I found this understandable. It was the best way to get rid of Anaconda's doomsday plans. Then, my vision went blurry. I could feel myself falling, but something caught me. \"Easy, Juarez,\" I heard Darwin's voice. I was just so dizzy. Why did I keep having these dizzy spells? Then, I realized that I must have been suffering some kind of trauma. Because every time I had a dizzy spell, it felt like I was in my RDV when I was attacked. The spinning…I remember that the gyroscopic functions of my RDV…yes! When they cracked my RDV, it caused some sort of movement malfunction. I crashed into one of their wheels and blacked out. I remembered. I remembered that when I woke up, Darwin was there. I guess my mind just hasn't recovered from it. Either that or I was completely delirious. I was betting on delirious. I heard Darwin say, \"You don't look well. Maybe we should stop and rest.\" \"Only after we get out of here,\" I urge him. I smiled. When everything came into focus, I assured him, \"I'm fine.\" \"You're getting a piggyback ride,\" he smiled at me. He turned around, bent over, and said, \"Climb on.\" And so I did. It felt good; having my gray fur brush on his reddish orange fur. We began to make our escape when Darwin stopped. \"Juarez, whatever you do, don't let go.\" \"Why?\" I asked. Then, I saw several snakes encircle us. They hissed at us. Fear and anger welled up in my body. How did they know we were here? I must have given us away. I mentally cursed myself. \"Juarez, hold on tight. I have an incredibly stupid idea,\" I heard Darwin mutter to me. He held up a small device, a detonator. He swiftly pressed the single button on the detonator, and several explosions went off. The shockwave of one explosion was so powerful it hurled me off of Darwin's back. I passed out. When I came to, I was surrounded by a pile of ash and dead snakes. My fur was singed. I looked in all directions, but I couldn't find Darwin anywhere. I felt like crying. I would have, too, if I didn't see something move out the corner of my eye. Something emerged from the ashes. It was…Darwin. I crawled over to him and hugged his furry, singed body. He chuckled, \"Miss me already?\" \"I am so glad you're alive!\" I wept with joy. He stroked my fur, and then waved a gold object in front of my face. \"My earring! You found it?\" \"Yep,\" he nodded. I put the earring in my ear. \"Thanks.\" \"No problem, Juarez.\" \"Whoa! What happened here?!\" we heard a voice call out. Blaster's voice. He raced his RDV over to where we were. \"There was an explosion without me? You blew the place up without me?!\" At hearing this, Darwin and I burst into laughter. I wasn't exactly sure why, but I decided not to question it, but to enjoy it. I tried to stand, but winced in pain and fell over. Darwin helped me up and told me to lean on him. \"How did we survive, Darwin?\" I asked him. \"Well, right when the snakes lunged at us, I ducked and used them as a shield. Some went after you, too, therefore shielding your body,\" he explained. It was crazy, yet logical. We went back to the warehouse and gave Ben and Marcie a full report. I received a big hug from the little squirrel, Monica, upon returning. She was a sweet squirrel. When we got to my room, Darwin and I sat down on my bed and gazed into each other's eyes. We kissed and held it for as long as we could. That night was sparkling, and I wouldn't let it go. I was wonderstruck. I even blushed under my fur. I would spend forever in Darwin's arms if I could. I didn't have to wonder. He knew that I was enchanted to meet him. He was mine, and I was his. Once again, thank you all for reading this. ","Summary":" I do not own G-Force. What more needs to be said? I do own the concept of the agency they are in th"},{"Movie":"Season of the Witch","Title":"Another Witch?","Author":"edgeofthecraze","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7044802","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Another Witch? Chapter One: \"The Accused Will Suffer\" Note: There are some French words and sentences. If you don't know French, go to the bottom and there will be translations. \"There's the witch!\" one of the guards called to his fellow counterparts. I know he meant me. How? Because I was the one running from them in the first place. I haven't a clue why or how they would believe me to be a witch, but I wasn't planning on sticking around here long enough to find out. I ran though crowds of people, hoping to find a place to hide. \" Arrêt ! \" another guard yelled my way. No thanks! Did he really expect me to give up? I kept my eyes forward, and I saw the gaped hole surrounded by stone that led out of Avignon. My way out. I started to push people out of my way and headed toward the opening. I was nearly there, but then I felt a hard yank on my arm. I gave a quick pained cry from the firm pressure of a strong hand that caught a hold of me. I struggled to get free, but seeing as the hand stayed secure, I stopped fighting. I looked up at the guard that had me restrained. I looked at him angrily. \" Désormais vous n'échapperez pas . \" he said, grinning. If he hadn't had a grip on me, I would've knocked that look right off his face. The two other guards that were chasing me soon met up with us. Damn them… I thought to myself. The one who held my arm started pulling me. I followed obediently. I was taken to the town square, where a priest named Debelzeq, whom I hardly knew, stood before me. People were on all sides of us, whispering, which soon led to shouting. \"Silence!\" Debelzeq raised his voice to the crowd, motioning with his hand for everyone to be quiet. \"Elaina van Midi, you have been accused of witchcraft.\" he said in a stern voice. This caused the crowds to become wild again. \"Silence!\" he shouted again and the crowd became quiet. \"We have been informed by a certain someone that you have been reciting rituals of the black man. Do you have anything to say on your part?\" I stared at Debelzeq with anger in my eyes. \" Vous êtes tous des imbéciles. \" I spat. He slapped me across the face and I fell backwards. \"Do not forget your place, girl!\" he told me. I got back on my feet and glared at him, hoping it would turn him to ice. But it didn't. \"Who turned me in?\" I asked. \"That is of no concern.\" he answered. Of no concern? I want to know who turned me in, you I can destroy them later! \"So, you deny the crime of which you've been accused of?\" he continued. \"I've done nothing wrong.\" I growled. Debelzeq narrowed his eyes. \"You've been found guilty.\" he declared, and the people around shouted insults at me. I ground my teeth and stepped forward, trying to strike him. But the guard that held my chains pulled me backward. \"By the Church's order, you will be burned at the stake for your crime in two days.\" With that, he walked off. The guard pulled on my chains, forcing me to follow him. I could still hear the crowds shouting, calling names. The priest took me to a dungeon at the bottom of the Church. It was dark except for the few torches that lit the chamber. From what I could see, I counted six jail cells. The guard opened the first cell on the left and pushed me inside. I couldn't shield my head from the fall because my wrists were still chained. My head throbbed as I sat up to look around, though there wasn't anything to look at. The guard locked me in the cell and stood elsewhere, away from my view. I remembered all the townspeople looking at me at the square, glaring, hateful eyes that stung me as if they had been needles. Not one person had looked concerned or called out to Debelzeq on my behalf. That's because I didn't have any family or friends. Seul e . I was alone. I had never known my mother or father; they died when I was a baby. Obviously, I grew up on the streets as an orphan. And none of the children were allowed to talk or play with me because I was considered \"impure\". A tear escaped my eye. I quickly wiped it away. Now here I sat, about to be killed, with nothing to lose or to gain. I decided that I no longer cared if I lived or died, and I awaited my death sentence in peaceful silence. END OF CHAPTER ONE Here are the French translations from the story: \"Arrêt!\" means Stop! or Halt! \"Désormais vous n'échapperez pas.\" means You cannot escape now. \"Vous êtes tous des imbéciles.\" was a witty thing my friend came up for me, it means You are all idiots. Seul e means alone. So sad. One last thing, Elaina's last name \"Midi\" means \"midday\" or \"noon\" in French. Please Read & Review![Chapter 2] Another Witch? Chapter Two: \"La Sorcière Noire\" Note: Again, there are things in French. So, if you don't know French, look to the bottom of the page and there will be translations. And beware of abuse in this chapter! Hours later I had fallen asleep. I had no dreams, just blackness. Just like my heart, nothing but black. I heard noise from somewhere. I opened my tired eyes and looked about my cell. But the noises weren't coming from my cell; they were coming from the cell straight across. I crawled over to the steel bars of my prison and watched the scene that was playing in front of me. Debelzeq and a guard were standing over another girl, who was fearfully huddled in a ball. The guard had a knout in his fist. He was beating the girl. \"So you're the witch who brought the plague to the land. La Sorcière Noire. \" Debelzeq asserted. The girl nodded nervously, and the guard lashed her back. I shook at the sound of the knout hitting the girl's skin. I opened my mouth, wanting to speak up, to stop them from hurting her anymore. But nothing came out. I clutched the cold bars and stared at them in horror. \"You will be taken to Severac tomorrow at midday.\" Debelzeq stated and left the cell, the guard following after him. Debelzeq looked over at my fear-torn face. He said nothing, but I knew he was satisfied with what he did to the girl, his detestable expression told me so. He and the guard left the dungeon. My eyes locked on the girl, who was facing the other way. Her back was bloody from the whip marks. Her sobbing made my heart ache. I waited a moment to make sure no one else was coming in, and then spoke out to the girl, quietly: \" Est-que vous va bien? \" She got on her knees to find out where my voice came from, and then looked at me. She stared at me with sorrow and fear. I repeated myself. She seemed too pained to find the words to answer me. I felt pity for her. She crawled over to the bars of her cell, slowly, moaning in pain. I bit my lip hard to try and hold back the tears that were in my eyes. \"Why do you ask?\" she asked me when she got her breath under control. \"Because they hurt you.\" I answered. \"Do you…\" she stopped, and looked at the ground, as if wondering what to say, \"Do you believe I am a witch?\" \" Non !\" I exclaimed, \"Of course not!\" The girl sighed, not in relief, but in anguish. \"That's a first.\" she whispered only loud enough so I could barely hear her. I had questions to ask her, but I wasn't sure if it was appropriate. I didn't want her to be even more upset by questioning her too much. But I risked one: \"Why does the priest believe you brought up the plague?\" She told me the story: the plague arose at her village, Louresse. Her parents and two brothers were killed dry by the disease. She, not wanted to die as they did, left her village in search for another home. And, because misery loves company, the plague followed her to every town she went. Coïncidence? Probably. We heard the large door creak open. \"Pretend to be asleep!\" I whispered to the girl. I lay down and pretended to be asleep. I snuck a look at two armor-clad guards, one who had a knout in his fist, the other had a rope and a knife. They opened the girl's cell. The one with the rope tied her arms behind her back. I turned around, unable to stomach what I knew they were about to do. There was a thin whisper from one of the guards. I heard the girl plead \"no\" many times. There was a loud \"CRACK!\" from the knout lashing the girl. She was screaming in agony. I clamped my eyes shut. My whole body was quaking in fear, for the girl as well as myself. I was afraid they were going to beat me, too. Her assault continued for hours, and her screams got louder. Then, just as abruptly as they started, her screams ceased. What happened? Did they kill her? But I didn't dare move my body to check. The guards locked the cell, so I assumed they were done with her. I heard the big door shut again and turned around tout de suite. I nearly jumped to the cell bars to see what had become of the girl. When I saw that one guard had stayed watch, I stopped. I studied him for a moment; he didn't even look my way. Then my focus centered on the girl. She was positioned on her side, with her back to me, crying softly. I was relieved that she wasn't dead, but her crying didn't make that last long. END OF CHAPTER TWO French translations: La Sorcière Noire was the title of the chapter and also a reference in the story, it means \"The Black Witch\" Est-que vous va bien? means Are you all right? Non! as you can guess, means No! Still, it doesn't hurt to put the translation up... Read & Review please![Chapter 3] Another Witch? Chapter Three: \"Departure\" Note: French translations at bottom. I really wanted to ask the girl if she was all right. But the guard standing at the side prevented me from saying a word. My body was still very tired. I lie back down on the cold floor and, against my better judgment, fell to sleep. I had a dream. I am alone in a desert, walking. There is nothing around me but the cracked dirt beneath, and some rocky hills beside. Suddenly, I see a silhouette figure at a distance, and I'm wondering who it may be. The figure seems to be lying down on the ground, as if dying. I walk faster and the figure gets closer. When the person is in view, I am shocked. It is the girl, on the ground, her body turned to the side, bleeding. I try to call to her, but no sound is coming. When I walk nearer, I am pushed back by an unseen force; I cannot get to her. I feel a pain in my chest, my heart, because I cannot reach the girl, who is dying by the second. Then she looks my way. Again I try to scream to her, but again nothing. She looks over at me. She is about to say something, when… \"CLANG! CLANK!\" The sound of steel doors rattling awakened me. I shot up, gasping and panting. It took me a minute to remember who and where I was- a prisoner in a dungeon. I rubbed my eyes and groaned from the horror I had felt during the dream. I looked over at the girl's cage to see what all the racket was. Inside her prison was Debelzeq and two men, one a slim figure with mid-length dirty-blonde hair, the other more muscular with almost pure white hair. They struck me as knights from their dress attire. I looked at the girl, who was still wounded, and asleep. \" Pourquoi est qu'elle blessée? \" asked the blonde haired knight. \"She was resisting when we tried to sedate her.\" Debelzeq lied. I scowled. Debelzeq unlocked the girl's chains. She woke up instantly, looked at the priest, and back away from him in fear. \"She's afraid of you.\" the white haired knight pointed out. Debelzeq didn't offer a response. He grabbed the girl by her arms. She vainly tried to pull away from him, voicing small pitiful cries. Her cries seemed to call for help. Debelzeq and the knights began pulling her out of her cell. As they got her into the hallway, she looked at me with pleading eyes. I spoke up: \"Wait!\" they stopped and looked my way. \"Take me with you.\" I said. \"Why would we take you?\" asked the white haired man. Great. I'm horrible at making excuses. I shrugged. \"You can kill two birds with one stone. Or, in this case, two witches.\" I felt like laughing at my own remark, but managed to keep my composure. The three looked at each other and talked amongst themselves. \"And she'll be calmer if I'm with her. She'll be less of a bother.\" I added. Debelzeq put his head down. There was a moment of silence. Then he looked at me and unlocked my cell. \" Tu ferais mieux tenir son silencieux. \" he ordered, unlocking my chains. \" Mais oui. \"I replied. For the next few hours the girl and I sat in a wooden cage with steel bars lining the sides. I was bored just sitting there, waiting to leave for the faraway abbey Severac. I decided to take the opportunity of talking to the girl alone. \"So,\" I started, \"what's your name?\" \"Anna De Verger.\" she murmured. I smiled. \"What a beautiful name.\" I commented. She turned her face down, embarrassed. I laughed and put my arm around her, \"There's nothing to be embarrassed about!\" She laughed a little and then fell silent again. Boy, she's shy. \"By the way,\" I continued, \"My name's Elaina van Midi.\" \"Elaina.\" Anna repeated. She glanced up at me. We sat there for what seemed like hours, just staring at each other. I felt my face go red, as I realized more and more about how beautiful she was. She put her head on my chest and sighed. When the two knights, whom were called by Beheman and Felson, and Debelzeq finally came round, they had with them another man, who didn't look like much. His name was Hagamar, and he apparently was the guide to our trip to the temple. The man looked at Anna and I, his eyes glued to our bodies. The leech. I gave him a quick glare and he went away from us. At last! We're leaving! I wanted to hurry up and get to Severac. But then I remembered why we were going there in the first place, to deliver us to our deaths. My body shivered at the thought. But I definitely wasn't as scared as Anna was. She was the one accused of bringing the plague. I stroked her hair, calming her, and she sighed deeply. END OF CHAPTER THREE French translations: \"Pourquoi est qu'elle blessée?\" means Why is she wounded? When Debelzeq says \"Tu ferais mieux tenir son silencieux.\" he is threatening You better keep her quiet. and Elaina replies \"Mais oui.\" which means Of course. And just a last note, Anna's last name \"De Verger\" means orchard.[Chapter 4] Another Witch? Chapter Four: \"Her Protection\" Warning! This chapter has some yuri/shoujo-ai (which means girlxgirl)! Don't like it? Don't read it. The first night of the voyage, Beheman came by Anna and I. He gave us a blanket and some bread. I shot him a look. \"Why do you bother?\" I asked. He looked serious. \"You need to stay alive.\" Of course. He didn't care about us. He just couldn't let us die on the way to Severac. He circled the cage. \"What are you doing?\" I demanded. \"Nothing.\" he replied. I snorted. Nothing? Beheman went on his way, back to the group of men, who were sitting by a fire a little ways away from us. I put the blanket over Anna, who looked over at me and smiled in thanks. \"Aren't you cold?\" she asked. \"I am . \" I said, \"But I think you need it more.\" I took a bit of the bread and ate it. I fell asleep a while later. My body ached for some reason, although I hadn't done anything to strain it. My eyes fluttered as I dreamt. I was in a field, alone. The feel of the grass under my bare feet seemed so real. I walked about the grassland and saw the people I hadn't seen since I was little, my mother and father. My heart beat faster as I ran to them, embracing them. \"Mama! Papa!\" I sobbed. Their arms around me warmed my soul. But something broke the happy moment. Someone crying. I stepped away from my parents and searched for the source of the crying. It was behind me. I turned around and saw a girl hugging her knees up to her chest, face down, weeping. Her side of the field had gone from grassy to a barren land. Although I couldn't see her face, I recognized her immediately. Anna! I wanted to run to her, but my legs wouldn't move. I called out… \"Anna!\" I shouted aloud. \"Y-Yes?\" a shaky voice answered. I opened my eyes. I hadn't realized I called her name out loud. My face went red in embarrassment. I glanced over at Anna, whose eyes were surprised from my outburst. I rubbed my eyes. \"Is…is something the matter?\" she questioned. I shook my head silently. She crawled over to me and touched my hand. Her touch was cold. \"I just had a bad dream.\" I told her, and turned away. I couldn't face her. \" Propos...de moi? \" she wanted me to affirm. I didn't give her any response. I finally got the strength to look Anna in the eye. She looked so tired. \"Have you not slept?\" I wondered. \"No.\" she said. \"Why?\" I asked. \" Je ne peux pas dormir. \" she muttered. I couldn't blame her. I let out a sigh and held her close to me. She hid her face in my collar. Even though the blanket was around her, she was shaking like a leaf. I combed my hand through her long, brown hair. \"Listen, Anna…\" I began, \"No matter what those men are up to, I will not let them hurt you.\" She examined my stare, reading me. Her bottom lip started quivering. I was alarmed when tears flowed down her cheeks. Why was she crying? \"Why do you shed tears?\" I asked. \"You promise to protect me?\" she said instead of answering my question. \"I promise.\" I answered. Without warning, Anna forced herself on me, her lips locking mine. I gasped in surprise. Then I closed my eyes, wrapping my arms around Anna's waist. She broke the kiss. \" Quelle a été ça? \" I whispered, my voice a bit shaky. \"It's my way of saying 'thank you'.\" she said. END OF CHAPTER FOUR French translations: \"Propos...de moi?\" means About...me? \"Je ne peux pas dormir.\" means I can't sleep. \"Quelle a été ça?\" means What was that? or What was that for?[Chapter 5] Another Witch? Chapter Five: \"Danger\" The next morning the group set off again. The morning was peaceful and quiet. No one said a word. I smiled unconsciously and lay my head back against the steel post of the cage. Along the bumpy road we reached a bridge that would take us one step closer to Severac. Not that I was happy about it or anything. There was only one problem; the bridge was a wreck. While Felson and Hagamar argued amongst themselves about the horrible condition of the bridge, I studied it carefully. The ropes tying it together weren't as bad as I thought they were. But they certainly wouldn't hold this cage. At least, not with Anna and I inside of it. The biggest problem with the bridge was the slats of wood that allowed us to walk across it. Most of them were half broken. How were we supposed to get across if we had a huge chance of falling under? \"There's another bridge a little ways north of here.\" Hagamar said. \"We're not going all the way there.\" Beheman objected, \"We'll have to deal with what we have here.\" \"But Beheman…\" Felson said in a low voice, \"This bridge is a mess. We'll never get across it.\" \" Nous le ferons . \" Beheman replied and started to untie the horses from the wagon. I groaned at his stubbornness. I peered at Anna, who seemed alarmed that we were about to cross. I held her hand in mine, trying to reassure her that everything would be all right. Her hand was shaking but it held to mine firmly. Once Beheman got all the horses to the other side of the bridge, he tied a long rope that was in a sack to their reigns, and hooked the rope to the front of the wagon. He told Debelzeq and to get in front and lead the horses forward, while he, Felson, and Hagamar pushed from behind. I didn't hesitate to speak out: \"Wait a second. The wagon won't hold on this bridge if both of us are in here.\" I pointed to Anna and then myself. Felson and Beheman shared a look. They seemed to have a conversation without speaking. There was a moment of silence. \"She's right.\" Beheman announced after a while, \"The bridge would definitely drop from the weight. Let them out.\" he motioned for Hagamar to release us. \"But Beheman, they-\" Debelzeq started, but Beheman held his hand up that silenced him. Hagamar got the key out of his pocket and opened the cage door. I dropped down and then helped Anna out. Beheman held a hold of my arm and whispered in my ear: \"If you try to escape you will be severely punished.\" I acknowledged him. Anna and I stood at the other side of the bridge, pulling the horses. I could see the men's progress. It was going smoothly, but the ropes were snapping. As they were about halfway through, Felson's foot got caught in one of the open holes from under him. Beheman and Hagamar lifted him up completely until he was safe. The braiding was unwinding more and more. \"Push fools!\" I shouted at them. They were almost to the clearing. But one of the horses was starting to give out. Debelzeq pulled its reigns tighter. I was starting to panic. What if they didn't make it? \"Harder! Push harder!\" I shouted again. Finally, they got to the open clearing, and the bridge collapsed behind them. I wiped the sweat from my face. Beheman examined the horses, fed them. Then he turned to Anna and I. He walked to the back of the wagon and Hagamar gave him the key. He opened the door and we went inside without saying a word. He nodded to me in thanks for my idea. I gave him a small smile. We continued to move. I could hear Felson and Hagamar disputing about the bridge. I blocked out their noise. Anna was staring back at Beheman. I looked back and forth between them. \"Why are you staring at him?\" I asked. \" Pas de raison. \" she said, \"I'm staring into space.\" I shrugged and turned away. Then I noticed something, our path was being shrouded in fog. It took no time for the heavy vapor to surround us completely. I could hardly see my hand in front of my face. The men groaned in annoyance. \"We'll have to stop here until the fog passes.\" Beheman said. No one argued. Felson took some of the sacks off the wagon. They moved in an area a ways from us. Anna held on to me. \"I'm frightened.\" she said. I caressed her. It couldn't tell if the sky was getting darker. It bothered me that I didn't know what time it was. But hours passed and everyone but Anna and I fell asleep. And around this time, slowly but surely, the fog started fading away. When I could finally see my surroundings, the night was almost black. I stared up at the night sky; it was soothing, beautiful. The moon was full, its white light illuminating the ground. \"Ahhh, la pleine lune. \" Anna breathed. \"It's a sight to behold, isn't it?\" I commented. \"Yes.\" she agreed. She had a strange face on, not quite smirking, but it seemed like it, almost as if she was about to do something devious. I studied the look. She pulled away from me and put her hands down by her knees, kneeling like an animal. Eh, what's she doing? Before I could ask, Anna cocked her head up and howled like a wolf! My body started to shake from the uproar. I covered her mouth with my hand. \"What are you doing?\" I demanded. \"Well…\" she uttered, \"Whenever I see the full moon, I have this urge to howl like wolves do. It seems I have the instincts of an animal.\" It didn't make much sense to me. I didn't like that she alarmed me. Of course, her wailing woke up the men. Beheman and Felson quickly got up and came over to us. \"What was that?\" Felson interrogated. Neither of us said anything. \"Speak up.\" Beheman demanded. I was about to explain what happened, when another noise filled my mouth. The howling of wolves. My eyes grew wide. \"She summoned wolves!\" Debelzeq gasped. I shot a look at Anna that demanded an answer. She had an evil smile on her face. I started to believe that this was her intention. \"Hurry!\" Beheman shouted, \"We have to get away.\" Debelzeq and Hagamar got in front of the wagon. Beheman and Felson got on their horses. But a few wolves had already arrived. They growled and edge toward us. \"Go!\" Beheman ordered and shot one of the wolves with a crossbow. Debelzeq whipped the horses and they took off. There had to be at least a dozen wolves that gave chase. Beheman continued loading the cross bow and shooting arrows at them. But his aim was fouled up by the rocking of the wagon. He killed two more wolves but the rest of the arrows only hit the ground. I prayed that we would make it out alive. Debelzeq made the horses go faster and Beheman and Felson kept up with us. We finally made it out of the forest! The wolves didn't seem interested in following us past the clearing; they went back to where they came from. Debelzeq stopped the horses and jumped down. He demanded that Hagamar give him the key. He did. Debelzeq stomped to the back of the cage and opened the steel door. He went in and grabbed Anna's arm, pulling her. Anna started to scream and cry. I pulled her waist and freed her from Debelzeq's grip. \"Witch! You called wolves upon us!\" he yelled. Anna shook her head and hid her face in my collar. Her tears saturated my dress. Debelzeq tried to pull her away from me, but I held on strong. He hit her in the back, which made Anna cry out. I bit his hand until it bled. He screeched and hit my head. I let go of him. \"Enough, Debelzeq.\" Felson said in a low voice. \" Tu ne peux pas la tuer. We need to take her to Severac.\" Beheman remarked. Debelzeq scowled and came out from the cage. He locked it and began walking back to the horses. But he stopped right next to me. He glared at Anna, who was still crying. He gave a disgusted sniff and got back to his seat. He whipped the horses and asked Hagamar for directions. END OF CHAPTER FIVE French translations: \"Nous le ferons.\" means We will. \"Pas de raison.\" means No reason. \"la pleine lune. \" means The full moon. \"Tu ne peux pas la tuer.\" means You can't kill her.[Chapter 6] Another Witch? Chapter Six: \"Severac Part 1\" Note: Sorry it took so long but here's chapter six! Two more days passed. I kept my distance from Anna because I was still suspicious and honestly scared about what had happened with the wolves. But it was hard seeing as I was still locked in a cage. \" Regarde là-bas. \" Felson said. We all looked where his finger pointed, to a large stone building on the edge of a mountain, \"Abbey Severac.\" We made it past the hard road up to the monastery. My head bobbed to the sway of the wagon. When we reached the top, the entrance was lined by large stone blocks. \"Hello!\" Beheman called, but there was no answer. It was awkwardly quiet. The men looked around. \"Maybe they're out on a break.\" Hagamar commented to lighten the mood. Beheman didn't seem humored. The men searched the outside of the building to see if anyone was hiding in a corner. Nothing. \"We must check inside.\" Debelzeq suggested. All of them but Hagamar went inside. I could tell Hagamar was becoming frightened; he was shaking in his boots. He looked over at Anna and I, his eyes fixating on Anna. She stared back. Her eyes showed no emotion. A thought penetrated my mind; how could she be so sensitive, yet show no emotion? She lowered her head away from his glance and closed her eyes. Her mouth moved, but I couldn't hear anything coming out of it. I felt my body shiver as she began to sway in small circles. I touched her shoulder. \"Anna?\" I said softly. She didn't even respond. I shook her lightly, still no reply. Then her voice got a little louder. She was chanting something in a language I couldn't understand. \"Anna, stop it.\" I commanded. \"Shut her up!\" Hagamar demanded of me. I regarded him. \" J'essaie.\" I told him. Then the doors of Severac opened again. Beheman, Felson, and Debelzeq were as pale as ghosts. What happened in there? Debelzeq suddenly threw holy water on Anna. Anna hissed and moved back. \"You fools! I curse you all! You and your damned instruments of worship!\" she shouted and spat on Debelzeq. Debelzeq wiped it away. My eyes were locked on Anna; I was shocked at what I was seeing. \"Silence, witch!\" Debelzeq commanded. Finally it struck me that no one but the three men had left the building. No monks. I soon realized that all the monks had died somehow. I locked eyes with Anna. \" Qu'est-il arrivé ici? \" I asked, although not intending her to answer. She mumbled a low laugh. \"Ah, yes, the monks.\" she said, \"They have all died of the plague!\" My eyes grew wide. Even the holy men here had been killed by the Black Death. But how could she know this? \"Yes. They have died by the plague.\" Debelzeq affirmed, \"But your trial still awaits you.\" Anna shot a look at the men. Felson stepped forward, challenging her. Anna gave a low snort in annoyance. \"What? You think you can hurt me?\" Anna replied with obvious sarcasm. Debelzeq opened the book that was in his hands; it had a golden cover and the words \"Book of Solomon\" engraved in Latin. I had heard talk about the Book of Solomon when I was young. A neighbor had said that the book was sacred; it had all the hymns and rituals that defended man against evil. There were only five copies of it, four of which had been destroyed over the years. This must have been the last copy! Debelzeq opened the golden book and flipped through the pages. \" Ecce crucem dominé ,\" he said aloud, \" fúgite partes adversé adjúror ve serpents antíque …\" Anna closed her eyes and whispered something beyond hearing. Suddenly, Debelzeq screeched out in pain. My head shot up and I saw his hand was drenched in blood. It struck me that Anna had bewitched him! \"Stop it, Anna!\" I yelled and smacked her, which sent her backwards. She sat up and shot a cold glare at me. \"Ah, you…\" she whispered, \"You've been most helpful on this pitiful journey.\" She laughed a low laugh and looked me in the eye. \"You wanted to save me because I'm a lamentable soul, a girl who has been wrongly accused of witchcraft, and punished for something that was not her doing.\" her words were true. But it seems she was mocking them, \"And now that we're here, at the abbey, what has it brought you? What peace of mind has it brought you? Have I not been proven innocent by the monks, hmm?\" \"What are you saying?\" I questioned. \"It was my will that we came her to Severac. Everything that has happened was of my doing.\" she explained. I clenched my teeth. So she really wanted to come here after all. That's why she never begged to be set free. \"So what do you think of me now?\" she said. But her voice was softer, full of sorrow. The voice I had become so familiar with during the trip. Her eyes, which had been full of anger and hatred just a moment ago, were not those of an abandoned animal looking for a home. My mind went blank. I knew I shouldn't trust her anymore, but the look she gave me was irresistible. I had to stray my eyes away from her. Beheman forced Debelzeq to his feet. Debelzeq stared fearfully at his hand, as if realizing something horrible. Flipping through the pages of the Book of Solomon, he began a different ritual. \" Exi ergo transgressor ,\" he began chanting, \" Exi sedúctor, plene omni dolo et falláci a …\" Anna growled deeply, grabbing the bars of the cage. \"Shut up!\" Anna howled, \"Be silent!\" But he didn't stop. As he continued chanting, she pulled on the bars, trying to get out of the cage. The bars started breaking open, as if she had the strength of a hundred men! When the bars completely were pulled from the cage, she jumped out. She lunged towards Debelzeq and tried to scratch him with her long nails. But Beheman interfered, and threw her into one of the large pillars surrounding us. END OF CHAPTER SIX French translations: \"Regarde là-bas.\" means Look there or Look over there. \"J'essaie.\" means I'm trying. \"Qu'est-il arrivé ici?\" means What happened here? I got a comment from a user asking me to actually take the time to translate the Latin. So, here it is... The first part \"Ecce crucem dominé fúgite partes adversé adjúror ve serpents antíque …\" is translated as Behold the Cross of Christ I adjure them flee the opposing side and the old truth of the serpent .. The second part \"Exi ergo transgressor Exi sedúctor, plene omni dolo et falláci a …\" is translated as Come out, come out, therefore, a transgressor of the seducer, full of all guile and deceit ...[Chapter 7] Another Witch? Chapter Seven: \"Severac Part 2\" She lunged towards Debelzeq and tried to scratch him with her long nails. But Beheman interfered, and threw her into one of the large pillars surrounding us. Anna got back up and edged forward. She and Beheman shared a challenging glance at each other. \"Beheman.\" Felson called. Then Beheman turned to him, then at Debelzeq. Debelzeq had stopped the ritual from shock of almost being attacked. \"Debelzeq!\" Beheman yelled to wake him out of his daze. \"Huh? Oh, right…\" Debelzeq uttered. He continued the ritual. Anna hissed and her body flailed in seething rage. She pushed Beheman out of her way, but Hagamar grabbed her arm. She fought to break from his grasp, and bite his hand. Hagamar screamed and let go instantly. His hand didn't bleed at all. What a weakling. I wasn't sure how to respond to Anna's behavior, so I continued to just sit in the open cage. I watched as Beheman got to his feet and drew his sword, and so did Felson. Felson charged at Anna, who ducked away from him. Beheman followed after, doing the same, but put his foot out. I think he was trying to trip her. Anna flew up onto the rigid top of the monastery! She winced back at all of us, and then I noticed it; her body was covered in blue-black veins. I gasped under my breath. \"Anna!\" I screamed at her. She shook her head. There was a gust of wind, leaves and dirt filled the air. I had to close my eyes to ensure no debris hit my eyes. When the wind ceased, I opened my eyes and Anna was gone. Where…did she go? I asked myself. I saw the men head inside. I jumped down from the cage and followed them. \"Where do you think you're going?\" Felson commented. \"I'm assisting you in stopping her from whatever she's doing.\" I said. \"What help would you be?\" Hagamar growled. \"She likes me. Maybe if I distract her it'll give you a chance to finish the ritual.\" I explained and shot a glance at Debelzeq. Everyone stood silently for a moment. \"I think it's beyond that point, girl.\" Beheman sighed, \"It seems she is over your little friendship.\" I took Beheman's words into consideration. I didn't want to stay back and let the men have all the fun. I gave a blank look. \"Maybe. Or perhaps not.\" I shrugged. The men shared a look. \" Faire ce que vous voulez. \" Beheman answered after a while. We all headed into the southeast corridor. There, because we heard chanting. Evil chanting I assume. As we opened the large door, the chanting stopped. Silence. We looked around and saw dead bodies, the monks. \"So are we here now to banish the demon…\" Felson stated, \"Or save the girl?\" \"Both.\" Beheman said. I felt a little elated at his answer. A laugh filled the room. We looked above, around. A figure stood in the shadows, then slowly walked into the light of our torches. A girl with skin crawling with dark veins, her face angry like a demon's, but her eyes still lonely. This was the \"new\" Anna. \" Je dois vous remercier tous ,\" she said, almost in a mocking tone, \"for bringing the prize to me.\" \"P-prize?\" Hagamar stuttered. \"Yes. The prize…\" she mumbled. In an instant she was behind Debelzeq. She grabbed the book. \"The Book of Solomon.\" she stated and knocked Debelzeq down. He quickly got up and lunged for the book. But Anna was quick, and was out of sight again. I realized now what Anna, no, the demon inside her, wanted. \"Beheman!\" I called, and Beheman looked over at me, \"The demon wanted to come to Severac. It knew a witch would be brought to men who possessed the book of rituals that helped defend against evil. Its plan was to be brought here to destroy it.\" The men gasped in unison from my truth. A muffled laugh filled the room once more. \"You're smart, Elaina.\" Anna's voice echoed, \"But it's too late to stop me.\" \"Divide and search for the girl.\" Felson put forth. We all nodded in agreement and searched the large room. No sooner than we had split up, there was a loud scream. I rushed to the scene and saw Hagamar dead, his mouth wide open. \"Hagamar is dead.\" I hollered to the others. No one answered me. I felt a breath on my neck. I wheeled around. Anna looked into my eyes, read me, and smiled maliciously. \"You're so fragile.\" she told me. I glared at her. But I noticed she wasn't nervous or edgy like when I was around the men. She had her guard down. I stepped forward. \" Que ma amie aller .\" I said to the demon. It laughed through her. \"As if you have any say in the matter.\" it spat. I gripped my fist and, using all the power I could muster, I pushed Anna back. She lost her balance and fell. My hands unconsciously grabbed the Book of Solomon and I took off clear to the other side of the room. \"I have the book!\" I cawed, \"I have it!\" It took no time for the remaining three men to find me. I shoved the book at Debelzeq. \"Finish the ritual.\" I told him. He opened it and read aloud. \"Silence! Damn you!\" Anna's voice shrieked. She came running from the corner to take Debelzeq down. I blocked her and fell flat on my back. I groaned. Beheman helped me up. END OF CHAPTER SEVEN French translations: \"Faire ce que vous voulez.\" means Do what you will. \"Je dois vous remercier tous\" means I must thank you all \"Que ma amie aller.\" means Let my friend go.[Chapter 8] Another Witch? Chapter Eight: \"No More\" \" Silence! Damn you!\" Anna's voice shrieked. She came running from the corner to take Debelzeq down. I blocked her and fell flat on my back. I groaned. Beheman helped me up. Felson rammed Anna to the ground. He pinned her down. Anna writhed and hissed, trying to release herself from him. But Felson held on. It seemed that holding her down was a tough task. She got one arm free and slammed her fist into his face. He stood up and held his face, pained. I looked between Anna and Felson and made a quick decision to finish what Felson started. Je dois la maintenir enfoncée. I took one big step and nearly forced myself to fall on top of Anna's body. I held her hands above her head, she writhed even harder. \"Traitor!\" she shouted. It didn't faze me as I held on tighter. I was surprised at how strong she was. She nearly knocked me off of her more than once. I had to use all my might to keep her pinned. Finally, I heard the magic word: \"Amen!\" Debelzeq said. I let go of Anna. She screeched and flailed. I fought the need to turn away. Her screams turned into that of a deep, demonic voice. It shook all of us as it spoke, angry: \"Damn you! I damn you all!\" it screeched. The screams went on for another minute or two, and then Anna fell into a deep sleep. We all looked at each other. \"What just happened?\" I asked. \"The demon has been exorcised.\" Debelzeq explained, \" La fille est sauvée. \" We walked outside. Beheman held Anna's sleeping body. I examined the wagon, it was completely destroyed. Small chunks of wood were still falling off of it. All three horses were still tied to the stone pillar next to the entrance. They were neighing and kicking. Felson went over and calmed them down. Once they had been soothed, Felson and I got on one of them, Debelzeq hopped on another, and Beheman hopped on the last horse, tying Anna's arms carefully around his waist. I took one last look at Severac; the large pillars holding it up, and the almost mosque-like heading. For a monastery, Severac didn't seem like the appropriate title. We rode off back from where we came. There was a problem getting back to Avignon: the bridge we had come across was decimated, completely torn from both ends. We would have to find another way of getting home. \"Any ideas?\" I questioned. \"There's another path that leads out of the mountain.\" Debelzeq said, \"It will lead us back to Avignon. It isn't far from here.\" I guess that was our only choice. We headed back to find the route. Soon we faced two paths, one facing east and one facing west. I glanced back and forth at them. \"We should go west.\" I directed. \"What makes you think that's the right way?\" Beheman asked. \" J'ai un intuition. \" I told him, \"And I'm never wrong.\" Beheman and Felson shared a look. \"I say we listen to the girl.\" Felson remarked, \"There's not much worse than getting lost in these woods.\" Beheman shrugged and started west. The route led us to three days of riding. In the morning of the fourth day, we saw city walls and an immense structure with a wooden cross attached to the front. It was the city Avignon. We were home. We entered the town. The villagers were ominously silent, excluding the small whispers here and there. We followed Beheman to the town square. He got off his horse. \"Everyone, please gather round.\" he called, \"There is something I must share with all of you.\" People crowded around us. They stared not at Beheman, but at Anna and I. \"We have discovered that these two women are not witches.\" he concluded. An uproar stared. People shouted, cursed, booed. \"Yes. It's a shock to us all.\" he continued, \"But we must not put the blame on anyone. Not the Church, not ourselves. It is clear that we have misjudged these two.\" The villagers looked amongst themselves, and booming voices turned to whispers. Beheman turned to us and gave us and apologetic nod. I smiled to him in return. Anna did nothing. \"On behalf of the village, I sincerely apologize for this undeserved madness.\" he said to us. Debelzeq got off his horse. Everyone turned their attention to him. He took a deep breath. \"I would also like to apologize for this.\" he confessed, his voice was somewhat shaky, \"It was I that accused them of witchcraft. It was wrong of me. And I ask for your forgiveness.\" He glanced back at us. I nodded to him. \" Amis, rendre grâce à ces deux jeunes filles. \" Felson chimed in, \"For they are in God's loving arms.\" the people around cheered. I felt embarrassed and turned my head down. I saw Anna smile. There was a strange feeling inside of me, seeing Anna smile. END OF CHAPTER EIGHT French translations: Je dois la maintenir enfoncée. means I have to hold her down. (Although it translates as I have to hold \"it\" down.) \"La fille est sauvée.\" means The girl is saved. \"J'ai un intuition.\" I think you can kinda guess what this means, I have an intuition/I have a gut feeling. \"Amis, rendre grâce à ces deux jeunes filles.\" means Friends, let us give thanks to these two girls.[Chapter 9] Another Witch? Chapter Nine: \"What Am I To You?\" Note: OK! So this is the final chapter of the fanfic. If you liked it, great! If you didn't, then I'll have to try harder next time. These is more girlxgirl in this chapter. Don't like it? Don't read it. But I do highly suggest you read it anyway, 'cuz it's the last chapter. I was given a small house on the edge of town, next to the southern exit. The Church had been treating me like a special guest since our return. That night I was exhausted. I lie down on the straw bed and instantly fell to sleep. Another dream filled my head, something I hadn't had since that one night of the trip to Severac. I was near the ocean. There was warm sand from beneath my feet. The sun was high in the air, its light reflecting off the calm waters. I felt at peace as I approached the ocean. I sat down and put my feet in the water. I could almost feel it swishing on my skin. I wrote on the sand \"ELAINA\" and watched the sea take it away. I heard a noise from behind me. I looked back. There, Anna stood. She showed no emotion, just stared at me. I got up. Before I had felt peaceful, but now I felt angry. I winced at her. \" Tu m'as trahi. \" I said, remembering what she had said to me when we arrived at the monastery. Her words rung in my mind: You 've been most helpful on this pitiful journey … You wanted to save me because I'm a lamentable soul … And now that we're here, what has it brought you? … You're so fragile … \"Do I mean nothing to you?\" I spat. Anna shook her head. It enraged me even more. \"No? I mean nothing to you?\" I yelled. Again, she shook her head. My heart felt on the verge of breaking. \"Answer me with words, Anna.\" I demanded, \"What am I to you?\" She didn't answer. A light breeze blew. And as if she was an illusion, the wind carried her away like mist. I woke up from the sound of my own sobs. I opened my eyes and sat up. It was barely light outside. I tried to wipe my tears away, but more came. I hugged my legs up to my chest and put my head down to cry. A few minutes passed and I heard a knock on my door. I managed to get my composure and got out of bed to answer the door. It was a little surprising to see Anna standing at my doorstep. I held back a want to slap her in the face. \" Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici? \" I questioned, trying to hide an angered tone. \"I can't sleep and I wanted to see if you're okay.\" she replied. I sniffed and nodded. \"And I can see you're not okay.\" she said, \"What's the matter?\" \"Come in first.\" I said and led her inside. We sat in the chairs next to the stovetop. \"Anna…\" I started, \"What do I mean to you?\" \"What?\" she vociferated, \"Have you not figured it out by now?\" \"Just answer me.\" I said, slightly annoyed. \"Why, you're my friend, of course! I trust you with my life.\" she acknowledged. She searched my eyes for a reason. I bit my lip and glanced down. \" C'est est à propos le dèmon, n'est pas? \" she sighed. She catches on fast. I wasn't so sure how to answer her. I could only nod to her in return. She put her hand on my shoulder, I looked up. \"All those things I said to you then, I didn't mean them.\" she tried to reassure me, \"It was the demon talking, not me. You have to believe me.\" In my heart I knew she was telling the truth, but… \"The words still came from your tongue, your voice. That is what makes e so uncomfortable about it.\" I explained. Then I was lost in my own world again. The flashbacks of Severac played. I didn't know Anna was calling me: \"Elaina? Elaina!\" \"Huh?\" I uttered. She looked at me hard. \"What can I do to show you that you're my friend?\" she asked. I thought for a moment. \" Je n'ai sais pas. \" I admitted. Her eyes told me that she knew the answer. She leaned her head forward, closer to mine. I anticipated the next move and closed my eyes. Her lips pressed mine, and I moaned quietly. She lips were soft. The kiss was warm. I recalled the first night of our trip, when Anna kissed me after I had promised to take care of her. That was just a kiss, nothing special about it. But this was different. Real love filled it, filled me. It was something new that I hadn't experienced before. Anna broke the kiss, I opened my eyes. \"Is that better?\" she asked. \" Oui. \" I whispered. I got up and pulled Anna's hand. I leaned her up against the wall. I closed my eyes and kissed Anna. I felt her arms wrap around me. I took the opportunity to let my tongue explore the inside of her mouth. She tasted sweet. We moaned periodically, feeling the pleasure of each others warmth. The world seemed to slow down, like time stopped, the moments lasting forever. When we came to our senses, the sun had risen high in the sky. We decided to walk around town. During our walk, the villagers smiled at us, apologies and praises. I finally felt like I belonged somewhere. I felt like somebody important. END OF CHAPTER NINE French translations: \"Tu m'as trahi.\" means You betrayed me. \"Qu'est-ce que tu fais ici?\" means What are you doing here? \" C'est est à propos le dèmon, n'est pas? \" means This is about the demon, isn't it? I think I put \"Je n'ai sais pas.\" in another chapter, but just in case I didn't, it means I don't know. \"Oui.\" obviously means Yes. I think we all have common sense. Afternote: I should have said this from the beginning, but if you're having trouble pronouncing the french words, feel free to message me so I can clear it up for you.[Chapter 10] Another Witch? Chapter Ten: \"Sensation\" Deleted Scene Note: Okay, I know I said chapter Nine was going to be the last chapter. But I just had to put this up. I didn't know where in the fanfic I could put it in, so I just made it a \"deleted scene\". Anna moved away from the village. She thought it was nice that people didn't think she was a witch anymore, but she preferred to be in solitude and silence. She went to a small gravesite just outside city bounds. There were several marked graves and crosses above them. She pondered the graves, and wondered how many of them were plague victims; a whole lot she supposed. Then a certain grave caught her eyes. Scripted in stone, a name read \"ADRIANA de VERGER.\" She surprised she was to see her last name on someone's grave. She sat down and stared at it. Had she been a long-lost relative she'd never met? Suddenly, she felt a strange feeling inside of her, sadness, loneliness. What if this woman had been relate to her? What if she had died by the plague, like her parents and siblings? These thoughts overwhelmed her. She put her head down and silently cried. There was a voice behind her: \"Is she a relative of yours?\" Anna didn't bother turning around; she knew who it was. Elaina. \"I don't know.\" Anna squeaked out. Elaina sighed and put her hand on Anna's back in an attempt to comfort her. \"How many in your family died?\" she asked. \" Sept. My parents and five elder siblings.\" Anna answered. \"It must be hard.\" Elaina sighed, sympathetically. Anna wiped away her tears and shook her head. \"Not so hard.\" she answered, \"My mother always told me not to despair over a love one's death. Their souls are in Heaven now. They are happy.\" \"But it's hard living without a family.\" Elaina concluded. The truth of it struck Anna rather hard. She fought back tears. Another thought crept into her mind: she was alone. She clutched at her heart. Elaina saw the sorrowful look on Anna's face and wrapped her arms around the girl in a warm embrace. Anna still fought the deadening sadness and the threatening urge to cry. \"Let your feeling out.\" Elaina told her in a hushed voice. Anna wasn't sure she wanted to. But almost immediately she found herself sobbing. She grasped Elaina's sleeves and her face disappeared into the girl's chest. Elaina rubbed her back, quietly shushing and soothing her. For the first time in so long, Anna felt hopeless, alone. Her pride was shattered. \"Shhh, it's okay.\" Elaina cooed, \"I'm here.\" Anna looked up into Elaina's soft eyes. They told her everything was all right. Elaina figured that Anna was suffering from the pains of loneliness. \" Tu n'es pas seule.\" she told Anna. \"Huh? I don't… I don't understand.\" Anna sniffed, \"My family is dead. I have no one…\" Suddenly she swallowed the last sentence. The look in her eyes seemed as if she had just remembered something important. Elaina rose an eyebrow. \"I have no one,\" Anna stared, \"but you.\" Elaina held Anna closer to her. Now Anna felt a new emotion, a sense of belonging. She nudged her head deeper into Elaina's chest and took in her scent. A single tear escaped Elaina's eye as she held Anna lovingly in her arms. \"Anna.\" she whispered the girl's name, and the feelings that name brought to mind. Elaina cupped Anna's face with her hands, looking straight at her. They seemed to regard each other. Moments passed. Then, without warning, Anna forced herself on Elaina, locking lips with her. They closed their eyes. Elaina felt intrigued by the kiss, Anna felt loved. They moaned quietly. Then Elaina broke the kiss. \"Not here.\" she said. She got up and beckoned for Anna to follow her. Anna smiled and got to her feet. She followed Elaina back into town. Elaina led Anna to a small house. She opened the door and let Anna in. Once inside, she sat Anna down on the bed. Eagerly, she leaned her head forward until their lips were touching. Neither of them felt nervous about the kiss, they just knew it felt right. Elaina pushed Anna's shoulders gently until she was lying down. Anna's soft moans aroused her. She was curious to experiment with this feeling. Without breaking the kiss, she felt Anna's chest, undoing the four small buttons on her dress, revealing more skin. She felt the inside of the opening, not quite to her breasts. Her hands were warm on Anna's skin. Anna broke the kiss. \" Enlever ma robe. \" she instructed, unable to hold her strong feelings in any longer. Elaina blushed and pulled off the girl's dress. Anna sighed from the cool air that hit her body. Elaina realized that Anna had bigger breasts than she had imagined. Anna took Elaina's hand and lined the outside of her own entrance. Elaina continued without Anna's hand there to guide it. Anna moaned and closed her eyes. \"Enter me.\" she requested. Elaina did as she was told, slipping two fingers into Anna's entrance. Anna groaned loudly and bucked, which aroused Elaina even more and took it as a cue for her to go faster. Elaina pulled in and out of her hard and fast. \"Elaina… Ahhhnn…!\" Anna nearly screamed as she climaxed. Anna lay there, panting. Sweat dripped from her face onto the bed. \"Are you all right?\" Elaina asked her, wondering if she had gone too far. Anna nodded her head quickly. Elaina was just about to get off of Anna when she got pulled into another passionate kiss. Their tongues collided. Anna embraced Elaina, her arms clasped together at shoulder-length. \"Elaina…don't...leave me…\" she asserted between breaths. \"I won't.\" Elaina replied, breaking the kiss. She looked out the window that was on the opposite wall. She was thankful there was another house right next to it, so no one could've seen what they had been doing. She hadn't realized how dark the sky was. \"It's getting late. We should go to sleep.\" she suggested. \"Okay.\" Anna uttered. She got up and laid her dress on a chair at the other side of the room. Elaina pulled the covers open and was about to get in when Anna's voice stopped her: \" Attendre. \" She turned to Anna and rose and eyebrow. Anna motioned for her to take off her dress. Elaina nodded and stripped. Then she got in bed, Anna followed after her. Both their heads fit snugly on the pillow Anna's hand groped Elaina's breasts gently. The soothing feeling it had on her seemed to lull her to sleep. Anna smiled at the sight of her sleeping friend. She closed her eyes. Unconsciously, she hands continued to grope Elaina's breasts. The soft sounds of their breathing quietly filled the room.

I've just seen the film and i quite liked it. then this idea came to me... and it wouldn't leave my mind to i had to write it out sooo here is the first part... it is only like a little starter to the story, so you get a small hint about what it is about, and whats happening and blah! The next one will be more exciting well it looks exciting in my head any hoo :D Chivalry 1: Whispers Whispers, gossip and hushed voices all murmured together in the forming crowd, all squandering villagers, pausing their daily routine to gather at the small spectacle making a show if it's self in the tiny centre of the small village, the open square nothing more than a pit of sloshing mud under the recent days of rain, the over cast skies of grey keeping the damp world forever moist. The main attraction to hit the close knit little village was a strange man, plump and broad in frame but lacking in height, he wore the colours most wore, earthly browns. Thick trousers wedged into the tops of his tightly laced boots and a heavy wool tunic covered with a leather a fur pelt while a warm cloak draped around his shoulders. His head was bald but face held a remarkable about of hair, forming a long wiry beard and moustache and the man carried him self with the air of a noble man, though it was as plain as the clouds in the sky to see, he was not, despite the small entourage that followed him along with the many horses and large wagon. The man and his group was still a sight and the people of the small village could only crowd around in curiosity and hang on every word the stranger spoke, it was the few times anything would be seen as exciting within the village. \"Why are they all gathering?\" A young woman asked, her face fresh and pale, light freckles dashed across her cheeks and over her nose as she tucked away some light mousy brown hair behind her ear as she watched the small number of villagers gather. The questioned was given to a slightly older woman, still prime in her youth but the few years older than the first, the elder cast a slow glance over her shoulder, rich dark hair swaying with the light motion. \"I don't know,\" She answered truthfully. \"People around here tend to be like sheep, they just follow the flock, it's best not to get caught up and follow along,\" She cast the gathering people a disinterested look before turning her head back to the products in front of her. \"It's probably nothing anyway,\" The younger huffed, turning her back on the people of the village. \"What are you looking for?\" The younger turned to the elder with raised brows, only to receive a shake of the head. \"Nothing from here, I was just wondering if some of the vegetables form the patch are ready, if not then we'll have to buy some,\" The dark haired elder sighed lifting a hand to her more coloured cheek, her skin still rather pale but not a much as the younger's. \"I don't know what's wrong,\" The lighter haired youth huffed. \"Perhaps it's a curse,\" She added flippantly but luckily hushed. \"Don't utter that too loud,\" The elder's voice lightened with amusement. \"They aren't that superstitious are they?\" The younger raised a brow towards her light brown hair line. \"Of course!\" The elder scoffed before leaning closer to the other, lowering her tone. \"They'll burn you at the stake and cast you into the fiery pits of hell!\" she spoke with a dramatic edge and smile on her lips. \"Hafwen!\" The younger frowned casting a quick look around as she batted the elder away from her. \"It happens little sis!\" She smiled with a shake of her head while the light haired sibling gave a shake of her head. \"Hafwen! Rhoslyn!,\" A voice called, catching the sister's attention as they both turned, looking around in search of the person that had called them. A woman pranced towards them with quickened steps, her hair was as black as night and fell down her back like a wavy cloak. \"Auntie!\" Both the young women chirped in a pleasant surprise. \"How are you girls? Sorry to keep you both but your Uncle is running around after the sheep!\" The more mature woman rolled her eyes, but the smile on her lips showed the fondness she held for her husband. \"He still hasn't got round to fixing the fence?\" Hafwen questioned with a smile, it wasn't the first time the flock had gotten out. \"It's uncle Brac,\" Rhoslyn shook her head at her elder sister as if her words answered the question. \"Unfortunately not, so I have come in his place,\" the woman smiled. \"You'll probably be more help any way Enid,\" Hafwen smiled. \"Well I am far better at organising!\" The dark haired auntie gave a light laugh. \"Come on we'll get a few things for the farm then get your fathers medicine,\" Enid nodded, heading off, the two sisters following. 000 \"I'm sorry ladies, I haven't been able to get into the town to pick up any medicines,\" a stoutly man shook his head as he walked around the table in the small, dark room, heading to the window and opening the hatch, letting some light into the room and allowing a view of the small village's square. \"It's to do with them witch hunters!\" the elderly man grumbled, looking out the window at the commotion in the little village. The three women shared looks among themselves before following after the old medicine man of the village as he opened the door and stepped out under the roofing shielding the front of his workshop. \"What do you mean?\" Hafwen was the first to question, eyeing the odd men with their large wagon, drawing the attention of the small minded population of the village. \"Well, there has been talk, since the rebirth of the plague that a dangerous witch roams these parts,\" The grey, withering man started, his wise eyes watching the new comers. \"It is said she wakes the dead from their graves,\" he turned his old eyes to the three women as if he was telling a ghost story, expecting the ladies to be quivering with fear. \"But why are these men here, how are they the reason you couldn't make your usual journey to town?\" Rhoslyn questioned lightly. \"Girls! You shouldn't pry in these matters!\" Enid scolded both girls, giving a quick cast around to make sure no one had heard their talk over such a delicate matter concerning witches. \"These men are witch hunters, they are one of many groups scouring the plagued area in search of the fearful witch, they take any they suspect to be the witch and deliver them to the town's holy men,\" The short greying man answered. \"Why?\" Hafwen shook her head with a light frown. \"For payment my dear, the price to clear this plague and the threat of the walking dead is high,\" he licked at his dry lips before rubbing at his short wiry beard. \"But they are probably only rounding up innocent women!\" The elder sister's frowned deepened. \"They only get paid for finding witches, the holy men in town trial the women to separate the witches, from there the witches are sent into the city to seal their fate,\" with that the old man gave a nod. \"The men have stopped anyone from leaving the village, so I can't do my rounds,\" he grumbled as he headed back inside and closed the door behind himself once again leaving the women to exchange glances. \"Well that would be why there is so much interest in these men!\" Rhoslyn huffed turning to eye the gathered villagers and odd men. \"Hmm, they are still like sheep and follow the crowd,\" Hafwen shook her head. \"You girls should say no more on the matter now,\" Enid gave a light frown. \"Hafwen your right when you say they follow the crowd, if one person accuses another of witch craft others would soon join in, now I don't want you two gossipers getting caught up in anything or accused of anything, because the good lord help us these people will pick on the smallest of matters to make evidence against you!\" The elder woman looked between her two nieces, both old enough to think and act responsibly but being a parent and the two young women being family and with out their own mother she couldn't help but mother them. \"You don't have to worry, we're going to keep out of this nonsense,\" Hafwen shook her head as she gave one last look at the crowd.[Chapter 2] sooo here is the second part much longer than the first... i was planning on having our lovely knights turn up in this one ... the chapter kept growing sooo they are defo in the next one... i know this coz i've already written it he he :D 2: Unwelcome A fire burnt eagerly in the stone fire place of the homely farm house, the empty living space bathed in the amber light from the dancing flames until the wooden door creaked open, bathing the warm room with the fresh, white morning light from the bright outside world, the shaded figure of a woman stepping in, a basket balanced on one hip. The woman shuffled in threw the small door way before closing the door behind herself, closing off the assaulting mass of brightness from the outside. She stepped over to the short rectangle table in the centre of the room with three easy paces, setting the basket on top of it's solid wood surface and plucking the fabrics nested inside, beginning on folding them. \"Ah! My favourite niece!\" A loud deep voice boomed after the rattle of the door as the man made his way in, startling the young woman some with the volume but she half turned in her spot, looking over her shoulder with an amused smile. \"Don't let Rhoslyn hear you say that,\" The dark haired youth laughed lightly. \"So what do I owe this pleasure uncle Brac!\" she turned back to the washing the smile still on her face. \"Just checking in, how's my dear brother?\" The man looked around, his dark hair now greying with his age. \"He's resting still,\" The young woman's smile faded to a slightly saddened one. \"Do not fret Hafwen! He'll pull threw, your father is a strong man!\" Brac shared that same saddened smile but tried brightening his more. \"He is my brother after all!\" He then added to help lift the mood, earning a small laugh from the woman. \"Are the witch hunters still in the village?\" Hafwen questioned, like most trying to stay out of the commotion, wondering whether the strangers had gone or not. \"Afraid not, the men have started searching homes, they believe a witch actually resides in this village,\" He shook his head. \"That is ridiculous! Surely they can't be allowed to do this!\" the woman shook her head as she placed a folded tunic on top of her pile. \"When it comes to witch craft I'm afraid so,\" The elder man shook his head. \"Well I hope they move on quickly,\" The dark haired Hafwen nodded with a slight huff. \"We all do, but until then, I need help bringing in the flock,\" The man gave a coy grin. \"I have washing to do, lunch to prepare and dinner to cook!\" She smiled simply, turning to pass that smile to her uncle. \"It's Rhoslyn's turn to bring the sheep in,\" She stated simply. \"Yes but Rhoslyn is running errands in the village and I have no one else to help me!\" Brac, despite being a mature adult whined like a sulking child. \"You have three sons!\" Hafwen scoffed out a short laugh. \"You know what the boys are like!\" He tried to defend and with a roll of her eyes Hafwen caved. \"Alright fine, but only once I have finished the washing, got the stew on the fire, made sure dad is settled and told Rhoslyn after I've taken her lunch, so she isn't greeted with a near empty house!\" She held up a finger as she marked her stakes. \"Alright! That's fine! I'll have a brew while I wait!\" He nodded before heading out and with a huff and a smile the young woman continued with her chores. 000 Hafwen wasn't disturbed since earlier that morning when her uncle had flounced into the small farm house and in her time she had managed to clear the clutter that was left behind from breakfast and the lunch Rhoslyn had darted back for before heading back out, and now she was preparing for dinner than evening, prepping the stew the sisters and their ill father would eat. With a struggled groan Hafwen lifted the weighty pot of stew onto the fire so it could begin to heat up and cook while she was out helping her uncle with the sheep. Rhoslyn knew the house might be empty when she got back, Hafwen having told her when the younger popped back for lunch, saving the elder the trip of having to go find her and then return. With a huff Hafwen threw down the rag she was using to carry the pot and place it over the fire, her hands slightly clammy from the heat of the flames when she put the stew on. She then ran a hand threw her dark hair, the amber flames causing her hair to give a mahogany glow and pale skin more of a warm colour. A loud banging the rapped at the small wooden door, causing her heart to leap to her throat at the level of noise and power that came from the banging, her jolt of fright turning her to the door with wide golden eyes before she managed to calm herself from the shock and quickly open the door. \"Hello? Can I help you?\" A brow quirked at the group of strangers at the door but no answer was given, the moment the door was opened it was like an invitation and the men barged in, knocking Hafwen back into the room. \"What in gods name do you think you are doing!\" She yelped in a defensive shock, looking around at the few burly men rummaging and rooting around the home. \"Is that blasphemy?\" a deep growling voice questioned and with another frightened jolt the dark haired woman swivelled back to the door where the short, burly Witch hunter stood, blocking the light in the small door frame. \"I was startled, I shall repent later!\" She clipped back with an icy tone laced in with her sarcasm. \"We are looking for a dangerous Witch,\" The hunter started as he slowly prowled in to the room. \"I know no Witch and there is no Witch here,\" The youthful woman straitened out, crossing her arms loosely under her bust, her eyes moving away from the Witch hunter's leader and too the other men still sprotting around the room. \"And there is no Witch folded up amongst my clean washing\" she unfolded her arms to motion to the man lifting each folded item on the counter to peek under, his attention brought as his actions were noticed and he quickly stopped. \"What is in the basket?\" The leader continued his prowling, arms behind his as he moved around the woman to get a better look of the basket sat on the floor. \"Washing I haven't finished,\" Hafwen stated with a frown, her eyes glaring at the intruding man, watching with distaste as he strolled towards the fireplace, looking down his nose at the pot just starting to bubble over the flames before he leaned forwards to take a suspicious sniff. \"It's stew,\" The elder sister spoke before the question was asked, growing annoyed with the men cluttering her house and moving things with dirty, grubby fingers. \"Lovely and what is threw here?\" He pointed mildly to the closed door at the other side of the room. \"Nothing,\" Hafwen shook her head with a frown, but the moment the Witch hunter's dark eyes met hers he went for the door, the agile and protective young woman quickly slipping in front of him. \"Do you mind! I think you have disturbed enough of this house,\" She frowned, blocking the door way. \"Hiding something?\" the stocky man raised a bushy brow. Before she could answer a bump from up stairs alerted Hafwen to the men moving more freely around the house and she peered up at the beamed ceiling with an appalled frown but in this moment of distraction the Witch hunter pulled her away from the door and invited himself in. With a gasp, she rushed after him, nearly bumping into him as he stopped short upon seeing the ill, plagued man laying in the bed. The bed ridden man stirred slowly from all the commotion, bringing up a wheezy cough and instantly Hafwen darted around the Witch hunter and to her father's side, pouring some water from the jug at the side table by his bed into a small wooden cup. \"Here you go dad, you ok?\" She questioned with her brow creased with worry, holding the cup to his lips, allowing the ill man to drink before relaxing back against his pillows for more rest. She watched until she was satisfied he was comfortable and settled back for rest before turning her furious gaze to the damned Witch hunter. \"I think you should leave now,\" She warned quietly, setting the cup back and walking back to the unknown man, herding him back out of the room and closing the door behind herself. \"Do you know anyone that practices witchcraft?\" The man didn't seem to give up his quest. \"No,\" Was all Hafwen spat. \"Do you suspect anyone?\" a brow rose on his face. \"No!\" She spat once again, growing irritated with the man's presence. \"You have a sister, younger? Am I right?\" He effortlessly changed the questions causing Hafwen's expression to change just as effortlessly with confusion. \"It's a small village, everyone seems to know everyone,\" The witch hunter cleared as if the look on her face held her question of how he knew about her younger sister. \"At least they think they do,\" The burly man added a little more darkly, causing the elder sister to lean away from him with a wary frown. \"Your younger sister, she has a cat, does she not?\" His brows arched on his forehead as he asked the simple question. \"Yes,\" Hafwen shook her head, totally bemused. \"A black cat I understand?\" the hunter's face remained the same, with his brows raised in a patronising look. \"No! Now leave and take your brutes with you!\" She instantly scowled, defences raising at the unspoken accusation. 000 \"But Cai isn't all black…\"Brac frowned, leaning on the large stick he was using as aid for walking and herding the flock of sheep. \"She has a little white patch under her chin,\" The uncle rubbed under his own chin in show of the area they were talking about on the cat. \"I know, but someone in the village has given that as some fake suspicion against Rhoslyn!\" Hafwen frowned with worry, her hands gripping the skirts of her dress as she trod next to her uncle, both pushing the herd of sheep forwards. \"You worry too much, owning a mostly black cat will not see Rhoslyn branded as a Witch!\" Brac gave a comforting smile to his niece. \"I mean look! You own a mostly black dog and your not branded a Witch!\" He pointed to the sheep dog herding the flock, the animal a cross breed, with black and tan fur. \"I guess your right, I should really worry less,\" She nodded, watching the dog zip around the flock, raining in any straying sheep. \"Well done for standing up and being the man of the house too!\" The uncle stopped his walk and turned to grin at the youthful woman who in turn gave a nervous chuckle. \"Thank you, I think, but it was awfully terrifying, I thought my heart was going to come flying out of my chest it was beating so rapid!\" She lay a hand on her chest to match her words. Hafwen had told her uncle every thing that had happened and he praised her for showing the courage and back bone her farther would have shown if he was well enough and seeing too the intruding men, but also for having the protective manners and sharp whit her late mother would had probably added to the defence against the hunters. \"Hey fear is where courage comes from! You can't have it with out!\" Brac smiled while the working dog barked, his deep, growling yaps startling the sheep and sending them scattering. \"Gaius!\" Hafwen yelled with a frown, looking over to her dog as he faced towards the rising hill, barking consistently and turning every few yaps to look back at the two herders before facing the hill again \"Gaius!\" She called again, confused at the dogs behaviour before lifting her eyes further to what the dog was barking and seeming to motion at every time he turned to glance at them. \"Is that smoke?\" Hafwen the frowned. \"That's the farm!\" Brac choked with shock and instantly they both ran. Hafwen and Rhoslyn's father and Brac where bothers and they both owned the farm just outside the village and lived in two separate farm houses on the farm, but from the distance neither was sure which farm house was on fire. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ i shall fill this space with wiggly lines ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ yer... sooooo! Dashing knights in the next chapter... mabe XD[Chapter 3] Weeeeeeeeeell... they just keep getting longer well i say that but i just squeesed what i could in... ...and there is an actuall plot to this story... i made one up randomly while on my way to work on the bus it was quite the stroke of genious on my part! :D 3: Rain When they raced up the hill the burning embers reached high in the sky as the farm house Hafwen had been in only hours ago was being eaten by the flames. \"Father!\" She screeched highly as she darted for the burning estate only to be grabbed by her uncle, the man having to fight to restrain the young woman till her energy started to drop. \"It's too late!\" He murmured weakly, glancing to the side as his three sons and wife rushed over. \"We couldn't get to it in time, we were held in the village square, all we could save was the horses,\" Enid explained quietly. \"What happened! Where is Rhoslyn!\" Hafwen turned to her remaining family with wide eyes, desperation straining her voice. Enid pursed her lips tightly together before turning away with a sob, quickly covering her mouth. Brac frowned in confusion, just as lost as the elder sister was. \"What happened!\" This time she shrieked, looking between her three cousins for an answer if her aunt wasn't going to give one. \"She…she's been accused of witch craft,\" Howell spoke up gravely, instantly shattering what was left of Hafwen's world. \"They took her and burnt the house, we couldn't get your father out,\" He then finished bowing his head. Brac tried to swallow down the dry lump in his throat as the words rushed to him but all Hafwen could do was watch, glossy eyed as her home and ill father burnt down before her eyes, tears streaking down her pale face. Her breathing was shaky as she controlled herself from sobbing, her eyes roaming the burning mass. She gave a small jolt as Gaius' barking tugged her from her daze and with a few fluttered blinks her water logged eyes turned to take in her dog, he was barking determinedly at the fencing that had penned in a few of the horses, but he could go no further because of the heat from the blaze. Hafwen had to squint to see what had possibly caught the dogs attention and then made the distorted figure out. It was Cai, Rhoslyn's little black cat with a white chin, bathed in it's own blood and hanging from the fencing by it's pinned tail. \"Gaius! Come on boy!\" Hafwen instantly called loudly, her voice strained as she clapped her hands and turned away from the blaze. \"Where are you going?\" Howell lifted his head with a worried frown. \"Which why did they go!\" The young woman instantly barked. \"Which way!\" She repeated when she wasn't answered quick enough. \"East road that heads to wards the fork!\" The young man answered quickly and with a nod she ran, the dog at her heels and family calling after her. 000 The East road from the village was long and windy and eventually lead towards a split road the villagers called the fork, one road she knew would lead to the larger town, which from there would then lead to the city and the other road she had no clue, she never needed to know, but luckily she knew the witch hunters were heading to the town for their payments. Instead of following after the long winding road, when on foot it was easier to cut threw the fields and forests, the path was direct and far, far quicker but the rout was never used by anyone not on foot because carriages, wagons and trailers needed the road and horses stumbled on the trickier parts of the woods. Hafwen ran as fast as she could and as well as she could in her clothing, twigs and branches reaching out for her, snagging at her hair and dress. The light was fading slowly from the sky but she used her dog as a guide seeing what he was dodging and where he was jumping only tripping or stumbling the odd few times, having to correct the hold on her dress to lift the skirts up higher once or twice and before long she had stumbled down a steep embankment with a yelp and fell into the side of a horse and the mounted rider's leg, causing her to go ricocheting back and fall while the horse reared up with a loud whine, throwing it's rider. The small commotion of horse and rider drew attention of the travelling companions, the rest of the mounted men pulling the reins, stopping the easy pace each horse was plodding at, even the two larger horses lugging the large wagon were pulled to a stop. A few shouts were raised as the men communicated to each other, working like the pack animals they were and with in no time Hafwen was retrieved from the ground a little stunned by the first collision and shook into silence by the gruff man yanking her to her feet by one arm. A short gasp passed her lips as a blunt throb pulsed in her upper arm from where the tips of the man's large fingers were digging into the soft flesh of her arm threw the sleeve of her dress. Once her bearings where found and the elder sister focused on what she was after once again, a frown instantly formed on her brows as she pulled out of the man's grasp sharply, stumbling a step back before giving a wild look around. \"Hafwen!\" A small voice called from a short distance, the pale faced youth pressing herself against the caged wagon, one arm reaching threw the bars. The younger sister had grown with curiosity and instantly started to look around once everyone had stopped, wondering what on earth was going on, she wasn't the only one, the small group of women also blamed as witches and thrown into the caged wagon looked around in hope and wonder, but once the brunette spotted a familiar dog slink towards the wagon for cover did she then recognise the woman being dragged up. \"Rhoslyn!\" The elder sister called back, eyes wide and alert as she looked around desperately in the directing of the voice and there she saw the arm reaching out threw the wagon but the moment she took a step towards her sister she was restrained once again. \"Well, I must say I thought you were in the house also,\" A gruff man stated quite simply as he rode a bay mare forwards and looked down at the restrained woman. \"You're the devil!\" She hissed out, teeth clenched in an attempted to control her voice, the fear in her chest so big it was starting to swell in her throat and strain her voice and if she let that show then she would seem nothing more than a weak girl about to cry. Her words came out strong, despite the fear rushing threw her and the mounted Witch hunter raised his brows at the words aimed at him. \"I'm quite the opposite my dear, I'm ridding this world of evil, you should see me as a savour,\" He pursed his lips and raised both brows in a patronising look down at her, his face showing he saw nothing more than a naïve and stupid little girl. \"Some have even classed me an angel because what I have done for them,\" he lifted his bald head, his long beard shifting up his chest slightly with the movement. \"You are no angel and my sister is no witch!\" Hafwen spat out once again in her well forced strong voice, meeting the hunter's gaze with a sharp glare, her eye's almost seeming as predatory as a wolf's. \"I beg to differ, you're sister has been found guilty,\" The man leaned forwards in his saddle, leering towards the elder sister. \"What evidence did you find!\" Hafwen challenged. \"Enough to see her sentenced,\" The hunter easily dodged the question. \"Perhaps owning a cat is her sin!\" The elder sister offered, her brows raising as she shot the man a patronising look of her own. \"Witches are said to have black animal companions, but hers was black and white, perhaps she is a half witch?\" Her shoulders lifted in a tiny shrug, the mocking look still on her face. \"But then, I have a dog who is mostly black, perhaps I am half witch two? Will I be thrown into the back of your collection wagon?\" Her words where sharp and fast, much like a whip being cracked and everything she said left the man unable to answer fast enough. \"Now I know my sister is no witch as do you, now let her go!\" The elder sister demanded, she had never spoken out of line before, she's never truly had too, she's had the rare moments where she had, had to stand up to people or for people but she was the defensive sort of person who would always fight to protect, she was never confrontational, she didn't look for arguments, she never looked for fights. But in this moment she had nothing, yet everything to lose. The men could take no more from her, everything that was very and truly dear to her heart was gone, yet her sister was still there, still able to live. The heavens above crackled with thunder before the darkening grey skies released heavy rain like the thousands of tears that had been shed because of these destructive men. \"Move on men!\" The Witch hunter straitened his back and called, squinting threw the rain. With a crack of the whip the two large working horses danced into movement, lurching the wagon forwards, sending the standing sister stumbling to the side. She looked around panicked as the group started to move and she was drifting further away from being freed and let back to her sister. Her dark brown eyes flashed back to her elder sister while a pale hand swept her messy light brown tendrils of hair from her face. \"Hafwen!\" She called out desperately, fear buried so deep inside of herself she felt sick. \"Rhoslyn!\" Her elder sister called back in a panicked desperation, her voice breaking and arms fighting violently against the man that had restrained her. Her aggressive struggling finally granted her freedom and she burst for the slowly rolling wagon that was turning left at the forked road, her feet slouching the in the mud the rain had soaked. The last thing Hafwen saw of her sister was her terrified face and pale hand reaching out for her, the last thing she heard was the murmur of voices and a dog's bark and the last thing she felt was the sharp restraints of someone grabbing her and a blunt pain to her head. 000 \"You're a priest,\" An elder man with grey white hair and a short beard of stubble started up, casually stating what was obvious to the small group. \"Thank you for noticing,\" A dark haired man nodded, giving a quick glance to the rider at his side before returning his eyes forwards to the road, quite the unimpressed look on his face. \"Would you say we were…unholy?\" The first man questioned, a small smirk quirking up on his lips. \"Hoods gentlemen, it's about to rain,\" A third man spoke up after hearing the thunder, but not to involve himself in the current conversation, simply to warn and as he pulled his hood up over his messy length of hair the others soon following as the rain poured down, hoping to keep as dry as possible as the rain started. \"I don't know what to call this,\" The priest shook his head from under his hood, motioning to their small group with a wave of his arm, what was being said understood by all men. \"Well it's not normal,\" The eldest of the men rolled his eyes. \"We'll find out once we reach Marburg,\" The priest gave a huff. \"I hope we get some better horses by then,\" The first man grumbled gravely, looking down at the grey speckled animal carrying him, it's steps slow and clumsy. \"Stop,\" The third rider uttered lowly, pulling back on his horses reins, the animal slowing it's plod, the other riders and slow horses soon following. \"What? What is it?\" The brown haired Priest looked around the area, all he could see is wood land. The elder man frowned at his companion he'd known for years before turning to face the road ahead, squinting to see threw the harsh amount of rain. A figure lay across the muddy road and all men frowned, before the mounted rider that had first spotted the body moved his horse forwards again. \"Behmen!\" The first man called, waiting as the man turned in his saddle to look back at the elder man. \"The dog,\" He nodded forwards again, motioning towards the animal that seemed to accompany the feminine looking body, kicking his horse to move up next to his friends. Both men inspected the animal from their distance, it was pacing around the body and once again the man, Behmen, kicked his horse forwards causing it to snort and instantly the dogs head picked up with perked ears and started to bark at the group before pausing to look at the woman laying in the mud, then once again barking at the men before turning to the body and dipping it's nose to the head, ruffling the dark hair. \"It could be dangerous!\" The greying man spoke up, unimpressed with his friend heroic antics, the person laying in the road was probably dead and the dog was more than likely savage and killed them. \"It's a pet Felson!\" Behmen looked over his shoulder with raised brow, out to prove him wrong. \"It could have killed her,\" Felson spoke from where he sat on the grey horse, resting his hands on the front of the saddle. The man had seen the dog pacing around the body, ears perked and nose dipped towards the face, most would see this as the animal simply feasting on it's find but it was how Behmen first noticed the dog that made him think other wise, the animal was sat by the woman's head, ears perked and looking down at her, watching over her and that gave him thought that the loyal pet was waiting and trying to get it's owner to wake up. Once closer Behmen dismounted and he could now hear the dogs pitiful whines and with one step forwards the dog started to bark again and the one sign the dog gave to show it wasn't aggressive was the madly wagging tail, it was obviously glad for the help. The dog was quick to turn and check back on it's owner, snuffling it's nose into the mass of hair before turning to the slowly approaching man expectantly. Although the dog didn't seem aggressive you could never be too careful with a protective pet so he held a hand out slowly as if to show no harm as he knelt next to the woman. The dog gave a slight huff and edged towards the man's hand for a stroke, which he was rewarded. \"Good dog,\" Behmen mumbled to the animal petting it's soaking fur as his other hand reached for the woman, brushing the wet hair from her face and tiling his head as he looked for signs of life but the moment part of the woman's face was visible the dog jumped forwards with a flurry of desperate licks till the woman stirred with a frown and a groan. \"Gaius!\" She mumbled weakly, trying to scold the dog for slobbering her. \"Is she ok?\" The priest questioned, both him and Felson having moved their horses closer with curiosity the moment the dog sat at Behmen's side. \"Well she's alive,\" Felson nodded, the woman's conscious self being a good sign. Behmen unintentionally ignored his fellow riders as he pushed the dog gently from the woman and carefully lay a hand around her arm as she started to push herself up. \"Easy!\" He commented with a frown, settling his other hand to the side of her ribs, despite the mud that coated his hand from where the poor woman had been laying in the soaking mud, guiding her up into a bit of a side saddle sit. Her eyes where hazy but flashed around in a frantic alarm, too many thought rushing threw her head as her breathing picked up into panicked gasps, her body shaking from the cold, the only thing protecting her was her soaking, mud soiled dress that was proving to be less help. \"The poor girl's terrified!\" The Priest frowned, worried and concerned for the woman. \"Makes you wonder what happened,\" Felson straitened with distaste, the thought of someone bringing such a fate on a defenceless woman and leaving her like this turned him. Behmen worked at the buckles keeping his long cloak around his shoulders with one hand, the other hand remaining at the woman's rips to keep her upright. \"What's your name?\" The man questioned as he swung the cloak from his shoulders and around her's. \"…Ha-Hafwen,\" She shuddered out, the cold sending a fierce shiver threw her as she sat in the mud, one hand still pressed to the floor amongst the slushy ground in aid to keeping herself up right in her side sit. Like water putting out fire, the rain had stamped out the fighting fire with in the elder sister and leaving her now quivering unable to fight and peering at the men unsure, her eyes flicking between the two men on the horses behind the one helping her, she was not at ease around these men, not in the slightest, especially giving her circumstances. \"Hafwen?\" Behmen tried the name on his tongue trying to catch the woman's attention but he could see she was scared and confused, looking around at the group but he needed her attention so he lifted a hand to her cheek and directed her gently to face him \"Hafwen, I'm going to get you home, but I need you to show us the way,\" He nodded, hoping to encourage an answer from her, and with a shaky breath she gave a tiny nod, her cheek wet and icy against his hand. Yaaaaaay for the guys! No one in perticular *cough*Behmen*coughcough* Sooooo yer... not really an attractive first meeting, laying face down in sloshy mud, soaking wet with a dog licking your face to wake you up ...hmmmm sexy! But we can't all have our first meeting to be walking threw a sun lit feild, picking flowers with the light in your face and wind blowing your hair back all beautiful like falalalalaa he he[Chapter 4] yeeeeeeeeeer... chapter 4... it was gunnu be longer... but then i thought... noooo i'll stop here 4: Tears Loud rapping sounded at the short wooden door to a farmhouse, the family inside jumping at the strong sound before the man of the house strode to the door and opened it sharply due to the rather urgent pace of the knocking. He squinted suspiciously threw the downpour of rain at the group of figures and if it hadn't been for the man's wife lurking behind him curiously then he wouldn't have noticed the smaller framed person at the fount of the group as someone he knew. \"Hafwen!\" The woman gasped, ducking under her husband's arm that was blocking the slightly open door way and opening her arms to the barely recognisable woman, shivering under the protective arm around her shoulders, her dark hair was soaked and clinging to her scalp, half soiled with mud on one side of her head, the straggled ends sticking to her paled face while her blue tinted lips quivered with her short raspy breathing. The man supporting her guided her towards the other woman's waiting arms with out a word, trying to get the poor woman out of the rain as soon as possible and in doing so saving the older woman from stepping out into the torrential rain fall. Brac pulled the door open wide as he stepped to the side letting the two women he knew in before flicking his head back to face the small group of men, three all together, two of the men stood further behind the one that had been holding his nice, both keeping a hold on the horses. \"Please come in!\" He urged waving them in. \"Boys!\" Brac instantly barked flashing his eye's to his three sons that were all been stood around the table from where they had previously jumped up from their seats in alert. \"Howell, Dewey tend to the horses! Evan, finding something dry for these men!\" He ordered his son's, the two elders bowing their head and ducking out into the rain, while the youngest darted upstairs to root around in the linen closet. Brac held a welcoming arm out as if reaching for the men as he waited for them to pass threw the door frame, the first man having stepped in with a gracious bow of his head while the other two men soon followed after allowing the two boys to take control of their horses and pull the animals off in a hasty trot toward the barn. None of the strange men felt now was a time to say anything, they all could see the family was clearly shocked but they knew questions would be asked in time, when the air had calmed. \"My goodness girl!\" Enid grasped as she pulled the unfamiliar cloak from around the younger woman's shoulders, leaving her shivering niece back in her soaked dress as she set the item over the back of the chair, not wanting to be disrespectful to the item's owner even in such a situation. Hafwen clutched herself in an attempted to hug the little warmth she had, stopping it from leaving, but he rain drenched mud heavy dress did less than help, even stood in front of the fire place as she was. Enid soon darted back to her niece and turned the woman sharply to face the flames as she started to un tie the back of her dress, blatantly ignoring the fact that three strange men now stood within their home. \"Enid!\" Brac called with a frown before his poor niece was stripped in front of the men, but the men where gracious and all bowed their heads, turning their eyes else where in the room. \"She has to get out of these soaking clothes!\" The elder woman snapped, peeling the frozen woman from the dark green dress, leaving her in the white under dress that turned slightly transparent as the wet fabric clung to her skin, showing patches of peachy skin when where it suck to her body. \"It's a good thing you were too worried to take the bath today!\" The dark haired woman then huffed steering her still shivering niece off into the back room where the unwanted bath lay, already filled with water ready for Brac after his usual hard time of work, but tonight he was far to restless after Hafwen had darted off. Once the door closed the white under dress was yanked up over her head and Hafwen was shoved into the bath, her Aunt determined to scrub her clean and wash the head back into her skin. 000 The three men stood in their places, not awkward just simply not knowing where to place them selves, that was until a panicked young boy came pounding down the wooden stairs, his small arms piled with various things for the men to dry them selves and keep warm, the odd few items having dropped from his hold and left a trail down the stairs. This gave the men something to do, each slowly moving forwards to help the young boy. \"Please, make yourselves comfortable, I will find you all something dry to change into,\" Brac nodded and made a move towards the stairs. \"Thank you,\" The seeming leader of the group that had guided Hafwen to them spoke, the other men soon giving there thanks whole heartily, after all the men had nothing but the clothes on their backs and the weapons that had been laid by their sides, the horses they had managed to pick off from a conman that had been rousing trouble in the first village they had come across. They hadn't a need to pick up anything materialistic on their travels, they just needed to reach Marburg. The three men bustled quietly as they shred layers of their wet clothing, folding and piling each item to save from making a mess, before wrapping the dry, warm linen around them as the fresh, dry clothing was then handed to them allowing them to change quickly. The door to the back room then gave a small bang as it closed, the dark haired woman striding into the room regardless of the fact not all of the strangers had managed to change fully. \"Enid!\" Her husband quickly jumped as if to save his wife's delicate eyes. \"Oh! It's nothing I haven't seen! I have you and three sons, I see enough male figures daily!\" She simply waved off, tottering of to a shelved unit and grabbing three bowls and placing them on a small tray before she headed towards the still brewing broth over the fire, dishing some of the hot stew into each bowl before heading to the long wooden table and setting the bowls out. \"Eat up! Bread is already on the table!\" She ordered, far too motherly for her own good as she then grabbed a basket and balanced it on one hip as she zipped around the three men collecting up their wet, dirty clothing to be washed. \"The horses are settled,\" Howell spoke as he shuffled in with his younger brother, their hair damp and clothes only lightly speckled with the rain but trouser legs where splattered with mud. \"Gaius was following too!\" Dewey bowed his head to the dog slinking into the room, soaked and muddy. \"Boys change! Dog out!\" Enid pointed and directed to each as she poke and like the dog, they all bowed their heads and slunk off quickly and with a pleased nod Enid turned on her heels and strode off with the basket, back to check on Hafwen leaving the three strangers of the house to pass odd glances between each other before the eldest with greying hair gave a shrug. 000 After a small amount of time the three sons had soon come back into the room and loitered around while the men sat gingerly at the table, eating the food that had been given, or more ordered to them. \"I'm sorry, my wife is over bearing at times,\" Brac sighed. \"I'm Brac and my wife is Enid,\" He nodded, to the men, hand shakes not needed for this was no formal meeting but before any of the men could reply with their names, be them real of fake, the woman they had found earlier was shoved back into the room in a night gown, her skin flushed with a bit more colour and hair damp but clean yet her lips still quivered and even though the colour brightened on her face, her eyes remained dull and lost. \"Sit down girl!\" Enid scolded, shoving her down in a seat at the head of the table and instantly draping a blanket around her shoulders before deciding she needed a second one, she then pulled Hafwen's dark hair out from under the blankets and laid it on top so it would dry easier and wouldn't cause a chill on the back of her neck. \"Honestly what where you thinking!\" The woman then frowned while Hafwen looked at the table top. \"You could have been killed! You know that right!\" Enid burst in the start of a hysterical rant. \"They are not nice men and could have done away with you!\" She threw an arm in the air. \"Enid!\" Brac barked up with authority, frowning at his wife. \"Here you go Wen!\" the youngest of the son's mumbled quietly, lifting a bowl of stew to the table and pushing it in front of his cousin. \"Thank you Evan,\" She whispered softly in reply. \"…What happened?\" All eye's suddenly shot to Howell, the eldest, who instantly shrivelled up at all the different looks, scowls from his parents, a raised brow from the eldest stranger, a slight gawp from the younger one with dark hair and a rather indifferent look from the last stranger that quickly turned to unimpressed as he turned his eyes away from the boy and towards the young woman, her pretty features now clearer to see with out the mud. \"I failed, isn't that obvious,\" Her voice was soft, lost even but the moment her eyes flashed up to take in her cousin the fire could be seen with in them. \"I'll set you gentlemen up a room to stay and I'll have your clothes back to you once they have been washed. \"There is no need for that, we'll get out of your way,\" Behmen started to stand. \"Nonsense! You all went out of your way and brought our niece back!\" Enid frowned, placing a hand on his shoulder and pushing him back down into his seat, much to his surprise, his old friend's amusement and their newest friend's shock. \"Hafwen we'll set up a cot next to the fire for you, you need the heat,\" The woman then headed off to do as she said and set up a room for the men. With a sigh Hafwen looked off to the side, her eye's finding the fire as she slowly reached a hand up to prod a tender spot on her head, only for her face to twist lightly in a small wince. With a small frown Behmen watched her and slowly rose from his seat once again, stepping in front of the young woman and surprising her lightly as he blocked the light from the fire and even more so when he moved her hand from her head and inspected the tender part of her head himself. \"You where hit with a blunt object, probably the hilt of a sword,\" Behmen stated, as his old friend nodded. \"Explains why you were laying face down in the mud unconscious,\" He shrugged before tearing a piece of bread in half and taking a bite while his friend turned from the young woman to give him a raised brow. \"It feels that way,\" Hafwen mumbled weakly, turning away from the man and taking no notice to the other man's words as she reached a trembling hand up to clutch at the blankets and bring them tighter around her. \"Right! Get in front of the fire!\" Enid's voice barked, the woman having appeared with more blankets and sheets, and the middle aged son awkwardly dragging a mattress, having at one point been dragged into helping. \"And Howell! Go clean the dog off!\" The woman then sent her eldest son off with a sigh. \"Enid, please calm down,\" Brac gave a tired sigh, he didn't even know the names of the men that had helped his niece and were now held captive in his farmhouse by his controlling wife. \"We never got you gentlemen's names?\" Brac then tried to start casually, while Enid busied her self with placing a blanket down on the stone floor to take the cold harshness away before getting Dewey to lay the mattress on top of the blanket. Hafwen watch blankly as her aunt tottered around the small make shift bed in front of the fire laying down sheets and blankets. \"I'm Behmen,\" The tall stranger still stood nodded. \"Felson,\" His older friend gave a nod from where he sat. \"My name is Debelzaq,\" The darker haired man added. With a small frown tugging at her brows, Hafwen watch as her Aunt's actions came to a slow dwindle before she looked up at her husband, Hafwen's eyes turning to watch her uncle also, the man sat as if he was mulling over a taste in his mouth before he gave a slow nod and smile. \"Well it's a pleasure to meet you all,\" He stated. \"Hafwen!\" The odd atmosphere was broken once again by Enid as she waved the young woman over, and when she didn't move fast enough the aunt was pulling the poor frozen woman up and leading her to the mattress by the fire place. Had Hafwen been in her normal state of health her Aunt would have had a hard time even trying to push the young woman around but now that she was physically and mentally drained, she just allowed it. Once sat on the mattress Hafwen simply tucked her legs to her side and brought the blankets back around her whole form as the fire warmed at her back and dried her damp hair. She sat listening to the murmur of exchanged words but not hearing what was said, her eyes turned down to the stitch of the fabric hiding her lap, the odd shadows dancing across it from the fire's flames. She had noticed the odd exchanges of looks her aunt and uncle gave but she didn't understand what they were for, they came just after the men's names but that still made no sense to her, these men where strangers but as she thought more on the matter she knew her aunt was prone to hearsay and would drum what ever she had heard or learnt into Brac, so the names spoken could simply hold some odd gossip Enid had probably heard and believed, notorious bandits, smugglers, conmen, ghosts what ever the story, Enid would know and believe. It wasn't long till all thoughts had gone from Hafwen's mind and she sat simply numb, hearing the crackle of the fire behind her sent an odd chill over her and when she pinched her eyes shut she could see her burning home, her poor father trapped inside, screams came to her ears along with the roaring flames eating away her home, the image and sounds so clear she jolted her self out of the vision with a whispery gasp and teary eyes. She kept her distress quiet, slowly lifting the back of her hand to her lips to hide their quivering as she then bowed her head, her dark hair sliding off her shoulders and creating drapes at the sides of her face as she closed her watery eyes, only letting a tear fall away from one eye before a second followed shortly after from her other eye. She tried desperately to control herself, forcing a slow breath in and blowing it out just as slowly, if a little shaky, as her hand shook where it was positioned hiding her mouth, she didn't want to draw attention to herself because she didn't want anyone coming to her, she didn't want the awkward hugs and fake words and speeches that people can only muster when they have nothing they can possible say to make it better. Hugs to fill the space and words to fill the silence, but Hafwen couldn't deal with that, she couldn't open her arms for a hug and cry on someone's shoulder when upset, she could only keep to herself and want to be alone, so turning to the lumpy pillow thrown down on the mattress she lay down, curled in a protective ball under the two blankets her aunt had given her, she kept her emotional self to her self, as usual. Yaaaaaaaaaaaay for pushy overbaring aunties! ... or is it just me on that one... the buggers... and waahaay for keeping your emotions and inner turmoil bottled up inside of you! Eatting away slowly at your heart and soul! ...it saves the awkward moment of bursting out into tears infront of strangers...whom can't comfort you with out seeming weird! see a silver lining to the keeping the inner turmoil to your self! YOU SAVE EVERYONE FROM THE AWKWARD 'THE HELL DO I DO' MOMENT![Chapter 5] Sooooo yer... i forgot how easy it was to write this :D coz the idea's just flow in and i basically know what i wanna put i have a begining, middle and end all planned out ready its rough sure... but i know where the story is going so i'm not really umming and areing about what to put next it's just the creative part of everything that just takes tiiiime he he any whoooo... 5: Proper \"You should rise with the sun now Hafwen,\" The voice was soft as was the gentle rocking of her shoulder from where the dark haired woman was trying to waken the younger woman from her sleep. \"Hafwen!\" The soft voice vanished and the gentle rocking turned into a sharp shake. \"Yes!\" The younger woman frowned, swatting away her aunt. \"It would be best if you got up and dressed before our guests come down, it would not be proper for them to have to step over you while you sleep later than you should!\" Enid rose her brows expectantly. \"After last night I doubt they would have taken much notice to what was proper form me,\" Hafwen stated as she sat up. \"You should change into some warm day clothes none the less, you must keep your body warm to save illness taking you!\" the dark haired elder scolded. \"Then if I am to keep warm shouldn't I say in bed?\" Hafwen tilted her head as she spoke back to her aunt. \"After all, that is the most common remedy for fevers and illness, bed rest.\" she continued. \"Well you shall keep warm in a more proper manner!\" Enid then passed on the bundle of clothing she held, onto Hafwen before pointing off to the door at the other end of the room. \"Go into the wash room, change and make yourself presentable\" she ordered before standing and heading off to potter around the farm house. With a small sigh Hafwen stood, she was grouchy in the mornings on any day, this day was no different, but unfortunately her spirits would not lift and wake as she did, not after her world had changed. It already felt like months since her sister had been taken when it had only been a mere few hours. Hafwen changed painfully slow, her limbs felt heavy and muscles ached as she pulled each layer of clothing on, even near the end of the lengthy change her fingers screamed with effort as she re-laced the bodice at the front of her dress and knotted the bottom of it in a bow. With a hearty sigh she smoothed her hands down the front of the deep burgundy dress, the fabric was thick and the length was long, even the sleeve covered half of her palms, it was a dress to battle the cold in, a dress for warmth. Her fingertips had lost there heat but as Hafwen pressed them to her swollen eye lids she was glad the heat was gone from them, her eyes were still red from the silent tears she had shed threw out the night and her lids were warm, puffy and swollen as a result from that, so the chill of her finger tips soothing them worked in her favour, her warm face also seemed to warm her fingers. With a slow calming breath Hafwen smoothed out her hair, it was now dry and clean, seeming almost weightless and fluffy as it was free from dirt, holding a healthy shine and soft texture and a few odd waves in the length of dark hair from where it had been allowed to dry on it's own accord and slept on while slightly damp. There wasn't much else Hafwen could do for her appearance, her skin had lost it's usual glow and colour, though most of it had returned with the heat in her body, the brighter part of her that made that glow radiant and the colour in her skin even had been washed away with each tear that fell down her cheek. Opening the door back into the main room of the house Hafwen lifted her eyes and jolted at the sight of a tall unknown man, her brown eyes growing wide and doe like as the sharp thoughts of Witch hunters prowling threw the houses struck at her mind first, till her sense came around and she noticed the stance of the man and the look on his face. His stance was tall and proud but he wasn't smug and over bearing about it, he did not push his high stance on everyone to see, it was just there but he was respectful in the way he kept his form of hierarchy to himself, unlike the Witch hunters who would storm in with heads held high, looking down at everything that passed their sights and shoving their authority into everyone's faces, choking people with their fear educed hierarchy. No, the man oozed respect for others and his face showed it, there was no snarl or leering look on his face, he didn't even look down his nose at the floor of the house and the moment Hafwen had opened the door into the main room of the farm house and effectively drew the man's attention to her, she saw from his eyes and already knew from his actions, he was chivalrous. She should have know from the moment he helped her the night before, but she was a pitiful state and she knew that, but even the wary others would have passed her body on by or steered away from her. \"Hafwen! It's good to see some colour in your cheeks!\" Her uncle spoke up as he came in threw the small front door and instantly her eyes dropped to the floor, away from the stranger as she stepped further into the room, the light in the small farmhouse was dark and amber, the light only coming from the blazing fire once the door had been shut, closing off the bright silver light from the white clouded sky outside. \"It is probably just the glow from the fire,\" She spoke quietly, her voice soft and weak as if she hadn't spoken in years, as she stepped closer to the fireplace. Brac looked over to his wife before the turning his eyes to the stranger that had helped her, all wanting to ask how she was but none feeling they could. Her aunt and uncle knew exactly what had happened and why she was as she was, but the stranger did not, he knew nothing of what had happened, and why he found her the way he did and he knew there was more to the story, but he wanted to know how she was, it just wasn't his place to ask. \"How are you feeling dear?\" Brac then asked softly, feeling he should be the one to bring the question too her, shearing more of her pain than the others in the room. \"In terms of my health?\" She raised her eyes to her uncle with the question before lowing them to look at the flames of the fire. \"I'm fine,\" She then mumbled. \"Wen!\" A younger voice broke threw the room as the youngest of her cousins came down the stairs with a thunder of foot steps. \"Are you alright?\" He asked with a childish worry, flinging his arm around her waist. \"I'm fine Evan,\" Her lips curled up in the corners with a fighting smile, a chipper emotion she forced on her face for the sake of the young boy, the tiny placement of her lips seeming out of place and that forced it was at threat to cracking her cheeks like a delicate pottery. \"Evan, I told you to help your brothers with the horses!\" Enid scolded lightly as Hafwen stood back to her full height after having to bend to hug Evan properly. \"I shall make myself useful and head to the stables also my Lady,\" The stranger bowed his head. \"Nonsense Behmen, you and your friends have already done enough!\" Enid chirped motioning to Hafwen who had turned to watch the man the moment he spoke, but as soon as he looked her way she turned her head, embarrassed. \"I insist!\" He tried to counter. \"I can show you to the stables Sir!\" Evan chirped up helpfully with an arm in the air before heading to the door and opening it wide, letting the pale light from out side streak across the floor and Behmen followed with a bow of his head as he excused himself. Hafwen having kept to her self between the shadows and the glow of the fire. \"That man save your life, do not forget to thank him,\" Enid then spoke after a moments silence once the door had been closed. \"Of course I won't!\" Hafwen turned to the older woman with a frown, appalled that she would think her own niece would be so ungrateful. \"I was just saying, you have hardly said a good day to him!\" Enid defended after receiving the sharp tone of the younger woman. \"Well forgive me for not greeting everyone like the sunshine of the village when the light from my world has been ripped away from me!\" Hafwen spat hotly, she hated how her aunt could be so narrow minded at times, when it wasn't a life or death situation then acting proper came above all. With that said Hafwen stormed from her place by the fire and strait out the front door, the pale light outside was assaulting to the eye, the soft dim glow from inside the house quite a contrast to the white clouded sky outside. Once her eyes had blinked away the shock of the assault and her brows relaxed against the sudden glare, Hafwen looked around with a sudden lost expression, where could she go for peace now, usually it was her home, it was always her home. \"Hafwen!\" Brac called, his voice soft and pleading, causing the young woman to turn her head back to the door, spotting her uncle outstretching an arm and waving her back to the house. Hafwen stared at him for a moment before turning her head back and simply taking her steps to where ever they may lead. 000 Behmen stood brushing down a black stallion, the horse was tall and it's muscles where lean, it's coat was short and glossy, very much unlike the horses Felson, Debelzaq and himself had managed to bring together. \"This is no farm horse,\" The knight spoke, running hand over the animal's flanks. \"That horse is from Hafwen's farm,\" Dewey, the middle aged of the boys, stated, looking over from the pile of hay he was shifting. \"We only have two working horses here,\" He then nodded to the large, stocky horses their job were more than likely heavy duty due to their build. \"Where are the other horses from?\" Felson then perked up from where he was leaning on a horse box holding various tack for the working horses. \"There from Hafwen's farm too!\" Evan smiled. \"Hafwen's father used to raise war horses for the city, some times they get a request for a noble steed,\" Howell rolled his eyes, as he moved a saddle to rest in a new place. \"You don't approve of this?\" The younger of the strange men spoke up, having caught the eye roll of the young man. \"It is just a lengthy waste of time, plus these horses aren't going anywhere now so it is just more to feed,\" The elder of the bothers motioned to four other horses tied with in the stable that didn't fit in amongst the other frumpy horses, the three that the men had rode in and the two that belonged on the farm. \"Your horses are more suitable for our life style and farm work then these expensive hides,\" Howell wrinkle his nose as he motioned to the would be war horses or noble horses. \"We'd be happy to trade!\" Felson piped up with a small smile. \"Felson,\" Behmen rose a brow towards his friend. \"What! I'm just saying, our horses are more suited to the farm life style and these horses are more suited to our life style!\" The elder of the strangers motioned from their frumpy, long coated work horses and to the long legged, well bred horses from Hafwen's farm. With a roll of his eyes and shake of his head Behmen looked away from the small group gathered in the stables, running a hand down the stallion's black muzzle before his eyes lifted to the open doors of the stables where he spotted a lone figure in a deep burgundy dress, stride threw the grassy field outside. 000 With a deep shaky breath Hafwen calmed herself as she stood in the same spot she had the night before, this time when she looked upon her house it was a mount of ash and charcoal rather than the flaming abyss. The area was black and odd beams and burnt wall still stood defiantly like a skeleton of the fallen, but those beams only helped to visualise the rooms that were once there more vividly. The odd walls that were still there where a slight reminder of the home and still inviting despite the delicate state, they were unstable. Tears sprung to her eyes once more as she looked down on what used to be her home, the sounds of approaching foot steps behind her causing her to turn with a small frown, expecting to have to tell her uncle or aunty to leave her alone but upon seeing the chivalrous stranger her eyes widened as she took in a sharp, shaky breath, quickly turning away as she wiped her eyes. \"My Lady?\" He questioned as he stepped up next to her, his brown creased in a slight worry as she gave a small cough. \"Hafwen,\" She spoke quietly, giving a nod and another small cough to clear her throat, so she could talk properly, before rubbing her tear damp hands on the skirts of her dress before folding her arms protectively under her bust, her hands clutching at her arms a bit tighter due to the chill. \"I think I gave my name to you the other night,\" She frowned lightly as she thought, her head had hurt and she was awfully disorientated at the time so she couldn't be sure. \"You did, but I didn't give mine so I didn't want to start off on familiarities we don't have,\" He nodded as he explained. \"I'm Behmen,\" He offered a small smile as Hafwen turned her eyes to him and froze at the sight of his out stretched hand. \"Pleased to meet you,\" She delicately and rather sheepishly took his hand and flushed quite brilliantly as her knuckles were raised to his lips in a courteous greeting. \"Like wise,\" Behmen raised to his full height, still holding her hand before placing his other hand on top of her's, capturing it in a lock of warmth. \"I have been meaning to ask how you are?\" He tilted his head lightly, trying to find Hafwen's eyes as they seemed to fall to look else where. \"…I…I am well,\" She nodded after a pause of thought and with a slow nod Behmen decided to leave it at that, if she wanted to speak then she would. \"What happened here?\" He then nodded towards the burnt remains of the farm house. \"…a fire,\" Hafwen stated weakly, her voice dropping down to a whisper as she slid her hand from his and returned to her protective arm cross. feh! proper! who needs to be proper where you were found laying in mud with a dog licking your face to wake you up! :D[Chapter 6] Sooooooooooooooooo ... i have nothing really to say right now... ...but for your enjoyment!...Heres a lovely smiley face! :D 6: Ash \"How did the fire start?\" Behmen's brow was frowned with suspicion, already putting together possibilities of why the woman before him was as she was and why he had found her the way he did. Hafwen lifted her eyes to his and she tried to stay strong, bite back the tears and swallow the lump in her throat but the wound was still fresh and the moment her eyes turned away from his in search of a sight less penetrating than his gaze, did her eyes come back to rest on her destroyed home and that is when the flood gates opened. \"Ruthless men! They came into the village, did what they pleased! They took everything from me,\" Hafwen broke, choking on a few sobs as she tried to calm her self, she was in a state, tears unforgiving now as they spilled carelessly from her eyes, how had she let her self crumble in front of a stranger? Behmen stood silent, there wasn't a lot he could do, the woman had turned her body away from him, her stance protective of her self and unwelcome to any approach of anyone with sympathy, she was trying to hide her tears despite it being as plain as day to see how distraught she was, other's may not have picked up on such stance and body language and probably would have pestered and fussed the poor woman too breaking point, but Behmen knew better than trying to counsel someone he didn't know, it wasn't his place to pry into her problems and offer comfort he couldn't give, there where no familiarities between them after all. Unfortunately for Hafwen's emotional well being and Behmen's avoidance of prying he had asked one question too many and stumbled upon the reason to the woman's torment. \"Lady Hafwen,\" Behmen started softly, wanting to gain the woman's attention. \"I'm fine!\" She instantly chirped with a strained voice and a sniffle, lifting a hand from their tight fold under her bust, once again, to wipe her face dry. \"I shouldn't have pried,\" The knight shook his head. \"You asked one question, I'm just being over sensitive,\" She murmured, clearing her throat with a small cough before taking a deep breath and blinking away the excess moister in her eye. \"It is a sensitive matter,\" Behmen stated. Instead of replying or even acknowledging the man spoke Hafwen descended the small hill, heading towards her burnt home. Her strides started out determined but as the burnt house before her grew larger the closer she got, the strides slowed to faltered steps, her toes scuffing against the ash covered mud as her eyes began to sting with a threat of tears as she looked up at her dead home, the gentle breeze lifted a few flakes of the ash, freeing them in a gliding tumble from the walls of the blackened farm house and kicking them up in a gentle swirl around the floor, moving them as easily as a few strands of Hafwen's straying dark hair. She looked upon the house, something that used to be so warm and welcoming a bad thought was hardly passed threw her mind when ever she saw it, but now she stared at it as if it was a deathly beast released from the devil's arms. With a small frown she looked away, winching at the thought she had for her own home, but when her eyes landed on the small black cat with a white chin, set on the fence post of a now destroyed paddock everything stopped, she still hung by her tail, nailed into the wood. No, them men where beasts released from the devil's arms. A sharp breath released her from her frozen state and instantly she dipped and scooped the skirts of her dress into her arms, much like a young child when trying to play when the annoying length of fabric would restrict movement. She turned quickly on her heels and charged off at a run. Startled, Behmen jolted in a start, stop motion, naturally going to follow her but stopping himself, unsure if he was meant to follow and confused to the sudden action. \"Where are you going?\" He decided on asking instead, turning to watch her storm past. \"To get a shovel!\" Were her shouted words, her voice forced to be strong and after watching her fast pace with raised brows, he decided to brush the confusion away for now and follow after her. She near enough skidded into the barn homing the ruckus of boys and men for the moment, she had swung herself to a stop when she grabbed the large frame of the open barn doors to slow her run and turn her into the building. One hand still held up her dress while her other supported herself on the wooden frame, her body slightly hunched as she drew in ragged breaths, her hair falling over her face as she looked around desperately from where she stood, unaware and uncaring of the sudden silence her presence brought . \"Hafwen?\" Dewey perked, having been the first to recover out of his brothers. She said nothing nor did she look his way, she simply released her hold on her dress and pushed away from the support of the open barn door and near enough dived threw the farm tools till she found a shovel, holding it tightly in both hands and looking over it with a form determination as she stumbled back a step or two out of the clattered pile of work tools she had created. Holding the shovel in her left hand, she strode over to the opposite side of the barn and snatched some left over sacks from the animal feeds before gathering half her skirts of her dress in her right hand rather awkwardly with all the sacks she'd grabbed. The three brothers and two strangers stayed perfectly still and quiet at the back of the barn, just watching with a confused and dumbfounded form of fascination. She then departed as wordlessly as she had arrived, turning back to the open barn door and dashing out, nearly ploughing into Behmen if he hadn't stopped in time. The tall knight paused, once again falling into a small start, stop motion as he instantly started to follow after her but stopped in the confusion as he watched her dart back off towards the burnt remains of the second farm house. He turned his confused frown into the barn, where five equally lost and confused faces stared back, movement only coming back to the brothers as they glanced between each other before dropping what they were doing and darting off to follow. \"Should we…?\" Debelzaq left the question to trail open as he raised his brows and pointed towards the open barn door and obviously in motion to where the woman and now three boys had run off too. Behmen said nothing, his chest merely rose and fell with a deep sigh as he turned and followed. Unsure if that was the answer, the priest looked towards the other knight whom wordlessly gave his arm a some what gentle hit, or rough nudge before standing and following, the priest going also. \"What are you doing?\" Howell called from where he pursued after his older cousin, quickly catching up now she had slowed to a stop at the top of the small shallow hill that lead down to her home. \"You left them!\" She rounded on him with a screech. \"What?\" He held his hands up, in defence as her grip on the shovel started to shake. \"My father is still laying in that house isn't he!\" She scowled, throwing an arm out to point at the burnt reminded of what once was there, the sacks in her hand giving a slight ruffle. \"And Cai! She is still pinned to that damned fence post like some sign of evil, which she is not!\" Her voice broke. \"So did you!\" Howell hollered back, he was a nice lad but very much like his mother he was narrow minded and rather selfish, Hafwen knew this but his words still slapped some shock across her face. \"…I…I went after my sister! …Before it was too late!\" She all but nearly shrieked, surely that had been clear to her family? Her eyes darted to the coming arrival of the strangers, their approach having slowed as they saw the family members talking and with a small frown Hafwen kept her tone lowered. \"…But…mama said to leave it be?\" Evan answered honestly and quietly, his nature sweet and so innocent in his lack of understanding in his youth as he tried to defend his brothers with what they were simply told. Her face softened towards the young boy, but her lips parted to draw in a small breath as if she had been stung. \"Why?\" Hafwen looked lost, turning to the two elder boys who both bowed their heads. \"She…she believes the witch hunters? You all do?\" She questioned in horror, trying desperately to keep from screaming out, but as the three strangers came closer to the family members and ear shot of any talk, Hafwen pinched her lips together and shook her head. \"Go back to your mother!\" She spat, turning on her heels and heading down the small hill while the boys bowed their heads and slunk off. Hafwen's family was not as close as she had once thought. With a scrutinizing gaze Behmen watch the exchange, as did Felson with a more relaxed stance, both his brows raised, even Debelzaq's brow was creased with worry of what had been shared and over what matter. The groups eye's followed the boys as they did as they were told and waiting till they where out of ear shot Felson perked up. \"You know when no one tells you, you're about to walk onto marsh land, then you get stuck in the mud suddenly, and even if you try and get out you can't, you're just trapped or sink deeper… This is going to turn into one of them moments isn't it?\" He asked his two companions with raised brows, looking between them with a few small bobs of his head in agreement to his own words. \"Felson,\" Behmen raised a brow and gave a tried sigh, but the annoyed warning in his tone still managed to come threw, and with that stern yet slightly tired look on his face he turned and descended down the hill. \"Behmen, you don't know when you'll hit the marsh land!\" The elder knight called out the warning with raised brows, before turning to the priest with a sigh and disappointed look, only to frown in confusion at the look of disapproval on the younger man's face before he too descended down the small hill. \"What?\" Felson opened his arms with a slight shrug, following not long after. Loud sniffles and choked coughs where the only sounds that came from the dark haired woman, she cradled the cat in her left arm, holding it's cold body on top of the sack as a form of blanket for the poor animal that had no doubt been petrified and tormented in it's last moments of life and now Hafwen cried and choked back sobs as her whole form shook, trying to bring the dead animal at least some form of comfort to put an end to it's horror and unnecessary shaming and murder. The thoughts where running ramped threw her mind, unwavering and un-resting, and the more she paused to dwell on them awful thoughts, the what's, the how's and the whys?, the more she suffered physically as well as mentally, her mind buzzed with everything her eyes sight blurred with tears and hands shook, everything becoming so much worst, it was upsetting and frustrating…she couldn't pull the nail out. She couldn't even free the poor cat from the fence post. Her brows once knotted in an angry frown at the thought of the men that had caused all the torment soon turned into a more pained frown, all sides of the blunt flat of the nail was digging into her palm from where she was clenching her hand around it so tightly, trying to free it from the wood. Her body was more drained and weaker than she thought and with a small groan she bowed her head with a held back sob that racked her chest and shook her shoulders. When a warmth surrounded her hand she looked up with alarm, her hair flicking around her face with the motion while her wide brown eyes looked up to the tall man stood at her side, his face etched with a pained expression. She wanted to accuse the look of being that of pity, but pity was a look people threw down on others they didn't know well enough over something they didn't quite understand, his look was far deeper, his pained expression held more depth and understanding to what he saw and what she was feeling. Behmen said nothing as he gently pried her hand away from the nail before pulling a small blade from a back sheath on his belt, a knife or dagger like that of a hunter or traveller, a handy thing for when you caught your dinner and had to cook it. He used the blade to lever and wrench the nail out of the wood, part of the area around the nail's point splintering, the whole motion and removal of the nail from the wood was made to look so effortless and easy. The tiny weight of the cat fell fully into her arm now and with a sniffle Hafwen brought her other arm up to cradle her sister's cat as she slowly sunk down onto her knees, lowering the half wrapped pet onto her lap, her head bowing as she gently wrapped the cat up fully in it's make shift blanket, to sleep properly forever, before she set the bundle on the ground in front of her knees and rested her hands in her lap, her head remaining bowed as her chest jolted every now and then with deep gasps threw her other wise silent tears. We are family! ...or was for Hafwen D: ...yeeeeeer... i love writing happy stories... ...ohhhh waaaaait ¬¬ ... i have a bit of an imagination when it comes to writing detail of quite emotional or horrifying things... but i kept it very calm and mellow today ^-^ ...i managed to make one of my friends cry... a few times actually...in this one story i wrote...as well as scared and paranoid XD bad times! But i promise i no makey you cry! or any of the above :D ...unless you want to in which case...go crazy XD ...or...just enjoy the happy face :D[Chapter 7] Back again... sorry long wait... i have so many ideas and just so little time! but yeah! 7: Buried Fresh soil mounded up over the new grave, the earth was soggy causing great clumps of mud to stick together making the swell of dirt even more daunting and seem that bit more weighty, pushing the body far beneath in a still, tight hold. Hafwen stared down at the mound, before tarring her gaze away to the left, peering at the tree line that quickly grew into a dense wood, suddenly feeling a deep depth of nothing, she wasn't sad, nor was she angry, she's let herself slip into a daft recluse of ignorance. It felt better this way, to ignore what was true and live in pretend, but this did no good and it never would, it would turn her into a troubled spinster, forever muttering in her make believe world, before it helped her live again. With a thick swallow she brought her eyes back to the grave, that deep depth of nothing instantly squeezing shut tight with hurt, anger, betrayal, sadness and loss. It was a wakening back to reality from a silly ignorance. \"Hafwen?\" The voice of her aunt questioned delicately, placing a hand on her shoulder, the woman had been stepping very carefully after her sons had returned to the house much earlier in that day, the eldest explosive with a confused anger as he repeated the events and words spoken with his cousin. The elder sister did not reply but she did inch her head lightly to the side to frown at the hand touching her before rolling her shoulder to release her from the contact, she wanted nothing to do with her aunt at the moment in time, even her uncle, Brac, seemed stand offish with his wife having heard her belief on the matter. Debelzaq raised his head to the young woman, his hands clasping at the tattered holy book he kept, having said some words and put the body of Hafwen's father to rest, he did not want to pester her, nor did the two knights that stood off to the side of the broken family. With a soft yet lengthy intake of breath Hafwen raised her eyes to the priest, her face unwilling to crack with the emotions her eyes so easily leaked. \"Thank you,\" She uttered quietly, but the man heard, giving a bob of his head in reply to her softly whispered words before she was off, walking at a slow pace as she passed the older grave to the right of her father's, her eyes captivated by the resting place of her mother, before her pace quickened as she headed for the village. \"Marburg, my dear,\" The stoutly old man spoke as he tinkered with a few jars. \"Are you sure?\" Hafwen frowned, her fingers twisting into the skirts of her dress as she stared at the man of medicine in front of her. He was an old man, firm in his beliefs and not one to take idle gossip and shenanigans of others visiting the village to heart, he was strong minded and wouldn't be swayed into believing anything or have any of his views changed by the talk of the town, but he had been shaken by the crude arrival of the witch hunters. He was a trust worthy man and he had know Hafwen's family before she even came to be. \"They will take the women they have collected to the city to be tested by the priests, rewards will be given for any true witches found and they no doubt will be sent to the monastery for a trial,\" He spoke, still busying himself with his low stock. \"But… innocent women will not survive the tests they carry out to find a witch!\" The dark haired woman instantly started to threat. \"The high priest has seen to changes, the tests are not the same as they once where a few years back\" He pressed, looking over to the young woman before taking a quick glance out the window to check all was clear. \"So what of the innocent women?\" She then whispered as the old man motioned her to hush. \"They will be released,\" He spoke quietly. \"How do you know of all this?\" She then frowned lightly. \"I have heard things,\" he nodded. \"I didn't think you where one to listen to the gossip!\" Hafwen crinkled her nose at the thought. \"There is a difference between hearing and listening dear!\" The elderly man simply stated. \"Right, how long does it take to get to Marburg?\" She then questioned, gnawing at her bottom lip. \"Planning a trip there?\" he rose his brows as he cast a look towards the young woman who in turn said nothing. \"Half a day's ride if you're travelling by cart with a slow pony, like I do,\" he then went on to answer. \"If you have a good horse and maintain a reasonable pace you'll more than likely manage it in a few hours.\" He watched as she nodded to what he was saying before he decided to add some more. \"The witch hunters wouldn't have arrived in the city yet, they spent a good day in our little village and there are three more on the way to Marburg, I have no doubt they would have stopped off, if you set off in the morning and rode strait to the city you will probably arrive before them, if not meet them on the road there,\" The old man corked a stray bottle and set it aside in his idle sounding chat while knowing he was adding fuel to the already burning fire with in Hafwen, helping to build her hope. \"Thank you,\" The elder sister nodded, as she turned to leave but pausing at the door before she looked back at the man, \"And thank you for hearing what has been going on, but not listening to the lies,\" she spoke softly. \"Safe trip Hafwen, I'll stop by to see your father and mother while you are gone,\" He simply answered with a nod, leaving the young woman to excuse herself, closing the door to his little shop behind her with a soft click. She took a deep breath to calm the sudden growth of nerves in her stomach, she felt almost excited that she still had so much hope at getting her little sister back and it seemed so simple in thought. She strode on with purpose next, she needed to prepare and gather what she had, which was very little considering her house had been burnt down and everything along with it, but she needed some form of supplies, that and see needed to see her father's horses safe homes. As she rounded the small Traven of the village, her foot steps slowed as she caught sound of her sisters name being spoken in a hushed tone. Hafwen turned to the voices, etching closer as she came upon two of the young barmaids cleaning up a few flagons left outside. \"Well she did have that black cat,\" The one spoke, \"You where right to voice your concerns,\" \"I didn't think she was a-a… you know!\" The second spoke, tucking away a strand of dirty blonde hair. \"A witch?\" Hafwen decided to offer, her chest awfully tight with sudden wound up rage and both girls instantly shot up with stiff spines, spinning to face the older sister with eyes as wide as a wagon's wheels. Both girls stuttered stupidly in fright, and they had good reason to be fearful, Hafwen was never one to look for confrontation, but today was going to be her first. \"You where supposed to be her friend Arlais!\" Hafwen spoke in a deadly tone to the young blonde, causing her to shrink back as well as the other bar maid. \"I-I only said what I knew,\" She merely peeped in her defence. \"You knew nothing! You stupid, stupid girl!\" The elder sister raged. \"Rhoslyn's cat was not all black you dense, child! Her cat was black and white like any common cat! Now because of your stupid gossiping you have condemned an innocent person!\" Hafwen's voice raised in pitch in a near screech at the end, the blonde Arlais shaking where she stood, clutching onto the other bar maid who was trying so desperately to shy away from the situation. \"I…I didn't know,\" She tried quietly. \"You forever have black crows out side your house! What do you say to that!\" Hafwen then spoke, her brows in a deep scowl but tone brought down to something a bit calmer. \"They… they eat the seeds we plant,\" She then chirped in confusion. \"What if I said you are a witch and are feeding the birds of the devil!\" The elder sister hissed. \"That's not true!\" The blonde maid then frowned. \"No! It's not!\" Hafwen clipped \"Just like it is not true that Rhoslyn is a witch because her cat was mostly black!\" With that said Arlais bowed her head, her bottom lip trembling as she gave a sniffle. \"Don't cry and pity your self! You should feel shameful you opened your mouth to spread gossip you stupid child!\" the elder sister showed no remorse for the younger woman and with her hands clenched dangerously tight she was off, storming back to her uncle's farm house. Hafwen's head burnt and banged with so many more angry things to say, so much more just kept popping up the more she passed villagers who'd promptly stop their whispering at the mere sight of her. With a groan she threw the battered leather saddle back onto the horse box before pressing the heels of her palms to her forehead, hoping to balance out the sudden pressure building in her head. \"Hafwen?\" The voice that spoke was one of the new ones she'd started to recognise, but had to look up to figure out who it belonged to out of the three strangers she had met. \"Yes, sorry Sir, I was just,\" She motioned to the saddle after pulling her hands away from her face, before deciding on just falling quiet. \"Behmen,\" The tall man simply nodded as he stepped closer. \"Sorry?\" Hafwen turned to him, her brows twitching down in a light confusion. \"Call me Behmen,\" He clarified, causing her to look away with a nod. \"Behmen…\" She started, trying the name on her tongue and in the tone of voice that hinted at a question to come. \"Yes?\" He decided to press as the young woman seemed to paused a little too long, and he watched as her gaze seemed to be caught by the lovely group of tall, lean, well bred horses tethered in the large open stall. \"Can I ask you something?\" She turned her attention back to him, and to her question he simply nodded. \"How are your horses?\" She questioned with a tilt of her head. The knight was not taken back by the question, more confused by it as he passed a glance over to the short, stocky animals Debelzaq, Felson and himself had rode in. \"They are more suited for the farm,\" Hafwen spoke up as she glanced towards the horses in question, slowly glancing back to the tall man in hopes she hadn't offended. \"You are right, they are, but they where all we could find,\" He bobbed his head in a nod with his agreement. \"Perhaps, you'd like to trade?\" Her voice was soft, hopeful and so quiet. He looked towards her with a raise of a single brow, she was biting at her bottom lip, her eyes flicking from trying to keep eye contact with him, occasionally breaking to glance at random places and items around the barn, seeming almost as if her request was ridiculous and cheeky. \"Excuse me?\" He frowned a little, wanting her to clarify to ensure he had heard right. \"Well, you could do with some better horses, your old horses would be more use on the farm, and it would really be doing me a favour if you took my father's,\" She explained, walking a few steps backwards towards her father's well bred horses, before half turning so she could motion to them. When she didn't get a reply as soon as she would have liked, she started to wring her fingers together, gnawing at her bottom lip before she tried to explain her reasoning's. \"I…I don't really trust my family as much as I did,\" She started, not wanting to get too in-depth on what had happened. \"So…I don't want to leave them here, plus I have to thank you in some way for what you did for me!\" she then motioned towards him, her brows raising. \"Do you need good horses?\" She questioned, again in that small hopeful voice. \"Yes, have you seen the farm animals we've had to ride!\" The strong, deep voice of Felson sounded as he strode in the barn, stopping next to Behmen and setting his hands on his hips while leaning his weight more onto the one leg. \"What you offering Lady?\" he asked curtly with a nod causing Hafwen to straiten up and quickly untie one of the tall horses while Behmen shot his old friend a frown. \"What?\" Felson opened his arms with a shrug at the other knight before facing forwards as Hafwen brought forwards a dark brown mare, her legs where long and slim, muscles flexing beautifully in her eager, energetic walk. \"Ah, there's a beaut!\" He grinned, reaching a hand out to meet the nose of the mare, running his hand up the white blaze on her face before taking the lead rope Hafwen offered out to him. \"I'm asking you swap horses, take my father's and see them a good fair life,\" The elder sister looked to Felson as he guided the horses head up and ran a hand down it's strong neck. She then turned her attention back to Behmen. \"Please,\" she tilted her head lightly before motioning to walk to the horses with her. \"They are good horses! They really are!\" She spoke heading towards the black stallion and bringing the large steed round to face the knight, watching as he brought a hand up to smooth the beautiful horse. \"I trust my uncle, I know he wouldn't want to sell them, but they can't be left to stand in a barn,\" She shook her head lightly \"and I know they wont work hard to look after them, and if they did sell them on, it would be to anyone, I want them to be with good people, that know how to look after them,\" she finished quietly. \"How do you know if we are the right people?\" Behmen decided to challenge, rubbing the stallion's muzzle as he dipped his large head towards him. \"I can see he appreciates the beauty of a horse,\" She gave a ghost of a smile as she motioned over to Felson, causing Behmen to look back on his friend who was smoothing his hand down the back of the mare, feeling the strong muscles before he then checked the animals hooves, and with a small smile he turned back to the black stallion in front of him, sweeping some of it's glorious black forelock out of its face. \"You both do,\" she added quietly, catching the knights attention as he looked towards her, finding she had been watching him. \"I think you'll be good for these horses,\" she added, holding the read rope out for him to take. With a nod Behmen lifted his hand and took the rope offered to him and instantly Hafwen released the lead rope and took a step back. \"Thank you,\" she nodded before turning to the three remaining horses from her father's collection. \"Your other friend may have our chestnut mare!\" She then declared, pointing to the horse stood next to two grey mares. With a nod Behmen glanced over at the horse before questioning the other two. \"What of the grey horses?\" he rose a brow. \"They come with me when I pick up my sister,\" Hafwen spoke as she walked around the knight and his new horse, giving the chestnut mare a fuss before moving to the two greys, smoothing her hand down the face of the lighter coloured of the two. \"This is Cloud,\" she smiled fondly as the light grey horse leaned into her touch, \"My sister's horse, and then there is Avon,\" She ducked under Cloud's neck to come to stand next to the darker grey mare, \"She's my horse, we weren't supposed to name them, but we fell in love with them and our father let us keep them,\" she smoothed the mares dark grey muzzle lovingly. \"The other three haven't been named, that's your choosing now,\" she nodded, looking up to the knight who had been watching her with interest. \"What?\" she frowned lightly. Behmen looked back at Felson before turning the black stallion and tying him back up before he walked slowly round to the other side of Hafwen's horse, lifting a hand and stroking the animal's neck. \"I know your not telling me everything,\" He stated, his eyes taking in the mixture of grey, white and black hairs mottling together on the horses neck, making up the dappled grey colour. Instantly Hafwen bit her lip and looked down. \"Well, you haven't even asked about anything, most would badger and pester till they got every detail they wanted,\" she mumbled, twirling her finger into the wiry hair on the horse main. \"It's not my place, I have no right to pry,\" Behmen looked across at the young woman, who nodded at his words and looked down. \"Makes a nice change,\" she uttered to herself. \"Small villages are filled with some small minded people that make it their business to know everyone else's business,\" he started, pausing as he waited for her to raise her eyes back to him and when she did he continued. \"I'm not going to press something you don't want to share,\" he shook his head lightly. \"Thank you,\" she nodded, again that weak, ghost of a smile lifting at the corners of her lips. \"This horse is beautiful!\" Felson called, now sat atop the brown mare, walking her around the open area of the barn bare back. \"Take the horses as a thank you for helping me when you didn't have to and give them a good life,\" Hafwen nodded lightly. \"We will,\" Behmen agreed with a firm nod before watching the young woman wander off, out the barn. And yeah... i find this one was more of a scene filler... coz i hate to just skip frame with out actually explaining how they got there and why this, that and the other has happened... etc etc etc.[Chapter 8] Don't mind me while i just sheepishly creep in... O_O long time... sorry... 8: Wandering A deep frown was etched onto Hafwen's brow as she sat at her uncle's table, not hearing nor listening to what her aunty was screaming at her. Of course it was now down to Hafwen to bring more shame onto the family and cause them to become outcast if she did leave to look for her sister, these where the thoughts of Enid. \"Enough! You have no say over what I do!\" Hafwen bellowed with a sudden strength, causing the older woman to near bite her tongue she closed her mouth so fast. \"I bring no shame here, neither does Rhoslyn! You bring shame onto your self! Believing the petty whispers!\" The elder sister was now on her feet, back in her right frame of mind, defences up and hackles raised. The elder woman had no more she could possibly say and excused herself from the room, scowling at her husband as she barrelled past. Two sets of sighs sounded from both Hafwen and her uncle as they each slumped down into opposite chairs on the table. \"I was hoping she wouldn't find out till morning, save the hassle,\" Brac huffed tiredly before setting the bundle he held on the table. \"Here, spare change of clothes, enough for you for a few days and obviously for Rhoslyn, a few blankets…just encase you need them, you've already got some food sorted and here is some money,\" her uncle placed a little leather coin purse on top of the pile as Hafwen paused what she was doing, wrapping up some bread. \"Uncle, I don't want your money,\" She sighed quietly. \"Take it as payment,\" He shrugged. \"For what?\" the young woman rolled her eyes. \"Well you swapped your horses from them little stocky numbers! I'll buy them off you and put them to good use!\" he gave a weak grin to which Hafwen sighed and nodded softly. \"Thank you uncle,\" she whispered, before continuing to pack what she needed, or what she thought she needed. After a short silence there was a knock on the door to which Brac answered only to wave the three men in. \"What you knock for?\" he frowned as the men found their way in. \"I think my wife will have your things ready for you tomorrow so you wont have to suffer this mad farm house much longer,\" Brac smiled \"I'll let you all go rest up, it's been a long day and I thank you for all your help,\" he nodded, ushering the men off whether they wanted to go or not. \"I'll leave you too it,\" The older man then nodded \"Oh! And this is another 'just encase'\" he smiled, taking a small sheath homing a little knife and setting it onto the pile. \"Thank you, good night uncle,\" She gave a small smile, both of them knowing she was planning on slipping off early. \"Why would you let her go!\" Enid was furious, she worried of course, but she worried for all the wrong reasons. \"Enid, just let it go, I can't stop her she is a grown woman,\" Brac frowned, massaging his temples before he eagerly stood and took the clean pile of clothes belonging to the strangers, excusing himself to take them to the men. The two knights and priest where clearing the room they had occupied, Felson helping out a little less until the soft knock came at the door to which he addressed, opening it wide as the young lady's uncle stepped in. \"Here are your things gents!\" He smiled, handing the pile over to the elder knight before looking around the room \"Ah, you didn't have to clear up! We would have been fine doing it! There isn't much to do round the farm today anyway!\" He continued. \"We couldn't just leave it after the hospitality you have shown us,\" Debelzaq bowed his head in gratitude. \"Well, you did save my niece and bring her home to us,\" Brac smiled. \"It's the least we can do,\" \"Where'd she ride off too in the early hours?\" Felson spoke up, once again earning a few varied looks, his old friend gave him a simple frown and shake of his head while the younger priest gawped slightly. \"Ah, Hafwen is just… trying to fix things,\" Brac looked down with a sad smile \"Like she always does,\" he then added quietly before he took a deep refreshing breath and looked back up to the men. \"Breakfast will be ready shortly, come down when your ready!\" he then nodded before excusing himself from the room. Behmen sighed as he looked away from the expectant dog, having ordered the animal back to the farm countless times before it became too late for the animal to find it's way back, but he was persistent in following the trio. \"I was almost worried you'd stay too long,\" Felson spoke out, having cast a raised brow look to his close friend and his new companion, before facing the road ahead and sitting much more comfortably upon his new horse. \"Get involved,\" he continued, to which Behmen said nothing, just simply rolled his eyes. \"It didn't seem right,\" Debelzaq frowned, adjusting himself on the tall horse before facing forwards again. \"Nothing with that place was right,\" Felson shrugged. \"The family obviously didn't want to talk about it for what ever reasons and the girl…\" the elder knight left open with a shrug, \"Even the dog didn't want to stay!\" He spoke with an ironic laugh as he motioned to the canine. \"It was not our place to pry,\" Behmen spoke up. \"I would have liked to thank her for the horse,\" Debelzaq shook his head, looking down at the beautiful horse he rode. \"Lets just get to the city,\" the elder knight huffed, \"We have enough of our own problems,\" he then kicked his new horse into a faster pace leaving Behmen and Debelzaq to share a short look before they too sped their horses' pace up, the woman's dog yapping out an excited bark and dashing after them. Hafwen sat atop her dappled grey mare, one hand clutching to the very end of the reins as well as the horn of the saddle to help solidify her position on the horse as she concentrated on keeping on balance, her other hand held onto the lengthy rope used to lead the lighter grey mare, having ridden very few times she teetered between rocking in motion with the animal's movements and slipping either side of the horse causing her to stiffen and jolt the opposite way to counteract the sharp movement which would cause the horse she rode to stop abruptly, almost knowingly, sensing the loss of balance and preventing a fall. Having managed to stay in a trot for a few paces, the dark haired woman concentrated intensely, going purely on what she had learnt threw observation alone, only to miss judge a stride and fall out of sync with the mare, her back end bumping off the saddle with a force that sent her more to one side and flick out her arm leading the second horse, the motion causing a wave in the rope which startled the light mare while the one she rode slowed so rapidly before stopping it caused Hafwen to lurch forwards in the saddle. \"Oh, Thank you Avon, but we have to keep pace,\" She huffed in frustration, but patted the horse's neck non the less, it wasn't the animal's fault she couldn't ride. \"With a father that reared horses you'd think I'd know how to ride,\" she shook her head as she looked back to the second horse, \"Bare with me Cloud,\" she whispered, having been flicking the lead rope into the poor horse's face so many times its a wonder the mare hadn't just torn away and stood in protest. With a deep cleansing breath she looked to the road ahead and exhaled, shifting herself in the saddle and nudging Avon back into a walk as she uttered, \"I'll get there by night fall at this point,\" Despite the on off riding style the elder sister had made it to Marburg before nightfall unlike she had once thought, but it was a fair few hours longer than the trek should have taken, if she hadn't left so early that morning then it would no doubt be well into the night when she would have arrived. The city was still lively in the late evening and she was positive at mid day the place would be near impossible to move around, especially with two horses. She scouted the area from atop her tall mare with a sudden loss on what to do now, she hadn't thought in much detail when coming to the city, just get there, get her sister and go, it was only now she realised she should have done much more planning ahead of arrival as she mulled over what she needed to do. She knew she couldn't muscle her way threw the streets with two horses just aimlessly wandering and it was slowly nearing night, the animals and herself need proper food and rest, she would have to find housing for them all. \"Excuse me!\" She called softly to the nearest person she spotted only to be ignored, \"Um, excuse me?\" she called to another only for them to also walk strait by, \"What am I? A ghost?\" she scoffed at the rudeness before taking another look around, this time choosing carefully who she'd asked next, moving her horse into a slow walk further into the city, in hopes that if no one helped then she would come across a stables or inn herself. She sighed softly as she moved slowly threw the streets, almost zoning out before an elder woman fell into her path with a scream, causing her horse to whip it's head up with a protesting whine as she stopped. \"Oh my goodness!\" Hafwen chirped in surprise before leaning forwards in the saddle and shaking her feet out of the stirrups, swinging a stiff leg over the dapped grey horse's back and sliding less than gracefully from the saddle, landing unsteadily before throwing Cloud's lead rope over Avon's saddle and stumbling to the old woman. \"Are you alright?\" She gasped, helping the woman to sit up and dusting some dirt from her shaking arms before looking around as no one else came to the woman's aid, it was in this glance she caught the look of a tall man, his face hidden with a tick growth of facial hair. \"Don't bother with her girl!\" He spat, raising his head as he looked down at the old woman with a sneer, \"She'll curse you the moment she sees fit,\" \"Oh, don't be ridiculous!\" Hafwen scoffed, turning back to the elder woman and helping her to her feet. \"You're obviously not from around here,\" He scowled, \"Everyone here knows what she is!\" He barked with a vicious point to the greying old woman, who did nothing but bow her head and bend slowly with effort to pick a straying potato from the ground before shuffling over to another. \"Di-did you push her?\" she then questioned with disbelief and a disgusted frown. \"Witch,\" the man then hissed before striding off. \"What a…\" Hafwen shook her head, unable to finish off what she wanted to say about the man and instead turned to help the old woman pick up her scattered vegetables. \"Here you go,\" She gave a small smile as she held them out to the woman, who took them slowly, her face sceptic towards the younger woman's help, but she accepted her items back regardless, gathering them in the tattered apron protecting the front of her skirt. \"Are you alright?\" The younger woman questioned with worry, but the old woman did nothing more than nod, quite obvious in her wary suspicious of the younger, \"Um, do you know where the nearest inn or stables are?\" She called in desperate hope, as the woman started to shuffle off, but luckily she did turn, eyes narrowed in distrust as she took in Hafwen's hopeful and tired face, slowly coming to a judgement on the young woman and changing her hold on her apron so her vegetables didn't drop to the floor once more and point off down a street to Hafwen's right. With a quick glance in the direction showed the elder sister then nodded her head towards the old woman with a tired smile, \"Thank you,\" She then turned to gather both horses, who'd luckily not even strayed a step and lead them down the road directed. She didn't have the strength nor energy to pull herself back up into the saddle, even walking with the tall mares was hard enough with her aching legs but she pressed on for a short time before coming up to the rowdy sounding inn, pausing at the open stable doors and peering in, seeing the back end of various coloured horses. \"Can I help ya lil miss?\" A wrinkled man sniffled, his dark hair streaked with much grey and face unshaven in appearance with a short growth of facial hair, leaning on a pitch fork and hoisting his dirtied trousers higher with one hand. \"Yes, I was wondering if there was any room for two horses?\" She asked hopefully with a small smile. \"Can always make room, should ye be payin'!\" He nodded towards her. \"Of course!\" She nodded, suddenly very thankful her uncle had given her the money. \"Well come 'ere then miss, lets see 'em housed then we'll get ye sorted,\" He waved her in. With a sigh Hafwen ran the brush down Avon's speckled back one last time before returning the grooming item to it's box and gave both horses a quick smooth with her hand. \"Surprised ya chose this place over the others!\" The stable man spoke up as she gathered her belongings. \"Well, I don't really know this city and this was the first place I came across,\" She spoke timidly and gave a small shrug. \"Ain't gonna be fussy ay?\" He nodded in understanding, \"Well I ain't gonna complain, we need the trade,\" He then held an arm out to her \"Come, we'll make the wife find ye a room!\" \"Thank you,\" Hafwen nodded as she hoisted her bag over her shoulder and hugged the rolls of blankets before she stepped towards the man, allowing herself to be stiffly lead into the bustling inn. The room she was lead into was small with a low ceiling and near packed with rowdy drinkers cluttering every corner and taking up every bit of room they could, laughing loudly and drinking in excess. \"I thought you said you needed the trade?\" Hafwen shouted over the noise, cringing at some of the sights and gawping at others. \"We do! It ain't always like this and these men are just 'ere to drink us blooming dry!\" He called back. \"So long as they pay for what they drink I don't care if they do!\" A strong, female voice sounded, catching Hafwen's attention as she turned to face a short but overly curvaceous woman closing the gap between them. \"Petal! I 'ave a young guest 'ere for ya!\" The scruffy man grinned. \"I see that, get ya self back to them stables!\" She shooed him off while Hafwen shrivelled away from a large drunken man that had bumped into her. \"Oi! Shove off!\" The plump woman bellowed, battering the man away with a damp cloth before steering the young woman out of the busy room so fast it nearly made her dizzy. The short woman closed a thick, worn and chipped wooden door behind them both as they clustered in the narrow hall, the ruckus from the tavern on the other side being muffled slightly by the barrier. \"Well then!\" The woman turned, dusting off her hands before setting them on her wide hips, \"What's a pretty lil lass like ye doing 'ere all alone?\" the woman questioned with a raised brow, \"It ain't safe ya know, not with a face like yours!\" She nodded towards her before shooing her to the side so she could pass and start leading the way up the uneven stairs. \"This way young miss!\" \"What do you mean?\" Hafwen questioned as she followed after the bodacious woman, each of their foot steps making different creaks on each of the wooden stairs. \"The days of chivalry and gentlemen are gone me love,\" the woman shook her head in her talk but didn't look back, \"Ye keep yer head down and give no man a reason to look yer way, I've seen young, naïve girls like ye come into this city from their little villages, the men set upon them like dogs!\" the woman warned, coming to the top of the stair case and turning to pass her a knowing yet warning look.. \"It is that dangerous?\" Hafwen whispered, eye's wide and throat tightening. \"Take it from me, ye should have stayed in ye little village, I wish I had!\" she shook her head, \"Why is it yer 'ere? Its strange to see such a small town girl alone in such a big place,\" The lady shook her head, a few strands of her tightly curled hair falling from it's practical up do and around her work worn, clammy face. \"I needed too,\" Hafwen coughed lightly as she quickly mulled over her words, \"Too pick something up,\" She nodded, \"I shouldn't be staying long once I have everything sorted,\" She then lifted one shoulder in a slight shrug while the plump woman looked at her with a narrowed eye before taking what she said as truth. \"Well ain't my business either way!\" She shrugged before continuing down the corridor and stopping outside one of the doors on the left, \"Just a shame ye picked a sensitive time to come in to the city,\" she shook her head as she fumbled with a few keys on a large thick ring she had hidden in the folds of her skirts. \"A sensitive time?\" Hafwen questioned with a raised brow, hoping to get as much knowledge as she could if it would help her chances of survival in the city that sounded so far horrifying. \"Hmm, it is coming to Witch season,\" the woman stated brazenly, obviously not having a care for what she spoke of unlike what some would have, \"People get awfully suspicious and nasty,\" she shook her head as she slipped a key off the large ring, \"They are like it to anyone and everyone,\" She rose her brows as she looked back to the younger woman, \"and yer a mysterious stranger, so don't go gettin' noticed by anyone ye don't wanna be, and defiantly don't make ye self any enemies… or friends for that matter,\" She then turned to the door and started to unlock it, \"Ye'd be blamed a Witch quicker than ye could jump away from a dog tryin' to piss on ye leg if yer spotted around the wrong people,\" she then stepped into the room and held the door open for Hafwen to then step in. \"It's really like that?\" she questioned in a disgusted wonderment. \"It is, ye just keep yer head down regardless coz if yer ain't branded a witch for what ever god forsaken and ridiculous reason, there are men in this city that would do unspeakable things to ye,\" she then pressed the younger woman with a stern look as Hafwen's mouth dried and chest became horribly tight. \"I don't mean to scare ye lil miss,\" The woman then fixed a softer look on her face as she noticed the wide eyed and almost shaking youth suddenly resembled a petrified rabbit. \"It's just, I rather you knew what was out their, I'm surprised you lasted the journey here with out so much as a problem, you must have an Angel watching over you,\" the plump lady then held the key out to the elder sister who had to uncurl her fingers from the vice like grip she had on the blanket rolls in order to except it. \"Thank you,\" She breathed, trying to process everything she had been told. \"Not a problem lil miss, ye lock the door now, answer it for no one and sleep light!\" She warned before closing the wooden door behind herself as she left, leaving Hafwen to slowly rake in shaky breaths before she snapped into action, dropped her items and flung herself at the door in order to do as she was told, lock it! i am ashamed...buuuuuut... we are getting some where... well Hafwen isn't, she's rubbish at planning...but we are![Chapter 9] Ok... so i have got the ball rolling... i think... 9: Found Hafwen rarely had a bad night's sleep but as of recent she came to realise that had changed. Now she was kept awake by her own frantic thoughts and worries that furiously whirled around her mind and when her body did find rest her mind still didn't, haunted by faces and recent events in her short bouts of sleep. Her body jolted as if she'd just been startled, but she lay curled tightly beneath the blankets she'd brought on her short travel, her eyes slowly opening as she sucked in a slow, deep breath before releasing it shakily. Her eyes moved slowly around the small room as she lay still, just listening to what she could hear beyond the walls of the room she occupied, her gazing coming to a stop on the wooden shutters where small streams of light filtered threw the splintered wood. With a rustle of sheets Hafwen pushed herself half out of the bed, sitting on one hip and holding her self up on her left arm as she moved the blankets off herself and swung her legs off the bed and sat properly, her eyes never leaving the streams of light flowing into the dark room. The floor boards creaked as she stood and slowly stepped towards the window, she was captivated by the brightness fighting it's way threw such a thick barrier and taking on the darkness hidden behind, effortlessly and beautifully, even the specks of dust that wandered into the steams of light seem to glint, something seen as dirty and it was dancing in the light becoming almost pretty. Silently she lifted a hand, her pale skin seeming grey in the shadows of the room but instantly blossoming to a golden glow the moment the stream of light touched her and she took the simple sight in, turning her hand over and curling her fingers as if she could hold the bar of light before a growing ruckus from out side caught her attention. Flipping the small latch away from the shutters she then pushed one open slowly till she could see the street out front. People stood in groups some yelled, some cried the others pointed fingers and the rest just idly watched, as did Hafwen, stood with a shoulder to the closed half of the window, side stepping the flood of morning light that had made her eyes squint. She watched the obvious dispute unable to piece together what it was about as the various voices, raised and some just seemed to merge into one continuous, dull roar. It wasn't until an old woman was brought forwards and shoved before the crowd, instantly causing them to spread into a wide circle, rather than their cluster of gangs and silence for a moment. In this short time the elderly woman looked up from where she had been thrown down onto her hands and her knees, peering at the awaiting crowd before her aged eyes turned to the inn, scaling the mottled wall of wood and stone before resting on the window with one shutter open, showing nothing more than the shadow of the room Hafwen occupied. \"This woman has been accused of Witch craft!\" a loud voice bellowed, commanding the attention of all as he strode into centre view, circling the quivering old woman with a sneer on his haggled face, his bald head an odd contrast to all the hair on his face. Lifting a hand to her lips Hafwen could barely gasp as she once again lay eyes on the Witch hunter, stood in the streets below addressing his audience with wide open arms like he was a friendly man. \"And this man here,\" He turned his back on the inn and motioned to a tall man stood to his left, turning all eyes towards the dark haired, thickly bearded man, \"Reports that this Witch, sent one of her kin to this very Inn!\" the Witch hunter then jabbed a finger to the building behind him but Hafwen was still staring at the tall dark haired, thick bearded man, she was pretty sure she had seen him before. \"What utter lies, I'll 'ave none of this ya 'ere!\" A feminine voice screeched, catching Hafwen's attention as she looked away from the man and stepped closer to the window in order to see the woman that had spoken only for her to march forwards in challenge regardless, her skirts fisted into her hands and hair a forever dishevelled mess from a never ending amount of hard work, it was the owner whose name she never received. Hafwen frowned lightly as she watched the burly man lean toward the short, curvaceous woman, engaging her in a quiet discussion that grew from silent whispers to hissed words. \"Yer not goin' in and ye don't scare me! I've seen sturdier horse shit that ye!\" the woman then yelled into the Witch hunter's face. \"Men!\" the bald man then bellowed, alerting his thuggish group, \"This woman is conspiring to hide a Witch!\" He gripped the feisty woman who instantly put up a fight with less than lady like words, \"Restrain her and search every corner of every room! Find who she is hiding!\" He ordered and instantly Hafwen was scuttling around the small room in terror, scrambling for her few possessions, her travel bag and the blankets she had brought up with her as well as her cloak, piling them in her arms and dashing for the door. She was lucky enough to sleep fully clothed, boots and all, giving her no need to linger any longer as she furiously turned the key she had left in the lock and swung the door open. She stumbled into the small hall way, tripping over the skirts of her own dress and the length of the blankets that where slipping from her grip, but she grappled with them and clawed them into a tighter bundle till, her bag buried in the middle of them and hugged them tight to her chest as she ran drown the hall, opposite to the way she had first come in and cleverly from all the noise and commotion in the bar, that was till she rounded a corner in the hall and found herself at a dead end. The first floor of the traven was much smaller than the ground floor, which no doubt came from joining the stables to the original house, but the smaller area gave her no place to run or hide, leaving the young woman to fluster in pure panic as she spun to face the hall she had just bundled down as loud thumping came from the various sets of heavy footed men stomping up the stairs, soon they would make their way threw each room, down the first hall, turn the corner and find her, shaking wide eyed in the corner. \"Come on Hafwen,\" She hissed to herself in panic, her heart drumming in her chest as she looked around before the open door to the room on her left caught her attention, the window across the room almost calling her. With out any other option she took it, scampering across the room and peering out the open window, noticing with a happy sigh that not more than three feet beneath the window was the sloped roof a possible store room than ran the length of the original building, no doubt at the back of the bar. With out much of a thought or option she hurled the bundle in her arms out the window, watching as it thumped on to the slate roof before rolling off into the small alley at the back and with not even a second thought she was hoisting herself out the window after her belongings, sitting her self on the window ledge and hopping down on to the slate roof, landing shakily in a crouch, but her weight brought a tile loose and with that simple loose tile all balance and right footing vanished as she scrambled to stay where she was shortly before slipping off the store house roof with a short, chirped shriek, landing feet, bottom then back in the muddy alley. Blinking her eyes open wide in astonishment Hafwen peered at the sky from the tight enclosure of the alley before forcing herself to sit up with a groan and wince on her face but as her adrenaline dulled it seemed more sound of the destroying men came from the rooms above, forcing her to re-scramble to pick up all her stuff, choose a direction to head in and run. With a deep ragged breath, Hafwen placed a hand to her chest to try and calm herself, having reached the end of the ally in some impressive time thanks to her leggy sprint, and now she took a pause to regain some breath before she drew stares for panting like a dog. Taking one last deep breath she swung her cloak on and bent to tidy her things, slinging her bag over a shoulder and head so it sat at her back with the strap across her chest before gathering her two blankets in a somewhat tidy folded pile and stepped out onto the main street. Hafwen followed the crowd for a short while, a bit disorientated on what direction she was heading till she found herself strolling up a familiar street and coming to the front of the very tavern she'd just ran from like a mad woman. Instantly she stopped much to the begrudging grunts and complaint of those that bumped into her and shoved her on a few extra steps and soon she had unwillingly joined the crowd out side the inn all watching the Witch hunter and his men, listening to his words and following his lead. \"I shall take this evil woman from your streets, you will all sleep easy tonight!\" The broad man bellowed, opening his arms as he took in the appreciation of the crowd all while Hafwen scowled at him, wondering if the people of her village, the people she knew, had all cheered like this when he dragged her sister off with no doubt the same nonsense. Her scowl was soon replaced with a flash of panic as he turned her way and instantly she bowed her head, waiting a short moment before peaking back up only to catch a glimpse of the man's gaze in a passing chance and with that her blood froze and she instantly crouched, yanking her hood up over her head and staying bend over, hiding behind the backs of random people in the crowed all while the Witch hunter's gaze was brought back in a double take, his expressing changing to something a little unreadable apart from seeming startled some what, not the Hafwen noticed, she was ducking her way under peoples arms like a little hunched old lady. When she arrived at the back of the crowd she stood up strait and peeked back carefully, now a safe distance only for her jaw to drop as she spotted one of the hunter's lead out her two horses. \"Oh, you better put them right back!\" she uttered to her self with a scowl only for the look to be replaced with that of utter shock as more of the men also came out with the rest of her stuff like they where theirs to take. All she had on her person now was her two blankets, and her bag holding next to nothing but the coin purse and small knife, the rest was in the stall with the horses, both clothes for her sister and her self, food and water, not to mention the horses' tack. With a light frown on his face and hidden beneath his hood, Behmen watched the proceedings of the Witch trials along side Felson and Debelzaq, the tests where different, someone had defiantly seen to change and a fair change at that, the innocent accused of Witch craft would be able to go on to live their lives, had old traditions stuck, the only way their name would be cleared of Witch craft was if they had died during the tests. \"Not very good Witch hunters,\" Felson commented in boredom, looking instead to scan the crowd for perhaps something more interesting. \"Just picking anyone the finger is pointed at,\" he huffed, looking around the intrigued faces before frowning as a face seemed to stick out of the crowd for just a second. Hafwen slipped passed people as she tried to get closer to the witch hunter's wagon, peering out from under her hood with cautious eyes, afraid that someone would recognise her and pick her out or realise what it was she was trying to do and stop her. One by one, the few women that had been uprooted from their homes, were dragged from the caged wagon and pushed before a group of robed men to be trialled, those who passed where released with no form of apology and no way of getting back to their homes apart from their own two feet while the few that did not pass, where dragged in chains, to be throw into cells, their fates to be decided when they next saw fit. Hafwen had not seen her younger sister yet and held hope she was still in the carriage that she had slunk up to, the crowed to captivated by the trials before them to give her much care. \"Rhoslyn?,\" the dark haired woman called in a hushed tone, peering through the grid cage, \"Rhoslyn!\" she called a little harsher, the panic scratching in her voice as she looked threw the few faces left as they turned to take her in, \"Have you seen her? A little shorter than me, pale, freckles and light brown hair?\" she waved a hand in front of her face through out the quick description, staring up at the women of various ages as they simply stared down at her. \"A simple yes or no would do!\" Hafwen then hissed, her growing panic causing her to become easily irate as she frowned at the woman before looking away from them with a scoff, only turning back as a short shout caught her ears, causing her to turn back to the wagon and squint threw a slim gab between the cluster of woman only to spot her younger sister. \"Rhoslyn,\" The elder sister breathed, eye's wide and mouth becoming dry just about to take her first step into movement. \"Oi! Girl, get away from there!\" a rough voice called, snapping Hafwen's attention towards the man who only squinted in slow recognition , \"You're the sister!\" he scoffed in astonishment, only to yelp as a thick wool blanket hit him in the face, covering him like a black out net as he gave a struggled yelp, fighting and grappling with the item till he ripped it from his head only to find, once he could see, the elder sister had gone. The dark haired woman, pushed threw the line of spectators till she broke away from the crowed, stumbling a step or two as she looked around, her eye's spotting a few of the hunters as they instantly bristled, before her eyes landed on the burly leader and his found hers. His speech faltered a moment as he saw the older sibling before a sneer returned to his face as he jabbed a finger towards the younger sister, kneeling before the robed men. \"This Witch,\" he re started. \"She is no Witch!\" Hafwen screeched, her palms clammy and shaking fiercely no matter how hard she clenched her fists, one hand holding her remaining blanket while the other sat free at her side. A slow murmur fell over the crowd as they started to whisper to their closest neighbour watching as the cloaked woman strode closer to the man and her sister, who could do nothing but stare in shock and cry in relief. \"You branded her such for no good reason!\" she screamed at the man before her, bringing her free hand up to jab an accusing finger at him. \"I have reason!\" his deep voice bellowed back, as he strode a few paces and caught the woman harshly by her upper arms and roughly shoved her a good couple of paces back, the force caused her to teeter off balance and fall, her back end then back hitting the rough cobbled ground as she stiffened and curled her spine and neck to prevent her head from also banging against the stone, even the bag she wore across her back could do nothing to soften the fall, having next to nothing in it. She gasped a moment in shock, a little winded from the blow, before pushing herself back to sit up, her hood fallen from her head, blanket scattered at her side and the strap of her bag hanging off her shoulder. \"This Witch!\" the burly Witch hunter pointed to Rhoslyn, \"Has even bewitch her own sister, to ensure her release! She poisoned her own father with a curse!\" He stretched his arms and spoke to the people gathered, while Hafwen scrambled to her feet, her bag falling awkwardly down her body, no longer held up by her shoulder and barely made a sound as it hit the ground. \"That's not true!\" Hafwen's voice shot out, her dark hair a mess as she brushed it from her face. \"Oh boy,\" Felson uttered, arms crossed and simply watching as the cloaked woman's face was reviled properly as she stood back up, before turning to take in his two companions. Debelzaq openly gawped, wanting desperately to say something but finding he didn't have the words and Behmen, he was unreadable. \"You just had to help the one woman that came with the most trouble,\" he scoffed, waiting for his friend to either turn his way or speak, just show some form of reaction. \"Behmen,\" the older knight then spoke slowly in a warning tone, ignoring the growing whines of the tag along dog as it paced in front of them and itched to move, only to perk his ears at the sound of a scream and lurch threw the crowd with a flurry of aggressive barks. Hafwen struggled against the man that had grabbed her, kicking at another that came to help restrain her, before a black dog lurched at the other man, clamping onto his ankle with a deep, rumbling growl, the front of it's body lowered to the ground and back end in the air, as it's body jolted with it's vicious tugging at the man's flesh, while he screamed in pain. \"Gaius!\" Hafwen, gasped in shock, recognising the canine instantly but the thought of how he had found her never entering her mind as the burly leader of the Witch hunters drew his sword at the sight of the commotion. \"My lords!\" He bellowed, \"Look at what this Witch has caused!\" he motioned to the struggling sister, kicking and screaming at the man holding her and the others trying to step closer to help, as well as the dog that had pulled the one man to the ground, stubbornly mauling at the man's leg, \"This Witch is better off dead!\" He hollered over all sound, instantly causing Hafwen's blood to run cold. \"No!\" She screeched, locking eyes with her panicked sister, \"RUN!\" she screamed at her before turning nastily on the man still grabbing at her and swung for him, her fingers spread and half curled as she clawed her nails down his face with a furious scream, causing his grip to loosen as he reached for his face with a yell, leaving the older sister to take her chance and run for her sister \"Gaius!\" she called for her dog, who left the man to follow his owner, jumping and locking his jaws around the wrist of another man that made to grab the dark haired woman. Rhoslyn fell out of the way of the man's first swing, scrambling to push her self to her feet with her wrists bound so tight, only for the burly man to kick her back to the ground, earning a pained yelp and raise his sword high. There was little Hafwen could do as she reached her sister and threw her body over the younger's, hugging her protectively and pinching her eyes shut tight as she waited for what ever would come, sharpness, pain or just darkness. The heavy clank of metal meeting rung loud in Hafwen's ears, causing both her sister's and her own body to jolt in fright, before the dark haired woman opened her eyes and slowly peered up to the man towering over her. Her lips parted as she sucked in a small, stunned breath, her wide eyes never leaving him as he fixed the man across from him with the most vicious of glares, his sword out stretched and holding firm beneath the hunter's, having swiftly and effortlessly stopped the man's swing. \"What are you doing!\" The Witch hunter growled with effort, still pushing down on his own sword, to show a form of dominance and try and make the knight's hold buckle. Behmen said nothing as he threw the man's sword off his own, the force sending the burly man back a step as his weapon swung out to his side, only to turn back on the knight in challenge and find the tip of the long sword pointed at his throat. \"Back down,\" was all the Knight growled. \"Do you have any idea what she is!\" the man hissed, pointing a finger down to the two sisters, who both looked up at him. \"That is not for you to decide!\" Behmen growled, stretching his arm out a little more, pushing his sword closer to the man, causing him to step back again. \"Come on,\" Hafwen whispered to her sister, moving her arms from their protective hug around her, to gently grab her arms, both of them slowly getting to their feet and slinking behind the knight. \"Hafwen!\" Rhoslyn, whispered with a shake in her voice as she gripped at her older sister, noticing another man stroll forwards, swinging his own sword impressively to warm up his wrist. \"I look forwards to hearing this explanation!\" Felson spoke as he fixed the dark haired Hafwen with a stern look and strode past them to stand at his friend's side. \"You're with these witches?\" The burly man accused as his ragged group came to his aid, one cradling his hand, one man scowling at Hafwen with all the hate he could muster and another man limping and needing support by the only man that wasn't injured. \"Gaius!\" Hafwen called in a hushed tone, waving the dog closer to her instead of having him perched ready for battle, like he was. \"This'll be easy,\" Felson scoffed, ignoring the man's question as he looked at the four sorry excuse of men stood with their leader, who instantly bristled at his words. \"Men!\" The hunter called, a smug grin finding it's way on his near hidden lips. Both Behmen and Felson watched with out much reaction or care as a good group of eight extra men stepped forwards, all their faces smug as they waited for the fearful reaction, but all the knight's did was look to the other and share a sarcastic smirk and slight bob of their heads before facing the group again. \"Still easy,\" Felson then shrugged. Hafwen swallowed thickly as she nudged her sister further from the armed men, only to be greeted by the third man she had met, Debelzaq, as he stepped forwards to usher the two away from what would be a violent fight. This was going to be longer... because i couldn't stop trying... then it became too long...but that's ok coz i have the first part of the next chapter already down...so things are flowing nicely! :D[Chapter 10] ...Hmmm...i've had this one done for a while... but i'm not sure about it ...i don't no why... :( i've re-read it so many times...re-doing and editing to keep it real...but still! it has annoyed me so much! so i appologise before hand...but here it is... 10: Barriers \"There's too many of them!\" Hafwen whispered in worry as she gripped at Debelzaq's arm as the witch hunters drew their weapons while the two Knights settled in their readied stances. \"They have fought much worse,\" he simply soothed, patting Hafwen's hand while his eye's drifted from the men and towards the robed figures, still watching, only turning as another man quickly approached, causing them to part for him. \"Stop!\" He called firmly, instantly causing a hush to fall over everyone gathered in the court yard and all to look his way. Hafwen and Rhoslyn peered up to see a youthful looking man with a head of thick dark curls, frowning at the proceedings out side the house of god. \"What is the…\" he started off strong before his eye's fell on the knights and all power in his voice left him as his face dropped. Hafwen's brows knotted as she looked from the man and over to the two knights and back again, noting that it looked as if the poor man had seen a ghost. \"Oh good lord,\" he uttered to himself as he touched his head and from there drew a cross over his chest as he closed his eyes, pausing a moment before re-opening them. \"Does he…know them?\" Hafwen whispered to Debelzaq, her eyes still watching as the man descended the few steps and headed towards the knights. \"Yes, it's been a while,\" The priest settled for that as an answer, glad the woman was not looking his way to see the unconvincing cringe on his face. \"Great Priest!\" The Witch hunter bowed, jolting the man's attention his way, \"These men are harbouring a Witch!\" Hafwen pushed her sister behind herself and Debelzaq as she scowled at the hunter, her face only softening when Behmen sheathed his sword. Behmen turned to the curly haired man, taking a few strong strides towards him and placing his right hand on the man's right shoulder. \"We need to talk,\" was all the knight said, fixing the man with a look that said more. \"Of course, I'll have you as guests, but…what? How?\" he gawped at the knight as he took a step back. \"You think we have a clue?\" Felson scoffed as he stepped up next to Behmen, \"And you should probably sort this out first,\" he then motioned to the motley group of Witch hunters. \"She is a Witch!\" the short, stocky leader pointed, turning the man's attention towards Hafwen, Debelzaq and the half hidden sister, but the curly haired man only seemed to gawp at the sight of the priest before one of the robed men scuttled forwards to speak in his ear. \"It is true, we believe the young girl is a Witch,\" he agreed. \"Finally! Someone talking sense!\" The hunter huffed, before motioning two men to restrain Rhoslyn. \"Don't you dare!\" Hafwen frowned as the men stepped forwards, she couldn't let them take her sister again. The elder yelped as she was yanked from her sister, Gaius starting to growl before Felson stepped in and restrained the dog by his scruff. The sisters shared a panicked look as they were separated, only to fight to latch onto each other again, Rhoslyn raising her bound arms to hug around her sister's neck while, Hafwen crushed her arms around her younger sister's ribs, both desperately hugging each other till they were once again yanked apart. \"You can't do this! She's not a Witch!\" the elder sister's throat tightened as she forced her words out to the robed men. \"Kay,\" Behmen fixed the curly haired man with a asking look. \"There is nothing I can do for the moment,\" he answered quietly, earning an understanding nod from the knight. \"Hafwen!\" Her younger sister called tearfully, and instantly she went to her, only for Behmen to hold an arm out and catch her around the waist, pulling her back a step. \"Leave it,\" He spoke quietly to her, only for her furious eyes to lock with his own, the muscles in her jaw flaring as they tensed. \"She's my sister!\" she almost growled, \"I can't just 'leave it'!\" she spat as she shoved his arm away from her, only for him to change hold on her and take a firm but careful grip on her upper arm, he wanted to stop her from going after the men after all, not hurt her. \"It's all we can do for now until you explain what has happened!\" Behmen pressed wisely and when she only glared at him, her eyes slowly growing watery and bottom lip starting to quiver, he turned away, still keeping a hold on her as he spoke, \"She is not to be harmed!\" he raised his voice to the large gang. \"We'll do what we like!\" The hunter called back. \"You will do as you're told,\" Kay answered back, his brows raised as he used his authority, the leader of the Witch hunters giving a begrudging bow of his head in acceptance of the terms, Rhoslyn was not to be harmed. Hafwen sniffed lightly as she wiped a grubby hand across her cheek to catch the straying tear, \"Just when I thought I was done with crying,\" She muttered to herself, as she pulled her arm out of the knights hold and shuffled to gather her discarded belongings. \"I have missed out on a lot, it seems,\" The young priest frowned as he watched the woman. \"Not at all, in fact it's all been rather uneventful,\" Felson shrugged, heaving a deep breath like an exaggerated sigh to better show his boredom. \"Uneventful?\" The curly haired man almost scoffed before lowering his tone to a hissed whisper, \"For three walking dead men I buried two years ago, grappling with a group of mercenaries over a suspected Witch,\" He rose his brows at the small group, before turning his look to Behmen solely, \"And with a Lady friend,\" the curly haired man's raised brow look turned to more boyish and suggesting, \"I do not believe 'uneventful' is the right word,\" he finished off, straitening his spine as he stood back up strait, having leaned closer to the men in order to whisper so quietly with them. \"Well, I believe the young woman is some how mixed up in all the 'Witch' business,\" Debelzaq opened his arms with a shrug, making a start at trying to shed some light on their current predicament. \"And we are mixed up with this woman because of him,\" Felson jabbed a thumb to the other knight, giving a roll of his eyes and ignoring the scowl he received. \"And we were always walking dead men,\" Behmen lifted one shoulder at his own words, Felson giving a nod in agreement. \"Speak for your selves!\" Debelzaq leaned away from the two knights with a frown, before looking to Kay, \"We need your help,\" he signed. \"I'll do what I can, the books and scrolls would be my only suggestion on where to start with figuring out 'this',\" He motioned to the men before him and their less than dead state, \"but for now I'll have rooms set for you,\" Kay nodded to the men, before looking over to the woman as she came back from searching behind the caged wagon, dusting off another blanket, \"And for your young lady,\" his lips twitched up in a smile as he looked to Behmen, only to receive a single raised brow from the look, despite the mixed emotions, confusion, shock and drama the curly haired still found a small humour amongst such a mess. \"Oh Gaius, what now?\" Hafwen sighed as she knelt to greet the dog as he came to her, \"You're covered in blood, I didn't think you had such violence in you!\" she then cringed, her voice still wavering and throat tight from the need to cry, \"You can barely see your white bit!,\" she ruffled the unstained part of white fur on his chest, the dog being mostly black apart from his legs and around his muzzle that bended into a dark tan, then of course the tiny fleck of white on his chest and on the very tips of his paws. With a sigh she then wrapped her arms around him and buried her face into his long, dark fur while he sat patiently, both ears flopped over and tail beating in a soft wag, the animal would have looked totally gormless had it not been for the red smeared over his snout. \"Hafwen,\" Behmen spoke to get the woman's attention, waiting as she peered up at him with watery brown eyes, mud was mixed in with her messy hair and dashed all over her clothes, hands and face, not as much as when he had fist found her mind. \"Come on,\" He held a hand out for her and nodded his head towards the others. \"Where?\" she sniffled, her brows knotting in a light frown as she moved some of her hair from her face only to reveal a smudge of blood on her cheek she had gotten from the dog's fur. \"Inside, so you can get clean and rested and help your sister,\" he raised his brows as he watched her nod her head and look down to her lap, her hair falling around her face in messy tendrils. \"Thank you,\" she whispered tiredly, her throat still tight and with a huff, Behmen dropped his offered hand to his side and crouched down onto one knee next to her. He gently placed a gloved hand to her cheek and turned her to look at him, using his thumb to wipe the small amount of blood off her cheek, before he froze, his eyes lifting to hers, big, brown and stunned with confusion and he knew why, he was being far to familiar with her, more so than he should be and more so than he liked and he didn't know why. The knight suddenly felt like her gaze bore into him and what was left of the dwindling crowed judged, even though neither of them actually did, but it still caused him to drop his hand away from her face and fix her with a stern look, deciding from now on, that would not happen again and barriers will be built. \"Have your legs stopped working girl?\" He raised a brow as he stood, \"Or do you need to be carried?\" His tone was almost formal, the questions coming out like a well practiced politeness that would then only be acted on if requested, rather than asking because of a genuine care or worry, but although his words were not mean, they were not taken nicely. \"No,\" she frowned lightly, taken back at the sudden change, even in the short time she had been in his presence he had never addressed her as 'girl', he had giving her a title of 'Lady', one she was not worth of, before she insisted that using her name alone would be fine, but 'girl'! She did not like it one bit! \"They work fine,\" She huffed, raising to her feet with a frown. \"Good, bring your things,\" he nodded and turned to lead the way while Hafwen's face twisted in a distasteful look before she bent and grappled her things into her arms with another huff. \"Come on Gaius,\" she breathed, her brows still knotted in a light frown as she trudged on behind the knight a good few paces, her feet now starting to scuff against the floor as she felt her energy suddenly drain, she hadn't been sleeping well, she'd spent the whole of yesterday on horse back and the whole of today trudging around Marburg following the gang of witch hunters waiting for them to stop and give her a chance at freeing her sister and the only good chance she had and took, had been in vain. She had lost more again today, even when she thought she had nothing else to loose she turned out to be very wrong, her sister was cruelly taken for a second time. Then of course both horses had been stolen from the stables of the inn and she was too scared to do anything about it, she was angry beyond belief but she remained in line with the rest of the crowd, she could have stood up and claimed them, but she didn't. She liked to think it was smart of her to keep quiet, after all it would have only gotten her in trouble, and in a shady part of town where no one would care to listen to her voice, stand on her side or step into help. It would have ended much worse than the event that just took place, and then where would she be in helping her sister? There was no doubt that keeping quiet and biding her time would have been completely logical, but it was the fear that kept her quiet, no cunning plan or brave thought and she knew that was the truth, she was useless and helpless, and with that last thought her blood froze in her body as she slowed to a stop. She sucked in a shaky breath as she looked to the stone beneath her feet, having been following for a small amount of time with the three men she'd met before and the one she hadn't, too lost in thought to notice where she was going till she took this moment to pause, her brown eyes lifting to stare at the back of Behmen, striding tall and calmly up the dimly lit stone hall way talking quietly with Felson. Had it not been for him, she would have been dead, twice now, she didn't know why he was here or how, but with out him that hunter would have struck both her sister and herself because she couldn't even protect herself let alone her younger sister. With a silent tear, Hafwen raised her fingers to her mouth, pressing the grubby but cold tips against her lips to still their quivering as her eyes found the ground once more as the realisation of her actions assaulted her. With a panicked whine Gaius paced away from Hafwen and towards the group of men still walking ahead before turning sharply and heading back towards the woman, circling around her and heading back towards the men again, trying to heard the straying members back together. On the third attempt of the dog's herding he finally caught Behmen's attention, nearly tripping the knight over having dashed in front of his legs so fast and close it caused him to stumbled a step so he didn't trod on the dog before stopping and turning to frown at the animal, forcing him to then notice Hafwen's absence from the group. He said nothing to the group as he started to make his way back down the dim hall to where the woman stood, approaching carefully, unsure of why she had stopped or what had set her off and caused her sudden stillness. Reaching a hand out he hesitated, unsure on what he should do, he couldn't be too familiar with the woman, he needed barriers. \"We could have been killed,\" She whispered, choking out a sob before pressing her hand closer to her mouth and she pinched her eyes closed and bowed her head more to hide her face. Behmen simply frowned, lowering his arm to his side and tilting his head to try and get a better look at her face. \"I don't even know why you are here,\" she cried, moving her hand from her mouth so she could speak, her words confusing him slightly but he listened, \"but if you hadn't been he would have killed us,\" her voice strained around the words as her throat tightened so much it was nearly suffocating her, \"I was completely helpless,\" she wheezed, trying to wipe her tears, as the Knight now understood, \"Useless,\" the word fell from her lips weakly as the simple act of speech now seemed impossible in her current state and as Behmen witnessed the woman before him crumble, he closed his eyes with a sigh, building barriers seeming so much harder now, because it was now she needed comfort and support, and could he be so heartless in this moment and deny her that? \"I would have gotten us killed,\" she sobbed, her hand stretching to cover her face before she dropped the few things she carried and brought her other hand to her face, her body slumping as it went to crumple down to the floor like her things, but unlike them she was caught. Behmen breathed a sad sigh into her hair as he supported her body and carefully brought them both to the floor, holding her tightly as he sat and leaded his back against the stone wall of the hall, the young woman curled up between his legs and crying into his chest. The knight said nothing as he held her, he didn't know what to say for the moment or do for that matter, he was stuck rather awkwardly with his arms wrapped tightly around her torso, feeling her uneven gasps of air jolt at her body and his, her face still hidden behind her hands in a last attempt she had at hiding her weakness, even after her sobbing had slowly died down. \"Hafwen,\" he whispered after she fell silent, looking down at her and lifting a hand from his tight embrace of her to move her hair from her face before then gently moving her hands from her face, \"Hafwen,\" he tried again, speaking softly and waiting patiently till she looked up at him, red faced and teary eyed. \"I could have killed us,\" she whispered, a few tears falling from her eyes. \"You can't live thinking about what could have been,\" his brows knotted lightly as he gently shook his head. \"But..\" she sniffled only to be hushed by the knight as he placed his gloved hand to the side of her head and held her to his chest. \"Don't,\" he ordered softly with a light frown creasing his brow, feeling as one of her hands gripped at his tunic and the other at his arm that cradled her head. \"That is not what happened and that is what you must focus on,\" He advised, ignoring the small group as they stepped closer despite them all understanding the way the woman felt and feeling her pain as easy as they could see it. \"You are both safe,\" he whispered into her hair, \"And I will do all in my power to see you reunited,\" He promised, looking up to his long time friend who shared a knowing and understanding look, having expected this from the younger knight at some point. \"Let's get you settled my dear,\" Debelzaq spoke as he gathered her few things, \"Is this all you have?\" he then frowned, before looking to the younger priest with a worried frown. \"We'll find a change of clothes,\" He nodded, looking down to the woman as she rubbed tiredly at her eyes and slowly sat up from Behmen's embrace. \"I had clothes, they were with my horses,\" She whispered, her voice still strained no matter how quiet she spoke. \"I'll send someone to retrieve them,\" Kay nodded, feeling pity for the woman he didn't know. \"You can't,\" Hafwen coughed lightly as she cleared her throat and wiped her eyes, \"They took everything,\" she brought her arms into herself to cross protectively under her bust. All the men frowned, confused for a moment before the knights passed each other a look and instantly understood her words. Felson bristled, despite not wishing to get involved with the woman and her troubles due to having their own to sort, he was now finding himself more willing to help with each passing moment, the Witch hunter's having gotten to his very last nerve. The way they treated the woman before him, the way they left her, the damage they had caused in her life, he could now only too easily fit together the events that had unfolded in the woman's life because of the men. Finding her they way they had, and thinking of someone causing it turned at him, but now that more light had been shed even with out explanation, he was livid. \"We'll just see about that,\" The elder Knight growled tightening his jaw as he looked both ways down the corridor starting to plot the best course of action. Hafwen peered up at Felson in confusion before gasping lightly as Behmen moved behind her, bringing them both to their feet and supporting her till he was happy she was sturdy on her own. \"Take Hafwen to her room,\" Behmen spoke as he shared another look with his friend, the look saying more between the two than words could. Debelzaq nodded and hovered a hand over her back and started to guide her back down the hall way with out a word. \"Keep it clean?\" Kay asked hopefully, his facial expression almost timid due to the request he made. \"Can't promise that,\" Felson shook his head as he cracked his knuckles. \"It'll be in her sister's best interest,\" the curly haired youth then pressed with a pleading look to Behmen, receiving nothing more than a nod to show he had heard his words. \"So much for building them barriers you where just talking about ,\" Felson rolled his eyes as he strode on with his friend at his side. \"She needed someone in that moment,\" Behmen simply defended, his eyes trained forwards, \"She has no one else,\" \"If I didn't know you any better, I'd say you were starting to care,\" the greying knight rose a single brow, looking to his friend in the corner of his eye. \"Then it is a good thing you do know me better,\" the younger of the knights tilted his head to throw a less than impressed look to the other. With a sigh Kay shook his head as he watched the knights head off, praying what ever trouble they stirred up now that he would be able to cover it up and manage it. The Elder sister looked around the cold room she stood in, giving a small sniffle before looking to the priest stood out side of the room, his back to her and peering both ways down the hall. \"I don't think I got your name, Sir\" She called, causing him to turn and look at her from where he stood out in the hall. \"We were never introduced,\" she gave a slight shrug before admitting sheepishly, \"My fault, I'm sorry, I should have made more of an effort when you all brought me back to the farm house,\" she then raised a hand to knead at her forehead, wondering if there was anything she thought over properly, of course she heard his name but it was different to exchanging names and starting a familiarity by that simple introduction. \"Of course,\" He nodded as he turned and stepped into the room, holding a hand out warmly, \"And introductions were the least of your worries my dear,\" he past her a friendly smile as he took her hand for a gentle shake, \"but by any means, I'm Debelzaq,\" \"Debelzaq,\" Hafwen spoke softly as she gently shook his hand back, \"I'm Hafwen,\" she tried a small smile. \"Lovely to meet you,\" The priest bowed his head, playing at the greeting as if he'd never met the elder sister before and this was their first encounter, causing a light chuckle of amusement to fall from the dark haired woman. \"Lovely to meet you too,\" She played back in the same manner before they both released from their hand shake and the elder sister's face fell a little into a thoughtful expression. \"May I ask you something, Debelzaq?\" she started, her eyes finding the floor. \"What is it my dear?\" he tried another smile but it had a slight worry to it, as he was unsure what it was she was going to ask and worried she some how knew their secret. \"Where did Behmen and Felson go?\" She tilted her head as she brought her gaze back to him, waiting for the reply patiently. The two knights had left some time ago and since then Debelzaq paced and kept look out while the curly haired man, she didn't know, had vanished to gather some maids to fill a bath for her. \"Sorry,\" she mumbled as she moved out the way for the short, busty maid as she came into the room once more to finish tending to the bath. \"They just,\" The priest paused, \"Went to tend to…a matter?\" he offered, the unsure question evident in his voice. \"That matter has been resolved!\" Felson's voice called out, catching both their attention as they turned to the door way as both knights strode in. \"What matter?\" Hafwen questioned, looking from Felson and to Behmen, only to wrap her arms around her self and look away, a sudden bout of embarrassment falling over her. \"A few men found some horses they thought had no owner,\" Felson started as he and Behmen set down a few bags, \"As well as some lost items,\" He motioned to the bags, the false casual tone he spoke in bringing a small smile to Hafwen's lips, \"We put them right,\" He then waved the matter away, while Hafwen nodded, deciding not to question the matter as she could only guess that the less friendly version of the 'matter' was not something she would like to hear in detail. \"Thank you,\" She spoke quietly with a thankful smile. \"Now, about that explanation I've been looking forward to hearing,\" The elder knight spoke as he pulled a wooden chair away from a small table with a defining screech and turned it to face her, \"We've all guessed at what has happened, but let's hear it anyway,\" he opened his arms with a shrug as he sat himself in the chair and looked at her expectantly. Hafwen stood rigid as she looked at Felson with a doe like expression, unfolding her arms only to nervously twist her fingers together as she looked from him and to Debelzaq, who simply clasped his hands together willing to listen and happy he wasn't the one pressing the matter. Lastly she looked to Behmen, who simply folded his arms and leaned against the wall next to the door, giving a simple nod for her to start when she was ready. ...so much for holding in the inner turmoil and saving people from the awkward 'the hell do i do?!' moment... ...hmm... and i did say Hafwen was rubbish at planning...can't say she had much of a plan other than, find her sister...bad times not everything runs quite so smoothly...:/ ...still... i dunno what it is about this one i don't like...there is just summet!... i hope it's just me being paranoid...but on the plus side...they are getting longer...[Chapter 11] Heeeey... shout out to see if anyone is still there? XD I forgot all my log in details and just happened upon them by chance. I've had this chapter written for ages so I thought I'd post to see who, if anoyone, is about before doing anything more. I want to go though and give this story a good sort and clean up if any readers are left. 11: Ludicrous Hafwen's lips parted a few times as she attempted speech but remained silent after each try, and the moment she finally found the courage to start a figure appeared in the door way to interrupt and caused her to breathe out all the strength she had built up. \"Sorry, am I interrupting?\" The curly haired priest held his hands up as he looked around the room and at the various looks he'd received. \"Actually you're just in time!\" Felson waved him over and instantly Hafwen froze. She looked to the unknown man feeling a little more apprehensive at starting her story now. \"This is Kay,\" Behmen unfolded an arm to motion to the young man and both Hafwen and Kay looked his way as he spoke. \"You can trust him.\" He nodded, stepping over to the door to the room and closing it to save any more interruptions. \"I'm here to help in anyway I can!\" The curly haired man held his hands out and gave a friendly smile and with a slow nod the dark haired sister relaxed a little. \"The floor is yours!\" The elder knight motioned towards her. With a slow shaky breath and a few paced steps Hafwen thought over what she should say and what she shouldn't, licking her lips and knotting her brows as she thought of where to start. \"They came to our village- the witch hunters- making a spectacle of them selves and my sister and I didn't bother to join the crowd like the others, we just went on with our day.\" she started, shrugging at her own words like it was nothing. \"I assumed they would come and go with out much hassle- after all our village is small, everyone knows everyone and there is nothing to really see- but I was wrong!\" She shook her head, not looking at anyone as she spoke her mind, deep in her memories as she replayed everything and the group waited patiently. \"The hoard of men came to my home, shoved their way in, and started to search the entire place while stating they believed a Witch was hiding there because some... stupid girl- \" The sister scowled, visibly struggling with finding something less offensive to describe Arlais, the bar maid. \"-said Rhoslyn was a witch, because she had a black cat!\" Hafwen licked her lips as she paused, taking a calming breath as the anger built in her. \"They ransacked our home and disturbed our ill father in search of her just because she had a cat ?\" A lone unamused laugh passed her lips like a scoff at the reasoning behind her sister's capture. After a pause she shook her head and continued. \"I told them Rhoslyn was not a witch and sent them from our home and I thought that to be the end.\" Her gaze searched the floor as she took another moment to calm. \"They torched my home, with my father still inside and they had thought I was inside too.\" Her eyes remained to the floor before taking another refreshing breath, clearing the image of her burning home from her mind. \"I then tried to get her back, ran through the woods with Gaius and caught up to the travelling group, then the last thing I remember was the pain.\" She tenderly touched the still sore part of her head, before looking to the three men that had found her. \"And I believe that is when you came along and found me?\" she finished quietly and swallowed thickly, trying to ignore the tightening of her chest as she waited for a response from the men. \"Branded a Witch for having a cat?\" Kay questioned with a gawk that showed how ludicrous he thought it was. \"Yes.\" She nodded, worried for a moment that none of them would believe her. \"How on earth did he manage to convince my council with that as evidence?\" He exclaimed, the bafflement knotted on his youthful face in a rather comical way that would have had Hafwen giggling had it been over a different matter. \"They lied,\" She shrugged. \"Something about cursing their father and bewitching her sister?\" Felson turned his hand flippantly while Kay recovered his gawking expression and stepped closer to the elder sister. \"I'm sorry this has happened to you both, but knowing what I do now, I'm sure I can put this right!\" he spoke sympathetically and with a passion that stunned the young woman. \"Thank you!\" She spoke in a near squeak, quickly wiping a tear away as it escaped in relief. \"Not at all, I'll see to the council right away,\" He nodded, \"Please, just make your self comfortable, I'll leave you with a maid!\" He gave her a small smile and nod of his head. \"What about my sister?\" Hafwen was quick to question, \"Is she alright? Where are you keeping her?\" \"Unfortunately for now she will be in the cells, but there is a cot provided and food, but I doubt she will be there for long once everything is cleared!\" He held his hands out to try and calm the elder sister. \"I can't leave her in a cell,\" she mumbled. \"Can't do everything in one night sweetheart,\" Felson grumbled as he stood, \"Now get cleaned up, you look far better when you're not covered in dirt!\" He stated as he moved to the far end of the room and swung the door open, leaving Hafwen suddenly feeling quite self-conscious over her appearance. The elder sister simply stood as the group slowly left the room and a maid returned, looking to the door as Debelzaq turned with a smile. \"We shall see you later this evening my dear,\" he nodded his head before closing the door to her room, leaving Hafwen to simply take in her new surroundings before looking to the maid, who nodded towards her. \"Hello,\" Hafwen nodded to her politely. \"Miss,\" The short woman nodded back before reaching out her arms and motioning her forward, \"Before the water looses it's heat,\" she then prompted. \"I'll be fine to bath on my own,\" The sister shook her head, \"Thank you,\" She then nodded to dismiss the woman who in turn bobbed her head with a smile and excused herself from the room. The shouting within the room increased with each word that fell from each of the men trying to be heard and it left the young, curly haired priest with his face hidden in his hands. With a deep sigh he slowly pulled his hands a little down his face and kneaded his fingertips over his eye lids having been stuck in the shouting contest for longer than he would like, completely ignored every time he opened his mouth to try and calm the voices down. \"Could we just-\" He tried again only to stop as he went unheard, instead choosing to tilt his head back and groan. He had been addressing the council he had put together over the Witch matters, relaying the information and trying to press the matter of Rhoslyn, and he seemed to be doing fine with changing their views, after all the words of the Knights Priest was absolute. That was until the group of Witch hunters decided they should be involved with the meeting and with the backing of one notorious council member, they proceeded to run all progress he had made into the ground. \"High priest?\" One of the robed men addressed the younger, waiting for a moment or two for the called man to look his way. When Kay looked to the man asking for his attention he was forced to summon all that was left of his strength to hold in his look of detest. \"Yes, Joseph?\" He asked for him to continue, his brows raised expectantly while his thoughts seethed at the other man. Kay didn't like him and having him on council turned him. The man was difficult and pushed at everything he could, be it just to disagree with Kay or to argue with him, either way his attitude was always challenging towards Kay and his presence was unfriendly. Kay had noticed the man was hard to find and would skulk away into the shadows until a council was called upon and the young priest was suspicions and weary of the other man. He didn't know what Joseph did within the walls of Marburg and it worried him that he was unable to find out. It mean the man had more working along side him and backing him. \"We believe it would be best if the girl went with the other accused to be trialled and treated!\" Joseph spoke slowly, almost smug and teasing as he looked to the higher ranking man. Instantly a murmur of agreement filled the room and Kay glanced around the council members as passively as he could. The decision had been completely flipped and Kay could only note that as another warning to Joseph not only challenging him, but gaining favour. \"We shall adjourn this meeting for now!\" Kay stated firmly as he stood from his chair. He was defeated over the matter but he wouldn't let it go. More and more troubles seemed to be coming to him but losing the confidence and support of his council was something that had been sneaking up on him gradually. Had Kay stuck to the tactics others had before him- demanding respect and power or face punishment- then he could have things his way and work in his favour, but that wasn't how he wanted to lead and wouldn't ever force his higher stature upon others to have things his way; that was not in his person, he was more respectable than that, but it was also the cause of his struggle for authority. \"Sir, if I may,\" One of the other council members stepped forwards, \"The men that stand with the witch's sister, who are they?\" his brows knotted lightly as he asked his question, \"You seem familiar with these men,\" \"I am,\" Kay nodded. \"They are Knights, and great men you have all heard about, and to have them stand on the side of the sister should be all the convincing you need!\" and with that he excused himself from the room, he did not lie to his council but he left out all vital details that identified the three men. Hafwen perched on the very edge of the soft bed, her damp hair sprawled down her back and dampening the blankets she clutched around her. She simply watched as the burly maid struggled with bathing the dog. \"Really ma'am, I could have done it,\" The elder sister spoke again, an apologetic look on her face at how the elder woman had become soaked from the struggling mutt till he had finally excepted his fate and simply sat still in the soapy water and whined. \"Nonsense miss, I won't have you strugglin' with this animal after you have just bathed,\" the buxom woman huffed as she scrubbed a cloth over Gaius muzzle. \"Can't have you smellin' of wet dog when you have just got clean!\" She then stood and grabbed a fresh linen cloth and took a step back, waiting for the dark, sopping wet dog to jump from the wooden tub. The moment the dog hopped out, the maid caught him, draping the cloth over him before he could shake the water from his fur and all over the room and after giving the dog a good but quick rub down the maid stood upright with a huff. \"Right then, I shall leave you once more young miss, I'll return to clear your chamber once you are dressed and dining in the banquette hall.\" she then bowed her head and left after receiving a timid thank you from the elder sister. Hafwen sat in silence for a short moment before standing, her body having dried naturally due to the time she'd been simply sat on the bed. She unwrapped herself from the damp blankets and gave her hair a quick rub dry before she dressed into a soft, cream under dress. With a sigh she then sat back on the bed and slowly brushed her hair, watching idly as Gaius investigated the room, his nose to the floor and only the sounds of his sniffing filling the room. Having brushed and pulled back her hair in a single braid, the elder sister stood once more, heading to her bags and searching for a new dress to wear. She decided on a simple but warm brown dress, again something suited for the farm, the fabric sturdy and practical rather than pretty and flattering. The young priest huffed as he headed from his room, having needed to change before making his way to the main hall to dine with the very same loud mouths that had caused a pounding in his head. He would then have to talk to the sister, bring her more bad news once dinner had finished, break to her that he was unable to do anything for her sister for now, then he would have to speak with Behmen, Felson and Debelzaq and make an attempt at starting to sort out the reason for them being as they are, then of course there was the rising problem with Joseph. With another huff Kay lifted a hand to rub at his forehead, trying to rid the building tensions the day had brought, along with its troubles and emotions. \"This day has been trying.\" He sighed as he strode into the room before his mind drifted to the sisters, instantly thinking his day had probably been far less trying than what they have had to deal with, and instantly sympathised before having to take his mind from the subject before he thought more and more about the bad news he had to deliver. As he moved into the hall and sat at the long table he moved his thoughts to a few parchments he'd already scrambled together in what spare time he had, ones that he felt may help his once lost friends, and pondered if he knew of anything else off the top of his head. \"Doesn't look like things went well.\" A voice broke his concentration, causing the young man to jolt and look to the older knight. \"What makes you say that?\" he questioned in a suspicious defence. \"They are smiling like smug bastards!\" He jabbed a thumb over to the group of Witch hunters that congregated at the other end of the table, their numbers a little drab as some were still being treated for their injuries, oddly enough not all dog bites. \"And you're oddly twitchy.\" He rose a brow to the younger man and simply waited as he sat on his left, Behmen coming around to his right and fixing him with a similar look. \"There was nothing I could do for now.\" He sighed as he looked between them. \"What happened?\" Behmen questioned as he propped his elbows on the long, thick wood table, his hands clasping together and fingers entwining as he brought them to rest over his lips, watching the young priest as he ran a frustrated hand through his curly hair. \"I had the council on side, till the hunters joined the meeting and- \" Kay trailed off, deciding not to go into his problem with one of his council members. Instead his eyes lifted to shoot the motley group of witch hunters sat further down the long table a scowl and he heaved a deep sigh. \"Now they wish to send the sister to the monastery with the others.\" He said, lifting a hand to rub at his forehead. The three men sat for a moment, unsure of what to say and each slowly losing themselves to their thoughts till one of them spoke up. \"Who's going to tell her?\" It was Felson that spoke, causing the other two men to look his way. \"I shall.\" Kay nodded, \"I failed to do what I was so sure of!\" He sighed. \"No,\" Behmen lowered his hands as he spoke, causing both men to turn to him, \"I will speak with her.\" He then stood from his seat and turned, nearly bumping into Debelzaq who headed towards them, and gave the priest a simple nod before moving around him and heading out of the large hall. \"What has happened?\" Debelzaq turned from looking at the retreating form of Behmen and to the two men still sat. He waited a moment longer for them to speak before he slowly sunk down into the seat the other knight had just left, their silence saying more and he simply nodded. \"Things have not gone well I take it.\" He turned to gaze to the young, curly haired Kay. Hafwen clutched the blankets she had piled over her shoulders a little tighter as the coldness of the stone corridor nipped at her before she breathed out a sigh as she came to a cross section in the hall and looked both ways. She wondered on which direction to take before she looked down at the dog by her side. \"Where is she boy?\" She whispered, causing the dog to perk his ears towards her before whining and wagging his tail. \"Come on, where is she?\" She put a small, forced excitement in her tone of causing the dog to fidget and his tail to wag more. \"Go on! Find her!\" She urged, making the animal more excitable before he took off down one of the corridors with Hafwen following regardless if the dog knew where he was going or not, she just figured he had a better chance than her. Hafwen didn't pay attention to where she was going, just simply following the herding dog as he paced in front of her, striding ahead before turning and striding back as he felt he'd gone too far. The elder sister couldn't stay in the room all clean and comfortable while her sister stayed else where, cold, dirty and scared, so she had slung the blankets around her shoulders and grabbed the bag holding the small amount of food and water she had brought with her on the journey and made off to find where her sister was being kept. She hadn't seen the knights or either of the priests since she had told them her story and she'd only been informed that Felson and Behmen had gone back into the town to retrieve their items and the three horses they had rode in, while the priests had gone their separate ways, Kay tending to a council and Debelzaq having gone to find something to read. After not seeing any of the familiar faces in the few hours she had been in the room had caused her to grow more uneasy than she could have imagined so now here she was peeking around another corner before quickening her pace as she continued to follow after her dog. She swallowed as she grasped the metal loop and turned it to lift the latch on the thick wood door, letting Gaius through before slipping in after and closing the door as near silent as she opened it, only to find herself in complete darkness. \"Gaius?\" she whispered, reaching her arms out blindly but keeping her feet still. One hand found the cold stone of the wall while she continued to wave her other around in search of her dog, bending a little at the knees so she was feeling more around his height and the moment she felt his soft and slightly damp fur she curled her fingers into it gently. \"Walk slowly!\" She whispered to him as she shuffled a timid step forwards, the canine padding a few paces forwards before the front of his body suddenly dipped, instantly hinting at a step. Hafwen slid a foot forwards till she could feel the edge and with slow steps, calming breaths, and a patient pet, she made it down the dark spiralling stair case. Once she found the door at the bottom she took a long moment of slow groping as she felt around for the latch all while keeping an ear to the thick wood in hopes of hearing anything she should be aware of. Her nails scraped over the metal latch lightly and in an instant she had gripped it started to lift it, biting down on her bottom lip as she tried to be as quiet as possible. The door creaked open a crack, allowing a low light to stream into the black stair case and she peeked out at what little she could see while keeping Gaius back as he tried to push a snout through the small gap with loud sniffles. Pushing the thick door further, the dark dog instantly slipped out while Hafwen hung her head around the door to check all was clear before stepping out her self and closing the door before looking around at where she had ended up. The cold air greeted her alongside a sharp sent of soiled straw, instantly telling her she was in the stables before she saw any of the horses. \"Hello again!\" She whispered when she rounded one of the stalls and a dark snout was thrust towards her face with a snort. She lifted a hand and smoothed it over the black stallions velvet muzzle before taking a look around to the other familiar horses she had given to the three men. \"I didn't think I would see you all again,\" She commented, her words fading into the air unheard. With a small bark, the elder sister's attention was instantly turned to her dog and she watched as he turned and bounded out of the stables, jolting the woman into movement to follow after him. Hafwen tottered after Gaius in a half attempt of a jog as the dog lead the way, unsure if it was her younger sister he was searching for or food. Hafwen looked around cautiously, feeling more exposed now she had found herself outside and following the towering stone of the building she had once been housed safe and warm inside. She huffed as the distance seemed to grow and she wondered if the long wall would ever end till she finally reached where the face of the building merged with a tower that made the corner of the large building. Gaius paced outside the thick door on the tower, his nose to the floor as he sniffed and his whines become louder before Hafwen stepped forwards. She took another quick look around, wondering why the area was so quiet and frowning as all she saw in the darkness was flower beds. It wasn't by far an unattractive sight, just odd considering she was in search of the dungeons and yet she seemed to be in the gardens and for all she knew the door her dog was pawing at could be nothing more than the gardener's shed. With a thick swallow and shaking hands she gripped the looped handle and twisted the latch up, pushing on the door and opening it slowly, quickly stepping in after her dog and pushing the door almost closed, leaving it slightly ajar for a quick escape. The circular room was small but lit by two torches that flickered from their perches on the stone walls, casing shadows of all the tools littered along the walls. With a deflated sigh she shook her head. \"This is the garden store room.\" she huffed, tired and irritated as she turned to frown at her dog only to tilt her head as she found him scratching at the floor. \"Move,\" she ordered giving him a shove to the side and bending a little as she inspected the floor before reaching her hand out and flicking some dirt to the side only to find a distinctive gap in the floor boards. Standing up right she grappled with the few bags of compost and shuffled them to the side till she found herself staring down at a cellar latch. \"This can't lead to the cells?\" She mumbled as she grabbed the handle and heaved the door up, peering down where a steep set of wooden steps lead down to the space beneath. \"Why is this entrance hidden?\" She questioned to herself in wonder as a familiar feeling of fear unsettled her. \"Gaius!\" She hissed, reaching out for the dog as he almost threw himself down the steep steps before clambering down after him, trying awkwardly to keep her balance as she made her way down and lowered the door with her. \"Gaius!\" She whispered as she squinted in the darkness, looking around till a low glow captured her attention at the end of the hall and the pacing feet of her dog seen dancing within it. As she carefully came to the bottom of the steps and started to make her way along the short hall her breathing became heavy as she forced herself to be calm, stopping only once to look back the way she came. The glow of the store room was reaching down through the lining of the hatch and with a thick swallow she turned back and continued on her way, stepping slow and careful as she tried to listen encase anyone was in the room on the other side of the door. Once she reached the door she carefully placed her ear to the wood and listened, closing her eyes to help her concentrate the one sense despite it being dark enough in the hall. Behmen strode through the long stone halls, breezing the distance easily with his tall stature. He moved with purpose and only slowed when he reached the chamber door Hafwen had been left in. He rose a hand to knock but paused, having not put any thought into what he was going to say or how he was going to say it; he faltered in confidence a short moment before knocking anyway- the elder sister needed to know regardless. He waited patiently a few moments before knocking once more. \"Hafwen?\" He called, thinking it better he alerted her to who was knocking so she felt safer in opening the door, yet an answer never came and with a frown he knocked again. \"Hafwen?!\" He called once more but with more urgency in his tone before gripping the handle of the door and pushing himself into the room. He gave the space one quick look, yet took everything in during the glance, the forgotten bath, the water now cold and dirty, the damp linen, the dirty dress, the untouched bed and the few of Hafwen's bags scattered and left open. \"That girl!\" He growled and with a frown he was out the empty room as quick as he had entered, looking both ways down the long hall as he though on where to go and with a tired sigh he took a good guess at where he might find her. Forcing slow calming breaths Hafwen twisted the handle slowly and pushed the door so carefully it opened at a painfully slow pace until there was enough room for the woman to slip through herself, but she waited. She looked at what she could see of the dimly lit room before carefully peeking her head in and using her leg to block the dog from bursting in before her and once she was happy it was as safe as it could be, she slipped in. She allowed Gaius to follow as she turned quickly to close the door behind her only to then knock an odd looking instrument that was hanging on the back of it and she jumped away from it with a gasp as it clanged loudly. Her heart drummed in her chest at the thought of being caught and what would happen to her. Panic came at her as she realised she again hadn't thought about her actions and could be getting her self into trouble that was way over her head if she got caught. \"Oh dear,\" She whispered as she looked around the dim room she was in. The ceiling of the room was stone and built in an arch making up the strong foundations of the enormous building towering on top, but it wasn't the cold stone that made her blood run cold. It was the tools that covered the area around, hanging on the walls and scattered on every work surface, everyone of them odd looking and their uses unknown to the sister. A strained, pitiful whine pulled from Gaius, causing Hafwen to spin in search of him and when she found him she frowned, her gaze moving to what he had found. Laying on top of a high wooden bench was a figure, covered completely with a blood stained sheet. \"Gaius!\" She gasped, calling for the dog as she moved to the far wall with wide eyes before searching for a quick exit and other than the way she had came through there was none. A loud bang caused a vicious jolt of fright to leap through her body before causing her to freeze as she looked wide eyed to the door way she had just come through, her dog instantly starting to growl lowly and causing her to panic more. Someone had just come down through the cellar hatch and dropped it close behind them and there was no where else for her to go. ...So the fun continues and it seems all parties have problems that are growing and now merging together. Not all is safe and in control in Marburg for Kay. Our trio are still none the wiser and haven't had the time to even look into their odd situation. Rhoslyn can't catch a break. Gaius is turning out to have quite the nose for trouble. And Hafwen has yet to learn from her mistakes with that one tracked mind of hers. What trouble awaits and what dark secrets have been stumbled upon? Is Marburg truley a safe place? Is Kay really in controll? What more will our odd group have to face? :O[Chapter 12] 12: Rage The beat of Hafwen's heart was so fast in her chest it was nearly humming. Her wide eyes were frozen on the slightly ajar door she had come through only moments before and she was unable to go any where or do anything other than wait to get caught. \"Gaius, hush!\" She whispered to still the dog's whines, not that it mattered if he was silent or not, she would be found regardless, but when the dog did not do as ordered she turned her wide eyes to find him. She hoped she would be slightly better off with him at her side, but the animal was out of sight and it caused her a short distraction that had her quickly scrambling to find him. She dropped her body to a crouch and peered beneath any work tops in hopes of spotting the animal while she followed the sounds of his whines. She found him when she reached the wall opposite to the door she had entered through and further horror struck her when she came to realise that he had found his way into the next room, the dog had easily wandered into a small stone arch that she could only guess was for drainage, judging by the size and slight slope of the flooring. The drainage arch would have been the perfect little escape route, it only needed one willing enough to get on to their hands and knees to crawl through and the passage was hardly long, simply the same thickness of the wall, which although was quite impressive it could hardly be classed as a tunnel, the only problem with the exit rout was the bars. Hafwen's hands gripped the slim bars as she stared at her dog on the other side before giving them a frustrated and panicked shake, the small outburst causing her to knock one of the bars partly free- having not been so solid as the others- so with nothing else but hope she tugged as hard as she could, to gain as much room as she could, her fright burning wild and only getting worse as she listened to the approaching foot steps. Ripping the blankets from her shoulders she threw them through the larger gap and next came the small bag before she forced her way past her self. She angled her head and shoulders through and winched when she had to rather forcefully squash her chest past, her panic not helping as she wriggled with effort as the next hurdle came at wedging her hips and back side past, a great gasp of relief rushing past her lips once she popped free. She felt a sudden rush of triumph at having managed the escape but celebrated too soon as with a deep grunt a burly arm reached past the bars and gripped her ankle, causing her to kick her leg out with a shriek while Gaius burst forwards with canine heroics and bit at the wrist with a growl. The moment she was released the dog backed off with his owner, the elder sister scrambling back and out of the confines of the small arch as her wide eyes watched the thick arm retreat back behind the bars, the man bathed in shadows but it was easy to see his bulking form was far too large to follow after her. She stood and gathered her things hurriedly and scrambled away from the arch, moving to the side of it and placing her back to the wall only noticing now that she was panting as she tipped her head back and blew out a slow breath to try and force calmness on herself as her adrenaline dropped. \"Hafwen?\" The soft voice called in the distance, causing the dog to burst off in excitement while the called woman lifted her head in a moment of stun. She watched as Gaius' happy whines of excitement had him pacing and spinning on the spot erratically as pale hands reached between the bars to stroke him, \"Rhoslyn?\" Hafwen then questioned as she inched her way forwards and when she could see the prisoner better she burst forward with a gasp, the sisters both reaching their arms through the bars and crushing one another into them as they hugged, \"Are you hurt?\" the elder then questioned in panic as she created some distance so she could look her over. \"No, I'm fine!\" The younger shook her head, her voice quiet and still holding a scared quake to it, her breath fogging in the brisk cold. \"Here, take these.\" Hafwen then frowned as she thrust the blankets through the gaps in the bars and at her sister, frowning at the space behind her, noting that the cot was nothing more than a straw mattress that had burst and the bedding a rather drab looking sheet that would give the skin a rash it was so course. \"How did you find your way here?\" Rhoslyn then questioned as she wrapped the blankets around herself and held them snug. \"Hope and a herding dog?\" The elder sister then offered with a small smile and thankfully it caused a small snuffle of amusement from her younger sibling who then reached through the bars to stroke the dog, \"He found the oddest way in, mind?\" She then commented as she stared down the length of the great stone room and to the small drainage arch in the wall, her thoughts running through all that she saw in that room. \"What was on the other side?\" Her sister's voice whispered as she leaned her face close to the bars to try and see. \"I don't know, a hidden room?\" She whispered back. \"I heard screaming from that way.\" Rhoslyn's voice was eerie when she whispered those words. Kay visibly paled when he saw the look on the Knight's face as he near marched back into the hall and straight for him, leaving him to only sink back in his seat with a prepared wince, \"Where is the sister being held?\" Behmen questioned, his tone a deadly calm but words throwing the young priest for a moment as he was sure he was about to be on the receiving end of something bad. \"Sorry?\" was all he could questioned, his brows knotting together lightly and pulling up in a look of confusion. \"The sister, where are you holding her?\" He rephrased but it did not help the youngster's confusion. \"In the cells!?\" Kay shook his head in bafflement. \"Just the cells?\" Behmen pressed. \"Yes,\" He nodded, \"Why do you ask?\" He then questioned when the knight simply nodded as his mind worked back to the memories he had of the building, from his own time imprisoned and once he had a rough idea he was off, forcing Kay to scramble after him, jumping out of his seat to follow. \"Have I missed something?\" \"Hafwen was not in the room.\" Behmen stated gruffly as his long strides carried him powerfully causing the other to have to jog every few paces to keep in step. \"She doesn't know this building, she probably got lost making her way to the hall?\" Kay tried to reason with a light smile as he looked to his friend and despite the disbelieving side eye he received he continued with a grin. \"She could be wandering these hall ways, lost, as we speak!\" He motioned to the long stone corridor around them. \"From what I've witnessed, I believe her to be more difficult than that.\" The knight stated with a slight cock of his head, irritation prickling at him. \"Worried?\" Kay quirked a brow in the other's direction, but when he did not get an answer he almost laughed. \"She will be fine, there is no one in these walls that are allowed to harm her!\" The pair walked in silence for the remainder of the way to the cells, Behmen's brisk pace never once slowing until they reached the guarded door of the dungeons, the armoured man giving a nod and respectful greeting before Kay set to questioning the man of anyone that had entered recently, a young woman to be exact, and as he suspected the answer was no. \"Mind if I check?\" The Knight simply requested and once the guard looked to the priest for permission he stepped aside and the two let themselves through and headed down the steps. \"Behmen, I doubt of all the rooms in this place, she has managed to find her way past the guard, stationed at the only entrance and into the dungeons.\" Kay spoke with a hidden amusement as he followed after the tall man, till they came to the bottom of the stairs. Behmen took a moment to view the place, the great stone arches making up the strong foundations of the large building above and between each of the arch's pillars were the bars of various cells, stretching the entire length of the area on either side, dim torches flickering on the pillars and casting the room in a dull glow. He then strode forwards, his eyes roaming to look through the darkness till he came to one cell, a single brow raising as he spotted the dark furred dog who in turn lifted his head and perked his ears at the guests. \"You were saying?\" He then threw a quick look of mild triumph to Kay who could only look bewildered, staring at the sisters, sat with their back against the stone wall and leaning towards one another shoulder to shoulder, the bars of the cell separating them but not stopping them from enjoying the small comfort their company brought one another as they dozed lightly. \"How did she get in?\" Kay frowned as he looked around the area in shock, looking from the small barred sewage arch at the far end and to the only entrance and exit- the way they had come. \"Hafwen?\" Behmen questioned lightly, any anger or irritation he had initially felt for the woman vanishing when he saw them together. His voice stirred a small frown but did not wake her so he reached out to place a hand on her shoulder as he tried again. \"Hafwen?\" He gave her a light shake, his fingers brushing the exposed skin on her collar bone and noting how cold her skin felt. It distracted him a moment while the woman finally stirred and flailed in a moment of shock. A gasp jumped past her lips and arm flung out in defence, knocking his hand from her and waking her sister in the process before a look of realisation fell on her face. \"It's you!\" She breathed as she placed a hand to her chest as she calmed. \"Expecting someone else?\" He rose a single brow at her, while she shook her head, she didn't know who she was expecting, she feared for a moment it was that great lumbering man from the hidden room that had grabbed her ankle. \"How did it go?\" Hafwen questioned, her brown eyes locked onto Kay who instantly looked her way once he heard her question and upon seeing both sister's looking to him he started to flounder. \"You can't be down here, come on!\" Behmen interrupted as he then stood, looking to the younger man and receiving a thankful look but when they both looked to the elder sister it was clear by the way her jaw muscle flared and eyes narrowed slightly she already knew it was going to be bad news. \"I'll stay with my sister thank you.\" She turned her gaze from them and remained where she sat, all while her younger sister looked between her sister and the men standing, noting the look of irritation on the knight's face and instantly worrying for her sister. \"Hafwen, I'll be fine!\" She pressed, wishing her sister would go peacefully to save herself any trouble. \"No, it is bad enough all this has happened to you!\" The dark haired sister frowned. \"It'll be over soon, we just have to bare with it and then we can go home and be with father!\" Rhoslyn smiled as she stroked her older sister's shoulder, unknowing as a crippling look of pain flashed across the elders face. Both Behmen and Kay witnessed the look, they watched as she pinched her eyes shut in a cringe before taking a deep breath to calm herself, she then licked her lips and forced a smile onto them before she turned to face her sister. \"Alright, but if I can't stay with you, then Gaius will!\" She pressed and the poor effort of a smile and light tone seemed to work for the younger nodded in agreement with a light smile. Hafwen's feet carried her in a slow trod, she was still incredibly unhappy and uncomfortable with her sister being imprisoned but she felt better knowing Gaius was there to keep her company. The dog was a great companion, a rather daft and gormless animal who had always been very protective, he was quick to bark and lunge in warning at any threat to his owners and most threats were nothing more than raised voices. It was new to see Gaius actually bite, draw blood and be so savage, but then again the new threat to his owners was far worse than a mere raised voice. The elder sister was slightly better knowing Rhoslyn had the security and protection of the herding dog and was no longer alone in the cell, she also had him for warmth should the extra blankets not quite do- but that wasn't what was troubling her. What weighed heavy on her most was that her younger sister did not know about their father and home, the younger thought their father was still ill in bed, tended too by their uncle no doubt in their absence, warm and safe in the family home. Hafwen was glad her sister was unable to see her face the moment she spoke of their father and home for she would have instantly known something was very wrong, but she couldn't let her sister know the truth, not while she was trapped in a cell and separated by bars. The dark haired woman's slow steps came to a halt as her thoughts continued to torment her- indecisive- not over whether to tell her sister or not, but rather when, and the mere thought of having to bring her sister further bad news and pain caused her throat to tighten and the back of her eyes started to tickle in the treat of tears. With a slow, shaky breath, Hafwen lifted both hands and pressed the heels of her palms against her temples, closing her eyes as her cold hands soothed and firm hold helped push back against the building pressure in her skull. \"Are you alright?\" The question was spoken carefully. Both men were concerned for the woman and how she would react, but Kay had to do something, for the Knight would not; and if he was going to he was taking too long to do it. The elder sister did not answer, she heard the questioned and all she could do was give a single cough of a humourless laugh as rage was quick to step in front of her sadness, she wanted to turn and scoff at the man, tell him how stupid a question it was, spit at him that of course she wasn't alright, scream how it was unfair, she could feel the anger in her, it was ferocious and consuming and she knew if she let it out she would get nasty. \"No.\" She finally murmured instead, having fought back the anger that now left her drained. \"I am guessing anything you have to tell me is bad?\" She then sighed as she allowed her hands to drop from her pounding head as she turned to look back at the two that had been trailing behind her carefully. Her face was crestfallen, her eyes tired and blank, everything about her in that moment was utter defeat, her stance limp as if the fight so far had drained the strength from her body, there was no hope left in her, it looked as if in that moment- if someone was to draw back the string of a bow and point an arrow to her head, she would just accept it. \"I'm sorry!\" Kay bowed his head in remorse. \"Hafwen,\" Behmen took a step forwards but he was stilled when she spoke. \"What happens now?\" She spoke in an odd form of calm, no emotion touching her voice and her eyes in a dead stare, not even a frown twitched at her brows. Kay looked from the dark haired woman for a moment and to the knight as a light panic sent a jolt through his chest, he didn't know the woman before him and quite frankly she was scaring him, he feared if he gave the wrong answer that she would suddenly fly at him, she was showing no emotion, nothing he could gauge a reaction from, so instead of treading carefully he didn't tread at all. \"She will be taken to the monastery with the others.\" Behmen answered, he had been apprehensive about touching the subject before hand, but now that he had the elder sister before him and so blank he felt far more unsettled by it. It was odd to think that he would prefer her to be a snivelling mess of tears rather than the calm, empty shell stood before him but at least with tears he could place the thoughts and emotions of a person. The news didn't come as a shock to the sister as she was expecting it to be bad, of course she had hoped and wished for better but luck had yet to change, so like her younger sister had said, they would have to bare with it. Simply with out a word or changing look, she accepted what was said. Hafwen was unaware of how her cold calmness was unnerving the two men before her, to her it was a natural reaction when things got to the point of overwhelming her in such a way, she had no way of possibly expressing it, there was no hysterical crying or fitful rage just a simple nothing. It was an odd sensation of feeling everything so negative and bad that it left her tired and utterly drained to the point of not being able to show anything, not her sadness or pain, but she also didn't reach out for help, she didn't want anyone to know what she felt because she didn't want the comfort, she didn't care. \"What happens at the monastery?\" \"She will be trialled.\" Behmen stated, searching her face and body for any sign of life, any emotion at all that would help him discern what was going on in the woman's head and finally he saw the twitch in her brows, anger, he shouldn't have been relieved by the emotion but it was familiar to him, he had seen it flash across her young face enough times already and it was far better than nothing. \"Tortured you mean!\" She all but spat, a sudden flare of energy finding her as her stance strengthened and she turned more to face the two, her frown growing to a glare as her mind buzzed with new thoughts. \"I know what sick tests are carried out!\" She scowled, her nose crinkling as she looked between the two men, ignoring how the young priest held his hands up in surrender as his eyes grew wide and helpless and mouth opened to speak in defence but fell silent. \"The only way a woman is cleared of witch craft is if she dies during your sick tests!\" \"No!\" Kay shook his head but the sister was on a rampage now. \"Is that the only way my sister will be freed?\" She pressed all while Kay's repeated murmurs of 'no' went unheard or ignored. \"By death?\" \"Hafwen,\" Behmen tried to calm, holding out a hand to try and pause her in her flare of anger, approaching her as if she was a wild horse trapped in a small pen.\"Calm down.\" \"Calm down!?\" She nearly shrieked as she turned on the Knight. \"As if enough hasn't happened already, his pompous group of robed bastards, who have their holy sceptres divinely placed so far up their asses, feel like the power is theirs to ship innocent women off to be slaughtered after listening to the words of murders!\" She yelled, her arm flying out to point at Kay as she spoke of his company and the young man could only gulp back fear as his hands remained up in surrender and face the perfect mixture of shock and fright, but when the sister's furious glare came to rest on him the shock faded and nothing but fear showed openly on his face now that it was him in the firing line. \"Do you even care about that?\" She barked at him and he could only stare in shock. \"You are taking the word of murders!\" she pressed and he gulped, \"What about when the women accused of witch craft are proven innocent, do any of you show any guilt or remorse, do you even care? Truly?\" She stepped towards him and he took a fleeting step back. \"Lives are ruined, families torn apart and no one cares!\" She shouted. \"You reward the bad while striking down the good and for what?\" \"Hafwen!\" Behmen tried again, but all he did was put himself back in the woman's path of fury. \"No!\" She rounded on him, she would not be told to calm down or shut up, not when her feelings were justified and her words valid. \"My sister is innocent!\" She pressed, her eyes moving to look between the pair. \"I am an innocent, hard working, honest person and I am telling you that Rhoslyn is not a witch. A low life, deceitful, murder tells you different and who is it you believe?\" She questioned them both. \"I believe you! \" Kay hurriedly answered, because in all honesty he did, he truly did. \"Do you?\" The sister scoffed. \"Because my sister is still being sent away to be trailed for witch craft!\" Hafwen could almost laugh at the audacity of it all. \"My sister, is innocent,\" She stated, her volume of voice having lowered a fraction. \"What will happen when it is proved?\" She waited a short moment for either to answer but Kay dare not even attempt, nor Behmen. \"Nothing, not even an apology, and we won't even have a life to go back to!\" She placed a hand over her heart as she tried to calm her emotions. \"And where is our justice?\" She scowled. \"Our father was murdered and our home brought to the ground in ashes, everything we cherished and loved is gone!\" Hafwen then gave a dry laugh as she looked away from them both as tears pricked at her eyes once again. \"And the man that caused this? The murder everyone believes, what does he get?...His palm crossed with silver!\" She answered for them, and with nothing more to say she turned and stalked off. Hafwen didn't react when she saw Felson and Debelzaq stood before her nor did she greet them or care how long they had been stood behind her, simply moving past them all and letting her feet and anger carry her, she didn't know where she was going and quite frankly she didn't care. The four men stood in the great stone corridor, shocked to silence as they watched the woman vanish from sight and when she was fully out of view, the elder knight and priest turned their looks back to the other two. Kay blew out a slow shaky breath as the tension left with Hafwen and glanced anxiously at his companions, \"That, was terrifying!\" He then stated. \"I have never seen two grown men, put into such fear by a woman that they looked ready to piss them selves!\" Felson spoke as he stepped towards the other two, finding amusement in their misfortune, \"But, the girl had a point, she isn't wrong in what she said.\" He then shrugged. \"How much did you hear?\" Hafwen sighed, deciding she couldn't sit silently in the same room as the elder Knight when he not only knew but witnessed her out burst. Felson looked over to the woman when she spoke, he had seen her sat on the floor by the fire, hugging her legs to her body as she stared into the flames but now she had turned her head to glance back at him and so he strode slowly towards her, returning the parchment he was pretending to read to the table. \"From 'pompous group of robed bastards, who have their holy sceptres divinely placed so far up their asses' onwards.\" He stated with out care, in fact he had been rather impressed with the comment that he nearly snorted out a laugh of amusement, it was only due to the dire situation his two friends were in that caused him to contain himself. \"Oh,\" was all she then uttered, turning back to face the flames as she realised they had been present for most of her rage. \"You were right in what you said.\" Felson then spoke, hoping to ease the woman some what as he stood next to her and peered into the flames with her. \"Doesn't mean I should have said it.\" Hafwen pressed, giving a shake of her head. \"It needed to be said, I don't think any of them even thought to consider the other consequences.\" The older knight looked down to the woman sat on the floor, he thought her words were valid and she shouldn't feel regret for being brave enough to voice such thoughts and concerns. The elder sister knew he was right, she knew she was right in what she said but still guilt settled with her and had her feeling low. \"Still, there was no need for the way I spoke to them.\" That was what she felt for, how rude she was too the pair. The knight who had helped her from the first moment they met and continued to do still and the young priest who was willing to assist her cause. \"They'll live,\" Felson easily brushed off, \"The burns of their scolding may take a while to heal, but they'll live!\" he gave a shrug and slight smirk but he knew they were big enough to take a tongue lashing and he was positive neither would hold any ill will against her. \"I knew to keep my anger in check because I knew I would get nasty.\" This time she looked up to the knight as she spoke, feeling like she was now confessing to knowing the consequences of her anger and going forwards any way. \"You have every right to be angry.\" The older knight simply shrugged. \"But I shouldn't take it out on everyone!\" She countered to which he nodded in agreement before stating. \"You're not!\" \"No, just the nice ones who genuinely care and want to help.\" She then sighed as she looked away from him and back into the dancing flames. \"To be fair they are the only ones that are going to listen, you may have let anger get the better of you but your words didn't solely come from anger, there was passion there too.\" The knight spoke in a calming manner but his words left no room for questions and so the young woman sat in a moments silence, stumped on what she could reply back to him before she gave a huff in defeat. \"I still need to apologise!\" She shook her head. \"For what?\" The open tone of bafflement caused her to look up at him with her brows raised curiously and at the incredulous look on his face she explained. \"Not for what I said, just the way I spoke to them.\" She lifted her shoulders in a light shrug and the two fell back into silence, their eyes finding the fire once more. \"You any good with a sword?\" Felson broke the silence after a moment and Hafwen found his so question odd and out of place that she nearly laughed, but instead of asking the reason for his question she decided just to answer. \"I have never touched one in my life!\" \"Good!\" The knight nodded. \"Why?\" She then couldn't ignore her curiosity and wanted to know the reasoning for his question. \"A thought just came to me, if you can tear a person apart so easily with nothing but words, imagine what you could do with a blade!\" He looked down at her with a grin, flicking both brows up. \"That is not funny!\" She shook her head at him while the corners of her lips turned up. \"You're smiling!\" He shrugged. \"The way I spoke to them was wrong, stop making light of it!\" She tried to scold him but he was making it an oddly hard task to do. Now that he had made her smile, it was hard to get it off her face. \"Sorry, but I was impressed.\" He admitted. \"If I had spoke to anyone else the way I spoke to Behmen and Kay I would be dragged out, beaten and stoned, so not only did I speak to them so horridly, they allowed it!\" She tried to press after managing to wipe the amusement from her lips. \"Well then, it's their fault!\" Felson shrugged.

It won't seem like it, but keep reading.. Prologue The year is 2007, two years prior to the events of G-force, and the events of clusterstorm. In Los Angeles, there is a pet shop named Elia's Pet Shop. This is the same pet shop from the first film. This book requires you to know the plot of the first film as well as the characters involved. Chapter 1: Four Young Pups It's early Sunday morning and Elia's Pet Shop was closed. The pet shop was located in a plaza, on the corner of a normally busy intersection. Inside the pet shop, near the center of the store, was a terrarium housing guinea pigs. There was little to no light inside, except for the emergency light that is always on, shining on the tank above. Inside the tank, there were two guinea pigs. These pigs just had a litter of four young, and is trying to keep them warm. \"Give me some more bedding,\" said one guinea pig. She is talking to the father, who is gathering bedding for her. The mother, \"Elliot,\" was a short haired light brown, almost orange and white guinea pig. The color pattern in her fur was random, and it had a small shine. The father, \"Marlen\" was an abyssinian guinea pig. He had somewhat rough, long brown and white fur, and had a small mohawk on top of his head. The litter consisted of three boys and one girl. The girl was chocolate brown furred with a lighter brown belly. One male was like Marlen, having rough brown and white fur, as well as being very plump. The other two males were twins. One of the twins was noticeably smaller than the other, but both had short golden brown fur, as well as white fur from the belly that crowned towards their eyebrows. \"Finally... Look at them,\" said Marlen. Elliot didn't respond. \"Are you okay, Elliot?\" \"I'm fine, just a little tired.\" \"Anyone would be after that drama.\" Elliot drew a small smile, \"What should we name them?\" \"I don't know. Three boys and a girl?\" \"I was thinking Lillie for the girl.\" Marlen perked up, \"That fat one looked like me when I was young. I'll name him after my old owner, Hurley.\" \"Hurley?\" \"Yeah, my owner always wore a shirt that said Hurley. So I thought, if I ever had kids, I would name them the same thing.\" Elliot gave a confused, sideways look, then glanced back at the kids. \"What about the twins?\" She points to the smaller pup. \"Why is that one so small? It looks weak and fragile.\" \"I think we found our runt,\" said Marlen. \"Best not to name him.\" \"Marlen!\" \"What? We have to face the reality. Look at him, he can barely move, nevermind have the strength to drink.\" Elliot looks down. \"Okay.. Well, what about the other one?\" \"Hmm..\" Marlen looked around for clues, Elliot soon did the same. Eventually Elliot saw a diagram comparing hamsters to guinea pigs. Elliot proposed, \"How about.. Ven?\" \"Ven? Like a Venn diagram?\" \"But spelled V, E, N. With only one n.\" \"That changes it how? asked Marlen.\" \"It makes it unique.\" \"...fair enough.\" Marlen pointed to the pups. \"Okay. So Lillie, Hurley, and Ven.\" He then looked over towards the runt, \"And him.\" \"We really should name him,\" said Elliot. \"We can worry about that later, get some rest.\" \"But it's-\" \"Nope, rest first.\" \"Okay.\" The weather outdoors was getting stormy, and the wind started rattling the entry door. Elliot remarked, \"Sounds like a storms coming through. I hope it doesn't wake the kids.\" Marlen agrees, then snuggles up with Elliot, prepared to rest. A couple hours pass... A very short first chapter, but does introduce a few key characters.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: Escape! The clock ticked to 9am and the weather was progressively getting worse. Loud thunder started shaking the store, causing the animals inside to get rowdy. A lighting bolt strikes near the store waking Elliot and Marlen. They look out the door and notice the violent wind picking up small debris. Becoming concerned, Elliot and Marlen cuddle to protect the litter. Meanwhile, the roof starts to leak, causing a small drip from the ceiling. The drip soon starts seeping towards the wall, leaking down towards an electrical outlet. The outlet starts popping, and smoke comes out. A burning smell starts to surround the store. The animals inside start to whimper. \"You smell that?\" questioned Marlen. \"Yeah..\" answered Elliot. \"Is something burning?\" \"I don't know.\" More water enters the outlet, and more smoke begins to billow out. Eventually, a small fire breaks out. The bright light catches Marlen and Elliot's attention, and they ran to the corner of the tank to get a better view. The fire began spreading at an alarming rate, towards some plants. The two parents look at each other, fearing what might happen. Elliot glances towards the pups, \"We have to protect them!\" Marlen nods in agreement, then they scurry towards the litter. The fire started spreading towards another animals cage, causing them to whine and screech in pain. Elliot couldn't bear to watch, and closed her eyes tightly. The sound of a fellow animal burning to death haunted Elliot, but soon the screaming subsided, masked by the raging fire. Elliot then opens her eyes to see half the store caught in flames, spreading towards the tank. The fire got closer, and more animals burn. Elliot turns to Marlen and whimpers, \"I-I'm scared.\" Marlen doesn't respond. Instead, he just looks back at her, squeezing tightly, and expecting the end. The building begins to creek, showing signs of instability. A wooden support beam near the guinea pigs tank catches flame, causing it to crack. Soon the ceiling above began to collapse, with debris landing in the terrarium. Elliot and Marlen take cover as dust and ash begin to carpet the tank. Suddenly, the whole support beam itself collapses and crashes onto the table holding the terrarium. The table buckles under the weight, and the terrarium slips off. \"Hold on!\" screamed Elliot as they free fall onto the ground. The terrarium shatters, pieces of glass fly everywhere. Dazed and bleeding, Elliot and Marlen get up to see that the litter got separated around the tank covered in glass and bedding. \"Are you okay?!\" shouted Marlen. He struggles to get up. \"I'm fine,\" responded Elliot, dazed. Marlen gets up and waddles towards Elliot, \"We have to get outta here!\" \"B-but the kids..\" Marlen glances at the fire, still spreading towards them. In between him and the fire, were the children. Forced to accept fate, he exclaims, \"Elliot... we have to go.\" \"W-what?\" Confused and still shocked from the fall, she is unable to give a straight answer. Marlen lifts her up, and begins to run towards the exit. On the way out, Elliot looks back towards the pups, and sees a couple of them moving, and whimpering. Suddenly, Elliot gathers a burst of energy, \"N- no.. no! We're taking them!\" She escapes out of Marlen's grasp. He rebels, \"Elliot, we won't make it out!\" \"We have to try!\" \"How?! We don't have time!\" \"Let's just-\" The ceiling collapses on top of them once more. The two duck in cover and realise they are out of time. \"JUST GRAB WHO YOU CAN AND RUN!\" screamed Elliot. In a hurry, and without thought, Elliot runs back and grabs the larger twin, Ven. Marlen rushes and grabs the female, Lillie. The two pigs scurry across the fiery floor, smoke billowing above their heads, making it hard to breath. Suddenly, the front door came in sight, shattered from collapsed debris. They approach the door and look outdoors. The crashing rain made it hard to see above ground level, but Marlen and Elliot could spot what looked like people outside of their cars, pulled over and on their cell phones with the police department. The couple exit the building and rest outside for a moment before continuing. Elliot puts Ven on the ground next to Marlen, \"Stay here, I'm going back for the others.\" Without reason, Elliot begins to re-enter the building, only to get tugged back outside from Marlen. She turns around to Marlen shaking his head slowly, \"No, I'm not gonna loose you.. too.\" He gives her a peculiar look, hoping to get her to understand the situation, you can't save everyone. Elliot, stares back in denial at first, but then accepts, staring at the ground in hopelessness. Another explosion comes from the building, interrupting the conversation. \"Let's go!\" shouted Marlen. The two guinea pigs pick up their young and run along the side of the building. Luckily, the heavy rain caused a sort of mist, disguising the family as they make their escape. They continue across the street into an alleyway, a safe distance from the fire. Taking a break from running, they turn around to watch the pet shop as it burns down. What happened to the runt, and Hurley?[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: Homeless.. Elliot and Marlen were taking cover next to a dumpster. The trash above was sheltering them from the violent rain. It was still morning, sky dark grey from the storm, and it was really loud from the rain crashing on the ground. The family watched the shop as it burned down, fire so intense that the rain couldn't put it out. Loud screaching is heard from the inside, burning animals forced to face there demise. In the distance, a siren is heard. Soon after, a fire truck came to put out the fire. Marlen turned to see Elliot tending to the kids, \"Are they alright?\" He slowly walks towards her. \"They're cold, but I think they'll live.\" Marlen leans toward Elliot, and rests a hand on her shoulder. \"We only got Ven and Lillie...\" murmured Elliot softly. She lookes over towards the burning plaza in distress. \"We need to keep going,\" said Marlen. \"Where? We don't have a home now.\" \"We can make one, in the wild.\" Elliot gave a puzzled look, \"The wild? Do you even know where that is?\" \"Yes actually, it's to the east.\" \"And do you know which direction east is?\" \"Uh, yes. It's.. that way.\" Marlen points in a random direction. Elliot glared at Marlen, \"No, that's not a valid direction.\" \"Well we can't stay here.\" Elliot turned towards the burning shop again, looking at it in anguish. She contemplates for a moment, then mumbles, \"Let's go,\" Marlen smiled then the two picked up there young and headed up the street using the weather as cover. A few hours pass and the two pigs were still in the city, wandering around aimlessly. The weather had cleared up for the most part, and visibility had increased. \"Let's take a break,\" said Elliot as she stops on the sidewalk. Marlen turns around, \"C'mon we're almost there.\" \"Almost where? We've been walking for hours and everything still looks the same.\" She looks down at Ven, hearing his stomach ache. Elliot sighs, \"We need to eat...\" Marlen began to look around for food, and spots a fast food restaurant down the street. There was a person taking out the trash. Marlen smiles, \"I have an idea.\" Meanwhile, an old lady walking out the restaurant spots the two guinea pigs in the trash can, digging out food. Because of the weather clearing up, the family was easily spotted by the lady. She curiously moves closer to check them out. The old woman then starts looking for something to capture them with. After a few attempts, she sees a cardboard box and smirks as this is the perfect tool for capturing them. She quietly moves closer, trying not to get spotted by the guinea pigs. \"I can't believe we're eating trash!\" shouted Elliot. \"This isn't trash,\" responded Marlen. \"It's survival. And if you want to learn to survive in the wild, you're gonna have to learn to take what you can get.\" The old lady hears them squeaking and spots the family of four, getting ready for the surprise capture. \"It's kill or be killed in the wild, you have to be aware of your surroundings.\" Marlen takes another bite of an old French fry. Elliot watches Marlen as he devours the fries. She smiles, \"Heh, you're such a pig.\" Suddenly the old lady jumps out and quickly smacks the box on top of the family. The guinea pigs start squeaking wildly and scurry around trying to find a way out. She closes the box from underneath, flips it over while keeping it shut, and walks towards her car. She opens the door and puts them in the backseat. So they get kidnapped off the street by some random old lady, where is she taking them? About the runt and Hurley. They survive the fire, and were spotted by a firefighter upon entry of the shop. Elia's pet shop was rebuilt from the ground up to become what was in the movie. It's now its own building, and had new ownership. Upon grand re-opening of the Pet Shop, Ben the Scientist adopts the runt (Darwin) while he was still a pup, leaving Hurley behind with Bucky. Then the events of G-force happen about two years later. Q: How do you know Ben adopts Darwin from Elia's Pet shop specifically? A: In the movie, when Darwin and his team are trying to escape Killian and the FBI near the beginning, they hop into a van labeled Elia's Pet Shop. The Van was doing a supply drop off, which tells me Ben gets his pet supplies from there. This convinced me that Elia's Pet shop was where he purchased Darwin. At least in my mind :) Let's see where the old lady is taking the family[Chapter 4] Chapter 4: The Community It's almost pitch black inside the cardboard box, other than the light from the small opening at the top of the box. \"Be aware of your surroundings? Be vigilant?\" Elliot nagged on. \"What do you call this Marlen!?\" \"I was eating! You expect me to be vigilant in the middle of chowtime?\" \"Um, yes! Now because of you were stuck in this mess.\" \"Me!? Why weren't you being vigilant?\" \"I was watching the kids! To make sure they're safe!\" The old lady driving overhears the loud squeaking in the back. \"They sure seem excited,\" she remarked. Suddenly a cell phone rang. The woman picked it up. \"Hello? Oh hey sweetie... I'm heading home right now... It was nice seeing you too... The dog will be fine, I'll feed him when I get home...\" The family listened in, \"Who do you think she's talking to?\" asked Marlen. \"I don't know,\" responded Elliot. \"But I hope she doesn't mean us when she said feed the dog.\" The two guinea pigs look at each other in worrisome. The ride to the old lady's home lasted hours long and was uneventful. It's late noon, and the family had fallen asleep in the cardboard box. She parks the car in the driveway, and gets out to open the rear door of the vehicle. The old lady picks up the box, waking Elliot. The guinea pigs were in the corner of the box trying to cuddle for security. Marlen was still asleep snoring near the pups. The lady walks through her home towards her backyard. \"Marlen wake up,\" whispered Elliot. The fat guinea pig struggles to roll around, then the box shakes and Marlen does a quick panic. \"Ahh! Don't eat me!\" screamed Marlen in a sudden panic. He spots Elliot confused then takes a deep breath, the box shakes again. \"What's happening?\" \"I think we're here,\" answered Elliot. \"Where's here?\" The old lady walks through the house, heading outside to her backyard. She kneels down, sets the box in the grass, and opens the top. \"Enjoy your new life,\" she said. The old lady stands up, and walks away back towards her home, closing the door. The bright light temporarily blinds the family. They look up in confusion, \"Is she letting us go?\" asked Marlen. \"I don't know,\" answered Elliot as she stared into the sky. She looks at Marlen. He's putting his ear up against the cardboard wall of the box. \"I hear something outside,\" said Marlen. \"We need to get out,\" said Elliot sharply. \"Grab the children!\" Marlen scurries over towards the pups and picks them up. Elliot begins to throw her body onto the wall of the box, slightly tipping it over. Marlen watches then decides to join in, banging his back towards the wall. \"Together!\" shouted Elliot. \"In 3.. 2.. 1..\" Both of the guinea pigs run from one side to the box to the other jumping into the wall at the same time, knocking the box over. Grass gets blown into the box and the family gets the first look outside of the box. Elliot crawls out onto the short grass and is blinded by the light. Once her eyes adjusted and cleared up, she saw what looked like a miniature house. She was then baffled when she looked around and saw multiple small homes. \"What the... tiny houses?\" she whispered to herself. Marlen followed her out in and was in awe. They heard a footstep to the right of them, the family turned sharply towards the sound and saw a group of guinea pigs looking right at them. Behind them was the rest of the miniature houses, soon the family realizes they're in a village of sorts. \"Hi there!\" said the guinea pig in front of the pack. It was a deeper voice, but warm. He was a tri-colored pig with orange, black, and white all over and looked puffy but not fat. The family showed little courage and retreated back into the box. \"Are you guys okay? We're not going to hurt you,\" The pig continued. Elliot peeked outside towards him, \"Uh.. Hi.. Who are you?\" \"My name's Hector, welcome to our village.\" \"Village?\" responded Elliot. \"Yup. This place is our home, built by the breeder.\" \"Breeder? W-what I'm confused.\" \"The lady that brought you here is who we call the breeder, she's been taking care of us for a few years now.\" The family gathers some bravery and comes out into the open, looking around. Hector spots Marlen but the pups caught his attention. Another guinea pig reveals themselves next to Hector, \"You guys just had a couple of pups?\" It was a female black and white guinea pig. \"U-Uh, yes,\" answered Elliot. \"Look's like they haven't been fed all day.\" The pig started walking towards the family to aid them. Elliot and Marlen both take a step back in distrust. The female pig stopped and was concerned, \"What's wrong?\" \"I just would like some answers on what's going on here.\" Hector intervened, \"I can answer any questions you have, if it-\" He was cutoff by two smaller guinea pigs who shoved past him. They were both tricolored and were clearly children. \"Tyler! Neal!\" squawked Hector. The female pig rushed in, grabbing the children, and held them back. \"Kids, calm down!\" shouted the female. The two excited pups looked at her, \"I wanna meet the new people,\" said Tyler. \"You can soon enough, but they just got here. Let them settle in..\" \"Angel, take the kids inside,\" said Hector towards the female pig. Angel looks at the two pups, and brought them away towards the biggest house in the area. Elliot and Marlen just stood there in slight concern, still confused on what's happening. Once the three pigs cleared the area, Hector re-focused his attention back to Elliot and Marlen. \"I-I'm sorry, that was my spouse and my two sons,\" Hector continued. \"Yeah, still pretty young so they're interested in anything that happens here.\" \"Those were you're children?\" asked Elliot. \"Mm-hmm, they would be my third litter. I just had my fourth litter a few days ago actually. On that one we had two boys, Kelvin and Tibbetts. And one girl, Julie.\" The family looked baffled on how they could have so many kids. \"So about those questions, walk with me through the village and I can explain everything.\" Hector turned around and started walking along the main dirt path. Elliot and Marlen looked at each other wondering if they should follow. Hector turned his head while walking, \"C'mon.\" The family started moving and caught up to Hector. Elliot first asked a question, \"So where are we exactly?\" \"We are in the hills of California just northeast of Los Angeles, I'm figuring you guys are from there?\" \"Yes, we're from a pet shop in the city.\" \"Was your family bought?\" \"U-Um, no..\" Hector paused momentarily curious on what happened. \"There was a fire.. I-In the pet shop, our terrarium broke and we barely made it out alive. Later we got picked up by that lady, she put us in that box.\" \"Wow a fire, so you guys are rescues.\" \"If you wanna call it that.\" Elliot rolled her eyes. \"I would say so.. You see, this village is full of people like you. Each one has a story.. Abandoned owners, neglected, abused. The breeder picks up these poor souls and places them here, so they could live a peaceful life with their own kind. Human's can be.. kind of aggressive, but also very kind, in our case at least.\" \"So what's with the houses?\" \"I was just about to get to that. The breeder has a hobby of craft making, she builds these houses for us to live in. She also has a son that does architecture.\" \"Wait.. She builds them, individually!? There's like thirty houses here!\" \"Twenty-two actually, soon going to be twenty-three for you guys.\" \"We get a house? Like to call our own?\" \"Yup, pretty great huh? Each group of pigs get there own home, one per family... So about you, what's your name?\" \"Elliot.\" \"Elliot?\" Hector looks to the father guinea pig holding the pups. \"Marlen,\" said Marlen nervously. \"What about these two rascals?\" asked Hector. \"The male is named Ven, Lillie the female,\" answered Elliot. \"Great names, I think you guys will fit in just fine with us.\" Elliot smiles, then looks around. \"So how many people are here?\" \"I actually haven't done a headcount recently, but I'm gonna say around thirty somethin..\" \"How long have you been here?\" \"Me and Angel have been here since the beginning of the village. We were the original guinea pigs owned by the breeder and used to live inside that house.\" Hector points towards the old lady's home. \"One day, she built a huge two story model home and couldn't store it inside, so instead she put it back here, and put us in the home. We still live there to this day.\" Hector looks over to the biggest home in the village. It's the largest and only two story home in the village. \"Soon after my first litter, the breeder realized she needed more space for us to live and built another home. And it wasn't long after that she started buying, or in many cases, rescuing guinea pigs to put here with us. Each of them with a home to live in.\" Elliot and Marlen start smiling, relieved that finally they're safe. \"It's been about three years now..\" Elliot looked to Hector. \"S-Sorry,\" spurted Elliot. \"But just how old are you?\" \"I'm five now.\" Elliot and Marlen eyes open slightly in surprise. Hector looks down as if embarrassed. \"Don't feel bad, you look amazing for your age,\" said Elliot. \"Thanks, Angel says the same thing... Do you have any more questions?\" \"No, but I am curious,\" wondered Elliot. \"Where do we live?\" \"The breeder is probably building your home as we speak, usually it takes a couple days.\" \"I see.\" \"Until then, you guys can live with me.\" \"Really? Do you guys have space for us?\" \"Most definitely. Here, follow me.\" The group of guinea pigs start walking to the wooden, two-story home. \"You guys are going to be downstairs in the living room,\" explained Hector. Elliot asked, \"Will your family mind? I really don't want my kids to be a bother..\" \"Don't worry, we have newborn pups ourselves. Angel's been taking care of kids for a few litters.. She could actually give you a few pointers.\" While the group walks towards the home, Elliot and Marlen take a look at their surroundings. They study the other guinea pigs as they go about their day. Soon they notice a few of them gathered near a shack in the corner of the yard up against the fence to the neighbor's. \"E-Excuse me, Why is everyone near that shack?\" asked Marlen. \"Oh, I almost forgot,\" answered Hector. \"That's where we get our food rations. The breeder comes and refills the food daily every morning so we have plenty to eat. Whenever you guys are hungry, just head over there and grab some, okay?\" The two guinea pigs nodded in agreement. Hector's Home The group arrives at the house and Hector invites them inside. The house was two stories high, and had a spiral staircase going from the first floor to the second. It also had a step-down in the living room. Angel was seen in the living room with a couple of small pups. She turns around, \"Hey!\" shouted Angel. \"Hey Angel,\" answered Hector. \"The new family is here with me.\" The family walks into the house and takes a look around. \"Hi guys, welcome,\" said Angel. Hector re-introduced the family, \"This is Elliot, that's Marlen, they little ones are named Ven, and Lillie. They're going to stay with us until their house is ready, is that okay?\" \"I'm fine with it,\" answered Angel. The family walks into the living room. Hector looks over towards Marlen, who was a little nervous. \"Hey, Marlen.\" said Hector, patting his hand on Marlen's shoulder. \"Yes?\" \"Can I take you upstairs and show you around?\" \"U-Uh sure.\" Marlen hands the pups to Elliot and walks up the staircase with Hector chatting on the way up. Meanwhile, Elliot sits near Angel, apologizing for acting nervous. \"I-I'm really sorry about earlier.. was just really scared for my family and myself.\" \"You're fine, I would be scared too if I went to a brand new place with newborn pups.\" Elliot smiled and looked toward the staircase. \"It's really cool that you have a staircase.\" \"Yeah, the breeder makes these model homes designed for humans, but it so happens to be the perfect size for us rodents.\" Elliot takes a look at the pups in Angel's arms, and asked for their names. \"The brown one is named Kelvin, the black and white one is named Tibbetts,\" said Angel. Both were males, one of them was a tricolor, the other was like it's mother; black and white in a oreo cookie color mix. The two continued to talk until interrupted by Marlen screaming from the second floor. Hector's two sons, Tyler and Neal were jumping onto Marlen and playing roughly. Everyone laughs and the day passes uneventfully. So the old lady is a guinea pig breeder! The first decently long chapter and the last being somewhat kid friendly. This chapter introduces the whole village that our characters live in. Hector is the village leader, along with his spouse Angel. Tyler and Neal are their 8 month old kids (8 years old in human years). They also have 3 more young (Kelvin, Tibbetts, Julie). They are all 4 days old. The village itself is basically a bunch of model homes sitting in this ladies backyard. I wonder if they have power.. Probably not. My estimate: For a guinea pig 1 month to them is roughly 1 year to us. Guinea pigs live 5-7 years, so that's translates roughly to 60-84 human years.. makes sense![Chapter 5] WARNING: THE REMAINDER OF THE BOOK IS RATED M FOR LANGUAGE, AND VIOLENCE. READ ON YOUR OWN DISCRETION thank you Chapter 5: Alexei Elliot slowly opens her eyes, and turn's towards the window to see the morning light. She then turn's towards Marlen, and notices her young have disappeared. She suddenly fully awakes in a quick panic, desperately looking around for the young pups. After a few moments of silence, she hears noises coming from the staircase area. She peaks over the couch and sees Ven trying to climb the stairs. Lillie was sitting in the other corner playing on the wall. She taps on Marlen, waking him up. \"Hey, look,\" whispered Elliot. She points at Ven and Lillie. \"Wow, they're already mobile,\" responded Marlen. After a few moments, Marlen walks up the stairs to see if anyone else is awake. He suddenly shouts from above, \"Hey! Everyone's gone!\" Elliot, confused, begins to look around. She hears noises coming from outside. Curiously, she looks out the window and spots everyone walking together. They seem to be gathering towards the food shack. \"Grab the kids.. I think I know where they're at,\" said Elliot. Each parent grabs hold of a pup and heads outdoors towards the shack. The Food Shack The family arrives to see the massacre of food taking place. Guinea pigs are seen taking handful's of food and shoving it in their mouths. Some are grabbing the food and sitting next to the shack, other's walking back to their homes with the food. Elliot scans the crowd for Hector, soon spotting him sitting left of the crowd eating with his family. Elliot and Marlen head in their direction getting noticed by Angel. \"Hey! Good morning!\" said Angel enthusiastically. \"I see we're missing out on some grub,\" responded Elliot. \"Yes you are,\" said Hector. \"Go and get some.\" Elliot looks to the crowd distastefully. Marlen spoke out, \"Stay here, I'll get some for us.\" He hands one of the pups to Elliot, then leaps towards the mouth watered crowd trying to get to the food. Meanwhile, Elliot sits and lets Ven and Lillie play with the other pups in the area. Lillie starts heading towards the crowd of pups trying to get some attention. She falls over into a slightly chubbier pup. He was a Abyssinian pig with longer, fluffier hair. Her fall was cushioned by the fur, and the pup helps her back up. Ven sits near the pups, but not interacting with them. Instead he studies the area and starts snooping around. Elliot and Angel watch them as they play. \"Aren't they the most precious things,\" remarked Angel. \"Yeah,\" responded Elliot. \"I still can't believe we lucked out on coming here.. You know, me and Marle-\" She was interrupted by the back door opening from the breeders home. The old lady emerges from the house, carrying a large model wooden home. She starts walking through the village. \"Whoa,\" hollered Hector. \"She made your home in one night. That's almost record breaking.\" \"That's our house?\" questioned Elliot. \"Yup.\" The breeder took the home and placed it near the back of the village, but still next to the main dirt path. The placement of the house created a sort of cul-de-sac at the end of path. Marlen re-emerges from the pack of guinea pigs with a handful of food. \"Marlen look!\" sputtered Elliot. She points to the breeder and the home. \"That's our house!\" Marlen turns towards the breeder, \"W-what?\" He almost drops the food in pure shock, but quickly regains stance and looks at Elliot in excitement. Hector stood up, \"Whelp, Let's check it out guys!\" The breeder walks back towards and past the guinea pigs, heading indoors once more. \"Angel, can you watch the kids?\" asked Hector. \"Sure.\" Hector turns towards Elliot. \"Is it okay with you if we leave your pups here to play while we check out the house?\" Elliot looks to the area with the pups. He continues, \"Angel will keep good watch of them.\" \"It's fine, I trust her.\" They start making their way to the home. Elliot sees Marlen struggling not to drop the food. \"Why are you bringing all the food with you?\" asked Elliot. \"I'm hungry.\" \"You couldn't wait until we get back?\" \"Nope.\" Marlen proceeds to shove his face the whole walk there. Back at the shack, Angel is still eating and watching the pups. Lillie is chasing the other pups playfully, and Ven is watching from afar. He sees a opening behind the shack, and tries to walk in that direction. Angel sees him and takes him back to the pups, putting him in the middle of the small pack. He immediately starts making his way back towards the shack. \"You're a persistent one,\" said Angel as she takes him back to the pack again. Ven looks around at the pups, he starts feeling uncomfortable and starts drawing away towards the shack once more. The black and white pup, Tibbetts, approaches him. Ven immediately smacks him to the ground. Tibbetts starts crying, getting Angels attention. Ven quickly moves away out of sight and heads towards the shack. He walks all the way through and sees an exit to the village. Once out, he felt a breeze from open air, and saw the luscious landscape. He looked left and saw a house, A dark brown house secluded outside from the rest of the village. Ven start's crawling towards it. Meanwhile Elliot, Marlen, and Hector arrive at the house. \"Okay,\" said Hector towards the family, \"I'll let you do the honors.\" Elliot walked up to the doorstep of the home, and slowly opens the door. The home was barren; no furniture but was very clean and smelled fresh of wood glue. There was a ladder near the hallway leading towards the rooms. The ladder led up to a indoor balcony, a window at the end of the balcony. \"Oh wow,\" Elliot remarked. \"But it's so empty.\" \"It's up to you to furnish the house,\" said Hector. \"There's usually some supplies leftover from building these houses near the shack, head over there and grab some.\" Elliot walks over to the big window near the front door and looks out. She can see the outside of the village; a small slope at the end of the backyard leading down to a huge valley that extends almost a mile downrange, full of trees and forestry. She looks behind the fence outside of the village, another model house, secluded from the rest. It was dark brown in color and had a front porch with a roof. \"Who's house is that?\" asked Elliot. Hector walked over and saw the house she was pointing to, \"Now that house belongs to one guinea pig you shouldn't talk to.\" Elliot's face puzzled. \"Are they bad?\" \"Well, maybe... The guinea pig that lives there is the only guinea pig who came here un-invited. I don't even think the breeder knows he's here. His name's Alexei.\" \"Alexei? Where'd he come from?\" \"Again I don't know. Although, you could tell from his voice and attitude, he's not from around here. When we first saw him, we naturally accepted him in and allowed him to stay. He then asked if he could use our supplies to build a home.\" \"Wait.. he built his own house?\" \"Yes, and it only took a few days too. I've never seen anyone able to do that.\" \"That's cool, why'd he decide to build it over there?\" \"Well.. Alexei doesn't socialize with us. Every time we try heading over there to see what he's up too, he shoves us away. In worst cases, he threatens us. Really, we only see him occasionally getting food. The good thing is he hasn't demanded much since he got here a few months ago, so we just leave him be.\" \"I see.\" \"He's a special one, but for your safety, I would stay clear of him. Who knows what he could do.\" \"We won't get near him.\" Hector looks towards Elliot, and smiles. \"Well, let's check out the rest of the home.\" At Alexei's home Ven approaches the wooden house and sits near it, looking at the porch. Ven then starts wondering around the home and spots a window. He slowly approaches the window. Even though he is pup, Ven was able to jump up towards the window frame. He grabs on and takes a peek inside. The house was furnished, had a large couch up against the wall, and what looked like a table or workbench on the other side. Suddenly, a creek was heard near the front of the home. Ven adjusted and turned towards the noise. A guinea pig foot popped up from around the corner, then soon the whole body. It was a dark brown agouti guinea pig. He had a white muzzle going from his nose to his forehead, It's Alexei. He looked sharply onto Ven, then bursted, in a very foreign accent, \"FUCKING SHIT!\" The angry pig walked off his porch towards Ven. Ven, showing no emotion or fear ignores Alexei and continues to look into the house. Alexei approaches mumbling to himself, \"Fucking parent's can't even keep eye on their children.\" Alexei continues to mumble, but now in russian. He comes up next to Ven, looking at him with disappointment. Alexei grabs Ven and shoves him off the window, throwing him away from the house. Ven lands hard and rolls a few times. He shrugs a bit, then sits back up, looking at Alexei with a very displeasured look. Alexei lashed out, \"What? You going to cry? Go away.\" Alexei turns his back and walks away, mumbling to himself again. Ven refocuses his attention to the window and starts crawling towards it again. As Alexei walks up the porch, he spots Ven hopping on the window once more. \"Whoa, no no get down!\" He starts racing towards Ven. \"Get the FUCK off!\" screamed Alexei as he grabs the back of Ven's fur and backlashes him with the knuckles from his paw. Ven spins off the window, slamming on the ground, face down and motionless. Alexei looks pity onto Ven, staring at the lifeless body. He sighs, then reaches for the pup. Suddenly Ven comes to life and turns around looking up at Alexei, un-effected. Alexei freezes in shock and is speechless. Ven looks at the window once more and crawls to it. Alexei stares onto Ven with confusion, then looks at his paw, wondering how Ven is still conscience after being hit in the face with that much force. He tightens his fist and starts walking towards the front porch, curious to see if Ven makes it inside. As Alexei enters his home, he sees Ven crawling through the window successfully. Ven grabs the couch near the window to get grip and starts pulling himself into the home. Shortly after, he rolls down onto the soft couch and bounces. He looks around the house for a little bit, then at Alexei. \"You're dedicated aren't you?\" said Alexei. Ven turned his eyes to the couch, soon falling on his side and dozing off. Alexei watched Ven for a few moments as he fell asleep, then picked him up onto his arms. He then starts walking back towards the village to return the pup. The Food Shack As Alexei enters the village, the villagers move out of his away in fear, others just give a dirty look. He is spotted by Angel, who is still tending care to the other pups. Her expression shows worry and fear, and is baffled by the fact that Alexei is carrying Ven. Alexei stops in front of her, grabs Ven and drops him on the floor in front of Angel. Ven instantly wakes up and sharply looks towards Angel. \"I'm assuming this is yours?\" said Alexei sternly. \"U-Um.. yes.\" responded Angel nervously. Alexei just stares at Angel, almost in boredom. \"Is he your son?\" asked Alexei. \"What? N-no I was watching them for their parents.\" Alexei smiles a bit. \"Well you're a shit babysitter.\" Angel looked down at Ven. \"I'm sorry, I was watching a bunch at a time.\" \"Don't apologize, I don't take sympathy.\" \"Oh.\" \"What's his name?\" \"It's uhh.. Ven.\" \"Ven... Smart I'll give him that, given his age.\" \"Oh.. uhh, thanks?\" Alexei turns away from her, as if he really didn't want to continue the conversation. He then starts walking back towards his house. \"He's also very persistent,\" spurted Alexei. \"I've noticed...\" murmured Angel, agreeing with him. Ven starts to roam around once more, mainly towards Alexei. Angel notices and holds back Ven, \"No Ven, not again!\" Angel picks up Ven and returns to the pack of pups. As she does so, Ven looks towards Alexei in the distance, squirming around trying to go back. Angel was starting to get really annoyed with the pup, and carelessly puts Ven down. She then looks over towards the village and sees Elliot, Marlen, and Hector returning from the newly built home. Angel quickly gets her act together to make it seem like she had the situation under control the whole time. Elliot, Marlen, and Hector, are walking back from there newly built house. Hector was next to Elliot and Marlen was trailing behind. \"Yeah, later today we can gather some supplies and start building furniture,\" said Hector towards Elliot. Everyone looks ahead and sees Angel, smiling with the pups. \"Hey! How was the house?\" asked Angel. \"Everything was fine, no defects,\" answered Hector. He continued, \"How were the pups, did they behave?\" Angel looked towards the pack of pups, specifically at Ven. Ven stares back sharply, with a slightly agitated appearance. She answered, \"Yes... they were fine, no issues.\" \"That's good to hear... Do you mind helping us later building some furniture? I know you have some good ideas.\" \"Yeah sure, but what about the kids?\" \"I can get someone to watch them in the meantime.\" Elliot stepped in, \"How long will it take?\" Hector answered, \"Well, If all four of us start later tonight, we could get the essentials done by morning. Think you can put in the work?\" \"Of course.\" Elliot looks at Hector and nodded her head in agreement. She starts looking back towards Marlen. \"Hey, did you hear-\" Marlen was nowhere to be seen. Elliot glanced around trying to spot him. \"U-Uh where did he..\" She soon spots him in the crowd stuffing his face with food. Elliot's face filled with dismay, as she watches him eat. \"You know, I'm not even mad.\" Elliot and Marlen's Home Nightfall approaches, all of the supplies have been gathered, and the four guinea pigs are building furniture in the new home. Hector is in the living room, showing Marlen how to build a table. Ven and Lillie are in the corner of the living room near the window, gated off so that they couldn't run around. Elliot and Angel are seen in one of the rooms trying to build a bed. \"OK..\" spoke Angel. \"Hand me a nail.\" Elliot turned to the stack of supplies and grabs a small nail. As she picks it up, a large explosion is heard outside, it echoes throughout the village. Elliot and Angel both turn towards the window to investigate the noise. \"Where was that from?\" asked Elliot. A second smaller explosion is heard, it came from Alexei's home. \"Oh,\" murmured Angel. \"It's Alexei doing his experiments or something.\" \"Experiments?\" \"No one knows for sure.. He's always building something, or working on a project.\" \"I would like to know what he is building to be causing things to explode.\" \"Me too..\" As they discuss, Ven gets up and curiously peeks out the window towards Alexei's house. He peers at the home, wondering what's happening inside. A third explosion is seen, the light glares off Ven's eyes, but his expression doesn't change. The next morning . The sun comes up, shining into the house. Everyone is asleep, except for Ven, who woke up earlier than the rest. He looks around the gated area he is confined in. He crawls up towards the gate, then turns towards Lillie to see if she is still asleep. Ven turns his attention to the gate, and gazes towards the top of the wooden gate. He begins to climb and, almost effortlessly, makes it over and lands on the floor. He checks to see if he woke up anyone, then makes his way outdoors. The morning breeze rushes through Ven's fur as he looks around in the village. No one is around, as everyone is still asleep. Ven quickly spots Alexei's home, somewhat obstructed by another house and starts roaming towards it. Ven comes up to the nearby home and quietly gets behind it. He then peers around the corner to get a better view of Alexei's house. Alexei is seen off his front porch looking at a tree that's near the fence to the neighboring yard. He is wearing something to what appears to be a belt around his waist, although unclear from the distance Ven was at. Ven, curious, begins to move closer towards the brown guinea pig. Suddenly, Alexei moves very sharply, taking something out of the belt and aims it towards the tree. Ven stopped suddenly to see what was happening. Three distant pops came from the object Alexei was carrying, followed by Alexei cart-wheeling to the side. Once again three more pops came from the small object. Pieces of wood chipped off the tree at the same time the noises were heard. Finally, two more pops came from the unknown object, then Alexei suddenly puts it back into his belt. After a few more moments of Alexei studying the tree, he begins to make his way back inside his home. Ven, once more continues on towards the house, eager to find out what Alexei is up too. At Alexei's home Alexei walks inside his home, and gets into his living room. He starts to unbuckle the belt he was wearing and puts it onto the table near his couch. Feeling tired after a workout, Alexei throws himself onto the soft, makeshift couch and begins to doze off. Suddenly, Ven appears on the window, peeking into the dark wooden home. He spots the belt Alexei was wearing, and notices the bulky pouch on the side of it. Curious to see more, Ven hops off the window and makes his way around the front of the home, and gets onto the porch. The woods creaks as Ven progresses up the small steps. He attempts to stand up straight to look around, he wobbles but successfully keeps balance. Slowly, Ven creeps up against the wall, towards the front door. It was open, due to the wind pushing it around. He enters the home to be greeted by a small hallway that leads left and right. The left side was dark, and led into a room that had the windows covered to keep light out. The right side was much brighter and it led to the living room. Ven looked both ways but goes towards the living room. As he slowly roams around the corner, he spots Alexei, on his couch napping. The living room was a little cramped but everything was able to fit. On the left was a workbench, up against the corner. On the right was the couch. An L-shaped couch that followed down the wall, under the window, then straight out towards the center of the room. Next to the couch was a wooden table. On top of the table was a leather belt with a pouch. Ven glares at the pouch and slowly crawls towards it, trying not to wake up Alexei. He approaches the pouch, grabs onto the table, and lift's himself up to get a better look. The pouch was dark brown, the same color as the rest of the belt. It appears to be closed by a small pin. Eager to see what's inside, Ven pulls the latch that's on the pin, and the flap opens, revealing the contents inside. The object inside was black, and looked like it fit snug in the pouch. There was a second item as well, in its own snug compartment. Ven picks up the pouch and brings it closer to get a better look. Suddenly, the two items slip out of the pouch and onto the floor, making a loud thud. The mysterious item is a pistol, and the pouch turned out to be a holster! A black Makarov on the ground, and next to it, a magazine, with ammo loaded! The Makarov had black grips and a star on the grip, as well as a magazine in it. The loud thud awoke Alexei, and he spots Ven on the floor next to the holster, holding the pistol, looking down the barrel. It took a second for Alexei to realize the situation, then suddenly bursts out in a panic. \"W-wha, whoa whoa!\" Alexei gets off the couch and rushes towards Ven. He snatches the pistol from Ven and shoves him aside. \"What the fuck are you-, how the fuck-\" He stops short and glares sharply at Ven. Meanwhile Ven sits there motionless, watching Alexei put the gun away back into the holster. Alexei turns and tosses the gun towards the couch, then returns his attention on Ven. He rolls his eyes and sighs, \"What do you want, why are you back?\" He kneels down in front of Ven. Ven gives no response, but does turn his head towards the holster and reaches his hand towards it. Alexei quickly smacks it down, \"No! That is a dangerous weapon, it will kill you if-\" Ven, blatantly ignoring Alexei, begins to crawl around him towards the pistol. Alexei sighs again and thought to himself, \"Holy shit what the fuck is wrong with this kid.\" Ven attempts to climb on the couch and reach for the pistol, but was too slow as Alexei snatches it from his reach. Ven reaches his arm towards the weapon once again. Alexei thought for a moment, then an idea popped in his head. \"You really want this?\" said Alexei. \"Here, let me show you why this is bad.\" He wraps the belt around his waist and grabs Ven, carrying him to the front of the house. Outside in front of the porch, Ven is thrown from Alexei's arms out beside him. Alexei un holsters the pistol, looks at it, then back at Ven. Ven stares at the Makarov as it waived around in the air. Alexei takes the magazine out, there are no rounds. He opens the holster to a special compartment and takes out a separate magazine, fully loaded with eight rounds. He loads it into the gun, then takes the old magazine and puts it in the compartment. Alexei pauses for a moment, then flips the safety to 'fire' and cocks the weapon. Ven continues to glare at the weapon, curious on what's happening. After another pause, Alexei aims the gun towards Ven, and almost without thought, presses the trigger. A ear piercing sound echoed along the tree line. The bullet whizzes past Ven into the ground next to him. Ven's ears start ringing, and tumbles over to his side, disoriented from the loud bang. He squirms around on the grass from pain. Alexei smiles and fires two more rounds into the ground in front of Ven. The ringing intensified, and Ven was almost completely immobilized in shock. \"And now you know,\" uttered Alexei. He sets the safety on the gun and re-holsters it. Alexei returns to his home leaving Ven outside. He takes off the belt and holster and tosses them onto the couch, then returns outside. Alexei looks onto the spot Ven was sitting. He wasn't there. \"What the-\" murmured Alexei to himself as he starts looking around in search of Ven. \"Maybe I scared him off...\" He steps out fully onto the porch and looks around with no luck of finding the young pup. He smirks in self accomplishment, then turns around towards his front door. As he enters his home, he was interrupted by a creaking noise to his left. Alexei turns his attention to his porch steps and was boggled by what he saw. Ven, almost unaffected, was climbing the porch stairs to follow Alexei into his home. The baffled Alexei thought to himself, \"He's not affected by the sound of a gun? He just shook it off in seconds..\" He watches the brown guinea pig successfully climb the stairs and begins to walk towards Alexei, resting next to him. \"He's just a pup and already has the strength to walk..\" Alexei walks indoors towards the living room and keeps the door open for Ven. Ven, not surprisingly, follows Alexei indoors and once again sits next to him. \"He also has a very strong attachment to me.\" Ven looks up at Alexei, with no expression, almost as if he's studying the pig. Alexei notices this, and looks onto Ven. He remarks, \"You're special Ven.. You have the potential to be something great... Ya know, back home you would be a perfect candidate for-\" He stops suddenly and looks at the holster in the living room. It had cryllic writing on the side reminding Alexei where he's from. He looks back at Ven, determined. \"You are going to be something great.\" He quickly picks up Ven and begins to make his way towards the village in a rush. Fun Fact: This chapter was so long that I had to split it up. Even then it's still a decently long chapter; the longest thus far. So wait? Who is Alexei? Where did he come from? A Makarov? They make pistols for guinea pigs?[Chapter 6] Chapter 6: Gifted At The Village Everyone is still asleep as Alexei enters the village. He searches the area for the biggest home, Hector and Angels home. He spots the two story home and marches his way towards it. Alexei approaches the front door and knocks loudly without hesitation. Inside, Hector awakes groggy and confused by the noise. He gets up and begins to make his way downstairs. Alexei, getting impatient, puts Ven down and kicks the door open. Hector shrieks is surprise and backs away from the door. Alexei enters the home and is spotted by Hector. \"Alexei?!\" sputtered Hector. \"W-What the hell do you want!?\" \"I need to ask you something.\" \"OK... Why did you kick the door open?\" \"I was getting impatient.\" \"I'm walking down the stairs! You couldn't wait ten more seconds?\" \"No, this is important.\" \"Also, there's no locks on these doors, you could've just opened it..\" Alexei pauses and turns towards the splinted door. \"It seemed more fun.\" \"More fun!? Damn, Alexei now we have to-\" Hector notices another pig enter the house. It was Ven. \"Ven? What's he doing here?\" \"I brought him here.\" \"What?.. Why? You kidnapping pups now?\" \"Isn't he yours?\" \"No, he's Elliot and Marlen's kid.\" \"Where are they?\" \"Why do you wanna know?.. Better said, why do you have their kid?\" \"Don't worry about it.\" \"I will.. Their safety is in my hands.\" \"Well then, I'm kicking every door down till I find them.\" Hector hesitates for a moment looking Alexei eye to eye. \"Alexei, I-I can't let you do that.\" \"Come here and stop me then.\" Alexei stands ground as he watches Hector make a move. Hector pauses for a moment and begins to feel overwhelmed by Alexei's aggression. \"I... can't,\" shrugged Hector. \"Okay then, where do they live?\" \"They're the newest family here, so look for the freshly built house in the far corner of the village.\" Hector points in the direction of the home. \"That way.\" Alexei smirked, \"Thanks.\" He picks up Ven and exits the house, attempting to close the door behind him. Hector sits on the floor, relieved that no real conflict took place. \"Alexei, what are you up too?\" Hector murmured to himself. Meanwhile, Alexei walks around the sleepy village trying to spot the home Hector was talking about. He stops searching at the fact that all of the homes look the same. He turns his attention on Ven, who is reaching out to a particular house. \"This one?\" spoke Alexei. Ven continues to stretch his arm out to the home. Alexei smiles, and begins walking towards it. He approaches the newly built home and knocks on the door. Footsteps were quickly heard inside the home, a few seconds later the door opened. It was Elliot, groggy from just waking up. Before a word even came out of her, she saw Ven in Alexei's arms. \" Ven!? \" spurted Elliot. Almost immediately, she regained full conscience and sharply turned towards the pen that was holding both Ven and Lillie. The pup wasn't there, but instead in this strangers arms. She looks down in confusion, then returns her attention back on Ven, who is looking at her. \"How did you get out?\" she asked, as if Ven was going to answer back. She then gives her attention to Alexei, \"I-I'm so sorry if he caused any trouble.\" \"Oh he did,\" answered Alexei. Elliot's expression changed, knowing that the conversation may not be pleasant. \"But don't apologize, are you his mother?\" \"Yes.\" \"I want to say you have a very special pup here.\" \"Uh.. thanks.. Who are you?\" \"I'm your neighbor, I live over there.\" Alexei points towards his home in the distance. Elliot's expression changed into confusion, then turned towards the dark brown guinea pig. \"Um, that's Alexei's home I believe,\" said Elliot. \"That's me..\" \"Wait.. You're Alexei?\" \"I am.\" Elliot paused for a moment, then cleared her mind. \"What are you doing with Ven?\" \"He came to me, this is twice now.\" \"Twice!?\" Elliot shook her head, \"C-can I have him back?\" \"Well.. This is going to sound a bit harsh, but I'm taking your son.\" \"Wait, what.. Why?\" \"Like I said, he's a very special pup. His mental and physical skills are beyond most at his age. I'm going to raise him myself, and train him to be something great.\" Elliot stares into Alexei, not understanding what he's talking about. \"Well I appreciate the kind words about Ven, but I'm not gonna let you take my son.\" Elliot begins to reach for Ven and yanks him out of Alexei's arms. Alexei allows her but remarks. \"I don't think that's your choice to make.\" She puts Ven on the ground behind her and turns back to Alexei, \"Well it's definitely not yours.\" \"Correct.\" Elliot raises her eyebrow in puzzlement. She thinks to herself, \"This guy is nuts..\" She then glances down and sees Ven crawling out the door towards Alexei. Alexei gave a reassuring look, as if he knew that was going to happen. \"See?\" said Alexei. \"This is what I had to deal with since yesterday.\" \"What did you do to him?\" demanded Elliot. \"I didn't do shit, he's extremely attached to me for some reason.\" \"Maybe you brainwashed him in one of your experiments.\" \"W-what the fuck? Experiment? Lady what kinda pig you think I am?\" \"A psychopath who condemns himself from the rest of the village and conducts experiments on children!\" \"Damn girl! Who tells you this shit?\" \"I've heard a lot of things about you..\" \"Fuck well you know at least I'm nice enough to tell you I'm taking the damn kid. I've shoulda just kidnapped him and called it good so I don't have to deal with your shit.\" There was a momentary pause in the conversation. \"You're not taking Ven,\" exclaimed Elliot. Alexei sighs, \"Listen.. When Ven first came up to my home yesterday, I didn't want to deal with him, so I brought him back.\" \"Who did you bring him back too?\" \"I brought him back to that one black and white pig... Angel.\" \"Angel? Yesterday?\" \"Yeah, when everyone was eating. That shit show of a babysitter didn't know how to handle herself when I dropped him off.\" \"Well that explains why she was acting a bit weird..\" \"Excuse me?\" interrupted Alexei. \"N-nothing.. go on.\" \"Anyway, earlier this morning, I see this little shit again, messin with my stuff. After many attempts to make him leave, he ended up just sticking by my side. I've learned since then, that he was no ordinary pup. He gives off this strong willed, determined vibe, which, back home, are perfect traits to become a warrior.\" \"A warrior? He's just a pup, what is he gonna fight?\" \"Not fight, protect.\" \"Okay... 'Protect' what?\" \"The village.. maybe..\" He glances down at Ven. \"He's gifted, and has a capability that most guinea pigs don't have. I'm not gonna let potential like that go to waste.\" Alexei looks back up at Elliot, who was astonished by the words, but still unaccepting. \"Thanks, but your not taking him.\" She once again snatches Ven, but this time, puts him in the pen with Lillie. The door stays open with Alexei watching. \"That's not gonna stop him, trust me,\" bellowed Alexei. Elliot ignored the brown guinea pig, returning to the front and slamming the door on him. Alexei chuckles a bit, \"Okay well I'll see ya later today.\" He begins to roam back towards his home. As he leaves, Elliot leans on the front door, making sure Alexei won't kick it down. The whole conversation awakes Marlen, who was in the bedroom. After the door slams, he comes out into the living room and wonders what happened. \"Elliot?\" She was stunned by the conversation, and didn't acknowledge Marlen at first. He walks closer, \"Who was that?\" Elliot finally turned over and answered, \"It was Alexei...\" \"Alexei..? What was he doing here?\" \"He was returning Ven.\" Marlen gazed over to the pen and saw Ven and Lillie, sitting there nonchalantly. \"Ven? He escaped?\" \"Apparently..\" Marlen noticed the subtle trembling in Elliot, \"Why do you looked so worried?\" \"Alexei's not a easy person to talk too,\" she responded. \"What he do?\" Elliot hesitated, \"He want's to take Ven.\" \"What? Like kidnap him?\" \"Something like that... He says Ven is special and has abilities that no other guinea pig has. He wants to raise him up and train him to.. uh.. protect the village.\" \"So Ven has powers..\" \"According to him, yes.\" Marlen rolls his eyes, \"Sounds like a nut job. Hector was right about him.\" Elliot gets off the door, and glares at Ven. \"Let's keep a sharp eye on Ven today, just to be safe,\" exclaimed Elliot. \"Okay,\" answered Marlen. Alexei's home Alexei approaches his home, and appears to be contemplating something. He stops at his front porch, and surveys his home. He turns around and looks at the village, gazing at it with ambition in hopes for Ven to return. He then walks up his porch steps and sits down on a homemade wooden chair. Alexei closes his eyes and begins to nap, smiling softly. A few hours later, back at Elliot's house It's almost noon, Elliot continues to build furniture while Marlen keeps a close eye on the pups. Marlen is sitting next to the playpen, studying Ven. \"Special, huh?\" whispered Marlen to himself. \"You're not doing anything special..\" Ven is crawling around the pen, looking around, and occasionally dabbling at the wooden playpen fence. Lillie was playing with a wooden stick given to her for entertainment. \"Hmm..\" muttured Marlen in disappointment. \"How are they?\" hollered Elliot from another room. \"They're fine.\" \"Are they doing anything wierd?\" \"No.. nothing at all, they're just sitting here.\" \"You think you can give me a hand real quick?\" \"What if they escape?\" \"I highly doubt they'll escape in 10 seconds..\" Marlen drew his eyes onto Ven, then walked over towards the hallway, entering the room. He sees a mess of wood on the floor, as well as Elliot, covered in saw dust. \"Mind helping me move this extra wood out?\" asked Elliot. Marlen nods and begins to pick up some debris in the area, he spots the bed she made. \"Looks good.\" said Marlen. \"Thanks.\" \"Do you think we can make a chair next?\" asked Marlen. While the two converse, Ven turns towards Lillie who is playing with the stick. He pauses for a moment. \"You didn't even work today,\" said Elliot. \"You just sat down and watched the kids.\" \"Yeah, on the floor.. for two hours.. Not comfortable.\" \"You'll live, we need to finish making beds first, we got one more to go.\" Suddenly a loud thump was made from the living room. The couple stopped and looked at each other, then rushed to the living room, dropping everything they had. They quickly look over to the playpen to see if Ven went missing. He was still there, sitting patiently. Elliot and Marlen exhaled heavily in relief. \"Okay, I'll move the bed.\" spoke Elliot. \"Stay there and watch them.\" Marlen nods and sits down near the pups once again, studying them. He sees Lillie come up to the fence of the playpen, and stick her arm through, reaching for something. \"What's wrong?\" said Marlen softly. Lillie looks to the other side of the room, continuing to reach her hand to something. Marlen turns towards the direction of her arm, and sees the piece of wood she was playing with. It was sitting on the opposite end of the living room. Marlen was mystified, \"How did that end up over there?\" He looks back at Lillie and Ven, with innocent faces. Marlen then gets up, walking towards the stick. He picks it up, studying it and turns back around. Ven disappeared , almost instantly. Marlen paused for a moment to understand what had just happened. \"Uhh.. What!?\" shrieked Marlen. \"What happened?\" shouted Elliot from the next room. \"Uhh, it happened.\" Elliot walks into the living room, looking at Marlen. \"What do you mean, it happened?\" She looks over towards the playpen, and sees that Ven is missing. Her expression changes, then she glances back at Marlen. Suddenly they go in a panic, searching everywhere in the house. Elliot shouts, \"How'd you lose him!?\" \"I literally turned my back for five seconds! I have no clue!\" \"Damn it Marlen!\" \"How is this my fault!?\" The couple scramble around the house, searching every corner possible. \"The front door is closed, right!?\" exclaimed Elliot. \"Yeah, I don't think he knows how to open doors.\" \"Actually now I wouldn't be surprised, he did just jump out of the playpen.\" \"Well I didn't hear the door open...\" \"Maybe he didn't get out through a door...\" Elliot walks into the master bedroom and sees a window open in the corner, a breeze rushed inside. \"What? A window?\" asked Marlen. \"Yup..\" The couple walked to the window and peeked outside. \"Check around the outside of the house, he couldn't have gotten far... I'll watch Lillie.\" Marlen nodded and rushed outdoors, checking the perimeter of the house. He then checks the surrounding area and nearby homes, with no luck. After a few minutes, he returns to Elliot. \"Did you find him?\" asked Elliot. Marlen, gasping for air, responded, \"No, I have no clue where he could be.\" Elliot looks up to the roof and sort of rolls her eyes. \"Jesus, Alexei was right about him.\" She turns towards the window and sees Alexei's home in the distance. \"Wait a minute..\" she murmured to herself. Suddenly the answer came to her, \"Marlen, I know where Ven is.\" At Alexei's Home The wind breezes through Alexei's fur as he naps. The pup, Ven was on the staircase watching Alexei as he naps. Suddenly, Alexei opens his eyes and looks left on the porch stairs, and slightly grins. He gets off his chair, hops off the porch and walks towards the big oak tree. Ven watches Alexei for a second, then begins to follow. Alexei arrives at the tree, looking up into the branches and leaves, drafting out a plan. Ven finally catches up and sits next to Alexei, looking up into the tree as well. Alexei turns his attention to Ven, \"Ready?\" The pup continues to stare at Alexei, but has a reassuring expression. Alexei reaches down and picks up Ven, putting the young pup on his back, Ven holds on tightly. Then suddenly, Alexei leaps onto the tree, climbing towards the top. He rustles through the leaves, and hops branch to branch effortlessly all the way up. At the top, the wind is intensified and the braches are weaker, beginning to bend under Alexei and Ven's weight. They look at the village from above, as well as the entire neighborhood. After a few moments of taking in the scenery, Alexei plucks Ven off his back, putting him on the branch next to him. As he does so, he looks down through the branches, and spots two guinea pigs walking near his home. Alexei expression changes, as if he knows exactly who they are. He jumps down the tree, leaving Ven at the top. Ven watches characteristically. \"Do you see him?\" asked Elliot faintly. \"No, where's Alexei?\" said Marlen. \"I don't know.\" Suddenly, Elliot spots Alexei walking from the tree casually. \"Wait.. There he is!\" bellowed Elliot. Marlen turns and sees her pointing at Alexei. They both rush towards him, arriving at the same time. \"Okay, I know you have him..\" spoke Elliot. Her tone was sharp and dominant. \"I do..\" responded Alexei. Marlen steps in, acting rather aggressive. \"Then where's Ven!?\" Alexei glares at Marlen, then turns to Elliot, \"Who's the fat ass?\" Marlen shoves Elliot behind her and takes control. \"Answer my question!\" Marlen attempts to tower over Alexei, \"That's my son, and I'm not gonna let you kidnap him!\" \"MARLEN PLEASE!\" interrupted Elliot. \"We're not here to fight..\" she turns to Alexei. \"W-where is Ven? I just want to make sure he's safe.\" Alexei sees Elliot's desperation, and points up to the tree where Ven is located. The worried parents look confused. \"Under the tree?\" asked Marlen. \"Not under..\" Alexei continues to point at the top. Elliot and Marlen inspect the tree, and spot a small brown fur ball at the top. \"WHAT!? VEN!\" shouted Elliot. Marlen mumbles to himself, \"That's not safe..\" Elliot continues, \"How'd he get up there!?\" \"I put him there,\" answered Alexei. \"How?!\" \"I climbed..\" \"You can climb trees!?\" \"You ask a lot of questions..\" \"Well I wonder why when people are trying to kill my son.\" \"Ha!.. Ven will live... watch.\" Alexei sits on the ground, closing his eyes, while everyone else stands on their toes, anxious to see what happens. Ven still sits a top the giant tree, looking around. He spots a small branch, slightly lower than him. He prepares himself, then jumps. It was a perfect jump, landing right on the branch. Then suddenly, the branch breaks, putting Ven in a free fall. Elliot and Marlen gasp, closing there eyes. Alexei peeks open one eye, curious on what happened. The sound of branches hit the ground in front of them. The two parents open their eyes, and prepare themselves to see the remains of their only son. Ven wasn't on the ground, but in fact still in the tree. Holding on to a branch, and hanging in mid air, the small pup was perfectly fine. Elliot and Marlen breath again, relieved that Ven was still alive. Alexei smiled and closed his eyes again. Ven picked himself up, and tried to find another way down. He crawls to the center of the tree, and spots a series of thick branches leading towards the bottom. Without hesitation, he hops to the next branch, landing perfectly. Ven continues to make his way down the tree, effortlessly jumping branch to branch till he gets to the first layer of branches near the tree trunk. He looks down at the trunk, digs his claws into it and slides down to the base of the tree. Elliot and Marlen are dumbfounded; they stare at Ven as he nonchalantly walks to Alexei, sitting next to him. Alexei opens his eyes and spots Ven, in front of him, peacefully sitting as if nothing happened. He stands up, \"Good,\" spoke Alexei. \"The training can start.\" Marlen begins to step back towards Alexei's home, \"I need to figure out what just happened..\" spoke Marlen. He paces back to the home, startled. Elliot steps up, \"W-what was that all about?\" \"Again with the questions...\" \"Uh, I just saw my three day old son climb down a full size tree!\" \"As expected... I told you, Ven's abilities are beyond his age, thus why it needs to be trained.\" \"Isn't there a less dangerous way to prove that?\" \"Nope, Ven won't be at his best unless he's put in a life or death situation.\" \"What do you mean, how do you know that?\" \"It was proven... Back home, all pups at birth are put through a test. This test was to see if their reflexes were fast enough for physical training. All of the passing candidates were put up for selection. Those that were picked, became greatness.\" \"What about the ones that failed, where'd they go?\" \"Nowhere, because they died.\" \"They were killed?\" \"Yes. The test was very dangerous, they died. It's a way to flush out the weakness.\" \"Sounds cruel.. What about you? Did you escape?\" Alexei shrugs, \"No, I was one of the top performing pigs, special forces.\" \"Special forces.. For what, like the military?\" \"Yeah, but not for this country.\" \"Well, you sound like you're from another country.\" Ven begins to crawl up to Alexei, picking at his fur. \"So, did Ven pass the test?\" asked Elliot. \"He did.\" Elliot glared at Ven, and seemed to accept defeat. She rolls her eyes and sighs, \"You know you're basically kidnapping my son..\" \"In all fairness, he came to me... But is it kidnapping when you know where he is at all times?\" \"True... How long is this training?\" \"Until I think he's ready.\" She gives Alexei a blank stare. \"Fine... You can train him, but he'd better know where his real family lives.\" \"Thanks, but I wasn't asking for parental permission.\" Elliot peered at Alexei with a small smirk, expecting a response like that. She turns away and returns to Marlen, who was sitting on the staircase, finally calm from the argument. Marlen turns to her, \"So what happened?\" he asks. \"Ven is gonna stay and get trained.\" \"What!?\" \"Ven will be okay, I think we can trust Alexei.\" \"Trust? Elliot, remember what Hector said about him? He's dangerous...\" \"But Hector doesn't know him like I know him now. I'll explain on the way back.\" Elliot and Marlen begin to walk back to the main part of the village, glancing at Ven and Alexei one last time. Ven and Alexei continued training the whole day and it was becoming dark. After the last exercise was finished, Alexei went indoors to prepare some food. Ven followed in and jumped onto the couch, peeking over the top, watching Alexei cook. Once finished, Alexei grabbed a bowl and gave some food to Ven, who was still on the couch. Alexei ate on the table near the kitchen. The two chowed down on food without hesitation completely finishing the bowl. Alexei then turned over to Ven who was being more quiet then usual. He got up from the table and curiously peeked around the corner of the couch, Ven was asleep. His food bowl was empty, and was hanging off the edge. Alexei watched Ven as he slept, contemplating something. Back at the village, Elliot and Marlen finished up building furniture in all the rooms with the help of Hector and Angel, who was visiting earlier in the day; Elliot had explained what happened about Alexei and Ven, and chose to leave them alone, with Hector agreeing. Marlen had fallen asleep as Elliot finalizes the furniture placement. She heads towards Lillie, who was peacefully playing with the makeshift toys in the area. Elliot picks her up, and brings her into her new room. Lillie's room was pretty basic at the moment, with a simple makeshift crib and some cabinets. Inside the crib, was some soft bedding for Lillie to sleep in; Elliot puts her in, and watches Lillie get comfortable with her new surroundings. Suddenly a knock from the front door. Elliot peeks out into the hallway and see's Marlen who is un-interrupted by the sound. She then quickly walks to the front door, and opens it. No one was there, Elliot then looked down and saw Ven, sleeping on the grass. \"Ven?\" whispered Elliot. She gave a confused expression, and looked around for anyone who might have dropped him off. Un-hesitantly she picks up Ven, and shuts the door. Elliot decides to put Ven in his newly built room, but stops suddenly. She dazes at the pup, peacefully sleeping around her arms, and hugs him tightly. She continues into the room, which similarly looks like Lillie's, and puts Ven into the soft crib. Feeling concerned, Elliot brings some bedding from her own room and decides to sleep on the floor next to Ven's crib. The next morning A small breeze from the morning air creeps into Ven's room, and awakes Elliot. She yawns, then rolls upward and sits up straight, looking outdoors. She looks to the right and see's Ven's crib, unmoved. Elliot stretches and gets up, looking into the crib, Ven is missing. Her eyes open wide, then desperately digs around the bedding. She then looks around the room, searching for her once again missing son. She pauses for a moment, then looks out the window, studying it. She sighs and leans on the window, looking outside into the distance. She spots Alexei's home, and sees Alexei running around the house, with a smaller figure following. Elliot lays her arms on the window frame in defeat, and watched as the two guinea pigs train for the day. The last chapter for this timeline. It took a moment to edit, and I feel I could edit it more. I'm not a professional writer at all, but I do want to improve on it. This is my first time writing anything this long. So any suggestions and tips for writing I would appreciate. So, Alexei is special forces? Alexei is a guinea pig sent from Russia to spy on America's defenses. He ended up losing communication with home base, and decided to retire and settle in America. He kept all of his gear given to him and forcefully retired to the guinea pig community you see here. The people Alexei worked for is Russia's version of G-force, although much more organized and built. They're a Private Military Company contracted by the Russian Federation using animals as spies, called S.O.A.D \"Special Operations Animal Division\". They don't just use guinea pigs, but use birds, squirrels, and any animal they can train. Guinea pigs were their choice for sabotage however, being small and unnoticeable. They manufactured miniature weapons for the animals, as well as giving them special gear depending on the mission.[Chapter 7] Chapter 7: Two years of... As the weeks pass, Ven's motor skills get refined and his training get's more difficult. Alexei teaches him how to survive in harsh climates, as well as teaching him how to escape and evade enemies. He teaches Ven how to use his Makarov pistol skillfully and tactically, and teaches him a fighting form used is Russia's special forces. Two years pass, many adventures were made by Ven, and all of the village members. Ven is now two years old (twenty-four in human years), and Alexei is four (fourty-eight in human years). Alexei is growing old, and is unable to move as fast as he used to be. The shortest chapter ever... It's really only here because there is such a time gap between these next chapters. I still have plans for the two years of adventures. They're more like episodes of adventures with Ven and members of the village. Members like Tibbetts, Alexei, Lillie, and others would be involved in stuff like, \"Christmas with Ven\" or \"Halloween with Ven\". Mainly short stories..[Chapter 8] Chapter 8: Another Day Elliot's / Ven's home Ven open's his eyes, and sees the morning sunshine gleaming into his room and on his face. He slowly gets up and sits aside his bed looking down at the floor, trying to wake up. A few moments pass, but gathers the strength to get up onto his feet. He walks out of his room into the hallway, and passes by Lillie's room. She's awake, and appears to be pampering herself. Lillie was fully grown now, but still had the soft brown fur with the lighter brown belly. Her room had a CD player hooked up to a small speaker, playing hip-hop. Ven pauses for a moment to peek into the room as he walks by. Lillie doesn't notice Ven because she's fixated on trying to comb her hair. Ven then passes by his parent's room, and spots Elliot and Marlen still asleep in their cots. He notes their presence, but doesn't acknowledge them. Ven continues into the living room then out the front door. The morning breeze rushes through Ven's fur as he looks around the village. The village had more homes than before and was lushing with guinea pigs, about forty in total. It's breakfast hour, and everyone in the village was roaming about. Some were having conversations, others maintaining their homes. But most were drawn towards the shed where the breeder stores and serves the food. Ven began to walk across the village, wandering his way towards the shed. On the way there, he passes by the main two story house where Hector and Angel used to live. Hector passed away about a year ago due to age, and was taken by the breeder. Angel soon passed after from health problems, due from depression and stress of being alone. The guinea pigs that reside now are Hector's third and fourth litters. Tyler, from the third litter, is the dominant in the household. He controls the whole village, along with his spouse, and does it well. His brother, Neal, assists him in managing the village. The fourth litter, Kelvin, Tibbetts, and Julie, also reside in the house. Kelvin is the dominant from that litter and often gets in fights with Tyler for control of the house. Tibbetts is a special guinea pig, diagnosed with a mental disease similar to autism. He often gets bullied due to his personality and is not liked by any of his siblings. Nowadays he separates himself from his family and sits by the edge of the hill behind the village, surveying the trees and relaxing to nature's sound. Julie is Lillie's best friend. They hang out daily, and usually gossip to each other about the village. These girls are the most popular in the village, as well as being the most beautiful. As Ven passes by the home, he is spotted by Tibbetts from the second floor. \"Good morning Ven!\" shouted Tibbetts. Ven didn't acknowledge, and continued to the shed. \"Hey Ven! Good morning!\" he repeated in the same tone. Once again Ven didn't acknowledge, or even turn his head. \"Hmm.. I wonder if he can hear me?\" said Tibbetts to himself. \"Maybe if I scream louder...\" The black and white guinea pig forms a cone in front of his mouth to amplify his voice. \" VEEEN !\" \"Can you like, shut up!?\" A female voice came from behind Tibbetts at the doorway. It was a mixed tricolor, with a flare of light brown fur on the right side of her face. \"Hey Julie,\" said Tibbetts. \"Did you wanna say hi to Ven?\" \"No, stop yelling at random people.\" \"Ven's not a random person, I know his name.\" She sighs, \"You're doing it again..\" \"What?\" \"Being retarted.\" Tibbetts looks away for a second thinking hardly. \"Wait.. I am?\" \"Yes, you do this every morning, something stupid.\" \"What'd I do?\" \"Do I really have to tell you?\" Tibbetts looked blankly at the corner, \"I don't know what I did.\" \"You do know, you're just being stupid again..\" She turns away from Tibbetts and heads back into her own room. Tibbetts paused for a moment, in confusion, then slowly walks into Julie's room. She was looking into a mirror, trying to spot any imperfections in her fur. Tibbetts spoke softly, \"Hey, I'm sorry. You know I have trouble talking to others..\" \"I really don't care, just leave me alone.\" Tibbetts looks down and turns away from Julie, not saying another word. Defeated, Tibbetts walks down the spiral staircase and out of the house. As he exits the house, he spots Lillie in the distance, walking towards his home. She gets stopped by a chubby Abyssinian guinea pig, who quickly leads her behind another home, out of sight of everyone. She softly gets put against a wall, then gazed at the chubby pigs eyes. \"Randy...\" whispered Lillie. \"What's wrong?\" \"Nothin, just wanted to say hi.\" He starts groping on her, rubbing her fur softly. She smiles, \"Are you sure? You seem pretty curious right now.\" \"I am a pretty curious individual..\" Randy continues to caress her, slowly placing his hands along her lower body. He gets stopped short by Lillie, \"We shouldn't do this here, if anybody finds us out we're finished.\" She peeks around to see if anybody's watching. \"Nobody can see us,\" said Randy. Lillie looks back at Randy in concern, and murmured, \"I'll come over in a few hours, okay?\" Randy's expression turns to discontent. Lillie continues, \"Can you wait till then? We can fuck all day if you want.\" Randy hesitates, but agrees, \"Okay..\" Lillie walks away into the open, indifferently. Randy watches her as she gains distance. She soon gets spotted by Julie, her best friend. Julie waves her down from the second floor of the house, \"Hey, get in here!\" Lillie smiles, and quickly walks into the home. Randy loses sight of her, and begins to make his way towards his home. Meanwhile, Ven is at the shack quickly grabbing a couple of rations of food. Getting rapidly annoyed with the people around, he decides to eat somewhere else. He takes some more food, and heads toward Alexei's home. Alexei's home stayed mostly the same over time. The tree next to the home was worn down over time from bullet holes and scratches. The home itself had small traces of mold on the exterior, but in general the house was up kept. Ven approaches the home, full of food in his arms, and spots the training course Alexei been working on for the past few days. Alexei was inside the home, and sees Ven through the window. The dark brown agouti guinea pig maintained his form over the years, with the exception of some gray hairs showing through his fur. Alexei's physical movement and strength have slown down, but his temper remains the same. He walks outside onto his front porch. \"Here..\" exclaimed Ven. He lobs the cabbage bowl over to Alexei, he catches it. Alexei studies the food, and gets slightly disgruntled from the lack of variety. He exhales through his nose heavily, \"This shit again?\" whispered Alexei to himself. He bites into a pellet, and cringes. Ven walks up the porch steps, and looks over the training course. \"You finished the course..\" He then sits down onto a chair to begin eating. \"Fuck this!\" shouted Alexei. He throws the bowl of food into the field next to the home. Ven shows no reaction, and just continues to eat on his chair looking at the course. \"How do you eat this garbage?\" ranted Alexei. \"My sister can cook better than this shit!\" \"Your sister?\" asked Ven. \"Where is she now?\" \"Buried somewhere in Multa.\" \"How'd that happen?\" \"Someone didn't like her cooking.. So they smacked her in the back of the head with a frying pan, then kicked a knife into her neck.\" \" Kicked? \" \"Yeah, once she was on the floor unconscious, they grabbed the chef knife and jabbed it into her neck. Once it settled in, they kicked it till it came out the front.\" \"A little much, where were you?\" \"I was there, eating with everybody else.\" \"Did you do anything about it?\" \"Nah, I was just a kid.\" Alexei snickers, \"Although, they did make me clean up the mess and dump the body.\" Alexei turned his back on Ven and peered out into the distance and spots a guinea pig. The individual was separated from the village, and was lying in the grass. \"Who's that?\" wondered Alexei. Ven gets up and walks over next to Alexei, peeking around his shoulder. Ven recognizes the fur pattern, \"It's Tibbetts...\" \"Autism boy? What the fuck is he doing now?\" \"He's been doing that for the past few days. I think it's for him to 'cope' with himself.\" \"Cope with what? His fapping issues?\" \"I don't really know.. Or care.\" \"Whatever.\" Alexei and Ven return their attention to the course, and study it for a moment. The course was broken down to three sections. The aerobic portion, the shooting portion, and the mixed shooting/aerobic portion. The aerobic portion consisted of a balancing ledge, some poles, a large wall, and a wooden tunnel. The balancing ledge was a small wooden plank being supported up by some more wood. The poles were slightly higher than the plank, and grew in tallness. There were four wooden poles in total, all jabbed into the ground. The wall was nearly two feet tall, and had a second wall, that was perpendicular to it. The tunnel, was essentially a Z shaped box, with nails hammered into it. Afterwards, was the shooting portion. It consisted of four wooden targets with a opening in the middle, leading to the tree. The final portion was at the tree itself. The tree had five more targets; three on the base of the tree, and two more on a branch high up on the tree, aimed down. \"You ready?\" asked Alexei. \"How do I go about doing this?\" responded Ven. \"Okay.. First, you're going to hop on the ledge, and balance your way across.\" Alexei points to the first portion of the course. \"Once across, hop onto the poles and hop between them using only your hands. After that, do whatever it takes to hop over the wall, then quickly crawl under the nail tunnel. From there, take the Makarov, and hit all targets. Run through the opening, reload the weapon, and take out the targets at the base of the tree. There are targets in tree itself. Take them out, then run back to me to finish the course.\" Alexei heads indoors and grabs his makarov, as well as a small watch that fits on his wrist. He walks back outdoors, regroups with Ven, and head towards the start of the course. \"Put this on,\" said Alexei. He hands his holster to Ven without the pistol. Ven, without hesitation, wraps it around his waist and buckles it on. Alexei moves towards the shooting portion of the course, loads the gun, and puts it on a table near the targets. He then moves aside and begins to set up his watch. Alexei looks over towards Ven, and puts his hand on the watch. Ven looks back, then gets in the ready position. \"Ready!?\" shouted Alexei from afar. Ven puts on a focused look, and prepares himself. \"Get set! GO!\" Ven immediately sprints to full speed and approaches the balancing plank. Without slowing down, he hops in the air and smoothly lands on the plank. He continues to sprint on the plank, having no balancing issues. Ven quickly comes up to the poles, and dives into the air towards them. He uses the first pole as leverage to gain height for the second pole. On the second pole, he flips himself upside down and cartwheels to the third pole. Still upside down, he pushes himself higher to the last pole, grabbing it in perfect balance. Ven then flips off, doing a corkscrew, and lands perfectly. It was a solid landing that kicked up some grass. Alexei saw this, smirked a bit, looked down at his watch to check the progress of time, \"Eleven seconds!\" he shouted. Ven began to sprint again towards the next obstacle, and comes up to the large wall. The tall structure almost triples Ven in height. He spots the perpendicular wall, which is only slightly taller than him, and hops onto that instead. Using his feet, Ven kicks himself off the smaller wall high into the air. He reaches for the top of the taller wall, and barely grabs onto it, sliding off to the side a bit. This time, he uses upper arm strength to swiftly pull himself over. Ven then free falls back towards the ground, he rolls to compensate for the hard landing. The next obstacle was the nail box. Ven dives into the ground, crawling into the pointy box without fear. He crawls up into the corner and stops short, making sure he doesn't stab himself. He has to go around a corner, but can't turn his body to the left or right. Instead, Ven straightens out, and rolls to the left as if he was a pencil. This caused him to straighten himself out with the exit. Ven quickly waddles on the grass, finally escaping the barbed box. He picks himself up and sprints once more to the next portion of the course. Alexei glances at his watch again, \"Thirty seconds!\" Ven approaches the shooting portion, and spots the Makarov on the table. It had a magazine loaded, as well as a second mag next to it, both with eight rounds. \"Quickly!\" shouted Alexei. \"Empty the magazine on these targets!\" Ven swiftly grabs the pistol and fires four rounds, one onto each target. They were all headshots, he fires four more times, hitting all four targets again. The slide locks back, out of ammo. \"Reload!\" screamed Alexei. Ven uses his thumb to activate the mag release, and drops the spent magazine on the floor. He then rapidly takes the second mag from the holster and loads it into the gun, and releases the slide lock. \"Through the center! Forty-two seconds!\" Ven sets into a sprint once again, towards the final portion. He comes up to the tree and has to hop over a small wall. Behind it, three targets at the base of the tree. Ven swings over the wall, shooting the three targets in mid-swing. He then looks up and sees the last two targets directly above him. Getting a running start, Ven runs up the tree and kicks himself off, shooting the two targets in mid-air, while performing a backflip, and lands kneeling on the ground. He holsters the pistol, and does a final sprint back to Alexei. Alexei clocks him as he passes by, \"One minute, six seconds.\" \"Is that good?\" asked Ven, slightly out of breath. Alexei glances at the Makarov, and gestures to return it. Ven clears the weapon, and hands it over to Alexei. Alexei begins to refill the magazines up with ammo from the table next to him. Once finished, he cocks the weapon, and slams it on the table, sliding it over to Ven. \"Not until its under a minute,\" firmly spoke Alexei. He points to the gun, \"And you're carrying that throughout the whole course now. We're not stopping until I see better times.\" Ven glances at the course, catching his breath. He takes a deep breath and turns towards the gun, and holsters it. \"Alright then,\" said Alexei. He resets his watch. \"On your mark..\" Ven quickly gets into position for another run. \"Get set, go!\" Ven began to sprint once again to the start of the course. Alexei relaxes a bit and watches Ven quietly from the table, keeping a sharp eye on his watch. He suddenly looks over to the distance to see if Tibbetts is still there. The guinea pig was gone and nowhere to be seen. Alexei slowly scans the area to find him, with no luck. Alexei rolls his eyes, wondering why he even cared to look in the first place, then returns his attention to Ven. But secretly, behind the building and out of Alexei's sight, Tibbetts is leaning up against the corner of the house peeking around, studying Ven. He sits there in excitement as he watches Ven train like its a movie. The jumps, the swiftness, and the shooting, all astonishes Tibbetts. Tibbetts grew a small liking to Ven, being that he is the only person that doesn't judge him directly. Suddenly a shout is heard, \"One minute, one second! Do it again!\" Tibbetts retreats behind the wall a little, hoping not to get spotted. After a few moments, Ven was seen running again through the course and Tibbetts pops back out to watch. After a few more runs of the course Tibbetts began to yawn, and started to doze off watching Ven. Later.. It's evening, the sun was beginning to set, and Ven is running through the course one last time. Total he did about 15 runs, as well as strength training, with small breaks in between. Ammo was running low, and Alexei was about to call it a day. Ven sprints pass Alexei, stops and breaths heavily, barely able to stand. Alexei clocks the watch, and smiles, \"Nice, Forty-three seconds.\" He turns to Ven, seeing him shaking and panting. \"Looks like time for dinner,\" said Alexei. With no hesitation, he turns around towards the house and begins to walk up the stairs. Ven slowly takes off the belt with the pistol still in it, lays it on the table, then follows Alexei indoors. Suddenly Alexei stops at the entrance, spooked. \"What's that sound?\" thought Alexei to himself. Ven stops at the staircase curious, \"What's wro-\" Alexei interrupted Ven with a gesture to silence him. He begins to walk down the porch steps searching around for that sound. \"Do you hear that?\" asked Alexei. Ven perks his ears up and listens around. A subtle snoring is heard throughout the area. \"Snoring?\" said Ven. Alexei nods then continues to search around. Ven regains his posture and moves towards the pistol. He un holsters it and follows behind Alexei. They begin to search the perimeter around the house and soon spots a leg from around the corner towards the back of the house. Alexei shakes his head, then nonchalantly walks up to the sleeping individual. Ven catches up and sees him. He shrugs, \"Tibbetts..\" Alexei places his hand in the air in front of Ven, signaling to give him something. Ven looks at the makarov and hands it to Alexei. Alexei checks to see if there is a round in the chamber, and aims it to the ground in front of Tibbetts. He pulls the trigger. The sound instantly wakes up Tibbetts in panic and pain, \"FUCK!\" shouted Tibbetts. He covers his ears in desperation hoping to clear the pain. Tibbetts sharply looks at Alexei and sees him, staring back at him with a gun in his hand. The pain was quickly overshadowed by fear. Tibbetts began to retreat a few inches away from Alexei. Alexei takes a step forward, continuing to aim the gun. \"Alexei please!\" trembled Tibbetts, the terror in his voice was noticeable. \"My house isn't a napping post.\" said Alexei. \"I-I'm sorry!\" \"Why are you even here?\" \"I was just watching Ven train.\" He spots Ven in the back spectating. \"Ven! P-please can you tell him I mean no harm?\" \"I can't help you.\" responded Ven. Tibbetts turns up back to Alexei, and smiles in fear. Alexei glares at Tibbetts, and puts his finger on the trigger. Ven notices and looks at Alexei, wondering if he's going to actually pull the trigger. Ven's expression turns slightly concerned, but stands his ground. Tibbetts moved back a few more inches, \"Alexei.. I-I'm sorry, please..\" \"I don't take sympathy.\" Alexei takes another step forward. Tibbetts' fear takes over and he gets up running away from Alexei as fast as he could, sprinting back towards the village. Alexei smiles and lets him run off. Ven begins to loosen up, tensioned from the conflict. Alexei turns to Ven, and snickers a bit. Ven grins slightly but shows some discontent. \"Cheer up,\" said Alexei. He takes the magazine out of the pistol and ejects the round out of the chamber. The round flips in mid air, but is snatched by Alexei. He walks by Ven and hands him the pistol with the magazine and round. \"Clean that gun, then let's eat.\" Ven continues to gaze at Tibbetts as he ran away. \"Ven!\" shouted Alexei from the front of the home trying to get his attention. Ven sharply turns, gets his act together, and heads indoors. It's late evening and Ven is on the couch, finishing up cleaning the gun. Alexei was almost finished cooking in the kitchen behind him. \"I'm curious..\" said Ven. \"Were you actually gonna shoot Tibbetts earlier?\" \"Nah, he isn't worth dirtying my gun.\" \"I see.\" \"Also, why would I put an end to his suffering, and do him a favor?\" \"Because you get off on it.\" \"Ha!.. I do.\" Ven finalized the cleaning and re-assembles the gun. He loads a full magazine into the gun, and puts it in its holster. Alexei grabs some wooden plates and begins to serve some food with a glass of some liquid from a small barrel. There was a strong alchoholic scent coming from the barrel. Ven puts the holster on the table next to the couch and begins to eat. Him and Alexei enjoy food and talk about good times for the next few hours until bedtime. Ven's all grown up![Chapter 9] WARNING! EXTREME GRAPHIC CONTENT! Chapter 9: Clusterstorm The sun has fully set. Ven and Alexei just finished eating and were becoming sleepy. Alexei walks in from the backyard, dumping the extra food out. He sees Ven dozing off on the dining table. Alexei walks past him into his room, where he grabs a small blanket. He comes back and throws it at Ven. Ven wakes up and removes the blanket from his head. \"Sleep on the couch if you want,\" said Alexei. He turns away from Ven, and heads back into his room. Ven struggles to get off the chair, still sore from the training earlier. He throws himself onto the couch along with the blanket and begins to rest. Soon the lights went out in the house, and Alexei falls asleep as well. A few hours later It's quiet, and peaceful in the village. Not a single sound is heard other than the crickets and the wind. Everyone in the neighborhood was asleep, no cars were passing by. The village itself was indifferent, all the guinea pigs were peacefully asleep. But suddenly, small noises are heard inside of the breeders home. The noises increase in volume, slowly. The sound of small ticks on the wooden floor, many of them. The lights turn on in the kitchen, and the shadow of the breeder is seen through the window of the house. Suddenly she is attacked, her dog starts barking. The things attacking her were not human, but machines, stabbing her to death with their sharp extremities. She starts screeching wildly, but it soon subsides. Her dog continues to bark at the machines, and runs away. The machines quickly chase it down and put it out. The screaming and howling were heard throughout the village, waking many of the inhabitants. Some guinea pigs come outside curious, looking at the door to the breeders home. Right when it starts to settle, the glass from the old lady's home shatters. Along with it, came out a toaster, with legs! The back door gets busted open, and a cluster of home appliances that came to life started flooding the village. Machines flying everywhere! Appliances destroying houses and killing its occupants. Everyone scatters in a panic, others remained in the houses hiding. One house gets the roof ripped off by a coffee maker. The two occupants attempt to flee the home, but were unable. The coffee maker quickly shoots out its blade, slicing one of the guinea pigs in half. The guinea pig gurgles in blood, and attempts to talk unsuccessfully. The other turns to see his mate down on the ground, crawling with half a body. He attempts to return for his aid, but was stopped by a toaster and a blender. The guinea pig falls on his back in fear, looking at the menacing machines. His leg gets grabbed by the wires from the toaster, and tossed high into the air. As he falls, he is caught by the blender. The sharp mixing blade digs into his skin. The machine turns itself on in puree mode. The guinea pig splatters inside the blender, screaming in pain for only a second. His body mangled inside of the machine, turns into a pulp of meat. Tyler looks out the window from his room, seeing the devastation. He first looks in the distance and sees his younger brother, Kelvin. He's being chased down by a couple of blue irons, throwing fireballs of cloth everywhere, catching the village on fire. One of the fireballs hit Kelvin, burning him alive and well as the area around him. He then looks down and sees his other brother Neal, surrounded by a waffle maker, and a mechanical razor. In no thought to save his brother, he jumps down on top of the waffle maker in order to distract them for him to flee. \"GO!\" screamed Tyler. Neal quickly scurries away from the area, but turns around to check on Tyler. Tyler gets knocked off by the waffle maker into the razor. His fur flies in the air, and he starts bleeding from his back. Neal seeing his brothers fate, turns back around in a attempt to save him, but it's too late. The razor began cutting into his skin, violently. Then the waffle maker attacks, chopping the guinea pig into mush with it's sharp teeth. Neal stops short, and drops on his knees in despair. He looks right, and spots a microwave rushing towards him. It's crawling on four sharp legs, and has an mechanical eye coming out of its display. It hits Neal hard, sending him flying a few feet. He lands hard, sliding up against a house. The house door opens, it's Randy. Behind him was Lillie, fearing for life against the corner. The microwave rushes the home and quickly stabs Neal through the neck, and into the home. Wood debris flys everywhere, and Lillie screams. In a quick panic, Randy sprints underneath the microwave, abandoning Lillie in the house. He was quickly stopped by a floating radio, playing ratched music. It was red and had tentacles coming from the bottom. The tentacles surrounded Randy, picking him up off the floor. The microwave turns around and opens its door. The radio swiftly throws Randy in the microwave and the door shuts. Lillie watches in shock as Randy panics inside the machine. The microwave beeps, and the inside starts smoking. Randy screeches profusely, then suddenly explodes in a bloody mess, intestines on the window of the microwave. The microwave turns it's attention over to Lillie, who is trembling in fear in the corner of the small home. It begans to rush the home once more. Out of options, Lillie snaps and attempts to flee as quick as she can out of the house. The front door wasn't viable, but she sees a window on the side of the house. She quickly gets out of the microwaves sight and dives out the window into the darkness. The microwave begins to destroy the home, searching for Lillie without success. Lillie flees towards her home with tears running down her face. She turns around and sees the house crumble down. Lillie opens her eyes in shock and sprints even faster towards her home. She makes it inside, but the machine catches her in the corner of it's eye. Inside the untouched home Lillie spots Elliot who's sitting at the center of the home. \"Lillie!?\" screamed Elliot. Lillie sprints over towards Elliot, hugging her tightly. \"Mom! Terrible things.. T-The machines.. I-I'm scared.\" Lillie shakes in fear, but is slightly warmed by her mothers presence. \"Where's Dad, and Ven?\" asked Lillie. \"Ven is with Alexei. I sent Marlen there because its the safest place. I told him I would wait for you! Now C'mon, we need to get outta here!\" \"How, with them out there!?\" She points to their general direction. \"Follow m-\" Suddenly the rear of the home gets demolished. It's the microwave, returning for Lillie. Elliot gets trampled in debris from the home collapsing. Lillie gets caught in the debris and falls on the floor. The machine stares at her, opens its door, and drops the remains of Randy onto the grass next to the home. She turns to see the burnt and bloodied body, then returns her attention to the machine. It then raises a leg and impales her in the stomach. Lillie screams and coughs up blood. It twists its leg then releases her, searching for other victims. Lillie attempts to get up, but was weakened due to blood loss, and lies back down, looking at the village as it gets ravaged. Meanwhile, Ven wakes up abruptly to the sound of screaming in the village. He gets up and looks out the window. The whole village is in chaos and houses are on fire. Ven looks in awe, but is confused on exactly what's happening. He hears footsteps towards the front of the home, it's Alexei. Alexei opens the front door and looks towards the village. \"What the fuck's happening over there? I'm tryin to sleep..\" Ven looks a little closer and spots what looks like small, household appliances chasing around people. \"Are those.. fans?\" spoke Alexei. Suddenly, small ceiling fans converted in mini helicopters flew over Alexei's home around the neighborhood. As they pass over in the distance, Alexei looks down and spots a CD player coming towards them. It was green, and had two legs and four arms, each with a CD converted into a saw blade. Ven spots the small machine, \"This isn't good,\" he mumbles to himself. \"Uhh, fuck no!\" shouted Alexei. He sprints to the Makarov, and un holsters the gun. He returns out the front porch pre-aimed at the CD player. The machine spots Alexei, and pauses. All of a sudden, it converts back into a normal CD player and rolls itself towards Alexei. Alexei stands ground and waits for the machine to transform again. The CD player gets close to Alexei, and re-transforms into the saw blade mode, attacking with all four blades from up top like a hammer. Alexei quickly does a backflip, narrowly dodging the blades and shoots three rounds into the machine, shattering the CD's and shutting it down. Ven, inside the home wasted no time putting on the belt and holster. He rushes onto the front porch, then down the steps, \"Give it here!\" shouts Ven. He points to the gun. Alexei asks, \"Where are you going!?\" \"I have to check on my family.\" \"I'm surprised you actually care.\" \"Yeah, me too.\" Alexei tosses the weapon towards Ven, \"You loose my gun, I'll kill you myself.\" Ven holsters the pistol and sprints on all fours towards the village. Meanwhile, Alexei walks up to the CD player, it's labeled, 'Saberling'. He kicks it, and the CD port opens. Inside, between the cracks, is something glowing. Alexei looks at it closer, curious on what it is. Ten minutes have passed since the appliances came to life, and the entire village is in anarchy. Ven reaches the village from below the hill, out of the machines' sight. He comes up to his home, half of it destroyed. He glances around to see if any machines spot him. It's clear in this area of the village, most of them are ravaging the main part. Ven quickly scurries along side his home, trying to keep out of sight of the machines. He spots a burnt dead body next to the home. Ven attempts to identify who it is, with no luck. The body was just too bloody, almost no fur, and the face mangled with an eyeball hanging by a nerve. He disregards, and continues onwards to the front of his house. Ven enters the home, it was empty and quiet, smells of dust and debris filled Ven's nose. The hallway was collapsed and there was no way of passing. The only entrance available was to Lillie's room. Ven walks around the house, every step creaking against the wood. He comes up to Lillie's room and enters. When he walks in, he sees Lillie on the floor, covered in dust and wheezing. Her right paw was dismembered from the body and was coughing up blood. Her stomach and lungs were punctured and were constantly oozing. She turns her eyes onto Ven, still alive. No words came out of her mouth, as she was in shock. Ven walked up to Lillie, kneeling beside her, her fate was nearing. It was too late to save her, and Ven knew it. As much as Ven wanted to put her out of her misery, he couldn't risk making too much noise. So he takes her hand, holding it tightly, and watches as her life vacates the real. The last breath was drawn and Ven closes his eyes, releasing the hand. He looks out the window to check if any appliances were in the area. Suddenly, the debris behind him in the hallway shifts, and wood begins to fall over. Ven's turns his head questionably, and slowly reaches for his pistol. The debris shifts again. Ven pulls out his pistol, aiming at the debris. He slowly walks up to it, watching to see if any machines pop out. A few moments pass, then suddenly a hand pops out from the debris! Ven quickly aims at the hand, then realizes that's it not a machine. He holsters the gun and quickly attempts to remove the debris. As the debris clears, Ven gets a good view of the guinea pig inside. It's Elliot! He quickly grabs her arm and pulls her out of the debris. Elliot screeches in pain as her body rubs against the sharp debris. As she gets pulled out, she falls onto Ven and they both fall on the ground. The debris shifts once more to fill the area Elliot was laying. She coughs, then looks onto who saved her, \"V-Ven?\" Elliot attempts to get up, but fails. Her lower body was cut and bruised, legs broken, and unable to move. She lies on the ground, facing Ven. She struggles to talk, \"You're okay.. Please tell me it's over..\" Ven gets off the ground and turns to Elliot. \"Sadly, no.\" \"D-Did Marlen make it to you?\" \"I haven't seen him, you and Lillie are the only two so far.\" \"Lillie?.. Is she okay? Where is she?\" Ven doesn't answer the question, but instead looks into the room where Lillie was, behind Elliot. Elliot lays her head down in defeat, and looks into the distance. \"Please.. don't let me turn around.\" Ven grabs Elliot and drags her across the floor, away from the debris. He lays her up against the wall, sitting upright. \"Can you move your legs?\" asked Ven. \"No.. I can't even feel them.\" Ven turns and looks out the window once more to check and see if any appliances are heading their way. \"Why is it my family that always goes through the worst of consequences,\" said Elliot. Ven turns towards her, \"I think everyone is going through this, not just us.\" She turns to Ven, \"No, there was another time when something like this happened, you were really young.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"I never told you this but, besides Lillie, you had two more siblings.\" \"Siblings?\" \"Brothers... Your father and me, came from a pet shop. I gave birth to you, your sister, and two others.\" \"What happened to them?\" \"Well on the night you were born, there was a fire in the pet shop. No one was there to put it out, so it destroyed everything, including the tank we were in. The fire came closer and me and Marlen were out of time, so we were forced to run with whoever we found first. We only escaped with two..\" \"Wow..\" Ven pauses for a second. \"Did they have names?\" \"Only one.\" \"Why not the other?\" \"He was the runt, and Marlen said that we shouldn't name him so that we wouldn't get too attached.\" \"So you abandoned him?\" \"I didn't want to abandon him, but...\" She pauses, then sighs subtlety. \"You know, you and the runt were twins.\" Ven chuckles, \"Yeah, that puts the topping on it.. My nameless dead twin brother. At least I know I had brothers, what was the other ones name?\" \"Hurley.\" \"Hurley?\" \"You're father named him. I think it was something about his old owner, or something about shirts.. Wait.. Marlen, where did he go?\" \"Like I said earlier, I haven't seen him.\" Elliot looks past Ven and wonders to herself, in despair. She looks down on the ground, knowing in the back of her mind she lost her spouse, and her daughter. Ven's the only one left in her family. She tumbles over to her side and closes her eyes. A small, singular tear is seen going down her face. Ven notices but doesn't interfere, his main focus is protecting the house. Almost thirty minutes have passed since the beginning of the destruction. Ven, near the bottom right corner of the window, peeks around watching the village get destroyed. Luckily, almost all of the machines were focused in the center of the village near the main population, picking off guinea pigs and destroying homes. Almost half of the houses were either destroyed or on fire. Some of the appliances headed off into the streets to raid other homes, some stayed searching for victims. The appliances searched, home by home, killing whoever they found inside. One of the machines, a radio, looked towards Ven's side of the village, and began to hover its way over. Ven noticed, then readied his pistol, prepared to shoot. The radio pulls up to the home, sticking its antenna inside, searching for occupants. It spots Elliot. Ven swiftly grabs the antenna and yanks it down, dropping the radio directly in front of the window. He sticks the makarov out, and shoots the machine twice. The radio screeches loudly, then drops to the floor, smoking. The other machines notice and turn towards Ven's home. Ven gets up and aims out the window prepared to use all of the ammo he has. The machines rush Ven's position, spotting him inside the home. Ven hops out the window and runs off to the side, diverting their attention away from his home as well as Elliot. Ven knows he can't take them all on, but does intend on taking as much of them out as possible. He stops short at the end of the village area, and turns around. All of the machines were in the distance racing towards him. Prepared to make a final stand, Ven pulls the makarov, and aims toward the appliances. The closest appliance to Ven, a toaster, tripped on itself and fell over. The other machines stop and turn towards the toaster, looking at it curiously. Then suddenly, all of the appliances simultaneously fall on the ground, shutting themselves off. Hell was over. This is definitely the most gruesome chapter, so apologies for any troubles. Yup, this is the same clusterstorm as in the actual g-force film, where appliances came to life, and devastate humanity. Although in my book, they are way more deadly. Clusterstorm was active for about 30 minutes, or at least until Darwin stuck that infected PDA into the mainframe, shutting down the whole thing.[Chapter 10] Chapter 10: Loss Everything stopped, almost too quickly. In just a few seconds, havoc turned into peace. There was no sound, other than the wind and fire from the burning wood. Ven, still standing, continues to aim at the fallen appliance. He stares at it in angst for a few moments, trying to understand what just happened. After a few moments, his aggression subsides, and he holsters the pistol. Ven walks up to the motionless toaster, hesitating to get closer. In doubt, Ven kicks the machine to see if it will come back to life, nothing. He puts his arms around his waist and ponders. He looks around the village, eyes resting on his home. Suddenly, he realizes his mother was still in the house, struggling to sustain life. He rushes over to check on her. As he leaves the area, eyes are spotted in a house next to the toaster, looking at Ven as he passes by. As Ven passes more homes, more people peek out, wondering if the terror has ended. Ven approaches his house, half destroyed by the appliances, he walks in. Elliot is still against the wall, but unconscious. Ven slightly trembles, then goes to her aid, and checks for breathing. She's still breathing, subtlely; just unconscious. Ven sighs in relief. He sits down next to her, and recollects his thoughts on what happened. Outside, the village was in almost total destruction. Of the almost thirty homes, only five of them stand untouched. Others were either on fire about to collapse, or just totally destroyed. Bodies of guinea pigs lay everywhere, some not even recognizable. The machines were included in the mix, dozens of appliances lay on the ground, motionless, scattered throughout the village, as well as the breeders neighborhood. The breeders home was suprisingly still intact. The interior was slighty ruffled, back door was knocked off its hinges, and the windows shattered. Other than that, the house remained livable. Back inside the village, the guinea pigs slowly began to come out of hiding, one by one. Everyone looks around at the destruction, and some immediatly began searching for loved ones. Behind the food shed, a guinea pig poked their head out, curious to see if it's all over. \"Is it over?\" asked a female voice. It was Julie, next to Tibbetts, sitting with her head face down in a upright fetal managed to avoid the machines by hiding out of sight. \"I-I don't know,\" responded Tibbetts. He was peaking around the corner, checking the area. \"Everyone's coming out.\" Julie looks up at Tibbetts, fearfully curious. She gets up, slowly coming up behind Tibbetts, and peaks around. Her expression changes, in almost instant regret. She looks upon the village, in awe from what happened. Her village destroyed, family destroyed, life destroyed. \"No..\" said Julie softly, but desperately. She walks out aimlessly into the open. Tibbetts reaches his arm out to her, \"Julie wait..\" She doesn't respond. Tibbetts lowers his hand and looks around the village, trying to keep his cool. Suddenly he spots Ven, going into his home. Tibbetts sees half of it destroyed and wonders if he and his family are okay. Tibbetts looks back at Julie, who is still wandering almost drunkenly. He loses sight of her behind a burning house and re focuses his attention to Ven's home. Looking around to check if it's clear, Tibbetts quickly scurries along the sideline of the village making his way towards Ven's home. Ven, still sitting next to his mother begins to hear noises nearby, he looks up out the window and sees most of the village members out and about. Uninterested, he sits back down with Elliot. Suddenly Tibbetts opens the front door to Ven's room and runs in. Ven quickly unholsters the pistol and aims at the guinea pig. \"Woah! Woah!\" shouted Tibbetts. He puts his hands between him and the gun, cowarding back. \"Tibbetts?\" responded Ven. Ven puts the gun away and gets up. \"What are you doing here?\" Tibbetts slowly lowers his arms, \"I-I wanted to check on you, a-and your family... Are they alright?\" \"Well, you're looking at who's left.\" Tibbetts peeks over Ven and spots Elliot, unconscious. \"Just you two?\" Tibbetts quickly steps around Ven towards Elliot, and kneels beside her. He checks for breathing. \"She's still alive,\" spoke Ven. \"She's just resting.\" \"Well you're definately right about her being alive, but..\" Tibbetts moves the body around, and hears a crackling from her back. \"That's not good..\" \"What?\" \"Her back... It's broken.\" Ven doesn't respond, but moves closer interested. \"Yeah, her back is broken in the lumbar vertebrae. The uh.. lower back, right here. Tibbetts points out to Ven the location of the bone. \"That bone takes a long time to heal, if at all. It's in the spinal cord which carries the nerves from the brain to the lower part of the body.\" Ven re focuses his attention to Tibbetts, suprised to see the knowledge coming out. Tibbetts continues, \"Her legs are also broken.\" He moves towards her upper body, \"Her arms are fine.. But..\" He feels a crick in her neck. \"Her cervical vertabrae is sprained, but not broken.\" \"What does that mean?\" asked Ven. \"Her neck is cracked... She's for the most part paralyzed from the waist down. Here, let's put her flat on the ground, and keep her head straight up.\" They both move her down on the wooden floor, lying face up. Ven turns towards Tibbetts, \"Where did you learn all of this?\" \"Well, I used to sneak into the lady's home, and read books.\" \"Like medical books?\" \"There was one of those, yeah... Is there anyone else here?\" \"Alive? No..\" \"Why'd you say alive?\" Ven turns his head to the room Lillie was in, Tibbetts follows. He curiously gets up and slowly walks to the room peeking around the corner. \"Ughh..\" He sees the bloody mess, and a dead corpse. He looks at her for a few moments then turns away, looking out the window. Almost everyone came out from hiding, Tibbetts sees an opportunity to help out everyone else. \"Hey,\" said Tibbetts. \"I'll be right back.\" He rushes out the front door towards the main part of the village. One of the untouched homes, was the doctors house. The doctor of the village was chosen by the community to care for everyone's health and well-being. They are chosen based on experience and knowledge of caretaking. They are also chosen to handle birth's, and usually have a good amount of medical supplies. These medical supplies are usually stored in the food shed, but the village decided that it would be better if it was readily accessable inside someone's home. It's a big responsibility that puts a lot of stress on the guinea pig, but a rewarding job. As Tibbetts runs out the door, he sees the village's remaining guinea pig gather towards the doc's house, looking for help. There's almost thirty pigs near his front door, doing what looks like searching around. Tibbetts runs into the crowd and overhears a few pigs in the front near the door. \"Where is he?\" said one pig. \"I just said, I don't know,\" answered another. Everyone was trying to talk over one another, and was causing a some sort of chaos. \"Well, has anyone seen Tyler!\" shouted a pig from one corner. \"He's dead!\" shouted another. \"What about Neal!?\" Another guinea voice came out. \"I saw half of him next to one of the burning homes!\" The whole village was asking for the doc. Suddenly one shouted, \"Here! Here! I found him.\" Tibbetts turned as well as everyone else. One guinea pig covered in dirt was seen dragging another pig. Some went to his aid, \"It is the doc!\" \"Is he okay!?\" \"He's dead!\" \"Don't say that, maybe he's unconscious!\" Everyone was squabbling in anarchy. Tibbetts hurried himself towards the small crowd handling the doc and kneeled down beside him, \"Lemme take a look!\" shouted Tibbetts. They stop and look at Tibbetts, then at each other, in confusion. Tibbetts studies the body for a moment, then concludes, \"Um.. Yeah, he's de-\" Without warning, Tibbetts gets shoved aside by another guinea pig. \"Move kid, this is no time for games!\" It was an almost siamese guinea pig. Named Ellis, he has cream colored fur, with a touch of brown fading from the nose back. Ellis takes over diagnosing and shoves Tibbetts aside. Tibbetts gets up slowly and looks back at the small group, already forgetting him and paying no mind. \"Sorry guys, he's gone..\" said Ellis. Everyone looks down quietly. Tibbetts gets on his feet, and prepares to say something but stops himself, retreating back to the crowd. \"Now what?\" asked one of the pigs next to Ellis. \"Well.. Let's gather the bodies, get a count and see if anyone needs help.\" Tibbetts rolled his eyes thinking to himself, \"As if that wasn't obvious enough.\" Everyone began to scatter around the village, collecting bodies. Some couldn't handle the pressure of cleaning up their loved one's remains, so they stayed inside the doc's home. After a few minutes of laboring, one guinea pig was found trapped inside his home, under debris. Ellis and some others came by to help get him out. Tibbetts saw the trapped guinea pig, and decided to come help as well. The guinea pig was laying down trapped from the chest down surrounded by blood, and unable to move. Ellis comes up to the pig and points at one of the helpers to grab his arms. \"We'll pull together,\" said Ellis. The other pig nods in agreement and they prepare to pull. Tibbetts watches from the side and notices something, \"The wood is impaled into his stomach!\" thought Tibbetts. \"If they pull him out from the debris, it will rip his insides and kill him.\" Tibbetts began to rush his position and shout saying stop, but it's too late. They pull the body out and the victim begins to bleed violently. Ellis and his helper attempt to control the gushing, but the victim bleeds out within seconds giving his last breath. Tibbetts stops short and looks down in failure. Afraid to say anything, he turns around and tries to help elsewhere. Suddenly, a guinea pig shouts from the distance, \"Can I get some help over here!?\" Tibbetts turns and rushes to their aid. He arrives with two other guinea pigs. They are at the edge of the village looking down into the valley, a body had fallen down it. Tibbetts was the first to come down the steep incline, followed by the two others. When he gets there, Tibbetts attempts to identify the body. It was an abyssinian guinea pig, sort of plump. Tibbetts is in shock when he turns to look at the face; It's Marlen! \"Marlen!?\" shouted Tibbetts. \"What was he doing down here?\" \"Probably trying to run away but got caught,\" answered one of the pigs. The two others arrive and begin lifting him up, taking him up the hill. Tibbetts stands aside and murmers to himself, \"Aw man, what's Ven gonna think about this.. I have to tell him.\" \"Thanks for helping!\" suddenly shouted one of the guinea pigs sarcastically towards Tibbetts. Tibbetts realized he was just standing there the whole time and apologizes. As they get out of sight, Tibbetts turns to Ven's home and decides to check up on him, telling the news. He climbs back up the hill, and is stopped short by a conversation between the villagers. It was with Ellis and a couple of villagers. \"So, who's gonna take over the village?\" asked a villager. Ellis responds, \"I think Julie should take over, she the last competent person alive in her family.\" \"Where is she?\" \"In the doc's home, recovering from this mess.\" \"Speaking of the doc, what about him? Who's gonna take his position?\" \"I can do it..\" said Ellis. \"I assisted Alec in multiple occasions.\" Alec was the old doc of the village. He was an old guinea pig, but was one of the smartest. Everyone loved him as he was sweet and had a gentle personality. But not anymore. \"Are you sure you're up to it?\" asked a villager. \"There's uhh, a lot of people in that house right now.\" \"Well.. Now it's my house so..-\" \"NO!\" shouted Tibbetts from the distance. The others turn as he moves closer. \"No, NO! You are not taking that house!\" \"You don't have a say in this,\" responded Ellis. \"Yes I do. According to you, Julie is taking over right? Being her brother, I take second in charge.\" \"Sorry but it doesn't work that way, it's by popular vote.\" \"And everyone already voted her as leader? And you as doctor?\" \"Pretty much.\" \"No! I will not stand for that bullshit. Prove it!\" \"Why? Do you wanna be the leader of the village?\" \"No, but-\" \"Okay then, shut up and go away.\" \"I wanna be the doctor...\" Ellis stops short and chuckles, \"You? Ha!\" \"I'm serious.\" \"Do you even know anything about doctoring?\" \"I know a lot about medical treatment, way more than you!\" \"No you don't, you didn't even help one person today.\" \"Because everyone was shoving me aside.\" \"Oh, that's just because you suck.\" \"...Prove that you got voted as doctor.\" \"You really want me too?\" \"Yes.\" The doctor pauses, then waives his arms in the air. \"Hey everyone! Attention!\" The village pauses their work and listens in. \"Tibbetts here wants to become the village doctor, as opposed to me!\" Everyone gives a confused look, some giving dirty looks at Tibbetts. \"Who here wants to vote for Tibbetts as doctor?\" Absolutely no one raises their hand. \"Anybody for me?\" Slowly hands begin to raise up, one by one. Each hand brought a bigger smile to Ellis's face. He turns to Tibbetts, \"You see?\" Tibbetts looks up knowing in the back of his mind, they made a bad decision. \"That's not even fair,\" hollered Tibbetts. \"You didn't even let me prove myself.\" \"You don't have to prove yourself, I already know what the people want.\" \"Yeah, but you don't know what they need .\" \"I do know, me.\" \"Okay motherfucker..\" Tibbetts balls his fist in pure anger. \"Screw y-\" All of a sudden, a siren is heard in the distance, it's sound echoing throughout the neighborhood and village. It spooks everyone, causing guinea pigs to pile up inside homes trying to take shelter. Bright flashing lights illuminate the neighborhood. Tibbetts scurries in the opposite direction, heading towards Ven's home. He rushes inside. Ven doesn't hesitate to invite Tibbetts inside, he slams the door shut. Tibbetts walks up to Ven looking out the window. \"What is it?\" asked Tibbetts. \"It's a firetruck, or ambulance,\" answered Ven. \"I've heard of those, it's like human doctors right?\" \"It's a vehicle, that carries.. human doctors.. just stay here.\" The vehicles park in front of the breeders home. Large footsteps are heard in front of the home, then banging on the front door. After no answer, they bust the door down, searching for any survivors. \"We found one!\" said one firefighter. \"Fire!\" said another one. \"In the backyard!\" They quickly gather a fire extinguisher from the truck, and put out the small fires in the backyard. Meanwhile, the ambulance personnel grab a stretcher and take the old lady, as well as her dog. One of the firefighters stand near the shattered back door, looking at the village. \"Why is there a bunch of model homes in the back?\" \"Who knows,\" answered another firemen. \"Maybe it was the lady's hobby. C'mon we have a job to do.\" The firefighters quickly clear out the home and head into their vehicles moving house to house, checking if anyone needs help. Back at Ven's home, he listens to the vehicles as they drive further away, lights getting dimmer and siren fading. Since the fires were extinguished, the village was now really dark, only being lit by the moon. Tibbetts was tending to Elliot, still resting from her incident earlier. And Ven was sitting up against the wall near the window, examining the makarov. Tibbetts turns to Ven, \"Hey, just wanted to let you know, I found your father.\" \"I'm assuming he's dead.\" \"Uh.. yes.\" \"I'm not even surprised anymore..\" He continues to study the pistol and realizes what Alexei had said about it. He looks out the window into the distance towards Alexei's home. \"I need to go.\" \"Where?\" asked Tibbetts. \"Back to Alexei. Stay here if you want, I need to make sure he's okay.\" \"That's fine, rather stay away from other people anyway..\" Ven holsters the pistol, and hops out the window, traveling towards Alexei.[Chapter 11] Chapter 10: Enemies lead towards enemies At Alexei's house Ven arrives at the wooden home, untouched from the machines. He looks in front of the house and sees the CD player, still shattered on the floor, but no Alexei. He pans around the area to find him and begins to worry. Suddenly, the russian pig appears in front of the porch, carrying what appears to be a hammer. Ven's expression showed relief that his friend was not harmed during this disaster. Alexei approaches the CD player, and turns to Ven. \"About time,\" said the dark brown guinea pig. His voice filled with dismay,\"You have my gun?\" Ven gestures at the pouch and unbuckles the belt. \"Good, you've done well.\" Ven puts the belt onto the table in front of the course, and returns to Alexei, \"What are you up to?\" asked Ven. \"You'll see.\" Alexei begins to hammer the machine, prying off the pieces as he goes along. Ven walks up next to Alexei, curious on what he's gathering on about. Ven studies the machine and sees a bright blue light glowing around the area Alexei was hammering at. Ven squints to get a better look, but can't make out what it is. \"Grab a hammer and help me break this,\" barked Alexei. Alexei hands Ven a second hammer that Alexei had brung out. The two begin to hammer away at the broken CD player. After a few good hits, the item in question begins to show itself, and appears to be a chip. It was gray in appearance, but had a blue tint from the electricity flowing in it. It had the word 'Saberling' marked on it, and a timer that read '00:00:00'. \"A computer chip?\" asked Ven. \"Not just any chip,\" said Alexei. \"I've seen this technology before.\" Alexei reaches into the machine and plucks the chip out of it. Ven silently watches and listens. \"It's a receiver.. Military grade.\" Alexei studies the chip in even further detail, \"Yeah.. We have these back home, they're designed to be put on unmanned drones or weapons.\" Ven looks at the small timer at the top, \"It has a clock.\" \"A timer.. Probably to tell the machines when to activate.\" Alexei looks in the distance to the village. \"This chip is probably in all of the machines.\" \"Any idea why?\" asked Ven. \"Nope... But..\" Alexei thought for a moment, then came up with an idea. \"If it's a transceiver, then whatever sent the signal out, can send it back.\" \"It's trackable...\" \"Yes. But better yet, it's possible to back track where the signal was sent sent from.\" He turns to look at Ven. \"We can find out who did all of this.\" \"How are you gonna figure that out?\" Alexei puts down the chip and begins to walk back inside his home, Ven follows. Alexei walks into his room, turning on the battery powered lamp and shoves the bed aside. Underneath it was a compartment, concealed by the wood floor. Alexei digs his finger on the sides and lifts the wood up revealing the contents. Inside was a plethora of gear, given to Alexei from russia. Included were some binoculars, a knife, satellite radio, a regular AM/FM radio, a handheld PDA, a vest, some general tools, and a IRP (Individualnovo Ratsiona Pitanee - The russian version of an MRE). There was a slot for a weapon and some ammo, but it was empty. Next to the case were a pair of keys, one that looks like it goes to a vehicle. \"This is... interesting,\" said Ven. \"I've never seen this.\" Alexei picks up the PDA and the satellite radio, \"All this gear was given to me for my mission in America, but I had no use for it, until now.\" \"What's with the keys?\" \"Don't worry about it. Come..\" Alexei walks back out his room gesturing Ven to follow. Ven knows in the back of his mind, they're for something important. Ven begins to walk out of the room, eyes fixed on the keys as he leaves. As he walks outdoors, he spots Alexei hooking up the chip to the PDA, using an adapter. He kneels down, blows the dust off the PDA, and powers it on. Ven walks up behind Alexei, and looks at the screen of the PDA. It reads in russian, but at the top was labeled, \"S.O.A.D\". \"You know, I remember you telling me that you came from russia, and that you used to be a spy,\" remarked Ven. \"But you never told me who you worked for exactly.\" Alexei paused then continued hooking up the PDA, \"It's not worth telling who I work for.. Use to work for.. Because you already know.\" \"SOAD.\" Ven read the text on the PDA. \"Yup, Special Operations Animal Division.\" Alexei successfully hooks up the machine and attempts to see if the PDA recognizes the chip. \"Was your job a tech specialist?\" asked Ven. \"Intelligence. My job was to infiltrate highly secure area's and gather information.\" The PDA beeps, signaling that it recognizes the chip. Alexei peers into the screen, going through the info. Ven attempts to read it, but can't understand the language. \"I was right,\" said Alexei. \"These specs match the database.. The chip is used in the unmanned US military weapons program.\" \"So the country attacked itself...\" \"Seems like it.\" \"That doesn't make any sense. Who would use their own weapons to hurt themselves?\" Alexei thought for a moment, \"Maybe it wasn't the government itself, hold on.\" Alexei digs into the files of the chip, and attempts to get the ip address. The chip locks him out, asking for an admin password. \"Shit,\" spurted Alexei. \"Of course the files are password protected.\" \"You can't get in?\" \"No I can.\" Alexei stands up taking the PDA and the chip indoors. Ven grabs the radio, as well as the holster, and follows. Inside, Alexei sets the chip and PDA on top of the workbench, then heads around the corner to his room. Ven sets the radio down next to the workbench, places the holster onto the table, and falls onto the couch, exhausted from the events earlier. Alexei re-appears around the corner, with another device in his hand, waiving it in the air. \"This baby will get us in,\" shouted Alexei. \"What is it?\" asked Ven. \"It's a code breaker. Designed to break passwords.\" \"I'm pretty sure your primary job was hacking.\" \"Nah.. I can do it, but it's not my job. That position belonged to one of my-\" He suddenly stopped short, as if something had hit him emotionally. Ven intervened, \"One of your..?\" \"Teammates.. A comrade.\" Alexei trembled, but shrugs it off, continuing to work on the PDA. Ven felt the pain in his voice and decides to change the subject. \"So, how does that thing work?\" asked Ven. \"I-It's generates random code based off probability.\" \"Sounds complex, does it take long?\" \"Depends on how advanced the code is on the chip.\" Alexei lectured. \"Could take a few minutes, could take all night. I have to mess around with the settings to get the best chance.\" \"Hmm..\" Ven leans back and begins to rest on the couch as Alexei continues the decoding. Back at Ven's Home Tibbetts is sitting up against the wall tending to Elliot, awaiting for her to wake up. He was dozing off, about to fully pass out. Suddenly, and abruptly, the front door blasts open, shattering in pieces. Tibbetts sharply gets up and retreats behind Elliot. A blender tries to fit inside, but can't. Instead, It busts down the wall, collapsing that half of the house. Tibbetts doesn't say a word and is in pure shock. The red blender turns around and looks at Elliot and Tibbetts. It raises one of it's legs and swings at Elliot. The sharp blade pierces through her neck and blood splatters everywhere. Tibbetts retreats even further up against the wall. The machine lifts the arms and swiftly attacks Tibbetts. The sharp blade is the last thing Tibbetts sees before it begins to cut into Tibbetts' chest. Tibbetts shrieks widly in panic- A loud knock on the door. Tibbetts awakes, dazed and disrupted from a nightmare. The door opens, and Tibbetts turns to see who it is. It was Ellis, the newly chosen doctor. Along with him, some people to assist him. \"Tibbetts.. I was wondering where you where at,\" said Ellis. Tibbetts trembles for a sec, trying to shake off the nightmare. \"W-what do you want?\" \"I'm getting accountability for everyone, and gathering the wounded.\" Ellis shifted his eyes over next to Tibbetts and sees another guinea pig, lying flat on the ground. \"Who's that?\" asked Ellis. \"That's Elliot.. Ven's mother.\" \"And you're just in here with her..\" \"I'm taking care of her, she's paralyzed from the chest down.\" \"How do you know that?\" Tibbetts sneered, \"It's a secret, I'm not gonna tell the pretend doctor, fuck that guy.\" \"Yeah, your real fucking funny you know that?\" \"Oh, I'm hilarious.\" Ellis kneels down next to Tibbetts, and speaks to him softly, \"You know, if there wasn't a group of people behind me right now, I would fucking beat the shit out of you.\" \"Do it, you won't..\" \"Did you not just hear what I said-\" \"NO BALLS!\" Ellis stands back up, \"I don't have time for this shit, leave this house!\" \"Make me.\" Ellis glares at Tibbetts, then gestures to the group next to him. They obey and approach Tibbetts, about to pick him up. Tibbetts places his hand in front of guinea pigs, and stands up under his own power. He sighs, then points at Ellis. \"Leave her be.. She really is paralyzed.\" Tibbetts continues. \"Make sure she lies straight like she is now, otherwise, you could kill her. And I swear if you do..\" \"My job is to save people.. Why would I kill her?\" \"You seem to have a lack of knowledge.\" \"Believe what you want to believe.. She'll be fine.\" \"She better be fine, or else.\" \"What are you gonna do about it?\" \"Not me, Ven.\" \"Pfft, I don't even think Ven cares about his family. He's not even here... Anyway you're wasting my time, please.\" Tibbetts raises his arms, \"Where am I gonna go?\" \"Home.. You're house isn't damaged.\" \"Wait, really?\" Tibbetts heads to the window and searches for his home. He spots it, sure enough, in perfect condition. In awe, he exits the home. Almost immediatly the door behind him slams. Confused, Tibbetts walks over to the side of the home, and looks in through the window. \"You know there's a window here, right?\" said Tibbetts towards Ellis. \"GO!\" shouted Ellis, seeming very annoyed at this point. Tibbetts smiles and turns his back, walking towards his home. The Next Morning, Alexei's home Everyone was asleep in the Alexei residence. Ven had blacked out on the couch from exhaustion, and Alexei fell asleep on the workbench. The PDA was still on, asking for a password. The morning sunshine, was exceedingly bright, and lit the interior with brilliance. It was peaceful, until suddenly a knock came from the front door. Ven instantly awoke and peered over to the front of the leaving room, eyes bloodshot from sleeping. He sits upright, groggy from bad sleep. The door knocks again. Ven wonders who it could be and looks over to Alexei, who is beginning to wake up. Ven grabs the pistol from the table and slowly walks to the front door. He opens it halfway, with the pistol concealed behind his back. It was Tibbetts! \"What? Why are you here?\" said Ven leaning on the door. \"Uh, there's something I wanna show you,\" responded Tibbetts. Alexei, finally awake, overhears in the back. \"Who is it?\" said the russian pig. \"Is it those bitches from a couple nights ago? Oh wait, they're probably dead...\" \"It's Tibbetts.\" \"That's even worse!\" \"I wanted to show you guys something,\" remarked Tibbetts. Alexei continues to ramble from around the corner of the house, \"Like what.. Did you finally find your penis?\" \"Seriously..\" \"I am serious, did you manage to find it?\" Tibbetts murmured, \"I definitely found something...\" \"Is it your penis?\" Tibbetts sighs, \"It involves last night!\" Ven interrupts, \"What about last night?\" \"It's on the TV.. T-the news channel. Something you might wanna check out.\" \"What's on it?\" Tibbetts glared at Ven for a few seconds, \"Yourself..\" Ven's expression turned questionable, and curious. He looks over to Alexei, who came from around the corner. \"Follow me,\" said Tibbetts.[Chapter 12] Chapter 12: News The three guinea pigs are passing through the village, looking at the wreckage. It had looked so much worse now that it was morning. It was quiet and no one was around, except for the machines, still on the ground lifeless. Tibbetts, Ven, and Alexei approach the shattered back door of the breeders home and look inside. There were voices coming from inside the home. Curious, they roam inside, trying to avoid the pieces of wood all over the floor. They look around, studying the home. Blood was on the wall and floor near the hallway leading to the bedrooms. Electricity ran through the house, lights were on in the kitchen and living room. The view was distracting to Tibbetts but gets overshadowed by the sound of voices, coming from the kitchen of the house. The kitchen was essentially the first thing you see when you come in from the back door. It was a U-shaped kitchen with the fridge on the right side against the wall. The center side of the kitchen had the sink, up against a window, viewing the front of the house. The left side had a old CRT television set sitting on it. It was tuned to a news channel, which is on commercial at the moment. A table was set up near the TV and had a broom laying on the side, leading to the top of the table. Guinea pigs flooded the table, almost to the edge, tring to watch the TV. \"Up here,\" guided Tibbetts. Alexei and Ven follow up the broom to the top. It seemed that a dispute was taking place. Everyone was arguing about the future of the village. \"Everyone stop bickering!\" shouted a guinea pig near the front. \"I'll stop after I get some fresh food, who gonna provide that!?\" shouted another pig. \"Better yet, who's gonna watch over us!? We're all stranded here!\" \"Okay I know,\" said that same guinea pig up front. \"We will all be fine, if we work together.\" Another pig inturrupted, \"We can't work together if we get seperated! How long do you think it'll be until animal control comes here and takes us all! Back to the humans? Hell no!\" \"This is all Ven's fault!\" shouted a female guinea pig from the right. Ven sharply turned, confused on what's even happening. \"We don't know if it's Ven, stop blaming him!\" said the guinea pig up front. \"You saw the same thing we did, where was he anyway? I didn't see him last night!\" Ven doesn't say a word, but turns to Alexei, who's just as confused. They continue, \"He was probably at that russian fuckers house.\" Alexei lashed out, \"Ay who the fuck are you!?\" Almost immediatly, everyone shuts up and turns around, spotting Ven and Alexei. \"Ven..\" said the guinea up front once again. It was an older guinea pig, named Hugo, a dark silver agouti. Next to him was Julie. Hugo was the new lead guinea pig of the village. He was appointed by Julie. \"What's going on here?\" said Ven. \"We're having a meeting.\" \"Sounds more like a riot.\" Another person lashes out, a dark orange a black guinea pig. \"For good reason! Where were you last night?\" \"I was here.\" \"At Alexei's!?\" \"Yes, but also in the village.\" \"I didn't see you, and neither anyone else.\" \"I saw him!\" shouted Tibbetts. \"Shut the fuck up Tibbetts no one cares about your opinion!\" Everyone gets worked up again, \"Woah, calm down!\" shouted Hugo up front. Suddenly, the news network comes back on. \"It's back on!\" shouted a random pig. \"Let Ven see!\" Everyone shuts up and listens in including Ven and Alexei. \"Welcome back,\" hollared the news network. \"For those of you just tuning in, the state of California is still under lockdown since the catastrophe of \"Sabersense\" took place. Many more reports of injuries are coming in since last night. The death toll has risen to over 1000 throughout the state of California, and more throughout the country. The CEO of Saberling appliances, Leanord Saber, is being held for questioning, and seemed to be a victim himself. Saying he has nothing to do with it, and was not involved with the sudden transformation of his appliances. More to come on that.\" \"This was a global event..\" whispered Ven to Alexei. The news network continued, \"If none of you saw it yet, here is the video, captured by a bystander at Leanord Sabers mansion. This was last night. The FBI are on the scene, then suddenly, a massive machine emerging from the ground up. If you look closely at the top, you can see what looks like, and you might laugh, a guinea pig and a mole at the top! The FBI are denying any questions about the rodents and why they were there.\" The amatuer footage was suprisingly clear, and the camera zoomed in on the machine. It had to be at least 75 feet high, and was made up of a bunch of different appliances combined together. The top of the machine had a small area, and you could clearly see the guinea pig that was up there. It was brown with white fur coming from the belly up over towards the eyebrows just like Ven's. \"What the..\" said Ven. \"No way.. That's not me.\" Alexei, baffled, just looks at Ven, speachless. \"How is that not you?\" said the orange and black guinea pig. He raises his voice to get the attention of the crowd, \"Hey everyone! How many guinea pigs do you know, that are able to do the things Ven can do?\" No one answers. \"I'm telling you that's not me,\" Ven raised his voice slightly. \"I was here, defending the village.\" \"With all the shit you and Alexei do, I have a hard time believing that.\" \"Don't worry Ven,\" said Hugo. \"We're not accusing you.\" \"This sounds very much like your accusing me.\" The dark orange pig continued, \"Who was the mole!?\" \"I honestly have no clue.\" said Ven. \"You're playing stupid, I kno-\" Hugo interrupts, \"Stop accusing Ven! It's pretty clear he also doesn't know what's going on.\" \"No!\" shouted the orange pig. \"He's the only one here capable of doing such a thing!\" The crowd gets anxious, and riled up. It starts getting out of hand getting out of hand. Many trying to work together, many trying to fight, Hugo couldn't control the crowd. Alexei, getting frustrated, unholsters his pistol. He aims it up to the roof and fires twice, dust from the roof comes floating down and everyone is in silence. \"We will figure out who did this to the village,\" bellowed Alexei, waving around the makarov. \"And we will bring revenge..\" He looks around. \"Ven, did not do this. He was not involved in the unforeseen events of which was last night, I can assure you.. Anyone who thinks otherwise, can test their knowledge against me and a bullet.\" Alexei points the gun at the crowd, \"Anyone?.. Good.\" The black and orange guinea stands up, \"I challenge that because I know your involved too!\" He walks closer, \"Fucking russian, trying to destroy this village-\" Blood mists in the air, and the guinea falls to the ground, bullet hole in the forehead. Alexei criticizes, \"I'm actually very faithful to this place, it has given me a lot.\" \"Alexei, what the hell!\" shouted Hugo. \"What? I fucking warned him. Look, now that's just one pig you don't have to feed anymore.\" \"No! Don't come here and bring that violence, we've dealt with enough! Just.. leave.\" \"Fine.\" Alexei holsters the pistol, \"I'm still true to my word. We will find out who they are , and get revenge.\" He turns to Ven, \"I'll see you back at the house.\" Ven doesn't answer, but gestures in agreement. Alexei gets onto the broom and slides back down, exiting the house. Meanwhile the group of guinea pigs remain on the table tending to the guinea pig shot, and disputing on what will happen. Tibbetts ganders at Ven, \"You're mother's awake now.\" \"She's okay?\" \"Yeah, she woke up earlier this morning wondering where you were. She's not here though.\" \"At my house right? Cause she's paralyzed..\" \"Correct.\" Ven looks around to see if anyone is watching. Everyone is mostly focused on the one guinea pig who was shot. Without parting ways, he swiftly exits the scene without being spotted. Tibbetts watches, then blends in with the crowd, curious of the dead body. He wonders if he could ask Alexei to shoot the doctor, Ellis, so that he would become the main doctor. At Ven's home Ven stands outside his half home, looking at it with distress. He walks in to see that the interior has been re-done. There was a piece of cloth near the window, being used as cot. Elliot was on the cot resting. \"She looks a lot better,\" thought Ven to himself. He really feels for her, being that she just lost her whole family in a matter of thirty minutes. A small makeshift table was next to her. On it, was a tray, full of food for her. The floor squeeks when Ven approaches her. She attempts to get up, but can't. She's only able to turn her head. \"Who's there?\" asked Elliot. Ven walks up besides her, \"It's me.\" \"Ven.. You're alive.\" \"I would hope so..\" \"How's Alexei?\" \"He's fine.\" Ven peeks over to the room Lillie was in, the body had been removed. \"So is it true?\" asked Elliot. \"What?\" \"Was it you and Alexei that caused all of this?\" \"...Did they tell you?\" \"They told me enough.\" \"You know, we just went through a drama involving them.. But no, I can promise you we didn't turn every appliance in the world into a killing machine.\" \"The world?\" wondered Elliot. \"Yes, apparentely this was a global event.\" \"I see, figured as much.. I knew you wouldn't do such a thing.\" Ven smiled, \"Me and Alexei are gonna find out who did this.\" \"That's the other thing.. Who was the guinea pig they saw?\" \"That's the best part of the story, it was someone on the news channel who looked like me, almost exactly like me.\" \"You saw it?\" \"Yeah, it's wierd, but they were right on one thing. Whoever that guinea pig is, most likely knows the most about this...\" Ven looks as if he's out of time, eager to head to Alexei's and figure out the mystery. \"I have to go,\" said Ven. \"Already?\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"Well I can't stop you.\" Ven turns and smiles, then exits the home, \"I'll keep you updated.\" He scurries off heading back towards Alexei's. The news channel is basically the scene from the first g-force when Darwin and his team were fighting clusterstorm, and facing Speckles[Chapter 13] Chapter 13: Search n' Lose Alexei's house By the workbench, Alexei was on his chair, trying to break the password to the chip's files. He's beginning to get frustrated, because the PDA was failing to get a correct password. Ven walks in, curious to know if any progress has been made. \"Anything?\" questioned Ven. The computer beeps on an incorrect password. \"Ugh!\" barked Alexei. He tosses the PDA against the wall in frustration. Ven walks past Alexei, and silently sits on the couch, gazing at the wall. Alexei turns and sees Ven, contemplating something. \"You're thinking about that pig, huh?\" said Alexei. \"It's just..\" responded Ven. \"It seems wierd that he looks just like me.\" \"A lot of guinea pigs look like one another, Ven.\" \"But this is too big of a coincidence.. Why was a guinea pig and a mole on top of a massive machine in the first place?\" \"Who knows.. If anyone does, they do.\" \"If we can find them.\" \"We will.\" Alexei looks over and picks up the PDA once more. He begins to generate another password for the chip. \"I promise we'll get revenge for this.\" \"I'm surprised you actually care.\" \"Do you not? They killed your family.\" \"I do.\" Ven pauses for a moment, \"But why do you care?\" \"I look out for my comrades.\" Ven, surprised to hear such cordial words, says no more and leans back against the couch looking out the window. A few hours later The sun was beginning to drop, and Alexei continued to generate passwords for the chip. He was leaning on the table, head on his hand, and seemed incredibly bored. The PDA was giving a low pitch beep every now and then, saying failed password. Alexei just continued re-pressing the generate button. Ven was cleaning the makarov with a piece of cloth. He was deep in the cleaning process, the gun almost completely disassembled. Suddenly, a high pitch beep came from the PDA. Alexei, dozing off, hears the beep and snaps out of it. Ven also looks over, curious to know what happened. Alexei glances over to the screen of the PDA. It flashes in russian, \"пароль принимать\" (Password Accepted). \"We're in!\" spurted Alexei. Ven puts the cloth down and gets up, anxious to know what's on the chip. The PDA flashed to a file browser, which was in english, and Alexei began digging through the folders. A few moments pass, and pictures came up on the PDA, \"These are.. profiles,\" said Alexei. \"Of what?\" asked Ven. \"The appliances?\" \"The only stuff here are blueprints, and plans on how the appliances are built.\" The dark brown guinea pig spots a file that has a peculiar name, Clusterstorm. He selects the file. Inside are the details of a mission and descriptions of certain people. \"Well shit!\" shouted Alexei. \"You found it?\" said Ven. \"It's all in this file, called Clusterstorm.\" \"Clusterstorm?\" \"According to this, every machine that saberling makes is called 'clusterstorm'. Their mission is to kill everything on sight.\" Ven asks, \"Who's responsible?\" \"It doesn't tell. It only says the company who makes the appliances, Saberling.\" \"So they're behind this..\" \"Wait.\" Alexei scrolls to near the bottom of the file and sees a whole bunch of random code. Part of the code had some numbers, which appear to be coordinates. He points to the screen and smiles at Ven, \"This'll be useful.\" There were a few sets of coordinates, but only two seemed readable. One read, 34°19'0.00\"N, 118°59'49.00\"W Another read, 34° 2'25.69\"N, 118°13'27.34\"W Alexei saves the coordinates and disconnects the chip. He grabs the radio next to him and powers it on. The machine blows some dust out from not starting for a few years. On top of the radio, had an antenna that could be opened up into a dish. Alexei opens it and connects his PDA to it. Ven stares at the machine, in confusion, begging for an explanation. \"This will connect me to a satellite,\" explained Alexei. The satellite will help me map out the coordinates to the PDA.\" \"I thought you said this was a radio,\" questioned Ven. \"It's a high and low gain antenna reciever, as well as a radio.\" \"These are the biggest words I've ever heard come out of you.\" \"Fuck you.\" Ven grins slightly, \"Can't your PDA connect to the satellite?\" \"Only to russian sats. But ever since I got here, It stopped working. The US somehow blocked any incoming links from non-american satellites. Most likely intended to stop people such as myself.\" Alexei wipes the dust off the radio, \"But this reciever can pick up on both types of satellites. It's a little old, but If I can get a link to an american satellite, then I can find out where these coordinates lead to.\" The machine's fan oscillates and seems unstable. It beeps, saying it has a successful connection. Alexei begins to type in the coordinates on his PDA. Suddenly the machine bugs out, shutting off. \"What the..\" murmured Alexei. He presses the power button repeatedly, with no response. \"So we're lost now,\" remarked Ven. Alexei kicks the machine in hopes that it will power on, no success. He then opens the battery compartment of the radio. \"Battery's dead.\" sighs Alexei. \"I might have more.\" Ven takes a seat on the couch as Alexei walks past into his room. He begins to reassemble the pistol, swiftly putting the pieces back together. Suddenly Alexei grudges, \"Fuck, I don't have any.\" \"There probably some in the breeders home,\" hollered Ven. Alexei pauses for a moment, then walks back into the room. \"Actually, there might be something better than batteries in that home.\" Ven turns to Alexei, \"I'm listening...\" \"Stay here, I'll be right back.\" Alexei grabs the PDA off the desk and exits the home, not giving Ven a chance to nod or respond. Ven accepts the situation and leans back into the couch, finalizing the assembly of the makarov. At the Breeders home The sun had almost fully set, sky was clear, and stars beginning to come out. Alexei approaches the breeders home and walks through the broken back door. He first glances at the kitchen and sees that all of the other guinea pigs had left. The kitchen lights were still on, as well as the television, which was still on the news network. Alexei looks around the kitchen and turns to the right; there was a hallway leading to the bedrooms. He moves into the master bedroom, which had a queen size bed in the center. On it was a laptop, with the screen flipped open. Alexei smiles, pleased that he found what he needed. He hops on the bed, gripping the cloth till he reaches the top. He proceeds in front of the laptop and connects his PDA to it via a small USB cable. The computer was locked out, but Alexei manages to bypass it easily, using his PDA's password cracking abilities. Once in, he opens the browser and types in the coordinates found on the chip. The first location pops on the map. It's a mansion at Somis, California. It's about fifty miles from where they're currently located. He then searches the second pair of coordinates. It shows on the map an abandoned warehouse, in the middle of downtown Los Angeles. Much closer at about thirteen miles. Alexei takes a mental note on these locations, and continues to research on the chip info saved on the PDA. The next morning Ven awakes on the couch, at Alexei's home. He glances around the home, wondering if Alexei had returned. He slowly gets up onto his feet and begins to search around the home. He walks into Alexei's room and takes a glimpse of the bed, still moved from yesterday. The secret compartment was open, but no Alexei present. Ven scratches his head, and walks out the front door onto the porch. It was a misty morning, a slight haze covered the bottom of the valley, and lower part of the village. Ven turns to the breeders home, and studies it. He suddenly realizes where Alexei is, remembering what he said the night prior. At the village Ven scurries through the village, heading towards the breeders home. On the way, he spots the doc's house, with a bunch of guinea pigs inside. Some appear to be arguing but Ven could not hear. Ignoring the noise, Ven continues on and approaches the house. He enters through the back door, and spots the hallway that leads into the bedrooms. He walks in, spotting the russian pig up top. Alexei is asleep near the computer, with the PDA still plugged in. Curiously Ven approaches the bed, but the wooden floor squeaks. Alexei immediatly wakes up and looks at Ven. \"Good morning,\" said Ven. Alexei doesn't respond, instead just stretches. Ven climbs onto the bed and approaches he laptop. \"Found anything?\" asked Ven. Alexei yawns, \"Do you want the short or long version?\" \"Is it that much?\" \"Yes.\" \"Okay, the short version.\" Alexei moves the mouse pad over to the maps window and clicks on it. \"I searched the two coordinates on the map and got these locations.\" Alexei points to the first location, which is fifty miles out. He continues, \"This mansion.. belongs to a man named Leanord Saber. He's the CEO of Saberling Appliances, and owns the company.\" \"He's our target,\" Ven exclaimed. \"Maybe, but he's already arrested according to this.\" Alexei clicks on a news page, showing a recent article on the CEO. \"It says that he's already detained, and actually has no part of it. According to him, this was supposed to be called Sabersense, not Clusterstorm.\" \"Sabersense?\" \"Something he proposed, saying that each chip inside allows each appliance to communicate to each other.\" \"Isn't that true..\" \"Yes, but it wasn't supposed to turn the machines into murdering contraptions.\" Ven gave a confused expression. Alexei clicks on the maps once more, and shows the other location. \"This is the other location found on the chip,\" explained Alexei. \"It's an abandoned warehouse, in the middle of Los Angeles.\" \"What's there?\" \"Nothing. I've spent all night looking for info. All I got, is that it's an abandoned locomotive factory. It's suspicious..\" \"Maybe it's like a.. secret lair, or something,\" questioned Ven. \"That's probably where the other guinea pig might be.\" \"Exactly..\" Ven glares at the computer for a moment, \"Where are we?\" Alexei clicks on the gps button, showing they're exact location. Ven studies the screen, and compares the distances between the two locations. \"The warehouse is closer,\" remarked Ven. \"About thirteen miles,\" interrupted Alexei. \"But considering the roads and hills, I would double that.\" \"Yes.. But I can't walk that distance, It would take me a week or two.\" Alexei smirks, \"You don't have to walk.\" \"What?\" Alexei closes the laptop and hops off the bed. \"Follow,\" said Alexei, signaling to Ven. The two guinea pigs walk out the bedroom and eventually out of the house. As they walk out, they spot the remainder of the village guinea pigs gathered at the doc's house. A couple were complaining about the village and how poor the living quality is. \"I'm sorry, but we honestly could have a better life out in the wild!\" shouted a guinea pig. \"Well good luck getting eaten!\" shouted Ellis, the doc. \"We'll be fine, at least we will have a chance at food!\" The guinea pigs continued to squabble as Ven and Alexei walk by. \"The village is going to shit,\" thought Alexei to himself. \"I might have to change locations soon..\" Ven followed behind, continuing to ignore the village members as he's too curious to know where Alexei is taking him. Alexei's home Alexei leads Ven into his home, roaming into the bedroom to re open the secret compartment. Inside are the keys that Ven studied earlier. Alexei takes them out and walks out the back door, Ven still following. He continues to roams out into the wilderness towards the edge of the hill, leading into the valley. Alexei hops down and continues through the dense grass, until reaching a dark, dense part of the valley. He breaks through a rough patch of grass, that leads to a clear area. He stops short and waits for Ven. Ven breaks through, and sees it. \"Woah.\" said Ven softly. It was a miniature dune buggy, covered in leaves. It was orange in color, and had a small roll cage. The vehicle had seats for two, and a open compartment in the rear for equipment. A gas tank was located in between the seats and the rear compartment, next to it, a small motor. Alexei walks closer to the vehicle, clearing the leaves off. \"This.. Is yours?\" wondered Ven. \"Yup, used it to move around here in the US.\" \"I'm surprised you never shown me this.\" \"Never needed too.\" Ven walked around the vehicle, checking it out, \"So, we're using this to check out the warehouse?\" \"If it starts..\" Alexei hops into the buggy, \"It's been sitting here for a couple of years, only being started every few months..\" Ven stands back, as Alexei sticks the key into the ignition. He turns the key, turning the motor with hesitation. After a few attempts, the motor begins to sputter to life. Suddenly, black smoke comes out of the tiny muffler in the back and the engine roars to life. \"Ha, I knew she would start!\" shouted Alexei. Ven smiles and walks up to the passenger side of the buggy, looking inside. \"Well?\" said Alexei to Ven. \"Hop in!\" Ven pauses for a moment, then jumps in the passenger seat. Alexei grabs the stick and sets it to 'Drive'. The buggy jerks forward, then Alexei stomps on the gas. The motor billows out more smoke, then speeds off with great acceleration. Ven and Alexei bounce around in the vehicle, as it has no seatbelts. Alexei drifts it around the tree, then makes his way back up the hill towards his house. The vehicle cuts through the grass with no effort and ramps the hill at the top of the valley. It goes airborn for a few moments, but lands perfectly. Alexei then powerslides next to his home, parking it almost perfectly perpindicular to the house. \"Wow..\" said Ven. \"I think we can pull this this off.\" \"She'll definetaly get you there and back no problem,\" responded Alexei. A small beep then came from the buggy, Alexei looks at the gauge. \"It needs gas..\" said Alexei. He turns off the vehicle and gets out. Ven grabs the roll cage and pulls himself out, while Alexei walks inside his home. He comes back out with a knife and a small bucket. \"Here, take the buggy to the old ladies car,\" said Alexei handing Ven the tools. \"She's not gonna need it anymore, so cut a hole from the bottom of her gas tank, and fill her up.\" Ven nods and puts the bucket in the back, but stops short. \"Curious.. Are you driving there?\" asked Ven. \"You are.\" \"I don't know how to drive a car.\" \"You gonna learn.\" \"Uh, okay.\" Alexei points to the drivers seat, \"Get in.\" Ven walks around to the drivers side of the buggy, and hesitates to get in, slightly nervous. Once inside, Alexei walks up to Ven, poining at the various instruments. \"That's the gas, press down on it to go faster, next to it is the brake. Press on that to slow down.\" Alexei then points to the transmission. \"That stick is what makes you get into gear, it has four modes. Drive high and low, neutral and reverse. Drive low will make you go about two to five miles per hour. Drive high will get up to almost twenty. Neutral and reverse are self explanatory.\" \"I'm assuming this gauge is for telling me how fast im going,\" said Ven, pointing to the speedometer. \"And this is for the amount of fuel available?\" \"Yes, exactly. It's not hard, try and start it up.\" Ven turns the key and the buggy starts up without hesitation. He puts his hands on the wheel, vibrating from the engine. \"Now,\" instructed Alexei. \"Put the transmission into Drive High.\" Ven grabs the stick and swiftly puts the vehicle into gear, the buggy jolts foreward. \"Now remember, Gas and brake!\" shouted Alexei. \"Now, go get some gas before it runs out.\" Ven presses on the gas slightly and the buggy accelerates away. He grabs the wheel and turns it towards the tree. \"This is.. easy!\" thought Ven to himself. He gathers confidence and accelerates to the tree and circles around it a few times. The buggy beeps again, saying it needs fuel. Ven then drives away from Alexei and heads to the front of the breeders home, siphoning fuel from the breeders car. A few minutes later Ven returns with a full tank, as well as a full bucket of gasoline. Alexei is sitting on his back porch, he spots Ven and approaches him. \"Well done, how was it?\" asked Alexei. \"It was surprisingly easy,\" answered Ven. \"Good, now turn it off and come inside.. We have some planning to do.\" \"Planning?\" \"Come in, I have something to show you.\" \"You're just full of surprises today.\" Ven cuts the motor, and follows Alexei inside, curious once more on what's about to happen.[Chapter 14] Chapter 14: Mission Brief Ven enters the dark home, and shuts the door behind him. On the wall to the right, a board was setup. On it, were some pictures being held up by push pins. The pictures contained various locations, some were just drawings. Alexei gestures to Ven to sit on the couch. \"Your training.. is about to be put to the test,\" said the russian pig. \"I feel like that's everyday now,\" answered Ven. \"No, this will be the final test.\" \"Explain.\" \"This is an actual mission, also your first.\" Alexei turns to the board, and points to the first picture. It was a map, showing their location. \"We're here, and here is the enemy location. This mission spans two days. Day one starts tomorrow morning. Take the buggy, and travel to the enemy location. Based off the distance, it might take you several hours to arrive.\" Alexei points to the warehouse picture, then continues. \"Once you get there, infiltrate the warehouse, and scout the area. If you spot any clues involving clusterstorm, you're in the right place. There is a chance that you might encounter the enemy, aka your evil twin.. If you do see him, subdue and capture him.\" \"I'm surprised you don't want me to shoot on site,\" said Ven. \"If the pistol was suppressed, then maybe. This is a stealth mission, don't give off your position. Once you capture him and clear the area, your free to do as you wish.\" \"Got it.\" \"Anyway, once you leave, you're most likely gonna need fuel. The bucket of fuel you brought is your tank of gas to get back. By the time you do all that, it should be late afternoon. You're going to need to find a place to rest for the night, I'll leave that up to you. Leave as soon as you wake up, then be here by noon the next day.\" Alexei pauses for a moment, \"Sadly, I will not be joining you due to the fact that I've grown old and would be a hindrance to the mission.\" He reaches for the holster besides him sitting on the kitchen table. He places it on another small table in front of Ven, sliding it to him. \"This is your mission... Use it if you have too.\" Ven gazed at the pistol, \"I understand.\" \"Use the satellite reciever for GPS,\" said Alexei. \"I found batteries in the old ladies home, so it should be working for the entirety of the mission. Do you have any questions?\" \"I don't,\" answered Ven. \"We need to start packing the buggy with supplies... Grab some food and put it on the buggy. I need to get those batteries from the home.\" \"Sounds good.\" The two guinea pigs split apart gathering supplies for the mission. Alexei headed towards the breeders home to grab some batteries to power the GPS, and Ven stays to pack the vehicle. The gathering took a few hours, and they finish by late afternoon. \"That should work,\" said Alexei, tightening the GPS down with a small strap in the back of the buggy. The buggy was almost completely full. In the trunk area, it had food and water to last three full days. It also included the satellite reciever, which had a wire running to the front of vehicle. The wire led to Alexei's PDA to show their current position. Also in the back was the bucket of extra gas, sealed off so that it won't spill. In a small compartment behind the drivers seat, was some extra tools and parts Ven might need in case of emergencies. The passenger seat was empty, and for good reason. \"On the floor of the passenger side...\" said Alexei. \"I put a big bag there for you to gather some evidence, it's big enough to fit a body if need be.\" \"Oh that's nice,\" said Ven. \"At least I don't have to look at a dead carcus on the way back. \"I look after my comrades.\" \"I'm pretty sure you just don't want blood on the seats.\" \"Alexei smirks, \"Let's grab some dinner.\" Alexei begins to walk towards his home. Ven glances at the village, specifically at his home. He begins to wonder on the health of his mother. \"I'll be right back,\" said Ven. Alexei turns and sees Ven staring at the village. He knows what Ven is thinking. \"You're gonna miss dinner,\" said Alexei. \"I won't, just need to check on someone.\" \"Whatever, I'll be here.\" Ven goes on all fours and heads towards the main village. At the village Ven approaches the village and notices the lack of people around. Suddenly, he gets stopped by a couple of pigs. \"Ven!\" shouted one of the pigs. It was Hugo. With him was Julie. Ven turns to the pig, wondering why he got stopped. \"We don't want any trouble,\" said the old pig. \"I'm only here to check on my mother,\" said Ven. \"Are you? Where's Alexei?\" \"He's back at his home.\" \"I see, you and him are.. uh, not really popular right now.\" \"I can tell, being that everyone is hiding.\" \"For good reason, I'm trying to keep everyone safe. So don't take this the wrong way, but for right now, can you leave the village?\" \"I live here..\" \"I understand that, but for the best interest of the people, you and Alexei need to stay away for a few days.\" \"I just want to check on Elliot, then I'll leave.\" Hugo pauses, then lets on a sigh, \"I literally can't stop you Ven.. So please, make it quick.\" Ven looks away from the two, re-focusing on his home. He scurries away to the half destroyed house. He spots a guinea pig near his doorway, it's Tibbetts. Ven approaches, \"Tibbetts? What are you doing here?\" asked Ven. \"Ven?\" said Tibbetts. \"I was wondering about you.\" \"Why are you here?\" \"It's literally the only place I can be left alone.\" \"You're home doesn't count?\" \"It does, but people visit that place too often. I like being here, alone.\" Ven takes a peak inside, \"She's doing better,\" said Tibbetts. \"Resting right now... Sorry but, she is definitaly paralyzed for life.\" Ven opens the door and walks inside, Elliot awakes as Ven approaches her. \"You're back.. Ven,\" sofly whispered Elliot. \"I have some news,\" said Ven. \"News?\" \"We might have found the people on the TV.\" \"You mean the one that looks like you?\" \"Maybe, I really don't know.\" \"I don't get how.\" \"Alexei had his ways.\" Tibbetts overhears the conversation, and eavesdrops in. \"So what now?\" asked Elliot. \"We came up with a plan, to kidnap the people who did this.\" \"The people who did this might be more than just that one pig.\" \"It's a dangerous mission.\" \"Yeah, a little much for you, don't you think?\" \"I'll be fine.\" \"Your confidence is gonna get you killed, Ven. I can't afford that please.\" \"Alexei gave me his pistol for the mission, I can defend myself.\" \"Please be safe..\" Elliot pauses for a moment, \"How long are you gonna be gone?\" \"Only for tomorrow. I should be back the day after, hopefully with the dead body of a guinea pig.\" Elliot looked concerned, \"Ven, If you find him, don't kill him.. Revenge get's you no where, everyone has the right to life. Let him tell his story.\" \"I'll try.\" \"And please again, don't get hurt. If I lose you, I wouldn't have a reason to be on this planet.\" \"I'll be fine, but Alexei is a different story.\" \"Keep an eye on him please.\" \"I trust his judgement.\" Ven looks out the window, \"See you when I get back.\" Elliot places her hand onto Ven, a warm touch from a mother in distress. Ven smiles, then turns and hops out the window, glancing at her one last time before running away. Tibbetts watches as Ven scurries off back to Alexei's. \"He found the people who caused this?\" murmured Tibbetts to himself. \"Finally, the village can see that Ven isn't the enemy here.\"[Chapter 15] Chapter 15: Road Trip The next morning was cool, and crisp; Light fog gathered in the valley and the grass was misty. The sun barely risen, and skies clear. Ven puts on the holster and tightens the strap. He then slides in the makarov, holding two full magazines, then closes the pouch. Ven sighs, then walks out the back door, where Alexei is setting up the GPS on the satellite reciever. \"It's 0530,\" remarked Alexei. \"You should arrive around 1300.\" \"Eight hours.\" responded Ven. \"It's a lengthy trip, I'd recommend taking a small break every other hour or so.\" \"I hope this intel is right.\" \"We'll see tomorrow.\" Ven walks by Alexei, and hops in the driver side of the buggy. The GPS is set for the warehouse and the route is shown. Ven inserts the key into the ignition and starts the motor. Alexei comes up to the driver side and leans inwards towards Ven. \"Remember..\" spoke Alexei. \"In then out, you're not there for scene viewing. Stay focused and don't get distracted. Only use the makarov as a last resort, you only have two mags.\" \"Understood,\" said Ven. \"Don't worry, I promise I will return with revenge.\" Alexei grins, proud of his teachings that passed onto Ven over the years. He backs away from the vehicle, \"Good luck, old friend.\" Ven nods, and puts the vehicle into drive and speeds off. Alexei watches until the buggy goes out of sight, then returns indoors into his home. In the distance, Tibbetts watches Ven take off in the vehicle, wishing the best of luck to Ven as well. A couple hours pass A small village gathering is taking place near the doc's home. Most of the guinea pigs have recovered from the traumatizing experience, and are now more focused on food and the future of the village. The population of the village is down to about twenty guinea pigs. The others seperated themselves from the village, living in the wild and fending for themselves. The remainder gathered at the doc's home, debating. \"Okay everyone,\" said Hugo. \"You are what's left of the village. We have enough food gathered from the breeders home to last about three or four more days. I believe we can rebuild..\" \"We need to build more homes,\" remarked Ellis, the doctor. \"I can't have ten of you living with me at once, unless you need medical care.\" \"Does anyone know how to build a home?\" asked the lead pig. \"Alexei does,\" shouted one guinea pig. \"He built his own home, right?\" \"Yes..\" said Hugo. \"But I don't think he's willing to help us.\" \"Force him.. He's part of this village.\" \"I'd rather not force the guy who has a gun.\" \"What other choice do we have?\" Hugo thought for a moment, and couldn't really think of any other answers. He sighs, \"The most we can do is ask.. Even that's kinda risky.\" \"We also gotta worry about Ven, they're always together..\" \"Not today,\" spoke Tibbetts, hiding in the back if the crowd. Everyone turned, then Hugo questioned, \"What do you mean?\" Tibbetts stands up straight, \"He's not with Alexei right now, he's out on a mission.\" \"A mission? How do you know this?\" \"I heard it myself, and saw Ven leave earlier this morning. Him and Alexei claim they found the people responsible for the destruction. Ven is on a mission to bring back the person we saw on the TV.\" \"That's impossible,\" said Ellis. \"You can shit a brick for all I care,\" shouted Tibbetts. \"Oh, that's it-\" \"No, STOP!\" spurted Hugo. \"We're not doing this bullshit again! We need to work together if we're gonna survive.\" The two guinea pigs settle down and re focus their attention. \"Go on..\" said the lead pig. \"He's going to get revenge for the destruction of our village. He should be back by tomorrow around noon.\" \"Interesting, but that doesn't help our current situation.\" Ellis sighs, \"So Tibbetts, do you have a plan?\" \"No, having Alexei help us rebuild homes might actually be our best bet.\" \"You think you can go and ask him?\" wondered Hugo. \"I can't go.. Last time I got near that house, I had a gun two inches from my face.\" \"Hmm, maybe if we get him on his good side..\" \"Does he even have a good side?\" asked Ellis. \"Everyone has a good side, we just need to know what he likes.\" \"Isn't he russian?\" asked another pig. \"Just give him some Vodka and women, he'll cheer up.\" \"Where are we gonna get Vodka?\" said Hugo. \"Well, we got women.\" The guinea pig points to the back, where two beautiful girls stand together. \"He's an older man, he'll love 'em.\" \"Na-ah, we are not going in that house with that man!\" shouted one of the girls. \"I agree,\" said Ellis. \"I'm not gonna let those girls go anywhere near Alexei.\" Hugo heavily, \"W-we actually might have no choice.\" The two girls expression turned pale, dreaded on the choices everyone is making. Hugo looks the girls, \"Just go in there and act, uh.. sexy.. Convince him to help out the village.\" The girls retaliate, \"No! It's not happening.\" \"Please.. You're the last hope of the village.\" Tibbetts walks up to the girls, \"Alexei isn't gonna hurt you. Trust me, he's pretty fond of girls, and soft around them.\" \"How do you know?\" \"I knew the last girls who would go every other night, they actually enjoyed it.\" \"And where are these girls?\" Tibbetts looks down in sorrow, \"Umm, I'd rather not say.\" Hugo continues, \"Please.. if you can get him to trust us, we can all live a better life.\" The girls look at each other, contemplating an answer. They glance around, seeing the desperation in the village. After a few moments, they turn to the village leader. \"Fine..\" one of the girls said annoyingly. \"We'll do it.\" \"Oh thank god,\" Hugo. \"Thank you so much, you're in debt to this village.\" \"When do we go?\" \"Later tonight, when it's quiet.\" \"Do we just ask or..\" \"Stay with him, have a little fun. Get him in such a mood, that he'll do anything to please you. That's when you'll drop the questions.\" \"Okay, we'll try.\" Ellis looks down, hands on his face in embarassment, \"I can't believe we're actually doing this.\" Hugo looks down besides Ellis, \"I'm sorry, we have to do what's right for the village.\" \"Still, I don't like where this is going,\" answered Ellis. \"Me neither, but we'll see what happens.\" A few more hours pass Ven is minutes away from the location. He drives around the city of Los Angeles, avoiding as much attention as possible. Ven has never been in the city before, so he takes in the scenery, but mostly stays focused on the mission. The journey has been eventful, but went well for the most part. He looks at the GPS, stating that the warehouse is around the corner. Ven starts getting anxious as his vehicle approaches the corner. He get's the first actual view of the street. It was empty, and had trash littered all over the ground. He spots a large warehouse down the street that says \"ACME\" on the top. He looks at the building in bewilderment. Is this the place Ven was looking for?[Chapter 16] Chapter 16: The Abandoned Warehouse? Ven stops the buggy down the street from the abandoned warehouse, and looks the PDA. The time shows 1241, twenty minutes ahead of schedule. He studies the building from the distance, at the top it reads 'ACME Exterminators Pest Control'. \"Pest Control?\", said Ven to himself. He drives closer to get a better look, but stays out of sight. Ven comes up to next to the warehouse, and parks it next to a fence, out of view of the building. He turns off the buggy, and gets out. Ven scurries up against a neighboring building, and peaks around the corner. The warehouse looked old, but not abandoned. Suddenly, Ven spots a security camera, then multiple security camera's all over the building. But were the cameras active? Why would a pest company have this much security? Are the people even still here? These are questions Ven asked himself, suspicion surrounded this area. He takes a quick moment to find a secure entrance to the building. Up, on top of the building were no cameras, and had windows; perfect for surveillance. Ven grins, then makes his way across the driveway, keeping himself out of sight from the cameras. He goes up against the brick wall of the warehouse. A small rain gutter ran down the building beside Ven. He approaches the gutter and grabs hold onto the side, following it up to the roof. Once on top, Ven scuttles along the hot surface and spots the main windows. One of them appeared to be shattered, but was covered by a plastic black trash bag. Ven approaches the window and moves the bag aside to get a look at the interior. \"What the..\", murmured Ven in awe. Located inside was not the typical pest control tools you'd expect. Instead, a elaborate set of pipes, and equipment. Man made tools, housing, and gear flooded the interior of the warehouse. Ven quickly realizes that this no pest control operation, and is definitely sure that this the location of the enemy him and Alexei have been searching for. Suddenly, voices in the distance, coming from other side of the building. It sounded like people conversating, but Ven was too far away to comprehend. He knows he has to go inside to get a better look, so he takes a moment to prepare himself. Ven glances down to the makarov, and unholsters it. He loads a round into the chamber, then reholsters the pistol. Ven takes a deep breath, then enters the building, following the sounds. He travels along the wall, on the piping. As Ven travels, he studies the interior, taking a mental note of everything he sees. Suddenly, he spots a glimpse of a person around some gear. The man was standing upright, his back towards Ven. Ven quickly gets out of sight behind a small wall above ground. Ven was a lot closer now, and could clearly understand the conversation. He peeks over the wall, and eavesdrops in. \"Like I said earlier..\" said the man. \"We need to make sure we stay out of publicity.\" The man points to something on the table, out of sight to Ven. \"Blaster, especially you..\" \"What I do?\" asked another voice. The voice was slightly harsh, but comedical. The man continued, \"You're the loudest mouth here, so I need you to take extra precaution out on the field.\" The man returns his attention to what seems to be a group of people. \"This operation needs to stay classified. If it goes public, we will get shut down.. again.\" Ven attempts to see who the man was talking too, but no one seemed to be in the area. Ven began to move to a better spot, then stopped short. He did a double take on what he saw next. A rodent came in view, it was a guinea pig. A silver agouti guinea came up to the man and spoke. She was wearing what looked like a small earring on one ear, and in the other, a weird device. The device had a small microphone leading to the front of the guinea pigs mouth. \"Don't worry Ben,\" said the guinea pig. It was a female with a spaniard accent. She continued, \"I can take care of the boys.\" The man, Ben, responded, \"I hope so.. Juarez, please keep them in check, I don't want another thing like this to happen again.\" \"I'll do my best.\" Ven was boggled by the fact a guinea pig just spoke to a human. But more importantly, Ven wondered why they seem disgruntled. Ben turned his head, \"Darwin?\" \"Yes?\", said another voice. It was a lower pitch voice, similar to Ven's in tone. \"The Clusterstorm mission was definitely a success, and proved us out in the field. But this news thing really blew out of proportion. In the future, if you can, keep your head down.\" \"Understood.\" \"Darwin, I always believed in you, let's not blow what took years to build.\" Ven hears the word, 'clusterstorm'. This confirmed to Ven that he was in the right place. Although, Ven was incredibly curious on who Darwin was, and moves to the right while staying in cover to get a better look. He once again, peeks over the small wall, spotting another pig looking at Ben. It was him, the one from the television. He looked identical to Ven, almost indistinguishable. He too, was wearing the device on his ear. Ven trembles for a second, in disbelief that he's this close to the enemy. His heart rate increases, small flashbacks from clusterstorm come back, distracting him. He goes back into cover to calm himself down. After a few moments of gathering his thoughts, he peeks back over the wall. Darwin and Ben had just finished conversing and they split up, Ben points to another guinea pig. A black guinea pig shows up. He had a white patch of fur on his nose, and was wearing the device as well. \"Blaster, can I speak to you in private?\" said Ben. \"Why me?\" said the black guinea pig, Blaster. \"You're not in trouble.\" \"I hope not, I need to get back to training.\" The two head into a smaller room, below Ven. Ven re focuses onto Darwin, who appears to be walking towards a indoor compound. Ven takes action, and quietly follows Darwin from the distance, staying out of sight. Darwin heads to the top of the small compound. It was a three story compound, with what appears to be a bedroom on each floor. The bedrooms' interiors were blocked out of sight, making it a perfect place for Ven to strike. Ven watches Darwin closely from the distance, seeing him about to enter the room. Darwin's room in specific was on the top floor of the compound. Nothing was above it but a flat roof. Darwin approaches his room, the entry door marked the letter 'D'. He goes in and shuts the door behind him. Ven rushes along the side of the building, staying on the pipes and keeping out of sight. He comes up above the compound, and looks around before jumping down. Swiftly and quietly, Ven hops on the roof of the compound, making sure that he doesn't make any noise. He comes up above Darwin's door, and thinks of the best course of action. The roof of the enclosure had debris laying everywhere, and clearly looked unfinished. Ven began to look around for anything useful. He quickly spots a small metal rod that fits perfectly in his hand. Taking the rod, Ven places it down next to the door, trying not to make any noise. On the door, was a small ledge running along the top. Ven carefully stands on the ledge directly above the door, back against the wall balancing himself. He pauses for a moment, then uses the bottom of a foot to knock on the door. He knocks twice, then waits. Ven hears footsteps coming from inside room, the door opens. Darwin looks outside his room to see no one in the vicinity. Suddenly, Ven swoops down turning around and grabbing the ledge, kicking Darwin in the chest. The sweeping lunge kick knocks Darwin off his feet onto the ground behind him. The force knocks the wind out of him, and he groans. Ven lands on his feet, and picks up the metal rod. He scuttles inside the room and approaches Darwin. Darwin gasps for air, then glances at the intruder; he attempts to get up. Ven takes no time for Darwin to react and swings the rod, hitting him in the head. The force of the blow came with a small amount of fur and blood, as Darwin drops to the ground, unconscious. Finally G-Force is directly involved! Now I can officially call this a G-force fanfic.[Chapter 17] Chapter 17: Kidnap! Ven stared at the battered body, lifeless in front of him. He places the pole out of sight, then peeks outside, making sure nobody had heard him. Wasting no time, he returns to Darwin, picking up the body and carrying it outside the room. On the way out, he spots the device Darwin was using to talk to humans. It was knocked off Darwin's head when Ven swung the rod. He picks it up, then leaves the room. After shutting the door, he makes sure nobody has spotted him, then dashes out of sight. Outside Ven places Darwin next to the buggy, then grabs the big bag Alexei had given him. He opens it, laying it flat on the ground. Ven once again returns his attention towards Darwin, astonished by the fact they look so similar. Trying to put that aside, he picks up Darwin, and places him as well as the small device into the bag. He then places the bag into the buggy's passenger seat, securing it down so that it won't shift around. Ven leaves the bag slightly open so that Darwin could breath, he wants him to be alive when they return. Ven then hops into the driver's seat and starts up the buggy. He puts the vehicle into 'Drive', and takes a glance at the warehouse. Hesitating to drive off, Ven contemplates whether if he could have done more. He turns to the body bag, \"Who did I just kidnap?\" Ven asked himself. Curious to know more, he shuts off the vehicle and gets out, heading back inside the warehouse. At Darwin's room Ven successfully re enters the warehouse unseen and it appears that no one has noticed Darwin's 'disappearance'. Ven takes this time to head back into Darwin's room to get more info on his motives. As we walks in, he shuts the door behind him and scours the room for info. He comes up to a drawer and a table. On top of the tabel was a golden badge. Ven picks up the badge, studying it carefully. On it, was marked \"FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION\". On the bottom marked, \"SPECIAL AGENT\". \"Special Agent?\" murmured Ven to himself. \"The FBI is behind this?\" He digs through the folders in his drawers. In them were mostly just pictures of the other guinea pigs, but one paper stood out the most. It was a folder of some sorts. On the top read, \"SECRET, FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\". Ven opens the folder to see a photo of Darwin, paper clipped to a stack of other papers. On the first page, showed Darwin's personal info. Name: Darwin Occupation: Commander, Leader of G-Force DOB: Exact Date Unknown (2007) Age: 2 Race: Guinea Pig Affiliation: Federal Bureau of Investigation Family: Unknown Origin: Unknown Reporting Individual: Ben Known Affiliates: Juarez, Blaster, Mooch, Speckles... The page continued with a plethora of information. Soon, Ven lost track of time, and had spent about 5 minutes in the room. The door knocks. Ven freezes in position hoping if he doesn't answer, they will leave. Suddenly the door opens, It was Juarez. \"Darwin?\", said Juarez. Ven doesn't respond, instead he keeps his back against her. \"Can I come in?\" asked the spaniard guinea pig. Ven puts down the folder back into the drawer, closing it. Juarez enters the room, slowly getting closer to Ven, \"Are you.. Okay?\" She pauses waiting for a response, nothing. \"I know you're upset from what happened, but there's no need to give me the silent treatment.\" Ven continues to stand still as Juarez approaches Ven. She notices the belt and holster. \"What are you wearing?\" asked Juarez, in a desperate attempt to start a conversation. \"...\" Juarez comes up directly behind Ven. She places her right rand onto Ven's back, softly rubbing his fur. Juarez carefully lifts her hand to rest onto his shoulders, \"Darwin?\" She reaches around, attempting to hug Ven. Immediately, Ven ducks down and elbows Juarez in the nose; blood immediately began to trickle down her face. She shrieks in pain, dazed and confused. Before she even got a chance to retract her arm, Ven grabs hold of it and pulls Juarez over his shoulders. Her elbow snaps, causing her arm to rotate in a very unnatural angle. Juarez yelps as her body slams onto the ground. It was so loud, that everyone in the building could hear it. Ven had to shut her up, so he swiftly kicks her face, knocking her out, and cracking the jaw line. Suddenly voices began to ring from outside, Ven's cover is blown. He quickly peeks out, spotting Blaster, who was rushing in his direction. Blaster spots Ven from afar, \"Darwin!\" shouted Blaster, also fooled by the appearance. \"What happened!?\" Ven quickly runs in the opposite direction towards the pipes and makes his way towards the windows. \"Darwin!?\" shouted Blaster. \"Where ya going!?\" Blaster approaches Darwin's door, and sees Juarez, bruised and bleeding on the floor. He takes a second to comprehend what happened. Ben catches up, \"What's going on?\" \"I don't know!\" responded Blaster. \"Juarez is hurt though!\" Blaster goes and tends to the beaten pig.\" \"Where's Darwin?\" asked Ben. \"He ran away, but I swear I'm gonna kill him for hurting Juarez!\" \"Ran away?\" Ben searches the area, and spots Ven, almost at the exit. \"There he is!\" shouted Ben. \"Where!?\" shouted Blaster. Ben points to the guinea pig, frantically running away. Blaster puts down Juarez softly, and preps himself, \"Oh that's it!\" \"Blaster let him!\" hollered Ben. \"No!\" Blaster began to chase Ven. Ven escapes the warehouse and goes through the window, stopping for only a second to check behind him. He then continues to dash across the rooftop, approaching the gutter. Ven prepares to climb down. \"STOP!\" shouted Blaster. Ven pauses and turns around, Blaster just a few feet away. He takes a close look at Ven's face, and expression. \"Wait..\" said Blaster. \"You're not Darwin.. Who are you!?\" Ven slightly grins, then pulls out the makarov and fires at Blaster. The sound echoes throughout the area, then a shell hits the ground besides Ven. \"Agh!\" screeched Blaster as blood starts flowing down the black fur. He was hit in the left shoulder, and was on the ground, unable to move. Ven points the gun at Blaster's head, prepared to finish him off. Blaster held his arm on the wound as he looked upon Ven. \"Do it!\" shouted Blaster. Ven knew in the back of his mind, no witnesses. But he also thought about what his mother had said about the right to life. Ven contemplates for a moment, on the trigger. Then the decision came to him, and he holsters the pistol. Ven turns his back and slides down the rain gutter into freedom. Meanwhile, Blaster lays his head on the ground, sighs heavily and tries to not bleed out. Ven quickly approaches the buggy, and hops in. He turns it on and floors it, getting as far away as possible from the area.[Chapter 18] Chapter 18: Enemies Are Closer Than They Seem A few hours later, at the G-force Headquarters In the infirmary, Blaster and Juarez recover from the incident. Blaster had a small patch on his shoulder, and was keeping pressure on the wound. The bleeding had stopped for the most part, and had mainly consisted of clotted blood. Juarez was in a cast for her broken arm, and could barely speak from the fractured jaw. Her nose was also broken so blood occasionally trickled down her face. Both of the guinea pigs were in small cots, recovering. Ben walks in, \"How you guys doing?\" \"Do we need to answer..\", said Juarez, with a muffled voice. \"I told Marcie everything. Her, Hurley, and the rest should be back from clearance in a couple of days.\" Juarez looks off to the side, \"For once, I wish Hurley was here.. Would cheer things up.\" \"What? Am I not entertaining enough?\" interrupted Blaster. \"Nothin's entertaining about you, Blaster.\" \"That's cold Juarez.. I'm over here taking bullets for you, and you say that?\" \"My hero..\" Juarez rolled her eyes. \"Speaking of bullets..\", said Ben. \"I found the shell from the bullet that hit you Blaster. It's custom made steel, I've ever seen that before. I'm actually more boggled on how a cartridge that small can still launch a lethal bullet.\" He looks at Blaster, \"Did you see exactly if it was a gun?\" \"It was, semi automatic.. kinda wish I had one.\" \"Yeah well, your mission is not to shoot guns.\" \"Why not? He had one.\" Juarez interrupted, \"How did Darwin even get a gun?\" \"That wasn't Darwin..\" said Blaster. \"What? Yes it was.\" \"No, it wasn't. When I got a better look at him on the rooftop, his expression.. It was.. different.\" \"That's impossible! Then who was that in his room?\" \"An imposter,\" remarked Blaster. \"...I guess that explains his different fighting style.\" Blaster got curious, \"Oh yeah, about that.. What happened?\" \"I wasn't expecting it.\" \"I thought you were miss karate..\" \"And I thought that was Darwin, but looked who both got fooled, idioto..\" Blaster pauses, \"So.. where is the real Darwin?\" Ben joins in, \"I don't know, I've shoulda implanted those tracking chips in when I got the chance. I guess I'd never expect this to happen.\" \"My question's still the same, who was the imposter?\" asked Juarez. \"None of this makes sense.\" \"I don't know,\" said Ben. \"But whoever it was, clearly was more skilled than you thought...\" Meanwhile, In the buggy A small, high pitch beep rang around the buggy. Ven, distracted by the beep, looks down from the road. The gas tank was almost empty, and sunlight was dying. Ven began to look around for viable places to camp out for the night. He comes up to shipping warehouse, with minimal company. Ven pulls over and finds a small tunnel leading inside the warehouse. Inside was dark, desolate, and was full of boxes and shelves. Ven parks the buggy out of sight and turns it off. He jumps out and begins to service the buggy with the bucket of fuel, loaded from the beginning of the trip. After filling the tank, he grabs the remaining fuel, as well as some wood lying around, and builds a small fire. The sunlight was now completely gone, and Ven was ready to tucker in for the night. Suddenly, a small grumble came from the guinea pigs stomach. Ven hasn't eaten since he left, so he makes his way to the buggy. He grabs an IRP and opens it up. Inside were various fruits and vegetables, as well as crackers, stored in metal cans for freshness. Ven attempts to read the front of the packaging to determine the flavor, but couldn't understand the language. He then unfolds a piece of paper that was inside the package, listed was the instructions; also in russian. Ven gives a blank expression, slightly cringes, then crumbles the paper. He tosses it behind him and begins to walk back to the fire. He pauses suddenly to look at the body bag. He's unsure if Darwin will stay unconsious throughout the night, so he drags the body bag next to the fire as well. This way, Ven could keep a close eye on him. He opens up the bag, and takes Darwin out. He then ties up Darwin's arms to his back, then lays him up against the wall of the warehouse, close to the fire. The battered guinea pig had blood had dried onto his fur, discoloring it. He also had a long, straight bruise, from where the rod had hit him, as well as a black eye on the left side. A few hours pass Darwin slowly opens his right eye, dazed, and blurry visioned. He attempts to look around the area, glancing around the warehouse. Eventually, his eyes rest onto the fire in front of him. Next to it, was Ven, staring right at him. Darwin snaps awake, opening his other eye. He attempts to move, but realizes he's tied up. After a few moments of struggling, he relaxes, then looks upon Ven. \"You're gonna regret doing this,\" said Darwin. Ven doesn't respond, instead he turnes to the fire and relaxes. \"W-Who are you?\" asked Darwin. No response. A few moments pass, \"Do you speak?\" \"I have nothing to say to you,\" said Ven. Darwin leaned back against the wall, \"Can you at least tell me what you want with me?\" No response. Darwin looks around the warehouse once more, studying the area, \"Is this where you live?\" Ven getting rapidly annoyed with the questions, get's up, and walks away from the fire. He heads to the buggy, and cleans up the mess from the food earlier. Darwin struggles with the string, tied behind his back. Luckily, Ben taught him how to escape from situations like this. He does a small trick with his hand, and finds a loose spot. Darwin manages to get the string loose without Ven noticing. He waits for Ven to look in the other direction, then goes out of sight from Ven. Meanwhile, Ven finishes cleaning the buggy and turns around to Darwin. The guinea pig was gone, and the string was on the ground. Ven stopped short, and had a confused expression. Suddenly, Ven feels a tug in his holster. Darwin snatches the makarov and attempts to aim at Ven. Ven almost immediatly reacts and grabs Darwin's hand, twisting it until his wrist breaks, causing him to drop the gun. Ven then kicks Darwin, knocking the wind out of him. Darwin flies back a few inches, and drops to the ground. He attempts to quickly get back up and dive for the pistol, but Ven was much quicker, grabbing the makarov before Darwin could even get on his feet. He switches the safety off, and aims at Darwin. Darwin, still determined, attempts to attack Ven, a last ditch effort for his life. Ven aims directly at Darwin's head, then last second, switches to his right leg, and fires. The bullet goes through Darwin's leg and ricochet's in the distance. Darwin screeches in pain and drops to the ground, blood starts gathering on his fur, then on the floor. Ven walks up to Darwin and kicks his face, he falls onto his back, laying upright. For once in his life, Darwin felt real fear, knowing that he may die in the next few minutes. \"Please!\" shouted Darwin in desperation. \"Who are you!? Why do you look like me!?\" \"I could ask you the same thing, but I have my own question for you,\" responded Ven. \"Do you know this pain you're feeling right now. This.. suffering?\" Darwin doesn't answer. \"No answer? This is the pain me and my family went through during clusterstorm.\" \"W-wait, what?\" \"Do you recognize that word?\" \"How the hell do you know about clusterstorm?\" asked Darwin. \"That doesn't matter, what does matter is that you will die for building those machines.\" \"Machines?\" Ven aims the pistol right at Darwin's face, and slowly puts pressure on the trigger. Darwin raises his hands in front of the gun, \"Hold on! Hold on! You're misunderstood! I'm not part of clusterstorm! Me and my team-\" Ven shoots the ground next to Darwin, \"I saw you and a mole on top of a giant machine on the TV. You and your team is what caused all of this!\" \"What? No, Let me explain!\" shouted Darwin. Ven re-aims the guns at Darwin's face but doesn't shoot. He waits for a response. Darwin continues, \"I work for the government, me and my team were tasked of stopping clusterstorm, but were too late. Although, after a few minutes, we did manage to shut it down using a virus. The mole you saw was Speckles, he was the one behind clusterstorm.\" Ven grudged, \"Do you have any idea how much I went through in those 'few minutes'?\" \"I'm sorry, we couldn't stop it in time. Speckles is the one you're after.\" \"Where is he?\" \"In custody of the FBI, he's fixing what he started.\" \"And the two guinea pigs I saw back at the warehouse, they part of your team?\" \"Yes, plus one more, Hurley.\" Ven paused for a moment, \"Wait, who?\" \"Hurley.\" Ven looked off to the side for a moment, \"Hurley? I've heard that name before.\" The thought was disrupted with a warm feeling coming from Ven's feet. He looks down and sees a small pool of blood gathering around the area. Darwin was loosing blood fast, and knew he was going to die within minutes if it wasn't controlled. Ven pulls the gun away, \"Look, if you want to survive, tell me who Hurley is.\" \"He's a guinea pig I met a few days ago.\" \"Where?\" \"In a pet shop.\" Ven pauses for a moment, thinking hard. \"A pet shop..\" He suddenly has a flashback, and remembers the conversation he had with Elliot. A voice rang in Ven's head, it's Elliot, \"I never told you this but, besides Lillie, you had two more siblings.\" \"Siblings?\" \"Brothers... \"What happened to them?\" asked Ven. \"On the night you were born, there was a fire in the pet shop. No one was there to put it out, so it destroyed everything, including the tank we were in... \"Did they have names?\" said Ven. \"Only one,\" said Elliot. \"Hurley.\" \"Hurley?\" \"You're father named him...\" \"Why not the other?\" said Ven. \"He was the runt, and Marlen said that we shouldn't name him so that we wouldn't get too attached.\" \"So you abandoned him?\" \"I didn't want to abandon him, but...\" She pauses, then sighs subtlety. \"You know, you and the runt were twins..\" Ven trembles, \"Hurley.. He's my...\" He looks directly into Darwin's eyes, \"And you?..\" \"What?\", said Darwin. Ven glares at the pistol, and takes a step back, seeing the devastation he caused. His breathing gets heavy from a realization. Darwin questions, \"Your brother? Are we even talking about the same pig.\" Ven attempts to compose himself, and re-focuses on reality, \"Uh.. Yes, we're talking about the same one.\" Ven quickly holsters the gun and questions Darwin, \"Did you know your mother?\" \"What? My mother?\" \"Please, answer the question.\" \"Uh- no, actually, I was givin up at birth.\" \"Figured as much.\" Ven turns towards the buggy and approaches it. \"I'm confused, what are you gettin at?\" said Darwin. Ven prepares the buggy for departure, then looks over at Darwin, \"You're.. My brother, too.\"[Chapter 19] Chapter 19: Early Scheduling Darwin sits in silence as he watches Ven dig around in the buggy. Darwin looks down at the wound, oozing blood. He begins to feel weak, and cold. But the pain was distracted by his curiousity of Ven. He looks back up in doubt, \"Brother, huh? Another one?..\" Darwin studied Ven, \"He looks like me, but..\" His eyes scan down Ven's back, and spots a small discolored spot of fur near the bottom, a birthmark. \"Oh great..\" whispered Darwin. Ven finally got to some bandages, and turns to Darwin, rushing to apply them. Darwin looks at Ven, \"So you know my mother?\" \"Of course.\" \"Does she also have that birthmark?\" Ven glances into Darwin's eyes, \"Birthmark?\" \"On your back.\" \"Ven turns around and spots the mark Darwin was talking about, \"Yeah.. she does.\" \"Is she nice?\" Ven smiles, \"You'll meet her..\" \"Wait, what?\" Ven finishes wrapping the bullet wound, and stands up, \"We're going home.\" He reaches out to Darwin and lifts him up, carrying him to the buggy. \"I'm confused,\" said Darwin. \"Where is.. home? And how do you know Hurley?\" \"I'll answer all that on the way. Right now, conserve your energy.\" Ven loads Darwin into the buggy, buckling him in. He looks down at the wound. It appears red, as the blood starts to seep through. Ven knows he doesn't have much time, and rushes to the drivers seat. He turns on the vehicle and floors it towards the village. Alexei's house The two girls approach Alexei's home, lights were on inside. The two girls, Jill and Beth, were the younger females of the village. Jill was a agouti tricolor with a blaze of white running through her face. She was known for not being pushed around, and was a real smooth talker. Beth was the shorter of the two, and slightly younger at just about a year and a half. She's a chubbier, black and white tricolor with a blaze of white also running down her face. She has a much more sensitive personality, and a mellow heart. Both girls really didn't like being in too much danger, but due to the circumstances, they were forced to do this. Jill looks back at Beth, and hesitates to knock on the door. She gives a shallow breath, and knocks. Footsteps inside as it got closer, and the two girls get next to one another. The door opens wide and there stands Alexei, quiet and curious. \"Hey there!\" said Jill with a suprising amount of confidence. \"I heard you're the guy that's gonna get the bad people who destroyed the village.\" Alexei looks Jill in the eye, and glances in the back were Beth was standing, looking slightly nervous. Alexei responds, \"I'm the one, yes.. Who are you?\" \"My name's Jill, and this is Beth.\" She looks back at the young girl, who's having a hard time getting into character. \"We like men who can take charge like you,\" said Jill. \"Oh do you?\" asked Alexei in a amorous tone. He looks at Beth once again, \"Why does she look so nervous?\" Jill opens her eyes and quickly thinks of an answer, \"I-I'm sorry, it's her first time.\" Beth smiles, but doesn't give too much eye contact. \"First time huh?\" said Alexei, \"Well I can fix that..\" Jill flares up and gets closer to Alexei, softly poking his chest, \"We came over to show you our appreciation.\" Alexei gently rubs Jill's fur and gets a bit of goosebumps, it's softeness causes his hair to stand. \"Come in,\" remarked Alexei. Jill and Beth slowly walk inside and begin to grope on Alexei, they shut the door, and the lights dim. A few hours later The morning light begins to shed the sky as dawn approaches. It's very calm and cool, no wind and barely a cloud to be seen. A small sound is heard, a vehicle. It approaches Alexei's home at blazing speeds. It's Ven, returning from the two day trip, and with him is Darwin. They arrive about six hours ahead of schedule. Ven stops the vehicle in front of Alexei's home, he turns to Darwin. Darwin was no longer clearly answering questions and now appeared to be asleep. The bandages were soaked in blood and were dripping off into the vehicle. Ven knew Darwin was about to go into shock if medical care wasn't administered soon. He turns to Alexei's house; loud music rang in the house, drowning out the sound of the buggy. \"He's still awake?\" whispered Ven to himself. He turns off the vehicle and gets out, quickly getting on the other side to unbuckle Darwin. He awakes, only to mumble out gibberish, non comprehendable words. \"Stay with me,\" said Ven as he pulls Darwin out of the buggy. The weakened body falls onto the floor, and Darwin groans in pain. Ven comes up and lifts Darwin up to shoulder level, limping across the grass towards the tree. Ven then peacefully sets him down against the bark, Darwin opens his eyes and looks around. He spots the village in the distance, \"I-Is this your home?\" said Darwin in a very shaky tone. \"I'll be back,\" remarked Ven. \"You're going to be alright.\" Darwin turns slowly to Alexei's house, \"T-That's a n-nice home..\" Ven stands up and looks at his hands, covered in blood. He couldn't bare to see Darwin, his brother, in this shape. Even after just a few hours riding back with him, Ven knew way more about his family and began to grow a connection. He lost his sister and is not prepared to lose another. Ven balls up his fist and turns to Alexei's house, darting across the field to the front porch. The loud music overpowered the wood creeking of the porch. \"What is he doing?\" wondered Ven. He suddenly hears giggling, and wierd noises coming from the house. Unprovoked, Ven barges inside and spots Alexei. He was on the couch, laying on top of another guinea pig. \"WOAH! VEN!\" shouted Alexei, startled by the door slam. The guinea pig scurries off the couch, \"What the fuck!? What are you-, what time is it!?\" \"You know,\" said Ven. \"I sometimes sleep on that couch.\" Jill and Beth stare at Ven, and the blood on his hands. They cower back towards the kitchen. Alexei grabs the watch on the table, it says '0606'. \"Six in the morning?!\" shouted the russian pig. \"Six hours early!\" \"Did I interrupt something important?\" asked Ven. \"YES!\" Alexei looks to Jill and Beth, \"Ladies, do you mind giving us a moment?\" The girls don't say a single word, and dart out through the back door. Alexei glares at Ven for a few seconds, seeing the blood on Ven's hands. He sighs, \"What the fuck happened?\" The voice was low and gruff, hiding the inner rage that was inside. \"I found him,\" said Ven. \"The enemy?\" \"Yes.\" \"And?\" \"I- uh.. need your help.\" Alexei squints, giving a peculiar curious look, \"Where is he..?\" He walks outside onto the porch, searching for the guinea pig. He soon finds him laying on the tree, \"Hmm, so whats his name?\" asked Alexei. \"Darwin.\" Alexei studies him closer, spotting the bloodied bandages. \"His leg... You shot him didnt you? \"Listen,\" spurted Ven. \"We need to take him to the doc.\" \"Why?.. You wanted this, I'm surprised you didn't finish him off.\" \"I can't.. He's my brother..\" \"Brother?\" \"It's a long story..\" Ven leans on the porch railing looking at Darwin, \"But right now, you're gonna have to trust me.\" Alexei pauses for a moment, then slowly turns around heading back indoors, in denial, Ven follows. \"I trust you,\" explained Alexei. \"But he is a different story.\" He points to the direction Darwin was laying. \"Just because he looks like you doesn't mean anything.\" \"Like I said, it's a long story. You're just gonna have to believe me.\" \"Believe..?\" Alexei walks right up next to Ven, looking him eye to eye. \"I believe you're failing me right now. Go.. and finish your mission.\" He turns his back to Ven, expecting authority. Ven resists, \"No, I wont.\" Alexei turns back at Ven with disappointment, then looks down at pistol, \"Fine, I'll kill him myself.\" \"No, he's not our enemy.\" Alexei doesnt speak, waiting for an explanation. Ven continues, \"Remember that mole we saw on the TV? He said that mole was in charge of clusterstorm. Darwin works for the government, he was there to stop it. \"You're going off of what he said, it's a lie.\" \"Trust me, I would've finished him long ago if I didnt believe him.\" \"Ven, you shouldn't even be talking to the enemy, otherwise they can start distracting you, decepting you into letting them live. \"Don't start this bullshit Alexei, Darwin wouldn't do that.\" Alexei points to Ven, \"You've grown attached to this pig.. Just because he's your 'brother'. You shift the blame elsewhere. But it's all lies, the brother, the clusterstorm...\" Alexei sighs, \"Let me guess, he told you all of this after you shot him? Ven hesitates, \"..Yes, but-\" \"Exactly, he's trying to survive by tricking you to believing what he was saying.\" \"Alexei, I'm not that guillable.\" \"Apparently you are, give me the gun.\" \"I'm not letting you shoot him.\" Alexei spoke in a demeaning soft voice, \"Give me that pistol..\" \"Sorry Alexei, I won't.\" Alexei approaches Ven, walking up to him in a calm demeanor. Ven notices the stance and prepares himself. Alexei quickly tries snatching at the holster, but gets blocked by Ven's arm. Alexei anticipates the movement and counters it with a swift punch to the gut. The blow knocks the wind out of Ven, putting him on his knees. Alexei then swiftly snatches the pistol out of the holster. He laughs, \"You try and fight your teacher, old friend. Still have a lot to learn.\" Alexei walks to the front door, watching Ven cough on the ground. He opens the door, spotting Darwin in the distance, then turns back around to Ven, \"You're weak to believe the enemies saying, as they will say anything to live.\" Alexei shuts the door, leaving Ven alone indoors.[Chapter 20] Chapter 20: Two birds, One stone The Village Jill and Beth both sprinted back to the village in fear of their lives. The lead guinea pig spots them and waves them down. \"Over here!\" shouted Hugo. The two girls follow him to Ellis's home, rushing indoors. Ellis, Tibbetts, as well as a few guinea pigs who couldn't sleep throughout the night gathered in the home. The rest of the village overhears and awakes, curious of what happened. \"Are you two alright?\" asked Hugo. \"What happened?\" \"Is Alexei gonna help us?\" asked Ellis. Jill hesitated for a second, \"Ven returned..\" \"He's back?\" asked Tibbetts. \"Did you see someone else with him?\" \"No, but he had blood on his hands.\" \"Blood..?\" Hugo jumps in, \"Alright, we need to know exactly what happened.\" \"...Okay.\" Jill sits down, and Beth continues to be silent, staring at the ground. \"E-Everything was fine,\" said Jill. \"Alexei was in a good mood, having fun, then suddenly.. Ven opens the front door, and Alexei freaks out. He had blood on his hands, and looked menacing. Then Alexei told us to leave..\" \"But did you manage to get anything out of him?\" spurted Ellis. \"Uh.. No..\" Everyone sighs in disappointment, looking at each other. \"Now what?\" asked one guinea pig. \"Well, I have one last idea,\" said Hugo. \"But everyone is has to be aboard for it to work.\" \"What?\" said Ellis. \"If we all gather up, we can overwhelm Ven and Alexei. Take the gun, and force him to help us build, or else.\" Ellis steps up, \"That sound like a terrible idea, you're risking the lifes of everyone doing that. We barely have enough people as is.\" \"Well, then I have failed you as a leader.\" Tibbetts walks up, \"Have you guys even tried to simply ask?\" Hugo looks up, \"Tibbetts.. It's not that simple.\" \"Maybe it is, It won't hurt.\" \"No Tibbetts, sit down.\" Tibbets surveys the room, seeing the hopelessness in everyones eyes. \"W-What? You given up.. Fine, well I'll go ask then.\" Tibbetts begins to march towards the front door. Hugo halts him, \"Tibbetts don't, I can't take another loss.\" \"Let him,\" inturrupted Ellis. \"We're better off without him anyway. One less mouth to feed.\" \"Ellis stop that! If we lose Tibbetts, we lose any chance of getting Alexei to help us. Lets keep a good reputation.\" Tibbetts thinks for a second, \"No.. If we wait any longer, we won't survive another week! I'm asking now..\" Hugo stomps the ground, \"You're not going!\" \"Stop me then!\" Tibbetts rushes out the front door before anyone grabs him, and runs away from the home. \"We have to stop him!\" shouted Hugo. \"It's too late,\" spoke Ellis in a bitter voice. Hugo balls his fist, and looks around. Everyone had eyes on him, waiting for their leader to make a wise decision. He closes his eyes, \"I'm not letting the future of the village be decided by a rebellious kid, I'm going after him.\" The lead pig advances out the door, everyone moving aside. Once outside, he peers into the distance, at Alexei's home. Ellis sighs, then follows, as well as the rest of the village. Alexei's home Ven gathers his breath and gets up, dazed from the punch. He slowly walks forward towards the window, staggering on each step. Approaching the window, Ven peeks outside, seeing Alexei walk towards Darwin with the pistol in his hand. he begins to breath heavily, looking around with desperation, searching for a solution. Alexei approaches Darwin, standing a few steps away. Darwin looks in hope that this guy is going to help him. Alexei checks the chamber of the pistol, \"..Darwin, right?\" Darwin doesn't answer, instead just lifts his head to rest on the tree behind him. \"You look in pretty bad shape.\" Alexei walks up to Darwin, kneeling down next to him. Darwin looks Alexei in the eye, wheezing. \"Hmm, you really do look like Ven,\" said Alexei. He pauses, then swiftly punches Darwin in the face, \"But brother? Meh..\" The punch knocks him off the tree, and Darwin squeals. Alexei gets up and circles back in front, \"You may be able to trick Ven, but not me.\" Darwin spits, \"W-What are you talking about?\" \"Ahh, you see, I'm the one asking questions.\" Alexei points the gun, \"You're in charge of clusterstorm?\" \"W-why does everyone here think that, no!\" Alexei begins to pull on the trigger, but suddenly gets halted. A door opens, and Alexei turns around, it's Ven. \"Stop this, Alexei!\" \"Eh, fuck off.\" Ven rushes down the steps, then towards Alexei. Alexei aims the gun at Ven, stopping him in his tracks. Alexei re-aims the pistol at Darwin, \"So, if you didn't cause it, who did?\" Darwin struggles, \"S-Speckles.\" \"That's the mole I keep hearin about?\" \"...Ye-s.\" The guinea pig is dazed and bleeding out, loosing the ability speak clearly. Ven attempts to move towards Darwin to assist. Immediatly Alexei fires a round towards Ven's feet, missing by mere inches. Alexei continues, \"Tell me..\" \"H-he..\" Darwin starts to fade into a shock state, eyes glossy. Ven starts to break as sees yet another sibling die in front of his eyes, caused by his own bullet. \"It is funny,\" said Alexei. He turns to Ven, \"You shot him, yet now you're trying to save him.\" Alexei studies Ven, seeing the dread in his eyes. \"Weakness.. Well, you brought this among yourself.\" Ven shifts his eyes back on Darwin, soon to be another death added to the family. A feeling of lonliness and despair took over his emotions. Darwin slowly opens his eyes, bloodshot in death, and glares at Ven. The desperation overwhelms him and he clicks.. No thought in it, Ven storms Alexei, prepared to fight till the last breath. Alexei reacts and points the gun towards Ven, shooting him. The round pierces through Ven's leg, but this doesn't stop him. Ven tackles Alexei to the ground, rolling around trying to gain control of the weapon. The noise they gathered gains everyone's attention in the village. Ellis and his group hears the gunfire, and drop down on the ground. \"You think he just shot Tibbetts?\" asked a guinea pig. \"This is suicide!\" said another. Ellis pauses, looking towards Alexei's home. Meanwhile, from the sideline and out of sight, was Tibbetts, watching from a safe distance. Hugo approaches from behind, \"Tibbetts! What's happening?\" \"Shhh! Get down.\" Hugo drops, then crawls up. He spots Ven and Alexei on the ground fighting, rolling on top of one another. Blood from Ven's wound begins to rub all over Alexei's fur as he struggles to maintain control of the weapon. Alexei then elbows Ven's gut, and rolls on top of his belly in a way where Ven starts to suffocate. The weapon is in Alexei's right hand, but Ven has his finger on the trigger. The gun fires into the air, and the recoil brings the weapon on top of both of them. Ven attempts to take control of the makarov and forces the barrel to aim at Alexei and himself. He contemplates if he shoots the gun, the round will go through Alexei and into himself. Alexei knows his strength isn't as strong as it used to be and can't aim the pistol elsewhere. \"Ven,\" struggled Alexei. \"Don't let it end like this.\" No though in it, two rounds are fired through Alexei and into Ven. Alexei shrieks in pain and rolls off Ven. Ven immediatly gains control of the pistol, kicks himself off of Alexei and fires four more rounds into Alexei's back and head, emptying the magazine. A gurgle came out of Alexei, as well as blood dripping from his skull, then silence. Ven stares at the gun, and the body in front of him. He pauses for a second, and looks up in the sky, closing his eyes. He wonder if in the future, he will ever regret the choices he just made. Re-shaping his life, and killing the past. He looks back down and re opens his eyes, watery. Ven drops the pistol, and attempts to move, but gets stopped by a pain in his gut. He places his hand onto his stomach, blood oozing out. Ven sighs and lies on his back, passing out.[Chapter 21] Chapter 21: Stones Don't Break Easily The sun is almost fully up, and the wind began to pick up, rustling the trees around. Tibbett's and the lead guinea pig peek out and see the remains. Tibbetts looks left at the lead pig. \"Did they just..?\" said Tibbetts, pointing at Alexei and Ven. \"Yeah.. looks like it.\" answered Hugo. Tibbetts stands up over the ledge, and approaches the bodies. He looks upon Alexei and Ven, then sighs, putting his hands on his hips. \"Tibbetts!\" shouted a voice from behind. Tibbetts turns around, it's Ellis. \"You're alive.\" said Ellis. \"Uhh.. Yeah, I am.\" Ellis, as well as the rest of the village approach the dead guinea pigs. Some told their young to leave. \"What happened here?\" asked Ellis. \"I don't know,\" answered Tibbetts. \"They.. Were involved in a quarrel or something.\" \"Well, two crazies with a gun never amounts to anything good.\" He pauses, \"But this.. is good. We don't have to worry about them anymore.\" Tibbetts turns sharply at Ellis, \"What? What did you just say?\" \"I said we don't have to worry about them anymore, they were problematic to begin with.\" \"You don't care?\" Tibbetts balls his fist. Suddenly a voice in the distance, \"Hey doc!\" Ellis looks to see who's calling him, it's a guinea pig near the tree. \"Come over here!\" Ellis rushes to the tree, with Tibbetts following. On the ground next to the tree, layed Darwin, still alive. \"What the..\" said Ellis in shock of what he sees before him. \"We found him, lying here,\" said the pig. Tibbetts catches up, as well as the rest of the village. Ellis kneels down next to the bleeding pig and checks his wound. He puts his hand in front of Darwin's nose. \"He's still breathing,\" said Ellis. \"Hey, are you with me? What's your name?\" No response. Ellis moves closer, and opens Darwin's eye lids. They were about rolled back, and glossy. Suddenly Darwin starts shaking, cold from the lost blood. \"He's fainted,\" said Ellis. \"And about to go into shock.\" Tibbetts steps up, \"That's the guy.\" Everyone turns. \"The guy?\" spoke Ellis. \"From the TV.\" Ellis turns back to Darwin, \"Him!?\" \"Yeah.. Ven said he would return with the one who caused the destruction of the village.\" Ellis takes a second to comprehend, \"Holy shit.. So he's the one behind all this.\" \"Then why are we tending him,\" shouted a guinea pig in the crowd. \"He deserves to die!\" \"No!\" spurted Tibbetts. \"I think Ven was trying to protect this guy.\" \"How do you know?\" said Ellis. \"I was watching from the side. Alexei and Ven were arguing about killing him I think, then they attacked each other. \"That doesn't make any sense.\" \"I'm still trying to wrap my head around it myself.\" \"But why protect him?\" spurted a guinea pig in the crowd. \"After all that happened? That can't be true!\" \"Well,\" said Ellis. \"If anyone knows the answer, its him. Take him to the house, hurry!\" A few pigs gather and lift Darwin up, heading towards Ellis's house. \"Doc!?\" shouted the same pig in the crowd. \"I don't wanna hear it. My job is to save people, not let them die!\" Tibbetts rolls his eyes, \"Now you act heroic...\" \"Shut it Tibbetts!\" He points at Darwin. \"He's the only one that can tell us what happened, not you.\" Ellis begins to walk away. \"What about Ven?\" asked Tibbetts. Ellis stops, \"What about Ven?\" \"You're not gonna ask him?\" Ellis turns around, eyes squinted, \"They're dead..\" \"How do you know?\" \"How do I know!? Holy shit Tibbetts.. Here lemme ask them.\" Ellis projects his voice towards the two guinea pigs in the grass. \"HEY VEN! WERE YOU PROTECTING THIS GUY!?\" Ellis places his hand near his ear to listen for a responce, \"Yeah, I didn't think so.\" Ellis turns his back to Tibbetts and steps away once more. \"I mean go and check.\" \"There's literally no point.\" \"So you're just gonna leave them?\" \"No, we'll come back to give a proper burial.\" Tibbetts crosses his arms, \"Pfft, wow. A piece of shit doctor you are.\" \"You're wasting my time, Tibbetts.\" Ellis begins to walk out of sight, \"Hey, didn't you want to be a doctor? Look, there's your opportunity...\" Ellis's voice fades in the distance as Tibbetts watches in disappointment. He then turns to Alexei and Ven, and approaches them once more. The two guinea pigs lay, lifeless on the grass. Alexei had a pool of blood around him, it was clear his demise was ture. Ven was a foot away, and didn't look as bad; blood dripping from his chest and back. Tibbetts moved closer to Ven, kneeling beside him. He looks upon the body, then places his hand in front of Ven's face to check for breathing. No signs of life came from the corpse. Tibbetts moves his hand away and spots the pistol, the culprit of this disaster. He attempts to reach over Ven to grab the weapon but slips atop of Ven, getting blood on his fur. He immediatly pushes himself off and rubs the blood off, disgusted from the sight. A twitch came from the body and more blood poured out. Then, suddenly a wheezing sound is heard. Tibbetts listens in and investigates, \"Ven?\" No answer came from the body, but a continued wheezing was heard. Tibbetts replaces his hand in front of Ven's nose and mouth and feels a slight breeze. \"He.. He's alive, he has to be!\" Tibbetts peaks over towards the village, looking directly at Ellis's home. He ponders if he should even tell the village. \"If I take him to Ellis..\" thought Tibbetts to himself. \"He'll probably die. Ellis's lack of care is a concern.\" He looks back at Ven, \"Don't worry, you're gonna be okay.\" Meanwhile, at Ellis's home The guinea pigs lay Darwin on the table, and begin to recover the broken pig. Ellis removes the bloodied bandage on his leg and studies the wound. \"Looks like shrapnel,\" said Ellis. He studies it closer, \"From a projectile.\" \"Probably a bullet,\" said another pig. \"Look, it went all the way through.\" Ellis turns the leg around, \"I see.. Grab me some suture.\" The other guinea pig hands Ellis what looks like nylon threads. \"We need to stop the bleeding before anything else.\" Ellis grabs the nylon thread and wraps it around Darwin's leg, tightly. After a few seconds, the bloodflow had stopped, and Ellis begins to stitch the wound with the rest of the nylon. He points around, giving various orders. \"You,\" shouted Ellis, pointing at a pig in the back. \"Get me the syringe from the breeders home.\" He points at another pig. \"And you, please grab some pain reliever pills and grind them up.\" An hour passes, and Ellis successfully stitches the wound. He continues to clean up the blood from the local area, then cleans his own hands. The other look upon Darwin, resting on the table. \"He lost a lot of blood,\" said Ellis. \"But he'll make it.\" \"Him and Ven,\" said a guinea pig. \"The similarities are striking.. This is the guy from the news station?\" \"It is,\" answered Ellis. \"They're practically the same pig, could make a good replacer.\" \"I don't know about that. Remember, this is the guy behind the village attack.\" \"Then why are we helping him?\" \"I'm still asking myself that question.\" They look back at Darwin. \"According to Tibbetts, Ven was trying to protect this guy.\" \"And you believed him?\" \"I don't want to..\" \"Then how do you know it's true?\" \"I don't. But if anyone knows the answer, it's him.\" Ellis points at Darwin. \"Still, it seems off that Ven would protect the one that destroyed the village.\" \"Yeah...\" A gruff voice appears, \"He's a friend.\" \"Hugo?\" wondered Ellis. Hugo shows himself in the room. \"Ven had good intentions. He wouldn't do this unless there was reason.\" \"We'll see.\" \"I trusted Ven's judgement, don't worry.\" The other guinea pig intervenes, \"About Ven, who's gonna tell his mother the news? And are we gonna keep this pig here until he recovers?\" Ellis sighs, \"I have to head out and recover Ven and Alexei, as well as prepare a grave for them. So, I'll let you figure that out, I'm not gonna be the bearer of bad news.. again.\" \"Do you need help?\" asked the guinea pig. \"I can use a couple bodies.\" At Alexei's house Ellis arrives at the home with two guinea pigs for help. They look around for Alexei, and spot him near the tree. They approach Alexei, but pause suddenly. \"Wait,\" said Ellis. \"Where's Ven!?\" The guinea pig had disappeared, leaving only a trace of blood on the ground. The other two guinea pigs begin to look around for the missing pig. \"Also, where's the weapon!?\" one of the pigs asked. \"Maybe he's alive?\" said the other guinea pig. \"He is a tough motherfucker.\" \"Or someone took him..\" Ellis stares blankly into the spot were Ven was resting, \"Who the hell would take a dead body? Wait..\" \"Hey, wasn't Tibbetts here earlier?\" asked one of the pigs. Ellis looks to the group, \"Exactly my thought, let's go..\" They begin to rush over towards Tibbetts' home, leaving Alexei for later. At Tibbetts' house Ven was on a table near the back of the living room, still bleeding. Tibbetts studied Ven, looking at the bullet holes. \"It doesn't look like anything vital,\" said Tibbetts to himself. \"I mean-\" Suddenly a knock. Tibbetts peeks towards the door. He knows exactly who it is, then sighs. Tibbetts approaches the door, and opens it. Standing in front, was Ellis. Behind him stands the other two guinea pigs, \"Okay, where is he?\" said Ellis. \"Who?\" answered Tibbetts. \"Cut the shit, I know you have Ven.\" \"What makes you think that?\" \"I don't know Tibbetts.. When I try to bury a couple of dead bodies and see one of them missing I think.. Damn. What mental psychopath takes dead people? Oh I know one! You Tibbetts...\" \"I didn't take Ven.\" \"You're a terrible liar.\" Ellis attempts to enter the home. \"I know you have Ven.\" The door suddenly gets stopped by Tibbetts' foot, blocking Ellis's entrance. Although, he manages to spot Ven on a table on the other side of the living room. \"Aha!\" shouted Ellis. \"Leave.\" said Tibbetts in a forboding tone. He pushes Ellis back outside. \"What the actual fuck are you doing with a dead body Tibbetts?\" Tibbetts gave a stern, but sarcastic look to Ellis, \"He's alive, just like you said.\" \"Alive? Bullshit.\" \"Just like the guy standing at my doorstep.\" \"Can I go one day, without hearing your shit?\" \"Short answer, no.\" \"Wow.\" Ellis smirks. \"You are one jealous bitch.\" \"I'm not jealous of someone that isn't real.\" The smirk wipes off Ellis's face, and he peers into Tibbetts' eyes. \"Okay, why are you doing this? Is it to cheer up your worthless life?\" \"Yes, exactly.\" Ellis sighs, giving up on trying to antagonize Tibbetts. \"Why didn't you bring Ven to me?\" \"It's none of your concern.\" \"It is my concern.\" Ellis looks over to Ven once more, attemping to enter the home. \"Move.\" \"No!\" Tibbetts shoves his foot in front of the door. \"Anything you do now will kill him.\" Ellis raises an eyebrow, \"What are you talking about, I'm trying to help.\" \"And I deny that help, Ven is under my care.\" \"You're not a doctor, Tibbetts.\" \"And you are?\" \"I literally just went through a surgery..\" \"Well,\" remarked Tibbetts. \"I wouldn't worry about Ven, not like you ever did.\" Ellis tightens his fist, \" I'm taking Ven.. \" The other pigs step up. \"No you're not.\" Tibbetts reveals the pistol he's been hiding behind his back. Ellis and the others immediatly recess back. \"I'm tired of dealing with people like you, pushing me aside because they feel obligated to do so..\" He continues, \"Ven is in a condition where simple stitching won't do it. I've read numorous books on the subject of medicine, and saved Ven's mother from death. Hell, I'm the one who told you how to take care of her, and you dare insult my ability?\" Ellis shrugs in fear, \"Tibbetts-\" \"And you!? You call yourself a doctor? Do you know how many people died that night because you didn't know how to properly administer treatment!? People bled out, because of you. I wanted to help, but I couldn't, because of you. Ven was gonna to die if it was up to you.. And you wouldn't have given a damn, because he was a burden to you. Ven protects this village, but to you, he's just another 'death'. A number.. A statistic. No, it should of been you on the ground over there!\" Tibbetts raises the pistol. \"In fact, that can still happen, so leave before it does.\" Ellis slowly responds, \"So you're going to shoot me if I help Ven?\" \"If you, 'help' Ven, he will die. You don't have the knowledge much less the care to deal with him.\" Tibbetts points the pistol at Ellis, \" Sorry doc, this is my patient .\" Ellis slowly backs up, hands raised. \"Fine, I'll leave..\" Tibbetts lowers the guns and watches the three pigs walk away. Suddenly Ellis turns his head around, \"When he dies though, you can only blame yourself.\" Tibbetts doesn't respond, instead shuts the door and controls his breathing. He places the pistol onto the couch, then looks over towards Ven. \"I'm not planning on him leaving just yet,\" chatted Tibbetts to himself. Ellis's home Ellis and his helpers return, nothing in hand. They get spotted by the guinea pigs inside the home. As they walk inside, other surround them in curiosity. \"Your finished?\" asked a guinea pig. \"No,\" answered Ellis. \"We had a bit of a snag.. Well more than a bit.\" \"What happened?\" Ellis pauses, looking upon the group, \"I don't want anyone near Tibbetts.. He.. has a gun.\" \"How?\" asked Hugo. \"He took it from Ven.. He also has Ven.\" Everyone's heads turn, \"Explain, please.\" \"Apparently Ven is alive, and is under Tibbetts' care.\" \"Ven's alive!?\" interrupted Hugo.\" \"Yeah, but Tibbetts doesn't want us near him, threatening us with the weapon. I told him if Ven dies, he would be the only one to blame.\" \"What?\" Hugo looks off to the side. \"This doesn't make any sense.\" Ellis turns towards Darwin, \"Besides that, has anyone made a decision on where to keep him at?\" He points at Darwin. One of the pigs answered, \"We agreed for him to stay at Ven's.\" \"Ven's house? We're not trying to replace him.\" \"Well then let's keep him here, in your house.\" \"What? Hell no, put him at your house.\" \"How 'bout no. He's your problem, not ours.\" Ellis's expression depresses, \"Fair enough.. We have to get Elliot's permission though.\" \"I'm pretty sure she'll agree, being that you have to check her daily anyway, and they're both immobilized.\" \"Sounds good.\" Ellis points out to his helpers, \"Grab him, lets's go.\" Before leaving the house, Ellis gets stopped by Hugo, \"Ellis!\" Ellis turns around. \"If Tibbetts has Ven, where's Alexei?\" \"He's still at his house.\" \"You didn't bury him?\" \"No, if Tibbetts wants to desecrate bodies, he can do it.\" \"And if he doesn't?\" \"Well, then Alexei rots.\" Ellis doesn't give Hugo another chance to ask a question, and shuts the front door. Ellis and a few guinea pigs arrive at Elliot's front door, looking at each other, before entering.[Chapter 22] Chapter 22: Family of Guinea Pigs Ellis opens the front door and sees Elliot lying on her cot, looking worrisome. \"Doc,\" said Elliot. Her voice was rough, still recovering from the accident. She continues, \"I heard some noise outside a couple of hours ago, from Alexei's. Is Ven okay?\" \"You don't know?\" asked Ellis. \"Know what?\" Ellis turned his head, peering outside towards his helpers. His eyes squint in disappointment that he will have to once again be the bearer of bad news. \"Doc,\" said Elliot. \"What happened?\" Ellis sighs, \"There.. Was a fight.\" \"Between who?\" \"Ven.. And Alexei...\" \"No, stop.\" She lies back down and stares at the roof for a moment. \"Elliot?\" \"I recognized those sounds, it was Alexei's pistol.\" Ellis pauses, \"I'm sorry Elliot..\" \"So Ven is..?\" Ellis perks up, \"No, he's apparently alive.\" Elliot shoots back up, peering into Ellis's eyes, shocked, as well as being curious. Ellis continues, \"But he's being treated by.. Tibbetts.\" \"Tibbetts!?\" The mere saying of the name disgusted Elliot. \"That unstable mental psychopath! He's taking care of Ven!? Get him out of there!\" \"I've tried.. He's got Alexei's gun, saying that I will kill Ven if I tried to help.\" \"That YOU will kill Ven?\" \"I really have have no idea..\" Ellis turns back towards outside, peeking at Darwin. \"I also can't say if Ven is gonna make it, but that's not why were here.\" \"Then what?\" \"There's a guinea pig that we want to keep here to recover. Ven risked his life to protect him and we think he'll be safe here.\" \"Who is he?\" \"This is the guy we saw on the TV that Ven was after. He looks awful a lot like Ven. But for some reason, Ven was protecting him, so we thought he was a friend, and gave him medical attention. Now we need a place for him to recover.\" Elliot's expression angered, \"So you're bringing the very guy that caused my family's destruction, to my home for recovery...\" \"Ven was protecting this individual. For that reason, we're gonna assume he's friendly..\" Ellis takes a step closer to Elliot, \"Can we keep him here?\" Elliot thinks for a moment, \"Let me see him.\" Ellis turns around and gestures to the guys holding Darwin, instructing them to come inside. Elliot takes a look at the bruised face and damaged body, and instantly showed disbelief and confusion. \"Oh.. Uh..\" said Elliot. \"He does look like Ven.\" Her eyes track onto the broken guinea pig as he's carried across the living room. \"That's.. Overwhelming..\" \"So can he stay?\" Ellis looked desperate. Elliot appeared to be in a trance. She get's a feeling inside, a connection to the guinea pig. Elliot snaps back into reality, \"U-Uh fine, but don't let him get near me!\" \"Don't worry,\" said Ellis. \"He's temporarily immobilized due to the wound on his leg.\" Elliot watched as the two guinea pigs lay Darwin onto another cot. She wondered to herself, \"Friendly huh? Why would Ven protect the one thing that killed his family? I wonder what his name is...\" \"Alright,\" remarked Elliot. \"I'm gonna come back in a few hours to see how he's doing.\" Elliot nods, still staring at Darwin. \"I'll bring lunch for you soon, bye.\" Ellis shuts the front door, and the guinea pigs begin to walk away, footsteps fading. Elliot continued to glare at Darwin, curious to know more about the guinea pig. Being paralyzed, she can't walk towards him, only turn her neck over to see him. Tibbetts' house Meanwhile, Tibbetts prepares for surgery onto Ven. He hooks up a plastic bag, of what looks like a clear liquid. On it, he marked \"IV\". The bag had a small tube at the bottom leading towards a needle, which was placed into Ven's arm. He was lying upright on a table, near the back of Tibbetts' living room. \"The bullets didn't go all the way through..\" concluded Tibbetts. He begins to wipe up the blood near the wounds. \"One... Two.. Three..\" Tibbetts counted the rounds fired into Ven. Two in the gut, and one in the leg. Tibbetts raised the leg up, \"Looks like the round went all the way through in this one.\" He inspects the other two bullet wounds. \"These don't look nearly as bad..\" He takes a closer look, then slowly places his fingers into the wound. Suddenly Tibbetts feels something hard, and jagged. \"The bullet! It's still there!\" He takes out his fingers and wipes off the blood. \"You're lucky, Ven. Alexei took the blunt force of those rounds..\" Tibbetts grabs a small pair of tweezers and begins to pull out the rounds, starting the surgery. It takes hours, finishing around late afternoon. Thanks to Tibbetts scavenging the medical supplies from the breeders home, he was able to find a way to give nutrition to Ven while he rests, gaining more blood cells. Elliot's house It's late afternoon, sky is partly cloudy and air is peaceful. Suddenly, inside of Elliot's house, Darwin awakes. He slowly opens his eyes, seeing Elliot in the cot nearest. She's facing him, eyes shut asleep. Darwin then rolls around and looks outside, seeing the remainder of the village. On the ground layed broken appliances, and in the distance, homes destroyed. Darwin's expression depresses, then rolls onto his back, attemping to sit up. Blood rushes to his head and a sharp pain came from his leg, causing him to immediatly lie back down, shrugging in pain. He wonders what happened to Ven, and why he's not here. He also wonders if his team is searching for him. As questions passed through his mind, he continued to look outside, studying the village, and it's members. About an hour later, Elliot begins to awake. She rubs her eyes, and spots Darwin, looking out the window from his cot. Darwin notices Elliot, not regarding her presence. A few seconds pass, Darwin was the first to speak. \"The doc came by and left some food for you.\" Elliot rolled and saw the tray of seeds and stale bread, then turned back. \"What's your name?\" asked Elliot. \"Darwin.\" \"Darwin?\" She glared at his back as he continued to look out the window. \"What happened to you?\" said Darwin. He slowly turned and looked at Elliot, eye to eye. \"I was attacked..\" responded Elliot. \"By a- machine.. Red machine.\" Darwin's expression changed, as if he knew exactly what she was talking about. She continued, \"It stormed the house, destroying the walls. The debris fell and hit my back, paralyzing me, then left me buried in the destruction.\" \"How did you survive?\" \"My son came and buried me out. I was then taken to the doc's house, and brought back when they needed space.\" Darwin raises his head, then turns to look out the window again. \"Yup,\" said Elliot. \"And now I'm here looking at the guy who caused it all.\" Darwin sharply turned to Elliot. \"After all the destruction you caused this village and my family, I'm surprised Ven didn't kill you.\" \"You know Ven?\" \"He's my son.\" \"Your son!?\" \"Yes..\" Elliot pauses. \"But not anymore, he's probably..\" She turns away in anxiety. Darwin doesn't respond. A few more seconds pass as Elliot gathers her thoughts, \"Do you know?\" said Elliot. Darwin looks back at her as she turns back around. \"Do you know why he sacrificed his life to save yours?\" Darwin hesitates, \"U-Uh.. I'm his.. Brother, apparentely.\" Elliot perks up, \"Brother? I don't have any other young that aren't dead.\" \"He only said that because he knows another pig named Hurley.\" \"Hurley's alive!?\" \"Oh, so you know him too...\" \"Yes! Oh my god, he survived.\" Darwin gets mind boggled, \"Could you uh, explain?\" \"Well..\" Elliot spots a small photo of the village from two years ago. \"Look at the picture on the table besides you.\" Darwin turns and grabs the picture, studying it closely. There were about forty guinea pigs in the photo, inluding Elliot. Next to her, was a guinea pig who looked exactly like Hurley. Darwin's eyes opened, \"Whoa! Who is that next to you, is that Hurley?\" \"That's his father.\" Darwin was shocked, amazed by the new knowledge he had gained. \"So that's Hurley's dad,\" said Darwin. \"So if me and Hurley are brothers..\" \"I had four young,\" explained Elliot. \"Three boys and one girl. There was a fire; we only made it out with two, Ven and his sister, Lillie. We left two behind.\" \"Let me guess, Hurley and myself..\" Darwin pauses. \"I was told that I'm the runt of the family, is that true?\" \"Yes. You were smaller than the others, and weren't strong enough for feeding so..\" \"Did I have a birth name?\" \"Well, I guess 'the runt'. You were gonna die if you didn't get fed, I'm surprised you lived though, and Hurley. That puts me at ease.\" Darwin looks as the photo again, \"So I actually have two brothers, and sister? Where is she?\" \"She.. She got murdered by that same red machine.\" Darwin expression instantly changes and he puts the photo back, turning around at the window again. \"My father?\" \"I don't know. Haven't seen him since, probably suffered the same fate.\" \"I see,\" said Darwin. \"It makes sense now, why you would be after us. Me and my team were actually trying to stop that from happening.\" \"Huh?\" \"That machine you saw, it's called Clusterstorm. It was designed to be a weapon disguised as a regular appliance.\" \"Go on.\" \"I'm part of a team, called G-force. We went in to attack a guy named Saber, who was supposedly behind clusterstorm. But as it turns out, it was one of our own. By that time though, it was too late, and clusterstorm was already activated.\" \"Ven told me he saw someone on the TV who looked exactly like you.\" \"If it was on the news channel, then yes. We work for the FBI, so our mission is a secret. Any publicity would destroy our organization. The leaked footage almost did just that.\" \"So, if you were trying to stop it, why would Ven attack you?\" \"He probably made the assumption because of the news footage, I can see how.. The actual bad guy, 'Speckles', is already in custody.\" Elliot thinks for a moment, \"So really this was just a waste of time.\" Darwin looks out the window once more, seeing the appliances on the ground, \"I'm.. Sorry.\" Elliot smiles, \"You know, I'm just happy I get to see my son again.\" Suddenly the front door opens. It's Ellis, coming to check on his patients one last time before night. He walks in and notices Darwin awake. \"Hello,\" said Ellis. The voice seemed a bit nervous. \"Are you a.. friend?\" Darwin turns his head, \"I am, you the doc?\" Ellis pauses, \"Yes, my name is Ellis. What's your name?\" \"It's Darwin.\" \"I hope you know a lot of people here want answers, Darwin.\" \"I figured as much.\" A group of guinea pigs appear behind Ellis. Darwin looks over towards Elliot, knowing it's about to be a long night.[Chapter 23] Chapter 23: Reunion The next morning Tibbetts stands near the window, watching for anyone getting near the home. He glances over towards the pistol, ready to use it if anyone tries to enter the home. All of a sudden, the couch where Ven was resting, creeks. Tibbetts curiously turns around, seeing if Ven had awoken. Ven's eyes slowly open, and he attempts to sit up. \"Ven!\" shouted Tibbetts. Ven peeks over, \"Tibbetts?\" Tibbetts rushes over and hugs Ven, tightly squeezing him, \"You're okay!\" Ven attempts to resist the hug, but can't due to the lack of energy. He sighs, and accepts the hug. \"Where are we?\" asked Ven. \"My house,\" answered Tibbetts. \"I brought you here yesterday after.. well you know.\" Ven looks around getting a hold of his surroundings. He suddenly remembers the battle with Alexei, and realizes that's it's been a whole day. \"Wait..\" said Ven. \"Where's Darwin?\" \"Who?\" \"Darwin, the other one who looks like me.\" \"You mean the guy from the TV? He got taken to Ellis's.\" \"So the doc got him?\" \"Uh.. Yeah, I guess.\" Ven exhales in relief, \"Good..\" A few seconds pass, \"How you feeling?\" asked Tibbetts. Ven looks down at himself, \"Good, surprisingly.\" \"Can you stand?\" \"I can try.\" Ven prepares himself, then pushes himself off the couch. \"Ah!\" shrieked Ven. The pain from his leg causes him to collapse back onto the couch. \"Hold on..\" remarked Tibbetts. He grabs a small stick from the corner of the room, and hands it to Ven. \"Here, use this to support yourself.\" Ven places the stick on the ground, and once again pushes himself off the couch. He leans onto the stick, keeping the bad leg in the air. \"Look at you,\" said Tibbetts. \"You've already recovered enough to move. That's impressive for someone who got shot three times.\" Suddenly Ven gets dizzy, and sits back down. He looks down at his stomach, and spots the stitches, covered by bandages. \"You did this?\" said Ven. \"Yeah, Alexei took the blunt force of the rounds. So they weren't traveling fast enough to go through you all the way.\" He looks Ven in the eye. \"You're lucky, they didn't hit anything vital.\" Ven ganders around the room, and spots the operating table, covered in blood. \"You need to eat,\" said Tibbetts. He grabs a plate of seeds from another table across the room, Ven watches. Next to the plate, was Alexei's pistol. Ven glances at the pistol then rests his eyes onto it, knowing it's significance. Tibbetts returns and hands Ven the plate, but Ven was too focused on the makarov. \"Ven?\" asked Tibbetts. Ven snaps back into reality and accepts the plate of food, mind still focused on the pistol. \"Now,\" continued Tibbetts. \"Since you're okay, I'm gonna get some rest.. Haven't slept all night. I suggest you do the same.\" Ven looks at Tibbetts, nods, then returns his eyes onto the pistol. Tibbetts begins to walk upstairs, and out of sight. Ven continues to stare at the weapon, wondering about Alexei. His friend, brother at arms, gone in a instant. Ven couldn't stay in the house, he has to pay his respects. He places the plate of food down next to him and gets up, wobbling over towards the pistol. He snatches it. At Alexei's house Ven stands above Alexei's remains, shadow casting over him. He looks upon Alexei for minutes, trying not to regret the decision he had made. Ven soon decides he needs to bury him, and looks over towards the house. He spots a shovel, and stumbles towards it. Ven begins to dig a deep hole in the backyard of the house, near the edge of the drop-off. He drags Alexei and places him in the hole, covering it back up with dirt. He then places a few rocks rock around the area, circling the grave. Ven hesitates to speak, but murmurs out a word. \"Thanks.\" He slowly gets up and turns around, looking at the village from afar. He now wonders about Darwin, and his safety. He begins to stumble back to the village. In the Village As Ven slowly ventures through the village, he gets spotted by Hugo. \"Uh, who is that?\" shouted Hugo from his house. Ven stops and turns to Hugo, giving him a peculiar look. \"V-Ven?\" It doesn't take Hugo long to recognize the expression. \"Oh my, Tibbetts you actually did it!\" He rushes outside and approaches Ven. \"Y-You're alive!\" spurted Hugo. \"Where's Darwin?\" asked Ven. \"You mean your brother?\" \"What?.. How did you know that he was my brother?\" \"He told us.. You must have a bunch of questions.. C'mon, Darwin's recovering with Elliot.\" Hugo begins to assist Ven in walking towards his house. \"Is he alright?\" asked Ven. \"He's fine.. Now. Although he can't really move.\" \"What about my mother?\" \"She's fine as well.\" The two guinea pigs arrive at Elliot's house and stop at the front door. \"You go on in,\" said Hugo. \"They're your family..\" Ven smirks slightly and enters the house, shutting the door behind him. Inside, Darwin and Elliot lay eyes on Ven. No one says a word in disbelief, instead it goes into a sort of awkward stare down. \"Uh.. Hey,\" murmured Ven. \"Ven..\" whispered Elliot, in a shaking voice. \"You're..\" \"Alive? Yeah, everyone seems surprised by that.\" He looks over to Darwin. \"Hey, Darwin.\" \"Hi Ven,\" answered Darwin. Darwin studies Ven, noticing the bullet wounds around Ven's body. He smirks, \"Would you say this is karma?\" \"I guess so.\" \"Hurts, doesn't it..\" \"A little.\" Ven approaches Darwin, slowly kneeling besides him. \"Look, Darwin..- \"You're about to apologize, don't.\" \"I shouldn't have brought you here.\" \"No, this was a good thing. Because of you, I now know my history. Where I came from.. My family. Really, I should be thanking you.\" Elliot calls out to Ven, he turns. \"Thanks for listening to me Ven, you've made me complete as well.\" Everyone smiles, then the door opens from behind. It's some village members, with Tibbetts. \"Ven!\" shouted a guinea pig. \"Yes, I'm alive,\" answered Ven. \"Ven, I told you to rest,\" said Tibbetts. \"I needed to make sure they were alright.\" \"Well, they're fine.\" Hugo stepped up towards Ven, \"Tibbetts told us everything, as well as Darwin.\" \"So is everything good now?\" asked Ven. \"No, we still have to worry about the village, and rebuilding the houses. Now that Alexei is gone, we don't anyone to help.\" \"Actually,\" interrupted Darwin. \"I know just the people to help.\" A few hours later A white van parks in front of the breeders house. On the side of the van, is marked \"A.C.M.E. Exterminators\". A large male walks out of the van, it's Ben, the scientist. Two other guinea pigs hop off the van, Blaster and Juarez. Blaster has a patch on shoulder due to the bullet wound, and Juarez has a cast. Blaster looks upon the breeders home, \"This is where Darwin's at?\" Juarez nods in agreement, \"A random house in the hills?\" Ben interrupts, \"Well guys, let's find him.\" They all walk together and knock on the door, no one answers. Ben puts his hand on the door knob, and it opens. \"Hmm?\" remarked Ben. \"Unlocked..\" The three walked inside the trashed home, transformed appliances still littered the area. \"Hello!?\" hollared Ben. They walk into the kitchen and spot the dried up blood from the breeder, and a broken glass door leading to the backyard. \"This place is seriously creeping me out,\" said Blaster. Juarez stepped in, \"Are you sure this is the place, Ben?\" \"This is the address Darwin told me over the phone.\" Blaster peeks out the back door and spots a guinea pig in the grass, \"Hey guys, come look!\" Ben and Juarez catch up and also look out the backyard. \"I think we found it,\" said Ben. The three look upon the village, many of the miniature houses destroyed. Ben walks outside, and hears a squeak, from a guinea pig. He looks down, it's Tibbetts. \"Why hello,\" said Ben. Tibbetts squeaks back, but Ben doesn't understand. He points out to Blaster and Juarez, \"Guys, what's he saying?\" \"He asking if we're the g-force people,\" said Blaster. He directs his attention to Tibbetts. \"Yes, we are. What's your name?\" \"Tibbetts, what's yours?\" \"I'm Blaster, so do you know where Darwin is?\" Tibbetts looks up at Ben, \"Follow me.\" The guinea pig scurries towards the house near the back of the village, Elliot's home. Ben and the others follow. \"These houses are the perfect size for us,\" remarked Juarez. Blaster agreed, \"I think we just found our vacation spot, Juarez.\" \"No no, these houses don't have electricity..\" Tibbetts rushes inside Elliot's home, where the remainder of the village stuck around. \"Guys, they're here!\" shouted Tibbetts. Ben approaches the home and kneels down to the half destroyed house. Tibbetts walks back out, the remainder of the village follows. Ben reaches into his pocket and brings out several voice decoders. \"Take these,\" said Ben. \"They will help me understand you.\" Tibbetts, Ellis, and Hugo all grab one. Blaster and Juarez helps fit them on the various guinea pigs. \"C-Can you hear me?\" asked Tibbetts. \"I can,\" answered Ben. \"Woah, this is so cool!\" \"Anyway, to business. Where's Darwin?\" \"Darwin's inside the house with Ven.\" Suddenly a guinea pig, stumbles out of the home. It's Ven. \"Darwin!\" shouted Juarez. \"No,\" corrected Tibbetts. \"That's Ven.\" He grabs a decoder and hands it to Ven. Ven puts it on. He looks up, \"You must be Ben.\" \"I am.\" Blaster slowly moves up towards Ven, and stops in front of him. \"So you're the one,\" said Blaster. Ven moves back in defense, \"And you are, Blaster?\" Blaster looks upon Ven, wanting to attack, but knows the whole deal was a misunderstanding. \"I'm sorry for what I did,\" said Ven. Blaster pauses, then accepts the apology. \"You're good, my man.\" Ven looks at Ben. \"I'm pretty sure you want Darwin now, right?\" \"Please,\" answered Ben. Ven turns, \"Doc?\" He gestures to pick up Darwin. Ellis tells some helpers to lift Darwin outside. They walk inside to grab the crippled pig, and bring him back out. Tibbetts hands Darwin his decoder, \"Hey guys, how ya doing?\" \"Darwin!\" Blaster and Juarez rush over to give Darwin a big hug. He shrugs, \"Okay guys, that hurts, please stop!\" \"Darwin,\" spurted Juarez. \"We thought you went AWOL.\" \"I actually would of been dead if it wasn't for these people.\" \"But these people kidnapped you!\" \"Yeah, but I got to meet my mother, and Ven.\" \"Is he really your brother?\" asked Blaster. \"Just look at him... Yes, he is.\" \"Alright,\" interrupted Ben. \"We'll talk more on the way back, conserve your energy.\" \"Hold on,\" uttered Darwin. Ben pauses. \"Ben, can you help these people? They are in dire need of attention.\" \"Darwin, we need to get back.\" \"Ben, my family is here, please.\" \"I can't bring all of them back to the lab..\" \"I'm not asking you too, just give some support.\" Ben sighs, \"Okay, I'll send some supplies and people to help clean this place up later, let's just leave now.\" \"Thanks Ben.\" \"Let's just go.\" Darwin turns, \"Hey Ven.\" Ven responds. \"I have a question.\" Ven turns his head in curiosity. \"Take this seriously.. Do you wanna join us? Work for the government, and be part of an elite team?\" \"What?\" \"You clearly have the skill to make it far, after what you did.\" Ven doesn't respond. Darwin continues, \"Join us, I would love to work alongside another brother.\" Ven thinks hardly, looking over to the village. \"I.. can't.\" \"Why not?\" \"My place is here, people are here. They need me, and I need them. Sorry Darwin.\" \"Well think it over. If you ever need anything, you know where to call me.\" \"Will do.\" Darwin gets picked up by Ben. He smiles at the villagers and makes his way out of the backyard. Blaster and Juarez follow. Tibbetts walks up to Ven, \"Why didn't you accept the offer? You are worth way more than this village.\" \"No, this place needs me now more than ever. It's my home.\" He looks over to Tibbetts, \"Besides who's gonna keep you in check?\" \"You've changed, Ven... C'mon, let's eat some lunch.\" The End Don't worry. The book may be completed, but it's far from over. Ven will have many adventures, past and future. Also, this book is currently becoming a full animated film, check it out on the BlenderArtists website. Once again, Thanks for reading! For my first writing to pass 40k words is good in my book! The Story of Ven 2 will come in the near future, read the Epilouge[Chapter 24] Epilogue Three weeks have past since G-force have arrived. The village was near fully restored and cleaned up with debris. Ven now lives in Alexei's house, occasionally going to the backyard to visit the grave and remember all the great times they've had. Tibbetts got a seperate house rebuilt and lives with the lead pig. He often visits Ven and talk about adventures or anything in mind. Tibbetts really looks up to Ven now, almost as a brother. Ellis got his own house, specifically for doctoring things, as well as a house for him to sleep in. The shack with food got torn down with a replacment area that automatically dispenses food to the villagers. The breeders home got bought by the government, and used by Ben as a secondary base. Everything is well. One rainy night, Ven and Tibbetts were chatting in Alexei's house. Suddenly, a digging noise comes from the backyard, Tibbetts was the first to hear. He notifies Ven, and walks towards the backdoor, slowly opening it. A few moments later, a loud gunshot, and a mist of blood. ","Summary":" WARNING! This is long novel with about 23 chapters. It's very graphic in a few parts, and has prett"},{"Movie":"Con Air","Title":"Homemade Cookies And Love-Starved Murderers","Author":"BrunetteMarionette","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10957342","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A little pitter patter of feet could be heard in the usually deserted halls of San Quentin State Prison, a tiny sob here and there could be heard too. In one of the cells one of the most deadliest men sat, Cyrus Grissom AKA Cyrus the Virus, that's what they called him on the fact that he killed more men than cancer. He sat up in his bed wondering where that crying was coming from, he calmly walked to the door of his cell and saw a strange sight he thought he would never see in a prison. The sight was one of a tiny girl running with tears running down her face, now said girl was dressed very ironically for being in a prison she was wearing a red dress and cape holding a wicker basket, Cyrus smirked to himself being reminded of little red riding hood. The little girl stopped near his door and looked up at him with big doe eyes, Cyrus just looked back unable to think of something to say back to the girl all he could think was the girl was unusually pretty for such a young person and that could be dangerous in this place. \"Hi mister\" Cyrus looked down again to see the girl had stopped crying now but was still staring up at him, he bent down to the girls level so she didn't have to strain her neck. Now Cyrus was definitely known for being a dangerous man but there was something different about this girl. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked the girl bluntly he was never one to beat around the bush even with a child. The girl started sobbing again before trying to talk but Cyrus couldn't understand what she was trying to say \"Whoa how about you stop crying and talk normally\" Being a 20 year old man Cyrus was definitely happy that he wasn't going to have kids especially if this is all they do. The little girl wiped her tears with the hand that wasn't holding the basket and hiccuped a bit before turning back to the man behind the glass door \" I came to visit my daddy in work, I brought his some cookies me and mommy made but he was being mean to someone in his office and I got scared and ran\" the girls eyes started to glass over again but she didn't want to cry because the man wouldn't be able to know what she was saying, Cyrus stood and thought over what she had just told him, he dad worked in an office here but the only person who has an office in the entire prison has to be... Cyrus began to smirk like a Cheshire cat. \"Sweetie\" he began in a false nice tone \"Who's your daddy\" the little girl looked confused as if Cyrus should know who her daddy was \"My daddy's name is Thomas\". Cyrus couldn't believe his luck when the girl had confirmed that her father was the warden, he was bored of this place he had escaped so many times, caused riots and killed a couple of his fellow inmates so when this little girl literally ran into his life it was like a gift had landed straight into his lap, He couldn't think of a better place to hurt the warden then his heart. Cyrus looked at the little girl who had gone quiet and thought of the endless possibilities of things he could do to destroy the warden but those thoughts vanished when he felt something being pushed into his hand, he looked down to see the little girl had given him the cookies she has made for her father he smiled a little for the innocent gesture was the nicest one he had seen for a while. \"What's your name kid?\" He asked her biting the cookie she had given him seeing her doing the same with one from her basket. She looked up into his dark brown eyes \"My names Nicole, what's yours?\" Nicole asked innocently obviously not knowing who he was. Cyrus chuckled a little at Nicole's naivety \"Cyrus\" Nicole cocked her head to the side and puckered her lips in thought before nodding \" I like it\" The duo sat there eating their cookies in silence before they both heard a woman screaming Nicole's name and very loud footsteps, Nicole jumped up and gave Cyrus the rest of cookies and brushing the crumbs of her new red dress \"I have to go now Mister Cyrus but I'll be back again\" before Cyrus could say anything Nicole had run off in the direction of her mom and the group of guards who had obviously been sent to find her. \"Nicole Elsie Monroe don't you run off like that again, don't you know what type of bad people live here\" The overly blonde woman grabbed her daughters hand and roughly dragged her down the hall whilst the warden shouted at her for running away, Cyrus didn't like that, not one bitRuby went back to see Mister Cyrus whenever she could and she always brought him a cookie and asked him why her mommy said he was a bad man Cyrus didn't have an answer for this but it seems like Nicole had already made her mind up that he 'wasn't really a bad man' and that he was 'just playing around' Cyrus couldn't deny that he had developed a soft spot for the little girl who ran straight into his life. He couldn't help but like her little visits he was surprised but how smart and witty the girl was, some of the things she asks him or says to him would get her killed if she were anybody else but she wasn't anybody else she was her. Soon Nicole stopped visiting because she had to go to school but she would bring him back pictures and paintings that she had done, he hid them in a hole in the wall so no one would find them. Cyrus was surprised that her father or any of the guards had figured out that she was missing or that fact that she was roaming the halls of a prison, a few of the other prisoners had noticed that she visits him but never says anything from fear of him although Nicole has made a friend in Nathan AKA Diamond Dog it seems that she has managed to worm her way into his heart too. Nathan's and Cyrus's cells were opposite one anothers so whenever Nicole visited she could see them both, she still didn't understand why her mommy told her to stay away from them because they're bad people, they didn't seem bad and they were always nice to her, Nathan always calls her baby girl and Cyrus calls her sweetheart she likes it, it makes her happy. Nicole had just finished her visit with Cyrus and Nathan she had given them both finger painting she had done in school today \"See you next week baby girl\" Nathan said to her, she was the only child he could tolerate without thinking of killing her, Nicole smiled brightly waving to both men and ran down the hall but stopped dead when she remembered something, she ran back to cyrus's cell and put the biggest cookie she had made him yet through the hole in the door \"Happy Birthday Cyrus\" and ran off again. Cyrus looked down to the cookie, double chocolate chip his favourite, it had been a while since anyone had wished him a happy birthday he wondered how she could have known it was his birthday \"She's a clever girl that one\" Nathan told him lying down on his dirty cot, Cyrus just nodded his head and thought about Nicole and the poisonous environment she was being brought up in, he had to do something to help her. A now 14 year old Nicole is running down the hall towards Cyrus's cell just like she had 9 years ago, she hadn't changed much just grown in height. Nicole reached a now 29 year old Cyrus's cell who was calmly reading a book until the girl he had seen grow up into a teenager slam on his glass door sobbing, he was brought back to the memory of how they first met. \"What's happened\" he asked roughly hoping that no one had hurt her, she slipped down the side of the wall and sat next to his door her head in her hands. \"They're getting a divorce and mom got costodey of me\" Cyrus didn't understand why this would make her cry so much so he sat with this back to the wall just as she was sat, Nathan was in the visiting room, he usually deals with her crying but he wasn't here and Cyrus didn't know how to deal with crying girls. \" Don't worry about it most parents split up\" Cyrus said thinking about his own parents but that didn't last long before he killed them both. Nicole stood up and slammed her hands on the glass of his door, Cyrus had never seen so much rage from her before it looks wrong on her beautiful face. \"My mom is moving us to Alabama, I'm never going to see you again\" Cyrus was quiet, he couldn't imagine a life without her in it. \"We're leaving tomorrow morning\" Nicole looked at Nathan's cell and saw he was missing \"Tell Nathan I said goodbye\" Nicole looked at Cyrus who was now on his feet looking angry and took a chocolate chip cookie out of her pocket, she quickly put it through the hole in his door \"I'm Sorry\" and ran back to her dad's office. Her dad wasn't in his office so she sat at his desk and waited for him, a box on his desk caught her eye 'Prisoner Mail' she smiled and looked up the address to send letters to and decided that this wouldn't be the last time she spoke to Cyrus or Nathan. Determined she logged on to her dads computer and found the number for both Cyrus and Nathan and wrote them down before her dad came back, she logged off the computer just as her dad walked into the room looking sad he shut the door behind him and looked up to see Nicole sitting in his chair he rushed forward and grabbed his only child into a hug \"I'm sorry princess\" Nicole just shrugged her shoulders, she was a daddy's girl at heart but was angry he didn't fight hard enough for her. \"You can come visit me whenever you like\" Nicole snorted he never noticed when she was here anyway, he couldn't run a prison and be a dad he never noticed the times she had slipped away to talk to Nathan and Cyrus and she had been doing it for 9 years \"I'm not angry at you daddy, i'm just disappointed. You let me down\" Nicole kissed her father on the cheek and walked out of his office wondering if she'd ever be back. Weeks later Cyrus had received something he had never had before in all of the years of being in prison, a letter, he opened the letter and a cookie fell out with a note on it \"I'll never forget you!\" he laughed what a sneaky girl! Inside the envelope was an address, her address, the letter was signed from Cookie Monster. Cyrus couldn't believe she had managed to pull something like this off, he would be able to keep tabs on her through her letter and isolate her so she would always be his, Cyrus had planned this for years he believed for her to become his he would have to turn her against her family not that it would be hard to do, over the years of writing to her Cyrus had become obsessed with her and when her letters stopped a year later he became so fixated on getting her back he tried to escape so he could track her down but the longer time grew the more heinous Cyrus became.[Chapter 2] Thomas Monroe sighed running a hand through his premature greying hair, the stress of being the warden was getting to him he was ageing more everyday and now his only daughter was coming to visit him, he knows he should be excited but really he was nervous to see her he knew he had lost a lot of time with her and he would never forgive himself for that. Thomas sat at his desk and looked at the only photo he has of her on his desk she was 5 in this picture it was taken the day she had gone missing in the prison the day he thought he had lost her, she was wearing a red dress and cap she wanted to look like the little red riding hood it as her favourite story as her mother had told him, Thomas laughed bitterly he didn't even know his daughters favourite story what kind of father was he? A knock at the door brought Thomas out of his thoughts and he quickly placed the photograph on the desk and straightened up \"Come in\" he boomed in his authoritative voice and in stepped Craig one of the guards on duty \"Sir, We have Cyrus he as you asked\" Thomas nodded quickly remembering that he had scheduled an appointment with the resident 'virus' \"bring him in\" the guard scuttled out of the door shaking he was obviously new around here, Thomas sat at his desk patiently Cyrus Grissom always which buttons to press and Thomas couldn't afford to loose his temper today. Two guards walked back through the door accompanied by the 6 foot bald evil being that is Cyrus Grissom, the guards sit Cyrus in the seat and sat by the door \"Mr Grissom\" Thomas acknowledges politely causing Cyrus to throw his head back laughing \"no need to be false Tommy boy we all know who you really are\" Cyrus exclaimed cheekily his eyes roaming the office, Thomas gritted his teeth \"Cyrus we have received a letter from the super maximum prison, Holman Correctional Facility in Alabama, they have agreed to house you there until...\" Thomas looked up at Cyrus who did not look interested in any way but had his eyes trained on the desk more specifically the picture of Nicole a bead of sweat appeared on Thomas's face when Cyrus carefully picked up the picture \"That's my daughter Nicole, She's coming to visit soon\" Thomas told the bald man not feeling as authoritative as he had before now the virus had seen the picture of his only child Thomas quickly took the photograph away and put it in the desk causing Cyrus to laugh again \"Well well if it isn't Little Red\" Cyrus drawled causing shivers to go up Thomas's spine. – Cyrus smirked as he watched the warden visibly shiver probably at the thought of his precious baby anywhere near him. \"How do you know her?\" Thomas asked an octave above a whisper leaning forward as Cyrus leaned back in his chair smirking \"12 years ago little red was found roaming the halls lucky for you all the big bad wolves were locked away\" Cyrus told the warden darkly he never would have hurt Nicole but her father didn't need to know that. The warden shot up and cleared his throat Cyrus looked at him amused as the warden straighten his tie and walked over to the guards Cyrus leant back on his chair causally straining his eyes to listen without looking like he was eavesdropping \"My daughter will be here later today make sure she doesn't have any trouble okay boys?\" Cyrus smirked to himself she was coming home to him and now he would have to set a plan in motion to keep her from leaving again. – Nicole sighed looking out of the window and seeing the clouds pass her by she had been on this plane for 5 hours now and was getting antsy she wasn't nervous about the plane, no she was fine with planes it was the thought of seeing them again seeing him Nicole knew that he wouldn't have forgotten about her but she had tried to forget about him now her child naivety had worn off she could see how villainous he really was but it didn't stop her from still caring about him did that make her a bad person? Ladies and Gentlemen we are now landing in San Francisco International so please buckle up and have a nice day Nicole groaned hearing the cheers of the other passengers around her here goes nothing. Grabbing her suitcase Nicole walked into the pick up point of the airport searching for her father but her heart dropped seeing a stranger holding up a sign 'Nicole Monroe' Walking up to the woman Nicole smiled sadly \"I'm Nicole\" she told the female who gave her a warm smile \"Hi I'm Sally Bishop one of the guards at the prison\" Nicole nodded absent-mindedly looking the guard over she was an inch shorter than Nicole and had darker skin \"Where's my dad?\" Nicole asked bluntly, Sally visibly cringed \"he was busy with work\" Nicole laughed spitefully \"When isn't he?\" she spat out walking away with Sally running after her pointing Nicole in the right direction of the car \"I'm sorry\" Sally told the young girl, Nicole shrugged \"I'm used to it. Workaholic father alcoholic mother, what a sob story\" Sally looked at the girl sadly she had obviously brought herself up. Unlocking the car Sally put Nicole's suitcase in the trunk whilst said girl was sitting in the car patiently Sally couldn't help but feel bad for the girl but also protective she knew what it was like having deadbeat parents and being strong for yourself. Sally got into the car and pulled off towards the prison the car was silent for half of the journey before Nicole piped up \"I'm sorry\" Sally looked at the young girl confused \"for being bitchy\" she carried on whilst looking at anything but the female guard \"It's rough having to be your own parent\" Sally nodded in agreement \"yeah..but from what I hear you've done pretty well. Graduated high school by 15 and now in college and a cheerleader too i'm guessing?\" Nicole looked down at her cheer outfit \"Captain of the squad, I didn't have time to change\" Nicole said blushing \"Well it's probably not the best choice of clothes to wear to a men's prison but you'll be fine\" Sally concluded as they pulled up to a fence with a speaker box which Sally spoke to giving her name and I.D \"Have a good day Sam\" Sally called into the speaker box as the big iron gates opened. Nicole looked out of the window watching the guards walking around patrolling and she couldn't help but think about him and what he would be doing right now. \"And here we are?\" Sally said stopping the car Nicole smiled in appreciation at the older woman \"Thanks Sally\" Sally smiled and got out of the car grabbing the suitcase on the way \"Come on I'll take you to your dad\" Nicole nodded as Sally guided her through the prison and up to the top floor. They stopped in front of a door Nicole smiled as memories started to spring back into her mind before jumping when Sally knocked the door \"Come In\" A very familiar voice boomed, Nicole pushed the door open and walked in seeing her father again for the first time in 3 years \"Hi dad\" Nicole whispered as her fathers head bounced up \"Nicole is that you?\" Nicole nodded feeling a little emotional at the look on her fathers face. Thomas got to his feet quickly and pulled his daughter into his chest a cough knocking them out of their reunion \"I'm going to go back to work now sir\" Sally said not wanting to disturb the father and daughter \"Thank you Sally\" Nicole smiled at Sally who wave goodbye to the young girl. Nicole walked over to the window and looked out to see nothing but iron bars, guards and prisoner but she could also see the sun beginning to set \"It's nice to see you again pumpkin\" her dad said sitting back at his desk \"How's your mother?\" Nicole grimaced slightly \"good\" she replied shortly knowing her didn't really care her father nodded distracted as he wrote on his paper work. Nicole walked around the office looking at pictures and certificates but nothing of her or the rest of her family frowning Nicole realised her dad really was cut off from everyone. \"So how's high school?\" Nicole looked at her dad shocked \"I already graduated dad I'm in college now getting a doctorate, Grandma told you and sent you a picture\" Nicole told him bitterly she already wished she never bothered coming here \"Oh well congratulations\" he father said once again distracted Nicole shook her head in disbelief neither of her parents were proud for her. Nicole angrily wiped away a tear that fallen determined not to cry about her parents they weren't worth it. \"I almost forgot..\" her father said opening his desk draw and pulled out a pack of cookies \"..I remembered you like them\" Nicole stood there numb as she held the cookies in her hands the cookies she always brought with her when she was a kid were for him not because she liked them a thought flew into her mind she knew one person who always appreciated the cookies she made and always seemed to enjoy them. Gripping the cookies tightly in her hand Nicole walked to the door \"Thanks dad\" she muttered \"Where are you going?\" her dad exclaimed \"I'm gonna go look around don't worry all the bad men are behind bars and glass\" Nicole replied sarcastically before walking down the familiar hallways before reaching the one she needed, holding her head high Nicole walked closer and closer to his cell her stomach knotting the closer she got she could hear the wolf whistles but choose to ignore them until finally she came to the door of his cell \"Well don't you uh know it's dangerous walking around here?\" the bald man asked her with no recollection of her on his face. Nicole looked at him he looked no different to what he did 3 years ago except for the muscle he had gained \"You don't remember me\" She teased seeing him look very confused, she looked to the right to see Nathan was still here too and looking at her quizzically \"I think if we had met before I would have remembered\" A voice drawled Nicole jumped seeing Cyrus standing closer to the cell do but she pulled a cookie out of the packet and put it through the cell door \"How about now?\" she smirked walking away. – Cyrus looked down at the cookie in his hand and back to the blonde girl in the cheerleaders uniform it couldn't be her. \"I told you that girl was smart\" Nathan said lying down on his cot and reading a magazine, Cyrus nodded biting into the cookie thinking about her the way she looked, sounded and smelled, It had been a while since he had been with a woman or really even seen on except that negro guard and the old library lady. Laughing to himself Cyrus lay down thinking about Nicole she was pretty as a girl but now she was beautiful and it only made him want her more and he would have her he was sure of it. So this is the second chapter of the story hope you liked and leave a comment for me, Hope to hear of some of you soon you're all that keeps me going with these stories. I've never written in 3rd person before so please let me know how I did thanks for reading! x[Chapter 3] Nikki sighed as she woke it was her first official day with her dad at the prison and she was not looking forward to it honestly she didn't really know why she bothered to come in the first place her dad never paid attention to her when she was her as a kid, hell the prisoners took more care of her than her own father. \"Nicole! Breakfast!\" sighing again Nikki trudged her way down the stair and was greeted with the sight of her father putting bowls of cereal and orange juice on the table. Standing on the bottom step Nikki studied her father she saw his greying hair and harsh demeanour but she realised she didn't really know him at all. \"Morning\" she mumbled sitting down in the chair opposite her father's and stared down into the bowl which contained what looked like muesli \"Sorry It's usually just me eating\" her father told her seeming embarrassed by his lack of preparation for his daughter's stay. She just shrugged and poured some milk into the bowl and began eating, an uncomfortable silence filled the air as we ate but it was soon disturbed by her father's voice \"after breakfast get dressed and you can come to work with me\" Nikki looked at her father and nodded there wasn't nothing else to do she supposed. Standing Nikki put her bowl into the sink and walked back up the stairs to shower and get dressed \"Try to wear something that won't excite the inmates this time\" her father shouted up the stairs sternly making Nikki roll her eyes it wasn't her fault she was late from practice and had to catch her flight. After her shower Nikki quickly dried her hair and left it naturally wavy then applied a little bit of make up for her own pleasure not because she wanted to 'excite' anybody. Shaking her head at her father's words Nikki quickly pulled together an outfit as she heard her father hollering up the stairs. \"I'm coming!\" looking at herself in the mirror Nikki nodded and walked back down the stairs where her father stood waiting for her \"The car is open\" Nikki grimaced he was acting more like a drill sergeant than a father. Getting in the car Nikki wondered why he father didn't just walk or cycle to the prison it was only 10 minutes away, looking to her left her wheezing unfit father got into the car and Nikki's previous question was answered. The warden wasn't a large man he was just unfit and unwell from the amount of cigarettes he had smoked in his life it was no big shock that he was this bad. Walking into her father's air conditioned office Nikki was already bored she smiled as she remembered feeling the same every time she visited as a child. \"So Nicole...\" Nikki's head jumped up to look at her father who motioned to the seats in front of his desk \"You said you were studying for a doctorate?\" Nikki was stunned she didn't think her father was actually listening to her yesterday when she was talking to him \"Yes sir\" she replied swallowing nervously as her father has an unreadable look on his face \"What are you studying?\". Nikki smiled \"Psychology\" after meeting Cyrus and Nathan she had definitely become very interested in the mind of criminals and decided that's what she wanted to pursue with her life, when she graduated she was going to get a job at a prison for the criminally insane. Her father looked at her stoically and It made Nikki freeze wondering what he could be thinking \"Hmm well I was thinking you'd like to get a job here and when it's time take over for me\" Nikki sat in shock her father wanted her to work her and then become the warden? \"But my doctorate\" Nikki stuttered but her father put his hand up \"You won't need a doctorate if you worked here, Nicole as my only child you are my heir to this place\" her father said holding up his hands like he was offering her the deal of a lifetime. \"Well that's not my fault!\" Nikki tried to argue back making her father frown at her \"Nicole\" Nikki jumped up out of her seat \"No!\" walking out of her dad's office she sighed bringing her hand to her head thinking what had just happened. \"Hey\" Nikki's head shot up to see a cute guard looking at her, he looked to be in his mid-20's \"I'm Ryan and I'm supposed to keep you safe whilst you're here\" Nikki growled under her breathe her father had ordered one of his guards to be her baby sitter. \"Sure. Let's go\" Ryan nodded and walked in sync with Nikki \"So where are we going\" her asked Nikki curiously making her laugh something she very much needed right now \"You know this place better than I do\" she told him making him blush red. \"Right. You look like a girl who likes to read\" Nodding Nikki followed Ryan to the library passing convicts left and right who either watched her with hungry eyes or whistled at her. \"here we are\" Ryan announced pointed to the library which had a handful of prisoners in it. Nikki walked forward which caused Ryan to follow her closely, clearing her throat Nikki looked at Ryan \"Do you think maybe you could loosen the leash a little\" she asked in a joking but serious voice causing Ryan to jump back. \"Sure I'll just be…over there\" he said pointing to where some older guards where stood talking, wonder If my father knows he pays people to just stand and talk Nikki thinks whilst walking around the other side of the bookshelf. Looking up to the signs above her head she smiled seeing a fairy tale section, looking behind her she sees Ryan talking animatedly to the other guards and snuck over to the fairy tale book and scanned through them mentally cheering when she found the one she wanted. Picking up the book she wanted Nikki gasped feeling an arm turning her around and another over hear mouth \"Hello little red…\"[Chapter 4] My eyes widened when I was pushed against the book shelf with Cyrus holding an unusually soft calloused hand over my mouth, he tsked as he looked me over \"What do we have here? Little red running around alone again?\" Feeling my eyes squint at Cyrus who was smiling like a wolf I looked over to see If I could see Ryan or another guard, Cyrus followed my line of view but didn't stop smiling \"So now you know how much of a bad guy I am, you didn't care before\" Moving my face away from Cyrus's hand I growled at him \"I was a child back then\" he laughed and stroked my face lightly \"If you thought I was so bad you would have screamed by now\" huffing I looked down in thought. \"It's been a long time\" Cyrus muttered lowly rubbing a strand of my hair between his fingers \"Heard you were a little genius graduating early and now a doctorate\" Cyrus whistled sarcastically but his eyes looked proud. I froze looking at the man I used to hold on a pedestal \"how did you know that?\" I asked in fear my breath restricting a little, Cyrus leaned his face in closer to mine \"I have my ways\" his eyes travelled down to my hands where I still held tightly onto the book I chose. Cyrus laughed as he plucked it from my hands \"Little Red Riding hood, see nothing's changed sweetheart\" looking up into his eyes defiantly I smirked \"What big teeth you have\" Cyrus smiled widely and leaned down again so we were face to face he put his hand either side of my head \"All the better to eat you with\" \"Grissom! Step away from the girl\" looking over Cyrus's arms I saw the guards pointing their guns and Tasers at us, Cyrus looked up at them \"Do you mind? We were talking\" he told them coolly before backing away from me \"Until we meet again sweetheart\" picking up my book I ran back to dad's office and didn't look back. 2 hours later I was huffing from the heat I had taken off my hoodie and was lay on dad's office couch with a fan on me, a fast knock at the door had my attention \"Come\" dad shouted from behind his desk. Ryan walked in with another guard they both looked worried \"Sir the convicts are getting out of hand, what do we do?\" I snickered causing all eyes to look at me \"they're probably melting\" I said kind of feeling sorry for them being stuck in a cell in this heat. \"We've had fights breaking out all of the place\" Ryan blurted looking very nervous, dad just sighed and wiped his face with a towel \"Nicole is right it's just the heat the AC must be down. Get more guards down there for back up, Nicole you go too it'll be good for you to see what we do\" Jumping up from my chair \"Me? Why?\" Dad sighed as he stood gathering papers \"We talked about this Nicole now please\" Dad motioned to the guards who were stood awkwardly waiting for me \"Great\" I groaned following Ryan out of the room. \"Don't worry Nicole you are perfectly safe\" the older guard told me in a southern voice which I guess was supposed to be comforting \"I'm Gary\" he said holding a hand out for me to shake \"Nikki\" Gary nodded and we entered a room which they told me most of the prisoners were kept. Hearing cat calls I looked around seeing all the prisoners in their cells which gave me some comfort \"Hey baby!\" I heard from a cell on the upper level \"Ergh\" I said wrinkling my nose in revulsion. Passing a cell, I heard a whistle turning I saw a tan man with loads of tattoos. \"Hey sexy wanna be number 24?\" he laughed showing me his heart tattoos I grimaced, Gary grabbed my arm and whispered \"That's Johnny Baja he's a serial rapist\" looking back I saw Johnny smirking at me causing me to shiver in disgust. Another middle aged guard walked out he looked like a dick \"Gary. Who's this?\" he said looking me up and down I was right he's a dick \"Nicole, Warden's daughter\" Gary muttered as Ryan walked away to the control room. \"Nikki this is Mike\" nodding I just kept looking around I had no wish to speak to Mike the dick. Fanning my face with my hand I huffed again \"Yeah the AC is down definitely\" a voice came from the Radio on Gary's belt \"Dammit\" \"You gotta do something about this heat man\" A young Hispanic man said from behind his cells, Mike just looked at his \"We're doing the best we can\" he said with no conviction I looked at the man who was drenched in sweat they seriously can make these men live in this heat. \"You 're doing your best\" another man laughed sarcastically \"It must be over a hundred degrees in here!\" he shouted causing me to jump making Mike laugh I glared at him. Jerk. Hearing a buzzer my eyes widened when the cells started to open \"You're letting them out?\" Mike smirked at me obviously enjoying a young girls fear \"Yeah don't tell me you're scared\" he sarcastically pouted \"Leave her alone man\" Gary said shaking his head. After the cells opened all the prisoners lined up side by side outside of their cells all looking at each other murderously and sweating \"why don't you just transfer them somewhere cooler like Death Valley\" I called to him causing the prisoners to start laughing and jeering. The Hispanic man walked in front of the line laughing wiping his sweat away \"You shut it and you get behind the line convict!\" Mike shouted at me and the Hispanic man. More prisoners started walk over the line tauntingly. \"All of you get back\" Gary shouted looking around, I looked over to the control room where I could see Ryan looking at us very nervously. Mike picked up his radio and brought it to his mouth \"Hey we got a bunch of overheated rowdy cons here in A-Wing\" Feeling more nervous I suddenly wished for the one person who I was supposed to be afraid of \"Don't be a baby Garcia it's not that hot\" Mike called over to the antsy looking Hispanic who just looked shocked a moved forward again. Mike took out his baton and waved it threateningly \"Step away\" Garcia gritted his teeth \"I'll step off when I get some air in here\" Mike's face filled with a red hue and he looked up angry \"Ok everyone back into your cells it's lockdown! Now back! Lockdown!\" Some of the prisoners moved back into their cells but others stayed put defiantly, Gary grabbed my arm \"come on\" he muttered lowly as he pulled me away from the rowdy prisoners \"What's wrong?\" as soon as I uttered those words all hell broke loose. Garcia grabbed Mike's baton and hit the guard with it \"Quick close it\" Gary shouted \"What about Mike?\" we all looked up to see Garcia stand over Mike and twist his neck leaving his head at an odd angle. Ryan quickly pushed a button causing the door to the control room to close as most of the prisoners to riot \"Are we safe in here?\" I asked in fear. Gary nodded as he watched the convicts started to pull the place apart and fight with each other \"Yeah kiddo don't worry\" nodding I watch in astonishment at how fast this broke out and all because the AC was down. I watched as the prisoners are beginning to riot properly, clambering over metal protective frames, suddenly a couple of the convicts start kicking and tearing at the gate into the security room. A greying overweight man walks into the room with an air of arrogance \"What the hell is going on here?\" A/N I have changed my writing style on this one and now I'm going to be writing in first person so hopefully you (and I) don't get confused haha. Thanks for reading, reviewing, favouriting and following :D[Chapter 5] AHSfan23: Thank you :D Hope you enjoy this chapter! A/N: Sorry It's been a while my laptop was broke and I had to pay to get it fixed so here the next chapter! Ryan turned around a white as a sheet \"Lockdown, Falzon, uh sir\" Gary nodded as the prisoners kept pulling at tearing at the protective fencing \"With the warden's daughter still here?\" Gary turned to face Falzon \"thought it would be safer than leaving her\" Falzon nodded and looked out to see the prisoners getting more rowdy now he'd turned up. \"Woo ole Falzon is here we must be doing something right boys\" a convict said laughing from the other side of the fence, Falzon just smiled \"You know Peters I thought you were smarter than this but I don't have much hope for a redneck inbred\" Everything went quiet and we all stood looking at 'peters' who was stood in shock before roaring and launching himself at the fence \"I'll kill you all\" Peters shouts crazily causing the prisoners to start rioting again. \"yes! It's coming off!\" looking over at Ryan scared I noticed he had turned a little green, Gary and Falzon also looked a bit nervous. The protective fence was starting to squeak as it became more unsteady and loose. \"I thought you said we were safe in here!\" I cried as Gary grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the room as we hear the fence finally give way \"Yes!\" I heard a shout come from the control room \"Let's get out of here\" Gary shouted as sweat dripped from his forehead. Suddenly buzzing noises and alarm bells started to ring, holding my hands to my ears I looked up to a nervous looking Gary \"what's that?\" I shouted over the alarm bells, Gary looked down to me worried \"They've opened all the cells\" I felt my face drop as it hit me we were trapped in a prison full of convicts on the loose even the worst ones. Following Gary to god knows where I screamed as he was suddenly hit and fell to the floor \"Hello pretty\" looking over in fear I saw a group of men smiling at me causing me to scream and run. Looking up I see a sign for the hospital wing. Running into a room I locked myself in and began to search for another way out, the group of men have started to bang on the door trying to get in. Turning white I realized I had trapped myself in the worst room as the men left the door and started to slam on the big window that was the only thing protecting me from them. Looking out of the smaller barred window which was on the outside wall I saw police cars and other riot vans pulling up outside as well as news vans \"Hey! I'm up here help!\" I screamed through the small window as the men continued to attack the big glass window. The men were getting more riled up each time they hit at the window, looking behind them I felt my heart jump when I saw a familiar face \"Nathan! Nathan help please!\" the men look behind them to see a now angry 6-foot death row convict. I watched as Nathan started to fight with them men and getting a few hits in return hugging myself I watched as Nathan picks up the last prisoner and throws him at the window finally cracking it. Knocking on the window caused me to jump \"Baby girl?\" looking up I saw Nathan waving to me and point to the door. Running to the door I opened it and threw myself at my old friends sobbing \"I thought they were going to kill me\" Nathan patted my back and sighed \"It's not over yet princess\" looking up at the tall man I nodded sadly. Nathan grabbed my arm and pulled me out of the hospital wing \"Come on Cyrus is looking for you\" my eyes widened as I stood dead \"Cyrus? Are you crazy?\" Nathan laughed as he stopped next to me before looking serious. \"If you're hoping to survive this then Cy is the best person for you to be with, forget what you think about him now just remember we never hurt you before\" Nathan turned to walk away making me run after him \"Hey wait for me\" We had been walking down corridors with Nathan protecting me from anyone who crosses out paths until the gang who broke into the control room stepped in front of us, Nathan pulled me behind him \"Now you see I saw her first you know finder's keepers?\" Garcia told Nathan with a sick smile on his face. \"But for you I'm willing to share\" I moved uncomfortable as the men started to laugh and hoot between them, I felt the muscles in Nathan's arm start to tense up \"No deal, you think Cyrus would be happy to know what you're trying to do?\" Garcia and the other men tensed up a little before Garcia let out a nervous laugh \"Well the virus isn't here now is he\" Suddenly the men all jump forward at Nathan, I walk back until I felt the wall on my back and watched as Nathan defended himself. \"Run baby girl\" heading Nathan's warning I ran again and didn't stop until I found myself at Cyrus's cell \"shit!\" he wasn't here huffing I realised that I needed to stop running I had just left one of the 2 people who always protected me unaided. Picking up a lone metal pole I gathered my breath before hearing more alarm bells before the lights were shut off and red lights started to shine. Gripping my metal pole, I ran back down the hall seeing Nathan there still fighting and my heart skipped when I saw Cyrus jump out of nowhere. \"Shit it's him!\" Garcia screamed before more men jumped into the fight against Cyrus and Nathan, peeking around the wall I held my pole tighter until I walked out and started swinging hoping to hit someone. Ducking and jumping I realized my cheer leading and gymnastics were about to come in handy, I grimaced every time I felt my pole hit someone and a fist hitting me. Seeing someone about to hit Cyrus with a fire extinguisher I quickly jumped on their back. Hitting and scratching I screamed when they run us back into a wall making me slide to the floor in pain. Getting back up I heard Cyrus shouting my name before the last convict came running at me lifting my leg up I kicked the convict in the chin and smiled as he went down. Nathan and Cyrus looked at me in silence before Cyrus pulled me to him \"Are you ok?\" he asked with urgency nodding I smiled as Nathan laughed \"Wow baby girl I think you knocked him out cold\" looking over I saw Nathan hovering over the con I just kicked. Smiling I nodded and winced when I felt cuts and bruises on my face \"I'm tougher than I look\" Cyrus nodded in thought before he turned to Nathan \"let's get her out of here\" I glared at Cyrus as he talked like I wasn't here. Hearing screams coming from down the hall we walked away as gas canisters were being thrown through the windows, coughing I felt Cyrus pick me up and run down the hall with Nathan. Stopping we saw more convicts causing trouble \"Well looky here...\" one started before he was shot through the window. Cyrus, Nathan and me dropped to the floor before Cyrus nodded \"This way\" before crouching and walking in a different direction as snipers began shooting at the inmates. Walking behind Cyrus and Nathan I screamed at the window next to me was shot out. I was stuck at the end of the corridor whist Cyrus and Nathan were urging me to run to them, shaking my head I put my hands on my ears \"No way I'll never make it\" turning my head I heard voices behind me and fear gripped me when I saw an inmate walking to me with a sick smile. Looking at his black teeth I quickly got up and ran to Cyrus who caught me I turned back just in time to see the inmate being shot by the snipers \"Come on quick\" Nathan called as we up some steps to the top floor of the prison. Realizing where they were taking me I ran towards my dad's office and banged open the door \"Dad?\" looking around I realised he wasn't here. Cyrus and Nathan walked into the room behind me \"He's not here\" I told them as Cyrus walked over to the window and let out a short laugh. \"That's because he's nice and safe out there\" walking over to the window with Nathan I saw my dad outside with everybody else \"he didn't try to find me\" I whispered to myself sadly hoping neither men heard me but from their angry looks they did. Suddenly everyone started shouting as they noticed us in the window and Cyrus grabbed me and pulled us to the floor as a sniper shot out the window causing me to scream \"Hey!\" he screamed out loud. \"Let the girl go! I repeat let the girl go!\" I scrunched up my brows \"Assholes\" I muttered knowing they obviously think I'm a hostage. Cyrus pulled me up and pushed us against the wall next to the fire exit \"the door has a fire escape, go\" looking at the 2 men who were staring down at me I nodded. Hugging both men I put my hand on the door \"Thanks\" they nodded and began to retreat back when we started to hear footstep coming up the fire escape. Opening the door, I screamed seeing swat members pushing past me. Running down the stairs I was met half way by Sally who pulled me to her \"I got you\" she whispered as I broke down in tears \"Nicole\" my dad said walking up to us and put his arms out to me, shaking my head I shouted \"where were you?\" Dad just looked at me guiltily and put his arms down as reporters came over \"Warden! Is that your daughter?\" …\" Was she a hostage?\" … \"Did you leave your daughter inside\" dad turned to talk to the reporters as Sally guided me to an ambulance. \"Hey\" she said as she sat near me looking very disheveled herself \"Did anyone... did they?\" looking over at Sally she looked very nervous and concerned \"Nikki there are a lot of bad men in there, did any of them touch you?\" Shaking my head, I realized what she was asking \"No\" Sally sighed in relief and put a hand on my shoulder and was silent for a couple of minutes \"How did you manage to get out safe?\" she asked in amazement, looking back up to the fire escape I smiled \"Just lucky I guess\"[Chapter 6] It had been a week since the riot and I hadn't been allowed to go back in to the prison as it was deemed unsafe so I had been spending sometime at dad's house watching myself on the news and how I had been a hostage of the deadest riot in some time. Packing the last bit of my bag I looked at myself in the mirror I hadn't felt the same since that riot I felt darker but apparently I could still be in shock or so a therapist told my dad \"Happy 18th Birthday!\" I mumbled to myself before lifting my bag down the stairs I looked around the house before walking outside and making the short walk to the prison. I hadn't really spoke to my dad much since the riot after I had found that he made his was out safely instead of trying to find and help me, it wasn't the first time I had been abandoned by my parents and It won't be the last. I couldn't help but remember the look on Cyrus and Nathan's faces when they realised my dad had left me in the middle of a riot, remembering how protective they were even when I was a kid I knew I was lucky they found a soft spot for me or I'd be dead right now. \"Hey Nikki\" looking up I saw a battered looking Ryan manning the gate \"Hey get demoted?\" I asked seeing him in a different uniform then before, Ryan shook his head \"No they just think I would be better here\" nodding I saw his hands shaking a realised how big of an effect the riot had on him. \"You here to see your dad?\" shaking my head I patted my bags \"I'm going home\" Ryan looked shocked before looking down \"I'm sorry about that and the whole library thing too\" smiling I patted his shoulder in forgiveness and walked through the gate. Walking up to the prison I smiled seeing Sally and my dad outside \"Hey\" I smiled at them Sally smiled at me widely \"Hey kiddo haven't seen you in a while you look good\" looking down at my clothes I smiled. \"So I guess you're going home today?\" Sally said pointing to my bags, nodding I frowned as my dad hadn't said anything yet \"Well I'll miss you\" she said with a smile and hugged me \"don't be like that Sally it's not time for goodbye yet plus you've got the whole plane journey\" dad said signing papers given to him by his sectary. I looked at my dad with a raised eyebrow as Sally looked shocked \"plane ride sir?\" Dad nodded as a bus pulled up being us \"Yes Nicole here is going to be joining you on the first Jailbird plane ride\" looking between my dad and Sally I was confused. \"But sir there will be convicts on that plane\" Sally protested with a look of disbelief on her face \"She's going Bishop, end of conversation\" Sally nodded and walked over to the bus as my dad \"What's the jailbird?\" I asked my dad as I saw Sally put my bag in the bus. Dad looked over at me with a proud smile \"the Jailbird , a C-123K transport prison aircraft\" I looked at him lost I had no clue what he was talking about, seeing the look on my face dad sighed \"the airport had a bomb threat specifically your flight\". Nodding I motioned for him to continue \"So I thought how great would it be for you to go home on the jailbird and make history\" dad smiled like he was winning some kind of prize whilst my mouth was opening and closing like a fish. \"I know it's great isn't it\" I groaned internally I was going on a flight, with inmates, no tv, no music, no stewardesses or toilets \"yeah it's great dad\" Dad smiled at me and then awkwardly pulled me into a hug and kissed the top of my head. \"I'm sorry for everything princess I know I haven't been a great father but I'm trying\" Dad told me rubbing my arms as he pulled away from me, giving dad a fake smile I nodded \"yeah I know I can really tell\" I said sarcastically but dad had already pulled away. \"Have a nice flight sweetie\" nodding I frowned as dad walked away what no happy birthday.. nothing? sally put her hand on my shoulder with a sigh \"You'll be fine come on\" letting her lead me to the bus I sat in the front seat behind the driver and put my head on the window refusing to cry. Sally sat down with a huff \"I'm sorry I know it's hard for you\" coughing a little I clenched my jaw as I tried not to let any tears fall, Sally grabbed my hand \"I just want you to know I'm here… if you want me to be that is\". Looking up I saw Sally's sad face that mirrored my own and I nodded \"I know what it's like to be constantly disappointed by your parents\" I gave Sally a teary smile until another guard walked up the bus steps \"It's time Sally\" Sally nodded and let go of my hand and stood. \"The inmates on this bus are low threat so don't worry\" I nodded and watched as Sally began to direct the inmates to their seats. The bus started in its journey to 'the jailbird' we had to meet the jailbird at the U.S Marshal Headquarters. Sally walked up between the seats \"Hey, lady!\" I turned in my seat seeing a black inmate with a bandana on his head calling Sally she turned with a sigh \"Lady's a dog in a Walt Disney movie. My name is Bishop. Guard Bishop to you\" I smirked at how cool Sally handled herself in front of the inmates just like one of my favourite sayings 'never let them see you sweat'. The bandana wearing inmate spoke up again \"Well, I gotta be gettin' my shot before we go gettin' on some aeroplane, Guard Bishop\" Sally looked through some papers on her clip board \"What's your name?\" she asked looking at the man \"Odell. They didn't give me my shot last night\" Sally nodded as she looked at the clip board and wrote something down. \"Okay, you're diabetic? All right, your insulin's on board. We'll give it to you in flight\" Sally moved away from Odell and to another man \"Cameron Poe\" the man looked up and smiled nicely \"Yes, ma'am\". \"You know you're still under full restraints till you're processed and released from your original prison, understand?\" Cameron nodded happily and smiled \"Yes, ma'am. As long as I make it home on time, it makes no never mind\" Cameron pulled a small picture out his shirt pocket and handed it to Sally \"It's my daughter's birthday\" I stood out of my seat and took the picture from Sally and smiled seeing a little blonde girl \"congratulations\" I muttered handing him back the picture jealous. \"I got locked down three months before she was born. She ain't never seen me\" Cameron told me in his Texan drawl \"And why not?\" Sally asked rolling her eyes in good humour. Cameron smiled \"No way was she gonna meet her daddy in a prison visitor room surrounded by homemade cookies and love-starved murderers\" I smiled at the homemade cookies part. \"Just be there for her now Cameron a girl need her dad in her life, trust me\" I told him seriously as Sally smiled sadly before looking back at Cameron \"What you got here is a walking, talking reason to rehabilitate\" Cameron smiled at Sally before looking over to me as I sat back in my seat \"You got a good daddy too his heart just in the wrong place\" I turned to Cameron expressionless \"It's my birthday too and he didn't remember plus would you leave your young daughter in a prison riot defenceless?\" Cameron shook his head but then smirked \"You weren't completely defenceless I saw some of those moves you busted out\" I threw my head back with a laugh maybe this plane ride wouldn't be so bad.[Chapter 7] After a long drive we stopped at the HQ and I gasped seeing the jailbird sitting there waiting for us and it was huge, I guess I wasn't expecting anything like this. Getting off the bus I stretched a looked around with a hand over the top of my eyes. Seeing someone waving to me I waved back half assed until they ran up to me enthusiastically \"Hey I'm Vince Larkin\" he said holding his hand out for me to shake \"Nikki\" I told him taking his hand as he smiled and nodded \"Yeah I heard about the riot\". Rolling my eyes, I nodded \"of course you did\" Larkin just smiled awkwardly and nodded again \"Yeah well at least your safe now and the Jailbird is top notch you'll be plenty of safe up there\" Nodding I turned and look around seeing all of the police dogs and riot officers. \"So Larkin looks like you're ready for this\" I said making small talk, Larkin nodded and pulled the shades of his eyes \"Yeah well we have to be for the kind of criminals going on this plane\" I looked at him confused and pointed to the bus I was on \"I thought they were low threat?\" Larkin nodded but pointed over to where a huge bus, squad cars, bikes and 4 helicopters suddenly popped up out of nowhere \"Yeah but they're not, they are the worst of the worst\" nodding my mouth suddenly went dry in fear \"…cool\" Larkin looked over his shoulder and waved \"Hey you ok here for a minute I just gotta…\" he stuttered pointing in a different direction I nodded I didn't need a babysitter, watching at the big bus parked next to the school bus like one I was on. I watched as all the swat officers started racing around with their dogs and weapons it was like mayhem I wondered what type of criminals they were transferring. Suddenly Larkin was back and with a few other men \"Nikki this is Duncan Malloy and Chief Devers\" I nodded in greeting and looked back to all the chaos, Larkins radio started up with static \"Foxtrot Charlie, we are ready to disembark. Waiting your go on separatee transfer\" A voice shouted. \"Well, we told you today's flight would be special\" Larkin piped up walking us closer to the huge silver plane \"That's William Bedford aka Billy Bedlam.\" I looked forward to see a tall skinny man walked out of the bus \"The mass murderer?\" Duncan asked in amazement. He was dressed in orange overalls which had separatee written on them, He walked through the path of shotgun armed guards with an emotionless face. \"The same. He caught his wife in bed with another man. Left her alone. Drove four towns over to his wife's family's house. Killed her parents, her brothers, her sisters, even her dog\" Billy picked up his cuffed hands and let Falzon scan the bracelet attached to his wrist, I looked back over to him with wide eyes \"Wow crazy\" Billy lifted his head up and caught sight of us staring and gave us a dirty smirk. \"Who's that?\" Duncan asked pointing back to the bus, I looked back over slowly only to have my heart stop \"Nathan Jones, aka Diamond Dog. Former general of the Black Guerrillas\" I watched as Nathan walked past the same guards except he looked at them with a menacing look before his eyes swept to me. I smiled as they softened before hardening again when he looked back to Falzon \"He blew up a meeting of the National Rifle Association saying and I quote, 'They represented the basest negativity of the white race' He wrote a book in prison called Reflections ln A Diamond Eye. New York Times called it 'A wake-up call for the black community' They're talking to Denzel for the movie\" I smiled hearing about Nathan writing a book an eventually getting a movie made about it that would be good for him \"This one's done it all\" I looked up to see Cyrus in the doorway of the bus staring over at me with a smirk on his face. \"Kidnapping, robbery, murder, extortion\" I frowned as I heard all of Cyrus's crimes listed off was he really that bad? He didn't seem so bad to me. \"His name is Cyrus Grissom aka 'Cyrus the Virus' Thirty-two years old, 17 of them spent in our institutions. But he's bettered himself Air inside. Earned two degrees, including his Juris Doctor\" I perked up at the sound of Cyrus bettering himself. \"but he also killed 11 fellow inmates, incited three riots and escaped twice. Likes to brag that he killed more men than cancer\" I smirked a little now I get that nickname. I watched as one of the guards patted him down and looked for any weapons \"Okay, open wide. Lift your tongue\" Cyrus opened his mouth semi obediently, his eyes rolled over to me as he waggled his tongue making me giggle before stopping myself. \"Cyrus is a poster child for the criminally insane. He's a true product of the system\" I raised an eyebrow at Larkin wondering what he was talking about. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" Duncan roared at Larkin before turning to Chief Devers \"Uh, what is he, one of these sociology majors who thinks we're responsible for breeding these animals?\" \"No, but I could point a few fingers if it would make you feel comfortable\" letting out a burst of laughter I saw Larkin smile at me before I turned to see Cyrus glaring over I our direction. Watching as Cyrus get walked into the plane my nerves began to grow this was going to be a long enough journey without being with loads of criminals. Half watching Falzon check another black inmate I smiled seeing Cameron get out of the bus and relish in being in the sun. \"Hey, who's that guy?\" Chief Devers asks out loud I smiled \"That is Cameron Poe\" Larkin looks over at me impressed \"A parolee hitchin' a ride home. He's a nobody.\" I looked at him unimpressed no wonder criminals have low self-esteem when they're called nobodies. Seeing Sally walk up to us I smile \"Guard Bishop\" Larkin says professionally \"Hey, Larkin\" Sally looked over at me with a smile on her face \"Ready?\" smiling falsely I nodded \"As ready as I'll ever be\" Walking into the plane I gulped nervously seeing all the inmates starting over at me \"Don't worry they're all locked up\" Sally whispered to me softly I just looked at her seriously \"I was told that a week ago and look what happened then\" Looking around I saw the inmate I had roundhouse kicked last week his face was still a bit swollen and black keeping my smile down, I looked at Cyrus as he sat in his cage looking like he was up to no good. Which was mostly all of the time or so I've heard.[Chapter 8] Following Sally with a clipboard I just wrote and crossed out anything she told me I guess if I was going to be here I might as well help \"Well, welcome aboard\" I stopped between Nathan and Cyrus's cells as the airplane took off \"You ok baby girl?\" I looked up to see Nathan looking at me. Nodding silently, I held on his gate as Falzon talked \"My, my. As I look around I see a lot of celebrities among us. I see 11 Current Affairs, two Hard Copies, a genuine Geraldo interviewee and the warden's daughter\" my head shot up at Falzon smirked at me. \"But I got to tell you, none of this impresses me because we have rules on this aircraft, and they're gonna be enforced. It's a lot like kindergarten. You'll keep your hands to yourself Air. You keep the decibel level down. And if any of you should feel the need to scream... spit or bite, you get the treatment. Falzon stopped by an inmate up the font of the plane who glared at him \"Fuck you, pig\" he said spitting on Falzon's shoe \"Gag and bag this Nazi muffin\" Falzon shouted to the other Guards. Falzon elbowed the inmate in the before letting the other officers put duct tape and a cloth bag over the inmate's head \"Hey you can't do that! Some of these convicts are good men\" I shouted to Falzon angrily making everyone look at me. Looking over to a smirking Johnny I grimaced \"Except him he is disgusting\" Johnny's face fell as a few laughs rounded the plane and I'm sure he swore at me in Spanish. I turned around looked at Sally who just smiled and winked at me, holding on to the bars I stayed between Nathan and Cyrus knowing that's where I was safest and comfortable as Falzon carried on with his speech. I watched as Cyrus and Johnny talked to each other in what I was guessing is Spanish before Johnny turned to me and smirked disgustingly \"Call me Johnny 600 if they knew the truth\" I shifted nervously I had never been looked at like prey before. Cyrus looked at me angrily before turning back to Johnny with a serious look \"Ah, doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Anyway, I despise rapists. For me, you're somewhere between a cockroach and that white stuff that accumulates at the corner of your mouth when you're really thirsty. But in your case, I'll make an exception. Cyrus turned to me and winked he was up to something and that wink was to make me feel better but today it didn't help \"Guard Falzon\" Cyrus shouted in his direction \"What?\" Falzon asked as if he knew this was going to be a waste of time. \"Oh, stewardess, stewardess? What's the in-flight movie today?\" I smiled as Cyrus messed with Falzon \"Well, I think you'll like it, Cyrus. It's called I'll Never Make Love To A Woman On The Beach Again. And it's preceded by the award-winning short, No More Steak For Me Ever\" Falzon walked away smiling as Cyrus pretended to laugh \"Funny fucker, aren't ya?\" I watched as Cyrus started to pick at his hand and looking around suspiciously \"What are you up to?\" I whispered to him as he looked up shocked. \"Just you wait\" he told me with another wink making me glare at him \"You better not be doing something dangerous Cyrus\" he looked up at me in thought \"It won't be dangerous for us\" I looked at him surprised at his cryptic answers and shook my head sighing. Sally came down after hear checks and stood by me. \"Hope this goes smoothly. All those monsters on one plane\" Ginny said looking up at the plane that was slowly getting higher in the air. Larkin turned to Ginny with a frown \"Please, Ginny, this is a well-oiled machine\" he said with confidence as his girlfriend bit her lip nervously \"Yeah but that poor girl is up there with them\" Larkin nodded in agreement he didn't think it was a good idea for Nikki to be up there but it wasn't his call. \"The only thing we gotta worry about is stale peanuts and a little turbulence\" he hoped… \"Close forward gate\" Sally shouted and grabbed my arm pulling me with her to the back of the plane \"Close middle gate\" the gate closed and beeped as it locked shut. Leaning against the gate I looked around when I heard a quiet choking sound I looked over to see 'pinball' or so that's what he said his name was with his fingers down his throat. I watched as he pulled something out of his mouth and he turned to me and put his finger on his lips in a shh motion. Looking around to see if anyone else was seeing this I noticed Cameron was watching him too. \"Come on, I need my shot!\" Odell started shouting impatiently a guard came forward with a box \"Coming. I'm coming. Left arm.\" The guard said kneeled in front of Cameron and Odell. Suddenly the inmate next to pinball started screaming my eyes widen when I noticed he was on fire \"Get the extinguisher\" Sally shouted grabbing pinball out of his chair. \"Open the middle gate\" Sally shouted over all of the screaming as she grabbed the phone on the wall \"The Last Mohican is burnin', man! Shit. Did you see that motherfucker, man? He spontaneously combusted. He's a fuckin' witch doctor, man. I seen that shit on Discovery Channel\" Pinball shouted from the back of the plane. \"Code red! Code red!\" I stood by her side as she shouted on the phone to the pilot \"Chantin' and shit. Fire in the rear cabin\" Rolling my eyes all I could hear was pinballs shouting. Hearing a buzz noise, I looked at pinball to see him opening the gates \"Hey!\" I shouted jumping on him \"Ahh she's got me!\" he shouted spinning us around as Sally tried hitting him with her baton. Alarms bells and lights started to ring out it reminded me of the riot a week ago, feeling my grip loosen Pinball threw me into the wall and punched Sally. Looking up holding my head I saw Nathan grab a guard and puncture his neck with the open part of his hand cuff \"Nathan no!\" I shouted making Sally look at me in shock before going back to pinball. \"Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey\" I heard Cyrus shouting as he banged on his cell \"Pinball, go! Pull the lever. Go! Go!\" looking between Cyrus running up to the cockpit and Nathan dropping the dead guard I felt like I couldn't breathe. \"Holy shit! Hold on, Bobby! Gimme a Taser!\" I looked over to see Guard Falzon tazering Nathan making his eyes roll into the back of his head, before he dropped to the floor too. Dropping down into the corner I put my hands on my ears and closed my eyes hoping it would go away until I screamed hearing gunshots. \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking\" I looked up to see Cyrus on top of the walkway smirking \"I have the only gun on board\" he waved the gun around before looking into my eyes seriously \"Welcome to Con Air\"[Chapter 9] Sitting with my arms wrapped around my legs I watched as a convict pulled Sally up and chained her to the side of the cage Nathan was in. I turned as Cyrus suddenly knelt by me before looking back at Sally who was now watching us in interest as we a lot of the other occupants of the plane. Cyrus moved his hand forward to touch my hair but I quickly moved my head in defiance, he sighed and put his hand back \"I did this for us you'll see\" grabbing my hands in his he pulled out some hands cuffs making me squirm trying to get away. Cyrus pulled me to him so my back was in his chest and pulled my hands together again he was far too strong for me to fight off \"Hey get off her!\" I heard Sally shout from behind us, I cried out when I felt the cold metal lock around my wrists. Cyrus put his head on mine and held me tight so I couldn't fight any more \"Shh shh\" I felt him breath in my ear \"Come on\" Cyrus pulled me up and sat me on one of the unoccupied chairs before walking away to talk to another one of the convicts in a cage. Trying to get comfortable I turned to look at Sally only to see her being pulled around by Johnny \"Hey\" I shouted making him turn as I kicked him like I did back in the prison. Standing myself in front of her I tried to look as fearless as possible. Johnny stood up with a hand on his chin where I had kicked and pushed me up against Sally \"Now you're gonna make me hurt you\" Johnny growled at me before being pulled back off me \"What you doin'?\" Johnny shouted at Cameron who was looking very pissed. \"I can't allow that\" Cameron looked behind Johnny as me and Sally \"You ok?\" we nodded fast before Johnny turned to Cameron in shock \"You know what I am?\" Cameron looked back at Johnny with a smirk \"Ugly all day\" Johnny ran at Cameron with his fist held high before Cameron blocked it and punched Johnny to the floor \"This ain't happenin', not here, not now\" Johnny growled before looking at me and Sally whom I was still protecting \"Oh, it's happenin'\" \"Hey!\" relief flooded me as an angry look Cyrus walked towards us \"He's right. Not here and not now and especially not to her\" Cyrus growled as he pulled me forward and held me in front of an angry Johnny. \"Do you fly, Johnny?\" Cyrus asked Johnny coolly as he gripped me tighter \"No\" Cyrus nodded and stepped towards Johnny dangerously \"You keep that in mind when you look at her because if your dick jumps out of your pants you jump out of this plane\" Johnny looked at me fearfully before nodding and moving away from us \"Do you all understand that?\" Cyrus turned us around so I could see everyone nodding in fear of what Cyrus might do to them. Pulling me towards Falzon I let out a shaky breath \"Never let them see you sweat\" Cyrus whispered to me \"They can smell fear a mile away\" Cyrus pulled out his gun and pointed it a Falzon with his other arm still wrapped around my waist tightly \"What are the numbers in Carson City? How many on, how many off?\" Falzon who was chained up with a broken nose sighed \"Six off and ten on\" Cyrus turned to pinball \"Find the six\" Cyrus turned back to Falzon \"Anything else?\" Falzon turned to me and gasped breath \"We have orders that she has to get off at every stop so they can see she's ok\" Cyrus nodded and pulled me back down to where Sally was chained up and sat me back down \"Be good\" he told me with a twinkle in his eye, nodding I watched as he unchained Sally and walked her up to the front. \"You think you're free? You're not\" We all looked up at Nathan stood on top of the walkway by the cockpit \"Now, listen up. Forty to 50 U.S. prison guards armed with shotguns are waitin' for us at the next stop. Now, if you do exactly what we tell ya the rest of our lives will be a vacation in a non-extradition country\" \"I'm talkin' sandy beaches, umbrella drinks... and dirty, naked freaks. It'll be a paid motherfuckin' vacation\" most of the convicts whooped and cheered, I looked up so see Nathan and Cyrus talking to the other seperatee Billy. \"Everybody freeze. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, Cyrus. No, no. Get that ass out here right now!\" I screamed as I was picked up and used as a hostage I groaned when I realised my hands were still handcuffed together. \"With you in a second\" Cyrus called from his hiding spot in the front of the plane. The man put the gun to my head roughly \"Right now!\" Cameron walked forward and put his hands up \"Keep cool, boss. You know you're in a situation You can't control, right?\" he said slowly whist looking at me in distress. The man laughed manically \"I can't control it? Shut up\" he shouted at Cameron as he pulled me closer to him as he started to shake \"Who the fuck are you?\" Pinball shouted next to me with his hands up \"I'm DEA. That's who the fuck I am\" Cyrus stood up with Sally cuffed in front of him as a human shield \"Now you were saying?\" I saw Cyrus' gun pointed over in our direction and shivered \"Oh, that's very clever, Cyrus. So you think I give a shit about that little bitch guard you have there right now?\" I groaned when the DEA agent pushed the gun harder to my head. \"Well, maybe you didn't hear what I said. I'm DEA. You know what the fuck that means?\" He screamed again shaking more as time passed \"Y-You the most crooked nigger on this plane\" Pinball shouted from the side-lines again. \"You're DEA? What are you doin' on this flight? Won't they fly you boys commercially?\" Cyrus taunted as he slowly got closer \"Don't push me, Cyrus, man. I swear to God; I'll blow away your little girlfriend right now\" my eyes widened as I started squirm trying to get away. Cyrus looked at me meaningfully with a little nod before looking back at the DEA agent \"You know, the next time you choose a human shield you're better off not pickin' someone who's mine\" flinging my head back I heard a crack as my head connected with his nose and then a gun shot. Dropping to the floor I quickly picked up the gun the DEA had dropped when Cyrus shot him and held it to my chest. Cyrus chained Sally to the cage up front before walking back and looked at Cameron \"What's your name, convict?\" Cameron looked up at Cyrus as he walked over in my direction and picking me up to stand \"My name?\" Cameron asked slowly seeming in shock of what just happened \"Yeah\" Cyrus nodded holding me to him \"Poe\" Cyrus nodded and we started to walk away \"Nice work, Poe. Truly nice work\" sitting me down in a seat next to Nathan, Cyrus bent down and tapped my cheek \"Sweetheart. You there\" shaking I gripped the gun tighter and looked down at it. Cyrus followed my line of sight and saw a gun in my shaking hands \"Give me the gun princess\" Cyrus asked putting his hand out, looking up I looked at Cyrus blankly \"Give me the gun Nicole\" he barked sighing I looked up to see Sally shaking her head, sighing I put the gun in his outstretched hand. \"I'm not yours\" I mumbled bringing my knees up to myself and looking out of the window and seeing the sky had turned a dark shade of blue. Cyrus laughed and put his hand under my chin \"You've been mine since I first saw you all those 12 years ago\" Hearing Sally gasp I looked at her and she looked back at me sadly, Cyrus stood up and walked away leaving me and Nathan sat on the chairs together \"You know we'll never hurt you right?\" nodding I just sat silently wanting to be alone. A few minutes later Cyrus walks back over to me and sits down \"Happy 18th Birthday\" looking over to him I saw he had a cookie in his hand, sighing with a small smile I reached over and took the cookie. \"How did you know?\" Cyrus just smiled at me mischievously \"I have my ways\" Sighing I ate my cookie in silence as Cyrus walked away. What a way to spend your birthday…[Chapter 10] \"So you've known Cyrus the Virus for 12 years\" Sally asked me in a weirdly calm voice; looking over to where she was standing with her hands changed up on the gate I nodded as I leaned on the gate next to her. \"Yeah since I was about 5, I thought they were so cool\" I said with a small smile, Sally looked at me confused \"them?\" nodding I looked over to where Cyrus and Nathan were stood \"Yeah them. \" Sally sighed before looking back at me \"So how did you meet?\" smiling I brushed away my hair that had fallen out of my ponytail \"I was running away from my dad's office and wound up outside Cyrus' cell\" biting my lip I laughed \"I went to see him every week after that, he made me laugh and read to me for hours\" Sally just listened to me and nodded \"I always made him homemade cookies\" we both fell into silence before I looked back up to a frowning Sally \"They saved my life last week\" I whispered to her, her eyebrows shot up in surprise \"the riot?\" Nodding I wrapped my arms around myself. Looking at the woman I had come to trust I frowned when she was looking at me seriously \"What?\" Sally leaned into me \"You need to stop\" she said in hushed towns making me frown even more \"Can't you see what he's doing to you, it's not real sweetie\" Shaking my head I backed away from sally. \"No he cares about me more than my own family ever will\" I cried out to her gaining attention of the man we were arguing about \"That's what he wants you to think, he's a murderer he can't show feelings Nicole!\" \"Nicole?\" turning around I saw Cyrus, Nathan and Billy looking between me and Sally who gulped in fear \"You ok baby girl?\" looking at Sally I just nodded I didn't want her to get hurt. Cyrus lead me over to the walkway and put me between him and the wall away from Nathan and Billy. \"What did she say to get you all upset sweetheart?\" Cyrus asked me making me look behind him to Sally who was struggling to see us behind the steps \"Nicole\" Cyrus called me sternly \"She told me…\" I looked at Cyrus dubiously before sighing \"That you didn't care about me, that you couldn't have feelings because you're a murderer\" Cyrus laughed before reaching for his gun, panicking I grabbed his hand \"Don't please\" Cyrus looked at me and nodded slowly before grabbing my face in his hands \"you're too good for this world\" he muttered stroking his thumb against my cheek. Smiling a part of me loved the feeling of his hands on my face whereas the rational part of me knew he was a murderer. My heart quickened as Cyrus leaned down and place a kiss of my jaw bone before pulling us back over to Nathan and Billy. \"Feel better baby girl?\" nodding I smiled at little Nathan was always so protective \"Don't worry about what people say about you, your special girl\" leaning my head again Nathan's strong arms I smiled he was right these two had always protected me when my own family hadn't. \"Hey, Cyrus, l, uh, I got some good news and I got some bad news\" we all looked up at a nervous looking pinball \"Yeah, what's the good news?\" Cyrus asked crossing his arms over my shoulders and around my neck loosely. I was confused at these sudden shows of affection especially in front of people but it still gave me odd butterflies in my stomach sure I thought he was handsome and had a crush on him growing up but who wouldn't?. \"Well, the good news is I found Benson, Carls and Popovitch\" Pinball said sweating as Cyrus looked at him \"What's the bad news?\" Pinball scratched the back of his neck. \"The bad news is this dead fellow right here happens to be Benson\" walking toward us \"This Aryan fellow with the bullet hole in his forehead is, is Carls\" Pinball put his hand on Carls bloody head before wiping his hand on his shirt. \"and, and this honky he's draggin' in is Popovitch\" we looked over to see a convict dragging a dead convict behind him. \"I don't know how to tell you this, Cyrus, but we are three white guys short or as they say in ebonics, we be fucked.\" Cyrus sighed and rubbed his face \"Listen, Carson City is expecting six men to get off this plane and we're gonna give 'em exactly what they expect\" Cyrus moved away from me and walked down the plane \"So I need three volunteers\" Cyrus looked over to Billy who laughed \"Don't look at me, pal. I'm servin' eight consecutive life sentences. I am not getting off this plane\" he told us smirking. An old man put his hand up in the air \"Hey, I'll go. I'm too old for his shit\" he said making me giggle \"Go ahead, go to the back\" Cyrus told him pointing to the back of the plane \"Anybody else?\" he asked impatiently. Odell put his hand up and grabbed Cameron's shoulder \"Hey, right here, man. Us two\" Cyrus nodded pointed to the back of the plane again \"Great, go ahead. Go to the back\" Cyrus suddenly turned back to look at Odell and Cameron \"Hey, whoa, stop. The guys they're expecting are white. That puts you shit out of luck\" he said point to Odell who looked very upset \"Hey, come on, man\" he protested to Cyrus who looked like he could care less \"I'll tell you what. Sit down. One of my associates will bring you a phone book, and you call the Affirmative Action office\" Turing to another convict with his hand in the air Cyrus pointed to him \"You, go ahead\" I watched as Odell turned to Cameron upset and then Cameron whispered something and fist bumped Odell. \"We need another white boy to volunteer\" Nathan called out from his position on top of the walkway but the cockpit \"Pilot's white\" Cyrus told him with a straight face. \"Wait, wait, wait. The pilot?\" Billy asked surprised and put his hand up \"Who's gonna fly the plane?\" Cyrus smirked and walked up the walkway stairs to the cockpit \"Relax, Billy. Welcome to the machine\". -San Quentin Prison- 2 guards walked up to the door of a cell \"Vacant cell D8, ready for inspection\" the bigger officer whose badge read 'Garner' said opening the door \"Last tenant, Cyrus Grissom\" The other officer, Renfro, sat on the bed and watched Garner inspect the room \"Got scratches on the wall\" Garner said noting down the markings on his clip board. \"Probably a weapon sharpening\" Renfro muttered chewing on his toothpick \"What about the loose shelf screw?\" \"What the hell is this?\" Garner walked by the metal toilet and looked on the floor \"Looks like cocaine\" he said letting the grains fall from his fingers. \"What, do you got something there?\" Renfro called now interested in what his fellow officer had found, Garner began to pick at the soft spot on the otherwise brick wall \"I don't know. It's all soft\" Walking to the back of the plane I watched as Pinball started to cut the wrist tags off the other convicts \"What about the rest of the pigs?\" turning my head around I saw Cyrus walked up behind us. \"Be patient, now. They haven't ceased to be useful yet\" Cyrus told Nathan in a relaxed voice he wasn't worried about any of this at all and his voice showed it. I flinched when Pinball used the taser to melt the plastic tags together on the old man's wrists \"Okay, old man. Now you're Mr Popovitch\" Pinball told the man as Johnny 23 put tape and a cloth mask over his head. \"Gentlemen, you'll reach the Nevada pen in about two hours. The tape's just a little precaution in case any of you are rocked by the sudden impulse to squeal like a pig. Not that we don't trust you. But let's face it, your criminals\" Cyrus told the men who were all lined up together on their knees. Pinball held a piece of tape over Cameron's head who never looked up \"Come on, man, move your head up\" Pinball told him but Cameron only looked behind him \"I want to stay on\" \"What?\" Pinball asked shocked as he looked down at Cameron who was now looking up at Cyrus \"I changed my mind\" Pinball looked over to us \"So, Cyrus, we got a little mind-changer\" \"I got 15 years left, and I know I'd just hate myself if I thought I blew my one shot at a naked party freak and an umbrella drink\" Cameron said looking straight up at Cyrus before looking at me nervous knowing I knew he was a free man. \"You got 15 years? Boy, a second ago you couldn't wait to get off this plane\" Cyrus said looking at Cameron almost suspiciously as Cameron looked back at the floor \"I know. Fear of freedom, I guess\" Cyrus thought for a minute before nodding \"Get him up. Get the cuffs off him. Pick out a guard, and then put that dead cop's prison issues on him\" Watching Cameron walk back over to Odell and Sally I frowned and wondered what he was up to especially when he turned back to me and nodded a little.[Chapter 11] -San Quentin Prison- Vince Larkin- Larkin half watched the screen as the guards were clearing out a cell and tried to do his paperwork but his mind wasn't on work his mind was with his plane, sighing he looked up at monitor again and frowned seeing the guard lay on the floor with a flash light. He watched as Garner reached into the wall and pulled out all sorts of things and handing them to Renfro. Watching as the two guards started to pull out more things Larkin got confused \"Chief? I got a lot of weird shit down here\" Garner said through the radio. \"What is it?\" the chief asked back watching the monitor with Larkin \"This looks like the drawing of a plane\" Garner said holding up a large drawing to the camera. \"Whose cell is that?\" Larkin asked the chief who turned to him seriously \"The Virus\". Larkin got up and quickly made his way down to Cyrus Grissom cell and opened the door seeing Garner and Renfro stood looking at the papers and other things. Larkin's eyes roamed over all the things they had pulled out of the wall and exhaled what was the Virus up to this time? |The Jailbird| I stood next to Sally quietly as Cyrus and some of the other convicts put on coats and googles \"You need to get us help\" Sally whispered to me I told her about me having to check in with the guards when we stop. Looking down I heard Sally sigh \"I'm sorry for what I said Nikki but you need to do the right thing\" I lifted my head up and looked at Sally \"He will kill us all when he no longer needs us\" Nodding sadly I jumped when Cyrus suddenly appeared in front of us. He pulled me with him to where the other convicts were ready looking like prison guards and put a set of goggles over my eyes before taking the keys from his belt \"No talking just smile and nod\" he said uncuffing my hands. \"Ok?\" he asked bending down to my eye level \"Nicole\" he said in a warning tone again which he seems to do every time we talk. Nodding I looked back at Sally before Cyrus guided me out of the plane. Watching as the fake prison guards pulled the fake inmates out of the plane and handed them to the real guards kicking and screaming \"Heard you had a problem up there\" A scrawny looking Marshall asked as he helped with the fake convicts. Cyrus pulled down the bandanna covering his mouth \"Had to bag 'em and gag 'em. Rough crew spitters and shitters.\" I watched as Falzon and the pilot tried to fight their way from the bus \"On the bus, Get on the bus!\" A guard shouted roughing them up as Cyrus smirked to himself. -San Quentin Prison Cell D8- Larkin sat on the bed looking thought the books and blue prints of his plane \"You gotta be kiddin' me. Oh, boy\" Larkin picked up an official looking letter \"In Spanish from Bogota, Colombia. Looks like it's from a law firm. Orange and black\" \"Creepy\" Larkin looked over to see Renfro holding two pictures in his hands \"The eyes are cut out of their heads\" Larkin took the two pictures Renfro had \"The Last Supper\" he muttered to himself holding the pictures in the air. -The Jailbird- After loading up the convicts we stood in front of the plane, Cyrus now had a subtle but tight grip on my arm so I couldn't run or move. \"Is that it?\" Cyrus asked looking at the weedy Marshall's clipboard. \"One more. Late addition\" the Marshall told Cyrus with a cloth over his mouth, Cyrus looked confused \"Who?\" the guard removed the cloth and showed us the clipboard \"Garland Greene\" My eyes widened in fear and I looked at Cyrus who just smirked \"Should be interesting\" We all watched a riot van pulled up next to the bus and the guards all ran out with guns and metal sticks. Watching as they opened the doors I gasped as I saw Garland Greene being dragged out he had a face mask on and his arms strapped together with a vest. \"What the fuck is that?\" Johnny asked in shock looking at the deranged man being pulled toward us \"That is Garland Greene\" I muttered to him, this man had done evil things to girls my age and now I was official scared. -San Quentin Prison Cell D8- Larkin laid the last supper pictures over the Spanish letter hoping to find some clues or answers \"Met ca- Me-Me. Et cetera. Cetera. Meet.\" Garner and Renfro walked back into the room when Larkin started shouting. \"Me, et cetera, me arson\" Larkin wrote down all the letters he found on his notepad \"Meet car. Meet cars. Meet cars. Meet cars. Meet cars. Meet cars. Where?\" Putting the other picture on the Spanish letter his stomach clenched \"Carson City. Oh, God. Uh, stay here, Don't touch anything\" Larkin got up and put the papers back on the bed \"Wait Larkin\" Garner shouted as he held some papers on his hand. Larkin stopped and looked over to the unusually quiet guard \"yeah?\" Garner sighed and handed Larkin the papers with a straight face, Larkin's stomach dropped instantly. He flipped through the children's drawings and finger paintings, Cyrus Grissom didn't have any family members or children as far as he knew. Larkin was confused until he stumbled upon pictures of a small blonde child turning the photos over Larkin sighed. Each photograph was marked with an age and a name 'Nicole Thomas' Cyrus had been watching the warden's daughter for some time now \"Whose she?\" Renfro asked as Larkin rubbed his face. \"The warden's daughter. Don't touch a thing\" Larkin said grabbing Nicole's pictures and paintings before running off down the hall. Stopping at sound of Garner's voice \"Hey, what're you doin'? Just leave it alone. He told you not to touch anything\". Turning around Larkin jumped to the floor seeing a bright light and an explosion come from Cyrus's cell looking up Larkin gulped seeing a fragment of the metal door stuck into the wall above him. -The JailBird- I watched as the prison bus stopped and my heart started to hammer against my chest before it pulled away again, I failed Sally \"You did good sweetheart\" Cyrus said stroking my hair I looked at him feeling hurt\"Whatever\". I looked over nervously as the Marshall got back out of his car walking towards us, Cyrus nudged me forward with him whist he put his gun behind his back \"I uh forgot to ask about Miss Thomas...\" the Marshall asked me I smiled nervously as Cyrus looked at me. \"Almost ready?\" The Marshall asked Cyrus who still had his gun tucked behind his back \"Won't be long now\" Cyrus told him with a straight face as Cyrus turned to look over the Marshall's shoulder I mouthed 'Help Me' The Marshall's eyes widened significantly. Hearing sirens behind him the Marshall drew his gun but wasn't as fast as Cyrus who shot the Marshall in the forehead screaming I pushed away from Cyrus and broke out into a run. Feeling myself being grabbed and picked up I screamed and hit Cyrus's back as he threw me over his shoulder running back to the plane \"You're the man, Cyrus!\" A happy voice shouted behind us \"Let's go!\" Cyrus shouted. Pulling open the cage door Cyrus place me in the cage before shutting the door with me screaming and banging on the cage \"Be a good girl and I think of letting you back out\". As the plane took I fell into the back of the cage as Sally hit the side of my cage grunting. Everything was silent as we were back in the air \"You did everything you could\" Sally whispered to me as tear silently fell onto my cheeks. Nodding I just curled into myself and leaned my head on the wall, how can he be such a monster and my hero all in one person?[Chapter 12] It had been an hour since we landed at Carson City and Cyrus had shot that Air Marshall in the forehead and locked me in this stupid cage, I had run out of tears to cry 30 minutes ago and now I was just sat her staring into nothingness. Hearing my cage open I looked to see Cyrus as he squatted in front of me \"You tried to run away from me\" he stated as I looked at anything but at him as I nodded sadly \"You killed him, right in front of me\". He sighed and rubbed his chin before holding my hand in his showing how dainty my hand looked in overworked hands \"I told you that you're always safe with me\" Cyrus looked up unimpressed as Sally snorted in disbelief before she looked away with fear in her eyes \"Come on\" Cyrus grabbed me by the top of my arm and pulled me out of the cage. \"Hey you leave her alone\" Sally shouted as Cyrus pulled me passed her, stopping dead Cyrus stalked back to Sally and pull a gun to her \"Cyrus...\" I began but he put his hand up to me \"The only reason you are alive is because she asked me not to kill you, so don't make me break my promise to her. Got it?\" Sally nodded quickly as she looked over to me in shock. Cyrus walked back over to me and grabbed my arm again, walking up to the cockpit Cyrus pushed the door open pulling me into the cockpit with him and sat me down on a chair with him \"Hey baby girl you ok?\" I nodded seeing Nathan looked at me with concerned eyes \"I know this is a change for you but it'll get better\" he said smiling at me. Nodding I sat back as I saw Nathan give Cyrus a worried look no doubt about me, Cyrus pulled me closer to him so we could both sit on the chair comfortably. \"Don't they have a way of tracking these planes?\" I asked Cyrus as I wrapped my arms around myself \"Oh, yeah. It's called a transponder. Every plane's got one\" The redneck looking guy said over his shoulder to me. Cyrus looked at me suspiciously before smirking as Nathan leaned forward \"Swamp where is the transponder?\" Cyrus pulled me forward to see the empty hole where the transponder should be before whispering in my ear tauntingly \"Where indeed?\". -U.S Marshall Service. Chief Devers Office- Warden Thomas Monroe opened the doors to the U.S Marshall Service building a Vince Larkin had contacted him about the Jailbird flight and it was of great importance. \"We're following the transponder. We know exactly where they're heading\" Thomas heard from inside Chief Devers office. Knocking on the open door Thomas put on his boss man stance as he eyed the two men in the room one of whom he already knew, turning to younger man he stuck his hand out \"Thomas Monroe, you must be Vince Larkin\" Vince nodded his head as he shook Thomas's hand \"That's right\" Thomas turned to Devers and nodded \"Chief Devers\" sitting down in one of the chairs Thomas coughed a little. \"So boys what's so important I had to come here?\" Thomas asked looking at the two men Vince cleared his throat \"Uh sir I have just come from searching Cyrus Grissom's cell in your prison\" Thomas nodded and looked at the men confused. Before Thomas could open his mouth Vince handed him a picture of a young blonde girl \"Is this your daughter Nicole?\" Thomas looked the pictures in front of him and nodded \"Yes\" Vince sighed and closed his eyes \"What's this about Vince\" Thomas shouted sitting up straight in his chair, Vince handed him some children's drawings, letters to and from Cyrus \"We found all of these items in Cyrus Grissom's cell\" Thomas looked through the drawings his daughter had lovingly drawn for the psychotic murderer and wondered how she'd ever met him \"they all date back to when Nicole would have been around 5-ish?\" Vince told Thomas. \"little Red…\" Thomas muttered causing Vince and Devers to look at each other confused \"it was Nicole's favourite story... It's also what he started to call her around me\" Vince nodded and put his hands together in his lap \"We believe that he formed a bond with her then it grew into an obsession\" Thomas looked up at Vince shocked \"romantic or platonic?\" Vince bit the inside of his lip \"We believe it has turned romantic from what a guard recollected and how he's been treating her on the plane\" Thomas inhaled sharply \"And I led her straight to him. My baby.\" Thomas suddenly looked up \"It was him\" Devers looked at Thomas confused \"I'm sorry?\" Thomas rubbed his face and pace \"A bomb threat was made the day of Nicole's flight, the specific plane she was going on that's why I put her on the Jailbird\" Vince looked at the elder man sympathetically before a loud bang and a voice shouted out \"What the fuck happened? What about Sims? What happened to Sims?\" Thomas looked up to see a man stomping around the office looking at Vince and Devers. \"Duncan, they killed him\" Devers said to the angry man making his face drop dramatically as he looked at Vince \"They got the plane\" he muttered looking at the now speechless man. Duncan leaned against a wall in anger and shock \"Tell me, Skip, what kind of a Keystone Cops operation are you guys runnin' here, huh?\" Duncan shouted at Devers before pointing a finger in Vince's direction. \"And you! You, you little shit. You got my agent killed!\" Vince stood up angrily as him and Duncan stood face to face \"Hey, he brought a gun on the plane\" Duncan laughed with no humor \"If I knew the way you guys run things, I would've told him bring a fuckin' uzi on board!\" \"No one carries on these flights! No one! He brought a gun on board and he got himself killed and in doing so, he compromised the safety of my men!\" Vince shouted furiously making Duncan move himself closer to Vince his face getting redder by the second. \"Your men are incompetent! They let themselves get taken over by a bunch of thugs in chains and cages!\" Duncan bellowed red faced, Vince moved away laughing humourlessly \"I'm not gonna stand around and listen to this shit!\" He roared pointing at Duncan. Thomas watched as the two argued back and forth until Devers pushed them apart \"Guys, guys. Let's work it out\" the two arguing men sighed before moving to different sides of the room \"Okay. Okay\". \"So, uh, what do we do now? What's the plan? You, uh, you-you-you do have a plan, don't you?\" Duncan asked looking at everyone in the room, Vince looked up remorsefully \"We're workin' on it. Contingency plans for something like this don't exist. The situation's never been contemplated\". Duncan got riled up again \"Well, you better start contemplating. 'cause this is a situation that needs to get unfucked right now!\" Thomas looked over to the men his face white with shock \"Will someone please get my daughter away from that madman now!\" all eyes turned to Thomas as Duncan raised his eyebrow \"Who the hell are you?\"[Chapter 13] Standing in front of Garland's cell I shivered as he looked up at us calmly \"What do you want to do with him?\" Nathan asked Cyrus who were both now wearing prison officer uniforms \"I don't know\" Cyrus said with his arms crossed. \"But this is no way to treat a national treasure. Let him out\" I looked up at Cyrus shocked as did Nathan \"You sure?\" Nathan asked in a surprised voice, Cyrus just nodded his head and leaned closer to Garland \"Love your work\" Putting an arm around my shoulder and Cyrus led us to the cockpit where he sat me down in the same chair as before and sat next to me with a sigh, This is the first time we had ever been alone well other than Swamp Thing, the redneck. \"I want to go home\" I whispered looking at my hands as Cyrus looked over in my direction and put his hand under my chin \"I'm your home now, it's me and you. It always has been\" feeling Cyrus rub my chin with his thumb I knew he was right. Cyrus turned and picked up some papers, we both sat in silence something I hadn't done in a long time and it felt nice. I was beginning to see the truth in the things Cyrus was saying, yawing in fatigue I leaned my head on Cyrus's shoulder. Cyrus looked at me in shock before placing a soft kiss on my forehead before looking back at his paperwork, the door opening caught my attention before Nathan and Cindino walked in \"Pinball didn't make it\" Nathan told us as he and Cindino sat down. Cyrus looked at Nathan indifferent \"No?That's too bad. I liked Pinball\" Cyrus drawled out sarcastically I looked up confused \"Whose pinball?\" Cyrus and Nathan laughed \"The one whose back you jumped on baby girl\" nodding I blushed they had saw me jump on him \"And he screamed like a damn girl\" Nathan laughed smacking his leg. Smiling at them I jumped when the door was knocked on and opened \"What do you want?\" Nathan shouted at Cameron aggressively \"I wanna know what the plan is\" Cameron said looking at us just as untrusting as we were at him. \"Why you care?\" Nathan shouted suspiciously, Cameron frowned at Nathan before looking back at Cyrus \"I got just as much ridin' on this as you. We're all convicts here\" I looked around mildly offended \"I'm not\". \"Cyrus Grissom, do you copy? Cyrus Grissom, do you copy?\" I gasped and whispered \"Vince\" I saw Cyrus glaring at the radio out of the corner of my eye \"Yes, I copy. Identify yourself.\" Cyrus called looking at me seriously. \"This is United States Marshal Vince Larkin and Duncan Malloy of the DEA\" Cyrus smirked bringing the radio back up to his lips \"Oh, Agent Malloy. I'm so sorry about your associate. Nothing is quite as sad as seeing a grown man pissing his pants\" All the men in the cabin let out a laugh as we heard Duncan and Vince fight for the radio \"Listen, Grissom, you puny, fucking animal When I get through with you, you'll be beggin' 'em for the electric chair\" Cyrus visibly shook with laughter before stopping himself. \"Hey, I don't like him\" he shouted making me jump \"If he speaks again, this conversation is terminated\" looking over at Cyrus I smiled at how in charge he was acting before shaking myself internally what was happening to me? \"He doesn't want to talk again. Really. He's done talking. He's leaving the building, okay?\" Vince's voice rang out calmly \"Good, then I'll talk to you. Here are the rules. First I ask a question, then you ask a question\" Cyrus said authoritatively. \"Okay. What's your question?\" Vince said in an agonized voice like he didn't want to play this game with Cyrus \"In Carson City, your bulls were onto us. How?\" Cyrus asked Vince curiously as my eyes shot up to Cameron who just looked back at me. \"One of the guards..\" Duncan shouted out before groaning \"One of the guards faked a heart attack and we had to remove his restraints, All right?\" Vince shouted again like he and Duncan were fighting for control. Cyrus nodded with a dubious look \"I see. And what's your question?\" I heard Vince take a deep breath \"Do you still have Nicole?\" my head shook up and Cyrus again gave a glare before lifting up the radio \"Yes, why don't you say hello to your old friend sweetheart?\" I looked at Cyrus who had a look on his face I couldn't place. \"Vince?\" I heard Vince sigh in relief \"God Nicole, are you ok has he hurt you?\" Cyrus quickly pulled the radio away from me and I screamed a little in shock \"Nicole?\" Vince shouted obviously hearing my scream. \"I think that's enough now before you have to learn not to take what's mine like your associate DEA\" Cyrus growled into the radio I now realized the look he had was jealousy, was he jealous of me talking to Vince?. \"Where you goin' with Nicole and my plane, Cyrus?\" Vince demanded loosing his cool by the minute \"We're going to Disneyland\" Cyrus told Vince in a terrifying calm voice \"You're lying, Cyrus\" \"So are you, Vince\" Cyrus argued back before laughing \"Oh, nothin' Makes me sadder than the agent lost his bladder in the Aeroplane\" Cyrus sang into the radio before smirking as he heard Vince shout before the radio went quiet. \"Lerner Airfield, Poe. Middle of nowhere\" Cyrus told Cameron who was still waiting at the door as he point to a place on the map he had \"That's our rendezvous point. Forty-nine minutes from anything resembling authority. So, now you know\" Cyrus told Cameron before slamming the door in his face. Yawning again I curled myself again Cyrus watching him continue to write on the papers and talk to Nathan before my eyes closed and quickly opened again when I heard moving around and saw Nathan walking out of the door. \"Go to sleep\" I looked up to see Cyrus smirking at me obviously seeing my tired eyes \"I'll still be here\" nodding I brought my legs under myself as I lay against the man who had simultaneously saved and ruined my life. Cameron stood by the cages deep in thought \" Yee-ha!\" he looked up to see Cyrus's lackey Nathan walking to him \"What's on your mind, hillbilly?\" Cameron internally rolled his eyes in annoyance. \"What was I thinking about?\" Cameron pretended to think to himself before looking back at Nathan \"Oh, yeah. Yee-ha. That's right\" Nathan just smiled back at Cameron oblivious to Cameron's sarcasm \"I was just wonderin' what a black militant, uh, that would be you was doin' takin' orders from a white boy on a power trip. Don't you think that's strange?\". Nathan smiled deviously at Cameron \"It's a means to an end, my white friend. I's can play house nigger til's we get to where we're goin'. And then, the day of the dog begins.\" Nathan mockingly brought his hand up to his mouth before putting a finger on his lips \"Shh!\" Cameron looked at Nathan seriously \"And what about Nicole? Where does she fit into this?\" Cameron was shocked when he saw Nathan's eyes cloud with anger when Cameron said her name he was obviously very protective of the young girl. \"Baby girl has nothing to do with this and you would be wise to keep it that way boy, you understand?\" Cameron nodded as Nathan walked away and he realized that Sally was right Nicole needed his help but would she want it? A/N: So how do you guys think I should end this story? I've had messages saying things like make Nicole turn bad, have Nicole kill Cameron and let Cyrus and Nicole get away in all honesty I had an ending planned out but now I think it might be anticlimactic. So should I: A. Kill Nicole and Cyrus off B. Let Nicole save Cyrus' life but die. C. Make Nicole turn bad? D. Let Nicole and Cyrus get away together? E. Something else? Message me with you're favorite ending, most votes win :D[Chapter 14] -U.S Marshall Service. Chief Devers Office- Vince Larkin walked in Chief Devers office rapidly throwing down some files on the chief's desk \"Here's the jacket on Cameron Poe. His wife's on the way here now. U.S. Ranger, highly decorated. Did a little hell-raising when he was a kid, but nothing serious\" Larkin told the men in the room with a serious look. Duncan looked up from the file Vince had given to him \"Explain to me why any of this matters\" he growled in his gravely voice as Vince looked over to the DEA officer \"Fact one. We got a plane up there filled with killers, rapists and thieves and we got this guy Cameron Poe, in on an involuntary manslaughter beef. Non-gang affiliated. He's a parolee hitchin' a ride home\". Vince sighed when Duncan rolled his eyes impatiently. \"Fact two. Poe has a chance to get off the plane. Doesn't do it. Why? Fact three. Our guard, Falzon, said a convict named Cameron Poe planted Sims's tape recorder on him. These are interesting facts. You do the math on this, and we got an ally on that plane\". Duncan snorted with laughter and sat forward in his chair \"Ally? This guy is a criminal. A murderer\" Vince turned quickly and shook the file \"Read the file. Got in a drunken brawl defending his wife and he killed a guy. Could have happened to any one of us, including you and me\" Vince shouted at the DEA agent. \"I am not one of these animals\" Duncan roared throwing the file on the coffee table in front of him as Vince laughed in disbelief \"Oh, that's original! When exactly did they all become animals?\" he asked rhetorically. \"When they stopped giving a damn about the law, about civilization\" Duncan told Vince who just nodded and raised his eyebrow \"'The degree of civilization in a society can be judged by observing its prisoners'. Dostoevsky said that after doing a little time\" Vince quoted as he tried to keep his cool. Duncan stood and stalked over to Vince angrily \"' Fuck you! Cyrus Grissom said that after putting a bullet in my agent's head. Okay?\" Dever coughed to get both of the men's attention \"The issue here is how the plane is brought down\" Duncan looked over Vince's shoulder to Dever whose sat at his desk \"Shoot it down\" he suggested shrugging his shoulders carelessly. Vince looked at Duncan angrily \"Yeah. When exactly did this become a DEA jurisdiction?\" Vince shouted at Duncan who was starting to turn red in the face \"The second the DEA agent was murdered. I am authorized to bring Agent Sims's killers to justice using and I quote, All necessary means.\" Vince growled as he rubbed his face and looked at Duncan and Dever's \"That does not include shooting down my plane\" Duncan shrugged his shoulders ignorantly \"Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't\" Vince turned to the chief in desperation \"Is that right? Tell me you're not seriously entertaining this\" he begged the older man feeling shock. Dever put his hands up trying to calm the situation \"Vince, this is a drastic situation we got\" Vince ran his hands through his hair starting to lose his cool \"Those are our men up there!\" he roared as Duncan turned to him seriously \"All of whom signed a no-hostage clause. They know the score\" Vince's eyes widened in disbelief \"Nicole didn't she wasn't asked to and plus who are you to decide the value of a man's life? There are innocent people up there!\" Vince shouted thinking about the young girl trapped on the plane with the worst kind of monsters. Suddenly the sound of helicopter blades could be heard \"About time\" Duncan called out smugly giving Vince a nasty smirk, Vince looked confused as he peeked through the blinds \"For what? About time for what?\" Devers looked at Vince seriously \"Attack choppers. We're going after 'em\" Dever explained to Vince with a frown he also wanted to get this plane down before all the criminals escaped. \"Goddamn it Skip, don't do this! This man is in an irrational state of mind! His head isn't on straight\" Vince argued as he followed the two men outside and watched as they both climbed into the chopper. \"Fuck off, Marshal Larkin. Your job's finished. This flight's full\" Duncan slammed the door to the helicopter shut effectively locking Vince out, Running his hands through his hair angrily Vince ran back inside he had to help some how or else a lot of innocent people were about to die. -The Jailbird- Opening my eyes slowly I breathed in deeply as I found myself curled into Cyrus as he had his arm firmly around me, I smiled happily when I realised Cyrus had kept his promise of still being here when I woke up. \"Gentlemen, in roughly five hours, we will be flying over the shores of Mexico But first we have to change aircraft. Thank you, and have a pleasant flight\" Cyrus said over the intercom radio as he locked eyes with me. \"Afternoon princess\" smiling I sat up and stretched causing Cyrus's eyes to roam over my frame making me blush a little \"Nice sleep darlin?\" I smiled at swamp thing as he turned to smile at me nicely \" Yeah it was great, best I've had in a long time\" Cyrus smirked at me as I smiled back. Nathan walked through the door with Cindino in tow and grinned at me \"Ahh baby girl you're awake\" nodding I smiled as he sat down and began talking to swamp thing, sighing contently I looked down at the floor and saw the clipboard and pen he had put down. Picking up the discarded pen and paper I sat with my back against the wall and pulled my knees up so I could lean the clipboard against them and started to draw looking at Cyrus discreetly every now and then \"What's the ETA, Swamp Thing?\" Cyrus called over to Swamp Thing who checked the dials. \"At 228 miles an hour, about 71 minutes. The only problem is, we're not doing 228 miles an hour. We're doing 205. We're draggin', baby. The landing gear ain't all the way up. We're gonna be late\" Swamp told us as Cindino started to look worried and turned back to look at an irritated Cyrus. \"No, no, no. Cyrus, that's unacceptable\" he told Cyrus who sighed and looked at Nathan \"Check out the gear\" Nathan looked over to Cyrus shocked before frowning\"What the hell do I know about landing gear?\" Cyrus looked up at Nathan seriously \"Learn\" Nathan sighed irritably before getting up and leaving. \"What are you scrawling over there?\" Cyrus asked me as he tried to look at what I was doing, pulling the paper to my chest quickly I shook my head \"Nothing\" Cyrus squinted his eyes at me knowing I was lying but he didn't call my name angrily this time. Sighing I knew he wouldn't let it go and wanted me to show him without him having to threaten or shout at me so I passed him the papers with his picture on, Cyrus said nothing but just looked at the hand drawn picture I had just given him. Feeling my stomach tighten with nerves I sighed \"It's stupid I know\" Cyrus looked up at me and frowned before turning the paper around showing the life like picture I had just drawn \"This is not stupid\" he whispered to me as I played with the pen \"Let's see\" Swamp called over his shoulder with a grin. Cyrus handed him the paper but kept his eyes on me \"Wow this looks great, you got some talent on ya girly\" blushing I smiled as Cyrus took the drawing back and looked at it again \"Who told you your drawings were stupid?\" he asked me looking angry. \"My mom\" I told him frowning feeling the usual mental pain whenever I remembered anything from my childhood, Cyrus nodded and sucked on his teeth annoyed \"The alcoholic\" I looked at him shocked \"How did you know?\" Cyrus looked at me seriously before looking back down at the paper \"I've told you before I know more than you think, like how you always had to take care of yourself or how you had to walk yourself to school from the age of 6\" with no one to protect you. I opened my mouth in shock as a tear ran down my face as I remembered my twisted childhood \"Have you been watching me?\" I asked shocked but not surprised he knew almost everything about me, Cyrus just looked up at me and clenched his jaw although he didn't say anything his expression was enough. \"Cyrus?\" I called angrily he looked up at me shocked when I said his name strongly \"What do you expect when you lived with a barely functioning alcoholic\" he shouted at me with fire in his eyes \"That's not your choice to make!\" I told him jumping up gripping the pen in my hand tightly. Walking away Cyrus grabbed my arm and growled at me \"Where do you think you're going\" ripping my arm away I opened the door \"To go see Nathan\" slamming the door shut behind me I breathed deeply letting out the anger and fear before opening my eyes to see all the convicts looking up at me squealing to myself I quickly climbed down from the cockpit and opened the hatch to the belly of the plane. Climbing down the the ladder I turned just in time to see Cameron writing something on a now dead and half frozen Pinball as Nathan rummaged through some boxes before turning to Cameron with a gun \"Hillbilly. Gotcha. Hurry up, man\" I watched as Cameron kicked Pinball out of the plane before looking up and freezing when he saw me watching him. \"Bye, Pinball\" Nathan called behind him as he continued to root threw all of the boxes, Cameron walked over to me with a serious look \"What did you see?\" I looked up at his face and saw worry in his eyes but his face was void of anything \"Enough\" I whispered as we stood face to face. Nathan turned and saw us talking \"Hey baby girl, look at all this stuff\" nodding I looked at Cameron suspiciously before walking over to Nathan \"You ok?\" he asked me as he pulled out a pair of white sunglasses \"Yeah fine\" I told him hoping he'd believe me because honestly I didn't know myself. A/N: Thank you all for messaging me asking for update and I am trying to update whenever possible but right now I'm trying to figure out a direction for this story to go in so i'm tweaking the few chapters i have written.[Chapter 15] -The Jailbird- Following Nathan back over to the ladder I watched in silence as he climbs up the ladder easily before waiting for me to grab his hand to pull me up out of the hatch, Billy stopped us as we walked by \"Hey, wait. W-Where'd you get the rims, man?\" Nathan smirked straightening out his new shades \"personal shits down in the belly\". I continue to follow Nathan deep in thought \"Hey, those are my shades\" A very feminine voice called out to us I turned to see an obviously gay Hispanic boy \"They're mine now, sister\" Nathan called back making me laugh \"Men!\" the Hispanic boy huffs rolling his eyes. Stopping I watch as Nathan continues walking as my eyes drift over to Cameron who was sat forward in his seat with his elbows on his knees looking a little nervous, I walk over to the chairs where Cameron, O'Dell and Sally all resided. Sitting on the arm of Cameron's chair I looked at him emotionless \"what did you write?\" Cameron looked up to me slowly but didn't say anything, Sally and Odell just watched us looking equally as nervous \"You obviously wrote to someone who could help but who?\" I said aloud thinking about who Cameron might of known until I realised \"Vince\" I whispered as Cameron looked up at me shocked but nodded once. Cameron's eyes left mine and looked over my shoulder I turned to see Billy making his way down the hatch and I grinned \"You might want to follow him unless you want Cyrus to know you're a liar\" I whispered to Cameron with a smirk as he quickly got up and followed Billy to the belly of the plane. Standing by Sally we stood in silence before she sighed and looked at me sadly \"Whose side are you on?\" she asked softly, I breathed in deeply and tried to cut off my emotions I wouldn't let people get to me again \"Mine\" I told her seriously but I think she could already see where my loyalty lay. \"I can't believe it in all 17 years he never showed any signs of care or compassion until you walked in\" Sally told me seriously she didn't say his name but we both knew who she was talking about, I just nodded and shrugged as if I didn't care. I did. \"What's happened to you?\" Sally whispered as she looked at me almost like she was trying to see if I was the same person she met a week ago, I sighed heavily as my jaw tightened \"Nothing. Maybe this was me all along, maybe I just needed someone to show me that they...\". I stopped short and looked at Sally with fire in my eyes as she squinted at me \"What to show you they cared? Cyrus doesn't care about you, Your parents care about you.. I care about you\" Sally mumbled looking at me softly. I shrieked with laughter \"My parents? News flash they never cared about me I was just a weapon that they used against each other. I'm better off without them I'm better with him\" I say as I feel my stomach tighten as I look at Sally's shocked face. Blinking slowly I leaned back against the cage as I see Cameron came back from the bottom of the plane looking upset \"Two went down, one came up\" I turned shocked as Garland talked out loud so normally \"Wasn't my fault\" Cameron groaned out as he sat back down in his chair with his head in his hands. \"Well, you don't have to tell me. Most murders are crimes of necessity rather than desire. But the great ones, Dahmer, Gacy, Bundy they did it because it excited them\" Garland spoke as he looked ahead his expression not changing once. Cameron sat up quickly and looked at Garland with a serious expression \"Don't you- I got nothing in common with them, with you. Don't you talk to me! They were insane\" Garland chuckled before looking at Cameron again \"Now you're talking semantics. What if I told you insane was working 50 hours a week in some office for 50 years at the end of which they tell you to piss off?\". Garland sighed again as he folded his hands in his lap neatly \"Ending up in some retirement village hoping to die before suffering the indignity of trying to make it to the toilet on time. Wouldn't you consider that to be insane?\" Cameron's head shot over to Garland as he glared harshly \"Murdering 30 people, semantics or not, is insane!\" he shouted but it didn't faze the mass murderer who was now looking at me intently \"One girl I drove through three states wearing her head as a hat\". Grimacing I gulped suddenly remembering where I was and quickly ran back over to the cockpit only stopping at the door to take a deep breath hoping Cyrus wasn't angry any more. I realise now he was just trying to take care of me something I hadn't had the luxury of in a long time. \"All right, you damn peckerwoods, crack the knuckles and hit the crystals. We're putting this baby down in a sandbox.\" I heard Swamp call over the intercom, I gasped as the door swung open revealing a serious looking Cyrus \"I'm sorry\" I told him as he looked at me intently his face clear of any expression \"I'm just not used to someone caring about me\". Cyrus nodded at me pulled me to him so we stood in the door way \"Don't be sorry just trust me\" nodding I smiled before the plane started shaking, Cyrus pulled us into the cockpit and sat on the chair sitting me between his legs with his arms either side of me holding on the pilot chairs. Placing my hands on Cyrus's arm I tried to steady myself as the plane began to land unsteadily, Swamp pulls on the gear stick whilst pressing some buttons as we start to descend. My stomach began to churn as the plane lowered my fear of landing seemingly mocking me. Suddenly a smaller plane appears in front of us \"Look out!\" Cindino shouts as I turn and bury my head in Cyrus's neck and put my arms around him as I mutter \"We're gonna die\" feeling the plane lurch up again before slamming back to the ground I braved a look out of the front window I gasped as we were now heading towards a propane tank. \"Cyrus!\" I called but I knew it was out of his control I burrowed myself into his neck again hearing him laugh before he curled an arm around me as the plane began to rock and hit things harder than before \"We are so dead\" I whispered to him scared as I closed my eyes and silently prayed. Feeling the plane come to a dead halt I waited for the explosion and burning pain but hearing the convicts whoop I sighed in realization we were ok. I looked up to see Cindino and Swamp run out of the cockpit, looking back at Cyrus who was staring at me intently. Emotionless. \"What?\" I asked paranoid as Cyrus continued to stare before his line of sight lowered to my lips, realizing how close we are and how I buried myself into him I bit my lip before Cyrus leaned in an placed an unusually soft kiss on my lips. Pulling back I breathed deeply before looking back at Cyrus who unusually hasn't said a word \"I wont hurt you\" he told me reassuringly I looked at him he could read me so well, putting my hands on his cheeks I pulled him to me. Cyrus pulled me closer deepening the timid kiss I had started, any bad thoughts or confusion I had before vanished the more Cyrus pulled me to him. \"Cyrus...\" I jumped up when I heard the door slam open I saw Nathan standing in the doorway looking at us confused. \"Did I interrupt?\" he asked us Cyrus glared deeply at his friend \"Nope\" I squeaked walking out of the cockpit behind Nathan before I felt an arm grab me and pull me back softly \"This isn't over\" Cyrus told me before turning to Nathan with a hard expression. I bit my lip and nodded I wasn't going anywhere , I followed Nathan and Cyrus who had pulled me behind them as all the convicts where now jumping around excitedly, looking over to Cameron I saw him comforting O'Dell who looked like he was going to drop dead at any second. Standing by Nathan I watched as he began to release the guards \"Not so fast\" I heard Cyrus's voice ring out looking up I saw Cyrus holding Sally's arm which was still connected at the wrists by handcuffs \"We don't need any distractions, lock her up Nathan\" Cyrus told Nathan before looking at me \"I can't break a promise\". After watching Sally being locked into one of the cells I looked at her as Nathan and Cyrus walked over to the opening of the plane \"Be careful\" Sally whispered to me looking serious \"Are you going to be ok?\" I asked the woman who was hell bent on keeping me innocent \"Well it's not like I'm going anywhere\" She half joked as she pulled on her restraints. \"Nicole!\" I looked up to see Cyrus looking between Sally and I suspiciously before beckoning me over to where they were all stood waiting for the door to lower, I gave Sally a small smile and walked over to the back of the plane where we all stepped out into the sunshine for the first time in hours. \"Lerner Airfield. I'm so glad to be here\" Cyrus drawled as he looked around the vast deserted with a smirk the convicts began to run whooping and shouting, I laughed loudly watching as Viking did a flip to the floor \"Thank you for choosing Con Air\".[Chapter 16] -Lerner Airfield- I stood by Cyrus silently as we looked out at the small airfield in the middle of nowhere \"Where's the plane, Francisco?\" Cyrus asked Cindino is a short tone getting more annoyed by the second, Cindino looked around before shrugging his shoulders \"I don't know. Have patience\" he told Cyrus as he continued to look at the empty open desert. Cyrus turned to Cindino angrily and pointed at him \"The last guy who told me to have patience? I burned him down, and bagged his ashes\" he hissed at the drag baron making him flinch, I internally grimaced at this latest revelation of Cyrus's evil doings I knew what he was no saint but hearing it from his own mouth just sounded wrong. Cindino sighed and continued to look around eyeing Cyrus cautiously \"Cyrus, it'll be here\" I squinted at Cindino I didn't trust him he looked fidgety and that's never good huffing I looked over to see Cyrus watching me as I watched Cindino he could tell there was something wrong too. \"Hey, you stupid sons of bitches!\" I jumped my back hitting Cyrus's chest as I pulled a face at the angry looking man who was currently running up to us swearing and almost foaming at the mouth, I was breathing so hard I almost didn't feel Cyrus' hand rubbing my hip. Nathan and the other convicts started to pull the guards out of the plane and punching them, the guards began to drop to the ground from the harsh attack just as the man got to us \"Jesus Christ!\" he shouted before turning back and running in the opposite direction terrified. \"I hope he likes sand\" Cyrus calls out sardonically as I laughed at his joke watching as the man continued to run only turning back to look at us a couple of times his eyes wide in fear, I smiled when Cyrus' grip tightened around me before letting go. \"Muchacho, run and check out the tower. Have a look-see, yeah?\" Cyrus ordered Johnny who nodded and began to run over to the watch tower, walking away from Cyrus a little I put my hand over my eyes looking at the emptiness around us there was nothing for miles. \"You come with us\" I heard Cyrus say behind me roughly \"You too\" he said again before grabbing my arm and pulling me along with him \"Hey!\" I called in surprise as Cyrus' held a grip on my bicep as Cindino struggled to walk with Cyrus pulling him along. Cyrus threw Cindino down on a rusty looking lawn chair before smirking at him \"Stay\" he called to Cindino like a dog before pulling me along with him as we climbed to the top of the plane watching as the convicts looted the place of all it's items. I smiled as I sat on top of the plane closing my eyes and leaning on my arms behind me basking in the heat and sunlight, sighing I smiled feeling free I guess this is why Cyrus and Nathan took over the plane in the first place. Freedom. \"Just what is going on in that head of yours\" I heard behind me I turned to see Cyrus smiling down at me obviously enjoy my happiness \"Freedom\" I told him as I pushed myself into standing an walking closer to him. \"I've never been truly free until now\" I mumbled as I played with the buttons on his police shirt as he watched. \"You make me feel things I've never felt before\" I told him sighing before letting go of his shirt \"and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not\". Cyrus sighed before grabbing my upper arms \"You cant help what you feel\" he mumbled to me as I looked up at him \"Tell me what you feel\" he ordered letting go of me, looking up at the man who I'd adored for years I knew what I felt I knew exactly what I felt and that scares me. \"Do I scare you?\" Cyrus taunted as he took a step towards me \"Do I make you nervous?\" he asked taking another step making me walk back. \"Do I worry you, repulse you?\" Cyrus continued to walk me back until we were at the tail end of the plane. Cyrus pushed me against the vertical stabilizer of the plane and smirked \"Or are you just upset because I excite you and you don't know what to do about it\" looking up at Cyrus quietly he still held his smirk knowing he was right, he always is. \"I should hate you but I don't... I can't!\" I shouted at him as he looked at me seriously \"I know all of the bad things you do and have done but I still can't bring myself to even dislike you\" Cyrus moved my hair away from my face. \"Then don't try\" looking down at Cyrus's white shirt I again grabbed the front of his police shirt and played with it deep in thought, Cyrus made me happier even when he wasn't trying, Sure he was rough around the edges and anything could set him off but he was never that way with me. Glancing up at Cyrus I smiled before jumping into his arms and wrapping my arms around his neck with a grin as I looked at his shocked face \" I guess it's just me, you and sandy beaches\" Cyrus looked up at me pleased before kissing me deeply as he held onto me tightly. \"Swing low, sweet chariot Comin' for to carry me home\" Pulling back from Cyrus I looked around confused as he sighed in annoyance before he set me down and walked back over to the middle of the plane and looking down. Walking over I saw Nathan singing whilst holding a gun to the guards heads I gasped quietly as I saw Nathan in a different light \"Oh, no. What the hell you think you're doin'?\" my head whipped to the side to see Cameron walking out of the plane and heading towards Nathan with an angry look on his face. \"It's time to off the pigs\" Nathan told Cameron joyfully as he cocked his gun and pointed it toward the beaten up guards who were on their knees making me frown and shake my head \"You can't do that\" Cameron objected putting his hand up towards Nathan. I turned and watched Cyrus's face but he looked emotionless \"You're not going to let him kill them are you?\" Cyrus looked over to me and rubbed his chin \"Why not?\" gasping I frowned at him \"because they're innocent people\" would he really let Nathan do this? Was I wrong about them?. Cyrus shook his head and ran a hand through my hair \"\"If you worry about yesterday's failures, then today's successes will be few. The future depends on what we do in the present\" he recited as he looked at me softly. \"Quote Gandhi all you want it's still wrong\" I told him raising an eyebrow in annoyance that he thought he could throw quotes around and I wouldn't be mad that he was going to let Nathan kill all those guards down there. Cyrus looked over at me in surprise \"You knew that?\" I sighed but nodded and looked at Cyrus sadly \"Please Cy\" Cyrus looked at me before rubbing his face and looked back at the two men who were still arguing \" What exactly are we discussing here?\" he asked as if we weren't just watching the whole thing go down. Nathan looked up at us surprised to see us standing on the edge of the plane \"Poe don't want me to off the pigs\" Nathan muttered as he pointed his gun in Cameron's direction, I watched Nathan carefully he was starting to lose it, he was getting murderous. \"Well, it's not difficult to surmise how Nathan here feels about killing guards and my own proclivities are, uh well-known and, uh, often-lamented facts of penal lore. What I'm wonderin' is why you have any opinion about it at all\" Cyrus asks as he walked along the plane scratching the top of his head. \"Cyrus, this is your barbecue, man, and it tastes good\" Cameron drawled as also looking up at us making little eye contact with me \"But I was just sayin' to Mr Dog over here, that if it was my barbecue I'd wait for that old jumbo jet in the sky before I start killin' our only leverage\" Cameron finally looked at me it was like he was trying to read the body language between Cyrus and I. Nathan growled and cocked his gun \"Shut the fuck up!\" when he realized Cyrus hadn't said any thing in Nathan defense \"Don't you want to get high and get laid?\" Cameron taunted in his thick southern accent looking between Cyrus and Nathan who was beginning to sweat and breathe heavily. \"Shit. Oh, fuck this!\" Nathan said grabbing one of the guards who whimpered at the strong man's grip and pushed the gun to the back of his head roughly \"Nathan, no!\" I cried out trying to push myself past Cyrus who held a tight grip on me. Nathan looked up at me with soft eyes as a tear made it's way down my cheek \"It's better this way baby girl\" Shaking my head I looked back at Cyrus desperately, I noticed he was thinking to himself \"Put the gun down. Put the gun down, Nathan. Poe's right. We're goin' to Plan B.\". I smiled as Nathan threw the guard down in defeat \"We need to get a refueling truck and a tractor. So get back there and dig the plane out\" Cyrus ordered as I threw myself into his arms happily as he grabbed my waist as he helped me off the plane. Getting back onto the ground I was immediately tackled into a hug by the feminine looking Hispanic who I was told was called 'Sally can't dance' \"Come on girl you can help me\" I looked up at Cyrus who just looked amused before nodding to 'sally' who was looking at Cyrus questioningly. \"Bring her back in once piece\" he told 'Sally' dangerously who just nodded happily and linked arms with me, Laughing falsely I looked back at Cyrus \"What are you doing\" I asked through my smile so I wouldn't offend 'Sally' he just smiled and waved sarcastically \"Have a nice time ladies\". 'Sally' pulled me along to the old looking buildings, I looked back at Cyrus again who was just laughing before he turned and walked to the other convicts yelling orders along the way. \"What are we lookin' for?\" I questioned as 'Sally' pulled me into one of the buildings \"Clothes girl, I feel so manly in these\" 'Sally' said shivering in her prison clothes. Smiling I laughed a little at 'Sally's' theatrics before deciding to help, looking around I found a suitcase and threw it on the floor. Kneeling down I opened it and began to throw out some of the clothes before holding up a purple dress with a smile \"It's so you\". 'Sally' gasped and took it from me and held it to her/ his body, I'm going to guess Sally identifies with a female pronoun as she doesn't want to look manly \"Yes!\" throwing of her clothes 'Sally' quickly shuffled into the dress \"Zip me up?\" she asked nicely turning her back to me and looking at me over her shoulder as I zip up the the old fashion purple dress, I smiled as 'Sally' began to twirl daintily as she looked at herself in a mirror on the wall. \"So you and Cyrus the Virus huh?\" I looked at 'sally' and nodded with a small smile as I remembered the kisses we've had \"I guess so\" she smiled deviously \"you must be something special huh\" frowning I wondered what she was talking about until I heard screaming, leaving 'sally' to look around I walked outside. Seeing Cyrus and the others looking over at a warehouse I frowned until I heard a roaring noise, glancing at the warehouse I gasped seeing a plane begin to emerge from inside \"That's my fuckin' plane!\" I heard Cyrus shout from across the airfield. Looking around I saw a crane and began to run to it hoping to stop the plane in time, Jumping inside the crane I began randomly pushing push buttons hoping for the best when the top of the crane began to lower as the plane slid under it, looking to the right I let out a scream as I saw the wing of Cindino's airplane heading for me before I felt a crushing blow and then nothing.[Chapter 17] Enzz - Thank you for your review, hope you like this chapter. kwaziigsd - Yes a cliffhanger hehe and this chapter doesn't give much more away... sorry. SilverDragon13 - no more waiting here it is :) Kai - Look no further, I hope you enjoy this chapter. Cyrus stood next to the jailbird twisted a bolt onto a hook as he looked around at the other convicts digging at the sand around the plane like good worker ants \"Viking, about time to go and get that tractor, yeah?\" Cyrus ordered to the burly blonde inmate as he continued to turn the bolt. Viking nodded and threw down his shovel \"Yeah\" he mumbled in agreement and ran over to the tractor sitting on the other side of the airfield, Cyrus looked up and over to the building where he knew Nicole was and gave a small smirk at what she and the very feminine inmate could be talking about especially with the look of help she gave him before 'Sally' dragged her away. \"I'll get the fuel truck\" Cyrus turned to see Poe behind him \"Thanks Poe\" Cyrus said as Poe bent down to pick up the thick rope from the floor handing it to him\"You've proven to be a most useful mammal\" Cyrus told the Texan truthfully as he took the rope \"'Many hands make light work' my daddy taught me that\" Poe recited to Cyrus with a look of fondness that made Cyrus sick, Poe was obviously close to his family. \"You know what my daddy taught me?\" Cyrus asked Poe without looking up at him \"What's that?\" Poe asked interested as Cyrus looked up at him with a vicious smirk \"Nothin'\" Poe nodded and looked back at Cyrus with a grin \"Self-educated man\" Poe told him walking off leaving Cyrus wondering if Poe was going to continue being an ally, being locked up for so long Cyrus knew giving trust away was dangerous. Cyrus looked over to see the Cindino still sitting on the chair he put him earlier and threw a shovel over to him smirking when the south American drug lord fumbled to catch it with a look of confusion \"You expect me to?\" Cindino started obviously shocked at what Cyrus wanted him to do \"Dig\" Cyrus deadpanned as Cindino glared at him before starting to dig with the others. \"All right, girls! It's miller time! Take yourselves a break. Cigarettes!\" Curly shouted at he ran across the airfield with a trolley cart full of cigarettes and other things as the other convicts began to cheer and whoop they ran over to Curly as he began throwing the cigarettes to them \"We got whiskey!\" he cheered as he named all of the things he was able to pillage. Cyrus walked away from the plane to watch Curly handing out the alcohol and cigarettes to the convicts as they all surrounded him and fought over what they could get out of the trolley cart \"Want me to break this up?\" Nathan offered as he walked up beside Cyrus shovel in hand sweat soaking through his shirt \"No leave 'em be. You know how happy they are when they get somethin' that don't belong to 'em\" Cyrus tells Nathan with a smirk as he watches the commotion. \"You seen baby girl\" Nathan asks as he breathes heavily from the laborious work \"She's still with Ramon\" Cyrus said causally using the small Spanish man's real name one in which 'Sally' hated \"Trust me she's safe\" Cyrus and Nathan both laughed at the thought of Ramon trying to take on Nicole knowing she'd come out the winner. Cyrus nods happily when he sees Viking pulling up on an old farm tractor and hands Swamp Thing the cable rope and hook he'd been putting together earlier, Swamp attaches the cable to the front of the tractor and drives over to the back of the plane and begins to tie it to the metal hook on the back of the plane. \"Where's the fuel truck?\" Viking asks as he stands next to Cyrus who was reminded about Poe getting the fuel truck, Cyrus looks out into the airfield for any sign of Poe or the fuel truck but nothing \"Where indeed\" Cyrus questioned to himself suspiciously. Cyrus looks back to the plane where the convicts and guards were beginning to dig again, the hole around the bottom of the plane was large enough now to see the wheels almost ready to be pulled out but they wouldn't be getting all the way to Mexico until they got more fuel into the plane. \"Yo Cyrus!\" one of the convicts called running over and telling him that Johnny seen someone coming over at the tower, Cyrus and Nathan looked at each other before running over to the tower \"How long we got til they get here?\" Cyrus questioned looked at the sand billowing up in the horizon showing that the cavalry was coming for them. \"10, 12 minutes, tops.\" Nathan replied as they both stared over at the oncoming cars in disbelief how did they know where they were? They both ran back over the airfield only two things on both of their minds, Getting the plane out of the sand and getting Nicole. Cyrus walked up to the plane and ushers everyone to move faster \"Let's go, gentlemen. The cavalry is one it's way\". Cyrus' eyes flicker over to the buildings where he had last seen Nicole he knew she was ok but the feeling of wanting her by his side was starting to get to him \"I want this airplane out now\" Cyrus shouted again feeling more irritated. The convicts finished with their digging all start to gather up the ropes and tie them to the plane \"Come on\" they all shouted at each other all feeling the pinch of the police practically on their tails, Cyrus gave one more look for Poe before helping the other convicts to pull the plane out of the sand. Cyrus looks up wanting to see Cindino struggling to do his part knowing the drug lord has never done any manual labor before but Cyrus' cocky smile was soon gone when he realized that Cindino was nowhere to be seen \"Where's Cindino?\" Cyrus shouts to Nathan who was whipping the other convicts to get them t work faster \"I ain't seen 'em\" Nathan shrugged looking unconcerned. Cyrus grits his teeth wondering where Cindino was and what he could be up to when suddenly a whirring sound came from inside the store depot and a plane comes blasting through the tarpaulin and across the sand \"That's my fuckin' plane!\" Cyrus screams as he and the other convicts watch angrily as the plane passes them. All of the convict watch helplessly as the plane speeds down the sand ready to take off when suddenly the crane starts to lower just as the plane goes under it, Cyrus frowns in wonder when he sees the plane crash into the crane ripping off the wings who had been controlling the crane? The crane cuts through the small plane like butter the front of the plane comes apart from the rear and careens towards the small gas station, the nose of the jet plows straight through the fuel tanks and into the gas station building as gasoline starts to rain down on top of the broken plane. Cyrus and the other convict run over to the plane each of them hoping to confront the south American drug lord who fooled them all \"Go find Nicole and check who moved that crane\" Cyrus ordered to Nathan who nodded and ran off. A small groan echoed through the broken plane and Cyrus smirked as Cindino climbed out of the back of the plane unsteadily reminding him of Bambi, a book he mesmerized to read to Nicole when she was a child. \"Cyrus, help me\" Cindino pleaded as he struggled to get from the wreckage but Cyrus just stood glaring at the man \"Looks like you missed your connection\" Cyrus growled out as Cindino continued to lie and beg \"We were- We were coming to get you\" Cindino lied as Cyrus looked over to Swamp who was stood next to him smoking a cigarette that Curly had stolen. Cyrus took the cigarette from Swamp's mouth and Cindino looked over to him in fear as he noticed the gasoline flooding around him \"Cy-?\" he begged but Cyrus wasn't budging he looked around carefully in case those familiar soft blue eyes were watching him \"-anora\" Cyrus finished before he flicked the lit cigarette over to Cindino. The cigarette bounced onto the floor and quickly set the gasoline alight burning the man in front of them alive, Cyrus didn't flinch as the screams coming from Cindino's mouth he could only watch as the flesh on his body melted as Cindino tried to crawl away one last time before dropping to the floor dead. So this chapter is just Cyrus' pov and what happens in the time that Nicole is helping 'Sally' find a dress and other things, Also if anyone's wondering why I keep writing 'Sally' with the apostrophe marks is because I don't want people getting confused with Sally the guard and Sally Can't Dance the convict.[Chapter 18] kwaziigsd- Aww sorry for the cliffhangers lol i don't do it on purpose it's just where I think the chapter end best. SilverDragon13: Thanks for the review hope you like this chapter. TillyPan: Wow so many reviews, I did get them all but I was asleep when you sent them haha, I'm glad you're liking the story. becky93higgs: I'm glad you're getting into my story, hope you like this chapter. Vince Larkin watches from behind a plane in the depot as Cindino's 'friends' screw a silencer onto the end of his gun and points it to Cameron Poe's head although the Texan didn't look worried \"Well, hooray for the sounds of fuckin' silence\" he grunted sarcastically as Vince slowly made his way over to them gun raised \"freeze!\". All 3 of the Spaniards turn to face Vince in shock as Cameron with an alarming speed grabs the first guys arm and hits him in the elbow and punches him in the back of the head. Still holding the guy he moves his arm and shoots the other guy in the leg, before pulling the first guy closer and hitting him with a knee into the chest, then elbows the third man in the face whilst simultaneously punching the first guy in the face before finally roundhouse kicking the third guy sending him to the ground. As Cindino's men lay groaning on the floor Cameron kicks away their weapons as he points the silence gun on shocked looking Vince who hand shook as he held onto his gun. \"You're Cameron Poe\" Vince says as he gives a deep exhale after seeing just what the man can do, he was a fighting machine all on his own. Cameron nods stoically his gun still trained onto Vince and vise versa \"That's right\". \"I'm Larkin\" Vince announces his voice still shaky as they eye each other cautiously \"Hello, Larkin\" Cameron greets but doesn't move an inch, his arms steady unlike the marshal officer who was obviously still in shock at Cameron's fighting display. \"I got your message\" Vince tells Cameron as he swallows hard looking at the gun in Cameron's hands and then back to his eyes \"Where are the troops?\" Cameron questions calmly like this was an every day occurrence to him. \"They'll be here\" Vince mutters trying to sound strong in front of the army ranger \"They'll be here?\" Cameron mocked noticing that Vince didn't look or sound too sure \"Uh-huh. In a minute\" Vince nods still looking dubious. \"Listen, Poe, can I lower this?\" Vince questions the ex ranger/convict as he nods towards the gun \"Go ahead\" Cameron insists but doesn't move an inch to lower his weapon in return. \"You gonna lower yours?\" Vince asks desperately but Cameron still doesn't move, he didn't change his demeanour at all \"Sorry, boss, but there's only two men I trust. One of them's me. The other's not you\". Vince nods and notices Cameron give off a small smirk a sign that he could be talked to he just needed to show that he could be trusted \"So Cindino was running a drag on everyone\" Vince asks as he moves his head to indicate the plane. \"Yeah\" Cameron nodded, back to looking stoic \"If you can't trust a South American drug lord, who can you trust, huh?\" Vince mutters with a little laugh but Cameron doesn't. \"That was a joke\" Vince informs carefully in case Cameron didn't understand \"I'm glad you told me. Now I gotta get back to the plane\".Cameron tells the marshal officer but doesn't move from his spot, gun still pointed firmly as Vince's heart. Vince huffs and lowers his weapon hesitantly \"You're a free man, Poe. What are you doin'?\" a emotion passed over Cameron's face but it was gone as soon as appeared \"I can't trade a friend's life for my own, Larkin. That's all\". Vince smiles with knowing sigh \"You got a friend on board?\" he knew it, no army ranger turns rouge for any reason unless it's a good reason \"See, I knew I was right about you. I read your file. You're not such a bad guy. Just always in the wrong place at the wrong time\". Cameron gives a short nod but says nothing. \"You see Cameron I got someone aboard that plane I need to keep safe too\" Vince tells the man as Cameron looks at him in acknowledgement \"The girl\" Poe mutters knowing exactly who Vince was talking about he himself had been keeping an eye on her. \"Yeah, her name's Nicole\" Vince informed but he had the feeling Cameron already knew her name \"Is she ok? What's Cyrus doing with her?\" Vince started spewing out questions as the Texan looked on wondering what this had to do with Vince. \"She's fine for now, Cyrus is keeping her close to him\" Cameron tells the marshal who looks worried about the girl \"she's changing Larkin\" Vince looked up at Cameron shocked \"God what's he doing to her\" Vince asks himself aloud. Cameron watches Vince internally beat himself up \"I'll keep her safe, Goodbye Larkin\" Cameron lowers his weapon and turns to walk off \"I spoke to your wife\" Vince calls out hoping to stop Cameron \"In person?\" Cameron asks quietly as he turns to face the marshal again. \"In person\" Vince agrees as he senses Cameron's walls coming down \"And your little girl\" Cameron's face changes completely when he realises his daughter came to see him \"You saw Casey?\" Cameron asks gently as Vince nods slowly. Cameron stops and thinks before looking over to Vince \"If this thing goes bad, Larkin, I'm afraid my daughter...won't understand\" Cameron thinks again and sighs \"If you talk to my wife again, you tell her...I love her, She's my hummingbird\". Vince nods in agreement as he listens to Cameron talk \"But I couldn't leave a fallen man behind. You'll do that for me, won't you, Larkin?\" Cameron questions Vince who seems to be choosing his words wisely \"Sure I will. What are you gonna do for me?\". Cameron smirks over at Larkin \"What do you think I'm gonna do? I'm gonna save the fuckin' day\" Vince sighs with relief when Cameron runs back out of the depot \"Jesus christ\" he mutters running a hand down his face knowing how bad that could have been. Shaking himself he put his gun back in it's holster and sneaks off out of the depot, seeing the convicts still digging the plane out Vince hid in one of the hollowed out cars waiting for the right time to do something, anything to tackle this situation. Vince popped his head up to look out of the windscreen for any sight of Cameron but the Texan was nowhere in sight \"damn it\" Vince sighed to himself wondering what Cameron's plan was and just how exactly he was going to 'save the day'. Hearing Cyrus' voice ringing out through the sandy airfield a thought rung though his mind, turning carefully in the car Vince looked through the back window where he could see all of the convicts working hard to get the plane out of the ground. \"Where's Nicole?\" Vince muttered to himself seeing the self proclaimed 'virus' but no blonde haired girl in sight, Vince began to worry Cameron told him that Nicole never left his side so where was she now? Vince was so deep in thought and worry about Nicole he didn't see Cindino run past him until he heard the deep roar of a jet starting up, Vince slowly got out of the car and walked over to the tarp keeping the plane hidden. Lifting up the tarp Vince's eyes widened when he was suddenly thrown back by a scorching heat and force from the plane's engine, he watched in horror as the plane passed over him and out of the depot. Vince stood and watched as the plane made it's way down the sandy runway leaving Vince Larkin wondering what the hell he was going to do now until he saw a miracle happen, the crane started to lower in front of the plane. Vince internally cheered when he saw the crane rip through the plane, stopping it from taking off, he cheered when he saw the plane ripped in two but Vince stopped cheering when he saw the blonde girl he'd come to save be thrown from inside of crane when the planes arm crashes through the crane \"Oh god no, Nicole\".[Chapter 19] Cyrus began to turn to walk away deep in thought as the body of the traitor lay still in flames, he had been doubled crossed and now had to think of a way to get himself and Nicole out of dodge before the cops got to them. \"Cyrus!\" Nathan voice shouted making Cyrus groan as he lost his train of thought, turning to berate his only friend Cyrus' stomach dropped at the sight in front of him, Nathan running over to him with a limp form in his arms. His Nicole. Cyrus pushed past the other convicts roughly and towards his girl who wasn't moving and looked dead \"What the fuck happened Nathan?!\" Cyrus shouted as Nathan placed the young girl on the floor gently as he stuttered out words obviously worried for the girl he had come to care for too. \"It was her inside the crane Cy, the plane hit her\" Nathan told his fellow convict rubbing his head looking troubled as Cyrus began to try and find a pulse or any signs of breathing \"Dammit\" Cyrus shouted when he couldn't find any signs of life or consciousness in Nicole. \"She's not breathing\" Cyrus shouted at Nathan who began to pace not knowing what to do to help, Cyrus pinched Nicole's nose and brought his mouth to hers, blowing into her mouth he couldn't help but think of how quickly things had gone wrong and how they had been in a similar embrace not even an hour ago except then Nicole was kissing him back. Pumping her chest Cyrus felt his mind start to race at the thought of loosing her after all he'd only just got her \"Come on Nicole!\" Cyrus shouted as he continued to pump on her chest noticing her lips had started to turn blue \"No\". The other convicts started to crowd round Cyrus and the young girl not being able to make sense of the sight in front of them, had she really tried to help them? Nathan looked down in anticipation as Cyrus continued to work on Nicole, giving her CPR and shaking her shoulders trying to bring her to consciousness. \"Don't you do this to me, Nicole\" Cyrus growled quietly at Nicole who lay still on the hard ground showing no signs of getting back up \"fuck\" Nathan whispered to himself trying not to break down at the sight in front of him, he felt responsible for Nicole and this is what happens to her. \"I think she's dead\" Viking dumbly said aloud as Cyrus stopped giving Nicole CPR for a second to glare up at the blonde convict who shrinks back in fear of what Cyrus and Nathan could do to him, all the convict knew how much they both cared about the girl which is why they haven't touched her. Suddenly realizing he had to make a choice when he heard how close the sirens had gotten \"Cy?\" Nathan muttered wondering why he had stopped helping Nicole, Cyrus looked back down at Nicole face and in a moment of pure emotion sent a heavy hit to the center of her chest making his choice. Feeling a weight hit me I sat up straight gasping for breath feeling like I had gone to hell and back whilst simultaneously being hit in the chest by a bulldozer, finding myself in Cyrus' arms I coughed heavily as my lungs struggled for air as the inmates began to cheer I looked around an noticed I was on the floor with Cyrus with the other inmates surrounding us, I looked at Cyrus whose face held a thankful expression as he pulled me closer to him \"Don't do that again\" Cyrus whispered into my hair sounding almost vulnerable? My eyes roamed around again until they met Nathan's worried ones \"what the hell happened to me\" I asked weakly, the blonde prisoner, Viking, stepped forward \"You died\" he told me sounding sheepish as Cyrus glared at him. \"I knew you would be the death of me\" I joked but Cyrus just looked at me annoyed \"That's not funny\" he hissed quietly as he looks me over \"Shit the cops man\" Johnny swore as I suddenly noticed the sound of siren's blaring loudly. Cyrus suddenly grabbed me in his arms and starting running back to the plane with the other convicts following us, Cyrus placed me back on the floor but kept one arm around my waist as he took his gun from his waistband and shot the lock off the cargo hold. \"Sweetheart can you get in there and pass us all the guns\" Cyrus asked holding my face as I swayed a little still feeling out of it, looking at the small cargo hole I nodded and climbed in and began passing guns to Cyrus trying not to think what they were going to do with them. Pushing past the guilt and visions of all the innocent people him and the other convicts were about to hurt or kill I continued to give Cyrus the weapons, looking at the last gun in my hand it had been a long time since I had been to the shooting range and the gun felt wrong in my hands \"That's all of them\" I told Cyrus handing him the weapon. Looking around the cargo hold for anything else I gasped seeing the body of Billy laying dead on the floor with a pipe sticking out of his chest, this must have been what Cameron and Garland were talking about \"Two went down, one came up\" that's what Garland had said, no wonder Cameron freaked out. \"Cyrus\" I called in shock as my eyes continued to look up the body of a bad man but I couldn't help but feel something but I couldn't place it, surely it couldn't be sorrow? Billy was a killer but I couldn't help but think I felt this way because of Cyrus. Feeling Cyrus crawl into the cargo next to me I tore my eyes away from Billy and onto Cyrus whose eyes roamed over his former comrade \"He's dead\" I whispered to him as his face remained emotionless before helping me out of the cargo hold and steadying me when I staggered. \"Are you okay?\" Cyrus asked me quietly as the others began to familiarize themselves with the guns and excitedly chatting among themselves they lived for this type of violence \"Yeah\" I replied shortly looking at the man I had unintentionally fallen for. \"Stay with me\" Cyrus ordered as we walked away from the plane, nodding I followed Cyrus silently as we stood in the sand setting up a miniature version of the airfield \"Considering my audience, I'm gonna make this very quick, very simple\" I smirked at Cyrus's tone and knew that he was talking about Viking. \"This is the boneyard\" he says drawing two lines in the sand either side of 4 coke cans \"This is the hangar. This is our plane\" I looked up to see everyone nodding as they waited for Cyrus to continue \"What's that?\" Viking asked nodding to the floor making everyone look back to the floor. Cyrus looked at him in disbelief \"That's a rock\" he said flatly as I let out a few little laughs as Viking looked like scolded puppy dog \"Okay\" Cyrus sighed harshly before carrying on with his plan \"The convoy will enter the boneyard through here. Initially, we take out the first car\" Cyrus crushed the first can with his wooden stick \"Then we take out the last creating a trap, an airtight cage filled with lots and lots of dead people\" Lowering my eyes to the ground I was still uncomfortable with the whole killing thing but I was starting to realize it was mine and Cyrus's only chance to get away together, if we don't get out of here we can't be together and the thought of never seeing him again suddenly made my stomach turn. \"Nathan, set everybody in their position, yeah?\" Cyrus ordered Nathan as the convicts began to walk off \"Bring me those propane tanks\" Cyrus shouted to the convicts who were starting to set all the traps up. Cyrus showed the convicts where to put the tanks before sending them off to Nathan for their positions before turning to me with his hand out expectantly \"Let's go\" he called to me when he saw me not moving. Looking at his open hand this felt like a point of no return like If I took his hand now I was okay with him being who he was \"Nicole?\" Cyrus called again his hand still outstretched, smiling to myself I placed my hand in his, I was his.[Chapter 20] \"Let's go\" Cyrus said as he gently pulled me over to one of the broken, unused planes \"Come on sweetheart\" he murmured as he lifted me up in the plane effortlessly, he climbed up after me and pulled me into the corner behind him \"You stay here, don't move\". Crouching down into the corner my heart began to race in excitement and nervousness I felt before was starting to disappear, Cyrus looked over to me seriously as he picked up his gun \"You look oddly calm\". I smiled as I crouched down to keep myself safe \"You have to admit, I'm getting better at this\" I let out a small laugh as Cyrus turned and pulled his gun up to his eye line and waited \"Closer. Closer. Closer.\". Covering my ears I readied myself for the big blast \"Now\" after Cyrus began shooting the boneyard turned into a free for all shooting range, I cringed as I heard screaming and grunts, the sound of other peoples pain was something I hadn't gotten used to... yet. Slowly getting up from my spot in the corner I looked out of the front window of the plane to see fire and chaos \"Always stay one step ahead of your enemy\" I mumbled remembering what Cyrus had told me once when I told him about the girl in school pulling on my pigtails, I cut hers off and put them in her backpack. \"Get back to the plane!\" Cyrus shouted to the other convicts as he shot with a handgun seemingly running out of bullets \"Come on Sweetheart\" Cyrus shouted to me and I ran into his arms as we looked out into the carnage. Tugging on my arm I realized what Cyrus wanted me to do and I groaned \"Oh you suck\" I told him with a small scream as we jumped out of the plane, hitting the floor I noticed a man with a gun pointed at Cyrus. \"Cyrus\" I shouted pushing us out of the way as the man opened fire, gasping as the adrenaline ran through my body I realized I had just saved Cyrus's life and he by the look on his face he knew it too. Cyrus took his handgun out and shot a single bullet at the officers face making him drop dead to the ground, pulling me up Cyrus dragged me towards the plane still shooting behind him. Running onto the plane Cyrus ran in front of me to the cockpit as I watched Sally kicked a now locked up Johnny who looked like he'd taken a beating \"What's going on?\" looking at Sally's disheveled look I realized \"Did he?\" I questioned quietly dreading the answer until she shook her head making me sigh in relief. \"Just take it and let's go\" Cameron shouted to Odell who was on the floor sweating as he injected himself \"Get ready to move,\" Cameron told me as I raised an eyebrow \"Move where?\" Cameron looked over at Sally who just nodded They knew something that I didn't. \"Now, come on!\" Cameron shouted pulling up a healthier looking Odell \"Okay, I'm comin'\" Odell said running to the back of the plane, Cameron grabbed me tightly his arms crossing over mine \"Hey wait\" I said struggling against the ex-army ranger \"Let me go!\" I screamed knowing there was no way I could get from his grip. \"What the fuck are you doing?\" I shouted hoping Cyrus would be able to hear me \"Don't worry Nicole it'll all be okay\" Sally comforted as Cameron pulled me towards the ramp at the back of the plane. As we got to the back of the plane it was too late to leave, we were already in the air, seeing a silver Corvette hanging off a rope connected to the plane I let out a laugh \"On any other day, that might seem strange\" Cameron drawled. Knowing there was nothing they could do now I pushed the southern man from me \"That right there was the biggest mistake you've ever made\" I laughed as Cameron glared at me, he knew I could tell Cyrus everything but apparently they're all hell-bent on saving me \"We're losing her\" Sally whispered to him as I walked away. Walking into the cockpit still laughing I smiled at Nathan, Swamp, and Cyrus \"What's so funny baby girl?\" Nathan asked with a grin obviously my smile was infectious \"Nothing\" laughing I fell forward a little making Cyrus grab my arms to steady me \"Ouch!\" I screamed moving my arm away. Looking at my arm I saw a round hole in my top in-between my bicep and shoulder \"What is that?!\" I screamed again as the panic began to set in, Cyrus grabbed my arm tightly in his \"You've been shot!\" he yelled looking angry as Nathan jumped up to look at my new wound. \"Shot? It must have been when I pushed you out of the way\" Cyrus nodded and sat me down and began to rifle around in the cockpit looking at something \"Nathan go and get me some vodka\" Cyrus shouted at Nathan who nodded and rushed out the door, Cyrus pulled at the bottom of my shirt and helped me pull it over my head so I was in my grey vest I had on underneath. Looking at Cyrus confused I watched as he pulled out a needle and thread out of the first aid kit, feeling my face drain of color it dawned on me what he was about to do, getting up screaming I ran out of the cockpit and straight into Nathan who picked me up with ease. Sitting me back in the chair I shook my head fighting \"No way! You are not...\" Cyrus head my arms together steady as Nathan sat behind me to keep me from moving \"If we don't do this you will lose too much blood\". Cyrus grabbed the Vodka and poured it on a cloth before looking at me and nodding at Nathan who held me tighter when Cyrus quickly cleaned the wound making me scream again \"It's just a graze, no bullet\" He told me as finished cleaning it up \"Oh good so no stitching\" I asked quietly knowing I was wrong. Cyrus handed me the vodka bottle \"You might want some of this\" he told me with a smile, taking the bottle off him I chuckled \"So now you can add supplying alcohol to the underage to your list of crime\" I told him drinking from the bottle as Cyrus watched. \"It's your birthday and you got shot, I think you deserve something plus drinking age is 18 in Mexico\" he muttered to me with a laugh as he sat in front of me waiting. Cyrus grabbed my arm and pushed the needle through my skin again and again until it was finally stitched up. Wrapping my arm with the bandage from the box and helping me put my long-sleeved shirt back on Cyrus looked up at my face and frowned, wiping away the tears I'd let out \"All done\" taking the bottle from me Cyrus gave it to Nathan \"No more\" he said laughing as I glared at him. \"Hey I got shot for you\" I complained as he just looked at me seriously as if he'd just found out the world was actually round and not flat \"Yeah, you did\".[Chapter 21] \"Uh, Cyrus?\" Swamp called from the pilot's chair \"We lost an engine back there\" Cyrus sighed and rubbed his eyes before nodding \"What does that mean exactly\" Nathan asked standing up from where he was holding me. Cyrus turned to Nathan looking grim \"It means let's not lose another\" putting his hand out Cyrus pulled me up carefully and held me close as we exited the cockpit. I smiled a little seeing the convicts handing out alcohol, cigarettes, and chips, this must be the first time they've felt free and happy for a long time. Walking down the cockpit stairs we passed Johnny who was still handcuffed and looking terrible, not one of the convicts had helped him or even looked in his direction since we got back on the plane. Cyrus tsked as he leaned on my shoulders looking at the half beaten man \"You hate to see that, A perfectly good rapo humiliated\" Cyrus laughed out sarcastically leaving Johnny strung up behind us. \"Come on man help me out\" Johnny called out desperately but Cyrus just ignored the serial rapist as we turned to where the other convicts were having a good time \"So what are we doin' now?\" one of them shouted to Cyrus who looked up indifferent. One of the convicts walked forward to Cyrus but still at a safe distance away from us \"I can understand you puttin' Cindino down like that, but what the fuck are we supposed to do now?\" Cyrus growled a little obviously hating being called out. \"It's called plan B. Plan B is a strip in La Cartoza , Mexico. Where the wine runs like water and the women nip at your heels like newborn pups\" Cyrus told the convicts who were now looking more excited. Happy with the answer they got from Cyrus the convicts whooped and cheered excitedly as they went back to drinking and partying as they chittered about the plan. \"and a nice sandy beach for me and you\" Cyrus added whispering in my ear and wound his arms around my waist making me smile and causing my heart to beat faster, this was actually happening now it was real. I smiled at Cyrus and knew this was it, I would go to the end of the earth just to be with him, putting my arms around his neck I kissed his jawline before placing my head on his chest and looking over to the excitable prisoners. Watching the convicts put a disk into the CD player they'd obviously stolen I smiled as Sweet Home Alabama rang out of the speakers and everyone began to whoop and cheer again. Looking down the plane I saw Sally, Cameron, and Odell watching mine and Cyrus' exchange with accusing eyes and that's when I realized I needed to tell him about Cameron before anything else can happen. Cameron was obviously determined to stop the plane and catch all the other convicts before they can escape but I can't let him get to Cyrus, we had to get away, I need him. \"Cyrus I need to tell you something about Poe...\" Cyrus looked down at me questioningly as I moved away from him not knowing how he was going to take this or if he was going to be mad at me for keeping it a secret. Opening my mouth to tell him the truth I got cut off by Nathan who walked up to us looking very angry before handing Cyrus a piece of paper, I watched as Cyrus's face turn into many different emotions and I was confused. \"It's him it's Poe,\" Nathan fumed before they both turned to me \"You knew?\" Cyrus asked me dangerously gentle, swallowing hard I nodded there was no way I could lie to him when I was just about to tell him myself. Cyrus grabbed my unhurt arm \"I think we need to talk\" he growled quietly and gripped my arm tighter \"No\" I told him my voice wavering, I didn't think he'd hurt me but I know how quick it takes for a person's temper to flair and lose control. Cyrus' eyes focused dangerously and I gulped \"Now Nicole\" He ordered but didn't pull me, he wanted me to go with him willingly, shaking my head I tried to back away. Cyrus growled under his breath like the purr of an angry lion and picked me up and threw me over his shoulder as I gasped and screamed as I tried to grab onto anything that would keep him from walking away with me \"Let go!\", Ordering another convict to open up the hatch to the belly of the plan Cyrus lowered me down and jumped down after me, we stood in silence for a while, my silence was me wondering if I could run for my life now. Cyrus just looked at me dangerously like I was about to become prey \"So sweetheart I think we should address the obvious situation\" he told me as he quickly turned us so I was pushed up against the wall and he stood in front of me. Slamming his hands above my head I screamed I still knew he wouldn't really hurt me but he was also very angry at this point \"Tell me what you know, everything\" looking up at his face I said nothing but my eyes obviously told a different story. Cyrus grabbed my face between his hands and frowned when I flinched away \"I'm not angry with you Nicole, I get that you want to save them but you can't. So now tell me everything, who is he?\". Feeling a tear fall I sniffed it wasn't them I wanted to save I really do want to be with Cyrus and forget about my old life but I can't help but feel some protectiveness over Sally she'd been better to me in one week than my parents had been in 18 years. \"Vince told me Poe's an ex-army ranger\" I whispered as a tear slipped over my lips, Cyrus swore as he started to pace before putting his hand either side of me again \"And?\" he pushed knowing there was more. Breathing deeply I sighed shakily \"he was the one who ratted you out at Carson City\" Cyrus looked at me nodding for me to continue \"What about Lerner?\". \"Cameron wrote a message to Vince on Pinball's body when Nathan made him check out the landing gear. He also killed Billy\" Cyrus looked behind us to where Billy was still laying lifeless with his eyes wide open. \"So what now?\" I questioned him crossing my arms protectively over myself \"Is that all?\" Cyrus asked still looking at Billy's body before turning to me, I watched as his eyes softened a little \"That's it\" I affirmed softly as he rubbed his thumb over cheeks to wipe away my tears. \"Now we've got to deal with Poe and then we can carry on to Mexico\" Cyrus explained to me as he rubbed a hand over his face as I looked up at him. I just nodded dumbly \"I'm sorry I should have told you\" I mumbled as he pulled my arms away from their crossed position and pulled me closer to him \"I don't even know why I didn't because I want it to be what you said\" I explained to him as I wrapped my arms around his waist. I looked up and noticed Cyrus' confused face \"Me and you, remember?\" I recited with a smile when his face changed and a happy nod came from him. looking up at him I couldn't help but notice all the things I hadn't really paid attention to before but now I could see him in a different light and I liked it. \"What are you thinking about sweetheart?\" Cyrus asked and I smiled feeling his chest rumble against mine \"just about how handsome you are\" I told him coyly. Cyrus smirked and pushed me against the wall again making me gasp in surprise, something that Cyrus took full advantage of as he quickly pressed his mouth to mine and his tongue slide against mine. I moaned and put my arms around his neck and pulled my body closer to his needing to feel him against mine \"Cy...\" I moaned as he picked me up and started kissing my neck. Wrapping my legs around his waist I couldn't help but feel completely relaxed and anxious at the same time, being with Cyrus made me forget about everything but it also worried me how far I'd be willing to go to be with him. When Cyrus' hand started to slide up my shirt my mind jumped to anxious, I'd never been with anyone so this was all new to me but he probably knew that. I gasped when I felt his hand cup my breast in his hand it felt right but I knew I didn't want to do this with him in the bottom of a plane full of convicts \"Cyrus\" I sighed as I pulled away from him but he didn't put me back down. \"I can't do this here\" I whispered as he nodded and kissed me softly \"I know\" he agreed as he finally let me back down and I leaned up for another kiss like it was a start of an addiction. I put my hand to my mouth and felt the swell of my lip and smiled as Cyrus looked through some of the boxes until he pulled out a stuffed rabbit and put it in his back pocket. Cyrus grabbed my arm and looked at me seriously again \"No more lying Sweetheart\" I nodded quickly I was over trying to help and think about everyone else, now I just wanted to focus on Cyrus and me. I followed Cyrus to the metal ladder and smiled when he helped me up just like Nathan did before, pulling out his gun Cyrus turned the music off making everyone quieten down. I watched as I stood by Nathan who looked with a frown \"I'm not upset with you\" he explained as he wrapped an arm around my shoulder \"Plus you look like you had a real good talkin' to down there\" he sniggered as I rolled my eyes at him noticing the obvious meaning \"Men\". A/N: Just so you all know most of the gifs I put in my stories are mine unless they are stamped with another creators name, FearlessNikki is the name i use on my gifs because it's the name I use on my makeagif account. Also I know I put in a lot of fluffiness in this chapter but I couldn't help myself haha, I'm not sure if Cyrus is too out of character for you guys or not? Maybe you want more or maybe it's too much and not Cyrus-y enough for you? Let me know what you think?[Chapter 22] Everyone stood as Cyrus held the gun in his hand threateningly \"Someone alerted the authorities at Carson City, someone told them about our Lerner rendezvous, Someone even killed poor Billy Bedlam\" My eyes flicked over to where Cameron was sat looking at me, he knew. \"Now, could this all be a coincidence? Perhaps. Then someone went and tied a rope to our plane. So I ask you, what is going on?\" I watched as Cyrus walked down the plane looking very deadly right now. \"And I answer. We have a traitor in our midst. Now, how do we flush a traitor?\" I watched as Cyrus grabbed Sally from one of the cages as she screamed, running forward Nathan grabbed me as I gasped. \"Cyrus no! You promised\" I screamed at him as he held the very person he knew meant a lot to me, we had literally just talked about my wanting to save her and now he's using her for leverage \"You promised!\" I shouted struggling against Nathan who shushed me gently. Cyrus turned to me still holding Sally's hair making he wince \"You lied to me and now this is your punishment\" he growled pushing Sally away and aiming a gun at her head \"at the count of three I will find out who is on my team and who is not\" I kept struggling against Nathan I couldn't care less about Cameron and Odell but not Sally I couldn't let her die \"That would be one, two-\" Odell stood up and walked towards us \"Wait! It was me. It was me\" he told Cyrus who looked over to Cameron . \"Don't listen to him, man. T-T-The insulin made him crazy\" Cameron stuttered as he stood by his friend \"You have been near death the entire trip?\" Cyrus told Odell who nodded his head with a smile \"Yeah, motherfucker, it was me\". Cameron still stood by Odell he now looked worried and sweating \"No, he's, he's flipped out, man. He's nuts\" Odell walked closer and began taunting Cyrus who still had his gun trained on Sally. \"It's pretty clever, huh, bitch?\" Suddenly Cyrus turned and shot Odell in the stomach \"No, that's clever!\" he shouted as Cameron and Sally both ran to the wounded man. Cyrus pulled out the letter Nathan had found \"My daddy is coming home on July 14th. My birthday is July 14th. I'm gonna see my daddy for the first time ever on July 14th.\" Cyrus read out loud mocking Cameron's daughter as he walked to the back of the plane which was still open. \"Make a move, and the bunny gets it\" he calls out and holds his gun to the pink bunny's head, looking behind him I saw a helicopter \"Cyrus look out!\" I screamed as the helicopter started firing at him, Cyrus turned and started firing back at the helicopter. Nathan pushed me to the floor as bullets began to hit inside of the plane \"Go back to the cockpit baby girl\" he shouted to me and this time I didn't argue, I really didn't want more bullet holes in my body especially since the first one hurt so much. I sat up ready to make a dash to the cockpit when more bullets started to rain into the plane I gave a quick glance over to where Cameron, Sally, and O'Dell were and wished I hadn't \"Sally! No!\" I screamed when I saw holes appear in her body, she'd been shot. I shrieked when her body fell to the floor \"SALLY!\" I rushed over to her not caring about the danger of being shot myself, I prayed she was still alive , dropping to the floor I pulled her to my chest and cradled her against me sobbing when I saw her eyes wide open. I wailed when I noticed her eyes had turned glassy and empty, she was gone, she'd left me , \"Nicole?\" Cyrus shouted confused when he saw me crying until he looked at the still form in my arms \"Sweetheart?\". Staring down at the person who had become like a mother to me dead in my arms turned my sadness into anger, they had done this to me , her own team had killed her and now we were going to make them pay. Closing Sally's eyes I turned to see Cameron looking at me sadly he knew how I felt about Sally \"I'm sorry\" he whispered as I glared at him \"You told her you were going to save her, save us\" I growled at him as I dropped Sally's body, she wasn't in there anymore \"You failed Poe\". Standing I gave Sally one last look before making my way to the cockpit walking through all the destruction going on \"What's going on out there darlin'\" Swamp asked as I calmly walked through the door and sat in the seat next to his. \"Two helicopters are shooting at us,\" I told him as he tried to keep the plane steady \"You okay there darlin'?\" Swamp asked as I sat in the chair \"I've never been better\" I emotionlessly grinned at the Texan man feeling a new purpose in life, I felt like the last thing keeping my sanity together was gone. Listening to all the chaos in the plane I closed my eyes and relaxed knowing we'd be fine, Cyrus was unbeatable or so I thought until I heard his booming voice shouting from behind the door \"NO! POE!\" I opened my eyes wondering what the hell was going on when Poe burst through the door \"Land this thing!\". Swamp turned to look at Cameron confused \"Where the hell is the Virus?\" he asked when Cameron leaned forward and grabbed the radio before looking back at Swamp \"I'm the new captain. Put this thing down\". Moving to stand Cameron put his hand on my shoulder and pushed me back down as he put the radio up to his mouth \"Don't fire\" he drawled into the radio and I looked back at the door still hearing Cyrus' screaming voice \"What have you done to Cyrus?\" I growled to Cameron who spared me a glance before looking away again \"Who is this?\" \"Identify yourself\" two voices shout over each other and I recognize one as Vince's \"This is Cameron Poe\" Cameron recites as he looks back to the door when Cyrus' voice gets louder \"Poe! Poe!\". Hearing the anger in Cyrus' voice along with the sound of bullets hitting metal I jumped up from my seat when Cameron took his hand off me \"I said what did you do\" Cameron ignored me once again and looked down at Swamp \"Land this thing now!\". \"All right, Poe, the Las Vegas Airport it's just past the strip. It's right there, man. You can make it. All the runways are cleared. Come on, do it, Poe\" I heard Vince say over the radio and knew it was now or never. \"I can't let you do this Poe\" I snap at the Texan man who I respected only hours ago but now I can see he was in the way of my happiness and he was the one whose fault this was, if he wasn't here none of this would have happened. Kicking him in the midriff I smirked when he tumbled out of the cockpit door as he groaned and got to his feet I sent a sucker punch to his jaw as I saw heard Nathan cheering me on \"Yes! Baby girl, do it!\". Watching Cameron fall back I heard Swamp laugh from behind me obviously talking to Vince on the radio \"Poe's a lil' busy getting his ass kicked by a girl, We got one engine shot to shit zero fuel, and we're droppin' too fast. The strip's where I'm gonna land. Only the word is crash\". The plane suddenly bounced and I fell forward onto the metal door hitting my head in the process as Cameron got up \"Nicole?\" he whispered and I groaned unhappily, I just attacked him and he was still making sure I was okay. Crawling away I held onto the metal part of the walkway when I felt the plane descending as Cameron ran back into the cockpit \"Wake up Cyrus!\" I heard Johnny shout. I looked through the metal bars I was holding onto and saw Cyrus lay on the floor unconscious \"We are fucked\". A/N: What does everyone think of Sally's death? Does anyone else thing Cyrus' death was totally ridiculous in this film? or is it just me? Like who survives going through an overpass and then being electrocuted? Also how does he end up in a construction site? All of that scene totally confused the shit out of me.[Chapter 23] Sitting on the floor in front of Cyrus' cell I smiled when I see him lay in his cot, one of his eyes open and a heavy sigh comes from him \"You know, my dear, it isn't safe for a little girl to walk through these woods alone.\" he tells me as he sits up with a small smirk on his face quoting Little Red Riding Hood. \" My daddy is asleep,\" I told him quietly as I held my drawing in my hands waiting to give it to him, Cyrus' eyes lowered to the paper that was quivering in my hands as I shook from excitement \"and what do you have there?\" Cyrus questioned as he mimicked my sitting position from his side of the glass door. \" I made it for you in arts and crafts\" I squeaked happily as I slid the paper under the door with a grin \"It's us\" I said when he looked down at the paper excitedly \"I can see that sweetheart\" Cyrus acknowledged as a smile starts to grow on his face \"Just us?\" he questioned when he looked up from the paper. I nodded quickly giving the older man a sweet smile \"Yep, and look we're holding hands\" I exclaimed putting my finger on the glass in the direction of the paper \"Miss Honey says we have to hold hands with our loved ones so we can keep them safe and they can keep us safe too\". Cyrus looked up from the paper and gave me another one of his rare smiles but then looked back down at the picture in confusion \"Is that a beach?\" he asked turning the paper in his hands a few times. \" Uh huh, because we can go to the beach together when you get out of here, and we can make sandcastles and swim in the sea. You are still leaving here right?\" I whispered to Cyrus my eyes beginning to water thinking of him being in here forever. \" When I heard they were building Feltham, the new big prison, I knew they were going to send me there, locked up for 24 hours a day, I also knew I'd never see it, I am no longer willing to live just for the privilege of breathing. Do you understand that?\" Cyrus asked his eyes looking over my face. I shrugged I knew they were going to send him to another place, he had already told me that but the rest of it confused me \"What's a privilege?\" I questioned as Cyrus sighed rubbing his eyes \"Oh to be five again\" he muttered before looking at me seriously. \" This has been years in the making, and nothing is going to stop it, no one will stop me from getting to you\" Cyrus explained and it made me happy to know Cyrus wanted to stay with me just as much as I wanted to stay with him, he's my hero. \" Prison tries to kill everything that's evil inside a man Nicole, That's it's sole purpose. Sometimes, though it works the other way around and everything good inside dies\" Cyrus says his voice sounding rough. \" I hadn't had a good thought in years, Sweetheart. Not one, until two months ago\" he informed me as I looked up at him with my eyebrows screwed together \"Two months ago?\" I repeated trying to think about what could have made him have happy thoughts. \" Yes, two months ago you literally ran into my life and one way or another we will be free\". \"Sweetheart\" I hear over the ringing in my ears along with the feeling of being shook, opening my eyes I saw Cyrus and Nathan stood above me looking worse for ware. \"What happened?\" I groaned as I touched something wet on my hand before bringing my hand back and seeing blood \"The plane crashed now let's move\" Cyrus explained before lifting me up to my feet. \"We crashed?\" I repeated as I followed him to the middle of the plane where he pushed out a metal emergency exit and stuck his head in and quickly back out \"Let's go\" Cyrus informed the few prisoners who had followed us. \"Listen to me carefully I want you to follow me no matter what happens, okay?\" Cyrus told me keeping his voice low as I nodded quickly \"Okay\" I realized this was it, he was making sure we'd find a way to get out together. Cyrus climbed out of the hatch and pulled my hand to follow him, feeling the glass under my arms I flinched a little but nothing was going to keep me from him, not when we had come so far. Army crawling under the plane I felt my blood boil when I heard all the sirens and chatter from the police, my new found hatred for them was showing. Following Cyrus around the plane, we all froze when people rushed around not truly noticing us \"What do we do now?\" Nathan questioned as we looked around. \"Cyrus\" I spoke up and pointed to the stationary fire trucks that weren't being used \"Good idea sweetheart\" Cyrus muttered before grabbing my hand and rushing over to the trucks. \"Swamp you drive\" Cyrus called as he walked me around the other side of the truck \"and you sit in here\" he instructed and moved his hand to open the door of the fire truck when I pulled him into a rough kiss. Cyrus pushed me against the cold metal making me moan before opening the door and giving me a small spank on the butt when I climbed up into the cab with Swamp. \"Ready Darlin'?\" Swamp smirked revving the truck \"How did you get the keys?\" I laughed as he took off knocking cars out of the way in the process, Swamp just grinned and laughed. Looking out the window I saw the carnage Swamp was leaving behind us and let out a loud laugh \"Oh yeah real inconspicuous\" I told him as he began to laugh with me \"As long as we get a long way from here I really don't care\". Looking in the mirror next to my window I laughed to myself as I noticed Nathan had somehow found himself a fireman's jacket and was swinging from the side handrail \"It's really happening, we're going to be free\". A/N: So I don't know if anyone read the authors note from the last chapter but I wrote a bit about Cyrus' death and how unbelievable it was, so now I'm struggling to write about that bit but make it more believable. So if anyone has any ideas or anything please let me know![Chapter 24] Laughing wildly I squealed when we crashed into a bus stop \"Hole in one!\" Swamp laughed along with me until he let out a groan \"We got company\" I frowned until I heard sirens behind us, looking in the mirror again I noticed police bikes following us. \"Fuck\" I swore as I bounced around on the seat as Swamp swerved and hit more objects \"Don't we have anything up here?\" I asked him looking around for some type of weapon \"Don't worry Darlin, the virus can handle them\" Swamp insisted as I sighed angrily. Winding down my window I put my head out to see what was going on \"Do something Nathan!\" I call as more police bikes start following us, Nathan starts to shoot at them but the bullets bounce off their little shields. My eyes wondered around the part of the truck I could see before looking at Swamp \"Can you see Cyrus?\" I question him quickly as my heart began to thump when he shook his head \"Shit! What if he fell off, what if we've left him behind?\" I shouted leaning back out of the window to shout to Nathan. \"Yes!\" I cheer when I see water being sprayed from the top of the truck and hitting one of the police officers and I breathed heavily when I realized Cyrus must be stood on top of the truck \"Be careful\" I whispered knowing he'd wouldn't be able to hear me even if I shouted it. I let out a loud laugh when I saw the other police officer fly back off his bike when the stream of water hit him \"Oooh that looked like it hurt\" I sniggered until I saw who was driving on the other two bikes. \"It's fucking Poe and Larkin,\" I told Swamp as I quickly looked back into the cab, moving my head back out of the window I swore seeing Vince shooting and hoped Cyrus hadn't been hurt, luckily Vince had run out of bullets and threw the gun away. \"Be careful Swamp!\" I called when I noticed Nathan struggling to keep himself on the side of the truck \"I'm trying\" Swamp shouted back but the swerving didn't stop \"Hold on Nathan\" I yelled to him but I knew my words would do little to help him until we lost the wonder twins. I noticed Poe lift himself up higher on the bike \"What is he?\" my eyes widen when he disappears from my line of view but the bike continues to speed and heads towards Nathan who begins to yell \"Nathan\" I scream when the bike collides with him creating a small explosion throwing the truck forward. Swamp grabs my leg as I sob and pulls me back in the cab \"What the fuck was that!\" he exclaimed looking out of his window \"It's Nathan...\" I started but couldn't finish, I knew what had happened to him and now I'd lost two people. Rolling up my window I started to lash out and hit everything I could as tears cascaded down my face \"I'm going to fucking kill him!\" I shrieked turning to Swamp who looked at me with pity and grabbed my arm as I turned back to my door determined to end Poe. \"Let Cyrus deal with him Darlin'\" Swamp advised as I hit my window breaking down again, wiping my eyes I felt another piece of myself break away \"He's gone\" I muttered trying to coming to terms that I'd never see him again, Poe had taken that away from me. Hearing footsteps on the top of the cab I looked at Swamp at the same time as he looked at me equally confused \"What the hell is that?\" I asked him as he shrugs and turns his eyes back to the road until an ax is embedded into the roof of the cab again and again. Through the small hole I could see Vince's face \"You pull over !\" he shouted to Swamp who just laughed up at Vince \"Yeah, sure. How 'bout this?\" Swamp taunted before quickly turning the steering wheel and making the truck swerve again. Vince obviously hadn't seen me in the truck with Swamp through the small hole and I laughed knowing he was probably worrying about me \"Idiot\" I clucked as I crossed my arms with a smirk, I was exactly where I needed to be. Seeing something metal being shoved into the ax made hole I frowned until water began raining from it making me shriek, he was trying to flood us out \"I don't wanna drown\" I cried out as the water made it hard for us to see out of the window \"Vince!\" I called but he couldn't hear me over the sound of the water. Swamp tried to wipe the window with his arm as I tried to keep my head above the water, being so much shorter than him it was a struggle, pushing the metal hose back up I screamed when Vince pushed it back harder. Hitting the top of the cab I knew Vince wouldn't answer, he didn't even know I was here but I had to do something \"Fuck! I'm going to murder them all whilst they sleep\" I fumed as I pulled my hair out of its ponytail as it started to get heavy from the water. Coughing and spluttering I knew I had to move fast before the water got deeper, feeling the truck thump against something I pushed open my door as Swamp flew forward through the window \"Oh fuck\" I screamed as I pushed myself out of the cab and cried out as the hit the road, bumping a few times before coming to a stop. Sitting up I watched as Vince jumped from the side of the truck too, bouncing off the top of a car on the way down. Jumping up I started to run down the road after the fire truck when I noticed Cyrus was laying on top of the ladder and Poe looking down at him \"Cyrus!\" I screamed not ready to lose someone else, especially him. A/N: Okay so this is the end of the movie story line and the next few chapters will be written off of my own ideas, so if there is anything you'd like to see happen please let me know, things will be different from the original movie ending, some people will die and some won't.[Chapter 25] Feeling dread bubble in my stomach I could do nothing but watch as the love of my life was being driven towards a crosswalk that stretches across the street, the happy neon lights were lit and unsuspecting people were crossing over it as Cyrus' body plunged through the glass and out the other side. \"Holy shit\" I breathed when a huge explosion of glass and metal come from the walkway, hearing the sound of sirens getting louder I looked up expecting to see Cyrus but he was nowhere in sight \"Cyrus?\" I whispered as cars started to whizz down the road. Picking up a shard of glass I held it tight in my hand ready to defend myself if needed, I crept passed fence of the building site trying to get out of sight in case Larkin or Poe saw me and tried to take me with them, I need to find Cyrus. Walking backward with my eyes watching the alleyway I had come from I screamed when I felt a hand over my mouth and my body quickly being pressed to the wooden fence of the building site, my eyes widened and my scream stopped when I saw who had a hold of me. \"Shh princess\" Cyrus hushed as he looked around the wall, looking back at me his hand dropped from my mouth and I jumped on him with a cry, \"I thought you were dead\" I sobbed as he held me tight. \"You're not getting rid of me that easily\" Cyrus smirked as pulled me back before looking around suspiciously \"What are we going to do now\" I asked as I started to panic \"we've got no plane, the police are everywhere and Nathan is...\" letting out a sob I still couldn't believe he was gone forever. Cyrus rubbed my arms \"why are you all wet?\" I frowned at him \"Not now Cyrus. Just think of a way out of this\" I groaned as he looked deep in thought, I knew he was trying to think of a logical way out of this and that is what he does best but my hope of getting away with him had shattered completely. \"We need to find a car\" He finally says looking down at me \"To go where?\" I asked shivering as my clothes clung to my body from being soaked by Larkin, Cyrus looked down at me before grabbing my hand and guiding me back to the road. We hid in the shadows as Cyrus looked around carefully, everyone seemed to be focusing on the fire truck and finding Cyrus \"Follow me\" Cyrus mumbled as he stealthily walked over to a lone car sitting on the road. Creeping towards the car with Cyrus I watched as he skilfully broke into the car without alerting anyone, hope was slowly starting to creep back in until a voice rang out freezing me to the spot \"Nicole?\". Cyrus stood tall glaring over my shoulder as I turned slowly to see my father standing behind us looking terrified \"baby, come here, get away from that madman\" I looked up at Cyrus whose glare hadn't left my father's figure. \"Well... well Tommy boy, you got us\" Cyrus drawled as I moved away from him and slowly walked over to my father who smiled nastily as the man behind me \"Good girl\" my father commented as he reached for me. Hugging my father I glanced back to Cyrus who looked betrayed and I knew I was making the right decision, I was going to be with the person who cared for me, moving out of my father's arms I could almost see him gloating at Cyrus. Grabbing the lapels of his suit I smiled at him as he looked down at me \"I'm sorry, it's not me, it's you\" I told him as I threw him head first into the building next to us, I watched him as he crumpled into a heap Looking around I found a lone brick obviously from the industrial site and held it above his head, taking a gulp I threw the brick at my father as hard as I could and watched as blood started to flow from his head. I turned and saw Cyrus calculating the scene in front of him before opening his arms making me smile as I run into them willingly \"You didn't doubt me, did you?\" I questioned the man I had fallen in love with as he laughed out loud. Pulling myself closer to what felt safe, what felt like home \"They're disgusting creatures all of them\" I spat angrily as tears rolled down my cheeks \"They all need to pay\" Cyrus tipped my head up and brushed my drying hair away from my face \"And they will now let's get you out of here\". Getting into the car I watched as Cyrus pulled out some wires from under the steering wheel and touched them together making them spark \"Is it working?\" I asked unsure until I heard the familiar roar of a car starting. \"Did you ever doubt me\" he smirked as I smiled at him knowingly \"never for a second\" we both looked at each other for a second before a bang made me jump \"Nicole!\" I screamed seeing my bloody father looming over the door. \"Cyrus!\" I screamed as I moved myself closer to him not knowing what to do, I thought I had killed my dad, I guess the old man was more resilient than I knew \"Wait here\" Cyrus growled as he opened his door. Watching him walk around the car I wondered how he would get rid of my father, I knew Cyrus had more death takings on his hands than anyone and wouldn't have any trouble ending my dad but I was still curious at how it would go down. Opening my door I saw my father swaying as Cyrus laughed at him mockingly \"What did you do to her?\" My dad boomed motioning to me as I leaned against the car door passively \"Well we changed the story, the big bad wolf took little red and made her his\" Cyrus bragged as my father held onto his wound looking furious. The sun was going down more and the light was dimming but it was bright enough to see the 3 of us standing together but unless you saw the red of my dad's blood that seeped through his fingers you wouldn't know what was going on. \"That's my daughter, Cyrus, please\" my father begged as I frowned \"Nicole, baby, I can get you help. We don't have to tell anyone about this\" I looked at him furious \"Help I don't need help, I need to be with Cyrus\" I fumed as Cyrus who glanced at me before laughing spitefully as he turned back to my father. \"I don't think she wants to go with you Tommy boy\" Cyrus taunted as my dad tried to move passed him \"Come with me and we can tell the police together everything that happened and where all the convicts are going\" dad whispered to me as I felt shocked. \"That's what it is, isn't it\" I questioned walking closer to him feeling empty \"You only want me because he wants me and you think I'll help you find the others\" standing in front of my father I looked into his eyes as he stuttered. Looking up at him emotionless I couldn't help but feel anything but disgust and anger at him, the way he left me to rot during the riot, never noticing when I had gone missing or even taking an interest in my academic life. I looked into his eyes and felt nothing, no love or empathy, I just felt like a total stranger to this man now and now that he was trying to take me away from the man who loves me and has protected me my entire life infuriated me. A smile broke out onto my face as I shoved the glass shard into his chest like a dagger \"Nicole?\" he gasped as we both lowered to the floor together as he looked up at me with wide eyes as I held him tight, twisting the glass inside of him \"Goodnight daddy\". Watching him take his last breath I stood ripping the shard out his chest and throwing it down a storm drain, I walked back over to Cyrus who grinned at me and pulled me into him tightly \"That's my girl\" he whispered as I felt myself fill with emotion again, I always felt better in Cyrus' arms. Standing in my man's arms I felt like nothing could hurt us now, nothing could stop us being together... or so I thought \"Cyrus Grissom! Stop right there!\".[Chapter 26] Cyrus and I froze until we both turned to see a thin shaking police officer pointing his gun at Cyrus, he looked no older than I was and seemed to be terrified of the man by my side \"well, well is this the Calvary coming to take me in?\" Cyrus mocked as the young officer continued to shake. \"I'm here... I'm ... I'm here to apprehend you\" the officer stuttered and swallowed his hands quivering causing the gun in his grip to shake as Cyrus laughed at him \"Cyrus\" I called as he began to take steps towards the officer all traces or mirth gone. I watched in horror as Cyrus pressed his chest again the gun \" Cyrus \" I called again pleadingly I couldn't lose him so close to freedom \"Don't worry Sweetheart\" Cyrus comforted his eyes still trained on the younger mans. The man's eyes quickly flickered to mine only for a second but it was long enough for Cyrus to notice \"You don't look at her, ever !\" he hissed without raising his voice but the threat was still there \"now shoot me\" both mine and the officers eyes widened at Cyrus' request. \"come on, do it\" Cyrus goaded as the young officer just held his gun tighter it was obvious that he had never shot anyone before, this was probably his first time drawing his gun \"DO IT\" Cyrus roared causing the man to jump. Cyrus ripped the gun out of the officer's hands and turned it on him \" please \" the officer begged but I knew it would do him no good, this was Cyrus the Virus he was dealing with \"radio your boss and tell him this area was clear, you saw nothing \". The too young looking officer nodded quickly and pressed the button on his radio and dispatched Cyrus' message, that would give us more time to get away from both the media circus and the fleet of police \" 10-4, thanks Garrison \" a voice called through the small radio on ' Garrison's ' shoulder. Before Garrison could talk a shot rang out and his body slumped back with a hole in his head, I watched as Cyrus lowered the gun and watched me as I peered down at the newly deceased police officer, this was my life now. \"Come on\" Cyrus directed gently as he walked back over to me and pressed a kiss to my head \"let's go\" he whispered into my hair as I wrapped my arms around his waist needing to be closer to him, the sight of him killing someone hadn't fazed me if anything it made me happy seeing him willing to do anything for us to be together. Feeling his hand wrap around mine I let him lead me back to the car passing my father's wide-eyed prone body, it made me question if Garrison was that afraid of Cyrus he hadn't seen the murdered body of Warden Thomas Monroe. Cyrus opened the passenger door and waited for me to climb back into the car, shivering I wrapped my arms around my legs waiting for Cyrus to walk around the car and get in with me. Looking in the mirror I saw Garrison's body on the floor, his dead body, I noticed the blood around him but couldn't feel anything for the poor young officer who was simply in the wrong place at the wrong time. \"You okay Sweetheart?\" Cyrus questioned as I gave him a small smile and shrugged \"Nathan would have loved that\" I answered as a grin passed over Cyrus' face \"Yeah he would have\" glancing at him for a second I smiled when he pressed his lips onto mine whilst holding the back of my head. I knew he was trying to be gentle for me and that made me smile, the big bad Virus was trying not to hurt sweet little me \"we should go before they find him\" I say nodding to the officer before my lips turned into a snarl \"and before they find daddy dearest\". Cyrus smirked at me as he put the car in drive \"so what now?\" I question as I watch Cyrus start to drive \"plan C\" he says with a huff, he looked annoyed that he had to resort to whatever plan C was, I can only imagine how long it had taken to form the plan in the first place but that went down in flames. \"What's plan...\" I stopped my sentence dead with a scream when someone threw themselves on top of the car window shouting \"Hey Virus let me in!\" the southern faux pilot called as the car screech to a stop \"What the fuck Swamp!\" I shouted as the tall man climbed into the backseat with a wide smile on his face. Cyrus started the car again his jaw tightening as he glanced around \"were you followed\" he questioned Swamp Thing looking pissed I knew he was probably thinking about getting caught because of the redneck who was watching the two of us from the backseat like a toddler. \"No man, after I crashed I hid they were too busy going after you anyway\" Cyrus belted out a laugh as I smirked thinking about all the police, DEA agents and whoever else was there looking for us, they were chasing their own tales right now. \"Nice to see you're okay Darlin'\" Swamp added tapping me on the shoulder as I gave him a wry smile \"you too\" Cyrus quickly looked between Swamp and I with a raised eyebrow \"why are you both wet?\" letting out a small laugh I shook my head \"don't ask\". \"What are we gonna do about Poe?\" Swamp asked as I frowned at Cyrus, did we have to do anything about Poe?, we were so close to freedom now that I could practically smell the sand on the beach and cheap alcohol I could legally drink. But seeing the look on Cyrus' face and how his hand tighten on the wheel I knew this was something he wouldn't be able to let go of and I knew it was something that was inevitable, if it wasn't for Poe we would be in our own paradise right now and Nathan would be alive. Cyrus' eyes met mine questioningly as every memory of Poe ruining everything for us ran through my mind, Nathan's agonizing final scream rang in my ears and I just knew it was the right thing to do. I smirked as Cyrus and I spoke in sync \" Plan D \". ","Summary":" A little pitter patter of feet could be heard in the usually deserted halls of San Quentin State Pr"}]
