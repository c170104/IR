I didn't really want to create one, and everything on this engine can't be in second person, my original plan. (She is placed in an airtight crate full of assorted baked goods, and is being shipped to Alaska. There are small gaps, barely letting you get a fresh oxygen supply, but keeping you alive. A large golden retriever named Budderball, lays next to her) \"Man...\" Budderball groans as he lay on the hard wooden floor next to her. \"Are ya sure we can't eat any? They just smell so good!\" He licks his lips. She gives a disapproving stern look, and he goes back to laying uncomfortably. Twenty minutes later, Budderball perks up. \"I can't resist this anymore\" he yelps as he dives with what little room they have headfirst into the consumables. He immediately starts unwrapping a baked burrito, a common delicacy. He shoves it into his mouth in two bites, and proceeds to swallow. He continues this process until only a few goods are left between you two. She can only roll her eyes in disgust at his animal-like behavior. Eventually, he starts to feel drowsy and cuddles up against her on the side of the crate, and she has to give in. Pretty soon, they both lay asleep in the crate peacefully. She wakes up alarmed, as a strange gurgling noise filled the crate. Budderball, awake and visibly uncomfortable, was pulsing. His stomach only grew louder. \"I... I don't feel so good...\" he says in pain. His eyes are closed and his teeth clenched. He is still brushed next to her, but is leaning in the opposite direction. She looks for air holes, or any sort of gap in the crate, but their are none. It slowly dawns on her what is about to happen, and she shudders. Budderball's stomach has only become more aggressive, growling louder and more wet by the minute. \"I'm trying to hold it.\" Budderball gasps, at the sheer amount of pressure placed in his stomach. She tries not to jostle him around, as she searches for any sort of vent. By now Budderball is wincing, almost ready to expel the deadly fumes he had spent the last hour digesting. He turns to the side, close his eyes and grunts. His tail rises up. Suddenly, a bright orange cloud explodes out from behind him, and begins to fill the air. He opens his eyes, obviously relieved, and pants, out of breathe. The smell hits her like a bullet- She'd never smelt anything like it. She gags, and begins to search for any sort of way to stop the constantly growing aroma from spreading. Budderball, then curls up beside her, not at all bothered by the noxious gas he expelled. She looks towards him, and passes out. ","Summary":" [I do not own any characters.

It is an incredible story, there is no doubt about that. But the story about Buddy that will truly leave you with awe has yet to be told. I feel that it is my duty to spread my knowledge of this tale. The story began in Fernfield, Washington when Air Bud had just won the state championship with the Timberwolves basketball team. He was walking to the car with his owner when, suddenly, the trophy gave Buddy a new feeling. He could not explain it. Abruptly. He blurted out, \"I can talk!\" Josh Framm (Buddy's owner) stopped in his tracks. Had his dog just talked? No. He simple must have not been feeling well after the hard work he performed in the game. But soon, \"Did you hear me?\" Buddy exclaimed. \"I can talk!\" \"Buddy! How are you doing that?\" Josh said excitedly, but cautiously. \"I don't know! I... I just touched the trophy and I could talk.\" \"Let me see that,\" Josh demanded. He examined it, squinting at every little detail. \"Buddy, it says 'Hola' at the bottom of this trophy. We must travel to Spain to track down the origin of this spectacular gift you have been given.\" So they got on the next plane to Spain. \"There must be some kind of clue here,\" said Josh as he looked around Barcelona, Spain. Suddenly, an old, bald, and bearded man with a cane approached Josh and Buddy. I am a wizard and I sense a problem that be with you two. What be the problem?\" \"I can talk because of this trophy and we want to find out why,\" said Buddy. Buddy gave the wizard the trophy and his eyes glistened as he examined the mysterious object. \"Ah, yes. This trophy be holding many magical properties. But you not should be in Spain. You should be in Paris, France. So Josh and Buddy got on the next plane to Paris. Upon arrival, their first stop was the Eiffel Tower. But there was a crowd of people standing over a mile around the tower. Something wasn't right. Suddenly, Elvis flew out of the Eiffel Tower, wearing a black cape. \"It is I, Elvis, and I have returned from the dead to cause trouble. \"He was the one who put the spell on this trophy!\" Buddy shouted to Josh. \"Who said that? Someone speaks of my magic!\" \"It's me! You made me speak! But why?\" asked Buddy. \"You were a test to see if special dog powers work. And now I introduce my own magic dog!\" Suddenly, a humongous vicious dog appeared and knocked over the Eiffel Tower. Josh panicked, \"Buddy you must be able to do something about this!\" \"Ha ha, you fool! There is nothing you can do to stop me!\" Elvis shouted. But Elvis didn't know that he accidentally gave Buddy the power to stop evil. Buddy sensed that he had the power and he used it to send Elvis back to the dead. Then Josh and Buddy got pizza to celebrate. The end.

Even though he was the one who ate the peanut butter, he questioned who enjoyed the delivery. Guy flashed a winning smile, and Air Bud perked with intrigue. Josh may have been his best friend, but Guy had the most delicous frosted tips. Guy perched his sunglasses behind his ear and, for the first time since the peanut butter incident, spoke. \"You know, Buddy, I may be Guy Fieri of the Food Channel and shows such as that one that you watched once, but you are a fine dog.\" Air Bud barked in appreciation. \"And,\" Guy said, \" I have something very special to show you.\" Air Bud whimpered.

I have an OC, whose name is Stacy. She's also a Siberian husky, Shasta's sister. They look alike only she's a little too sassy and one of Rosebud's best friends. She's in love with B-dawg and sometimes even tries to flirt around with him. I do not own the buddies, only Stacy. Ok I think that's all I have to say so, enjoy! I sit by the window, feeling an empty heart. I didn't think I would miss Shasta, the Siberian husky puppy we met in Alaska, this much. I miss his sister, Stacy too, but Shasta is just…special. I watch the snow fall slowly and my brothers play in it. Speaking of them, they've changed so much. Buddha is more sociable. Budderball: more thinner. Mudbud…well…he's just plain Mudbud. There's one more change: B-dawg. I really don't understand him anymore. He's not very stuck-up to himself anymore He's braver and very protective with me. He's also just too serious. Should I have a little talk with him? After all, I am known for brightening someone's day. Not trying to be a show off or anything, but I am. \"Are you ok?\" a voice asked behind me. Before the wag of a tail, he was beside me. It was our younger brother, Buddha. \"I'm fine. Just a little tired\" I respond. \"You look empty and in deep though. There is nothing more dreadful than the habit of doubt. Doubt separates people. It is a poison that disintegrates friendships and breaks up pleasant relations. It is a thorn that irritates and hurts; it is a sword that kills\". His words always inspire me. \"Thanks, Buddha. That helps a lot\". \"So are you going to tell me what's wrong?\" he asked. I sighed and got ready. What should I tell him about? Missing Shasta or not understanding B-dawg? \"I miss the old B-dawg,\" I say. He nods. \" I agree. What happened to him?\" I just shrug and shake my head. \" You should probably go talk to him. You know, fix a smile upon his face\" My brother: a great adviser. I nod and stand up. Running out of the room, I ran downstairs and outside. I headed over to his owner's house. I went in through the doggy door, only to find him on the couch, taking in nap. Nope. He's usually kicking up moves with the radio on loudly. \"B-dawg, are you awake?\" I whisper. His eyes shot open and he sits up straight, waiting for what I had called him for. \"Yea. What's wrong?\". \"I want to ask you the same question\" I say back.

Cherry helped move the telescope and took a look. \"Let me see...\" she then said. A puppy's face came in front of the telescope which made her yelp in surprise and drop down to the ground. \"Domino!\" Patch laughed at his nephew. \"Hi, Uncle Patch!\" Domino smiled. Patch laughed and hugged the young puppy. \"Ah, Domino, good to see you.\" Domino smiled up to his favorite uncle. Cherry glared as she had fallen on the ground from the puppy's surprise. \"Great, another dog...\" \"Oh, hi, Cherry.\" Domino greeted. \"No, no, no, don't!\" Cherry protested, but Domino licked her face anyway. \"Gah, stop it..!\" \"Okay, Domino, stop licking her face.\" Patch chuckled. Domino soon stopped and smiled back to his uncle with his tongue out. \"Man, the stars are amazing, aren't they?\" Buddha's voice asked. \"Hi, Buddha.\" Patch smiled. \"Namaste.\" Buddha bowed his head with a smile back. \"Hey there, Buddha.\" Domino smiled. \"Ah, that's Domino...\" Buddha replied. \"Brother of Oddball and Little Dipper.\" \"Yep.\" Domino smiled. \"This is Buddha...\" Patch nodded to his nephew. \"I could tell based on how he talked.\" Domino replied to his uncle. \"Nice to meet you up close,\" Buddha told Domino. \"I just wish my siblings could see this.\" \"Maybe I'll meet them tomorrow.\" Domino said. \"Could work, there's a field trip for school tomorrow,\" Darla said to the Dalmatian puppy. \"We're gonna see a test launch for a spacecraft.\" \"But aren't pets not allowed on the field trip?\" Patch asked. Domino pouted to this as he really wanted to go along too. \"Yes, that's true.\" Cherry smirked at that factoid since she wasn't a dog person. Buddha soon whispered something to Patch and Domino. Patch and Domino listened, surprised that Buddha came up with something that would involve them and of course, B-Dawg, Budderball, Rosebud, and MudBud. \"It's getting late,\" Mo said to Darla. \"I think it's your bedtime.\" \"Aw! Ten more minutes!\" Darla pouted. \"No, Darla, it's time for bed.\" Atticus said. \"But, guys...\" Darla pouted. \"No buts, it's time to go to sleep.\" Cherry replied. \"I'll sing you Applejack's lullaby~\" Atticus told Darla. \"That made me cry the first time I heard it.\" Cherry whispered. \"I know.\" Atticus whispered back. Darla was stubborn about going to bed as she still wanted to stargaze, but it was late for someone her age and Atticus soon sang Applejack's lullaby for Apple Bloom for when she started to have nightmares about cutie marks, and where it helped her fall asleep. Atticus smiled as he then shut the door to let his little sister get some sleep, he then looked down to Patch. \"What're you up to?\" \"Nothing,\" Patch replied innocently. \"I'm just looking forward to spending time with the Buddies tomorrow.\" \"Really?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, yeah,\" Patch smiled. \"They look up to me, I am their dogfather after all.\" \"Alright.\" Atticus said. Patch then smiled as he went off to his own room and soon sighed in relief. \"That was close.\" Patch sighed. It was soon late and everyone went to bed, except for maybe Cherry who was up all night as usual. The next day would soon come. Domino kept pacing around instead of sleeping as he was anxious to see the Buddies all together. \"Domino, would you please sleep?\" Annie asked. \"I can't sleep,\" Domino replied. \"I wanna see the Buddies!\" \"But if you don't sleep, then you'll be too tired to play with them.\" Annie smiled. Domino pouted. \"She has a point, son, now get some sleep.\" Sammy mentored Domino. \"Alright.\" Domino frowned. \"Thanks, Sammy.\" Hallie smiled to her dog. Sammy nuzzled up against Hallie in thanks and then went to get some sleep himself. \"I hope they're fun and they all like me...\" Domino soon yawned and curled up into a ball by Sammy to get some sleep. \"Girls, are you awake?\" Elizabeth's voice called out before her footsteps were heard coming into her twins' bedroom as it was their bedtime. She soon opened the door to see if they were awake or asleep. Hallie and Annie quickly pretended to be asleep. Elizabeth smirked as she shook her head, she then came to her twins up close and gently tugged on their hair and patted their faces, she had never been happier to have both her daughters together instead of just one. \"Oh, uh, hi, Mom.\" Hallie smiled nervously. \"Oh, you're awake.\" Elizabeth smirked. \"Guess we're excited about tomorrow's field trip.\" Annie replied. \"Yeah, we get to see a real space shuttle get launched.\" Hallie smiled. \"Well, that is rawther exciting...\" Elizabeth had to agree as she smiled back to her twins. \"And Domino is excited to play with the Buddies.\" Annie smiled. \"I know, dears, I know,\" Elizabeth smiled back to her twin daughters. \"But you all have a big day tomorrow.\" \"We'll try to sleep.\" Annie said. \"Get some rest, your father and I are tired.\" Elizabeth smiled. Annie and Hallie hid giggles to that before they bundled down to get some sleep and soon enough, everyone was asleep. Domino smiled, he was very excited, but he soon fell asleep as he lay down next to Sammy. Before everyone knew it, it was the next morning for everyone. Domino was fast asleep and soon heard the sound of puppy barks and then looked out the window to see five golden retriever puppies meeting together. \"I gotta get moving.\" Domino said. Sammy, Hallie, and Annie were still asleep as Domino rushed outside to meet the Buddies. \"Hey!\" Domino smiled. The Buddies soon stopped to see him and smiled back. \"Siblings, this is the one called Domino, Oddball's brother.\" Buddha told his siblings. Budderball came up and sniffed Domino. \"Wow, you smell just like her!\" \"Uh, thanks?\" Domino said out of confusion. \"Hi, Domino.\" Rosebud smiled. \"Hey, I know you must be Rosebud.\" Domino smiled back. \"That's me.\" Rosebud replied. \"Hey, yo, so cool to meet more of Patch's fam!\" B-Dawg beamed. \"Uh, it's nice to meet you too, uh, dawg.\" Domino said. B-Dawg chuckled. \"I like your style.\" \"Come on, there's not a minute to spare!\" Buddha said before he then ran with them. \"Oh, yeah!\" The others remembered and went after him. MudBud took a stop and rolled around in some dirt. \"Is that really necessary?\" Domino asked. \"Aw, come on, a little dirt never hurt anybody, here, have some!\" MudBud replied before flicking dirt onto the Dalmatian. \"Yes, but this just means I have to take a bath.\" Domino said. At the school, the students were loading onto the bus for their big field trip today. Patch was waiting for the Buddies and Domino to arrive. Domino and the Buddies rushed over to the older Dalmatian. \"Ah, there you guys are.\" Patch smiled to his nephew and 'godpuppies'. \"Are we late?\" Domino asked. \"Nope, but we can't talk long, we better hustle.\" Patch replied. \"The window of opportunity is upon us,\" Buddha pointed to the backpacks in the back of the bus. \"Let's seize it!\" \"As in get into the vehicle now.\" Domino said. Patch and Domino ran ahead and the Buddies soon followed after them. Soon enough, they made it into the back of the bus while blending into the backpacks and no one seemed to notice. \"I wonder who the teacher is?\" Patch whispered. Domino smiled as he stood close by his uncle as the Buddies helped themselves inside. \"Well, we are the lucky Fernfield class,\" The teacher smiled to her class. \"We're going to see a real live spaceship rocket launch!\" \"YEAH!\" The students cheered in response. \"So that's where you're taking us, Patch?\" Rosebud asked. \"Uh-huh.\" Patch nodded. \"Surprise!\" Domino added. \"Vision Enterprises is going to make space travel possible for anyone.\" The teacher smiled to her students. \"I think I'm in bagged lunch heaven,\" Budderball said as he was in the backpacks as he moaned hungrily. \"Oh, Mama...\" \"Let me guess, food is his favorite, right?\" Domino asked the other Buddies. \"You have no idea...\" Patch muttered to his nephew as Budderball bit into a sandwich and gobbled it down. \"Wow.\" Domino groaned. The teacher soon sniffled and began to sneeze. \"Bless you, ma'am,\" Amber said to the teacher. \"Do you have a cold?\" \"I-I'm not sure, but my allergy to dander is really acting up!\" The teacher replied before having a sneezing fit. \"Dander?\" Darla asked. \"Yes,\" The teacher sniffled. \"It's basically the substance all around an animal like their fur.\" 'Uh-oh...Now I understand why we weren't allowed to come.' Patch thought to himself. \"We have dogs at home,\" Hallie said as she sat with Annie. \"Their fur must've gotten on our clothes.\" \"That must be it.\" Annie agreed. The ride was a bit long, but it would soon be worth it.

All Air Buddies characters, places, etc., belong to Disney. Air Buddies All Rights Reserved.* In the town of Fernfield, it was a nice spring day as The Buddies met in their usual spot in the park. They were discussing what they should do for their day. \"We could play fetch...\" Budderball suggested. \"That won't work. Who would throw the ball? Besides, we would all probably go after it alll at once anyways. Let's just meditate and enjoy the sunshine. ... Uuuuuuumm,\" Budda replied before he started to meditate. \"Yeah, then we could roll in the mud to cool off!\" Mudbud added with excitement. \"No thank you. We don't want to have baths when we all just got up,\" Rosebud pointed out. Mudbud sighed, but agreed. \"Then what can we do?\" B-Dawg asked, starting to wonder if there was anything interesting to do. \"We could play hide and seek,\" Mudbud suggested. \"Yeah,\" his siblings agreed, thinking it was a good start to the day. B-Dawg decided he would be the one to look for his siblings, and he closed his eyes. Rosebud, Budda, Budderball, and Mudbud ran to go find hiding places. But they had to be careful where they hid, it couldn't be too obvious. Mudbud decided to hide in the backyard behind the clothesline, Budda hid in the laundry room near a pile of laundry, Rosebud hid in the living room by a chair, and Budderball hid in the family room by the couch. \"Five, four, three, two, one. Ready or not, here I come!\" B-Dawg said as he went looking for his siblings. He searched the front yard first, then the backyard. He would have found Mudbud had his brother not moved whenever B-Dawg got near him. B-Dawg gave up and went inside. He decided to look in the kitchen for Budderball; It wouldn't be surprising if he was trying to grab a quick snack during the game. Nothing. \"Huh? I thought for sure Budderball would be here,\" B-Dawg told himself before going yo look elsewhere. Unknown to any of the pups, the chief had just came out with a turkey on a plate for the human family. Golden brown and fresh to eat on or off the bone, with fruit, bread and water to complete the meal for later on. This normal would be no problem... if it weren't for Budderball's nose. As he waited, Budderball's nose picked up the smell of the turkey, begging him to visit the delicious, cooked bird. It was an invitation to a food party in his belly. And he didn't mean for this invitation to go unaccepted. Checking to see that his brother wasn't around, Budderball quietly snuck out of his hiding place and into the kitchen. Sure enough, he smelled the turkey here! Budderball jumped onto the table and started to eat the cooked turkey. Besides, its not like B-Dawg would mind. He was just taking a bite...or two...or three...or ten... B-Dawg kept looking, hoping he would find someone soon. How hard could it be to hide in a house they had played in for years? He searched every place he could find. Nobody in the family room, so he checked the living room. As he did, it didn't take long for him to find Rosebud. \"Found you!\" B-Dawg said as he gently touched his sister. Rosebud jumped before seeing it was her brother. She then calmed down. \"Nice job B-Dawg. Want me to help you find the others?\" Rosebud offered. \"Yes please. Just don't give them away. I want it to be a fair game,\" B-Dawg told her. Rosebud understood and they went searching. Meanwhile, Budderball was quietly enjoying his turkey meal. He had managed to eat some of the outside part, but now he wanted to get the inside cooked parts. Hopefully without tearing the meal to bits. He tried to dig his way in, but it was too small. He then pulled the back legs of the bird to the sides, ate the big, golden brown parts, and tried to get a bigger opening. He did, and found he could eat his way into the ribs part of the bird. He just had to eat more of the meat. Eventually, he got closer and closer to the ribs and was getting more full. If Budderball was a video game, he would be PAC-Man... and he was winning. Soon, he got to the ribs and kept eatting until he got full. Man, who knew the inside of cooked food was better than the outside bits. Budderball then decided to go back out of the turkey and go back to hiding. \"Okay. Back to the... uh oh!\" Budderball said as he tried to exit, going backwards. It was not working. Budderball tried to get out but it was no use. He wiggled and jumped but he was still in the turkey. He tried to stand on his back paws, but fell off the table and onto the floor. As he struggled, Budderball looked more like a cooked turkey with the tail and feet of a pup that had grown out of the back legs. It was dark, delicious, greasy, and weird being trapped in the turkey, and Budderball needed help. \"Help! Help me!\" Budderball called out as he tried to get free of his golden brown trap, his voice sounding more like akward gobbles coming from a Frankenstein turkey. He blindingly wondered the kitchen and headed out to the back yard. Budda sat behind the pile of laundry, thinking if he had really picked a good hiding spot. It just seemed so simple. Maybe a different hiding spot would be better. Unfortunately, Budda did not have time to think of a good backup hiding spot, so, he jumped into the basket of clean laundry, and dug into the pile of clothes! B-Dawg walked curiously into the laundry room and looked around. He thought he had heard something, but then decided to leave. Budda waited until he thought the room was empty and went to get out of thd laundry basket. However, he accidentally got stuck in a sheet, which prevented him from getting out of the laundry basket. He just hoped the others were doing better. ","Summary":" Chapter 1: Hide and Seek *I only own the ideas for the story.

RYV The Los Angeles, California sunlight was just beginning to dim into sunset as Terri Fletcher finally pulled herself away from the multitude of goodbyes to the friends she had made while at Bristoll Hillman Music Conservatory. She had a handful of small paper scraps, each one scrawled across with phone numbers, email addresses, and snail mail addresses. Three different ways to keep in touch with people who changed her life over the course of three weeks. She looked around for a specific dark head and, not seeing it, turned to her father. \"Can we hang out here for just a little while longer?\" \"Terri,\" her father started, already starting to do a negative shake of his head. \"It won't be long, I promise, Dad.\" She pouted slightly, the most defiance against him that she usually showed. \"It's really important to me.\" \"Terri.\" \"Let her go, Simon. Terri has been running around the campus for the last three weeks and she has done just fine. I'm sure a few more minutes won't hurt much.\" Nodding his reluctant acquiescence, he braced himself as Terri flung herself at him before rushing past the thinning crowds and into the building. The halls were strangely deserted, the rooms empty as she passed them and looked in through the windowed doors. There were no students practicing, talking, or laughing. There were no teachers making their way through the corridors to look for mischief or problems. The only music was drifting in from outside, a low eerie haunting, an echo of the life that Terri had known there previously. Hurrying through them, uncomfortable being there when it was so quiet, she quickly made her way to the music room that she had spent the majority of her time working in. She was in luck; the person she was looking for was in there. \"Mr. Torvald?\" \"Ms. Fletcher. Come in.\" He stopped packing up the belongings he was taking with him that evening and turned to lean against the desk. \"And to what do I owe the pleasure? I thought it'd be a year before I saw you again.\" She moved forward before stopping halfway to his desk and bit her lower lip slightly. \"That DVD you kept mentioning…\" \"What about it?\" \"What do you guys do with all the submission materials?\" \"The ones from those people that got into the summer music program, we save them. Just in case, any of you guys become rich and famous. We want our props, after all.\" Terri laughed and shook her head at the total and complete oddness of her music teacher. \"Why are you asking, Terri?\" \"I was hoping that I could get it… or a copy?\" Mr. Torvald nodded and crossed his arms in front of his chest. \"I'll give it to you on one condition.\" She looked around and shrugged. \"What?\" \"That you tell me what happened to the girl on the DVD and why it's so important to you.\" Terri took a deep breath. She should have known that knowledge was the condition the teacher would make. \"Why?\" \"I don't like having a student floundering in class. I don't like having a student with problems that I don't know and can't help them with, no matter how badly she needs it or I want to.\" He shrugged back at her. \"Call me crazy.\" She laughed then, the slightly watery laugh proving what was just below the surface. \"A lot of people do, you know.\" He chuckled and moved over to one of the desks that were still set up from class. \"Yeah, but I'm still the cool teacher,\" he answered, drawing out the cool as he gestured to the desk next to him and then turned his own so he was facing her. \"Now, are you going to keep your end of the bargain?\" Terri took a deep breath and nodded, not entirely sure where to begin. She had told Jay what happened, at least some of it, but that was different from telling Mr. Torvald. He was an adult, a teacher. He wasn't a friend with the potential to be more. \"I didn't know there was a DVD until you told me,\" she finally told him. \"I got that before, when I showed it to you.\" \"My brother, Paul, he's the one who put it together and sent it in.\" Mr. Torvald nodded. \"The one you dedicated your song this afternoon to.\" \"Yeah; he's my only brother.\" She stopped talking for a few minutes. Instead of asking questions, jumping in with comments, or the hundred other things that people had been doing to her for months… he stayed silent, just patiently waiting for her to be ready to say what she needed to say. \"Do you remember when I asked you if you ever lost anyone?\" He nodded. \"Vincent Van Gogh,\" he reminded her with a self-deprecating smile. \"My brother was in a car accident at the beginning of the summer.\" \"Oh, Terri…\" he trailed off, but reached out to grab hold of one of her hands in his. \"It was the night he graduated from high school.\" She stopped and took a deep breath, hoping against all hope that she could finish this without beginning to sob, as she really wanted to. \"He sent that DVD in that night, before the accident. I know, because he's wearing the same clothes.\" \"Terri…\" he trailed off, unsure of what to really say to the young woman that was hurting so badly. \"It was my fault. Jay, he says that it isn't, that some drunk driver ran a red light and I couldn't possibly have known.\" She sucked in a shuddering breath and wiped her eyes. \"He's right. It's not your fault at all.\" \"But we were in the car because of me. Paul was grounded, because of me; he wasn't allowed to go out at all…. but I got him tickets to a concert as a present. So, we snuck out to go to it. It was my idea. I was the reason we were out there instead of safe at home.\" \"Terri, listen to me, okay?\" He waited until she raised reddened eyes to look at him. \"It wasn't your fault.\" He squeezed the hand he was holding. \"I know that it seems like it is. I know that you even feel like it is. But it wasn't.\" \"But I do feel like it is. That's what I just can't get past. I killed him.\" \"I know. You're still raw from it… but it gets better, Terri. I promise.\" \"Really?\" She wasn't sure if the question was looking for confirmation or expressing her disbelief that anyone could ever heal from it. \"Have I ever lied to you before?\" He squeezed her hand again when she shook her head. \"And I'm not going to.\" He paused for a moment and took a deep breath, not believing he was really going to open this can of worms. \"Listen, Terri, I haven't told a lot of people this…\" He trailed off and shook his head. \"I'm pretty sure I shouldn't even tell you this, but I'm going to, because I think it'll help you.\" He paused and took a deep breath. \"When I was just a little older then you are I was engaged to a woman named Diana. She was so beautiful and so creative. She couldn't sing worth a damn,\" he laughed,\" but she used to dance as if she had wings. She desperately wanted to go to Julliard. Her parents didn't want her to; they said that the city was too dangerous for her. I'm the only one that supported her dream. I told her that she was good enough to go there and that they'd be lucky to have her.\" Terri smiled slightly. \"Just like Paul and my mom and Aunt Nina.\" \"Just like them,\" he agreed. \"I got in, too, into their music program. I moved there with her, got an apartment near the school. She was so happy when she started there, but things started to go wrong. Instead of being the best dancer, which she'd always been, the one who got the moves down so easily… she was struggling. She still wasn't bad, but nothing was the way she had dreamed it would be. About 3 months into the new year, she fell while practicing a lift.\" \"No!\" The exclamation was quietly spoken, not interrupting him. \"She wasn't seriously injured, but it was enough to put her out of commission for a good chunk of time. She moved into my apartment with me, and she seemed accepting, but she wasn't. She was brittle, bitter. One night we had a brutal screaming fight, though most of the screaming was coming from her. We both said things we didn't mean, things to hurt each other. She blamed me for supporting her, encouraging her to go to a school she had no chance of succeeding in. She told me that she should've known better, should've listened to her parents. She stormed out of the apartment and she didn't come home for two days.\" \"Was she okay?\" \"She was when she came back. She apologized, told me that it was just harder then she expected and that she hadn't meant to take it out on me. She healed and went back to class, back to dancing. I thought everything was going to be great again.\" \"But they weren't.\" He shook his head and looked down at his hands. \"Nope. While she was injured, she got addicted to the mild painkillers the doctor put her on. Mild painkillers turned into some not-so-mild ones from some of her friends and then into a whole lot of other stuff. She ended up OD'ing before the end of the school year.\" Terri switched their hands, squeezing his, not knowing what, if anything, she should say to him. Finally, she just blurted it out. \"How do you think this'll help me?\" \"Well, you see, Terri, for a long time, I blamed myself for Diana's death. Her parents blamed me, too, at the funeral. I was the one who encouraged her to go to school, which is where she got hurt. I'm the one who didn't notice she was doing drugs. I'm the one who put her on the line and then abandoned her.\" \"But it wasn't your fault, Mr. Torvald! She made her own choices. You aren't responsible for them.\" He chuckled again, no amusement in the sound. \"You're right. It took me years to figure that out.\" He cast a wry look over and wiped a thumb down one tear-streaked cheek. \"I hope it doesn't take you as long as it took me.\" Terri nodded, one hand going to the cross around her neck, grasping the necklace that had become a talisman of her brother. \"I hope so, too.\" He let go of her and stood up, shaking his head. \"Look at us. Here its' been this wonderful day and we're sitting in an empty classroom into a near-deserted school sharing sob stories.\" He started back to where his computer was set up, beckoning her to follow him. \"Let's get you your DVD.\" He made short work of copying it after he found it and wrote out what student it was from originally. Filing it and putting the original back into its sleeve, he handed it to her. \"One DVD as requested, Ms. Fletcher.\" \"Thanks, Mr. Torvald.\" She started to back up, heading for the door. \"I better get back. I hope I see you next year.\" \"I hope I see you, too, Ms. Fletcher. Your brother was right, you definitely have some talent.\" Terri was pulling open the door when the teacher called her name, causing her to turn around. He crossed the room unhurriedly and pressed a piece of paper into her hand. \"Just in case you need someone to talk to. Don't be afraid to email me.\" \"Thanks.\" She left the classroom then, looking back through the windowed door to see that he had gone back to what he was doing before her interruption. She hurried outside, to where her family and friends and their families were waiting for her. She had managed to wheedle a nice dinner out of her father, at a diner her group had taken to frequenting. Everyone would be there: Jay, Denise, Kiwi, and Sloane. Greeting them and then separating to pile into their cars and meet back up, she looked down at the paper crumpled in her hand before stuffing it into her purse. Watching Bristoll Hillman Music Conservatory as the car started and began to move, she smiled. Paul was right. She didn't belong in Flagstaff. Maybe, just maybe, she belonged here.

He had to work on his song, he hadn't done any since last summer. He had all the right inspiration, with a girl like Teri Fletcher as his girlfriend. Somehow, though, the words just weren't coming out. He sighed, putting his pad down on the ground and massaging his temples. There was a knock at the door and Jay turned around to see Teri. He smiled as she came in, closing the door. \"Hey,\" she said, smiling. \"You still working on that song?\" She asked, picking up the pad. Jay watched her as the sung the songs under her breath.

Jay laughed and kissed her quickly on the nose. \"Of course not,\" he told her with a smile. Teri kissed him back. His arms went around her waist and he pushed her against the bed. Teri smiled and her fingers trailed up his back, and then skimming underneath his shirt. She took in a sharp breath as his tongue ran along her lip. She opened her mouth. Just as his fingers began fiddling with her blouse buttons, the door opened, and Jay's room-mate walked in. Matthew Wykes raised his eyebrows as the two pulled apart guiltily. \"As much as I wouldn't love to leave you two making the next generation on my floor...This is my dorm, too! So--Teri, out!!\" Matthew said with a grin. Teri got up, flushed. She kissed Jay quickly good-bye and left. Jay looked up at Matthew with a hopeless look on his face. \"You couldn't let me...Just this one time?\" Jay asked sarcastically. Matthew laughed. \"No way, bro, the look of annoyance on your face is just too good.\" Jay rolled his eyes and Matthew laughed again, collapsing on his bed.

And yet - here they were. Who would have known. OneShot. Warning: OneShot, massive spoilers for the movie. OneShot. Established as a final epilogue. OneShot. (This means there won't be a sequel to this story nor will I ever write another one for this movie.) Set: Ten years after the movie \"Raise Your Voice\" Disclaimer: Standards apply. Dedicated to: Alex, who actually read something I wrote! Not that she ever will again, but still... The spotlights' heat burns down on her mercilessly. Terry is standing on the stage, the hall beyond her filled to the last possible extent with people. The cheering and screaming is deafening and hadn't she had a microphone one wouldn't be able to hear her voice. But, of course, the moment her band starts the next intro and the audience recognizes it, the screaming is replaced with thousands of voices singing along with the melody. She still isn't completely used to the sound of her voice filling an entire hall, of hearing her own echo return to her. The heat, the screams, the music, the beat and the warm, sweaty microphone in her hand add to the feeling of exhilaration, to the sensation of standing on a stage. A stage. Who would have known? Terry! Terry! Terry! The crowd chants her name like a prayer, men and women alike. She loves the way her music seems to be able to reach many different groups, many different human beings. For this reason she tries to satisfy all their wishes, writing and singing for different everyone but always, always keeping her own style. Many producers and managers have tried to persuade her to write and perform songs preferred by the greater mass. But even if she's not as rich and famous as other colleagues of hers, she is happy with the way her life turned out to be. And that is what matters, isn't it? Smiling brightly, she receives her audiences' applause and gives back their respect and love. At her sign, her band strikes the chords of her encore and she grips her microphone tighter, walking back to the edge of the stage and letting the roar of the people recede minimally until she starts her last song. It is a new one and the people listen intently. After the first chorus, they have learned the melody and join her in the second chorus. She holds the final notes for a few seconds and they linger in the sudden silence, only to be broken by a shattering cheer and applause. Bowing, smiling, waving, she leaves the stage the last time, this time not to return. \"Brilliant, brilliant, Terry, well done!\" Her manager awaits her in her lounge and offers her tea which she gladly takes. \"So this was our last concert in the US! We're off for Europe on Friday, have you finished packing?\" Terry grinned and shook her head. \"I'm still trying to decide what to take.\" \"Don't wait too long, otherwise Chris'll have to do the packing and you won't look as appealing as you normally do on stage, darling!\" \"I'll have my luggage ready, don't worry. As well as my stylists.\" \"Good. Now, as you requested, there are no events tonight. May I ask what you want to do?\" A grin crossed her features. Her manager leaned back, her eyes widening fractionally. \"No\", she sighed. \"I don't think I want to hear it.\" Terry's grin grew even wider. \"If you don't want to hear, don't ask.\" Her manager looked at her concerned. \"You'll be careful, will you? We don't need a scandal. We don't want a scandal. Not now .\" \"It's nothing like that\", Terry assured her and got up, walking in direction of her bath-room. \"Don't worry, I'll be fine. I'm just meeting some old friends.\" \"This better be worth it\", her manager mumbled. A few hours later, Terry walked down the street towards Los Angeles Central Station. It was December and a cold wind swept the streets. Still, people were on their way, keeping their hands hidden deeply in their pockets and their faces in their scarves. The cold gave her the perfect excuse to disguise herself with a long coat and a scarf, as well. As a musician, Terry was quite popular with the people and even though her fame didn't rival those of Madonna and Lady Gaga she had a neat group of fans throughout the US and Europe. Leaving her house without being recognized had proved to be more and more impossible these days and there had been times when she had felt like she never would be left alone in her entire life again. But at least she still was able to slip away unnoticed once in a while, when wearing clothes like this coat that disguised her figure and either sunglasses or a shawl like this one to hide her face. (Maybe this was why they met in winter?) Another thing was her hair. If she let it down, most people recognized her as Terry Fletcher , the singer. When she put her hair up and fixed it in a tight bun, she looked older and stricter and less like herself. She took care not to use this neat trick often in order to keep it a secret. Checking her watch, she swore softly and rushed forward into the station. She was seven minutes too late, something she blamed on a few fans who had been waiting at the front door of her hotel and had forced her to leave through the back door. Now, she made her way through the crowds of travelers and businesspeople who were returning to their homes after a long day of work. Ducking underneath a dangerously low, dangling neon sign for pizza, she reached the great waiting hall and immediately heard the sound of music from the other side. A violin. A piano. A guitar. Drums. \"Excuse me, excuse me…\" Muttering her apologies, she finally managed to fight her way through the bystanders and was able to see the musicians. Her heart-pace quickened even more. Because there they were. They were seemingly rehearsing an old, well-known song in a nice, leisurely way and already now people had stopped and were standing there, listening transfixed. So many things had changed. Denise and Sloane were famous musicians now, Kiwi even had his own production studios. Terry had become a famous singer and Jay had followed his dreams: he played his music in the streets of Los Angeles, as well as working as a teacher in their former school. Terry's gaze wandered over her oldest friends and she smiled. Her eyes lingered on Jay's face: he looked concentrated, like he always had when he was playing his music. A tiny smile lingered in the corner of his mouth. His fingers danced over the strings as he coaxed the most beautiful sounds from his guitar. His eyes travelled over the audience until they came to rest on her. His smile widened and she smiled back, stepping into the little circle her friends had formed and pulled down her scarf. There were no gasps of surprise from the audience, which was good. She smiled at Denise, Kiwi and Sloane in turn and received similar smiles (except from Sloane, but the frown on her forehead showed her the rather unexpressive artist had seen her and was equally happy to see her again as well). They finished their rehearsal and Jay handed her a few pages. Taking them, her hand brushed his lightly and she shuddered, but she didn't have the time to think about it for long: Kiwi stuck the first few chords, using the drum sticks, and Jay, Denise and Sloane joined in for the song. Looking down on the pages, Terry realized they had chosen a song they had first sung years ago at the academy, and smiled. Denise nodded at her and she joined in. The world keeps spinning around me I have no time to stop and think So many people in the streets But no one notices me standing on the sidewalk The people who had been listening before seemed surprised by the sudden change of atmosphere. Though the lyrics seemed melancholic and thoughtful, the melody was quick and passionate and more and more people stopped to listen. An old man, almost deaf, walked by and threw them a dirty look. Used to such treatment, they ignored him and smiled at each other. The summer sun shines brightly Casting a glow of life on the world People enter my life and leave again And I am left to mend the broken bonds Kiwi went into a wild storm of drums while Sloane accompanied him with her keyboard. Jay waited until they made room and threw her a questioning look and when she nodded her consent, he sent them both into the wild, beautiful chorus. But that's the way it is This is my life, this is my world I'm not just waiting, I'm not afraid Cause I'll learn to fly, I'll learn to sing I'll learn to live with every day With every day you're by my side. The audience cheered while Denise delivered her solo with fervor and Terry, too, listened in awe. Every time she heard her friend play her violin she was stuck silent. It was like listening to celestial music – mixed something that was uniquely Denise. It was… Amazing. The audience thought so, too. Coins and notes rained into the violin case they had placed on the pavement in front of them. It had been Jay's idea, one year ago, when they had met again after ten years. It had been Jay, too, who had organized the class reunion at the academy. Denise had come up with the public performance (aka training ) and Sloane had proposed to donate the money. Finally, Kiwi had let them swear to meet again the next year and Terry had been waiting for twelve months to meet her friends again. Each of them had a life, now. But it felt so good to see them again. I live my life in the shadows Not knowing what is right or wrong I look at people all around me But the last decision is mine to make There is no way I'm always right And I know I've got much to learn But I'll go on living, go on trying I believe in hearts meeting again and again People left, others joined. Terry smiled at an old woman and the woman smiled back, slowly and with a strain that made Terry think she hadn't smiled in ages. But she did now, and that was what mattered. Sloane delivered a short solo, as well, and as it had been with Denise, she was amazed by the beauty of her play. She saw Kiwi throw a proud look at her and Sloane – smirked. She actually did. Wow! Terry never would have believed to see her friend show any other expression than her usual expressionlessness, but here she was, smirking. Who would have known. And everything will be alright As long as you are by my side As long as the world keeps turning I'll go on into the world and find my heart I'll find you This is my life, this is my world I'm not just waiting, I'm not afraid Cause I'll learn to fly, I'll learn to sing I'll learn to live with every day With every day you're by my side. Every song came to an end eventually, and so did theirs. The applause was huge. The five musicians bowed, smiled and thanked and then Sloane began their next song. Jay joined in, Kiwi gave the rhythm and Denise played along. Terry sang. It was magic. The people stopped and listened and left again. And Terry liked to believe that every time another person left, he or she did so with a smile on his or her lips. Suddenly, there was a scream, high-pitched and breathless. \" Oh my God! Terry Fletcher!\" Denise, Sloane and Kiwi exchanged knowing glances, while Terry and Jay looked confused. But when a teenager started to shove her way through the crowd, she realized what was happening. \"What should we do?\" She whispered to Jay, who was closest. Without breaking his tact, he lifted his shoulders questioningly. The chorus ended as the teenage girl had reached the front. \"Wow\", she whispered in a voice that carried through the entire hall. \"It's her.\" Then, louder: \"It's her ! It's Terry Fletcher!\" Grasping for her i-phone, she started typing like crazy. The audience, having noticed the commotion, began to shift. The rumor increased exponentially. More and more people stopped to look at the scene – it wouldn't need much until this escalated, Terry realized and started to back away from her friends. \"I'll meet you later?\" She asked. The others nodded, not once breaking in their performance. Smiling once more, Terry pulled her scarf over her face and started to run. They cornered her at the South Entrance of the Station, waving CD-covers, T-Shirts and pens. How on earth could it be that so many people were able to react to one single Facebook comment? Impossible as it seemed, half Los Angeles seemed to be trying to squash her to death, screaming her name and pressing her farther and farther into the wall. \"Hey!\" A loud voice suddenly caught her attention, and someone shouldered his way through the crowd. A few girls went down screaming. Normally Terry would have been angry with the brutal man but now she could only think about how she would get out. The man stopped in front of her and with a jolt she recognized Jay. She heaved a huge sigh of relief as he grabbed her, put an arm around her and started to shoulder their way out towards the exit. \"Give them the autographs\", he whispered as he led her to the doors. He was right. She had to stay calm and friendly. Smiling, she signed a few CDs, shook a few hands and in the meantime, Jay brought her closer and closer to the exit. Finally, she reached the exit and immediately got caught in a throng of commoners returning from work. \"You're famous!\" Jay shouted into her ear. \"Why are you famous?\" Giggling, she followed him through the crowd and nearly lost him as three businessmen with dark suits crossed their way. \"Hey!\" \"Come on\", he said and grabbed her hand. Familiar warmth shot through her hand, up her arm and spread through her entire body. His hand was warm and firm. And familiar. He didn't let go of her until they reached a Borders and he pulled her through the open doors. Books and people enveloped them, but not as bad as it had been in Central Station. Leading her to the café on the other side, he bought her coffee and sat down in front of her. Thankful, she sipped the hot liquid. His eyes sparkled. \"Now, that was exciting. We should meet more often. It would make my life infinitely more interesting.\" \"What – you don't think your life as a teacher isn't interesting enough?\" \"It's interesting alright\", he conceded happily. \"I've never regretted taking the position. What about you?\" \"It's hard being famous\", she said and took another sip of her drink. \"But I wouldn't exchange it for anything.\" Silence fell between them, both embarrassing and strange. They hadn't seen each other for a year and most of what had been between them had been lost even before. They had been children, young and foolish, and… \"So… What are you planning this year?\" \"I'm teaching in the summer workshop, of course. Besides… I've got nothing planned, really.\" Silence. \"And you?\" \"I'll be in Europe for three months. And then… I don't know.\" A woman came to their table. \"Excuse me – are you…?\" \"Yeah, she's Terry Fletcher\", Jay said and grabbed her hand again. \"It's great to meet you, but you have to excuse us. We've got something to do…\" Pulling her upright, he left her enough time to smile at the woman, shake her hand and scribble an autograph onto the napkin. Then Jay pulled her out of the store. \"Heavens!\" He moaned. \"Where can I take you so we won't be disturbed again?\" \"There is a place I'd like to see again\", she offered. \"The roof of the academy\", Jay said, impressed. \"That's brilliant.\" Night was falling slowly. Already, the first stars could be seen in the dark sky. \"Denise, Sloane and Kiwi will be there soon\", Terry said and leaned over the railing. It was cold. Shuddering, she pulled her coat around her. Jay's hand moved forward and tugged free her hair from the bun she had forced it into before both realized what he had done. They froze. Terry's hair came down in a silvery cascade. \"Sorry\", he mumbled, his breath hanging in the frozen night air. \"It's okay\", she answered, equally breathless. Turning away, he looked over the roof. The city was slowly waking for the night. Skyscrapers and neon signs dominated the view. It was beautiful. \"You know, I always wondered what would happen once one grew up\" he said, half to himself, half to her. \"It seemed so… far away as long as one was a child. I'd never believed… Well, look at you… I always thought…\" His voice trailed off. Not knowing what to say, she leaned next to him and followed his gaze. \"I know. Time has passed so fast, hasn't it?\" \"Hm-hm.\" Another silence, this time worlds more significant than their last one. Finally, he asked: \"Do you think everything changes?\" \" Everything ? Like what?\" He hesitated. \"People. Worlds. Maybe… Feelings.\" Her heart beating fast, she concentrated on the building next to them. \"Maybe some things stay the same.\" He gave her a cryptic look and took a deep breath. \"So if a guy meets a girl ten years after they first met, and he still thinks she is brilliant and beautiful and funny and her voice and her smile still can make him forget everything he wants to say and leave him stuttering like the last idiot, is it possible that he still is in love with her?\" \"Maybe?\" \"And if they didn't see each other for years but suddenly their paths crossed and they agreed to meet the next year and the guy has waited the entire year for that day to finally come, is it be possible that he still has a chance?\" He still wasn't looking at her. Carefully, she turned to him and stared directly into his dark eyes. He lifted a hand, softly, and brushed away a strand of hair. Again, his touch alone made her shiver. Terry stared at the skyline and felt the warmth from his hand spread through her entire body. \"I think it would be quite unfair to not give the poor guy a chance.\" \"You do?\" \"Maybe.\" \"Hey\", he protested and strong, callused fingers stroke her cheek soft like a gust of wind. \"That's unfair. You let me pour out my heart to you and you don't even give me a direct answer?\" Again, she looked at him and saw stars sparkling in his eyes. Stars, and the image of her own face. \"I agree.\" He breathed out a sigh of relief. \"I'll be in Europe for the next three months\", she reminded him softly. To his credit, he didn't hesitate a single second. \"I'll wait. Can I take you out tomorrow?\" \"Another Borders?\" \"Nah, I'll think of something else.\" \"Okay.\" He didn't try to kiss her. But his gaze alone made her shiver. It carried more than a promise – it carried a world. His hand took hers, and their fingers entwined. \"There you are!\" Denise, Kiwi and Sloane burst through the door onto the roof. \"I knew we'd find you here!\" Like children discovered with the hand in the cookie jar, they jumped apart. Kiwi whistled. \"Wow, you didn't waste time, mate!\" Denise didn't deign him a look as she strode over. \"We've gained a lot today\", she told them. \"And it was brilliant! Next year, same place, same time?\" The others nodded. \"And now let's get downstairs\", Sloane added, practical as ever. \"It's cold and we've got a dinner waiting.\" Jay, Terry realized as they reached a comfortable, brightly lit classroom in which a set table and different, steaming hot terrines of delicious-smelling food were waiting, hadn't once let go of her hand.

When thy moved to her bedroom they forgot to blow them out on must have fallen or caught something. She was instantly stunned. Kyle started to tie her scarfs together and hanging them out the window. He finally pulled her out of her stunned state of minds long enough to make her climb out of the window. She must have inhaled to much smoke because she passed out once she reached the bottom. When she woke up she was in a hospital surrounded by wires and tubes, her mom and dad were sitting at the end of the bed. They looked over and saw that she was awake and started sobbing. They were thrilled that their little girl was okay. Katie didn't remember a thing until she saw that a large chunk of her mother's hair was singed and then she started crying too.

It was mostly used for air-dropping supplies and other deliveries that were otherwise unable to handle going to this chilling U.S state any other way. However this time the delivery was huge metal container was open. But no one was there to collect it. First of, there was barely any ice cream inside- it had all been devoured. Secondly, this time stuff had been walking OUT of the crate: five, small golden retriever puppies. Four males and one female: Budderball, B-dawg, Buddha, Mudbud and Rosebud- the Air buddies. \"That was hot dawgs!\" commented the \"cool\" pup, B-dawg. \"What's wrong with the ground, it's all cold?\" wondered Rosebud, looking at the unusual environment. There was snow in Fernfield but never at this level. \"It's a dream come true, were surrounded by vanilla ice cream!\" cheered the greedy Budderball, licking the cold ground. \"Wait a minute, this ice cream has no flavour, this isn't a dream its my worst nightmare!\" \"Where's the dirt!?\" demanded Mudbud. \"We have to get back to Fernfield\" stated Rosebud. \"It all smells the same how are we gonna get back?\" asked Mudbud. Buddha looked to his right, noticing a group of trees that looked somewhat similar to the large forest outside of Fernfield. \"I think home is this way guys!\" he said, running ahead. The others followed him. Darkness had consumed the sky. It had become clear that this was not Fernfield. Still walking in the sub-zero temperature's of Alaska, the Buddies tirelessly searched for any sight of their home. Buddha had no clue where he was going and as he looked up at the snake-like trees, the wise puppy accepted his failure. \"Guys, I think I may have been wrong this is not the way home\" he admitted. \"It's so cold\" shuddered B-dawg. \"And it's getting kinda dark...not that I'm scared or anything...I'm just worried bout you lot, that's all\". \"How did this happen?\" wondered Budderball, sadly. \"YOUR stomach is how it happened, dude\" Mudbud reminded his brother that this was practically his fault. \"Pointing paws isn't gonna get us home\" Rosebud broke up any chance of a fight happening. \"Sometime's the greatest journey start accidentally but ends with a higher purpose\" advised the spirtual Buddha. \"Who are we kidding, we're lost!\" cried B-dawg. \"Hopelessly, lost, we're never gonna find our way home, we're gonna die out here! I knew I should've abandoned you guys in the ice cream truck, I'm gonna freeze to death!\" \"Thanks, dude\" said Mudbud sarcastically. Suddenly, up ahead, was some strange vibrations; a strange dynamic of colours bursting through the stars above. \"Looks like you were leading us right Buddha\" said Budderball, thinking it was Fernfield. \"Home!\" cheered B-dawg. \"I knew we would find it! I never lost faith, I knew I wouldn't die out here!\" He ran ahead, through the bundle of complex trees and out into the open. The others followed but skidded to a halt when they saw their brother sitting down, staring at something in front of him. \"B-dawg?\" Rosebud called. They sat beside him and looked at what he was staring at. Before them was a large pool of frozen ice, along with several large ice structures up ahead. But in the sky was something they've never seen before in their life- the Northern Lights. \"What is that?\" whispered Buddha. The mixture of colours stood out in the darkness, it's ray of light beaming everywhere, blessing the cold, cruel Alaskan landscape. Suddenly, a wolf howl could be heard, making the Buddies scared. \"It's a wolf\" gasped B-dawg. \"Okay let's get out of here!\" decided Rosebud. However Mudbud, the mischeous one, was already running along the ice, and slipping. He continued slidding until he skidded into one of the ice structures. His siblings ran towards him. \"Ouch\" he groaned. The wolf howl was repeated. \"Wow those lights are beautiful\" commented Rosebud, still admiring them. \"Guy's we're still lost and home is nowhere to be seen\" Budderball reminded them, sadly. \"Not to mention it's f-f-freezing\". \"Come on, let's find somewhere to rest for the night, we'll have better luck searching in the morning\" said Rosebud. However, when the Buddies turned to their right, a large, dark figure stood before them. \"It's the wolf!\" screamed B-dawg. The Buddies ran in the other direction, as the \"wolf\" stepped into the reflection of the Northern Lights, on the frozen pool of water, revealing himself to be an Alaskan Malamute. It was the legendary Talon, who had heard the screams of the lost pup's. Thankfully the upset puppies found a cave to rest in for the night, thinking that the day had been a catastrophe: their parents were worried sick, their kid's were equally as sad, they were lost, alone and cold in an area unknown to them. But soon five pup's turned into six and the puppies soon became famous when they defied expert opinion by becoming the first to win a brutal dog-sled race against grown huskies and adults. In a big, complex cave high up in the mountains, the ground thudded as a creature lurked in the darkness. It walked deep into the cave. The light up ahead, coming from the hole in the ceiling, revealed it to be a deadly looking red raptor. It had been frozen for over 65 million years. It's hideous, scarred eye turned towards the dog, who had his eyes closed as if he were meditating. \"It seems your predictions aren't as accurate as you thought\" growled Razer, his claws scraping the ice. \"I suppose I should thank you for leading Blade to free those other raptor's, now I won't be alone\". \"You are still driven on by rage; therefore you still have nothing\" the wise dog replied. \"Really, and what do you HAVE!?\" yelled Razer, flicking his tail so fast that a gust of wind forced Talon to open his eyes. \"I thought you gave up training race dogs since your last pupil started an uprising...no you trained another, the one who gave me this scar and the reason I am here. So what's this I hear about you training six puppies in a dog race thing- I only suspect it was your doing there's no way they could have survived in that storm\". \"How did you- \"My lunch told me...before he became my lunch...in that I hate him\". \"They had a goal to accomplish\". \"You taught his son, didn't you?\" guessed Razer. \"Of course! That's why!\" Talon didnt reply. He knew Shasta met Razer before, but he was small and had forgotten. He also knew Razer's only friend, Claw, was killed by his parents after he tried eating them, and that the raptor hated being stuck in this time. Who had helped him survive? The same thing he had once helped: Dark Blade. \"Oh relax you know I can't venture from this area or everyone will learn of my survival\" he grinned evily, showing his sharp teeth. \"You will not harm him Razer\" growled Talon. \"I know\" admitted the raptor. \"I was just thinking about what I might do to him if I do see him; rip his tail off; perhaps share his remains with the others\". \"What is it you want?\" \"I want a lot of things; more specifically I want a new home, your 'pupils' have attracted new dogs to my old home soon they will find us. So you have three days to get out or bla bla bla you will be eaten; only because you helped Blade I am giving you a chance of escape but if I ever see you here again- \"I will leave but only because I feel sorry for you, Razer\" accepted Talon. \"I hope one day you find peace\". \"Peace\" Razer mocked, as Talon prepared to leave. \"Peace is just a myth- there is no such thing as 'peace'\".[Chapter 2] This fan fiction takes place in Snow buddies when the Buddies, Molly and Buddy are on the plane, heading back to Fernfield. \"So this must have been an interesting week for you pups\" said Molly. The buddies were looking out the plane window, watching Berny, Sheriff Ryan, Adam and his parents waving to them. Shasta was barking. \"I'm sure gonna miss them\" Budderball said, sadly. \"Especially Shasta he was totally radical!\" exclaimed Mudbud. \"So how did this all happen?\" asked Buddy. \"I must admit i'v played some interesting sport's but sled racing is one I thought I could never do. After the Buddies told their story, from when Budderball snuck into the ice cream van to when they overtook Jean George and won, Molly asked \"Is Shasta that adorable little husky with the blue eyes?\" \"Yeah he's so cute!\" replied Rosebud. \"Rosebud has a crush on him\" teased B-dawg. \"Hey!\" cried Rosebud. The plane was nearly back to Washington. \"Wow you pulled out those adult dog's from the freezing water\" said an impressed Air bud, who was quiet pleased with all their accomplishments's. \"Yeah but it was mainly me who helped you see I crawled towards the sled on the ice even though it was breaking\" lied B-dawg. \"Honesty is not your best policy, B-dawg\" Buddha told him. \"Shasta was the one who did that\". \"I'm guessing that nasty Jean George guy must have been the one who caused to other racer's to fall of their sled, lucky we found them\" realised Molly. The buddies then looked sad. \"Do you think we'll ever see Shasta and Adam again?\" Rosebud sadly asked. \"I'm so sad that we had to say goodbye to Shasta, he was an awesome friend and without him we would've never made it in that cold place\". \"Yeah i'm so sad I don't even feel hungry\" Budderball quietly said. \"Well I hope some day you do see them again\" Buddy told them. \"But Alaska and Fernfield are very far away from each other\". \"But that race was of the chain insane, dawg's!\" shouted B-dawg. \"Me and Buddha were in the middle since we are the fastest!\" \"Me and Budderball were at the end cause we were the strongest\" explained Mudbud. \"Me and Shasta were at the front I was the navigator and Shasta was our lead dog\" finished Rosebud. \"Shasta was an amazing leader\" \"This Talon the great sounds like an amazing dog I wish I could've met him\" sighed Buddy. \"He's like you, Dad, your both good at sport\" Buddha informed him. \"I just can't wait to get dirty again\" said a relieved Mudbud. \"I looked completely spotless!\" The plane landed in the airport. \"Ok Air bud it's time for you and your family to hop of\" the captain told them. \"Frank walk them up a bit and then they should know the way to the town hall by themselves\" \"Ok\" replied the assistant Frank before turning to the seven golden retrievers. \"Ok your owners are waiting outside the town hall i'm gonna walk you up a bit then you can go the rest of the way. \"Er Frank you do realise they can't talk so there's no point in explaining to them\" the captain interrupted. But he didn't know the dog's secret that they could talk, but only to other animals.[Chapter 3] Two days later the Buddies once again met up in the park. But they weren't in the mood to play. They had felt strange ever since they came back. \"Do you guys feel a bit, I dunno, strange?\" asked Rosebud. \"Yeah I feel weird\" replied Buddha. \"Maybe it's the feeling of saddness\" \"I haven't been able to eat in two days, i'm starting to think i'm coming down with something\" said Budderball. \"Now that's a surprise\" stated B-dawg. \"Maybe it's cause were back from Alaska and it was really cold there and here its not\" suggested Mudbud. \"I miss Shasta and Adam and Deputy Bernie\" Rosebud quietly admitted. \"Oh and let's not forget Talon\". \"It could be because we'v lost some special friends\" Buddha sadly told his siblings. \"I dont think we will ever see them again\". The Buddies didn't talk for a few seconds. After a while, B-dawg finally said \"Come on dawg's we need to do something cool so we can get back in the mood, yo\" The others agreed and decided to try and forget about Alaska but they couldn't because dog sled racing and going through multiple challenges in the race was unforgettable. Eventually they found themselves mucking around outside the bakery. \"Look the workers are laying out fresh bread!\" Budderball greedily said. \"Budderball, remember what happened last time dude?\" Mudbud reminded him. He was referring to what had happened in Air Buddies. \"I think Budderball has got his killer appetite back!\" laughed B-dawg. Rosebud smiled in agreement but she still missed something. She did miss Adam, Talon and Bernie but she especially missed Shasta. It was probably because that husky was so similar to her. They both liked sport, they both are brave and they both are fast. Rosebud missed everything about him, especially his blue eyes which she thought was mesmerizing. \"We should be getting home now let's take the shortcut through the alleyway\" suggested Buddha. B-dawg went over to look. \"Yo dawg's you got to come look at this!\" cried B-dawg. The others ran towards B-dawg who was outside a alley. \"Er look whats inside\" he wimpered. The alley was swarming with cats, at least ten or twelve. Budderball gulped. \"Well, well, well it looks as if we have visiters\" snarled a black cat. \"Look it's Air Bud's little trouble makers\" laughed a tom cat. \"We don't want any trouble\" Buddha calmly explained.\"We'll just be on our way now\". \"Yeah, go run back to that sport playing mut!\" chortled a greyish cat. \"Hey don't you talk about our dad like that!\" shouted Rosebud. \"Yeah you dudette's are about to go down\" added Mudbud. \"You picked the wrong pup's to mess with\" said Budderball. \"Oh yeah, fatso!\" replied the tom cat, causing the other's to laugh. \"Hey at least he doesn't smell like fish\" said Buddha. Usually Buddha doesn't say negative word's like that but made an exception because they were bullying his brother. The black cat breathed on her paw and sniffed and seemed to agree with that remark. \"Y-Yeah you c-cats are nothing but- stammered B-dawg, trying to be brave like his siblings were. \"And who's Mr. fraidy cat over here?\" insulted the black cat. \"The phrase should be changed to scaredy dog!\" \"Budderball, you think you can let one rip?\" whispered Mudbud. Budderball nodded. He turned around so his butt faced the cats and then farted. The cat's shrieked and screamed and the Buddies ran off laughing. That cheered them up. They all ran towards Deputy Dan's office, laughing. \"Yo that's what i'm talking about!\" B-dawg shouted out of excitement. \"We taught those kitty's why they shouldn't mess with the Buddies!\" \"I think that just cured my sad feeling\" laughed Buddha. In Ferntiuktuk, Alaska, Adam's dad was helping him place the trophy on a wooden desk he had just installed. \"There we go, Adam, your trophy is now up\" he said. Adam smiled in response. \"It's time for dinner\" called his mum. As they went over to the kitchen, Shasta was staring out the window. He to missed his new friends and felt sad that he would never see them again. Adam then came back and saw him. \"I know I miss the puppies to, but they belong in Washington, i'm sure their owners are glad to see them back\" Adam told him, guessing the reason he was sad. \"Come on, your stake's getting cold\" Shasta and Adam ran to the kitchen.[Chapter 4] It was a day before Valentines day, in Fernfield. The Buddies once again met in the park when their owners went to school. It was two week's after they had been on the moon and nearly three years since the Alaska events. \"So are you dudes and dudette going to the Valentines dance at the town hall?\" asked Mudbud. \"Definitely, there's gonna be so much free food and drink!\" Budderball dreamily said. \"Well I wish I could join you dawg's but me and my peep's are gonna be headin to New York for the week!\" announced B-dawg. \"Wow New York, that city is beautiful and all those colours!\" exclaimed Rosebud. \"I wish I could go!\" \"So how are you all dealing with the reporters?\" asked Buddha. \"Well they saved me from having to take a bath but the flashes in my eye's were kinda annoying\" replied Mudbud. \"They were filled with questions\" said Budderball. \"I had to sit still for an hour without eating or even going to the toilet!\" \"Are you dawg's gonna ask someone to go to the dance with you?\" asked B-dawg. \"I'm glad I won't need to\". \"Well actually I do want to ask someone to come with me but I don't know how\" revealed Buddha talking quietly. \"Really who!?\" Rosebud asked her brother. \"Her name's Daisy and she's a Labrador puppy\" he told them. \"You want us to help you out?\" offered Budderball. Buddha anxiously nodded. \"Try talking cool\" suggested B-dawg. \"Give her a gift\" said Rosebud. \"Steal some food for her\" suggested Budderball. After thinking about it Buddha decided to just ask her. Later him and Mudbud were walking. They eventually found her in another part of the park running around while her owner was sitting on a bench. \"Ok dude I can't come with you for this part\" Mudbud told him. Buddha tried keeping calm and followed Daisy. \"Hi Daisy, remember me?\" he asked. \"Oh right your the pup I saw before its Buddy isn't it?\" she replied. \"Um it's actually Buddha but your close\". \"Oh sorry, Buddha \". \"So I was wondering, if your not busy on Sunday, would you like to maybe come to the dance with me?\" he bravely asked. \"Sure why not?\" she happily replied. \"Well you can't blame someone for trying\" Buddha told himself, sadly before realising she didn't say no. \"Wait you said yes?!\" \"Yeah, you seem nice\" she smiled. Buddha ran of to find Mudbud who was surprisingly near the bushes. \"She said yes!\" he excitedly shouted. \"So are you gonna ask someone, to go?\" \"Actually I am bro\" Mudbud replied. \"She's right over there, her name's Fragile\" Buddha looked closer through the bushes to see a female golden retriever wearing a pink necklace. Mudbud decided to go to her and ask while Buddha of to find the others. At night, 9:00 to be exact, the Buddies stood outside the town hall. B-dawg, Billy and his parents had left for the airport already. \"Alright, boy's ready to go in?\"asked Rosebud. \"No\" Mudbud nervously stated. \"Mudbud, calm yourself or as B-dawg would say, be cool\" Buddha advised him. Mudbud gulped. \"Oh sweet mamma, I can smell cake!\" cried Budderball, who couldn't wait to get inside. \"Alright let's go in\" Rosebud decided. \"Although I don't really know what me and Budderball are going to do when the dance starts\". The four Buddies went inside. The hall as filled with people, mostly young people about 20. The first thing Budderball spied was the table of food and he rushed towards it. The other three walked over to Deputy Sniffer who was laying next to the entrance. \"Hey there, Deputy dude!\" greeted Mudbud. \"Oh hi buddies I hope your having a good time\" he nicely said. \"If you have any troubles just come see me i'm always gonna be here, well not when Deputy Dan perform's his dance I got to see that!\" \"Whoa Deputy Dan dancing?\" Mudbud shockingly said. \"That I gotta see!\" chuckled Rosebud. Mudbud then saw Fragile and went to her. \"Hey Fragile\" he greeted. Fragile and Mudbud went over to the dance floor. Daisy then approached Buddha. \"Buddha there you are\" she exclaimed. The surprised puppy turned around to see her. \"Hi Daisy!\" he said back. \"This is my little sis, Rosebud\". \"Nice to meet you\" Daisy greeted her. Daisy and Buddha went over to the dance floor as well. Budderball and Rosebud, meanwhile were on their own (well Budderball was stuffing himself).[Chapter 5] Rosebud decided to sit in the corner near the exit to wait for Buddy and Molly (their parents) to arrive. Budderball was looking around the table and decided to run to the next food table, hoping someone would help him get some cake. \"Time to do my famous begging look, hopefully someone will give me some cake\" he told himself before running towards the table. However when he did he slipped and bumped into puppy causing her to fall. \"Oops, sorry I didn't mean to- he quickly tried to explain himself. The dalmatian puppy got back up. \"It's ok\" she re-assured him.\"I'm Allie what's your name?\" \"I'm Budderball\" he anxiously replied. \"So your one of those Space Buddies?\" she rhetorically asked, already guessing the answer. \"Yeah but we prefer the term Air buddies\" he informed her. They both looked at each other for a moment. \"So you want some of this cake which I seemed to have dropped on the floor?\" smirked Budderball noticing the cake he dropped and for once offering to share his food. \"Whoa Budderball sharing his food?\" said a startled Rosebud. \"Well there's a first time for everything. It had reached 9:30 and it was time for the dance to begin. Budderball, Buddha and Mudbud danced with the girl's they had asked while Deputy Dan made a fool of himself. Rosebud sighed to herself. She decided, with nothing to do, she might as well go back to her house. She left through the back way as the front was being blocked by people dancing. As she was walking down the road she saw her mum and dad. \"Rosebud what are you doing here?\" asked Molly. \"Where are the boy's?\" \"Oh I just thought Alice might miss me\" she lied. \"But wouldn't she be asleep at this time?\" said Buddy. \"Well just in case she's not she might be board\" Rosebud pretended. \"Ok i'll walk with you since it's late\" Molly offered although she knew something was wrong. \"Buddy i'll meet you at the dance don't dance without me\" \"Of course not\" laughed the Air Bud, before running of. Molly and Rosebud proceeded to walk down the nearly empty street. \"So why didn't you stay with your brothers?\" she asked her daughter. \"Well it's just they all asked other pup's to dance with them and I kinda felt left out\" she explained. Molly thought about it for a while before replying. \"Well is there any pup you want to go with, sweetie?\" \"Well yeah actually there is but he's probably a thousand miles from Fernfield\" revealed the youngest of the Buddies. Molly thought she knew who she was talking about but wasn't quite sure. \"Well, honey, i'm gonna head to the dance i'll see you tomorrow good night\" she said, before running back to the town hall. Rosebud continued walking until she reached the fair. It was going to be gone next week. She decides, since no one was looking and no one was there she might as well go inside. A dark shadow emerged, looking like it was following her. She snuck in by crawling under the gate. \"Wow I didn't know how spooky a fair was at night\" she said to was a few games around as well as rides. Some of the arcade games had the lights still on. Rosebud went in front of the hall of mirrors. \"Me and Alice love this place!\" she excitedly murmured. She went in and looked in the mirrors all around still felt lonely, empty and sad inside but regardless she tried to make herself happy. \"And here I am talking to myself\". \"What's wrong with talking to yourself, I find it builds confidence\" a voice echoed. The wind suddenly caused the doors to slam shut. \"Er what was that?\" she nervously said. Suddenly the reflections of her vanished and was replaced with a dark figure. All round her was a dark creature whose barely visible appearance looked evil and menacing. It looked like it had a pointy head and its hands had swords attached. \"Who are you?\" she bravely asked. \"Forgive me I have come without introducing myself\" apologised the phantom, in a deep, scary voice. \"My name is Dark Blade you are Rosebud of the Air Buddies or Space is it?\" She took some steps back. \"Do not be afraid ghost's can't hurt anybody\" he cackled. \"Why are you here?\" Rosebud asked him. \"You see I am an ancient Valentine spirit and I was watching over the happy Valentines dance, then I noticed a sad sight in a happy house that's you\" the ghoul lied. \"So tell me why are you sad?\" \"It's just this day reminded me of something\" The \"spirit\" did not respond for a while. \"It's an interesting name\" he eventually commented. \"What?\" \"Shasta. It's a very interesting name- I don't believe i've heard that name before; he seems very unique. That is who you miss, am I not correct?\" \"What? How did you- a shocked Rosebud began. \"Not important\" he quickly ignored that question. Blade had known this because his spy bugs, which he sent out two days ago, had collected information on the Buddies. \"Allow me to guess you miss the husky\" \"Yeah I do but I can't ever see him again\" she sadly admitted. Dark Blade's devious plot was to persuade her to go to Alaska because Commander Drex, an alien leader he was working with, had been freaking out when he heard a prophecy foretelling his defeat at the \" the paws of five puppies who recently got fame\". So Blade, who knew of Earth, found out about the Air buddies and sent robot bugs to gather information about them, so that he could end Drex's fears. \"But your owners are going to Alaska, next week, why don't you and your brother's tag along?\" he continued to tell her. \"What you mean sneak on board?!\" \"It's not like you haven't done it before that's how you boarded Vision enterprises big success story or how you got to Alaska in the first place\". \"But it's just- she began. \"I am a ghost of good so you can trust me\" Dark Blade again lied. \"It's for three day's, simple in and out, what could go wrong? You do know that this is most likely your only chance to see Shasta again if you turn it down then you won't get a second chance. You have a place to stay, a friend to help you and of course each other\". \"Yeah your right!\" she excitedly cried. \"I'll have to wait till my brother, B-dawg, come's back so we can all talk it over though\". \"Yes yes talk of course ,excellent, but just one thing\" Dark Blade interrupted. \"Don't tell anyone about me, that you talked to me or that I even exist, don't want people to think your crazy\" Rosebud turned to leave but then needed to ask another question. However, when she turned around, the mirror's had only her reflection in it. She ran out of the fair as Dark Blade watched from behind the arcade, cackling to himself. \"The stage is set and the player's are ready!\" he evilly laughed. \"Now all I need to do is tell Death about my plan when they go to Alaska, our raptor friend's will devour them and then maybe Drex can stop going mental over this prophecy!\" The dark phantom teleported away, leaving only blue mist behind.

Enjoy!) Jay set his bags down at his room, looking around, \"Same as always.\" He muttered, throwing his bags on the bed before his roommate, Kiwi, came in, \"Hey man! The year flies fast, doesn't it?\" Jay flashed a weak smile at his friend before opening his guitar and bringing out some unmarked sheet music as well as a couple of songs he wrote with his girlfriend…or old girlfriend, Terri. \"So, how's Terri…..\" Jay shut his suitcase with such force at the mention of her name that Kiwi jumped back. He saw Jay grip his arms as if he had gotten a sudden chill. After a minute of silence, Jay grabbed his guitar and turned to Kiwi, \"Hey..um..\" Jay clapped his hands together, \"Sorry.\" Kiwi nodded, grabbing his drumsticks and going outside. \"I'm….I'm gonna go practice a little, OK?\" he said, grabbing his key and walking out, his guitar behind him. Kiwi looked at him and threw his hand through his hair, \"Umm….I'm guessing something happened?\" Jay walked out of the building and sat on the cool grass by the side. He strummed his guitar thoughtfully. Ever since Terri was killed, Jay had sunken into a deep depression, he stopped performing; stopped writing; just plain stopped living. When his parents forced them to audition, he got in only because he knew that Terri would have wanted him to. Terri… \"I know what you were feeling that summer Terri!\" he shouted to no one, but luckily, no one was around to hear it. Jay sighed and slammed his guitar into the grass, ever since that night when he got the call; his life had been hell. He was haunted constantly by demons, and he knew he had to do something, but some foreign anger that he could not control would well up, and then he never knew what happened after that. He looked around and saw all the kids, laughing and playing, having the time of their lives….and for the first time, Jay knew what it felt like to be completely alone. Meanwhile, on the other side of campus, a girl was entering Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory for the first time, and as she looked around seeing all the people walking around in the area and felt excited, \"I can't believe I made it!\" she mumbled to herself, grinning as she opened the door and walked inside, clutching her drum sticks bag. 'I've gone from rags to riches, I guess.' She thought, walking around trying to find her room, \"324….324…\" Lori Barkin was born into poverty in the south side of San Francisco, and survived on her own without a family. She learned to make a living off of drumming in the streets and one of her friends taped her and she got accepted, so she flew out to Los Angeles to see if maybe she could spring herself out of this poor life. She slammed into the room kind of loud, making her roommate jerk up. \"Um…\" Lori tucked a lock of auburn hair behind her ear. \"Hi, I'm Lori.\" She said. The girl came up, her dark brown hair falling over her face, \"Kristy. Nice to meet you. you're new right?\" \"You couldn't tell?\" Lori laughed slightly, throwing her bag on the bed as well as her drumsticks, \"Oh…you're a drummer huh?\" \"Yep, what about you?\" she said, throwing her clothes into a closet. She was able to get somewhat nice clothes by working at a store when she wasn't performing. \"I'm a saxophonist. But I play guitar on the side.\" Kristy said, putting the last of her clothes away, \"Well, shall I give you a tour of the campus?\" she asked as Lori put her worn drumsticks but a well worn picture of her parents before looking at her and grinning, \"Sure. I'd like that.\"[Chapter 2] ((I've decided I am keeping this story now that I have an actual PLOT LINE and it took forever to come up with it. Enjoy!)) \"Well, obviously this is the auditorium, where we'll have to go for the introductions in about an hour.\" Kristy said, pointing out all the sights and sounds of the campus. Kristy had her case with her as they walked outside, \"And um…that's the park…and the train station. There's a couple of good places to eat around here, but that's basically it.\" Lori looked around and around, \"This is fantastic.\" She said out loud, looking around. Kristy nodded her head, \"Yea, it's pretty cool. Here, you don't have a summer job, no parents to bug you…\" Lori zoned out and looked down at her feet. She vowed that no one here would find out her situation. After all, she was just like them. Or…at least I think…she thought, looking around again. Jay sighed and looked around, blinking at the sun again. He checked his watch momentarily and realized that he had to go to the introduction. ' Nah…great' he thought, standing up and grabbing his guitar, before heading inside to the auditorium, taking his normal spot by Kiwi with Robin in front of him. ' How does she get in year after year? ' he thought to himself, looking back. His eyes caught the sight of a girl, her auburn hair falling just over her shoulders and her face soft as she surveyed the scene. Jay turned back around, \"Not again.\" He told himself. After the same old introduction, everyone headed off to their first class, Jay lagging behind, as everyone hurried off, talking and laughing. 'Boy Jay, you're out of it no doubt. Maybe Mr. Torvald's class will be better' he thought, walking around. Classes didn't start until the next day, so Jay obviously had nothing better to do than to go up to the roof. Terri and Jay had gone up t the roof a lot in the year they had known each other, and however many times he went up here, he still never got over the initial excitement. But…this time Terri wasn't there. Terri was now…nothing more than a memory deep in his mind. He wiped a tear forming in his eye and lifted his guitar onto his back, walking off the roof. It was just too painful at the moment. Someday he would go back…. After the assembly, Kristy, Lori, and a couple of Kristy's friends all gathered by the entrance, all with their instruments. \"Well, I think this campus could use some livening up\" one of the girls, Casey said, raising her tenor saxophone to her lips and playing a jazzy melody. Lori grinned, took her sticks and banged a jazz beat against the concrete. Kristy joined Casey with her alto, the two voices blending well, as Cassie, a flutist and Rachel, a singer began to vocalize and play. All over the campus, people started to pick up, raising their instruments, following along as the music flowed through Lori, \"This is so cool!\" she shouted as a violinist played next to her ear, changing the tone from jazz to country. Almost immediately everyone changed their tone. And now, as Jay was walking down and heard the band, he looked over and saw that girl again, drumming. \"She's a drummer\" he said to himself. \"Hey Jay!\" a voice called, Jay turned around to see Denise with her violin, \"Give us somethin' on the guitar!\" Kiwi said, Jay shook his head, \"Naw guys. I'm gonna pass on this one.\" He said, walking off, catching the eye of the girl. He grinned slightly before hurrying off just as everyone sang out one last note, \"Hey, that was awesome!\" \"Yea, well, welcome to Bristol-Hillman my friend.\" Casey said, grinning wildly. Lori smiled and looked around, she was gonna like it here, but suddenly her eye caught something. She turned around to see someone hurrying off, the guitar case blocking her view. ' Weird'[Chapter 3] (kinda of a funny chapter...plus where Jay and Lori meet...) That night when everyone else was settling down and in their room, Lori was out prowling around, investigating the dorm. She was in the lobby when she saw something outside and opened the door, shutting it behind her. She saw a squirrel run into a bush, \"Ok. Then.\" She said, turning to go back in, but then realized she had locked herself out, \"Brilliant!\" she called to no one, banging on the door, hoping someone could hear.her. She saw a shadow come down the hall, THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!\" she said as she saw a guy come around the corner, his hands slumped in his pockets with his spiked blonde-tipped hair looking down. His head shot up, his hazel eyes surprised. He stood at the door, cocking an eyebrow as Lori knocked on the door, \"LET ME IN! IT'S COLD.\" She said, banging on the door. Jay just shook his head and waved her off as he started to walk away, \"DON'T YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME, YOU….YOU PEROXIDED MONKEY!\" she shouted. Jay turned around, amusement in his eyes before starting to walk off again, \"HEY! HEY! TURN AROUND! WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM SKIPPY?\" she yelled. Jay looked at her before going back over and opening the door. \"What's you call me?\" he said, his English accent drawling. \"Ooohhh…you mean the peroxided monkey or…Skippy?\" she asked, looking at him. \"Well, the peroxided monkey doesn't think that I should let strangers into the dorm.\" \"Come on dude. It's like…late.\" \"Do you know what time it is?\" \"Nope.\" She said, looking annoyed. \"Wellup, I guess you're stuck. Unless you happen to have a banana with you, you're out of luck.\" He said, \"WAIT!\" He shut the door and walked off. \"YOU ARE GOING TO BE ONE SORRY Lori sat outside the door until Kristy came down the halls, until Lori was once again banging on the doors, \"LET ME IN!\" \"JESUS….\" Kristy started. \"DIED ON THE CROSS.\" Lori said, coming inside, rubbing her arms. L.A. or not, it still gets cold. \"where have you been?\" \"I saw a squirrel…and then this English kid wouldn't let me in..\" \"Oh, Jay. Well, he does that to everyone. He thinks he's super-cool. Come on. We gotta big day tomorrow.\" Kristy said as they walked up to the dorms, BEEP BEEP \"Kristy…make the loud noise go bye-bye.\" Lori said, pulling her pillow over her head drowsily as the alarm clock buzzed. Kristy half-heartedly threw a shoe, striking the clock so that it fell and just made it louder. \"Mmmph.\" \"Wake up Lori. We got classes.\" Lori sat up, her hair sticking up, her eyes half-closed. Kristy laughed and started to get ready when Denise came in, \"Hey girl! Haven't seen much of ya since we got here!\" Lori knew Denise because Lori worked in her mom's store and she was the one who taped Lori to get in. \"I know, right? Let me get pretty first…\" \"That could take a while.\" Jay noted, walking past the room. Lori rolled her eyes at him, \"He's so annoying.\" She said, grabbing a pair of jeans and a shirt with a rocking blue guitar with graphics around it. \"Let's go!\" ","Summary":" (Redid the plot a little bit. so it's re-vamped.

Looking at him now, he just feels numb. \"Hi, David,\" says William Somerset, and extends his hand. It's wrinkled and leathery now from his days in the sun, like a rotting fruit. Mills stands up, a little lightheaded, and gives Somerset's hand two quick pumps. He does not meet his gaze. \"I've signed all the discharge papers. We can go now.\" He gestures towards the two paper grocery bags at Mills' feet, overflowing with torn sweatshorts and crayon drawings. \"Need any help with those?\" Mills shakes his head. He realizes that he's picking at his cuticles and exposing his left wrist, which Somerset is staring at; he shoves his hands into his pockets. Somerset turns up the corners of his lips. His dull, tired eyes don't change. \"We should get going, then.\" They walk into the sticky June heat. Mills isn't used to being outside. The air's too heavy, too alive. The sun makes his eyes ache. A mosquito lands on his arm and his body twitches as though he's gotten an electric shock before brushing it away. Somerset stops in front of a gray Ford pickup truck and they get in, driving out of the city, driving away from the wives and babies and every evil thing that lives there. \"I'm truly sorry I didn't visit you in the hospital, David. Things have come up over the past couple of years, but...oh, but that's no excuse. The truth is, not many of your doctors thought you should come stay with me again…\" His grip tightens on the steering wheel. \"Well, I was somewhat inclined to agree with them. But it's calmer where I live now.\" His grip relaxes. \"You can get a job again: be a farm hand, or feed store clerk, or something…\" Mills thinks that he's going to start pounding his head against the dashboard if Somerset keeps talking, but he doesn't. He turns the radio on. For several minutes they both half listen to bombing raids and foreign elections, when the presenter says \"And now we'll hear from motivational speaker Seth Howard, who's just published Last Judgement: The True Story of John Doe, detailing the murders and journals of the infamous serial killer who-\" and Somerset turns it off. They drive several more miles. Suburbs turn into cows in wide green fields and small farmhouses, one of which Somerset pulls up in front of. In the front yard sits a black and brown mutt with floppy ears and a shaggy tail. His bags forgotten, Mills jumps out of the car to greet it. \"That's Marjorie,\" says Somerset, his lips turning up in a small smile. \"She loves pretty much everybody, that dog.\" Mills isn't listening. Marjorie has galloped towards him and started licking his face. Mills buries his face in Marjorie's fur, mummering \"good dog, good dog,\" and some other gibberish that reminds Somerset of that long ago dinner in Mills' apartment. He sees that Mills is smiling; it's a tired sort of smile but a big and bright one nonetheless. Marjorie jumps up and pushes Mills onto the grass, and Mills is laughing as Marjorie's wet tongue goes in his ears and nose and between his lips. \"I've got lunch ready,\" he says a couple of minutes later when Mills and Marjorie show no sign of stopping their romp on the lawn. \"Or you could see your room, of course, if you're not-\" Mills stands up and dusts himself off. \"Food's good, yeah,\" he says, still patting the dog's head. The front door opens to a large, sunny kitchen with a table and four chairs. Through one of the windows, Mills notices three chickens pecking at the dirt. Somerset scoops soup into two bowls from a large pot sitting on the stove. It's light but hardy, filled with pepper and onions and artichoke, and as Mills wolfs it down in spite of himself he feels that familiar primitive heat begin to fill his gut once more. It's red hot magma bubbling below the surface of his skin. Become vengeance, David. Become wrath. \"Nice fuckin' place you got here, Somerset,\" says Mills, leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms over his head. \"Had plenty of time to work on it? Roast some chickens? Take your dog for nice long walks?\" Somerset enlaces his fingers on the table and looks at his soup, than at Mills. \"I've been a coward. I'll be the first to admit that.\" Mills slams his fists on the table so hard that his bowl falls to the floor and shatters. \"Oh, that's real FUCKING noble of you!\" He stands up and grabs Somerset by the collar of his shirt. \"Good old Somerset and the rest of the boys on the force, leaving me to rot.\" Spit lands on Somerset's face. He doesn't flinch. Marjorie, who stayed out on the porch, whines. \"Oh Christ, Somerset, why didn't you just let me die? Why didn't you just fucking leave me there? I miss her, I miss her, I miss her.\" He releases Somerset and collapses on to the floor with his head in his hands. He is faintly aware of screaming somewhere in the distance, before he realises that it is himself. two years ago His eyes are closed, but he's not asleep. Couldn't sleep, even if he wanted to. It was like this before the night that he curled up against Somerset in bed and let the older man wrap his arms around him. He inhales. Tracy. He exhales. My baby. He inhales. Tracy. He exhales. My baby. It's been about twenty minutes since Somerset's hand stopped stroking the back of his neck. This is how it goes. You make a mental list of everything around you that could kill you: the bleach in the cabinet under the sink, the plastic grocery bags discarded in the trash, the ledge on the roof of their apartment building. You make your decision. He started taking baths instead of showers last week. Mills gets out of bed without looking back at Somerset and walks through the darkness to the chair where he throws his coat. He keeps his razor blades in the pocket. When Somerset's not around, he rubs his thumb across the smooth edge and talks to his wife. He ran the water when Somerset was already half asleep and never drained it. It's freezing to the touch, of course. He wants it to be steaming hot so that every cut stings, but Somerset's a light sleeper. \"See you soon, babe,\" Mills whispers. And then he begins to undress. four years ago Moonlight showers the bed and the cardboard boxes surrounding it. So barren, Tracy Mills thinks, and yet it still feels like home. Our home. She feels a deep ache in her chest as she looks out the window at the stars. One of the last times I'll ever see those. She wonders if she is supposed to feel bitter towards David for uprooting her from the town , friends, and job she loves and yet she does not; they have just made love and he's spooning her, one arm loosely wrapped against her waist. Tracy places her hand on his and it moves up to cup her breast. She feels the soft tickle of his lips on the back of her neck. \"David?\" He grunts. Tracy can think of a million things to say, like do you think it's too late to back out of the apartment deal and let's fuck one more time, like when we were kids and i stay up at night thinking you're going to get shot out there, it's messier in the city, it's dirtier and cramped and full of gangs and i love you but what ends up coming out of her mouth is \"Do you think the dogs will be okay?\" David laughs and turns her over so that they're facing each other. The warmth of his skin and his bright hazel eyes make her feel silly for saying anything at all. \"Hey, idiot, I bet they'll love it out there,\" he says, running his fingers through her hair. \"There's all kinds of new shit to smell, probably millions of other dogs to smell; and hey; if we've got a rat problem then they'll take care of it. They'll chew up all of the little bastards, leave them on our bed for us to wake up to-\" She laughs and punches him on the shoulder. \"That's disgusting, David, stop it-\" \"-you can roast them and we'll have rat and gravy, rat tails instead of spagetti, little rat eyeballs in stir fry-\" \"Oh, God, I'm really gonna throw up.\" But of course she doesn't, it's just same old David, ever since they were fifteen he's made her heart burst and throb with happiness, and as he rambles on she just says \"I love you, I love you,\" and then he's saying it too, and before they know it they're asleep in each other's arms. This is just one of millions of memories that Mills can never destroy, no matter how hard he tries. \"This book has truly been a labor of love for you,\" says the host. \"You were able to gain access to hundreds of these gory, disturbing notebooks - something many journalists have tried to do, but were turned down by investigators…\" \"Well, Gwen, I credit my career to that,\" says Seth Howard, chuckling. \"Communication is a big key to success. I always say, give respect, get respect. I'm tremendously thankful to all those fine police officers who permitted me to read the notebooks for myself.\" \"But you weren't able to speak to Detective Somerset and Detective Mills about their experience on the case or the murder of Tracy Mills. They've never talked publicly, but did you at least attempt to reach them?\" Howard frowns. \"In a manner of speaking, Gwen. In a manner of speaking.\" \"What do you mean by tha-\" \"Mr. Mills spent some time in a mental institution shortly after being released from prison, God bless his soul,\" he continues in his Southern drawl, \"and Mr. Somerset retired. Pretty much lived off the grid since then. And I say,\" Howard continues, raising his ring finger in the air like a politician making a speech, \"those poor old boys deserve some time for restin'. Talk about a traumatic experience, Gwen! But if they're feeling up to it someday, I sure would like to speak to them. Yes, I'd love to sit down and have a talk with 'em a whole lot.\" And he grins with all of his bright teeth, a row of ivory tombstones.

All I own is the writing itself, and any original features and / or attributes portrayed within said writing. A/N: I needed to take a small break from all the anime fic I've been writing, so I came up with this. xD Enjoy! I--I I'm sitting inside the interrogation booth, staring out the bulletproof glass. Station's not very busy at the moment. I guess they're all preoccupied with me and my current 'situation'. They told me to wait in here until they figured out the next step. You know, sort out the paperwork. Paperwork was all there was left to sort out now that John's brain was splattered all over the side of the fucking road. It feels like I've been sitting in here for hours. I really don't know what they'll do with me at this point. Maybe they'll ask me to plead guilty. Maybe they'll try for insanity, defend it with 'emotional trauma'. Hell, maybe they'll even try to get me off scott-free. I buried my head in my hands, ran my fingers through my hair. My mind was clear. Barren of thought, free from worry, emptied of any traces of regret. Or any emotion I may have had left, for that matter. Anything I could have salvaged after the incident...was just... gone . It didn't matter to me, to be honest with you. I really didn't give a shit what happened to me next. Nothing that happened could possibly take anything more away from me. They might send me away for life, but that's already been taken from me because you're gone. What would I even do with the rest of my life if I was set free? Continue on with my job, working endlessly with the monotonous routine while pretending everything's just fucking dandy? Live my life? Meet somebody else ? I couldn't. I couldn't find anyone that meant as much to me as you. No one could replace you. Finding 'someone else' would be disrespectful to your memory. So this is in your memory. I stood up and walked over to grab my coat off the rack by the door. I knelt down on the floor to hide it from view before reaching into the back pocket. A quick glance out the window to see if anyone's watching. Somerset's walking out the station entrance. He was in here a few minutes ago, talking to me, trying to empathize. I appreciated the effort, but no words of wisdom would minimize the shock. Not this time. I think he knew it, too. Somerset put on his jacket, flipping his collar before he headed out. He glanced at me for a split-second before he walked out the door. I could see it in his eyes. He knew. Good old Somerset. He knew everything, didn't he? But he didn't try to stop me. Wonder why. I turned around and slid to the floor, sitting up with my back against the wall. I pull out the wallet from my coat pocket, and continue my search. I find it. I unstrap the emergency .45 from my ankle and pull back the hammer. You're dead. My child is dead. The herald is dead, his grand cry left unheard. I guess there's only one left now, isn't there? This is the only way out of this hell, the only way I can ever see you again. The final ending, the last resort. Hopefully, where you've gone, I can follow. I hope God's in a good mood today. I quickly put the gun to my temple. My finger's shaking against the trigger. I hold up the picture of you in my other hand, the picture I pulled out from my wallet. Your smiling face will be the last thing I see. That's fine with me. It's kinda funny, you know? We vowed to be together until death did us part, yet promised to love each other through eternity. I think I'd rather keep the latter.

I love the killer. I always do love the bad guys and so I thought I'd try and get into his head. Disclaimer: Don't own the movie 'Seven' It was an interesting day today. I went out for a walk. I thought it would help me think. It did. It was not peaceful. It only gave me more reasons to finish my work. It strengthened my convictions in what I am doing. I contemplated the effect Gluttony, Greed and Sloth had already achieved. It was good. I spotted Lust hanging around outside a club. I was…tempted to carry though the next phase of my plan then but decided against it. It could wait. I was content to allow things to ferment for a while. I would give her over to her evil desires a few days longer. The walk was of an acceptable length and I returned back to my apartment building in a state of…I would not say contentment…satisfaction. I know the value of what I am doing, whether others perceive it now is irrelevant, they will see it in time, when my work is complete. You can imagine my surprise when, as I made my way down the corridor towards my dwelling, my footsteps making no noise, I was drawn up to a halt. Wrath was standing outside my door. I was stunned for a moment, I admit. I just stood perfectly still, watching them, and all my admiration and that burning envy that pierced my gut like an arrow and ate away like acid, rushed back through me. Once the initial shock wore off I was able to contemplate what I should do. They really were totally oblivious to my existence. How they actually managed to find me with their awareness handicap I really cannot fathom, which increased my admiration more. But I had to put my admiration on hold for the moment. If I were captured then months of planning and careful preparation would be destroyed. I will not allow myself to be taken until such a time as I walk up to Wrath with my hands at my sides and covered in the blood of my sin. Oh to see his face! I am anticipating the reaction… the moment. The object of my envy will experience the delight of triumph before he falls into the depths of deepest despair. I do wonder how he will survive afterwards with the knowledge, but I don't suppose it really concerns me. I shall not be here after all. Ah, the last and only survivor of the seven deadly sins. I hope he appreciates the title. However, I stray from the events that have caused me to write. I stood there, silent and unmoving; a shadow in the darkness, and my hand lightly clasped the gun in my pocket. They saw me in the end. I had no choice but to open fire. I couldn't not hurt one of them deliberately. For the sake of the grand design if they were injured then it must be so. Wrath though…Wrath could not die. To destroy the object of my envy?! A strange concept and one I could not entertain for a moment. If he perished then all the planning would have been for nothing. I could not allow that to happen. I had ample time to draw out my gun and fire off some shots. It took them some few moments to realise who I was. I hit Wrath. It was only sensible to wound him. That would make his pursuit of me less likely. If the other followed me then necessity might dictate for me to kill him but he is not one of the sins. He is expendable. I underestimated Wrath again though. He pursued me admirably. If my whole focus were not on escape then I may have told him so. He even managed to wound me. I had to ring him up and commend him on an excellent job. He really is quite amazing. I can think of no other to be the object of my envy. I scared him though. I had power over him. The power to decide whether he lived or died. It was tempting. I considered it only for a moment though. I held the gun to his head for a time just to watch him shake. To let him know that I could …but killing him would defeat the object, so I let him go. Things must be accelerated now. They close in quickly and I must finish my work before they do. Those few days I was willing to give Lust will have to be retracted. I will finish this. ","Summary":" I just loved this scene in the movie so much that I had to write it. I love the killer.

He smeared his stubby little fingers onnthe front of his already greased shirt, that despite being the xxxlnsize, couldn't fit his enormous body properly; it strained fromnpressure in all the places, and on the seven rolls of fat that werenvisible on his stomach. He took another mouthful of his hamburger andnheaved his body towards his car. He hated when the drive through wasnclosed. He considered complaining to the management and tell them tonhurry and hire more people, so that the drive through was alwaysnopen, but he decided once again not to, it simply required too muchneffort on his part, and he was feeling more and more tired lately. Itnwas hard for him to walk these two feet from the door to the car butnfor this heavenly food he was willing to sacrifice himself. The carngroaned under his weight and sank down a few inches more to thenground. He already had to get the back seat behind him removed andnthe front seat repositioned, which cost him quite a penny but atnleast now he had plenty of stomach room. He positioned the five bagsnof hamburgers and fries on the seat next to him, some for the onenmile drive home, the rest in case he got hungry during the night.nHaving finished his hamburger, he dived his hand into the fry bag andnstuffed them into his mouth, smacking loudly and wiping his mouthnwith his sleeve. With his free hand he started the engine ignoringnthe beggar who sat across from the entrance with a small metal cupnand a strange gleam in his eyes. If it was up to him, he would havenall of those weirdoes removed from the streets. If there was anythingnthat spoiled his appetite slightly it was people like that beggar.nFortunately the slight ruining of his appetite never lasted verynlong. The unfaltering gaze of the beggar made him nervous, sending anquick bang of fear across his heart. He reached quickly for the nextnhamburger as he drove away, never glancing in his rearview mirror,nbecause he was afraid of seeing those strange eyes still looking atnhim. Envynwatches the man as he half walked; half heaved himself out of thenrestaurant. He felt disgust for the man, but was envious as more. Thenman may have been disgustingly obese, stupid and ignorant but atnleast he had a home, clothes, something to keep him warm at night andnalways had enough to eat. He had nothing; he slept in parks, onnbenches, in wet, dirty cardboard boxes. His clothes were torn andnpatched in various places. He was always cold when the chill wouldnbegin and had to depend on stranger's sympathy for a few bills tonhave something to eat and drink. The fat man never gave him anything.nNot even a dime or nickel, even though Envy knew he had it, more thannthat, he always had a lot of money on him, in case he needed morenfood, Envy guessed. He envied him that he never had to worry aboutntomorrow; each night was the same, each night the man would leavenwithout giving him any change at all. His body was growing weaker andnweaker. He looked at the youth slouching against the wall, wearingnbaggy jeans that slipped down his behind half way. How he wished henhad the strength of the youth across the street. Things would havenbeen better for him, he could find a job, get money, rent a room…butnalas things weren't meant to be like that apparently. Sighing as hengot up, he reflected on what to do next. He had the sudden urge tonfollow the fat man home. The first time he followed him, it wasncuriosity, to discover what kind of man he was. Then he would gonthere, just to feed his envy. The urge didn't come often, but whennit did, he couldn't resist it. His mind made up he started walkingnin the direction of the fat man's house. Slothnreadjusted his falling pants and for the fifteenth time in the pastntwo minutes, wished he had a car. He hated the bus, but hated walkingneven more. He cursed his mother again for nagging at him again aboutngetting a job. If she'd just shut up for five minutes! She wouldn'tnstop, so he had to roll off the couch where he was sleepingncomfortably, until she came nagging. What he usually ended up doingnwas to take a bus around the town, and sleep. When he came back, henwould tell her like always that he looked but didn't get anywhere.nShe always bought I and it gave him a day or two of peace beforenshe'd come nagging again. His body itched, and he knew he shouldnfinally take a shower, but he was simply too lazy to do so. Henthought angrily about all the shows he would miss because of hisnmother, and he kicked the wall angrily. A sound of a woman's highnheels clicking came up from behind him; he turned his head to watchnher approach. She left him breathless and was gone before he could donanything. Lustnwas indeed a beautiful woman. She was dressed in a revealing redndress, that accented her breasts, and hugged her firm behind, allntopped off with a pair of elegant high heels. Her long, blond hairngleamed in the light, and her emerald green eyes shone with whatncould be mistaken for a mischievous glint, was in reality a cold,ngreen ice. Her walk alone left men drooling, but it was her body thatnleft them, defenseless and at her mercy. She noticed the youth'snstare but passed him without a glace. She knew she'd earn nothingnfrom him. But soon she felt a new pair of eyes seizing her up andndown. She smiled to herself, as she swung her hips a little harder.nShe eyed him as he approached her and noted his briefcase and anstripped, tie suit. He was quite good looking, and his hair wasnneatly trimmed back. A young executive, she guessed as she smiled atnhim invitingly; they were usually loaded with cash. This wouldn'tnbe a wasted night after all. Greednwas an impatient young man, he wanted everything and he wanted itnnow. No matter what the cost, he would have it. If he had to walknover dead bodies, chances are he would, but would have someone elsendo the dirty work for him. As a beginning business man, he madendecent money but he wanted more, much more. He wanted promotions, henwanted to get higher, and he wanted to be on top. He wanted money, anlot of money. And when he had that, he wanted even more money. He hitna goldmine in the form of his fiancé. A shy, timid girl, withnreddish-orange hair and freckles on her face, she didn't get asnmuch attention and was pleasantly surprised when he started to paynher flattering interest. He didn't care so much about her as muchnas he did about the fortune she would inherit from her old man, afternhe died. And although old pops looked pretty good for his age, Greednwas hoping that he wouldn't last very long. The old man didn'tnseem very happy at their engagement and told them so. Greed ignorednhim figuring it was just an empty threat at the old man's part. Butnwhen his fiancé announced that her father cut her out of hisnwill, blood boiled in his veins. Angrily he told her that thenengagement was off, and left the shocked girl behind, slamming thendoor shut behind him as he left. If there was no money involved, hensure as hell had no intention of marrying her. As he walked thenstreets he wondered what to do next. The more he thought about it,nthe more he realized that he handled it badly. He blew her off whennhe should have told her that it didn't matter, and that they'dnstill get married, they'd just have to keep it quiet. Then waitntill pops changed the will again and then stall long enough till hendied off from some disease. He'd just have to fix it tomorrow he'dnshow up with flowers and with black lines under his eyes. He grinned,nthe chick was easy to fool, and she would buy it easily. But thatncould wait till tomorrow, he'd give her time to calm down, hendidn't like them all crying and hysterical. They were too clingynfor me when they were like that. He would rather have them angrynbecause once they got it out of their system; they were calmer andnmore rational. But now he needed a release of his own. His eyes fellnon the woman who came to his view as he turned the corner. He notednthe long, blond hair, the revealing dress that didn't bother tonhide the fine body it covered. He licked his lips involuntarily andnhe could swear he saw a flicker of a smile on her face but then shenassumed the same indifferent look as before. His mind made up henfollowed her, catching up with her as he seized her up and downnopenly. She didn't tell him to stop. Slothnwatched as the woman and the young stiff in the suit depart towardsnthe darkness. At least someone was getting it tonight. From thencorner of his eye, he sensed a new presence. He turned to eye thenstranger. He looked to be anywhere between early sixties to seventynat most. His hair was silvery white and cut military short. Hisnmustache was neatly trimmed, and apart from that, he was neatlynshaved. There was not much to tell about his clothes, because of thengrey raincoat he wore, buttoned all the way up. Sloth noted that thenman was looking at the blond and the young stiff walking awayntogether. His face was passive and unmoved; his eyebrows seemed tonmove close together before relaxing again. He moved his glance overnand stared directly at Sloth, who blushed involuntarily. He couldn'tnhelp it, there was something so fatherly about that look, and it madenhim feel ashamed for just standing there. He lowered his eyes andnstared at his shoes for a minute or two before lifting his eyesnagain, but the silver haired man was gone. Sloth looked aroundnuncomfortably before slowly starting to shuffle his feet home. He hadnsome things to think about. Oddly enough, he didn't mind walkingnhome anymore. Pride'snface may have seemed unmoved, but on the inside there was turmoil ofnconfused feelings. He ran into by pure chance, just before the rascalnapproached the blonde. He sighed inwardly. He warned his daughternwhen he heard of the engagement. He told her that her fiancénonly cared about the money, but she wouldn't listen. He cut her outnof the will to teach her a lesson. He wasn't planning on changingnit, just scaring some sense into her, so that she'd see what hernfiancé really cared about. Just as he predicted, he dumped hernthe minute he heard she wouldn't have any money. And it seemed fromnwhat he was seeing that he moved on pretty quickly he thought as hisnglance moved after the blond and his ex-soon-to-be-father-in-law,ndisappearing into the darkness of the night. He didn't want her tonget hurt, he just wanted her to learn a lesson here, and if it had tonbe painful, then it happened. He wouldn't call her yet, even thoughnhe knew she must be suffering badly. Pride would wait for her to comento him. She'd come back soon enough, she took after her mother; nonspirit whatsoever to stand up for themselves in neither one. Hisnglance strayed to the other side and fell on the youth in baggy pantsnwho was staring at him for the past few minutes. He fixed the youthnwith a stare, at which the youth had the decency to blush innembarrassment and lower his head. Pride felt a chill down his spine,nit was too cold for him, or maybe he was simple getting too old fornthis kind of weather. Setting a brisk pace he started off towards hisnhouse. Wrathnno longer felt like crying, instead anger settled in and took over.nShe paced angrily around her small apartment. How dared he do this tonher? She'd shown him. He would pay for this. She was tired of hownhe would treat her. Enough was enough. She dressed quickly and leftnthe house after carefully locking the doors behind her. Some habitsndidn't change no matter how angry you are. She walked quickly,nunsure whether he would be in the house or not. If he wasn't, shencouldn't run into him in the middle of the driveway, she would justnlose her courage. Her breath came in quick short bursts as she gotncloser to the house. But it was dark, no lights, no one was home. Shentook out the spare key and slowly walked in. The house was deathlynquiet. She moved around slow at first then picking up her pace, sonthat he wouldn't catch her in the middle of the living room. Shengrabbed the metal poker from next to the fireplace and ran upstairsnto his bedroom. She slid behind the door, gripping the poker in hernsweating hands. She'd wait, she could wait all night. No spiritnhuh? She would show him her spirit. Greednfollowed the beauty up to her apartment, a pleasant three storynbuilding that fortunately had no doorman. She already took off hernshoes, and as she stepped in the middle of her bedroom, she turnednaround to face him. In one move the dress was gone, and to hisnpleasant surprise, she wore nothing underneath it. He grinned as shenpulled him closer by his tie; he liked a woman who didn't waste anyntime. Prideninserted the key into the lock and turned it, stepping in through thendoorway and closing the door behind him quickly, before the cold airncould get in. Shrugging off his coat, he walked over briskly towardsnthe fireplace to light it. But when he reached for the poke, to hisnannoyance it wasn't there. He could swear that he left it there,njust this morning. Sighting, he slowly made his way up the stairs, tonlook for the missing poker, which he probably left by the othernfireplace in his bedroom and simple forgotten that he had done so. Asnhe placed his hand on the doorknob and swung the door open, he had nonidea that it would be the last thing he would ever do. Slothnentered the house silently, and tip-toed back to his room in thenbasement. He sank down slowly on the couch and started thinking. Itnwas something entirely new to him; he wasn't sure if it would benany useful to him, but he would have to find out. With that said, henleaned back against his couch, and got lost in thought for a verynlong time. Lustngot off the bed leisurely, casting a lazy look at her companion, whonslept soundly in the bed. The drug she slipped into his drink wouldnkeep him asleep for at least another hour or so, but she didn'tnwant to take chances with that. She gathered her clothes quickly, andnbundled them in a bag. She stepped over to the shelf, and reachednbehind the potted plant where she hid her little video camera. Shenwas pleased with the quality of it, and turned around to smirk at thensleeping form. He had let her play him like the idiot he was, atnfirst she was a little afraid but now she could see that he was nonsmarter than anyone one of the others before him. She reached intonher backpack, which she had hidden under the bed before, and took outna set of new clothes, that resembled nothing compared to the ones shenhad on before. She dumped the bag with the old clothes in thenbackpack and took out her handy little laptop. In a matter ofnminutes, she had an identical copy of the CD she took out of thencamera. Then she took out a pre-typed note and placed with the CD onnhis clothes were he was sure to notice it. She flipped through hisnwallet, taking down all his info, and place of work. She also found annice thick wad of bills which she pocketed easily, and then neatlynwiped anything she could have touched. With the backpack in hand, shenturned at the door and blew the sleeping form a fake kiss and closednthe door. You're going to wish you've never met me love, shenthought and then disappeared into the night. Thensound of the front door opening startled Wrath. He came back soonernthan she expected him to. But it was just as well, no time to coolndown, no time to get scared. That's how she liked it. She couldnhear him shuffling around downstairs, moving back and forth. How muchnlonger would it take? He was making her wait again, just like henalways did. She'd wait; he took her love away from her, her lovenleft because of him. It was time for him to pay for all he has done.nShe'd make him pay, for all those years of misery; she would havenher revenge finally. As she heard his footsteps, her heart started tonrace again, repositioning the poker in her sweaty hands, she grippednit tighter and raised it above her head. The door swung open, thensilver haired man walked in. Now! Before he turns around! Before thencourage disappears! She swung it hard, right on top of his head. Hencame down easily, crumbled after the first blow; the second one justnsent more blood flying, spraying it all over the walls and hernclothes. And then it was over, he was gone, dead, lying on the floornin a pool of his own blood. But she didn't feel as happy as shenthough she would. She felt…empty…She let go of the poker, lettingnit slide through her clammy hands to the ground next to her. She sankndown on her knees next to him. Still warm, yet so dead. Her handsntrembled and she tried folding them over her lap, but it wouldn'tnstop the trembling. She wished she was five again, mommy was stillnalive, but she was gone now, and so was he. She was allnalone…Shivering she walked over him carefully and made her wayndownstairs. She reached for the phone, and called the police. Thennshe sat down calmly in the kitchen chair and waited for them to shownup, when they would, she'd tell them everything that happened. Greednwoke up with a headache; rubbing his forehead, he turned his head tondiscover that his companion was already gone. He smiled broadly andnstretched. She not only turned out to be quite a lot of fun, evennmore than he expected, but also smart enough to be gone by the timenhe would be up. No point of them both being uncomfortable. This waynwas much easier. He figured that the place was rented for the night,nand her quick disappearance only confirmed it. He would have beenngone long before her, if it wasn't for the fact that he was reallyntired. It was as if his head just touched the pillows, and he wasngone. Not that it really mattered. He would go now. He reached fornhis clothes and his fingers touched a CD with a small note attachednto it. Slightly puzzled, he turned on the night light to read it. \"Itnwas fun love; I have a feeling you're going to hear from me soonnagain.\" He laughed and threw it carelessly on the floor. It wasnquite unlikely that they'd ever see each other again. He looked atnit closely one more time. \"P.S. play the CD before you leave. Itnshould explain some things.\" Puzzled even more than before, henlooked around the room for a TV. He found one in the living room andninserted the CD. He examined the note curiously; he didn't get itnas to why it was type up, as if she had it all ready before he showednup. The noises coming from the TV made him look up and he felt bloodndraining from his face. She taped it, she taped them fucking. Thenfucking bitch taped the whole damn thing! He noted furiously that shenmanaged to keep her face in the shadows or turned away, but hisnappeared very clearly more than once. He hoped in vain that thenquality was too poor so that there was at least a slight shadow ofndoubt that it was him, but the quality was very good and the soundntoo, for that matter. He slammed his fist down angrily. Now henunderstood why she insisted on leaving the lights on and closing thenblinds. And he like a complete idiot went along, stupidly thinkingnthat she just liked it that way. Fuming quietly he ejected the CD andnstarted to get dressed. He wrapped up his things and after makingnsure that no evidence that could point to his presence remained, henleft quietly and made his way outside. He looked at the fatal CD innhis hand, and after a moments thought, he crushed it angrily in hisnhands and scattered the remains as he walked. This wasn't over, hendidn't care how long he would have to wait, he'd find her and henwould make his move. Gluttonynbreathed a little easier once he made his way with his car into thenparking space in front of his house. He felt a bit bitter, now thatnhe didn't have to look at that horrible beggar anymore. Relaxingnhis bulging body and got more comfortable. It was his nightly ritualnwhenever he went out to get his food, he wouldn't go into the housenright away, instead he would spent some time in the car, eating hisnfood and looking at the sleeping neighborhood. He tried to relax, butnfor some reason he couldn't. His heart beat was accelerated and hisnchest was hurting strangely. He experienced it before, but ignored itnand it usually went away after a while, coming back occasionally. Hendidn't bother going to a doctor, because they were all idiots. Henwent to one years ago, when he was nineteen, and the dumbass told himnthat he had to go on a diet and exercise otherwise he wouldn't livenvery long. Doctors! They all wanted to tell you how to live. Well henwas having none of it. No one was going to tell him how to live,nespecially not what to eat. Minutes passed, but the pain wasn'tnstopping, it was just getting worse. Slowly he heaved his enormousnbody out of his car, and grabbing the bags with the remaining food innhis arms, he slowly wobbled towards his front door. He didn'tnbother taking out his keys, since he had left the door unlocked. Itnwas more convenient that way, and he never locked it when he went tonget food, which was really the only reason why he ever left thenhouse. With his arms full, he only had to use his elbow to open thendoor and didn't have to set the bags down and have to take his keysnout. His breath was coming a little too fast, and the pain was onlyngetting worse. He fumbled with the door knob, he had to get inside,nand he'd be safe there. His heart was racing now, and the painngetting even worse. It hurt so much, why wouldn't it stop?! Hisnwhole body shook and he was covered in sweat. His clammy, fat littlenhand finally managed to swing open the door open but instead ofnwalking through, he froze at the doorsteps. He could feel a pair ofneyes boring into his back. He turned around as fast as his body wouldnlet him and stared at the beggar's face once again. He was standingnon the other side of the street, and for another few seconds,nGluttony stared into those strange, gleaming eyes. He knew now, thenbeggar was death itself, and he had come to kill him and take hisnsoul away with him. His hands trembled even harder, and the bagsnslipped our of his hands, his chest felt as if it was about tonexplode, he clutched feverishly, grabbing at his last straws of lifenand then toppled forward, making the whole ground shake from thenimpact. He gasped one last time and then everything went black. Envynmade his way through the sleeping neighborhood, keeping an eye outnfor any patrolling squad cars. The few time that he wasn't carefulnenough, the vicious kicks he received were enough to teach him tonstay away from well lit streets and grow a pair of eyes on the backnof his head. He knew they only picked on him, because he was anbeggar. If he was dressed normally, and was shaved and cut, they'dnprobably wish him a goodnight as they passed him by, but instead theyngave him bruises and shaky ribs. The last few meters, he melted intonthe shadows, so that he wouldn't alert the fat man to his comingnpresence. He noted the fat man's obvious distress, and felt a pangnof curiosity as to why. It wasn't as if he had anything to fretnabout. He had a warm place to live, money and enough to eat as wellnhe thought with a wry smile. The sudden noise startled him and henlooked up to see the fat man heaving himself out of the car, earliernthan usual, which only confirmed his belief that the fat man wasnworried about something. His curiosity spiked even more; he steppednforward a bit, more than he usually dared. He froze, when suddenlynthe fat man stopped at his door and turned around. For a few seconds,nand what seemed like hours, Envy stared into the eyes of the fat man.nHe couldn't move, to save his life, he was rooted to the spot. Henwatched as the fat man's face changed from surprise to pure terror;nhe watched spellbound as the fat man clutched feverishly at his chestnand then toppled forward. The ground shook underneath his feet, butnhe still could not move, his eyes fixed on the mountain of meat,ndressed in clothes. Hesitantly he stepped closer, but nothingnhappened. He moved a few steps more, but the fat man did not stir.nCautiously he came close, till he was standing right next to the fatnman. Tenderly he tried to find some kind of pulse among the rolls ofnfat on the neck, but to no avail. The body was completely still, notneven the smallest sign of life; the fat man was dead. Envy stoodnhesitantly, pondering his options. It was obvious now, the fat mannwas gone, and nothing would help now. He couldn't call the police,nhe'd get arrested and thrown into jail, and he already knew whatnwaited for him there. His only option was to leave, leave beforenanyone else arrived. His eyes rested on the fat man's body one lastntime; as much as he hated him, he was the only constant thing allnthis time. His eyes widened, and for a second he hesitated. The deadnfat man's wallet was half visible, sticking out of the rear backnpocket. Envy's fingers twitched restlessly. Gingerly he wrapped hisnfingers into his sleeve and slipped the wallet out. His fingersnwidened, and his knees buckled. He was holding more money in hisnhands that he could ever hope for. He did not only expect to findnthat much, with it he could start anew again. A fresh start he wasnbegging for all these years finally came. He thought of his hiddenntreasure, sawn into the inside of his torn shirt. His only proof ofnhis true identity, he was hiding it, awaiting his chance. Hurriedlynhe slipped the wallet back into the fat man's rear pocket, and withna last look around, he slipped into the night once again. Daily Town Newspaper September 4th \"450 pound man dies\" MichaelnFord, 28 was found dead by one of his neighbors last night. Ford, whonweighted 450 pounds at the time of his death, was found on thendoorsteps of his house, at 11:07 pm. His death was ruled as a massivenheart attack and death was to be instantaneous. Doctors say that it'sna miracle that Ford survived to this age considering how he lived,nwithout a thought to his health or lifestyle. The police cannot saynwhether or not there was a robbery present. The deceased's walletnhad a few bills in it, and his front door was open. Apparently it wasnhis habit to leave the door unlocked when he went to purchase hisnsupply of fast food items, which he did every two days or so, thenneighbors said. Ford lived alone, and had no family; both of hisnparents have died when he was eighteen years old. For proceduresnsake, the police interviewed Jonathan Beyens, 31 who was the onlynperson visiting from out of town. His appearance attracted thenpolice's attention, because Beyens looked too thin, and sickly. Thenonly healthy part of him that seemed to look healthy was his eyesnwhich gleamed brightly. Beyens, who just recovered from a seriousnillness, came to this town to recover and relax. The police haveninterviewed a few more witnesses, but in the end the death was rulednto be from natural cause and the case was closed. \"Seventeennyear old gassed to death\" Antragic accident last night, led to a death of Jeremy Adams, 17. Thenyouth left his house last night to look for a job. His mother, anhospital nurse, left about an hour later, for an emergency shift atnthe hospital. Sometime after she had left, Jeremy had come home andnretired to his room in the basement, and then fell asleep on thencouch. It is unknown when the gas leak appeared, but it was found innone of the basement pipes. The Adams's home had a gas leakagendetector, but unfortunately it was located on the ground level andnthere was none in the basement. Jeremy's mother came home and wasnalerted by the alarm going off.

Septembern5 \"Family disagreement turns to murder\" Anfamily disagreement between father and daughter about her choice ofnfiancé led to a tragedy. Luis Roffel, 64 felt his daughternJulia Roffel, 23 was making a huge mistake when she placed her loveninterests. Since she wouldn't listen to him, Luis decided to cutnher out of his will, hoping to prove that the fiancé onlyncared about the money. This proved to be true, according to Julia,nwho overcome with anger and sadness, blamed his departure on hernfather. She sneaked into her father's home, and when he came back,nshe dealt him two blows to the head with a metal poker. Death wasninstant after the first blow, the doctors ruled. Realizing what shenhad done, she called the police right after, and turned herself innwithout a struggle. She has no other family, and her mother died whennJulia was just a child. She also refused to reveal the name of hernex-fiancé. Septembern28 \"Blackmail gone bad\" Aroundn1:30 am today, an elderly neighbor was alarmed by sounds of anstruggle and fighting coming from the flat above her. She knew thatnLillian Maxwell, 23 lived there, and occupied the flat alone. Shenphoned the police, but hearing the fighting getting worse, she wokenup her eighteen year old grandson, who grabbed his baseball bat andnrun up to Maxwell's flat. As he arrived at the door, the noisesnwere muffled. Making a split second decision, he broke down the doornand found the house completely trashed. He ran into the living roomnto find Lillian Maxwell being choked by a young man with short blacknhair. Seeing that Maxwell was already was turning blue, the grandsonnswung his bat, hitting the strangler across the back, causing him tonlet go of Maxwell, who fell backward, gasping for air. The grandsonnthen held the attacker down till the police arrived on the scene. Thenattacker was identified as Matthew Coover, 25 a young business man,nand the mysterious ex-fiancé of the unfortunate Julia Roffel,nwho killed her father in anger about two and a half weeks ago, and isnstill awaiting trial. The motive for the attack was unclear at first,nsince Coover refused to speak, but after a man stepped forward andnmade a statement, all was clear. The man admitted to having sex withnMaxwell, and was unpleasantly surprised to later find her gone, and ancopy of their night adventure burned on a CD for him. She wasnblackmailing him ever since, with breaks in between. A search ofnMaxwell's house revealed multiple copies of the CDs, with sevenndifferent men, among them one featuring Coover. With that out in thenopen, the motive was obvious, and Coover was charged with attemptednmurder with intent to kill and a few smaller charges. Maxwell wasncharged with numerous blackmail charges and held in prison hospitalntill her throat wounds and bruises have healed. In the end… Gluttony was buried in the local graveyard. A special coffin had tonbe made to hold his enormous body. Since not even six people couldnlift it, or carry it for that matter, a special mini-lift was used tonload the coffin into the car, and then loaded into the ground. Sincenhe had no family know, his funeral was attended by a priest and thenlift worker. About a week later, a member of a distant familynarrived, collected the money that was left, promptly sold all thenfurniture and the house, and left never to be seen again. Slothnwas buried in the local graveyard as well, but it was a different onenfrom the one Gluttony had. His was attended by his sobbing mother andna few of the closest neighbors who came to support her emotionally.nAfter his death, she threw herself into her work, and was soonnpromoted to head nurse for her hard work. She married again after anfew years, to a gentle and loving man. Pridenwas buried next to his wife, quickly and quietly, with as littlenmedia involvement as possible. The matter was hushed up, and soon thenmedia and the newspapers lost their interest in it, and abandoned itnto pursue fresher topics. Wrathnwas put on trial for first degree murder, but due to the fact that itnwas a crime of passion, and because she had pleaded guilty, the judgenlooked at her case with a more favorable eye, that he normally wouldnhave. Her lawyers worked their magic, and her mental abuse by hernfather, and lack of mother influence in her life, turned into mentalninstability which saved her from prison, and she was placed into anmental institution instead. Lustnwas charged with several charges of blackmail, but in the end theynmade a deal with her. She would plead guilty and for that she wouldnreceive a suspended sentence of fifteen years, and also she had tonpay back all the seven men back, from what she took from them thosenlast three years. All copies of the videos were destroyed, althoughnrumors floated that a copy or two still existed somewhere.

He just won't stop screaming that same line at me. \" What's in the box?!\" I would have told him after his disbelief that I was telling the exact truth- that it was the head of his wife- but what would the fun in that have been? It was better for him to find out for himself. After all, that wasn't all that was in there. I enjoyed watching him panic. I could tell through his nauseating hostility that he was full of wrath; he deserved to suffer for his sin, as did all of those other wretched sinners I'd taught a lesson or two to. But still... Oh, how I envied him. Of course, envy was a sin in itself, but what wasn't there to be envious about? He had a wonderfully ordinary life, with a beautifully ordinary wife. There was more to that box than just the face of his lover, her priceless facial expression almost perfectly preserved. That box, once peered in by the detective, wouldn't only contain the pretty little decapitated head of his true love, but it would also contain his downfall. It would contain exactly what he deserved for committing such a dirty sin. Where would he be without her? His perfect little life would be ripped into shreds, and he'll never be able to put those pieces back together. I watched as tears rolled down his face; he'd seen exactly what was in there, and he could barely shoot me because of it- he was too paralysed in fear by the image to pull the trigger. But I could still see the wrath in his watery eyes. He wanted me dead, didn't he? I suppose I was prepared to die for my sin- after all, I'd spent enough time cleansing this filthy world of it. I suppose that would have had to meant that I had to go, too. Mills' wrath , my envy … In the end, sin always leads to one's downfall.

I left Mills and John Doe behind, making the mistake of thinking Mills could handle an unarmed murder suspect. Once I reached the path, I removed my sidearm and fired a single warning shot into the air. The strange van that had been approaching us promptly stopped in place, and its driver got out and quickly surrendered. He was holding a cardboard package in his feeble arms. His first choice of words put me at unease. \"Take it easy, man! I'm just here to deliver a box! This guy paid me to deliver it to a...\" He scrambled to read the address label. \"...Detective David Mills.\" I did my best to hide my bad gut feeling, took the package from the driver's hands, and instructed him to exit the way he came on foot. I then adjusted the microphone on my vest and informed the other officers where to secure this man for questioning. After he was out of the scene, I placed the box on the ground and grabbed my pocket knife. With the box appearing at this specific place and time, it didn't take much to realize this was another one of John Doe's brilliant machinations. When I opened the first two flaps, I spoke into the microphone again. \"There's electrical cables.\" It couldn't have been a bomb. It was too messy for that. Somewhere deep down, however, I already knew a bomb would have been better than the thing I was about to unveil. When I opened the remaining two flaps, all I could feel was horror. I couldn't believe what John Doe had put in this thing. It was a terrible sight, enough to make any sane man mad with a single glance. I struggled to speak to the chopper crew above me again. \"California, tell your people to stay away! Don't come down here! John Doe has the upper hand!\" I ran back to Mills, screaming at him to throw his gun away. If only I had never left him alone. \"I'm glad we have some time to talk, detective. I want to tell you how much I admire you.\" John Doe spoke in a monotonous manner as he knelt on the ground. Mills, being his usual impatient self, only sighed in annoyance as he shrugged the suspect off. \"Shut up.\" John Doe didn't seem fazed by this attitude in the slightest. \"But you were so amazing when you got that triple kill in Halo 3 the other day.\" This noticeably broke Mills's disinterest and caused him to twist his head in surprise. \"What'd you fucking say?\" The vigilante answered his question in typical manner. \"It's disturbing how easily a civilian can monitor the Xbox Live gaming habits of the city's police personnel. You impressed me so much, I wanted to play against you online some time.\" John Doe blinked before continuing. \"That's why I went to the store today to buy a 360 of my own.\" His voice now became colder. \"It didn't work out.\" It was clear he was just mocking Mills at this point, leading the young cop into the next phase of his master plan. \"When I found out their stock was sold out, I spent my money on another product.\" After a prolonged pause, his character became noticeably more eerie. \"I bought a PS3.\" Mills immediately drew his pistol in a fit of rage. He began fighting against his baser instincts as John Doe, now held at gunpoint, remained frighteningly calm. When I reached the spot where I left Mills and John Doe, I saw it was already too late. Mills turned his gun away from the suspect only to wave his hand toward the location where I stopped the van. \"What's happening, Somerset? What's going on over there?\" I was out of breath and struggling with the reality of the situation myself when I replied. \"Put the gun down, David. Just give it to me.\" John Doe, seemingly oblivious to the argument between Mills and myself, narrated his thoughts out loud. \"Because I envied you for owning a system made by a company that actually respects its costumers and doesn't rely on enhanced ports and lawsuits to make a profit, it seems Envy is my sin.\" Mills now became more frantic toward me. \"Come on, what's in the box? Tell me what's in the box!\" Shocked, horrified, and unsure of everything around me, I could only repeat my previous words to Mills. I knew his mind couldn't take if I gave him the honest answer. \"I'll tell you after you put the gun down.\" John Doe now began to goad directly to Mills. He knew he was in complete control of the situation. \"Think of all the things I did with that PS3, detective. I got to see Final Fantasy XIII with slightly better textures. I downloaded all the extra costumes in Tales of Vesperia. I played Metal Gear Solid 4.\" Mills now turned back to John Doe and pressed the barrel of the gun to his temple, showing even more instability in his emotions. \"You lie! You're a liar!\" A smile crossed the suspect's lips. His voice became hopeful as he embraced this threat as part of his grand destiny. \"Do it, detective. Become vengeance. Become... Wrath.\" All of my worst fears came to life. This was it. This was John Doe's greatest work. I doubted I could save Mills now, but I had to try. I struggled to plead with him the best I could. \"If you murder a suspect, you... you'll be throwing everything away!\" As Mills wallowed through denial and despair, I was able to collect a few more pieces of myself. I then explained the gravity of this scenario to my partner in a calmer way. \"David, if you kill him, he will win.\" Mills's gun hand began to shake. There was no question his emotions were at war with each other, and I wouldn't have been surprised if he had vomited on the spot. His words were few. \"Oh, god...\" His face contorted in a storm of confusion and rage. There were many times I thought he was about to begin sobbing. He knew this was his career, and possibly his own freedom, at stake. However, the horrible atrocity John Doe had committed required retribution. I can't say for sure what I would have done in Mills's shoes. \"Oh, god!\" Now he was losing it. Sensing sweet death to be near, John Doe closed his eyes and entered a meditative state. Seconds later, Mills knocked him down with a single bullet to the head. He then unloaded another half dozen or so rounds into the bloodied corpse, just to seal the deal. John Doe, serial killer and Sony enthusiast, lie dead in the field. The poor rookie who did him in would require months of therapy before he could even be considered a shell of the man he once was. I watched when they loaded Mills into the back of a squad car, his eyes staring straight forward and his face frozen in an expression of lost emptiness. I didn't know what to say. Someone on a video game message board once said \"Sony makes good consoles, and has a lot of third party support.\" I agree with the second part.

The sun hasn't risen, and the dark polluted sky still casts darkness over the city. What a horrible city this is. It is Hell on Earth. If Jerusalem is Heaven, then New York is Hell. My work will change the way people live their lives, I know that. I am aware that what I am going to do won't change the world, or re-path our destiny. I know this, but I am certain that the reaction of the world will be genuine. Shock. Horror. Fright. I will be a reminder, a symbol of good, of decency. What I am going to do will bring to the attention of every sinner how corrupt they are themselves. How my deeds are not crimes. I am absolving. I am not the sinner, I am the cleanser. The Seven Sins will be punished. And if gruesome and bizarre are what the world needs to comprehend, to realise what this justice means, how these lessons should be heeded, I am more than prepared to push my conscience to the extreme. I awoke a few hours ago. I realise why now. I had fallen asleep watching Greed on the midnight news bulletin. The lawyer, the fighter of justice! He had defended a paedophile in court, and he had won the case. This man, this middle-aged schoolteacher walked shoulder to shoulder with his Defender. I cried and shouted at the television set. My neighbours banged on my ceiling for silence. The paedophile walked OVER TO THE MOTHER of the child as she sat weeping, and held his hand out in apology. I screamed. I remember this. Then I fainted. I woke again an hour later sweating. I had dreamt of this news article over and over again in my sleep, and I was unable to react. I watched the lawyer in his office, I watched him work, I watched him win cases for drug dealers and rapists. All I could so is watch. I am up before sunrise, and I see my nightmare had purpose. Focus. It is Friday and the Sloth's rent is due. I need groceries. I have a checklist as the final week draws to a close. I will pass by the lawyer's office on my way to the supermarket; no doubt, the press will be ready to interview him on his success . I cannot take the subway anymore. I prefer to walk now anyway. There are fewer people. I can prevent myself from vomiting and cursing when all I pass are children from the city school, the frequent homeless man. I take comfort in not knowing if they deal drugs. Using public transport however, the Park Avenue crowd are unavoidable, the disgusting beggars, with undisguised needle marks in their arms. Walking is healthier in a city of sinners. To avoid sins is not to ignore them; I think that to myself whilst I walk. I cannot risk ignoring sin. Ignorance is deadly. As my life draws to a close, I indulge in avoiding what sin I can, rather than let them overwhelm me. ","Summary":" The Birth of Se7en I have woken up early this morning.

He had not been charged with the murder of John Doe. Frankly, he did had not cared if he was or not. He was glad that sick son of a bitch was dead. He took his wife, his kid, and smiled at the thought of it. He had completed his masterpiece. Gluttony, Greed, Sloth, Pride, Lust, Wrath, and Envy. Seven words he would never forget. Somerset had testified at his trial and his testimony had been a big part in why he was not locked up. Seven people died thanks to John Doe. David Mills, however, has still alive, but when Doe killed his family, most of him died with them. He was empty now. William Somerset sat in his usual morning chair drinking a glass of orange juice and reading the morning paper. It was filled with the same old stories. More murders, more crime. He did not miss being a cop. He was glad that part of his life was over. But he would never recover from his last case, the most disturbing, shocking case of all. Never before in all his years had he experienced a similar case. To this day it amazes him. People had wrote books about it. John Doe was now famous. He had gotten what he wanted. He had won. Somerset would never forget when he opened that box and saw Tracy's blank eyes staring back at him. He had nightmares about it. John Doe killed seven people and got away with it. Of course, he did not blame David for it. He could not bring himself to. Monday Press photographers surrounded the small, dirty motel, waiting to get a shot of the murder victim. A prostitute was murdered and rumors were flying around about the crime scene. Detective Johnson parked his Ford Mustang and got out. Johnson was in his early thirties, with short brown hair and green eyes. Johnson walked through the sign in point and many news reporters began to swarm him, shouting out questions about the murder. Johnson merely ignored them and continued walking to room 207. He ducked under the yellow police tape and was met by Officer Paulson. \"What do we have here Paulson?\" Johnson asked him formally. \"Well it looks like the prostitute booked the room for two hours at about three in the morning. At about 3:50, the neighbors heard a gunshot. The victim has half her head missing and blood is covering the place. Not a happy scene Detective.\" Paulson told him. \"Thanks.\" Johnson walked in the room, checking his watch that read 9:07 The prostitutes body has not been moved. Her entire left side of her face was blown away. It was a sickening site. Johnson began to examine the crime scene but it was too noisy with all the chatter. \"Everyone out!\" He yelled. Everyone left the room. Johnson searched the entire room and found only one piece of evidence. One word. The word sent a chill through his spine and his jaw dropped in shock. On the wall in blood was the word Lust. The media was going crazy. Everyone lived in panic and fear now that word had gotten around. Another John Doe was on the loose. Everyone remembered the last John Doe, who had killed six people that had committed one of the seven deadly Sins. Greed, Lust, Sloth, Gluttony, Pride, Wrath, Envy were the deadly Sins. Many people were familiar with them now since it had not been that long since John Doe terrorized the city. The Chief of Police was under a lot of stress. He knew this would only be the first of seven murders to come. This time they had to be prepared, but how can you be prepared against someone who leaves no trace of themselves. How do you find someone who does not leave even a hair? You do not. The Chief only had one solution. He picked up the phone and dialed an old friend. William Somerset was sitting outside on his porch enjoying a hot cup of coffee listening to the rain fall. He loved finally being allowed some peace, not having to be solving case after case. It was almost 11:00 am now. His phone started ringing inside. He got up and went in, and answered it. \"Hello?\" Somerset asked \"William? Good to hear from you again.\" \"It's good to hear you too Chief, what can I do for you\" \"I'm calling in a favor old pal, I know your retired and all, but we really need you.\" \"I'm sorry, I can't go back.\" Somerset told him firmly. \"Please old friend, you're the only one who can solve this. You have to find him before he strikes again.\" \"Before who strikes again?\" \"John Doe.\" \"Impossible, he's dead.\" \"I know, but we have another one on our hands.\" Williams eyes opened in surprise. Another John Doe. \"I can't…\" William shuddered, he remembered the last terrifying case with a heartbreaking ending. \"Please, no one else will solve this before this guy strikes again.\" \"I didn't solve the case last time, you know that.\" \"I know, but you're the only one who has experience with this. We need you William.\" Was he up for it? One last case? Could he do it? \"I'll give it a shot Chief. After this, no more favors.\" \"I owe you a big one William. Thank you.\" He hung up the phone. There was one person Somerset needed to go talk to. David. He would need David on this case, he was sure. This would not be an easy case, as he remembered the last one. He severely doubted David would do it. After all, the man had lost his wife tragically. John Doe killed David Mills that day when he took his wife and unborn child from him. He had succeeded in his mission. David completed the seventh sin, Wrath, by killing John Doe. It took William an hour to drive into town and rent one of the cheap motels. He still hated this dirty, crime ridden city. After this, he was moving far away to a state where it would not rain this much. David still lived in his old apartment by the subway. He had no employment record since the incident. Somerset entered the complex and went to the apartment number. He approached it slowly, and knocked on the door. David opened the door slowly. David looked the same since Somerset had last saw him. His eyes were different though, they were not full of passion or love anymore, but with hate and depression. \"Somerset? What are you doing here?\" \"David, I came to ask a favor. I know you might say no…but..\" \"Come in.\" David opened the door all the way and allowed Somerset to walk in. Somerset was surprised to see how well put together David's apartment was. It was much cleaner than it had been. \"Can I get ya anything? Beer? Coffee?\" David asked. Somerset smiled. \"No thanks. I came here to ask you a favor David. Remember the Chief?\" \"Yeah.\" David looked away. \"Well he came to me and asked me if I wanted one last assignment\" \"And you took it?\" \"Yes, as a favor to him. Now will you do me a favor and give me a hand\" \"Depends. What's the assignment?\" \"Remember John Doe?\" This is where it started. David's eyes filled with hate, his face contorted with fury. \"How can I forget Somerset? He killed my family.\" David looked up at him. \"He took everything away from me.\" \"I know. This may be hard to hear, but someone is following in his footsteps. One murder happened today. Lust. \"No, no, no, no!\" David stood up and punched the wall. \"No, this can't be happening!\" \"I'm sorry to tell you this, but it is. And we have to stop him.\" \"I can't, I can't think about Tracy, it's too painful. All you and John Doe do is remind me of her.\" \"I'm sorry David. You know that. But we have to stop another guy from making more people feel like you. He's going to take people who are loved and kill them. \"I know!\" David had tears on his face. He wiped them off, and looked at Somerset. \"I'll do it. For Tracy.\" \"Thank you David.\" Somerset held out his hand and smiled. \"We're back.\" David shook his hand. It was almost like he forgot the whole entire conversation. He was focused on catching John Doe, and that was all that would drive him on until he was captured. Somerset knew if David was one on one with John Doe, David would kill him without hesitation. That was why he would have to keep an eye on him. Monday part 2 coming soon[Chapter 2] Somerset and Mills arrived at the police station shortly after noon. Rain was falling slowly, with short, low rumbles in the distance. An average day in the city. Somerset noticed many new faces hanging around the station, along with a few familiar ones that caught his attention. Mills stopped in front of the door and stared at it. \"I remember the first time I ever walked into this place. And the last.\" He said aloud. Somerset decided not to say anything and opened the door. David followed after him. Many of the officers who had known him greeted him and smiled, and Mills got many strange glances as he passed by. They all knew his history. What John Doe did to him. What Mills did to John Doe. It had been on the news for weeks. People wrote books on it, had television shows about it, and people had attempted to replicate it. None had made it past the first murder, since they left too many clues. The chief was pleased to see them and held out his hand. \"Mills. Somerset. Glad to see ya back here.\" Somerset shook his hand, followed by Mills. \"Not glad to be back but I gotta do my duty.\" Somerset said smiling. Mills just stood there, quietly. The chief handed Somerset the file. \"That's everything we got so far. Now I'm hoping you two fill solve this thing before it escalates.\" \"We will.\" Mills said, and walked off. \"I agree…\" Somerset said softly, and followed him, knowing the next few days could the be the longest in his life.

It wasn't fair of her, he kept telling himself, because he would never be able to say no. Still he didn't want to blame her. She was so likeable, so pleasant. Like the day he had met her for the first time at her and Mills' home. She had just looked at him in that enchanting, almost hypnotising way. Asked him why he wasn't married. About the city. Stuff that he normally wouldn't give much more thought. But she did something unexplainable to him. It became even worse when she had called him. Deep in his body, when he heard her soothing voice, he felt waves – waves of an electric, but thrilling, kind. Like being unarmed while chasing a criminal. He had stopped himself from thinking sinful thoughts. When she told him that David didn't know she was calling, he was almost hanging up on her. But of course he didn't. And now, she had just called him again. In the middle of the night. With a very persuading voice. It almost sounded as if she'd been crying. So what choice did he have? He got out of bed, put on some clothes – not really giving it any thought – grabbed his hat from the hat rack and threw his coat around his shoulders. Then he ventured out into the dark, rainy night.

I stop my work to watch the robin, leaning against the crude pick I hold in my hands. It lands on the fence post and stares at me through one eye. I stare back, not daring to move for fear it will start and fly away. It almost seems like a normal winter day. Almost. A harsh, biting voice cuts the stillness, snarling at me to get back to work. I enviously watch the robin fly away as I turn back to my work. If only I could have wings and fly away from this horrid, awful place and sleep . A year ago I would have thought it impossible to be this exhausted—tired of moving, heaving the heavy pick at the frozen, unyielding ground, tired of keeping my diseased skin stretched over my body, over the muscles that ached from shivering—and not fall over dead. Many of us have already. Women have fallen down among the muck and never get up again. They just leave them there and they are trodden on by the living, who are too deadened to care. Why are They doing this to us? I want to scream and pour out all the pain and agony in my heart. Why does no one help us? What have we ever done to Them to deserve this ? We dig our own grave as we starve to death, and They watch on and laugh. They do nothing but laugh cruelly and scorn us. How can They do this? What can we do to stop Them? Nothing. We are powerless. A flash blinds me and I look up. One of Their guns has caught the setting sun. I turn slightly and see the mountains. It's strange; in all the eternity I've been trapped here I haven't noticed the breathtaking view. Pure snow, blindingly bright in the setting sun, caps the proud, majestic mountains. It breaks my heart to look at them. I know I can't ever reach them from this filthy, hellish valley, trapped behind the barbed wire. But still I long to reach them. It comforts me to look at them, even for a moment. This hell isn't all that's left. There is still good. Birds still sing, people still dance, lovers still love. It can't go on forever. Surely this must end? As if in answer to my question, I hear a birdcall overhead and look to see the robin sitting again on the high fence post. It chirps again and I feel the dirt on my face crack painfully. A shot rings out in the cold air. I flinch, along with half a dozen others who are still conscious of their surroundings. The robin smacks to the cold earth and immediately tries to fly away, but is blocked by the labyrinth of wire it has fallen into. We watch it gravely as it struggles to free itself. It has a small hole in its wing and feathers lie scattered about the ground close by. We turn back to our work without a sound having been uttered. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- I wake early this morning. They haven't come yet to slap us awake. I try to ignore my aching body and go back to sleep, but once awake it becomes impossible. Instead, I imagine that I am not here, but free, at home, just lying in the wagon, wedged next to Riva in our bunk, smelling the sweet, sweet smell of hay and listening to Dade harrumphing and stamping about, getting ready for the long days march. It would be before They came to take us away from our wagon and dear old Čačuno and made us move from one stinking, rotting ghetto to another, packed in with other Roma, picking more of us off as we went. Before They packed us away in the loud, noisy trains. Before They took Dade away, before They took little Riva away, before They took Daj away. Back when we could dance and sing and live. They come, banging on the beds, shouting at us, and everything sinks back into place, into reality. The awful, awful stench of too many bodies crammed in close together, of sweat and dirt and filth and blood and fear and death, fills my nose. I'm back in my cage. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The robin is still trapped in the wire. I see it out of the corner of my eye as I pick at the hard soil. It struggles and rests, beating its wings against the sharp barbs, tearing itself all throughout the day. Is it day? The sky stays gray and indeterminable, like dusk, the end of the day. I vaguely notice that They are restless. They aren't laughing today, only talking to each other in low voices, as if we can only understand Them if They shout. Another decrepit figure falls next to me. I prod her, but she doesn't stir. I lie down next to her and look into her eyes. They stare blankly into nothing, empty. I envy her. I hear a harsh shout overhead; They are telling us to climb out the ditch. I simply lie there as the others clamber out, too tired to move, too tired to care. I wait for them to reach down to hit me, make me get up and go with them, but They don't. They think me dead.

The sun occasionally peeked out from behind, to bless the prisoners with some warmth. Dora walked in a ragged line, crushed between the bodies of the other women from her dormitory. The words of Gigliola repeated in her head. \"The elderly and the children don't work because the Germans are going to kill them all…they'll call them for a shower but the shower room is the gas chamber.\" Dora's throat tightened with pain. As she looked to her left, she was met by several cement structures, of which she had never entered. To the right were rows and rows of those dreadful barracks that overflowed with other ill-fated prisoners. Men and women with starved, feeble bodies, who arrived months before, sat outside, resting against the walls. She need not guess what the dark stains were on their soiled, striped clothing. One man, whose skin stretched tight over his ghostly face, looked as if Death had already come and taken him. A woman held his arm close to her body and used him as a pillow. Dora envied her ability to sleep, as she had not been met by slumber in over three, long days. She wondered if soon, she too would look as though all flickers of hope had left her body and made her empty of all emotions. As she questioned her decision to come to the camp, she was abruptly interrupted by a revolting smell, which hit her like a smack to the face. It was so pungent, it brought tears to her eyes. She held her hand to her nose, but the stench crept up through her closed nostrils, triggering her gag reflex. It reminded her of a time her hair had caught fire when lighting a candle on Giosue's birthday cake, but this was a thousand times worse. As she trudged into the large, foreboding, concrete yard, where she spent most of her days so far, she saw a heaped mound of clothes and belongings that towered before her. She began to feel an all too familiar feeling of being alone, confined in a small space, unable to escape, even though she was just one of the many insignificant prisoners spending their last days here. Her chest tightened, knowing the task that lay before her. Day after day, she came here and sorted hundreds of items of clothing, without truly realising who they belonged to. Perhaps it was her sub-consciousness trying to protect her from the truth. She took her place beside the pile and bent down to begin sorting. The pile, a mountain of dull greys, browns and blacks, provided little joy to her empty soul. The clothes felt rough and prickly against her delicate hands and the smell of burnt hair and flesh was soaked deep into the fibres. She pulled a brown jacket from the pile and a watch fell from the pocket. It had a black leather band and small circular face. She recognised it immediately. She turned the watch over in her palm and wiped her thumb over the engraving on the back. It read, \"Buon Compleanno Zio.\" \" Eliseo!\" She thought. This was the watch that she and Guido gave to Eliseo 3 years ago for his birthday. The thought of her husband's uncle being among those murdered, jabbed her in the heart and filled the hole with despair. She wished she could keep the watch to give her small comfort but she dared not anger the guards. Giving the watch one last soulful squeeze in her hand, she placed it down on the top of the seventeen other watches. The small amount of faith that she held of Giosue being alive vanished with the sight of the watch. She swallowed down her fears, buried her sadness, and continued sorting. As the minutes passed, the pile slowly grew smaller. The silence was heavy apart from the rustle of clothing. She found it almost peaceful, if not for the situation she was in. Her thoughts travelled to her beloved Guido and Giosue. She refrained from imagining that she would find their clothes in the pile and tried to remain calm and believe that somehow they had managed to slip past the guards. But her fears were overpowering and tried to escape through her blank face. She began to daydream about her life back in Arezzo. She reminisced of the time her and Guido sat on the top of a hill on a red and white checker blanket with Giosue playing with his toy tank. The sky was an array of pinks, oranges and yellows slowly disappearing beneath the horizon. The trees were swaying lazily and the wind whispered through as a lonesome bird sung out its lullaby across the land. As she reminisced about the good times back in Arezzo, one of the women beside her began folding a little grey jumper with pictures of bright red cherries on the front. Her heart skipped as memories of her little boy flooded into her head. She remembered walking down the street, holding hands with Giosue, when he saw a mannequin wearing that jumper. He ran to the front window, pressing his finger against the glass and asked Dora to buy it for him. She remembered Giosue running through the house, tugging on the string of his little toy tank as it rolled behind him, when a nail caught his jumper, tearing a hole in it. Giosue would not part with it and Dora had to sew it up. She remembered Guido's birthday when one of his presents was missing. Dora looked all around the house for it when she found Giosue sitting on the floor with a square object poking out from underneath the little jumper. She remembered that was the jumper she had dressed him in on the day of their capture. She had slipped the jumper over his head and put a jacket over the top. She pinched his cheeks and gave him a kiss on the forehead before she left to go pick her mother up. Dora returned to the present. She snatched the jumper from the woman and held it close to her face. A single tear pushed past her closed eyes and gently rolled down her cheek. Her stomach turned and she began to feel nauseous while her heart ached with crippling pain for her little boy. Suddenly three loud echoing taps of the microphone frightened her and interrupted her silent grief. She assumed it was just one of the guards giving orders in German to the army personnel but as her mind came back into reality, she realised this man was speaking Italian. \"Buongiorno principessa.\" Stunned by the voice of her beautiful husband, she stood up and began walking towards the entrance of the yard. All of a sudden, after some brief static, the voice changed. This voice was much softer and higher pitched. \"Mama!\" His voice was like music to her ears and filled her with relief. Her little boy was still alive. ","Summary":" The sky above was filled with grey, dreary clouds.

I cried at the end, and was pretty much spitting mad. So...what if there was a different ending? If it was up to me, this would have been the way that little family's story had ended...Please R&R;!* \" You must stay hidden, Joshua. Promise me.\" Guido's words echoed around Joshua's head as he hid in his little metal box. Joshua shifted his legs and giggled silently, liking the sound his shoes made against the metal. It didn't matter that he was cold, that the scary soldiers yelled and shouted....because he, Joshua, was going to win a TANK! He smiled, imagining it now. It would be massive and green, like the pictures he had seen in the flickering films with his father. But first....he peeked out through the small slit in the metal, watching the angry German men run around, their clothes lit up by the licking orange tongues of flame. Joshua flinched a little when a sharp rat-a-tat-tat rang out, making the hunting dogs howl nervously. He curled back into the wall of the box, wishing for his mother and father. I really wish the game was over sooner, he thought miserably, resting his chin on his knees and trying to fall asleep. Dora huddled in the corner of the shower house, her fist stuffed into her mouth to muffle her whimpers. She could hear kapos, the German guards, running and shouting loudly, and the guard dogs barking hysterically, obviously lusting for bloodshed of the frightened prisoners. The cold tile pressed into her back, making her shudder, but she cozied up into the tile embrace, grateful for its solidness. Dora was slightly sickened by her choice of hiding place- little kids, Joshua's age or younger, had died here!- but she had been running out of time and options. As rumbles shook the foundation of the building, Dora curled into a tight ball and thought of her family. Guido stumbled behind the soldier, his heart beating like a drum. \"I have to get back to Joshua,\" he thought frantically. \"I must-\" the cold muzzle of a gun pressed against Guido's sweaty neck. Guido shut his eyes tightly and slowly sank to his knees. The soldier barked something harsh in German, and seeing no comprehension on Guido's face, switched to broken Italian. Guido listened intently for a minute, then a chill ran down his back as he realized the soldier was saying, \"I have to kill you…\" over and over, like a broken record. The soldier looked very young, maybe only in his twenties. Blond hair stuck out from under his too-big helmet and the large, square hands that clutched the gun skidded along the barrel nervously. As the soldier shifted back and forth, a worn square of paper fluttered from the inside of his helmet. He didn't notice Guido reach cautiously for it, trying not to move quickly, knowing the guard might shoot at any second. The barrel rose from Guido's neck to his cheek. He froze for a minute but kept reaching for the white square until his fingers closed around the flimsy paper. Looking hesitantly up at the guard, Guido flipped the paper over in his hands. What he saw made his eyes widen. An adorable little boy beamed up at Guido, curls that must have been the color of his father's golden ones, sticking up all over his head. His eyes twinkled and his little mouth was opened in a permanent, somewhat toothless smile. Guido curled his fingers around the paper, peeking up at the young guard's face. The guard no longer wore a deep scowl but now had a wide, loving smile. His eyes gleamed with joy as he looked at the picture of his young son. Then a cloud passed over his grin. Sighing as he rubbed a huge hand over his face, he bent down and gently plucked the photograph from Guido's curious hands. The German carefully tucked the picture back into his helmet, and then looked at Guido with conflicted eyes. He was obviously struggling with what to do. Guido grabbed his arm and said in hesitant German, (after all, her knew a few words from the barking of the guards,) \"I have....son too. His name is....Giosue.\"he whispered. The soldier's face was astonished. He whipped out the picture of the little boy once more and whispered in German, \"His name is Joshua. It is the same, is it not?\" Guido nodded wordlessly, and understanding passed between them. They were both fathers, just trying to help their sons. The soldier's face was anguished, looking at his gun, then at Guido. Resolve steeled his face, and he breathed quietly, \"This is going to hurt.\" One father nodded, and closed his eyes, breathing shallowly. The other father raised his gun, aimed, and fired. Dora stirred, opening her eyes. All was silent. Cautiously, slowly, she opened the door and crept into the fresh air. Joshua woke up suddenly; his hand slipping against the metal side of his box. He looked outside curiously, hearing no loud bangs or foul smells. There were burnt papers lowing in the breeze, and broken furniture everywhere. Joshua slowly opened his box and walked outside. He looked around, but couldn't see his mom or his dad. He was beginning to worry when he heard a huge rumbling noise, and crunching gravel. Hardly daring to hope, he slowly turned around to see a massive green tank inching toward him. Joshua threw his hands into the air and took off toward it, shouting excitedly. The tank crawled to a stop mere inches from his tattered shoes and an American jumped out, beginning to speak happily to Joshua. Joshua had no earthly idea what he was saying, so he smiled slightly and looked longingly at the tank. The American realized this, smiling and laughing as he hoisted Joshua into the tank, lending him his helmet. Joshua laughed in excitement, happily munching on the piece of chocolate the American had given him. The tank rolled out the gate, past limping prisoners shuffling away from the camp as fast as their legs could carry them. Joshua craned his neck, searching for Dora and Guido. He spotted a grimy Dora sitting under a tree, searching the crowds worriedly. \"Mama!\" Joshua crowed, stretching his arms in Dora's direction. The American shouted something and the tank stopped, letting the soldier pluck his helmet from Joshua's head and lower the little boy to the ground. Joshua took off through the crowd of emaciated people, throwing himself into Dora's arms. Dora snatched him up, laughing in delight and kissing his cheeks. \"My boy,\" she whispered, tears tracking down her cheeks through the dirt as she clutched him like a lifeline. \"Oh, my boy!\" \"We won, Mama!\" Joshua shrieked. \"Look! There's the tank! Wait till I tell papa!\" he said, bouncing up and down excitedly. Five years in a concentration camp hadn't lessened him of his boyish attitude in the least. Dora's smile faded slightly from her tired face and again she searched the crowd, hugging her boy tightly. He cuddled up against Dora, resting his head by her neck, breathing in her familiar smell, content to now lay quiet in her arms. Dora searched the crowd with eyes that burned from the tears. Then....her face suddenly split into a dazzling smile as she spotted a familiar figure limping through the masses, leaning heavily on a stick. His foot was wrapped in bloody prison garb and his leg was bloodied, but he was alive. \"Guido,\" she breathed. Then Guido was there, and even though he was in great pain, he was hugging them and wiping away her tears, and they were one small complete trio in the mess and panic on that dusty road, on that hot day. \"Hush, princess.\" he murmured, a heartwarming smile spreading over his dirty and cut face. \"Thank god for guards with soft hearts,\" Guido muttered as he swept his family into his arms. One year later…… \"Mama!\" Joshua cried happily, his eyes sparkling and his face split into a smile. Dora swooped the little boy into a big hug, and then grabbed his hand and together they walked through the warm, sunny park. After a lazy stroll by the lake, they stopped under a massive, ancient tree where Guido sat reading a novel, waiting for his family. His silver cane, which was now necessary since he couldn't walk properly on his right foot since liberation night, lay next to him and glinted prettily in the sunlight. \"Hello, Princess,\" he said, closing his book and motioning for Dora to guide their eight-year old to the picnic blanket. She did, sitting down next to Guido and putting her head on his shoulder. As Dora watched her husband and son eat and laugh, she thought her heart might burst. \"Happy 8th Birthday, m'boy!\" Guido cried, presenting a delighted Joshua with a beautifully decorated chocolate cake. Joshua laughed in delight and blew out all the candles in one breath, his eyes tightly shut as he made a wish. \" Life is Beautiful,\" Dora thought with a laugh, flinging her head back and enjoying the moment with her family, together once more.

Put a man in a place where he can fulfill his wishes, and he will be as good as he can be. Put him where he least expects it, that's when his real nature will be revealed. A man sets off to the city to seek more opportunities for better life. Though not blessed with wealth, he is fortunately gifted with creating an atmosphere of genuine happiness that drags everyone around him. Nothing can hinder him to be the best he can be. To capture the heart of those close to him, he just gives them the feeling that life is, indeed, beautiful. But darkness looms, even in his little world. He and his family are drawn to see a glimpse of hell on earth, an injustice just for being deemed different. This adversity, however, doesn't make him fall. Instead, he desires more inner strength, essentially, to salvage his son's innocence. He puts on a smile for his son to hide the cruelty of man to his fellow. He creates a deceptive little world to preserve his child's vision of the world, to not let go of the ideal. He shows him only kindness and selflessness to imbibe in him that even in the most trying times, there is goodness, that not all are tarnished by selfish desires in expense of others' misery. Ultimately, he succeeds in his mission. His son is reunited with his mother, unblemished and pure as ever. But fate would have it that while his child exclaims 'we won, we won', our hero lies lifeless in a dark corner, anonymously, never to be honored the way he should be.

Theirrnhonest, pure love for each other would never leave, not even withinrnthe barbed-wire walls of this dusky hell. Theyrnwould escape and all get out, but not before Giosué got hisrnprize.

It was a child's finger. The toddler who was poking him couldn't be any older than three or four years old, and there was only one boy of this age in their barrack, or at least that's what everyone thought. \"Papa, papa!\" the boy whispered. Guido yawned silently, not wanting to wake up his barrack mates. He scratched his scabby hair sleepingly, and opened his eyes to find his little son Giosué smiling cheerily at him. \"What's the matter, Giosué?\" Guido asked in a whisper. It was dark outside, so it couldn't have been any later than midnight. He wondered why was his son still wide awake, knowing he was such a sleepyhead. The little three-year-old poked his cheek for a little more, and then grinned. \"It's snowing outside, papa!\" the little boy cheered. Guido felt exhausted after the day's work in the foundry, but he didn't want to disappoint his little son. Guido would never do that, he was too caring of his offspring to ever think of disappointing Giosué. He took a moment to show his little boy his greatest smile, and pretend to be wide awake. He then opened his eyes wide open and grinned at Giosué. \"Oh my, that's wonderful news!\" he exclaimed. \"That means winter is finally here. And do you know what does it mean, Giosué?\" the little boy shook his head enthusiastically, hoping to hear a brand new story from his father's imagination. Guido smiled and started creating a whole new story for his son's pleasure. \"Winter is here!\" \"But winter is not a nice season,\" Giosué argued. \"It's cold outside and I can't wear my shorts.\" \"Don't be silly, winter is absolutely great!\" Guido exclaimed. \"You know, back where I was born, we used to have tons of snow every winter.\" Giosué's mouth hung wide open. \"Snow?\" he asked. \"You got to play with snow every winter? That's not fair! It never snows at home. I want to have snow.\" \"Sure it does snow, every now and then!\" Guido told his son. Then, he winked an eye at him in a sign of confidence. \"You know what? I heard a story one day. It was very, very long ago, before I arrived to Arezzo. I think your mother told me about it, just to try and scare me off when we first met. Anyway, it is said that the last time it snowed in Arezzo was a long, long time ago, when you little misfit were not around yet. It was shocking for the city's inhabitants, you see - unfortunately, they were not used to snow.\" The thing is, with the snow arrived a man whose intention was to name the city of Arezzo as Addis Abeba. Addis Abeba ! Well, that man was not the kind of gentleman you can joke about - he was a prince, you see. He arrived to a great, enormous farm full with poultry and cows, and met a little girl named Eleonora, who was the first inhabitant of Arezzo to know of his royal condition. The prince told Eleonora about how he would bring rhinoceros and ostriches to the city and change them for the old and boring farm animals, which pleased the girl to excess. Then, when the prince was about to bid goodbye to young Eleonora, he heard some loud stepping in the barn, and walked over to see what had happened. From the barn fell a young, beautiful woman whom the prince thought of as a princess. The princess had been badly injured by a wasp sting, and the prince was luckily able to save her life by spitting the venom out of her knee. \"Did she survive?\" Giosué asked worryingly, because he was that kind of boy who didn't like sad endings. \"Of course she did,\" Guido laughed, smiling at the memory of something that had happened just a few years ago. \"The prince saved her from the most certain death. Soon enough, our prince met his princess in the strangest places you could imagine – in the town square, in the school...everywhere the prince went he seemed to jump into the beautiful princess he was growing so fond of! One day, they went to the opera – you know, fat ladies and bearded men screaming to the top of their lungs – and there he met a fat old man who wanted to marry the princess – and he wasn't even part of the city's royalty! So, in order to stop this insanity, the prince took his beautiful princess away with his car, and they drove until the car broke down. They spent a beautiful night together, with rain pouring over the city and praying the Lord to get them the weirdest things – a key, a hat...\" \"How did the Lord send them a key and a hat?\" Giosué demanded, his mouth agape with fascination. \"Well, you know, he's the Lord,\" Guido scoffed, trying to seem perfectly fine with it. \"He can do anything.\" Giosué nodded, so his father continued with the story. \"Anyway, let's go on with our story. One day, when the prince was serving – I mean, attending to an engagement party, and he was shocked to see it was the fat, non-royal man, who was going to get engaged to the princess!\" \"But that can't be!\" Giosué protested. \"The prince has to marry the princess, not the fat, non-royal man!\" \"That's what everyone believes, Giosué,\" Guido answered, clicking his tongue. \"But of course, the prince had thought it all very well. So instead of letting the princess follow the fat, non-royal man to a life of unhappiness and unroyality, he broke into the party riding his beautiful green Jew horse and took the princess with him away from the fat, non-royal man's hands, and they both lived happily ever after and had a little prince of their own.\" Giosué looked at his father for a few seconds, willing to hear more from him. But after that, the boy snuggled close to his father and yawned. \"I liked the story, papa,\" he whispered. He looked at the window and saw that, to his disappointment, snow wasn't falling any more, and the little amount of it in the ground wasn't curdling, so he wouldn't be able to play with the snow like he had always dreamt of. \"But the snow is gone.\" \"Liked? You must have loved it, my little boy,\" his father corrected him. \"And don't worry about the snow. When we get our tank, I will take you to the most beautiful place in the world. It's called the Mont Blanc, and it is always full with snow. There are even snow monsters and princesses of the ice here and there! I'm sure uncle Eliseo would love to take us there. He came with me and my dad when I was a little kid like you.\" The boy grinned at him one last time before falling asleep. \"I would love that, papa. But now we have to get some sleep, because we don't want the really bad people who yell to take points off us. Because if they do we will have to stay longer.\" Guido watched how Giosué's eyes slowly fell closed, and caressed the boy's hair slowly until he heard he was breathing regularly, fast asleep. Guido kissed his son's head and closed his eyes. \"Good night, my little prince. We will have our tank soon.\" Those were not good times for dreamers, but Guido still fought – in his own way, but still fought anyway – for their survival. He dozed off to sleep, dreaming about his principessa and her beautiful pink dress, back to that afternoon in the opera and those happy days in the city not so long ago. What Giosué didn't know was that the previous days before Guido's arrival to Arezzo, snow had fallen over the city for the first time in twenty years. ... ... ... So that was it! I know, not very long, but I enjoyed writing it! So please R&R;! Dawn xx ","Summary":" Guido felt someone poking his cheek softly. It was a child's finger.

I pretended that I was in the military, rapping away to the beat of soldier's footsteps. I had two pots; one small but deep, the other wide and shallow. Sometimes I'd wear the smaller one as a hat. Those pots were the only 'toys' I had. There wasn't anything to do in the bunkers. My father had lied to me, saying that the other kids were all playing outside, but in a different area. He said there were others that were hiding, like me. It was all one big game of hide and seek, and I was too young to know any better. But I remember the rainy, snowy, freezing days of boredom in that bunker. Staying on the top bunk every day, wishing that I was in a bunker with other kids. But that was a stupid thought, seeing as all the other kids were dead. I guess it was the combination of my father and I's stubbornness that saved me. He refused to give me up to the soldiers. He refused to tell me the truth. And I, I refused to 'shower.' I had no idea that it wasn't really a shower; that it was actually mass homicide—a slaughter house. To me it was water to make me clean, and I didn't want that. After that first offer, I was never offered a shower again. Not because they decided to spare me, but because they didn't know I was there. After all, it was just a big game. There was one day that I came close to being caught. It was raining as usual, and I was the only one left in the bunker. All the older men were sent out to work, including my father. This was usually the time my father told me to be the most quiet. He said that when they went out to work, soldiers would come and inspect the bunkers, looking to see if anyone wanted to resign from the game. They were very persuasive, he'd say. They'd try to scare me into quitting, but I had to stay brave and be quiet. He'd tell me to imagine all the kids they must have caught already, and see myself still staying, being the only one left and winning that majestic, imaginary tank. If only I knew the truth. Anyway, I was bored. I was tired of my father telling me about the children and had been there long enough to figure out that at this point, I must be the only kid left, so what had I to lose? So I banged away on my pots and pans, creating a little tune they'd play for me as I would march up to my prize. I had just gotten started when the door swung open, yelling bursting through the still air, causing me to dash under the sheets. \"Ich habe gehört, Trommeln, wurde es von hier kommen!\" shouted a man. There were two of them. \"Das ist unmöglich, alle Juden am Werk sind.\" \"Aber ich hörte, ich weiß,\" \"Der Platz ist leer. Lassen Sie es sein. Der Offizier würde unsere Köpfe dafür haben.\" There was a resounding bang as the door slammed shut. The air was silent excpet for the rain and my racing heartbeat. I never touched the pots again.

This is based on Life IsnBeautiful, about how Giosué feels after he finds out what his father didnfor his mother and him. It might not be very good, but I would still likento read your reviews and see what you think! This is all from Giosué's point of view. *&* After I learned the truth, I only talked about my life in the concentrationncamp once, at a dinner party on my twenty-fifth birthday. They werenfascinated with my story, and they all said, \"You were so lucky that younhated baths! That dislike for baths saved your life!\" I would just smile, and say nothing, but I knew that they were wrong. Itnwasn't my dislike for baths that saved my life; it was my father. If itnhadn't been for him, I would have never made it through. I hadn't known what had happened to Papa after the war was over. I had beenntoo caught up with the excitement, thinking that I won my own tank. ThenAmerican soldier was nice to me, allowing me to ride in the tank. I can'tnremember his name anymore, but I will never forget his friendly face,nsmiling as we rolled out of the camp. And then I saw Mama. She looked tired, but when she saw me, her face broke into this beautifulnsmile that I will never forget. I ran towards her, and we hugged for thenlongest time, both sides unwilling to let go. I had missed her so much,neven her nagging. It had been cold and dirty in the bunkers, and I hadnalways found myself wishing that Mama would be there to tidy up andndecorate it with pretty flowers. I never told Papa about that, of course,nor Papa might have cried. I knew Papa missed Mama too, but it wasn't untilnmuch later in life that I realised that being away from Mama wasn't thenbiggest problem on Papa's mind. When we finally pulled apart, the American soldier asked us to climb up tonthe tank again, and so we rode together in the tank, Mama and I. I told hernthat this tank was mine, that I had won it, that Papa and I had won thengame. She looked confused, and I was surprised that she knew nothing aboutnthe game. \"Don't you know the game, Mama? Didn't anyone explain to you?\" Inasked. \"All that was a game! We earned points and the first to get 1000npoints would win a tank! Papa and I were the first! I'm the only child thatnthey haven't found, and so we won.\" A look came over Mama's face, a look that I misinterpreted atndisappointment at not having won the tank. \"Don't worry, Mama, I'll sharenthis tank with you. And later we will find Papa and we can all share thisntank. He was distracting a soldier last night so they wouldn't find me.nWe'll find him later, and tell him that we've won.\" And Mama began to cry. I didn't understand why then, and so I just put mynarms around her and hugged her tightly. When we couldn't find Papa, I began to get afraid, but Mama smiled and toldnme, \"Maybe he's still distracting the soldier. We'll find him later.\"nWhen the American soldier let us off the tank, and drove away, I began tonget a little angry. They were stealing my tank! \"No, Giosué. They have tonborrow the tank to go help others. That's a very important tank, and itnneeds to be taken care of. They'll give it back to you later when you arenbig enough to drive it,\" Mama said, hugging me to her tightly. \"What if they don't give it back?\" I asked in a small voice. \"Don't worry, Giosué. Your papa will be there to take care of the tank.\" I was just five then, and had no idea what I had just lost. Who I had justnlost. Mama and I stayed with her parents, living quietly. Mama continued to be anteacher as she had been before, and I went to school, learning to play withnother children. They all had some story or other that they had heard fromnthe adults about war, but I laughed at them, thinking that they had allnbeen completely fooled by the people who didn't want them to win the game.nI told them about the game smugly and how I owned a tank, and that mynfather was there to take care of the tank until I could drive it. My storynfascinated them, and for a time I was happy. Whatever doubts I had, Mamanbrushed aside with the story of the game and the tank. By the age of seven I began to think that there had been no game, but Mamaninsisted that I had won the tank, and that Papa was taking care of it. She finally told me the truth when I was ten, after I had tactfullynsuggested that perhaps it was time to write to Papa and tell him that I wasnbig enough to drive the tank. Mama started to cry then, and in her sorrownshe told me the truth. She told me that the game had been a story that Papanhad made up to keep me from being afraid, and that it had actually been anconcentration camp where everyone was made to do very hard work and manynpeople died. She told me about Uncle Eliseo, that he had died at the campntoo. Finally she told me that Papa had been killed by the soldier he hadnbeen distracting on that last night. I sat, stunned and speechless. There was just nothing to say for thisnhorror. All thoughts of the tank flew out of my mind as I thought over whatnI had been through, when I was just a child of five. Suddenly I knew whynPapa laughed so hard when I told him all the stories I had heard from thenother children at the camp. He had been disguising his tears! I lay awake that night, unable to fall asleep now that I knew the truth.nSomehow it felt wrong, lying comfortably in this bed with Mama next to me,nwhile Uncle Eliseo was gone forever, and Papa as well. Mama confessed thatnshe did not even know where their bodies were. I thought back on those times. Papa had always seemed to be so excited andnhappy, but now I knew that he must have felt so worried for all of us. Henhad probably never even thought about himself, only about Mama and I. Henhad spent the whole time at the camp telling me not to be afraid, inventingna game to keep me happy, to draw my mind away from the danger that wasnhanging over our heads. I thought about how selfish I had been, onlynthinking of my own discomfort. I began to cry, unable to help myself. Papa must have been so tired,ncompletely exhausted from a whole day of work, and he had even sacrificednhis own food ration for me! He must have been so afraid for all of us, butnhe had to keep smiling, even in the face of death, just so that I wouldn'tnbe afraid. He had done everything in his power to keep me from the horrorsnof war, and in that aspect he had succeeded: I had almost no bad memoriesnof the war, having been too focused on \"the game\". He had done so much fornus, and I had never known, never thanked him. My Papa had saved my life in more ways than one, for more than one time.nAnd I had never had the chance to give him a hug, to say thank you, to tellnhim that I loved him.

You never appreciate what one person has done for you until they are gone and you can't shape into words everything you now realize. My Father showed me everything I need to know about life. He was my friend, he was my father, and he was more than that. He was everything to me, and while I can not change what happened, he made me the person I am today. He taught me about love and sacrifice, but above all he showed me how to live, when it all seemed too much. He showed me the importance of loyalty and he showed me how to make the best out of things, even when there seems to be no hope. But my Father is not the only person who made me who I am, the Nazi's did too. They taught me more about the world than any one person could have. They taught me about unreasonable cruelty, hate, discrimination. They taught me that the world is not always a good place, full of nice people. They taught me you had to fight, and my father taught me how. With out my Father I would not be the man I am today, but I would not even be here. Without his help I would not be standing in front of you today, I would be just another victim of the gas chambers, just some more ashes scattered upon the breeze. Without my Father I would not be a man at all, but just another name in another book, marking the passing of a life with cold calculating detachment. The last thing I have learnt, however, I learnt for myself. I learnt of forgiveness. I don't hate those men, who killed my Father, who imprisoned my Mother and me. I have forgiven them. I pity them I pity what they did. I pity their half lives, with the deaths of millions being held over them, but I don't hate them. And in some ways I think my forgiveness is worse than my hate. My Hate they could understand, my hate they could explain away with cold hard logic, but forgiveness, something that cant be explained, is something they will never understand. But it is what I am giving them, no more, no less. And I believe forgiveness is enough.

Pebbs[Chapter 2] Authors Note: Thanx for the reviews Guys! Disclamer: I do not own raise your voice apart from the Plot and Jason. Terri woke up bright and early in the morning. She was too excited to go back to sleep. 2.00am the alarm clock shone brightly. She looked at her ceiling and sighed. Tomorrow morning she wouldn't be waking up to this old silent room. She would be waking up to a white clean room with Denise snoring lightly in the corner and musicians playing in the background getting ready for that teacher they've got to impress. She missed her friends, Denise, Kiwi even Slone but most of all she missed Jay. She fell into a light sleep dreaming of Bristol Hillman without Jay. It was an awful nightmare. \"Jay? Jay? Where are you?\" \"I'm here\" called a faint english voice \"Where? Where?\" terri called running the corridors of the school \"I need you jay!\" she called out \" I don't want you. I've forgotten about you. I've got someone else\" Jay appeared in front of her She collapsed to the ground crying when a white light engulfed her... She woke to her mom opening her curtains and pulling off her sheets. \"Wake up. Terri- You're going to miss the train!\" She handed Terri a coffee and threw her clothes at her. Half an hour later Terri was at the train station giving her goodbyes to her parents. She gave them a last look and climbed aboard the train giving a last happy wave. She found her seat next to a guy about her age but he was asleep and she couldn't see his face. She fell asleep again after flipping through a stray magazine left on the floor. \" I love you-\" jay said to her embracing her. \" Don't ever forget that\" And he kissed her passionately. \" I love you too\" Terri said a tear slipping down her cheek. Giving one last look behind him he got into his car and drove off. The last she saw of him. She shot up panting. \" Are you OK?\" a strong Australian accent filled the air and the boy next to her looked at her worried. \"I'm fine- Sorry, nightmare\" She gazed at him. He had blonde hair, sea green eyes and wore board shorts and a tight t-shirt where she could see the outline of a six pack. \" I'm Jason\" He said holding his hand out \"Terri\" she replied shaking it. They talked for a while and got to know each other. It turned out Jason played the drums and was also going to Bristol Hillman Music Conservertory. He was 1 year older, had a girlfriend in Australia named Simone and he was born in Sydney. The train came to a Holt. Jason and Terri got off and shared a taxi to bristol hillman. It wasdark by the time they got there like when Terri arrived last year but this time instead of Jay going past the door and unlocking it, it was opened by a girl with red hair.Jason andTerriparted agreeing to meet by the fountain in the morning after classes for lunch and they then found their ways to their rooms. Terri was sharing with Denise again and because of that she walked in quietly and crawled into bed- careful not to wake her up. This time Terri did not dream of Jay or her brother. She dreamt of one person. Jason. Meanwhile Jason found his way to his room and unlocked it. It was dark and when he switched on the light a grumbling was heard under the covers at the bed by the door. Must be his room mate he thought to himself. He quickly turned off the light and flipped on his bedside lamp. He looked at the bedside table next to him and saw some envelopes addressed to Jay. Must be his roommates name he thought and shrugged and went to bed dreaming of Terri. Authors Note: Is Jay Jasons roommate? What will Jay say when he sees Terri? Review and soon I shall tell you… hahaha. Yea- review guys. Sorry this is so short. Its 2.00AM here so I might post another chapter 2morrow (but if I do it will be short). It depends. I'm working all day so I wont have much time to write. Pebbles-05 xoxo[Chapter 3] Authors Note: Sorry it has taken me so long to update! Computer troubles! Deleted my chapter so far- So heres a nice juicy chapter for you! I might put this into another chapter so it has a cliffy- kinda but you know. We'll see how it goes. Terri woke up to her alarm clock buzzing. It sounded like a fire alarm- the same volume too. She slapped down the snooze button again and slid back under the covers.[Chapter 4] Hey.

Thankyou all for reviewing. Reviews are appreciated! ---------------------------------------- Jay stood there. Shocked. She loved him? But he didn't know her. Yet she looked familiar. Jay decided to take a walk. He couldn't handle this right now. --------------------------------------------------- Meanwhile…. Slone, Kiwi and Denise were sitting on a table talking about jay. \" Its like he can't remember us\" Kiwi said. \"I'm his best friend. He stopped contacting me over the summer suddenly and then I couldn't get hold of him\" \"Maybe something happened to him\" Slone said. \"We need to find out\" Denise said firmly. \" Ok\" they said in unison ------------------------------------------------- Jay went for a walk. He sat down on a park bench. \"Why do they know me. I don't know them…. But I've seen Terri before. I know it.\" He thought. \"HEY JAY!\" he looked up. A blonde girl strode towards him confidently. \"Hey\" he said looking back down \"wait- how do you know my name\" \"I used to go out with you\". Robin looked Offended. \"I did?\" By now Jay was even more confused. He walked away leaving robin. \"Okaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy\" She said and strode off towards the mall\" ---------------------------------------------------- Jay rang his auntie when he got back to his room. \"Hey auntie Hilda\" \"Hi Jay\" \"Um.. I was wondering. Have I been to this music academy before?\" \"No dear. Why?\" \"Oh, its just everyone thinks they know me. But they don't. Do they?\" \"That's strange. Maybe they think you are someone else\" \"Yea, maybe\" He replied. \"OK well I've got to go know sweetheart\" \"OK\" \"Love you\" \" Luv ya. Bye\" ----------------------------------------- Auntie Hilda hung up. \"Drat.\" She said to her husband Phil. \"What's wrong darling?\" He questioned. \"I knew we shouldn't have sent him there.\" \"He liked playing music\" Phil shrugged. \"BUT PHIL WE PICKED THAT ONE HES BEEN TO BEFORE BY ACCIDENT!\" \"Uh oh\" Phil said. \"After the accident last summer the doctor said we should cut him off from his outside world. We shouldn't have let him play music. We should have changed his name, but we didn't. The doctor said it could cause depression, confusion and mental problems if he got into it again. He thinks his parents died when he was little. It would confuse him if those friends that knew him told him that he was with his parents last year.\" \"But honey...\" \"No buts Phil. We need to get him out of there.\" \"Ok\" Phil said. ------------------------------------------ Jay walked into his Room. Jason was sitting on the bed. \"You really upset her man.\" \"Terri?\" \"Yea\" \"I know. I don't know how she knows me.\" \"Oh.\" There was silence for a while. \"Is it ok if I ask her out\" Jason said \"Wait I thought you had a girlfriend?\" \"I did but she cheated on me so I broke up with her\" He looked sad. \"Oh. Why are you asking me if you can go out with her?\" \"Cus you were apparently like her boyfriend or something\" \"I was? Sure you can go out with her.\" He said shrugging. \"I'm gonna sleep now.\" \"K, night\" \"Night.\" Jay went to bed. But he regretted that last sentence. Sure you can go out with her. ------------------------------------------------- Jays dream: Jay looked around him He was at Bristol Hillman music conservatory. Terri was talking to Denise and Kiwi. She saw him and ran over. \" Hey baby\" Jay found himself saying \" Hey\" She said in a flirty tone. \" I love you\" He said \" And don't ever forget that\" And he kissed he passionately. Jay woke up with a start. He drifted off back to sleep. Not really thinking about it. He left Bristol Hillman music conservatory. He drove home. His parents greeted him with lots of love and they went out for a celebration dinner at KFC. As they were driving along the freeway bright lights shone to the side of him. He turned and saw a truck coming straight towards his car. BOOM. Blackness. Darkness. \"Omg\". Jay woke up. Jason was beside him looking at him worried. \"Are you OK man?\" \"Yea where's Terri?\" \"She went to the train station to sing with Denise.\" \"OK\" jay cried scrambling to put on clothes as fast as possible. He jumped into his car as fast as he could. It wouldn't start. He ran towards the train station. A car was coming across the road but Jay ran across. BANG. Darkness. Again. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOhhhhh cliffy.

I turned on my CD player and Seasons ofnlove came on. I grabbed my cream soft jeans a pair of underwear and anwhite t-shirt into the bath room as I sang along to my favorite song.nNow at most boarding schools this would have got me tossed intondetention, but I went to a preforming arts boarding school. I couldnhear other kids singing along too. As the song rent came on I wasndoing my hair, I usually just wore it down like any other guy. I feltnthe need to make it more 'gay'. I as got told I didn't look gaynenough, I took one of my bleach sticks and ran it over parts of mynhair. I washed it out in the sink and I looked like a read head whonhad set down under a bottle of bleach as sunscreen. I then proceedednto dye each strand that was bleached either pink black or blue. I walked out of my roomnswinging my messenger bag over my shoulder shutting off my radio as Inclosed the door with a toss of a shoe. My Doc. Martians made a soft clomp as I walked. I waved tonmy friends as I walked out of the door and into the quad. There werengroups of people playing instrument or singing, some dancing, othersnacting out parts from plays. It seemed almost everyone waved at me,nsome guys snickered pointed and laughed. These were my favoritentimes, you might be wondering why does everyone waved atnyou? Well I am what you call anquad-hit, I play Bass, I sing, I dance, and I act. Insing better than anything, I love it. It was the only thing there fornme when my 'parents' kicked me out, well more in I made them send mento upstate New York, I told them I would tell the press I was gay. Myndad was and is still running for office. As soon as they paid for alln4 years, just like normal high school but with fun classes. I am innmy second year, or a what we like to call fourth-former. Asnthe first bell rang I walked into the auditorium for our Mondaynannouncements. \"Please, quite down.\" Began the Headmistress, \"Nowntoday we begin our second half of our first Trimester. If you haventhe need to drop any classes today is the day to do so. Todays lunchnis soup bar, pizza bar, and salad bar. Your choice of what you wantnto drink. We also have a new student I'll let him introduce himself,nhe is the second quad-hit we have in the fourth-formers.\" Antall boy I instantly recognized as Joe Jonas from the Jonas Brothers,na band of three brothers who are all very sexy! He cleared his throatnand said, \"Hi. My name is Joe Jonas, if you don't know who I am Inused to be in a band with my two brothers but after an announcement Inmade on TRL. When I said I was homosexual-\" I clapped and screamed,nas I did for all my people. He laughed then said again, \"We brokenup and I deiced I wanted to improve as a singer, dance, musician, andnactor. So I used what money I had to enroll here.\" ThenHeadmistress clapped as he walked off toward the backstage. \"Wenwelcome you warmly here at Castle of the Preforming arts, and wouldnMackenzie Woodward meet me backstage. That's all, let what you learnnhere inspire you forever more.\" Inshot up, she should know I am anlittle on the odd side by now .nI made my way to the backstage entrance, when I walked in Joe wasnfull of bags, he had them strung on his back, his sides one or twonrolling I laughed. \"Joe,nthis is Mac. He is also a quad-hit like yourself, one of our mostnpopular students also. We think he will do great things. Mac, Joe isngoing to be your roommate will you take him to your room so he cannget set up?\" The Headmistress gave me a wink and I smiled, Ohnthank you lord. I am now going to start worshiping at his temple. \"Inwould love to. Here let me take a couple of those bags.\" I said asnI put one hand around his back as I grabbed a bags sling and took itncarefully of his neck. I took the rolling bags, and smiled bowedndeeply to the headmistress then walked out the back exit. \"Thanks,nfor the help. And the warm welcome, I like your hair by the way.\"nJoe said coming to my side. \"So, are you-\" I cut him off. \"YeahnI'm gay.\" I said smiling and laughing. \"Nicento know, but I was going to ask if you knew who the other quad-hitnwas.\" Joe said laughing as I blushed. \"YeahnI know him, he is your roommate.\" I said grinning as he understood. \"Really,nthat's amazing. So did I pick a good school?' Joe asked as I openednthe dorm door, so far so good. \"Yeahnit's great, but it just got better.\" I said smiling as we got intonthe elevator and rode to the 6thnfloor where our room was.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Moving in (Note: Please read andnreview) Thendoors slid open on the 6th floor and we walked out thendoors and turned right and when we reached room 69. I laughed atnthis, as I always do. \"Welcome to room 69.\" I said as we walkednin I set his stuff on the second twin bed. Thenonly thing between the beds was a small coffee table. \"Wow, yournside rocks, and it's clean. Hope I don't mess my side up to bad, if Indo sorry.\" Joe said letting his eyes linger on all of the postersnof bands,dancers, musicals. He laughed when his eyes caught the JonasnBrothers poster hung on the wall above the radio. \"So your a fan?\"nJoe asked already unloading his clothes. He stopped and looked at me,nin his hands were a pair of very cute black silk boxers with littlenred lips on them. He blushed and shoved them in the top drawer. \"I guess, I used tonrun the Port Angeleas chapter of your fan club.\" I said pointing tona row of buttons I had hung on my mirror one read, 'Who needs onenboyfriend, when you can have 3 brothers!'. Joenlaughed, we spent the first few hours before lunch putting his booksnon the shelves, hanging family pictures. Talking about his life, mynlife. His love life, single he is single! It was very hard to hold mynexcitement when he told me this, he smirked when I told him I wasnsingle too. Therenwas a loud bell and both of our faces lit up and our stomachs growlednhungry for substance . \"Want to go to New York? We can take thentrain, I need some new stuff. Like books, music, and such. How aboutnit?\" Joensmiled then said, \"Sure anything to hang out with you.\" This madenmy heart flip. I walked over to the coffee table grabbed on side andnpulled it slid easily away. \"What are you doing Mac?\" \"Nothingnjust testing something.\" I said then my face lit up and I pinchednJoe's butt. \"Bet ya can't catch me!\" Inthen ran out of the room, Joe was not far behind me. I could hear himnpounding his way up to me. I stopped and made a hard left down ansmall hallway. Now this is not the first time I have done this, so Injumped through the open window and landed on the fire escape. I wasnhalf way down when I heard Joe jumping down the stairs. \"Comenon, I have two brothers. I think I can catch you shorty!\" Joe saidnas I jumped off the last flight and softly onto the ground. \"Yes,nbut were they ex-gymnastics chaps?\" I asked as I started doingnbackhand springs across the lawn.

I had a lesson, the teacher is letting me teach some of thenyounger kids, kewl huh?\" Sam said a smile on her face as she gavenboth me and Joe a hug. \"It'snal right, we are on our way to the NYC, want to get Seth and go?\" Inasked laughing. \"No,nI am on my way to go and see him, tonight is slam night, if you knownwhat I mean.\" Sam said as she walked toward Joe and I's dorm.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 New York (Note: Read & Review) Joenand I made our way off campus and toward the subway, I call it trainnbecause it sounds more glamorous. \"Gosh, it is getting pretty coldnout. I should have brought my jacket.\" I said mentally kickingnmyself. Joenlaughed and slipped off his hoddie, he then put his hand on mynshoulder. I stopped and he put it on me, I put my arms through thenholes and took a deep breath. He had the best scent in the world, itnwas like some kind of citrus mixed with apples and some musk. \"ThanksnJoe,\" I said as I gave him a soft hug. I hadn't notice until nownhow much taller Joe was than me. He had to be at the least 6 feetntall, and I was a mere 5'5\". Henblushed and put his arms around me and hugged me back. \"It's okay.\"nHe said was we pulled apart. \"Wellnwe're here.\" I said as we walked down into the subway station. Intook out my pass swiped it twice it let Joe and I through. Wenwalked onto the subway, it was almost completely empty, there was anhobo asleep on one of the benches. Joe sat down and I sat next tonhim, \"So why do you like to sing?\" \"Itnwas my only outlet, I have known I was 'different', as my mom sonquaintly put it. So I wanted to be famous, I wanted different to benkewl. I wanted every person who had ever been made fun of to have anvoice in my music, even when I danced for them. My father wanted mento be like other boys, play sports, look at naked girls on thencomputer. Not write poetry, he hated the fact that I always wasnhanging out with my mother. He made her get a job, to get her awaynfrom me. \"Andnwhen he was half way into his re-election in Maryland, I got in anfight at school because someone called me a 'fag', that night whilenmy mother and father told me how I had made my father lose pollnnumbers, I told them I was gay. Not 10 hours later I was on a planento the Castle. \"Mynfather is why I want to sing, I want to get so good, be the best. SonI can show him that I am the son he should have wanted.\" I saidnwith a frown on my face, I felt Joe put his arm around me. \"Thatnreally must suck, I'm sorry you had to go through that.\" Joe saidnas I leaned my head on his shoulder. I felt like it could tell himnanything. \"Younhad it much worse Joe,\" I said getting closer to him. \"No,nyou didn't want to leave. I had to, my father hates me, my brothersnwon't look at me. I couldn't be around them anymore, so I took mynpart of the earnings gave half to Frankie, my little brother, usednthe rest to pay for my school. I have hardly anything left.\" Joensaid I put my arms around his waste. I satnup my arms still around Joe, \"Then let me pay you back for being myninspiration.\" I said waving my bank card as the subway stopped andnthe doors opened. I took his hand and dragged him through the crowdnsome of the girls whispered and looked at Joe. \"No,nyou can't.\" Joe said as we stopped and looked at times square. Inlaughed and said, \"I'm not, my father is. What do you think keepsnmy from tell the world I'm gay. I even had to change my Last name, itnwas West. I'm Mackenzie West of the Baltimore Wests.\" Joenlaughed and nodded, it was not a little past 3 the lunch rush wasnover now it was just dog walkers, hobos, and street performers. Fastnforward to after they ate, now in Central Park \"Thanksnfor bring me along, I really needed this.\" Joe said bumping me withnhis shoulder. \"What,na cute pair boxers from, Tommy's? Trust me, it was fun watching yountry on all the other pairs.\" I said with laugh, we stopped in frontnon a man playing a drum set. I took out a sheet of music gave himn$20s and he Began to 'Today for you' from Rent. I began to sing, Joenand the man laughed. Ineven showed off for the growing group of spectators. At the end of mynPerformance the man had over $500s in his bucket, he tried to givensome of it to me. I said that I was good, and that he was great. As wenwalked back onto the Subway heading back to our dorm. Joe said, \"Yournamazing, and what I was thanking you for was taking me out, you madenme have fun.\" Joe then bent down and kissed me right on the lips. \"No,nproblem. If that's my payment we might as well just live in NewnYork.\" I said blushing as he took my hand. Indon't remember walking home that night, I woke up with Joe's armsnaround me and a smile on my face.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 No school, too kewl! (Note: Please read andnReview) WhennI opened my eyes all I could see was skin, and it was not mine. Itnwas Joe's 6pack of abs I could just barely see. In my mind I wasndancing and singing. Just when I thought the world was finely doingnright by me, the door swung open and I could hear Sam's loud hummingnas she opened the blinds. Joengroaned and said, \"What in God's name is going on?\" \"OhnMy God! Sorry to interrupt, Kenzie. Can I talk to you in thenBathroom?\" Sam asked giving me her, tell me now ,nlook. Inflipped the covers off of me and there I was in my lucky charmsnboxers. Now I remember going to New York dressed which meant that,nJOE HAD TAKEN MY CLOTHES OFF! Infollowed Sam into the bathroom as soon as the door was closed Samnasked, \"What fucking happened? Tell me everything now!\" Infilled Sam in on the the details until there was a knock and Joensaid, \"I kind of have to go the the bathroom.\" Menand Sam walked out of the bathroom laughing very hard. \"Wendon't have school this week, I guess it has something to do with thenschools history apparently part of the school burnt down on this weeknlike 100years ago or something.\" Sam said as she walked out thendoor. \"Nonschool? Sweet!\" Joe said coming out of the bath room scratching hisn'area'. On seeing this I cracked up and went to take a shower. FastnForward till after both have taken showers Joenwanted to go for a walk and I said I would be more than happy to shownhim around. As if claiming me as his he took my hand the instant wenwalked out of our room. We took the elevator down to the lobby wherenSam and her tall black hair drummer, Seth, were making-out. Sethnwaved and did his, I'm going to get some tonight, dance. Joenlooked at me questionably as I laughed. We walked out the doors, andnon the ground was a small layer of snow covered the ground. \"Kenzie!nHey, Kenzie!\" A familiar voice yelled. Thennout of nowhere a small ball of snow landed at my feet. \"Pedro! Whatnthe hell, how are you?\" I asked my Salvadorian friend, who's realnname is William. \"My.Name.Is.William.nJust got back from meeting with my Dad, he gave me some plane ticks,nfor an early Christmas present! I think I might go see my mom, wenhaven't talk since I told her I was gay.\" William said his hands onnhis hips. \"Ohnmy God, I totally forgot! There is only like a week until Christmas!nI am so screwed!\" I said stomping my foot. Joenraised his eyebrow and asked, \"Did you seriously just stomp yournfoot? I thought only girls on soap operas did that.\" \"Macnmust have forgotten his Manners, I am William. Nice to meet you Joe.\"nWill said out stretching his hand. Joenshook it and asked if he could borrow my cell phone. Insaid that he could, he called a number I am guessing was his voicenmail and listened for a minute than a tear went down his cheeknWilliam said good bye and left I dragged Joe over to a picnic tablenand asked, \"What's wrong? Are you Okay?\" rubbednhis eyes and said through his sobs, \" I had asked my mother if Incould go home for Christmas, and she left a message saying, 'If younhave decided you're not a homosexual, then yes. If you still thinknyou are than your father and I want to have you emancipated.' Theyndon't want me as their son, because I am gay. \"nI didn't have a choice, I didn't chose to be this way! I wish, I wishnI was never born!\" Joe said as he stood and ran away. Insat there not knowing what to do, who to call. Where to go. I finelynmade up my mind, I walked back toward the dorm. I went to one of thencomputers and logged into my cell phones tracking link, it said itnwas somewhere down an alley, it had been for 30 minutes. It had beennthat long already. Intook an extra coat, some hot chocolate in a hot cup, I ran as fast asnI could following the roads the tracker told me too. It took me 10nminutes to reach the mouth of the alley. I could see Joe hunched overncrying. \"Joe?\"nI said asking an obvious question. \"Leavenme alone!\" Joe yelled standing up and starting to run. Indropped everything I was hold, and I ran pushing my short legs hardernthan I had ever in my gymnastics carrier. I got to Joe and grabbednhis wrist he punched me in the chin. \"Youncan't stop me!\" I yelled as I grabbed his arm with both of mynhands. I took my left leg and kicked him in his right knee. Joe wentndown hard with a load grunt. \" I am so much stronger than you givenme credit for.\" Ingrabbed Joe's chin and brought his lips to mine. I kissed him like mynlips would save his life and the world. Soon he wrapped his armsnaround my waist and brought me down into his lap, I don't know hownlong we sat there kissing on the ground in some dark alley way. Inhave some faint memory of him leaning on me as he limped back to ournroom. I do completely remember kissing him, on top of his lap as wenpulsated back and fourth. We made love it was the most amazing andnpainful thing I had ever felt. I feel asleep in his arms once more.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 (Note: Please Read &nReview) \"Joenare you ready for this?\" I asked as we stood in front of the courtnhouse in New York. Joensighed took my hand and said, \"As long as your by my side, I can donanything.\" Wenthen walked into the court house, from the look on Joe's face and hisnattorney's this was going to be a very long and painful day. Now whatnI saw next almost made me puke , I saw my mother and father walk pastnme. My mom was crying my father angry, I didn't know weather tonscream or cry so I put my feelings into helping Joe get through thisnhorrid day. Asnwe walked into the court room all eyes were on us. I could seensitting at the prosecutor table Mr. And Mrs. Jonas, Kevin and Nicknsat in the first row with Frankie. When Mr. Jonas looked at his sonnand I and we sat down at the table and went over what he and I hadnto say. \"Thanksnfor getting me a lawyer.\" Joe said kissing me on the cheek, Inalmost didn't let him seeing as being gay got him here. The Lawyernsmiled and mouthed what looked like, 'Good, good' \"Intold you I would help you didn't I?\" I said pushing his hair behindnhis ears. I then took out a small mirror and looked at my hair, Infelt the need to go all out for today. I had dyed almost every partnof my hair in different colors of the rainbow. Joenlaughed and said, \"You don't have to be here, they might strikenlow. As in expose who you are if they can keep me from getting anynmoney.\" \"Well,nI've been through this already. I know how to make the judge go innyour favor, I mean if I can get $1000 dollars a week I think I cannget you at least $100 a week for you.\" I said winking and smilingnat the Lawyer whom had helped me get my money. \"nWe don't want to seem to agar for money, our goal today is a cleannhappy separation, or one that helps you survive at the least.\"ThenLawyer said sifting through his papers. \"Allnraise, for the honorable Judge Carter.\" Said the Bailiff. Antall man walked into the room and sat down. \" Please be seated willnthe Defendant please making an opening statement.\" Joenstood letting go of my hand, \" Two months ago while on tour with myntwo brothers I came to terms with my inner feelings of beingnhomosexual. Soon after I made this realization, I told my grandmothernand even though she was a long time believer in the Catholic faith,nshe accepted me for who I was. She gave me the advice of telling mynfans, she thought letting them know this would strength our bond asnnot only a band but as a nation. \"nDuring one of our interviews on TRL, I came out to whom ever mightnhave been watching. The fans went wild and the still loved me and thenband. My family was another story, they hated me for 'ruining' whatnthey had worked for. Even though our record sales had never been sonhigh, my brothers wouldn't look at me or speak to me. I made thendecision come using what money I had saved to enroll myself at Castlenschool of the Preforming Arts, here I might my boyfriend, MackenzienWoodward, who has gone through this already. I don't expect anyone innmy family to love any more even though my grandmother still calls me,nbut I am not going to fight being kicked out of my family. I do wantnto be able to see my little brother, when he heard I was gay, hendidn't understand. \"WhennI explained what 'gay' meant, he said to me, 'Why do mom and dad,nKevin, and Nick. Care who you love as long as your happy?' uponnhearing this I made the choice to leave, I left my brother a smallnlump of money in a bank account which only he has the ability to getnit to, I want to keep it that way.\" Joe said as he sat down takingnmy hand. Inlet a smile creep onto my face. I rubbed Joe's knee and he smiledntoo, but his was one of pain. I thought back to my trial how it hadnended so fast, I said I wanted money they gave it to me on thencondition I change my last name-, their going to ask Joe to do that? Inlooked at Joe's father as he stood, Joe's mom looked at Joe and I.nShe stood, her husbands face went to her eyes and they nodded. \"Wenwould like this case closed.\" Was all the Joe's father said. Henwalked over to Joe as the people were leaving and hugged his son, Joencried and so did his father. \"Hi,nI'm Alice. It's nice to meet you. Thanks for helping my son.\" Joe'snmother said as she shook my hand.[Chapter 6] Sing?! ((Please fornyour sake before you read this download Pat Benatar's song \"Love isna Battlefield\" when it is time to start the song I will put a n then listen to the song as if Mac was singing it with the Jo Bros!)) AsnI stood back stage just three weeks after the very short court battlenwith his family, the Jonas Brothers were having a Reunion concert! Incould hear the fans cheering and screaming as I heard them finishnthey're song S.O.S. \"Hey, thanks for coming everyone! Now we have a reallynspecial surprise for you tonight.

The fans erupted with screams and cheers and 'OMIGOSH!'nI shook my head but Joe came and took my hand and pulled me onto thencenter stage. He handed me a microphone. \"Hello,\" I said in to the head set as I put it on.nThe fans screamed and cheered once more. \"Well I have been workingnon an old fave song of mine, Love is a Battlefield by Pat Benatar.\"nThe fans yelled in approval. \"Ready?\" ThenJonas Brothers began playing and I started to sing and dance my waynaround the stage. As I finished the song the fans were all smilingnlaughing and smiling. A little breathlessly I said, \"Thanks for thenwarm welcome you are the best fans.

The meet and greet went fast and I didn't remember muchnafter crawling into a small bed with joe and kissing every inch ofnhis sweet smelling body. That night I did something I never dreamednof, had sex on a tour bus with Joe Jonas, bumpy bumpy if ya know whatnI mean! Next morning We pulled in to a large hotel parking lot that wasnalready being surrounded by fans. I quickly pulled on a pair of sweatnpants and Joe's lettermen jacket. We walked off the bus photographersntook my picture and I waved and someone yelled \" Gay is not the wayn\" and I kissed Joe and yelled back \" make love not war!\" ","Summary":" Chapter 1 Joe Jonas (Note: please read andnreview) That day began like anynother, my room was all m"},{"Movie":"Raise Your Voice","Title":"The Girl from the DVD","Author":"BrokePerception","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/5316582","Passage":"[Chapter 1] FULL SUMMARY: It has been exactly a year after Paul's death, and Terri admits to herself that the missing still remains. That's in fact just why she's determined to go back to Bristol-Hillman, and fulfill her brother's last wish. He wouldn't have wanted her to waste her talent, but act on it and become great. In all her stress around her studies, she, however, forgets the final application date for the summer music program and finds out she's late...[Chapter 2] Chapter 1 Terri glanced up at the alarm clock on her nightstand. She rolled back over on her back and looked up at the ceiling. She hadn't been able to sleep for days, and she knew why. Today was the day when he had died just last year. Terri's unconsciousness felt it, too… resulting in the past sleepless nights. She briefly shook her head and swung her legs over the edge of her bed, kicking aside her covers at the same time. She allowed her feet to find the floor and got up, rubbing her eyes out with one hand as she pushed aside the curtains with the other. Flagstaff was still dark and quiet outside. It was still early, too, but at least this would be an acceptable time to wake up. It was around six in the morning. Terri usually didn't get up before seven-thirty. She hadn't been sleeping at all, and she realized that she must have waited until it was late enough to get up. Today was her last day at school before the summer holidays, and even though she should be happy about it, it also reminded her of something not so nice. Terri let go of the curtain, letting it fall back into place, and padded towards the door. She closed it behind her silently so as not to wake up her parents in the room straight across hers and walked towards the stairs. Instead of making her way downstairs, though, her glance caught something that lead her to the room next to hers, the first door on your left when you came up the stairs. She swallowed and pushed down the door handle. Paul's room looked as if he still lived there, except for the empty closets and unmade bed. Paul's clothes and everything had been given to charity. His personal things, like his guitar and CDs and more of that, were in a box on the bottom of his wardrobe. His posters were still hanging in the same place and his radio was still in the same spot as it had always been. Terri walked over to it and found the first CD of Three Days Grace in it. In the past year, they had gotten out another album. One Paul would never buy. Terri bit her bottom lip and clasped the lid closed again, she sat on the mattress of what used to be Paul's bed and took a deep breath trying not to cry. Her right hand reached up to clasp over Paul's necklace. Oh, she missed him. And now she had failed to fulfill his last wish. He had been the one to get her into Bristol-Hillman with his DVD. It had been the scariest, hardest, best thing that had ever happened to her, and now, through all the stress of finishing her exams, she had simply forgotten about sending the application. By the time she had time to remind herself of doing it, the final application date had already striven by. \"I'm sorry, Paul...\" Terri whispered, and started crying. Rays of sunshine peeked through the curtains, filling the room with light and warming the girl's face. She used the finger tips of her shaking right hand to brush away the tears and got up, walking to the wardrobe and opening one of its doors to reveal the box in which she knew Paul's personal things were kept. It hurt to see how such an energetic and amazing human being like her brother could be reduced to a box of little things. She knelt down in front of the box, and opened it to look inside. A sad smile washed over her face as she reached out and pulled out the crazy furry ball he used to have in his car, on the rear view mirror. She couldn't help but smile a little upon seeing it again. He'd once won it at the funfair with pellet shooting. She dropped the furry ball again, picking up the heavy box and carrying it to the bed, sitting down next to it and running her finger tips over its contents. Her fingers slid over something metal and she caught it curiously. His keys. She easily recognized their house key, of which she had one exemplar herself, and his car key. She swallowed again. The car had been total loss after the accident. The left side had been damaged beyond repair, she'd heard her dad inform her mom a couple of days after the accident. The left side, where Paul had sat. She clutched the keys tightly in her hand until it hurt, then dropped them back into the box. Terri changed her mind. Even though it had been a year, she couldn't do this yet. It was too soon. She wasn't strong enough yet. She closed the box again and stood up with it, placing it back on the bottom of the wardrobe, closing its open door. She sighed and noticed how the bedroom was more enlightened than before. Terri's eyes traveled one last time over the room, over the picture on his nightstand: the same one of her with her brother that she… Terri heard some noise further along the hallway, indicating that her parents were getting up, too. She silently closed the door to Paul's room behind her and walked downstairs, hoping that her mom had brought a new pack of cornflakes from the store yesterday.[Chapter 3] Chapter 2 The sad anniversary of the accident and Paul's death had gone by quietly. Nina had visited, and Terri had gone with her and her parents to place a new bouquet of flowers on Paul's grave. June had gradually rolled into July, and Terri was helping in the restaurant again. She couldn't help her thoughts from trailing off to Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory as she continued cleaning the empty tables. She wondered if Jay would be going again. The two of them had kept on mailing each other for a while, but suddenly without reason the back and forth mailing had stopped. Neither of them had really tried to get back in contact. She sighed, going harder on the table top. She wondered if her friends Kiwi and Sloane would be there again as well. Most likely. As Terri felt pleased about the tables, she started undoing her apron and hung it at the peg behind the cash registers, taking her black jacket and pulling it on slowly. \"I'm going home, are you closing off?\" Terri yelled. \"Yeah! Good night!\" Nicole's answer came from the restaurant's kitchen. \"Good night!\" Terri replied, walking out of the door and closing it behind her. It was abnormally quiet when she arrived home about ten minutes later and she didn't take the time to undo her jacket but went to find her parents in the living room, the television playing almost inaudibly. \"Theresa?\" Her dad's voice sounded, when he heard his daughter's footsteps in the adjoining kitchen. \"Could you come in here for a moment?\" He asked, as she usually went straight upstairs until dinner. Terri swallowed. Her father's voice sounded serious yet calm and friendly at the same time. She made her way through the kitchen and joined her parents in the living room. She didn't sit down, but just stared at the envelope in her dad's hand. \"You received a letter from Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory today,\" Frances stated calmly looking at her daughter's confused expression. \"You're accepted.\" \"That's impossible,\" Terri said. \"I told you I was too late to apply.\" \"Maybe, but a little note came with the letter, signed by a Mr. Torvald,\" Simon said, handing her the letter. Terri accepted it curiously and sank down in one of the comfortable chairs. She could feel both her parents' eyes on her as she simply ignored the letter saying that she had been accepted and pulled out a piece of grey paper, written on by a somewhat familiar hand. Terri's eyes slid over the words fast, trying to grasp as much of the content as possible. Dear Theresa, We were all very surprised not to have received a letter of application from you this year. We actually had the impression that you enjoyed last summer here and would have liked to come back. Your other teachers and myself agreed to invite you for a second year at the Music Conservatory. Your performance at the end of the summer music program last year happened to be enough to convince us of your talent, and we would all like to see you again in August. Best wishes, Mr. Torvald By the time Terri finished reading, her eyes had started shining with happiness. She couldn't believe it. Maybe she would actually end up going back to L.A. after all! \"Oh, dad... Please?\" She begged, looking up at her father hopefully. He sighed and slowly nodded his approval, and Terri jumped up from her seat and ran to hug him and her mom. \"Thank you!\" She squeaked.[Chapter 4] Chapter 3 L.A. A gentle breeze swept through the seventeen-year-old's hair as she smiled up at the building. She'd managed to keep her jacket close this time, and her train had been just on time. Terri quietly picked up her bags and walked towards the door, pushing it open and dragging herself inside with all her luggage. Everything was very quiet in the hallways as she slowly made her way to her room. Terri felt curious as to whom she'd be sharing with this year. Maybe Sloane? She smiled wider thinking about her friends. She couldn't wait to see them again. Terri looked up at the room number and knocked politely. When no answer came, she quietly stepped inside to find it empty still. She'd barely put her heavy bags down on the bed most left, when she heard bumbling outside in the hallway and decided to go see what was causing it – or who, perhaps. Terri walked over to the door and opened it to see a huge travelling bag, being followed inside by a petite girl that she assumed to be around fifteen years old. \"Thank you!\" came a high pitched voice from behind the travelling bag. Terri quietly closed the door behind the dark haired girl, her eyebrows crinkling lightly. The other girl seemed happy to be able to put her bag down. \"Hello,\" she said, holding out her hand and walking towards Terri, tripping over her own travelling bag. \"I'm fine!\" The fifteen-year-old squeaked when Terri reached out to help. Within seconds, the girl had scrambled upright again and held out her hand once more. \"I'm Leah,\" she whispered. Terri hesitated an instant before shaking the girl's hand and introduced herself as well. \"Hi. I'm Terri.\" \"I suppose we're sharing this room, then?\" Leah asked. \"I guess, yeah.\" \"I'm sorry. I'm a very clumsy kind of person. My sisters always tend to laugh at me because of it. They share a room just a little further along the hallway, Carrie and Molly. They're twins. They have been here last year, too. I'm youngest. Have you been here last year?\" Terri nodded. \"Yeah, I have. Maybe I have met your sisters, then?\" \"Maybe,\" Leah smiled. \"What do you play?\" she asked, sinking down on her knees and opening her travelling bag, opening one door of the closet and starting to throw her things in the left compartment. \"Oh, do you want the left side, maybe?\" she asked, looking at Terri again. \"No, the right is just fine for me,\" Terri answered, following her roommate's example and sitting down, trying to unzip her own bag. \"So, what do you play?\" \"I don't… really play,\" Terri replied. \"I can play the piano, but I mostly sing.\" \"Really?\" The younger girl exclaimed, smiling. \"I can't sing. I play the piccolo. Carrie plays the piano, and Molly plays the cello.\" \"That's nice,\" Terri replied. If she'd ever thought Sloane to be a little weird...[Chapter 5] Chapter 4 It was early morning when Terri quietly shut the door behind her, and roommate Leah was still sleeping peacefully. When she neared the end of the hallway, she almost literally bumped into Kiwi and Sloane, who both came from the right hallway. When Terri looked up to see whom she'd run into, she smiled, giving each of them a hug. \"Hey! How have you been?\" \"We have been great,\" Kiwi said, pulling his girlfriend close and smiling down on her. Sloane smiled, too. \"How have you been?\" he asked. \"Just fine,\" Terri replied, still smiling as the trio continued their way down to the refectory to have breakfast together. \"Have you seen anyone familiar around here yet?\" She asked as the three of them turned a corner. \"Robin, of course,\" Kiwi sighed, rolling his eyes sympathetically. \"The Hallow sisters,\" Sloane said. \"The one with the short hair plays the piano, too. Her twin sister plays the cello. They said that their younger sister Leah is here, too.\" \"I believe I actually share a room with her,\" Terri replied. \"I don't think I have ever met the twins, though,\" she said, as they continued to walk the hallways. \"Oh, but you must have met them!\" Kiwi exclaimed, detaching himself from Sloane and walking backwards in front of the girls, so that they could see him properly. \"Carrie, the one that plays the piano, has got short carrot red hair,\" Kiwi explained, \"It stands in every direction,\" he added, bringing his hands to his head and trying to give Terri a picture of it. \"Oh, yeah!\" Terri said. \"I remember her! And the one with the long blue and brown hair who was always with her, was that her sister? I never had classes with either of them, but I do remember that they were always together.\" Sloane nodded. \"The one with the blue and brown hair is Molly. They haven't changed a bit.\" \"Hey, does their sister look so weird, too?\" Kiwi wondered. Terri smiled, shaking her head as they walked towards the end of the hallway – Kiwi had started walking next to them again in the mean time – \"No,\" she said. \"She looks just like a regular girl, with dark brown braided pig tails that reach her shoulder. She's incredibly clumsy, though. When she got up early this morning to run quickly to the bathroom, she'd forgotten that she wasn't at home and stepped out of her bed on the wrong side, knocking over her bedside table.\" Kiwi and Sloane laughed. \"Any of you seen Jay, yet?\" Terri asked, trying to keep her voice casual. \"Any of you knows if he's coming back?\" Both of her friends looked at her awkwardly. \"We would have expected you to know that,\" Sloane replied, lifting her eyebrows questioningly as they stepped through the open door into the refectory, that was still quiet that early. \"I don't,\" Terri whispered, biting her lower lip as the three of them walked towards a table in front.[Chapter 6] Chapter 5 Terri sighed deep right from the moment she had shut the door to Mr. Wesson's office. It hadn't gone really well... Theresa Fletcher's thoughts had mostly been with Jay, more than with her own singing. Mr. Wesson, perhaps being the most impatient and professional teacher she'd had since Elementary, well... He hadn't been really understanding for what might have going on inside the teenager's head. He mainly focused on the singing, and not really the person behind it. He rarely smiled, too. It hadn't gone well. Lifting her dark brown shoulder bag higher, the young blonde started walking into the direction of her room, following the seemingly endless hallway. Terri wouldn't be having classes until four, and since it was only ten o'clock in the morning, she decided to turn left instead of right and walked out into the gentle morning breeze. Maybe she could have a bite somewhere and shoe shop. She was really in need of new flats, she realized as she looked down on the dark blue pair she was currently wearing. She'd seen nice All Star Light Ankle Boots yesterday, on her way from the train station to Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory. Maybe she'd go find the store and buy them; if her size was still available, at least. Terri had barely started walking out of the huge building, when the sound of a male voice with familiar accent stopped her. The seventeen-year-old couldn't quite place the familiarity she seemed to recognize at first, but when she turned around to look at the owner of the voice with British accent, everything fell into place. Jay Corgan came running towards her, halting only right in front of her, panting and lightly bent over with his hands on his knees. \"Didn't you hear me?\" he asked. \"No, Jay. I haven't in months.\" Jay's breathing slowly returned to normal, and he looked up at the blonde with his eyes wide. \"You never mailed back, either, Terri,\" he said. \"I even sent you an e-card for Christmas and New Years, but never got something back. I thought that maybe you'd found yourself another and better guy, and since you never replied, well... I didn't, either.\" \"I never got an e-card for Christmas or New Years!\" Terri exclaimed, brow crinkling. \"I did send them, Terri,\" Jay replied in a more serious and softer tone. \"Listen, I'm sorry.\" \"Me, too,\" Terri whispered back, now leaning in to give him a hug.[Chapter 7] Chapter 6 \"So,\" Terri began, when she and Jay were sitting right in front of each other in a cozy bistro in town. \"We still have three weeks until the final performances on the end of the program, and I'm wondering... are we still going for it together? I mean...\" \"I haven't gained any more talent in writing songs,\" Jay replied. \"Anything I try write that should go with my compositions, still sucks. And you're about the best song writer I ever met, so your help really would be appreciated... unless you allow me to make a fool of myself there alone.\" The two of them shared a brief look and smiled. Jay quietly set his beer back on the table, eyes glistening as he looked at the pretty young woman opposite him. He simply couldn't keep his chocolate brown eyes off of her. Terri smiled wider. \"Well... I couldn't have that done to the audience, could I?\" \"Then, Theresa Fletcher, I believe we have got a deal?\" \"I actually believe we do, Mr. Corgan,\" Terri replied, chuckling as she slowly picked up her glass of orange juice and emptied it before placing it back down. \"I saw nice All Stars in town yesterday. I was just on my way to go try and perhaps buy them before you stopped me, so fancy to go with me?\" Jay's eyes rolled back into his head. \"What do girls seriously have with shoes?\" Thus, Jay and Terri tried to practice a lot between their classes – if possible, together – during the rest of the month. By the end of August and the Bristol-Hillman summer program, the two music students had managed to write a couple of songs together. Neither of them had a real preference of which one to sing at the final performances, but honestly, both of them had just so much fun writing music and lyrics together and composing that the 10,000 dollar scholarship didn't particularly matter anymore. It would be nice, of course. Sure, it would, but it wasn't really their main goal anymore now. The experience, and the friendships solidified at Bristol-Hillman Music Conservatory actually had been prize enough in itself.[Chapter 8] It's you . I believe That it doesn't really matter how Far we are apart For you To still be into my Heart and thoughts . I have no idea where you are or What you're doing I however don't think it Changes all that much . I have made mistakes Like every other human being I have always thought Never to be happy again . I have listened to your opinions, though And now I'm standing here Without you, my friend I never would have smiled again . Even though you aren't here It's you who pulled me through Ooh Oooh... . It's you who pulled me through Made me smile again It's you who pulled me through Made me feel happy again . It's you who pulled me through You you, you . Ooh Oooh This is one of my own songs.

A newspaper flew amongst the leaves; it's bold headline reading \" Famous Air bud has five puppies!\" . As the hour's leading into the dark night grew near, these empty streets were the origin point of the aggressor's. Soon, the usually dark sky for once differed with the colour of the surface, which was now filled with a red, warm, sickening liquid. The criminal's alerted pretty much the whole street and all the neighbour's rushed to see what was happening, only to flee to the safety of their home's, upon seeing what they forced themselves to witness. Boot's splashed in puddles, as the wearer's ran down the street. Police men and veterinarian's rushed past the car park, heading to an alleyway. The officer's frantic yells haunted the night, as more and more people came out to see. Heavy rain and thunder, that night, added more fear and panic throughout the town. Normally the attackers hate rain but they didn't let it stand in the way of their battle. \"Bring out the cages!\" ordered the chief of police. \"It scratched my eye!\" screamed another. \"To your station's!\" commanded the mayor \"This is what we pay you for! Get our specialists to block the other side of the alley!\" \"We do not get paid for this mayhem,\" whispered one officer. \"Block the other side, now!\" repeated the chief. \"John, Frederick, fire warning shots! Disperse them!\" \"Send this truck out to Venice shelter,\" commanded the mayor. \"I'll head out now,\" said the truck driver, shielding himself from the rain by placing his clipboard above his head. \"Take the route via the forest,\" suggested the mayor. \"There's to much traffic because we've blocked the roads near the alleyway, people are getting home from work. They're taking alternate routes, such as the normal way to the shelter.\" As all this went on, on a high hill overlooking the town below it, was a dark figure watching, his cape flowing in front of it's mask, hiding it. More police sirens. This time heading to the woods, stopping next to the crashed truck. \"Who was behind this attack?\" asked one police man. \"No evidence of an attack,\" replied the doctor, examining the man. \"The driver has scratches on his face and he appears to have jumped out of the truck before it crashed- nothing serious luckily.\" \"So where did the scratches come from? Who caused him to lose control?!\" demanded the officer. There was no evidence of an attack. No evidence of an attack by a human, anyway, and again the figure standing on the cliff side watched. Present (Santa Buddies) The Air buddies and their new friend Puppy Paws carefully navigated the magical sled until it landed onto the cold, white surface. Moments later, Santa himself and Santa Paws arrived to congratulate them on saving Christmas. Since all magic at the North Pole had stopped, it was up to the Buddies and Puppy Paws to do the job of flying around the world in one night to deliver presents to all children and animals. Santa rewarded them with matching Santa hats (aside from Rosebud's one which was pink) and the puppies went home to enjoy the rest of their Christmas with their kids, who were missing them deeply. As Buddha went home he couldn't help but to think of all the strays who didn't have homes. They had given presents to pets around the world but some animals weren't so lucky, they didn't have any homes or owners. Buddha spotted a small kitten who looked lost and cold as he went home. \"Namaste, little friend and merry Christmas\" he greeted her, politely. \"T-thank y-y-you\" she shivered. \"Are you lost?\" asked the Zen pup. \"I'm a stray I don't have a home to be lost from\" she sadly explained. \"Would you like something warm to eat?\" he offered. \"Of course! I mean, if that's ok?\" she excitedly cried. Buddha took her to his garden, where it was snowing and told her to wait in the family's warm shed. Moments later, he bought some food from their dinner over to her. \"Thanks!\" she exclaimed, before munching it all down. Buddha felt glad that he had helped her but also felt sad about all the other stray's out there. \"Phoenix!\" a voice called, echoing throughout the trunks several fallen trees. \"Phoenix! Where is she? Phoenix, stop fooling around!\" Four orange, spotted, small legs galloped it's way through the snowy forest, without a care in the world. The legs halted and took a minute to relax. Phoenix was a young, cocky, mischievous Bengal tiger cat with a pair of green eyes that matched the surroundings of which they would always admire. Her orange, vividly marked coat made her stand out from the others. She breathed heavily and exhaled, tired after all that running, yet showed no signs of ending her mini adventure. Looking around, she admired the beautiful snow around her. \"Phoenix!\" another cat interrupted her thoughts, making her suddenly gasp and open her eyes. She turned to face a black kitten with blue eyes. It was her close friend, Luna. \"Remember what the elders said about venturing too far, you don't want to end up lost\". \"I know\" Phoenix responded gently, running up a tree that had been bent sideways. \"But it was early and I thought no one would notice if I just took a quick glance at what's out there- beyond the woods\". \"You're lucky no one did\" replied Luna, approaching the tilted log. \"And what's out there should remain out there, we don't want to invite trouble into our camp\". \"There'll be plenty of time for exploring later, right now we should get back\" promised Luna. \"Like when?\" questioned Phoenix, frustratingly. She was always the mischievous one. \"Phoenix, we won't be here for ever, Abzak knows what he's doing.\" \"I know, I trust him. We all do. Hey what's that?\" Phoenix rushed over to a tattered page of a newspaper that was caught in between several fallen branches. She kicked aside the branches and began straightening out the paper with her paws, being careful not to rip it further. \"Sports playing dog Air Bud set to play soccer once again\" she read aloud. \"A dog playing sports?\" gasped Luna. \"How?\" \"Who dares mention a dog?\" an ominous voice demanded. Phoenix and Luna jumped and turned to see Felix, an older, bigger cat. \"I was just reading aloud this paper\" apologised Phoenix. \"Well don't. You'll ruin the beautiful scene, created in this magnificent area of the forest, by mentioning the ones who chase us\" scolded Felix. \"I would say 'I am surprised to see you here at this time' but because it's you, Phoenix, I wouldn't expect anything less. And Luna, the next time you go chasing after her, you too will bear the consequences of defiance.\" \"S-sorry sir, it's j-just I t-thought- stammered the black cat. \"It was my fault I shouldn't have come when you ordered us not to go here\" interrupted the tiger cat. \"A noble gesture\" nodded Felix. \"Although, in this case, I shall have to ignore this- possibly hundredth- incident as we have exciting news for you, young cat's.\" \"Is it Abcat!\" cried an excited Luna. \"I said it was news not a miracle. It appear as though our great leader, Abzak, has decided to task you with the noble duty of finding and rescuing stray cat's\". Phoenix's eye's burst wide open. \"Seriously? Yes!\" cheered the young cat, before trying not to be overcome with too much surprise and nervousness. \"I mean, when d-do I begin?\" \"You can start tomorrow night\" answered Felix. Could this day get any better? Heck, it just started! Phoenix tried to remain calm but it was kinda hard when she was being told that she would finally be allowed to do the one thing she longed for more than anything, this time without getting in trouble and, with such a great opportunity, comes an even bigger opportunity: to perhaps see what else is out there, beyond the tree's. \"Congratulations, Phoenix\" congratulated Luna. \"See I told you something would happen eventually- I just didn't expect it to be five minute's after I said so.\" Phoenix looked at the paper again. \"I actually think it would be exciting to meet a dog, maybe a puppy\" she admitted. \"Think again, nothing but slobbering mutts who would chase us up a tree if they ever saw us\" said Felix. \"Now of you pop, it's breakfast time and you both seemed to have skipped it already, you wouldn't want the food to run out.\" As the two sprinted back towards the camp, Felix hovered over the ripped newspaper page and, after reading it,instantly ripped it to shreds, completely destroyed by his sharp claws.[Chapter 2] It was a few days after Santa buddies and the five Air buddies were still excited about this new adventure with Santa Paws. In Buddha's house, Sam had just left for school but the puppy was too tired to get up, instead he lay in his puppy bed for a while before finally deciding to make his way to the park, not wanting to keep his siblings waiting. Mudbud, however, woke up with a different feeling. An ill feeling. He felt cold, he felt weak and his throat was soar. The puppy brushed it off as just a morning thing and ran to the park anyway. Buddha decided to take the short cut through the woods to get to the park quicker however soon he stumbled onto an area he had not seen before. It had huge, tall, thick trees and Buddha thought he could hear unusual cat like noises from them. \"Sorry my timing was not perfect\" the Zen pup apologised. \"No problem-o dude\" replied Mudbud. \"You guys wont believe the BIG breakfast I had today\" the greedy Budderball told them. \"I mean I usually always have a big breakfast... \"Fo'shizzle dawg, I remember when Noah gave you a pizza for the first time\" giggled B-dawg. \"Hey sis, nice necklace\" Buddha complimented his sister who was wearing a new pink necklace. \"Thanks its awesome, Alice chose it for me\" thanked Rosebud. Buddha decided to tell the others what he had heard in the woods. \"Hey guys while I was heading here I heard these strange cat noises, like nothing I've ever heard before\". \"Where?\" asked Budderball. \"In this new area of the woods which we've never seen before\" replied Buddha. \"Say if it was a r-r-ritual\" gulped B-dawg. \"What?! Where'd you ever get an idea like that from?\" asked Rosebud. \"From this movie Billy was watching; the cult sacrificed other cats because they thought they could bring back the dead\" explained B-dawg. Rosebud then had a fun idea. \"Hey how about we all go into the woods at night, when are kids are asleep, and see who can stay for the longest\". \"But it's dark then\" whispered B-dawg. \"Scared of the dark, B-dawg?\" she taunted. \"Pshaw dawg! I aint scared of nothin!\" the scared pup denied. \"I just know that the youngest needs the most sleep\". \"It sounds like a fun game and I look forward to participating\" said Buddha. \"It's agreed then\" coughed Mudbud. \"Mudbud, are you feeling ok?\" asked Rosebud, who was always a bit protective over the mischievous second youngest. \"I'm fine\" promised Mudbud. \"You don't look fine\". \"No worries dudette it was just a sneeze\". \"I just need to remember to bring a doggie bag\" nodded Budderball. Meanwhile, in an alley, four dogs secretly met up at around 8:00 at night. One was Lark, an English Mastiff, who had overheard the Buddies talking about this \"new area of the woods\". He was joined by a former friend of Air bud, Spot an adult Dalmatian. Spot had spoken to Buddy back in the day but since he had puppies Buddy tried avoiding him, worrying that his friendship with Lark and the cynical hound Syndero would be a negative influence on his pup's. Last was Blaze, who had called them all here, a Labrador retriever who had aspirations to be a great leader. \"New area of the woods? Tall trees?\" repeated Spot. \"At least that's what I think I heard\" said Lark. \"Why are we here anyway?\" \"I've called you all here to discuss the strange fire's that I've been seeing coming from the woods\" announced Blaze, standing on a high box. \"They are no bonfires, or a camp site, I believe that they are something much worse, yet I have not seen one person enter that area\". \"Perhaps arson?\" suggested Lark. \"You have great listening skills Lark, I literally just said I saw not one person enter\". \"Like the enemy cats?\" said a voice. \"Exactly- What?\" began Blaze. An elderly German Shepherd stepped out of the shadows. \"Dennis? What do you mean enemy cats?\" \"You all remember the incident in Oakfield when a truck containing lots of cats crashed into the woods and were never seen again?\" asked Dennis. The others nodded.\"Well those cats were rivals with another cat gang in Oakfield and they both had a bloody fight, that forced the mayor to send them all away, when they crashed. Now these cats have learnt to fight and survive in the wild by themselves and they sacrifice other animals to their great dead cat leader, Abcat\". \"Wow\" began Lark. \"I have never heard anything more disturbing and unnatural in all my life!\" \"Every word I say is true, except maybe the part about their 'great leader' I'm sure he wasn't all that nice\". \"I find this story difficult to believe\" said Spot. \"How do you know all this?\" \"Me and my cat friend, Flame, were walking in the woods one day when they grabbed us, I escaped but Flame wasn't so lucky and if those puppies enter the woods they're doomed\" revealed the elderly dog. \"Well one things for sure pets have been disappearing for the past six weeks\" noted Blaze. \"Maybe we should follow the pup's so they can lead us to this new area\" suggested Spot, who really wanted to keep the Buddies out of danger. \"Those babies probably saw a tall tree and got scared!\" laughed Lark. \"I haven't had some fun in ages let's do it\". \"So you think the disappearance of cats is related to the fires?\" asked Blaze. \"Yes, I believe something is out there- attacking nature, and I implore you to watch over the Air buddies as I fear their fate will coincide with the missing cats\" urged Dennis. \"You must put out the fire before the flames get bigger\". \"Literally; like there is literally flames in those woods\" added Blaze. \"Alright this is our moment, you four have been chosen because, well not because your the best but at least your second best...possibly.\" \"That's debatable\" muttered Lark. At night, the Buddies met up outside the woods. \"Where's B-dawg?\" wondered Buddha. \"I was just...looking for berries you know how hungry Budderball gets\" lied the frightened puppy, coming out from the bushes. \"Alright what are the stakes?\" asked Rosebud. \"Yum I want stake\" drooled Budderball. \"Not that kind of stake, I mean what's the reward for the one that stays the longest?\" \"How about last one to run out gets everyone's leftover candy canes from Christmas?\" suggested Budderball. The others agreed. \"Remember let's not get too competitive this is just for fun\" Buddha reminded them. The Buddies entered, followed by Blaze's gang. They were joined by the sly, cynical hound Syndero who missed the meeting. \"So what happens to the cats do they kill themselves in this fire?\" asked Syndero. \"Ooh so scary\" Lark mocked the Buddies. \"Lark that's not funny, remember their just puppies\" Spot nudged him. \"Oh right you and Air bud used to know each other\" noted Blaze. \"Alright let's find these puppies and get to the bottom of the cat-astrophe\". \"Boo!\" Syndero booed at his bad pun. \"I'll stay at the back...in case someone sneaks up on us\". \"You mean so you can run out first if something happens\" Lark corrected him.[Chapter 3] The Buddies walked through the huge owl began hooting. \"What was that dawgs!\" cried B-dawg. \"Dude it was just an owl\" stated Mudbud. \"B-dawg your definitely losing this contest\" taunted Rosebud. \"Pshaw, how's about you stand aside and let the B take the lead\" B-dawg tried acting tough. \"Wait do you guys hear that?\" whispered Buddha, his ears perking. \"It sounds like...singing\". \"Yo I don't know what song their singing but it sounds AWFUL!\" exclaimed B-dawg They spotted bright light from up ahead and went over to see. The pups poked their little heads through the bush and were greeted with a horrific sight. Before them were lots of cats singing about how great cats are and looking up at a big cat who was standing on the top of a crashed truck with a small fire below it. He had scars all over him and was addressing the others, appearing to be their leader. \"We should go\" decided Buddha. \"Yeah lets go\" B-dawg agreed. As they turned to leave, they soon realised they were lost. \"Wrong way you twits!\" shouted began to rustle. \"You're lost aren't you?\" said another voice. Blaze and the others emerged from the trees. \"Nope, see I led us to them\". \"Huh Spot what are you doing here?\" Rosebud recognized her dad's old friend. \"Oh we thought we would check out this new area as well and we wanted to keep you safe\" replied Spot. \"Now you shouldn't be here, we've been looking everywhere for you!\" \"You were, we weren't \" corrected Syndero. \"We just came to see this new area\". \"Ok,hmm we're officially lost!\" declared Lark, looking around. \"Why shouldn't we be here?\" questioned Mudbud. \"Why? I'll tell you why, the cats live here!\" cried Blaze.\"Also, I can't be the only one who's noticed that you look like your gonna throw up, that's reason enough\". \"So? there are plenty of cats in Fernfield dawgs\" said B-dawg. \"These cats aren't from Fernfield!\" cried Lark. \"There a cult like... bunch of weirdo's!\" \"Hmm well I can't recognize this place\" sighed Syndero, looking around. \"Does anyone know we're the wolves live?\" \"No but never fear they don't live around these parts...I think\" said Spot. \"Don't worry my nose smells the way home\" sniffed Budderball, but all he could smell was apples. \"All I smell is apples!\" \"No kidding dawg this whole place is full of apple trees!\" scolded B-dawg. He begam attenpting to climb up the apple tree, holding onto the branches, to get some apples. \"Check it Budderball's turned into a monkey\" laughed B-dawg. \"Budderball cut it out we need to go now!\" demanded Rosebud. Budderball accidentally broke the branch, making him fall and revealing a scary looking silver cat. It hissed at them, showing it's claws. \"I have a bad feeling about this\" said Syndero. \"I have more of a strange feeling\" added Budderball. \"Probably hunger\" \"Who cares, kill it!\" yelled Lark, lunging at it. But the cat scratched his paw and escaped. Syndero and Lark gave chase, running over the muddy small hill. \"Blaze bring those midgets over here!\" Blaze led the others over the hill where Syndero was staring at a truck that was broken down. It looked similar to the one Grim and Denning used in Air buddies. \"Hide the shrimps in there while we find the right way\" suggested Lark. \"Who are you calling names?\" snapped Rosebud. The Buddies got into the back seat while Blaze and Spot went in the front. After a while it began to rain; Blaze and the pup's fell asleep; Mudbud was still sneezing and Spot was silently waiting. \"Dawg, you look terrible\" noted B-dawg. \"I think I've caught a cold\" sniffed Mudbud. Syndero stopped searching, hearing twigs break. \"Lark?\" he whispered. The noises got louder and several footsteps were heard. Blaze narrowly opened his eyes and stared out the window. \"Maybe it's the truck\" he whispered. \"I sense we are not alone\" said Buddha, waking up. Suddenly several angry cats began appearing out of the trees, from the bushes and the hill. \"You two get in!\" ordered Blaze. \"Are you kidding? A broken car won't stop these monsters I'm running for my life!\" screamed Syndero. \"Buddies get behind me!\" ordered Spot, leaving the jeep with the Buddies following and hiding behind the Dalmatian. More and more cats appeared, each snarling and getting their claws ready. \"These sacred woods should not be a place where conflict occurs, it has stood on the Earth for centuries\" advised Buddha. \"Tell them that!\" snapped Syndero, walking back. \"Now if you excuse me, I'm gonna abandon you\". \"On second thought run for your lives!\" shouted Blaze. With that everyone scattered, each running in different directions followed by swarms of cat's. Budderball and Rosebud were cornered near some rocks while B-dawg and Buddha were captured when they reached a shallow river. Mudbud returned to the jeep and hid out the storm of cats before exiting. He tried rolling around in some dirt so the cats wouldn't see him, but a Bengal tiger cat found him. \"How dare you disturb us!\" she hissed. \"Disturb you in s-sacrificing animals?\" stammered Mudbud. \"What? No! We give other cats medicine to keep them safe from the evil cat's from Oakfield that drove us out\". \"Why'd they drive you out?\" \"When our leader died half of our group turned on us so they could rule the alley; they framed us for a crime and got us sent here\" explained the tiger cat. \"That's awful, you shouldn't have been kicked out of your home\". The cat looked at the cute, dirty puppy, sneezing and her voice changed to a concerned one instead of a threatening one. \"You look awful!\" \"Thanks for noticing\" Mudbud sarcastically replied. \"No I mean...you look ill..your face is so pale\" she noticed. \"You don't seem that bad, come, maybe I can convince Abzak to let your friends go and get you some help\". \"Their my family actually, although they are like my friends\" Mudbud corrected her. \"And I don't want anything to happen to them.\" \"Right now you need to worry about yourself\". They headed back to the \"camp\" when it started raining. \"Can't you hurry up it's raining?\" groaned the cat. \"I like the rain it makes everything more muddy\" grinned Mudbud. \"Your weird\" she narrowed her eyes. \"In case you forgot dudette you were the one who suddenly switched mood's\". \"Come again?\" \"You were about to capture me but then you suddenly became all nice and offered to help me\". \"That's because I saw you were ill and it would be cruel to just a leave a defenceless, sick, lost creature in the middle of the woods without any help\" defended the cat. \"Even if that creature is a dumb dog\". Syndero met up with Blaze and Spot over by some rocks, who were reading a sign with black paint that spelt out a warning. \"Dead men tell no tales\" Blaze nervously read it. \"Heh, nice to see pirate talk is still common. Wonder if it applies to dog's as well\". \"Well this was nice, see ya\" declared Syndero, preparing to leave but Blaze stopped him. \"Where do you think your going?\" he demanded. \"The forest has been invaded by a hundred cat's, who kill themselves,I'm getting outta here!\" shouted Syndero. \"We can't just leave!\" \"Do you have a better idea?\" \"We can't just leave those poor puppies out here by themselves- with those evil cat's\" stated Spot. \"We can't?\" repeated the hound. \"And besides if we save them we'll be treated as hero's and I'll finally get the respect I deserve\" Blaze, who always wanted to be treated as a hero. \"Right you go on and do that, but I'd rather stay alive than be a hero\" dismissed the hound.[Chapter 4] They arrived at the destroyed truck where the other cats were giving Mudbud evil looks. \"Is THAT our lunch? It's filthy!\" whispered a Siamese cat. An older Himalayan cat, Drest, came in front of them. \"Phoenix you know better than to bring intruders here\" he scolded. \"Sorry, sir, it's just well...this pup is very sick and I figured it was only right that we help this lost one\" apologised the tiger cat. \"He does look rather poorly, very well, take him to the truck with the others while we prepare some medicine\" allowed Drest. She led him to another truck which was stuck in a pond. The other Buddies were trapped in the front seat of the truck. \"I've always wondered if i could drive\" said Budderball. \"Mudbud thank goodness your ok!\" exclaimed Rosebud. \"Your looking even more sick\". \"It was wrong of us to enter the woods and even more foolish to bring you with us in this state\" admitted Buddha. \"Dawg's these cats are gonna s-sacrifice us just like in that movie!\" panicked B-dawg. \"Chill dude, these cats don't seem that bad; that female one said she was gonna give me something to make me better\" said Mudbud. \"Mudbud's correct, B-dawg, try to calm down\" agreed Buddha. \"I hope they give us some food\" wished Budderball. \"Shh! I can hear them talking\" hissed Rosebud. A tom and black cat were talking outside the truck. \"What about the grown dogs?\" asked the tom cat. \"They fled\" replied the black cat. \"What did Abzak say about the pup's?\" \"He said...\" whispered the tom, saying something that made them both laugh. After a while, the cat's bought the puppies towards the middle of their camp. Their leader, Abzak the cat they saw earlier standing on top of the truck, came down to see them. \"Greetings I am Abzak leader of the cats of Oakfield and rightful ruler of the alley's of that town\" he introduced. The Buddies nervously looked at his scars. \"Hi my names Rosebud\" greeted the female puppy, who was more braver than her brother's. \"My names Budderball and this is Buddha, Mudbud and B-dawg\" added Budderball. \"What brings you here?\" asked the cat leader. \"W-we were just exploring this new area of the woods we had no intention of disrupting your bonfire\" apologised Buddha. \"Bonfire? No no no, you see we use the fire to create medicine for us and the other stray's who ask us for help. You see we have been living in these woods for years and so we have been made to create our own means of survival\" explained Abzak. \"I'm sorry this must be the most unusual thing you small pup's have ever seen\". \"Nah we've seen much more unusual things\" replied Rosebud. \"It is raining and late, you will not be safe with the wolves out at this time would you like to stay the night here?\" offered Abzak. The tired Buddies agreed and were taken to a tree which had lots of food in a hammock attached to it. Other cats were there to and they didn't seem to happy about having to share their food with dogs. But after Abzak talked to them they all welcomed the puppies. Abzak went over to the black cat, Gust, and the Himalayan cat, Drest. \"Hmm, maybe Abcat will appreciate dogs keep an eye on them and meet the other leaders in the truck in an hour for a meeting\" he ordered. Budderball began eating the fruit. He didn't like being so high up but he was so hungry he didn't care. \"Do you guys have any burgers?\" he greedily asked. \"Wow you eat a lot!\" exclaimed one cat. B-dawg was keeping his distance. \"What's wrong B-dawg, not hungry?\" asked Buddha. \"Yo, did you dawg's forget what Lark told us\" stammered B-dawg who still had a bad feeling about these cat's. \"Try to relax, B-dawg, this is a good opportunity to get along with other animals, besides this high tree looks like an excellent place to meditate and be one with nature\" advised the Zen pup. Buddha went to one of the top branches and began meditating. Other cats came over to him, intrigued by what he was doing and some even joined him. One black cat, Midnight, and a slightly lighter cat, Luna, noticed B-dawg keeping his distance and decided to go over to him, as Abzak told them to make the puppies feel welcome. \"Not hungry?\" asked Midnight, making B-dawg jump. \"Nah I'm not hungry\" he lied. \"No offense. I'm sure it tastes nice\". \"So...do you like dancing?\" she asked. \"Fo'shizzle I'm the best!\" boasted B-dawg. \"Would you like to prove it?\" Midnight challenged. Luna went over to the destroyed truck and inserted \"Years\" by Dex Arson into the music player. \"I recognize this tune from a game\" realised B-dawg, before he showed of his dance moves to his new \"audience\" who cheered him on. Rosebud was telling a group of young cat's about their adventures in Snow and Space buddies. Mudbud spotted an area with a lot of mud and begam rolling in it, trying to ignore his ill feeling. After shaking it all off, Gust came down to him. \"So you just wandered in here, willingly, into these woods?\" he asked suspiciously. \"Well.. we um..you see\" mumbled Mudbud. Phoenix then came over to them. \"Leave him alone Gust, trust me if they were up to something I would've known\" she told him. Gust walked away to listen to Rosebud's story. \"Please continue, I did not mean to disturb\" he told her. \"So what's your name?\" asked Phoenix. \"I'm Mudbud\" he answered. \"Hmm I can see why they would call you that\" she smirked. \"My name's Phoenix, and I can see your still ill. Here, Drest made this medicine for you\". She pushed a small wooden bowl with some medicine suitable for animals in. Mudbud slowly drank it. Phoenix looked at him closely. \"Er..what are you doing? \" he asked. \"Just seeing if you really are a spy for Oakfield\" she replied. \"So what are you dudes and dudettes doing out here?\" \"Were waiting for our leader, Abcat, to return to guide us home. We use this medicine to protect ourselves and other strays from diseases, you don't get vets out here. They work to because those cat's are allowed to return home. Once we help enough cats Abcat will return and end these feuds\" explained the female cat. \"Wow-za's that sounds like a totally epic movie idea!\" exclaimed Mudbud. \"But do you ever watch these rituals?\" \"No no I'm to young only our elders can watch them\" said Phoenix. \"Well, nice talking to you\". She ran of to join her friends. The Buddies regrouped near the outside of the camp. \"These cats are like amazing friends!\" cried Rosebud. \"Look Luna gave me this flower bow, she's an awesome cat\" \"They understood and respected our doggie characteristics\" added Buddha. \"The food is delicious!\" drooled Budderball. \"I-I'm not so sure about this I think we should leave\" said a worried B-dawg. \"Dude, remember the wolves and besides these cats aren't bad, they were driven out of their home by other cats\" explained Mudbud. \"That's horrible!\" cried Rosebud. Just then Blaze and the others jumped out from the trees. \"Have no fear Blaze is here\" he announced. \"Come on cat's I'll take you all on!\" challenged Lark. \"Er I said only do that if you see them their clearly not here so don't alert them to us you fool!\" scolded Blaze. \"Guys your just in time the food's almost finished\" said Budderball. \"You idiot's were all food!\" shouted Syndero. \"Syndero be nice\" glared Spot. \"Oh sorry. Please you fools we must go as we are all food\" Syndero corrected himself. His new reply wasn't any better though. \"Chillax dudes these cats are nice their not murderers\" said Mudbud. The Buddies explained everything the cats had told them. After Syndero said \"Let me get this straight, if they help enough cats with this medicine, randomly and magically out pops their crazy, dead leader. Also they just send the cats they 'cure' home?\" \"That's the most insane, stupid and nonsensical thing I've ever heard!\" laughed Lark. \"No really, look they gave me this bow\" Rosebud showed off. \"I have never seen a more ridiculous looking item on top of anyone's head ever\" retorted Lark. \"We've found a path that seems right quickly we must go\" said Spot. \"Your folks are probably worried sick\". \"We have?\" asked Syndero. \"I have anyway but don't worry you wont get lost following the fearless Blaze\" boasted the Labrador. \"Everyone run for your lives. Yeah so fearless\" mocked the English Mastiff, repeating what Blaze screamed earlier. \"Ok let us say goodbye to the cats first\" decided Rosebud. \"Talk? Talk to a cat?\" questioned Syndero. \"You complete weirdo's. Fine, go talk oh and when you get eaten, remember to vouch for us\". Abzak said the Buddies were allowed to visit them again but only if they kept it a secret.[Chapter 5] The next day, the Buddies were feeling really tired, since they were awake for so long yesterday night. So when their owner's left for school, they were to lazy to go to the park. So when Buddy and Molly went to the park they were surprised to see that their pup's werent there. \"Where do you think they are?\" asked Buddy. They didn't tell anyone, as they didn't want anyone to think he was a coward for running from cat's and him and Spot wanted to find out more about the cat's before they decided what to do. Also Spot felt uneasy about talking to Buddy after so long so he didn't tell their parent's. Lark and Syndero just didn't really care if the other's didn't. \"Probably busy, you know they are growing up quickly\" guessed Molly. \"Yeah it was only a few days ago when they saved Christmas\" chortled Buddy. Mudbud eventually got up and decided to walk around town, hoping to bump into one of the others. He found B-dawg talking to his \"friend\", Bell. The Buddies other new friends, Ally and Fragile, moved out of town a few months ago. Budderball was, of course, next to the bakery, waiting to see if anyone dropped any food. \"Hey dude!\" greeted Mudbud. \"Oh hi Mudbud, your just in time they've taken out the pastries!\" drooled the chubby pup. \"That medicine's something all right, your looking much better!\" The two then began discussing the cat's. \"You think we should go to their party thing or whatever?\" \"Totally, it sounds super radical!\" replied Mudbud. But lets not go to much in case we get followed, they said they don't want to be discovered\". \"I can't believe they were kicked out of their homes. Wonder what they were framed for?\" wondered the chubby pup. \"We should ask Buddha and Rosebud if they want to go\". \"The dudette has already bonded with all the girl cat's\" noted Mudbud. He ran of the find them. While he wandering around the park, he saw Phoenix walking along the outskirts of the woods. \"Hey Phoenix\" he greeted. \"Didn't think I'd see you outside the woods\". \"Well usually it's my job to find stray cats but this time I... actually came looking for you, Buddies\" she admitted. \"When I saw you normal pet's I wanted to see how it's like so I'm ready when I get a home and a human\". \"What do you mean 'normal pet's'?\" asked the dirty pup. \"You know, you have owners, a house, an easy life we don't have the same luck as you. Our dream is to life like normal cats do. So can you show me how to be a normal pet?\" \"No problem-o dudette\" accepted Mudbud. He took her to his front garden. \"So you know what a mud bath is right? It's an awesome way for a dog to chill\" asked Mudbud. \"Right except I'm a cat\" she reminded him. \"Oh, right. Well, from what I know, normal cat's pay with yarn ball's\" The two went to Mrs. Niggles, the pet sitter's, house. They looked through the window which was left open because she was making a pie and wanted to let some fresh in the house. \"Ok we got to be quiet\" Mudbud advised her. The two sneaked in through the window and, although Mudbud's dirty paws left prints, they were very careful not be seen. \"Ok here they are, Mrs Niggles yarn balls\" Mudbud whispered. Phoenix couldn't help but to start playing with it. However, she ended up throwing them around everywhere, getting them tangled around the chairs, tables and furniture. \"Er dudette, not a good idea\" Mudbud nervously told her. \"Sorry it's just so fun!\" she cried. She hit a white yarn ball in the air, which reminded Mudbud of volleyball, his favourite sport. \"Yeah...I guess it seems pretty chill\" admitted Mudbud, joining in. However, this ended up making a mess of the sitting room. Footsteps were then heard. \"Quick lets scram!\" ordered Mudbud. They jumped back out the window just before she came in. She looked around and let out a loud scream. The two young troublemakers quickly ran off. \"Wow that's the most fun I've had in ages!\" laughed Phoenix. \"I hope that old lady's ok\". \"She'll be fine, trust me cleaning is all she knows\" Mudbud assured her but then got the idea that the cat's didn't have fun like they did. \"Wait you guys aren't allowed to hang loose\". \"We have serious work to do it's hard trying to prepare each other to get back to Oakfield and for Abcat's return\" Phoenix explained. \"Who's that dude again?\" \"He was our great leader from when we lived in Oakfield but when he died their was a feud between cat's over territory, you know how cat's are, and they framed Abzak for starting a brawl and him and his followers were supposed to be sent out of state but those same bad cats caused the truck to crash, leaving us stranded here. I was very young when it happened, I don't remember what I saw exactly but all I know is my job\" continued the tiger cat. \"Wow-za's I didn't think you had jobs!\" exclaimed Mudbud. \"So what's yours?\" \"My job is to look for stray cat's and bring them back with us so they can have a home in Oakfield once we give them medicine to protect them from any diseases\" she replied. \"I've taken in a lot\". \"That sounds stressful\" stated Mudbud, who liked living life stress free. \"But that's totally cool of you to help lots of strays find a home\". \"Yeah but I just wish I could find one for myself but if I go back without Abcat, they'll just send me right back. Well I probably should be getting home\". \"Wait! I think I know one place that might cheer you up\" said the dirty pup. \"Really where?\" Buddy and Molly noticed Mudbud was playing with a cat, and were quite surprised. \"Is that Mudbud playing with a cat?\" asked Air bud. \"It seems the Buddies have learned to make new friends\" guessed Molly, smiling. But the wise Dennis knew everything the young cat was saying was a lie and that Abzak and his followers were the real villains of the story. Although he was glad that Mudbud was helping Phoenix, he knew that she was being used and tricked by her leader's. But whenever he tried bringing this up to Lark or Syndero, the two dismissed it, showing little interest in this whole \"cat cult\" thing. \"Who uses fire to make medicine!?\" cried Syndero. \"Did witches own these cat's or something?\" \"This is just a minor setback\" lectured Blaze. \"I know morale must be low, what with nothing being solved yet\". \"Not really\" said Lark. \"Oh are we still doing this?\" asked Syndero. \"First the info we got from the Buddies,- these are the same cats that made headlines for getting involved in a massive brawl a while back- and crashed into these woods after being framed. Now the Buddies- a group of five golden retriever siblings related to a dog called Air bud, showing up out of nowhere only to become one of the best- \"We know who he is, Blaze, we all saw his big moment!\" \"But I believe as long as you believe in me and what I believe, opposing any incorrect beliefs that others belief that believing in me is wrong, that we shall triumph\" continued Blaze. \"We'll start by putting our facts together on the cat group and the disappearing cats\". \"You don't think they joined their little group?\" wondered Spot. \"Hardly, just as I refuse to believe that they send them home, as they told the Buddies, we'll start by searching the alleys- all stray cats hang out there\". \"Blaze, sir?\" interrupted Lark. \"What is it?\" \"Can we at least switch places with you and stand next to the radiator, it's -5 degrees out here\" At night, Mudbud and Phoenix were outside the Winter fair that would be closing soon. It was dark and scary, yet the fair was bright and the lights were strangely on. \"What are we doing here?\" asked Phoenix. \"I think I know one thing that'll make you forget your troubles, the fair\" replied Mudbud. \"You mean this place?\" asked the amazed cat, staring at all the illuminations beyond the gate. \"It looks amazing!\" Mudbud spied a hole in the brick wall surrounding the entrance and crawled in. When he got to the other side he was surprised to see that Phoenix was already there. \"Huh? How'd you get there?\" he wondered. \"You know we could've just crawled under\" said Phoenix, pointing to the space under the barred gate. \"Oh right...I knew that but it's just that here in the world outside the forest, it's considered rude to crawl under gates\" lied Mudbud. \"Yeah, nice try\" dismissed the cat.[Chapter 6] They went inside the hall of mirrors and went to the only room that wasn't locked, the first one. It was surrounded by mirrors in a circular formation around the room. \"Whoa!\" commented Phoenix, looking at her weird reflection's. \"I know right, to bad the other rooms are closed\" sighed Mudbud, walking closer to see his own reflection. \"Are you sure you want to do that, I would hate for you to get seven years bad luck?\" jeered Phoenix. \"Ha-ha\" Mudbud pretended to laugh, as he stepped closer. There was no reflection. There was no nothing. Not even the reflection of the anything in the background, nor Phoenix, was even in the mirror. \"Ha you even scared off your own reflection\" giggled the female cat, continuing her taunting. \"That's not normal\" muttered Mudbud, suddenly backing away as a gust of wind swept through the open door's and hit against him. He stepped back, towards Phoenix, as more, heavier gust's of wind smashed through the doors and encircled the room. Those same pair of door's suddenly slammed closed, trapping the wind on the other side, along with the pair. Before them was no longer simple mirror's. No, it was a petrifying figure that appeared motionlessly in all six of the mirrors spiralling the room. Dark suit; dark helmet; two army-like solider pad's; what looks like a blaster in its' belt and black mist surrounding the figure like a phantom but only it was concealed to the mirror. \"W-what is this?\" whispered the fearful Phoenix. \"Is this part of the trick?\" \"No. I mean, I don't think so\" stammered Mudbud, slightly stepping forward and looking up at the figure- well one of them anyway- which in turn looked down at it with its' gloomy, grim, bleak helmet. \"W-who are you?\" \"You mean what are you?\" whispered Phoenix. The spectre refused to speak, instead letting out a ghastly sound that sent a chills up the two animal's spine's. The sound was so sinister that Death itself would waver from this land and instead seek another, knowing one demon already occupies this one. \"I mean that's cool if you don't want to tell me\" stammered Mudbud. \"I respect privacy, if you don't want to say your name you don't have too. I mean, I don't want to say my name as well, it sound's weird, 'Mudbud', see.\" \"Except you kinda just told him\" whispered Phoenix, nudging him slightly, indicating they should move. She slowly backed away towards the exit, followed by Mudbud. Finally, the spirit uttered words that sounded so terrifying that it could perhaps purge every thing good about this fair and turn it into a graveyard. \"PUPPIES! SO YOU ARE PUPPIES!\" it spoke. It lunged forward, breaking through the glass barrier and as it did so, all the other mirror's smashed and the glass scattered everywhere, all except for the middle one, where the figure was stepping out off. Phoenix immediately dashed out the door's, followed by Mudbud, running as fast as their small legs could go. \"You should not have ventured into the town, Phoenix\" the voice of the phantom continued plaguing them as they ran, without stopping. \"Phoenix do you know this thing?\" asked Mudbud, changing direction and going inside the bumper car arena. \"No I have no idea what's he or its' talking about!\" denied the tiger cat, trying to run along the floor, but the graphite on the surface and the metal strip's were making it difficult. Suddenly, the light's on the front of the bumper car's turned on, trailing them like a pair of eye's. Breaking free from it's metal power polarity, that would usually keep it attached to the ceiling to allow them to move, the car's began recklessly driving ferociously around the metal surface. Charging at one another and encircling the two as they tried to escape; these monstrosities had not been switched on. It was almost like they had been possessed. Phoenix attempted to break for the barrier in front of her, that surrounded the arena but Mudbud quickly pulled her back, as another dodgem soared past, letting out a roar that was as fierce as the wind the car's bought with them as they zoomed past. Mudbud tried to look for an escape route, however the car's were moving at lightning speed, making it impossible to locate any such route. Adjusting his head slightly, he noticed the dark figure standing in the control booth, watching gravely at the scene which he had created. \"This way!\" he instructed, noticing one car crash into another and spiral out of control, breaking the already irregular formation. They barely made it out, by crawling through the metal pole's of the protective gate. \"Let's get far away from here\" insisted Phoenix, trembling slightly. \"Agreed dudette\" said Mudbud, as they ran along a path that led to another attraction in this carnival of the damned. They hadn't gotten far when they came across a swan ride. \"Let's hide in this ride, ghost's hate water\" panted Mudbud. \"Then again, so do I\". \"What, where'd you hear that?\" questioned Phoenix. \"No wait, that's witches that hate water; ghost's hate light\" he suddenly remembered. \"But I ain't no witch, I just hate getting wet\". Another swan boat made it's way to the platform and Mudbud and Phoenix stepped forward, preparing to get inside. Instead of being greeted with the happy music that always plays in these rides, they were stunned when the metal head of the swan began rotating. It turned to face them and the two were horrified at this chilling sight. Black ink, originating from the eye's, flooded down the face and it's lipstick had been smothered all around the metal head. It's beak had been stretched and torn apart. Phoenix let out a scream and hid behind Mudbud, as the phantom emerged from the seat, cackling. \"I'm curious as to what your plan was for after you finish the ride,\" cackled the spectre, taking a step out of the boat. \"Get away from us!\" shouted Mudbud. \"No it is you who must get away\" rebuked the phantom. \"Phoenix return to the wood's, do not betray your brethren for this filthy mutt, return to the wood's and your leader will return; you will live a normal life\". \"Oh yeah well...you look like...Darth Vader\" Mudbud 'insulted' him back. \"That's not funny\" \"Dude, the dude who's being insulted is not the dude who's gonna laugh cause he's the dude being insulted by the dude doing the laughing\" riddled Mudbud. \"...That makes no sense\" Dark Anthem struggled to get his his head wrapped around that one. \"That's a lot of 'dudes'...oh I get it now\". In this confusion, the two had slipped away from him, they were running out through the same hole they entered from. Anthem sped after them, but the sun was beginning to rise. \"Hurry!\" cried Phoenix, seeing the phantom charging behind him. Mudbud ran out, just as the sun rose and Anthem was about to grab his tail. He vanished and all that remained was black mist, surrounding the area he was standing. Later, by the park, Phoenix instructed Mudbud to wait outside as she prepared to head back. She came out moments later with something for him. A rare purple flower. \"Wow-za's this flower is incredible!\" stated Mudbud. \"Yep it's incredibly rare, consider it a little thank you present\" agreed Phoenix. \"You can keep it, basically\". \"Thanks\". \"So you and your sibling's are going today right? You'll get to see the medicine making process yourself\". \"Definitely it sounds rad, we'll see you there\" promised Mudbud. Blaze and the others were standing in an alley, clueless and surrounded by a terrible smell. On top of that it was raining heavily on all of them. \"Well...\" began Blaze, cursing. \"Amazing find, Blaze, the weather's even worse than before\" Lark sarcastically said.[Chapter 7] Dennis looked everywhere but he couldn't find the Buddies anywhere. Finally, he decided to tell their parents. He found Buddy outside Noah's house with his mate, Molly. \"Dennis we didn't expect to see you here\" greeted a surprised Buddy. \"How are you anyway?\" \"I'm afraid there's no time to catch up\" said Dennis, gravely. \"Your puppies are in great danger\" \"What?!\" cried a worried Molly. Dennis told them the story about the cats as well as everything Blaze told him about what happened that night. \"So you think their going to sacrifice them!?\" panicked Buddy. \"If they were nice to them, it was clearly an attempt trick them and they've fallen into Abzak's trap\" said Dennis. \"I'm going after them!\" declared Air bud. \"No!\" Dennis stopped him. \"There's too many of them and their dangerous. Molly can you go get Deputy Sniffer, we're going to need his help. Spot and the other's know the way we'll need their help\". Molly rushed off. \"I haven't spoken to Spot in ages but I'll do anything to save my pups\" said Buddy. Meanwhile, the Buddies were walking through the new area of the woods, which wasn't so new anymore and looked around. \"So what now?\" wondered Rosebud, who was wearing a light blue necklace. \"Another new necklace, Rosebud?\" noticed Buddha. \"Yep, I think it's totally fetch don't you?\" asked Rosebud. \"Fo'shizzle dawg...er I mean sis\" replied B-dawg. \"Wow i didn't realise how much my bling glows when the moon shines on it\". \"I'd choose blue over pink any day\" added Mudbud. \"Boy's and pink don't go\" sighed the female pup. \"It seems as though nature has led us in the right course as I see smoke in the distance, must be their camp\" assumed Buddha. \"Alright this medicine making thing sounds totally rad!\" hyped Mudbud. \"So it's soutta like a party?\" wondered Budderball. \"Awesome I hope they have party food!\" \"Budderball be polite, don't beg them for food we must respect and understand their way of life\" advised Buddha. \"Alright dawg's lets follow that smoke\" said B-dawg. He was still a bit nervous of the cats because of that movie but he was feeling a bit better about it than he did yesterday, thanks to Midnight. When they arrived they were greeted by Abzak, Gust and Loom. \"Ah so you decided to return, welcome back\" greeted Abzak. \"And please accept my apologies for being nosy yesterday\" Gust apologized to Mudbud, hiding a grin. \"No problem-o dude\" accepted the dirty pup. \"Hey Rosebud you look more pretty with that new necklace\" complimented Loom. Abzak led them to the crashed truck and instructed them to wait there. \"Sorry we weren't expecting you to come so early, please wait here until we've finished preparing\". \"See B-dawg, he's just a nice old cat\" Buddha told his scared brother. \"You shouldn't judge someone by the way they look\". \"Yeah I knew that dawg it's just those scars kinda give me the creeps\" lied B-dawg. \"Where's Phoenix?\" wondered Mudbud. \"Didn't Abzak say the younger cats were asleep? Why, you miss her?\" asked Rosebud. \"Well she is the reason I'm not still sick and the reason we got back home\" he reminded them. Buddy and Dennis arrived at the park where Blaze was briefing his \"troops\". Buddy began getting nervous when he noticed Spot. \"Syndero you are needed here\" said Blaze. \"Why?\" he questioned. \"Because one: we'll probably figure out the cat mystery a lot sooner. Two: Dennis requested you for some reason and three because I said so!\" \"Did he now?\" repeated Syndero, glaring at Dennis. \"Blaze! The Buddies are in danger!\" he panted. \"Will that be all, I'm sought of in the middle of a grand scheme?\" asked Blaze, impatiently. \"The cat's have kidnapped them!\" interrupted Buddy. Sniffer and Molly then arrived. \"Nope! Uh-uh no way am I going back there! No way!\" refused Syndero. \"Please they might hurt my pups!\" begged Molly. \"Lady if we go back their gonna hurt us!\" replied Syndero. \"Syndero, you coward puppies are in trouble and you insist on doing nothing!\" scolded Blaze. \"It's called trying not to die\" corrected Syndero. \"Besides the pups said their nice\". \"But that's just what they want them to think!\" retorted Dennis. \"Come on do it in the name of the law\" pleaded Sniffer. Buddy then asked Spot to help and, after much hesitation, he agreed. \"Well I suppose I can't just sit here while puppies are in danger\" sighed Lark. \"Ok my group is in\" affirmed Blaze. \"Group? I ain't part of your gang of lunatics!\" yelled Syndero. They all glared at him. \"But...Ok fine but when I die you stay away from my funeral.\" The eight dogs ran of into the forest, on a mission to save the Buddies. After 10 minutes B-dawg started to get bored. \"Oh come on this is taking forever!\" he whined. \"I'm gonna go take a look\". \"B-dawg wait!\" cried Buddha. But it was to late B-dawg had run out the truck. \"Lets go reel him in before he breaks something\" moaned Rosebud. The Buddies followed their troublesome brother outside. \"Yo dawg's over here\" whispered B-dawg. He had found a crashed truck which was stuck in a pond. There was lights coming from it. Inside was Abzak and the other elders talking in the back of the truck. \"B-dawg this is an invasion of privacy\" Buddha told him off. \"We need to go back and wait!\" hissed Rosebud. \"Shh I can hear them talking about us\" retorted B-dawg. \"The cage is just being reinforced with strong branches we've never sacrificed dogs before\" said Drest, the Himalayan cat. \"For ten years we have been cursed to these woods, no more!\" declared Abzak. \"This is a sign. Dark Anthem was right, with the sacrifice of puppies we will finally resurrect Abcat so we may rule the alleyways of Oakfield and rule the town's cats!\" The others cheered. \"I knew it w-we're gonna be sacrificed!\" yelped B-dawg. \"I thought they were nice. What does this have to do with medicine\" questioned Rosebud. \"Those foolish cats of Oakfield who tried stopping us will soon be dealt with\" vowed the Burmese cat, Felix. \"Good thing I jabbed my claws at that driver otherwise we would be in a whole other state\" \"Hey don't take all the credit I helped!\" added a Siamese cat. \"Shh we don't want to wake the younger cat's!\" hissed Drest. \"They weren't born during the attack and do not know about what happened. If they are to continue following us, they must believe we are giving the strays we bring in medicine and sending them to a loving home in Oakfield\". \"Er, hang on I thought these cats were framed for a crime and sent away but now I'm starting to think THOSE cats were good and these are the bad ones\" realised Budderball. \"All except one young cat who I've taught quite a bit\" revealed Abzak. \"That's not cool, they've been lying to Phoenix and the others\" said Mudbud. \"We got to set them free\". \"Mudbud's right, we need to get Deputy Sniffer, lets go quickly\" Rosebud quickly agreed. They were now terrified and wanted to quickly leave before they were caught. \"See I told you dawgs this was a bad idea\" stated B-dawg. \"Now's not the time for rubbing it in our faces we need to go, quickly\" Buddha told his brother. But Loom, who was outside, already saw them and secretly followed them with a few black and greyish cats. Sniffer and the others were running through the woods, being led by Blaze. \"Follow me, this path has no wolves\" he said. \"Remain stealthy like a ninja, a secret spy, like Captain Megasis- \"Ok we get it you want to be a good leader!\" snapped Lark. \"Which way now?\" asked Sniffer. \"My nose can smell smoke nearby\". \"So let me get this straight, when the cop's can't do their jobs they rely on random dog's to help them\" laughed Syndero. \"Because you've been here before and know the way!\" defended the blood hound. \"So the smoke is where their camp is?\" asked Molly. Blaze and Spot nodded. \"Quickly, we must hurry, I'm not letting those cats touch those pups\" vowed Spot. \"Thanks Spot for coming a long\" thanked Buddy. Spot smiled back at him. \"Remain cautious, this is going to be dangerous\" warned Dennis. \"I've been trapped by them before so I should know\". \"Dangerous?Oh great, I knew I was gonna die\" groaned Syndero. \"Don't talk like that Syndero for I have a plan\" revealed Blaze. \"Like I said we're all gonna die\" muttered the hound.[Chapter 8] The Buddies looked around and spotted a small area, the adults had created for the younger cats to sleep in. \"Psst Phoenix\" whispered Mudbud. The female cat woke up and came over to them. \"Yo girl we got an urgent 911!\" cried B-dawg. \"What he means to say is, your elders have been lying to you they don't help the cats you bring in, they sacrifice them to this Abcat guy\" explained Rosebud. \"What are you guys- but Phoenix was cut off by the entry of Abzak and several black and grey cats surrounding the area, making everyone wake up. \"Phoenix you can drop the act, they know\" said the Siamese cat. \"Act?\" questioned Buddha. \"I'm sorry we kept this a secret from you for so long\" Abzak turned to the others. \"You see all the cats of Fernfield are spies for Oakfield, who were trying to harm you, we had choice but to throw them into the fire to save you. Dark Anthem was correct, the time of Abcat's return is upon us, we just need to do away with these spies, who have chased us up trees and tormented us for so long!\" This seemed understandable to the others, except for Luna and Phoenix. \"Phoenix well done for bringing these spies to justice and luring Anthem to that thing\" praised Abzak. \"How did he not know that we sent you out that night\". \"What?\" gasped Mudbud. \"You were just trying to get us trapped here weren't you?! I could've been killed by that ghost dude!\" \"Yo not cool\" added B-dawg. \"But I didn't know that...I mean I did but- \"Don't explain yourself to these mindless dogs\" ordered Gust. \"I thought you were our friend but it turns out you're just another selfish cat who only thinks about herself\" Mudbud insulted her, frustratingly. \"What? I didn't know the cats I bought- she didn't know how to reply, she had done the deed, yes, but she had no idea what became of the cats she bought back. Abzak did send her to \"explore\" the town with the Buddies, hoping Anthem would get them all but it backfired when Phoenix became friends with Mudbud, so the phantom attempted to make her go back to the woods before she spills anything. \"You lied to us?\" shivered one small, orange kitten. \"No we just thought...er\" Abzak was struggling to make up an excuse. \"We just thought you were to young to view such events\" Gust interrupted. \"Not to mention the flames were dangerous\" added Loom. \"But how's this, considering the time we all will go home is upon us, tonight you will see the sacrifice of these evil spies as a message to dogs that we've had enough of them chasing us?\" offered the sly leader. The others cheered. \"Take them away!\" Phoenix was overcome by guilt. She had so much evil and caused so much pain. How could I be so dumb and clueless?\" \"Phoenix you have bought Abcat a great gift I'm sure he'll be grateful\" congratulated Abzak. \"I...can't believe I cause so many cats to...\" Phoenix gasped, horrified by this revelation. The guard cats herded the Buddies towards a large rock. \"We're doomed!\" yelled B-dawg. The adult dogs made it to the camp, where they were surprised to see it empty. All except for one Pig who seemed to have gotten lost after venturing out of the farm. Sniffer was asking her for help. \"As you can tell, this mission is very important to us, especially me so that everyone will like me more\" explained the Labrador. \"Iway arecay otnay orfay ouryay attemptsway atway eingbay elevantray, utbay Iway avehay eensay ethay uppiespay ouyay eakspay, I'llway elltay ouyay ifway ouyay elltay emay owhay otay etgay omehay\" she replied in Pig Latin. \"Filthy swine\" muttered Syndero. \"Thank you for your advice, wise pig\" Blaze thanked, pretending he knew what she was on about. He turned to the others and whispered \"What did she say?\" \"She said she'll tell us where the Buddies are if we tell her how to get home!\" translated Molly, who knew Pig Latin (she was the one who taught Rosebud). \"I believe she also called you irrelevant\" added Lark, who could also speak it well. \"I will help you get home, now tell us where the pup's are\" promised Sniffer. \"Iway awsay aryscay atscay erdinghay emthay upway away igbay ockray, andway ereway ightinglay away irefay, eythay ookedlay awfullyway aredscay\" replied the pig. \"She said the Buddies have been herded up to a rock where there's a fire!\" panicked Molly. \"And also they looked scared\" whispered Lark. \"Great, now what, you gonna ask her for more details?\" asked Syndero, sarcastically. \"We have to move quickly!\" exclaimed Buddy. \"Easy, follow Blaze's plan\" Dennis advised his friend. \"Ouyay ouldway ebay away oolfay orfay ollowingfay isthay idiot'sway ansplay!\" cried the pig. \"Thank you once again for your wisdom, kind pig\" thanked Blaze, unaware of her insults, as they all ran off. Sniffer remained behind to quickly explain to her how to get home. \"Um, she said we would be fools for following an idiot like you\" Lark told him. \"Nonsense, your obviously translating it wrong\" dismissed the Labrador. On a high rock that was connected to the ground through a path going upwards, the Buddies stood right at the edge, surrounded by Abzak, Gust and Loom. Beside them was a small stray kitten that Phoenix lured in. B-dawg, who usually enjoys chasing cats, was to scared to do so. \"Yo whats up little cat?\" he greeted. \"Its ok we wont chase you\" assured Rosebud. \"Were the Buddies, who are you?\" \"I'm Lily\" she introduced herself. \"Are you strays to? Don't worry, once the cats give us medicine to protect us from diseases we can have a nice happy home in Oakfield\". \"Sorry dudette but this isn't a waiting are their gonna sacrifice us to their dead leader\" revealed Mudbud. \"What!?\" Lily cried. \"Is it just me or is it really hot up here?\" panted Budderball, sweating. \"It's supposed to be the middle of winter, now that's what I call false advertising\" sweated B-dawg. \"Its the fire below it's making us feel hot\" realised Buddha. \"Aw man I think I prefer that phantoms ice bombs to this\" admitted B-dawg. \"Hey look i can see mum and dad!\" cried a relieved Rosebud. The others looked to the crashed truck where Buddy, Molly, Blaze and Spot were waiting. They then noticed Dennis and Sniffer hiding in the pond, which would be the escape route. Lark and Syndero were going to create a diversion. \"Quiet we don't want to blow their cover\" whispered Buddha. \"Excuse me, Abzak sir, can we ask you one question\". Abzak nodded and allowed him to ask. \"Where did you ever get such nonsensical idea that if ypu sacrifice cats you will bring back your leader\". \"Yeah I don't think even Yuri was that crazy\" added Rosebud. \"Well since we're sacrificing you anyway allow me to explain\" began Abzak. \"You see it was just after we got into a brawl with other cats and animal control captured us. We were being shipped to another state so we attacked the driver... The driver lost control of the wheel and quickly jumped out of the door and ran as fast as he could, while the truck crashed into the forest, below the highway. It was thundering down and it was pitch black. Loom and the Siamese cat asked their leader to look around and Abzak agreed. He got out the car and began blindly running, so he could quickly look around and get back in the dry truck. \"HELLO ANYONE HERE?! HELP!\" he called out, hoping someone would hear his pleas. He kept on running until he slipped on the muddy ground and fell down a small hill. He got up and saw tall trees in front of him. However soon he heard a voice. \"I have been waiting for you\" it said. In front of him was a dark, barely visible figure, camouflaging himself into the dark background. A black cape could be seen flowing against the wind. \"Who are you?\" Abzak demanded. \"I was visiting this state, Washington, so I could find something\" explained the alien, pronouncing \"Washington\" incorrectly. \"I believe I can help you reclaim the alley's your were expelled from but it will take some time. Your leader, who has passed away can help\". \"Abcat? But he's.. began the cat before the figure interrupted him. \"The Ancient legends say if you can sacrifice enough of the same species as the one your trying to bring back, he or she will return. All you need to do is do it in a forest, such as this one. I suggest training the newborn kitten's into luring these cat's from the town next to this, Fernfield\". \"What do you want in return?\" \"Only that you resurrect my old friend Abcat\" lied the figure, pretending he knew their dead leader. \"Recently, a person called Dark Anthem visited me and told me of something that would speed things up\" continued Abzak. \"Try to get puppies in particular, Abcat will appreciate the sacrifice of those who always chase his kind\" urged Anthem, of course pronouncing \"puppies\" wrong too. His genius plan was to make the cat's go after the Buddies, who had ruined his plans by defeating Death in Dino buddies. However all he knew about them was that they lived in Fernfield but he didn't know what animals they were. At first he thought they were cats so he wanted Abzak to go through as many cats as possible until they got the Air buddies! Of course, after seeing the Buddies in the woods he decided to use Phoenix to lure them out, starting with Mudbud. After Abzak finished his story, the Buddies and Lily didn't know what to say. \"Wow that sounds difficult to believe\" said Rosebud. \"Like there is good there is also evil that can corrupt your minds\" Buddha told his siblings. \"You can't believe in these lies you all have a mind of your own\". \"Yeah sounds like this guy is straight up trippin\" added B-dawg. \"Nonsense he is the only one who has helped us so far this is our destiny!\" rejected the leader. He then walked down the rock to talk to Drest and the Siamese cat, who were watching over the others.[Chapter 9] Syndero and Lark prepared to create a diversion. \"See I knew I was gonna die\" groaned the hound. \"Don't worry these cats won't know what hit them, follow my lead\" assured Lark. \"I can see the puppies above the fire it looks as if their about to be sacrificed time to put Blaze's plan into action!\". \"He really needs to stop reading those Captain Canine comics\" sighed Syndero. The hound charged into the camp and straight into two opened crates of food that fell out of the truck when it crashed. \"I said wait for me you fool!\" yelled Lark, following him. \"Bet you thought you scared us of!\" \"GET OUT OF HERE DOGS YOU AND YOUR STUPID SHARP TEETH DON'T BELONG HERE!\" yelled Gust, who had quite enough of these doggy intrusions. \"I'VE HAD IT WITH THESE MINDLESS, STINKY, TOILET DRINKING DOG'S!\" \"Well why don't you come here and see how stupid they are?\" challenged Syndero. The cats began chasing them. \"Were under attack get ready to defend!\" ordered the Siamese cat. Buddy, Molly,Spot and Blaze crept towards the cats \"bedroom\" and waited for a signal. Sniffer and Dennis waited next to the pond, which was the escape route. The bloodhound howled after the younger cats were ordered to run, led by Felix. The four dogs ran up the rock. Loom and the Himalayan cat jumped Spot and Blaze. \"Buddies run!\" shouted Air bud. The Buddies and the kitten ran of the rock. The cats and dogs then began chasing one another with lots of failures. Syndero tried chasing two cats up a tree but they just threw apples at him. Lark and the others chased the cats throughout several bushes, but just got lost and even ended up attacking each other. \"Ow you fool!\" screamed Syndero, as Lark scratched him. \"Get your claws and your face out of my face!\" \"Sorry, thought you were them\" Blaze attempted to throw Loom of his back but ended up falling of the rock. \"I bet this never happened to Captain Canine!\" he wailed. Lark, the cats, the Buddies and Syndero began running from each other through the bushes, failing to catch one another. Meanwhile, the younger cats with Felix were taken to a nearby cave. \"Do not fear Abcat will save us!\" Felix tried calming them down. But Phoenix and Luna didn't believe this. \"Felix, sir, I don't think having our leader back justifies sacrificing the lives of so many innocent young animal's\" Luna spoke up. \"What? Those dogs have led others here they need to pay!\" Felix retorted. \"But that's only because we bought them here the Buddies have treated us fairly and nicely unlike other dogs who would have chased us up a tree\" Phoenix told him. A few other cats agreed while the rest didn't know what to say. After a while Felix said \"What do you mean 'we' bought them here? You spotted them first and told the rest of us just like you lured so many cat's here; you are one of our top spies, so there is no way your not jumping out of the plane with the rest of the us!\" \"What plane?\" said a confused cat. \"Its an expression!\" Phoenix cried, knowing what he was saying was all right, but she didn't know what would really happen to the stray's she bought here. But she couldn't let Mudbud and the other's be captured and thrown into the fire by Abzak. The Buddies looked around for Lily but couldn't see her. \"Dudes wheres Lily!\" noticed Mudbud. \"Maybe she made it out\" hoped Budderball. \"I hope we are also as lucky because we'v got company\" said Buddha spotting the Siamese cat and two black cats approaching them. \"Aw man it just doesn't stop!\" whined B-dawg. \"RUN!\" As the Buddies ran Mudbud stopped and saw Lily being captured by Abzak and heading back up the rock. \"Hold on dudette i'm coming\" Mudbud announced, running after them. The other Buddies hid inside the truck as the cats surrounded it. \"Ha how are you gonna get out this time?\" laughed the Siamese cat. \"I hate to say it but he's right!\" wailed Rosebud. \"Remember what Talon said sometimes life leads you where you least expect\" remembered Buddha, as that gave him an idea. \"Cover your noses everyone!\". He went to Budderball and pulled his paw, causing him to let out a stinky fart. The cats shrieked and jumped into the pond. \"HELP I CANT SWIM!\"screamed the Siamese cat. \"Aw sick!\" complained B-dawg. \"Aw shucks\" Budderball blushed out of embarrassment. \"Well at least it got us out of a jam\" Buddha tried to stay positive, as usual. \"That's good but lets get out of this stinky truck!\" said Rosebud, jumping out through the smashed window. Syndero, Blaze and Spot were surrounded by the Loom and the other cats. \"Oh boy we're doomed\" declared Syndero. \"You will all die in cast\" laughed Loom. \"I've always wondered what that meant\" said Syndero. \"The cast to die\" repeated Loom. Syndero nodded to Blaze, now understanding what that saying meant. \"You mean die a hero's death\" Blaze proclaimed. \"Unfortunately we would probably be viewed as the bad guys for trespassing and attacking weaker species so no being a hero for you, Blaze\" whispered Spot. \"I'm a hero everyone, a hero! History will vindicate me!\" yelled Blaze. Spot then noticed Gust near the fire about to scratch Air bud, who was helping his mate up. \"Buddy, watch out!\" he yelled. The dalmatian dodged Loom and went in front of Buddy, taking the scratch from Gust instead. He quickly kicked the black cat into the flames. \"Spot you saved my life, thank you\" thanked a grateful Air bud.[Chapter 10] Felix looked over to Phoenix who still looked upset. \"Look i'm sorry, Phoenix, I didn't mean to make you upset I was just angry\" apologised Felix, before he went to the front of the cave to think. \"Luna I can't let the Buddies join the other stray's i'm going to help them\" she whispered to Luna. \"I'm going with you no way am I letting my new BF's down\" said Luna. \"It's gonna be dangerous I think you should stay\". \"Have I ever listened to you before?\" Phoenix smiled at her friend and the two ran back to the camp. \"Sir should we stop them they could get hurt?\" Midnight asked Felix. \"No let them go\" said Felix before deciding something. \"Midnight I've told you the way to Oakfield you know the way well right?\" \"Know it of by heart\" replied the female cat. \"Good now listen take all of these cats and go back there tell the cat's in the alley that we sent you back to live like them. They wont harm you as you weren't with us when it all happened\" instructed Felix. \"Hopefully, they will be kind enough to offer a bit of a empathy to you and take you in\". \"Are you sure? What about you?\" \"Yes that is an order! All cats follow Midnight!\" ordered Felix. As the others scrambled, Felix remained sat with his head down. Mudbud ran up the rock. \"Quick Lily run!\" he told the kitten. When Abzak turned around, Lily ran as fast as she could but the tough leader grabbed her and put her at the edge of the rock. \"Dude why are you doing this you know your leader will never come back?\" said Mudbud. \"Because this is the only way we can return to our lives as you can already tell we are not pets we have no owners to play with! Phoenix and the other young cats dream of being like normal pets but that won't happen all that matters is my vision!\" yelled the enraged Abzak. Mudbud tried arguing with him but Abzak would hear none of it. \"A puppy is also needed for this ritual\" remembered Abzak. He began chasing Mudbud around the rock while Lily was at the edge, she was too petrified to move. Rosebud and Budderball, meanwhile, where being chased by the Drest. He finally caught them near some trees. \"I'v got you cornered!\" he praised himself. Suddenly a few apples hit him on the head. It was Luna, she jumped of the tree and joined them. \"Hey BF its time for you pups to go home\" she told Rosebud. \"Thanks Luna\" smiled Rosebud. Back on the rock, Abzak charged towards Mudbud but Phoenix got in the way causing her to be scratched by his sharp claws. Loom and Drest ran up to join help Abzak. \"OW!\" she shrieked. Abzak backed of a bit. \"Phoenix are you ok?\" asked the worried puppy. \"I...i'm fine\" she panted. Dark Anthem teleported to a nearby hill and took our his blaster. He shot at the rock causing it to begin cracking. Abzak looked up and saw the silhouette of the shadowy alien. \"Phoenix, you are my greatest student, i'll let you sacrifice these two and you can finally live like a normal pet like you always wanted\" Abzak told her. \"I'm sorry, Abzak, but I have already caused too many lives to be lost i'm not going do it again!\" she rejected. \"WHAT? TREASON!\" screamed the fierce cat. \"I'LL DO IT MYSELF!\" Abzak rushed towards Lily and prepared to throw her in. He was unaware that the edge of the rock, where he was standing, was also cracking. \"I need to go help that kitten, Mudbud you stay here in case the rock cracks\" instructed Phoenix. \"Wait, dudette, say if the rock cracks your'll fall into the fire\" realised Mudbud. \"Either way, at least my conscious will be clear\" she replied. Her guilty conscious was beginning effect her. \"But you didn't know what was happening!\" he tried convincing her. \"I just want to say one thing\" the tiger cat began. \"Thank you for showing me how to be a normal pet and I hope you and your siblings make it out\". She ran towards the helpless kitten followed by Abzak. \"EXTINCTION TO ALL TRAITORS!\" he yelled. Unknown to him, the spy bug which Anthem attached to his spiked collar when he appeared to him, was still active and Anthem was watching. Phoenix protected Lily and Mudbud ran after his friend. Dark Anthem appeared on the hill top above and targeted the rock with his blaster. Firing, his blasts also shot a tree standing nearby which fell and collided with the crumbling rock. The tree dangled down the edge of the rock and Abzak, Lily and Phoenix were desperately trying to climb up as it began falling. Mudbud quickly ran towards the edge and tried grabbing Phoenix. Lily was being pulled down by Abzak, who grabbed her by the leg. Phoenix began going lower, instead of heading up, to help the poor kitten. \"Hold on, I got you\" promised Phoenix, grabbing Lily by her paw. Abzak and Drest began climbing up, heading right behind them. \"How did this happen?\" Abzak asked himself. \"But Abcat was supposed to return but did...maybe Anthem was... Abzak then began thinking that maybe the evil alien was manipulating him all this time and wanted this to happen. For Anthem- Drex's commander, missing in action- he didn't care about the cats or the humans or even how much animals were killed. He just wanted the Air Buddies gone so he could exact his revenge for what they caused by defeating the shadowy phantom in Dino buddies. Realising everything was a lie, Abzak let go of the tree and fell into the flames below. Drest paid no attention and continued advancing. \"Don't worry, Phoenix I'll help you\" Mudbud assured her. \"Mudbud forget about me run the rock is collapsing!\" demanded the female cat. \"Dudette have you gone crazy? I can't let you fall!\" he disagreed. \"Listen I can never escape from the thought that I caused lots of pain but I can at least try to save you all...let go\" Phoenix begged him. \"Phoenix are you crazy, quickly climb up I can get get you out of here!\" pleaded Mudbud. She looked two inches beneath her to see the angry Himalayan cat ready to attack. \"Hold on\" she instructed Lily, placing her paw onto the trunk. She then let go and began falling, striking her claws into the evil Drest, who fell down as well. \"Ahhh!\" he wailed as he bashed his head against the branches and fell into Loom. Mudbud quickly pulled Lily up. Dark Anthem teleported to a nearby cliff to watch. Mudbud lay down and watched the poor cat fall into the flames and remembering what he had said to her about being no better than Abzak. Anthem, instead of feeling happy, was shocked at what he was seeing. A few tears came out of Mudbud's guilty eyes and Anthem looked over to the upset puppy. \"Its a pity the puppies are still alive but...I leave knowing at least I achieved some victory\" he cackled before vanishing. Mudbud didn't move as the rock was cracking but he could hear the voices of the others. The cats all fled. \"Wheres Mudbud?\" asked Molly. \"Ah it scratched my eye!\" screamed Syndero. \"Dawg's, there he is on the rock it looks like its breaking!\" noticed B-dawg. \"We need to go get him!\" panicked Buddy. \"Go on then!\" retorted the hound. \"I''ll go save him\" offered Blaze. \"Wait for the police!\" said Sniffer. \"DON'T WORRY MUDBUD WERE COMING!\" The next morning, the Buddies were enjoying themselves playing happily, like puppies should be, in the park. Dennis was, surprisingly, playing with them. Budderball, Buddha, Rosebud and B-dawg were playing football while Spot was talking to Buddy and Molly. It seemed like the Dalmatian and the sports playing dog had decided to mend their severed friendship. As for Blaze, after hearing about what happened, everyone was finally treating him like the hero he always wanted to be. \"I told you one day it would happen\" he told Syndero. \"Yo check it, Spot and dad are friend's again!\" spotted B-dawg. \"Their like BFF'S\" laughed Rosebud. \"I hope my new BF, Luna, is ok\". \"Well who's up for another match?\" asked an enthusiastic Dennis. The Buddies barked in excitement and continued playing. Lark and Syndero were standing next to the entrance of the woods. Out of respect for the cats and the stray's that had died there, Deputy Sniffer told all of the animals in Fernfield that the \"new area\" of the woods was condemned. \"I'm glad this ordeal is finally over\" recapped Lark. \"Yeah whatever\" ignored the hound. \"Too bad we couldn't help the cats too\" sighed the English Mastiff. \"I er...hope they made it back to Oakfield\" admitted Syndero. \"They deserve to live normally, like us\". Rosebud kicked the football past Budderball and it went in the goal. \"GOOOOAAAAALLLL!\" she yelled, sliding on the grass. \"Huh?\" She then noticed Mudbud laying by himself next to a tree. He looked sad. \"Hey Buddha I think we should go talk to Mudbud, he still seems upset\" suggested Rosebud. \"I concur\" agreed the Zen pup. They went over to him. Mudbud still had the pretty flower Phoenix gave him in his mouth. He placed it on the rock beside him. \"Hey Mudbud are you still sad about Phoenix?\" asked Rosebud, although she already knew the answer. Mudbud didn't reply. \"She had a conscious, like all of us, and when she did something bad she couldn't live with herself but i'm sure she didn't want you to be sad\" explained the wise Buddha. \"But she just wanted to be like a normal pet...they all did\" sulked the dirty puppy. \"She trusted me to help her live like us and I just said a lot of bad things to her that I wish I could take back\". \"I know Mudbud don't worry i'm sure they all returned to Oakfield, safely\" Rosebud assured him. \"Hey I think I see some fresh dirt over by the goal!\". \"Yeah come on let's get you back in to your usual self\" added Buddha. After a few seconds, Mudbud got up and replied \"Alright dude that sounds like a gnarly idea!\" The three puppies ran to the others and they all played football together, cheering Mudbud up. On the rock the flower Phoenix gave Mudbud was still there, laying in the position he had placed it and while they were playing the puppies couldn't help but to stare and smile at the gift. The end (Yeah I know the ending is kinda sad)[Chapter 11] B-dawg sat just outside the sign that said \"Welcome to Fernfield\" looking at the highway, strangely missing his bling. Beside him was the black cat, Midnight, who was telling him everything that happened. Mudbud soon joined them. \"That was nice of those dawg's...I mean cat's...to let you stay\" said B-dawg. \"Yep, most of us have found homes now\" she replied. \"I'm still in the market though\". \"Hey dude...and dudette\" greeted Mudbud in his usual way. \"Sorry, bro, still no sign of your bling\". \"Aw nuts!\" cursed B-dawg. \"Something wrong?\" asked Midnight. \"Yeah, it's my bling, it's been stolen by some crooks!\" he explained, upset. A familiar looking jeep drove past, it's drivers were none other than Denning, Selkirk Tander's employee, and his idiot companion, Grim. \"Hey how much do you think this bling is worth?\" asked Denning. \"The bling of an Air bud puppy? Probably a lot!\" cried Grim. \"They stole my bling!\" realised B-dawg, preparing to chase the car out of Fernfield. \"B-dawg, don't\" warned Mudbud. But it was to late, the rebellious pup ran out into the highway after the jeep. Mudbud sighed. \"Here we go again\" he muttered. \"Looks like you lot have another adventure\" joked Midnight. \"Looks like it\" replied Mudbud. \"Wait up bro!\" Mudbud chased after his brother as the two left for yet another crazy day, as Midnight watched them. ","Summary":" Six year's before Santa buddies It was a different night from those which came before. A newspaper "},{"Movie":"Air Bud","Title":"Air buddies mini series","Author":"ZVX1245","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12402178","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I'v decided to create a few short stories about the Air Buddies. This one takes place a week before Spooky Buddies. BTW I don't own any of the character's. In Fernfield, Washington, the five Air Buddies were playing outside the Town hall with Deputy Sniffer. Budderball, the big pup who's always hungry, lunged at a pumpkin to eat it but he accidentally squashed it. \"Oh man, I can't believe we have to wait a whole week before we get free candy\" he groaned. \"To much candy is not good for you, Budderball, all that sugar can rott your teeth\" advised Buddha, the Zen pup and the content one. There was Halloween decorations scattered around the Town hall as people were getting ready for Halloween. \"Yo, these decorations are kinda creepy, dawg's\" whispered B-dawg, the cool pup who is easily frightened (although he pretends he's not). \"Don't tell me your a scaredy cat, B-dawg\" teased Rosebud, the youngest and only girl of the litter. \"Me scared?\" B-dawg quickly denied. \"Pshaw, B-dawg ain't scared of nothing, that's fo' shizzle!\" \"Chillax dude, Halloween is just for fun, ghosts and monsters don't really exist\" said Mudbud, the dirty one who likes to \"hang loose\". \"Well, Mudbud, I guess you haven't heard the story of the Halloween hound\" interrupted Sniffer. The Buddies shook their heads in response. \"Can you please tell us this story?\" pleaded Buddha. \"Well how can I resist your cute little face?\" chortled Sniffer. \"Just checking is this a scary story?\" whimpered B-dawg. Sniffer nodded and began his story. \"Well my grandfather used to tell me this story when I was just a pup, you see it was late at night in the year 1937... When Sniffer finished, B-dawg was hiding next to Buddha, the only one who doesn't laugh at him when he gets scared. \"Whoa that does sound kinda scary\" admitted Budderball. \"Why would someone want to eat souls, not even I would do that!\" \"Wow-za's that Halloween Hound sound's like one evil dude\" agreed Mudbud. \"And the manor is still there, filled with Warwick's evil stuff\" added Sniffer. \"I advise you pup's never to even try and get in there\". \"Y-you don't n-need to tell me twice\" shivered B-dawg. Later the other Buddies heard Rosebud's howl and went to meet her outside the gates of Warwick's manor. \"Er dudette why'd you call us out here?\" asked Mudbud. \"Lets go look at the manor from the outside\" Rosebud urged them. \"D-do we have to, Sniffer said that place is condemned\" said B-dawg, nervously. \"But we won't be going INSIDE were'll just look at it from outside\" replied Rosebud. \"We must respect and obey the rules of the town\" stated Buddha but he too wanted to see it up close. \"Although no one said we can't sit OUTSIDE\". The Buddies ran past the gates and stopped when they were close to the manor. There was an old tree with a owl perched on a branch. The manor looked old and creepy with cobwebs everywhere. The doors were boarded up. \"Ok we looked, now let's go\" pleaded B-dawg. \"The school is taking our kids to see this as part of the Fernfield spooky sights trip next week\" stated Buddha. \"Well I can't wait for the spooky party at night, there's gonna be so much treats\" drooled Budderball. \"I heared some sick band is gonna be playing I bet i'm gonna drop some mad moves to that\" boasted B-dawg. Just then, a black cat came out from behind the bushes and hissed at them. \"Hey its a cat!\" spied Mudbud. \"and he's making rude faces at me, hey watch this dude's and dudette\". Mudbud began chasing the cat behind the manor. The cat ran up a tree and Mudbud tried following him. \"Try getting me up here you fool if you fall your'll land in the mud!\" taunted the cat. But Mudbud didn't mind falling in dirt. \"Well that's even better!\" he cheered trying to climb the tree. The cat jumped down,landing in the mad and shrieked. \"Now look what you made me do!\" he yelled before running of. Budderball came up behind him to watch. \"What's wrong with a dirt roll\" laughed Mudbud. \"Good job, Mudbud!\" Budderball congratulated his brother. \"I just hope we don't get bad luck from this cat\" chortled Mudbud. Meanwhile at the front of the manor, the other three were going on to the floorboards, making them creak. \"Rosebud, girl, what are you doing?\" asked B-dawg. \"Look there's a tiny hole in the wooden planks\" noticed Rosebud. \"I'm guessing bugs must've chewed through that, causing a small hole to appear\" guessed Buddha. Buddha peered in through the hole and could only see a small corner of carpet. However he soon spotted a glowing spot appearing. \"Huh that's funny I can see a glowing, light thing\" he told the other two. \"Maybe it's a g-g-ghost!\" cried B-dawg. \"Don't be silly, there's no such thing as ghosts\" Rosebud assured him. Hoot, the owl, then flew down to look inside, thinking it was his master returning. This startled B-dawg who fell straight into the small hole. \"My nose is stuck\" he coughed. \"Get me out of here!\" Budderball and Mudbud returned and they all grabbed hold of his tail and pulled him out. However this caused the hole to get bigger, enough for a puppy to crawl through. \"Ok I think that's enough adventuring for one day\" decided Buddha. \"Yeah it looks like its nearly time for our kids to come back from school\" agreed Budderball. \"How do you know that, dude?\" asked a curious Mudbud. \"I always know when its nearly dinner time\" replied Budderball. \"Well see you boy's tomorrow, Alice bought me a Halloween outfit I can't wait to see it!\" said and excited Rosebud, before she turned to B-dawg. \"Try not to have nightmare's about this\". \"Relax sis when have I ever had nightmares?\" B-dawg rhetorically asked. The other puppies began chortling, remembering the times when they lived together. The Buddies ran back to their homes, after another fun adventure. The end[Chapter 2] Quickly I would like to thank a user called Bluewolfbat who sent me a list of ideas for a Air buddies fanfic and I chose one which was really good so most of the plot was his idea. It was a few days before Halloween and Noah and Air bud had been invited to a basketball tournament in another city so the Buddies stopped by their old home to see their famous dad before he left for a week. When Mr. Framm left for work and Noah went to school, the Buddies went through one of their old secret entrance, the cellar to get in the house and met Air bud. \"Huh you knew we'd come in this way?\" asked a confused Buddha. \"You forget you used to live here and you ALWAYS used this way to get out of the house when you were in trouble especially you Mudbud\" stated Buddy looking at his mischievous son. \"Fo' sizzle dawg, Mudbud always got in trouble especially when it rains, he's a repeat offender\" added B-dawg. \"Such a shame you won't be here for Halloween\" sighed Budderball. \"Its also such a shame we won't be able to see our kids spooky Fernfield tour next week\" said Rosebud. \"Well i'm gonna go tell your mum that your here it will only take a minute\" Buddy told them before he ran out. After a while the Buddies got board and B-dawg eventually said \"Lets go do something fun this is boring!\" The others agreed and they found themselves mucking around outside a large room. \"Dudes lets check this place out\" suggested Mudbud. The buddies entered and looked around. There was furniture everywhere, all wrapped up in white cloth. It was about to be painted so white cloth was placed over everything to stop it from getting wet. \"Whats going on here?\" wondered Rosebud. \"They look like giant marshmallows!\" drooled Budderball. Air bud and Molly then appeared. \"Dad whats going on here?\" asked a confused Buddha. \"Yeah you dawgs getting ready for Halloween or something?\" said B-dawg. \"Well no in fact this room is getting painted before we leave for a week\" explained Buddy. Molly then began giggling. \"Oh Buddy why don't you tell them about what you did to this room when you first moved in?\" \"Whats mum talking about dad?\" asked Rosebud. \"Yeah tell us please!\" pleaded Mudbud. Buddy then explained how, when he first moved in with the Framm family, they were painting this room. However he ruined it by getting all tangled up in the bed sheets and then causing the paint to spill everywhere, making even more mess. After he told the story the Buddies burst out laughing, uncontrollably. \"Hey I think mum should put one of these sheets on her for Halloween she'll look like a ghost then\" chortled Mudbud trying to scare everyone. \"These things do look like ghosts watch out their going to get you!\" \"G-g-ghosts!\" stammered B-dawg, running behind Buddy. \"B-dawg don't be a fraidy cat ghosts aren't real\" jeered Rosebud. Suddenly the wind pushed against the cloth on the sofa, causing it to start blowing. Rosebud screamed and ran behind Molly. \"Ha now look who's the fraidy cat, the so-called fearless Rosebud\" taunted B-dawg. The others looked at the blowing cloth and shivered. \"Ah is that the Halloween Hound?!\" shivered Budderball. \"Relax the Halloween Hound is just a legend\" Buddy assured them. \"Ghosts don't exist anyway\". \"Yeah I knew that dawg\" lied B-dawg. \"Thanks for the scare Mudbud\" Rosebud sarcastically huffed. \"What are brothers for?\" he jokingly replied. With Noah and his family gone the house was completely empty and locked up so no human anyway can get in. The Buddies however, who haven't been in the house for years and wanted to go for a sleep over, decided to sneak out and spend the night there. When they got in through the cellar they saw the entire house was dark and everything was silent. \"Yo dawgs I think i'm gonna bounce you know Billy might just wake up or something\" stammered B-dawg. \"What a chicken\" chortled Rosebud. \"Seriously sis? You seem to have forgotten how much you screamed the other day when we went in that room with white cloth\" stated Buddha. Budderball raced towards the kitchen and spotted opened the cupboards, only to see nothing but a few bread pieces. \"What come on!\" he whined. \"They didn't leave anything\"!. \"Who cares about eating lets check out our sweet room\" urged Mudbud. \"You mean what used to be our room\" said Rosebud. The Buddies ran up the stairs and to their room. A few stuff was still there such as the picture of Noah and the Buddies and Rosebud's football poster. \"Hey they kept our bed\" noticed Buddha, going towards the bed which they used to sleep in. \"So now we just go to sleep?\" asked Budderball. \"No way dawg its a slumber party do you know what slumber means?\" B-dawg rhetorically replied. \"I'v got a totally rad idea lets go check out that room again I cant stop thinking about it since we saw it\" pleaded Mudbud. Rosebud agreed. \"On second thought maybe we should go to sleep\" B-dawg quickly changed his mind, contracting what he said earlier. Suddenly the strong wind pushed the window open and the branches of trees scraped against the house making creepy noises. The Buddies stopped and huddled together. \"I changed my mind again lets go down stairs, NOW\" whimpered B-dawg. The others followed their scared brother down the stairs and noticed that the room being painted was left open. Molly meanwhile decided to check up on her pups and went next door. However the wind caused her to fall back into the wall, causing a loud thud. \"W-what was that?\" Budderball quietly asked. \"Ooh its a scary ghost! It's coming to get you!\" Mudbud tried scaring everyone. \"Mudbud cut it out!\" demanded Rosebud. \"I second that. Ghosts are not real, like dad said, and stuff which do go up are just souls leaving a dead body\" added Buddha. \"Ok lets split up and look around\" suggested Rosebud. \"Split up?! Are you trippin, sis?\" snapped B-dawg. \"The ones with the shiny stuff are ALWAYS picked of first!\". \"Then take your bling of\". \"No way me and my bling never separate\". \"Well were about to, you can go with Mudbud\" said Rosebud. Budderball decided to \"search\" in the kitchen while Buddha and Rosebud went downstairs. Mudbud and B-dawg were right outside the room being painted. \"Ok dude you first\" said Mudbud. B-dawg nervously walked in followed by his dirty brother. They both looked around at the cloth on furniture. \"See nothing here now let's go!\" demanded B-dawg. Molly was walking through the garden to try and get in using the window and she decided to knock on it, hoping the pups will let her in. Rosebud turned around and saw the shadow of her mum through the glass. She screamed and hid behind Buddha. \"Calm yourself Rosebud\" started Buddha before he to noticed the shadow. Budderball meanwhile was devouring a few cookies he had found. He jumped down from the table and went over to the others. \"Er guys why are just standing still?\" he asked before noticing the shadow. \"Ah its the Halloween hound run!\" They ran upstairs while B-dawg and Mudbud were in the room with the cloths. \"Hmm looks like the Framm's forgot to close this window\" noticed B-dawg looking at the open window on the top left of the room. While he was walking the fierce wind pushed the cloths everywhere and one fell right on top of him. \"Hey who turned out the lights I hate the dark!\" he wailed. Mudbud turned around and saw, what he thought, was a ghost! \"AHH A GHOST!\" he yelled. Molly, meanwhile, had gotten in through this open window. \"Wait where's B-dawg?\" asked a concerned Rosebud. \"I dunno I think the ghost dude got him!\" feared Mudbud. \"Are you sure you weren't just pranking him?\" glared Buddha. \"No way dude!\" denied Mudbud.[Chapter 3] Molly walked into the room and saw the cloths everywhere. \"Hmm it seems they'v been in here\" she guessed. However as she was walking the fierce wind was once again causing stuff to fly everywhere including a cloth, which landed right on Molly. Meanwhile the Buddies were discussing what to do upstairs. \"I don't think it was a ghost it was in the shape of a puppy\" realised Mudbud. \"Maybe the g-ghost has possessed B-dawg!\" feared Budderball. \"Aw man this is all my fault!\" sulked Mudbud. \"Shh guys do you here that?\" whispered Rosebud. The puppies started walking back until they were at the end of the room and huddled together as B-dawg began walking up the stairs, bumping into the walls \"Ouch!\" he moaned. \"Did you hear that it sounded like ghost moaning?\" yelped Budderball. \"Let's try to be little more rationale, i'm sure that was just the wind\" suggested Buddha. B-dawg came into the room with the cloth still over him. The other four Buddies screamed and ran down the stairs followed by B-dawg. \"It's right behind me!\" yelled Budderball who accidentally bumped into the table. Buddha and Rosebud climbed up a table and stayed there. B-dawg, who was running blindly, bumped into the table legs causing it to wobble. The cloth came of him and Rosebud and Buddha had tumbled of and landed on top of their brother. \"Ah I got a bad headache\" he moaned. Buddha and Rosebud tumbled of the table, with the sheet,and fell onto him. \"B-dawg your alive!\" cheered Mudbud. \"Of course I am dawgs, nice to see I was missed\" replied B-dawg. \"But where's the ghost?\" asked Budderball. They all turned around to see Molly with the sheet covering her and screamed. All five puppies turned to run but Budderball had run into the table cloth, covering the table, and got tangled in it. \"Get this ghost of of me!\" he shouted falling into the others. Soon the cloth had covered them all. Molly took the sheet of and saw her pup's screaming and tangled up in the table cloth. After she freed them they went back into the room being painted to put the cloths back. \"Now whats been going on?\" asked Molly. \"There was a ghost which scared us all and tried to possess us!\" Rosebud quickly explained. \"Buddies you know ghosts don't exist that was just me, I was tangled up in that cloth replied Molly. \"Were really sorry about all the mess we'v made\" apologised Buddha. \"Yeah and someone really needs to close that window\" added Budderball. \"I wasn't scared I was just practising my voice\" lied B-dawg. \"Ok dude's but you gotta admit that was awesome!\" shouted Mudbud. \"Mudbud we could have all gotten hurt!\" snapped Rosebud. As they turned to go out the wind once again blew the cloths of, one of which landed on Mudbud. \"AH HELP THE GHOST'S GOT ME!\" he screamed. Molly helped him out. \"Now Mudbud is there something you need to say to the others?\" Molly rhetorically asked the youngest boy of the Buddies. \"I'm sorry dudes and dudette i'm never gonna joke about ghost's again\" apologised the dirty puppy. \"And B-dawg sorry for pranking you before\". \"Pshaw dawg, B-dawg loves practical jokes but yeah I was never really scared\" pretended B-dawg. \"I sure hope Halloween wont be like this\" hoped Budderball. \"I don't want something like this to get in the way of my trick-or-treating\". \"Relax what could possible happen?\" laughed Rosebud The end[Chapter 4] Crossover: Shasta gets a visit by Rick Sanchez , who wants to test out his new thought reading helmet. Shasta offers to test it out for him and can't help but to find out what one particular female golden retriever thought of him. Shasta was sitting alone on the edge of a icey cliff, next to a freezing cold sea that stretched out for miles. He was watching , thinking Talon, his teacher, might be out so he could see him and thank him, for if it wasn't for him he would've lost the annual Ferntiuktuk dog sled race. But,despite his accomplishment; his victory; achieving his and Adam's goal and helping his friends get home he still felt...empty and sad but he didn't know why. Suddenly a loud buzzing noise was heard from behind him, followed by green glows. It was Rick Sanchez. \"Oh great, there's someone here\" he grumbled, before drinking the rest of his \"drink\". Once he finished, he let out a burp and then hurled the empty bottle into the sea. \"Hey Rick\" Shasta replied, frowning. He didn't bother turning around, he knew it was Rick and Rick was just...well...Rick. \"Finally win your stupid dog sled race?\" asked Rick, rudely. \"Yeah...\" Shasta simply replied, not really wanting to engage in a conversation with Rick at the moment. \"Well I guess this means in an alternate dimension you lose the race, or maybe in another one you die in the race, I dunno the possibilities are endless\" listed Rick. \"Thanks for ruining the moment\" the husky pup sarcastically replied. \"I don't want to be the master of the obvious but it er kinda looks like your feeling pretty dull so I guess that would mean the moments already been ruined\" stated Rick, reaching into a pocket and taking out a small metal device that could fit on ones head. \"I just came here to find a nice, quiet place where I can test out my feeling sensor, it just you know tells you the feelings of other people (or in your case animals) you encounter and how they particularly feel towards you. So you might want to stand back in case I get angry at someone because of what they think of me, cause I notice their hypocrisy, and have the urge to shoot my plasma ray at something. Not that I really care what happens to you, I just really don't want the council of Ricks to be on my back right now\". \"Still hate you?\" asked Shasta. \"Yep, trust me their as arrogant as that Jean George guy you told me about\" answered Rick. Shasta was feeling blue but there was one thing that he had noticed about one particular member of the Air buddies that he met, and he couldn't help but to keep thinking of that. A thought that he couldn't shake off. And Rick just happened to be here so maybe... \"Hey is it ok if I test it out for you?\" asked Shasta, finally turning around. However, he soon noticed the size of the device would be an issue. \"Oh wait that's to big to fit my small head, do you have a smaller one?\" \"No need, this device takes the head shape of any skull it's placed on, regardless if you have big ears like you do\" said Rick. \"And that's a yes by the way- you can test it. But if you die and I need to summon your spirit before the Council of Ricks to testify that this was in no way my fault,I'm gonna need you to say that you wanted this\". \"How could you possibly think that I wouldn't do that?\" smirked Shasta. \"Urrgh, see this is one of the reasons I like you\" said Rick, placing the metal device on his head. It took the shape of the small husky's head and the began to glow green. \"That means it's working. Still haven't come up with a name for it though\". \"Now what?\" asked Shasta. \"Just say who's thoughts you want to see and close your eyes\" explained Rick, as he sat down on the edge of the cliff, taking out another bottle of his \"drink\". \"I want to see...\" Shasta was a bit nervous of saying it because Rick was literally right next to him. \"I want to...know what Rosebud thinks of me\". \"Oh so you finally found a girl?\" laughed Rick, before he put the bottle to his lips. Shasta saw the moment he first encountered the Buddies and when Rosebud introduced them to him. \"Shasta is so dreamy\" she dreamily thought. \"Those blue eyes of his are mesmerising, and he's such a fearless leader...kinda like me\". The husky continued to see the different moments he and Rosebud were together (such as the moment he was running with Rosebud at the front of the team) and heard how she considered him to \"be courageous\" when he had to crawl onto the cracking ice to save Jean George's dogs. He also began to hear her empathy for him for not having any parents, and constantly being alone when Adam was gone. Rick continued to drink, although he could easily watch what Shasta was viewing from his wrist watch, that was connected to his latest invention. Soon, Shasta saw something that was really sad for him to watch. How much Rosebud missed him upon returning to Fernfield. She felt as empty and blue as he did and she too was thinking about him and it seemed she began to doubt that Shasta actually liked her back and wishing he would've said something to her. Even Rick, who couldn't help but to watch this part, had to admit that this was depressing to watch. \"Jeez and I thought Dawn of the Dragon was depressing\" groaned Rick, throwing another empty bottle into the ocean. \"Rick...can you take it off now?\" begged the husky. Rick complied, not really caring about what he saw. \"At least I know it works\". A few tears built up in Shasta's eyes. I should've said something he regretted. \"Wow...I am a terrible and stupid dog for doing that\" cursed Shasta, as more tears rolled of his fur and hit the ground. This time it was Rick who didn't turn around. \"Yeah?\" he replied, refusing to turn. \"You and me both...except, you know, I'm not a dog\".[Chapter 5] Air buddies meets the boo brothers: I know I haven't been making a lot of chapter on the story right now but I need to go back and watch Scooby doo meets the boo brothers again so I know the dialogue and I have forgotten some of the stuff which happens so sorry about the wait. Dude vs Dawg B-dawg is jealous that everyone thinks Mudbud is more cooler than him. B-dawg is the second oldest of the Air Buddies. He loves dancing, rapping, music and being cool. He also likes showing of how cool he can be and often boasts about stuff. However he can't hide the fact that he gets scared very easily. In his house Billy, his owner, was getting ready for school. \"Yo B-dawg I gotta go now here i'll leave some new music I bought on so you can bust some moves\" Billy told him before leaving. \"All right let's see what sick music is on\" B-dawg said to himself. The boom box played \"Worst day ever\" by the band, Simple plan. \"All right, well I wouldn't say today is my worst day ever, but I love this music\" he announced before he started to dance. Mudbud is the youngest boy of the litter and, unlike B-dawg, prefers to be cool in a different way. He likes mucking around in the mud and uses a bit of slang when he talks, a bit similar to B-dawg. Mudbud also doesn't like stressing over small problems, instead preferring to \"hang loose\". Before school started, the puppy and his owner, Pete, were playing volleyball outside. The bus horn beeped. \"Bye Mudbud, see you after school\" Pete waved to his golden retriever before running to the bus. \"Better go meet my squad at the park, don't wanna be late\" the mucky pup told himself. To his surprise he found them outside the bakery. \"Hey dudes and dudette why are you here?\" he asked. \"Look at the sign on the glass\" said Budderball. The sign read \"Free pasty samples\". \"Oh sweet mamma, pastries!\" \"We'll need to be quick and quiet\" Buddha told the others. \"Nah i'm an expert on begging for treats\" Budderball assured him. He waited for someone to open the door and he ran inside. The big pup went up to the man holding a tray of pastries and did his begging look. \"Aw that's so cute!\" shouted the man. \"You want these?\" Budderball barked. The man gave him three which he put in his mouth and took to the others. \"Wow they actually do look nice\" admitted Rosebud. Just then an adult German shepherd dog ran past and grabbed all three of them. It was Cyclone, a mean dog who bullies the Buddies because he is jealous of Air bud. \"That looked like Cyclone!\" noticed Buddha. \"It's go time now, dawgs\" announced B-dawg. \"He's probably heading to the alley near the pet shop!\" guessed Rosebud. \"Lets split up. Buddha, Budderball and B-dawg try to chase him\" \"What about me, dudette?\" asked Mudbud. \"You and me will take the shortcut and try and beat him to the alley. I think the youngest should stick together for this one\" she replied. \"No problem-o, sis\" he agreed. Budderball and his group were behind Cyclone who was running towards the hair cut shop. \"I can smell the pastry's, near the haircut shop\" realised Budderball. \"The hair cut shop? Uh-oh the others are going the wrong way\" said B-dawg. \"Don't worry fate will lead them to the right way\" said Buddha, the spiritual one. They ran to the hair cut shop where Cyclone was with his friend Roar, a hound. \"Look what I stole from those Air bud puppies\" gloated Cyclone. \"Yuck I hate pastry's!\" retorted Roar. \"Oh well I don't want them\" said Cyclone. \"Here, pipsqueaks, you can have them back. \"That chase was of the chain yo i'v never ran as fast as that, apart from in Alaska\" commented B-dawg. \"Jeez you talk a lot of slang\" noted Roar. \"Yep him and Mudbud use it a lot\" agreed Buddha. \"Mudbud? Well yeah but I do it better\" boasted B-dawg. This gave Cyclone an idea. \"Are you kidding? Mudbud's way cooler than this one\" he laughed. \"Right Roar\" \"Whats wrong with you?\" began the confused hound before realising his crafty plan. \"Oh yeah the way he uses slang is much better at least we can understand him\" \"WHAT!?\" shouted B-dawg. \"You gots to be trippin\". \"I'm sorry I can't understand you maybe we can ask Mudbud to say it BETTER\" chortled Cyclone. Buddha was busy trying to stop Budderball from eating all the pastries. \"Well can he dance like I can?\" B-dawg rhetorically asked them. \"No he can't maybe you are cooler\" Roar jokingly replied. \"Wait a minute, when Mudbud rolls around in dirt then shakes of that looks like dancing and very good dancing\" Cyclone reminded him. \"Now that you say it, yes its true\" teased the hound. \"What my little bro cooler than me?!\" cried B-dawg. \"No way!\" Cyclones owner came out of the haircut shop and the two went away. Roar ran back to his own house. Rosebud and Mudbud then arrived. \"Oh you found them\" said Rosebud noticing the pastries. \"What was those two saying to you B-dawg while I was busy?\" asked a concerned Buddha. \"Nothing\" B-dawg grumpily lied. \"Now how's about we have those pastries\" The Buddies turned around to see Budderball had finished eating all of three! \"Budderball!\" they all shouted.[Chapter 6] Later the Buddies went to their usual meeting place, the park. \"So what should we do?\" asked Rosebud. \"I got an idea how about a dance-off\" suggested B-dawg, trying to prove he was the best at dancing. \"That's totally a good idea, and something new, although I think your'll win\" she agreed. \"Ok i'll go first\" said B-dawg. \"Well pick someone to dance against\" said Buddha. \"Hmm...I pick Mudbud\" declared B-dawg. \"Me...but I can't dance!\" cried Mudbud. Roar and Cyclone were walking through the park at the same time. \"What you don't know how to dance!\" B-dawg loudly announced so the two older bullies could hear. \"Come on just do some of that rolling around you do and shake around your good at that\" Rosebud told him. \"Well ok\" Mudbud nervously agreed. B-dawg started dancing, doing different moves. Roar and Cyclone came over to watch. Mudbud began dancing and actually did good. \"Huh?\" gasped B-dawg. Other dogs,cats and more animals came over to watch. Mudbud eventually fell but B-dawg was to tired to dance anymore. \"Now that was great!\" cheered a tabby cat. \"I think Mudbud could've won that but you know he's never danced before so yeah\" the sneaky German shepherd remarked. \"It's nearly dinner, our kids should be back soon\" remembered Budderball. \"What? HEY GET BACK HERE I WASN'T DONE TRYING TO MAKE YOU FEEL USELESS!\" Cyclone yelled to B-dawg. But the puppies didn't hear him. The Buddies ran to their homes. B-dawg stopped outside the sheriffs office to tap to Deputy Sniffer. \"Hey deputy what's crack-a-lackin?\" he greeted. \"Oh B-dawg what can I do for you?\" said Sniffer. \"I wanted to ask you a question\" B-dawg replied. \"Who do you think is cooler me or Mudbud?\" Sniffer took some time to think about the question before noticing Mudbud running past. \"Oh Mudbud!\" he called to the mucky puppy, who didn't hear and continued running home. \"Aw come on!\" yelled B-dawg, thinking Sniffer had said Mudbud was cooler but instead he was just calling to him. \"Wait what?\" asked a confused Sniffer. But B-dawg ran back to his house. The next day, when Billy went to school, B-dawg was again listening to \"Worst day ever\" because he felt like yesterday was a bad day for him. The other Buddies had decided to go get him, since he was late. They came in. \"Hey B-dawg how come your not at the park?\" asked Rosebud. \"Is this some new music you got?\" noticed Mudbud. \"Well why don't you school me at dancing again like how you embarrassed me yesterday!\" snapped B-dawg. \"Huh? B-dawg what's wrong with you?\" \"What's wrong? You wanna know what's wrong? Everyone thinks your more cooler than me when I am the cool one not you!\" \"But I just thought we were playing yesterday\" whimpered Mudbud. \"Yo are you mad or something!?\" shouted B-dawg. \"Oh\" Mudbud replied with a sad look on his face. The sad pup ran out. \"Wait, Mudbud?\" B-dawg said with a concerned look, realising how he had just yelled at his younger brother. \"B-dawg!\" yelled Rosebud. \"What did you do that for?\" \"I didn't mean to make him upset\" said B-dawg. \"I was just mad that everyone thinks he's cooler than me\". \"Jealousy is not a good feeling to have, B-dawg, everyone is different and Mudbud isn't trying to be cooler than you and he didn't mean for you to be embarrassed yesterday\" stated Buddha. \"Where'd you even get an idea like that?\" asked Budderball. \"Cyclone and Roar they said- started B-dawg. \"Those two bullies again, you should never listen to them!\" advised Rosebud. \"Ah snap! What do I do?\" sighed B-dawg. \"Don't worry I felt the same way when I ate the Thanksgiving turkey but then I tried making it up to Bartleby\" suggested Budderball. B-dawg ran to find his younger brother while the other three puppies went to the park. B-dawg found Mudbud sulking next to a puddle, in front of his house, looking in it. \"I never thought i'd see your near water\" joked B-dawg. \"Dude I'm sorry about yesterday, really\" apologised Mudbud. \"Don't need to apologise cause I need to first\" said B-dawg. \"Look Mudbud I didn't mean to get angry at you I was just mad that Roar and Cyclone were teasing me about that your more cooler than me\" he explained. \"But i'm not and I wasn't trying to be either\" sulked Mudbud. \"Dawg are you kidding? Your off the chain!\" Mudbud started to cheer up a bit. \"Come on little bro lets go!\" said B-dawg. \"You can choose today's activity\". \"Dude that sounds awesome!\" cried Mudbud. The mucky pup hugged his brother. \"Ok calm down, your gonna get me dirty\" said B-dawg awkwardly said. As they ran towards the park they spotted Roar and Cyclone next to the pet shop. \"Oh look its B-dawg and his MUCH cooler younger brother\" taunted Cyclone. \"Yes and...he looks more cooler than him today!\" added Roar. \"What kind of an insult was that?\" whispered the German shepherd. \"You dudes really need to chillax cause it seems all you do is come up with failed plans\" exclaimed Mudbud. \"Failed? I think it was quite good and worked\" Cyclone praised himself. \"No way you dawgs can never make the Air buddies split up!\" jeered B-dawg. \"Well Cyclone, you actually can't split up the air, it's everywhere\" said Roar. \"You idiot their called the AIR buddies, it's their nickname!\" snapped Cyclone. Cyclone growled, knowing his plan had failed, while B-dawg and Mudbud ran to the park to meet the others. The end[Chapter 7] Dogs need don't need school When Bartleby forgets his lunch behind its up to Budderball to break into the school and return it. It was 7:30 in their morning in Fernfield and Budderball's owner, Bartleby, was eating breakfast in a hurry. Of course his puppy could take time in devouring his big breakfast as he didn't have to go to school. \"Master Bartleby your father is waiting in their car\" the butler informed him. \"Ok\" he replied. \"Bye Budderball, see you after school\" He took his bag and went in the car while his greedy puppy continued eating. He then noticed a bag on the table and sniffed it. He could smell food. \"Oh no Bartleby left his lunch\" he realised. \"Thats the only good part of a school day!\" He immediately picked it up, by the handle, using his mouth, and ran outside. Meanwhile in the park the other Buddies were with their sport plushies. \"Yo dawg's this time I was here first\" bragged B-dawg. \"Aw your right you were here first\" groaned Rosebud, who's usually there first. \"That means I get to choose what game to play\" announced B-dawg. \"I choose to play tag!\" Buddha looked around and spotted Budderball running with his owners lunch bag. \"Looks like Budderball got a head start\" he noticed. They ran after him and stopped their oldest brother. \"Dude what's the rush?\" asked Mudbud. \"I can see you brang a doggie bag\". Budderball put the bag down. \"Guys this is'nt mine, Bartleby left his lunch I need to go give it to him before their lessons start\". \"In that case let's go\" said Rosebud. \"Team Buddies to the rescue!\" The five puppies ran towards the school, where all the kids just got off the bus and had gone inside the school. \"They'v already gone in, I guess that means so do we\" decided Rosebud. \"We shouldn't disturb the lessons, school is very important it teaches new lessons to children\" stated Buddha. \"Yo I don't need no school'in, I already know all I need to know!\" declared B-dawg. They ran inside and after all the kids went into their classes. They stopped in the hallways, and began looking at all the lockers, doors and fountains. \"Theres so many rooms which one is he in?\" wondered Mudbud. \"Buddha, dude, you shoud'nt be drinking from that fountain\". Buddha was reaching up to try and reach the fountain. \"Sorry, my throat just felt dry\" he explained. Just then loud footsteps could be heard. It was a teacher. The Buddies ran inside the janitors closet and hid. B-dawg, who was next to the broom, sneezed. The teacher stopped whistling to himself and looked around. He spotted Mudbud's dirty paw prints on the floor. A rat then came out from behind the vacuum cleaner. \"Ew gross!\" squealed Rosebud. \"Hey I resent that comment!\" snapped the rat. \"I watched you pups sneak in here and i'm telling you that was a bad idea!\" \"Can you please help us, we fear our location is about to be discovered?\" pleaded Buddha. \"Sure thing\" he replied, going over to the vent entrance and opening it. \"Yo dawg you sure we should be trusting a rodent?\" whispered B-dawg. \"It seems like the cleaners are doing a bad job\". \"You shouldn't judge people by the way they look\" stated his younger brother. \"You should all be able to fit in just go in a single file line\" advised the rat. \"Well dudette, ladies first\" Mudbud said to the only girl of the litter. They all went in, crawling through the narrow vent system. \"Ok talk quietly any noise you make can be heard around the school\" said the rat. \"I need to give this lunch bag to my kid, he said he usually has Geography at this time\" Budderball explained. \"Hmm yes I know where that room is let's go check if there still there\" replied the rat, running ahead. The Buddies followed their new rat friend until they stopped. \"Whats the hold up, its stuffy in here\" whined B-dawg. They all tried looking through the vent entrance which was on the top of the wall in the classroom. The class was watching a slide show about animals in snowy areas. A picture of a husky puppy came up. \"Hey it looks like Shasta\" noticed Mudbud. \"Yeah but its not as dreamy as him\" smiled Rosebud dreamily. \"Rosebud your inside voice\" giggled Buddha causing Rosebud to turn red. \"Move your butt dawg I wanna see!\" B-dawg said to Budderball. The class began hearing light puppy noises and began looking at each other. \"Whoever is making animal noises stop now!\" yelled the teacher. Everyone looked at Rodney and Skip, who usually muck around. \"Hey don't look at me, I didn't do that!\" he denied. The puppies and the rat were crawling towards the lunch hall. \"Well let's leave Bartleby's lunch here it has his name on so he'll know its his\" suggested Budderball. They arrived above the lunch hall and the rat prepared to open the vent. \"Ok puppies prepare to land!\" he told them. He opened it causing them all to fall down and land on a table. \"Ok let's leave it here\" said Rosebud. As they prepared to leave, Budderball smelt burgers. \"Oh sweet mamma!\" he drooled. \"Burgers!\" He ran of into the kitchen. \"Budderball stop!\" yelled Buddha. They all ran into the kitchen and hid in a cupboard. Budderball was climbing to the top of it trying to get to the burgers. A cook then walked in, heading towards them from the back door. \"Uh-oh i'm gonna take care of this one\" grinned the rat. He ran up towards her causing her to shriek. \"Dude let's go!\" Mudbud yelled to Budderball. The Buddies ran outside through the open back door. The rat followed after escaping the cook. \"Thanks for the help\" said Rosebud. \"No problem that was the most fun i'v had in ages!\" laughed the rat. The Buddies ran back to the park where their parents were waiting. \"Well that was...educational\" said Buddha,sarcastically. \"Like I said before dogs don't need no school, especially not the B-dawg!\" stated B-dawg. The end[Chapter 8] B-dawg the thief (part 1) A golden puppy has been stealing stuff around town and all the evidence points to it being B-dawg. It was 8:00 pm and the Buddies were out in the park playing. It was raining heavily and the Buddies were preparing to get back home. \"Ok guys it's getting late let's go home now before our kids start to worry\" said Rosebud. \"Yeah Bartleby usually leaves me a night time snack before I go to sleep\" agreed Budderball. \"No way am I staying out in this rain let's go dawgs\" added B-dawg. Over by the big post office, a news crew had assembled and were preparing to do a broadcast. Several people came over to watch, hoping they would be on TV. The reporter was Tad Thomson (The reporter from Space buddies) with Frederick, his assistant and cameraman. Roar and Cyclones owner's were among the small crowd so they were also there. They stood underneath a large awing above the post office. \"Good evening viewers and welcome to our exclusive report from outside the post office about the recent crime in the street of Biscuit\" Tad said to the camera. \"I am sure many in the crowd have seen or heard about this thief up until now we have no idea who it is other than the fact that it is a dog but which breed is this canine criminal?\" \"I think we should wait near the post office until the rain calms down a bit\" suggested Buddha. \"Yo there's a news crew there i'm sure they'd love to catch a full view of me for their show!\" gloated B-dawg. \"Yeah right B-dawg who would put you in a movie?\" laughed Rosebud before turning to Mudbud, who was rolling around in the mud. \"Come on Mudbud this rain is wrecking my fur-do\". \"No problem-o dudette!\" said Mudbud, shaking off all the mud on his fur. They ran over to the post office and waited underneath the large awing. \"Now we have some information from one of our viewers about the appearance of the dog this man claims to have a video of him\" continued Tad, giving the mic to a man next to him. \"I have Tad and i'll show you\" said the man. \"Ok...can we see it?\" asked Tad. \"Yes\". \"Like maybe now?\" \"Oh yes of course\" laughed the man getting his phone out. \"You see when I heard about the crime wave I put a camera outside my home to see this criminal\". \"Yo what's the hip-hop action?\" wondered B-dawg. \"Well, well well if it isn't Air bud's five golden nuggets\" joked Cyclone. \"Yum golden nuggets\" drooled Budderball, thinking of food. \"What do you want?\" glared Rosebud, trying to defend herself and her brothers. \"You know it's not safe for puppies to be on the street's at this time\" said Roar. \"You know about the menacing Golden Goblin?\" \"The golden goblin whats that?\" asked Mudbud. \"He's the golden retriever dog which has been robbing stuff on Biscuit avenue\" explained Cyclone. \"We dogs have seen him, he's a golden retriever but no one knows who it could even be one of YOU\". \"Yikes...maybe we s-should go back\" stammered B-dawg. \"Calm yourself B-dawg we are not on the road they speak of and we are surrounded by other people\" Buddha tried calming him down. \"Shh lets see them reveal the criminal\" commanded Roar. \"Ah ha here it is!\" exclaimed the man showing the video to the camera. \"Look its a puppy!\" gasped the Frederick. \"Pause it!\" The man paused the video so they could see the puppies appearance. \"Hmm it's a golden retriever all right\" spotted Tad, looking for more details. \"I think I've seen a clue, the puppy is wearing a bling with the letter...B!\" The Buddies all turned to B-dawg. \"What no I didn't do it!\" denied B-dawg. \"But B-dawg's always with us apart from at night but- started Rosebud. \"Night exactly when the robberies happen\" interrupted Cyclone. \"B-dawg has been feeling tired recently in the mornings but I doubt he is a thief\" defended Buddha. \"Yeah right your brother needs to be locked away!\" shouted Roar. \"Oh no this isn't good if an animal steals he gets put in the pound for life\" lied Cyclone, trying to frighten B-dawg. \"But I didn't do it!\" shouted B-dawg. Cyclone and Roar started barking loudly so everyone would see. They all turned around and looked at the five puppies who immediately ran home. The next morning, the Buddies met up at the park where B-dawg was worried that he could have been the one stealing. \"What if i'm sleep walking and stealing stuff in my sleep!\" shouted B-dawg. \"I have been feeling tired for a few days\". \"B-dawg, I assure you, that's nothing but a coincidence\" Buddha told him. \"But whoever is behind this is trying to frame you\". \"I'm too young to go to jail I wont survive a day!\" panicked B-dawg. \"Don't worry dude were'll find the REAL criminal and bring him to justice\" said Mudbud. \"Ok here's the plan when our kids go to sleep we all sneak out and wait on Biscuit street then catch the thief\" instructed Rosebud. \"Yum how can such a delicious name have such bad luck?\" sighed Budderball, thinking about food (as usual). Cyclone and Roar overheard this conversation and went to tell Deputy Sniffer. \"I'm telling you sir we just heard the Buddies talk their going to help B-dawg in his crime spree!\" lied Cyclone. \"I don't believe that I've known B-dawg his whole life he's to scared to do something like that it's probably any old dog who's doing this\" disagreed the bloodhound. \"Well would you at least let us come with you tonight so we can catch B-dawg?\" asked Roar. \"Fine i'm supposed to be heading there anyway the sheriff has some sort of 'big trap' he's making\" agreed Deputy Sniffer. \"But I still don't think it's B-dawg\".[Chapter 9] Meanwhile, Tad and Frederick had just been telling the Sheriff Dan the same thing and showed him the video too. But the sheriff said that when they capture the puppy then they will see who it is. The two went out and the Buddies were running past at the same time. \"This way guy's the free donuts special might end if we don't hurry!\" panted Budderball, running in front of the others. They were running to the bakery where the free donuts special ending. \"Hey it's those Air bud pups and the one who looks like the thief\" spotted Tad. His pocket watch fell out of his pocket and while B-dawg was running the chain accidentally wrapped around his leg and he was running with Tad's pocket watch on his leg. \"So did that fat guy send you the video of the thief?\" asked Frederick. \"No I asked that hippo to send me a video and he sends me a movie trailer about a dog playing basketball and a boy with a depressed life. Who would watch that?\" groaned Tad (guess what he's referencing). He then took out his phone only to see his pocket watch was gone! He looked at B-dawg. \"Hey that puppy just stole my pocket watch!\" yelled Tad. \"I knew he was the thief!\" \"Let's get him!\" shouted Frederick as they began chasing them. \"Er I think those free donuts will have to wait guys\" gulped Rosebud. \"Dudes we've got company!\" added Mudbud. They all began running followed by the two chasers. \"Let's get em!\" ordered Tad. \"I'm right behind the little- AH!\" screamed Frederick who had just crashed into a bin. A black cat jumped out and stepped all over him. The Buddies and the two reporters continued running through different areas, usually with Tad and Frederick crashing into stuff. Tad chased the Buddies into a garden and Frederick came from the other direction. \"This way through the bushes\" ordered Rosebud as they all prepared to wriggle under the bush. \"I got em cornered!\" beamed Tad. Him and Frederick jumped over the bush at the same time and crashed into each other. \"Ouch!\" murmured Buddha. \"Why are they after us anyway?\" \"Hey B-dawg what's that around your paw?\" noticed Budderball. \"Huh? It's a blinged out pocket watch how cool is that!\" exclaimed B-dawg, before spotting it had the name \"Tad\" written on it. \"Oh no I really am a thief!\" At night the Buddies went to Biscuit avenue and waited behind some trash cans. Sheriff Dan had finished laying out his \"master trap\" and was waiting by the bushes with Deputy Sniffer. The two bullies were also there. \"So where's all the biscuit's?\" asked Budderball. \"Budderball, we've been over this there isn't real biscuits on Biscuit avenue\" groaned Rosebud. \"That's a dirty trick to pull on someone\" exclaimed the greedy pup. \"Guys look someones coming!\" Buddha alerted the others. \"Look dudes it's the 'golden thief' and he's walking towards the trap\" explained Mudbud, who was being the look out. \"Now we can prove B-dawg's innocent. Hey where is B-dawg?\" The golden puppy walked towards a ring which Sheriff Dan left as bait and began sniffing it. \"Look he's wearing a bling it's B-dawg I told you!\" spluttered Cyclone. \"And it seems the rest of his criminal gang have come to assist him\" Roar glared at the Buddies. Sheriff Dan pulled on the string, which was supposed to drop a net attached to the lampposts on top of the dog, but nothing happened. \"Hey what gives?!\" the sheriff said loudly. The puppy saw Dan and ran. The sheriff stood under the net and Cyclone and Roar went towards the Buddies, also walking under the net. \"This is what I get for wasting my money on a net! Stupid, stupid- cursed the sheriff before the net dropped on all three of them. \"Hey it worked YES! now HELP GET ME OUT OF THIS AND GET MY LAWYER I'M INNOCENT I TELL YOU!\" \"What a big baby\" insulted Roar. \"Our town is being protected by a complete weirdo!\" added Cyclone. \"Don't worry sheriff, old buddy, i'll get you out just as soon as I get that thief\" promised Sniffer as he chased the \"golden thief\". \"Come on guys we need to go after him\" said Rosebud as she and the Buddies gave chase to the puppy. Air bud and Molly were out on the roof when Tad and Frederick prepared to make their way to the newsroom. \"Come on Frederick we'v just got news form sheriff Dan they found the golden puppy thief\" Tad hurried him along. \"What's the point we already know it's definitely that B-dawg puppy just get him instead\" whined Frederick. \"Did you hear that, Molly, B-dawg's in trouble!\" gasped Buddy. \"Quickly we need to check up on him!\"fretted Molly. The Buddies ended up in the forest with Deputy Sniffer. \"Dudes I hate to say it but I think B-dawg might actually be the thief\" worried Mudbud. \"No way is our brother a criminal\" protested Rosebud. \"Hey guys do you smell that?\" sniffed Budderball. \"Smells like honey\". \"Dude this is no time to be thinking about food\" grunted Mudbud. \"I smell it to maybe it's where the thief is\" suggested Sniffer. \"You should be canine dog when you grow up, Budderball, you got the nose for it\". They followed the scent to a cave in the woods. \"It seems like nature has sent us on the right course\" said Buddha. They went inside the dark cave and saw a small blanket, honey, apples and all of the stolen stuff. Their was yarn balls, a gold watch, a ring and food. \"Well all this detective work has made me hungry\" drooled Budderball, eating some cookies. \"Hey those are mine!\" shouted a female voice. They all looked in the cave as a female golden retriever puppy came out. She wore a B bling just like B-dawg. \"Hey your the golden thief\" said Rosebud. \"A-are you here to arrest me?\" she nervously asked Deputy Sniffer. \"Maybe you can explain whats going on\" insisted Sniffer in a kind voice. \"I don't like stealing but I have to\" admitted the puppy. \"Don't you have a kid to be your bro?\" asked Mudbud. She sadly shaked her head. \"When my family moved out of town they left me here. I was to scared to go into a pound I heard bad things about it\". \"Well I can help you, trust me is a changed man now\" promised Sniffer. \"Do you have a name?\" \"My names Betti\" she replied. \"Stealing is a very bad omen. Our brother has gotten into serious trouble\" Buddha told her. \"But wait why have you been pretending to be B-dawg?\" wondered Rosebud. \"I didn't want him to get into any trouble I just...think he's awesome that's why I wore this bling\" Betti shyly admitted. \"Aw that's so sweet\" cooed Rosebud. \"I can't wait to tell B-dawg\". \"Please don't\" blushed Betti. \"I'll find a way to prove he's innocent\". Just then, Tad and B-dawg along with Sheriff Dan came from the bushes. \"Ouch a nettle stung me!\" cried Dan. \"B-dawg where were you?\" asked Budderball. \"I saw Tad and needed to give him his bling...I mean watch back\" explained his brother. \"Yo who's this girl?\" \"B-dawg i'm so sorry I got you blamed for my crimes\" apologized Betti. \"Well that's nice but the whole town still thinks i'm guilty\" said B-dawg. \"Hey it's all the stolen stuff!\" noticed Dan, before looking at Betti. \"So your the thief? You live here little pup?\" Betti let out a quiet, but sad, whine. \"I think I've got an idea\" thought Sniffer, looking at Tad. In the news station, Tad was broadcasting the story. On a table next to him was B-dawg and Betti along with . \"So it seems this homeless puppy was stealing stuff because she needed it to survive. If you want to adoot her and give her a nice home come down to the pound\" said Tad. \"Turns out it wasn't this male puppy after all\". \"That's right and I promise to find her a home\" added Mr. Cruge, before turning to the crew. \"I am getting paid for this right?\" Billy was waiting in the room for B-dawg along with the rest of the Buddies. \"I knew he was innocent\" lied the large man who showed the recording. \"Soughta\". \"You pups were very nice for helping this homeless pup\" praised Air bud. \"But this slumber party was rad!\" exclaimed Mudbud. \"Ok just don't always do it\" laughed Molly. \"See told you it wasn't B-dawg\" Cyclone said to Roar. \"Did you?\" retorted the hound. The broadcast ended and B-dawg ran onto Billy's lap and began licking his face. The end[Chapter 10] Santa pups and Air buddies Santa paws takes the Buddies to the North pole to help out once again and to see their old friend, Puppy paws. This time they meet his siblings; Hope, Noble, Charity and Jingle. It was December and Fernfield was preparing for Christmas and the Air buddies were hoping to expect some very special visitors. Last year they had helped Santa Claus, Santa Paws and Puppy Paws save the holiday and Santa paws had said that they could help out next year too. \"Alright I can't wait for Santa paws to come\" hyped Mudbud. \"I hope he brings us lots of presents I mean, I don't mean to brag, but I think I've been on the nice list all year\" hoped Rosebud. \"Pshaw what have you done, Rosebud\" interrupted B-dawg. \"Well I dunno maybe saved Halloween\" Rosebud sarcastically replied. \"Girl, we all stopped the Halloween Hound\" argued B-dawg. \"You mean AFTER you released him\" Rosebud reminded him. \"Chillax Rosebud it was B-dawg's plan that saved us\" said Mudbud. \"Material possessions are not everything i'm just happy to help Santa paws in creating good karma\" advised the wise Buddha. \"I just hope Bartleby remembers to leave out some cookies so...Santa paws can eat it\" smirked Budderball. \"Dude we all know your gonna eat it\" said Mudbud. \"You know we all used to live together\". \"Well Bartleby hasn't ever found out thanks to my brilliant sneaking methods\" bragged Budderball. \"It's getting late\" yawned Rosebud. \"Good night to you all I look forward to seeing you tomorrow\" waved Buddha as he left for his house. The others went to their separate houses too. In the North Pole, the Santa pups were riding on the reindeer's and had just landed. \"Great to see you all having fun but may I remind you that we only have a few days before Christmas\" said their farther. \"We know dad\" sighed Noble. \"I think we can handle it I mean last year we did save all of Pineville\" Charity reminded Santa Paws. \"Aw man you guys are making me jealous I wish I was there to see it\" moaned puppy paws. \"Bro, you got in an adventure of your own\" said Hope. \"Yeah you hanged out with those totally awesome golden retriever pup's and helped deliver presents all around the world\" added Charity. \"That must've been so cool\" sang Jingle. \"Dad you know you said that next year the Buddies could be helpers- began puppy paws. \"I was thinking the exact same thing and I already talked about it with Santa so were gonna quickly head out and get them\" announced Santa paws, already guessing what his son was going to say. Budderball woke up and to his shock he was flying! He saw all of Fernfield below him. \"AH!\" he screamed. \"I'm having another flying nightmare!\" The others woke up and saw the same thing. They were all confused apart from Mudbud who was cuddled up in Santa's sack and was fast asleep. \"I am finally one with the sky\" meditated Buddha. \"Yo am I trippin or are we all just having the same dream?\" wondered B-dawg. Budderball quickly moved away from the edge of the slay and went behind Rosebud. \"Is the oldest actually hiding behind the youngest?\" laughed Rosebud. \"Hey you know that i'm afraid of heights\" whimpered Budderball. Suddenly they heard a familiar voice. \"Ho, ho ho!\" Mudbud then woke up. \"Whoa check out this sweet sack look's just like Santa's sack its got presents and everything!\" \"Good your all awake\" interrupted Santa paws. \"It's so good to see you again, Buddies!\" \"SANTA PAWS!\" they all shouted at once. \"Well Buddies what do you think of my sled's new paint job?\" asked Santa himself. \"It's off the chain although I would've put a shiny bling in the middle\" replied B-dawg. \"So we headin to the North pole?\" \"You betcha now if you excuse me I need to focus on flying this thing\" laughed the jolly fat man. \"Puppy paws and his siblings are excited to see you\". \"Siblings? I thought Puppy Paw's was the only pup\" said Rosebud, remembering what Puppy Paws had told them last year. \"Well he did but they never really played with him as they were all at Santa school so he felt like he was the only child\" revealed Santa Paws. \"That's really sad we would never do that to each other\" gasped Budderball. \"Luckily they learned their lesson after going on an adventure of their own and now their just like you Buddies\" replied Paws. \"I can't wait to meet them\" cheered Mudbud, getting excited. When the sled landed, the puppies rushed out and were greeted by Puppy paws. \"Buddies! I'm so happy to see you again!\" greeted Puppy paws. \"Us to, dude\" replied Mudbud. \"Yo I told you your part of the B-dawg nation so of course we would see you again\" added B-dawg. \"Come on let me show your my sisters and brother\" Puppy paws led them inside the workshop. \"Hey everyone look it's the Buddies!\" exclaimed Eddie, Santa paws head elf. Everyone greeted the Buddies but couldn't hang around with them as they had more important work to do. \"That reminds me I should probably get helping to\" remembered Puppy paws. \"My dad's now given me important tasks have fun with my brother and sisters\". \"Ok now we need to find his fam\" decided Mudbud. \"Hey that looks like it could be them\" Rosebud pointed at four Great Pyrenees puppies playing. Hope, the naughty one, was chasing after Noble and Charity and accidentally fell onto a pair of roller skates. \"WHOA I COULD USE SOME HELP!\" she yelled. She zoomed past Jingle and Noble and the Buddies. \"B-dawg look out!\" warned Buddha. But it was too late Hope crashed right into B-dawg and fell into a pile of presents. \"That was awesome!\" she cheered, before noticing B-dawg. \"Oops i'm so sorry are you ok?\" \"Yo that was so cool\" responded B-dawg, getting up. Hope then looked at him and got a bit shy. \"Well...er I gotta go clean up this mess since I caused it\" she stammered before running off. \"I love your bow it rocks, girl\" complimented Charity. \"Thanks\" smiled Rosebud. \"Well that was an interesting first impression\" stated Buddha in a jokingly way. \"Yeah were good at that you already know our brother so your the Buddies right?\" said Noble. \"You got that right, dude, were the Air buddies\" replied Mudbud. \"Hey you guys got any cookies or something to eat?\" asked the greedy Budderball. \"Follow us were'll take you to the kitchen\" instructed Jingle. Budderball, Jingle, Buddha and Charity went to the kitchen to get some food. \"Hey B-dawg don't look now but Hope is totally checking you out\" smirked Mudbud. \"Well it's like I always say chicks dig me\" gloated B-dawg. \"Besides that dog does look kinda pretty\". The others began laughing. \"I mean sweaty not pretty that just came out by accident\" stammered B-dawg. \"You dawgs believe me right?\" \"Yeah...of course B-dawg\" chortled Rosebud.[Chapter 11] (By the way the character \"Freedom\" is an OC created by user XH1234, I really liked that idea and asked if I could use it). \"You set up a school? For dogs!\" exclaimed one voice. \"But this is our largest facility and now it's being used to teach a bunch of mindless mutts!\" \"Yep. It's the only way I can think of to find the Eternal Crystal\" responded another. \"All my research has led me to believe that the crystal can only be found and accessed by a dog, but I am unclear as to which one- of course the staff will consist of dogs that are loyal to us secretly\". \"Obviously there's like a million dogs!\" \"That idiot Drex died in the town of Fernfield so I have 'borrowed' all dogs in the area as well as three other towns that Salazar visited; including Alaska where he was killed\". \"What do you mean borrowed?\" asked a third voice. \"More like...teleporting them to a location without their knowledge or consent\" explained the leader. \"So stealing them?\" \"No\". \"Dog-napping?\" \"No no no!\" \"Well you did something to them; they didn't just walk here\". \"Borrowing...with every intention of returning them- except for the two we need\". \"Sir our 'students' are waking up shouldn't we prepare their 'lessons'?\" asked the third voice. Rosebud sat up on her bed. It wasn't the same room she was used to in Fernfield with Alice, this one was bigger and more rustic. Her bed was also too large, like human sized big. It had been three days since her, her parent's and brother's were brought to this Holowan academy, where the Dalmatian headmaster, Dice, informed them that they would be staying for around two weeks, so that all pups would be taught about crucial dog traits (their history, training, obedience,etc). That sounded strange to a lot of them, why would they need to be taught these things when they learn them on their own, which is why all adult dogs were offered roles to calm their pup's, which they all eventually did since it would only be for two weeks. She had to admit, it was actually really helping her. So he's here too Rosebud thought to herself. She had only recently found out that Shasta, the Siberian husky pup they met in Alaska, was also here. In fact they were both in the same corridor. It had been years since their last encounter, Rosebud wondered if Shasta even remembered them. She wanted to go speak to him but she didn't know when or how. Unlike the Buddies, who were very well known because of their legendary sport playing father Air bud, Shasta was known for being the only living descendent of the evil Freedom and the other \"Dark dogs\" as they were nicknamed. Freedom, Adas the forever king, Siong and Cranz were the leaders of these \"Dark dog's\" and all were killed during Freedom's failed uprising. \"Today's the day\" Rosebud decided, walking outside. She walked down the gigantic hallway, past the other rooms of other dogs, and went to the one right at the end-Shasta's. \"Five years ago Grand Admiral Zanaz Salazar met his demise, alongside his husky companion's\" began Slazero. \"Now he returns to haunt me. There's one husky puppy in particular who I want you to keep an eye on\". \"Shasta?\" Dice already guessed. \"Not entirely\" replied Slazero. \"Salazar had two dog's, who in turn spawned a pup of their own- Mystic. She may be the only one who can access the crystal, Salazar created, whereas Shasta can use it\". \"So we know the two we need? Great let's close down this wreck of school\" hoped Dice. \"Not yet. We first need to find the crystal, without any dogs getting in my way\" he explained. \"Salazar was killed in an uprising orchestrated by a band of violent dog's, I don't want to make the same mistake. We keep them here while we search\". The Buddies are here?! No way! I haven't seen them since...have they always been here? How long have they been here? Actually how long have I been here for? Shasta's head had a million thoughts going in and out since he discovered that his old friends were in the facility somewhere. Three days. He remembered. Three long, horrible days. First of, he didn't know WHAT he was doing here (as did the others) second he was having a hard time accepting the idea that they are here to be \"taught\" valuable skills that all dogs must have as they grow up. And finally, and perhaps the most frustrating, was that many other dogs already knew that he was related to Freedom and Adas. Of course other huskies from Ferntiuktuk knew he was also the only puppy to ever win a dog sled race in a monstrous storm, but others didn't know that. They only remembered the actions of the evil Freedom. Although they seemed to overlook the small details that his father was actually quite a successful lead dog before he died and was taught by the fabled Talon. How will I even find them? This place is gigantic wondered the husky. Maybe if I just go look around. Shasta looked outside- the sun was setting. If he was fast he could do a quick search and then return to his room before Arctic woke up. Arctic was an Akita puppy who hated Shasta for two reasons: one his father beat his father in a dog sled race ages ago and two because his dad was later killed by Freedom. Arctic was also in love with Rosebud (a reason why she would generally avoid him) and if Arctic sees him talking to her, he would be insanely jealous. Shasta still remembered what happened to last pup, who wasn't her brother's, that talked to Rosebud. Rosebud took a right at the end of the hall, where there was only two rooms and nothing more. \"Rosebud?\" said a voice from behind her. Rosebud turned and saw Shasta. \"Shasta! We've been looking for you for hours today!\" cried Rosebud. \"We were so happy when we found out that you were here to\". \"Well it's great to see you again to\" smiled Shasta. \"So where are the other's?\" \"I have absolutely no idea- this place is huuuuge. We always meet up at break but other than that it's hard to find anything in this place\" said the golden retriever. \"I know, in fact it kinda seems like this is a school for humans\" noticed Shasta. In fact it was a school for humans, before it was abandoned years ago. \"So what are roles did your parents get, I'm sure your dad got something big?\" asked the husky. \"Actually he did, they made him deputy of...sports training which makes sense, while my mum got the role of being a monitor\" explained Rosebud. \"What about you- She quickly remembered that Shasta has no parents. \"Oh, sorry I completely forgot for a minute. \"It's dinner time, puppies need to eat!\" called a voice from behind them. It was Dice. \"I would think that Air bud's daughter would need a good meal so she can play sport as good as him\". \"Right, I was just heading to the lunch room\" lied Rosebud. \"Yeah...me to\" lied Shasta. Rosebud noticed that Dice was looking at a picture on the wall of a strange looking man, who had his face half covered by darkness and was wearing a white and gold uniform. \"Who's that?\" she asked. \"Nobody, must be an old picture\" stammered Dice. \"Nobody?\" repeated an elderly Akita dog. \"You call Grand Admiral Zanaz Salazar, the 11th most evillest person to ever live, a nobody!?\" \"Off you go pups!\" ordered Dice, as the two quickly left. \"You old cook, we're trying to keep him hidden! If either one of those huskies see him they might figure out who we are and what we want! Get rid of it now and never utter the words 'Grand admiral Zanaz Salazar' again!\" ","Summary":" I'v decided to create a few short stories about the Air Buddies.

The man also had a young boy, Adam, who Shasta would play for most of the time, since he was a very energetic puppy and needed someone equally as free-spirited as him to keep up. Shasta was only six weeks old at this point. One day, he was running around the shed playing with the other members of Joe's sled team: Growl, Snow and Hunter, while his parents watched over him. \"Dad, can I go with you guys this afternoon?\" the puppy asked. \"I'm sorry, Shasta, you're too young to go outside, you haven't been vaccinated yet\" refused his father. Joe was going to take his team to an area where most sled owners go to practise to race. Shasta loved sled racing, it was his favourite sport, and his father was well known as perhaps one of the best lead dogs in town. \"Whoa he sure is excited today. The little guys been running around driving us crazy\" said Hunter. \"Yeah, it's Adam's birthday, I gotta be prepared in case he wants to play or something!\" cried Shasta. \"Does he know?\" Hunter whispered to Nanook. \"Not yet\" he chortled. After Adam came in, and the husky's all decided to wish him a happy birthday by licking him, he poured them some food in their separate bowls. Joe came in a few minutes later. \"Ah, feeding the team, eh?\" he smiled. \"Well...er as a little birthday present, I've decided that, instead of giving Shasta to a different family, I would let you keep him, since you've already bonded so well with the little guy\". \"What seriously?!\" cried Adam. \"Thanks, dad!\" \"Your welcome, now get your bag while I start up the car, you don't want to be late for school\" his dad replied, leaving. Shasta stopped eating and widened his eyes, just as his ears perked when he heard what Joe said. He excitedly turned to his parents. \"Wait, I get to stay with Adam?!\" he exclaimed. His mother smiled and nodded. \"Yes, dear you can\". When Joe's car drove off, with Adam in it, three other husky's stood atop a snowy hill, watching the small house down below. \"Seriously?!\" exclaimed a large brownish husky, Baron. \"I-I thought they were gonna give the pup to us!\" \"Yes, well it seems his owner has changed his mind and given it to his kid instead\" hissed a slender husky, Echo, who was also a lead dog but of a different, incomplete team. But he was possibly the only other lead dog in town who's skills rivalled Nanook's. \"So, what you're just gonna steal him?\" questioned Baron. \"Why steal, when you can negotiate?\" said Echo. \"I have very keen persuasive skills\". \"Um...\" began the white female husky, Alpine. \"Alright let's go\" ordered Echo, as they headed down towards the shed. Hound, the strongest husky on Joe's team entered the shed, while Shasta was playing with his mother. \"Um, Nanook, you two have some visitors, they say they want to talk to you\" he told them. \"Ok, can you guys look after Shasta while we're gone?\" Nanook said to the others. The two left the four other husky's to 'look after' Shasta. \"Should be easy taking care of a puppy\" gestured Growl. \"Ha, for you, remember the last time you watched over him?\" laughed Snow. \"Ok then why don't you play with him first?\" challenged Growl. \"You're on\" accepted the female husky. \"How hard can taking care of a pup be?\" Nanook and his mate went outside to see the three husky's standing before them. Echo walked forward, while the other two remained behind. \"You're a difficult dog to get a hold of, Nanook\" began Echo. \"Congratulations to you both, I know it's a little late but what with your tough schedule and all...\" \"Thank you, Echo, but I'm sure that's not all you came for\" guessed Nanook, who had known Echo since he first moved into town with his Russian owner. \"Oh I should have known you would guess that\" sighed Echo. \"Even thought I am incredibly sad upon hearing the news that my team would not be receiving a new member, I have come to offer an alternative.\" \"We're all part of Joe's team, we're not gonna leave him\" said Shasta's mother. \"No, no of course not!\" Echo strongly rejected that thought. \"I was hoping Shasta would still be part of our team. Our owner used to live in Siberia, he's an expert in dog sled racing, knows all the techniques and I'm sure in a year or two, he can make your pup an official member of our team\". \"Yeah, rules don't say nothing about the age of the dog\" added Baron. \"Your asking us to give you our pup?\" gasped Shasta's mother. \"No, you can still see him all the time, this is just like...a school\" Alpine chimed in. \"We're on the verge of greatness, we are this close to finally becoming forming a full team\" urged Echo. \"Humans aren't even allowed to take puppies until there eight weeks old and you want him at six!\" cried Nanook. \"So you're saying we can take him at 8 weeks then?\" asked Baron. \"No!\" \"Nine weeks?\" \"No, no!\" \"Ten weeks, that's my final offer!\" \"NO!\" Back inside the shed, Shasta was tiring out Snow and the others. \"See...not so easy is it?\" panted Growl. \"Should've listened to you\" regretted Snow. \"Hey, Shasta, we're all tired how about you take a little nap and Snow will watch over you?\" wheezed Hound. \"...Ok\" Shasta reluctantly agreed. However, it was Snow herself who fell asleep, while Shasta just sat by her, still fully awake. The others had also fallen asleep, thinking they would finally have a moments peace and Snow would be watching him anyway. Shasta spied something interesting on top of the large, old wardrobe that was stationed in the corner of the shed directly next to a desk that was loaded with papers and small boxes. The item in question was a small brown book at the top. He looked around at the sleepy elders and decided to go check it out. Carefully, he climbed on the chair beside the desk and then on top of the desk, before climbing up the boxes that were piled up and leapt onto the top of the wardrobe. He examined the dusty journal and saw words written on it \"SLEDGING GUIDE\". A few of the boxes then tumbled over, destroying Shasta's only way of getting down, and waking Growl. \"But it's Saturday\" he lazily said, before noticing Shasta stuck on top of the wardrobe with no way down. He let out a cry, waking the others, and then ran over to Snow. \"You idiot!\" \"Nice babysitter\" snickered Hunter, sarcastically. \"Shh you're gonna wake up the pup\" hissed Snow. \"The pup's up there!\" yelled Growl, pointing up. They sprinted over to the desk and thought of what to do. \"Quickly! Go, go!\" urged an impatient Snow. Hound climbed up the chair before slipping on the papers on the desk and falling right on top of Hunter, squashing him. \"Snow, I can't get down\" whimpered Shasta. \"He asked for you, Snow\" Growl nervously grinned. \"He's not thinking straight, get back up there!\" she ordered. Hound helped Hunter up and he got to the edge of the desk, where the knocked over boxes were. \"Now what\" he muttered to himself. \"Shasta how'd you get there?\" Shasta pointed to the pile of scattered boxes and Hunter looked at them, dismayed. \"I take it you won't be joining us?\" questioned Growl, as he followed Hunter. \"No, I'll be ready to catch him if he falls\" Snow ran over to the front of the wardrobe. \"I'm a bit scared of heights\" confessed Hunter. \"Oh never mind, you stay were you are I'll get him\" snapped Growl, pushing Hunter out the way. \"Oh boy...\" Stretching out his legs, Growl leapt as far as he could and grabbed the edge of the wardrobe, making it wobble. \"Uh-oh this was a bad idea...\" he immediately regretted. \"Shasta, crawl down Growl and let go I'll catch you!\" instructed Snow. \"Ok\" he nervously agreed. He crawled down Growl's back, accidentally hitting his head with his small legs and then let go, being caught by Snow. \"Mission accomplished!\" praised Hound. \"WHAT ABOUT ME!?\" screamed Growl. \"Oh boy, think positive. I'm gonna be fine.\" The wardrobe began wobbling and leaning forward slightly. \"I'm dead\". \"You two have a lot of hard work to do can you really be a professional race dog and a parent?\" asked Alpine. \"We can do both for you\". \"We'll always have time for Shasta\" disagreed Nanook. \"Come on think about it, we could make him something great, like you\" continued Echo. \"He already is\" replied his mother, sharply. \"Typical mum-like thing to say, you don't actually mean it\" snorted Baron. \"Enough, look we've told you the answer is no, now please go!\" declared Nanook. A loud crash was heard coming from the shed. \"Fine, it sounds like your parenting has already worked\" decided Echo, sarcastically. Nanook and his mate rushed back into the shed to see it messed up, with the wardrobe and desk on the floor and papers and boxes scattered everywhere. \"We watched him, for you\" groaned Growl, before falling back onto the floor. Shasta grinned nervously, moving his paw up and down, realising he was in trouble. Later, at night, Shasta's parents had told him off for the incident and Joe and Adam's mum weren't to happy cleaning up the mess. \"If you keep making mess Shasta, Joe might give you to another family anyway!\" shouted Nanook, not wanting him to go with Echo. \"But humans' jobs are to clean\" argued the puppy. \"It's good enough that they feed us and take care of us\" said his mum. \"But I don't want to clean, I want to race like you\" said Shasta, rather arrogantly. \"I know but right now your just a pup, you don't magically become good at sport like that\". \"But Air bud just had five pup's who can all play sport\". \"Try to get some sleep, Shasta, we'll continue this in the morning\" his mother said softly, kissing him on the head. \"...Yes mum\" Shasta tiredly agreed.[Chapter 2] The annual Ferntiuktuk dog sled race had just finished with catastrophic results. Two grown huskies, while racing past the home stretch of the race, smashed the ice beneath them (although it seemed as though a contestant that had already passed through had purposely put pressure on the ice), sending the innocent dogs to their doom. Although Jean George was declared as the champion, rumours began circulating of sabotage during the race by the victor. Their devastated owner, Joe Bilson, sadly walked towards his truck when sheriff Ryan came over to him. \"I'm sorry about what happened, Joe\" said the sheriff, gravelly. \"It's hard to predict which areas of the ice is fragile so we can't really prepare. Better luck next year\". \"There is no next year\" refused Joe. \"I'm giving up dog sled racing, it's not my thing anymore\". He got into his truck and drove back to his house, where his family tried comforting him over the death of his two loyal huskies. The rest of Joe's team were incredibly dismayed when they returned to the shed, wondering how they would tell Shasta the grim fate of his parents. When they did return, he ran up to them excitedly, expecting them to have won. \"You're back!\" he cried. \"Did you win?! Where's the trophy? Where's mum and dad?\" Hound looked to Hunter, who in turn nudged Snow, thinking perhaps she could break it down easily. At first, Shasta didn't believe it, thinking it was some kind of joke or something. \"You're lying right?\" he shouted, refusing to listen. \"Shasta we- began Growl. But before he could finish, Shasta ran out through the hole in the shed and into town. \"Go get him!\" ordered Snow, as Hunter ran after him. The small husky looked around the busy town, where many people were talking. Crowds of townsfolk were reading newspaper's, with headlines such as Tragedy occurs in annual race. Dogs were also talking about the news, with profound pain and grief, very few laughed at the news, while others remained optimistic. \"Did you hear what happened?\" asked one dog. \"Must've been terribly excited, police say the ice cracked\" said another. \"Ol' Joe must be upset, I told him to be careful\" one man said to another. \"Two dogs dead after ice cracks during race\" another read aloud from the papers. \"Mum! Dad!\" Shasta yelled, beginning to get scared that these rumours were actually true and the dogs that everyone was speaking of was indeed his parents. He spotted one dog that looked similar to his dad, and smiled, thinking it was him. He ran up to the older dog, who in turn spun around when Shasta bumped into him. \"Dad!\" he shouted, before realising that this husky's face did not resemble his fathers'. Now that he had turned, his markings were properly revealed. \"What are you on about?!\" growled the dog, as Hunter quickly found Shasta. \"Sorry about that, kid's a little confused\" apologised Hunter. \"Oh Hunter, I heard about Nanook, my condolences\" condoled the husky. Upon hearing those crushing words, Shasta ran off again, back to the shed. \"Wait!\" demanded Hunter, running after him. \"Was it something I said!?\" the other dog called after him. Later in Joe's shed, Shasta miserably turned his attention to the other's, who were grabbing their things, as if they were leaving. \"Well, it's moving day for us, gonna miss this old shed\" sighed Hound. \"Yes I sure will miss that wardrobe\" snickered Growl, before brushing off his snicker, realising there was nothing to be happy about. \"You guys too?\" sniffled Shasta, feeling completely alone now. \"Afraid so, in two days to be exact\" said Hunter. \"You can keep my teddy\" Hound looked to his old stuffed teddy bear toy. \"I'm sorry Shasta, but at least you still have Adam\" said Alpine. \"On second thought, I'm keeping the toy\" Hound hugged it while the others looked at him like he was baby. \"What, it's cuddly?\" Echo's owner (the Russian man) tried to buy some of the dogs for his team but with no luck. \"I'm sorry, people have already purchased them\" Joe told him. \"Oh...can I at least give you my number in case they change their minds?\" he asked. \"Sure, if they do, you'll be the first one I call\" agreed Joe, taking out a pen and paper. Perhaps the one who had felt the most pain was Shasta. The death of his parent's had a huge impact on him and although he remained happy whenever Adam was around, he couldn't shake off the sadness and pain he felt. \"It's ok, boy, you still have me\" Adam soothed him, guessing why he was not in usual playful mood. A few days had gone by and Joe had sold the rest of his team to different racers across Alaska. Shasta decided to finally go into town, which he hadn't since the incident. He went over to Deputy Bernie, who was laying outside the sheriff's office talking to Francois and Philippe. \"Did I already mention the shiny trophy?\" goaded Philippe. \"Oh look here is their little pupsqueak, I can't imagine the pain\". Shasta ignored them and talked to Bernie instead. \"Hey there Shasta, I haven't seen you in a few days now\" greeted Bernie. \"Are you still feeling blue?\" \"Yeah, I'm still a bit down\" admitted Shasta, quietly. \"Why is he feeling down?\" snorted Francois. \"He wasn't the one who raced and died, he just stayed at home with that miserable boy who dreams of being a musher\". \"Remember when his dad claimed to be taught by Talon the Great, an old myth?\" laughed Philippe. \"Or when he said he saw a raptor? What an idiot\". \"Don't talk about my dad, he was a much better lead dog than you ever will be!\" growled the puppy. \"Is that why we won and he sunk?\" snickered Francois. \"Did I mention our big, shiny trophy?\" Bernie glared at them, making them stop laughing. \"I would think you two champ's would be an inspiration to the youngsters but here you are bullying them\" he scolded. \"We were just remembering our dearly departed friend\" Francois put on a fake sad voice, hiding a laugh. \"By the way have I told you about out trophy?\" \"Maybe I should talk to you later sir\" decided Shasta, walking off sadly. \"Now wait a minute- but it was too late, Shasta was gone. Bernie glared at the two laughing dog's who tried their best to hide their laughs upon noticing his glare. As the husky puppy walked down the road, five adults watched him from atop a snowy hill. One was a lead dog, one considered to be the best around, Echo. They belonged to the Russian man who had just moved in and was eager to start a dog sled team (the same man in Snow buddies). They had previously tried to convince Nanook to give Shasta to them, with no success. Shasta walked on followed by the two annoying bullies, when Echo and his group appeared in front of him. \"You're father was a difficult dog to beat\" he cleared his throat. \"Yes we are deeply saddened to hear of his death\" added the white female husky, Alpine. \"We all are sad, right Akira?\" \"Huh?\" Akira asked, not really paying attention. \"Oh right, I totally agree.. with whatever you just said\". \"I still don't believe it\" rejected the large brown husky, Baron. \"Were you there? No; we were, we saw, he died\" listed Francois. \"Are you a lead dog?\" Shasta asked, noticing the same level of allegiance his father once possessed. \"No he's just a fool who thinks he is\" insulted Francois. \"Don't you two clowns have a trophy to rub into every dog in Italy's face?\" asked Baron. \"No, we're from Franc- \"Europe?\" \"What, no\". \"Asia?\" \"No, no!\" \"Well you should do something with the trophy; you just gonna lick it?\" joked Baron. \"Come on Francois lets go, I think our master has finished his trim now\" urged Philippe, noticing Jean George exit the barber shop. \"I am glad them two have withdrawn\" said the wise, Japanese husky, Anouk. He had been bought by the Russian man from a illegal seller in Fernfield called Selkirk Tanders. \"Now that the clowns are gone I can continue\" added Echo. \"Greetings, Shasta, I am Echo- a lead dog as you already know- and as you can see we are a five-dog crew. A true sled team requires six dogs in total and our owner used to live in Siberia and is an expert on training dogs to race. I'm sure he could easily make you the excellent race dog your father was, you have the potential to become one of us...maybe better\". \"That's doubtful\" whispered Akira. \"By the time of next years race, you could be with us racing towards that finish line\" added Alpine, softly. \"It will only take about...what five, ten months, I mean can expect no miracles- \"Forget it, I'm not interested!\" interrupted Shasta. \"First of, I'm not abandoning Adam to join you and second I don't even want to race anymore. I hate that stupid sport!\" \"Excuse me?\" asked Echo, bluntly. \"I don't believe what I'm hearing\" said Alpine. \"Every husky in town wants to race, even puppies. I get that your parents died in a race, but that doesn't mean you should give up on it\". \"Yeah you should\" whispered Akira. \"Oh come on, Echo, this is a waste of time! He's just a puppy, what's him or his parents ever done for us anyway? I know, beat my team in a race, forcing my owner to abandon me onto the cold streets?\" \"The rules don't specify what age the dogs have to be to enter\" hissed Echo. \"Besides he's the only dog left in town who doesn't race or have plans to, we can easily persuade him\". \"There's a lot of things the rules don't 'specifically' say, they don't say a kid can't enter that doesn't mean they can\" argued Akira. \"Shasta, we could make you something great, just like your dad, besides Adam's never gonna race, those are just empty dreams\" continued Echo. \"You do not think his dad is going to allow him to after what happened?\" contributed Anouk. But Shasta wouldn't hear it and just ran off, away from them. \"Amazing speech, Churchill, you really reeled him in with that one\" taunted Akira. \"Anyway, our owner is supposed to be practising with us soon, so... \"You guys go on ahead, I'm gonna have a little one-to-one talk with Shasta, maybe I caught him on a wrong time\" decided Echo. When Baron and Anouk departed, Alpine remained behind and stopped Akira. \"I think we should follow Echo, his persuasive skills aren't always as good as he thinks\" she suggested. \"Might as well, plus I don't want to have to listen to Baron's 'jokes' the whole way back\" agreed Akira.[Chapter 3] (if you don't know who the two OC characters at the end are, read my other fanfics Back to Fernfield and Dino buddies to find out) Echo followed Shasta to an open area of Alaska, beyond the forests and positioned right next to the ocean that stretched far beyond the horizon. He found him behind a mountain, sulking next to two, stone objects buried in the snow. They were gravestones- a pair of them. Joe had decided to build two graves for his loyal sled dogs and placed them in a far place where no one else could see them, except for him of course. \"I don't get it\" whimpered the pup. \"If it was so dangerous, why'd you do it?\" \"This is quite an unusual place to be\" announced Echo, surprising him. Shasta didn't turn, however. Echo glanced over to the names on the gravestones. \"Oh, he buried them here. So who are we talking about, eh?\" \"My parents\" Shasta quietly admitted. \"I kept telling them that it could be dangerous but they never listened!\" \"Funny, your father told me that your loved the sport\" recalled Echo. \"I did, but whenever my parent's would race I always felt a bit nervous and scared that they might not come back\" admitted the pup. \"I loved the idea of racing myself, but with that Jean George guy showing up, I just kept getting scared for them each year. Why did they have to race? It was just one year, they could've missed!\" \"It's sport, of course there is risks involved\" lectured the slender husky. \"They were being loyal to their owner, repaying him for years of dedication to them. So what if the ice hadn't broke? If they hadn't raced this year, they would've raced next year and the next, and maybe it would've cracked eventually but there's nothing you can do about it. They served their human to the end, to win that trophy and in that way, they all would've benefited from it. Now you hadn't thought of it like that had you?\" \"You know what, I never thought of it like that either\" Akira whispered to Alpine. \"Why are you two here?\" realised Echo. \"Still, what's the point in racing when there's murderers involved, I don't want to see Adam getting hurt or worse?\" questioned Shasta. \"Let me tell you a different story\" began Echo. \"Ever heard of the legend of Balto and Togo, a tale spoken throughout every corner of Alaska?\" \"My dad started telling me that one, but he never finished it\" Shasta shook his small head. \"Then allow me to finish it\" Echo cleared his throat. \"It was 1925, and a deadly virus took hold of Nome and an epidemic was almost inevitable so what happened was, serum was shipped to the Alaskan town of Nenana- \"Really you could just die from this aggravation\" Akira cringed at the way his leader pronounced the name of the Alaskan town. \"As I was saying!\" Echo glared at him. \"It was a risky trek, both for the dogs and the mushers but let me tell you something, they never surrendered to the dangers like you are now, they went on and on for about...what three days maybe six or something like that\". \"Oh boo hoo I'm in tears\" joked Akira. Alpine just let out an annoyed sigh. \"What, it's a joke, what I can't joke in my spare time?\" \"You don't get spare time...why are you still here?!\" growled Echo. \"So what do you say, Shasta, did my inspirational yet possibly historically inaccurate story influence you to change your mind and accept my offer?\" \"Or did we really just come here for no reason?\" muttered Akira. \"...That story was incredible, sir, but like I said I'm Adam's pup and I'm not gonna abandon him\" declared Shasta. \"Really, because I think the boy's holding you back? Last chance, yes or no, are you gonna turn me down?\" repeated Echo. \"...No\" Shasta spluttered out, despite deep down wanting to live up to the legacy of his parent's. \"Ok see ya, I'll let you continue with whatever it is you were doing\" declared Echo, as he turned around and walked on, followed by Akira and Alpine. \"You just allowed him to say no...without any extra convincing?\" questioned Alpine. \"Oh he'll come crawling back\" promised Echo, deeply. \"Once he realises that we can offer him what that boy cannot- glory\". Shasta returned home at around four and remained with Adam until his father came back from he his job as a shop owner, which was now his full time job. Joe had bought a box of spare shop supplies that he didn't have any use for with him, thinking Adam might find something interesting in the collection. Adam took it to the shed after, where Shasta jumped on the desk and examined the context of the box. There was an old pair of trainers, a blue dog collar, a hockey puck and several DVD's. One in particular, seemed somewhat interesting. It was titled 'Welcome to my life', a rock'n'roll song by a band known as Simple Plan. He used his muzzle to place the tape into the player and pressed play with is nose. Huge mistake. This song was very depressing for him. Each lyric repeated itself in his head, as each one related to him in some way. If his day wasn't already bad enough. Then something happened at night, which made him change his outlook on his situation. He was laying on top of Adam's bed, slowly trying to get some sleep, when he saw Adam awake. He was praying. Praying for his own dog sled team, so that he could make up for what happened to his father. Perhaps, end his embarrassment and end any torment that he had received. Adam as well had received some form of bullying in his class by people who had heard the news, and it made him angry and upset since he knew how close his dad was to his husky's. Seeing this, Shasta decided that perhaps he would take up Echo's offer, sought off. He could ask him to train him to be a lead dog, so he could become like his dad and so he could race with Adam. On a huge mountain, beyond the beautiful town; isolated and shielded from civilisations by the huge mountains and open oceans, two dark figures walked along the icy sloped, observing the atmosphere. \"So you dragged me all the way here for this?\" asked a deep, scary voice. \"Not this, there is something here which interests me\" replied an equally as dark voice. One was a skeleton like figure, covered with a cloak and a hood above his skeleton head and his glowing red eyes. Two blasters lay tucked inside his belt while a scythe was attached to his cloak. The other was a dark samurai-like creature, with metal folds surrounding his head, revealing nothing but his glowing red right eye. On his wrists, two gauntlets were attached, each having the ability to summon a fearsome blade each. \"Look Blade it feels like your wasting my time, you don't even know where your going\" moaned the skeleton figure. \"Patience, now is not the time to search but to watch\" Dark Blade calmly replied, taking out a spy bug and placing it on the cold surface below. The small robot's eyes turned green. \"To avoid discovery, we should wait until a storm hits this area- no one would be out in that weather- and then we can search uninterrupted\". \"How do you know there is going to be a storm?\" questioned Death. \"I wonder how you survived in this death trap. If it's not the boiling heat it's the cold snow, what's wrong with this planet?!\" \"I told you a wise, old dog assisted me until Anthem eventually rescued me\" replied Dark Blade. \"And during my visit, I learnt that snow storms are all to common in this place, one will likely hit again and when it does, we will return and find our new prize. Only a fool would be out in these storms\".[Chapter 4] The next day, Adam was heading to school and had taken Shasta along with him for a walk, but before they did they had to go to the sheriff's office. Adam's school was taking them for a field trip in a few weeks to see the mountains on the outskirts of town (the supposed home of the Alaskan myth known as Talon) and the permission slips had to be handed in to the sheriff's office as he would be managing this trip to ensure safety. When Adam went in the office, Shasta ran off the find where Echo could possibly be. He went out to the edges of town, beyond the welcome sign, as most people usually practise racing there with their dog's. He quickly hid behind a tree when Jean George raced past with his ferocious team. \"Come on you lazy felines, hike!\" he called out to them, using his whip to encourage them to run faster. He then noticed Echo racing with his dog's and owner over by the other side of the trees. They weren't as fast as Jean George because their team only had five members and Echo himself was doing two jobs at once at the front. Once they stopped outside their house and the Russian man went inside, leaving his dogs outside, Shasta approached them. \"Small husky puppy approaching us\" Anouk alerted the others. \"Oh it's that loser\" insulted Akira. \"Shh, he might hear you!\" hissed Alpine. \"Greetings, Shasta how are you on this not-so-fine, snowy day?\" greeted Echo. \"I'm fine, sir, I was actually...wandering if you could teach me to be a lead dog, like you\" he explained. The others put on surprised faces and Baron was trying his best to hide a snicker. \"So you decline my offer to start out from the beginning and now you want to be a lead dog?\" puzzled Echo. \"He's mad!\" whispered Akira. \"That's quite impossible, I mean I know your father was a great lead dog but...training a puppy to be one?\" \"But you said your owner was an expert\" recalled Shasta. \"Yes but why would he train you if your not on our team, what's in it for him?\" said Echo. \"Unless you want to rethink my initial proposal?\" \"...No thanks, sir, sorry to waste your time\" apologised Shasta quietly, walking away sadly, with his head down. \"Well that was a big waste of time\" exclaimed Baron, a bit too loudly. He walked past Francois, who muttered \"loser\". Adam went up to Sheriff Ryan and his dog, Bernie, who was sitting on the chair beside him. \"What can I do for you, Adam?\" he asked. \"I have the permission slip for the trip to the mountains\" Adam handed the letter over to him. \"Oh that's perfect, now we have everyone!\" cheered sheriff Ryan, adding it to the pile of letters. \"...Um Sheriff?\" began Adam, wanting to know something about the trip. More specifically who else was gonna be there. \"Um, you don't happen to know the groups for when we go, do you? I don't want to be in a group with people I don't like\". \"Bullies, can't stand the sight of them\" called Lieutenant Toff's, the sheriff's temporally assistance for a few months, until he would be transferred back to his original post in another town. \"There like a disease, an incurable, weird, irritating disease\". A loud crash was then heard, as he slipped and crashed into a bunch of supplies. \"Ow\". \"You ok?\" called Sheriff Ryan. \"Yeah, I'm peachy\" lied Toff's, exiting from the other room. He was wearing a heavy Star Wars Shadow stormtrooper suit, which was the source of all this commotion. \"What are you wearing?!\" cried Ryan. \"A Shadow trooper suit, it's awesome; keeps me warm in this bleak town\". \"Don't you find it hard to walk in that?\" \"I guess, it's nothing really\" denied Toff's, before slipping again. \"Fine whatever, go check that pile of papers will you?\" the sheriff rolled his eyes. Toff's searched through the paperwork. \"Lets see: date, number of coaches...nothing on groups, I assume that will be told to you on the day\" said the lieutenant. \"Oh ok, thanks anyway sheriff\" thanked Adam, before heading off to school. Walking around a large empty area full of snowy hills, Shasta kicked some snow around before deciding that if Echo wouldn't train him he would just learn himself. After all, his father never mentioned that he received training from anyone other than Joe, so why would he need it when he was just a puppy. Seeking the largest hill possible, Shasta practises running up and down it, although because of his much smaller legs he would just repeatedly fall down and his running wasn't that good either. But the worst part of it all was when he tried running across a frozen lake. He himself froze, shuddering at the painful reminder of his parent's horrific demise when they were standing above ice. He panicked, quickly trying to get of it as soon as possible. However, this just made him slip and slide across the ice until he hit his head against a tree, making all the snow on the branches fall on him. Another horrible day. The depressed puppy just kept on relaying the song he heard yesterday feeling even more miserable then before. All the while, Echo and his team was watching this montage unfold. \"Yikes, I feel sorry for him\" cringed Akira. \"Can't you do anything, Echo?\" Alpine beckoned to her leader. \"I guess...I mean that is to say, no one ever said it was impossible...ok fine I'll try my best\" decided the lead dog. \"Aw what why?!\" complained Akira. \"Just for a bit until he himself realises that he's just a pup and puppies can't race, or kids for that matter\". \"Sometimes an icicle through the heart is better than one in the back\" advised Anouk. \"What does that even mean?!\" demanded Echo. \"It will all end in tears, mark my words\" promised Akira. Echo found Shasta, staring at his reflection in the ice that he slipped on, keeping his paws in the snow, sulking. \"Shasta, I've changed my mind perhaps I can train you to be a lead dog exactly like me\" he said. \"Seriously?!\" cried Shasta, his tears vanishing. \"I'm a lead dog, how hard can training a pup be?\" Echo stated. Of course he didn't know how wrong he was.[Chapter 5] In Adam's school, the students all took out their homework as soon as the teacher entered the classroom. Adam had forgotten his (hadn't done it). \"Adam where's your work?\" demanded the teacher. \"I um...forgot it at home, Mrs\" he slowly admitted. \"In that case, I'm afraid you have a detention\" said the teacher, returning to the front. The students around Adam began laughing. One boy in particular, Fred, laughed louder than the others. \"What an idiot\" he taunted, turning to his friend. \"Did you know his dad was so stupid he got to of his dog's killed?\" \"Well I can believe it since he's related to him\" laughed his friend. \"Shut up!\" Adam angrily snapped at them. \"Didn't you dad also lose to Jean George a couple years ago?\" recalled one girl. \"Um...yeah, well, I guess something like that...the sun was in his eyes\" stammered Fred. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of town (the same area where the Buddies first landed in Snow buddies) Echo and his team decided to see what they would be dealing with exactly. Echo ordered him to run as fast as he could so that he could see how best to train him. \"Hm looks like we've got some work to do, he can't be a lead dog running at that speed\" noted Echo. \"Obviously not, he's a puppy!\" Akira chimed in. \"He seems ok running up hills, it's the big ones that are the problem\" added Alpine. \"I'm gonna go get some berries from the bushes, they say you shouldn't stress a puppy\" decided Echo. \"Watch him while I'm gone. Shasta continued running, despite the fact that Echo was gone, over a frozen lake, however he soon realised what he was standing on and stopped. He shivered just looking at it, remembering what happened to his parents. \"What's happening, why'd he stop?\" wondered Akira. \"Did his parents not perish running across a frozen lake, the pup has that fear in him\" realised Anouk. \"Go get him\" Alpine gestured to Baron and Akira, who miserably went over. \"Here, Shasta come to us\" instructed Baron, as he walked further. However, his big paws soon became to much for the ice to handle, and when Akira slipped and buried his claws into the ice to prevent himself from collapsing, the ice began cracking. \"Uh-oh\". Baron quickly grabbed Shasta and he immediately sprinted as fast as he could over the lake and towards Echo. \"Run you idiot!\" shouted Akira, as the two ran, while the ice cracked beneath them. Akira slipped on Baron's paw and the two skidded along the ice and crashed straight into a bush. \"Looks like we have a problem\" muttered Alpine, as Shasta shivered behind her. \"S-sir, can we have a little break?\" pleaded Shasta, still shivering. \"I think we all can do with a little break\" agreed Baron. \"Hey look there's a cave over there, why don't you go take a little nap in there while we...talk?\" When Shasta went inside the cave, the others began discussing what to do. They were unaware that this cave belonged to a bear that had followed Shasta in, sat at the front and went to sleep, beginning it's long hibernation. \"'Watch him for me'? Mind if I fluff your tail, sir\" Akira mocked his leader's bad decisions (in his eyes anyway). \"What are we gonna do? Obviously Echo can't teach him, and he's gonna figure that out soon\". \"Relax, I'm sure we can teach him something at least\" assured Alpine. \"Why does that little thing even want to race, he's a puppy for heaven's sake?\" questioned Akira. \"His boy shares the same compassion for the husky tradition of racing as he does\" stated the wise Anouk. \"Now where is our leader gone?\" \"Here!\" Echo called from the bushes. \"Just eating..I mean getting some berries. Where's Shasta?\" \"Oh I told him to go take a nap in that cave over there, so we could rant about him\" Baron proudly stated, pointing to the cave. Echo narrowed his eyes at it and noticed something big and brown. \"You idiots that's a bears cave!\" They all frantically ran over to it and peered inside, to see the huge bear blocking the path further in the cave. He was laying there, sleeping. \"Well, he's dead\" declared Akira, graphically. He turned to leave but Baron stopped him. \"I think he's hibernating\" he realised. They all then grinned at the brown husky. \"What?\" \"This is your fault, so you go in and get him\" ordered Echo, pushing him forward into the cave. \"Why don't you go?\" \"As leader of this team, I cannot afford to get injured or die, therefore the minor, expendable figures should\". Baron gulped and began walking past the bear, avoiding it's wriggling paws. He looked to the others who were urging him to go on. Once he got to the other side, Baron let out a sigh of relief, however, he soon stepped on the bear's tail, making it angrily wake up. \"Uh-oh\" gulped Baron. The bear stamped on his tail as hard as he could and then went back to sleep. Baron held in a scream and once he exited he unleashed it right into Echo's face. Now, it was Anouk's turn. \"Silent but fast is the way of the ninja\" he announced, swiftly entering the cave. He silently walked towards the awake bear, who growled. \"Over here, look I'm Mowgli\" Echo tried distracting him. \"How's the wife and the kids if anyone even married a thing like you\". The ninja dog nervously laughed, while the bear stood up. He grabbed him and flung him out the cave, landing right onto Akira. Finally, Echo decided to go in. Glancing at his injured comrades, he sighed and decided to stand up and walk along the gap between the bear and the cave wall. He turned to the others. \"Keep going!\" urged Baron. \"Shut up!\" hissed Echo. It wasn't long, before he stepped on the bear's tail like Baron did. Now the bear had had enough of these disturbances and fiercely got up, fixing his red eyes on Echo. As he tried walking back the way he came (still on two's), the bear lunged his leg forward and kicked him hardly right in the \"batteries\". Echo held in his scream, not wanting to anger him any more and then exited. \"Are you ok sir?\" asked Baron. Echo led out a loud scream, that caused all the bird to scatter from their trees. Jean George raced in to town and stopped his team right outside a house in the centre of town. He got off the sled and banged on the door. An equally as mean looking, sly, trickster opened the door, Paul, Jean George's only friend, commonly refereed to in the town as their own \"Jacob Marley\". \"Ah, Jean George, the man who made me win a fortune!\" cried Paul. \"I made a bet that you would win and so you did, therefore so did I. $400, I got!\" \"Hello, hello Paul, I was wondering if Doctor. Mitchel has returned yet\" he cut right to the point, not really wanting to talk to Paul for long. \"He should be back tomorrow\" answered Paul. \"To be fair, you wouldn't have won if it weren't for the other guy's dog's dying\". \"A good racer is prepared for all the dangers, that was his own fault\" argued Jean. \"It was a fair game\". \"I thought you said you put on one of the sleds\" recalled Paul. \"...No I didn't\" he denied. \"Anyway, when I do go for a checkup with Mitchel, I want you to take care of my dogs\". \"I guess, since these mutts won me a fortune\" grumbled Paul. \"What?!\" cried Philippe. \"I hate that guy, I don't wanna stay with him!\" \"Relax, were'll sneak out\" said Francois. Back at the cave, Echo hatched up another plan. \"I have an amazing plan\" he said. \"Alpine distracts the bear while we get Shasta\". \"Me?! Distract him, how?\" stammered the white husky. \"Um...sing him a song\" suggested Echo. Baron and Anouk chortled. \"Me, sing?!\" exclaimed the female husky. \"Sing what, exactly?!\" \"I dunno, we're still in the holiday season, sing a Christmas song\". \"This I got to see\" laughed Baron, entering the cave. \"Hey, hairy, before you attack us, we've got a 'wonderful' present for you, sung by a 'magnificent' singer, get your hopes way high\". Alpine shot him an angry glare. \"Um...we wish you a merry Christmas\" she began singing softly. Baron snickered. \"We...wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year... As she continued distracting him, Echo, Akira and Anouk sneaked further on in the cave. \"You know it ain't wise to lose a puppy, and it's worse when you send the thing into a bears' cave\" complained Echo. \"Don't blame me, if you had never offered to train him we wouldn't be in this mess\" Akira shot back. \"You were the one who said you'd keep your eye on him\" Echo started on Anouk. \"And where did you go?\" he shot back. \"I just want you to know you idiots are the reason I'm gonna get eaten\". They found Shasta sleeping on a rock by the side of the cave. \"Don't startle him, you should never startle a sleeping puppy\" warned Echo. \"WAKE UP, CAN'T YOU SEE WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE!\" screamed Akira, making Shasta immediately wake up. \"Oh is the break over...sorry\" he wearily apologised. \"Save it till we get out of here\". They returned to the entrance, where Alpine had finished her song and the bear was sitting at the front. \"Great now what?\" said Akira. \"Distract him. Maybe Baron can give him so food\" suggested Anouk. \"He don't need food, look at him, I think that thing should stop eating\" insulted Akira. \"That's my whole point... Unknowingly to them, the bear was listening. \"Ok on the count of three, Shasta, we're gonna run past\" instructed Echo. \"One, two, thre- The bear suddenly turned around and attacked all three of them. He went for Akira first, while kicking Anouk around. Alpine quickly darted in and grabbed Shasta, while the bear turned it's attention to Echo and then Baron. Eventually, they escaped and the bear let out a hideous roar. \"Sorry, if I caused any trouble\" apologised Shasta, nervously turning his head away from them. \"How could you possible think that you- began Akira \"No, we should've paid more attention to you\" wheezed Echo. \"Anyway, I should probably go home now\" he decided. \"Yes, good idea\" the others quickly agreed. \"See you tomorrow\" the pup. \"TOMORROW!\" the others yelled. \"Right, tomorrow\" Echo nervously nodded. When he ran off, Akira declared \"I am not doing that again\".[Chapter 6] Echo and Alpine paced around the cold arctic, thinking about what to do about Shasta, The others had already expressed their dissatisfaction with what he was doing. \"What are we gonna do?\" wondered Echo. \"I can't teach him to be a lead dog, he's a pup. I'm not Talon the Great that I can do miracles like that\". \"Mainly because you exist\" said Alpine. \"Well the poor pup needs some guidance\". \"Wait a minute, I have a genius plan\" exclaimed Echo. \"I hope it's better than your bear rescue plan\". \"What we need to do is find Shasta a friend to play with- someone his age- and then he'll slowly forget about this foolish idea of racing and realise how hard it really is\". \"Where are we gonna find another pup to be his friend?\" \"What about your niece? Sara?\" \"You mean Sonya\" Alpine corrected him. \"Ah right, Sasha\". \"Sonya\". \"Whatever, you introduce Santa to Shasta and then he plays with her, stops annoying us, and we will be able to focus all our efforts on winning the next race\" planned out Echo, smiling deviously. \"Firstly, her names Sonya. Second, that might work, I'll go speak to her\" agreed Alpine The next day, Alpine was walking through town with Shasta, who was eager to continue practising with Echo. \"So where's Echo? I really think his efforts are working, I hope I become as great as him\" he idolised. Alpine guiltily laughed. \"Oh he's sick- terrible cold- and he won't be able to train you. But don't feel down, I found a friend for you to play with while Adam's at school, someone who will boost your confidence a bit\". \"Really who?!\" Shasta excitedly asked. \"Wait is this 'friend' going to just make fun of me cause of my parents?\" \"No, she's my niece, Sonya\" replied Alpine. She led him to a solitary house surrounded by snowy hills and grouped up logs. \"She should be somewhere here, when you find her say I sent you. I need to go help the others take care of Echo, have fun\". Shasta went around the side of the beautiful, small house. He looked around at the piles of logs and eventually found a small Siberian husky puppy sitting by herself, eating from a bowl. She was a slender husky, much like him, and being a female she was a bit smaller than him. Her fur was slightly lighter than his, and her eyes were both different in colour: one was blue and the other was black. Seeing him approach, she growled defensively and moved her bowl back. \"I'm not trying to steal from you\" he nervously explained, thinking this was perhaps the wrong dog. \"Alpine sent me\". Sonya stopped growling and put on a more friendly face. She moved closer to him and studied him. \"You're S-Shasta, am I saying that right?\" she asked. Shasta nodded slowly. \"Well hi, I'm Sonya, sorry about the rude greeting but a lot of dogs run past here and try and steal my breakfast. Like Jean George's dumb dog's\". \"Tell me about it, those guys are total jerks\" agreed Shasta. \"My aunt says you feel lonely, and I'm just the pup to help you with that\" she confidentially expressed. \"Follow me\". She sprinted off ahead of him and Shasta followed. Sonya led him to a huge mountain with chair lift's going up and down it. They hid behind the ticket booth, as it was closest to the approaching transportation's. It served as one of the many tourist attractions in the town, aside from watching the yearly races of course. \"Wow you sure run fast\" panted Shasta, surprised to see someone with as much stamina as him, since he had never been around another puppy before, just grown ones. \"Well duh, I'm a pup, maybe it's just that you're too slow\" she teased, following her remark with a smile, to assure him she was saying it as a friendly joke. \"Ever been on one of these?\" \"I've only seen them from a distance\" replied Shasta. \"Trust me, there's no way you can get bored on one of these things!\" she anxiously told him, excited to get on one of the lifts. \"Wait shouldn't we go up the mountain to get on?\" he wondered, noticing the steady line behind the mountain. \"This is the area you get off right?\" \"Why run up the mountain when there's a much easier way?\" she asked, staring at the chair lifts heading down. \"But don''t you run up mountain's in races?\" \"True...but why would we need to worry about that, we're too young for that\". \"But- \"Ok, keep an eye out for an empty chair lift\" Sonya instructed. After a while, Shasta spotted one labelled \"9\". \"I can see one, number 9!\" he pointed. \"Get ready, when it comes past we jump, got it?\" she explained. \"Wait what?\" Shasta was caught off guard by this new instruction...and he didn't have much time to think either. As the lift approached the ground, Sonya jumped on a nearby rock and leapt onto the lift, landing perfectly onto the comfy red chair. \"Come on, Shasta, jump!\" she yelled. Shasta took a deep breath, stretched out his legs and then ran forward and jumped into the air. His paws grabbed the edge of the chair, but luckily Sonya pulled him up. \"See, wasn't that hard?\" she smiled, sitting down. \"Piece of cake\" lied the male husky, joining her. \"You wanna know the best thing about being this high up?\" \"What?\" \"Look outside\" Sonya pointed to the beautiful horizon before them. Shasta's eyes were wide open, with the reflection of the illustrious clouds mixing with the blue colour of them. He could see everything: the mountains, the ground where he and Echo trained yesterday, the bear's cave, the school, the town, the sheriff's office. It was a truly amazing sight. \"I-It's amazing!\" he exclaimed. \"I know right, it's even better at night, you can see the Northern lights then\" she added. Shasta looked below him where all the humans looked like little ants compared to him. He thought he could make out Jean George racing past with his pack of huskies. \"Not so high and mighty now are you, Jean?\" he smirked. \"Wish I was this tall just so I could kick him back to France\" said Sonya. Meanwhile, in an alleyway behind the sheriff's office, Echo and his team were talking to Deputy Bernie. \"I don't know why a bear just barged into town, seemed awful angry\" Bernie went over an incident that just occurred. \"Someone must've interrupted it's hibernation\". \"What kind of jerk would do a thing like that?\" Baron guiltily laughed. \"That ain't suspicious laughter\" Akira commented, sarcastically, before turning to a worried Alpine. \"What's the matter, Alpine, you should be proud, you found the little weirdo a friend, now he can stop bugging us\". \"I know, it's just...I'm starting to regret sending Shasta with Sonya\" she admitted. \"Why, I thought you said she was a loner with no life or friends?\" remembered Akira. \"I didn't say it like that, Akira\" Alpine affirmed. \"It's just, Sonya has a tendency of getting into trouble, it's not really her fault, I mean she has no sibling's or parents to talk to when Emily's at school\". \"And if it's two troublemakers...\" began Baron, a bit tense, now realising Alpine's worries. \"Oh please how much trouble could those two get into?\" dismissed Echo, facing away from the others, looking at the sky instead. He then thought about what he just said. He turned around suddenly. \"On second thought, Baron go with Akira and Anouk and keep an eye on them\". \"Here we go again, I sense misery in the near future\" groaned Anouk, as the three left the alley. \"Yeah from us\" added Baron. \"Check the chair lifts, she loves hanging around there!\" called Alpine. \"The chair lifts? Of course, where else would they be?\" Akira asked, using his usual sarcasm.[Chapter 7] As the lift travelled closer to the top of the mountain, Sonya stopped daydreaming and quickly explained to Shasta what they need to do. \"Ready for the next part?\" she asked. \"Wait, there's more?\" said Shasta, confused since they were already so high up. \"There's gonna be two guards at the top, we need to quickly jump off before they see us-the no animals allowed rule\". Shasta was beginning to slightly regret going along with Sonya, as he never wanted to get himself in trouble with local authorities or anything like that. Also this seemed kinda reckless and dangerous. On top the mountain, the long line began progressing; several people got on the chairlifts that had already gotten up. Two security guards, one large and one tall one, watched over the cue and were responsible for helping people on and taking any belongings left behind on the lifts off and put in the lost and found (also on the mountain top). \"How many lost bags you found?\" asked the large one. \"What kind of question is that?\" the other, uninterested one responded. \"I'm just trying to make polite conversation, you know I hate this job!\" Number 9 got to the top. As the guards walked towards it, Sonya leapt out of her seat, followed by Shasta. \"It's her again!\" the large guard screamed. \"This time I'm gonna make sure it's the last\" vowed the annoyed tall guard. They gave chase, surrounding them behind the lost and found booth. Sonya ran under their legs, while the other guard chased Shasta. He went under Doctor Mitchel's legs, a 50 year old veterinarian/ doctor/ physiologist, and the tall guard hurled a net at him. \"What are you doing?!\" he frantically yelled. \"Sorry, doc, but it's that dog, I'm trying to catch that dog!\" grunted the guard, running, leaving Mitchel to untangle the net. Shasta ran towards his female friend, who purposely stood still by the time Shasta had reached her. \"I got em!\" both guards screamed. They both simultaneously jumped down and slid on the ground to get them but the two puppy's moved out the way, making the guards crash their heads into one another. Baron, Anouk and Akira walked up the high mountain, groaning and complaining, whilst tiredly continuing their journey. \"You know it's really dumb offering to train a puppy and it's even more dumb sending one trouble maker with another one!\" ranted Akira. \"No paw's should be pointed in my direction, we would be resting easy if this fool hadn't lost the pup\" Anouk centred the blame around Baron. \"I lost the pup? I lost the...oh well that's news to me!\" Baron retorted. \"Who told him to go sleep in a bear's cave?\" Akira reminded him. \"Who said we needed to talk alone!?\" shouted Baron. Akira couldn't argue there, so he silently raised his paw whilst grinning. \"This journey is a test of our strengths, the race will be much harder\" wheezed Anouk. Just then a loud voice interrupted their squabbling. \"YOU STUPID, FILTHY, MANGY TOILET DRINKING MUTTS!\" \"There up there\" huffed Baron, with his head down whilst raising his paw to point to the mountain top. His voice was both annoyed, and also expecting since he kinda figured Shasta out by this point. \"Of course they are, where else would they be?\" Akira continued his sarcastic remarks. On the mountain, the two guards continued chasing the dog's with no success- they just ended up getting themselves even more hurt- until finally they were cornered near the edge of the mountain. \"We got you now!\" laughed the large guard. Shasta was now 100% regretting going with Sonya or even talking to her in the first place, and even she was now a bit worried. Usually these two would be too dumb to catch up but after so many tries, they must've figured out a strategy. He could tell by her sudden scream that she too was at a loss for what to do. Anouk and the others reached the top and saw this situation. \"Oh boy\" he muttered, before charging ahead and biting the large man on the leg. \"AH! More dogs, get rid of them!\" screamed the large man, as he tumbled over. \"Shasta, this way!\" called Sonya, as she ran towards a chair lift heading down. They both quickly hopped on, surprising Doctor. Mitchel, who was next in line. \"Huh, that was my ride!\" he cursed. Baron and the others were cornered near the edge of the mountain as the two bumbling guards got to their feet. \"Great, now what?\" panicked Baron. Anouk looked down and saw how high they were. \"We're gonna jump\" he declared. \"Jump?! Are you crazy, we're like a hundred feet high!\" argued Akira. \"It's snow, we'll be fine. Now jump! JUMP!\" Anouk repeated himself several times. Akira closed his eyes and jumped, screaming. \"Jump on the count of three. One, two...just jump\" Anouk and a nervous Baron jumped off the edge, screaming. They crashed into the snow below. \"Huh, that was soft\" said Baron, covered in snow. \"Get off me!\" Akira kicked him off, him to buried under the snow. \"I hate my life\". The two mischievous pup's returned to Emily's house, laughing. \"That was the most fun I've had in ages\" laughed Shasta. He hadn't really laughed much since his parent's death and it felt great to get back to his usual mood. \"For your first time on those things, you did great\" Sonya praised him. \"I hope Baron and the others are ok\" Shasta suddenly stopped laughing to think about his saviours. \"Don't worry, my aunt says they're the fastest dogs she knows, I'm sure they'll be fine\" Sonya assured him. After a while, Shasta asked, \"So you know you said pup's can't race...?\" \"Well I mean, it sounds cool but...no one's ever done it before, I'm sure it would be awfully great to win one of those races or at least come second\" she admitted, saying the part about the race a bit more quietly. Shasta began to think about that. He could continue training and live up to the legacy of his dad, but at the same time he didn't want to miss out on all the fun that being a puppy was. Those times won't last forever, and having all those responsibilities is hard. But what about Adam, his class bully's him because of what happened to his dad and his only goal in life is to race and win. \"Anyway, thanks for today, it was really fun\" he once again thanked his new friend, before walking away. \"Wait\" Sonya called to him, making him turn. \"You do want to do this again right...I mean, hang out again?\" \"Yeah sure...if you don't mind\". \"Of course I don't, anyway see you later you little skunk\" she joked, calling him a skunk because of the colour of his fur. \"Just don't kill my eardrums when you scream\" he taunted back, recalling when Sonya screamed when the guards cornered them. A couple days later, Shasta found Echo walking through town. He had tried to remain hidden to keep up with the lie that he was ill. \"Echo, I'm so glad your better sir, I'm ready to start training again, if that's ok\" he eagerly greeted him. \"Er...well...hi Shasta\" Echo was at a loss for words. He asked a question, he could easily say no. But how could he say no to that face. \"Um, yes, I'll go get the others... Over the next few days, Shasta continued playing with Sonya and training with Echo. Both had bad results, and Sonya seemed like a bad influence on Shasta. He didnt see it that way, in his opinion, she was the perfect friend for someone like him. They both had no parents, were the same age, extremely fast, feisty (especially in Sonya's case) and had a very high stamina. Sonya wasn't too girly but wasn't too disobedient. Although, she did a lot of things that her aunt told her not to and hardly took anything seriously. The dogs were disliking \"teaching\" Shasta and got more annoyed as he once again got them in trouble with the bear, that chased them across town. Shasta and Sonya accidentally tripped up Jean George, causing him to get in trouble with the bear when he gave chase. Soon, Paul and Mitchel joined in, remembering how they stole his seat and mayhem occurred. Akira watched this montage play out with disgust. Paul and LT. Toff's took out their guns and pointed it at the bear. Toffs quickly stared at Paul, who hid the weapon behind his back as he wasn't allowed to possess one. Not that it made a difference, Toffs one was out of ammo and the bear growled fiercely at them, making them run (only the two idiots ran into each other at first then in different directions). Toffs spent the remainder of this montage trying to stand up without slipping, resorting to his Shadow trooper outfit in an attempt to scare the bear. Shasta finally made it on top of a large hill and when the others followed him up to reluctantly congratulate him, Shasta spied some berries on a skinny tree and went for them. The delicate tree toppled over and Echo and his team immediately switched directions, running down the hill, as the tree tumbled after them. Although hill-running had improved his main problem was ice, and his fear of it. The bear chased the humans and pup's until they all (including the bear) came to a halt as LT. Toffs walked past wearing the Shadow helmet this time. They all gave military salutes to him (even the pup's put their paws up) but once he walked past them and returned their salute the chase continued. Toffs stood in front of the bear, demanding to know why he didn't give a salute. The confused bear stood up tall on two legs and complied, using his paws, watching the lieutenant walk off with a dopey look on his face. Jean George, Paul, Mitchel, and Toffs chased Shasta and Sonya outside the sheriff's office but (like they did on the mountain) they stood still and the four clowns all fell into one another, tumbling onto the ground as the huskies escaped. The tree crashed into the fleeing dogs, sending them flying. Shasta guiltily stood over the collapsed huskies, apologising. Akira tried angrily protesting but Echo just stopped him and dismissed the apologies nicely. All the while Akira got more agitated and knew something had to be done.[Chapter 8] Finally today was field trip day. Adam's class was lining up patiently outside their school for the mini-bus to arrive, and when it did the teacher finally told them their groups. Adam was to be in a group consisting of two other people, a friendly boy called Ferdinand and Emily (Sonya's owner). Fred decided to continue his teasing before they left. \"So Ferdinand, you don't mind being in a group with two girls?\" he grinned. \"Two?\" he questioned. \"Oh sorry, that's Adam, he should really cut his hair\" Fred continued jeering. This time, Adam ignored him and forced his ears to pay more attention to what the teacher said about the mountain and what they would be doing there. Finally, they got in (after she explained her behaviour expectations for about the fifth time). As the mini-bus began leaving town, one of Fred's paper balls that him and his friends were throwing around hit him on the head, making the others laugh. The poor boy turned his head to face out the window but then noticed something unusual. It was snowing. Actually, not unusual, but this time it was accompanied by grey clouds in the distant horizon. Sheriff Ryan walked through the main street with his trusty dog, Bernie, when he too noticed the cold weather, light snow and smokey grey clouds now engulfing the skies above. He entered the sheriff's office, where Toff's was spraying his uniform after that bear's odour made it stink. \"I hate bear's in general, can we make a bear warrant were it makes it ok to arrest bears?\" he cursed, slipping over again, and the spray fell on his head. \"Ow\". \"Maybe you should take that thing off, it's horrible you got it on that huge digital fashion shop\" suggested Ryan. \"You mean Ebay? And no, not now anyway with all this wind\" rejected Toffs. \"Hey can you check the weather forecast, you know how I am with these fancy devices\" asked the sheriff, muttering \"what ever happened to the newspaper?\". \"Last time I checked it said clear skies, but I'll double check\" said the lieutenant, hoping on the wheeling chair and riding it to the desk. He began checking the computer, as Sheriff Ryan picked up a pile of books. \"Lets see...oh my God!\" he cried, making the sheriff drop his books on the floor. \"What?!\" \"Massive snow storm unexpectedly changes direction from Siberia towards the Bering sea, and heading to Alaska!\" he shouted. \"'Temperatures expected to fall below -60 degrees, urgent preparation required'!\" \"B-But I thought the storm from Siberia was supposed to head to China?\" \"Like it said, it was unexpected it made a turn and headed forward again\". \"But the trip!\" realised the sheriff. \"Call it off quickly before they leave\". \"They already have\" the sheriff's pale face stilled. Shasta hadn't seen Echo and Alpine in a couple of days and, although he hated to admit the fact that his friendship with Sonya was much better than doing hard work, was still as eager as ever to continue trying to be like his father and Echo, something which completely contradicted what Echo expected to happen. He walked through the main street, where people were frantically heading towards their homes and cars were all parked, as news of the approaching storm spread. Soon, he thought he heard Anouk's voice coming from a nearby alley. He ran over to it but before he could run in to surprise them, he heard them mention his name. \"I don't mean to personally offend you, but I'm about to personally offend you- your plan sucks\" admitted Anouk to Echo, not usually one for such harsh language and informality. \"Shasta is still coming back, like a little cockroach- you can never fully get rid of it\". \"We've been beaten, bruised, attacked by bears, chased of the edge of a mountain...oh and lets not mention we do not have the strength to continue our OWN training\" listed an annoyed Baron. Akira wasn't present, he had devised his own plan to dispose of Shasta. \"Look I know it's bad, really really bad but will you just shut up and follow the plan?\" barked Echo. \"Clearly him and Sally- \"Sonya\" Alpine corrected for like the tenth time. \"-Whatever, those two are getting along slowly my plan will grow in to fruition\". \"Plan? What plan?\" Shasta asked himself. \"Why does the little freak want to race, he's a puppy? Akira was right. If him and that boy do they'll wet themselves\" joked Baron, hiding his annoyance. \"I'm telling you he's unteachable; useless\". \"Face it Echo, he wants to be like you but what he fails to see is that you cannot make him you\" said Anouk. \"Can you blame him, he has no parents; no role models except- began Alpine. \"Who, us? Well he can find someone else, I don't remember signing up to be a babysitter\" interrupted Baron. \"I know, but trust me, soon enough this plan will work and then we can end the pre-school adventures and continue with OUR goal, the one that WE can achieve\" promised Echo. These words really hurt Shasta, the dog that he had looked up to almost as much as his father was here ranting about how unteachable and useless he is. With nothing to say, Shasta just walked off, once again sad and alone. Francois and Philippe walked through the cold streets. \"This sucks\" commented Philippe. \"Dealing with Paul's dog is better than staying out in this weather\". \"I immediately regret this decision, let's go back to Paul's\" regretted Francois. Suddenly, Akira approached them. \"Oh look who it is\" Francois rolled his eyes. \"How's training that little pupsqueak, I heard he got you in some big trouble on the chair-lifts\". Philippe laughed. \"Don't remind me\" growled Akira. \"I am here to make a proposition, I need you to help me get rid of the little runt. Echo won't tell him to go, he's to soft, that is why I need other help to make him leave us alone. No way am I training the son of my enemy, the one who caused me to live in the streets, to be get a role more higher than mine. \"...Interesting\" hummed Francois. \"You could try scaring him out of it. Something really scary that will traumatise him, making him hate the sport\". \"Isn't his parents dying traumatising enough?\" \"Yes but he didn't see it himself\" said Philippe. \"Once he sees how dangerous it really is, he'll hate it\". \"Such as telling him that old tale of Talon the Great and how he ran down the race course all the way to the mountains that he supposedly lives in\" continued Francois. \"Tell him that he can instantly become a lead dog by doing that legend\". \"Ah, that's so evil it just might work\" grinned Akira, running off the find Shasta. \"No seriously can we go now?\" demanded Philippe after he left. Akira found Shasta outside his house, with his head leaning against his paws, holding back tears. \"Hello there Shasta, how are you today?\" he greeted, putting on a fake happy voice. He didn't reply nor look up. \"Should you not be with Echo at this time to continue your training?\" \"You don't have to pretend anymore, I know you think I just get you in trouble and that I'm just...unteachable; useless\" he quietly whimpered. \"Oh how dare my comrades try to dishearten you with their back-biting, they are the ones who get themselves in trouble\" condemned the Alaskan dog, muttering \"by trying to help you\". \"What's the point anyway, it's just a dumb sport\" muttered the puppy. But Akira knew Echo would once again take pity on him and agree to help him, he was too soft to throw him under the bus like that. \"Nonsense, I can teach you in less than a day!\" protested Akira. \"You've heard of the legend of Talon, right?\" \"No\" replied Shasta, glumly. \"Well, there was a...uh legend ary dog, Talon, who raced throughout the entire course and then straight toward Mt. Amerock, in less than two days, earning him the status of greatest lead dog\" explained Akira, leaving out the part where it was considered to be nothing but a myth. \"You do that, and you too can become a lead dog, perhaps one of the best, better than Echo...and as good as your father. You want to make your parents proud, right? And poor Adam to?\" Shasta sprung to his feet, excited. \"Really?! Where do I begin?!\" \"I'll show you the start of the race course\" grinned Akira, wickedly. Akira led him to the outskirts of town, to where the starting line of the race is normally located. As he did, Sonya spotted him and decided to follow. \"Now, once you exit the forest, continue running until you find Mt. Amerock, piece of cake\" explained Akira. \"I know you can do it, Shasta, good luck\". When he ran off, Sonya went to her friend. \"Shasta, what do you think your doing? Have you seen the weather?\" she exclaimed. \"I don't care, I'm running to this mountain\" he declared. \"What, are you mad?!\" the female husky cried. \"Look Sonya...I'm tired of me and Adam being picked on because of what happened to our parents, I can't live with that over my head forever\" he explained. \"I can't expect you to understand, your the complete opposite of me, in a good way\". Sonya thought about that. She actually did understand, more than Shasta knew, she understood everything he said. \"Shasta- \"I'm going and you can't stop me\" \"I know...that's why I'm going with you\" she decided. \"What? You yourself said it was to dangerous, especially for a- \"- for a girl?\" she snarled. \"Do you even know the way to Mt. Amerock or through this course for that matter? I do, my mum explained it to me like a million times\". Shasta thought there was no point arguing with her so accepted her decision. \"Ok, just try not to scream\" teased Shasta, trying to get back to the flow of their usual antics, rather than arguing. \"Well if I let my only friend die, I'll become as lonely and boring as you\" she smiled back. The two began their trek, running through the furious wind and into the usual race course.[Chapter 9] Shasta and Sonya sprinted vigorously down the long, snow covered path in front of them, getting into somewhat of a game to see who could take the lead. Shasta was at first allowing her to take the lead, since she was the one navigating them through this difficult track, but after she taunted him about how slow he is, the two got into a friendly competition. \"And he takes the lead, once again!\" Shasta remarked, running ahead of Sonya. The female pup spied a tilted dead log leaning on the top of a snow covered platform. She ran up it, along the trunk, and jumped down, landing ahead of Shasta once again putting her in the lead spot. \"You were saying\" she smirked to him, running ahead. \"Keep up your cocky attitude, it's helping me beat you, as usual\". \"Hey that's cheating!\" protested Shasta. \"Zorry but in sport only ze best vin!\" she returned, putting on a fake French accent to mock Francois and Philippe, who always repeat that whenever they are accused of cheating. \"How much further till we get to the forest?\" asked Shasta. \"We're already here\" Sonya answered, skidding to a stop outside a collection of massive, snow covered bushy trees. Several paths were cleared right through the middle of them to allow racers to mush right through them. \"This is where Jean usually pulls his tricks, no one notices in these huge woods\". \"Sonya...?\" a sudden thought hit Shasta, something that he really wanted to know about his friend. \"I don't want to start a sensitive topic or anything, but how exactly did your parents die?\" \"Avalanche, in the same mountains we're going to now\" she told him. \"They were looking for something or someone and then...they never came back\". The snow began drizzling down a lot more faster and rapidly that it was before. The grey clouds had fully consumed the sky and were only getting darker. Although it hadn't completely arrived yet, signs of the approaching storm had. \"It's starting to snow quite a bit, maybe we should turn back\" admitted Shasta, realising the danger presented with the snow. \"We don't know how heavy it's gonna be\". \"What? We're huskies, we're practically made for this weather\" argued Sonya. \"We can't stop now, we've already made it to the forest\". Shasta didn't argue, no matter how much he wanted to. The confidence he had gained from hanging around with Sonya had motivated him to be more care-free, a trait which he put on hold since his parent's death. However, he noticed the determined look in her eyes resembling the same one in his. \"Sonya, can I ask you another question?\" asked Shasta. \"Are you doing this because you, yourself, want to be a sled dog just as much as me?\" \"...Yeah, I've been wanting to for ages\" she finally confessed after a heavy sigh. \"But, like you, I don't have anyone to help me, I just muck around when I'm bored cause I've got nothing to be excited about\". So she really did understand then. Besides it's a stupid idea anyway, five other dog's aren't gonna fall from the sky\". \"Four\". \"I'm pretty sure it's five\" puzzled Sonya. \"Who else would I make a navigator if not you?\" questioned the male husky, smiling. \"I mean we're both doing this thing, right? So that means we're both gonna become sled dogs. You're already pretty good at finding your way around\". \"Really?!\" \"Of course\". \"Thanks, Shasta!\" she cried. \"My aunt was right about you, you really are unpredictable...in a good way\". Meanwhile on the top of Mt. Amerock, Adam's group were exploring the very top of the desolate mountain, writing down notes and answering the questions on it's structure and other geographical terms. Luckily, Talon had seen the approaching bus and fled before they got off, so his secret home was safe for now. \"Aw man it's beginning to snow!\" complained Ferdinand, covering his paper from the snow with Emily's scarf, although she just tugged it back making him drop his sheet. \"BOO!\" screamed Fred and his friends from behind the mountain side, making them jump. \"Fred you idiot don't scare us up here, we could accidentally fall!\" shouted Emily. \"Yeah yeah\" he rolled his eyes dismissively. \"I was just wondering if you babies would like to swap positions, let us be up here and you losers go down there to take notes\". \"What no way, we were here first\" refused Adam, knowing he was up to something. \"Whoa!\" glared Fred's friend, looking at the massive amounts of open land through the cave in the mountain top. It revealed the entire eastern side of the mountain, with nothing but miles of snow, dangerous mountains and icy cold open sea. \"I ain't going there, Fred, I'm telling you now\". \"Hey I don't want to die, I'm not going there\" his friend agreed. Adam then thought of something. If he could do something that Fred was too scared to, everyone would stop bullying him and treat him with respect. \"I'll do it, doesn't seem so hard\" he volunteered. \"What?!\" Emily and Ferdinand cried. The others laughed as Adam went forward. Suddenly, as he reached the edge of the mountain side, the heavy winds finally blew in, unleashing the full strength of the storm upon Alaska. The wind's pushed Adam back as he tried returning to the cave, and the edge cracked, making him fall off the mountain. \"Adam!\" the others yelled. \"Uh-oh\" muttered Fred. \"Quickly we've got to tell the teacher!\" said Emily, as they ran back down. Sheriff Ryan was talking to Adam's dad when his phone rang. He answered it to a frantic teacher who was explaining the situation to him. The storm had completely blocked the mountain side, so they couldn't go rescue Adam themselves. \"Oh my god, I'll be there right away!\" he promised, hanging up. \"Wait, Adam's in danger!?\" cried Joe. \"I'm gonna go check it out\" the sheriff answered, getting his snow speeder ready. \"I'm going with you, if my son's in trouble I'm going!\" Joe declared. \"No, in this storm it's too dangerous for you to go outside\" argued the sheriff. \"But- \"I will handle it, trust me\". Akira walked through town, being hit by the wind and snow when Bernie approached him. \"Oh hey Akira, I was wondering if you've seen Shasta anywhere?\" he asked. \"Not since Tuesday\" lied Akira. \"Well you see Adam's been hurt in this freak snow storm and I'm just afraid he might go after him or something, you know how he's like\" chuckled Bernie. \"Can you keep him out of trouble until we're back?\" \"Snow storm!?\" \"Yes, just hit randomly today\" repeated the Saint. Bernard. \"Luckily there's no races on, could you imagine running down that track in this snow?\" Akira could imagine that because he literally just sent Shasta down there. His eyes were death pale and he immediately ran off to find Echo. \"Where's Akira?\" wondered Alpine. \"He'll be back soon, I'm sure\" said Echo. \"Come to think of it, I haven't seen Shasta all day either\". \"Haven't seen Sonya either, they're probably together\" sighed Alpine. \"Doubtful, only fools would be out in this weather\" argued Baron. \"So why are we out here then- in this weather?\" chuckled Anouk. \"We must be fools then\" snickered the brown husky. Akira ran towards them. \"Come on lets go inside\". \"Ah there you are, what kept you?\" asked Echo. \"It's Shasta...he's running to Mt. Amerock using via the race course\" he panted. \"WHAT?!\" they all shrieked. \"Sonya must've gone with him, she knows that course of by heart\" realised Alpine. \"Why didn't you do anything?!\" demanded Echo. \"It was Francois and Philippe...they told Shasta Adam was hurt in their little trip to the mountain\" lied Akira, covering up his actions. \"Are you all deaf...move!\" ordered Echo, running past the sheriff's office to see Deputy Bernie was gone. \"Huh?\" He ran up to Jean George's dog's who were walking past. \"You fools!\" he scolded. \"You've just sent two puppies down a death road in a storm...what kind of comedy is that? No seriously, I'd like to know\". \"What storm?\" questioned Francois, eyeing Akira, hoping he would come to their assist. \"I didn't know there was a storm, did you know that?\" Philippe added. Francois shook his head. \"I don't know that course, but you do, so you're gonna lead us down there to get Shasta or I'm telling Deputy Bernie\" demanded Echo, growling. \"...\" \"You'd better or WE'RE all gonna be in trouble\" Akira hinted to them about the three of there's problem. \"You are correct; know that track of by heart we do\" agreed Francois. \"Follow us\". Lieutenant Toffs got into his ambulance an prepared to follow the sheriff, who had already left with his trusty rescue dog. Suddenly, Joe stopped him. \"What is it?\" the annoyed lieutenant asked. \"I need to go stop someone from dying\". \"That's my son whose hurt! Please, sir, take me with you, if anything happen to him- \"...Ugh fine, get in, I'm heading there anyway\" he gave in. When Joe got in, he looked at his Shadow trooper uniform with a strange expression. \"What?\" \"What's this?\" \"It's a very cool Shadow trooper suit\" defended Toffs. \"Isn't it hard to walk in that?\" \"Don't we have somewhere to go\" \"Oh right my son'a in trouble, lets go\" urged Joe, remembering the current task. They then spotted the group of huskies running towards the exit. \"Hey isn't that that Russian guy's dogs?\" \"I have no time to tell him\" declared Toffs. \"Oh wait...he gave me his number!\" remembered Joe, taking out the paper and his phone. Doctor Mitchel and Paul exited the his house. \"Thanks for checking on my dog, doc, now I know why he won't eat\" thanked Paul. \"No problem. Hey, isn't that Jean's dog's?\" Mitchel spotted Francois and Philippe leading the others out of town. \"It is..and their leaving town...I'm supposed to be looking after them\" Paul gulped. Jean George then approached them. \"Oh hi Jean, I was just talking about you\" stammered Paul. \"This clown lost your dogs; they've just run out of town in the direction of the race course\" interrupted Mitchel, gaining a dirty look from Paul. \"WHAT?! Some dog-sitter you are!\" Jean shouted. \"How can I race without my two leads?!\" He quickly dashed to the rest of his sled team and wiped them into getting up. \"Come on you lazy mutts mush!\" he called out to them; an extra player had joined this mess. \"Jean's never gonna talk to me if his dogs die, I'd better go help\" grumbled Paul, entering his truck. \"In that case, I'd better come along to, I am a doctor\" decided Mitchel, getting inside as well. \"Oh yeah after you snitched me up\" said Paul sarcastically. As they drove towards the exit, they were stopped by the Russian man who stood in front of the van waving his hands for them to stop. Paul nearly ran him over. \"Oi, what's the big idea, I'm trying to drive, you complete nut!\" \"My dogs have run out of town, can you take me with you so I can get them\" he explained. \"I think we saw them, fine only cause we're heading there too\" Paul eventually agreed (his first time being nice..sought of). \"No room up here, sit in the back\". As Paul and Mitchel laughed evilly, the Russian sat in the back, cramped cargo area of the van, where lots of tools were scattered around. And as the van drove, the tools scattered everywhere hitting the poor man. On the bleak, high mountain in the lowlands, the spy bug's red eyes switched to green, alerting the duo of evil that their time was now.[Chapter 10] Toff's ambulance was struggling to drive as more and more heavy snow attacked it from all sides. \"Can't this thing go any faster?\" demanded Joe. \"Well we can't abandon it, it is what's going to tend to your son's injuries- not saying there will be any but there is a huuuuge chance there will be\" replied Toffs. Adam's dad looked pale and terrified. \"This blasted snow doesn't make it any better!\" The huskies ran towards the end the forest and soon stopped, as the wind pushed them back. \"Ugh, how can we run in this wind?\" complained Baron. \"Be as fast as the wind in order to defeat it; move like the wind\" advised the wise Anouk. \"That's physically impossible!\" retorted Baron. \"That literally makes no sense!\" added Francois. \"Come on we're wasting too much time here, lets move!\" urged Akira. \"Oh now he starts to be guilty\" muttered Philippe. Unfortunately, Echo heard it. \"What do you mean 'starts to be guilty'?\" he demanded. The others looked to Akira. \"Akira...don't tell me you had anything to do with this?\" \"Fine, I admit it, you were starting to drag us all down by helping Shasta...become a lead dog. A position higher than mine, a position that I once had before his father defeated me; my owner abandoned me to the streets for so long and I couldn't stand to see the son of my enemy become something greater\" confessed the husky, avoiding eye contact with any of them. The others were speechless (all except for the French dogs of course). After a while, Echo said, with his head down in disappointment, \"Akira you have sent two innocent puppies- \"-What do you mean 'he sent them'? Akira told us the little creature was already upset because he heard you talking about how much you hated him, otherwise he wouldn't have even listened to us?\" Francois interrupted. \"We'll talk about this later\" Echo quietly said, deep down agreeing with the French dog's. \"Someone here has a big mouth\" insulted Anouk, not knowing it was actually him that Shasta first heard. \"You have done committed a greater evil by lying to him all this time, not saying I wouldn't do the same thing to him, but I just think it's wrong to fully blame Akira\" added Philippe. \"Again, not saying I wouldn't have done the same thing\". Shasta and Sonya finally arrived at the massive hill overlooking the bus down below. The hill had a cafe on it, where the teachers were chilling while the class conducted their field investigation. Both were out of breath, panting, sweating and too tired to continue. \"We've made it...half-way through\" panted Shasta. \"And that's it\". \"...What do you mean...that's it?\" asked Sonya in between her deep breaths. \"I'm not taking you in this weather any further, it's too dangerous\" he declared. \"I think we should sneak aboard the bus and hitch a ride home\". \"So I guess you won't become like you're father...like you wanted to?\" she quietly summarised, making sure he understood what he was doing. \"Yeah...but it's not worth getting killed over\" Shasta nodded. \"Guess I won't be a lead dog just yet\". \"I still think you are; in my opinion, you are without doubt the best sled dog I've ever seen\" Sonya complimented him, hoping to cheer him up. \"Thanks\" smiled Shasta out of embarrassment. Then she did something unexpected, the female pup went closer to Shasta and nuzzled him, hoping to destroy his grief. He slightly turned red and felt his heart beat faster than usual, before she stopped. They got down the hill and hid behind the mini-bus as the teachers panicked. They had quickly got all the children on to the mini-bus so they could stay warm as they awaited the sheriff's arrival. \"This is taking forever, let's just go rescue Adam ourselves!\" the impatient teacher groaned. \"He could be seriously injured!\" \"Wait Adam's in trouble!?\" cried Shasta, his ears perking as the teachers talked. \"That avalanche covered the entire mountain side, we won't be able to get through\" the headteacher reminded him. \"I'm going after him!\" decided Shasta, turning to run toward the mountain before being stopped by Sonya. \"Wait Shasta, stop and think for a minute\" she quickly calmed him, knowing his quickness in making decisions. \"I have to help him!\" \"I know, but we can't go that way the avalanche is blocking it, we have to go the long way\" she explained to him. \"'we'? Sonya, look I'm telling you this is too dangerous, I think you should sneak on board the bus and return with the others\" argued the male husky. \"No way\" she refused. \"I'm not leaving you in this weather, like you said you could die out here, you don't even know the route\". \"Are you sure?\" Shasta asked again. \"I'm with you, 100%\" she affirmed. Shasta knew it was pointless arguing with her so agreed. But a faint smile came across his face knowing that, even in such a difficult situation, he had a loyal friend to support him. \"After you, then\". Sheriff Ryan arrived soon afterwards on his snow speeder with Bernie by his side. \"Sheriff, an avalanche just happened and now the entire mountain side is pilled with snow!\" \"We're gonna have to go the long way\" cursed Ryan, turning to see Toffs arrival. \"Where's my son?\" demanded Joe. \"Wait we're did you- began Ryan, surprised to see Adam's dad here. \"He's trapped on the other side of the mountain\" said the headteacher. \"By the way this wasn't my fault...you can't sue me, just cause I was inside drinking coffee while everything else happened\". \"Sheriff, I think there's been an avalanche\" realised Toffs. \"Really?\" the sheriff retorted sarcastically. \"Return to your vehicle, we're gonna have to change direction\". He turned to the head teacher. \"I suggest you take the kid's back to town, soon it's gonna reach -60 degrees\".[Chapter 11] Through the blinding, heavy storm, two terrifying figures emerged. \"So you were right, there is a storm and a bad one at that\" the hooded skeleton glared with displeasure. \"Now we just need to find the right area\" said Dark Blade. \"What!? You mean you still don't know where we're going?\" questioned Death, frustrated. \"Why do I keep getting involved with you?!\" \"Shut up and let me think!\" hissed Blade. \"It's in a cave system surrounded by mountains I remember that, we just need to search, it shouldn't be that hard\". \"And if we bump into anyone?\" asked Death, clutching his blaster. \"Shoot first?\" \"You idiot, we cannot leave any evidence behind, no one must learn of our existence!\" refused Blade. \"And if they see us?\" \"Hm...ok then we kill them\". Jean George lashed out to his dogs with his whip, encouraging them to run faster. Of course with his two main lead dogs missing he wasn't at his usual fast pace. Luckily his dogs were picking up the scent of their leaders and were leading their master in the right direction, through the forest. \"Faster, go, move you mangy mutts!\" shouted Jean, embracing the moment of danger by whipping his dogs once more. \"It's too late to turn back now! Hahahahahahahaahahahaha!\" Paul's truck was having difficulties in driving through the race, a course which was never suited for heavy vehicles to travel on. The poor Russian man was tumbling all over the place as paint splashed on him and heavy tools whacked him. \"Move it, move it, your driving too slow!\" complained Dr. Mitchel. \"How can we go anywhere when you're driving like my grandma!?\" \"You wanna drive!?\" yelled Paul. \"No\" answered the doctor. \"No? Then shut up!\" Paul snapped. \"Fine; you're good with the wheel, you drive\" Mitchel backed down. \"Could you drive more carefully?\" pleaded the Russian man, as a paint can hit him. \"Did you hear something?\" Paul pretended not to hear, inserting a rock'n'roll tape into the van's radio. Paul began driving even more recklessly now, waving his hands into the air, his eyes half closed and half-wide, jamming to his song. The Russian man fell all around the back area of the truck, separated from the view of the front by a metal wall. He screamed as a tool box flew towards his face. \"The road! Watch the bloody road!\" panicked Mitchel. \"Oh yeah this is my jam!\" Paul continued not paying attention. \"Maybe I should drive\" sighed the doctor. The huskies ran out of the forest and were now in full view of the mountains that confronted them. \"Which way now?\" asked Echo as the wind smashed against his face. \"We need to turn left and get out of this race course, then forward towards those mountains\" explained Francois. \"Alpine I suggest you go back to town in case they have already\" suggested Echo. \"No way, Sonya is my responsibility, I can't let anything happen to her, I'm her only family\" she refused. \"The wind is getting worse!\" moaned Baron. \"And it ain't getting any clearer\" added Philippe. \"Perhaps we should all turn back before conditions deteriorate further\" advised Anouk. Akira barged ahead of them and eyed the mountains as if they were challenging him. \"It's too late to turn back now\" he declared, unknowing that he paraphrasing Jean George. \"Racing is the day we all live for! Lets do what we're good at and run!\" \"Oh looks like Mr. Guilty finally has a heart\" Baron rolled his eyes. \"He's right\" agreed Echo, his first words to Akira since is revelation earlier. \"Ugh, it will all end in tears mark my words\" grunted Philippe, before the seven continued their own trek. Sonya and Shasta ran as fast as they could through a massive snowy canyon comprised of dozens of mountains and hills. The ground was more rougher and the snow had a greater impact considering how low this area was compared to the race course. Shasta was a bit surprised that he had overtaken an excellent runner like Sonya, who's own vision began deteriorating in these freezing cold conditions. \"Having trouble?\" he taunted at her, before turning again and realising from the expression on her face that she was actually feeling the impact of this storm. \"Sonya are you ok?\" \"I-I'm fine\" she shivered. \"It's just blurry eyesight, it'll pass\". \"Are you sure?\" \"Yes\" she affirmed. \"Now shouldn't we get a move on\". Shasta agreed, continuing running, despite feeling a lot of fear for what could happen to both Adam and Sonya out here. As they continued running, Dark Blade and Death pushed their way through the wind and hail, walking menacingly along the hills in this lowland area as well. Suddenly, Sonya stubbed her front paw against a hard stone buried in the snow and let out an agonising cry. \"Sonya!\" Shasta turned around to help his friend. He gently lifted her injured paw and examined it. It looked bruised. \"Are you ok? How bad is it?\" \"Shasta, I think you're gonna have to go on without me, I'll just drag you down like this\" she insisted. \"I'll catch up, I promise, just go on ahead. You can see the mountain from here, it's not that far\". She used her free paw to point to the gigantic Mt. Amerock which was bigger than the others. \"I can't leave you out here!\" refused Shasta. \"Shasta, there's no time to argue, you can't leave Adam out here in this weather either\" argued the female puppy. \"I'll be right behind you, I know this course well, remember? I'll..just rest in that cave over there\". \"...Ok fine, be careful\" Shasta finally gave in despite the massive amount of concern he had over leaving her out here in this godforsaken place. Shasta watched Sonya walk towards the large cave to her right, lifting her injured paw, before running ahead. Blade and Death turned right and walked along the mountain side to observe to canyon below them. Shasta kept on running, before halting as he heard a loud bear growl, possibly the one he encountered before with Echo and the others. A great deal of regret and paranoia swept over him. \"No, I shouldn't have left her like this\" he regretted, turning back. Death looked to the large cave below. \"There?\" he beckoned to Dark Blade, who he soon saw had teleported down below regardless. Death joined him. \"Possibly\" replied the phantom, entering it. Sonya carried her slightly better paw to the entrance of the cave, before seeing the shadows of two abnormal figures entering and quickly hid behind a rock. She heard the two chilling voices discuss before they left. \"Nothing!\" \"Hm, no I remember it having more mountains surrounding it\" Sonya peeped her small head over the rock and looked at these two terrifying creatures. \"What are those?\" she whispered to herself. She exited the cave, hiding behind another rock on the outside. \"Where is that boy?\" she wondered, thinking about Shasta and if these two had gotten hold of him, which was her biggest fear at the moment. Death suddenly turned his skull and glowing red eyes forward, to see a silhouette of a small husky puppy, walking. Shasta stopped at this area, looking around for Sonya but couldn't find any trace of her. The snow and wind and hail before him blinded his vision and he couldn't see either one of the ghouls but they could see him. \"Sonya!\" he called out into the air. Sonya heard him and so did the figures; she was too scared to move, although she tried not to show it. \"Look, that things spotted us!\" panicked Death, stepping behind Blade. \"He's making noises, he must be alerting others to him\". \"Interesting\" noted Blade. \"Well...now we can kill\". Death took out his blaster and aimed it forward at the husky. Sonya glared at this weapon with her wide, double-coloured eyes understanding that they intend to shoot at Shasta. She had to do something to save her friend... \"Well shoot!\" ordered Blade. Something was preventing the ghoul from doing so; something was holding him back. He looked at the small creature, his finger tip at the end of the trigger, pretending that he was wiping snow of his eyes to get a better view. \"He's a puppy, Blade\" \"I don't care, fire at him! Fire; kill him; please kill him!\" ...could she stand a chance against them? She didn't care, she had to save Shasta from that gunshot. But... \"Ready, aim, fir- \"I KNOW HOW TO SHOOT!\" yelled Death, lifting his gun up again. ...Run. \"Hey, leave him alone!\" Sonya cried, running forward. Sonya sprinted forward, jumping and gripping hold of Death's blaster as he raised it and then jumped on his robe. \"Help, I'm being attacked by a savage beast!\" he shrieked. Shasta heard the bear growl again and decided to move on a bit. \"You got her, Death. Left, no right, right, this way!\" he 'encouraged', although he wasn't helping much. Sonya jumped on his hooded head as Death tried shaking her off. \"Shoot, you have a gun; kill her!\" Blade swung his blades at him to try and get the puppy, but Death dodged all his blows thinking they were gonna hit him instead. \"Left, no right, this way, lead her toward me; right; up. Use your gun you fool!\" \"YOU'RE DRIVING ME NUTS!\" screamed Death, before the small husky ran onto his hooded head. Blade threw a punch at her but missed and hit Death instead, making him fall to the ground. Sonya ran along him, and Blade used his foot to trample all over Death in a bid to get her. His foot eventually hit the skeleton's pelvis, making him let out another scream. \"She's getting away!\" shouted Blade, giving chase. Sonya tried running, but her bruised paw caused her to fall repeatedly. \"Oh, Shasta please be ok\" she quietly prayed. Death picked up his gun from the snow, aimed at her and finally pulled the trigger. BAM! All the birds flew from their trees. Blade returned to his comrade. \"I can't tell you how much I appreciate you stamping on me\" he sarcastically said. \"Anytime, now lets move in case that other dog did call for help\" ordered Blade. Shasta followed the gunshot back to the area and saw his friend lying in the snow. \"Sonya!\" he shouted, running to her. \"Thank goodness, come on I'm not leaving you let's go!\" But when he ran, he heard no other legs following him. He turned again and saw her lying there. \"Come on, Sonya, there's no time for games!\" he nudged her body. \"Sonya?\" He then saw the bloody mark on her and his eyes turned wide. \"Did the bear do this?\" he wondered. He lay down beside his friend; his only true, loyal companion who stuck with him and silently cried. \"I should've never taken you, Sonya, I'm sorry\". He felt the storm becoming worse and realised that if he stayed and mourned his friend Adam would soon share her fate. He decided to put some snow over the body and leave it over by the cave, so no one would do anything to it, out of respect for his best friend. His quaking legs turned to continue running.[Chapter 12] He was by himself now. No one; not Echo, not Sonya and not even Adam was with him. But he couldn't let his friends death, as hard and dreadful as it was, prevent him from focusing on what was more important. He ran vigorously towards the path Sonya had pointed out to him, until eventually he reached a massive hill that overlooked a gigantic mountain. This was it. Adam had to be on the other side. Adam finally awoke, rubbing the snow from his eyes, his pale face soon saw the snow battering down on him as well as the dark sky. He slowly stood up, careful not to fall, when his eyes captured a terrifying sight. Ahead, on the edge of the mountain top was massive amounts of snow piling up, looking as if any subtle sound could trigger an avalanche and if it did fall from that high, it would surely be enough to kill him. The -60 degree temperature was starting to get to him and soon he collapsed from the cold. Shasta looked at the massive hill, one of the few things Echo actually taught him that wasn't a lie. \"Large hill, no problem\" he muttered, trying to boost his confidence since Sonya wasn't around to do it for him. However, he soon spotted a problem, ice and lots of it, in front of him. \"Problem\". He decided go the other, more harsher way up the hill, where more rougher snow and rocks were piled up. He ran up from that path, only to fall back down. Again, he tried only to fall and fall and... \"Ow!\" Shasta cried out in pain as his paw smashed against the rocks. He looked at his bruise and knew that he had no choice but to cross the ice pond. But he didn't want to. \"No there was to be another way!\" He continued trying and falling, until he couldn't take the cold any longer, his body began freezing. Dark Blade teleported to the high mountain beside the hill and glared down at him. \"Strange, I thought everyone would stay inside in this weather, not this one\" he noticed, intrigued. \"What are you on about? Are we here or not?\" groaned Death. \"Wait, I want to see what that puppy is doing\" he put his hand out to him. \"I'm starting to think that maybe we were wrong about the intellect of these animals\". \"Well he's clearly a fool, he's running up that hill non-stop only to fall, and get injured. Why?\" \"There must be something he wants...something that he cannot find anywhere else. Or someone\". Shasta laid in the snow, feeling like giving up. His eyes filled with tears over the thought of losing Adam and were already full anyway, blaming himself for Sonya's death. That's when it dawned on him. A voice was heard ringing in his ears... \"He's afraid of the ice\" realised Blade. ...Not from anyone nearby, not from a bear or any animal; not from the phantoms above. It sounded all too familiar, hauntingly familiar. His fathers voice ringed in his ears, and then he heard it more vividly \"Run, son, run\". Shasta forced his eyes to open, with a fierce look in them. He utilised all of what Echo had taught him about running, coupled with everything Sonya taught him and ran forward, his paws gripping the ice and running past it. The husky ignored the winds attempts to throw him back down and the hail. Carrying his wounded paw, Shasta continued on his task, much to the surprise and interest of Dark Blade. Blade turned around and stepped on something heavy and furry. \"What did I tell you about crowding me?\" he scolded. \"Um..\" responded Death, backing away. Blade turned to see the massive bear behind them, standing up and roaring at them with a tremendous screech. \"AHH!\" screamed the duo, running. These three combined sounds triggered the avalanche and it began pummelling down to the surface. \"You said to shoot, so you shoot!\" Death noticed his contradictions. \"I'll run; you use shotgun\" yelled Blade. Shasta eyed the avalanche an quickly sprinted downhill- which is much more easier than running up- and sniffed for any sign of Adam. He soon heard his groans and found his body buried in snow. He quickly barked to wake him up, and then began licking his face. Finally, he woke up. \"S-Shasta\" he groaned. \"Shasta! What are you doing here, boy?\" he stroked his muzzle, before hearing a loud noise approaching. \"Run!\" The avalanche pummelled toward them like a volcanic eruption. Both of them ran up the hill, and when Adam noticed his puppy's wounded paw was making him lag behind he carried him up, but soon his own bad health made him let go and as Adam fell down the hill (to the other side), Shasta fell in the other direction, consumed by the snow. LT. Toffs ambulance and Sheriff Ryan finally arrived at the scene where they witnessed the avalanche finishing. Joe rushed out and helped his son up, whose face looked like Jack Frost. The other huskies soon arrived, and looked around at the result of the avalanche. Toffs quickly readied his ambulance in case he had any injuries. \"It's ok now Adam, I'm here\" he soothed him. \"Dad, Shasta was here too, he saved me, he fell into the avalanche I saw him!\" Adam quickly said, his teeth chattering and his tears frozen. \"Are you sure, Adam?\" asked Joe, not believing it. \"Yes!\" \"Did you hear that, Shasta fell into that snow?\" repeated Anouk. \"No\" gasped Echo. \"Fan out and search!\" The others immediately ran around the hill, yelling \"Shasta\" and \"Sonya\" unaware that she had already met her grim fate elsewhere. Echo began sniffing the ground to pick up Shasta's scent but the snow was messing up his sense of smell. Joe, owning five dogs himself and knowing their reaction to losing a teammate, understood and went to join the search. Paul, Jean George and Dr. Mitchel soon arrived. \"We can't stay out here for long!\" warned sheriff Ryan. Bernie joined in the search for his young friend. Toffs took out a dog whistle and ran whilst blowing it. \"I got this on Ebay as well, it seems to work\". \"How would you know, you're not a dog?\" questioned Ryan, guarding Adam, as the adults searched. \"Shasta!\" yelled Echo and Anouk. \"Shasta! Sonya!\" called Alpine and Baron as they searched past the hill, still not getting a response. Blade and Death teleported back to the mountain and saw all the humans and dogs there, having outrun the bear. \"See, I knew it, dog's are inferior to humans, they cannot talk to them, we were worried over nothing\" Blade analysed. \"Why are they all yelling 'Shasta'?\" \"Who cared?\" snapped Death. \"Wait, 'Shasta'...why does that sound so familiar?\" Beyond the mountain, a large Alaskan dog walked along the snow, the storm immediately dispersing upon his entry. This dog walked toward the body of a small, young husky buried in the snow. His muzzle reached down and examined his body. Slowly, he began licking him, trying to get him up. As Shasta began slowly breathing, Talon gently picked him up with his mouth and began moving toward the humans. \"Sheriff, we must return to the town!\" called Toffs, noticing the increase in snow. \"I'm sorry, son, we tried\" Joe sadly told Adam, who sobbed for his puppy. \"Sir, there's nothing here, we have to go or we'll freeze to death out here!\" Anouk tried reasoning with his leader. \"No, no, no, not till I say we leave!\" he refused. \"Not till we find Shasta!\" But...there is nothing here to find!\" argued Baron. \"I mean, if we die who's gonna sign his death certificate?\" Alpine sharply glared at him. \"Why don't you just shut up\" snapped Echo. Baron sighed, realising that was a bad time for one of his jokes. Echo angrily turned to Akira. \"Look at what you did? Are you happy now!?\" \"What...no, no, he has to still be alive!\" argued Akira, feeling even more guilty. He sprinted ahead, joining the search. \"So quick to blame others, aren't you forgetting what you role in this?\" Francois reminded him. \"You fools caused this to!\" he yelled at them, before realising what they said was the truth and quietly stated \"No, I am the fool. I caused this\". Jean ran to his dogs and scolded them. He turned to the crying boy, the grieved Joe and the sheriff, who seemed displeased. \"Now look at what you've done, now I look like the devil!\" he lashed out at them. \"You'd better find that puppy or else\". \"Pupsqueak, where are you!?\" called out Francois as he and Philippe joined in. \"You may as well help, doctor, if someones dying you can save them. That is why I bought you with me\" Paul urged Mitchel, who joined in regardless. \"...'Shasta'?\" puzzled Death. \"...Freedom. So his legacy continues, eh?\" he muttered under his sinister breath. But Blade was now focused on something else. His red eye zoomed in on Talon as he carried Shasta behind a mountain and laid him down onto the snow. \"What is it?\" asked Death. \"Talon\" gasped Blade. Talon led out a magnificent howl, so powerful that the wind smashed against the hills and the Northern Lights revealed themselves. Paul heard this howl and went behind the mountain, as Talon left. He spied the small puppy. \"I found something!\" he cried. Joe and Toffs turned and ran towards him, followed by Dr. Mitchel, who was waving his hands in the air in order to see where he was going. \"Make way for a medical man!\" he ordered. \"Get your hands and your face out of my face\" hissed Paul. The dogs followed too, surrounding Shasta and slowly tried helping him up. \"Give him some room\" ordered Bernie. \"He's breathing. That's a good sign\". The moment was interrupted as the heavy winds returned, literally freezing the thermometer in Paul's van. \"We need to get out of here!\" yelled the sheriff. Everyone rushed back to their vehicles; Shasta and Adam were taken inside the ambulance, while the huskies ran. \"Come on Blade, we've wasted to much time here\" grunted Death. \"That's interesting\" Blade commented on this scene he had just viewed. \"That's very interesting\".[Chapter 13] Several hours later, the hospital was packed with people who were checking in for their own situations, the -60 temperatures took a heavy toll on the town. But it was ending now, and hopefully they would not experience another one like it again. Adam's parents were waiting patiently and nervously in the waiting area beside the many others. Many of their friends had turned up to see what was happening, as did the teachers. Adam came out after 15 minutes, fully recovered. His mum hugged him tightly while the others looked on. Dr. Mitchel was still checking on Shasta, considering he was a veterinarian. \"Yes, no one can blame me!\" cheered the headteacher. \"See that, I did nothing wrong\". Dr. Mitchel finally came out from the other door. \"After intensive treatment, I must tell you...\" began the doctor, in a low voice. \"That I am AWESOME!\" Shasta ran out from under his legs quickly ran towards Adam and jumped onto his lap. Everyone cheered, spoiling Mitchel's moment. \"I'm awesome, I did this, me!\" he continued. \"Show off\" snarled Paul, thinking he deserved some praise, considering it was his van that provided them with the means to even get there. No, he was still the town's Jacob Marley and Jean George was his Scrooge. Sheriff Ryan entered soon after with Bernie and greeted Adam. Bernie went over to Shasta. \"Hey, look at you, you're looking better than ever\" he smiled. \"Thanks deputy\" he smiled back. \"There's someone here to see you but he wanted me to ask you if you would\" said the Saint. Bernard. \"Huh?\" puzzled the husky. He went outside to see Echo, Alpine, Baron and Anouk waiting for him. \"I'm glad to see you're feeling better\" he said, in a low and ashamed voice. \"Shasta, I told you a great lie and I'm so sorry for that and for everything we said about you. I was just...being selfish, caught up in my own desires...I'm very sorry\". \"It wasn't just you, Echo, we all are to blame for this tragedy\" interrupted Anouk. \"But the efforts of this young pup are remarkable. I'm sure one day you will become a great lead dog, I can sense it- \"-That, and what you did was incredible. You are incredible, and...yeah what Anouk said\" added Baron. \"Thank you\" thanked the husky, a bit embarrassed. \"Alpine, I'm really sorry about Sonya, I tried to stay with her at all times, I just- \"-It's ok Shasta, I know she went for you\" Alpine replied, holding back some tears. \"You know she told me she always thought you were the best lead dog she's ever seen\". Akira soon arrived, sharing a glance with Echo. \"But it is I who should apologise the most, it was my selfish behaviour and anger that led to this\" he stated. \"That is if you'll accept it?\" \"Of course..sir\" Shasta smiled at him. Akira went forward and gave him somewhat of a hug. \"Shasta, I'm sad to tell you this, but the fact is I cannot teach you to be lead dog, simply put: I don't know how\" admitted Echo. \"I know, and that's ok, you guys should continue doing you're thing, it's what you've been preparing for\" he accepted. \"Maybe one day we'll see you on the race course beside us\". Death spied a large cave system, surrounded by fang-like rocks piecing the sky. He waved his hands forward, signalling to his ally. Blade teleported forward and entered the cave. \"This is it\" grinned Blade. \"So where is it?\" demanded Death, looking around. A snarl and growl soon echoed throughout the cave. \"What the- gasped Death, as a two legged creature stepped forward, with red and maroon stripes, deadly claws and teeth, a long tail, yellow bloodthirsty eyes and a ferocious look in general. \"Death meet my new affiliate: Razer\" introduced the phantom. The raptor stepped forward, eyeing the skeleton. Dark Blade pressed a button on his wrist, making a large net full of raw meat appear before them in a flash of yellow and red. \"As I promised, this should last you the month. I thought it best for you to meet Death as I won't always be able to deliver this to you personally\". Razer ignored and began devouring the meat. \"One more thing: the one you said freed you, the one related to Freedom, who you said's family had been killed, what was his name?\" asked Death. Razer stopped chewing and placed his angry eyes before them. \"Shasta? That's his name\" said Death. \"The last time I checked dead people don't run\". \"Alive?\" growled Razer. The raptor went wild, smashing through the icicles and ice sculptures, stones and anything in his path. \"Come, Blade, we did not come to see a tantrum\" urged Death. \"We'll leave it at that, but the next time we ask for a group of dog's killed see to it that you see it done, personally\" agreed Blade, as the two teleported away. Razer exited the cave and let out a loud, furious raw, that haunted the sky. Shasta galloped through the open space of Alaska, once again, after Adam had left for school. Well, actually, Shasta accompanied him along the way to observe the other sled racers practising for the annual dog sled race this year. Unfortunately, Jean George happened to be the first one to run past. The roads was covered in a thick blanket of white, cars peeked out under their new white caps, footsteps and paw prints crisscrossed each other around the labyrinth of paths. The paw prints got smaller the more the town went on. That was because near the outskirts of town, an amazing, young husky was running along the winter wonderland, freely. It was December, a year had passed since the miserable, yet somewhat happy year. It was miserable because of the death of his parents, the snow storm, Adam's injury, the loss of a special someone to Shasta but at the same time he felt relieved that he had done all of these things such as running to the mountains in this storm and getting over his fear of ice. He ran past Emily's house when he stopped. Slowly walking towards a small stone buried into the snow, Shasta felt sorrow in his eyes. It read: \"Sonya, the best puppy I've ever known\". Obviously engraved by a child. Emily and Sonya were always close. But Shasta agreed with this text, Sonya was definitely the best puppy he'd ever known as well. Shasta couldn't really explain it but he had some sort of strange feeling for her, most likely because he saw a bit of himself in her. He used his muzzle to move the flower Emily laid on the grave closer. \"You we're right, Sonya, the Northern Lights really do look amazing at night\" he quietly expressed. \"I only wish you could see them with me\". As he ran on, he soon heard soft barking. Puppy barking? Out here? Usually, he was the only puppy who hanged around these parts of town. He had figured out that an plane would airdrop supplies from Washington D.C, and they would usually contain ice-cream. Shasta had changed a lot since the events of last year. He wasn't a depressed little \"skunk\", as Sonya called him, anymore, he was more active, friendly, level-headed and careful, his cockiness had completely vanished as did his arrogant personality. However, he was still the same adventurous, curious puppy he was back when he was irritating Growl and the others. Speaking of adult dog's, Echo had finally found a sixth member for their team so would be entering this year's race, unlike him. Shasta followed the barks to a large snowy hill and then peered down. No way! Golden Retriever...puppies...in Alaska?\" \"Is there dirt in China, cause if there is I'm gonna keep digging?\" one of the puppies asked, emerging from a large hole that he had dug up. \"Er, you look strangely different, dawg?\" commented the one with a silver B bling around his neck. Shasta looked at the others: a large puppy wearing a red football jersey, one with a Buddhist collar around his neck and a pretty golden puppy with a fake rose attached to her fur, near her ear. He quickly as they noticed him. \"I'm sensing someones presence\" said the wise Buddha. \"Where, I don't see anything?\" asked Rosebud. Shasta looked again to see who said that. \"Over there, by that hill!\" alerted Budderball. Shasta quickly hid once more. \"But I was sure- Shasta decided that perhaps now it was time to finally introduce himself to them and ask where the heck they came from. \"There it is! It's a huge wolf!\" panicked B-Dawg. \"RUN!\" they all screamed, scattering. \"Hey, wait; guys, I wasn't trying to scare you!\" Shasta called after them, but they were to busy running to hear the voice of the small husky. Shasta gave chase and it wasn't long before one became six, and soon those six headed straight toward the finish line in the race, defeating the crafty Jean George, and finally becoming the lead dog he had always hoped of becoming.

I'll call you when I get there Mom\"\"You better! Take care. I love you\" Terri smiled and got on the train. Terri gave her ticket to the man and grabbed a seat. \"I hope your ride will be enjoyable Ms… Fletcher.\" the man smiled and gave her back the ticket. \"It will, thank you\" Terri grabbed a pillow and started to drift off. She awoke with the train blowing it's horn. She got off the train and found a taxi. This time I will not let anyone steal anything, she thought. She laughed remembering what had happened last year. When she arrived to the dorms she smiled and called Jay. Jay was Terri's boyfriend from the summer before. \"Jay, I'm here\" \"Hey Terri\" She smiled when she heard his voice. \"Wait right there!\", he told her. She stood there and saw him come down the hall. She squealed and hugged him. \"I missed you!\", she squealed again. \"That's good because we would have a problem if you didn't.\" Terri smiled and kissed Jay. \"Guys go get a room!\" Terri knew that voice and turned around. Denise and Kiwi. \"Guys Oh my gosh!\" She ran and hugged Denise. \"So up to being roomies again?\", Denise smiled.\"So where's Robin and Sloan?\", asked Terri. Jay laughed and looked at Kiwi. \"Well you won't believe this but there off together in England.\" Terri opened her mouth and couldn't believe what she was hearing. \"Are you serious?\", Terri exclaimed. \"No Joke\", Jay laughed.\" Well Robin must have changed\", Terri laughed and grabbed her suitcase. Just then a girl rang the door and Jay ran to it. \"Ask her the password\", Terri laughed and starting walking with Denise. \"I'm going to go grab some grub want anything?\", asked Kiwi. \"Yeah, I want caffeine\", Denise replied. \"Same here\", Terri replied. \"Two cokes got it\" Kiwi ran off and Jay came up with the new girl. \"I was wondering if you would ever come back\", laughed Terri. Jay smiled and introduced Terri and Denise the new girl. \" This is Laura, she plays the piano, flute and sings\" Terri noticed the girl was drop dead gorgeous. \"That's awesome!\", Denise smiled and shook hands. \"Need help with anything just ask\", said Jay and grabbed Terri's hands. \"Jay! Don't just leave her here \", whispered Terri . \"She'll be fine with Denise. Right?\" Denise nodded and Jay took Terri's suitcase. After they had put her suitcase in the room Terri and Jay went up to the roof. \"Our secret getaway\" Jay smiled and kissed Terri. \"This is one summer not to forget\", whispered Terri. Jay held her close and they rocked back and forth looking at the stars. This is my first story so please R&R;[Chapter 2] BEEP BEEP BEEP! Terri fell out of bed and grabbed her towel. She looked and saw Denise had already left. Just then her cell phone went off and she grabbed it. \"Hello\", she croaked. \" I'll be waiting downstairs to go to the meeting see you in a bit BABE!\" Terri laughed and got in the shower. Terri didn't take long and decided to go down stairs a bit earlier than planned. She saw Laura in the lobby and went to go talk. Then she noticed Jay was with her. They were laughing and something inside Terri made her angry. She realized she knew better and that she should live the way Paul would want her to. She tried to erase the anger and caught up with them. \"Your early\" Jay smiled and gave Terri a peck on the cheek. \"Lets get going you guys, said Laura and Jay agreed. When they got to the meeting it reminded her of her first year. Not many different people were here but she did notice new comers. Mr. Gantry, the camps manager,started his speech and at the end everyone headed for their classes. Terri headed for Mr. Torvald's class and took at seat. \" What's up my peeps?\" Terri had remembered the teachers funkiness and smiled. Mr. Torvald handed out music and the group started it. In the piece there were two solos. Terri was determined to get one of them. \"Okay lets have Laura try the first solo and Terri the second\", announced Mr. Torvald,\" Remember this is just for now all of you will have the chance to try out.\" Terri was pumped and couldn't wait. When Laura went first her sound was amazing. It almost knocked the wind out of Terri. \"We got ourselves the twin of Karen Carpenter\", joked Mr. Torvald. But something inside Terri believed him. Again she felt another pang of jealousy and gave it all she had when her part came. \"Well Ms. Fletcher still got it\" Terri smiled and did her special hand shake to Mr. Torvald. She smiled to Laura. After class Terri went up to Laura and asked if she wanted to hang out. \"I would love to thanks Terri, smiled Laura. Terri felt better knowing she could watch Laura and went to find Jay.[Chapter 3] \"So what do you want to do?\", asked Jay. Denise went to practice and Kiwi and Laura had went to eat lunch . Terri thought that maybe something was happening with Kiwi and Laura. Terri was proved wrong because Jay told her Kiwi just wanted to be friends. She thought Laura probably felt the same way. Which didn't help because Jay and Laura had become close after the two days at Hillman.\"Terri?\" Terri stopped thinking about Laura and smiled. \"I'm not really hungry.\" \"Okay well would you want to go rent a movie?\", asked Jay. Terri thought it would be great to cuddle up with Jay and watch a movie. When they got to Terri's room she opened the door. They sat down and watched the movie. When finished they went to find Kiwi and Laura. \"What have you two been up to?\", asked Kiwi. \"We watched a movie\", answered Jay. \"That's all!\", asked Kiwi. Jay smiled and looked at Terri. \"Yup, you have a problem with that?\" Kiwi laughed and the friends walked back to the dorms. Changing the subject, Laura asked about last summer. That time Terri laughed and held unto Jay's hand. \"Well… everything\", smiled Terri. \"Sometimes you lovebirds make me sick\", laughed Kiwi. Everyone laughed and Terri couldn't wish for anything more. Friends, love, and happiness. \"Everything seems perfect\", whispered Terri. The next morning Terri got up and realized she had left her cell phone at Laura's dorm. She decided to get it back after she showered. \"Laura, it's me Terri\" She knocked on the door, but no one answered. \"Laura\" The door opened and Terri was greeted by Laura'sroom mate. \"Laura left with …what's his name.\" \"I don't know could you tell me?\", asked Terri. \"Jay\", the girl answered. Terri started to feel flustered. \"Oh really, if they come back could you tell them I know\" The girl looked puzzled. \"Know what?\" Terri turned around seeing Laura behind her. \"Oh I know the game your trying to play \", Terri yelled. \"Terri calm down what's this all about?\" Terri couldn't take it and ran back to her room. She found Denise still getting dressed. \"What's wrong?\", asked Denise. \"That Laura has ruined everything\", screamed Terri. \"Terri calm down\" Terri realized she was getting to worked up and sat down on her bed. Denise decided to leave Terri there and to think out her problems. Around 9, right before classes started,Jay came knocking on her door. \" Terri classes are starting in 12 minutes hurry up.\" Terri decided she would go to classes and picked up her bag. She opened the door and saw wonderful, awesome Jay standing there. She scratched it out of her head and ignored him. \"Terri!\" She kept walking and he ran to her.\"What is going on?\", he asked. \"What don't you tell me\", asked Terri and she kept walking. He tried to stop her but knew she wouldn't listen to him. \"Remember students in two weeks we will have \"Talent Show\" to see who gets the scholarship\", reminded Mr. Torvald. \"And tomorrow I will have the solo's posted on the board. You all did a great job today go and have fun.\" Terri doubted she would and decided to go back to the dorm. Kiwi stopped her. \"Terri you seem upset, Jay being a jerk?\", he joked. \"Yes he is\", she answered and started to walk again. Kiwi confused didn't know if she was kidding or not. \"Well I'll go beat him up!\", laughed Kiwi. Terri didn't laugh and kept walking towards the dorms. She couldn't believe that Jay could cheat on her. Going with Laura. She had seen them flirting, but she just ignored it. Friends. She had repeated in her head. She tried to tell herself she hadn't seen them together. It didn't work. She gotin her bed and sleep the day away.[Chapter 4] The next morning Terri got up and realized she had left her cell phone at Laura's dorm.

I know this story is not the greatest but I'm trying. I appreciate all the tips and ideas. XOXOXO, GrlWitSpunk224[Chapter 5] \"Terri it's me Denise\" Terri opened her eyes and thought maybe it was a dream. Then she saw Kiwi, Laura, and Jay in the room and understood it wasn't. She lifted herself from bed and stared at Laura. \"Why is SHE here\", asked Terri. \"She cares about you and wanted to figure out why your so upset\", replied Denise. \"Just like the rest of us\", replied Jay. Terri started to cry and wished she hadn't woke up. \" Jay I've seen you with Laura\", Terri whispered. Tears streamed down her face and unto her sheets. \"Terri but…\" Jay was interrupted by Denise. \"Kiwi I think it would be best if you and Jay left.\" Kiwi understood and opened the door. Jay looked confused and hurt and just looked at Terri. When they had both left Laura stood up. \"Jay and I are not together\" Terri shook her head and repeated \"Liar\" over and over again. \"Will you just be quiet!\" Terri looked surprised and was silent. \"I have a boyfriend already, Jay is my brother.\" Terri's mouth dropped and stood up. \"We just found out today and didn't really want to tell anyone.\" Denise looked at Laura and hugged her. \"I was adopted because our mother couldn't take care of bothof us, and because his Dad is not my dad.\" Laura started to cry. \" When Jay and I were talking the other day we realized it and..\" Terri got up and hugged Laura. \"I'm so sorry can you forgive me\", asked Terri. Laura smiled and hugged Terri back. \" Of course\" Terri opened the door and started running. \"What are you doing?\", asked Denise. Terri stopped and said, \"Apologizing\"[Chapter 6] Terri didn't know where Jay was but she wanted to see him. She ran to Kiwi's door and knocked but no one answered. She knocked again but silence was all Terri heard. Think Terri, where could he be? She then realized he was at their favorite spot. She walked to the roof and saw Jay looking out. \"I knew you were here\", said Terri trying to seem funny. Jay laughed softly and sighed. He turned around and looked at her. \" Terri what can I do to make you trust me?\", asked Jay. She opened her mouth and paused. \"Jay you know I love you but sometimes I get jealous by every passing girl that looks at you\" He gazed off. She wanted to make it comfurtable between them. \"Only if I was ugly\", Jay said laughing. Terri smiled and knew everything would be alright. \"Jay, I'm so sorry for everything. I promise to trust you more.\", she whispered. Jay took Terri into his arms and hugged her. \"I know you will\", he replied. She took in the moment and realized nothing in the world was better than this moment. They kissed and started to walk back down to the dorms. \"So you thought I flirted with my own sister?\", asked Jay. Terri laughed and she kissed Jayon the cheek. \"I'm just one jealous girl\" Jay laughed,\" Yep you are\" When they reached Terri's dorm they noticed that Denise and Laura were still there and Kiwi had joined them. \"Hey everyone\", said Terri hugging Jay. \"Aww look the love boat is still working\", laughed Kiwi. Everyone laughed and Laura stood up. \"Terri if you don't mind I was wondering if Jay and I could do the talent show together\", asked Laura. Terri nodded her head and smiled. \"I wouldn't have itany other way!\" The next morning Terri and Laura walked to Mr.Torvald's class. When they reached the door Mr.Torvald was standing in the way. \"Well you to ladies look like two peas in a pod.\" Terri and Laura laughed and Mr. Torvald moved away. The girls reached the class and went to the board and looked at the solo sheet. It read: 1RST SOLO: LAURA 2ND SOLO: EMILY YOU ALL DID VERY WELL AND SOME OF YOU WERE VERY CLOSE! MR. T Laura's face lit up. \"I made it. I got a solo!\" She twirled around and danced. Then she suddenly stopped. \"Oh, I didn't mean to boast in your face Terri\" \"No problem\", Terri said smiling and started to dance with Laura. Just then Mr.Torvald rentered the class and saw the girls. \"Sorry but I don't think your solo includes dancing\", laughed Mr.Torvald. Laura and Terri blushed and burst out laughing. \"Darn it!\" , replied Laura and laughed again. Mr. Torvald settled down the class and started teaching. I will least have 1 or 2 more chapters be4 I rap the story up. Thanx for the R & R. && sorry this was soo short my world is a little hectic rite now. 3 XOXOXO, GrlWitSpunk224[Chapter 7] The week had gone by and Terri wished the summer would never end. Jay, Terri, Laura, Denise, and Kiwi had become greater friends. Jay and Laura kept working on their song. They planned to suprise their mother. (Since Jay's mother was divorced she would go alone) Denise was praticing a cool new violin piece and as usual Kiwi had something up his sleeve. Terri was the only one stuck. Since this time around she had no partner it was harder. One night she sat at her desk trying to write new lyrics. She decided she would write about her love for Jay. When I saw your face for the first time My world stopped spinning My heart stopped beating I found my self wishing for you I found myself looking at you For the first time I was in love Good start she thought. But couldn't think of a good chorus. She jotted more notes down. After an hour she felt like she had completed nothing. In the morning she would ask Laura if she could help with the music. She grabbed her pj's and later fell asleep. In the morning she found Laura and started working. In the end she felt a bit better and couldn't wait to peform it. She decided she wanted to peform it to Jay before the show. When Laura and she were done she looked for Jay. \"Kiwi have you seen Jay around?\", asked Terri. \"That boy could be in Alaska before I ever would find out\", laughed Kiwi. She smiled and finaly found him at the vending machines. \"Hey look it's my favorite girlfriend\", laughed Jay. \"I hope it's your ONLY girlfriend\", Terri laughed back. They kissed and Terri still felt butterflies from the very first time she kissed him. Jay leaned in for more but Terri resisted. \"Jay I wanted to peform my song for you.\" Jay smiled. \"Sure lets go\" When Terri and Jay reached the piano room they found Laura sitting on the piano bench kissing a boy. Jay and Terri stopped at the entrace and was not payed any attention to. They decided to back away and closed the door. Terri laughed and hugged Jay. \"Your sis is getting her self a boy\", said Terri smiling. Jay didn't smile. \"Everything okay?\", asked Terri. \"Didn't Laura say she had a boy friend?\", asked Jay. Terri stopped smiling and frowned. \"Come to think of it she did\" Jay went back to the door and looked at the couple. Laura and the boy were smiling at each other and started to kiss again when Jay interrupted. \"Laura who is this?\", Jay asked sounding a little bit annoyed. \"Oh, hey Jay\", Laura replied. Still not having answered Jay's question. Laura realized it and spoke again \"This is Josh\" Josh turned around and looked at Jay. \"You got another guy?\", Josh said laughing. Jay smiled an annoyed smile and replied. \"Yes she does, one back home\" Laura looked at Jay and her eyes widened. \"Jay this is the one from back home\", said Laura laughing. \"Oh\", said Jay getting bright red in the face. \"I leave you guys alone\", said Jay closing the door. \"Thanks\", said Josh smiling. Jay left and Terri cracked up. \"Stop it!\", replied Jay getting redder. \" I can't it was just so funny\" Jay got a bit upset and Terri pouted. \"My poor baby has gotten upset?\", asked Terri. That time Jay laughed and hugged Terri. \"Yes, and the only way to make it better is if you give me a kiss\" Terri laughed and granted his wish. \"We can go to the audotorrium for your little song\", said Jay. When they reached the room Terri sat at the piano and started playing... When I saw your face for the first time My world stopped spinning My heart stopped beating I found my self wishing for you I found myself looking at you For the first time I was in love chorus L-O-V-E Love the thing that chases my fears away Love the one thing I can depend on The one thing that dosen't let me down I know this is to good to be true but I Love you I know you think I'm crazy I know you think I'm strange But this is what happens when I'm this way Nothing could bring me down When you hold me close My troubles disaper chorus L-O-V-E Love the thing that chases my fears away Love the one thing I can depend on The one thing that dosen't let me down I know this is to good to be true but I Love you I love you Yes I do Ahhhhhh Yeah... Terri looked up and saw Jay with a smile on his face. \"I love you too\", Jay replied. Terri smiled and their eyes locked. (I just randomly made that song up so if I broke any laws or anything SORRY i didnt know) ps: I dont care if any1 wants to use it cause I think it's awful[Chapter 8] Thank You everyone for reviewing! I Really Appreciate it. I've been out of town so sorry for the wait. Here's the final chapter...maybe Enjoy! XOXOXOXO, Jessica \"I can't believe it's the last day!\", sighed Denise. Terri nodded and took her hair out of the towel. \"I certainly won't miss that shower, it's creepy\", replied Terri. Denise laughed and started to put her make-up on. \"Jay said he wanted to spend a week with me in the fall\", said Terri smiling. \"I can't believe that Jay and you haven't married yet.\" Terri laughed and hoped one day that would become true. \"I'm only a junior and he's starting his senior year\", replied Terri making a face. \"Since we ain't 21, they be trying to say it ain't love Cause we can't hit the club, they be trying to say we too young I ain't saying that we trying to be grown, I'm just saying that we old enough to know We got that young love, young love We lucky cause we got that young love\", Denise said in her best Chris Brown voice. As Terri laughed the phone went off. Denise picked it up. \"Yo I'm Chris Brown\" Terri silenty laughed and hoped it wasn't her parents hearing Denise make a fool out of herself. \"She might\" Denise kept talking and Terri started to get dressed. As Terri started to put her hair up Denise motioned for Terri. Denise took away the reciever and covered it with her hand. \"It's Jay he has something important to tell you\", Denise said not smiling. Terri nodded and took the reiever. \"Hey\", said Jay. \"Hey, what did you want to tell me?\" Denise sighed. \"Terri, my cousin Mike has been kidnapped\" Terri frowned, \"I'm really sorry Jay can I do anything to help?\" \"No, they found him two hours ago and he's dead.\" Terri heard Jay choke up. \"He was really close to me, like a brother... The reason I called you is that I'm leaving really soon with my Mom to go to my Aunt's and I just wanted to say goodbye\",said Jay, \" Since my Aunt and alot of family lives in England I was thinking about living there.\" Terri felt tears streaming down her face. \"Really? What about me?\",Terri whispered. \"Well, I don't want to lose you\" \"Jay, England is so far away...\" \"Terri I want to marry you!\", Jay sounding more cheerful. \"Jay I'm not even a senior yet, I know my parents wouldn't approve.\" \"Thats why you and I would wait for each other.\" \"Jay really\" \"I'm serious. Wait until your...21 and think about it\" \"Jay it's so far away. I'll call you later I promise\" Jay sighed. \"Terri I love you\" \"I love you too\" \"In England I'll call you.\" Terri felt more tears coming. \"I guess your not coming this fall?\",asked Terri. \"Maybe after I get situated in England...you could visit me next summer.\" \"See you later\" With that Terri hung up the phone. Denise had left leaving a note for Terri. T, If theres anything I can do. You can always call me! Good luck today! XOXOXOXO, D Terri had forgotten all about the peformance. She quickly finished getting dressed and headed out. When she got back stage she saw the theater being filled. Terri found a seat back stage and did her mental warm-ups. She silently hoped that she could be strong again. \"Terri?\" Terri turned around and saw Laura. \"Hey Laura\" Terri smiled and felt better with a friend who felt the same as her. \"I'm guessing Jay told you\", said Laura trying to smile. \"Yeah, Laura I'm really sorry you couldn't peform with Jay\",said Terri. Terri felt so bad for Laura. It was her chance to meet her mother and it had blown away. \"Are you still peforming?\",asked Terri. \"No, without Jay the song is nothing\" Laura start to cry. \"I really wanted to meet her and sing with Jay. He has told me so much about her...I just wanted to meet her in person.\" Terri didn't know the pain Laura was going through. Kiwi came over and joined Laura and Terri. \"As the joker of our group I say be happy\" Laura laughed and wiped her tears away. \"Terri good luck! You too Jay\", said Laura as she walked away. Terri smiled and walked over to the stage. She could hear the talent show starting. She looked out and saw her parents and aunt. They smiled and Terri smiled and waved. \"First today is Mike Leigh\" Terri watched as the peformances went on and then she heard her name. \"Please welcome Terri Fletcher\" The crowd clapped and she smiled. The piano started and she started to sing. She wanted Jay so badly to be backstage, but he wasn't. She keep looking out in the crowd. Then out of no where she saw Jay coming in and sat down. She caught his eye and they locked. She felt a tear roll down her eye and kept singing I know this is to good to be true but I Love you I know you think I'm crazy I know you think I'm strange But this is what happens when I'm this way She saw Jay smile and she smiled back. When she finished the song she looked into Jay's eye and mouthed I love you. He mouthed it back and they smiled. She walked off they stage and back stage everyone was appaluding. \"Thanks guys\",she said. She walked back into the crowd looking for Jay. Denise was up and she was playing her violin. She looked where he was sitting but he was gone. She thought he must have left. Terri walked outside to get fresh air. She caught Jay with his suitcase and guitar sitting on a bench.Terri ran to him and tapped his shoulder. \"Hey\", she said. \"Hey\", Jay said smiling. They started to kiss. When they needed oxygen they both leaned back. \"My Mom is coming soon so we can leave\" She nodded. \"I'm really going to miss you\", said Terri. \"Please just think about my offer. If we just wait. I really want to marry you\" Terri sighed. \"Thats to far ahead in my life Jay. I promise when I'm 21 I will think about the proposal\", said Terri. \"Okay, you better go\", said Jay. She smiled and kissed him. They smiled at each other. \"TERRI COME ON THEIR ANNOUCING THE WINNER\",said Kiwi. Jay laughed and Terri ran over. \"Bye\", he mouthed. She ran in and sat down. \"This year has been one of the best. We would like to reward the scholarship to Terri Fletcher\" Terri stood up and went to the stage. She started to feel tears. This time the tears were for joy. She felt right in the world. After everyone went out and she met her parents and aunt. \"Sweetie that was so beautiful!\", said Terri's Mom. Terri hugged them and started filling them on her week... 5 Years Later...[Chapter 9] Okay. I lied about 2 things. (Which prob will make you guyz happy) Before I say anything I want to thank Moonlight19, puppylove223223,XxNightGodessxX,Chris89, and xoxo-loza-xoxo! Thanks for posting.

I have relized I have to much to write for just one more chapter. Other than that please reply after you read. :-) XOXOXOXO, GrlWitSpunk224 Terri sat in shock. \"Terri?\", Jay asked, \"Terri?\" Suddenly it hit Terri hard. Jay and Scott had asked her to marry them. She started to get light-headed and fainted. She fell out of the chair and Scott caught her. After 2 minutes Terri awoke. \"Ter are you okay?\", asked Scott. Terri tried to look and thought it was Jay. She tried to get up. \" I've missed you\", said Terri and leaned in for a kiss. Scott and Terri broke away. \"It was only for two minutes\", laughed Scott. Terri shook her head and realized it was Scott. Stupid she thought. You love Scott! Right? Terri couldn't decide. She realized Jay might still be on the phone. She got up and grabbed the phone from the table. \"Hello?\",asked Terri but no one answered. \"Darn it\" said Terri under her breath. \"I wanna know who you were talking to? Why were you crying?\", asked Scott. \"It was a friend I hadn't heard in a long time\" She wasn't lying but why did she feel like she was. We're more than friends. \"Okay well you never answered my question\", said Scott smiling. Terri hesatated. You guys are perfect for each other. Say yes! \"Yes!\", she said smiling. It felt right. She had been dating him and Jay had been out of the picture. Why would he step in now? Hello Scott, goodbye Jay. Scott kissed her pasionatily and held her close. \"I love you\" she whispered. He picked her up and swung her around. She laughed and totally forget a guy named Jay. When they got back to her dorm Scott kissed her and they both didn't want to let go. He started to walk away and came back and kissed her again.\"Sweet dreams\", Scott said smiling. He walked away and she sighed. I am so lucky! She looked at her ring and smiled. When she opened the door she saw Denise watching T.V. \"How was your date?\", asked Denise not turning around to see Terri. \"I got engaged\", said Terri. Denise screamed and jumped up. She hugged Terri. \"Oh my gosh that ring is gorgeous!\" Terri frowned. \"Guess what else happened\" Denise shrugged. \"Jay called\" Denise's jaw dropped. \"No way. It's been two years and now he calls. What a jerk\" Terri shrugged. \"I guess so\" Terri went in her room and got dressed for bed. She climbed into bed and looked at her ring again. \"I'm going to be Mrs. Scott Lark\", whispered Terri and fell asleep. The next morning Terri woke up with a terrible headache. \"I'm glad I don't have classes today\", she muttered. Streaching she looked at the clock. 10:00AM She decided to take a shower and grabbed a towel from her closet. She was just about done when she heard her cell phone ring. She quickly got out. She answered her phone, suds and all. \"Hello?\", asked Terri. \"Hey this is Jay. Before you do anything can you just open the door\" Terri frowned. \"Jay I...\" \"Just open the door.\" Without thinking she quickly got dressed and wrapped the towel in her hair. She went to the front and opened the door. There stood Jay with flowers and a cell phone in his hand. \"Surprise\", said Jay smiling. His british accent was clear and strong. \"Hey\", she said not knowing what to do. \"Can I come in?\", asked Jay. \"Sure\" Terri didn't know what she was doing she pretended like nothing had ever happened. She went to her room and said she be right back. She looked at herself in the mirror. \"I look silly\" She brushed her hair and took off her ring. A voice in her head kept asking her why she just took off her engagement ring. Terri felt as if a robot had taken over her body. \"Okay I'm back\", she said smiling. Jay was sitting on the couch. \"Cool, I wanted to talk\" Terri smiled and sat down. \"Terri I want to forget about the past while I was in England . Somehow we lost track of each other. I never wanted that to happen. Terri I still and always will love you.\" Jay leaned in and kissed her on the cheek. Terri felt herself blushing. \"I want that to Jay\" Jay smiled and leaned in for a kiss. She leaned in to and they started to kiss. She leaned back and said \"I will always love you to\" Jay smiled and kissed her palm. They started to kiss again. They heard a knock on the door. \"Let me get that\",said Jay. He opened the door to see Scott smiling. \"Hey Ter...\" Scott had a puzzled look on his face. \"Hey mate\", said Jay. \"Terri who is this?\" Jay smiled, \"I'm her boyfriend\" Terri just sat there trying to retrace what she had just done in the last 10 minutes. You kissed him Terri. He's not your fiance. \"Your boyfriend? Well I'm her fiance\", said Scott angrily. Scott looked at Terri. \"Thanks for not telling me sooner it would have just broken my heart\", Scott said sacarsictly. Scott left and slammed the door. Jay looked at Terri. \"Where's the ring?\" Terri started to cry. \"In my room\" Jay looked furious. \"Thats just great Terri. You didn't say anything about a ring when we started kissing. Oh and you love me do you? What about him?\" Jay paced the room. \"Jay what was I supossed to do you left me?\", said Terri. \"Wait\" \"I did but you never came. I can't wait for the rest of my life thinking, Oh Jay will come. No I had to get over you. You had shown me you had no interest when you stopped calling. So I moved on\" said Terri now getting mad. Jay opened the door. \"Thats great for you. Just leave me out of your life.\" With that Jay slammed the door. Terri just rolled up into a ball on the couch and cried. Intense I know! I love doing cliff hangers. Sorry :-) Please review. I wanna try to get 5 reviews. IF not I will post a new chapter in a week. Obrigado, Grlwitspunk224[Chapter 10] Okay so your asking for more.

READ ON:-) xoxo, Grlwitspunk224 ps: there is alcohol refferrance (sp) but the person is 22 years old and he dosen't get drunk. After a while Denise came back to the dorm to see Terri crying. \"Terri, are you okay?\", asked Denise. Terri shook her head. \"Jay...Scott...it's... over\", said Terri crying after every word. \"Okay what about Jay?\", asked Denise. Terri calmed down and wiped her tears. \"Jay came over and we talked. Then Scott came over and got really mad. Then Jay left\" Denise rolled her eyes. \"Why does Jay have to ruin everything\" Terri frowned. \"He told me he lost my phone number and thats why he stopped calling\" Denise sighed, \"Terri ever heard of an operator\" Terri started to cry all over again. \"Girl you gotta get over him. You spent two years crying about him. Now you met Scott. Don't blow it\" Terri agreed and got up. \"I'm going over to Scott's to apologize\" Terri grabbed her things and ring. When she got there she saw that the door was open. \"Scott?\" She peeked her head in the door. There lay Scott with a beer and chips on the floor. It looked as if he had been crying too. \"Terri\" She nodded and went to his side. \"I tried to get drunk but I think the taste of beer is awful\", said Todd laughing. Terri looked at the beer seeing it was still full. \"Scott we need to talk\" Scott shook his head. \"Nah you got him\" Terri started to feel tears come down. \"He was my first love. Then he left me for England and I found you. He called the other night and asked me to marry him. I didn't know he still thought me as his girlfriend. Then today he came over and he just started kissing me... I'm really sorry Scott.\" Scott now how tears coming down his eyes. \"Terri I love you but right now I need some space to think. Maybe we could talk later. I still want to marry you. Don't say yes or no right now. Just think about it\" Terri nodded. \"I think I need to find myself\", said Terri getting up.She kissed Scott's cheek and left. Terri headed back to her dorm and saw Jay standing in the doorway. \"Jay move\" \"No, I need to confess something to you\" Terri opened her door. \"What Jay?\" Jay looked down at his feet. \" I didn't lose your number. It's just that we were so far away from each other and I didn't know if I'd ever see you again. So I started to date but no one compared to you. I realize now that I love you\" Terri stared at Jay. \"Thats just great\", and slammed the door. Denise was studying on the couch. \"I'm starting to hate Jay\", said Terri throwing her keys on the table. \"I would to if I were you\" Terri grabbed her books and started to study. The next thing she knew she heard her cell ring and realized she had been sleeping on her book. She ran to her room and grabbed the phone. \"Hello?\", Terri said still asleep. \"Ms. Fletcher this is Dr. Hardens it seems that Jay Reed ( I don't know his last name) has gotten in a severe car crash and his sister Laura Greenbeard has asked for you\" Terri wrote the address of the hospital and got in her car. Terri's older brother had gotten in a car crash years ago and rembered the horror. She reached the hospital and found Laura sitting at one of the chairs in the waiting room. \"Terri? Oh Terri I'm so worried about Jay. I was sitting at class when I get a call from this doctor saying my brother is severly injurged\" Terri hugged Laura and let her cry on her shoulder.\" The night before Jay said that he was going to propose to you so I though you might want to be here\" A muffled laugh came out of Terri. \"We're not engaged Laura\" Laura looked suprised. \"Well I just thought that...\" \"Ladies I have some bad news\" Terri turned to see a docor. \"It seems that Jay is... TUNE IN NEXT WEEK (or give me 6 reviews ) TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT... PS: Sorry for this chapter being short. I promise the next one will be better![Chapter 11] Hey, Okay so Jay is dead? I don't know... Well yes I know but you don't sooooo READ ON! Oh and after PLEASE PLEASE review :-) xoxo, GrlWitspunk224 LAST CHAPTER if you don't remember... \"Ladies I have some bad news\" Terri turned to see a doctor. \"It seems that Jay is...\" Terri looked straight into the doctors eyes. Jay please don't be dead. \"Jay has had a comatose. He cannot have any vistors today. You can see him tommorrow Ms. Greenbeard. Ms.Fletcher since you are the fiance you can see him for 10 minutes. \"But I'm\", Terri tried to explain but she had Scott's ring on and she decided she should see Jay. When she got in the room she saw Jay.He had his eyes closed. \"He can hear you but cannot talk\", said the doctor in a hush tone. Terri nodded and got closer. He had a cut on his left cheek and his head was bandaged. \"He had a cut on his head but we cleaned that up\" Terri nodded again and took Jay's hand. \"I'm here Jay\" , said Terri, \"Your safe\" Terri got up. \"The second he wakes up please call me\" The doctor nodded and lead Terri to the exit. With that Terri got in her car and sat looking at her hands. \"Who am I supossed to be with?\", she asked to no one in particular. She grabbed her cell and called her Aunt. \"Hey Terbear\" Terri smiled. \"Hey, can we talk?\" \"Sure whats up?\" \"Well yesterday I was engaged by Scott, you know my boyfriend\" \"Oh thats great!\" Terri frowned. \"Yeah well Jay called and to make a long story short we ended up kissing\" \"On the phone?\" Terri laughed then frowned again. \"No at my dorm. It was not making out but I was still kissing ...well not my fiance. Then to make matters worse Scott ends up at the door\" Terri heard her Aunt sigh. \"Terri, I thought you were done with Jay\" \"I did too\" \"Well then why are you calling me?\" \" Jay's in a comatose\" \"Oh\" \"Well honey if you love him you need to tell Scott\" \"I don't know I'm really confused\" That time Terri sighed. \"Ask yourself this could you see yourself getting old with Jay and having kids or do you see Scott\" Terri put the receiver away from her mouth and thought. \"I see... Scott\" \"Then why are you bothering with Jay\" \"I don't know\", Terri said getting upset. \"Honey, I'm sorry but I can't help you with this\" Terri said goodbye and hung up. She leaned up against her car and closed her eyes. Terri then drove to Scott's dorm. \"Scott\" , Terri said knocking on the door. The door opened with Scott smiling. Terri was suprised. \"Hi?\" \"Hey Ter\" \"Scott can we talk?\" \"Sure Terri\" She stepped inside and took a seat. Scott I hear because I want to tell you I want to marry you. I want this thing about Jay to disaper like nothing happened\" Scott nodded and was silent. They sat their for what seem to Terri as an hour when Scott got up and opened the door. \"Bye Terri\" She looked and Scott. \"Bye?\" \"Yeah bye\" \"Scott I just told you I want to marry you and you just said bye\" \"I'm tired\" \"So?\" \"So I want to go to bed\" Terri got angry. \"FINE\" She got out and was about to walk away when the door opened. \"And I want to marry you to\", said Scott and kissed Terri. They stood there just holding the moment and just for effect Terri popped her leg. \"Bye\" Terri laughed. \"Bye!\" She walked away and heard her cell phone ring. She answered it \"Hello?\" \"TERRI. TERRI. TERRI. WHY SCOTT? WE WERE MEANT TO BE!\" RING , RING, RING \"Wha.. I.. huh?\" Terri woke up and realized she had been dreaming. \"Hello?\" \"This is Nurse Klein I have been told to tell you Jay is out of the comatose and can see vistors. Terri turned got out of the car and realized she was still at the hospital to. Good timing. She found Jays room and saw Jay was awake. \"Hey\", she whispered. \"Hey yourself\", he smiled. \" I heard that my fiance was coming and I didn't know who was showing up\" Terri laughed. \"They said I'll be here for two more days\" \"Thats it?\" \"The doctor said now that I'm out of my coma that other than that I'm was fine and the bandages would heal\" Terri smiled \"Thats great\" \"I'm lucky to be alive\" \"Yeah you are\" Then the doctor came at the door. \"Jay needs to take more testing and you can see him again in 30 minutes\" Terri nodded and headed out. Her cell phone rang and she went to the waiting room. \"Hello\" She heard Scott. \"Hey. I given some thought and I think that its best that we break up for now. You just found Jay again and if things don't work out call me\" Terri gasped. \"Scott I\" \"Terri don't say anything. I can't compete with a guy who's still winning your heart. Goodbye for now\" She heard the phone click. She took off the ring and put it in her bag. So Scott's gone. I think it's a bit sad. Scott was a great guy too. But we all know Terri and Jay have to get together... Right! ps: Somebody Jay knows comes into town and mixes things up... UH OH SO COME ON IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO AND WHAT THEN CLICK THAT BUTTON AND REVIEW! please I'd like 8 reviews (I know I'm getting greedy but all you have to do is press that button) or I will post a new chapter a week from now.[Chapter 12] Okay so I didn't get the 8 reviews I wanted. But I felt bad for the FAITHFUL fans that did review. So here you go... Terri didn't cry. She just sat there looking at the ground. \"Ms.Fletcher the test are done\" She nodded and went back in the room. \"Terri we need to seriously talk\", said Jay.\" I know we do\" Terri sat next to Jay and sighed. \"Scott broke up with me\" Jay threw up his hands. \"Oh so now that he's out I'm in? I'm glad to know that I'm second on your list\" Terri shook her head. \"No Jay. I love you. I'm sorry it took me a while to realize it\" Jay calmed down. \"I'm lucky you still love me. I was such a jerk not calling you. Please forgive me\" Terri nodded her head. \"Yeah well we both messed up\", said Terri. Jay smiled. \"I need to get going I have a class early tommorrow\" \"Okay\", said Jay still grinning. They kissed and the world seemed to freeze. \"Bye Romeo\" Jay laughed and she walked out of the room. She walked to her car and saw someone fimilar. The girl was tall, thin, and had wavy blond locks. She wore a mini skirt and a shirt that said \"Think Again\" and designer sunglasses. Then it hit her. ROBIN! Terri went over to Robin and said hi. Robin looked at Terri and rolled her eyes. \"Who do you think you are?\" Terri laughed. \"I'm Terri Fletcher\" Robin put her sunglasses down. \"That sounds so fimilar\" Terri laughed again. \"It should we went to Hillman together\" That time Robin laughed. \"Terri Fletcher! Hah I remember you. You stole my boyfriend, Jay\" Terri tried not to laugh. \"Are you here to see him?\",asked Terri. \"See who?\" \"Jay of course\" Robin cackled. \"That weirdo. No! I didn't even know he was here. The only reason I'm in stupid Indiana is because my friend Lauren is getting surgery today. Plus I hate hospitals, but my Lauren really wanted me here\", said Robin rolling her eyes. \"Oh well Jay is here because he got in a car accident\" Robin put her sunglasses back up. \"Like I care\" Terri waved and left. She went back to her dorm. \"Denise you will not believe this!\" Denise shook her head. \"No you won't believe this\" They both laughed. \"I'll go first\", said Denise all serious. \"I saw Scott and he was flirting with these girls. I couldn't believe it and then he gave them his number!\" Terri looked at the ground. \"Well he's single so it dosen't matter\" Denise's mouth dropped. \"It's okay Jay and I are back together\" Denise shook her head. \"I've always told you he was bad news but whatever\", said Denise shrugging her shoulders. \"Guess who I saw today?\" \"Who\", Denise asked. \"Robin\" Denise laughed. \"Well I'm gonna make some ramen noodles. Want some?\", said Denise still laughing. \"Sure thanks\" Terri grabbed her books and started studying. I want 5 reviews. 5 okay just five. I could have asked for more but no.

So R&R; please! xoxo, GrlWitSpunk224[Chapter 14] \"Every story does not happen to have a perfect ending\" - Grlwitspunk224 Ever since Jay had asked her to marry him she had been floating on air. She hadn't felt this great since the day she met Jay. She did still feel and emptiness in her heart, but pretended it wasn't there. Jay had gone back to england for a week to pack his bags. Terri and Jay had gotten an apartment close to school. It was now late Novemeber only 3 weeks after the engagement Terri went around the house humming looking for scissors. She found them in one of the many boxes she hadn't unpacked yet. She started to unwrap the boxes. ' L is for the way you look at me' She kept singing and as she picked up a photograph. She stopped humming and put on a painful look. It was a photograph of Todd and her. It was their one month aniversary and Todd took her to a amusement park. Todd knew how much she loved roller coasters. She kept her eyes on the photo untill the phone rang. \"Hello?\" \"Hello Baby\" She smiled at the voice. \"I missed you\" \"I missed you too, Jay\" \" I just wanted to call you to tell you I bought something that should be coming in today\" She giggled. \"Oh I do love surprises\" He laughed and hung up. SHe The houses door bell went off. \"I'm comming\", said Terri. She got up and went to the door. A man in a Fed-ex uniform was holding a package. \"For a Ms. Terri Fletcher?\" \"I am she\" He smiled.\" I need you to sign here\" She grabbed the pen and signed. \"Have a nice day Mam\" She nodded and took the package. It was moderatly sized. No fragile sticker was on the box. She wondered what it was. She got the scissors from the counter and started to cut the tap. She got the foam out and saw another little box. She opened the box and saw it was a little ornament. It read \"Our First Christmas\" She turned red in the face. He must have known she was Jewish.( work with me here people. I know in the movie it didn't say anything like this) She knew her family wasn't that big into her religon but her fiance had to know that. Todd knows I'm Jewish. Her normal self kicked in. What was she doing???? Jay didn't really know her. She had only seen him for a couple of weeks for summer camp. Then all of a sudden BAM she was marrying him. She had known Todd for longer than that. 2 years she had known Todd. She had seen Todd every day. She had known Jay for two years too but she had only seen him for 2 summers. During the school year Terri and Jay didn't talk much. Terri was different from when she was in her teenage summer years. She was an adult now. She had to move on. Terri knew she would be breaking Jay's heart, but it was something she had to do. She dialed his number. \"Jay\" \"Hey Babe,get the ortament?\" \"Yeah about that I'm Jewish\" Jay laughed, \"Silly me I knew that\" Terri sighed. \"No you didn't. Jay I think you should stay...in London for a bit longer\" \"And why should I do that?\" \"Because we wont be getting married so..\" \"Wh..wh.. wait? What? Am I getting punked or something cause it's not funny\" \"It's not supposed to be a joke\" Jay started to laugh. \"You still love him don't you\" \"Yeah I do\" \"Thats funny\" \"Really?\" \"No but Im trying to lighten the mood Ter. Promise me if it dosen't work out you'll call me\" \"You'll be the first to know\" \"Thanks\" \"Bye Jay\" \"Bye Terr\" She hung up and dialed Todd's number. \"Y'ello?\" She laughed and started to cry. She had missed him so much \" Hello?\" She snifled. \"Hey\" She could hear heavy breathing from the other end. \"Hi Terri\" \"Hi Todd\" \"I haven't heard from you in a month\" \"Yeah, well are you busy?\" \"No\" \"I need to meet you Todd\" \"where?\" \"At the park\" \"I'll be there\" \"Thanks Todd\" she grabbed her keys and got in her car. She saw the parks sign and pulled over. She saw Todd standing by a bench. She ran over and put her coat on. \"Terri hey\" \"Todd I need to tell you I made a mistake and that I trully love you. My head was not on right. I was afraid of our marriage because I hadn't settled the Jay problem. I hadn't realized untill now that Jay was apart of my first love. That he would always have a special place in my heart for him just not all of it. Not even close. The only one who would fill my heart is you\" Todd looked at Terri for a long time and then cupped his hands in her face and brought her closer to her and finally their lips touched. They held it for about a mintue untill they both moved back. She smiled and they both kissed again. She wrapped her hands around his neck. He picked her up and swung her around. As they kissed and laughed the rain started to trickle down. Terri realized this was her new chapter in life. Her adult years. She waved goodbye to her summers of love and entered the door of the rest of her life. She looked into Todd's eyes and kissed him. It was a hard yet soft kiss. A kiss that meant everything. I know you probably all hate me, but Terri had to get over Jay. Im sorry. As they say in the Sound of Music. Adieu, adieu, to yieu and yieu and yieu, Grlwitspunk224[Chapter 15] Dear Readers, Accept my full apology onnmy last chapter.

However, before they could go anywhere, both families were stuck in the airport and their flight to Alaska had been delayed because of the snow, much to everyone's disappointment and they had to wait a while. Scruffy and Dot were the most upset because this would be their first time in Alaska. \"I still remember when I went to Alaska with the Air Buddies and your cousin Oddball...\" Patch said as he sighed with his disappointed children. \"Ooh, story time!\" Scruffy smiled. \"Since we're delayed, it might be a good idea.\" Patch smiled back. \"A story about Cousin Oddball?\" Dot sounded excited as they had never met their cousin yet. \"Oh, yes,\" Patch smiled. \"And the Air Buddies of course. I can't believe I never told you this story before.\" The kids sighed and groaned as they sat at the table together, feeling stuck since the plane flight was delayed and they were becoming very bored. \"So, how does it start, Dad?\" Dot asked. \"Now, let me see...\" Patch started to think back. \"It was a normal hot day...\" \"Are you telling stories?\" Akito walked over. \"Would you like to listen?\" Patch invited with a smile. \"Sure, beats sitting around and doing nothing all day.\" Vincent agreed. \"Well, come on,\" Patch smiled as the kids joined the pets. \"Now, as I was saying... I should mention this to you all, especially you, Scruffy and Dot. There comes a time in every pup's life when there are forces greater than themselves. Forces that can't be seen or touched, but only felt. Although life may lead you where you least expect it, you can have faith if that's where it's meant to be.\" Scruffy and Dot nodded as they would make note of that. \"Now, this was after Colette and I had talked the Air Buddies into accepting their new homes...\" Patch then began to narrate as we are shown a flashback to before the puppies were born. 'This story is going to be exciting.' Akito thought to himself. We flashback to the old days. A familiar car was riding and pulling up to the driveway. \"Just turn here and we'll be at the house.\" Jessica told her fiancé as she held Oddball who was excited to spend this summer with her favorite uncle and not only that, but her mistress had exciting news for the family. \"As you wish.\" Christopher smiled. Jessica smiled back. \"How much longerrrr?\" Oddball whined as she couldn't wait for very much longer. \"We're almost there, Oddy, promise.\" Jessica pet her dog. \"You said that hours ago...\" Oddball pouted as she flopped against the window and her ears flapped slightly from the passing wind. \"Well, this time, I mean it.\" Jessica said. Oddball pouted. \"Come on...\" Jessica pet her dog. Oddball then smiled and licked Jessica's face. The drive took a while until finally they made it to their destination. \"Are we there yet...?\" Oddball groaned. \"The last few times you asked that, the answer was no,\" Jessica looked annoyed at first, but then smiled. \"This time, the answer's yes!\" Oddball squealed and cheered in delight. \"Can you imagine what our kids will be like?\" Jessica smirked to Christopher. \"I can already wait.\" Christopher smirked back. Darla ran out and hugged her big sister's legs. \"Hey, kiddo,\" Jessica smiled. \"How's my little flower girl doing?\" \"Great that you're here,\" Darla looked up. \"Mom said that Ariel and the others will be coming to the wedding too.\" \"That'll be great, plus I'm here all summer.\" Jessica smiled back. \"Wait a minute.\" Scruffy's voice said, interrupting the story. \"Yes, Scruffy?\" Patch asked his hyperactive son. \"I thought you were telling us the story about our cousin Oddball and the Buddies.\" Scruffy said. \"I am, this is part of the story,\" Patch explained. \"Jessica was coming with Oddball and Christopher for the summer and for Jessica's wedding to Christopher, but this is how your cousin Oddball got to meet the Buddies.\" \"Oh...\" Scruffy replied. \"Keep in mind, this story being in the summer is very important.\" Patch replied. \"Then you can continue.\" Scruffy said. \"Now, where was I? Oh, yes!\" Patch then continued back to the story. At Shelter 17... \"I'd love to stay some more, Lucky, but Jessica will be home any minute,\" Patch said to his father figure. \"I know Oddball's gonna want to see me.\" \"Well then, you better not keep her waiting.\" Lucky said. \"I'll see you guys later.\" Patch smiled. \"See ya, kiddo.\" Lucky smiled back. Patch then rushed off to make it to the Fudo house. And where he then used his magic to teleport him to the house on time. Jessica was now hugging Patrick and Emily. Atticus smiled in excitement to his sister and future brother-in-law. Patch gave greetings to everyone, then looked around. \"Now, where is that girl?\" \"Hiiii!\" Oddball pounced on her favorite uncle's back. \"Oh, there you are.\" Patch smiled. Oddball giggled. Patch then gently put her on the floor and stood across from her. \"How was your ride?\" \"Long...\" Oddball groaned with a pout, but smiled to him. \"But worth it.\" \"Well, it's going to get better.\" Patch said. \"I hope so.\" Oddball said. \"I told Buddy and Molly you'd be in town this summer, so you should be meeting the Buddies real soon.\" Patch smiled encouragingly. \"YAY!\" Oddball cheered. Patch chuckled to her excitement. \"I thought you'd like to know about that.\" He then went to the window, he knew it was early, but he made a barking call out to the Buddies to tell them that Oddball was now at the house and the Buddies were more than welcome to come see her. The Buddies were helping their human kids on their last day of school before their summer vacation and overheard Patch's call and would go meet up after their kids would be on their way to school without them. \"When do you think they will respond?\" Oddball asked. \"Hard to say.\" Patch replied as he kept an ear out for her. \"Come on, Oddball, you must be hungry after that long car ride.\" Jessica picked up Oddball to give her some kibble. \"I sure am.\" Oddball smiled. Jessica smiled and filled her dog's bowl with kibble to let her have a quick snack after such a long car ride. \"So, you're gonna be my brother after this summer,\" Darla said as she took a long look at Christopher. \"Does this mean I get extra presents at my birthday and Christmas?\" \"In a way, I guess it does.\" Christopher said. \"Now, let's talk about this...\" Darla crossed her arms and smirked. \"Darlene!\" Emily scolded. \"No bribing your future brother-in-law for more presents!\" \"Sorry...\" Darla smiled nervously then. 'Little sisters.' Jessica thought to herself while rolling her eyes. Oddball smiled and happily ate the kibble, rather quickly so she wouldn't be eating when her new friends would see her. They hadn't met since Atticus was in Magic Training classes in high school with Cherry, Sabrina, Mo, Patch, and Penelope. Eventually, the humans of the family were going to do wedding planning as they had one month left until Jessica and Christopher's wedding.[Chapter 2] \"Here they come!\" Patch told Oddball. \"Oh, boy!\" Oddball cheered. \"Okay, settle down.\" Patch chuckled. \"Sorry, Uncle Patch.\" Oddball smiled sheepishly. And where it seemed only three of the Buddies arrived. Patch came out with a smile to meet the Buddies. \"Hello!\" \"Hi, Patch!\" the Buddies smiled. \"I have someone who'd like to see-\" Patch replied, then saw it was just three. \"Um... Weren't there five of you?\" he then rhetorically asked, knowing there were five Buddies, but was curious why they weren't all there. \"Hey, dawgs, is it safe to come out?\" B-Dawg asked from behind a bush. \"Coast is clear, B-Dawg.\" Patch replied. Oddball poked her head out of the doggy door as she saw the golden retriever puppies of the famous sport-playing canine himself. \"As you were saying, Patch?\" Buddha asked. Patch looked to his niece and urged her to come on out and meet her friends. Oddball halfway smiled and walked over to her uncle's side to meet the Buddies. \"H-Hello.\" she smiled. \"You guys remember Oddball, right?\" Patch prompted with a smile. \"Of course I do!\" Rosebud rushed over and held her paw up high to the other female puppy. \"High-paw, BFDFFL!\" \"Huh?\" Budderball, Buddha, MudBud, and B-Dawg asked, confused. \"Best Female Dog Friend For Life.\" Rosebud translated with an eye roll to her brothers. Oddball high-pawed Rosebud back with a smile and giggle. \"Ohh.\" Budderball, MudBud, Buddha, and B-Dawg said, understanding. \"Boys...\" Oddball and Rosebud rolled their eyes, then smiled to each other. \"So, what else did you have to tell us, Patch?\" Budderball asked. \"Oddball will be here for most of the summer,\" Patch smiled. \"Her owner's getting married next month.\" \"That's wonderful!\" Rosebud smiled. \"Uh-huh,\" Oddball beamed brightly. \"I'm so happy for her...\" she then sighed in wonder. \"Ooh, I wonder if I'll ever get married~...\" \"Maybe you'll get married to Budderball since he couldn't stop talking about you after you left.\" MudBud teased playfully. \"Huh?\" Oddball asked. \"Hey, come on, guys, I do not!\" Budderball defended. \"Indeed, you do talk about her all the time and how beautiful she is.\" Buddha teased playfully. \"Looks like you've got a boyfriend, Oddball.\" Patch smiled to his niece. \"Oh, my...\" Oddball's eyes widened and she blushed slightly. \"Guys!\" Budderball whined while blushing. \"Now, now, that's enough,\" Patch stopped them like a responsible father figure. \"How's about we play a game, huh?\" \"Yay!\" The puppies cheered. \"What should we play?\" Patch asked. \"New rules, we meet at the field and whoever makes it there first gets to decide.\" Rosebud said as she carried her soccer ball. \"Meet you there!\" The rest of the Buddies said and started carrying their own sport balls. \"Where's the field?\" Oddball whispered to her uncle. \"Come on.\" Patch decided to walk her there. \"Yay! But can you get us there much faster?\" Oddball asked. Patch smiled to her. The Buddies rushed to the field as quickly as they could. And where they were surprised to see Patch and Oddball there before them. Rosebud was the first of the Buddies after all. B-Dawg was hiding again in the bushes. What did he have to hide? \"B-Dawg, why are you hiding again?\" Oddball asked. \"Uh, actually, I was thinking we could play Hide and Go Seek.\" B-Dawg said nervously as he ran from the bushes with his ball in his mouth. \"Seeking is a good way to start our day.\" Buddha phrased before meditating. \"Looks like we'll be playing Hide and Seek then.\" Patch smiled. \"Okay, you're it!\" Rosebud called to the boys. Patch chuckled to the Buddies and his niece as they all ran off to go and hide and he joined them. Budderball turned his head and looked instantly hungry. \"Ice cream...\" he picked up his football and ran off to town to catch the ice cream truck. \"Budderball, where are you going?!\" Oddball went after the chubbiest of the Air Buddies. 'Where are those two heading off to?' Patch thought to himself. \"Ready or not, your destiny awaits!\" Buddha called to the others as he was done counting. \"Looks like we might need to put this on hold.\" Patch said. Buddha turned his head as he saw his brother and new friend. \"Budderball, Oddball, I see you guys!\" Budderball and Oddball were now going inside a vehicle. \"Guys, stop!\" Buddha told them. Rosebud poked her head out from behind a mossy tree. MudBud looked up from a pile of logs he was hiding underneath of. The Buddies then chased after Budderball and Oddball as they were going towards the tubs of ice cream. Patch sighed as it was going to be one of those days as he joined the Buddies. \"Hold up, dogs!\" B-Dawg rushed from behind the rocks. \"Oh, sweet mama~...\" Budderball smiled dreamily as he saw the dozens of tubs of ice cream. \"Come on, Budderball, let's go back.\" Oddball bit onto his football jersey collar. \"But just look at all the ice cream, Oddball.\" Budderball said. Oddball had to admit it, the ice cream in there did look rather tasty. \"Well, it is rather hotter here than back home...\" she had to admit. \"Come on.\" Budderball invited as he climbed up to get some ice cream. \"That pup's got a one tract stomach.\" Patch sighed about Budderball's mannerisms. \"You can say that again, dude.\" MudBud said. \"Buddha, MudBud, we'll grab Oddball and Budderball,\" Rosebud devised a plan. \"B-Dawg, Patch, you're on look-out. If the delivery guy comes back, bark twice and distract him to warn us. Got it?\" \"If the delivery guy comes back?\" B-Dawg echoed. \"I just know Patch will deliver a tail-whoopin' of his life!\" \"Mm-hmm...\" Rosebud hummed before running off after her brother and best friend. \"Budderball? Oddball?\" Rosbud called out quietly once inside the vehicle. \"Where are you guys?\" Budderball came out from one of the tubs, his face covered in ice cream. \"Hey, guys, check it out, free ice cream!\" This excited MudBud and Buddha as they decided to join in. \"I ain't scared of nuthin'.\" B-Dawg scoffed as a cat was on its way. \"Hey, B-Dawg, isn't that Ms. Mittens?\" Patch asked. B-Dawg turned to the cat who then hissed which made him scream and run away. \"What're you doing here?\" Rosebud groaned that the look-out was away from his position. \"You're supposed to be on the look-out with Patch.\" \"I thought I could protect you better from in here.\" B-Dawg bragged as he lied about why he was really in there. 'I might as well join them I have feeling we're in for yet another adventure.' Patch thought to himself with a sigh. Once all the dogs were in, the delivery man locked them up as it was said to be shipped to 'Ferntiuktuk, Alaska'. \"I think we just got locked in.\" Oddball said. \"Yep, we did.\" Patch sighed. \"Oh, goody, company.\" Colette smiled as she appeared from behind the ice cream. \"Collie?\" Patch asked in surprise. \"Oh, hello, Patch.\" Colette smiled. Patch blinked in surprise to see his girlfriend. \"Mom was in the truck?\" Scruffy and Dot asked in surprise and confusion. \"What was she doing in there?\" Vincent asked as he was petting Snow White in his lap. \"Apparently she had a craving for ice cream and followed the truck and where she had somehow got into the truck without anyone noticing.\" Patch said. \"Girls and their sweets...\" Scruffy sighed as he scratched behind his ear. \"So, anyway...\" Patch then continued. \"This is how we go into Alaska by accident.\" \"Come on, guys, there's a lot of ice cream that you can imagine.\" Colette smiled as she licked her muzzle. \"Well, we might as well have something to eat.\" Patch said. \"They have the best mud pie!\" MudBud smiled. Rosebud found herself unable to resist. \"I guess I could have a little bit of strawberry...\" \"Anyone know where the rocky road ice cream is?\" Patch asked. \"That's my favorite too, I say we follow the path.\" Buddha agreed with the teenager dalmatian. As the dogs got into their ice cream, the delivery man got into his truck and drove off, unknowing of the six canine hostage stowaways who were also on board. \"I just love strawberry ice cream.\" Colette smiled. Rosebud smiled to her. \"Dig in, Oddball!\" \"Are you sure I'm allowed?\" Oddball smiled at the invitation. \"Just remember, no chocolate.\" Budderball warned her. \"I remember.\" Oddball said before heading over to the ice cream Budderball was eating. Budderball smiled as he actually made room for her to join him. \"Awww! They shared their first ice cream together.\" Dot's voice beamed. \"Yes,\" Patch chuckled as he smiled to his daughter who still lived with him. \"I think your cousin Oddball and Budderball are a good example, next to your mother and myself, as puppy love.\" \"Anyway, continue.\" Scruffy said. \"So after that, we didn't know it yet, but we were on our way to Alaska...\" Patch went back to the story.[Chapter 3] Buddy and Molly came for their puppies to visit them, but only found their toys left behind in the field, much to their worry. \"Hey, Buddy, hey, Molly, have you seen Patch or Oddball?\" Atticus asked as he entered the area. \"No, we came to find our pups, but they aren't here.\" Molly frowned. \"Yeah, only their toys are left behind.\" Buddy added in. \"Well, knowing them, they must be getting themselves into some kind of trouble.\" Atticus said. \"Where could they be though?\" Molly frowned, worried since she was a mother after all. \"I don't know, but we better go and find them.\" Atticus said. \"Come on, let's go!\" Buddy sounded urgent. Cherry was on the front porch and gently swinging herself back and forth on the swing. \"Cherry, have you seen Patch?\" Atticus asked. \"He isn't at your house?\" Cherry sounded slightly concerned. \"No and neither is Oddball, and the Buddies are missing too.\" Atticus said. \"That's not good...\" Cherry said. \"I was wondering why I haven't been trampled by a bunch of slobbering, mangy mutts today yet.\" Mo began to come into the area, looking worried along with Angel, Scamp, and his sisters minus Colette. \"I can't smell her scent anywhere.\" Danielle pouted. \"Neither can I.\" Annette added in. \"Same here.\" Scamp and Angel added. \"Oh, where could she be?\" Mo asked, worried. \"Colette's missing too?\" Atticus came to his girlfriend. \"Yeah, she just went out for a bit, I thought it was just to take a nap.\" Mo said. \"This can't be good...\" Atticus held his head. \"Maybe Drell knows something...\" Cherry, Atticus, and Mo then went into the Netherworld to the Witches Council building, but saw a note on the door. \" 'Gone away for a week due to Edipan-The one week a year where magic takes a holiday, including us, see you next week: Drell, Penelope, and Skippy'. \" Cherry read the note aloud. \" OH, COME ON! \" Atticus exclaimed. \"Well, I'm actually relieved in a way, let's go get some pizza, your guys's treat...\" Cherry walked off. \"We can't let the dogs be gone like this though!\" Mo held her back. \"We have to bring them back! They could get hurt!\" \"You do realize that Patch is the strongest dog in the world and is now a familiar, right?\" Cherry asked. \"You just don't understand about the bond between a dog and their owner...\" Mo sighed. \"No, I don't, I'm a cat person...\" Cherry defended. \"Listen, if they are in any danger, I will know it right away.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah, you've got nothing to worry about...\" Cherry said. \"Especially a bunch of mutts that you grew up with, Mo who always fought for you while you just stood there.\" Mo growled like a rough bulldog and tackled Cherry down on the ground, pinning her down aggressively. \" IS THAT A CHALLENGE?! \" \"Temper, temper...\" Cherry grew nervous suddenly. \"I wouldn't dream of challenging you.\" \"Pity, why not?\" Atticus smirked playfully. \"Oh, I feel my combat is for more useful or desirable fighting...\" Cherry got up and dusted herself clean. \"I'm afraid I'm no match for a girl who's lived most of her life on the streets and could bite me if she wanted to like a hostile dog.\" \"In a way, I could.\" Mo said. \"Down, girl...\" Cherry put her hands up. \"Come on, they couldn't have gone too far, we'll look around the neighborhood.\" Atticus and Mo then went with her back to the mortal realm to look around for the missing dogs. Meanwhile, back in the ice cream truck... The dogs were getting tired because of how much ice cream they had consumed. Budderball and Oddball yawned. \"So full...\" MudBud groaned. \"I can barely stay awake.\" \"Same here...\" Oddball groaned. Colette let out a noisy burp. \"Oh! Excuse me...\" \"Better out than in...\" Patch chuckled sheepishly to her. This made the puppies laugh. \"So, what happened after that?\" Dot asked. \"How could you guys not notice that you were moving to a plane?\" \"Well, we were so full, that we fell asleep, like the family at Thanksgiving dinner.\" Patch explained. \"Oh, that makes sense...\" Dot nodded. \"Like when Uncle Rolly has his third dinner.\" \"So, when did you and the others notice you were on a plane?\" Akito asked. \"That's when our adventure began and we met Shasta.\" Patch replied. \"Shasta?\" the others asked. \"Shasta...\" Patch nodded. \"But first, I believe it was Rosebud who had woken up first.\" Rosebud's eyes opened and she looked around to see her brothers and friends. \"Uh, guys?\" she spoke up. \"Wake up! We fell asleep!\" \"What?\" Colette yawned. \"We better then get out of here.\" \"Where we at, dawg?\" B-Dawg asked. \"I see the light...\" Buddha whispered as he climbed up a few ice cream tubs to follow the light. \"Light? That doesn't sound good.\" Patch said. \"Buddha, where are you going?\" Oddball asked in concern. Buddha looked out to see that the light was a window, then looked back to the others. \"I think I see white fluffy things... Kinda like we're flying through clouds.\" \"What? But that's impossible,\" Patch said before his eyes widened. \"Oh, no, I think we're on a plane.\" The other Buddies decided to take a look for themselves. \"Give a fella a paw up.\" Budderball grunted and struggled. \"Come on, I gotcha.\" Oddball decided to help him. \"Uh, I think for safety reasons, I'll give him a lift.\" Patch said before lifting up Budderball by his jersey. \"Okay, Uncle Patch.\" Oddball sighed. \"Don't pull his paw!\" B-Dawg, MudBud, and Buddha called out, remembering last time. \"Don't worry, I got him.\" Patch muffled as he picked Budderball up by his jersey thankfully enough. \"Do I even wanna know what happens if you pull his paw?\" Oddball asked the Buddies. \"He farts.\" Rosebud shuddered. \"I had to ask...\" Oddball grimaced while Budderball smiled sheepishly to that fact. \"I don't mean to always fart when my paw is pulled.\" Budderball smiled sheepishly. \"It's okay, Budderball, it's only nature...\" Colette merely sighed, then looked out the window. \"I wonder where we're all going?\" \"If I could see the land, I could tell.\" Patch said. \"I hope we land soon then...\" Colette sighed. Oddball looked overwhelmed and started to whine and whimper. \"What's wrong, Oddy?\" Patch asked his niece. \"I want Jessica...\" Oddball said as she sounded like she was going to cry. \"Is Jessica your person?\" Budderball asked. \"Mm-hmm...\" Oddball sniffled. \"Jessica is also my boy Atticus's sister.\" Patch then added in. \"Wow.\" Buddha said, amazed. Budderball began to comfort Oddball. Oddball looked to him and nuzzled against him with tears in her eyes as she felt terribly homesick already. \"Dudes, I don't think I've ever seen Budderball do that before.\" MudBud whispered to B-Dawg and Buddha. \"Mm-mm...\" B-Dawg shook his head. \"Perhaps Budderball has found himself his one true soul mate which only comes once in a lifetime for the perfect match.\" Buddha theorized. \"Yeah.\" Patch smiled. \"I wonder when I'll meet mine.\" Rosebud frowned. \"Oh, give it time, dear...\" Colette soothed. \"I didn't think I'd ever meet my special someone after Scamp met Angel...\" she then looked to the teenager dalmatian puppy with a dreamy sigh. \"Then I met Patch...\" Patch looked back to her with a smile and even gave her a charming wink. \"Dad... Don't make it gross...\" Scruffy groaned. \"Did Rosebud find her soulmate?\" Dot asked. \"As a matter of fact, even though none of us knew it, Rosebud was going to meet her soulmate in Alaska.\" Patch said. \"Aww!\" Dot, Estelle, and Snow White cooed while Scruffy looked annoyed. \"Blegh! Girl stuff!\" Scruffy stuck his tongue out in disgust. \"Yuck!\" \"It might be disgusting to you now, son, but later on, you might find it magical.\" Patch said. \"Hmph... If you say so...\" Scruffy rolled his eyes. Patch sighed. \"I guess I'll skip to the plane landing.\" \"So, what did the humans say when they saw you in their plane?\" Vincent asked. \"Uh, they didn't exactly know we were there, we sorta dropped into Alaska actually.\" Patch explained. \"Wait, you mean they land their packages?\" Snow White asked. \"That's usually what they do with deliveries, so we literally dropped into Alaska with the ice cream.\" Patch replied. \"At least we had a parachute.\" \"That must've been really scary.\" Dot commented. \"I was, but Budderball and myself were doing our best to be brave for our soulmates.\" Patch said. \"Oh, how romantic~\" Dot fluttered her eyelashes. \"Guh...\" Scruffy rolled his eyes. \"If you're just gonna tell us a love story, I might as well lick from that drinking fountain those humans keep using.\" \"You are staying right here.\" Dot said. \"Fine...\" Scruffy groaned. \"Just get to the good parts already!\" \"So, we were flying through Alaska about to drop in...\" Patch continued. The Buddies and Oddball screamed while Patch and Budderball comforted Colette and Oddball the best that they could. Their landing was kind of rough and soft at the same time. They landed on a slope at first and then began to tumble and roll down after they landed. Patch began to hold Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies close to him so they wouldn't be too scared and where Budderball did the same thing to Oddball. There was mostly screaming and shaking. Back at home... Cherry, Atticus, and Mo put posters everywhere about the lost dogs. \"These should get lots of people to help us find them.\" Mo said. \"Remind me again why I'm here?\" Cherry frowned. \"Mo is your friend, you wanna help her, you care about her, you're worried...\" Atticus replied. \"Nice try.\" Cherry stapled, then accidentally hit her thumb and yelled out. \"AAAAUGH! OWW! GOD! \" \"You okay, Cherry?\" Mo asked. \"Fine...\" Cherry whispered painfully as she looked to her throbbing thumb. \"Hello.\" Drell said from behind Cherry. \"GAH!\" Cherry fell flat on the ground and shivered. \"I hate it when he does that...\" \"Some goth you are...\" Mo folded her arms slightly at Cherry's scare from the warlock. \"Hey, Drell, can you help us find Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, I dunno, I'm on vacation because of Edipan,\" Drell replied. \"It's the one week a year where magic takes a holiday.\" \"And that incident with my thumb?!\" Cherry glared. \"That was karma,\" Drell explained. \"You've been rather mean lately, so you kinda deserved that.\" \"Listen, if I have to help them search for the mutts, you are helping too!\" Cherry glared, but then gulped once she realized who she was talking to. \"Um, please.\" Drell rolled his eyes with a smirk. \"I suppose I could take one day out of my life to help you.\" \"Oh, thank you, Drell!\" Atticus smiled as he hugged Drell tightly slightly, forgetting about his incredible strength that was stronger than anyone else's including He-Man's strength. \"Mother...\" Drell whimpered in slight pain. \"Oh, sorry about that...\" Atticus let go. \"Is anything broken?\" \"I'll be fine...\" Drell said, then cracked his back. \"Ah, there we go.\" \"I'm so sorry, I sometimes forget how strong I am.\" Atticus said. \"It just makes you cuter...\" Mo cooed. Atticus smiled bashfully to her. \"So you'll help us?\" Cherry smiled nervously to Drell. \"Yes, I will.\" Drell said before bringing out his crystal ball. \"Uhh...\" Cherry blinked. \"I take this with me everywhere...\" Drell made her carry it. Cherry stumbled back slightly as she held the crystal ball as it was quite heavy for her. \"Do you need to get something else?!\" \"Nah, I just wanted to make you carry it...\" Drell smirked. \"Luckily for all of us, just because it's a magical holiday, it doesn't mean our magic gets taken away, I mean, if fairy godparents don't cast magic for 24 hours, they'll get 'magical build-up'.\" \"Don't worry, Cherry, I'll carry it for him.\" Atticus said, taking the heavy crystal ball off her hands and where to him it was like hold a rubber ball. Cherry gasped for air and panted heavily. Mo felt Cherry's arms. \"Man, you really need to work-out more.\" \"I'm fine...\" Cherry glared. \"Are you kidding? Your arms are as weak as noodles.\" Drell said. Atticus then used his magic and made a magical cannonball appear and where it landed in Drell's hands which caused him to fall to the ground, telling the strong warlock to leave Cherry alone. Cherry looked at her own arms and sighed. \"I am rather weak...\" \"No, you are not, you just need to exercise more.\" Atticus assured her while Drell while grunting as he tried to lift up the magical canonball, but for some reason, couldn't. \"Give up?\" Mo asked Drell. \"Never...\" Drell mumbled out painfully and troubledly. \"I don't know.\" Cherry frowned. \"I can get you into physical shape.\" Atticus told her, showing one of his arm muscles. \"Thanks, Atticus, but I don't think I could handle having your strength.\" Cherry replied. \"No, no, I'm going to be your training instructor and going to get you stronger the normal way.\" Atticus said. \"Oh..\" Cherry said. \"But never mind that now, let's get those dogs back!\" Atticus said. \"Please get this thing off me...\" Drell begged. \"Oh, right.\" Atticus said before easily lifting up the magical canon ball. \"Guh...\" Drell groaned as he then sat up. \"Now, let's find out where Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies are.\" Atticus said as he tossed the crystal ball to Drell who caught as he was pushed back by the force of the catch. \"Why do I always get hurt now?!\" Drell groaned in agony. \"You torture Cherry all the time it only seems fair that I do the same to you.\" Atticus said as he crushed the magical cannonball in his hands. Drell smiled sheepishly. Atticus soon dusted the dust of the magical item he once had in his hands off of them like a tough guy. Drell sniffled then sneezed. Cherry smirked. 'It's allergies!\" Drell defended. \"Uh-huh...\" Cherry sounded doubtful. Atticus then helped Drell up with just one hand by his shirt collar. \"Easy!\" Drell chuckled sheepishly. \"Now, let's find out where your dogs are, huh?\" \"Crystal ball, crystal ball in my friend's hand, Who is the fairest in this land?\" Cherry asked. 'Not you.' the crystal ball mocked. \"Crystal ball in Drell's hand, Who is actually now the most strongest and fiercest one in the land of both Mortal and Supernatural Realms?\" Mo asked. \"'Why, Atticus Fudo, of course.\" the crystal ball replied. \"Traitor...\" Drell folded his arms with a scoff. \"Hey, I'm only telling you the truth he really is.\" The crystal ball smirked. \"Cut the smart aleck undertone and I'll break you.\" Drell threatened. \"Okay, now, tell us, where are Patch, Oddball, and the Air Buddies.\" Mo asked the crystal ball. \"Well, for one thing, they definitely are not any where close where you guys are.\" The crystal ball said before showing where Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies were. \"Is that the Frozen Tundra?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, no, they're gonna become-...Pupsicles...\" Cherry said before smirking at herself and laughing at the pun she made. \"Get it?! Pupsicles?!\" \"They are in Alaska.\" The crystal ball told them. \" ALASKA?! \" Atticus, Mo, Cherry, and Drell asked out of shock. \"Looks like we might need to get there by...\" Drell gulped. \"Plane.\" \"What's the matter...?\" Cherry teased. \"Afraid of flying, witchy boy?\" \"Magic works differently for warlocks and witches in places like ALASKA! \" Drell glared before getting lifted up by Atticus, telling the strong warlock to cool it. \"Sorry, Atticus, I don't like planes...\" he then said quickly apologetically. \"We'll have to get there by plane since magic works differently for your magic and I'm not taking any chances teleporting there.\" Atticus said before setting Drell back on the ground. \"How about a compromise?\" Cherry suggested. \"Two of us will go by plane and one of us will go on a broomstick.\" \" \"NOT IT!\" Atticus and Mo said quickly. \"Dangit...\" Cherry growled. \"Or you could just go there by package.\" The crystal ball said. \"Uh, a problem with that, we're all too big to fit in a package.\" Mo said. \"It's not like we're chipmunks or something and could get delivered by mail all the way to Alaska.\" The crystal ball began to show them how big the plane was and how big and package was with ice cream. \"Mm, ice cream...\" Mo smiled, then hit herself. \"No, no, stay focused...\" \"That looked like it's big enough to handle a few passengers.\" Drell said. \"A few, yes, you, would take up the whole space.\" Cherry said. \"I'll shrink down.\" Drell said. \"Oh!\" Mo had an idea. \"Is there a spell to make you like around our age?\" \"Actually, yes, there is.\" Drell said. \"I thought so,\" Mo smirked. \"Why don't you make yourself our age so you'll fit in?\" \"50 bucks says he's even more obnoxious and a pain...\" Cherry muttered. \"I heard that!\" Drell glared before looking at Mo. \"And I will do that, but I'll make sure my body gets to be like Atticus's body.\" Mo glanced at him. \"Just don't overdo it, K?\" \"Okay.\" Drell said. \"What's the spell?\" Mo asked. \"Please, allow me...\" Drell took out his wand and gave it to Atticus. \"Cast the spell.\" \"How come he gets to cast it?\" Cherry pouted. \"Because I don't trust you to cast the spell with how seem to love it every time I'm tortured for all the times I've tortured you.\" Drell told her. \"Heh, don't be silly...\" Cherry smiled nervously. \"Now, what was that spell Sabrina used on Salem once?\" Atticus tried to think. \"I think I got it...\" he then recited the warlock teen spell and cast it on Drell, making him into a teenage boy. \"Well, how do I look?\" Drell asked as he was now a lot younger and looked rather thin and his hair seemed slightly shorter. Cherry's eyes widened and she blushed at the sight. \"I am good.\" Atticus smiled, happy with his work before using his magic to bring up a mirror to show Drell's reflection. \"Hey, not bad...\" Drell smiled at his youthful self. \"You do look nice, Drell...\" Mo had to admit. \"Excuse me...\" Cherry said hoarsely before walking off, there was then a splash of water heard and she walked back with a goofy smirk and was soaking wet. \"Let's see if the spell also allowed me to become stronger.\" Drell said before trying to lift up Atticus. Atticus sighed. \"You can try.\" Drell began to grunt as he tried to lift up Atticus even by trying to throat lift him, but that didn't even seem to work. \"Either he's too strong for you or you don't have any powers...\" Cherry said, then looked away with a smirk. \"Either way, I vote with both odds.\" Drell began to try to do it again before getting throat lift up by Atticus just to end his squirming. \"Anyway, let's move on before the dogs become pupsicles...\" Cherry said before cracking up again. \"Oh, I kill myself!\" \"I agree, but I think we'll need to wait for the next delivery to Alaska.\" Atticus said. \"Why's that?\" Drell asked while choking on the throat lift. \"I think we just missed them.\" Mo said. \"Oh, darn the luck...\" Cherry shrugged innocently. \"We are going to the next delivery.\" Atticus said while without knowing it still having Drell in his throat lift hold. Drell looked very dizzy and unwell now. Atticus looked back. \"Oh, sorry!\" he then let go. Drell fell flat on the ground and deeply inhaled. \"I deserved that.\" \"Yes, yes, you do.\" Cherry nodded. Drell growled up at her. Cherry stuck out her tongue and made a goofy face. \"Now, how do we get to Alaska without teleportation or delivery?\" Mo wondered. \"I doubt our parents would take us all the way there.\" \"We are still getting there by delivery, the same way the dogs got there.\" Drell said. \"Why do we have to go by delivery?!\" Cherry complained. \"It makes no sense!\" \"Stop whining.\" Atticus told her. Mo sighed as she looked very worried. \"I know they're all okay as long as they have Patch, but I just hope the puppies will be fine.\" \"Of course they will be okay.\" Drell said. \"I just worry...\" Mo said. \"I've raised Angel since she was born.\" \"It's true.\" Angel said. \"Oh, Angel!\" Mo jumped back. \"Sorry, Mo, but I thought you could use some help,\" Angel looked up to her mistress. \"We've been through a lot together.\" \"That we have.\" Mo smiled back to her now teenager puppy.[Chapter 4] Meanwhile back with Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies... \"Gosh, guys,\" Budderball panted as he came out first. \"I can't believe we're alive.\" \"That was hot, dawg!\" B-Dawg commented. Rosebud sniffed the ground and looked confused. \"What's wrong with the grass? It's cold!\" \"It's my dream come true,\" Budderball gushed before trying to eat his surroundings. \"We're surrounded by vanilla ice cream!\" \"Where's the dirt?\" MudBud whimpered. \"Buddies, Oddball, Colette, I don't think we're in Fernfield anymore.\" Patch said. \"This ice cream isn't sweet, it isn't ice cream, IT'S MY WORST NIGHTMARE! \" Budderball suffered the most. \"I don't know where we are, Uncle Patch, but we have to go back home.\" Oddball replied. \"Yeah, but which way is home?\" Colette asked. MudBud sniffed. \"It all smells the same... How are we gonna find our way home?\" \"Patch, why don't you teleport us home?\" Colette asked. \"Of course!\" Patch face-pawed. \"Alright... Everyone gather around!\" The Buddies, Colette, and Oddball gathered around the teenage dalmatian. \"Here we go!\" Patch called before concentrating to teleport them back home. They began to wait for the magic to happen. \"Any second now...\" Patch said. Nothing seemed to be happening. Patch sighed, he then stood up on his hind legs and took off his collar. \"What is wrong with you?!\" he then glared at his collar since it wasn't using its magic like it should have been. The magic began to start to glow on it, but then stop as it seemed as though it wasn't teleporting them out. \"What in the world?\" Patch glared angrily. \"What is it, Patch?\" Colette asked as she came to his side. \"My medallion isn't working.\" Patch said. \"Why not?\" Colette asked. \"I-I'm not sure, I think it's stuck.\" Patch frowned. \"Now what do we do?\" Budderball asked. Patch sighed. \"I'm not sure, let's just hope we can get back home.\" \"What if we never get home?\" Oddball sniffled. \"What if I never see Jessica ever again?\" \"Yes, we will and you will see Jessica again.\" Budderball assured her. \"You think so?\" Oddball asked with a sniffle. \"I know so.\" Budderball said. Oddball sniffled still. Budderball nuzzled against her. \"Come on, we can do this, your uncle's been through worse with us.\" \"Worse?!\" Oddball yelped. \"Uh, he means that in a good way, Oddy!\" Rosebud tried to calm her down. \"Come on, we better find a place to stay before it becomes night.\" Patch said. \"Stick with us, Oddball.\" Colette advised. Oddball came closer to her fellow puppies as Patch and Colette took the lead. \"I swear, the more I travel around snow, the more it reminds me of escaping Cruella DeVil...\" Patch sighed. \"Thank goodness we never have to worry about that devil woman ever again.\" \"Amen.\" Colette nodded firmly in agreement. \"She would have killed me in that cake factory.\" Oddball said. \"Don't worry, Oddball, she won't get you here, I'm sure of it.\" Patch promised his niece. \"I'll bite her if she tries to hurt you again.\" Budderball growled once he heard that Oddball was almost killed. This caused Oddball to smile at Budderball's admiration. Budderball smiled bashfully to her. Oddball smiled back. 'I think Budderball might have just found his soulmate.' Rosebud thought to herself with a smile. The dogs kept walking through the snow, hoping to find someone who could help them around this winter wonderland. Unfortunately they wouldn't find anyone, at least, not on the first day. \"I wonder why your magic didn't work,\" Akito spoke up. \"Could it have been because of Edipan?\" \"Unfortunately, yes, because you see, Equestrian magic gets blocked from being used for one whole week in the human world.\" Patch said. \"I don't remember that part of the deal!\" Vincent gasped. \"It's life...\" Patch sighed. \"I didn't know it was Edipan until Cherry, Atticus, Mo, and Drell came for us to bring us back home.\" \"So, where did you, Mom, cousin Oddball, and the Buddies sleep?\" Dot asked. \"Unfortunately, it got dark, but we luckily found a cave big enough for all of us to sleep in.\" Patch replied. \"Hey, look, there's a cave,\" Oddball smiled. \"Maybe we can stay there for the night.\" \"It's better than nothing.\" B-Dawg agreed. \"Then let's get inside.\" Colette said. \"Agreed, we'll go out and find someone to tell us where we are in the morning.\" Patch said. Oddball sniffled as she still felt homesick. \"Looks pretty dark in there...\" B-Dawg nervously stood outside of the cave as the others went inside ahead of him. There was then a night owl hooting. \"On second thought, it looks cozy in there...\" B-Dawg then hurried himself inside. \"You do realize that was just an owl, right?\" Patch asked. \"Uh, I knew that...\" B-Dawg replied, still slightly scared. \"I was just worried he'd get you guys if I didn't join you.\" \"You do realize that owls eat mice, right?\" Colette asked. \"How do you know there isn't a super mecha owl that can eat dogs?\" B-Dawg whimpered. \"It's okay to be scared, we're in a whole new place,\" Patch said to him. \"We're a lot farther from home than we were the last time.\" \"Patch is right.\" Colette said. \"I-I'm just not used to this world, it's something new to me.\" B-Dawg pouted. \"This is new to all of us.\" Rosebud said. \"It's okay, I promise, we'll all be okay.\" Patch told the overwhelmed puppies. The pups all yawned at once, telling Patch and Colette they were tired. \"I think it's time for bed now.\" Patch said. \"Yes,\" Colette agreed. \"We've all had a long day.\" Budderball began to get closer to Oddball for his reason was so she wouldn't be cold. Oddball shivered, then suddenly felt warm. \"I thought you could use something warm.\" Budderball smiled to her. \"Oh, um, thank you, Budderball.\" Oddball smiled back to him. \"You're welcome.\" Budderball smiled. Oddball smiled back. \"I guess this is comfy... Not as comfy as my own bed though...\" \"Don't worry, we'll find help in the morning.\" Budderball comforted her. Oddball smiled before yawning and falling right to sleep. The puppies, despite being cold, fell asleep instantly, mostly from their full bellies with the ice cream. Back in Fernfield, the Buddies' owners and Jessica began to look everywhere for them. \"Oh, where could she be?\" Jessica pouted that Oddball was lost. \"I took very good care of her.\" \"She must be where the Buddies are, wherever they are.\" One of the kids said. Jessica sniffled. \"Ah, Jessie, don't cry, we'll find them...\" Christopher soothed the girl of his dreams. \"I just hope they're alright.\" Jessica said. Molly looked extremely devastated. They all would have to get some sleep and hope and pray that Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies would be safe. Cherry, Atticus, Mo, and Drell were in hiding spots as they waited for a delivery truck for Alaska. \"How much longer?\" Drell whispered. \"Soon...\" Mo said. \"There should be a truck making a round any minute now...\" \"Maybe this is a bad time, but I should probably give you the schedules for the ice cream deliveries to Alaska.\" The crystal ball told them sheepishly. \"Strike two and you're gonna be a toy for Skippy's brat.\" Drell threatened. \"Atticus, please don't let mean old Drell do that to me.\" The crystal ball begged. \"We could've known at a better time,\" Atticus said to the ball. \"When are good times?\" \"In the morning/afternoon.\" The crystal ball said. \"Looks like we have to get up bright and early.\" Drell said, then looked Cherry in the eyes. \"Is that okay with you?\" \"Whatever you say...\" Cherry smiled dreamily at his teenage boy form. \"Oh, great, here we go again.\" Atticus groaned. Drell waved his hand in front of Cherry's eyes and she seemed lost and hypnotized. \"Maybe I should have made you less appealing than the way you look now.\" Atticus said. \"I haven't seen someone drool over me this much, since, well, Hilda,\" Drell smirked and then sighed dreamily. \"Ah, Hilda~...\" \"Cherry, please stay focused.\" Mo said. \"I am...\" Cherry replied. \"Then look away from Drell.\" Mo said. \"Do I have to?\" Cherry asked. Drell grabbed her head and turned her head which made a slight crack noise. \"Ow.\" Cherry said ,though sounded like she wasn't in very much pain. Atticus used his magic and which healed Cherry's neck and she was able to move it around without any pain. \"Better?\" he then asked. \"Better...\" Cherry rubbed her neck now. Drell gulped out of nervousness even if he didn't mean to do that he feared he would be tortured for doing that either way. \"I'm watching you.\" Atticus warned Drell. \"Of course...\" Drell chuckled sheepishly. \"Anyway, we better get to sleep.\" Mo said. \"Sleep out here?\" Cherry groaned, sounding like her old self. \"No, we're gonna sleep inside tents.\" Drell said. \"Yeah, but outside?\" Cherry replied. \"I've slept outside all my life.\" Mo huffed in defense. \"It's either this or miss the next delivery?\" Atticus asked. Cherry sighed. \"Fine... Where do we get the tents?\" Drell then used his magic and two tents appeared. \"Magic must be on the fritz...\" he then said. \"I was trying to make one big enough for all of us... Okay, girls in one tent and boys in the other.\" he then arranged. \"Okay.\" Mo and Cherry said. \"Come on, Atticus, let's get some shut-eye.\" Drell said to Atticus. \"Agreed.\" Atticus said. The four then split up to get some sleep. Angel came into the girls' tent and snuck in underneath Mo's sleeping bag. Danielle and Annette joined them while Scamp joined Atticus and Drell. \"Shh...\" Angel warned her boyfriend's sisters. Danielle and Annette nodded as they snuck inside the tent. \"Scamp, I don't know if it'll be safe for you in here, me and Atticus are first gonna go at it in wrestling this tents are so strong, we won't move it while wrestling until we go to sleep.\" Drell said. \"How'd you know I was here?\" Scamp frowned. \"I could just tell,\" Drell said. \"The only way for you to survive our wrestling is if you had incredible strength.\" Scamp sighed. \"Alright, I'll go with the girls then...\" \"Scamp, there is a way for you to get incredible strength and I am the answer you seek.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, yeah?\" Scamp smirked to him. \"Get some sleep first, you guys had a long travel.\" Atticus said. Scamp sighed. \"Well, okay, I'll sleep just this once... Anything to get my sister back.\" \"Great.\" Atticus said. Scamp hugged him. \"Good night.\" \"Good night, boy, and thanks for our first adventure together.\" Atticus then smiled very thankful to the schnauzer puppy since that adventure reunited him with his parents and older sister. Scamp gave a wink and went to get some sleep with the others. \"Well then, shall we?\" Drell asked Atticus. \"Hm?\" Atticus turned over sleepily. \"Shall we what?\" \"Get inside the tent and sleep.\" Drell said. \"You get in...\" Atticus was already comfortable. \"I'm not gonna bite.\" \"Alright.\" Drell said. \"Night, sir...\" atticus yawned sleepily. \"Night, Atticus...\" Drell climbed in beside him. \"Did he sleep on top of Atticus?\" Scruffy's voice asked. \"Can't say...\" Patch replied. \"I don't think so.\" \"He almost did.\" Atticus said, overhearing the story. The kids and puppies looked up and over to the grown up Wiccan. \"Couldn't help but overhear,\" Atticus smiled. \"What's up, guys?\" \"I'm telling them about Oddball's first adventure with the Buddies,\" Patch smiled back at his owner since puppyhood. \"Um, any open flights to Alaska yet?\" \"Nope, not yet.\" Atticus shook his head. \"Aww...\" the kids groaned in disappointment. \"I wonder if Eliza and her family are having any trouble in their Comvee.\" Estelle sighed. \"Don't worry, I'm sure there will be a flight to Alaska soon.\" Atticus assured them. Vincent sighed. \"I hope you're right, Dad...\"[Chapter 5] Snow White yawned and stretched, then took a small walk around. \"I'll be right back, I wanna take a walk.\" \"Go ahead, Snow.\" Patch allowed her to go. Scruffy growled with a grin, then chased the cat. \"OH, COME ON!\" Snow White whined as she was chased. \" SOMEONE SAVE ME FROM THIS- \" The other people looked bewildered as Snow White mewed and hissed in distress as Scruffy chased her. \"Wow, I don't think I would even want to translate that.\" Vincent said. The other kids shook their heads. \"Where did she learn such language?\" Atticus folded his arms. \"Don't look at me!\" Vincent shrugged. They continued to look at him. \"Okay, so I might have said a few bad words when I was with Sykes.\" Vincent said. \"Oh?\" Atticus asked. \"Sorry, Dad, but I really didn't like him, he was a terrible man...\" Vincent replied. \"I never liked him.\" \"Uh, maybe we should get back to the story.\" Akito said. \"Let's wait until Scruffy and Snow White tire each other out.\" Patch suggested. The others then nodded. Snow White growled as she came back after being chased. \"Why do you always gotta chase me?!\" \"Sorry, dog instincts,\" Scruffy smirked. \"Maybe you should chase mice.\" \"No, thank you.\" Snow White said. \"A mouse!\" Vincent pointed to a fleeing rodent across the floor. \"Get it, Snow White!\" \"Get it, Vincent,\" Snow White deadpanned in a dry monotone before smirking. \"I learned that one from my big brother.\" \"You are definitely Garfield's sister.\" Vincent glared. Snow White smirked innocently. \"So, do you wanna take over for now?\" Patch asked Atticus as he had a part in the story as well. \"Sure, now, where was Patch? Oh, yes...\" Atticus said. Flashback to Atticus's and Drell's tent. \"Don't even think about it.\" Atticus said, without looking at Drell. \"What did I do?\" Drell rolled his eyes with a scoff. \"I didn't do anything!\" \"You were about to sleep on top of me.\" Atticus told him. \"Oh, right, sorry.\" Drell said sheepishly. \"Alright...\" Atticus then yawned and went back to sleep. Drell smirked and rolled on top of Atticus on purpose, pinning him down. \"One! Two! Three! You're out!\" he then laughed in victory. Atticus then lifted the strong warlock off him and even if it wasn't intentional, pushed him straight up and out the tent. Cherry came out of her tent briefly. \"Hopefully I can do this without anyone looking...\" she then knelt by the bushes with her eyes shut with a peaceful smile. \"Ah...\" Drell yelled out and crashed against her. Luckily, she wasn't crushed, but the strong warlock did crash close by the girls' tent. \"Too bad that didn't kill me...\" Cherry mumbled and slightly narrowed her eyes. \"Okay, I deserved that.\" Drell groaned out of pain from the crash. \"Please stop talking...\" Cherry said. \"What are you doing?\" Drell asked. \"What do you think I'm doing?\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"Trying to sleep?\" Drell guessed. \"Sure, why not?\" Cherry scoffed as she sat in the bushes. \"I'm trying to sleep in the bushes.\" \"Uh, Cherry, you should know, that' poison oak.\" Drell warned. Cherry scoffed. \"Nice try, Drell, but that's not gonna work on-...Itchy... Itchy...\" she then ran around in a circle. \"ITCHY, ITCHY, ITCHYYYYY! \" \"I told you.\" Drell said. Atticus then used his magic on Cherry to make the itching go away while letting Drell feel the itching, but he was too tired to care at the moment. Cherry shivered and cleaned herself up before going back to her and Mo' tent. Drell fell asleep, but scratched himself slightly in his sleep. \"Really, Dad?\" Akito's voice asked, unimpressed. \"Hey, who's side are you on?\" Atticus asked with a laugh. \"There was a time in life where your Aunt Cherry was the butt of Drell's jokes before she started to make his life into a nightmare.\" \"True.\" Akito nodded. \"I still cant believe how mean Drell was to Aunt Cherry...\" Estelle sighed. \"Maybe that's why she hated everything.\" \"Oh, hard to say,\" Atticus shrugged. \"Your aunt once told me that anyone who's goth is born goth and then they become goth at the age they discover who they really are.\" \"So, Dad, what happened in Alaska the next day?\" Scruffy asked. \"Eventually it came to be morning,\" Patch went back to narrating. \"We of course woke up to Buddha's meditation.\" The dogs all woke up as it was morning in the cave now. \"Help, I'm thuck!\" Budderball called out, having his tongue stuck to one of the icicles. \"Help, my thongue ith thuck!\" \"Budderball, what're you doing?\" Rosebud released a long-suffering sigh. \"I thought ith wath a lollipop...\" Budderball struggled to get free. Patch sighed before helping Budderball out. Oddball and Colette winced as the tongue was then free. \"Must you always think with your stomach?\" Patch sighed to the bottomless stomached puppy. \"Sorry.\" Budderball frowned. Buddha was shown outside of the cave first and was still meditating as the others came out. \"Uh, Buddha, you ready to start looking for someone to tell us where we are?\" Oddball asked. \"Hmm?\" Buddha looked to her, then followed her. \"Come on, hopefully someone else is awake and they can help us.\" Oddball walked with the others. \"Yeah.\" Patch said. \"Maybe we should have a race along the way.\" Colette said. \"A race in this weather?\" Patch asked her in surprise. \"Come on,\" Colette grinned. \"Let's have some fun.\" \"Yeah, come on, let's have a little race.\" Oddball and Budderball smiled. \"Well, alright, on your marks... Get set... Go!\" Patch said before running with them. The dogs laughed as they enjoyed their race. The running went on for a while though. \"It feels like we've been running in circles.\" Rosebud panted. \"Well, at least we haven't been encountered with any wild animals yet.\" Oddball panted. \"Hey, where did MudBud go?\" Patch wondered. MudBud poked his head out and buried himself underneath a huge snow hole he had created. The others came to him as he was digging lower and lower to find some dirt to lather himself in. \"Yo, if you keep diggin' you're gonna end up in China!\" B-Dawg told his dirty brother. \"I agree.\" Colette said. \"Is there dirt in China?\" MudBud asked. \"'Cuz if there is, I wanna keep digging!\" \"MudBud, get out of there before you freeze!\" Colette called. \"Aw, alright...\" MudBud crawled out and he looked totally different, there was no dirt or grime all over his fur. \"Uh, MudBud, you look different.\" Patch said. \"What is it?\" MudBud looked around himself, not seeing it himself just yet. \"You look, uh, um...\" Patch wasn't quite sure how to say it. Buddha gasped, then dropped his voice low to a whisper. \"Guys, I'm sensing someone else's presence.\" \"Is it good or bad?\" Colette asked. \"What're you talking about?\" Oddball asked as she tried to find someone the golden puppy was referring to. \"I don't see anything.\" \"Over there, by that tree!\" Budderball saw it. \"I saw something!\" The others turned, but they saw no one there now. \"There he is!\" B-Dawg found it then. \"It was this huuuuge wolf!\" \" RUUUUUN! \" the Buddies cried out before running away. \"Hey, wait for me!\" Oddball called out. The 'wolf' saw them all fleeing away, so he decided to go after them. Only, he wasn't a wolf, he was actually a Siberian Husky pup. \"Wait, you aren't a wolf, you're just a puppy.\" Patch said. Oddball and the Buddies kept running however. \"I've never seen a puppy like you around home before.\" Colette added in. \"Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you guys and your puppies.\" the pup replied. \"It's okay, they are just new to this place.\" Patch said. \"I should say so, I haven't seen you all around here before,\" the pup replied. \"I thought you might be lost.\" \"Well, we might need to go and stop the Buddies and my niece before they get themselves more lost.\" Patch said. \"Come on, I'll help you.\" the pup offered. Patch and Colette smiled, but then gasped. The Buddies and Oddball had stumbled out onto the ice and were now slipping all around. Luckily, they all made it to the other side without cracking the ice. \"Phew!\" Patch and Colette looked relieved for their 'godpuppies'. The Husky pup couldn't help but laugh. \"Hey! What's so funny?\" Oddball glared. \"Yeah, dawg, we just saw a pack of huge wolves!\" B-Dawg added in. \"Well, if you consider one of me a pack of huge,\" the pup laughed. \"Name's Shasta and I'm an Alaskan Husky.\" \"That makes sense why we've never met a husky like yourself.\" Patch said. \"Well, hello, my name's Rosebud,\" the female Buddy introduced herself. \"That's Oddball, her uncle Patch, his girlfriend Colette, and my brothers: B-Dawg, Buddha, Budderball, and MudBud.\" \"So, why do they call you MudBud?\" Shasta asked the usually dirty puppy. MudBud looked in the ice to see his reflection and looked dismayed. \"Oh, no! I'm clean! I'm spotless! Think of a dirty place! Think of a dirty place...\" he then told himself, feeling miserable. \"That's what we were trying to tell you.\" Patch said sheepishly. \"So, where are you guys from?\" Shasta asked the strangers. \"Well, we're from Fernfield, do you know the way back?\" Colette asked. \"I'm afraid I do not,\" Shasta replied. \"Wait...\" he then looked to the golden puppies. \"There's five of you... How did you all get here?\" \"We fell from the sky.\" Budderball said. \"Hm... You guys up for a dog-sled race?\" Shasta sounded like he had been expecting them. \"What's a sled race?\" Budderball asked. \"We should see Bernie, he should help.\" Shasta replied. \"Who's Bernie?\" Colette asked. \"Come with me.\" Shasta led the way. Rosebud didn't seem to have any hesitation in following Shasta.[Chapter 6] Back at the campground... Cherry's hand was placed in a cup of warm water as she was asleep, then a slobbering dog started to lick her face. \"Teller?~...\" she asked with a smirk as she was being licked in her sleep, then took the dog's face and kissed it until her eyes widened and she woke up. \"OH, MY GOD!\" This caused for Mo, Drell, and Atticus wake up. \"What's wrong?\" Mo asked. Cherry grunted and spat up. \"Ugh! Dog slobber!\" The dog barked and panted heavily as he drooled all around. Cherry wiped her face, glaring at the dog. \"Stupid mutt!\" \"Where did this dog come from?\" Mo asked. \"How the heck should I know?!\" Cherry grunted in disgust. The dog barked and went out their tent to point somewhere that looked like a delivery truck. \"You could have just told us about the delivery truck.\" Mo told the dog. The dog stood up and licked her face. Mo laughed. \"Okay, down, boy!\" \"I tried to tell you all, but you were asleep.\" The dog said. \"Why did you lick me?\" Cherry groaned as she sat up while glaring at the slobbering dog. \"I thought that would wake you up.\" The dog said. Cherry lowly growled. Mo narrowed her eyes slightly. \"Mooch, is that you?\" \"Maybe...?\" the dog smiled sheepishly to the tomboy street urchin. \"It is you...\" Mo hugged the sloppy sheepdog. \"Man, I haven't seen you since the Fourth of July when we all left Buster!\" \"You can say that again.\" Mooch smiled. \"You being a good boy for your human?\" Mo asked. \"Uh-huh!\" Mooch looked up to her with a big smile. \"Lots of love and hugs and kisses for me!\" \"Mooch was always the affectionate one...\" Mo smirked quietly. \"Good to see you again.\" \"It's good to see you again too, Mo,\" Mooch smiled before looking at Atticus. \"And Atticus, you look bigger and stronger than the last time I saw you.\" \"Long story, buddy, now if you'll excuse us, we have to get going,\" Atticus said. \"We have a mission and its destination is Alaska.\" \"Well, you'll have to wait until the truck comes back with the ice cream.\" Mooch said. \"Somehow, I knew that's why you'd be here.\" Mo smirked to the sheepdog. \"What can I say? I can't help it when it comes to ice cream.\" Mooch smiled. Mo rolled her eyes with a sigh, but then smiled to him. \"I still remember the first time you joined the Junkyard Dogs...\" Mooch nuzzled against her. \"Same here...\" Mo hugged him still. \"You're no Angel, but you were always such a good dog.\" \"I know.\" Mooch smiled. \"Thanks for the help, Mooch, we'll take it from here.\" Mo said to him. \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. \"Good luck!\" Mooch licked Mo's cheek one last time, then rushed off with a laugh. Mo rubbed her cheek with a smile as one of her old dog friends was going back to wherever he came from. \"So then, looks like we'll need to wait.\" Drell said. \"What do we do until then?\" Cherry asked. About an hour later... \"Got any threes?\" Atticus asked as they were playing cards now. \"Go fish...\" Mo droned. \"This is boring, why can't we just wrestle or lift some stuff?\" Drell asked. \"Because I said so.\" Cherry badmouthed him. \"At least lifting something with our strength would be better than this boring game.\" Drell glared. \"You're a boring game.\" Cherry scoffed. \"Nice come back.\" Drell smirked. Cherry stuck her tongue out, then looked back at her cards. \"Got any eights?\" Drell asked dully then. \"Go fish...\" Cherry said. \" GO FISH YOURSELF! \" Drell yelled in her ear. Cherry winced, then looked rather dizzy and shook her head to relax herself. \"Drell, calm down.\" Atticus told him. \"Okay, I'm sorry,\" Drell said. \"I'm just so BORED !\" \"Maybe after this, we can have a show of feats of strength.\" Mo said. \"Congratulations, Mo, I have an opinion of you now!\" Drell beamed. \"Thank you.\" Mo smiled. \"I'm bored anyway...\" Cherry took the cards and shuffled them since they were hers. \"I wish I had my laptop.\" Atticus used his magic and Cherry's laptop appeared next to her. Cherry then opened her laptop and typed right away, tuning the outside world out. \"So then, looks like we can start the feat of strength.\" Drell said. \"Wanna lose?\" Attius challenged. Drell stuck his tongue out. \"You can do it, Atticus!\" Mo cheered. \"Let's get this thing started.\" Drell said. \"Uh-huh...\" Cherry continued to type away as she was lost in the world of cyberspace. Drell rolled his eyes before they moved over to some crates big enough to be on an ocean liner. \"How much longer?\" Mo sighed as she stared, looking out for the ice cream delivery. \"Must be for a few hours.\" Drell said before he bent down to one of the crates. \"Great...\" Mo sighed. \"Let's have a walk...\" Angel came to her side. \"We haven't had a walk just the two of us in a long time.\" Mo smiled to her puppy, then decided to walk with her. \"Here we go.\" Drell said as he grunted lifting up, not only one crate, but many other crates on top of it. \"Call us if the truck comes!\" Mo called out as she went to take a walk with her puppy. \"We will!\" Atticus called back. \"Come on, girl, let's have some fun.\" Mo smiled to her puppy. Angel smiled back as they had a private walk together, though without leash this time. \"Can I join in with you guys?\" Scamp asked Atticus and Drell. Atticus and Drell looked down. \"Listen, Mutt...\" Drell bent down to the puppy. \"Sure!\" Atticus approved. Drell narrowed his eyes with a low growl. \"Awesome!\" Scamp smiled. \"But first, you'll first need a strength boost.\" Atticus said as he was about to give Scamp a strength boost, but was then crushed by a pile of crates that were thrown by Drell. Drell whistled innocently and walked off as though he hadn't done anything, but then he gulped as he felt the ground shake and the crates began to get lifted up by the very person he tried to crush. \"Heeeey...\" he smiled sheepishly. \"Have a bad fall, eh?\" \"Nice try, Drell.\" Atticus glared while holding up the pile of crates on top of him with just one hand. \"Heh...\" Drell chuckled nervously before lowering his voice. \"Aw, snit...\" Atticus glared before throwing the pile of crates back at him and then giving Scamp the strength boost. Drell nearly stumbled backward and groaned in defeat. \"Serves you right.\" Cherry said without even looking up from the screen. After a little while, Scamp was now as strong as Patch. Scamp stood up slightly and flexed his leg muscles. \"Can someone please help me get these off me since I can't get these off myself?\" Drell grunted, getting some of them off him. Atticus and Scamp merely smirked at the warlock. Atticus and Scamp both then went over to him and helped him out by lifting up all the crates. Drell smiled bashfully. \"No more trying to one-up Atticus.\" Scamp said. \"No more trying to one-up Atticus.\" Drell repeated softly. \"Good.\" Atticus nodded.[Chapter 7] Meanwhile with Patch and the others... Shasta took the others through his hometown as it was covered in endless snow. \"It's like a winter wonderland here.\" Oddball said. \"When's spring, Shasta?\" Colette asked. \"It's always cold here,\" Shasta said. \"It can sometimes get warmer though, but snow is more popular around here than any oher part of the world.\" \"Nice.\" Patch said. Shasta was then leading them to grown-up huskies who seemed to be attahced to a sled, much to his own dismay. \"Are these huskies friends of yours?\" Colette asked Shasta. \"Um... Well...\" Shasta looked and sounded nervous. \"Well, well, well,\" one of the huskies greeted with a scoff. \"If it isn't everybody's favorite 'pupsqueak'?\" \"Um... H-Hello, Francois...\" Shasta greeted anxiously. \"Hello, Felipe, eh, having a nice day today?\" \"It was nice until we met you, right, Francois?\" the golden husky laughed. \"Why don't you pick on someone your own size?\" Rosebud glared at the bigger and older dogs for picking on poor Shasta like that. \"What do we have here, Blondie?\" Francois mocked her as well. \"She's not blonde, she's a golden retriever pup just like her brothers.\" Colette said. \"Just be happy we're not calling you all our lunch.\" Francois retorted. \"Howdy, folks.\" A St. Bernard walked over with a human adult male before glaring at the bullying older dogs. \"Now you two huskies better not cause any trouble for these youngsters, ya hear?\" \"No, sir!\" Francois replied innocently. \"We were just, how you say, shooting the breeze, after all, they are just little puppies!\" \"My Uncle Patch and his girlfriend Colette aren't puppies!\" Oddball growled. The human male then called in a different language. \"Sorry, Squirt, we gotta go!\" one of the huskies said as they then left off through the snow as the human made them move through his sled. \"These folks ain't from around these parts, are they?\" the St. Bernard asked Shasta. \"You got that right, Bernie,\" Shasta replied. \"These are the Buddies, Oddball, Colette, and Patch. They need your help.\" \"Yeah, we need help getting back to Fernfield.\" Patch said. \"Your holiness, do you know the way back?\" Buddha added in. \"Fernfield? Whoa! You are far from home,\" Bernie replied. \"That's a plain right away in the nearest airport to Yukta, that's where the finish line is for the Annual Dog Sled Race.\" \"Come on, Bernie, you can't fight crime wastin' time.\" a human called sharply for the St. Bernard. \"Your owner is a police officer?\" Colette asked. \"Oh, yes, I'm a job dog,\" Bernie replied. \"Sorry, I'm kinda busy right now.\" \"Don't worry, we've got it covered.\" Shasta responded with boosted confidence. \"Huh?\" Rosebud sounded worried. \"We do?\" Colette asked. \"Just trust me, okay?\" Shasta looked to the teenage cocker spaniel. \"Well, okay.\" Colette said. \"Hmm..\" Rosebud hummed, looking rather thoughtful. \"Come with me.\" Shasta took them to another part of the snowy neighborhood. While Shasta lead them somewhere, Patch and Colette got Rosebud closer to him. After a while, back in Fernfield... \"TRUCK!\" Drell called. \"Finally!\" Atticus smiled. Everyone gathered together to get ready for the delivery to Alaska so they could meet with the dogs who were now out of state. And where unknown to them, two familiar golden retrievers would arrive. Cherry was panting and wheezing as they all fit into the box to be shipped off to Alaska. And where Buddy and Molly joined them. \"Oh, no, no, no, NO! \" Cherry groaned at the dog couple. \"No dogs, please!\" \"They are coming with us.\" Drell said. \"Why?\" Cherry glared. \"They're worried parents, it only makes sense.\" Drell replied. \"Guh...\" Cherry groaned. \"I don't like dogs.\" \"They are coming with us.\" Atticus glared. \"You gonna make me make them?\" Cherry glared back. \"We're coming with, they are our pups after all.\" Buddy said, referring to the Buddies. \"Fine...\" Cherry grumbled. Buddy and Molly joined them. Cherry gagged. \"Guh... Dogs...\" \"You can just leave, you know?\" Drell suggested to Cherry. Cherry scoffed and rolled her eyes. Drell narrowed his eyes and threw her out. \"Fine, if that's how you're gonna be, we'll go alone!\" \"Fine!\" Cherry glared back. Drell then closed the door. Cherry bowed her head and sighed. \"Maybe that was a little harsh... Maybe I should go apologize...\" But she then saw the delivery men come by. \"Oh, what to do?\" she then pulled on her hair. \"If I go, I'm trapped with dogs, if I stay, I'm all alone, go in, stay out, in, out... I've never seen Alaska!\" Drell then opened the door, overhearing Cherry's conversation with herself. \"I-\" Cherry was still struggling. Drell grabbed Cherry by her hood and dragged her back inside and flattened her on the ground. Cherry muffled and wiggled, looking up at him. \"You have no choice now...\" Drell told her. The door was soon closed again. \"I should've walked away...\" Cherry looked up. \"And guess what?\" Drell grinned. \"We have a looong journey ahead of us!\" he then laughed. Cherry shook slightly and screamed as she was stuck with him. \"Drell, get off her before I get you off her.\" Atticus glared. \"I'm not touching her...\" Drell put his finger an inch over Cherry's face. \"He's touching me, he's touching me...\" Cherry groaned. \"Not touching~...\" Drell replied. \" AUGH, YOU'RE TOUCHING MEEEEE! \" Cherry whined. \"Not touching, it's called free air.\" Drell rolled his eyes. Atticus, having enough of this already, lifted Drell off of Cherry and decided to keep him that way. \"Okay, okay, I give, I give!\" Drell whined like a child. Atticus then firmly placed Drell back on the floor. Drell gasped and then folded his arms to get some sleep. \"You really don't like it when he tortures Cherry, do you?\" Mo asked her boyfriend. \"What kind of question is that?\" Atticus looked back to her. \"Well, I'm just saying he always tortures her and you always threaten him and now a few months ago, you start torturing him after the sport event.\" Mo said. \"Hey, Cherry's my best friend...\" Atticus defended. \"You think I should just let him hurt my best friend and get away with it?\" \"This looks bad...\" Molly was worried that the two were going to have an argument. \"That isn't what I meant, I only meant to say that Drell has done this for possibly all of Cherry's life.\" Mo defended back. \"Well, Cherry's my best friend and no one should ever hurt as long as I'm around!\" Atticus replied. \"Should we stop them?\" Molly asked Buddy. \"I don't know...\" Buddy replied nervously as it looked like Atticus and Mo were going to have their first fight. \"Maybe me coming along was a bad idea.\" Drell said. \"Anything with you is a bad idea...\" Cherry glared. Drell was about to make a remark, but could see the argument getting serious. \"Why don't you just forget it?!\" Atticus yelled. \" FINE! \" Mo folded her arms and narrowed her green eyes. \"Yeah, maybe me coming along really was a bad idea.\" Drell said. \"Okay, bye.\" Cherry said abruptly to get rid of Drell. Drell began to try to reach for his wand. \"Okay, bye...\" Cherry rushed him. Atticus and Mo didn't appear to be talking to each other anymore. Drell then used his magic and teleported himself out. \"Finally...\" Cherry sighed. She then looked over to Atticus and Mo, thinking those two were only acting like they were fighting. \"Guys..?\" she asked the two. \"You can stop now, he's gone... Guys... Cut it out, stop acting please...\" \"Cherry, I don't think they're acting.\" Buddy said. Mo and Atticus glanced to each other, but still said nothing. The delivery truck was now coming to take the others to Alaska with the ice cream.[Chapter 8] Meanwhile back in Alaska... Shasta has taken the others out to another part as they were among the stabbing snow. \"Here they come.\" he said as he heard a man calling out to his dogs. \"Are we ambushing somebody?\" B-Dawg asked since they were a top a hill. The others then watched as the human male was mushing his Huskies. \"Wait, I think we're watching that team of huskies.\" Colette said. \"Aw, yeah, that's what I'm talkin' about!\" B-Dawg grew excited. \"What're they doing?\" Oddball asked. \"That's sled-racing.\" Shasta told her. \"The greatest sport known to dog. That's how we're gonna get you guys home.\" \"Oh, okay... Wait, what?!\" Oddball asked out of shock. \"Uh, is anyone else confused?\" Rosebud added in, feeling that question was appropriate now. \"I think he's saying that the only way we're gonna get back home is by becoming a dog sled team.\" Oddball said. \"Are you nuts?!\" Colette asked Shasta. \"Besides, we can't leave Patch and Colette!\" Buddha said. \"Don't worry, I have a plan for them.\" Shasta replied. \"Which is?\" Budderball asked. \"Oh, you'll see, my friend, you'll see.\" Shasta smirked. \"Well, as long as it involves all of us, I'm in.\" Oddball smiled. \"Of course,\" Shasta smiled back. \"I'd never exclude any friends if I make any.\" \"Great, so what do we need?\" Patch asked. \"Come on, I'll take you to my place.\" Shasta said, leading them to a whole new way away. \"Okay.\" Patch said. Shasta then led them to where he lived. The others followed and they were coming up to a small home with a shed. \"This is where I live,\" Shasta told them as he led them to a way in besides the door for obvious reasons. \"You guys can stay in the shed.\" \"I hope there's room service.\" Budderball remarked. \"I hope so too.\" Oddball said. Budderball then stopped and stepped aside for Oddball to go in first. \"Budderball?\" the female dalmatian puppy asked. \"After you.\" Budderball replied. \"Oh, thank you.\" Oddball smiled to him, then went in before him. \"Looks like we've got new lovebirds.\" Colette whispered. \"Puppy Love, how adorable.\" Patch whispered back with a smile. Patch magicked himself and Colette inside since they were a little too big to fit through Shasta's secret entrance. \"Guys, check this out!\" Shasta pulled on a tarp with his mouth and pulled it down to show a sled like the human male had with the Huskies from earlier. \"Cool sled.\" Patch smiled. \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, this is super fly, yo!\" B-Dawg added in. \"You got one of your own rides?\" \"My human's dad's sled,\" Shasta explained. \"But he doesn't use it anymore...\" \"Really?\" Colette asked. \"Is it retired?\" \"Well-\" Shasta was about to explain, but he turned his head as they all heard a car outside pulling up. \"Quick, hide!\" \"Oh, I hope medallion gets better.\" Patch said since he would use his magic to make them all invisible, so they seriously had to hide behind whatever they all could. Shasta decided to hide with them. \"Who's coming?\" Colette whispered. \"The humans.\" Shasta quietly replied. A young boy all bundled up came into the shed with a bag around his shoulder and a hockey stick in his other hand. He threw down both objects in frustration and anguish and even kicked them. He spotted the uncovered sled and decided to check it out. \"Is that your boy?\" Patch whispered. Shasta nodded as he came out as the others watched curiously. \"That's Adam, he wants to mush more than anything.\" he then whispered and explained to the ones who didn't know. The boy seemed drawn and influenced to the sled as he got into position. \"He seems like he could be a great musher.\" Patch whispered. \"Adam!\" a different voice called out. \"Dinner!\" \"Must be his mother.\" Colette quietly guessed. Adam got off the sled and covered it back up before he left the shed. The dogs all then hid, not letting the boy see them. Adam let out a small sigh as he then left, never noticing any canine visitors. After the human boy shut the door, the dogs came out. \"Okay, he's gone.\" Patch said. \"Shasta, where are you?\" Adam called from outside. \"Duty calls,\" Shasta replied to that. \"I'll see you guys in the morning, we'll talk then.\" he then took his leave to meet his human. \"You Buddies know what we have to do, right?\" Patch asked. \"I just think it's pretty nice that Shasta and his human have the same dream~\" Rosebud smiled dreamily. \"The dude just needs a team,\" MudBud agreed. \"I think we can help.\" \"Yeah, we just gotta help him.\" Oddball smiled. \"Uh, guys, we need to get home for dinner,\" Budderball spoke up. \"We don't have time to make a team!\" \"Sometimes helping others is the surest way of helping ourselves.\" Buddha replied. \"Zen Dude and New Girl are correctamundo.\" MudBud agreed. \"So then it's decided.\" Colette said. \"It's like Bernie said, the finish line is at the airport.\" B-Dawg pieced together about them going home. \"All in favor of starting a dog-sled team, say aye,\" Rosebud replied. \"Aye!\" \"Aye!\" Budderball, B-Dawg, Buddha, MudBud, Oddball, Patch, and Colette said. \"Okay,\" Rosebud nodded. \"We'll tell Shasta in the morning.\" \"Agreed.\" Patch said. With that, they all decided to get some rest after the big day they all had today. And where their day wasn't as crazy as the others were in the package. There was then a strange growling noise.[Chapter 9] Everyone then looked to Scruffy. Scruffy chuckled sheepishly. \"Sorry...\" \"I guess it's time for snacks.\" Dot said. \"Unfortunately the food courts are closed.\" Atticus said. \"Aww...\" the others groaned in misfortune and hungry. \"But luckily, the change machine works and we can all get some food from the vending machines.\" Atticus then took out a wad of money from his wallet with a smile. \"Or we could use magic.\" Patch said. \"Wouldn't that be unfair to everybody else in the airport?\" Estelle asked. \"Have you seen the food they have in the vending machine?\" Colette asked. \"Luckily, it's not Edipan.\" Atticus whispered to Patch before the two shared a chuckle together over that factoid. The two then used their magic to summon food as it was close to a meal time and they had been stuck in the airport for a while. \"Come along, dearest...\" a British voice calmly said as there was another family coming into the airport. The Fudo family looked to see that it was the Thornberry family much to their surprise. \"Hello, my name is Nigel Thornberry, we'd like tickets to a flight to Alaska, please.\" Nigel told the man behind the desk as he stood with Marianne. \"Eliza?!\" Estelle smiled once she saw the younger Thornberry girl. \"Huh?\" the red-haired girl looked around, then spotted the dark brown-haired girl. \"Estelle!\" The two ran into each other and hugged each other. \"Where's your Comvee?\" Estelle then asked. \"Oh, it's at the mechanic's, so we decided to fly to Alaska instead of going on the road like we usually do.\" Eliza explained. \"Sorry to burst your bubble, but all flights are delayed tonight because of the snow.\" Estelle explained. \"Oh, dang it.\" Eliza pouted. \"So, this is the famous Eliza Thornberry I've been hearing about.\" Dot smiled. \"Oh, hello there, girl,\" Eliza smiled and bent down to the cocker spaniel/dalmatian puppy. \"What's your name?\" \"I'm Dot,\" the puppy smiled. \"Estelle's told me so much about you.\" \"I even told her about your special ability.\" Estelle whispered. \"That's fine,\" Eliza whispered back. \"As you can see, Debbie hasn't told anyone either.\" she then said as she gestured to her older sister who looked bored out of her mind. \"Maybe we should keep her entertained.\" Estelle whispered. \"Good luck with that...\" Eliza hid an eye roll. \"Debbie, why don't you go say hello to your sister's friends?\" Marianne suggested after she and Nigel were told about the flight troubles. \"Great, then I can stare outside and watch the snow fall while I'm at it...\" Debbie deadpanned. She then saw her phone get taken by Dot as a sign of keep away. \"Hey, where's my phone?!\" Dot waved her paw as she carried Debbie's phone in her mouth and zipped away. \" GET BACK HERE! \" Debbie chased after the puppy. Dot then passed it to Scruffy who ran off forward. \"Hey!\" Debbie chased after him now. Scruffy laughed as he ran off with Debbie's cell phone. At first this was annoying to Debbie, but she soon started to finding it rather fun. 'Over here! Over here!\" Snow White even joined in. \"Better not mess up, Cat!\" Scruffy called before tossing her the phone. Snow White laughed as she caught, then it was her turn to run from the blonde teenage girl. But then the game soon ended as Debbie finally caught one of them with her phone. \"Gotcha!\" Debbie picked up her phone. Donnie then jumped up, grabbed the phone and ran with it. \"Hey, I got my phone back, Game's Over, Monkey Boy!\" Debbie glared to her adoptive little brother. \"Looks like the game continues.\" Estelle giggled. \" DONNIE! \" Debbie growled at her brother. Donnie babbled and laughed as he ran with his eldest sister's phone. \"You guys must come for Donnie's birthday party,\" Marianne said to Atticus and Mo. \"We're having it in August, because that's when we found Donnie. You remember that, don't you?\" \"Of course, after Alaska, we'll meet you guys there.\" Mo replied. \"Oh, thank you.\" Marianne smiled. \"It's a date.\" Atticus agreed. \"Oh, it looks like Deborah is having fun with the others.\" Nigel laughed as he saw his older daughter was running with Donnie and the pets to get her cell phone back from them. \"Donnie, get back here with my phone!\" Debbie glared. Donnie babbled in his usual gibberish as he kept running with Debbie's phone. \"Is it bad if I have no idea what that kid is saying?\" Vincent asked, referring to Donnie. \"It's okay, none of us understand him either.\" Debbie said. \"Not even me,\" Eliza admitted with her abilities to speak fluent animal. \"Or Darwin.\" \"Well, maybe I can try to teach him how to speak English.\" Estelle said. \"Good luck with that...\" Eliza replied, but gave a small smile. Estelle smiled back to her. \"So, what were you guys doing?\" Eliza asked. \"We're just about to eat if you'd like to join us.\" Akito invited. \"I could use something to eat.\" Eliza said. \"We haven't eaten since breakfast.\" Debbie actually agreed. Donnie nodded as he came over with the phone. \"Thank you, Donnie.\" Debbie took her phone back. Donnie gave a small chatter as though to say 'you're welcome'. \"Hey, Donnie.\" Estelle smiled to the feral boy. Donnie waved back at her. \"I'm gonna teach you how to talk.\" Estelle said. Donnie babbled to her, not really understanding, but smiled, just happy to see her since he had recognized her outside of his family. Estelle knew that this would possibly be hard, but she was up for it. But for now, it was time to eat. Atticus then used his magic to make the foods that everybody loved the most since they were more or less kind of trapped in the airport for the delayed flights to Alaska. \"Food, meet our bellies.\" Eliza smiled. \"Not bad.\" Debbie approved. Donnie began to babble something out in a way to him say that the food looked delicious. \"Well, let's all dig in.\" Marianne smiled. \"Agreed.\" Nigel said. With that, everybody took a food break. The kids sat at their own table while the adults sat at their own. Nigel and Marianne talked about their journey to Alaska and what they were going to film and shoot there. \"So, what's going on with you guys?\" Eliza asked the Fudos. \"Patch was telling us about his adventure in Alaska with his niece and the Buddies.\" Vincent replied. \"Ooh, I wanna hear it.\" Eliza smiled. Patch sighed, feeling he would have to start all over. \"Okay...\" \"Talking to animals again?\" Debbie scoffed to her younger sister, though luckily, their parents didn't hear her. \"Patch, why don't you just continue on where you were?\" Eliza asked. \"Okay, I'd love to do that,\" Patch sounded relieved. \"Sorry, but I really don't wanna start all over, sorry, Eliza.\" \"It's alright.\" Eliza smiled. Patch smiled back. \"It's just great to see you again, it feels like we haven't seen each other in ages.\" Estelle commented. \"It really does feel like that.\" Eliza said. \"We really missed you.\" Akito said. \"Where's your cousin Felicity?\" Eliza asked. \"We're gonna meet her, Aunt Cherry, and Uncle Forte in Alaska.\" Estelle replied. \"She's so lucky that she doesn't have to be here.\" Debbie pouted. \"Now, Debbie, be patient...\" Eliza sighed. \"Ugh, I can't even get cell phone reception around here!\" Debbie complained. \"Who would you call anyway?\" Akito asked. \"You live in a motor home and travel all over the world.\" \"Yeah, the friends you would make could be your next destination.\" Vincent said. \"I still have friends back in school!\" Debbie folded her arms in annoyance. \"I'd give anything to be with them right now instead of being dragged all around the world in these jungles with wild animals.\" \"Anyway, please continue where you were, Dad.\" Scruffy said. \"So, anyway...\" Patch then continued the story once they were all settled in. Back home in Fernfield, word got out that the Buddies were missing and the kids told the deputy that they were unhappy and devastated by this conclusion. And where he was going to spread the word. Jessica was getting emotionally worried for the loss and disappearance of not only Oddball, but her brother and his own pet as well. The picture of the Buddies, Oddball, Patch, and Colette were then emailed. Bernie's human saw he had a new email, but due to being an old man, he had a hard time understanding how to open it and even had a handbook. Oddball seemed to be shivering, so Budderball lay closer next to her to help keep them both warm. Budderball began to get his jersey off and then covered it over Oddball not caring if he got cold. Oddball shook slightly, then looked up. \"Budderball?\" \"You should be warm,\" Budderball told her. \"I don't want you to freeze.\" \"Aw! Thanks, Budderball.\" Oddball smiled before kissing him on the face cheek dog style before going to sleep. Budderball blushed slightly as he smiled back to her and went to get some sleep himself. \"Sleep tight, Oddball.\" \"You too.\" Oddball smiled back as she fell asleep. Patch and Colette smiled, happy that Oddball and Budderball were experiencing love. \"Isn't it adorable?\" Colette whispered. \"Like when I first met you.\" Patch replied quietly. \"Aw.\" Colette smiled. Patch smiled bashfully to her. \"You warm enough?\" \"I get warmer every time I see you.\" Colette admitted bashfully. Patch smiled as he got closer to Colette to make sure she was warm enough. Colette nuzzled against the dalmatian and he happily nuzzled her back. The next day, Shasta was going to be given some great news.[Chapter 10] A human adult man who must've been Adam's father came into the shed to turn the light out. B-Dawg slightly whimpered to that. The man thought he heard something, then came inside the shed with the light on to explore. \"Time to use the secret weapon, sorry about this, Oddball.\" Patch whispered before crawling over to Budderball before gently pulling Budderball's front paw. The human male grunted and groaned in disgust and ran out from the unpleasant smell. Luckily Budderball had covered Oddball's nose. \"Nasty!\" the man grunted as he turned out the light and shut the shed door behind him. \"I see why they hate it when your paw gets pulled.\" Oddball commented to Budderball as she still wore his jersey. \"Don't worry, you won't have to smell it, I've got your nose covered.\" Budderball said. Colette smirked slightly to Rosebud, her eyes seemed to light up whenever Shasta was involved. \"Looks like you'll be our leader.\" Patch said to Shasta. \"Me?\" Shasta felt flattered and honored. \"Yes, besides, wasn't your father the leader of his own sled dog team too?\" Patch asked. \"That's a good point...\" Shasta smiled softly. \"Plus, I know all the commands to coach the Buddies in the race.\" \"Not just them, but me as well.\" Oddball said. \"You wanna be in the race too, huh?\" Shasta asked her. \"Yes, please,\" Oddball replied, looking rather motivated. \"I wanna be one of a kind just like my Uncle Patch!\" \"Well, okay,\" Shasta smiled. \"I'd ask your uncle and his mate to join, but...\" \"But what?\" Oddball tilted her head. \"The only way for them to be on our sled team is if they were the same size as us, so then they wouldn't be too fast for us or to heavy in case we went up any slopes.\" Shasta said. \"Too old?\" Oddball asked. \"I'm sorry, Oddball, but puppies only, no offense.\" Shasta replied gently, hoping she wouldn't get mad about him excluding the girl pup's uncle and his girlfriend. \"Aww!\" Oddball pouted. \"I'm sorry, Oddball, but it's for the best...\" Shasta replied. \"You understand, right?\" \"I guess...\" Oddball felt bad for her favorite uncle and his girlfriend to be excluded. \"Well, maybe with some magic they can.\" Rosebud said. \"Magic?\" Shasta looked back to the golden puppy as though he never heard of such a thing. Patch then remembered his familiar magic and then used his own magic to turn himself and Colette into puppies. \"Uncle Patch!\" Oddball's eyes widened in surprise. Patch and Colette smiled to each other, and luckily, their collars shrunk down in size with them. \"That'll work.\" Shasta smiled. \"You guys look different as puppies...\" Oddball came up to the former teenage dogs. \"Wait until you're our age,\" Colette giggled. \"I'm sure by then you'll be covered in spots.\" \"Yeah and you'll be sounding different soon enough.\" Patch said. \"How do I sound different?\" Oddball sounded confused. \"Oh, you'll find out.\" Patch replied. Oddball looked very curious and confused. After a while of outdoor training, Shasta took the others to the shed to go over his plan for them in the race. \"Alright, so who goes where, Shasta?\" Patch asked. Shasta started to organize them all. \"Biggest and strongest dogs go next to the sled, in the back,\" he instructed/informed. \"That's Budderball and Patch.\" \"What exactly do you mean by biggest?\" Budderball took offense to that. \"Just get into position.\" Patch said. \"Yeah, chillax, dude.\" MudBud added in. Patch and Budderball then took their places in front of the dog sled as they were positioning in the shed. \"The fastest will go in the middle,\" Shasta then instructed. \"That's B-Dawg and Buddha.\" \"You heard him, guys.\" Oddball said. \"You got that right, S,\" B-Dawg said before going with his spiritual brother. \"I am the handsomest and the fastest and the bravest.\" \"Just get into position.\" Oddball groaned out of annoyance. \"Sheesh, someone's impatient.\" B-Dawg muttered as he got into position. \"Rosebud will be the navigator up front with me, and if anything happens, Colette and Oddball will take her place.\" Shasta instructed. \"'Cuz girls aren't afraid to ask for directions~\" Rosebud replied rather dreamily. \"So then, we'll be on the sled.\" Colette said. \"In case of emergency, you'll be our back-up.\" Shasta nodded. \"And remember, be as one dog, in harmony.\" Talon's voice advised the young dogs. \"In harmony.\" Oddball mimicked. \"Be nice.\" Patch smirked as he overheard that. \"Okay, okay.\" Oddball pouted playfully. Patch ruffled up the top of his niece's head which made her laugh. Shasta then practiced running with the puppies through the snow as Talon watched to see what they all had learned. And where it was looking great. Budderball was slow at first, but soon, he had improved a lot since he had run before. And where soon enough it started to turn to night. Cherry, Atticus, and Mo yelped as they were sliding down a snowy hill and it opened up and they all ended up on top of each other. \"You three, okay?\" Buddy and Molly asked. \"Sure... Why not...?\" Cherry crawled out from underneath Atticus and Mo. Atticus and Mo then got up, dusting each other off. Cherry stood up and cracked her back. \"Ugh...\" Atticus soon used his magic to make Cherry's back feel better. Cherry looked back at Atticus and Mo. \"Are you guys all right?\" \"Just fine.\" Atticus and Mo huffed at each other, still fighting. \"Guys...\" Cherry sighed to the couple which were her best friend and new close friend. \"How long are they going to be like this?\" Molly asked. \"I don't know, I haven't seen them like this before.\" Cherry replied. \"Well, let's hope it doesn't stay that way for long.\" Buddy said. \"We can only hope.\" Cherry agreed. \"We better get going to find Patch, Colette, Oddball, and the Buddies.\" Atticus said. \"Who put YOU in charge?\" Mo glared. \"It's a good idea!\" Atticus glared back. \"STOP TELLING ME WHAT TO DO, HOUSEBOY!\" Mo yelled. \"You better keep your mouth shut before I use magic to shut it yourself!\" Atticus glared back. \"Make me!\" Mo grabbed him by his collar. \"Book Nerd with a side of pocket!\" she then punched him in the face which didn't do that much damage, but it showed that she was as dangerous as she said she was. Atticus threw her back. \"Cherry, please make them stop.\" Molly begged. \"I don't know how to...\" Cherry felt disturbed by Atticus and Mo arguing and fighting with each other, both physically and verbally. \"Have you tried yell at them to stop?\" Buddy asked. \"Guys, quit it!\" Cherry walked over to the bickering couple. \"You guys have been through so much together!\" Suddenly, Cherry was grabbed into the fight and was thrown out and crashed into a tree and slid down. \"Look at what you made me do!\" Atticus glared to Mo. \"You made me hurt my best friend.\" \"Aw, shut up, you know-it-all!\" Mo glared back. \" STOP! \"Cherry yelled. And where this caused Atticus and Mo to stop their fighting. \"What is wrong with you guys?!\" Cherry came back, limping slightly from the painful impact she had just met with. \"I just don't understand why Atticus doesn't just keep Drell from torturing you entirely and make sure that you don't get hurt or tortured by him.\" Mo said. \"Because Drell is an idiot!\" Cherry outraged. \"He's a big fat bully who doesn't know what he's doing and is a pain that needs to die! I don't even know how he even became Head of the Witches Council, he's nothing but an egocentric, sadistic, slimy, horrible, ballistic monster who needs to be put out of MY misery, because I'm sick of being HIS SCAPEGOAT! Everything is my fault with him AND I NEVER CATCH A BREAK FROM HIM BECAUSE HE GETS LAUGHS OUT OF MY PAIN AND HUMILIATION! \" Atticus frowned as he now knew that Drell was causing more pain to his best friend, then he thought so he decided that he would make sure that Drell would pay for what the strong warlock's done to Cherry. \"Now, you make up!\" Cherry told them. \"Uh, Cherry...?\" Mo spoke up. \" MAKE UP OR I WILL MAKE YOU !\" Cherry sounded very angry right now. \"Okay, okay.\" Atticus and Mo said. \"Good.\" Cherry nodded firmly. \"Wow, Cherry, I've never seen you this angry...\" Atticus was scared of her for once. \"He's going to LOVE ME ! \" Cherry roared which made her eyes turn fiery red and her fangs from Forte seemed to pop out to highlight her rage. \"You two better start making up.\" Buddy said. Atticus and Mo both sighed, knowing that they would have to get this out of the way. Cherry breathed heavily and angrily as she looked like she had literally exploded all over the bickering couple. Atticus and Mo muttered apologies to each other. \"Now hug.\" Cherry demanded. \"The two then hugged each other. \"Now say you're 'Buttzillas'.\" Cherry narrowed her eyes. \"Cherry...\" Atticus replied. \" SAY IT! \" Cherry roared. \"Okay... I'm a Buttzilla...\" Atticus said. Cherry smirked and then snickered which then made Mo, Molly, and Buddy laugh. \"Wait, no, hey!\" Atticus glared. \"Mo, say you're a Buttzilla!\" \"Okay, fine... I'm a Buttzilla.\" Mo sighed. Cherry kept laughing. \"You think this is funny?\" Mo glared at her. \"I'm sorry, I just had to get some entertainment out of this.\" Cherry calmed down. \"Hmm...\" Atticus and Mo hummed. \"The point is, you guys shouldn't be fighting over me, you're a couple, you're supposed to fight over stupid stuff like forgetting a birthday, anniversary, or Valentine's Day.\" Cherry said. Atticus and Mo sighed as they knew that Cherry was right. \"Now please no fighting, it's annoying and painful for everybody.\" Cherry folded her arms. \"We promise.\" Atticus and Mo promised. \"Good,\" Cherry firmly nodded, then grunted in pain. \"Gah, stupid fangs!\" \"That's why you need to always stay calm, so then you don't bring out your fangs.\" Atticus said. \"I hate being a vampire...\" Cherry groaned. \"It must have some advantages.\" Atticus said. \"Whatever, let's just move on...\" Cherry scoffed. \"Agreed.\" Molly said. \"Now to find the others before it's too late.\" Buddy said. \"Gosh, Dad, why did you fight with Mom like that?\" Vincent asked Atticus. \"Like what?\" Atticus asked as he came by to throw away some of the trash he had. \"You know what I mean.\" Vincent said. \"What?\" Atticus asked. \"Remember that argument you and Mo had when you guys, Cherry, Buddy, and Molly were coming to get us?\" Patch prompted. \"Oh, right...\" Atticus frowned. \"What were you guys fighting about anyway, Mr. Fudo?\" Eliza asked. \"Yeah, what were you two fighting about, Dad?\" Akito asked. Atticus scratched his head. \"I don't remember...\" \"Why don't we continue on with the story?\" Estelle asked. \"How far along are you?\" Atticus asked curiously. \"We're getting to the part where Shasta taught us how to race.\" Patch replied. \"Ohh, right.\" Atticus said. \"So, after that, we decided to get some rest after well-done practice.\" Patch smiled. \"Did everyone sleep alright?\" Scruffy asked. \"It was a big day, so yeah, we did, especially your cousin.\" Patch smiled. \"Not everyone, there was one pup that was scared.\" Colette said. \"Was it one of the Buddies?\" Dot guessed. \"Yep.\" Patch nodded. \"Let me guess, Budderball regretted not eating?\" Estelle asked. \"Incorrect.\" Colette said. \"Uhh... B-Dawg?\" Dot tried. \"Yep.\" Patch nodded. \"Wow, really?\" Dot laughed. \"Um, what was wrong?\" \"Yeah.\" Scruffy said. \"Well...\" Patch and Colette started. The puppies were asleep in the shed for another night unbeknowst to Shasta's human family. Patch and Colette and Rosebud soon noticed B-Dawg still up.[Chapter 11] Colette yawned and looked to the golden retriever puppy with a silver chain. \"B-Dawg?\" \"What are you doing up?\" Patch asked \"Oh, no reason.\" B-Dawg replied. \"B-Dawg...?\" Patch gave the puppy a long look. \"You can tell us.\" Colette said. \"It's nothing...\" B-Dawg backed away. \"You can tell us anything, B-Dawg.\" Colette said. B-Dawg looked away. \"B-Dawg...\" Rosebud came to her brother. \"Please...\" B-Dawg sighed, knowing that the sooner he told them, the sooner he would be okay. \"Okay, I'll tell you...\" Patch, Colette, and Rosebud then sat back, anxious to hear about his little dilemma. \"I-I'm scared.\" B-Dawg said. \"Of what?\" Patch asked softly. \"Yeah.\" Colette added. \"Everything...\" B-Dawg admitted. \"I just feel worried... What if we never go back home?\" \"Yes, we will.\" Patch assured him. \"I just don't like this...\" B-Dawg admitted. \"We'll be back home soon.\" Patch said. \"I wanna go now...\" B-Dawg said. \"We will, it's going to be okay, B-Dawg.\" Colette comforted him the best that she could as a surrogate mother. Patch joined in and began to comfort B-Dawg as well the best he could. \"I just... I just... I'm not that brave...\" B-Dawg admitted. \"B-Dawg, believe it or not, I'm scared too.\" Patch said. \"You are...?\" B-Dawg asked, surprised that Patch could be scared of anything. \"Yes.\" Patch nodded. \"No way...\" B-Dawg replied. \"B-Dawg, we're all scared of something,\" Patch replied. \"Even grown-up dogs.\" \"But sometimes, we have to face our fears.\" Colette said. \"I don't know if I could...\" B-Dawg wasn't so sure. \"Sure you can, it's like acting.\" Patch said. B-Dawg looked over. \"Just pretend you're like a superdog who's not afraid of anything and your brothers and sister need you.\" Colette coached. \"Yeah.\" Patch agreed. \"Okay.\" B-Dawg said. \"It's okay to be scared, but you need to be brave.\" Colette said. \"How do I pretend I'm not scared?\" B-Dawg asked. \"Try to think of something that makes you feel brave.\" Patch coached. B-Dawg tried to think. \"Think... Like Thunderbolt.\" Patch suggested, knowing how much he admired the dog when he was a much smaller pup. B-Dawg began to think about the heroic dog Patch mentioned. \"You remember Thunderbolt, don't you?\" Patch prompted. \"Yeah, a little.\" B-Dawg smiled as he felt motivation. \"That's good.\" Colette smiled. \"You can do it!\" Patch smiled as well. \"I can do it...\" B-Dawg smiled in determination. \"That's the B-Dawg we know and love.\" Colette said. B-Dawg smiled, then started to yawn. \"Get some rest, Super Pup,\" Patch replied to that. \"We'll need our energy tomorrow.\" \"Yeah.\" Rosebud nodded. B-Dawg yawned and stretched, feeling instantly sleepy, then went right to bed, telling himself to be brave. \"Um, Colette, can we talk?\" Rosebud asked the cocker spaniel shyly. \"Of course, dear.\" Colette said. \"Alone?\" Rosebud asked. Patch got the message and decided to sleep next to Oddball and Budderball. Colette smiled to him, then looked to the female puppy. \"What is it, Rosebud?\" \"Um... How do you know if you're in love or not?\" Rosebud asked. \"That's easy, when you feel like you met your soulmate or your one true love, it makes you feel like it's just the two of you in the whole world and your heart starts pounding at five miles an hour.\" Colette smiled. Rosebud smiled back, that was such a beautiful description and personally accurate to her feelings. \"Why do you ask?\" Colette replied, though she had a very good idea why. \"Well, because, I-I think I'm in love with Shasta.\" Rosebud smiled. \"Shasta?\" Colette asked. \"Uh, yeah...\" Rosebud seemed to blush underneath her fur. \"he's just so bold, adventurous... He's an amazing guy.\" \"You remind me of myself when I was your age.\" Colette smiled. \"When you met Patch?\" Rosebud smiled back. \"Yep.\" Colette nodded. Rosebud smiled. \"How did you know he was the one?\" \"Like I told you before,\" Colette reminded her. \"I felt that when I met Patch... That's such a wonderful day I shan't ever forget and hope to never do so...\" she then sighed dreamily as she looked to the sleeping dalmatian. \"Well, I hope me and Shasta get to be a couple.\" Rosebud said. \"I'm sure you both will,\" Colette supported with a smirk. \"You two seem rather close from what I've gathered since we first met him.\" \"Well, what can I say? I really like him.\" Rosebud said. Colette giggled. \"What if he doesn't like me back?\" Rosebud then pouted. \"How could he not?\" Colette asked. Unknown to either of them, Shasta was overhearing their conversation after he had came out for some reason. \"I dunno...\" Rosebud shrugged. \"What if I'm not good enough?\" \"Ah, Rosebud, I'm sure he likes you,\" Colette encouraged. \"And even if he doesn't, you can always be friends, I doubt that's the case though, he put you in charge of navigation.\" she then reminded. \"True,\" Rosebud said. \"But I just want him to know my feelings for him, like to my eyes, he's a strong heroic leader.\" \"That's how I felt about Patch.\" Colette really related to that. \"Um... How do I let him know though?\" Rosebud asked. \"Tell him your feelings towards him.\" Colette said. \"How...?\" Rosebud asked. \"Well, if I were him, what would you tell what you like most about me?\" Colette prompted. \"Well, if you were Shasta, I would tell you that I love you and that I think you are the most bravest pup I've ever met and you are also a great leader, I can already tell because I can tell by the determination you have in your eyes and that I hope you can accept my love and I hope that you me as well, Shasta.\" Rosebud said. Shasta smiled as he overheard that. \"Do you think he'd like that, Colette?\" Rosebud asked. \"Why don't you ask him yourself?\" Colette smiled. \"Huh?\" Rosebud asked. 'What do you mean?\" Colette pointed her paw over. Rosebud turned around and saw that Shasta was right behind her the whole time. \"Oh, Sh-Shasta, h-how long have you been there?\" she then asked. \"Oh, long enough...\" Shasta smiled bashfully in return. \"Uh, Rosebud, did you really mean what you just said?\" \"Of course I did, I meant every word.\" Rosebud said. Shasta smiled. \"Seriously?\" \"Shasta.\" Rosebud tried to stop him from doing that again. \"Sorry...\" Shasta replied bashfully. \"I-I was hoping you'd feel the same way...\" \"Y-You did?\" Rosebud asked surprised with a smile. \"Mm-hmm...\" Shasta smiled back. Rosebud came closer to him with a smile. \"I'll leave you two alone.\" Colette smiled before going over to her sleeping soulmate. Rosebud and Shasta looked over sheepishly to her, but then smiled to each other. Colette yawned as she then fell asleep next to Patch. Shasta and Rosebud were then about to kiss. \"Do we have to hear this part?\" Scruffy interrupted once again. His mouth was soon covered by Dot as she wanted to hear what happened. Scruffy muffled and glared. Dot glared back, then looked to her parents with a smile. \"Please continue.\" \"Right, now, where was I, oh, yes, the kissing scene.\" Colette said before continuing the story. Scruffy looked absolutely disgusted while Dot and even Show White smiled to this fact. Shasta and Rosebud now were about to kiss. Colette smiled as she fell asleep next to Patch. \"Shasta! Where are you, boy?!\" A boy's voice called out. \"Um, I gotta go...\" Shasta said. \"Oh, okay...\" Rosebud replied softly. \"Go to your human.\" \"I'll be back tomorrow morning, good night.\" Shasta said to her as he then quickly left to meet with his boy. Rosebud sighed as did Shasta as he had to leave his soulmate. Shasta barked as he went out to see Adam. Rosebud then decided to just get some sleep for the night. The next day, Shasta was going to have a surprise for Adam. Cherry, Atticus, Mo, Buddy, Molly, Scamp, Danielle, and Annette were exploring all over to find who they were looking for. Drell came over which made them all glare to him since they excluded him at first. \"Hello...\" \"I got a bone to pick with you!\" Cherry glared at the warlock. \"Now, Cherry...\" Drell started, not taking her anger seriously at first. \"Listen...\" \"No you listen, you pig!\" Cherry glared sharper. \"What did you call me?!\" Drell glared. \"P-I-G.\" Cherry spelt it out for him. \"Why, you little-\" Drell reached out for her. Cherry smirked, then turned and gasped as Atticus was farther away, too busy trying to make up with Mo to do anything, then smiled nervously back to the warlock. \"I am so sorry, I think I'm tired...\" \"Oh, no, you don't, you little-\" Drell glared. \" ATTICUS, HELP! \" Cherry yelled out. Drell grabbed her and pulled her into a sleeper hold, putting his hand over her mouth to shut her up. \"Mo, I'm really sorry about the fight we had,\" Atticus said to Mo. \"I don't know what came over me.\" \"That's okay, it was probably my fault.\" Mo replied. \"Atticus!\" Cherry muffled. Atticus and Mo both felt like Cherry was in one of her situations with Drell. \"Uh, I better go and uhh...\" Atticus said. \"Go ahead.\" Mo allowed, knowing that he had to do what he had planned to do. Drell patted his hands together as Cherry was trapped in a snow lump. \"What did you do to her?!\" Atticus asked. \"Nuthin'...\" Drell smirked, then pushed down the large snow ball down the hill. Cherry yelled out as she rolled down the hill, hit the tree, and looked painfully dizzy. Atticus glared at Drell before starting to do some pain to the strong warlock, wanting him to pay for everything he ever did to Cherry. Cherry crawled across the snow. Drell then slid down and crashed into her in the tree. \"You did that on purpose!\" Cherry wailed. \"I am so sick of being your scapegoat!\" \"Mommy, I see stars.\" Drell said dizzy. He then shook his head and came back to normal and put his glasses back in place. Cherry roared and tackled him down. \"I AM SICK OF YOU!\" \"I am going to make your life a whole lot more...\" Drell glared before seeing Atticus give him the threat look. Cherry growled and actually started to fight the warlock. Atticus was sliding down and looked surprised. \"You never let me have any fun!\" Cherry whacked Drell with a tree limb which broke it, but she didn't care. \"PAIN! PAIN! PAIN! All you do is glorify Atticus and make a MONKEY OUT OF ME! \" Drell then used his magic on Cherry, not caring what the result would be. Atticus reached in and pulled them both up by their collars. \"What's going on here?\" \"I'm burning him, Atticus, I don't care what happens!\" Cherry reached for Drell. \"I wanna rip out his spine and use it as a back-scratcher!\" Drell then fired a spell at Cherry, not caring what it would do to her, he just wanted her to stop. Cherry turned into a mouse and landed in the snow. She then looked up nervously and tried to hide. Drell grabbed Cherry and picked her up by her tail while licking his lips. \"Drell, don't!\" Atticus said. \"She's my best friend!\" \"I'm sorry, Atticus, but her time has come and she is now my meal.\" Drell said, then dropped Cherry into his mouth and gulped her down. Atticus instantly punched Drell in the stomach, causing him to burp Cherry out. Drell held his stomach in pain. Cherry fell flat onto a rock and slid down. \"Owch...\" Atticus soon used his magic and changed Cherry back to her normal self. Cherry shook her head, then glared to Drell, about to attack him again. \"Don't even think about it.\" Drell glared out of pain. \"Make me!\" Cherry growled and lunged out for the warlock. Drell glared before using his magic to blast the perky goth away. Cherry yelped out and ended up in another snow lump. \"Drell!\" Atticus scolded. \"Do what you want to me, I'm sick of her!\" Drell glared at Atticus. \"Yes!\" Cherry cheered. Drell glanced at Cherry, then back to Atticus. \"Aunt Cherry got crazy from Drell, huh?\" Akito asked. \"Yes, and I believe this was the adventure where she finally stood up to him.\" Patch said. \"It was either that or when your father became a werepony at the Monster Road Rally... It's hard to say, I wasn't there for whenever it happened, but I was surprised when your dad told me about it.\" \"Anyways, Dad, did you teach Drell a lesson and you know.\" Vincent said, pounding his right fist into the palm of his left hand. \"Yeah, but of course, that didn't keep him down for long, though I could've sworn I saw a black eye when we all reunited.\" Patch said.[Chapter 12] And where Patch was right as Atticus began to fight Drell with his bare fists. Mo was sitting on a log and filing her nails with her legs crossed as her boyfriend fought the warlock. Cherry began to enjoy this fight and when it was all over Drell was left with a black eye. \"Okay, now can we get back on track?\" Atticus folded his arms. \"Sure, why not?\" Drell mumbled as he had a cold press on his eye. \"I agree with Atticus.\" Scamp said. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah...\" Drell replied. \"Away we go.\" \"At least you didn't get hit with a hockey puck to the eye, that really hurts.\" Mo said to the warlock. \"Yeah.\" Angel said. \"Like you'd know?\" Drell asked. \"Trust me, I know.\" Mo folded her arms. \"And how do you know?\" Drell asked. \"When you live on the streets for as long as I have, you see a lot and take a lot...\" Mo replied, then rolled up her sleeve to show hidden cuts and scars that she hid from the others, then pointed each of them out. \"That's from my strict grandmother for accidentally breaking her vase... That one came from her dog when I took one of her puppies without permission...\" she thn pointed to her left eye. \"This is from when we were walking one day and saw a little league game playing softball and they hit the ball so hard that it hit me right in my cornea.\" \"Wow.\" Drell said. \"Too bad we didn't have anyone to patch you up.\" Angel frowned to her owner. \"I know, girl, it's okay...\" Mo hugged her teenage puppy back as they recalled their times before they met Atticus and Scamp. \"Anyway, let's get going.\" Drell said. Buddy and Molly tried to sniff their puppies' tracks. Angel, Scamp, Annette, and Danielle started to join in. \"Got them?\" Danielle asked. \"Hard to say,\" Buddy replied. \"This snow seems to be blocking their scent.\" \"I can't seem to catch Colette's scent either.\" Scamp said. \"Oh, it's the snow,\" Angel grunted. \"It covers up everything!\" \"Now, what do we do?\" Danielle asked. \"There's gotta be someway outta this...\" Cherry said. \"But how?! HOW?!\" \"Easy, we go forward.\" Atticus said. \"Forward?\" Mo asked. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yep, towards town, I hope.\" Atticus said. \"Might as well...\" Drell shrugged. \"Move forward!\" Atticus proclaimed as they decided to move forward. Meanwhile, back with Patch and the others... Patch woke up first, he yawned and stretched and smacked his lips. \"Mm... Thirsty...\" he said raspily as he then walked out from his hiding place and looked for a saucer of water. And where he looked over close by Shasta's owner's family house and where he decided to listen in to any conversations the family might be having. Patch put his ear up so he could listen in on what was going on with Shasta's human family. Shasta was on one of the stairs to listen into Adam's and his father's conversation. \"So, what did they talk about?\" Scruffy asked. \"Hm... I don't remember...\" Patch pouted. \"Didn't it have something to do with an accident?\" Colette asked. \"I'm sorry, guys, but I don't think I remember what happened...\" Patch said to the others. \"Well, it was a long time ago.\" Colette comforted. \"I also think it was actually Christmas, not summer...\" \" CAN WE PLEASE CONTINUE ON WITH THE STORY?! \" Snow white yelled. The others then looked at the white kitten. \"Heh... Sorry...\" Snow White smiled sheepishly. \"How's about I get to the part where Shasta lured Adam into the shed?\" Patch suggested. \"Was that when Adam found out that you all were there?\" Vincent asked. \"Yes.\" Patch said as he continued the story. The others then listened to what happened next. Patch overheard the humans talking about an accident from where he was sitting in the shed with his love, niece, and the Buddies. And where it sounded like Adam's father didn't approve of him sledding again. \"Oh, my...\" Patch frowned quietly as he overheard this. After Adam's father left Shasta found this the perfect time to bring Adam to the shed the only way he could think of by taking Adam's bag which had the book he found in the shed back to where the boy found it. Back in Fernfield, the kids were miserably lost without their Buddies around. Jessica knew she was going to get married soon, but she felt empty without Oddball around since they had become natural best friends since the puppy's adoption. \"Oh, Oddball, where could you be?\" she frowned. \"Oh, Jessie, I'm sure she's fine...\" Christopher tried to soothe his future wife. \"I know,\" Jessica frowned. \"I just miss her.\" Christopher hugged Jessica. Jessica sniffled as she started to cry since Oddball was gone and she had no idea where her puppy was.[Chapter 13] Meanwhile, back with Patch and the others as Adam followed Shasta into the shed... \"Hey!\" Adam chased after Shasta as he had one of his human's book in his mouth. Shasta dropped the book in the middle of the floor as Adam came through the door to see his puppy. \"What is it, boy?\" Adam asked. Shasta grabbed onto the tarp with his mouth and pulled it down to show his human the sled. \"You know Dad won't let us sled, besides, we don't even have a team.\" Adam said to his puppy. Shasta turned over. \"Now, guys!\" he yipped to his hiding friends. \"You heard him.\" Patch whispered. With that, the puppies flooded out to meet the boy, one-by-one. \"Whoa, Buddha?\" Adam checked out the first golden puppy. \"As in, the Zen Master?\" Rosebud came next, followed by Budderball, B-Dawg, and MudBud. Shasta then summoned for Patch, Colette, and Oddball. \"Hi.\" Patch smiled. Adam did a double take. \"Did you just talk?... I must be dreaming...\" \"Nope, you're not dreaming, Adam.\" Patch smiled. \"Wow...\" Adam replied. \"You can thank Puppy Power.\" Patch then looked to the others to see they were positioned like how Shasta wanted them to. \"I've been studying for this,\" Adam grew excited. \"We'll need some equipment, we can do this!\" \"But where can we get the equipment?\" Patch asked. \"I know where we can find some.\" Adam replied as he stood up. \"Great.\" Patch smiled. Adam then went to get the equipment to get the dogs ready for their first ever race. 'This is so exciting.' Oddball thought to herself. Once Adam came back with the equipment, he had the dogs ready. \"Don't worry about us though, Adam,\" Patch said since there were more than six of them. \"If anything happens, I, Colette, or Oddball will step in to help.\" \"Why do they call you Oddball?\" Adam wondered about Patch's niece's name. \"Well, you see...\" Oddball said before starting to tell him her story due to the help of Puppy Power. She went on about how when after she was born, she was born without spots and she was a little stranger between her siblings: Little Dipper and Domino. And where she even tried to use ink from a piece of paper on a copy machine to make it look like she had gotten her spots. Adam laughed at some parts and was surprised at what he was hearing. \"Sounds like you've been through a lot, Oddball.\" \"Well, not as much as Uncle Patch, but yeah,\" Oddball smiled. \"He taught me that I should be one of a kind like when he was a puppy and met Thunderbolt.\" \"Cool.\" Adam smiled. He then frowned. \"What's wrong, Adam?\" Colette asked. \"It's too big,\" Adam said about the attachment around Shasta's body since he was just a puppy. \"Guess I should measure you guys first before I make some new ones.\" \"You sew?\" Patch asked, curiously. \"Yeah, I love sewing.\" Adam admitted proudly. \"Wow, and at such a young age.\" Patch smiled. \"Well, I'm pretty impressive myself.\" Adam smiled modestly, then measured the puppies and started to make them new reigns for their sled. 'Impressive.' Colette thought to herself. Adam then put everybody in their reigns once he was done, then looked to Patch, Colette, and Oddball. \"You guys too or just Shasta and the Buddies?\" \"Us too, please.\" Oddball smiled. \"Okay, step right up.\" Adam smiled back. \"Ladies first.\" Patch told his girlfriend and niece. Colette and Oddball both smiled as they went up to Adam. Patch smiled back to them. Adam then took their measurements and went to work on the next ones. 'Feels like I'm a fashion model.' Oddball thought to herself. She even did some poses. \"Okay, Rarity Junior.\" Patch chuckled playfully to his niece. \"I couldn't resist.\" Oddball giggled. Adam then put the other three dogs into their reigns and had them ready for the race as well. \"Now, let's see how strong you all are.\" he then said as he took them outside, putting on his coat and hat. \"You'll be surprised with how strong we are.\" Patch smiled. \"Or at least be surprised with how strong one of us is.\" Oddball said. Adam strapped logs, but not way too heavy, but heavy enough for the puppies and called mushing commands to them to test them out for the upcoming dog sled race to bring them all home. Patch seemed to go with a log heavier for him. Adam commanded and cheered for them as they were improving real well. \"I hope I'm gonna be as strong as Patch!\" Budderball cheered for himself. \"Maybe someday, you will!\" Patch called out to him. Talon watched the puppies from a top the trees and looked very proud of all of their progress since Shasta's educated them. Adam then tested the puppies by holding them on an extended leash that would be like the dog sled's ropes where they would hook up to. And where after a few tugs, Patch, Colette, Oddball, Shasta, and the Buddies all then gave one last pull and where it overpowered the boy. \"Whoa!\" Adam hollered and laughed as he was sliding in the snow now from their pulls. They were now walking through town. Rosebud stopped however and looked into the toy store window and saw a stuffed dog toy that had cute boots and a winter cap on which caught her eye. \"You want that, girl?\" Adam asked her. \"Yes, please!\" Rosebud yipped up happily. Adam could have sworn he heard Rosebud talk, but that didn't stop him from buying her the winter cap. They walked in, took the pink winter cap, and paid for it. Rosebud then smiled as she had a new hat and caught up with the others. 'This is so much fun.' Oddball thought to herself with a smile. Adam then decided to throw snowballs as a way to play catch with the puppies, having a lot of fun with them. And where two of his snowballs hit Patch and Budderball. Patch and Budderball shivered, but then laughed as they had so much fun with this. \"This one's for you, B-Dawg!\" Adam called before throwing a ball to the 'coolest Buddy'. And where it hit him in the face, not hurting the pup, but still made him look silly. This made the others laughed. \"Oh, I ain't playing, but it is on !\" B-Dawg shivered slightly as he challenged. And where all the pups started ambush Adam. Adam yelled out, but laughed as the puppies were tackling him, but all playful of course. And where they soon did some training with the sled. Adam still gave them commands and the puppies had gratefully improved since they first started. And where the sight of them pulling a sled surprised a familiar dog sled team. \"Adam sounds like me when we first met Balto.\" Akito smiled in inspiration. \"Indeed he was.\" Patch smiled. \"I'm so proud of you.\" Akito pet the older Dalmatian. \"Someday, I'm gonna be just like you.\" Scruffy smiled up to his dad. \"I'm certain about that too, son.\" Patch smiled. \"So, you guys used Adam's dad's sled?\" Eliza asked. \"Yeah, it was a little too heavy for Adam at first though.\" Patch replied. \"What do you mean?\" Estelle asked. \"Well, the sled was for Adam's dad, but he's not as strong as Akito or your dad.\" Patch explained. \"So, what did you do about it then?\" Eliza asked. \"Adam started to build his own sled with our help.\" Patch smiled. \"Of course we had to wear welding masks for when it came to welding it.\" Colette said. \"Yeah, but we mostly handed whatever Adam would need.\" Patch smiled. \"So, you were like his little helpers.\" Vincent said. \"You could say that.\" Patch smiled in agreement. \"I wish we could've met Adam,\" Estelle sighed. \"He sounds like a very wonderful boy.\" \"Oh, trust me, he was.\" Patch smiled. Adam did some more sewing and soon finished up the sled and it was all ready for the upcoming race. \"Impressive.\" Patch smiled. \"We'll try it tomorrow.\" Adam smiled to his canine friends. \"Perfect.\" Patch smiled.[Chapter 14] The next day... Adam was all bundled up and had the puppies ready to test out the dog sled. Talon came out and decided to watch the group. \"Alright, we're ready.\" Patch said. \"Alright, guys, let's try it out, let's go!\" Adam commanded the dogs. \"Come on, Mush!\" The puppies hooked up to the sled then moved with him to do a test run with their brand new sled. \"And away we go!\" Colette called out. Adam laughed and cheered as he enjoyed this as much as the puppies did. During their test run, a certain dog sled team saw fadst they were going. \"And nine puppies become one,\" Talon smiled. \"Their work here is almost done.\" \"Sacre bleu!\" Francois yelped. \"Did you see that?!\" \"Oh, uh, I was busy watching the puppy sled team.\" Felipe replied stupidly. \"You idiot, I was talking about the puppy sled team!\" Francois glared. \"They were moving pretty fast.\" \"Come on!\" Adam cheered for his team as they took him across the snowy slopes with ease. \"Wahoo!\" Colette smiled. \"We were a pretty good team,\" Patch narrated. \"But we knew we couldn't stay long. We could never forget about the ones who we were separated from back home where our hearts were.\" \"So, the next night was it the same or did something tragic happen?\" Scruffy asked. \"Well, Adam still wanted to be in the race, but his father still refused.\" Patch sighed softly. \"That's not fair!\" Snow White pouted. \"Why should Adam be excluded when he wasn't even in that accident?!\" \"Yeah!\" Dot added. \"I know, but it was just his rules...\" Patch sighed himself. \"You should've bit him, Dad.\" Scruffy grinned darkly. \"Scruffy!?\" Colette gasped. \"Sorry, Mom.\" Scruffy smiled nervously then. \"Anyway, continue\" Snow White said. \"So, that night, Adam broke open his piggy bank...\" Patch began back onto the story. Adam then just did that with a hammer and shared a knowing look with Shasta. Meanwhile... Cherry and Drell started to poke each other and looked like immature siblings fighting each other now. \"Stop fighting each other or else I'll make you both stop!\" Atticus glared. \"He started it!\" Cherry growled. \"No, you did!\" Drell growled back. \" WE WILL TURN OURSELVES AROUND! \" Mo threatened like a hostile mother. \"How does that makes any sense?\" Cherry and Drell asked. \"Don't judge me...\" Mo glowered. Cherry and Drell kept walking. Drell put his finger in his mouth and snuck his finger into Cherry's ear. \"Boop.\" \" THAT'S IT! \" Cherry yelled and tackled him onto the ground and started to beat him up. \"Cherry, stop.\" Drell said. \"Why, cuz it hurts?\" Cherry scoffed. \"No, it tickles.\" Drell smirked. \"Tickles?! How is me beating you up not hurting you?!\" Cherry glared. \"I guess you're just too wussy.\" Drell smirked. Cherry growled and tackled him. \"Get out of my face, I'm claustrophobic!\" \"Is that so?\" Drell grinned darkly. \"Uh-oh...\" Cherry's eyes widened. \"That's it!\" Atticus glared before dragging Drell away from Cherry. Cherry stood up and straightened herself out. \"Jerk...\" Drell began to wince in pain from Atticus's grip. \"Now, I know you don't like each other, but if you wanna stay, you two are gonna learn how to get along.\" Atticus glared to the warlock. \"Yes, sir...\" Drell struggled. \"Serves you right.\" Cherry mocked Drell. 'And Cherry, I don't want you teasing him either.\" Atticus then looked to his best friend. \"Huh?\" Cherry asked in surprise. \"You heard me.\" Atticus said firmly. \"What did I do?!\" Cherry asked. \"Cherry, this is just as your fault as it is Drell's!\" Mo scolded the perky goth. \"I know he picks on you and tortures you all the time, but you keep testing his patience to make him act up!\" \"It's true.\" Drell said. \"You're blaming me too?\" Cherry sounded like she felt bad. \"It's your fault just as much as it is Drell's,\" Mo said. \"You're lucky that Atticus doesn't send you guys to a desert island and doesn't let you guys stay there until you learn how to get along with each other.\" \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. Cherry and Drell looked to each other. \"Say, that's not a bad idea...\" Atticus said. \"Uh, I'm sure Mo was just kidding, Atticus!\" Cherry smiled nervously. \"Yeah!\" Drell agreed. \"Was I?\" Mo folded her arms. \"Come on, let's not do something we'll regret...\" Cherry smiled nervously to Atticus. \"Look at this face, aren't I too cute to send away on a desert island with a brutish ogre man?\" \"What you call me?!\" Drell glared. \"See what I mean?\" Cherry smiled nervously. \"Okay...\" Atticus smirked darkly which could rival King Sombra himself. \"We'll look for the dogs and YOU TWO learn how to get along!\" \"No, no, please, no!\" Cherry begged. \"Don't leave me alone with him!\" \"Please, please, please don't leave me alone with her!\" Drell begged. Atticus had enough of them and sent them away. \"Oh, Dad, you didn't!\" Akito hiccuped. \"I did...\" Atticus replied as he remembered that. \"Why?\" Estelle asked. \"I thought it'd teach them a lesson...\" Atticus folded his arms. \"And, it actually did.\" \"Cool.\" Vincent said. \"Your Aunt Cherry may be scary now, but she used to be kind of annoying...\" Atticus smiled sheepishly. \"Don't tell her I said that though.\" \"Our lips are sealed.\" The kids, Pokemon, Snow White, and pups said. Atticus laughed weakly. Back in the story... Atticus, Mo, Buddy, and Molly were walking around town and spotted the sheriff's station. \"Let's go see if the sheriff's seen them.\" Mo suggested. \"I sure hope so.\" Scamp said. The two teenagers and the dogs decided to go check in the station. Along the way, they passed a boy and his own dog. Francois gave an evil eye to the Buddies, Colette, Patch, and Oddball and decided to have a little word with them since they were all alone. \"Everyone, get behind me, we've got company.\" Patch told them as he stood firmly towards a familiar dog. The others then did as said, knowing that would be a very good idea. \"Hi there, Adam, what can I do for ya?\" the sheriff asked the boy who came in while Atticus and Mo decided to wait their turn. \"I, uh, am here to sign up for the race.\" Adam handed a paper over to the man. The old man began to think Adam was signing his father up for the race. \"Oh, your old man's coming out of retirement?\" he asked out of excitement at first. \"Alright, that is just the best news-\" Adam tried to explain, but didn't get a chance to. \"You can consider him already signed up!\" the sheriff smiled. \"I mean done and done!\" \"No, no, it's for-\" Adam tried again. But unfortunately, Adam couldn't get a word out to him. Adam felt like giving up. \"Bonjour, my little friends.\" Francois smiled darkly to the puppies. \"What do you want?\" Patch growled. \"Aren't you as beautiful as the yellow snow?\" Francois replied. \"I just came by to wish you luck.\" \"I know the reason why you came here, Francois, it was just to try and scare us, well, it won't work,\" Patch growled. \"I saw that look in your eyes before you came over here.\" \"Oh, you're all just brave to race after the horrible thing that happened to Shasta's parents.\" Francois insisted. \"What are you talking about?\" Patch growled, getting up close to Francois. \"Horrible?\" B-Dawg shuddered in fear. \"They were crossing the frozen lake on the home stretch of the race,\" Francois explained. \"The ice broke and Shasta's parents perished. The whole family is cursed.\" \"Cursed?\" B-Dawg repeated nervously. \"You don't scare us, you big bully!\" Oddball glared. \"And we don't believe in curses, so you better go back to your sled team before I starting beating the crud out of you.\" Patch threatened Francois. \"Yeah, right, of course!\" B-Dawg agreed with Patch to sound tough. \"Yeah, right, of course not, anyways, bon chance!\" Francois called before laughing mockingly. \"I swear, the next time I see that dog, I am going to make sure he doesn't torment anyone else.\" Patch growled. Adam and Shasta came out of the sheriff's office then. \"That's scary.\" Budderball commented about Francois's story. \"What if something like that happens to us?\" \"Scary? Pshaw!\" B-Dawg scoffed. \"B-Dawg is all about the scary!\" \"Shh, here he comes.\" Rosebud said to the others. \"So are we in?\" Patch asked Adam. \"Well, more or less...\" Adam replied. The Buddies whimpered slightly, a little nervous because of what Francois told them. \"Don't let his story get to you.\" Patch whispered. \"Come on, let's go!\" Oddball told her friends and uncle. \"Agreed.\" Colette nodded. With that, they then moved out, little did they know, their humans and parents were coming for them.[Chapter 15] Jessica sighed as she sat in the backyard, still mourning the loss of Oddball, then saw a familiar cat and forced herself to be social with her. \"Hello, Ms. Mittens, how are you?\" \"I'm looking for that B-Dawg, have you seen him?\" the cat sounded angry. \"No, I haven't seen him or the Buddies or Patch or Colette or Oddball or even Buddy and Molly and I can't seem to find Atticus, Mo, or Cherry either.\" Jessica said, confused of where they might be. \"Well, if you see that boy, you tell him that he needs to stop chasing my kitten!\" Ms. Mittens looked very firm and angry about B-Dawg. \"You tell his parents that he's gonna end up in the pound too!\" \"Wait, you mean you saw him?\" Jessica asked. \"Yes, days ago, but not recently,\" Ms. Mittens replied. \"Did you happen to see Oddball with him?\" Jessica asked hopefully. \"She's my dalmatian, she has a few spots on her legs and has more coming in and has a pink nose with a purple collar?\" \"No, I just saw him at that truck.\" Ms. Mittens said. Jessica sighed. \"Well, thank you, Ms. Mittens... Wait, what truck?\" \"Over there?\" Ms. Mittens gestured to the ice cream truck making a round. Jessica looked closely and could've sworn she saw a tiny football on the vehicle. \"Budderball?\" This then gave her an idea what to do. Christopher was coming out with two cups of hot chocolate. \"I know you miss Oddball, but I got you some-\" he then looked around for his future wife. \"Jessica...?\" He then saw Jessica going after a truck. \"Jessica!\" he called out. \"Where are you going?!\" \"I'm bringing Oddball home!\" Jessica called back. Christopher could already tell this might be there first adventure so he decided to come along with her. Jessica kept chasing down the ice cream truck, not caring how far it was going. Christopher continued to follow after his fiancée. Jessica ran with ease while Christopher slightly panted. \"Hey, Chris! \"Hey...\" Christopher panted as he couldn't run as fast as her. \"Wow! You're really fast...\" \"Thanks, it helps being on the gymnastics team.\" Jessica said. \"You've always been impressive.\" Christopher smiled back. \"I know.\" Jessica said. They kept running and then ended up in the airport. \"There's the ice cream crate!\" Christopher pointed. Jessica rushed right over to the crate. Christopher ran with her. \"I gotta tell you, Jessie, this is something I never thought I'd see myself doing... I mean... What happens when we have kids?\" \"I like the names Riley and Bonnie.\" Jessica smiled. \"Oh, no, Jessie, I don't mean right now!\" Christopher smiled nervously about becoming a father. \"It's okay, we've got plenty of time.\" Jessica said. \"Yeah...\" Christopher chuckled. \"So, uh, Riley and Bonnie?\" \"Well, Riley's a unisex name...\" Jessica shrugged. \"Might be good for our first child.\" \"Cool.\" Christopher smiled. \"Yeah,\" Jessica smiled as they sat together to hide out when the delivery would be sent to Alaska. \"It's a nice name... Um... How about this... Riley Jillian Anderson if it's a girl or Riley William Anderson if it's a boy?\" she then suggested. \"I like it.\" Christopher smiled. Jessica smiled back. \"Riley, huh?\" Christopher then asked. \"I think it's a cool name, plus if Atticus was gonna be born a girl, we were gonna name him Bonnie.\" Jessica replied innocently. \"Good to know.\" Christopher said. \"It's a deal.\" Jessica smirked. Christopher chuckled and smiled to her. \"You wanna be a mom, huh?\" \"Yeah, it'd be nice,\" Jessica sighed happily. \"It seems wonderful.\" \"Well, I'm sure you'll be a wonderful mother.\" Christopher smiled. Jessica smiled back. \"Oh, no, we're going to Alaska and we don't have our coats!\" Christopher realized. \"Please, allow me.\" Jessica said before wiggling her nose and made winter coats appear by magic. \"You are amazing.\" Christopher said. \"Well, that's one word for it.\" Jessica smiled. \"Well, we better get some rest it's a long trip to Alaska.\" Christopher said. Jessica nodded and leaned her head against his shoulder and yawned instantly sleepily. Christopher smiled, then fell asleep with her. \"Night, Jessie.\" \"Night.\" Chrissy.\" Jessica smirked. Meanwhile back at Alaska... Talon was heard barking outside. This woke Shasta up and he went into the shed to wake the others up. \"Everyone, wake up.\" Shasta whispered. \"Hmm?\" Colette woke up first with a yawn. \"What is it, Shasta?\" \"Talon's calling for us,\" Shasta replied. They all then heard a wolf howl and they left the shed to meet Talon. \"I wonder why Talon is calling us late at night.\" Patch said. \"This better be good.\" Oddball pouted. \"I'm sure it is.\" Budderball said. The puppies came out to meet their wolf mentor. \"I called on you tonight because there's one last thing I still need to teach you pups,\" Talon said said to his company. \"Look up.\" They did as told and looked to see the Aurora Borealis. \"The Aurora Borealis.\" Patch said. \"Correct, my friend,\" Talon nodded to him. \"The Northern Lights and the spirit of all your ancestors, including your parents, Shasta. Now, pups, I must say goodbye.\" \"But... The race is tomorrow...\" Rosebud said to him. \"I have taught you all you need to know.\" Talon replied. \"But why do you have to leave?\" Oddball pouted. \"Because Shasta is now ready take his place in his long lineage of great Alaskan lead dogs.\" Talon said, looking to the husky puppy. \"But, we'll be all alone.\" Budderball replied. \"Yeah, wise dog, Budderball's got a point.\" B-Dawg agreed. \"How do you know we'll be cool?\" \"When you feel doubt, these lights will remind you that you're never really alone.\" Talon advised. \"If you say so.\" Oddball frowned as tears started to fill up in her eyes. \"Oh, dear...\" Colette nuzzled against her boyfriend's niece. \"How can you know for sure though?\" Oddball sniffled to Talon. \"Sometimes you just have to have faith,\" Talon said to her, he then went to take his leave against the Northern Lights. \"We'll miss you.\" Oddball frowned. \"Goodbye...\" Rosebud said softly and sadly. \"We'll sure miss you.\" Budderball added in. \"Hang loose, sir.\" MudBud frowned. \"Maximum respect.\" B-Dawg stated. \"Namaste, sled master.\" Buddha finished. \"Thank you, Talon,\" Shasta concluded. \"We'll never forget you.\" \"And we will never forget the lessons you've taught us.\" Patch added. \"Live long and prosper.\" Colette phrased. Talon nodded and he seemed to disappear within the lights somehow. \"Wow...\" Oddball blinked in surprise. \"Well, that just happened.\" Colette said. \"He disappeared into the lights?\" Akito and Estelle asked Patch in shock and surprise. \"I swear, he did, it was like he was an angel or something!\" Patch replied. \"Or a spirit.\" Colette said. \"Either way, it was an interesting sight.\" Patch then nodded. \"So, later that night, was B-Dawg scared again?\" Scruffy asked. \"Not too badly,\" Patch replied. \"But he found the courage to admit he was scared.\" Flashback shows us B-Dawg up late at night again. \"Colette?\" B-Dawg spoke up. \"You still awake?\" \"Yeah?\" Colette replied. \"Are you afraid?\" B-Dawg asked. \"A little bit, dear...\" Colette tiredly nodded, but paid attention to him. \"Well, if you can believe it, I am too...\" B-Dawg admitted. \"It's okay to be scared, but admitting it makes you brave.\" Colette smiled to him. \"My father always told me that.\" \"Then he must be very wise.\" B-Dawg said. \"Oh, he is,\" Colette smiled. \" \"Colette, you're not gonna tell anyone, are you?\" B-Dawg asked nervously about his brothers and sister finding out about this secret. \"Your secret is safe with me.\" Colette promised with a smile. \"Thanks, Colette, night.\" B-Dawg smiled before going to sleep. \"Night, B-Dawg.\" Colette yawned and fell back asleep. And so they all got plenty of sleep. \"Colette?\" B-Dawg asked. \"Mm-hmm?\" Colette replied tiredly. \"Thanks.\" B-Dawg then said about their talk. \"No problem.\" Colette replied, tired. They all then fell asleep for the night because there was a big day ahead of them tomorrow. The next day soon arrived.[Chapter 16] Adam woke up bright and early and snuck the sled out of the shed, reminding the puppies to be quiet so his parents wouldn't wake up and see them. And where they each did so. Shasta led with them as they were on their way to the race as it was about to begin. And where this would be a surprise. Atticus and Mo came out of the sheriff's office. \"Man, that guy has a one tract mind, does he not?\" Atticus moaned. \"You can say that again.\" Mo groaned. Atticus sighed. \"Can't you use your magic to track the dogs down?\" Mo asked. Atticus smiled nervously. \"It's Edipan...\" \"Dang it.\" Mo frowned. Atticus and Mo sighed as they felt lost, then looked as they saw people gathering. \"Hey, what's going on?\" Mo called out to the crowd. \"You dont' know?\" a man smiled in excitement. \"It's about time for the sled race!\" \"Sled race?\" Mo asked her boyfriend, hoping he would have the answer. \"I haven't been to one, but sled races are a big deal in Alaska.\" Atticus said back to Mo. \"I've read all sorts of books on them. It's like the Super Bowl to them.\" \"Wow, you really like to study.\" Mo said. \"It's a beautiful curse...\" Atticus smiled softly. Mo then sighed. \"I know...\" Atticus sighed with her. \"I miss Patch a lot... He's family.\" \"I just wish that there was a sign telling us where he and the others are.\" Mo said. \"I know...\" Atticus agreed as he looked like he was about to cry. Mo brought him into a hug to comfort him. Atticus sniffled and hugged her back. Unknown to them, Patch and the others were closer than they thought. 'Welcome to the Annual Fernituktuk Race, coming to you live from the starting line!' an announcer announced as the people and dogs were getting ready for the race. 'We're almost there.' Oddball thought to herself. \"Feeling cold, Oddball?\" Budderball asked the female dalmatian in worry. \"No, I'm fine.\" Oddball smiled. Budderball smiled back to her as they were on their way to the starting line. The announcer introduced last year's champion who was Francois and Felipe's master, he smiled smugly to the crowd, but they threw snowballs at him and booed at him. \"I have a feeling these people don't like him that much.\" Patch smirked. \"I knew there was something wrong about him,\" Colette said. \"He gave me a weird feeling when we first met him with Shasta by accident.\" \"Just proves that dogs are an excellent judge of character.\" Patch smiled and nodded to her. \"Yeah, we are.\" Budderball said. The announcer then introduced someone known as Duke Bilson as Adam and the puppies were getting ready to join the other racers. 'Wait, I spoke too soon, it looks like... Puppies?!' the announcer looked surprised once Adam and his team arrived. \"Just ignore the laughter.\" Patch whispered. \"We'll try...\" Oddball frowned, it was hard since she was only a puppy after all and took things harder and more seriously than an older dog would. There were some welcoming cheers from the crowd though, but they did hear some rough laughter from Francois and Felipe's owner. The other racers just smiled however, whether by amusement or support was unknown for right now. \"I cannot believe it!\" Francois and Felipe's master laughed at Adam and his sled team. \"You're sending pups and a small boy to do the job?!\" 'This guy is going down.' Colette said. Francois and Felipe turned to see Shasta with the other puppies. \"What are you cutie runts doing here?\" Francois glared. \"We're here to kick some tail,\" Rosebud replied assertively. \"Yours in particular.\" \"You have just about as much a chance of winning the race as Shasta's parents do.\" Francois taunted. \"Don't you dare mention my parents.\" Shasta growled at Francois. Francois rolled his eyes and turned away. \"Son, when you asked me to enter a Bilson in the race, I didn't know you were talking about you.\" the sheriff came up to Adam once he saw he was racing instead of his father. \"You didn't ask me, Sheriff,\" Adam replied, trying to resist rolling his eyes due to how loopy the old man could be. \"And I wrote my name in the application.\" Patch, Colette, and the pups were all now waiting for the Sheriff's answer. The Sheriff looked over the papers to see Adam's name listed. \"Well, I'll be a moose's nephew! So you did.\" \"And I paid the entry fee.\" Adam added in. \"Yeah, yeah, you did.\" the Sheriff noticed now. Patch smiled, liking how this was going. \"Sheriff, we can do this.\" Adam told the old man with full confidence. The Sheriff looked to the puppy team and the young boy. \"You sure you know what you're getting into, son?\" he warned Adam for his safety and his young age. \"This here is a treacherous race.\" \"Yes, sir, we're prepared, sir.\" Adam replied maturely. \"I don't know...\" the sheriff was hesitant due to how young they were, then looked over the guidelines. \"There's nothing in the rules that says a boy and his pups can't race, so... The boy is in!\" The crowd cheered while Francois and Felipe's owner just laughed at them. 'I can't wait to beat this guy.' Patch thought to himself. \"Good luck, pups!\" Bernie warned the young dogs before leaving with the Sheriff. \"Remember to be safe.\" \"We sure will, Bernie.\" Patch said. \"Good luck, comrade!\" one racer gave a thumb's up to Adam and his team. \"Thanks.\" Adam smiled to him. \"Stay clear of Jean George,\" the female racer warned them about Francois and Felipe's master. \"He'll do anything to win.\" \"Thank you.\" Adam replied to her. \"Like your father before you, you will eat my powder.\" Jean George mocked Adam with a wicked laugh. Patch began to growl at Jean. \"What're we gonna do while they race?\" Colette asked. \"Get under the blanket, you'll be warm in case we need you.\" Patch instructed, showing the sled's blanket. \"Ooh, that blanket does look warm.\" Oddball smiled. \"It'll be a good place to wait in case of emergency.\" Patch smiled back. The three then went under the blanket while Shasta and the Buddies would race for now. \"Mushers, take your mark!\" the sheriff called. \"Wait, Uncle Patch, you're not goin' to be out with them?\" Oddball whispered. \"I think the Buddies should do this for now,\" Patch whispered back. \"Besides, I don't want Buddha to be left out.\" \"Aw! That's so kind of you, honey.\" Colette whispered. Patch smiled back. The three then hid under the blanket. \"Stay warm, Oddball.\" Budderball smiled to the dalmatian he liked very much. \"I sure will.\" Oddball smiled back. \"Stay focused, Romeo.\" MudBud smirked. \"Um, right.\" Budderball returned focus. Adam, Shasta, and the Buddies were all now focused just like the other sled teams. \"The big race!\" Dot squealed. \"Dot, I understand you're excited, so am I, but please be quiet so Dad can continue on.\" Scruffy said. \"Look who's talkin'.\" Dot teased her occasionally hyperactive brother. \"Touche.\" Scruffy groaned. \"Anyway, please continue, Dad.\" Dot smiled in excitement. \"Of course...\" Patch nodded. \"I was under the blanket with your cousin and your mother and Adam was ready to begin the race.\" Flashback goes back to the race. \"MUSH!\" the sheriff called, which then started the race. \"For Talon!\" Shasta called. \"FOR TALON!\" the Buddies called back as they began to ran through the snow. And with that, the sled teams were off. The racers commanded their dogs and they were off. Meanwhile... Christopher and Jessica were snuggled up next to each other in the ice cream crate and were now being lowered for the delivery drop to Alaska. \"Why does it feel like we're about to move?\" Christopher asked. \"We probably are...\" Jessica smirked, feeling adventurous. \"Jessie, I don't know about this...\" Christopher got nervous. \"Ah, have a sense of adventure, Chrissy!\" Jessica encouraged her future husband. They began to feel the crate move downward. \"Here we go!\" Jessica smiled in excitement. Christopher felt nervous however as he held onto Jessica and screamed as they were falling to the Alaskan ground. \"WAHOO!\" Jessica cheered. Christopher and Jessica screamed, Christopher in fear and Jessica in delight. \"ADVENTURE!\" Jessica laughed like an excited child at a candy store or an amusement park. \" WE'RE GONNA DIE! \" Christopher screamed. \"This is awesome!\" Jessica gushed. The parachute came out and they were now floating down safely in the forests of Alaska. Atticus and Mo decided to watch the race, but the dogs and racers were already gone now. 'As the racers broach the forest, last year's champ, Jean George, is in the lead, and little Adam Bilson trails the pack.' the announcer announced. \"Please tell me he means little like short and not little as in child little.\" Mo said, worried. Atticus shrugged himself. \"Maybe the Sheriff knows.\" Mo said. \"Excuse me, sir?\" Atticus noticed the sheriff. \"Sir!\" The Sheriff looked around and smiled. \"Well, hello there!\" \"Sir, please tell us that this, uh, Adam Bilson isn't a child.\" Mo begged. \"Adam Bilson?\" the sheriff replied. \"You'd never heard of him?\" \"No, sir, we're new here.\" Atticus said. \"Adam Bilson,\" the sheriff told them about the boy racing. \"His father was a decent racer, Duke Bilson, before he retired, and now he's going with his pup Shasta and five golden puppies... Even a couple of dalmatians and a cocker spaniel.\" \"Wait, what did you just say?\" Mo asked. \"Adam Bilson's old man-\" the sheriff started. \"No, no, about the team, what's this about golden retriever puppies and others?\" Mo asked. \"Five golden retriever puppies, two dalmatian puppies, and a cocker spaniel puppy.\" the sheriff then said. \"Patch must have used magic to make him and Colette into puppies.\" Atticus whispered to Mo. \"Then that means they're here...\" Mo whispered back. \"Do you know the direction they went?\" Atticus asked the sheriff. \"Why, they're off with the racers, of course.\" the sheriff pointed to the groups leaving for the race. \"Thank you, sir.\" Atticus and Mo said before going to get the dogs. \"Whoa, wait, it's too dangerous!\" the sheriff warned as Buddy and Molly were obviously going to save their babies. Jean George and Adam were close to each other. Jean then kicked Adam off of his sled and laughed as the boy was then pulled by his sled and was sliding down with the dogs pulling him. \"That was cheating!\" Oddball called out. \"Sayonara!\" Jean George laughed as he took the lead, leaving the others in the metaphorical dust. The other races rushed by as they were trailing farther behind. \"Listen, I'm gonna keep an eye on the race from home base, but you best be getting out on the trail,\" the sheriff told Bernie as he was on his way to his home station. \"I'll see you at the finish line.\" Bernie nodded and saw Jessica and Christopher were rushing over to meet the sheriff to ask him for help, but found the St. Bernard first. Jessica knelt in front of him. \"Have you seen five golden retriever puppies, two dalmatians, and a cocker spaniel?\" she then asked the dog to show that she could speak with and understand him. \"Jessica? Christopher?\" Atticus's voice asked. Mo stepped in her tracks and looked with her boyfriend. \"You mean Oddball, Patch, Colette, and the Buddies?\" Bernie replied to the young adult couple. \"You bet I seen 'em! I never thought I'd see puppies in the Ferntiuktuk Annual Dog Sled Race.\" \"Jessica!\" Atticus ran to his older sister. \"Atty!\" Jessica looked back and hugged her younger brother. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, I'm fine and so are Buddy, Molly, Scamp, Danielle, Annette, and Angel.\" Atticus said. \"How many pets are here?\" Christopher asked, a bit confused. \"This is it, Christopher.\" Scamp spoke up. \"Oh, boy...\" Christopher rubbed his head. 'Good thing I'm not allergic.\" \"Now, wait a second, did you say something about the pups in a race?\" Molly asked Bernie. \"Yes, they're in Ferntiuktuk, it's the most treacherous race in all of Alaska,\" Bernie explained. \"It's some of the meanest terrain on Gabriel's white Earth.\" \"Oh, no...\" Jessica said worried. \"Can you take us to them?\" Molly begged. \"Some of them are our pups.\" \"I'm the rescue dog, I was just about to head out on the trail,\" Bernie replied. \"Follow me.\" \"Oh, thank you.\" Mo smiled. Bernie then led the way to a shortcut. \"I hope the pups aren't in danger.\" Mo said. \"I just hope none of the racers gets Patch angry.\" Atticus added in. \"Can you guys keep up?\" Bernie asked the other puppies. \"Don't worry, we got this!\" Scamp promised as he ran with his girlfriend and sisters. \"Yeah, we've got plenty of speed!\" Danielle added. \"Especially me!\" Angel smiled. Meanwhile back with Adam and the pups... It was started to snow. Jean George started to whip his dogs and even whipped the racing man next to him and made him fall off of his sled. Adam eventually got back up and remembered to command the dogs. \"We're gonna win.\" Oddball whispered. It was now night time and Adam and the puppies were hurrying up to the first checkpoint. \"How can the checkpoint be so far?\" Colette asked. \"It's a tradition!\" Shasta called to her. \"This race lasts a while!\" After a while, they finally made it to the first checkpoint. Little did they know, Adam's parents were on the way to fetch their son. \"We finally made it.\" Patch smiled. The other racers were going to feed and relax their dogs after their long journey before resting up for the night to continue the race tomorrow. Jean George then smirked at the female racer as she was distracted and then cut the ropes and latches that her dogs would be hooked up to. \"How are you feeling?\" Budderball asked Oddball. \"Good, but I smell a cheater.\" Oddball said. \"Well, thank goodness we made it,\" Budderball smiled to her. \"I'm starving!\" \"Some food does sound good right about now.\" Oddball agreed as she had shifty eyes. Patch then secretly used his magic and food magically appeared for them. Buddha decided to do some yoga to relax himself about their journey so far. \"Good, no one's limping.\" Adam smiled as he checked over the racing Buddies. He then did a double take when the food magically appeared. \"Hungry?\" Patch smiled to the others. \"I'm sure you'll all find this food to be perfectly impeccable.\" \"Impeca what?\" Budderball asked. \"Impeccable,\" Patch repeated. \"It means really wonderful.\" \"Oh,\" Budderball smiled then. He then noticed his bowl of food was big enough for two. \"That looks like a lot of food, even for just me,\" he had to admit for once, then looked over. \"Erm, Oddball, would you like to eat with me?\" The Buddies gasped slightly at shock of Budderball sharing his food. \"Sure.\" Oddball accepted his offer as she came over to him. Budderball smiled to her and allowed her to eat with him. Oddball smiled back and the two began to eat together like a little dinner date. \"You make me proud.\" Adam nuzzled against Shasta. \"And I'm sure his parents are smiling down at him from the Northern Lights.\" Patch smiled. Adam smiled back. \"We better get enough for the night and get some rest, the race starts again bright and early tomorrow.\" \"And we'll be ready.\" Patch said. \"Good.\" Adam nodded with a smile. \"Um, Rosebud, would you like to eat with me?\" Shasta then invited the female golden retriever puppy. \"I wouldn't mind at all.\" Rosebud smiled. Shasta smiled back. It was a good night for everyone.[Chapter 17] Well, almost everyone, the others were still hurrying the best they could to find the missing Buddies, Patch, Colette, and Oddball with the help of Bernie the St. Bernard. \"We need to stop and rest.\" Christopher panted. \"Oh, all right...\" Jessica said, then stopped with him and called to the others. \"Come on, guys, take five!\" \"It's probably for the best, it's getting dark.\" Atticus said. \"Thank you...\" Christopher sounded relieved. \"Atty, what do you think of the name 'Riley'?\" Jessica asked her younger brother. \"I think it's a perfect name.\" Atticus said. Jessica smiled back. \"Are you, um,...\" Mo was about to ask. \"Expecting anyone?\" Jessica looked slightly nervous then as Christopher was distracted by the dogs. \"Um... I-I-I think so...\" \"Aw!\" Mo smiled. \"I don't know for sure, but I've been extra tired lately and I've been craving fish a lot...\" Jessica replied. \"I haven't taken a test yet though.\" Atticus then conjured up a thermometer and where nothing seemed to go wrong. \"Looks like Wiccan magic isn't affected by Alaska's weather.\" he then said. \"Huh, I've never heard about that...\" Jessica replied. \"I learned about how the weather here affects warlock's and witch's powers.\" Atticus said before putting the thermometer away and then conjuring up a pregnancy test and the conjured up a cabin for them to sleep in with bedrooms and a bathroom. Jessica took the pregnancy test, already knowing it was for her. \"Thanks, Atty.\" \"Sure.\" Atticus smiled. \"Let's quickly go inside.\" Mo shivered. With that, they did as suggested. Jessica went into the bathroom before anyone else, feeling she needed it more right now than anyone else. \"Now, we just have to wait for her to get her answer.\" Angel said. \"What's a stick gonna tell her anyway?\" Danielle asked. Patch nervously looked to the younger ones who looked curious themselves. \"Um... Five minutes later...\" he then said, deciding to change the subject before they would ask where babies came from. Atticus, Mo, Christopher, and the dogs soon heard Jessica's scream of joy from the bathroom. \"Jessica!\" Christopher ran to the bathroom door. Jessica opened the door and wrapped her arms around his neck nad planted several kisses onto his face. \"Jessica, what is it?\" Mo asked. Jessica had joyful tears in her eyes. \"I'm going to have a baby!\" Atticus gasped, feeling the most shocked. \"Y-You mean I'm gonna be an uncle?!\" \"How did you take it, Dad?\" Akito smiled. \"I was totally cool.\" Atticus smiled. \"More like so excited just as your aunt that your dad fainted.\" Mo said. \"I did not faint...\" Atticus stuck his tongue out. Unfortunately, Atticus was a terrible liar as the flashback shows that he did faint from the news. \"Daaaad...?\" Akito, Estelle, and Vincent looked to their father. \"Okay, so I fainted...\" Atticus then admitted. \"I can't believe you did,\" Mo laughed. \"Not even Twilight fainted when Cadence was pregnant with Flurry Heart.\" \"No, she didn't.\" Atticus said. Mo just laughed. Atticus sighed and rolled his eyes to his wife. \"I'm going to be a father?\" Christopher sounded surprised. \"Yes, isn't that great?!\" Jessica smiled. Christopher sat down on his bed and held his head. \"I'm going to be a mother!\" Jessica squealed. \"Oh, this is so exciting!\" Mo smiled. Atticus eventually woke up. \"Congratulations, guys... But... You aren't married yet... When did you start thinking about having children?\" Christopher and Jessica looked nervous then. \"Really?\" Mo asked. \"Uh, let's go to sleep.\" Jessica changed the subject. \"Agreed.\" Christopher said. Angel yawned and stretched. \"Now that you mention it, I do feel rather sleepy.\" \"Me too...\" Scamp agreed. \"I need my beauty sleep.\" Annette nodded. \"I guess a little sleep could work.\" Scamp yawned. Danielle snored loudly, already having fallen asleep. \"I guess Danielle already had that thought in mind.\" Molly giggled. \"Night, everybody,\" Buddy said. \"Hopefully we find the others tomorrow morning.\" \"I certainly hope so.\" Jessica agreed as she worried about Oddball. \"I know we will.\" Bernie said. \"Thanks for your help so far,\" Mo smiled to Bernie as she got into a bed. \"We really appreciate it.\" \"It's the least I can do.\" Bernie smiled. \"Good night...\" Mo pulled her bandanna down over her eyes. The others said good night to each other and decided to get some sleep for the night after a big day. The next day, they would continue on.[Chapter 18] The next morning, the racers began to wake up and get themselves and their dogs ready. \"On the road again.\" Patch said. \"Yep...\" Colette yawned and stretched. \"Let's hit the road.\" Budderball yawned. Adam commanded the puppies. The puppies had a slow start at first, but eventually picked up the pace and ran with the other racers. \"I guess we're staying under the blanket from now on.\" Oddball said. \"Unless somebody gets hurt.\" Patch reminded his niece. \"Oh, right.\" Oddball said. \"Don't worry, dear.\" Colette smiled. \"I'm sure you'll race soon enough.\" \"If Buddha gets hurt, then I can be by Budderball's side like Rosebud and Shasta are.\" Oddball said to herself dreamily. \"Well, should one of us check outside and see what's going on?\" Colette asked. \"I'll do it, you guys stay warm.\" Patch offered as he wiggled out slightly to take a look to the outside world. And where he saw that the female racers sled was starting to drift away from her dogs. \"Cozy?\" he smiled to the others with him. \"Mm-hmm...\" Colette and Oddball smiled back to him. \"Great.\" Patch smiled. \"Oh, I hope Budderball's okay up there.\" Oddball hoped. \"I'm sure he's okay.\" Patch said. Bernie woke up the others. \"Come on, guys, we better get to the Midway Checkpoint.\" Mo groaned, but woke up with the others and pulled her bandanna up. They all quickly got ready and freshened up for the day and then moved out to the bitter cold, all luckily warm enough as the snow fell. \"We better start running.\" Atticus said. \"Come on then!\" Mo was quicker than the others. They had to stop at one point however because one racer was knocked out in the middle of the snow and Bernie came to check him over. \"Sir, are you alright?\" Atticus asked. \"I think I fell off my sled...\" the man mumbled. \"Oh, dear...\" Mo frowned. Bernie licked the man to soothe and relax him to bring him to. \"Are you going to be alright to start walking, sir?\" Atticus asked. \"I'm not sure...\" the man frowned. \"We might need to give this man a hand.\" Mo said as Atticus helped the man up. \"Come here, I got you.\" Atticus helped. \"Thank you,\" The man said before feeling his muscles. \"You sure are strong.\" \"Aw, it's nothing, come on, let's get you up.\" Atticus replied. The man tried to walk, but seemed to wince as he took a step forward. \"Oh, my, you must've gotten sprained.\" Mo winced as well to that. \"I need a doctor...\" the man frowned. Atticus then carried the man the only non-weird way. Mo stepped back to give the man some room. \"Should we still go on?\" Danielle sounded impatient about staying in one spot for too long which was making her agitated. \"Yes.\" Atticus nodded having a firm, but not too strong grip on the man due to how he was. \"I wish I could help, sir...\" Mo gently put her hand on his sore spot. \"It's okay.\" The man said before he saw Mo's hand glow green and where the pain in his sore spot was gone. \"Huh?\" Mo then held up her hand and looked as it glowed slightly. And where it then stopped glowing. \"That was weird.\" Mo said. \"Hey, I don't feel so hurt anymore.\" the man said. \"Really?\" Atticus asked. \"Yeah, the pain, it's gone.\" The man said. \"Huh, what a strange occurrence.\" Bernie remarked. \"I'll say.\" Mo whispered to him. Scamp put his paw out as more and more snowflakes fell from the sky. \"Man, it's really coming down out here!\" \"We better hurry to the check-out point.\" Angel said. \"Yeah, let's keep moving,\" Danielle sounded impatient. \"I gotta move before I get cranky!\" \"Oh, be patient, will you?\" Annette sighed to her tomboy sister. \"Yeah.\" Angel agreed. \"Hmph!\" Danielle looked very irked. The snow was getting heavier and more stormy as Adam was going with the Buddies and Shasta, trying to stay strong through the coldness. Soon someone was coming to them. \"They're getting stronger,\" Patch told Colette and Oddball as he watched. \"Not strong as me, but they've come a long way for themselves.\" \"I agree.\" Colette said. \"Uh, Patch, you might want to take a look out here and see this!\" Budderball called out. \"'Scuse me, girls,\" Patch said before inching himself up against the blanket and poked his head out. \"What's wrong, guys?\" \"Look ahead, I think it's a bear or something.\" Budderball said. \"A bear?!\" Oddball overheard that and whimpered nervously. Patch soon looked ahead to see if the figure the saw coming to them was dangerous. \"Stop the sled.\" he then demanded. \"Stop the sled?\" Adam asked the dalmatian to see if he heard that right. \"Yes, stop the sled!\" Patch repeated. \"Whoa, guys, whoa!\" Adam called. Shasta then knew that meant stop, so he stopped and when he did, so did the Buddies. Patch growled aggressively and stormed for what he believed to be a bear so it wouldn't hurt any of his innocent friends or family. But he soon saw that it was a man. \"It's the Abominable Snow Dude!\" MudBud yelped. \"It's alright.\" Adam told the puppies. The man then had a friendly smile which became clear behind the snow and he gestured for the others to follow him. \"He wants you guys to follow him.\" Patch came over to Adam's side. \"Then you better get back under the blanket.\" Adam told him. \"No problem.\" Patch nodded and came between Colette and Oddball again. Adam then covered them up. \"Go follow him!\" Shasta and Rosebud nodded, then went to follow after the man. \"Help!\" a woman called as Atticus, Mo, Bernie, Angel, Scamp, Annette, Danielle, Buddy, and Molly kept moving. \"Someone help! I'm over here!\" Atticus soon rushed down over to where the woman was calling from. \"Man, I'm freezing!\" Mo shuddered. \"I hate the snow!\" \"Are you okay, ma'am?\" Atticus asked the woman as he came with the St. Bernard. \"Dirty scoundrel!\" the woman growled. \"He sabotaged my sled!\" \"Who sabotaged your sled, ma'am?\" Atticus asked, already having a pretty good idea who. \"Jean George,\" the woman scoffed. \"I didn't see him do it, but I know he did it, he'd do anything to win!\" \"I had a feeling that man was the cheating type.\" Atticus said, helping her up. \"Are you hurt any?\" Mo asked the woman. \"I'm not sure, but I think so, we had a really bad crash.\" the woman replied. \"I'll carry you the rest of the way.\" Atticus said as he carried her bridal style. Mo looked slightly jealous, but this woman was in pain and understood, she then checked over the dogs to see if they were at all hurt. And where she saw that they were fine, but tired. \"Oh, good, you guys aren't hurt...\" she then hugged the dogs. The dogs seemed to like Mo and even nuzzled against her and licked her. \"The boys seemed to really like you.\" The woman smiled. \"I've always been a dog person.\" Mo smiled back. Angel nuzzled up against Mo to prove her owner's point. The elder man was leading Adam and his team into his igloo, revealing he was an Eskimo with plenty of warm beds for his guests. There was a young teenage girl who was sitting by the fire and smiled to them. \"I don't know who that girl was,\" Patch narrated about the other human they met in that igloo. \"But she reminds me of your friend Ingrid based on what I've heard about you all say about her.\" \"Ingrid?\" Eliza was not familiar with the feral girl that Akito and Estelle knew on certain adventures. \"A girl we once met.\" Akito said. \"What's she like?\" Ingrid asked. \"Oh, man, she's just unbelievable...\" Estelle replied. \"I don't know if she's like this witch, a shaman, a voodoo priestess, or what, but she's just amazing!\" \"Cool.\" Eliza smiled. \"It's hard to put her into words, you could say she's like your Shaman friend, except not a warthog.\" Estelle smiled back to Eliza. \"Yeah.\" Vincent said. \"So, we went into the igloo and they had warmth for us, I was surprised when we first came in...\" Patch then continued. \"Ooh,\" Oddball shook, but in a good way. \"Kinda toasty in here.\" \"But how?\" Colette asked. \"It's because you're here.\" Patch smiled coyly to the female cocker spaniel. \"I'm serious.\" Colette said. \"Oh, um, I dunno...\" Patch shrugged. \"I was wondering that too.\" Rosebud said. \"Dudes, it's warm,\" MudBud smiled. \"Clean, but warm.\" \"Inuits use igloos as homes,\" Shasta told the others. \"The ice traps the heat.\" \"Cool.\" Oddball smiled. \"Or in this case, 'hot'.\" Budderball chuckled sheepishly. Adam crawled in and joined the dogs inside with the man who led them into his home. \"Father...\" the teenage girl smiled to the man. \"Ah, Neysa.\" the man smiled to his daughter. \"Hello.\" Patch smiled. \"Hello.\" Neysa smiled back, not seeming shocked or surprised that he spoke to her. \"Thank you both,\" Adam said to the Eskimo father and daughter. \"You saved us... Do you know about Puppy Power?\" he then asked the girl since she seemed to not be freaked out about him speaking. \"Yes, I have heard about it in legends, but I am relieved to see they are true,\" Neysa smiled. \"We also heard about you, Adam Bilson, and your puppy team on the radio.\" \"Well, looks like the news about us is already spreading.\" Colette smiled. \"I'll say.\" Adam agreed in surprise. \"Yes,\" the man nodded to them. \"Only you and Jean George are still in it, but now you should rest, young man.\" \"Yes, yes, you've all had such a long journey and many more ahead.\" Neysa agreed. \"Thank you.\" Oddball yawned before falling asleep next to Budderball. Neysa and her father then helped their company get settled in and comfortable for the night. Budderball fell asleep with Oddball, finding her company very soothing. Shasta began to make his way to Rosebud. Rosebud woke up slightly. Shasta gently nuzzled her in his sleep. Rosebud smiled, then slept next to him. \"It had to be the best night's sleep any of us had ever gotten.\" Patch smiled. \"And where the next day, we were going to be ready.\" Colette said. Patch then nodded, the story was almost all over.[Chapter 19] The next morning, Shasta came out of the igloo first. He saw that it was morning, so he woke everybody up. Patch was the first to wake up with a yawn. Adam woke up, he crawled out the door and smiled as he saw the fluffy snow and it was morning. \"Let's go, pups,\" he then told his canine team. \"We got a race to win.\" \"Yeah, we do!\" Oddball cheered. Neysa and her father wished the racers luck as they saddled up in the sled and moved out once again. This time though, Oddball was going to be on Budderball's side in the race so she could finally show the others what she was made of. And where Buddha was okay with taking a rest from yesterday. \"That's my girl.\" Patch smiled proudly as Oddball took her turn. \"This is so awesome.\" Oddball smiled. \"Let the force be with you, Oddball.\" Buddha whispered hopefully for the female dalmatian puppy. They didn't know it yet, but they were right next to Jean George and his team. Eventually, the two teams met. Adam yelped as he fell off his sled as the dogs were about to hit each other. Jean George laughed as he saw Adam fall as he kept going ahead with his dogs. \"That was so uncalled for!\" Oddball growled. \"Whoa, that was close!\" Shasta called in relief, then looked back to his human with a gasp. \"Adam's hurt!\" Patch and Colette rushed out of the blanket and saw Adam fall flat in the snow. Patch went over to see how badly injured Adam was. The puppies even came and tried to lick the boy awake. Adam grunted and tried to get them away. \"Stand back, guys, let him breathe.\" Patch told the Buddies. The Buddies all did so. \"Adam, are you all right?\" Colette asked the boy. \"Yeah, I'm okay, guys,\" Adam stood up, dusting himself and put the sled back on top in place. \"Hike!\" \"You heard the man, let's go!\" Oddball sounded mature now. Patch, Colette, and Buddha soon went back under the blanket before they were on the move again. \"Come on, Shasta, we can do this!\" Adam called. \"Hike! Hike!\" They were very far, but not too far now from the finish line. The announcer announced Adam's arrival with the puppies and everybody cheered for them. Adam saw Jean George stopping, so he told the pups to stop for now. \"Where you going?!\" he called to the bullying adult. \"It is too late, you cannot save them!\" Jean George yelled. \"Zhey are goners, huh?\" \"Seriously? He's just giving up on his dogs?\" Patch asked. \"Quitter...\" Colette huffed. Adam stopped and he took a closer look. Jean George's dogs were stuck in the water and the ice broke up around them and they looked as though they could drown. \"How come they broke the ice?\" Oddball asked. \"We didn't do that before!\" \"They fell through the ice because they're too heavy.\" Shasta replied, then looked back to the others. \"There's something I need to tell you guys...\" he then said softly and sadly. \"This is where my mom and dad died.\" \"We know, Shasta, Francois told us.\" Patch said. \"He did?\" Shasta asked in surprise. The others nodded to him to show that that fact was indeed true. \"And you still raced even though you knew it was so dangerous?\" Shasta then asked. \"Like Talon said, sometimes you just have to have faith.\" Buddha remembered. \"Yeah.\" Patch nodded. Shasta felt very touched that they all stayed with him even through all of that. \"How are we going to save them, Uncle Patch?\" Oddball asked. \"We'll have to pull them out.\" Patch said. \"Yes, that gives me an idea,\" Adam agreed, then hooked a hook up to Patch's collar since he was the strongest out of all the dogs. \"Here, you need to hook their sled up so we can pull them out.\" \"Oh, be careful, Patch.\" Colette hoped. \"I sure will.\" Patch said. The others watched as Patch mustered all of his strength combined with the boost given to him from Atticus to save Francois, Felipe, and the other huskies, even if they were kind of rude to them before and earlier when they all first met. \"Good boy.\" Adam smiled to Patch's bravery and strength. Patch then slowly and carefully hooked up Jean George's sled and saved all of the adult Huskies. Adam and Shasta were surprised with how strong Patch was. \"That's my Uncle Patch.\" Oddball smiled proudly. The Buddies smiled in admiration as Patch saved the Huskies without even breaking a sweat. \"Come on, you lazy mutts, let's go, we've got a race to win!\" Jean George scolded his dogs once they were back on the solid ground. \"Au revoir, my little pipsqueak!\" he then laughed at Adam and the others as he took the lead again and lashed his dogs with his whip. \"That double-crossing, crooked creep.\" Budderball growled. \"Patch, we might need you out here to help us gain enough speed to get to the finish line.\" Shasta said. \"Alright, I'm coming in!\" Patch got himself over to the team, then looked up. \"Adam, you need to put me in right now.\" \"My thoughts exactly.\" Adam said. Patch nodded back. \"Do you need to take my place up front?\" Shasta asked Patch. \"No way, Shasta, you are our leader.\" Patch said. \"I'll go and join Colette and Buddha.\" Rosebud said. \"I agree with the righteous decision.\" Buddha nodded to the others. Rosebud was then soon placed under the blanket with Colette and Buddha as Patch was placed where she was. \"Stay warm, Rosebud.\" Shasta smiled to the female golden retriever puppy. Rosebud smiled back to him and got comfortable with her brother and Colette. Patch took Rosebud's place and looked brave and determined as always, but even more so since he was going to be a sled dog now. Once Patch was in place, they were all now ready to start moving ahead. Jean Gorge took the lead again as Adam and his team came after. \"Zhose puppies saved our lives.\" Francois said as he ran with the others. \"Yeah, our musher abandoned us and left us for death!\" Felipe agreed. \"It's time to go on strike.\" Francois decided. Felipe agreed with that as they were not going to let their musher win. With that, the dogs then stopped. \"No, no, no!\" Jean George glared to his canine team. \"What are you doing?!\" he then lashed his whip out to make his dogs move. Adam called the commands as the dogs were moving quicker with Patch at the lead with Shasta. And where they were going faster than ever before and where they were reaching the finish line. The crowd went wild as Adam and the others crossed the finish line and no one would ever think it would be possible for a small boy and a bunch of puppies! 'They did it!' the announcer sounded the most happy next to Adam's parents. 'They did it! They won!' A man and a woman came from the crowd, feeling very proud of Adam's bravery and good work. Adam's father picked up the boy and spun him around in victory. Patch smiled, happy that they got to cross the finish line. \"You're not mad?\" Adam asked his father. \"Well, right now, I'm too proud to be mad.\" Mr. Bilson smiled to his son with a joyful laugh. Patch sounded happy to hear that, maybe now Adam could carry on the tradition. \"Uncle Patch, did you see me?\" Oddball beamed. \"Did you see what I did?!\" \"You were just amazing, Oddball!\" Patch smiled back to his niece. \"I'm sure your parents and brothers are very proud of you back in London!\" As Patch said that, we see a London home with an older Dalmatian couple with two male Dalmatian puppies who were watching the race on their television. \"Why, Dipstick, darling, do you suppose that's Oddball?\" Dottie asked her mate. \"No way, that couldn't be her,\" Dipstick said. \"Then again, that pup is wearing her dog collar and new dog license.\" \"But she has spots on her back!\" Little Dipper pointed out. \"Yeah, Oddball doesn't have spots!\" Domino agreed. \"But she did earn a spot after her adventure in that cake factory after escaping that horrible Cruella DeVil.\" Dipstick remembered that, proving that he had grown out of stupidity over the years. \"How on Earth did she get here and is that Patch as a pup?\" Dottie asked. \"That's a good question...\" Dipstick agreed. Back in Alaska... \"Wouldn't it be rad if Mom and Dad could be here?\" MudBud asked after Adam hugged his parents after being allowed to race for himself from now on. B-Dawg looked down sadly as he felt homesick. \"And Atticus, and Mo, and my brother and sisters...\" Colette sighed softly. \"Yeah...\" Patch added. However, they all heard familiar barking.[Chapter 20] As if on cue, Buddy, Molly, Angel, Scamp, Danielle, and Annette were coming. And not just them, but there was also Atticus and Mo! Along with Jessica and Christopher. \"Wow, I did not see that coming.\" Patch said. \"Jessica!\" Oddball squealed to her owner, then rushed out of the hooks and reigns, jumping on top of her. Jessica laughed as she fell backwards into the snow with her puppy licking at her face. \"Okay, okay, down, Oddball, down!\" she called between laughs. \"I missed you too!\" Patch and Colette both soon did the same thing as the magic in Patch's spell seemed to now wear off. They then turned back magically into their original ages. \"Buddies!\" Buddy smiled to his puppies as he and Molly embraced the five of them. \"Good job, Bernie, good job.\" The Sheriff smiled as he pet his St. Bernard for finding and reuniting everyone. \"Yo, what's crackalakin'?\" B-Dawg asked the ones who had come all this way just to look for them. \"What are you doing rollin' in this hood?\" \"Say what now?\" Oddball asked, confused. \"He wants to know why everyone's here.\" Budderball explained his smooth-talking brother. \"Oh.\" Oddball understood now. \"We came all this way to find you guys,\" Mo said to the dogs. \"We were worried.\" \"Especially us, Sis.\" Scamp said to Colette. \"Yeah.\" Annette said. Colette smiled and nuzzled against her siblings warmly and happily. \"Besides, we were right behind you the whole time.\" Buddy smiled as he stood with Molly. \"You were?\" Budderball asked. \"Of course,\" Molly replied. \"Your mom and I would search to the ends of the Earth to find you five.\" Buddy added in. \"Where's MudBud?\" Molly then wondered. \"Mom, I'm right in front of you.\" MudBud replied, hard to recognize due to not being at all dirty. \"Wow, MudBud, we hardly recognized you, your fur is so clean.\" Mo smiled. \"Yes, your coat is spotless!\" Molly agreed. \"I know, I look disgusting.\" MudBud groaned. Shasta looked in the distance at this family reunion. \"Shasta, are you okay?\" Rosebud asked. \"Even though I can't see my mom and dad, I know they're still with me.\" Shasta replied softly. \"They will always be with you, Shasta.\" Patch assured him. Shasta felt so blessed to have found these new friends. \"Guys, look!\" Oddball pointed. The others looked as Jean George was being chased by his dog team who had enough of his bossiness and tyrannical behavior towards them, especially when he left them for dead back in the ice. \"That is what I call karma in action.\" Atticus said. \"Yep.\" Patch happily agreed as Jean George was finally getting what he deserved. \"Congratulations, young man.\" the Sheriff handed a trophy to Adam. Adam's parents were so proud and they took his picture with his dog sled team. \"I hate to ruin this moment, but shouldn't we get home?\" Angel asked after the picture was taken. \"Yes, it's time to go home.\" Mo agreed with her puppy. \"Would you guys like a lift to the airport?\" Duke offered to the company. \"There's a ride for Fernfield about to take off.\" \"Awesome.\" Atticus smiled before Cherry and Drell both appeared from their punishment. \"Um... Hi...\" Drell waved, he had a Hawaiian shirt on with shorts, sunglasses, and a towel around his shoulder. \"Aloha...\" Cherry added as she also had sunglasses and wore her summer short-sleeved jacket with Capri pants, her sneakers, and her hair worn up in a high ponytail. \"Atticus, did you send them to a deserted island or Hawaii?\" Mo asked. \"I was sure it was a deserted island...\" Atticus replied. \"Why do you guys look like you just came out of Hawaii?\" \"We worked together and found a bridge off the island and we started to follow it,\" Cherry explained. \"We then found more tropical regions and found out we were in Maui and ended up in the middle of a luau. We had free dinner and a show and got invited to the May Day Festival in Hawaii where Lilo's hula school is.\" \"Yeah, that's going to be your next destination.\" Drell said. \"Oh, boy...\" Atticus rolled his eyes with a sigh, but then smiled to his teenage puppy. \"Come on, Patch, let's go home.\" \"I'll never forget you, Shasta,\" Rosebud said to the male husky puppy before their final goodbye. \"You're a wonderful, brave, and great dog... Your parents would be so proud of you.\" \"Thanks, Rosebud, I'll never forget you either, you're beautiful, wonderful, and an amazing dog.\" Shasta smiled. \"Oh, for the love of peat, just kiss already!\" Budderball groaned. Rosebud and Shasta's eyes widened to that, but they then blushed to each other and gave each other one last final goodbye kiss. And where to them, it felt like they began to feel magic swirl around them. \"Whoa!\" Patch smiled. \"Sparks are flying!\" \"Not the only ones affected...\" Colette smirked as she saw Oddball and Budderball close together again. And where they kissed as well and where the same thing happened to them. Many of the others awed as they witnessed the most modest and adorable love there was: Puppy Love. Shasta, Oddball, Patch, Colette, and the Buddies were all sharing one last goodbye before they would get back home to Fernfield. \"I sure will miss you, Shasta.\" Rosebud frowned. \"I'll miss you too.\" Shasta nodded. \"If you're ever in Fernfield, look us up.\" Rosebud sadly smiled. Shasta sadly smiled back. \"Will do.\" \"Remember what we told ya, Shasta.\" MudBud said. \"Yeah, hang loose.\" Shasta smiled. \"Shasta, you are now officially part of my posse.\" Budderball smiled. \"Namaste, Shasta.\" Buddha agreed. \"Thank you all,\" Adam knelt down next to Shasta and put his arm around his puppy. \"We'll really miss you.\" \"We'll miss you both as well, Adam.\" Patch said. Adam's parents were surprised that Patch could talk, but Adam only smiled and waved goodbye to bid them a very fond farewell. Buddy and Molly went into the plane first and the Buddies followed after. Atticus, Mo, Cherry, Drell, Jessica, Christopher, Oddball, Scamp, Angel, Annette, Colette, and Danielle came after. Luckily, they were all able to fit in the biplane to take them all back home. \"Fernfield, here we come.\" Drell said. \"Goodbye, my friends!\" Shasta barked as the plane took off. \"Come back anytime, please!\" the Sheriff called as he waved with Bernie and Adam's parents. \"Oh, Oddball, I'm so glad you're safe...\" Jessica hugged her dalmatian puppy. \"I'm so glad I'm back with you, Jessica and I'm so glad I found my soulmate.\" Oddball smiled. \"Oh, you have?\" Jessica asked. Oddball smiled bashfully and shyly pointed to Budderball. Budderball started to smile the same way. \"Aww...\" Jessica cooed as she then hugged her puppy. \"Well, whenever we come to visit Atticus and the others, I'll be sure you can see Budderball as much as you want.\" Oddball smiled at that offer and licked her human which made her smile and laugh. \"And we all happily, safely, and warmly made it back home to where we belonged,\" Patch concluded the story of Oddball's adventure with the Air Buddies. \"The End.\" \"That's it?\" Dot asked. \"What about the wedding?\" \"Yeah.\" Scruffy added. \"That's another story.\" Patch replied. \"Aww...\" the others groaned as they had to wait until they would hear about Jessica and Christopher's wedding. 'Attention, passengers, attention, passengers,' the intercom alerted everyone and got their attention. 'The skies and roads have been cleared for our flights for Nome, Alaska, are now available. Repeat, the skies and roads have been cleared for our flights to Nome, Alaska.' \"That's weird, the moment Dad's done telling the story, the roads are clear.\" Scruffy said. \"What a weird coinky-dink!\" Colette giggled. \"Come on, guys,\" Mo came to the kids. \"Let's get going to Alaska!\" \"Yeah!\" the kids cheered. \"We're coming, Balto and Jenna.\" Akito smiled. \"And don't forget Kody.\" Estelle smiled as well. Everyone then got settled and ready for their flight to Alaska. \"Remember, parkas, everybody,\" Marianne warned her family as she got her video camera ready for her and Nigel's nature show. \"You know how cold Antarctica was.\" \"Yeah, the weather there can be cold, but hopefully, it will be warmer.\" Vincent said. \"Come on, Donnie, let's go!\" Estelle called for the feral Thornberry boy. Donnie babbled and giggled as he followed his family and the others to the plane ride. \"*sigh* Hopefully Donnie falls asleep on the way...\" Marianne sighed to her wild child. \"One can only hope.\" Mo sighed with a nod. Estelle's two Ralts soon came out of their Pokeballs with Teddy. \"Guys!\" Estelle gasped. \"Are we there yet, Mama?\" Teddy asked. \"No, sorry, but the flight got delayed,\" Estelle replied as she took out her Pokeballs to put them back inside. \"We're just leaving now.\" \"Can we be on the plane with you? We're bored in our Pokeballs.\" The Ralts twins said. \"Well... Just as long as you promise to behave.\" Estelle said. \"We promise.\" the Ralts twins and Teddy replied. \"Okay, come on then.\" Estelle hid them away as they were on their way to the plane to visit Alaska. \"This is going to be an interesting flight.\" Vincent said. \"You said it...\" Akito stretched as they walked through security before going onto the plane. \"Man, why do they always gotta check us like this?\" \"I have no idea.\" Vincent said. \"You guys ever go to Alaska before?\" Estelle asked Eliza. \"We filmed polar bears once.\" Eliza smiled. \"Aren't polar bears in the north?\" Akito asked. \"I guess that was the North Pole then,\" Eliza shrugged. \"Hard to say honestly, but I met the nicest polar bear once.\" \"I still find it weird that you can talk to animals.\" Debbie whispered. \"Ah, ah, don't tell anyone,\" Eliza playfully reminded. \"Or else you're gonna be a baboon for the rest of your life.\" \"I won't, I won't.\" Debbie whispered as they were now on their way inside the plane. Eliza laughed. With that, the Fudo family and the Thornberry were all now on their way to Alaska for their next big adventure all together.

The main plot will be the same but some of the dialogue and story will be slightly different. I also suggest you read Back to Fernfield first before starting this story. This is a fan made story about the Air buddies and it takes place one month after their space adventure (space buddies). After learning that their owners school has arranged a trip to Alaska the buddies and their parents decide to sneak along so they can see Shasta, their husky friend from Alaska. However commander Drex (a intergalactic warlord first introduced in Super Buddies) hears of a prophecy foretelling his defeat at the paws of 5 golden retriever puppies. So after hearing about their landing on the moon he enlists the help of 3 Raptors, who were frozen for millions of years, to destroy them. By the way I don't own any of the characters except the OC's (All the OC's are listed in my profile). Update 01/02/18. A year already. Just decided to improve the chapters starting from this one, like before main plot will be the same, dialogue and story will slightly change. In a wide open area in Alaska, beyond the white mountains in the horizon, where snow covered the ground and the landscape was surrounded by thick trees and a huge forest, a small black and white Husky was playing. He was being watched by his parent's as he ran around, enjoying himself. This was Shasta when he was only a few weeks old and when his parents were alive. This area beyond Ferntiuktuk was known as the \"lowlands\", mainly because it was a large area with a thick forest, snowy mountains and a freezing sea ahead. It's also fabled to be home to the legendary dog, known as Talon the Great. The only hazard around here is the fragile ice, below the hills. \"Shasta, we should get back to town now!\" his father, Nanook, called. \"Come on just ten more minutes?\" pleaded the adorable pup. His parents agreed, not able to resist his begging look. Shasta ran of to an area near the slippery, delicate ice, while his father began looking around, as if he was expecting something. \"Nanook, what are you looking for?\" asked his mate. \"I still believe that Talon the Great is alive and is out here somewhere\" he explained. \"And I want to find him\". While they were busy, Shasta ran of behind some huge rocks where his parents could not see him. As he ran on the ice he began slipping and eventually he fell and landed on the thin ice. It began cracking. However, instead of falling into cold water below the cracked ice revealed a hidden cave which was probably frozen for hundreds of years. The husky fell down a small ice slide before landing at the bottom. There was some deep, freezing lakes near him but other than that it was just a dark cave with ice everywhere. \"Wow this place is cool!\" he yelped, venturing deeper into the cave to explore. Shasta was an adventurous, young pup and his curiosity was similar to a cat's. It wasn't long before he ran into a cold, dark section, with a chilling sight in. Before him, was two frozen creatures which no one had ever seen before- two frozen Velociraptors! They didn't seem tall- they were only a few metres taller than his dad- the ice must have caused their growth to halt. From the looks of it, they had been frozen for millions of years. One was dark red, with a few brownish stripes, while the other was light grey and had pale grey stripes along his back. Both had sharp teeth and claws, as well as a terrifying decided to charge into the frozen figures to see if they would brake. He caused some minor bumps but after looking at their scary eyes he decided to stop. But he knew he was lost. He decided to howl a few times so they would find him. But these howls caused the icicles above to start to move. The howls echoed around the cave making them more louder. His parents stopped and listened. \"Do you hear that?\" asked Shasta's mum. \"That sounds like Shasta\" realised Nanook. \"Oh no where is he?\" \"Just follow the howls\" responded his mother, running towards the direction of the noises. The icicles fell, piercing into the top of the two frozen raptor's. Their hungry eyes began moving, staring at their surroundings, noticing the small husky walking back. They moved. They broke free. Immediately spotting Shasta, they growled, whisking the ice of their bodies. Shasta began slowly walking back, terrified. Just then a few snowballs hit the grey raptor in his eyes. it was Shasta's parents. \"What, dinosaurs in our time?!\" gasped his shocked father. \"Run Shasta!\" cried his mum, as the red raptor leaped towards him. Shasta quickly ran to his parents, making the red raptor crash into a pile of ice and rocks instead. The huskies ran towards the ice slide and prepared to climb out but they were followed by the vicious grey raptor. The predator jumped in front of them, next to the cold water. \"I don't know what kind of creatures you are but you're about to become my lunch!\" he grinned, showing his hideous, sharp teeth. \"Or we could just run; that way I'll let you live\" Nanook, jokingly replied, stalling for time. \"Ha!\" laughed the grey raptor. With no other option, Shasta's parents knew they had to fight it. As the grey raptor slowly walked towards them to try and frighten them, the mum secretly crept behind him and duct down. Nanook then hurled himself into the confused raptor trying to push him backwards. Before he could bite him, he tripped of Shasta's mum and fell into the freezing cold lake. This caused the red raptor to let out a loud, angry screech which caused the ice of the fragile cave to begin collapsing. The three husky's ran out but just when the raptor was about to grab Shasta, Nanook used his claws to scratch his eye. The huge ice rocks from the top of the cave fell covering the newly discovered area and also trapping the carnivore. \"What are raptors doing in our time?\" panted Shasta's mum. \"I'm guessing we accidentally released them\" replied Nanook. \"Hopefully they're gone now\". \"Should we tell Deputy Bernie?\" asked his mate. \"Who would believe a story like this, I don't even believe it. Now we should get back to Ferntiuktuk before our people start to worry. The husky's took their whimpering and petrified pup back to town, unknowing that high up in the mountains, Talon was watching them.[Chapter 2] Present, March 2009 (a month after the events of Space Buddies) In a distant galaxy, a menacing warship was travelling through space. Inside was commander Drex, an alien warlord who dreams of conquering his home world of Inspiron and creating his own empire. He had summoned his top ally, Death, to his command room. Death was short for his actual name (which no one knows) and he was a strange half-skeleton warrior who had a terrifying look (even his voice was creepy). He mainly used a Scythe as a weapon, however he carried two blaster's with him just in case. He wore a black robe and his hood concealed his head, all except for his scary face. \"You called, Drex.\" Drex tossed him a inter-galactic newspaper, which front cover said in bold \" ANIMAL'S LANDING ON MOON CONFIRMED TRUE\" \"I suppose you've heard that some animal's landing on some moon in some another Galaxy has just been confirmed as true\" said Drex. \"Well that was a lot of \"some's' you used in that sentence, but yes I have, in fact everywhere I go everyone is just talking about it\" replied the phantom. \"Maybe you didn't hear me, I said they were CONFIRMED TRUE. Exactly two weeks after I visited that fortune teller in the Crystal caves of Inspiron\". \"So?\" \"She told me a prophecy\" explained Drex. \"The evil dreams you crave will come undone at the paw's of five dog's who recently got fame\". I don't know what a 'dog' is, do you, I mean that's a stupid name 'dog' it doesn't even sound right\". \"Animals cannot threaten you, some are even pets to more intelligent beings\" stated Death. \"Maybe it's MONK-E, let's kill MONK-E\". \"Do not joke, Death!\" yelled Drex. \"It was confirmed EXACTLY two weeks later, that cannot be a coincidence. I bet that's why they were in space in the first place, to look for me\". \"So if I'm reading you right, you want me to fly around the Galaxy, hoping I bump into a group of random puppies that I've never seen before in my life and destroy them, without them seeing me? Oh and also I have under a month to do it\" \"I'm sure a commander of your statue can find and terminate them!\" Death went out the room thinking. I've only ever been to one planet that has animals with paw's. Later Death travelled to the meeting room where he met MONK-E, Drex's monkey assistant. \"Have you got the information I asked for?\" \"Yep it's all right here, information on the poopies that Blade collected when he went to Earth, using his Spy bugs\" replied MONK-E. \"Poopies? You mean puppies\" Death corrected him. \"Nah it's definitely poopies\" rejected MONK-E. \"Blade told me about his Earth visit, said he found some interesting stuff about these puppies that was beyond anything he's ever seen\" remembered Death, purposely missing out the part about Blade persuading Rosebud to convince her siblings to go back to Alaska. \"Now lets begin\" MONK-E hoped on the table, where five pictures of the Buddies were laid out. \"They call themselves the Air buddies or just the Buddies, and believe me Blade was right, they have done a lot more than go into space\". He spread the pictures out and began introducing them in order of youngest to oldest. \"This one with the pink bow is called Rosebud, the youngest and only girl of the litter. She loves football and is apparently quite feisty\" \"That doesn't even look threatening!\" laughed the spectre. \"Please try and save all your remarks till I finish the presentation I spent a long time on this\" demanded MONK-E, continuing. \"This one is Mudbud and he- \"Yuck he is filthy!\" cried the Red armoured guard. \"Is that mud or...ew that thing should be thrown outside\". \"Hey I'm giving the presentation shut up!\" snapped MONK-E. \"Yeah their just a bunch of animals, no different than MONK-E\" added Death. \"We don't go rolling in our own filth, except for MONK-E\" said the guard. \"Anyway Mudbud is the dirty dude who loves dirt, as you noticed, and volleyball\" continued MONK-E. \"B-dawg, who is into hip-hop rapping and dancing, although it appears his cool talk is a cover up for how much of a chicken he is. Buddha is a Zen pup, I'm not sure what that is but since he meditates a lot and talks wisely I'm assuming it's some Earth religion.\" \"Where I come from we have a religion where you jump into a volcano\" commented the guard. \"Yeah, I actually don't care\" replied the spectre. \"Lastly is Budderball who just keeps eating, however he does have a secret weapon his butt. You see if you pull his paw he releases- \"Ok skip this bit!\" Death interrupted predicting what MONK-E was going to say. \"Right\" he continued. \"And that's not all, their dad is the famous Air bud, known for playing multiple sports against humans, and winning!\" \"How can a mutt play sport!\" cried the phantom. Death then took out a robot bug from his pocket which jumped on the table and scanned the five pictures. \"Why are they called Air buddies?\" asked the guard. \"Are they friends with the air or is because they can fly, or is the name 'Buddies' just a metaphor for some sort of criminal gang?\" \"Weren't you paying attention I just said their dad is- began MONK-E. \"Blade said they live in a country called USA in Fernfield, Washington\" interrupted Death. Exo-striker, the bug, then vanished. \"Exo-striker will travel to this location and find the dogs so we can find a chance to strike the only problem is we can't be seen by anyone \" he explained. \"Maybe you can do it secretly\" suggested MONK-E. \"But I can't take the risk of them escaping they will tell everyone of our existence\" argued Death. \"Can you pleeeeeeaaaaaasssseeee take me with you!\" begged MONK-E, who loved exploration. \"No\" rejected the phantom. \"Great when are we leaving?\" asked the anxious guard, who didn't want to around his ungrateful leader all the time. \"Not 'we', just me. This is a solo mission\". \"Fine I never do anything around here anyway, I just play with these weird toys\" grumbled the guard, picking up one of Drex's weapons, accidentally zapping himself. \"I do have one question, why aren't we telling Drex about Earth i'm sure he would want that to be part of his future empire?\" \"Cause I don't know it's co-ordinates from space, only the one's of the area I always teleport to on the surface. Also Drex rushes things, we need to take our time and know our enemy, that's why I've told MONK-E to do some Earth research\" replied Death. \"Anyway i'm going to think of a way I can eliminate them without being seen\". \"Make sure to be careful\" advised the guard. \"Careful?\" Death sarcastically replied. \"There just animals, what harm could they possibly do?\"[Chapter 3] In the Buddies hometown, Fernfield, the puppies owners were getting ready for school but first they had to ask their parents to sign a permission slip for a three day trip to Alaska. The school had arranged it because of their Geography work on cold areas. At first the parents were nervous about this idea but later agreed. After the Buddies trip to the moon they had reporters flocking to their homes for two weeks. After their kids left for school, the puppies ran to the park to meet up. While running, B-dawg stopped next to the pet shop (the same area which the Buddies noticed Budderball was missing in Air buddies). He saw a man sitting on a bench with a radio next to him and a trash can that was leaning against the wall. There was also a few scrunched up paper balls on the ground. When the man went into the shop, B-dawg seized the moment. \"It's time for the B-dawg to practise his moves\" he announced before going to the radio and putting on some music. It played the song \"Into the fire\" by Thirteen Senses. B-dawg used his paws and nuzzle to throw them all straight in the bin. \"Nothing but net!\" the self-centred pup boasted, using his favourite slang words. \"Hey\" said an unknown voice, startling B-dawg. \"Did you just do those sick shots?\" \"Who said that?\" replied B-dawg. A female golden retriever puppy came out from the alley. She wore two blue bows on her ears, similar to Rosebud's pink bow. \"Yo who are you i'v never seen you around here before?\" asked B-dawg. \"Oh i'm new in this town, my people just moved in a few days ago\" she explained before noticing his shiny bling. \"Hey, I know this is kind of a nosy question, but are you one of those Air buddies which went to the moon?\" \"Me, yeah I am i'm B-dawg the coolest pup around\" he boasted. \"Well I guess those skills you just did were kinda cool\" she admitted. \"I'm Bell, you must be really brave to go in to space, i'm guessing it was a scary experience\". \"Pshaw B-dawg is all about the spooky stuff\" B-dawg gloated before starting to turn red. \"Wait did you call me brave?\" That's something which no one calls him because they know him well. Buddha was running past when he noticed his brother and decided to wait for him by the bushes. Unknown to B-dawg, Exo-striker had attached himself to the back of his bling. \"Jeez, is he working on an audition for a movie\" tutted Exo-Striker. Luckily B-dawg couldn't hear the tiny creature's words. \"Now I'm er late for a meeting with my fam, gotta go!\" the nervous pup said, running of. Buddha caught up with him. \"Who was that B-dawg, your girlfriend?\" he teased. \"She's just some new girl in town\" denied B-dawg. \"Anyway let's head to the park, were gonna be late!\" The five puppies met in the park. Mudbud had arrived late. \"Sorry dudes and dudette, Pete's mum was signing his permission slip\". \"Wow I cant believe the school is taking them to Alaska for three days!\" exclaimed Budderball. \"Remember when we went to Alaska we made new friends and accomplished new goals\" Buddha reminded them. \"Guy's i'v been thinking that its been two years since we last saw Shasta, maybe we could go along with our kids\" suggested Rosebud. She bought a copy of the trip letter and put it on the ground. \"See look it says there staying at Ferntiuktuk\". \"No pets allowed, plus how we gonna sneak on to a plane dawg?\" said B-dawg. B-dawg usually ends his sentences with the word \"dawg\". \"Well we snuck on to a spaceship, an ice-cream van and a school bus it'll be easy we just need to hide in the cargo area\" she replied. \"Well I do miss Shasta and it will be easy to just stay in a cargo bay\" said Buddha. \"Lets take a vote, if you agree with Rosebud's idea say aye\" suggested Mudbud. They all ended up agreeing but then noticed a dilemma. Their parents, Buddy and Molly, will be worried if they do something like that. However, as it turned out, while they were trying to convince their mum, Molly, Buddy had exciting news for them. It seemed like the legendary Air bud was invited to go along with Noah, after it was discovered that it was his puppies that won the dog sled race. It also appeared Buddy had been interested in dog sled racing, since his puppies talked about it non-stop since they came back from Alaska. Buddy decided that since he will be there to supervise his pup's, the Buddies and Molly could sneak along. \"Alright you guys better get home to your kids, we got a big day tomorrow\" advised the famous sports playing dog. The Buddies ran back to their separate homes, unknowing that they had fallen into the trap of the shadow- orchestrated by Dark Blade and Death. Death paced around the room, waiting. \"What's taking him so long we programmed the town name and coordinates in his hard drive before he left\" he wondered. \"Be patient, Death i'm sure he's almost there\" the guard assured him. Suddenly the projector turned on, showing a video recording Exo striker was taking and broadcasting to them. \"What took you so long!?\" shouted Death. \"You try flying around some random town looking for five dogs and a place to attach yourself!\" he sternly replied. \"Anyway I am on the one known as B-dawg's bling\". \"When you find an opportunity to strike tell us immediately\" ordered MONK-E. \"But if I go there to attack them, they might tell the humans\" realised the guard. \"Do animals have the same IQ as humans because i'm pretty sure they can't speak to them?\" asked Death. \"I can't be the only one who thinks that sounds ridiculous. Heh, that's a pun\". \"No they can't but i'm still studying their abilities so far I'v found hobbies like drinking from toilets and chasing their tails\" replied MONK-E, noticing the the guard putting his hand over his covered face. \"Got anything to add?\" \"Yes,that this a complete waste of our time! That fortune teller has been watching to much daytime television, how can they possibly pose a threat to Drex!\" \"Exo striker make sure to keep an eye on every thing they do so we can find an opportunity\" ordered Death. The broadcast went off. Drex then came in. \"Death, your allies say they need you back soon\" he told him. \"Maybe you can send someone else on this mission\". \"Don't worry this wont take long\" Death re-assured his leader. MONK-E hopped on Death's shoulder and whispered something to him. \"I'v analysed a conversation the poopies had while Exo-striker was broadcasting and I'v heard one word that keeps coming up, 'Alaska' \". Death then remembered something he saw on Earth that might help him. The skeleton commander thought of a scheme that just might work.[Chapter 4] In Billy's bedroom, B-dawg was sound asleep in his small doggie bed that Billy had bought for him. Exo-striker was still on the back of B-dawg's bling and the robots eyes turned from red to green. On board Drex's ship, Death was preparing to activate the dream machine to enter B-dawg's dream. \"I do not think pets get the privilege of going on school trips with their owner\" assumed MONK-E. But he was actually right. They were also going over all the information on the Buddies. \"Wow this is amazing!\" admitted Death, amazed at the list of the Buddies accomplishments. \"Winning a race, freezing cold conditions, snow storm, against big adult dogs, rescuing their parents, saving a astronaut in space, wow this is incredible! You're right about that, MONK-E, but I just got a brilliant idea: they can sneak aboard to go with their owners because they will want to see this Shasta person\". Of course the sneaky phantom didn't come up with this plan himself but he wanted to pretend he did. \"Alright the dream machine is active; Exo-striker is still attached to B-dawg; everything is good to go\" the guard informed them, finishing up the set up of the machine. \"It's a good thing we stole this from Inspiron before we lost the war\" noted the spooky spectre. \"Now, it's time for me to enter this pup's dream and put MY brilliant plan into action\". B-dawg saw darkness all around him. \"Whoa, what's this place?\" he wondered. He began walking forward but there was nothing but everything around him was pitch black, like he was stuck in a void of darkness. The frightened puppy then thought he could hear voices. \"I'm scared of the dark\" he gulped. As he walked further, he could hear the voices louder. One asking \"did it work?\" and another replying \"of course it did I can see him from here!\" \"Wait why are you two here!?\" \"Maybe next time warn us to stand back, what you think we know everything about everything?\" \"Yo who are you dawg's?\" asked B-dawg, nervously. \"I should warn you I float like a butterfly and sting like a bee!\" \"Shh he's here!\" hissed Death. \"I want a glass of water\" moaned the guard. \"Stop it with the nonsense...wait why do you want water?\" \"Guess who is forced to wear this armour, it's hot enough without being zapped by some Star Trek looking thing\". \"If you don't shut up I'm gonna tell Drex you said he looks like a balloon merged together with a pea!\" threatened MONK-E. \"Please do, maybe he'll finally fire me\". \"Yo are you g-g-g-ghosts!\" stammered B-dawg. \"Of course not B-dawg, of the Air buddies or should I say the coolest rapping pup alive\" greeted Death, trying to make him feel more relaxed. \"Fo'shizzle dawg, I am the best!\" agreed the pup, using more of his favourite slang words. \"Now who are you dawg's?\" \"Don't worry this is a sort of...vision...a helpful vision...that helps you\" commented MONK-E. \"We're very nice definitely not real things\". \"Yeah we're real nice\" said the guard sarcastically. \"Let's all forget how you 'nicely' blackmailed me?\" \"You know your starting to be annoying, just shut up!\" yelled MONK-E, contradicting what he just said about them being nice. \"I mean were very nice, so what's up with Alaska, huh it's very nice to visit?\" Death put his hand over his skeleton face and muttered \"I hate all of you\". \"My brother told me that you can get visions which warn you of things in your dreams\" said B-dawg. \"Your brother, Rosebud, sounds very wise\" complimented MONK-E, forgetting that Rosebud was the girl. B-dawg looked confused when he said this. \"I meant MudDog.. or BudderRose\". \"What he means to say is we are hear to give you tips of your trip to Alaska\" interrupted Death. \"It's simple in ant out; stay in the cargo bay until you land; stay out of sight and of course have fun with your friend. Lastly, and most importantly, do NOT bump into your class. Find an area where most of that race took place its very good this time of year it kinda looks like a crater but with snowy hills surrounding the middle, they won't see you there\". \"Oh sounds simple, thanks\" thanked B-dawg, before starting to doubt them. \"Wait if your visions then why did the red thing want water, and why did he know what Star Trek is and why do you look so evil?\" \"Death how do we get out of here?\" the guard whispered. \"When he wakes up\" he replied, before turning to B-dawg. \"Anyway time for us to go so sorry i'm gonna have to do this. Actually no i'm not, this is the fun part\". \"Wait do what?\" B-dawg nervously asked. Death jump-scared him, causing him to wake up. B-dawg looked around Billy's room, panting. He eventually cuddled back up in his bed and fell asleep. Death and the others returned from the dream as well, laughing. \"HA balloon merged with a pea\" laughed the guard before turning around and bumping into Drex. \"Oh hi sir\". \"Great now all we need to do is think of a way to attack them without being seen\" cheered a relieved Drex. \"We need someone who is strong, stealthy and can stay close to them. Death was boastfully pointing to himself in the background.I don't mean you, Death, don't get happy\". \"Perhaps using other animals to get to them will be a good idea, they will know the place more better than us\" suggested MONK-E. \"Are you familiar with the creatures called Dinosaurs, which went extinct millions of years ago?\" asked the phantom. The others (except Drex) nodded. \"Well in the...place their going me and Blade saw this raptor called Razer who was trapped in a cave and freed him, apparently some pup brang him back to life\" he explained. \"He should be grateful to that dog- began the guard. \"No you see they are outcasts they don't fit in this time, they have to stay hidden their whole lives depending on us to bring them food so they owe us a lot\" \"They?\" \"He found these two other frozen raptors in the cave and freed them to\" finished the ghoul. \"And why would that work?\" demanded Drex. \"Apparently they won some hard race, I'm sure they are talked about everywhere Razer has to have heard of them, and according to Exo-striker they are heading there tomorrow!\" explained the creepy phantom. Exo-striker had analysed the letter Rosebud dropped, working out their owners were going on a trip to Alaska. \"Very well go and tell these creatures, but make sure to be back when you need to\" ordered Drex. \"Go and destroy them before they destroy me!\" The next day Sam, Pete, Billy, Alice and Bartleby met up with Noah and Henry on the school bus with the Buddies secretly outside, hiding in the bushes. \"Remember what I said, airports are busy places so stay close\" said Molly. She saw her husband enter the school bus, with Noah (and also the teacher sneezing). \"Yes Mum\" they all replied. \"Dude's this is so exciting\" cheered Mudbud. \"All right, we just need to head to the air port, follow the class and hide in the cargo place of the plane until we land\" explained Molly. \"Yuck, air port food is gross!\" whined Budderball. \"Chill dude were not going there to eat we need to be sneaky\" Mudbud reminded him.[Chapter 5] In the school bus the kids were excited. \"I can't wait to go to Alaska\" cried Pete. \"I just hope the Buddies will be ok this time\" said a worried Sam, remembering how they sneaked along and got lost in space. \"Don't worry this time Molly's gonna be watching them\" Henry assured them. Buddy barked in agreement. He hated worrying the kid's like that. But how else would the Buddies grow, he didn't want them to end up like he did; locked up in a cage and forced to be a circus dog to an abusive clown. \"I still can't believe it was OUR puppies that won that race against grown ups\" remembered Bartleby. \"I remember seeing it on the news for the first time, I was shocked!\" \"Do you think we'll meet the boy who was their musher?\" wondered Alice. \"Probably not, it's still school for everyone else\" said Noah. \"If we do though, I'm giving that dawg maximum respect\" promised Billy, who talked similarly to his puppy. The teacher then began explaining (for the third time) how they should behave at the airport. The bus began driving with the golden retrievers following. Buddy barked at them from the back window. \"Last one there smells like Budderball's farts!\" challenged Mudbud. \"Oh it's on now!\" replied B-dawg. \"Buddies, there's no need to rush remember we need to stay hidden\" Molly reminded them. When they finally arrived the kids and teachers went inside while the six golden dogs arrived later. The airport was busy and packed with people buying stuff and preparing to board their planes. Although because it wasn't school holidays it wasn't as rushed. Budderball spied a nearby fast food shop and ran to it. Rosebud followed her greedy brother before he caused trouble. \"Oh sweet mamma, hot dogs\" he drooled, as the owner served a woman. \"Budderball what do you think your doing?\" scolded Rosebud. \"I know I said airport food is gross but better safe than sorry\" replied the chubbiest of the Buddies, as he grabbed one of the hot dogs the man left on the counter. As the man began searching for it, the golden dogs ran outside where the planes were stationed. \"Hmm now where is it\" thought Molly. \"NOW BOARDING FLIGHT 12 TO ALASKA\" boomed the loudspeaker. \"Over there I can see our class going in that plane!\" discovered Mudbud, pointing to flight 12. \"Ok follow me to the cargo hold\" Molly told them. The dogs ran inside while the two workers were distracted. \"So how's life?\" asked one, trying to be polite. \"What kind of question is that, our lives are horrible!\" replied the large man. \"Sorry, just trying to start polite conversation!\" They closed the doors of the cargo hold, It was dark but there was still enough light to look around. \"Hey I could use some help here!\" called Buddy, as he was forced to be stuck in a medium sized cage. Molly released him from his cage. \"I heard the teacher's saying the workers are supposed to drop me of at the hotel, so that'll give us plenty of time to play\". Rosebud went over to an open bag with clothes falling out. \"Wow these colours are amazing\" she noticed. \"Er dawgs can I ask you somethin'?\" asked B-dawg to his family. \"Yes dear what is it?\" asked his mother. \"Well...I had a dream which seemed very real, some things started giving me tips on what to do, but they seemed so...creepy..not that I was scared\" he explained, anxiously. \"They said they were visions\". \"Some dreams have a deeper meaning; to warn you or help you in your journey\" Buddha explained, who is very spiritual. \"Try not to get worried over it, it will ruin your trip\" said his father. \"Anyway are you guys ready to go to Alaska?\" \"YEAH\" they all replied. The plane took off and began heading towards \"the great white north\". Meanwhile in the \"Lowlands\" of Alaska, was a huge dark caves, surrounded by huge rocks. Death teleported outside it and walked in. He was confronted by three raptors. Razer still had a scar across his eye from Nanook. Deceptor was a clumsy, dark blue raptor while Slasher was a mean, green raptor. \"Well this is an unexpected visit, we still have the supply of food you gave us\" said Razer. \"Yes and like we have done for the last year, we will continue to send food so you don't have to risk revealing yourselves to get some. Now, your services are required\" said the phantom. \"Doing what?\" growled Slasher. \"I have reliable Intel that the five golden puppies that won that race with that husky are returning to Alaska, they pose a threat to my ally, he wants them extinguished\" explained Death. \"Did you just say puppies and threat\" laughed Deceptor. \"Am I the only one laughing?\" \"Trust me you will not believe the things they have done\". \"I remember seeing the harsh weather conditions on that day and I still cant believe 6 small puppies beat grown dogs and humans\" retorted Razer. \"Your right, we do ow you big, we'll do it\". \"Yeah and how exactly are we supposed to find them?\" huffed Slasher. \"My spy, Exo-striker, is tracking them, this scanner will beep once their close\" said Death, throwing a small radar on the ground. \"This will beep once they are near so don't break it with your clumsy claws; don't touch it, don't even look at it!\" \"Then how will we know- began Deceptor. But Death teleported away, leaving behind purple mist in the area he departed from. \"I still think it's creepy when he does that\" admitted Razer. \"Anyway when that thing starts beeping, the hunt is on!\"[Chapter 6] When the plane landed in the cold town of Ferntiuktuk, the kids and teachers rushed outside and in to the town. \"Ok first of all we are going to get checked into the hotel and then you can choose your group then we can play in the snow!\" explained the teacher. The kids cheered as they followed her into town. The Buddies sneakily ran outside while the teachers were unloading the bags and prepared to take them to the hotel. \"Snow! I haven't seen this stuff in ages!\" shouted Budderball. \"Aw man I forgot to bring a dirt bag now i'm probably gonna get clean again\" worried Mudbud remembering how clean the snow made him last time. A snowball then landed in B-dawg's face. B-dawg turned around to see his laughing dad. \"Its on now\" announced B-dawg. The golden puppies then began a having a snow ball fight, although Mudbud tried avoiding it so he would stay clean. After playing in the snow the dogs rushed past the welcome sign and went into town. \"Hey its Deputy Bernie outside the sheriff's office!\" spotted Rosebud. \"Wow I can't believe he's a deputy and a Saint\" said Buddha, who still believed deputy Bernie was actually a saint. They ran up towards the office where the Saint Bernard dog was laying outside. Beside him was Francois and Philippe who were sleeping. They were waiting for their owner to come out of Joe's shop. \"Deputy Bernie wake up!\" shouted Buddy. \"Hello again, Deputy, do you remember us?\" \"What am I dreaming?!\" he exclaimed, not believing what he was seeing. \"The Buddies you came back after all this time! Wait how did you get here?\" \"Our kids were on a school trip so we decided to come along to see our old friends\" explained Molly. \"Oh yeah, I saw those kids pass by earlier\" Bernie stated. \"So how are you, Buddies?\" \"Were of the chain insane\" said B-dawg. \"Thats B-dawg's way of saying were fine\" said Rosebud. \"Well you have come along way, literally. First being the first puppies to win a dog sled race then going to the moon\" replied Bernie. Francois then woke up. \"Huh?\" he began. \"I don't believe it, it is those d'or puppies. D'or is French for golden. \"Philippe wake up!\" The brownish husky then woke up. \"Look its those puppies who saved our lives all that time ago!\" he pointed out. \"You have come back!\" Philippe cried. \"So how's your dog sled racing going, pretty awesome right?\" asked Mudbud. \"Um well yes and no\" answered Francois. \"You see after you were all over the news for becoming the first puppies and boy to win a dog sled race in that horrible storm everyone began doing the sport in the lowlands, the area where most of the race took place\" \"That doesn't sound so bad, we get fame everywhere!\" gloated B-dawg. \"Well it was fine until a few months ago when dogs, of all different breed, began vanishing and some even ran back screaming, refusing to come back and unable to explain what they'v seen. The one's which did talk spoke of a monster\" explained Bernie. \"The humans believe the lowlands are cursed!\" finished Philippe. \"So h-has the people ever seen these monsters?\" asked a nervous B-dawg. \"Not that i'm scared or anything\". \"Only our owner, Jean George, has seen it but no one believes him which is why he has made it his mission to trap it so dog sled racing can continue\" said Francois. \"Wait you guys went back to that mean man?\" asked a confused Rosebud, who remembered how he abandoned them when they fell beneath the ice. \"Well he did start treating us a bit better besides we don't have any other owners, although he's still looking for a full team\" replied Francois. \"Yikes, that story was terrifying!\" exclaimed Buddy. \"Now where's that husky friend you wanted to see?\" \"Do you guys know where Shasta is?\" Budderball asked Bernie. \"He should playing on the outskirts of town, he goes there a lot now since Adam broke his arm and is unable to play with him\" Bernie told them. \"Alright, dears, we'll meet you out here when your finished playing and make sure the class doesn't see you\" advised Molly. The Buddies ran towards the entrance of the town. When they past Joe's shop, Jean George came out and noticed them. \"AH!\" he shrieked trying to avoid the puppies only to fall over and land on the snowy ground. \"Golden retrievers in Alaska? Oh no its you, so you'v come back after all this time but how?\" he growled. \"Those little children of course. Well you wont get the better of me this time!\". Jean's friend, Paul, ran over to help him up just as the Buddies took of. \"Are you ok, Jean?\" asked the concerned man. \"Yes Paul, you will not believe it those 5 golden retriever puppies who beat me in the race are back!\" he cried. \"Were they green, scary puppies with sharp teeth?\" Paul sarcastically taunted causing Jean George to push him out the way. \"When I capture it you will all thank me, i'v already put traps in the lowlands\" Jean bellowed. He marched back in the shop and Paul followed him. When the Buddies got to the outskirts, the same area where they first met Shasta, they looked around. \"Yo I don't know what those old dogs were talking about he's still mean\" said B-dawg. \"Maybe they see something in him we don't\" suggested Buddha. \"But whatever they see I definitely can't see it\". \"Now where is Shasta?\" wondered Rosebud, who missed their husky friend a lot. \"Sounds like someone has a crush\" teased Budderball. \"Well you did say when we came back you think he's super cute and you really like his blue eyes\". \"Rosebud and Shasta sitting in a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-G!\" laughed Mudbud. \"Guys, shut up!\" shouted Rosebud. \"You'd better not say that in front of him!\" \"Hey there he is!\" yelled Buddha, noticing a small husky pup running towards the same area where he was first spying on them in Snow buddies. \"Maybe we should surprise him in the same way he did to us\" suggested Mudbud. \"Yeah he'll be all like 'wow its my favourite posse' let's go dawgs!\" agreed B-dawg.[Chapter 7] Shasta was running past the same area where he first spotted the Buddies. This area reminded him of them so he would come here often. The Buddies were hiding behind the hill, the same hill Shasta was using to spy on them when he first saw them. The husky turned around to see Buddha looking at him before vanishing. \"Huh? I could have sworn that was a golden retriever\" he thought. Budderball then did the same thing. \"What no it can't be!\" Shasta said to himself. Finally Mudbud repeated what his brothers did. Shasta shuddered and then blinked a few times. He ran up the hill to look around. Suddenly the five puppies jumped out and scared him. \"BOO!\" they all yelled. \"What guys is it really you!? Is this real!?\" Shasta asked. \"As real as the snow is white\" answered Buddha. \"Yo whats crack-a-lackin Shasta I know you missed me and my bling\" said B-dawg. \"Wow I don't believe it this is awesome!\" shouted the husky, he was so excited he started chasing his tail. \"That's still funny\" giggled Rosebud. \"Wait how'd you get here, did you fall from the sky again?\" \"No our kids and their class are on a field trip here for three days so we snuck on the plane to see you\" \"Well, Rosebud was also saying that- started Mudbud. \"MUDBUD!\" she shouted. \"Just kidding I wasn't gonna tell\" he laughed. \"Oh yeah the field trip from Washington, I completely forgot about that\" Shasta remembered. \"We heard about what happened to Adam is he ok?\" asked a concerned Budderball. \"Yeah he should be coming back from the hospital tomorrow\" replied Shasta. \"So i'm sure your pretty famous around here\" guessed Buddha. \"Yeah dog sled racing was awesome until a few months ago I know this may seem hard to believe but a green monster with a long tail, sharp teeth and claws just began scaring all the dogs away\" he explained. \"Yeah we heard about that has anyone apart from Jean George seen it\" wondered Rosebud. \"Well I actually saw him once, his name is Slasher, and I spotted him in the lowlands while Adam was in school. He was so fast but eventually I escaped him\" exclaimed Shasta. \"So you guys have a place to stay or something?\" \"Our kids are staying in a hotel we were hoping if we could hide in your shed again if that ok\" said Buddha. \"Ok that's fine. That reminds me are your parents here too?\" asked Shasta with a worried expression on his face. \"Yeah why?\" asked B-dawg. \"It's just Jean George doesn't have a complete team yet and since we won in the race he's been interested in golden retrievers so he might try and steal them! Don't worry i'll see if I can find them just stay around here\" When Shasta ran of, B-dawg told the others about his dream, where Death told him a good place to have fun. \"Let's go check this place out\" Rosebud agreed with B-dawg. \"Is there any snacks there i'm starving?\" groaned Budderball. \"You never know how deep a puddle is until you jump in it\" advised Buddha. The puppies ran of to this area, following B-dawg. Unknown to them they had found there way into \"the low lands\". There were lots of familiar areas such as parts of the race course. \"Hey I totally remember this place\" shouted Mudbud. They spotted a large crater shaped area, surrounded by snowy hills, where they decided to play. \"Yep this is the place!\" declared B-dawg. Slasher meanwhile had smelt them and began walking towards their direction. After Deputy Bernie told Shasta that the Buddies parents had said their gonna wait for them somewhere else because the school was walking past, he decided to go back. But when he did, he saw they weren't there. He saw puppy prints heading towards the low lands. \"But that leads to the...oh no\" gasped Shasta, realising where they had gone. Budderball had fallen down the hill and crashed at the bottom. The others went down to him. But it was now when they heard a soft growl. \"Budderball are you hungry already?\" asked Rosebud. \"Hey that was not me\" he denied. The growl came again, louder this time. \"Dude warn us if your about to let one rip\" complained Mudbud. \"Hey why do you guys always suspect me?\" Buddhas ears perked. \"I sense we are not alone\". \"G-g-guys you don't think it's the monster?\" stammered B-dawg. \"B-dawg your a scaredy cat\" taunted Rosebud. \"Er dudette if you look up you will also be scared!\" whispered Mudbud. They looked up to see the menacing raptor standing on top of the hills looking below him. \"That must be the puppies Death talked about\" the raptor realised. \"I-Is that th-the monster!?\" shivered B-dawg. None of them moved, they were all to frightened to move. Slasher roared and charged down the hill. The Buddies ran up, trying to get escape. Slasher raced up the going for Budderball, the slowest. \"Help he's on my tail!\" he yelled. Just then a giant snowball was thrown into the raptor causing him to fall down. \"Buddies run!\" Shasta called to them, who was at the top of the hill. \"Quickly I know a way to escape follow me\" ordered the husky. The others followed him. \"It's that husky puppy which helped them, but he never comes here\" Slasher said to himself. Meanwhile Razor and Deceptor were in the cave and noticed the beeper was making noises. \"Ah-ha they must be close!\" realised Deceptor. \"Don't worry Slasher is taking the first patrol if their close he'll get em\" said Razor. \"I just wish that husky would come too\". Deceptor noticed Razor had began getting a bit angry. \"I know you hate him for what him and his parents did but don't let that get in the way of our mission\". The puppies had ran to the area which was part of the race course, followed by the green raptor. Slasher jumped in front of them, causing them to disperse. They hid in a large cave system, which was to big for Slasher to get into. Shasta led them through the cave and out the other side, which was a few metres from his house. \"Yikes what was that?\" panted Rosebud. \"I'll try to explain...when we get to my place\" huffed Shasta, as he led the Buddies to his house.[Chapter 8] In Ferntiuktuk Jean George and Paul were at Adam's dad's shop, looking for more traps. \"I'm telling you your wasting money on this stuff is not going to help re-start dog sled racing\" Paul informed him. \"Also raptors are NOT around anymore!\" \"How could you talk like that at a time like this!?\" he cried. \"Listen you idiot, I am the only one who has seen what's out there and you think i'm lying, why do you think all the dogs are scared of that area? It may have fooled everyone else but it can't fool me, I went to community college\". \"And what's that supposed to mean?\" They went to the cash register and put a steel trap on the counter. \"I don't think some pieces of metal will help\" said Paul, quietly. \"Your an idiot you know that\" Jean rudely replied. \"Well at least I never lost to a boy and a bunch of puppies\" he taunted back. \"Ok is that all?\" asked Adam's dad, Joe, who couldn't help but to smirk knowing it was his son who beat him. \"Yes\" replied Jean, taking the the box and leaving. Meanwhile Shasta and the Buddies went back to Adam's shed and crawled in through the hole at the side. It looked pretty much the same, only a lot of stuff had been moved out of the shed. \"Dude that was close\" panted Mudbud. \"What was that thing?\" \"I saw Sam doing homework on those creatures\" Buddha explained. \"Their called Dinosaurs, they lived on Earth millions of years ago but went extinct. Those are Raptors\" \"Y-you mean that s-scary thing was a raptor\" yelped B-dawg (nervous as usual). \"I saw a trailer for a movie with those scary things in!\" \"Alright Buddies, we should start looking for your parents so we can warn them about Jean George, or should I say Space buddies?\" Shasta chortled, calling them by the title Pi gave them. \"You heard about that?\" said Rosebud. \"I remember seeing it on the news, everyone was talking about it, we knew it was you guys\" he replied. \"You got any thing to eat?\" asked Budderball. He spotted an open bag of dog food and ran towards it. Exo-striker's circuits had been frozen solid and it fell of B-dawg's bling. Budderball, thinking it was dog food, bit into it only to break Death's spy and hurt his teeth. \"OW!\" he yelled. \"That must have been stale food. \"Can you tell us how you saw that raptor?\" pleaded Buddha. \"Ok, its story time\" answered Shasta. \"Is it gonna be a horror story not that it would frighten me I just think you dawgs would be scared\" boasted B-dawg. Back on the medium sized hill, where Buddy and Molly were trapped, the dogs were discussing what to do. \"Maybe if we howl more louder the pups will hear us or Deputy Bernie\" thought Buddy. \"Ok lets give it a go\" Molly agreed. They both howled loudly a few times. \"This thing is broken, look its turned all grey\" Deceptor pointed out. The beeper had gone off because Exo-striker was destroyed. \"Now how do we find those-\" Started Razor. \"Wait do you hear that?\" \"I do it could be them!\" cried an excited Deceptor. The two raptors ran of in the direction of the howls. Slasher heard it and followed it as well. Razor and Deceptor pounced on the hill, spotting both golden retrievers. Buddy and Molly screamed. \"It looks like these dogs were caught in that human's trap!\" noted Razor. \"Huh, i'v never seen these dogs before\" said Deceptor. \"Do you see what i'm seeing\" Buddy whispered. Molly nodded. Slasher then appeared looking annoyed. \"What took you so long?\" demanded Razor. \"They were right there I had them and they escaped then they threw a giant snowball at me!\" he growled. \"They? They? Who are they?!\" Snarled Razor \"Five golden retriever puppies and one Alaskan husky puppy, i'm sure their the ones Death told us about, the one's who won the race\" \"But that husky never come's here ever since you scared him off, hm this is an added bonus\" Razor then turned to the parents. \"I'm guessing you are their parents, I have got a amazing plan, the pups will have to come looking for the parents eventually and when they do we'll get them!\" \"Did you dawgs hear that?\" whimpered B-dawg, who was hiding behind a box after Shasta told his story. \"Wow Shasta you must have been so brave to escape-\" started Rosebud. \"Huh? Oh yeah I heard it to\" \"It sounded like Mum and Dad\" realised Mudbud. \"Well let's go to them before Jean George does\" advised Shasta before they all ran in the direction of the howls. They arrived below the hill, next to a small mountain. \"I can see them!\" said Budderball. \"Lets go!\" cried Buddha. They ran up towards the hill, but couldn't hear Molly and Buddy saying \"Go\" and \"Run\" \"All right lets go!\" ordered Slasher. \"Wait they haven't got up the hill yet-\" said Razor. The other two ignored Razor and jumped up anyway, growling at the pups, and causing all 6 to stop. \"There's three of them!\" yelled B-dawg. \"Run, Buddies run!\" shouted their parents. \"You don't need to tell me twice\" yelled B-dawg running back down, followed by the others. \"You fools, I said wait!\" shouted Razer. \"We should split up they can't catch us all\" suggested Rosebud. Mudbud and Budderball ran towards the forest, Buddha and B-dawg ran towards the hills and Rosebud and Shasta ran behind the mountain. \"Well it's time for us to split up to\" decided Razer. \"That golden colour makes them look more delicious!\" said Deceptor, drooling at the thought. \"And that husky looks delicious to I get that one!\" declared Slasher. \"No!\" yelled Razor. \"That one's mine!\" \"Huh?\" they both replied. \"Remember the tale I told you of how me and Claw were brang into this world again and now we are stuck hiding in this era?\" Both raptors nodded. \"Well that's the puppy which freed us and whose parents killed Claw I want revenge and with his parents gone he's the next best thing to target\" \"But how do you know that's him?\" asked Slasher. \"Because he's the same pup who lead the other five in that big race and he's with them now so it's obvious it's him\" replied Razor. \"Deceptor go after the scared pup and that other one, Slasher head to the forest\". Slasher and Deceptor ran after them. \"Please don't hurt them we'll give you anything!\" pleaded Molly. Razor ignored and jumped down the hill, only to fall over and land in the snow. I'v got to work on that landing he thought before getting up and running in the direction Rosebud and Shasta were.[Chapter 9] Budderball and Mudbud were running through the forest. \"Dude there's nothing but tree's here\" said Mudbud. \"Oh sweet mamma I can smell stake and fried egg\" smiled Budderball. \"Follow me, where there's food there's people\" Slasher was running in the woods to but because of the height of the tree's, and being frozen stopped his growing, he couldn't jump over any of them. The two golden puppies found a log cabin in the woods. \"A log cabin?\" said a surprised Mudbud. \"What's that doing out here?\" \"Hey the food's inside but I can't get to it, it's my worst nightmare!\" cried Budderball. Slasher then jumped on top of the small house,landing on the roof. \"Ah ha\" he snarled. \"I'v got you in my sights!\" Mudbud spotted a small cave nearby. \"Quick in there!\" he yelled. Both of them narrowly escaped the raptor by hiding in the cave, which Slasher couldn't fit in. However he then began using his claws to try and make the cave bigger. \"Desperate times call for desperate measures\" Mudbud groaned. \"Budderball turn around\" Mudbud pulled Budderball's paw, causing him to let out a stinky fart. Slasher stopped and sniffed. \"YUCK WHAT IS THAT NO WAY AM I STAYING HERE!\" he yelled before running off. B-dawg and Buddha were running in an open area where Deceptor could spot them easily. \"What do we do!?\" shouted B-dawg. \"Calm yourself, B-dawg, i'v got an idea\" Buddha replied. They both walked slowly over a thin layer of ice which could brake if something heavy was on but since they were just pup's it didn't brake. Deceptor then arrived, spotting them. \"So you two were in the middle of your little team, which means your the fastest, well lets see how fast you really are\" he laughed charging at them. But the sharp claws on Deceptor's feet caused the ice he was running on to start to crack. He quickly took a step back before the ice in front of him cracked. \"Too bad he can't jump over, since this ice is fragile\" lied Buddha. Really the ice they were standing on was heavy. The raptor growled in response. \"There has to be another way around\" He ran back the way he came. \"Phew that was close\" panted B-dawg. \"I'm sure i'm faster than him, Bell was right I am brave\" \"Bell? Oh right that girl puppy you were talking nervously around\" noted Buddha. \"What, nah, B-dawg never acts like that\" he nervously replied. \"Beside's i'm sure Bell didn't notice that\". \"Hmm I think you like that dog\" guessed Buddha. \"Pshaw, that's disgusting now come on let's go find the others\" B-dawg quickly said, attempting to change the subject. Behind the small mountain, Shasta and Rosebud were still running. \"Shasta I thought you said there was only one raptor\" yelped Rosebud. \"I didn't know there was three, everyone's only spoken of a green one\" he replied. \"Hurry he's behind us!\" The red raptor was speeding past snowy rocks in order to get to his prey. Razer then spotted Jean George and decided to hide. He looked closely at his belt and saw a camera. \"Grr, he's got that thing with him I cant show myself now!\" he said to himself. The puppies ran towards him, much to his shock. \"Oh no i'm seeing you everywhere, listen you petite dogs, you better not get in my way again\" he ordered before stomping of in a different direction, with his steel trap. The puppies then ran as fast as they could until they met up with Buddha, Mudbud, Budderball and B-dawg. \"Yo you dawg's made it\" said a relieved B-dawg. \"Where's that red raptor gone?\" wondered Rosebud. \"I'm right behind you!\" yelled Razer. They turned to see him but he was standing away from them. \"But you should look at whats below you\" \"It's thin ice\" whispered Mudbud. \"All it need's is a thud and then crash!\" laughed Razer. He went closer and then jabbed his sharp claws into the ice causing a crack and all six puppies fell in the water. They were trying to dogie paddle. Shasta grabbed on to the ice, trying to get out. \"Hold on Buddies i'm nearly out!\" he told them. Razer approached him. \"Like your parents, you to will sink to your doom!\" he chortled. Shasta looked at his scar and was remembering a vivid memory before Razor whipped his tail against his paws, making him fall in the water. Razer then met up with the other two back on the hill. The sun was setting. \"You will not believe what I went through\" snarled Slasher. \"I had to run all over the place looking for another way to get to them!\" said Deceptor. \"Well don't worry about them now because they've sunk\" Razer told them while evilly laughing. \"No!\" shouted Molly. \"What did you do!?\" shouted Buddy. \"What about these two?\" asked Deceptor. \"When that human come's he'll have them\" decided Razer. \"I don't know why Death was panicking they seem harmless\". \"Lets get out of here before he comes with that flashy device\" pleaded Deceptor.\"What does it do again?\" \"It seems like it takes a picture of you and is sent to everyone so we can't let him take a picture of us\" suggested Razer. Buddy and Molly sighed knowing that it doesn't instantly send the picture to everyone but they thought it was best not to tell them that. The three then ran off to wait for Death. \"Oh Buddy do you think its true\" wailed Molly. \"Do you think the buddies are- \"The Buddies have survived way worse stuff than that, I mean they landed on the moon and fixed the Vision 1, i'm sure their still alive\" hoped Buddy. The famous Air Bud was right, for Talon the great had rescued them before they sank.[Chapter 10] The Buddies and Shasta woke up to see themselves at in a cave. \"Wh-what happened?\" wondered Buddha. Shasta turned around to see the entrance of the cave behind him. It was night. \"How did we get here?\" \"Yo dawg's is this heaven?\" thought B-dawg. \"I highly dought this is what heaven look's like\" Buddha assured him. \"But clearly a miracle has saved us\". Rosebud, Mudbud and Budderball woke up. \"Wow I had a crazy dream!\" yawned Budderball before seeing Shasta and realising it wasn't a dream. \"Oh good your all awake\" said a voice. It was Talon the great, the dog who taught them how to be a dog sled team. \"Talon!\" shouted Shasta, excited to see him. \"I saw you puppies about to drown in the water and I rescued you\" he told them. \"Thank you\" said Rosebud. \"But how did you know where we were?\" \"It's like I told you pup's last time sometimes fate intervenes\" the wise dog explained. \"Wise dude we are in some serious trouble and we could use some advice\" said Mudbud. \"You see there's these er... \"Raptor's chasing us\" finished Buddha. \"And they'v got our Mum and Dad locked up in a cage\". \"I know about these three\" Talon informed them. \"But how did they get here, shouldn't they be extinct?\" asked Shasta. \"You see Razer, the red one, was frozen for millions of years in a cave with his friend\" explained Talon. \"Shasta when you were just a small pup you accidentally freed them while you were exploring. Your parents saved you and in the process caused Razer's friend to sink in freezing water and trapped him in the ice, your father scratched him on his eye when he was about to grab you\". \"Wow\" exclaimed Shasta. \"So that's why he has a scar on his eye\". \"But if he was trapped how'd he get out?\" asked Budderball. \"I am not sure, sometime's there's mysteries out there\" replied Talon. \"All I know is when he was freed he found two other raptor's and freed them as well. Now they rampage around the low lands, scaring everyone away, and sometimes food from a unknown source is delivered to them and it appears that they want you now\". \"Wow all that time without food\" cried Buddeball. The puppies had confused and worried expressions on their faces. \"But Talon, sir, our people are leaving in two days and we have no way of freeing are parent's\" whispered Mudbud. \"I'm afraid you will have to go back\" Talon told them. \"If you attempt to leave the low lands they will pick up your scent the only way to get out is the way you came\". \"But their bigger than us and scarier\" said Rosebud. \"Plus they can jump high and cut us of\". \"Pup's there is one way you can beat them at their own game but I didn't want to teach this to you because it could be considered as cheating in the race\" Talon sighed, \"While sled racing there is a technique which can make you jump while running\" \"But without Adam how can we race?\" questioned Shasta. \"You will not need a musher or even a sled all you will need is confidence and of course a leader\" Talon replied using his wise words. \"You will have extra time a huge snow storm is supposed to occur tomorrow, it will delay flight's\". He then turned to Shasta and said \"Although all of you puppies are in danger, Razer has a burning desire for revenge against you Shasta, because he didn't want to return to a world were he does not belong and blames you for the loss of his friend.\" Shasta put his head down. \"Don't blame yourself, dawg, we wont let that crazy thing touch you that's fo' shizzle\" B-dawg assured him (of course using his slang words). \"Now pup's you should rest, we will begin training tomorrow\" Talon advised them. The six puppies went to sleep. Meanwhile at the hotel the kid's were told that the flight will be delayed due to the storm. Sam, Billy and Noah had to share a room. \"I hope the Buddies are ok\" said Sam. \"Yeah, it kinda feel's like their still here\" replied Noah. \"Weird right?\" \"Yeah\" agreed Billy, taking out a basketball chain from his pocket. \"I can't wait to show B-dawg what I bought him from the gift shop\". On Drex's ship, MONK-E was humming loudly to himself while Death was lying on a chair drinking a can fizzy drink he found on the floor. \"Do you have to sing so loudly?\" he whined. \"There's a difference between humming to yourself and singing\" replied MONK-E. \"It's not humming to yourself if everyone can hear you\" he corrected. The guard then came in. \"Death I have- he stopped when he saw him drinking a fizzy drink. \"Um where did that come from?\" \"I found it on Earth, it actually taste's nice, I don't why someone just threw it on the ground\" \"There's so many thing's wrong with that\" \"What is it?\" \"Huh?\" \"You came in to say something?\" \"Oh right Drex want's to know how the puppy hunting is going\" \"And where is Drex?\" \"He's busy on an important discovery!\" exclaimed the guard. MONK-E then entered the conversation. \"What discovery?\" \"You remember the ring's of Inspiron which was lost all those years ago\" explained the guard. \"Well he thinks he's located where they are at!\" \"That's wonderful!\" exclaimed MONK-E. \"Ok, i'm going to check on those raptor's\" said Death. \"Oh and MONK-E, now that your done researching on Earth, delete all of the information from the file's in case Drex see's\" MONK-E nodded. \"But you need to back for the Inspiron battle without you we will lose!\" cried the guard. \"Don't worry what could go wrong i'm just visiting Alaska to check up on them?\" the skeleton re-assured him. Back in the cave on the buddies were sound asleep. Rosebud woke up but before she went back to sleep she noticed Shasta was not with the rest of them. She walked up a but before noticing him laying in a dark corner of the cave. He looked sad. Rosebud decided to talk to him and see what the problem is.[Chapter 11] Rosebud sat next to him, looking at the guilt in his eyes. \"Shasta is something wrong?\" she asked. \"Yeah there is, actually quite a few things\" he replied. \"How'd you know?\" \"You have the same look B-dawg does when he's upset -scared- about something\" she explained. \"So what is wrong?\" \"It's just...I'm the one who freed those raptor's; they didn't choose to be here. I cant imagine having to hide your whole life, unlike us they're not needed or wanted and it's all my fault\" he confessed.\"And all the bad things they did, and whatever they're gonna do next is on me. I kinda know how they feel,I used to think I was the only dog who had never raced before\" Rosebud paused for a moment. \"But you were just a small pup, you didn't know what was going on\". \"I don't remember but they do; they don't seem to think that\" he sighed.\"They seriously want us gone\" Rosebud and her brothers knew this guilty feeling. When Selkirk Tanders and his employees kidnapped their parents they all blamed themselves. \"Raptors; no raptors; pup or not, the situation would be the same, the evil would still chase you\" interrupted Talon, appearing from the shadows behind them. \"The fault doesn't lie solely in you, Shasta. Did you ever wonder why I isolated myself in a mountain away from everyone?\" \"I heard that one of your star pupils went rogue\" said Shasta. \"I made the mistake; not you\" sighed Talon. \"Freedom was my greatest student but deep inside I knew he had his own desires. And a dark power manipulated him into launching his uprising that nearly succeeded if I had not trained your father to stop him\". \"My father stopped Freedom?\" said Shasta, alarmed. \"But what was that dark power?\" asked Rosebud. \"Dark Blade... I was out in the lowlands after the Freedom uprising ended, and I saw a strange object crash into the snow. Talon raced through the heavy snow storm looked over the hills. His jaw dropped when he came across a dark armoured warrior. His head was covered in dark grey layers of metal that overlapped each other, except for the middle where only one of his evil red eyes was seen; the other was covered. His attire was mostly black uniform, except for his arms which looked similar to his evil face. On his arms he wore two gauntlets that each summoned two sharp blades. He was lost, confused and needed help. I knew something didn't look right about him, but he was pleading for help, claiming he was a traveller from off-world. I kept this a secret because he didn't requested it, saying it would bring doom if I told anyone. I told him of your father; Freedom and showed him two frozen raptors that I had found in the mountains: Slasher and Deceptor. Once Blade got a message from his ally's, saying they had come to rescue him, he immediately showed his true colours. He smashed the ice, freeing the raptors who he tricked into serving him. He then located Razer and freed him from the cave, you accidentally found. It was Dark Blade who orchestrated the Freedom uprising and it was him who ordered the raptors to destroy your family, Shasta, fearing them,they deliberatly made smashed layers of the ice to make them fragile; Blade left Earth. I lied to Razer, saying you had died with your parents when the ice smashed but now they know your alive. \"Whoa\" commented Rosebud. \"I think I may have also fallen into his trap, he tricked me into coming to Alaska in the first place\". \"You may think everything they do is on you; but anything that happens to you...that's on me\" Talon said quietly. \"Which is why I'm going to teach you what I taught Freedom, so you can defeat these predators. It is in their blood to hunt and to kill others, you had nothing to do with that. Now have a good sleep, you two are the most important in the team\". Talon returned into the shadows. \"Your tale may not have started happy, Shasta, but you made the rest...and the rest is the most important. You all have already done more than what is expected for dogs of your age\". Shasta's sad look began to change. \"Don't worry Shasta, soon we'll all get out of here and then maybe the lowlands wont be so deserted, once we stop those predators\". \"True, we have nothing to do with their killer instincts\" smiled Shasta. \"Besides why would anyone want to harm someone as cute as you?\" \"Huh?\" \"I mean US. Why would anyone want to harm something as cute as US, that just slipped out\" she quickly tried covering up her remark. \"Now we'd better get some rest, we've got a big day tomorrow\" They went back to where the other Buddies were sleeping and joined them. \"Thanks Rosebud\" thanked Shasta, feeling a lot better now. Meanwhile at Adam's house, Adam had just come home (he was using crotches) \"Welcome home Adam!\" cried his Mum after him and his Dad returned from the hospital. \"Where's Shasta?\" he asked. \"Well it is pretty late i'm sure Shasta's sleeping in the shed\" his Mum guessed. \"Come on it's time to get some sleep\" said his Dad. Adam went upstairs.[Chapter 12] Outside the Sheriff's office, Jean George and Sheriff Ryan were talking while Deputy Bernie was laying on the floor. \"So you won't even come with me!?\" shouted Jean. \"I'm sorry, i'm not wasting time going to the low lands there's to much work to be done\" replied Ryan. \"What? Why not?!\" Jean yelled. \"Other than the fact that your crazy, a huge storm is approaching and I need to prepare\". \"Er is that your phone beeping?\" asked the Sheriff, noticing the loud beeps coming from Jean's trouser pocket. \"No that's my detector it tell's if one of my traps has caught something\" he replied quickly taking it out. \"The camera installed in the cage will show me whose trapped!\" Bernie had woken up, eager to see what had been trapped. \"Well?\" said Ryan. \"Two adult golden retriever's!\" he shouted in excitement. \"Exactly what I need for my team!\" \"Oh no that must be Buddy and Molly!\" realised Bernie. \"Well i'm going to low lands, tomorrow, regardless\" Jean cried. \"Now I'd love to stay and chat with you all day- actually that's a lie I can't stand being near you au reviour\". The next day, early in the morning, the six puppies woke up early and followed Talon to a huge area, far from the lowlands. It was plain with a few mountains and trees littered around, as well as a few ponds of water. \"Thank goodness, I haven't drunk in days\" B-dawg cheered as he began licking the water. \"Pup, I suggest you not drink the 'bath' of Freedom\" Talon said, walking on top of the highest hill. \"YUCK!\" screamed B-dawg, licking his tongue on the snow to get rid of the taste. \"Do we have to get up so early?\" whined Mudbud. \"A girl needs her beauty sleep\" added Rosebud. \"And it's so cold\" complained Budderball. \"PUPS!\" called Talon from high up. The puppies all looked up. \"Do you want to free your parents? \"Yes!\" \"Then you must listen to me, this is the place that I once trained packs of huskies, including the legendary husky, Freedom!\" The amazed pup's looked around the training ground, they had heard legends of a dog, Freedom, supposedly one of the greatest race dogs ever. \"I can not train you pup's like i have done the others, but perhaps I can change my teaching methods\" \"Don't worry, Talon, we won't be like Freedom\" promised Shasta. \"Pup's we have limited time, do you remember how to run as a team?\" asked Talon. \"How could we forget something as awesome as that?\" B-dawg replied. Talon instructed them to practise running together. \"Now jump over the log at the same time. They all tried jumping over but fell down. \"Use all four paws and follow the dogs in front of you\" advised Talon. They tried again this time Buddha, B-dawg, Shasta and Rosebud managed to do it but Mudbud and Budderball just slipped of. \"This is a lot harder than it look's\" groaned Budderball. After more jumping they finally did it and this time tried using a rock. \"Woo hoo!\" yelled Mudbud. \"That was radical!\" however the usually dirty pup noticed his coat was completely clean. \"Ahh i'm spotless again!\" \"Get used to guys, we probably will never see Mudbud look like this again\" chortled Buddha. \"Now pups you need to practise running side by side and doing what the other is doing. Remember who's in the lead, just because your not in your race positions doesn't mean your roles will change\" advised Talon. They weren't attached to any harnesses so they could run freely but they had to follow Shasta and Rosebud so that they know where to go (since Rosebud was a navigator) and who to follow (since Shasta was the leader). Non-stop, the pup's trained vigorously, until Talon felt that they were ready. Back in the low lands, Buddy and Molly woke up to see Razor, Deceptor, Death and Slasher walking up the hill. \"What is that thing?\" whispered Molly. \"I don't know but strange thing's are happening around here\" replied the confused Air Bud. \"These are their parents\" Deceptor told Death. \"You mean the famous sports playing Air bud\" Death corrected him. \"You must be so proud to have such incredible puppies\". \"You mean HAD such incredible puppies they have sunken beneath the ice\" laughed Slasher. \"Did you ACTUALLY see them sink?\" asked Death. \"Well no you see the ice was cracking so I had to quickly run before I could join them but i'm positive they could not have survived that\" explained Razor. \"In that case excellent work!\" applauded Death. \"I'm gonna go look around for Exo-striker he probably fell of somewhere\". Death activated his phantom mode (which turns him into a vivid ghost hovering towards something) and took of. Razor then turned to Buddy and Molly. \"Your new owner will be here soon so ta ta for now\" chortled Razor. The Buddies and Shasta continued practising until they jumped over a rock and continued running down a empty area. \"This feel's great!\" yelled Shasta. \"Mum and Dad, here we come!\" announced Rosebud. \"Well done pup's!\" congratulated Talon. Deputy Bernie was running past when he noticed the puppies training. \"The Buddies, they must not know their parents are trapped, I don't want to worry them\" thought Bernie.\"Well i'd better go find their parents before they realise\".Death was also walking through past some trees when he heard soft barking. \"That's barking\" he realised. He ran as fast as he could, following the puppy noises, until he spotted them running and then jumping together over a large rock. \"Those fools!\" he yelled. \"Their still alive!\" He ran back the way he came towards the hill.[Chapter 13] Death teleported back onto the hill and he was mad. \"Well, you gone and did it, you gone and killed my plan\" said Death softly, before raising his voice. \"When I said I want FIVE GOLDEN PUPPIES DEAD I meant it!\" \"Listen you creep they sunk in freezing cold water, nothing could've survived that!\" roared Razer. \"Oh they did, did they?\" Death said sarcastically. \"So who did I see jumping over some rocks, like lunatics?\" \"Impossible!\" stated Slasher. Buddy and Molly felt relieved, at least they knew their pups were safe. \"Go! Find them, you fossils, before the storm kicks in!\" ordered Death. He teleported away. \"Find them...and destroy them!\" Razer gritted his teeth, muttering \"This is giving me a headache\". Deceptor pounced off the hill and ran. Slasher stayed and looked at his leader. \"I take it you still want that husky for yourself?\" asked Slasher. \"Eat the others for all I care, I want him before me-alive\" answered Razer. \"It's time to end the lineage of pathetic sled dogs\". Meanwhile in Ferntiuktuk, the kid's were looking through the window of the toy shop. Alice spotted the same teddy that was wearing the pink hat on display (the one that Adam bought for Rosebud). \"Hey it's the hat Rosebud was wearing when the Buddies came back!\" she pointed. \"That reminds me, where's Buddy?\" remembered Noah. \"Didn't that sheriff dude want to show him to the school or something?\" said Pete. \"Yeah but I haven't seen him since yesterday afternoon\" Jean George and Paul marched out of Paul's house and Jean was preparing to leave. \"Now are you sure you want to go- because if freezing to death is your thing then your going in the right direction?\" Paul asked once again. \"Stop being such a baby! Snow storms fly by all the time, what are the chances that it will ACTUALLY effect us?\" rejected Jean. \"According to the news...100%\" stated Paul. \"I can live with those odds\" Jean George re-affirmed his point. \"But those dogs wont be able to, which is why I need to get them before they freeze to death\". \"I didn't realise Golden retriever's were even sold in Alaska\" said Paul. \"If I'm right, which I usually am, those dogs are the parents of those five annoying puppies, that I keep seeing everywhere. I even saw them yesterday in the lowlands! They've come back to haunt me!\" The children couldn't help but to overhear the conversation. \"Buddy and Molly are trapped!\" gasped Henry. \"The Buddies are here?\" gasped Alice. \"B-but how?\" wondered Billy. \"They must've followed Buddy into the plane\" realised Noah. \"But we cant leave them here, we've got to go get them!\" stated Bartleby. Talon watched the grey clouds approach and realised they couldn't waste any more time. \"Pup's the time has come to rescue your parents\" he declared. \"B-b-but the r-raptors\" stammered B-dawg. \"I have taught you all that you need to counter their manoeuvres, now it's up to you to free your parents\" said Talon. \"Hurry, the storm is about to begin\". \"Won't you be coming with us?\" asked Shasta, hoping Talon would help. \"No. If I reveal myself the raptors will know that I stayed, when they warned me to flee\". \"Okay, guys lets get ready\" Budderball said. \"I recognise this place, it's near where we met that Inuit man, I think I know which direction we need to head\" stated Rosebud. \"Great job sis\" Budderball congratulated his sister. \"That's why she's the navigator\" added Shasta. \"Good luck in your mission\" Talon said, before he departed. The Buddies (led by Shasta and Rosebud) began their trek; running past the mountains and into the thick forest, where the race (in Snow buddies) took place. Deceptor rampaged his way through the snow, jumping past skinny trees. Slasher cut down any trees that stood in his way. Razer waited on the mountain; the storm had began. It wasn't heavy-yet- but soon it would evolve into a deadly snow storm. \"Curse this planet's miserable weather\" cursed the raptor. \"If it wasn't for that husky I wouldn't have to bear it! I will make sure he pays dearly for this!\" \"Excuse me\" Molly approached the front of the cage. Razer growled, causing Molly to retreat but she continued anyway. \"What do you have against him, he's just a small, cute puppy\". \"I don't really care what he seems like to you?\" snorted Razer. \"When he was a few weeks old, he freed me from my icy tomb, releasing me into this cruel world. Then his parents killed Claw, my only friend, and now that his parents are dead, he's the next target to...er..target!\" \"But he was only a baby\" protested Molly. \"He has no parents, who will miss him except for that annoying boy?\" dismissed the raptor. He decided to help his comrades in searching. \"Try not to freeze to death while I'm gone...and don't go anywhere, ha ha!\" \"Ha-ha\" Buddy laughed sarcastically, after Razer pounced of the hill and ran. When he was gone, Deputy Bernie ran up to the cage. \"Buddy, Molly, thank goodness your safe!\" he cried. \"Were fine deputy, but that monster is after our pup's you need to go get help\" warned Buddy. \"So the tales are true, their is a monster that haunts us\" gasped Bernie. \"Three actually, three raptors\" corrected Buddy. \"I'll go back to town and find help\" Bernie ran off. The Buddies continued running through the forest, as more and more snow fumed down from the sky. The growls and roars of the raptors could be heard. \"Yikes, it looks like their looking for us\" gulped Budderball. \"They should call us white receivers, cause this snow is all over us\" shivered Mudbud, shaking the snow of his back. \"We're gonna die out here!\" whimpered B-dawg. \"Try to be positive\" urged Buddha, trying to look at the bright side of things. \"Okay, I'm positively sure we're gonna die out here!\" replied B-dawg. Shasta and Rosebud were in the lead, running faster than the others. Shasta's vision had began going blurry; he was tired from all the running. \"Shasta, you okay?\" asked Rosebud. \"Yeah, it's nothing\" Shasta shook of his weariness and continued. From his high mountain, Talon watched the storm get bigger and bigger; colder and colder. \"I was a fool to let those pup's go by themselves; this whole ordeal is my fault\" regretted the old dog.[Chapter 14] Bernie ran back to the town and straight and saw Francois, Philippe and lots of other husky's outside a shop. There was also a few huskies which Shasta used to know. \"Everyone I need your help, it's a matter of life and death!\" he shouted. \"What?!\" asked one of the husky's, Baron. \"The monster he's there with two others and he's trapped those puppies who won the race and their parents!\" \"Oh no!\" shouted Francois saying \"oh no\" in French. \"But we can't go to the lowlands!\" \"Yeah those things will kill us if this storm doesn't already\" cried Alpine, a female husky that belonged to the Russian man (in Snow buddies). \"But we all know it well, you all used to race there all the time!\" argued Bernie. \"Those puppy's saved our lives, I would gladly go with you, deputy\" offered Philippe. The other husky's looked at each other. \"They did teach that mean Jean George a lesson\" growled a large husky. \"What do you think, Cotton?\" \"But those things aren't something to play nicely with!\" Cotton, a white husky, replied. \"Listen the lowlands are our place to race, not these monsters, if we all go we can defeat them\" Bernie tried to persuade them. \"I'm in, those puppies made dog sled racing cheat-free and good again. Plus I once knew this husky\" said a slender husky who the others considered a good lead dog. \"Anyone else?\" The other husky's began barking in agreement. The owners began pouring out to see what was going on, including Jean George and Sheriff Ryan. \"What's going on?\" the confused Sheriff asked. \"Watch out everyone, there's three of them now!\" advised Bernie. All of the dogs began running out the town and towards the lowlands. \"There heading to the lowlands!\" noted Adam's Dad. \"The storm is starting to go down a bit we must follow them\" commanded the Sheriff. \"The raptor's, they know about them!\" laughed Jean George. \"I still don't think so\" said another man. \"We shall see when we go\" Jean replied. \"To the lowlands!\" Everyone began marching towards the entrance of the town. \"I forgot about those golden retrievers I caught\" realised Jean. The kids and their class was standing outside two and heard this. \"Excuse me I think those are our dogs you caught\" Noah firmly told him. \"Finders keepers, losers weepers!\" he jeered. The Sheriff glared at him, forcing Jean to change his tongue. \"I mean yes I must return them\" he quickly said. \"Excuse me Miss?\" the Sheriff said to the teacher. \"Something big is going on please take the kid's to the hotel where its safe and don't worry if your dogs are out their we will find them\" The kids nodded before the teacher hurried them along. Death was watching this scene unfold from on top of a roof. The Buddies and Shasta had reached the hill where Buddy and Molly were trapped on. They were hiding. \"Ok, were gonna need to find something sharp to open that lock\" stated Shasta. \"Does anyone see a icicle or anything?\" \"Icicles taste like popsicles right?\" asked a hungry Budderball. \"Dude remember what happened last time you tried that?\" Mudbud reminded him of when he got his tongue stuck on a icicle. \"This is no time to think about food we need to save mum and dad\" said Rosebud. \"Wait where are the raptor's? said Buddha, noticing they were gone. Razor, Slasher and Deceptor arrived back and were at the entrance of the forest. \"I can smell them, their close\" Razor informed them. \"Good, cause i'm getting hungry\" snarled Deceptor. \"We haven't caught them yet and their little class is gonna leave soon\" noted Razor. \"Death is gonna be testy about this\" Death teleported next to them. \"Testy, i'm not testy why would I be testy?\"\" he calmly began before raising his voice. \"I'M FURIOUS! Listen lots of humans and dogs are heading here now, hurry up and find them you big lizards!\" \"There! Look!\" yelled Slasher, spotting them from behind the small mountain. \"This time i'll get them!\" Slasher raced towards them. \"Uh, dawg's we got a 911!\" shouted B-dawg. \"Ok, it's time to put this training to work\" Shasta told the Buddies who nodded in response. They turned and ran towards the former race track. Slasher followed them in hot pursuit while Razor and Deceptor waited above the hill. \"An army of muts are coming?!\" laughed Razor. \"With humans!\" shouted Death. \"Listen here you reptiles, I've had just about enough of this running around the universe thing, you clearly don't understand the importance of staying hidden!\" \"We'll be gone by the time they arrive!\" Razor assured him. \"But it seem's like this is a turning point for the low land's, the puppies have bought mischief here!\" \"Exactly what Drex is concerned about so you big lizards better terminate them!\" said Death. Buddy and Molly had had enough of listening to plots against their pup's. \"Listen, tell us why you need them\" demanded Buddy. \"Who's Drex and why do you care about our puppies?!\" shouted Molly. \"All will be revealed in time\" replied the phantom. \"Actually no, hopefully it wont\". On Drex's ship, another one of Drex's top commander's called Dark Blade had arrived. \"Where's Death?\" asked a concerned Drex. \"This is taking to long\" \"Maybe we can reply some footage using Exo-striker's built-in camera, you know just to relieve stress\" suggested the guard. \"No can do\" interrupted MONK-E. \"You see his scanner has turned of that mean's he's been destroyed\". \"What?! boomed Drex. \"Did the dog's to this?!\" MONK-E didn't know what to say. \"It seem's like Death's plan isn't as good as I thought\" said Drex. \"His plan?\" interrupted Dark Blade. \"It was MY plan, I was the one who convinced the female puppy to go to Alaska!\" \"Wait it was Blade's plan?\" commented the guard. \"All right, i'm going back to the crystal cave's to speak to the wise alien, you two come with me\" commanded Drex, who was now seriously concerned about this prophecy. \"Aw what why?!\" complained the red guard. \"Because I said so and because YOU were the one who said 'nothing could go wrong' and also JUST BECAUSE!\" shouted Drex. \"Oh and also I can shoot lightning out of my hands, so that's something\". \"Yeah well the witch is 97 years old and is clearly losing her mind\" \"Fire him please\" whispered MONK-E. \"No excuses! Blade your in command while I'm gone\" declared Drex, as they marched into the teleporter. \"Er if your taking everyone with you there's no one for me to command?\" Dark Blade stated. \"Command yourself then!\" he boomed before they teleported.[Chapter 15] The Buddies, using all of their strength, ran along the former race course followed by a fierce raptor, who was destroying everything in his way. \"That dude is gaining on us\" stated Mudbud. \"Don't worry there's some thin ice up ahead, i'v got a plan\" Shasta told them. \"Well we'd better run faster!\" yelled Budderball. The puppies ran towards a tree which had been knocked over. \"All right guy's remember our training\" Buddha reminded them. Slasher followed them, destroying all the rocks and logs in front of him. The puppies then put Talon's training to work. \"Remember, follow the paws in front of you\" said Buddha again reminding them. First Shasta and Rosebud got their paws ready followed by the others. They ran up towards the small tree and jumped over it. The charging raptor halted, amazed at what he had just seen. \"What!?\" he thundered. \"IMPOSSIBLE!\" Slasher leaped over the tree and continued following his prey. \"Yo, that was of the chain!\" shouted B-dawg out of excitement. \"Don't look now, but that green raptor is behind us!\" screamed Rosebud. \"I see you puppies have been taught by that Talon fellow in the mountains\" realised Slasher. \"I thought he had fled but no it seemed he ignored our ultimatum to leave. He will be dealt with soon enough\" The puppies continued running as fast as they can. \"I will tear through everything and everyone in the lowlands until you surrender!\" cackled the green raptor. \"You will be destroyed; we will prevail!\" As Slasher got closer to them, to the point where he could almost grab Budderball by the leg, a dog suddenly charged out of the trees. Slasher broke the puppies formation and sent them scrambling. \"Talon taught you well but he didn't teach you everything\" snarled Slasher. The dog hurled himself into the raptor and sent him flying into a group of huge rocks, surrounding a mountain. It was Talon. \"Talon!\" cheered the puppies. \"Phew that was lucky, another second and I would've been that guy's lunch\" wheezed Budderball. \"Now you know how your food feels\" laughed Buddha. \"Pup's run!\" ordered Talon. \"So you ignored our warnings eh?\" grinned Slasher. \"You are no match for me, without the aide of your precious Freedom, let's just hope your new pupils don't end up like the last\". \"Talon we can't leave you here\" refused Shasta, going forward to help him. \"We will reign supreme!\" gloated Slasher. \"Go!\" repeated Talon, charging at his enemy. \"It is time for me to correct my mistake...or pay for them\". As the raptor viciously attacked him and Talon dodged his blows, Slasher's roars had triggered an avalanche from the mountain above them. The snow began pummelling towards them like lava from a Volcano that just erupted. \"Talon please you don't have to be here!\" Shasta tried helping his teacher. The Buddies quickly pulled him back and they continued running, as the snow blocked everything behind them, until both opponents were out of sight. The pup's found their way to the area which was the finish line, where Francois and Philippe had nearly perished if it wasn't for them. \"I can't believe Talon...\" whimpered Rosebud. \"If I know our sensie, he will escape\" hoped Buddha. \"Dawgs, we've got our own problems!\" cried B-dawg, as before him was Slasher, emerging from the woods. \"It's a pity your Talon the supposed great isn't here to see me claim victory\" he snarled. \"Quick this way!\" ordered Shasta as they continued jumping over obstacles (much to the surprise of Slasher).They made their way to the area the two older husky's crashed through, which was surrounded by a big tree, followed closely by Slasher. \"You shouldn't have come back now prepare to meet your doom!\" Slasher taunted, hoping to scare the young puppies. \"How are we gonna jump over that it's bigger than my lunch!\" cried Budderball. \"Just remember what Talon told us\" advised Shasta. \"The husky pup is correctumundo!\" agreed Mudbud. \"Ha! How ironic, the same place your parent's met their demise, on the orders of Dark Blade!\" jeered Slasher. \"That's what they get for allowing themselves to be slaves to the humans!\" \"They weren't slave's stop talking about them!\" Shasta yelled at him. \"Ignore him he's trying to make you lose focus\" Rosebud whispered to him. Both the puppies and Slasher charged. The puppies, miraculously, jumped over the tree and stretched their paws so they could miss the ice. Slasher, unaware that there was ice on the other side of the tree jumped over it. The evil raptor smashed through the ice, sinking in the shallow water below. The Buddies and Shasta took a minute to catch their breath. \"Good...job everyone\" Shasta congratulated them. \"That was mad!\" panted B-dawg. \"I'v worked up a killer appetite\" Budderball stated. \"We'd better get to Mum and Dad now, it's getting dark!\" Rosebud informed them. \"Hey look at that!\" Rosebud was looking at a sharp object stuck in the ice where Slasher fell. \"It's that nasty raptor's claw!\" realised Buddha. \"That might be sharp enough to pick the lock on that cage\". Shasta went over and retrieved it. \"Guys I think I have an idea\".[Chapter 16] In the dark and cold crystal caves, on a moon near Inspiron, Drex was waiting to speak to the wise old alien. \"It's freezing out here why did we have to come at this time, better question why'd we have to come at all?\" shivered the guard. \"Watch your tongue or your demoted!\" threatened Drex. \"Sir, without respect, its freezing out here and I personally think whoever made this suit clearly has no knowledge of space replied the guard. \"Why you-began Drex. \"That's it MONK-E your coming with me in the next room to see the old alien, where it's warm, and you can wait out here in the cold!\" The guard sighed while MONK-E cheered. The two went into the next cave where the wise old alien was sitting by a fire with a crystal ball, talking to another alien. \"Hurry up out of my way!\" ordered Drex causing the other alien to run out of the cave. \"Ah Drex your back\" greeted the alien. \"Look, you old fool, I sent two agents to destroy the five animals which you say will defeat me one has been destroyed while the other has recruited three creatures to help him and even then it is taking him so long!\" explained Drex. \"I demand to know more about this prophecy!\" \"If you continue on your path you will...trip over\" the alien began sounding mystical before changing her voice. \"What?\" questioned Drex, before he tripped over a rock and fell, landing in front of the sorcerer. \"OW!\" \"Followed by pain\" the alien whacked him on the head with her ancient books. \"Why you...old fool!\" The wise alien took a moment to look in her crystal ball and calmly replied. \"Drex I am not the fool you are the one who has sent Death, one of the most deadliest soldiers, to attack five small puppies\" \"Just tell me what you see!\" he yelled back. \"Flames are everywhere and there's running, fast running\" she started. \"Probably the raptors\" guessed MONK-E. \"Yes and no\" she replied before adding \"I see poor animals trapped in a cage and a hill filled with evil creatures and a desire of revenge and the feeling of hate!\" \"What happens to the animals?\" asked Drex. \"Their fate is difficult to see but I think if they stay on the right path then this won't be their last adventure\" she informed him. \"Not if I have anything to do with it!\" snapped Drex. \"Well it seem's like a stage is set and all the players are ready\" she repeated the words of Drex's evil commander, who created this plan. \"Sir we have a problem\" MONK-E interrupted. \"A commander called Dark Anthem is calling and he says Death isn't back and they urgently need him to complete the invasion\". \"Don't worry if I know Death he will defeat your enemies and be back in time to help them\" the guard re-assured him. \"I thought I told you to wait outside!\" yelled Drex. \"And I thought you said it was warm in here\" whispered MONK-E. The guard grumbled and went back out. \"I foresee great troubles clouded with evil ahead\" warned the sorceress. \"Hmph my life is full of troubles\" grumbled Drex. The six puppies returned to the mountain area, beneath the hill. \"Alright you guys know the plan?\" Shasta asked the Buddies, trying to forget about Talon and focus on the task at hand. \"Don't worry dawg...er..we'll be fine\" shivered B-dawg. \"Don't be scared B-dawg that will just make them happy\" said Mudbud. The Buddies walked past the mountain in front of the hill while Shasta snuck of with the claw in his mouth. The Buddies were creating a diversion so Shasta could free their parents. \"Where's Slasher?\" said Deceptor. \"That's not possible\" whispered a shocked Razor \"LOOK THEIR RIGHT THERE GO GET THEM!\" screamed Death. \"Why are they just standing there?\" wondered Razor. \"Why aren't they running\" the confused Buddy asked himself. Razor and Deceptor raced down the hill and chases the Buddies, who were not leaving the area. Razor tried to attack Budderball and Buddha but the two jumped out the way. Deceptor gave chase to the others but because they were so small it was difficult to attack them all. Razor jumped towards them but once again slipped on ice and fell down a few metres away from them. \"How did they do this?\" Razor asked himself before he noticed Shasta with Slasher's claw in his mouth running towards the hill. \"A diversion is it?\" he realised. \"Those sneaky puppies!\" Razor sneakily walked towards the other side of the hill hoping to beat Shasta to the top.[Chapter 17] The Buddies continued running until B-dawg spotted a small cave near the mountain. \"Yo dawgs lets hide in there!\" he called to his siblings. The others ran into it while Deceptor roared at them. However this roar caused the ice above to fall and block the cave, leaving the blue raptor to try and brake it. \"What do we do now?\" cried Budderball. \"Relax dude i'm sure Shasta has freed mum and dad\" Mudbud assured him. \"But what about when this thing brakes the ice!?\" panicked Rosebud. \"WERE DOOMED!\" shouted B-dawg. Shasta got to the top of the hill where he saw Buddy and Molly trapped in Jean George's cage. \"Don't worry i'm gonna get you out\" the husky told them. \"You must be Shasta\" said Molly. \"Thank you for keeping the Buddies safe\". \"Well they did once do a HUGE favour for me\" he replied. He picked up the claw again and went towards the cage, hoping to pick the lock. Just then Razer jumped up and landed on the hill causing the surprised puppy to fall back and drop the claw. \"So trying to set a trap are you?\" the raptor laughed slowly going closer showing his menacing teeth. \"Its Shasta isn't it? That's your name? Is it really you, finally we meet at last...for the second time\". \"P-please leave us alone\" Shasta pleaded. \"Never!\" he yelled. \"Just like I will never be free from this planet for probably ten more years,thanks to you!\" \"Look I've got a thought Razer how bout I go negotiate the Buddies surrender and you let the parents go, eh?\" proposed Shasta, noticing the raptor's hideous scar. \"I can see you'v noticed the little parting gift your father gave me\" Razer snarled. \"Ok here's another proposition, how bout you let the dogs go and...I'll let you escape\" Shasta jokingly said, stalling. \"I mean your friend, Slasher, learnt the hard way\" \"See, that's the kind of behaviour that led you to release your nightmare\" Death teleported on top of the cage. \"I'v caught one!\" Razer told him. Death looked over at the scared husky and didn't seem to care. \"What is this?\" he said. \"Does this dog look like a golden retriever to you?\" \"Where are these Buddies, as they call themselves?\" \"Over there in that cave, Deceptor is smashing through\" Razor pointed out. \"Since Exo-striker's signal is gone of i'm assuming he's been destroyed\" said Death. \"Oh how sad\" Razer sarcastically said. \"What, who cares about him!\" cried the phantom. \"Their a diamond dozen and the one's most likely to be picked off, kinda like the pawns in chess\". \"Why do you want them?\" Shasta slowly asked the scary figure. \"HA, look at the little pipsqueak I just can't take him seriously he's so cute although I guess those eyes are kinda scary!\" Death taunted him. \"That is Shasta\". \"Him?\" gasped Death. \"He's a puppy. Your a puppy. What are you gonna do, tough guy, bark at me? Ha. Oh make it stop, it's to funny\". \"Slasher seem's to have met his end\" Razer sadly told him. Death stopped laughing. \"How do three raptors fail to chase after puppies?\" Death demanded to know. \"They know this terrain better than us plus they know those dog sled racing techniques and we aren't familiar with that\" Razor told Death. \"Hmm, well a dog sled team is nothing without a lead dog\" he grinned staring at Shasta. Shasta ran down the hill and Razor furiously followed him. Death took out his scythe and threw it into the ice blocking the cave,smashing it. The spectre then activated his phantom mode and went down the hill to assist Razer. \"Run!\" yelled Buddha causing the others to run under Deceptor's feet. Buddy noticed the claw had fallen next to the cage. \"Molly can you reach that?\" he asked her. Molly stuck her paw out the cage and pushed it closer, before picking it up with her teeth. \"Good, now we need to pick the lock\" explained Air bud. Molly stuck her head out the cage and placed the claw in the lock and began turning it. Eventually they got out. \"We're free!\" cheered Molly. \"Molly you go help the Buddies\" said Buddy looking at Deceptor chasing them around he then looked to his left and saw Razor and Death chasing Shasta. \"I'll go help that husky\" \"Buddy be careful those two look really dangerous!\" advised a worried Molly. The citizens of Ferntiuktuk were following the dogs who were running ahead of them. They soon stopped after hearing the loud roars of the raptor's. \"It's the raptor's we must be close\" guessed the lead husky. \"What was that?\" whispered sheriff Ryan. \"It is the raptors they are here!\" laughed Jean George. \"In your visages! They are here!\" \"And i'm outta here bye!\" stammered Paul. \"I mean I should...go back to town and get some weapons\". \"I'll go back to my shop and get some\" offered Joe, Adam's dad. \"Hey I wanted to abandon these fools, I don't wanna die with them!\" complained Paul, before realising how loud he spoke. \"I mean...onward!\" The Buddies were tired of running and couldn't run any longer. \"Ah ha now I got you right where I want you\" roared Deceptor. \"Er come on dawg whatever that hooded dude is paying you were'll double it?\" lied B-dawg. \"Yeah, y-you l-like...dogie treats right?\" drooled Budderball. \"Yeah those things are da bomb!\" added B-dawg. \"How about some golden stake instead?\" chortled Deceptor. \"Ooh great I could eat!\" said Budderball. \"Budderball, he's talking about us!\" cried Rosebud. \"Hey over here!\" shouted Molly from the top of the hill. \"Hey get back in the cage and lock yourself up!\" ordered Deceptor. Razor lunged at Shasta but missed. \"Would you prefer I eat you right away or eat your friends first?\" \"Or I could run; that way I'll let you live\" joked Shasta. \"Your crazy, you know that?\" \"I like running\". Shasta continued running from Death's shots and Razer's blows. Buddy spotted a nearly broken,skinny tree on top of the hill and pushed it so it would fall down. The tree fell and went into Razor for fell down and crashed into Deceptor. Shasta ran to meet with the Buddies. Buddy and Molly joined them. \"Quick we need to escape!\"cried Buddy. But it was too late the raptors had surrounded them, encircling their prey. \"Now it's all over, you had us on quick the chase didn't you?\" said an annoyed Razor. \"Yeah now let's eat them before they destroy that alien guy!\" demanded Deceptor. \"Ok now I know these dudes have got the wrong pups\" said Mudbud. \"Where did you get an idea like that?\" Buddha asked them. \"From me!\" interrupted Death. \"You see a wise old alien predicted my leader's downfall at the hands of five golden retriever puppies who recently got fame you got fame by landing on the moon. Which is why Rosebud, Dark Blade tricked you into coming here!\" \"Rosebud what's he talking about?\" asked B-dawg. Rosebud was wondering herself before remembering what happened on Valentines day. Razor began sniffing. \"I smell lots of dogs and humans,close!\" \"Hmm it's time to create a diversion, you finish them of and i'll buy you time to escape\" ordered Death as he walked into the forest. All of Ferntiuktuk's dogs, led by the lead husky and Deputy Bernie ran past the forest and began barking, they were followed by everyone else. \"I don't believe what i'm seeing!\" gasped the sheriff. Everyone began gasping and murmuring to each other. Razor and Deceptor shrieked at them, making them step back. \"I hate it when your right\" Paul whispered to Jean George, who was no longer the madman everyone thought he was. \"Puppies run to the forest!\" yelled Bernie. \"This way everyone!\" commanded Buddy and they ran into the thick tree's. Death broke into Jean's cabin in and saw the fireplace. \"It's time for some flames!\" he cackled before using his blaster to blow up the fire place. The fire then began spreading around the entire house and then made it's way towards the tree's. The wind from the storm was making the fire spread even more and because the storm was now mostly just wind, the snow had little effect to stop it. Snow on the tree's did however stop some of the flames. \"Look!\" shouted one citizen pointing to the smoke from the forest. \"It must be Death's diversion!\" realised Deceptor. \"I'v had enough of these puppies!\" roared Razor. \"I'm going to annihilate them all!\". The two raptors ran into the forest and split up to search. \"Quick call the emergency services!\" demanded Paul, as he dodged a scorched branch falling. The sheriff took out his phone and dialled the number. The Buddies were running in the through the forest trying to avoid the fire. Suddenly two flaming tree's fell down, separating them. Buddha and B-dawg were left near the destroyed house while Mudbud and Budderball were stuck in a area where there was broken trees. Buddy and Molly managed to reach a area where the snow had stopped most of the fire. Shasta and Rosebud were trapped at the end of the forest near the mountain, followed by Razor. Death spotted B-dawg and Buddha running. \"I'm ending this now!\" he thought to himself. \"If I don't get back to Inspiron the offensive is doomed to fail!\".[Chapter 18] Mudbud and Budderball were by themselves in the centre of the burning cabin. \"What do we do?\" cried Mudbud. \"Hey I can smell stake!\" Budderball sniffed. He saw a burnt stake up a bent over tree and jumped on to it,using the technique Talon had taught them. Mudbud followed him and after getting to the top of the bent over tree, Budderball saw the burnt stake. \"I can't eat this!\" he whined. \"Noooooo!\" \"Bro, this is no time to think about food!\" said Mudbud. Deceptor sniffed his way towards the house. He looked up and spotted the two golden puppies. \"Ah, so your up there!\" he growled. \"Er Mudbud, I think that raptor can smell food more easily than I can\" gulped Budderball. \"Let's get out of here!\" \"We can't go down he'll get us for sure, just try to climb to tree next to this and don't go near the flames!\" instructed Mudbud. The bent over tree was leaning against a larger tree and the puppies began climbing up and jumping on some thick branches. Deceptor climbed up as well. \"You can't escape!\" huffed Deceptor. Budderball and Mudbud crawled towards the final branch of the tree. \"What now?\" yelped Budderball. Mudbud spotted a tree a few metres in from which was covered in snow, which seemed to have stopped the flames from spreading. \"Were gonna have to jump to that branch in front of us\" \"Are you crazy?! shouted Budderball. \"No way am I jumping, I'm scared of heights and look at all the fire below us, if we fall... \"Budderball, the blue raptor is right behind us we have to!\" coughed Mudbud, as Deceptor made it to the top. \"No where to run now!\" he laughed. The two bravely took a step back and then ran and jumped as far as they could. Budderball's eyes were shut. Mudbud made it to the other side and grabbed his brother by the tail and pulled him back up. \"Come on, through the hole in the tree!\" ordered Mudbud. \"Oh, my tummy\" Budderball groaned. They ran down the tree through a hole at the top and came out through the trunk at the bottom. \"Ha you think you can out-smart me!\" shouted Deceptor. He jumped across and landed on the branch but because of how heavy he was, and the tree was collapsing anyway, when blue raptor landed on it the entire tree toppled over and landed in the fire below. B-dawg and Buddha were running through the burning forest, choosing paths which weren't on fire. \"where's the others!?\" screamed B-dawg. \"This is not ok!\" \"B-dawg calm down we'll get out\" Buddha tried to calm his scared brother. \"It's getting dark, the cold will put out the flames\". \"Well it is a beautiful night to die\" laughed Death, waving his hands about. \"Uh-oh, run!\" panicked B-dawg, running away while Buddha tried to catch up to him. Death's cackling followed them. Suddenly, an ice bomb hit him. Death was standing in front of him pointing his blaster directly at him. He walked closer. \"You puppies thought you cute looks could always make you win!\" he goaded.\"Do you fear death? You seem awfully calm for someone who facing it\". Death was trying to frighten the young puppy. \"Confronting ones fear only makes you stronger\" preached the Zen pup, he was suddenly feeling very cold, almost like he was catching a cold. B-dawg stopped running and turned around. \"Buddha!\" he yelled,running back. \"I find it hard to believe a solider like me is having trouble finding a bunch of puppies!\" Death shouted. \"That was an ice bomb designed to make you feel really cold\". \"Answer me one thing\" demanded Buddha.\"You are not from Earth why do you want us gone, why are you here?\" \"You puppies get quite the attention it seem's like the humans treat you better than they treat each other\" snarled the phantom. \"Well you got more attention last month and it was sensed by forces you cannot possibly imagine and they have not reacted kindly to this, and like all threats you can be stopped!\" B-dawg bravely ran up towards him and bit his leg allowing Buddha to run out of his firing range. \"AHH, let go of me you mangy mut!\" yelled the creepy spectre. \"You have tested my patience, now your all gonna die!\" A petrified B-dawg quickly let go and joined his brother who was in front of a tree with a large hole in the trunk. \"Yo let's hide in here!\" he whimpered as Death stopped to re-load his blasters. Behind the phantom was a burning tree, close to collapse. \"No\" replied Buddha. \"B-dawg I need you to be brave for this, you always boast saying you are\" \"I will haunt you forever, creeping around every corner, you cannot escape!\" cackled the evil phantom. \"I know you live in Fernfield and I'm sure your owners won't mind me dropping in!\" Of course he was lying he couldn't actually show himself to anyone he was just trying to scare them into giving up. \"But Buddha I think you know i'm not brave, no one even thinks I am, it's not boasting its lying!\" B-dawg admitted. \"Well, Bell doesn't think that\" Buddha reminded him. Death took out his blasters and B-dawg slowly came out of the hole in the tree trunk. The burning tree was falling. \"Ok you win\" Buddha sneakily told him. \"So trying to scare me with fire eh?!\" Death yelled, thinking the trap involved the fire. He activated his phantom mode, to avoid the flames, and charged towards tree behind him collapsed and fell towards the three. \"NOW RUN!\" ordered Buddha just as Death de-activated his phantom mode and was prepared to fire his blasters's. \"DIE...AHHHHHHH!\" he screeched as the tree fell into him. Buddha and B-dawg ran. Death fired one ice bomb at them,which hit B-dawg. The two puppies stopped and looked and saw nothing but a burning tree on the floor and purple mist surrounding it. The greatest commander in galactic history had been defeated by six puppies; the ideology of Death's species revolved around thinking how superior they are to others and now their greatest leader had been tricked and defeated by those they claimed were inferior- ironic. \"W-where's that skeleton ghost thing?\" whimpered B-dawg who was shivering because he was scared. \"I don't know, it's like he just vanished\" panted Buddha who was sitting down to rest. \"Yo dawg this is no time to rest we got's to find the others and get out of here\" coughed B-dawg.. The snow began putting out the fire and fire brigades had arrived. The lead husky and a few other dogs also arrived. \"Relax you are safe now puppies\" he told them. Deputy Bernie then arrived with fire fighters, the Buddies parents, Mudbud and Budderball. \"I'm so glad your safe\" said a relieved Buddy. \"Wait where's Rosebud!?\" cried Molly. They all stopped to hear the loud roars of Razer but burning trees were blocking their way. \"Oh no Rosebud!\" cried Buddy, running ahead. But the lead husky stopped him. \"No you cant the fire is too thick, we need to wait till the fire is put out!\" he advised. Razer's roars plagued the sky, getting louder and angrier. \"But my daughter is in trouble now!\" protested Air bud. On Drex's ship a hologram of Dark Anthem, a commander who was working for the same planet Death and Blade did and who was leading their invasion of other planets came on the projector. \"Drex I- he started before realising he wasn't there. \"Blade whats going on, where's Death!?\" \"I don't know, you mean he's not there!?\" gasped Dark Blade. \"Where is he?\" demanded Anthem. \"He left to eliminate five puppies that pose a threat to Drex, a plan masterminded by your's truly\" explained Blade. \"HE'S THE ONLY ONE WHO HAS THE PLAN TO FINISH THE ASSAULT WITHOUT HIM WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING!\" thundered Dark Anthem. \"All of this because of five puppies?\" \"Well...it's six now\" joked Blade. \"Oh that makes me feel better\" he sarcastically replied. \"I'm left with no plan, no reinforcements and I could use some assistance\". Anthem turned of his communication. \"No impossible they'v ruined everything!\" he shouted to himself. Dark Blade thought about what to do before finally deciding.[Chapter 19] Rosebud and Shasta managed to escape the fiery forest and were trapped on the other side of it. All they could see was some small mountains and what seemed like an endless, icy cold ocean. \"I think we took the wrong path\" realised Rosebud. \"Hmm maybe we can- began Shasta. He was interrupted by a angry, loud roar from Razer. \"Uh-oh we better hide!\" screamed Rosebud, running behind a small mountain. Shasta followed her just as Razer sniffed his way towards them. \"Come out, I know your here!\" he ordered. He looked around and couldn't see anyone. The two puppies tried not to sweat from fear, otherwise the raptor could sniff them out. \"There is no escape, the forest is on fire and your family is probably captured too!\" the evil raptor cackled. Shasta snuck towards a icy, large rock and Rosebud followed him. \"Your an idiot for listening to Dark Blade\" he called out to Rosebud. \"They have decreed a death warrant upon you and destroy you I shall!\" He picked up their scent and jumped on top of the rock. \"AHH!\" the two pup's screamed, running as fast as they could. Razer gave chase, all three were trying not to slip on the ice. \"Look, i'm sorry I accidentally released you but you can't blame me for that\" Shasta tried apologising to him. \"OF COURSE I CAN YOU SET US FREE AND CAUSED CLAW TO PERISH!\" he screamed lunging towards them. The two puppies used Talon's training to jump over him and run. They found another small mountain and hid behind it. \"Rosebud he's here for you, hide in this cave while I lead him away\" whispered Shasta. \"What? No you can't go up against that thing!\" argued Rosebud. \"I know what I need to do\" promised Shasta. \"You don't need to do anything we can just keep running\". \"To where, we're at the edge of the ocean; he's blocking the only escape?\" Shasta ran ahead while Rosebud hid inside the cave, shivering. \"I will remember this day as the day dog sled racing finally ends\" jeered Razer. \"I believe you missed the almost in that sentence\" said Shasta. Razer lunged at him, and continued striking his claws at him, whilst Shasta backed away each time, dodging them. \"Where is the golden puppy?\" he demanded. Shasta backed away towards two small grave stones buried into the snow. Joe had made two small graves for Shasta's parents in this area so he could remember his loyal dogs. \"I have waited ten years for this moment!\" \"I was just born; what happened was not my fault!\" Razer growled before leaping in front of the two gravestones and glared at the names. He picked up the medal Joe won but had placed on the grave of his dogs. \"It is now\" he grinned. Shasta angrily jumped up and grabbed it from his claws, using his teeth and began walking back quickly. Razer roared and approached him, swinging his claws as hard as possible, enraged. \"Everything I did was all because of you! While you were up there in the spotlight I was locked in the dark!\" roared Razer, finally sending his heavy foot into the ice, smashing it. The quake caused Shasta to loose his balance and he slipped and landed on his back, next to the cave. Razer approached him. \"Y-your right it is my fault\" the poor husky coughed. \"I'm sorry\". Razer's expression slightly changed, before returning to it's evil look. \"I don't want an apology I want the puppies!\" Razer looked inside the cave and saw nothing. \"What were is she?!\" He got his claws ready to strike Shasta when two snowballs landed on him. He turned around and saw Rosebud. \"And here I thought the only thing animals cared about was their next meal\" Razer grunted. \"As much as I would like to end you now, I will follow my orders first\". Razer lunged at Rosebud, who screamed and ran behind the huge mountain, where nothing but vast amount of sea was before her. \"You save each other instead of saving yourselves? You dogs are confusing\". \"Y-y-you won't get away with this my b-b-brothers have probably stopped your leader and now e-e-everyone knows about you\" stammered Rosebud, stalling, whilst slightly moving back towards the edge of the ice. \"Very well, if I go down I'm taking you with me, both literally and figuratively!\" promised the raptor as he charged towards her, despite the fact that he knew he will fall into the water. Rosebud tried moving out the way, but the huge raptor knocked straight into her, making them both fall into the ocean. She screamed and tried grabbing hold of the edges. In the crystal caves the wise alien suddenly gasped. \"What is it?\" asked Drex. \"I sense something horrible is happening, there is flames everywhere and death lurking around every corner!\" she cried. \"Do you mean death death or are you talking about Death?\" asked a confused MONK-E. \"It must be the raptor's they'v stopped those puppies!\" hoped Drex. \"No, no no!\" the wise alien replied. \"The vision is being clouded!\" The guard then came back in the cave. \"I know you told me to wait outside but Anthem just called and said reinforcements have arrived and are stopping the assault, Death isn't there either!\" he informed his leader. \"Something weird is going on, come on were heading back to the ship now!\" ordered Drex. \"Rosebud!\" cried Shasta, as he ran and helped her up. Razer put his head forward, showing his sharp teeth and targeted Rosebud. Shasta ran forward, held Rosebud back and scratched the raptor on his other eye Razer growled and prepared to finish them both. \"You see my face, your life is done!\" he shrieked and before he knew it, him and Shasta were back in the same position they were all those years ago, with him lashing out to grab him and failing. Suddenly Talon had rushed out towards the raptor just as he grabbed the two pups by their tails. He flung himself into the raptor and hurled him towards the ocean. \"Get out of my way, you old fool!\" he shouted,kicking him out the way before drowning in the deep water. Talon turned towards the two exhausted puppies. \"Talon...your...alive?\" panted Shasta. Talon nodded. \"I escaped and when I saw the flames, I knew it was my duty to help.\" Rosebud lay down on the snow and Shasta lay next to her. They were both tired, sweating and panting deeply. \"You pup's should be proud you freed Alaska from a dark curse\" Talon congratulated them. \"So why are you sad, Shasta?\" \"It's just the raptor's didn't wan't to be here so it's not really their fault\" he admitted. \"Raptor's are predators it's in their nature just like it's in your's to be with your owners who I believe are waiting for you\" said the wise dog. \"Once again you surprise me,Talon\" echoed a deep voice. A hologram of Dark Blade appeared in front of them. \"This was a good plan, and i'v worked on a lot of plans so I should know, but THIS was so... different and I was defeated so i'v come to congratulate you\". \"Hey your that creature which appeared to me in the hall of mirrors\" realised Rosebud. \"I'm guessing your not a good spirit like you said you are\". \"No, little puppy, I am not and you can forget asking me about why and who is behind this\" snarled the phantom. \"I knew I could trick you, you were saying how much you missed this little husky\". Shasta looked at Rosebud, who began turning red. \"Blade, there is no place for evil like you, the curtains have fallen on your stage\" Talon demanded, remembering when he crashed in Alaska and was helped by Talon, before he knew he was evil. \"And it was a pity I wasn't there myself, my old friend\" replied Dark Blade, before his hologram turned of. \"Come along, pup's your owners are waiting\" said Talon.[Chapter 20] (yes I have a habit of using Spyro OST names but can you blame me, they have such emotional titles) Outside the burnt forest, where emergency services were everywhere the puppies owners were waiting. \"Where's the Buddies?\" wondered Alice. Just then all of the dogs came out of the forest with fire-fighters and Talon, Rosebud and Shasta ran out later. Deputy Bernie ran up to Sheriff Ryan. \"Good dog, Bernie!\" he congratulated him. The Buddies parent's ran up to Noah and Henry while the Buddies ran up to their owners. Shasta ran towards Adam's dad. \"Well done, pipsqueaks!\" cheered Francois. Buddy hugged his daughter. \"Rosebud, I'm so glad your safe\". \"Well we had some help\" revealed Mudbud, staring at Talon. \"It was my honour\" replied Talon. \"Is this that legendary dog you told us about?\" asked a very excited Air bud. \"You are quite the legend yourself\" said Talon. \"je ne crois pas!\" cried Francois saying \"I don't believe it\" in French. \"It is Talon the great!\" \"Unbelievable!\" shouted the lead husky. \"See, I knew he was real!\" lied Snow. \"No you didn't\" corrected Phillipe. \"Sounds just like you, B-dawg\" laughed Mudbud. \"Hey what's wrong with B-dawg and Buddha?\" \"N-nothing m-m-much\" shuddered B-dawg. Him and Buddha still were feeling terribly cold ,thanks to Death and his ice bombs, after their encounter with the evil phantom, were to scared to talk. They were laying down and resting next to their mum while their owners were ordered to stay behind the police cars. Medical workers came over to the two puppies and decided to take them to the ambulance to check them out. \"It seems like the Buddies truly have gown; lets just never do anything like this ever again\" said a relieved Buddy. \"So it seems everyone is happy- except for one\" added Talon, staring at Shasta. The pup was looking at his reflection in the ice, sadly. A lot of stuff had been revealed to him and it was hard not to have any parents- unlike the Buddies- to ask him if he was ok. \"Jeez, what a broken soul\" joked Cotton. \"Well this 'broken soul' just saved dog sled racing\" said Talon. The other huskies cheered- they could finally return to doing their favourite thing. Paul then turned to Jean George. \"Well, I think I owe you an apology, Jean\" he admitted. \"I think we ALL do\" added Sheriff Ryan. \"If there's anything we can do just ask\". \"Yeah whatever\" snapped Jean. \"Just say dog sled racing is back on and we'll call it even\". \"Yeah you got it but remember no cheating\" said Ryan before turning to the teacher and the kids. \"Anyway the plane is coming in an hour you should take the class to the airport and wait and it was great seeing you and of course it was great seeing the Buddies again\". Later at the airport a plane was waiting to go, the class was waiting in newly created restaurant. The Buddies decided to sneak of and say goodbye to Shasta. The Buddies were once again sadly saying goodbye to their Alaskan husky friend. \"Well once again we had a dangerous adventure but it was fun because I got to see you again\" said Shasta. \"Thanks for coming all this way just to see me\". \"Shasta it was great seeing you again!\" Rosebud told him. \"Guess he doesn't know about your crush\" giggled B-dawg, who was feeling much better now. Shasta chortled slightly. \"Anyway Shasta i'll really miss you, you were snow cool!\" \"Whenever it snows i'll always think of you, Shasta, Namaste\" said Buddha, sadly. \"You know a wolf once told us that if you howl then you won't forget about each other, maybe you should try it\". \"Dude remember to hang loose and have fun!\" Mudbud reminded him. \"Too bad we didn't get to taste any food from that Italian restaurant\" groaned Budderball.\"But i'm definitely gonna miss you Shasta your the best-est friend we'v ever had!\" \"Thank you Shasta for helping our puppies survive\" thanked Air bud. \"Aw he's so adorable I think blue eyes suits him\" said Molly. \"Er...thanks\" Shasta awkwardly replied, feeling a bit embarrassed. The kids then came over and asked them to go in the cargo hold. \"Woah your dogs are cool!\" complimented the bully, Rodney. \"Yeah those guys are awesome!\" added his friend, Skip. \"Thanks and yes they are awesome\" replied Noah. \"I can't wait to see Josh's face when I tell him about this\". The seven Buddies went inside the cargo hold. From the window they could see Shasta barking \"goodbye\" to them. The plane took of and headed towards Fernfield. On Drex's warship, the three had returned from the crystal caves, to see that there was no one there. \"Hello?\" called Drex. \"Blade!? The alien went into the meeting room. \"Anthem are you here?! Death, Blade anyone!?\" \"Sir, it appears no one is here\" said the guard. \"Look sir Death's scanner is offline that means...gasped MONK-E. Drex covered his face and fell back on to his chair. \"Fools i'm surrounded by fools!\" he wailed. \"How could animals do this?\" \"Sir, I know you usually don't like taking my advice, but maybe you should listen to me this time\" pleaded MONK-E. Drex agreed and let MONK-E talk. \"You see this is a classic tale of trying to prevent something from happening but while doing that end up making it happen\". \"Huh?\" \"You sent everyone to stop the prophecy but you instead increased it's chances of happening. I think it would be better if we forget about it, i'm sure were never gonna see these animals again\" \"You... are actually right\" admitted Drex. \"Instead we will look for the rings of Inspiron and try again to conquer the planet and I will rule as emperor!\" \"Who will rule as emperor?\" repeated the guard. \"ME IT IS MY DESTINY!\" vowed Drex. MONK-E then remembered Death's advise and rushed to the computers to delete all information on Earth. Unfortunately, the clumsy alien accidentally deleted the location of the rings, which just so happened to be Earth, and the information on the puppies. \"We shall see Drex...we shall see\". The next day, on Saturday, B-dawg and Buddha were walking around. \"Ok remember my advice\" said Buddha. \"Don't worry when I see Bell i'll act normal and of course be plain awesome me!\" replied B-dawg. While Billy was having a hair cut he looked through the toy shop window and saw a husky plushy that reminded him of Shasta. \"I'm sure gonna miss that cool dawg\" he said to himself. \"Miss who?\" asked a female voice, startling B-dawg. It was Bell who had heard about the Buddies new Alaskan adventure. \"You got's to stop surprising me like that\" giggled B-dawg. \"Why, were you scared?\" \"Me, naw, B-dawg ain't scared of nothing!\" \"Really so you weren't scared of raptors?\" \"Of course not...well maybe just a tiny bit\" he lied. B-dawg took a deep breath before asking her a question. \"Hey...er..are you busy tomorrow evening? he nervously asked. \"No why?\" she replied. \"Well I was wondering if your not doing anything would you like to go to that drive in theatre with me?\" \"Sure, why not?\" \"Oh well...wait you said YES?!\" cried B-dawg. \"Yes\" Bell laughed. \"Well I think I can hear my owner calling, see you tomorrow\" Buddha met up with him. \"Thank's Buddha for that advice you gave before, that's why your my main pup, dawg!\" said B-dawg. \"Well done B-dawg\" Buddha congratulated him. Later at night the Buddies all howled at each other from their separate homes, remembering what the Wolf had told them. Air Bud and Molly heard and howled to. In Alaska, Shasta decided to do a small howl,remembering what the Buddies said, which was repeated by Deputy Bernie, who was with Francois and Phillipe and finally by Talon the great. Although Buddha was still awake, thinking about what Death had told him, he eventually fell asleep. They were unable to figure out that mystery and never did. The end \"So what happened to Drex, Blade, Anthem and Death?\" asked a slim adult husky to Talon the great, as they observed the Northern lights. \"And the Buddies, are they ok? Did Drex... \"Ah that is an interesting question that I do not know the answer to\" replied Talon. \"It has been a long time, I am unsure if the pup's are even alive...although I'm confident that they are.\" \"I have never heard of these 'Air buddies', dogs talk of Air bud, but not of his puppies\". Talon walked forward and looked up at the Northern Lights glistening in the sky, that he believed carried the souls of every dog. \"So, young pup's, where are you now?\" ","Summary":" This story is had been updated as of 19/03/17. The main plot will be the same but some of the dialo"},{"Movie":"Air Bud","Title":"Patch and the Air Buddies","Author":"PerkyGoth14","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11596387","Passage":"[Chapter 1] A/N: Based on an RP back in late September... Read & Review It had been quiet for a while, nothing really had happened much lately. The legendary, 'golden receiver', Air Bud had met the love of his life who had moved in across the street and her name was Molly. Eventually, Buddy and Molly were blessed with five adorable puppies. Patch was visiting the Brown household, they were all playing with Junior in the backyard, but then Mo came over to them. \"Mo, what is it?\" Angel asked. \"Buddy and Molly just had their puppies,\" Mo informed. \"Five!\" \"How can someone possibly give birth to five pups while still living?\" Patch asked. \"Molly apparently found a way.\" Mo shrugged with a smile. \"Molly and Buddy must be lucky to have puppies.\" Angel said. \"Having puppies is a very wonderful thing.\" Colette added. \"Yeah, someone to play with all day everyday!\" Danielle chuckled. \"Oh, there's much more than that,\" Angel looked to her sister-in-law. \"You have to look out for them, give them all your attention, guide them, help them grow...\" \"Like I did with Junior.\" Mo said before looking to her adoptive younger brother with a smile. \"Do you think that they might need someone to watch over their pups when they need some alone time and also visits with the pups?\" Patch asked. \"He also wants to learn about experience with being responsible with puppies before we have our own.\" Colette said. \"I'm sure Buddy and Molly would appreciate that.\" Mo smiled to Patch with his dedication of being a future father. \"Well, I just want to have the experience with the responsibility before we have our own,\" Patch said placing his left paw on Colette's right paw. \"It's what he wants.\" Colette added with a smile, she believed in him. \"We'll let the puppies get to know their parents a bit better, once they get settled, you can go over.\" Mo informed the Dalmatian puppy. \"Thank you, Mo.\" Patch said with a smile. \"Of course... I just love dogs...\" Mo smiled fondly. \"We know.\" Patch said with a smile. The other dogs chuckled to her. Mo picked up Junior. \"Come on, time for a nap.\" \"But I'm not...\" Junior pouted to her, then let out a very sleepy yawn. \"Tired...\" \"Yes, you are.\" Colette said. \"No, I'm not...\" Junior frowned. Mo still carried him inside. \"Oh, come on, Junior, it's only an hour...\" \"Seven hours for us...\" Scamp muttered slightly. \"I heard that.\" Junior said. The dogs hid soft laughs. Mo sighed, then carried Junior upstairs to their bedroom. \"Kids, what are you going to do?\" Patch asked with a shrug. \"You just raise them and hope for the best, at least that's what I heard.\" Angel replied. \"Yeah.\" Scamp added in. \"I wanna teach mine how to chase cats, eat shoes, and slobber all over their humans if they get adopted!\" Danielle laughed out loud as always. \"And I'm sure that those skills will be useful whenever they are wanting to have some fun around the house.\" Patch said. \"You need to be responsible with children, Danielle, not just playing all the time,\" Mo looked to the white-collared puppy, folding her arms and leaning against the door-frame. \"You remind me of Pinkie Pie the first time she looked after the Cake twins.\" \"Really?\" Danielle asked. \"What happened while she was watching over the Cake twins?\" \"She thought it'd be all fun and games, but she had to learn the hard way, yes, raising a child can be tough, but it's all worth it.\" Mo explained. \"Ohh.\" Danielle said. \"Anyways, I can't wait to meet the Buddies.\" Patch said. \"Buddies?\" Mo asked. \"I'm gonna call them that,\" Patch looked back. \"The puppies of Air Bud, so I'm gonna call them 'Air Buddies'.\" Scamp chuckled. \"That's pretty clever, Patch.\" \"Yeah and I just know that they're going to like you.\" Colette nuzzled her mate. \"I hope you're right.\" Patch nuzzled back. Angel and Scamp joined together then as well. \"Ugh, Puppy Love, disgusting!\" Danielle groaned and walked off, leaving her siblings to their lovers. \"Aw, she's just jealous.\" Colette said. \"That's just Danielle for ya, one of the boys though,\" Scamp shook his head. \"She always looked up to me.\" \"So did I...\" Colette admitted. \"I just didn't want Annette to know... You know how fickle she was back then.\" \"Yeah, I know.\" Scamp said. 'I wonder of how the Buddies will look like when they're old enough to walk and talk.' Patch thought to himself. Mo decided to go inside. Patch was anxious about meeting the puppies, but Mo promised to take him over to Buddy and Molly's as soon as they would be ready. It felt like it would take forever. Darla was meanwhile spending more time with Urchin, he could not stay on land too long, but Triton allowed him to spend as long as twelve hours with the girl in order to spend more time with her. They have been getting really close lately. \"We sure have been spending a lot of time together, Darla.\" Urchin told her. \"Yeah...\" Darla kicked her legs slightly. \"We're growing up.\" \"And you look as beautiful as ever.\" Urchin smiled to her. Darla smiled back, her hair was now short and slightly curly, no longer wearing the curly curls that thousands of people adored, she no longer wore bows, and she dressed more like a teenage girl, even if she was almost a teenager now. \"I'm just so lucky to have a girlfriend like you.\" Urchin smiled at her. Darla blushed. \"Girlfriend?\" \"Well, if you want to be that is...\" Urchin smiled back, flashing his copper eyes to her. \"O-Of course I'd like to be your girlfriend.\" Darla said with a smile. The two smiled to each other, they then leaned in to have their first kiss. Patch came in the middle though, interrupting them, though not meaning to. \"When is Mo gonna call?\" he whined. \"It's been forever now!\" \"Patch!\" Darla groaned. \"What's going on?\" Urchin asked. \"Mo said she would call as soon as I could see Buddy and Molly's puppies and she hasn't called!\" Patch explained, being more hyper and active now ever since he was a puppy. \"Don't worry, of when she calls, we'll let you know.\" Darla told him. \"Ugh...\" Patch groaned, then climbed off the couch. \"Sorry about that.\" Darla said to her new boyfriend. \"Never mind that, now where were we?\" Urchin asked eagerly. \"I believe we were about to kiss.\" Darla reminded him. \"Oh, yeah...\" Urchin smirked. Darla and Urchin then got back into position, about to have their first official kiss as a couple. And where Patch didn't seem to interrupt them this time it seemed like they were actually going to get their first kiss. Patch was pacing frantically. The phone rang and Emily answered it. \"Hello...?\" she greeted, then smiled fondly. \"Really? Well, hang on... Patch, you have a phone call!\" Patch looked puzzled and walked over. \"Who would call me on the telephone?\" Emily lowered the phone to him. \"Um... Hi?\" Patch answered. 'Patch, Buddy and Molly say you can come over...' Mo's voice told him. \"Wahoo! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!\" Patch howled out of excitement. Emily and Mo laughed a little then. 'Come over when you're ready, but I suggest you get breakfast first.' Mo replied. \"Thank you so much, Mo!\" Patch smiled. \"You're the best human ever!\" 'Okay, okay, just get breakfast first and then come over to Buddy and Molly.' Mo replied. Atticus came downstairs once after he had heard his Dalmatian's excitement and wanted to find out what was going on. \"Buddy and Molly invited me over to meet the puppies!\" Patch cheered to Atticus, his tail wagging in the air. \"That's great news, buddy.\" Atticus said before ruffling the top of the Dalmatian's head. Patch chuckled. \"Your breakfast is ready, but eat slowly, eating too fast is unhealthy.\" Atticus advised, knowing how excited Patch was. \"Fine, but I just wanna meet the Buddies so badly.\" Patch said. \"We know, but don't worry, they're not going anywhere.\" Emily laughed a little. Darla walked into the kitchen with Urchin. \"I haven't seen him this excited since Puppy School.\" \"Yeah, he must really want to see those puppies.\" Patrick said as he came in from the kitchen. \"I'll say.\" Atticus added with a chuckle. Emily served her family their late breakfast and even saved some for Urchin. \"Thank you, ma'am.\" Urchin said, politely. \"Of course.\" Emily smiled to him. Patch finished his breakfast. \"Done!\" He then rushed out the door to meet the puppies. \"Should we stop him?\" Darla frowned slightly. \"Nah, I think if we do, he'll just drag us along while trying to get to the puppies, besides, he has the same strength as me.\" Atticus told her.[Chapter 2] Patch memorized the way to Buddy and Molly's place and tried to get there as fast as he could. \"Oh, I can't wait to meet the Buddies, I bet they'll look like their parents.\" Patch said, excitedly, while making his way to Buddy and Molly's house. Just as Patch came, the golden retriever family was just about to eat themselves. \"He should be here in three... Two... One.\" Buddy said before pointing to the front door. Patch burst through their dog door and nearly slid on the floor, then came. \"Hello, Patch.\" Molly greeted. \"Hello,\" Patch smiled. \"Well, where are they?\" \"Come with me,\" Molly led him to the kitchen just as the 'Air Buddies' were about to have their own breakfast. \"You sure didn't take your time getting here.\" she giggled. \"Sorry, I was just eager to meet them...\" Patch smiled. \"Anything for an old friend.\" Buddy smiled back. The five puppies were eating from their bowls, quietly and politely, except for one, who seemed hungrier than his brothers and sister. \"Yikes, he seems to like to eat food a whole lot more than his brothers and sisters.\" Patch said after noticing. Molly chuckled. \"Yes, Budderball has quite the healthy appetite...\" Buddy then took Patch to each of the puppies. \"You've already met Budderball, now, this is B-Dawg,\" he introduced his son with a silver chained collar with a B on it, then came to the puppy with a pebble collar. \"And this is Buddha, our very spiritual and content one,\" he then walked to the puppy with a blue handkerchief as a collar and seemed a little dirty. \"This is MudBud...\" He then walked to the puppy with a pink ribbon in her fur. \"And here's our littlest and specialest one... Rosebud.\" \"So, then, you call them the Buddies, right?\" Patch asked. \"Yeah, how'd you know?\" Buddy asked. \"Lucky guess...\" Patch chuckled. The puppies ate their food, once they finished, they came to meet Patch. \"You know our parents, sir?\" Rosebud asked, seeming to have a puppy crush on the Dalmatian. \"I sure do I've known them since I was a pup.\" Patch told them. \"That's totally awesome, dude.\" MudBud said. \"Yeah, totally!\" B-Dawg added. \"I hope we can become friends too.\" Patch said to the golden puppies, who happily agreed. \"As long as we get a snack on the way.\" Budderball added. Patch chuckled. \"You remind me of my brother Rolly, he was always hungry, even after dinner.\" \"Sounds like my kind of guy.\" Budderball said. The others chuckled to him then. \"Anyways, tell me about yourselves.\" Patch said to the Buddies. Buddy and Molly smiled as the puppies came closer to Patch. \"One at a time... One at a time...\" Patch chuckled as they all tried to speak to him at once. \"How about you?\" He looked to Rosebud. \"Ladies first.\" Rosebud blushed to that and cleared her throat. \"Well, I'm the youngest, which means I'm the favorite!\" This caused for her brothers to groan out of annoyance. \"It's true!\" Rosebud looked to them. \"Parents love all their children equally.\" Patch informed. \"How about this, Rosebud?\" Buddy walked over. \"You can be our favorite daughter.\" \"Yes, our favorite daughter.\" Molly added. \"See?\" Rosebud grinned in victory, not noticing the irony yet. \"I'm the favorite daughter!\" \"But, isn't she your only daughter?\" Patch whispered to Buddy and Molly. Buddy and Molly nodded, that's why they had said it anyway. Patch quietly chuckled. \"By the way, how hard is it to get MudBud in the tub?\" he asked. Buddy hid a laugh. \"So hard it makes me glad I'm not human.\" \"And I thought I was a fussy puppy to get clean.\" Molly added. \"Wow, the pup sure loves to stay dirty.\" Patch said, referring to MudBud. Buddah went upstairs. \"Where's he going?\" Patch wondered. \"Probably looking for an after breakfast snack.\" B-Dawg suggested. \"Or he could be looking for a place to meditate.\" Rosebud guessed. \"Yikes, even that bowl is dirty.\" Patch noticed Mudball's bowl. \"Don't let my pretty looks fool ya, by the way,\" Rosebud came up to Patch. \"I'm just as fiesty as my brothers!\" \"I'll take your word for it.\" Patch said. \"The Buddies are growing up fast...\" Molly sighed. \"Indeed, I wonder if they'll like sports.\" Buddy wondered thoughtfully. \"Yeah, but we'll have to see.\" Patch said. \"We appreciate you helping to look after the Buddies, especially with basketball season and all.\" Buddy said to Patch in gratitude. \"No problem, Buddy, besides, this way, I can get experience with puppies before becoming a father.\" Patch said. \"I'm sure you'd make a wonderful father, Patch.\" Molly soothed him with an honest and sincere smile. \"I know, I-I just want to make sure that I'm ready when they come.\" Patch told them. \"It can be pretty scary, but trust me, you will do just wonderfully,\" Buddy reassured. \"Look at what you did for Flo's puppies when they had to stay at that old church and had no chances of being adopted.\" \"Well, they did need their own owners, but one of them was adopted by Strudel.\" Patch said. \"I remember that, that was so nice of you to let happen,\" Molly looked admirable to Patch. \"Look at you, first you're one of 101 Dalmatians... Then you're one of a kind with Thunderbolt himself. \"Next, you're a Pound Puppy, and now you're the 'dogfather' of the Air Buddies.\" \"Yeah, a lot has happened to me since Atticus became my owner.\" Patch said with a smile. \"I bet you're very proud of yourself.\" Molly smiled. \"Mom, can we play with Patch?\" Budderball asked after he had found a shoe. \"Sure, that way you can all get to know each other better.\" Molly happily accepted. \"So, what do you wanna play, Budderball?\" Patch asked. \"I wanna play football!\" Budderball jumped. \"No way, we're playing volleyball!\" MudBud argued. \"Why don't we...\" Patch said before getting interrupted by B-Dawg. \"No way, dudes, we're so doin' basketball!\" B-Dawg insisted. \"No way, guys, we're going to play soccer!\" Rosebud argued. \"Well, I know who they take after...\" Molly giggled to her mate. \"I have a pretty good idea where.\" Patch smirked playfully at Buddy. Buddy rolled his eyes slightly to them. \"How about we play soccer for now?\" Patch suggested. The Buddies looked to each other and actually all agreed on soccer because he suggested it. \"Wow, that was an easy compromise,\" Patch said. \"Let's do it outside, so then, we won't break anything in here.\" \"I'll be right back.\" Rosebud told them, then dashed off to get her toy soccer ball. \"So let me guess, Buddha is the one that likes to play baseball, right?\" Patch asked. \"Yeah, when he's not meditating with Noah's mom.\" Buddy replied. \"Wow, so he's kind of like the baseball player/monk in the family.\" Patch guessed. \"You could say that.\" Molly smiled. Rosebud came back with her ball, and then the Buddies raced her outside in the backyard. Patch smiled and went to go join them, very anxious and eager to play with them.[Chapter 3] \"Alright, time to pick teams.\" Rosebud said once they were in the backyard. \"Boys against girls!\" B-Dawg challenged. \"That's not fair!\" Rosebud snarled at him. \"Don't worry, Rose, I'll be on your team.\" Patch soothed. \"Yay!\" Rosebud cheered. \"But, we have to make it fair for both sides having the same amount of team members.\" Patch told them. Patch went next to Rosebud. MudBud decided to have his own team with B-Dawg and Budderball. Buddha joined the others and came to Patch's and Rosebud's team. \"Alright, let's play!\" Rosebud called, setting her ball in the center of the yard. \"Yep and everyone remembers the rules, right?\" Patch asked. \"Of course we do, let's get some play jammin' up in here!\" B-Dawg called. \"And GO!\" Rosebud called. The puppies and Patch then started to play their game, using flowerbeds as goals. The game was a lot of fun for both the Buddies and Patch and where he made sure that he didn't use his full strength, so then it would be fair for the pups. Buddy and Molly smiled fondly as they watched their children at play with their new mentor. And where it seemed like the Buddies were almost competing against each other. Luckily, nothing too serious, it was sports competition. After a while, the game was over with Rosebud, Buddha, and Patch being the winning team. \"Phew... I love a good work out...\" Buddha felt relaxed. Rosebud yawned and stretched. \"Great game, guys.\" \"Yeah, it sure was.\" Budderball said. \"Thanks for playing with us, Mr. Patch.\" MudBud smiled as he relaxed into the dirt, getting filthy yet again. \"You can all just call me Patch.\" the Dalmatian said. \"Okay, Patch.\" MudBud then said as he shook himself, making his siblings flinch in slight disgust. \"We hope you come over again soon, Noah and Dad have a basketball game coming up.\" Buddha informed. \"Of course I'm gonna come over again.\" Patch said. The Buddies smiled to that, really looking forward to it. \"But I bet you five will be happy to have your own owners to play with and have something in common.\" Patch said. \"Have our own owners?\" Rosebud asked. \"Well, yeah, you're gonna have to leave your home sometime.\" Patch explained. \"You mean we can't live with Mom and Dad forever?\" Budderball didn't like the sound of this at all. \"Of course not, because you need to expand from the house that you've been living in for practically your lives.\" Patch said. The Buddies looked sad then. \"Hey now, it's not so bad,\" Patch soothed them. \"I had 98 brothers and sisters, I miss them all a lot, but we call each other all the time.\" \"How?\" Rosebud asked. \"Oh, that's easy, the Twilight Bark.\" Patch smiled. \"The what?\" The Buddies asked. Patch sighed to himself, mumbling slightly. \"Kids these days... The Twilight Bark, it's kind of like our version of the telephone.\" he then informed them. \"Ooohhh...\" the Buddies now understood. \"I'll show it to you sometime, it's always at night since that's when we have more free time, my parents used to do it whenever Roger and Anita walked them,\" Patch explained. \"That's also how we all got reunited when Cruella DeVil, Horace, and Jasper got us.\" \"Was that the time when they kidnapped you and your brothers and sisters?\" Budderball asked. \"Oh, yes...\" Patch nodded. \"I'll never forget that...\" \"It sounds so scary.\" Rosebud said to him. \"It really was, I was just worried we'd never see Mom and Dad again.\" Patch explained. \"But you did see them again.\" MudBud said. \"Oh, definitely, it was just a really scary experience, I hope none of you have to go through that.\" Patch smiled to them. \"I hope so too.\" Rosebud said. Patch smiled and hugged them all. \"You're all so wonderful...\" \"I wanna go on an adventure!\" B-Dawg spoke up. \"It sounds dope, yo!\" \"Well, it can be exciting, but it can also be life-threatening and an experience that you will never ever forget for as long as you live.\" Patch warned. The Buddies smiled, they still liked the sound of it. Patch smiled back to them. \"Um, before you go, maybe you could tell us one?\" Budderball asked. \"Well, alright, I guess one couldn't hurt.\" Patch said. \"Yay!\" The Buddies cheered and gathered around him. \"Just one for now and I'll tell you more until another time.\" Patch said to them before thinking of possible adventures to tell them about. He listed some suggestions for them to hear. \"The one with the Blue Monkey diamond.\" Rosebud suggested. \"Oh, that's a good one.\" Patch chuckled. The Buddies then sat close to him, eager to hear about this adventure and with the Looney Tunes no less! The Buddies hung onto every word that was said as Patch told them of the adventure and where they laughed as soon as he told them that the villain was turned into a monkey. \"Tell me about it,\" Patch laughed with them once he got to the ending. \"I still don't get why he would want the world to be turned into monkeys. And I thought Cruella had problems with her motivation!\" \"I think that guy was crazier than her.\" Budderball said. \"Oh, I dunno...\" Patch chuckled, he then looked at the sky. \"I should probably get home for a little while...\" \"Awww...\" the Buddies groaned. \"There, there, there's always tomorrow.\" Patch said to them with a smile. \"Yeah.\" The Buddies said. \"I promise, I'll come back...\" Patch said to them with a sincere smile. \"Be good now.\" The Buddies said goodbye to him as he went off. \"That was so much fun!\" Budderball laughed. \"Yeah, he's so cool!\" B-Dawg added. \"I hope he comes back soon...\" Rosebud smiled. \"Me too, that dude is cool.\" MudBud said. \"He seems to be one with nature just as well as himself.\" Buddha added. \"I hope that someday we get to go on adventures like Patch does.\" Budderball said, excitedly. \"I hope so too...\" Mudbud laughed. Patch got himself back home and stretched a little with a small yawn. \"How were the Buddies?\" Darla asked as she was relaxing on the couch with a book in her hands. \"I would like to tell you, but I'm exhausted.\" Patch said. \"Yeah, puppies have a lot of energy...\" Darla shrugged and flipped her page. \"Glad you got to have fun though.\" \"I'm glad too.\" Patch said, going upstairs. Darla smiled and went back to her book.[Chapter 4] \"Whew, I forgot how much energy pups have.\" Patch said. He then went for his bed, spun around a little and decided to take a nap until dinner. \"Wow, those pups must have really tuckered him out.\" Atticus said. \"Well, you know how puppies can be.\" Mo shrugged with a smile. \"Yeah.\" Atticus said. \"Let's let him sleep.\" Mo gently shut the door, but to a crack so Patch could get out if he wanted or needed to. \"So, what do you wanna do?\" Atticus asked. Mo shrugged. Cherry walked down the block, playing with her Nintendo 3DS. And where she didn't seem to have bumped into anyone and didn't seem to experience anything strange. \"Hi, Cherry!\" Mo and Atticus greeted. \"Hey, guys...\" Cherry stopped next to them as she played her game, never looking up at them. \"How's the game going?\" Atticus asked. \"This stupid ghost keeps killing me!\" Cherry narrowed her eyes as her fingers did more moving than she did. \"Really? Yikes.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah, I've been stuck on this level since Christmas!\" Cherry frowned. \"Yikes.\" Atticus and Mo said in unison. \"Wanna help?\" Cherry asked. \"Uhh... Sure..\" Mo shrugged. Cherry went to sit down and kept tapping at her 3DS. \"And I thought Bubsy was impossible!\" \"Wow.\" Atticus said. \"Did you hear Buddy had puppies?\" Mo asked. \"Oh, yeah,\" Cherry said as she continued to play. \"How are they?\" \"They're doing great, Patch just came back from their house and is upstairs asleep.\" Atticus told her. \"I could never watch a puppy,\" Cherry said as she played. \"I'm more of a cat person.\" \"Really?\" Atticus asked. \"Why?\" \"Dogs are too jumpy, loud, and slobbery for me...\" Cherry informed. \"And what about cats?\" Atticus asked. \"They're quiet, don't do a whole lot, but still good company.\" Cherry then said. \"Oh, really?\" Atticus asked before showing her videos of many cats doing many things. Cherry looked up, but shrugged and focused back on her game. \"Whatever...\" \"Besides, you like Lady, Tramp, Patch, all of them...\" Mo informed. \"That's because they don't drool over me...\" Cherry explained. \"Like that sheepdog friend of yours...\" \"Oh, yeah...\" Mo chuckled shyly. \"Mooch was always the affectionate one.\" \"That makes sense.\" Atticus said. Mo sighed slightly. \"Sometimes I miss those days... Living in the junkyard, fighting for food... But it's good to have a real home.\" \"Where do you think that jerk Buster is right now?\" Atticus asked. \"That's a good question...\" Mo put her hands on her hips. \"I hope that dogcatcher caught him.\" \"Where was he the last time you saw him?\" Cherry asked since she wasn't there. \"He was just in the junkyard, we all decided we wanted homes after Scamp stayed a house dog.\" Mo explained from memory, that was also the first time she knew she was in love with Atticus. \"Yeah and where a huge pile of car parts were fallen on top of him.\" Atticus added in. \"Maybe he's dead...\" Cherry suggested, rather graphically. \"For that dog, I hope.\" Attics said. Cherry shrugged. \"Oh, well, he did one thing right.\" Mo spoke up. \"What's that?\" Atticus asked. \"Got us together...\" Mo smiled with her hands together and batted her eyelashes to him. \"Yeah, he did do that, but he did leave Scamp while he was being captured by the dogcatcher.\" Atticus said. \"I'm just saying, if it wasn't for Buster, we wouldn't have met...\" Mo reminded. \"Yeah, I guess that's true...\" Atticus blushed to her. \"So, thanks, bad dog...\" Mo smirked. Atticus smirked back. \"Okay, got to go!\" Cherry couldn't take their emotional moment, so she got up and put her 3DS in her pocket. \"Well, she definitely is a goth.\" Atticus said. \"Seriously, when is she perky?\" Mo asked. \"Wait til Halloween.\" Atticus replied, knowing that was the only time of year Cherry would really be happy. \"I guess that would make sense.\" Mo said. Atticus and Mo decided to maybe see Cherry, they rarely hung out with her anymore due to being a couple and thought maybe they could do something for her. Cherry went into her bedroom and put her video game up, then lay back down on her bed with a novel. And where she was going to relax and let nothing ruin it. \"Hey, Cherry...\" Atticus came to her door. \"What do you want?\" Cherry asked as she never took her eyes off her new book. \"We were wondering if you'd like to do something?\" Mo invited. \"So you can suck each other's face?\" Cherry deadpanned. \"No.\" Atticus and Mo replied. \"What's in it for me?\" Cherry then asked. \"Whatever you want, we'll do it.\" Atticus promised. \"Anything?\" Cherry asked. \"Anything.\" Mo promised. \"Hmm...\" Cherry sat up on her bed, looking thoughtful. \"Can we go to Hot Topic?\" \"Sure.\" Atticus and Mo said. \"Okay...\" Cherry got off her bed and went to collect some money. \"What's Hot Topic?\" Mo whispered. Atticus began to whisper to her of what it was. \"Ah...\" Mo slowly nodded then. Cherry came back out with her money and led Atticus and Mo over to Hot Topic with her, which was a dark and gothic store in the Mall. 'Remember, Atticus, this is for Cherry,' Atticus thought to himself. 'This is for Cherry.' Cherry walked into the store with Atticus and Mo who looked around. \"Hey, Cherry...\" a deathly pale man with an Emo haircut with piercings greeted. \"Hey, Abraxas...\" Cherry greeted as she wandered into the shop to find something that would impress her. \"Friends of yours?\" Abraxas asked after noticing Atticus and Mo. \"Pretty much, they won't hurt you...\" Cherry promised once she saw a skeletal pen that caught her eye. \"Great to know.\" Abaxas said. Atticus and Mo glanced to him. \"How's Laura?\" Cherry asked after she came with a box filled with deathly items. \"She's fine, I guess...\" Abraxas scanned her stuff. \"She's wondering why she's still alive...\" \"We're all trying to make it until the weekend.\" Cherry understood. 'Some goths are so confusing.' Mo thought to herself. Atticus waited quietly and politely and looked at some of the decor, not sure whether to be delighted or frightened. \"Have a horrible day...\" Abraxas handed Cherry her gloomy shopping bag. \"Don't I always?\" Cherry scoffed back, taking the stuff, she really seemed like the more lively one when compared to other goths. \"So, where would you like to go now?\" Mo asked. \"Why are you doing this?\" Cherry asked them as she carried her bags out with them. \"You don't need to hang around me all the time.\" \"We just wanna make up for barely seeing you since we found each other.\" Mo explained. \"Yeah.\" Atticus added. \"You don't have to, I'll be fine...\" Cherry insisted. \"Are you sure?\" Atticus and Mo asked. \"You're not going to bug us.\" Atticus and Mo said in unison. \"Okay, let me just put this stuff away and we'll go to the cemetery.\" Cherry said, then went quicker with her bags. Mo and Atticus looked to each other, but anything to make up for missing on time with Cherry. \"Was she always like this?\" Mo asked Atticus since he knew the girl longer than she did obviously enough. \"Yes.\" Atticus said. \"I wonder why she's like that...\" Mo couldn't help but wonder. Cherry came back to them and had a key lanyard around her neck, taking them to the cemetery. \"I don't know, it's just who she is.\" Atticus told her. \"Ready?\" Cherry asked them. Atticus and Mo agreed. Cherry then took them to the cemetery. \"This is nice, guys...\" \"Yeah, it really is.\" Atticus and Mo nodded.[Chapter 5] Soon, Cherry was done with them and allowed them to go just in time for dinner. Emily was making a nice steak dinner with Patrick's help since he could be home for a change. Darla was on the phone with one of her friends, most likely Amber, talking about a boy band they both liked. \"Dinner!\" Emily called out. The others finished what they were doing and came right over. Patch let out a very exhausted yawn, but he was now more awake and able to eat dinner, so he joined the family. \"Hey, Patch, how was your nap?\" Darla asked. \"Refreshing...\" Patch answered while stretching his legs a little in each step. \"I forgot how energetic puppies were, let alone five in the same house.\" \"Well, if you think five are energetic, let's hope that you and Colette have the same amount of puppies or less.\" Darla said. \"Oh, boy...\" Patch moaned slightly. The others chuckled to him, but they were proud of him for doing this. \"I just hope I'll be a good father someday...\" Patch said to them. \"I wanna be like my dad.\" \"Don't worry, you will, wait, are you meaning your biological father or your father figure?\" Atticus asked. \"Biological, Lucky's good too, but I meant my dad back home,\" Patch explained after eating some of his dinner. \"I always thought he was better than Thunderbolt.\" \"Well, you'll be great as your dad.\" Atticus said. \"You think so?\" Patch smiled hopefully. \"I know so.\" Atticus said. Patch smiled and continued to eat. The family then settled down and ate their dinner, having a good time as family and all. The rest of the days went by during the times, Patch continued to visit and watch over the Buddies and where each day he began to learn something new about them and then one day, Buddy and Molly brought him inside to talk about the Buddies. Patch came to see the couple as promised. \"So, what's going on with the 'Buddies' this time?\" \"Patch, we love them, we really do, but we think that it's time.\" Molly said. \"Time for what...?\" Patch asked. \"You know...\" Buddy reminded. \"Time...\" Patch tried to think about it, it never really happened to him, but he remembered what happened to others before and now realized. The Buddies would have to be given up for adoption. \"Oh, that!\" \"Could you help us break it down to them gently?\" Molly asked. \"It's always rough for it to happen, but it has to...\" \"Be done, I know, and yes, I will help break it down to them gently.\" Patch agreed. \"We're just worried they might overreact and worry...\" Buddy added. \"It isn't easy, but there comes a time in everyone's life...\" \"I know and where I know it isn't going to be easy for the Buddies.\" Patch said. \"Thank you so much for offering to help us though.\" Molly sounded more relaxed now. \"It's no trouble at all.\" Patch said. \"We appreciate it.\" Buddy smiled. \"Yes, we really do.\" Molly said. Patch smiled, he felt so great to know they could trust him. \"It's my pleasure.\" Buddy and Molly smiled back and they had a quick friendly group hug. \"So, where are the Buddies now?\" Patch asked. \"They're upstairs, playing a little game.\" Molly smiled fondly. \"I better go play with them before we break it down to them.\" Patch said. \"Are you sure, Patch?\" Buddy asked. \"Don't get us wrong, we know you love the Buddies and they love you too, but are you sure they aren't wearing you out any?\" \"No way, besides, if these five are wearing me out, just imagine how exhausted I'll be when me and Colette have our own puppies.\" Patch said. \"Bless you, Patch.\" Molly soothed. \"No problem, Molly, anyways, I better go upstairs and play with the Buddies, before, well, you know.\" Patch said. Buddy and Molly nodded and allowed him to go. Patch then went upstairs to play with them before breaking the news to them.[Chapter 6] The Buddies were joined together in their basket as they weren't playing a sport for a change and they were playing their own adventure to be just like Patch. They were pretending their basket was a spaceship and they were astronauts. \"Hello, my little adventurers.\" Patch chuckled once he saw what they were doing. \"Patch!\" The Buddies called and rushed to see him, leaving their basket. \"How are my little adventurers doing?\" Patch asked. \"Did you bring any food?\" Budderball asked. \"I haven't eaten since breakfast!\" \"We're fine, yo!\" B-Dawg replied. \"Just serene as always.\" Buddha finished with a pleasant and very zen smile. \"That's good to know and no, Budderball, I didn't bring any food.\" Patch said. \"Aww...\" Budderball frowned. \"We were just about to go to space!\" MudBud piped up. \"Wanna come with us?\" \"Sure.\" Patch answered. \"I'm driving, ladies first!\" Rosebud said to her brothers as she went back to the basket. \"One at a time, one at a time, no pushing.\" Patch told the golden retriever puppies. The Buddies tried to go in a more organized way in the way Patch taught them, but still pushed. Just not as much as before. \"Close enough...\" Patch sighed, but smiled to them. \"Come on, Patch, there's plenty of room in here for you.\" Budderball said. \"I'll try, I haven't had a puppy bed in ages...\" Patch came behind them and tried to join them, there was enough room, but still, not the first option he would have to sleep in. \"Blast Off!\" Rosebud called, squeaking one of their rubber toys to be like a spaceship button. All six of them began to use their imagination. \"Captain's Dog...\" MudBud narrated like in an episode of Star Trek. \"We venture off to the world's most desired: The Planet of the Dogs. Where there are fire hydrants everywhere, dogs can go to school, and there's plenty of bones for everyone!\" \"And where everyone is incredibly strong.\" Patch added in. \"And we must find the meaning of life!\" Rosebud spoke up. \"What is the meaning of life?\" B-Dawg asked. \"Extra biscuits?\" Budderball guessed. \"Family and friends.\" Patch said. \"Some people believe that.\" Buddha agreed with Patch. \"And here we go!\" Rosebud called. They all then left the basket and pretended the bedroom was an alien space sight. \"What a fascinating place.\" Patch said, using his imagination. \"Just watch out for aliens,\" Rosebud cautioned. \"They bleed acid.\" \"Noted.\" Patch said. The Buddies continued to look around. Patch sighed, he loved to see them at play and he had to break the news to them. He decided to wait until a little after the game so that way, they wouldn't want to stop right away or just try to run away. The game was a lot of fun and where it seemed as though that they never wanted it to end, but unfortunately, it did end, telling Patch that it was time for him to break the news to them. The Buddies lay down next to each other after they finished their little game. \"And once again, they day was saved by the Air Buddies.\" MudBud narrated. \"That was a great game.\" Rosebud said. \"Yeah, but, um, Buddies, I have something to tell you.\" Patch said. B-Dawg got up, yawning and stretching. \"What is it, Patch?\" Buddha asked. \"Um, well, it's about, uh, you five remember when I told you about when you five need your own owners?\" Patch asked. \"Yeah...?\" the Buddies looked to him. \"But that's not for a real, real, real long time!\" MudBud replied. \"...Right?\" \"Um, well, not exactly, you see, your parents and I talked and well, it's time that you five find your owners.\" Patch told them. \"Now?\" Budderball sounded a little heartbroken. \"But... This is our home!\" \"I know, but every pet has to go through this,\" Patch told them. \"Don't think of this as a bad thing though, you'll all get to make new friends and have adventures of your own.\" \"I guess that's a good side.\" Rosebud sighed. \"Come now, we all have to go through it...\" Patch said to them. \"I promise, this is going to be good for all of you.\" \"But... What if we never see you again?\" MudBud frowned. \"You kidding? Of course you'll all see me.\" Patch assured them. \"I dunno, those are pretty low odds...\" Buddha wasn't so sure. \"I don't want to leave Mom and Daddy!\" Rosebud whined. \"Neither do I, it's not fair.\" Budderball said. \"Now come on, guys...\" Patch tried to make them understand. \"This is your destiny.\" \"Fine.\" The Buddies sighed. \"It's going to be okay,\" Patch smiled to them. \"Have I ever steered you wrong?\" \"No.\" the Buddies said. \"Then trust me on this, okay?\" Patch smiled to them. \"I believe in all of you and you're wonderful puppies. Besides, you might get adopted by someone who'll grow up and love you for the rest of their life.\" \"Okay.\" the Buddies said. \"Just trust me,\" Patch repeated. \"I mean, I was adopted when I was your age, but did I let that stop me?\" \"No.\" the Buddies said. \"Exactly, it'll be okay...\" Patch patted them each on the head. The Buddies looked to each other, still unsure, but gave small smiles to him. \"Glad that you all understand now.\" Patch smiled. The Buddies smiled to him. Patch smiled back. \"I'll be right back...\" he said to them, then wandered off. As soon as he was gone, the Buddies frowned. \"We can't get adopted, not like this, yo!\" B-Dawg pouted. \"I agree, dude, but what can we do?\" MudBud asked. \"I suggest we think this over in the kitchen.\" Budderball suggested. \"Seriously, Budderball?\" Rosebud asked. \"I'm hungry.\" Budderball pouted. \"You're always hungry!\" MudBud, B-Dawg, Buddha, and Rosebud retorted. \"Well, I can't help it!\" Budderball whined. \"Listen, dudes and dudette, we can't let them adopt us to different people.\" MudBud said. \"MudBud's right, we are family!\" Rosebud agreed. \"So we'll need to show Mom and Dad and Patch that we can stay here.\" Budderball said. \"Yeah...\" MudBud agreed. \"We'll show them that having puppies in the house won't be so bad!\" \"Agreed.\" Buddha nodded. \"But how would we do it?\" B-Dawg asked. \"That's a good question.\" Buddha said. The Buddies then decided to put their heads together to think of a plan.[Chapter 7] Patch came back from private business, then saw Buddy and Molly and decided to talk with them. \"So, how did it go?\" Molly asked the Dalmatian, referring to talking with their children about their new fate. \"Well, it was hard, but I think they understand.\" Patch said. \"Thank you so much for the help, we just knew if they listened to you, they would go for it a little easier.\" Buddy replied. \"Yeah, they didn't even resist of getting adopted.\" Patch said. \"A thousand thanks.\" Molly smiled gratefully. \"No problem, to tell you the truth, I thought the Buddies would have been more resisting of getting adopted.\" Patch said. \"Yeah, I know I was.\" Buddy could relate. \"But I'm glad they understand and aren't going to come up with a plan to stay here.\" Patch said with a chuckle. Buddy and Molly shared a laugh with him. Little did they know, that was exactly happening. \"Anyways, what do you two want to do now?\" Patch asked. \"I'm still training for the big game.\" Buddy informed. \"Well then, maybe you can practice with me.\" Patch volunteered. \"As long as you're up for it.\" Buddy playfully challenged. \"You're on.\" Patch chuckled. Molly rolled her eyes slightly, but smiled to them. \"You two better not act like puppies.\" she said. Buddy and Patch just laughed. Molly watched them go and decided to check up on her children. And where they were all huddled up looking as iff they were either planning something or going to play something. Molly thought maybe they were just playing and decided to go back downstairs to let them take care of personal puppy business, not knowing that they were planning on staying with their parents forever. \"Okay, does everyone understand the plan?\" Rosebud asked. \"Right.\" the other Buddies agreed. \"We also gotta get to Dad's basketball game, they don't let puppies in.\" B-Dawg remembered. \"Yeah, we can't miss his game.\" Budderball said. \"We'll plan on that too and ditch the 'sitter'.\" MudBud replied.[Chapter 8] The next day was the big game, Buddy and Molly's family was getting ready downstairs and had welcomed the sitter who had brought a blueberry pie with her. This of course caught Budderball's attention, but the others told him to focus. They then saw Patch coming, thinking that he was late and if he was then he'd make a run for the game giving them the opportunity they needed. The humans were taking their leave. Buddy barked goodbye to his children and left with the humans. \"Oh, there you are, Patch,\" Molly greeted. \"What took ya?\" \"I am so sorry, I overslept and I tried to get here as fast as I could.\" Patch explained before panting. \"Well, you came just in time as we're about to go.\" Buddy informed. \"Thank goodness...\" Patch was relieved now. \"Too bad I can't say goodbye to the Buddies.\" \"Maybe you can see them after the game.\" Molly suggested as they loaded up to go to the basketball game. \"Yeah, besides how much trouble could they cause at the house during a game?\" Patch asked. The dogs and humans then went off to their game. The Buddies stayed upstairs while the sitter was going to get settled in. As soon she was out of sight, the Buddies rushed downstairs to the doggy door with their ball toys. 'This plan is fool proof.' Rosebud thought to herself. However, Mrs. Niggles stopped them and looked firm to them. The Buddies stopped and looked up at her as she put her hands on her hips. \"And where you might think you were going?\" Mrs. Niggles waved her finger sharply toward them. The Buddies of course could not answer her since she didn't speak dog. \"Oh, I know what you little Buddies want,\" Mrs. Niggles then said to them. \"Bath time it is.\" That word always scared MudBud as he never liked getting clean. \"Cleanliness is next to godliness.\" Mrs. Niggles told the Buddies as she forced them into a bath. But of course, MudBud was not going to make it easy for her and began to run around over the place. Mrs. Niggles eventually caught him and scrubbed him down as she sang to herself. \"I hate getting cleaned.\" MudBud groaned. After the bath, Mrs. Niggles made the puppies take a nap. \"What do we do now, sis?\" Budderball asked. \"Don't worry, we'll get out of here.\" Rosebud promised. \"How, dudette?\" B-Dawg asked. \"Hmm...\" Rosebud tried to think. Mrs. Niggles left for an hour to let them nap while she would knit, which obviously, they weren't going to. \"Careful,\" Budderball whispered as they snuck out of their room. \"Gotta make sure she doesn't see us.\" \"Hey, look,\" Rosebud noticed one of the balls of yarns looked like a soccer ball which caught her interest. \"She's got a ball.\" \"If the Buddies can't go to the game, the game will come to the Buddies.\" B-Dawg replied. Buddha shushed them. \"Mrs. Niggles is finding her inner peace.\" \"Oh, come on, what do you want to do, go to sleep or have fun?\" Budderball asked. \"Look at her though, she's falling asleep.\" Buddha pointed. \"I don't know about my inner peace, but I wanna piece of that pie!\" Budderball looked at the blueberry dessert that came with their babysitter. Mrs. Niggles was starting to nod off and eventually fell fast asleep in the chair, allowing the Buddies to go. Meanwhile, Cherry, Mo, and Atticus had come to the basketball game as well. To Mo and Atticus's surprise, Cherry was actually getting involved with the game and even yelling at the referee whenever certain aggressive men would. \"THE REFEREE IS BLIND!\" Cherry scowled. \"You tell 'em, kid!\" one man agreed with her. \"Wow, I think this is a side of her that we have never seen.\" Atticus whispered. Mo agreed, it was quite surprising. Cherry sat down and ate her popcorn. \"Um, are you okay?\" Mo looked at her. \"Fantastic!\" Cherry unintentionally yelled. \"Wow, Cherry, this is a side of you we've never seen before and it's great that you are getting so into the game.\" Atticus said. \"Kinda picked it up from my brother when I was younger and I had to go to his basketball games...\" Cherry replied casually, then yelled out certain sports phrases. The basketball flew into the hoop and made it through. \"CALLED IT!\" Cherry cheered. \"Wow, when you're at a sports game, you sure show more excitement in your voice.\" Atticus said to Cherry. \"Wow.\" Atticus and Mo said, surprised. The whistle blew and the players kept running. \"REBOUND!\" Cherry stood on top of the bleacher she was sitting on. \"REBOUND!\" \"Please, don't let someone want her to sit down or else get out of here.\" Atticus prayed in his head. \"Hey, knock it off, kid!\" one guy called. \" You knock it off!\" Cherry retorted. \"Shut up, some of us are trying to watch the game!\" the man yelled. \"I'll show you watching a game!\" Cherry jumped down and zipped over. Atticus and Mo held each other. \"Yikes, who knew Cherry could be so competitive?\" Patch was alarmed. \"Well, at least it can't get worse,\" Atticus hoped. \"At least, I hope so.\" Half time came, so Buddy went over to his friends, both human and fellow canine. \"You guys are on fire today.\" Patch said. Buddy chuckled. \"Thanks, you guys enjoying the game?\" \"It's alright.\" Cherry replied, leaning back now and playing with her new iPhone. \"It was more than alright.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah, I wish I could play sports like you.\" Mo chuckled. \"I hope the Buddies are okay with Mrs. Niggles.\" Buddy sighed a little. \"I'm sure they'll be fine, it's a shame they couldn't come to the game.\" Patch replied. \"Why couldn't they come anyway?\" Cherry asked. \"Because puppies have a lot of energy and they might interfere with the game.\" Mo explained. \"Oh, okay...\" Cherry shrugged. \"I'm just worried of what the Buddies might do while you're away.\" Atticus said, referring to Buddy and Molly. \"I'm sure they'll be just fine.\" Buddy replied. \"Or make a huge mess...\" Cherry muttered. She was no stranger to how puppies could be whenever they wanted to play. \"I'm suddenly having a scary feeling for leaving the Buddies alone at home with Mrs. Niggles.\" Patch said. \"This is why the only pets I'll ever have are fish.\" Cherry commented. \"Um, maybe we should go and check on them, just to be safe.\" Patch suggested. \"Sorry, but I can't leave, I have my game.\" Buddy said to them. \"Maybe we could go in for you?\" Patch offered. \"Be my guest.\" Buddy allowed it. \"Thank you.\" Patch said. \"I'll tell you what you missed!\" Buddy called to them. Cherry put her phone up and they all then rushed to his house to check on the Buddies. \"I knew I should've asked if we could puppysit.\" Mo frowned. \"Yes, but this was Patch's decision.\" Atticus said. \"I just hope they're not in too much trouble.\" Mo replied. \"Oh, come on, how much trouble could those five make alone with Mrs. Niggles?\" Atticus asked before getting a scary thought. \"We better hurry.\" \"You had to ask.\" Cherry deadpanned in response. They then began to rush all the way to Buddy and Molly's house, hoping that the Buddies didn't cause too much trouble. Mo took out the emergency house key she was given and went to the front door, but she knocked before unlocking it. She was sure Mrs. Niggles had to be in there. Oddly enough, she didn't answer the door. \"Hello?\" Cherry called. \"Hello!\" \"She must be asleep.\" Atticus told them. Mo then took the key and unlocked the front door. \"Hello...?\" she called. \"Mrs. Niggles? We're here to check on the Buddies...\" There was still no answer. \"Maybe she's dead.\" Cherry suggested with a rather eerie smile. \"You worry me sometimes...\" Mo sighed to her. \"No way, she must be fast asleep, but we should still go inside to check the inside of the house.\" Atticus said. They all then walked in and looked around. After they passed the stairs, there was a huge mess of yarn and string that had tied up Mrs. Niggles. \"I think we can already tell who did this.\" Atticus said. \"Buddies!\" Patch called out, a little aggravated. \"Uh-Oh, sounds like Patch is here and he doesn't sound happy.\" Budderball said. \"Uh-Oh... RUN!\" Rosebud yelped. \"Buddies, get over here this instant!\" Patch called. The Buddies were heard whimpering and whining, but they did come over to see Patch. \"I am so glad this isn't my house...\" Cherry said as she looked around. \"Okay, you five, what happened? And I want the truth.\" Patch said, firmly. \"We didn't mean to cause any trouble!\" MudBud spoke up. \"We were just bored and we wanted to play, but Mrs. Niggles made us take a nap after our bath!\" \"Okay, all five of you, upstairs now while me, Atticus, Mo, and Cherry clean up this mess.\" Patch said. The Buddies whimpered. Patch frowned to them. \"Go to your room...\" he then said, a little softly. \"We'll talk about this later before your parents and pets come back.\" \"Yes, sir.\" The Buddies said, sadly. Unfortunately for them, the game had ended early and where Buddy, Molly, and their owners were back. Mrs. Niggles looked around and glanced at the humans as they had fallen and were in the tangled up yarn mess, then glanced to the man of the house. \"Clumsy...\" \"I think it might be time...\" Patch sighed, referring to the Buddies being put up for adoption. Those who didn't live at the house went home and the Buddies were sent to bed early, but they weren't scolded by their parents. But they also didn't get to play with Patch, the next day would be when Patch and Buddy would try to help them find owners for the pups.[Chapter 9] Mo was coming with Angel, Scamp, and Colette in an attempt to help out since she knew dogs better than anybody else on the block. Danielle was going to sit this one out as she mentioned about having plans with Copper. \"This isn't going to be easy.\" Patch sighed. \"Chin up, Patch, I'm sure it'll be okay...\" Colette soothed. \"Why is this just so hard?\" Patch looked back at her. \"I wish there was something I could do.\" \"They'll warm up to the idea eventually.\" Angel agreed. \"Yeah... We'll think of something while they wait to be adopted.\" Scamp added, having matured ever since he first met Angel. \"Okay... Well, me and Buddy are taking the Buddies out to find the right kid for each of them.\" Patch said. \"That'll work...\" Mo smiled. \"I knew Angel was the right pup for me the moment we first laid eyes on each other.\" Angel smiled and nuzzled against Mo's legs. \"Sometimes I miss those days when we had our first real home until your grandmother passed away...\" Mo smiled and picked Angel up a little to hug her and quickly set her back down on the ground. \"Back then I didn't think I needed anyone else.\" Patch went out to meet up with Buddy, so then they could help the Buddies each find a kid perfect for each of them. \"I hope we find someone, teaching them to fetch the Sunday paper didn't go as well as planned.\" Buddy said as he went off with Patch. \"Oh, boy...\" Patch sighed. \"Colette told me that her mother tried to do the same thing when Darling was about to have Junior.\" \"Well, hopefully it won't be so hard to find the right someone for each of the Buddies.\" Buddy said. \"There's someone out there for everybody.\" Scamp quoted. \"Though most people say that when they wish to win an admirer.\" Mo reminded. \"Yeah...\" Angel playfully smirked to her mate. Scamp smirked back. Mo rolled her eyes slightly at them, but kept walking. \"What's with her?\" Scamp asked. \"Oh, she's just teasin'.\" Angel chuckled to her young mistress. \"Yeah, must be that.\" Scamp said. Patch and Buddy began to look with the Buddies to find the right kids for each of the puppies. Their first stop was at a junior baseball diamond. There was a kid who was struggling to play and was even hitting the umpire with his bat due to his frustration. \"That kid would be perfect for Buddha,\" Scamp said to Angel as they watched. \"He looks like he really needs inner peace and plus, he loves baseball.\" \"Yeah and besides, that kid looks like he could really use someone to keep him calm and to find a way to not let his frustration get to him.\" Angel said. Scamp nodded. It was settled: Buddha would stay with this child. \"Alright, now, let's see who is next to be chosen as one of the Buddies' owners.\" Scamp said. Angel nodded and they left the junior baseball game. \"Where are we going to next?\" Patch asked Buddy. \"There's this couple with a four-year-old daughter and they love going on picnics.\" Buddy suggested. \"Oh, Budderball's gonna love that!\" Patch beamed. They ended up in a picnic ground, but there was a sole vegetarian family that ate nothing but barbecued zucchini and veggie burgers, just anything with no beef. \"Never mind, it looks like this family might not be for Budderball.\" Patch said. \"This one will be perfect!\" Colette said as she looked for the Finch family. \"They got a little girl and she loves soccer!\" She then went to the field as there was a game going on, this girl was going to be just perfect for Rosebud, they're both girls and love soccer, it's a match made in puppy heaven. The girl kicked the soccer ball into the goal and did a victory slide, though seemed to have a boastful upbringing. \"She's a bit of a show-off though...\" Colette noted. \"Then again, she is the only girl...\" she then noticed that this girl was the only girl on the team like how Rosebud was the only sister out of five puppies. \"Hmm...\" \"Seems like you two are perfect for each other, Rosebud.\" Patch said. \"Let's see, there's one kid who has an eleven-year-old kid who loves playing video games...\" Mo read from the description given to her. \"Hmm...\" She ended up in a volleyball field, there were other kids playing the game, but there was one kid who was outside and more focused on playing his video game console than physical activity. \"Wow, that kid does not seem to be focused on the volleyball game.\" Patch said. The ball landed hard in front of the boy and made some dirt splash in his face. \"This kid really needs to get out more.\" Mo noted. \"Yeah, he needs to loosen up.\" Patch agreed. \"I think we found MudBud's owner.\" Scamp said. \"Here's one...\" Mo looked at one form. \"There's one family who has both parents as dentists.\" \"Pass...\" the dogs replied to her with shudders. \"Well, someone likes basketball...\" Mo then suggested. \"Cool, so is it the kid a boy or a girl?\" Scamp asked. \"A boy, he's got the spirit, but no confidence.\" Mo replied. \"Maybe his coach should tell him that?\" Scamp assumed. \"I think he'd do better if he had a best friend to help him out.\" Colette suggested. Patch smiled. \"Yes, and not just any old best friend, man's best friend.\" \"Four down one to go.\" Scamp said. \"Yeah...\" Mo said. \"Hmm... Who would be good for MudBud?\" \"How about Pig Pen?\" Angel suggested. \"That would be good if the Peanuts comics were real life and not cartoons.\" Mo chuckled to her puppy's idea. \"Hmm...\" Patch tried to think. \"Who would be good for MudBud?\" \"Hello? The one that needs to learn to relax and that getting dirty isn't that bad,\" Scamp said. \"The only one that we need to find an owner for is Budderball.\" \"Hard to believe they'll be gone very soon...\" Colette sighed. \"I just hope they'll be happy with their new owners.\" \"I'll talk to them later tonight, I'm sure they'll listen to me.\" Patch said. \"That's easy for you to say, you've been looking out for them like Lucky did for you when you first became a Pound Puppy.\" Angel smiled. \"Yeah.\" Scamp nodded. \"Well, I'm gonna go see them after dinner...\" Patch yawned a little and stretched. \"What a day this has been.\" \"Yeah, it was nice to do something together.\" Colette agreed. \"Thanks for inviting me along too,\" Mo smiled at the dogs. \"I didn't think you all liked me that much.\" \"Of course we do, Mo.\" Patch informed her. Colette, Angel, and Scamp even joined in. Mo giggled to them and she gave them all a pat on the head before hugging them. \"I love you, guys.\" \"We love you too.\" Angel smiled and licked Mo's cheek then. \"We all better get going then.\" Scamp said. They all then went their separate ways to get home. Patch went home to have dinner with the family and told them that as soon as he would done, he would check on the Buddies. \"Hey, Patch.\" Maisy said as soon as he entered. \"Hey...\" Patch panted a little. \"Man, what a day...\" \"You've been gone since lunch, I bet you're wore out.\" Maisy could see why he would seem this way. \"Yeah and I'm going to see the Buddies again after dinner.\" Patch said, walking off then. \"Again? Wow, you sure have been visiting those puppies a lot lately.\" Maisy said. \"Yeah...\" Patch chuckled. \"Until Puppy School, I didn't really have anyone to play with.\" \"If you stayed home, you'd never feel lonely.\" Maisy reminded him of his hundreds of brothers and sisters. \"I know, but then I wouldn't have enough space to play in or have my spot to watch TV and also I'd probably starve.\" Patch informed her. \"Oh, is that why you came to stay with Atticus?\" Maisy asked. \"Yeah, I really wanted to be one of a kind, it was really hard to get attention...\" Patch looked up at the incoming night sky. \"I wonder what's going on over there right now?\" \"Maybe you should find out later tonight.\" Maisy said. Patch smiled. \"You cats ever have a Twilight Meow?\" Maisy giggled at his question. \"Not that often, we normally respect each other's privacy.\" \"Well, it's where you meow out in the middle of the night to contact other cats, it's like the Twilight Bark.\" Patch told her. \"I know, but we cats normally like our space.\" Maisy explained. \"Ohh.\" Patch said, understanding. \"Yeah...\" Maisy smiled. \"It's lonely, but that's just how cats are, they like to be alone most of the time.\" \"I guess that's why Cherry's a cat person.\" Patch concluded. \"Yeah, I guess.\" Maisy shrugged. Patch shrugged. Atticus came in the room and gave Patch his dinner while Patrick cooked dinner for the humans of the family. Darla was on her celluar phone and gave Maisy her dinner as she walked by, grabbed an apple, bit into it, and continued to walk off, not really paying much attention to anything due to her phone conversation. \"Do you think we should take her cell phone away, so then, she can pay attention to the things around her?\" Atticus asked his parents. \"Probably, at least she doesn't use it at dinner time like Jessica did when she first got hers.\" Emily commented. \"Yeah, I think it took us at least a week to try to get it away from her.\" Patrick said. \"I can imagine,\" Atticus chuckled a little. \"Um, you guys want some help with dinner?\" \"I'm chopping vegetables.\" Emily said to him with a smile. \"Mind if I join you?\" Atticus asked. \"Not at all.\" Emily allowed him to. \"Thanks.\" Atticus said. Emily decided to sort the vegetables into a bowl while Atticus would cut them. Patch ate his dinner, though tried not to be in a hurry about it, but still rushed just a bit to make it to the Buddies before they would go to sleep tonight. Maisy was also eating her dinner. Darla, though on the phone, smiled at the animals as she snacked on her apple, having much healthier treats than junk food like she used to. Right after dinner, Patch ran out to get to the Buddies before they went to sleep.[Chapter 10] The Buddies seemed a little depressed about the whole adoption idea while they lay around, Budderball with his shoe munching. They were happy as soon as Patch came in. \"Hey, Buddies, how are you five doing?\" Patch asked. \"We're okay, yo...\" B-Dawg replied. \"Hmm...\" Buddha didn't say much due to his rare display of negative disposition. \"Yeah... Wanna chew?\" Budderball pushed the shoe he was teething on over to Patch. \"Um, no, thank you, Budderball.\" Patch denied, politely. \"Okay...\" Budderball took it back and started to chew on the shoe. \"So, I hear your'e gonna get ready to be adopted tomorrow.\" Patch brought up with a smile, still believing that the Buddies were eager to meet their future pet owners and start their own lives and futures away from each other. \"Yeah, I guess...\" The Buddies sighed. Patch looked at them, instantly frowning. \"Is something wrong?\" \"Well, it's just that this has always been our home and we always thought that we'd always stay here.\" Rosebud said. \"Oh, Buddies, we've been over this...\" Patch said softly. \"We know...\" the Buddies said. \"You're going to your new homes tomorrow, just think of it as your own adventure.\" Patch smiled to them. The Buddies paused for a few moments and smiled themselves. \"See?\" Patch smiled, he didn't know they were still trying to stay with their parents. \"It's going to be just fine and I'll visit you whenever I get the chance.\" 'But, tomorrow is taco night.' Budderball thought to himself hungrily. \"And Budderball, I'm sure that your owner will feed you tacos.\" Patch assured him. After a little while, Patch decided to get going home and once again reassured the Buddies that there was nothing to worry about with their new life changing experience. Molly left after checking on her children one last time, little did she or Buddy or anyone else know, there was going to be a tragedy striking for the Buddies. She saw all five of them fast asleep and was relieved that they didn't try anything. However, the Buddies made a plan to run away. That way, even though they would be away from their parents, they would be all together. This plan sounded right to them and they decided to follow it.[Chapter 11] \"Dudes, what if Patch let's the Pound Puppies help him find us?\" MudBud asked his siblings. \"We'll have to be very careful then...\" Rosebud suggested. \"Be very quick and careful.\" \"Rosebud's right, you guys.\" Budderball said. \"Let's go then.\" B-Dawg suggested. Buddha pushed a chair in their room to a window and one by one, they all climbed up it and climbed out the window. Soon, they were all out, except for one. Budderball was still struggling to get out with them. \"Come on, Budderball!\" Rosebud said. Budderball was still trying. \"You have got to be kidding.\" Rosebud groaned. She then decided to go help him before he would slow them down. Budderball struggled to grip onto the chair and pull himself up. Rosebud grabbed his paw to help him up. \"Don't pull his paw!\" the other Buddies cried, but it was too late. Budderball let loose some gas, disgusting his siblings instantly. \"Budderball!\" Rosebud groaned. \"Dog, that's disgusting...\" B-Dawg grimaced. Budderball finally made it up and the five puppies scurried across the roof. They then took turns sliding down the drain pipe, being small enough to fit and made it down to the ground to continue their getaway. \"Wait a minute!\" Budderball was the hold up yet again. \"We forgot to pack a lunch!\" \"We can't stop now, dude.\" Mudbud said. \"I'm gonna pounce the butt outta you if you don't move!\" B-Dawg threatened as they slid down together. \"Come on!\" Rosebud told her brothers as they went along. Unfortunately for them, a couple of men in their vehicle found the puppies and were going to go after them now. \"This way!\" Mudbud took the lead. \"Follow me, dogs!\" \"Beats sitting around doing nothing.\" Budderball said. They kept going, only for Budderball to get distracted by a bakery. While he stared at the donuts, the men looked over to him and decided to capture him. One man used a vanilla donut with sprinkles as a trap with a fishing pole. \"Huh? Ooh, a donut.\" Budderball said as soon as he noticed it. The men got ready to reel him in as soon as he bit down on the donut trap. But to his surprise, Budderball was a lot stronger then they thought. \"I GOT HIM!\" the thinner man grabbed a net and slammed it over the plump puppy after the fishing pole was hard to get a proper hold of. The other Buddies kept going, but they stopped because Rosebud heard something. \"Wait, did you guys hear that?\" Rosebud asked her brothers once she heard yelping. \"Where's Budderball?\" \"Dudes, the donut shop!\" MudBud cried out once he had a pretty good idea. \"Quick, to the donut shop!\" Rosebud called out. \"Maybe I should hang back and keep it real, ya know?\" B-Dawg was nervous. \"And uhh...\" he then saw his siblings go far ahead of him. \"Guys, wait up!\" Meanwhile, Mo was playing outside with Junior while Angel, Scamp, Colette, and Danielle kept her company. Patch poked his head through the loose fence piece and came to see them. \"Hey, guys.\" \"Hey, Patch.\" Mo said back as she gently rolled the ball over to her younger brother. \"I think I'm gonna go check on the Buddies just to make sure they don't try anything.\" Patch said. \"You want me to come with you?\" Colette happily offered. \"If you want to.\" Patch smiled to the cocker spaniel he loved. \"Of course I want to.\" Colette said with a smile. \"Well, alright then.\" Patch said. The two dogs then went off to check on the Buddies together. \"Puppy Love much?\" Danielle chuckled as she stayed to play with Junior. \"What about Copper, Danielle?\" Mo teased the tomboy dog slightly. \"Touche.\" Danielle groaned. Mo hid a chuckle as she continued to play with them. Patch and Colette continued their way to the Buddies, but then caught a familiar scent. It was the Buddies. Colette stopped and sniffed the other way. \"They're somewhere there...\" Patch sighed. \"What are those five up to now?\" \"You don't think they'd run away do you?\" Colette asked. \"They wouldn't, why would they?\" Patch frowned at that horrifying possibility. \"Well, I know you said that they were fine with their new fate, but they seemed a little upset about going away to separate homes when I saw them.\" Colette mused. \"Oh, no, we better find them then.\" Patch said. Colette's ears twitched a little. \"Come on!\" She ran down the street one way. Patch went after her to follow, also picking up the sense of the Buddies. 'Buddies, please be alright.' Patch thought to himself. Colette hoped the puppies would be alright too, she could feel something horrible. \"I swear if anything has happened to them, I'll never forgive myself.\" Patch said. \"Oh, don't worry, they couldn't have gone too far.\" Colette cooed to him. They looked everywhere that they could until they got to the bakery. Just as they arrived, so did Buddy and Molly. \"Buddy, Molly, what are you two doing up?\" Colette asked. \"The pups weren't in their room, have you seen them?\" Molly asked, deeply concerned, being a mother and all. Patch and Colette's eyes widened. Their worst fear had just been realized. \"No, but we think that they might have ran away.\" Patch said. Buddy sniffed a donut left on the ground and knew who got into it. \"Budderball.\" \"The pups... I hear them...\" Molly whispered. \"So do I, come on, before it's too late!\" Colette yelped as she rushed ahead. \"I hope they're not hurt.\" Patch said. The Buddies yelped for their parents and friends as they came. The Buddies were trapped in a net by a tree, struggling to get out. Molly stopped with Colette. \"I smell a trap.\" \"Must be from the ones that trapped the Buddies in that net.\" Patch said. \"I'm going in,\" Buddy told them. \"Watch my back.\" He then went to save the Buddies from their prison. Molly, Colette, and Patch came to help him. The two men from the van were now in a tree above them and were determined to trap the golden retriever parents. Buddy molly Colette and Patch began to get closer and closer to the trapped Buddies. Once the trap was lifted, the puppies sprouted out. \"Run, Buddies, run and hide!\" Colette urged them. The Buddies scampered off and once they did, another trap fell on top of Buddy and Molly. \"Buddy! Molly!\" Patch called out, about to set them free. \"Patch, look out!\" Colette yelped. The larger man jumped down, revealing himself to the dogs. \"And that's why I'm your uncle's successor!\" Colette growled and did an uncharacteristic thing and bit at his pant leg. \"Hey, let go, you stupid mutt!\" The larger man glared. Colette tore at his pants, growling. \"TOSS THE NET!\" the larger man told his smaller sidekick still in the tree. However, the smaller man got the net stuck on the larger man by accident. \"Not on me, doofus!\" the larger man snapped, then put the net over Patch and Colette. But to his surprise, Patch was able to break the net and get it off both him and Colette. \"Okay, Buddy, now I'll free you and Molly.\" Patch said. The two men grabbed Buddy and Molly and rushed off with them. \"Get back here!\" Patch demanded, going after the men. Colette followed, looking very angered. This caught the Buddies' attention and where they then went to help Patch and Colette to try and save their parents. \"Our mission is as follows: Capture Air Bud.\" the larger man told the smaller one as they saddled up Buddy and Molly. \"Stay close, Buddies, I don't want you to get hurt.\" Colette told the puppies like they were her own children with protecting them. \"But, Mom and Dad, we have to save them!\" Rosebud cried out. \"Just stay close to me.\" Colette advised as she went with them. The men loaded up Buddy and Molly in the trunk of their car. The van then rode off with them and Colette, Patch, and the Buddies rushed after as soon as the van took off. \"I can't believe this, I should have saved Buddy and Molly from those two when I had the chance.\" Patch said. The Buddies couldn't run much longer, so they had to stop. Colette looked back at them. \"Oh, dear...\" she frowned, feeling sad for them. \"Patch, they can't keep up...\" \"Oh, right, I forgot that puppies aren't as fast as dogs.\" Patch said before stopping. \"That's okay...\" Colette said, then came to the Buddies. \"I'm sorry, dears...\" \"I can't believe this,\" Rosebud frowned. \"We got Mom and Dad dognapped.\" \"I'll never eat another donut as long as I live.\" Budderball whined, feeling like this was all his fault. \"We have to get them, but how...?\" Patch tried to think. \"Deputy Sniffer!\" Rosebud suggested. \"He's the world's greatest tracker!\" \"Perfect! If there's anyone that can help us, he can.\" Patch said. \"Where is he?\" Colette asked. \"Follow us.\" Buddha said. Once the Buddies rested well enough, they dashed off to find Deputy Sniffer to help track down Buddy and Molly.[Chapter 12] \"Let's hope that Deputy Sniffer's nose hasn't lost it's touch.\" Patch said while following the Buddies. They all ended up outside the sheriff's office as the bloodhound was fast asleep and they all rushed to him for help. The Buddies all attempted to wake him up, but he wasn't moving. \"You leave me no choice...\" Rosebud sighed, she then went to the old dog's tail and bit on it, but not in a way to make it bleed or bruise. The bloodhound woke up then. \"W-Wide awake...\" he muttered. \"J-Just resting my head.\" \"Sure, we'll go with that, Deputy.\" Patch said. \"Sniffer, this is an emergency.\" Colette told the older dog. \"Five... More... Minutes...\" Sniffer lay back down to keep sleeping. \"Now what?\" Patch frowned. \"Sheriff's coffee'll do the trick!\" MudBud rushed over to the table, got on top of it, and tipped over a coffee cup to splash on Sniffer. Sniffer woke up and lapped it up, then looked to the group who came to see him. \"Hey, Buddies, Patch, and Collete...\" he greeted. \"Funny that, I was just dreaming about you all.\" \"It wasn't a dream, you just fell back to sleep, so we had to use coffee to wake you up, now pay attention, this is an emergency.\" Patch said. The Buddies tried to explain, but ended up talking all at once. \"Whoa, whoa, one at a time,\" Sniffer tried to settle them down. \"You're making my head spin! You first, Budderrose.\" \"They were dognapped by two dognapping dognappers!\" Rosebud cried. \"Okay, to make this much easier, Buddy and Molly were dognapped by two men and where they rushed away in a van.\" Patch explained. \"Any other leads?\" Sniffer asked. \"We heard them say somethin' about Innsfield,\" Budderball informed. \"Where is that, Deputy Dude?\" \"Innsfield!?\" Sniffer stood up instantly. \"That's wine country. I know it well. The sheriff here loves his Merlot. I personally prefer toilet water.\" \"Could you please track them?\" Colette asked. \"My sniffer isn't working like it used to,\" Sniffer replied apologetically. \"I couldn't even track a train. You'd be better off without me.\" \"It's okay, Deputy Sniffer, can you please tell us how to get there?\" Patch requested. \"I'm wore out...\" Sniffer yawned noisily and fell back asleep. \"Guess the coffee wore out.\" MudBud commented. \"Sniffer?\" Rosebud frowned. \"More like Snorer.\" \"Wait...\" MudBud had a scent. \"I got an idea! Follow me!\" he then led a way away from the sheriff's station. \"I hope that whatever MudBud is planning is going to work.\" Patch said. Cherry was in her bedroom, playing her Nintendo on her bed, upside down. \"I wonder what society is doing?\" she mumbled to herself, unaware of Patch and Colette's secret mission with the Buddies. \"Cerise.\" Forte said, suddenly appearing in front of her. \"What?\" Cherry flatly asked as she continued to play her game. Forte began to whisper to her about where Buddy and Molly were and what Patch, Colette, and the Buddies were going to do to save them. \"Who took them!?\" Cherry looked at him. \"I don't know their names, but they mostly took Air Bud to give to a rich child as a pet...\" Forte informed. \"Sounds like a spoiled brat...\" Cherry returned to her game. \"Yeah and I'm sure that Patch, Colette, and the Buddies will be alright on their own all alone out there.\" Forte said. \"Goodbye...\" Cherry said as she played. \"Why would you tell me this anyway? I'm not a dog person.\" \"No, but you do care about Atticus, don't you? Well, he cares a lot about Patch and where if anything happens to Patch or Colette or the Buddies, it would break not only his heart, but many others,\" Forte told her. \"Plus you need sometime away from that game.\" Cherry continued to play, but she did pause it to think about what he said. \"I hate it when you guilt trip me.\" she deadpanned. \"Yeah, yeah, now come on.\" Forte said. \"Okay... Hang on...\" Cherry started her game back up, then saved it and went to charge it next to her new phone, then took the phone, put it in her pocket and came to his side. \"You know, knocking would be nice before entering my room.\" \"Then where would the fun in that be?\" Forte asked. \"Now, come on, let's get going.\" Cherry followed him. \"Where are your parents?\" Forte asked, noticing she was home alone yet again. \"Business meeting out of town, they won't be back until the weekend.\" Cherry replied. \"Oh, so then, you're all alone in this house?\" Forte asked. \"Yeah, I'm too old for a babysitter.\" Cherry remarked. \"Why didn't you call me?\" Forte looked to her. \"I could've made you dinner.\" \"I can take care of myself, I'm not a child anymore.\" Cherry glanced at him. \"Okay, okay, it's just that it's not safe to be all alone in a house.\" Forte said. \"I'm fine, I just stay in my room all day until it's dinner time anyhow,\" Cherry shrugged, shamelessly. \"You need a girlfriend or something and stop worrying about me.\" \"But I can't stop worrying about you and besides, what if someone tried to break into your house?\" Forte asked. \"I'd lock myself in my bathroom and call the police...\" Cherry glanced at him. \"That... Would be a reasonable response.\" Forte said. \"Why do you care so much?\" Cherry glanced at him. \"I like to think of myself as your guardian angel...\" Forte seemed to be making up an excuse. \"Can't I help you out?\" Cherry glanced at him and walked further ahead of him. \"You are so weird...\" \"Whatever, let's just hope that Patch, Colette, and the Buddies haven't gotten too far.\" Forte said. Cherry rolled her eyes slightly as they came to the Fudo house.[Chapter 13] Darla was in the living room with her friends. \"Darla, where's Atticus?\" Cherry asked. \"Upstairs with Mo,\" Darla replied with a sneaky smile. \"I think they're gonna make out.\" \"Oh, um, well, then maybe now is not a good time.\" Forte said. \"Do you even know what that means?\" Cherry folded her arms at him. \"Yes...\" Forte glanced at her. \"I may be old-fashioned, but I pick up on things from your century.\" \"You didn't even know what a computer was until you met me again when I just became a teenager.\" Cherry reminded him. \"Touche.\" Forte groaned. Cherry glanced at him, then yelled upstairs. \"ATTICUS, GET DOWN HERE, NOW!\" \"I'm kind of busy right now!\" Atticus called back. Cherry narrowed her eyes and walked up the stairs. \"Cerise, don't.\" Forte held her arm back. Cherry slapped his hand and kept going up. \"Wow, this must be really important for Cherry to go up stairs to get Atticus herself.\" Darla said. \"Tell me about it...\" Forte mumbled. Cherry banged on Atticus's door. \"Get out of here right now!\" \"Cherry?\" Atticus was surprised. \"You came up here all by yourself?\" \"Very funny, get out of here now!\" Cherry folded her arms. \"Okay, okay, just give me a minute, okay?\" Atticus asked. \"Hurry up!\" Cherry rushed. \"Okay, okay, I will.\" Atticus said. Cherry groaned, she then got bored of waiting for him and started to paint black nail polish on her nails, blowing on them. Eventually, Atticus came out of his room. \"What took you so long?\" Cherry asked as she looked at her nails in the light. \"I had to apologize to Mo for cutting it short, now what is so important?\" Atticus asked, cross armed. \"Patch, Colette, and the Buddies are trying to save Buddy and Molly from being kidnapped.\" Cherry explained with no emotion in her voice. \"What?! Then let's get going.\" Atticus said. \"Finally...\" Cherry walked off. Mo poked her head out and followed them. \"Why didn't you tell us sooner?\" \"You wouldn't let me.\" Cherry reminded her. \"Really?\" Mo said out of confusion. \"I've been here forever... You didn't answer me...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"I had enough time to give myself a manicure.\" \"It's just been a few minutes.\" Atticus said. Cherry showed her dry nails. \"I have a lot of free time...\" \"Don't get hurt now...\" Darla said as she stood in between Annabelle and Amber. \"Good luck.\" Annabelle added. \"Thanks,\" Atticus said before turning to Cherry and Forte. \"Now, where are they heading?\" \"Last I've heard, Innsfield.\" Forte replied. \"Do you know where that is?\" Cherry glanced up at him coldly. \"As far as I know, miles away from here.\" Atticus said. \"Just come with me, I know what I'm doing.\" Forte led them away. \"That's what worries me...\" Cherry mumbled. \"Would you rather like us to not follow him and for us to get lost?\" Atticus asked. \"Don't mess with me, I've been reaped of my video game privileges...\" Cherry muttered. Mo frowned a little, she just didn't know what to think of Cherry sometimes. \"Let's just follow Forte and let him lead us.\" Atticus said. \"That friend of yours, Atticus.\" Mo sighed at Cherry. \"Hopefully they're okay and haven't gotten into any trouble.\" Atticus said. \"Come along then.\" Forte told them as he led them further downtown.[Chapter 14] \"So which way do we go again?\" Budderball asked. \"True north and we most follow its path.\" Buddha theorized. \"Alright then, let's start walking,\" Patch said. \"We have a long journey a head of us.\" The Buddies nodded and kept going once they were well enough. \"Oh, bless the little dears...\" Colette sighed about their determination to get their parents back together for their family. \"Patch, were you and the others like this when you were split up from your parents?\" \"Yeah, but we needed a plan of how to escape.\" Patch told her. \"Oh, of course, that must've been scary though...\" Colette cooed. \"Especially when we were Labradors and that crazy car chase...\" Patch shuddered a little. \"I had nightmares about that for a while.\" \"Oh, you poor thing...\" Colette nuzzled. \"I wish I could've been there to help you.\" \"Yeah, well, I'm just glad that day will never happen again.\" Patch said. Colette smiled to him. \"You guys coming or what?\" Rosebud looked back at them. \"Yes, sorry!\" Patch focused back and picked up the pace a little with Colette then. \"Now, when we get to the people that dognapped your parents, leave them to me to deal with them.\" he then said. \"Will do, I just hope they haven't done anything totally uncool!\" B-Dawg growled. \"Because if they have, then those people will be bruised in many ways that you pups will have to have your eyes covered.\" Patch growled. The Buddies nodded. Meanwhile, the humans sat on a bench since they needed a little break. Cherry sat in the shade since the sun was out. \"After a little break, we'll keep going.\" Atticus said. \"I just didn't think it'd be that far away.\" Mo spoke up. \"Well, we are traveling on foot...\" Forte said as he kept Cherry company in the darker spot of the area they were in. \"Since you don't have a car...\" Cherry glanced up at him. \"Well, we can always take mine.\" Atticus said. This caused for Cherry and Forte to glance at Atticus and where Cherry's left eye began to twitch. \"What's wrong?\" Mo asked, very curious of their reactions. \"You have a car and now you are just bringing this up?!\" Forte glared at Atticus. \"I thought exercise would be good for us...\" Atticus shrugged. \"You know I hate going outside when it's sunny and warm...\" Cherry folded her arms. \"Okay, okay, let's go back and get my car.\" Atticus said. They then went back to Atticus's house so then they could get into his car. \"Sorry about this, Mo, but Cherry gets sick in the backseat.\" Atticus said to his girlfriend once he took the wheel with Cherry sitting next to him and Mo in the back. \"That's okay, I understand.\" Mo reassured that she would be fine. \"Well, okay, if you're sure.\" Atticus said. Cherry buckled her seat-belt, put her headphones on, and turned on her phone. \"Hang on, dogs, we're coming!\" Atticus called once he started his car. \"Forte, aren't you coming with us?\" \"I don't really like cars that much...\" Forte put his hands up. \"Oh, come on, it'll be faster than walking and besides, I'm an excellent driver.\" Atticus said. \"Just not too fast, okay?\" Forte was still anxious. \"Relax, I got this, they wouldn't give me a license if I was a terrible driver.\" Atticus reassured. Forte took a deep breath and joined Mo in the backseat. \"I guess let's break the road as you young people say?\" \"Hit the road!\" Cherry corrected in annoyance. \"Ugh...\" \"Alright, everyone have their seat-belts on?\" Atticus asked. \"Check!\" the others told him. \"Let's go then!\" Atticus started the car and they drove off to Innsfield. \"Oh, I hope the dogs are okay...\" Mo sighed a little, putting her hands together. \"If Patch is with them, I'm sure that they're safe.\" Atticus said while driving. \"I've never seen dogs accomplish such feats and I've been alive for four centuries now.\" Forte sighed a little, impressed with Patch's determination. \"Patch is as strong as me, if anyone or any animal, such as like a bear, he'll be able to beat it.\" Atticus said.[Chapter 15] It was starting to get dark as Patch, Colette, and the Buddies were still going. \"It's getting dark, we should stop to get some rest.\" Patch suggested. \"Wait, do you guys smell that?\" Budderball sniffed deeply. \"I must be 'smellucinating'.\" \"Whoa, wait, I smell it too!\" MudBud said. They all kept going and they went through bushes and there were people at the drive-in, watching a movie. \"What...?\" Patch looked confused once he saw the screen of a human man with an older Dalmatian behind him. \"Dad...?\" \"Your dad is here, where?\" The Buddies asked in unison, looking around. \"Right... There...\" Patch pointed to the screen of the movie that the people were watching. \"Wow, that's amazing.\" The Buddies said. \"You smell that?\" Buddha sniffed the air. \"I'm no Sniffer, but it's coming from over there.\" \"You're right, it's popcorn.\" Colette added. \"Where there's popcorn, there's Budderball!\" Budderball looked eager. The Buddies then zipped off to get popcorn as Roger was now chasing Pongo to get his hat back which would lead to the meeting of Roger and Anita. \"Wow..\" Patch said while watching the movie. \"I didn't know you guys had a movie.\" Colette was just as surprised as he was. \"Neither did I.\" Patch said. \"Come on, we better go before we get left behind.\" Colette told him. Patch nodded, shaking his head and going with the Buddies. \"I sure do miss them...\" he said, referring to his parents. \"I'm sure they miss you too...\" Colette soothed. \"Dudes, this is totally my favorite movie!\" B-Dawg spoke up as they went by the concession stand. There was suddenly thunder and lightning in the movie as the audience was now introduced to Cruella DeVil. \"I am so glad that devil woman is in an asylum.\" Patch said. \"I'm glad I never met her.\" Colette agreed. \"Same here because that devil woman was just so evil.\" Patch said. \"Oh, sweet mama...\" Budderball moaned once they got closer to the scent of popcorn. \"I can almost taste it... It's through there!\" The Buddies ended up by the garbage cans. Colette cringed at the garbage, unlike most dogs who ate through trash, she found it revolting, mostly due to her upbringing. The Buddies were then in the projection booth where the movie was being played through. Patch looked at the room name, being able to read it due to being unlike many other dogs. \"Now, what was that thing Cherry told me about projection booths...?\" he tried to think. 'NEVER EVER go through a projection booth!' Cherry's voice rang through his head. 'That's where the movie is being played and if you make a mess, you'll ruin the movie and fun for everyone!' \"Oh, yeah... Oh, dear.\" Patch said with wide eyes before going in after the Buddies. The Buddies got through the room as Cruella was mocking puppy Lucky just as he was born and had no spots so far due to being just born and she called him a white rat. The man at the projection booth was sleeping on the job and holding his bucket of popcorn in his arms. \"Buddies, we have to get out of here.\" Patch whispered, trying to get them out. The Buddies were too coveted by the popcorn to notice him right now. \"Follow me,\" Budderball told his siblings. \"My nose knows the way.\" The five puppies then climbed up a chair and walked by the film projector, making their shadows noticeable on the screen. \"Buddies! No! Stop!\" Patch called out to the puppies. The audience started to worry with the large puppy shadows as the Dalmatians were now disguised as Labradors. The puppies got into a little argument when B-Dawg stopped for a moment and MudBud was trying to look out. This caused the two brothers to wrestle each other. \"Please, stop!\" Colette cried to the two Buddies. \"Stop that fighting this instant!\" Patch barked. B-Dawg and MudBud just kept fighting. Patch then separated the two to stop the fight. \"That is it, we are getting out of this theater booth now.\" Patch said. \"Come on, I found more food!\" Budderball called as they continued on. B-Dawg and Mudbud then followed. \"Buddies, stop this before you get yourselves in trouble!\" Colette sighed as she followed. There was a man with headphones on, mopping up the floor of the concession stand. \"Jackpot!\" Budderball cheered. They snuck to behind the counter as the woman there was too busy talking on her phone to notice them. \"You have got to be kidding.\" Patch groaned. The Buddies got into the food and started to eat like there was no tomorrow. The hot dogs, the popcorn, the cotton candy, the nachos, the red licorice known as Twizzlers... \"Don't just stand there, guys, dig in!\" Budderball encouraged. \"I think I just lived and gone to Heaven.\" \"Eh, what the heck.\" Patch shrugged before joining in. Colette sighed, she did feel a little hungry, but it was against her natural order to pig out, but she felt she had no choice. An innocent bystander woman came to the counter and asked for a family sized popcorn bucket. \"Sure!\" the woman nodded and scooped up the popcorn in a tub with one of the Buddies inside of it and gave it to the other as she got out her purse. \"Oh, no, is everyone here?\" Patch asked. Colette did a quick head count and the Buddies called to her when she called their names. \"Oh, it looks like we're all-\" she sounded relieved, then gasped once she noticed someone missing. \"Where's Budderball!?\" The woman gasped once she saw a puppy in her popcorn, finding it disgusting and unsanitary that she ran off. The two men from earlier spotted the dogs and tried to run after them, but slipped on the wet floor. \"Guys, we have to leave now!\" Patch told the Buddies once he rounded them up. \"Anybody got a doggy bag?\" Budderball asked before following his family. \"No! We're leaving now!\" Patch glared before picking up Budderball and then ran off, causing the rest of the Buddies and Colette to follow. The Buddies, Colette, and Patch ran out of the concession stand to get away from the two bad men. There was a large group of tough guy bikers who were watching the movie and enjoying it very much. \"Hey, check it out, puppies,\" one man smiled. \"Just like in the movie!\" The tough guys pet around the puppies and smiled to them, acting more like excited kids than rogue men. Colette and Patch glanced at the men and oddly stared to each other. \"Wait, maybe these guys can help us distract those guys.\" Patch whispered. Colette smirked, she placed herself in front of the motorcycles. The two bad men rushed over, tripped over her and knocked over the motorcycles. Colette smiled and came over to Patch. \"What did you do?\" Patch asked her. \"Trust me, I've seen this in movies.\" Colette reassured. \"Oh, they're going to be beaten up, aren't they?\" Patch asked with a smirk. Colette smirked back with a firm nod. The bikers left the Buddies and came to the bad guys, now looking tough and strict as they would seem to be from fearful strangers. \"Let me at those punks!\" B-Dawg stepped forward. \"Hold me back, hold me back!\" The bad guys got nervous and asked if the bikers had seen the puppies. \"Were you trying to hurt these puppies?\" one biker asked, sounding disgusted. \"No way!\" the large man tried to lie coolly. \"Get 'em!\" the bigger biker told his friends. \"Come on, let's get going while those two are being pound to a pulp.\" Patch said to the Buddies. \"Puppies your age shouldn't see this.\" Colette agreed. The Buddies then left with Patch and Colette. \"I sure hope we don't run into those guys in our next life.\" Buddha said as they made their escape. \"Wait for me!\" Budderball was a little slower as usual. Patch sighed, he then decided to carry Budderball by his collar, having no trouble with the puppy's extra weight so they could all keep up with each other. Meanwhile... Cherry yawned very noisily. \"Atticus, can we please stop for now?\" she asked, sleepily. \"We've been driving all day...\" \"Okay, but where should we stop?\" Atticus asked. \"The next hotel, gas station, anywhere...\" Cherry mumbled tiredly. Atticus saw a motel and decided to stop there for the night. \" Not here!\" Cherry growled once she realized where they stopped. \"You said anywhere...\" Mo reminded her. Cherry rolled her eyes and rubbed them as she was extremely exhausted. \"Fine... I just need a bed.\" They all then exited the car to the reservation desk to get two rooms. The owner gave them their keys and let them go off. \"Ugh... My legs feel so numb...\" Cherry wobbled a little. \"I'll carry you to our room.\" Forte said to Cherry. \"Oh, you don't have to...\" Cherry yawned once more. Forte ignored her protests and carried her in his arms. \"You two have a good night now...\" she told Atticus and Mo, walking off with Cherry as she instantly fell asleep in his arms, nearly drooling due to being overtired. Atticus then began to carry Mo in the bridal style and carried her over to the room that they were going to share. Mo smiled sleepily to Atticus as he carried her. \"I feel this won't be the last time you do this with me~...\" \"I have the same feeling, Mo.\" Atticus said. Mo giggled a little, but yawned very sleepily. \"Oh, excuse me...\" \"It's okay.\" Atticus said before unlocking the door to their room and opening the door. They then entered the room to get some sleep after closing the door. Mo undid her bandanna and put it on the nightstand before she drifted off to sleep. Forte took Cherry's phone and plugged it in for her and tucked her into bed. \"Bon nuit, Cerise...\" he whispered to her. Cherry was dead asleep and couldn't hear him. She actually looked peaceful when she was asleep. Forte then went to the next bed, having to not fall asleep, one of the unlucky things about a vampire, no sleeping at night. Atticus slept in the bed across from Mo with a smile. Mo hugged her pillow, humming happily in her sleep. Forte sighed and decided to catch up on his reading as Cherry was sleeping soundly. \"See you in six to eight hours...\" he mumbled as he felt trapped due to being forced to stay awake.[Chapter 16] The next morning, all four of them got ready to continue their journey to find Patch, Colette, and the Buddies. Cherry wasn't quite ready yet after they all got up and got dressed. Forte saw this and knew what Cherry needed before she could get into a moving vehicle and went to fetch it for her. \"As soon as we're all ready, we can keep going.\" Atticus said, stretching. Mo stretched herself. \"What are we waiting for?\" Cherry didn't say anything. Forte came back with a biscuit sandwich that had bacon and eggs inside of it. Cherry swiped it from him and started to eat it up. \"She didn't even say thank you!\" Mo cried. \"Leave her alone, she's had a long day yesterday.\" Forte soothed. \"We'll go out to find Patch, Colette, and the Buddies, right after Cherry is done with her breakfast.\" Atticus said. Mo nodded in agreement. \"Do you need another one?\" Forte asked. \"Give me another for now, I'll eat it later.\" Cherry replied. Forte nodded and went to get her another one. \"Wherever the Buddies, Patch, and Colette are, I hope they're having breakfast.\" Atticus said. \"I'm sure Budderball will be glad about that.\" Mo agreed. Meanwhile, with Patch, Colette, and the Buddies... The Buddies, Patch, and Colette had spent the night in a hollow tree. Patch and Colette were nuzzled up together, like a peaceful dog couple by the warm and crackling fireplace on a bitter cold winter's night. When the two woke up, they saw the Buddies awake, with playful smirks on their faces. Colette yawned, then smiled to them. \"Morning, Buddies...\" \"Morning...\" the Buddies said together then. \"What're you doing?\" Patch added. \"Nuthin', what're you doin'?\" Rosebud asked with smirk. Patch and Colette looked at each other and knew why the Buddies were all smirking at them. The two blushed and stretched together. \"Um, you pups have a good night?\" Patch asked sheepishly. \"Uh-Huh.\" the Buddies smirked. Colette came out of the tree and looked around with a sigh. \"Now where are we?\" \"Civilization is miles and miles away now.\" MudBud spoke up. \"What about the restaurants?\" Budderball asked. \"Um, I think we might be a little bit lost.\" Patch said. \"We better go out and ask for directions,\" Colette suggested, then looked to her mate. \"Unless you don't need directions...\" \"No, no, it's a good idea.\" Patch agreed with her so they wouldn't have an argument about directions like most couples, well, human couples did anyway. \"Okay, but where can we find directions?\" Rosebud asked. \"We'll have to ask someone who lives around here.\" Buddha suggested. \"Yes,\" Colette agreed. \"Hopefully someone kind and helpful.\" \"Yeah and hopefully not mean and violent.\" Patch said. \"I smell something over that way, dudes!\" B-Dawg looked back as he was looking to another direction. \"Alright then, let's follow that scent.\" Patch said. \"I hope there's candy and cookies and ice cream...\" Budderball spoke up. \"Did I mention cookies?\" \"Buddha, this isn't the time to sleep.\" Rosebud told her spirtual brother. \"I'm meditating,\" Buddha told her. \"Absorbing positive energy.\" \"I'd positively like to observe a Pop-Tart.\" Budderball sighed. \"He reminds me so much of Rolly...\" Patch whispered to Colette. \"Wow, he must have been hungry almost all the time.\" Colette whispered back to her mate. \"Very much...\" Patch nodded. \"I remember that one time during Thunderbolt after dinner, he told our mother he was really hungry.\" Buddha continued to meditate. \"Buddha, come on, let's go, bro.\" MudBud told his brother. Buddha nodded and went with them. \"Wow, he didn't waste anytime to catch up.\" Patch said. Cherry, Atticus, Mo, and Forte kept traveling. \"Man, this place is so far away...\" Atticus sighed a little. \"I hope we make it there in time.\" Cherry started to mumble some things relating to what was going on as she held herself and had her eyes shut. \"I thought you were asleep?\" Mo looked to her. \"No, just resting up, never fall asleep on a road trip...\" Cherry explained. \"Oh, well, okay then.\" Mo said. \"I just hope those dogs are okay,\" Forte sighed as he wore sunglasses to block out the sun. \"I trust Patch and Colette, I really do... I just hope they aren't starving to death or feeling miserable.\" \"Kinda like you...?\" Cherry smirked back to him with a bad laugh at her attempt with black comedy. \"Not funny, Cerise...\" Forte muttered. \"Shows what you know...\" Cherry scoffed. \"You guys are like an old married couple.\" Mo joked. \"Yeah, you two really are like an old married couple.\" Atticus agreed. \"We are no such thing!\" Cherry and Forte protested together. Mo and Atticus exchanged glances with each other. \"Just drive...\" Cherry went back to lie down and daydream a little. \"Okay, okay.\" Atticus said, continuing to drive. The Buddies continued to look for a scent, ending up together. The bad guy's truck was back on the road after their punishment from the bikers last night and they just saw the puppies. The truck passed them, but after half a second, the tires screeched and drove through the fence to meet them on the field. \"RUN!\" the Buddies yelled as the truck was chasing them now. \"How do these guys keep finding us?\" Rosebud asked. \"I don't know, but I think Patch should use that Hercules strength of his and cause for their vehicle to crash!\" Budderball suggested while running. However, as the truck kept going, it suddenly stopped and ran out of gas. \"Looks like I didn't need to since it looks like they ran out of fuel.\" Patch said as he noticed the vehicle stopped. \"Let's keep going though so we can lose 'em!\" MudBud called, taking the lead. \"Couldn't agree more.\" Patch agreed. The dogs kept going as fast as they could and the two men abandoned their truck and chased after them with the net, but had issues due to it being tangled. Even Budderball could outrun them. \"Hopefully we can get as far away from them as possible.\" Rosebud said. The Buddies escaped to a farm ground. \"FREEZE!\" the larger man called and they actually stopped in front of a fence. \"I mean, good little puppies!\" \"Cha-Ching!\" the smaller man chuckled, imitating a cash register about being filthy and disgustingly rich. \"They're like the 'pup-arazzi'.\" B-Dawg pouted. \"Don't worry, Buddies, I won't let them get you five.\" Patch said. \"Quick, under here!\" Rosebud suggested for them to squeeze under the fence cracks to make their getaway. Colette made sure all of the Buddies would go through while anxiously looking back to Patch and the bad guys who wanted to dognap them. \"Are all of the Buddies on the other side of the fence yet?\" Patch asked. \"Almost!\" Colette called as Budderball was, of course, stuck. \"Oh, for the love of...\" Patch said before helping Budderball get unstuck and through the fence. Budderball yelped a little from the force, but made it to his brothers and sister. \"A cocker spaniel on a farm...\" Colette sighed. \"I don't know why, but something about this seems vaguely familiar...\" \"You go with the Buddies, I'll hold these guys off.\" Patch told her. \"Be careful.\" Colette gave him a small kiss on the forehead and went after the Buddies. \"I will, but you should say the same thing about them with of how strong I am.\" Patch said. The bad guys came to the Dalmatian and looked eager with their net. \"Isn't that one of them 101 Dalmatians?\" the smaller man asked, sounding like a kid. \"Don't be stupid!\" the larger man scoffed. \"That was just a movie!\" \"Okay, time to give these two a super strong Dalmatian dog charge, sending them both flying and landing somewhere to keep them busy for a while.\" Patch said as he started to get himself ready to charge. The two men looked for the Buddies still, but decided to get rid of this dog, thinking he was just a normal and untalented dog. \"You're comin' with us, Rover.\" the larger man grinned darkly. And where that was their mistake as Patch used his incredible strength and began to make them fly all over the place and then charged at them, sending them flying back into their car, making them very dizzy. The men yelled out and suffered. \"That'll teach you!\" Patch nodded firmly and went under the fence to join the others. They were now ended up on a form and passed a bleating goat. \"Who goes there?\" the goat demanded. \"Friend or foe?\" \"You speak doggy?\" Rosebud didn't know that other animals could talk with each other, she just thought only dogs could talk to other dogs, and other species to do the same since most humans did the same. \"I'm fluent in Horse, Cow, Chicken, Pig, and Rooster,\" the goat replied. \"I even know a little Mouse.\" \"Cool.\" MudBud said. \"Now I said, 'who goes there, friend or foe'?\" the goat repeated his question. \"We don't even know what foe means.\" Rosebud defended so they would be on the goat's good side. \"We're the Buddies and we're being chased by crazies!\" B-Dawg added. \"So, in other words we're friends, but the two guys that have been chasing us, are the foes.\" Colette said. \"I see...\" the goat looked strict. \"Nobody trespasses on Billy's property. I'll take care of them,\" he looked to the bad guys now climbing the fence and looked to the dogs. \"You may pa-a-ass. Go to Belinda in the pigpen. She'll help you!\" \"Come on, I know where pigpens are!\" Patch told the others and led them into the barn. \"Great, this I can get dirty.\" MudBud smiled. \"Billy sent us,\" Colette told the pig. \"We're friends, not foes.\" The pig Belinda spoke to them, but spoke very strangely. \"What is she talking about!?\" Budderball glanced at the pig's choice of vocabulary. \"Oh, it's Pig Latin,\" Rosebud recognized. \"I'll translate.\" \"Go ahead.\" Patch said. The bad guys came from down the fence and came after the dogs again. Belinda gave them a warning and direction to hide away. \"She said 'Quickly, disguise yourselves as piglets and a couple of sows'.\" Rosebud translated. \"Oink, oink!\" MudBud was eager to get down and dirty. \"Well, we better get disguising.\" Patch said. \"Don't you have something to help us blend in easier?\" Colette prompted. \"I'll try...\" Patch put his paws to his collar. In a flash, Patch and Colette were grown sows and the Buddies were their piglets. The Buddies oinked, but actually barked a couple of times. The bad men rushed over to capture them. \"This is my kind of camouflage...\" MudBud buried himself in the mud. \"This was a brand-new fur coat.\" B-Dawg pouted once he was dirty now. \"Just act like normal pigs.\" Patch said. \"They're gone.\" the smaller man frowned once they looked in the pigpen. The Buddies kept trying to oink, but couldn't help let a few woofs come out. The larger man noticed this and busted them as they all turned back into dogs. The piglets decided to help their new friends and confuse the bad guys to make this very difficult for them. \"These two just won't give up.\" Patch said. The larger man grabbed a pig and thought it was one of the puppies as they all ran off, away from the two men. The men then both ended up in the mud, but the larger one ended up face first, dropping the piglet. \"Buddies, Patch, Colette, into the barn, quick!\" Billy warned his new friends. \"You got it, Billy.\" Patch said. \"Thanks, Belinda!\" the dogs said as they ran into the farm. \"Anks-thay, Elinda-Bay!\" Rosebud added. \"Oycott-bay acon-bay!\" Belinda replied. \"What did she just say?\" Colette asked. \"Boycott Bacon, I don't know what that means though.\" Rosebud said to her. Billy led them to a place they could hide inside the barn. Billy led them up to the top of the barn and looked down as the bad guys escaped the pigs and wandered into the farm house. \"Don't move a muscle.\" Patch told the Buddies. \"Yes, sir.\" the Buddies said. The bad guys decided to split up and look for the dogs, but they ended up going the same direction after some confusion. There were a couple of rakes buried in the hay, which the bad guys stepped on and got hit in the face with in a cartoony fashion. The others couldn't help but laugh at this. MudBud sniffled, he had hay against his nose which made him sneeze and made hay fall onto the bad guys. \"That should stall them for a while.\" Colette said. One of the bad guys looked up and saw them all. \"They're up there in the hayloft!\" \"Or not...\" Colette then frowned. \"RUN FOR IT!\" \"Get in the hay and scramble!\" Patch suggested to the Buddies since they would be able to blend into the hay easier. \"And as for us?\" Colette asked. \"We'll have to try.\" Patch told her. Colette sighed and took a deep breath before going into the hay. The bad guys came up and they were all hidden then. Billy kept an eye out for the bad guys for them. 'These two are seriously getting on my nerves.' Patch thought to himself. The bad guys came closer to the hay and called for the puppies once they saw tails. However, Billy charged out and butted them off the hayloft and made them land in the hay down below again. \"This way, run for cover!\" Billy told the dogs and led them to hide somewhere else now. \"This is kinda fun!\" Colette giggled. \"I feel like a puppy again!\" \"Well, an adventure can make you feel that way when you're a dog.\" Patch said. The dogs ended up in a dead end and the bad guys had cornered them. Billy had planned this though and would never put the dogs in any real danger. \"There they are,\" the large man laughed. \"You peanut-sized puppies and your older dog friends htink you're so smart! Well, how are you gonna get outta here, you little geniuses?\" Patch and Colette had gotten out and held out their paws. The Buddies saw this and came out of the hole that was big enough gor them all to crawl out of, even Budderball. The bad guys did not think this through and were about to go around, but Billy shut the door on them and locked them in with no way out but the tiny hole. \"Whew, that was close.\" Patch sighed in relief. Billy came to meet them outside the barn. \"That was a bla-a-ast!\" he smiled. \"That's the most fun I've had in years. Now, you'd better go find your parents.\" \"What do you say?\" Colette prompted. \"Tha-a-ank you.\" the Buddies told him and went off the barnyard. \"I think that was Dalai the llama.\" Buddha spoke up. \"Dude, he's a goat.\" B-Dawg argued. \"B-Dawg is right, Billy is a goat.\" Patch said. \"That's right.\" Colette agreed. Patch sighed. \"I hope everybody's alright back home.\" \"I'm sure they're fine and we'll all have a nice happy reunion.\" Colette reassured. \"Yeah, you're probably right.\" Patch said. They all kept going until they reached their new destination.[Chapter 17] Atticus stopped his car to the gas station for a quick refill, food, and bathroom break. \"So nice to see you not playing your games for a change...\" Forte said to Cherry as they stood together. \"I guess...\" Cherry shrugged as she had her hands in her pockets. \"What a road trip just to bring a bunch of dogs back home.\" \"They are really important to their owners.\" Mo said. \"Yeah, but I don't understand why I had to come...\" Cherry looked moodier than normal. \"How about the worthy cause of giving something good to someone you care abotu?\" Forte prompted. \"I guess...\" Cherry shrugged. \"You are one confusing girl.\" Forte said. \"You made me this way...\" Cherry reminded him. Forte looked away from her then. Cherry rolled her eyes while Atticus filled up the gas tank and she munched on some candy she bought. It took a while, but the gas tank was finally filled up and they were ready to continue their journey. \"Let's get going then.\" Mo said as they went back to their seats. Cherry yawned again and leaned against the window, slowly shutting her eyes again. Atticus started the car up and drove off with them to find the dogs in time. Speaking of which Patch, Colette, and the Buddies were continuing their journey. They ended up near a large body of water before them. \"Can't go over it, can't go around it,\" Buddha commented. \"MudBud, I've got bad news: You're about to take a bath.\" \"Dude, I'm already clean!\" MudBud refused. \"I just took a mud bath!\" \"On the positive side, there's no soap.\" Buddha told them before going into the water. \"I'll carry you, MudBud.\" Patch said. \"Okay, fine, fine!\" MudBud gave in. The Buddies went into the murky water, but it would be a lot cleaner than the mud and it was the only way to pass. Colette was a little nervous, she put one paw in the water and shuddered, shaking her head in disgust. \"I... I can't... It's just not my place as a house dog...\" \"Come on, Colette, this is the only way to get to the other side, I'll be right by your side the whole way across the water.\" Patch said. Colette sighed, she took a deep breath and joined them into the water. \"Oh, that's cool and refreshing...\" she smiled once she accepted it. The Buddies were going further and ended up on the shore on the other side, shaking themselves dry. \"That was so refreshing.\" Rosebud said. They made it out of the water and passed through as they got deeper into the forest. \"Stick together, it can be easy to get lost in a forest.\" Patch advised the Buddies since he knew what it was like. \"Yes, sir.\" the Buddies said. They were a little scared though, but they had to do this to save their parents. Patch went in front of the Buddies while Colette went behind them in an effort to help comfort them and help them through the forest without any trouble. \"Hey, guys, can we stop to get a bite to eat?\" Budderball asked. The Buddies sighed at their bottomless stomached brother as they kept going through the forest. Colette sniffed something off, she looked very cautious, but she kept up with the Buddies, but she was starting to worry now. \"I'm sensing this way is true north.\" Buddha spoke up. \"Well, your compass is stone-cold busted, dog, because we just came from that way!\" B-Dawg whined. \"I don't care which way we go, as long as it has food.\" Budderball said. \"Why don't you stop thinking about your stomach for once!?\" B-Dawg grew agitated. \"Dude, why don't you stop thinking about yourself for once?\" MudBud retorted. \"I don't even know why I bother with you guys!\" Budderball started to fight them. \"Oh, no, this adventure's really getting to them...\" Colette was now worried. \"Stop fighting!\" Patch exclaimed as he began to separate the three brothers. \"Yes, we have to work together as a team if we're ever going to find Mom and Dad!\" Buddha agreed firmly. \"Guys...?\" B-Dawg suddenly got nervous. \"I feel like someone is watching me...\" \"He's right!\" MudBud whimpered. A silver wolf growled and came up to behind the Buddies, Patch, and Colette. \"Buddies, there's only one thing for us to do.\" Patch said. \"RUN!\" one of the Buddies called, making them all run away then. Patch and Colette joined them, causing for the wolf to chase after them. The wolf tricked them as they ran and ended up in front of them, looking very hungry and not at all friendly. \"I am puppy,\" Rosebud walked out. \"Hear me rooooarrr!\" The wolf glanced at her, not impressed. \"Don't you dare hurt my brothers or friends!\" Rosebud snarled. \"You are very brave, little one...\" the wolf remarked. \"I definitely take back what I said about girls.\" B-Dawg whispered. \"Yeah, some of us girls can be quite furious.\" Colette whispered. \"Girl power all the way!\" B-Dawg continued. \"It's not safe for you pups alone in the forest,\" the wolf said. \"At least you have some guidance. Follow me, I won't harm you.\" \"This isn't a trick, is it?\" Patch asked in caution. \"The girl one stood up for me, I owe my life to you now.\" the wolf insisted, showing he was now going to help them and not hurt them. \"Okay, we'll follow you.\" Patch said, trusting the wolf. \"I sure hope Mom and Dad are okay.\" MudBud said as they continued, now following the wolf. \"I'm sure that they're alright, MudBud.\" Colette said. The wolf made sure they all kept up as he led them to where he wanted to take them. He was sure they would like it a lot better than this spooky old forest. \"Excuse me, but are most wolves like you?\" Colette asked. \"Some, it depends on who will stand up to us and who will back down, we are very selective,\" the wolf said as he guided them. \"Sometimes, if you are in need, we can help... The tribe before me took in a man cub by the name of Mowgli and raised him like their own.\" \"Really?\" Patch asked. \"So, where is he now?\" \"He lives in a man village with a tribe of people, so he may be safe.\" The wolf said. \"He didn't stay with you in the forest?\" Rosebud asked. \"Oh, no,\" the wolf shook his head. \"He was given a choice and it was decided best that he stays in the man village where he truly belongs.\" \"That makes sense.\" Patch said. \"I wonder what he's doing now then?\" Colette smiled. \"Who knows?\" the wolf sighed, but smiled as well, glad that Mowgli made the right choice to stay with his original home.[Chapter 18] It was starting to get dark again as they came further and further to their new temporary home. \"Are we there yet?\" Budderball asked. \"Almost, not too much further now.\" the wolf promised. \"That's good to know, the sooner we get there the better, we have been walking all day.\" Colette said. It wasn't too dark now, but they had finally made it to their new shelter for the night. \"Where's the food?\" Budderball moaned. \"Um, excuse me, Mister...?\" Colette asked, not knowing the wolf's name. \"You can just call me 'Alpha'.\" the wolf replied. \"Okay, um, Alpha, where do you keep your food?\" Colette asked. \"Yeah, where are the cheese snacks?\" Budderball added. \"I'll go get some, you better stay here, I'm best to hunt alone.\" Alpha replied, going into the forest, leaving the Buddies with Patch and Colette for protection and support. \"Well this is a nice place and is the closest place to stay as we'll ever get to.\" Rosebud said. Alpha nodded to them and went to find them food. \"Patch, I'm sorry we ran away from home,\" B-Dawg spoke up. \"We just didn't wanna be away from each other.\" \"And look at what's happened!\" MudBud frowned, feeling guilty for this for ever happening. \"Hey, hey, it's okay, Buddies, I understand you don't want to be separated from each other, but remember the Twilight Bark and I'm sure that there is another way to tell the other that you miss the other.\" Patch said. \"We know, but we were just being selfish, we're really sorry.\" Rosebud pouted. \"There, there, it's okay...\" Colette soothed. \"I know this is a big change for everyone and it's a little scary, but don't worry... Every dog goes through this and you will actually learn to like it.\" \"That's easy for you to say, you and Patch still live with your families.\" MudBud spoke up. \"Actually, my family is also spread out, I visit them whenever I have the chance.\" Patch said. \"Really?\" Rosebud asked. \"We thought that was just a story.\" \"Nope, it's the truth, and that movie it showed everything that happened on that faithful day.\" Patch said. \"Wow, dude, that is so cool!\" Mudbud cheered. \"For you and your family to have your very own movie.\" Patch smiled. \"I'm sure another one isn't too far away.\" Colette smiled fondly, this was such a nice scene. \"Wow, you mean it'll show a movie of you and your kid met?\" Budderball asked, somehow more interested in Patch's story than eating. \"Maybe someday...\" Patch shrugged with a smile. \"Who knows?\" \"Aww! Come on, Patch, won't you tell us, please?\" The Buddies begged, using their puppy dog eyes trick, hoping to find out from Patch himself. Patch tried as hard as he could, but he knew that he couldn't say no to the puppy dog eyes. \"I think you ought to tell them.\" Colette giggled to her mate teasingly. \"I think you're right, because if I don't, then they might...\" Patch said before the Buddies began to tickle him. \"No, no, please stop, I'm ticklish.\" This information made Colette giggle and smirk playfully. The Buddies giggled as they tickled Patch, having a lot of fun and felt much better now. Alpha came back with a bunch of meat for them. \"Dinnertime!\" \"Forget dinner, we were about to hear a story!\" Budderball piped up. \"Wait, did Budderball just say 'forget dinner'?\" Patch asked. This made the others stare at him. \"Sorry... I really wanna hear this story...\" Budderball replied. \"Well, how about dinner and a story?\" Patch suggested. \"Yeah!\" the Buddies agreed. Colette sorted the meat out so it would be even and equal, but she did give a bit of extra for Budderball since he was known for eating more than his siblings and even had a bigger food bowl at home than they did. Patch began to tell Alpha, Colette, and the Buddies the whole story about how he met Atticus. The Buddies and Colette gripped onto every word as they ate. Colette was interested, she knew Atticus a lot better now than when they first met, but she was pleased to hear the other side of him that she never knew about. \"And then when we got to the barn, some kittens were next door and where Darla got to adopt one of them, which was maisy and where after that day atticus became my owner.\" Patch said as soon as he finished the story. The Buddies and Colette smiled. \"What a wonderful story,\" Rosebud cooed. \"I bet you were so happy, huh?\" \"I sure was.\" Patch said. The Bdudies smiled, they then decided that if Patch go through that and be away from home, then maybe they could too. \"Hey, Alpha, what do you do when you miss your family?\" Patch asked. \"It's not easy to think about sometimes...\" Alpha said as he looked out to the moon. \"Well, what I do whenever I miss my family, I use the Twilight Bark.\" Patch said. \"That is a great coping mechanism.\" the wolf supported. \"Thanks, it's how I keep connected to my family.\" Patch said. \"Let me tell you this,\" Alpha told the Buddies. \"A pup once left his den until a little boy found him and took him home, and when it came time for him to go home, the pup did not want to go home. He and the boy had formed a true bond. And from that day on, dogs chose to live amongst people to bring the love of animals to human families.\" \"We've really messed up,\" Buddha sounded guilty. \"We ran away from our troubles instead of facing them.\" \"And then our 'rents got dognapped.\" B-Dawg added. \"We're trying to rescue them.\" MudBud informed. \"I have heard your mother and your father howling.\" Alpha then told them. \"You have?\" Patch asked. \"I heard them too,\" B-Dawg spoke up. \"I was trying to tell everyone.\" \"Rest now,\" Alpha advised since they weren't nocturnal. \"In the morning, I shall take you to them.\" \"Thank you, Alpha.\" Patch smiled before yawning and going to sleep with Colette and the Buddies. \"Sweet dreams, everybody.\" Rosebud said once they got settled in for another night away from home. \"Nighty night, Mr. Wolf.\" Budderball added as he fell asleep with his siblings. Colette got closer to Patch as they fell asleep for another night. Atticus stopped his car at a bed and breakfast to stay for another night for them as well. \"Well, we better go to the reservation desk.\" Atticus said. Mo yawned and nodded, she rang the bell on the desk. \"May I help you?\" a kindly old woman asked. \"Four guests to stay for the night and morning, please?\" Cherry asked, not sounding as tired as she did earlier today. \"One room?\" the woman asked them, typing at her computer to give them a place to sleep until tomorrow. \"Yes, ma'am.\" Mo said. \"Alright, if you all are really sure.\" The woman said. They agreed and they went up to their room. Atticus and Mo instantly went to bed after getting ready and saying good night to each other, driving all day was more exhausting than it sounded. Cherry was sitting on the window ledge and stared out the night sky, holding her knees. \"Hey, Cerise... You okay?\" Forte asked. \"Fine... Just wanted to think...\" Cherry said, never looking away from the sky. \"What are you thinking about?\" Forte asked. \"Nothing...\" Cherry ignored him. \"Cerise...\" Forte prompted, putting his hand on her shoulder. Cherry scooted away from him. \"Don't make me hypnotize it out of you.\" Forte threatened. Cherry sighed, then looked back. \"I'm worried about the dogs...\" she admitted. \"You are?\" Forte asked. \"Well, that's understandable.\" \"Hey, I have feelings...\" Cherry said to him, though soft in contrast to her usual cold-blooded tone of voice. \"Okay, okay, don't go all cold-blooded tone on me.\" Forte said. Cherry glanced at him. \"Why are you even on this trip?\" \"I just want to look after you...\" Forte sat next to her. \"Why though?\" Cherry looked away from him. \"You've been obsessed with me ever since you came back in my life after I thought you were dead for most of my childhood!\" \"I know, I just wanted to make up for that.\" Forte said. \"Really?\" Cherry deadpanned. \"Yes...\" Forte told her, not telling her anything else because it might freak her out. \"I really wanted to help you out... You were spending your first Christmas away from your family and the Master was so busy with Belle... You were alone... Like me...\" \"Hmm...\" Cherry buried her face against her knees. \"I mean it, Cerise.\" Forte said. \"I'm sure you do...\" Cherry glanced at him. \"I really do mean it.\" Forte said. Cherry shrugged. \"i'm in a poetry mood...\" Forte hid a smile, he loved her poems. Cherry took out her notebook and started to write her misery down. \"Well, see you in the morning.\" Forte said. \"See you...\" Cherry said drearily.[Chapter 19] The next morning, Patch, Colette, and the Buddies all woke up. Alpha woke up first and turned to the Buddies. \"Your parents are waiting for you.\" \"Mom, Dad, here we come!\" Buddha cheered. \"Lead the way, Alpha.\" Patch said. Alpha took the lead. Colette and Patch walked side by side while the Buddies filed behind them. 'Don't worry, Mom and Dad, we're coming.' Rosebud thought to herself. It took a little while, but Alpha led them to a fence with a chunk of the bottom cut out. \"Beyond this fence lies the vineyards where your parents are being held,\" Alpha told them. \"Now it's up to you to rescue them.\" \"Why don't you stay with us forever so you're all not alone?\" Rosebud asked. \"We wolves are needed in the forest as much as you are needed by people.\" Alpha replied. \"Do you ever get scared?\" B-Dawg asked. \"Sometimes, but that's why we howl,\" Alpha told him. \"To let one another know that even though we may feel alone, we never really are...\" he then left them to fetch Buddy and Molly and he took his leave back to his home. \"Thank you very much, Alpha!\" Colette called. \"Namaste.\" Buddha added. \"Thank you ever so much, Alpha!\" Patch added in. Alpha smiled to them and continued to return to the forest. The Buddies thanked the wolf and they made their way through the fence's entrance. They were now in a whole new garden and soaked up the fun that was called wine country. \"Okay, let's start looking for your parents.\" Colette said. Atticus's car passed the farm that the Buddies, Patch, and Colette were at earlier. \"Who goes there?\" Billy demanded. \"Friend or-\" he then noticed who was there. \"Oh, excuse me, Cherry...\" he chuckled sheepishly. Cherry poked her head out from the car window. \"Excuse me, Billy, have you seen five puppies with a Dalmatian and female cocker spaniel?\" she asked the goat. \"Actually, yes, I ha-a-a-ave.\" Billy said. \"Really?\" Cherry asked. \"Well, where are they?\" \"Those dogs passed through here yesterday, but have already gone ahead.\" Billy informed. \"Aw, we missed them?\" Mo sounded disappointed. \"That tells us that we're going the right past.\" Atticus said. \"They went that wa-a-ay.\" Billy turned his head to one direction to the road they were driving toward. \"Thanks, oh, and umm... No need to tell John and Nancy I was here, right?\" Cherry sounded nervous. \"Ah, you're fine,\" Billy chuckled. \"They've gone to a farm convention anyway and Daisy Belle's watchin' us.\" \"Thank goodness...\" Cherry sounded relieved. \"Thanks, Billy!\" she waved as Atticus went back to driving then. \"Anytime, Cherry, anytime.\" Billy nodded to her. \"We'll be there in no time.\" Atticus said. \"Cherry, you know this farm?\" Mo asked. \"I kinda don't wanna talk about it...\" Cherry sounded distant again. \"But yeah... I'm kind of family here against my will.\" \"We'll talk about that later.\" Forte said. \"Hm...\" Cherry shrugged and stared out the window with her music on. \"I hope Patch, Colette, and the Buddies haven't gotten into too much trouble.\" Mo said. \"Oh, what could happen?\" Cherry mumbled with a shrug. Everyone looked to her for saying that, then looked back at the road as they were getting closer than they thought. \"Let's hope that nothing bad has happened.\" Atticus said. \"Oh, please be okay...\" Mo whispered, putting her hands together as a tear rolled down her cheek. While Atticus, Mo, Cherry, and Forte continued to drive there, Patch, Colette, and the Buddies continued to look for buddy and molly. \"Oh, we're almost there!\" Colette gushed with delight. \"I hope you five learned something from all of this.\" \"We did, we did...\" the Buddies replied, sounding truly sincere this time and were actually going to go through with being adopted into different homes. \"Good.\" Patch nodded. They stopped once they came close to the home entrance where their parents were. A big black stretch limo pulled up and the Buddies stood their ground. A couple of men and a little boy wearing a bow tie came out. The driver moved back into the driver's seat and shut the doors after them as the man was on his cell phone and the boy followed, looking a little unhappy. The Buddies then rushed to follow, but stayed quiet, there had to be a way in somewhere. \"Okay, there's gotta be a way in.\" Patch whispered. \"Let's try around back.\" Colette suggested. \"Good idea!\" Rosebud agreed. They rushed around back. \"Hey, check this thing-\" Budderball stopped once he saw a deep hole in the ground, but fell into it and yelled out as he fell. \"We're short a Budderball again.\" MudBud groaned slightly. \"I'll go after him.\" Patch said going down the hole. \"I'm going too!\" MudBud went after. Soon, all of the Buddies went down the hole together and found it actually fun on the way down. \"Oh, bother...\" Colette sighed, debating whether she should go down or not. \"Um... I'm sure Patch will keep an eye on them... Buddy, Molly, it's me, Colette!\" she then went off to find a way inside the mansion. \"Colette?\" Buddy and Molly's voices asked. Colette put her ear up, then followed their voices. \"Buddy? Molly?\" \"Over here.\" Buddy said. Colette followed their voices and eventually found them, but they were nearly dirty as their messy son. \"Oh, Buddy, Molly!\" she gushed once she saw them and gave them a little hug, but then backed up and winced. \"Ooh, you guys wreak! No offense of course.\" \"That's alright.\" Molly reassured. \"What are you doing here, Colette?\" Buddy asked. \"I was looking for you with Patch and the Buddies.\" Colette explained. \"The Buddies...\" Molly slowly gasped. \"Are they all right?\" \"They're fine, they really miss you, but they went down this hole in the middle of the ground and-\" Colette explained. \"Wait, did you say a hole?\" Buddy asked. \"Yes, why?\" Colette asked. \"We just came out from there to escape.\" Molly explained. \"What?! Oh no this is terrible we have to go down there and get them out of there hopefully patch will be able to stall the bad guys again.\" Colette said. Buddy then turned his head. \"I hear other voices...\" Colette and Molly heard them too. Atticus's car had pulled up and they were now walking out of the car. \"Finally, I didn't think we'd ever get here...\" Cherry sounded exhausted. \"As soon as we get home, I'm taking a nap.\" \"Okay okay fine but right now we have to go and find patch Colette the buddies buddy and molly.\" Atticus said. \"Yeah...\" Cherry agreed. Colette, Buddy, and Molly rushed over. \"I found three of them...\" Forte muttered. \"Collie!\" Mo hugged her cocker spaniel. \"Oh, thank goodness... I was worried about you...\" Cherry saw Bdudy and Molly coming toward her. \"Oh, no, no, no!\" They tackled her down and licked her. \"Aw, get off!\" Cherry groaned as they licked her face with her down on the ground. \"Buddy, Molly, Colette, we're so glad you three are okay, wait, where are Patch and the Buddies?\" Atticus asked. \"They've gone down a hole...\" Colette sighed. \"We were escaping ourselves and we had run into Colette, I'm afraid they're trapped now.\" Molly pouted, feeling like a bad mother. \"What can we do?\" Buddy asked. \"Ask for the Buddies and Patch back and no one gets hurt?\" Cherry suggested, wiping her face from the slobber. They all then heard men being hurt from inside a building along with barking. \"That's Patch's barking.\" Atticus said. \"Quick, over there!\" Mo pointed to one way, she may not had been a dog, but she had a sharp sense of hearing due to growing up around dogs for a few years of her life. \"Then let's go and rescue the buddies and patch while he's fighting bad guys along with protecting the buddies.\" Atticus said. \"Right!\" they all agreed. \"Good luck with that...\" Cherry said, playing with her phone. Mo walked over to Cherry, grabbed her, and dragged her with them. \"I can't do much.\" Cherry said to her. They ran inside to see Patch and the Buddies run up to them showing them that the Dalmatian dog and golden retriever puppies had escaped. Molly rushed to her puppies and nuzzled against them. The boy from earlier looked a little lost and disappointed, he had wanted to keep the puppies. \"Thank goodness none of you are hurt.\" Atticus sighed at the puppies. \"We were worried sick!\" Mo added, sounding like a hysterical mother. \"Calm down, Mo, you act like you're their mom or something.\" Cherry chuckled a little. \"I was just worried...\" Mo sighed to the Buddies. \"We're sorry...\" the Buddies told her. Budderball looked back at the boy seeing of how sad he was. Patch looked back as well, seeing that this kid needed a pet and looked to see that Budderball had the same look Patchhad when he decided that he wanted to be Atticus's pet. The bad guys wanted to get the dogs though and continued to chase again. Patch decided to have a word with this lonely rich kid after they would settle all this mess. As for the bad guys, Atticus took care of them, not holding back anything. \"We should help and give those guys a dose of puppy power!\" B-Dawg called. \"Yeah!\" the rest of the Buddies called. The bad guys glared at Atticus. \"Just what are you!?\" one of them snarled due to him being much stronger than they were. \"I am Atticus James Fudo!\" Atticus glared at the bad guys. The bad guys glared back and wanted to deal with him some more. Mo winced every time Atticus would get hit, but she just had to remember that he would be just fine. And where she was right, every time the bad guys would try to hurt Atticus by hitting him with punches and kicks, they just felt pain. Mo looked firm and decided to help Atticus a little. \"Mo, this might be dangerous for you.\" Atticus was worried for her safety. \"I've spent four years on the streets, I know how to defend myself against bad guys.\" Mo replied firmly and determined. \"Well, okay then.\" Atticus said. Mo nodded, looking serious and was going to help Atticus take down these bad guys. \"This'll teach you to kidnap Air Bud and his family!\" she snapped at them before showing she was really skilled in fighting, kicking and punching them. \"Wow.\" the Buddies said, amazed and surprised. \"Remind me never to get on your bad side, Mo.\" Atticus said with widened eyes. Mo smirked back to him. \"Forget my birthday and see what happens.\" she replied playfully. \"I promise I won't forget your birthday.\" Atticus said. Mo chuckled to that. The Buddies rushed to Mo and praised her, asking her all sorts of questions. \"Perhaps you have a demon inside of you?\" Buddha proposed. \"Probably...\" Mo honestly shrugged. \"I grew up on the streets, I had to learn how to defend myself and Angel was too small to be a proper enough guard dog.\" \"That also would explain it.\" Buddha shrugged. \"Now that's what I call girl power.\" Rosebud said. Mo laughed, scratching behind the female puppy's ears. \"Ohh, yeah, that's the spot...\" Rosebud said, enjoying that.[Chapter 20] The bad guys were now hung up on hooks by Atticus to keep them there. \"Sorry, Buddies!\" the smaller bad guy frowned. \"SHUT UP!\" the larger one told him. \"Don't apologize to them !\" \"Sorry...\" the smaller man then said to his 'boss'. \"Hey, if he wants to say sorry, then he can say sorry!\" Atticus glared at the larger man. \"Yeah!\" Patch growled at the larger man. \"He works for the bad side, he doesn't need to apologize!\" the large man retorted. \"That guy sounds like a kid with a toy truck.\" MudBud commented. \"Hey, Budderball, you know that kid over there does look like he's sad and could need a puppy to cheer him up.\" Patch whispered while pointing to the sad boy. Budderball looked to the boy. \"Surely he has enough toys to last him until adulthood...\" \"It's more than just toys,\" Patch whispered. \"Kids need a dog they can depend on and rely on. Dogs are nature's best friend for humans, and I think you would be a good best friend for that boy there.\" Budderball studied the boy and hummed, deep into thought. Would he be the perfect puppy for that boy? And he saw that patch was right the boy did look sad the human boy did have everything he ever wanted except for a pet or a best friend. Budderball whined quietly and walked over to the boy. \"I'm sorry they got kidnapped...\" the boy said. \"Whatever...\" Cherry looked away. \"I'm really sorry, it'll never happen again...\" the boy begged for forgiveness. \"I'm sure it won't...\" Cherry put her hands in her pockets. The boy then looked and saw Budderball was walking over to him and where it seemed like the puppy had forgiven him. The boy smiled, picking up Budderball, though struggled a little. \"Hey, puppy!\" Budderball barked a greeting to him and licked his face. The boy laughed and hugged the chubby puppy. The other Buddies saw Budderball bonding with the boy and thought that if he could do it, so could they. \"So, Buddies, ready to get back to Fernfield?\" Patch asked the rest of the golden retreiver puppies. The Buddies looked to each other, then nodded. \"Let's go!\" \"We got a big travel ahead of us, you caused a scare...\" Cherry said to the Buddies. \"Let's go, dogs!\" B-Dawg called, then rushed with his brothers and sister. Cherry let out a yelp and was trampled by the puppy rush. She then tried to get up and Buddy and Molly came over her. \"Ugh, why does this kind of stuff always happen to me?\" she moaned. \"I don't know, I guess you're just unlucky.\" Forte shrugged. Cherry looked up at him and shoved him to make him fall. \"So are you,\" she then stood up and dusted herself clean. \"Anyway, let's get out of here, it smells like wet dog...\" \"Yeah besides I'm sure that everyone has been worried.\" Atticus said. They all made it out and the police came to arrest the bad guys, not to mention one guy who had an eye patch who organized the whole dognapping hysteria. \"I'm sorry, I just really wanted Air Bud as a pet...\" the boy told Cherry, Atticus, and Mo. \"I didn't mean for any of this to happen.\" \"It's okay just next time be careful of the people you choose to help you get a pet.\" Atticus said to the boy. \"I understand, I'm just really sorry...\" the boy said. \"That's okay, kid,\" Mo smiled. \"Uhh... What's your name?\" \"Bartleby.\" the boy replied. Cherry hid a snicker. \"Bartleby...\" \"What a nice name, well, it's nice to meet you, Bartleby, my name is Atticus and this is my friend, Cherry, and this is Forte, and this is my girlfriend, Mo.\" Atticus introduced. Bartleby smiled that he was making new friends. \"Do you mind if I go with you so I can adopt the puppy I want?\" \"Not at all, we're gonna leave right now.\" Mo smiled back to him. \"Yeah it's going to feel great to be back at fernfield.\" Atticus said. Bartleby took his dad's limo while Atticus drove them home. Colette hopped over and reunited with Patch as they took a long ride home. \"This sure has been an adventure.\" Patch said. \"Indeed...\" Colette yawned, huddling up with him. \"Thank goodness the Buddies are going to cooperate, but we'll give them one last day with their parents before they go to their new homes.\" \"Agreed.\" Patch said. Colette and Patch spent the rest of the ride cuddling with each other and thinking about their future. Mo smiled at them and gently rubbed and pet them. \"Patch you're going to make a great father.\" Colette nuzzled against her mate. \"Thanks, Colette, and I believe that you'll make a wonderful mother.\" Patch nuzzled his mate back. \"Oh, Patch.\" Colette awed before they both kissed, dog style. Mo smiled sweetly to them and looked to Atticus with a small sigh. Cherry rolled her eyes, but said nothing, she just continued to stare out the window with her music on. When they got back to Fernfield everyone was happy to see that the were all safe and sound and where the buddies each were adopted by a kid they would be most close to. Buddy and Molly nuzzled their kids one last time and let them go with their new owners. \"Remember, the Twilight Bark.\" Patch reminded the Buddies. \"We remember patch but we will still be able to play together and you'll still be able to see us won't you?\" Rosebud asked. \"I'll see you as soon as I can,\" Patch promised them. \"Only time will tell us when our next adventure is.\" \"Namaste, Patch.\" Buddha told him. \"Namaste, Buddha.\" Patch said back. Buddha smiled and went off to his new owner. The Buddies all went to their new kids, happily going to them and having learned their lesson on running away from their problems which only made them worse. Budderball then rushed over to Bartleby. \"Have a great time with Bartleby, Budderball! And try not to eat all of the food!\" Patch teased about the last part. \"No promises!\" Budderball called back as he was going into the limo with the rich boy. \"That's what I'm afraid of.\" Patch chuckled. \"Do you think Budderball might eat all of Bartleby's food?\" Colette asked. \"Maybe or maybe not, can't tell with that pup.\" Patch said. \"I'm so proud of them,\" Buddy said about his puppies, then looked to the Dalmatian. \"Thank you so much for your help, Patch.\" \"No problem buddy anytime you want me to watch after the buddies I'll be there in an instant.\" Patch said. \"We would love that,\" Molly smiled fondly to him. \"So, when are you two going to start having puppies?\" Patch and Colette looked to each other bashfully and nervously chuckled in response. Buddy laughed a little. \"Give them time, Moll.\" \"You're right they will have their own puppies in due time.\" Molly said. They all then shared a little laugh. Molly sighed as the Buddies were now going to their new homes and start their own lives. \"You know if you ever miss them you can howl at the moon.\" Patch told them. \"I know...\" Molly sighed. \"I'm just going to miss them so much.\" \"Cheer up, Molly, they're not gone forever.\" Buddy soothed her with a nuzzle. Buddy and Molly then decided to run along home themselves. Patch then decided to walk Colette home. \"This sure has been quite an adventure filled with excitement.\" Colette said. \"Yes, it has...\" Patch yawned a little due to how much they experienced. \"I'm sure the Buddies will have a happy ending too.\" \"Yeah,\" Colette said to him. \"Thunderbolt was right, you really are one of a kind.\" \"Aw! Thanks Colette but I don't think this is the last time the buddies will be having an adventure.\" Patch said. \"I have a feeling you're right.\" Colette smiled sweetly. Patch smiled back at her before nuzzling her. Colette nuzzled back and yawned a little. \"i'm going to take a nap.\" \"Good night then, see you soon, Collie.\" Patch said to her before turning around and going right back home. Colette smiled sleepily and went into her home backyard, went through the dog door, went by the fireplace, turned around a little, and took a well-deserved nap. And where patch was right there would be many more adventures awaiting for the buddies but that's for another story. The End ","Summary":" A/N: Based on an RP back in late September...

Later that Summmer... Terri Fletcher had an awesome summer with Jay and her parents. He even spent two weeks with them in Paul's room of course and not hers. They had barbeques and the best Summer of their life as a couple with more long walks on the beach and late night talks. But all that came to a crashing hault when Jay got the call that he had been invited to join a very popular band called Three Days Grace, the same band her and Paul went to see that very night he was killed. Jay hated to leave but he had to and both him and Terri had promised to keep in touch through emails. And phone calls. That lasted maybe several weeks. One evening, coming from her Aunt's place, Terri came to check her email at her music school. After not hearing from Jay for several weeks; Terri finally got an email. From Jay it said: Terri, Hi there. I'm sorry I haven't called or written any emails over the past two weeks. Things have been pretty hectic on the road here, and after most performances I am dead tired. I hope things are fine with you and your folks. Terri, I think we need to start seeing other people. This long distance relationship thing, is hard, and you and I know that most long distance relationships don't work. If I was there with you, things would be different. It wouldn't be fair to you if we kept this long distance thing going, and you hardly being able to see me. I hope after this email that we can still be friends and keep in touch. Just know that keeping the long distance thing, will be hard to do and it is best to end things now and not lead each other along. I wish the very best for you Terri and keep singing! Love, Jay. After she read the letter, her eyes filled with tears. Jay had broken things off with her! Where did she go wrong in the relationship? Feeling angry, Terri shut the computer off unable to respond to Jay at the moment. First Paul leaves her, and now Jay does. When would anyone stay around her! Terri wanted to cry her eyes out but she couldn't because she would wake up Denise who was now snoring in her bed. Grabbing her jacket, Terri went to her favorite place up on the roof top over looking the city. She began to cry, unawere that anyone could be listening. Terri bursted out crying. The pain hurted so bad. Jensen gazed out of the plane, overcome by the expanse of land that stretched out before him, the unlimited directions in which his life could turn laid out before his very eyes. He soared above the clouds, merely an observer of the overwhelming amount of opportunity available below him, experiencing a world which he would never be able to fully explore, to fully know. Seeing his face reflected in the window, he smiled, knowing that he was finally beginning to grasp one of the worlds▓ infinite paths of life, and he had a purpose. The choice to teach at a music school had been a difficult one, as it required leaving the place he had known all his life to teach. He had often felt cooped up in his hometown, a typical small friendly place where everyone knew each other. That meant his friends remained the same from preschool through college, and everyone knew what everyone else was up to. That also meant that the world was an unexplored canvas to him, living in the confines of just a small corner for his whole life, and he was finally ready to explore and leave his own mark on the world. To others, his life in the small town had seemed to be the perfect life - on the school football team, looked up to by the little boys that lived there, musically talented, and with a good job. Yet the life that seemed perfection to others seemed routine to him, and he couldn't help but wonder what else was out there in the world, what he hadn't yet encountered. He couldn't spend his whole life wondering about what would have happened, and the predictability of his life began to bore him. The whole town had gathered to throw a party for him as he left. Tears were shed as they presented him with a memory book and he said goodbye to the family he had grown close to for his whole life. And now here he was, on his own for the first time with no one he knew, off to make a fresh start. He could write his own story, make it into anything he wanted it to be, something that wasn't boring or predictable. His mother had always told him when he was little that he could grow up to be anything he wanted to be. He had always imagined a life in the town, taking over his father's business. And now that he could go beyond that, he felt liberated. Music had always been something that he loved, and Jensen looked forward to being able to share his talents and experience with the most talented young people from around the world. Terri continued to cry up on the roof of the school. Worried about her youngest child, even though Terri was now becoming a beautiful young woman, Terri's mom and dad followed her to her Music school to check up on her. Ever since Paul died, Terri was on an emotional rollar coaster ride. And the next few weeks were going to be difficult. Terri had ran out of the house and straight to school with her Aunt. Without telling her parents what was going on. They found her up on the roof of the school overlooking the city. \"Terri, sweetheart\", said her mom concerned for her daughter. Before Jay, Terri had never had a boyfriend before. \"What happened?\" she asked. Terri looked up her eyes still filled with tears \"He broke up with me. Jay broke up with me! We were so happy! I keep wondering what I did wrong!\" she briefly told them about the email and what all Jay had said about life on the road. Her mom hugged her close \"Oh Honey, I'm so sorry to hear all this! But Honey, Jay is right, long distance relationships never do work out\". she hugged her daughter closer. \"But you know what, Jay isn't going to be the only boyfriend you'll ever have. You will find Love again and next time, it might be the real thing\". Terri looked at her mother \"You think so?\" She sniffed still clinging to her mom. She didn't bother to ask her parents why they followed her here, she knew they were being concerned. \"I know so sweetheart. Your father is living proof of that\". she smiled over at Simon. Terri sighed as the tears continued to fall \"Then why does this hurt so much?\" she asked. Making no move to move from her mom. \"Sweetie, it will hurt for awhile. But then your life will go on, and you'll meet some other new guy and will forget all about Jay\". she smiled. Terri slowly cried herself to sleep in her mother's arms. It was now her second year at the Music School and she wondered if she could carry on with her music without Jay around, They had always played and sang music together. Terri wondered what did life had in store for her now. Who would be there for her when things got tough, when she had bad days, and when she was missing Paul terribly? Still to this day, she blamed herself for telling him to sneak out. Had she not done that, he would still be with them. Jay had always been there to comfort her. Now that he was gone, she felt like she had no one at the school to cry on their shoulder with.She had her parent's of course, but they couldn't always be there. Terri often lay awake at night wondering where her future was going. Would she ever become the popstar she always dreamed of being? Would she get to travel the world, with her soulmate by her side? More questions often ran through her head as she desparately tried to sleep. WOuld she ever get married and be happy just like her parents if not happier? What if she was destined to be alone? Terri's mom looked at Simon \"We better get her back to her dorm, before they notice she's missing\". she handed Terri to Simon who was still asleep. Surprisingly Terri wasn't heavy to pick up. Simon held Terri, gazing down at her face with concern and love in his features. He had always been overprotective, telling himself that it was for Terri's well-being. It had taken him so long to realize that he was only holding her back that he wondered what else she might have experienced, had it not been for him. He brushed the thoughts aside and told himself that he had only done those for her benefit. Taking care of Terri was so hard sometimes - he had trouble finding the balance between what was too protective and hardheaded and what was being too lax. He figured that the former was better than the latter, so he kept her tightly held. He was glad now that he realized that she couldn't be locked up forever, and that it would only lead to her resentment. To someone who merely observed their family, he may have seemed like a villain who was holding Terri back from everything that she wanted and dreamed of, but there was another, more tender side to Simon. He cared about his daughter so much, maybe too much, that he couldn't help but worry about her and keep her on a tight leash. She was the only child he had left, and he thought that he was able to protect her. His actions were out of love and came from the depths of his heart, not because he wanted Terri to be miserable. He only wanted her to be happy, but her safety came first. Thankfully, he had gotten over his confusion and reached a balance - while he still wasn't quite comfortable with her going off on her own to a boarding school all summer long, he knew that he needed to trust Terri's judgment. After all, it had never led her down the wrong path before. As of now, his protective side was furious with Jay. He knew that if he thought it through rationally, he would have realized that it wasn't Jay's fault, that long distance relationships frequently didn't work out. However, emotion and rationality had never gone hand in hand, and he quickly allowed his anger to get the best of him, washing away the reasoning that his mind tried to bring to his heart. He had always had a soft spot for Terri's tears, and the fact that they had been caused by someone who she had loved and trusted with her heart made him all the more furious. He looked down at the beautiful, serene sleeping face in his arms, now stained with tears. He couldn't stop the haunting feeling that maybe he had been right in the first place... If he hadn't let Terri go to that school, then she wouldn't have met Jay, and then she wouldn't be in pieces right now... No. He couldn't think that way. She could get hurt no matter what she did. What was that old saying? \"It is better to love and have lost then to never have loved at all.\" And Terri had so many happy days with Jay, that though she was sad now, she would be able to get over it. Thinking back on one of his dear friends who had passed away, Simon realized that though the pain of losing him was unbearable, he would have made the same decision to befriend him if he had to go back in time. Happiness was worth the pain, sometimes. Without either, you would go through your life emotionless, never really living. And as he carried Terri back to her room and laid her down, gently tucking her in under the blankets and hoping her wounded heart would patch itself up and grow even bigger despite the hurt she felt, he felt a renewed hope that everything would be alright. The morning came soon enough. Terri woke up to the sound of students playing music down the halls. Her roommate was gone to where... Terri slowly glanced at the clock a little after 8?! she was suppose to be in her singing class! Nearly freaking out, Terri immediately got up, showered, then got dressed and then put on some jeans and a comfortable pink t-shirt. She didn't have time to curl her hair so she wore it straight and applied very little makeup. Grabbing her purse, she went out to the door and to the theater, where they were suppose to meet their teacher. She walked inside the theater wanting to hide herself from everyone. She knew she was late, and that probably wasn't a good thing. She noticed soem students were onstage practicing a skit of some sort. She found Denise and sat beside her. \"Girl, you are so late\", said Denise. Terri yawned and sat down \"I Know. I've been going through a lot the past couple days\". Terri grumbled not really in the mood to talk about Jay. Denise raised an eyebrow \"Do tell. How was your summer since you spent it with a hot guy?\". Terri looked at her \"The Summer, it was fine and Jay and I had lots of fun. But at the end of the summer, Jay broke it off with me since he had to go on tour with Three days Grace\". Denise looked at her friend concerned. \"OH my gosh. Terri I'm so sorry to hear that. How are you handling things?\" Terri tried not to show any hurt to her friend that moment \"Not good. Last night I was a complete mess. All I kept doing was cry my eyes out around my parents\". Both her and Denise turned their attention back to the stage. A young man possibly in his twenties was talking to several students on stage. He looked handsome, a bit too young to be a teacher. \"What is he doing here? Where is the teacher we had last year?\" asked Terri somewhat confused. She hadn't heard about a new music teacher moving here. \"OH that is Jensen Ackles, our new music teacher. The other one retired early\", said Denise. Terri kept staring at Jensen wondering why their former teacher wanted to retire early. He was handsome, movie star material; But she couldn't be thinking about another guy already, or could she? \"Great, now we have to learn how to do things all over again\", she mumbled grumpily mostly to herself. Terri wasn't in a good mood that day; and things with Jay were bringing her down. She wasn't even sure she was in the mood to sing that morning. Terri slumped in her seat. Denise looked at her friend \"Girl, you might need to wake up on the right side of the bed\". she joked with Terri. \"No thanks, I think I can deal\", she told Denise. And then she slumped in further in her seat. \"...And just let me know if you need any more help,\" Jensen finished with a smile, glad to be able to get along with the students. With that, he began heading back to his seat, realizing that the announcements were going to begin soon. Nearly tripping over a chair that lay just behind him, Jensen caught himself in the nick of time and quickly glanced around to see if anyone had seen him stumble. Thankfully, all of the staff had their attentions focused elsewhere. Sitting down with relief (and to avoid any more inconveniently positioned chairs), he surveyed the students. His attentions were immediately captivated by a girl whose eyes lit up as a knowing smile crossed her face. Her eyes sheepishly flicked away as he looked towards her. Well, it appeared that someone had seen his near-trip over the chair after all. The girl had turned to the girl who sat next to her, and since she was involved in a conversation, he was able to watch her without arousing her suspicion. He was struck by the glimmering blonde hair and passionate eyes that sparkled as she spoke, conveying her emotions and feelings as much with her face as she did with her words. She wasn't just beautiful - so many of the women he knew had an empty beauty. Instead, she radiated warmth and beauty from the inside as well as the outside. Shaking his head, he tried to clear his mind of these thoughts. His eyes moved slowly over the rest of the students - a girl, eyes darting around shyly, looking incredibly out of place; two boys, doubled over in laughter at a memory from camp before; a group of friends hugging and jumping up and down; a boy in the corner, drumming on the back of seats with drumsticks pulled from his pocket. The room was so alive, filled with excitement and potential. His eyes darted back to the blonde girl, almost of their own accord. As beautiful as she was, he could tell from her expressions that she had been hurt. As she spoke to her friend, he could almost feel her pain pouring out from behind her soulful eyes, and he couldn't help but wonder what had made her so upset. He hoped that it wouldn't distract her from what her goals were that summer. Every person chosen to attend was so talented, and he knew from experience that letting your problems interfere with your goals didn't allow you to fully focus, and he didn't want that to happen to her or to any of the students there. A much better way, he found, was to connect your emotions and channel them into your music and art - it made the creations so much more genuine. He made a mental note to hint at that if he ever had the opportunity to get to know the girl better. Her eyes darted towards his once again, and his heart sped up. No, his heart couldn't have sped up. She was a student, he was her teacher. That was all. Yes, that was all. As Terri and the young vocal coach teacher kept exchanging glances, every now and then Terri would shyly look away after she smiled back at him, of course. He made her blush! Not only was he cute; he was a total hottie! But she couldn't be thinking all this so soon, she was still emotionally hurting from when Jay broke things off with her. Little did she know, that Mr. Ackles sensed her pain even from across the room. Both her and Denise talked some more before the announcements started.Despite what she went through with Jay, Terri was eager to start back school and she hoped to learn more songs to sing at competitions and stuff. Last summer had been a fun experience. She was a bit let down that her former music teacher Mr. Torvald wasn't there any more.Terri remembered when she had first come here to the school. She had been new, and had problems fitting in and adjusting to her brother's tragic death. The older and wiser music teacher had offered her words of wisdom, which did carry her through- out the entire School year. Things had been much easier then to. Jay had helped her fit in with his group of friends. And the two of them had gotten really close. Not only were they boyfriend and girlfriend, Jay was her best friend at the time and would listen to her when things got tough or when she just simply wanted to cry on his shoulder about Paul. Losing Paul had been Terrible. But now losing Jay hurt even worse. Terri was a bit afraid if she got close enough to anyone that they would eventually all leave her. What if she was destined to be all alone the rest of her life? Who was she suppose to go to now when things got tough and she wanted a shoulder to cry on? The announcements started, and soon the Dean walked up on the stage to greet everyone who was new, and who came back the second year to achieve more goals. Mr Gantry welcome everyone back to another exciting Semester. He even went on describing what to expect at the end of the year. \"I am pleased to announce that at the end of the year, a major record label will be at the competition and they will look for a talented singer whom they see as a brilliant artist so they can sign them on. Along with that, the winner would get prize money\". The audience clapped and so did Terri and she tried to smile. She remembered last summer, she didn't win the competition. Deep down, she was dissapointed and she knew her dad was to. But she was happy for Denise for winning it. The girl was so super taleted, and could play the violin well. After the announcements were made and Mr. Ackles was introduced to the entire room, everyone was told to go to their right classes. Terri read on the paper that her and Denise had Jensen Ackles as their Music teacher. This should get interesting, thought Terri as she followed Denise into the classroom and found Jensen at his desk ready to greet each student. Their eyes made contact again for the tenth time that day. All through out the assembly, Terri could feel him occasionally glance at her. Of course she would blush and smile back. She acted really shy around him. As she now walked closer to him, Terri felt her legs turn to rubber. And, to top it off, she was actually speechless and wondered what she could say to him without it sounding totally stupid. \"So you must be Jensen Ackles, my friend Denise said you were the new music teacher\". said Terri. There. That was a decent start.[Chapter 2] Jensen couldn't help but notice the way the blonde girl's eyes lit up when the prize was mentioned. Oh, the whole room instantly became more exciting, of course, students whispering excitedly amongst each other, students pointing to others, pointing out who they thought would win while each was secretly hoping it would be themself. He couldn't blame them. But no one lit up as much as that girl did, her grief hidden for a few moments as she smiled and Denise whispered something to her. He could see the hope hidden behind her eyes - he recognized it in himself, from the town. He knew that all of the students didn't seem to carry the kind of ambition that the girl did. But then again, what did he know? He hadn't even spoken to her, yet! He had always been good at reading people, but that didn't mean he was always right. Lost in his thoughts, he was still staring out into space when the meeting ended and the students began to leave. He jumped ever so slightly as he caught sight of the girl walking up to him. \"\"So you must be Jensen Ackles, my friend Denise said you were the new music teacher.\" Jensen extended his hand to her, and she took it in hers and shook it. Her hand was warm and smooth, and he noticed a ring with a pink heart on her finger. He held on to it a second before letting go. \"Jensen Ackles, indeed. And you must be\" \"Terri Fletcher.\" her eyes smiled at him, though her mouth didn't as she nodded slightly. He smiled at her warmly, nodding back. His friendliness inspired her to talk to him more. \"So what brings you here to teach\" \"Well, I grew up in a small, friendly town. It was like what you read about in books. Everyone knew each other, everyone grew up together, everyone took over the family business or their parents' jobs and stayed there for their whole lives. No one new really came in, we were sort of out in the middle of nowhere. I was expected to just stay there my whole life, but...\" he trailed off. \"You felt like something was missing?\" Terri questioned, a knowing smile gracing her lips. \"Yeah, I did. There's so much out there in the world, you know? You can't let anyone hold you back. Life's just too short to dwell on the past and procrastinate about what might happen in the future. And I decided, for once, to take charge of my life\" Little did Jensen know of the effect his words were having on Terri. His words hit close to home after her breakup with Jay, and she realized that what she was doing was dwelling on the past, and Jensen was right, life was too short. \"I know what you mean,\" Terri said, and Jensen saw something deeper inside her, somewhere where his words must have made her think of something in her own life. He nodded, leaving her room and time to open up, if she chose to. \"All too well, it seems sometimes.\" she sighed, just slightly. \"Sometimes it's just hard to leave the past behind you before you miss out on an opportunity that's right in front of you\" Jensen could sense that she was hinting at something else, as the sorrow that he had seen in her eyes previously had now returned, and he felt his heart going out to her. He had always had a soft spot for a person in pain, and sympathy was one of his stronger qualities. She soon hid that part of herself, though, and replaced her sorrow with a guarded look. He realized the ways that her sorrow might affect her, and he felt inclined to help her. \"I know it can be, at first. But if you don't leave things behind you, you'll never move ahead. I'm not saying that you have to forget about them, because sometimes the happiest memories can end in sadness. What you can do is remember the happy times and learn from the sad times. Or else, you're right, you will miss out on something that's right in front of you. If I clung to my town, I'd never be here. The world's too big to cling to one part of it.\" He smiled, taking a breath. \"Opportunity is always knocking at your door. It's up to you to open it.\" He let that sink into her, looking her in the eyes for a moment. \"Opportunities like that scholarship\" As his words sunk in, the guarded look was replaced with a wistful, happy one as Terri smiled again. The expressions in her eyes were amazing. \"Now that I know your name, Terri, I actually have heard of you from some of our other teachers. It seems you're quite the singer\" Her cheeks turned a light pink as she shyly tried to hide her blush from him. His smile only grew. \"I've always loved music,\" she said. \"Ever since I was little, when I carried a cassette player around with me, singing along. Yet it never seemed like something I could really do for the rest of my life, there's so much talent out there. Until I heard about that record deal they're giving out at the end of the year. And then I realized that maybe I could do this for my life, maybe I could make enough money out of it, maybe I could even become famous someday. It's always been my dream.\" \"Mine, too,\" Jensen added softly. It seems like it's something everyone wishes for, deep down in their heart, to spend their life doing what they love. It's a shame that so many people can't do that. That's another reason I left the town. My father's a doctor, and he's never been too supportive of my music. He wanted me to take over his practice. When I left, he was mad at first, but we eventually came to an understanding\" \"I can definitely identify with you about your father,\" Terri said. \"I had to sneak here last year, but thankfully he knows I'm here this year and he's okay with it, for the most part\" \"So it is in you after all,\" Jason mused, laughing. \"Going for your dreams when the opportunity arises, I mean,\" he clarified at her puzzled look. He grew more serious. \"You really should go for that record deal, Terri. No matter what happens, I think it would be good for you to at least try\" She nodded. \"Jensen, are you ready? We'd better set up the classrooms\" \"Be right there,\" Jensen called. \"I have to go, Terri.\" She smiled and he touched her arm lightly. The girl was full of hope, life, and ambitions. He longed to help her follow her dreams. \"It was a pleasure meeting you\" She blushed again, cursing the fact that her face always gave her emotions away. \"You, too.\" she said, watching as he walked away, almost frozen. \"It was a pleasure meeting you, too,\" she whispered to his retreating form. As she watched him go over to help another Teacher set up the classrooms, Terri felt better after she had talked to Jensen. It was as if he understood everything about her, and they had only just met. And already they had several things in common. Both came from small towns feeling like something was just missing from their lives. Both loved music and singing it. One thing Terri noticed about Jensen, was when he talked to you, he looked deep into your eyes as if almost looking within your soul and reading your personality. She wondered what he thought of her. She could tell that He believed in her talent as he had told her to go for that record deal. Terri wanted that record deal, She deserved some happiness in her life. She joined Denise as they sat in their seats side by side. New students filed into the classroom and one girl kept her eyes on Jensen like he was a prize and something she could get. Great, thought Terri. Another student who had a crush on the young teacher. Though Terri couldn't blame her. Jensen was really hot. And when her and Jensen shook hands, Terri felt shocked by the electricity that seemed to pass right through them and he held onto her hand for a second like he didn't want to let go. Her hands were small compared to his and felt just right in his hand. Whenever she was around him, Terri got butterflies in her stomach. And she felt an instant likeing to him. She also noticed that when he spoke to her, he lightly flirted with her with his kind words, and by lightly touching her arm. When he touched her, Terri nearly wanted to jump out of her skin. His touch had sent goosebumps up her spine. Terri didn't want to think that what she felt around him could be love. Terri immediately shook herself out her crazy thoughts. She couldn't be falling for him hard already. It was too soon after Jay broke it off with her. And besides, a teacher falling in love with a student couldn't possibly happen, could it? If it did, they would have to be sneaky about it. Terri tried to get Jensen out of her mind, but it wasn't working. His voice and those kind words stuck into her head. \"Earth to Terri\", said Denise as she laughed at her friend's thoughtful expression. \"I take it, you've done talked to the new Teacher.Did he say anything interesting?\" she smiled at her friend. Terri looked at her \"Oh yeah! I got to meet him.He's a very nice man. And it seems we got stuff in common already\". A man that is way older than you, a little voice in Terri's head told her. \"That's really good. It's better to have a teacher whom you can get along with and he could help you win that record deal\". said Denise grinning from ear to ear. She could tell already that Terri was in love with Mr. Ackles. But she was trying to hide her feelings terribly. Terri nodded 'That is so true.\" Her and Denise talked some more until Mr. Ackles turned around asked for everyone's attention. Terri and Denise sat in the middle close to where Jensen could see them good, and listened to what he had to say.[Chapter 3] Jensen couldn't stop thinking about his conversation with Terri, the way he could read her so easily. As he had thought before, he had always been good at reading people and understanding them, which was why he got into teaching, but he had never met someone he could understand so soon. Now, more than ever, he was glad that he had left his town. He could really identify with Terri and the way she was feeling, because he had gone through some hard times himself when he was her age. Living in a small town did have its advantages, like he had told Terri about getting to know everyone. However, that also meant that everyone was into everyone else's business all the time. Who was dating who, who broke up with who, whose child was arrested for shoplifting, whose kid beat the deacon's kid up, all of that. He had been through a bad breakup after a relationship once, himself. It was funny how, when you were with someone, you couldn't help but fully believe that you were always meant to be together, no matter what. Nothing else in the world mattered, and no matter what was wrong with that person, you thought they were perfect. That was the kind of relationship he had been in once. The whole town thought they were a perfect, happy couple, him and Carrie. She was the beautiful, smart, popular blonde cheerleader, and he was the quarterback. The problem was, she was incredibly shallow. He tried to talk himself out of thinking she was shallow, though. He just made excuse after excuse for her, trying to come up with a reason for the way she treated others and acted. After all, she was so sweet around him, there must be some way to justify her behavior. In his eyes, she was the embodiment of perfection. And then, as he tried to bring her into deeper conversation and she seemed befuddled, and as she didn't see anything wrong with the way she sometimes treated others, he became more open to her flaws. Of course, everyone in the town still saw them as the perfect, happy couple. With nothing wrong. All of their problems were hidden behind closed doors. And so they remained, until one day, he tried to gently break up with her. She didn't take it to well - actually, that was an understatement. She went into hysterics, and as he hugged her and consoled her and eventually left her when she kicked him out of his own backyard, he went into his house, mulling over what had gone wrong and trying to sleep it off. However, she felt compelled to keep her reputation intact and made herself seem like a victim. Of course, since Jensen was trying to get over what had happened and was sitting in him room by himself, she made it seem to everyone else that he had done some terrible wrong to her and that he was hiding in shame. That brought a lot of confusion once he came out of the room and was bombarded with questions as he returned to school. Thanks to his close friends, he had been able to set things straight, but he had had a problem with dating people and trusting them ever since then. Once he broke up with her, he saw her for what she truly was, and the perfection he had once seen in her vanished. And now he felt those old feelings returning again, of being close to someone, only now, they were so much stronger. He didn't want them to return though, until he could know Terri better. She seemed so different from Carrie, though. He had such a wonderful conversation with her, where their age difference just vanished. He could never have had the same type of conversation with Carrie. He had helped many students in his career teaching music, but he had never felt such a genuine need to help someone as he wanted to help Terri. As he remembered the way he had felt after fights with Carrie, he realized that he recognized the same hurt look in Terri's eyes that had been in his. He couldn't help but wonder if a boy had made her feel that way. The power of love always amazed him, how incredibly happy or hurt it could make someone, seeming to hold the key to life and death. And he knew how much it hurt and longed to help her. Jensen looked up as the bell rang, his thoughts once again interrupted. Surprised, he noticed Terri sitting in his class, talking with the girl she had been talking with before. She seemed happier now, and he hoped that he had had a part in making her happiness come back. She was very attentive, smiling just slightly, and he smiled at her before turning and acting as though the smile was meant for the whole class, realizing how it might look weird to them. \"As many of you probably already know, from the assembly, I'm Jensen Ackles, the new teacher here. I've heard about some of you from the other teachers, and it seems I have a very talented class. We have quite a few people going for the record deal, I take it\" He once again felt the excitement go through the class, and most students happily nodded, and he recognized their excitement, as he had also felt that way himself. \"Well, then, it looks like we have a lot of work to do. Even more than last year. There's actually seven solos to give out this year, which will be based on your efforts as well as your natural ability and your voice. There's quite a variety of music, which is great for everyone. Well, I know that your goal is to win that record deal. My goal is to get you all used to singing different types of music, and stepping out of your comfort zones\" He glanced down at his seating chart. \"Jason Hobbes,\" he said, nodding as the boy met his gaze. \"It appears you're into rock music\" Jason smiled, his Led Zeppelin t-shirt obviously giving away his preferences. \"All the way,\" he stated as the class was laughing. \"And it appears that you're not into opera or classical too much, then\" \"You bet\" \"Well, that's what we're here to change. To help all of you work on your individual talents, but also to get used to some new styles. How can you know what you really like to sing if you've never tried anything?\" Terri sat back and listened to what all Jensen had to say and watched as he gave out solos. Terri hoped she would get to do several solos again this year like she done last year. Terri had fun with her solos last year as she had sung one pop song, and another rock song. Terri was into all types of music, except she didn't enjoy rap. Her main favorites though were Pop music and Rock. She did enjoy some Country though she hardly ever sang that. Terri remembered the happy memories when her and Paul would sing along to Three days Grace in the car until that fateful very night then he was killed. It had taken Terri some time to get back into music since she had been so hurt by Paul's death. Not only Paul was her brother, he was also her best friend who looked after her. Terri snapped out of her memories of her brother realizing once again, she was in the past a bit. Even though it had only been a year since he was killed, she still missed him like crazy and she wondered if the hurt would ever go away.She looked up and noticed that Jensen was giving out solos and decided to pay attention in case he called her name. Earlier she noticed he kept giving her a smile as she talked to Denise. Terri would glance back and smile back at him. Terri enjoyed their conversation earlier, it seemed that Jensen understood her better than anyone else other than her family. And they had only met today. He had lifted her spirit up some today just by talking to her and giving her some advice. Terri hoped that they would be able to have more talks like that. He just knew how to make her feel good inside. Things began to look brighter for Terri as she found herself looking forward to this class. Them singing different styles of music sounded appealing to Terri and she had always wanted to do that. On her profile for this class, Terri had written down that she enjoyed singing both Pop & Rock music. Her favorite bands were The Backstreet boys, Three Days Grace, and Journey. Her most favorite female singer was Britney Spears. She looked up to her a lot and admired her talent.Often, Terri would be found singing Britney Spears songs in her dorm whenever she was bored. Despite her pain over the breakup with Jay, Terri realized that she looked forward into making music, and that should be all that would matter shouldn't it? Besides, she couldn't have him stop her from singing just because he wasn't there. He had been right about one thing, she should still sing. But wouldn't it be hard to sing by yourself when you missed someone that hurt you so much? Terri had no idea that Jensen was still currently reading her and that he knew she had been hurt by a boy. Terri didn't feel like telling him her problems just yet even though that morning she came close to wanting to tell him how badly she had been hurt. She also didn't know that he was a former quarterback, voted most popular in school and was very interested in her. Terri's focused on Jensen again as he kept going down the list and soon got to her name. She wanted to look on the positive side of things and not bore Jensen to death with her breakup problem. Jensen continued to go down the list, skipping over some names and calling out select people to inquire about their musical preferences. He had quite the variety of students in his class. Now he was definitely glad that he had chosen such different types of music. He himself had been to music programs before, and the teachers had always stuck with opera and classical music. The music was certainly challenging and he did learn a lot, but there was only so much high-pitched soprano voices and deep bass he could take, not to mention the fact that most of the music they were singing was in another language. Singing something he couldn't even understand wasn't what he felt was the best way to get emotion across in the pieces, and that's what music was to so many people, after all. A way to convey emotion and feeling, a way to make the audience feel the way you do when performing. It was one thing to say I'm excited, and another to hear the loud drum beats and vibrant trumpets. And it was one thing to say \"I'm sad,\" and another to hear a lone flute playing softly, pouring out the sadness without the need for any words. In some ways, he thought, cursing himself for returning to thoughts of Terri, who he had been spending way too much time thinking about, it was like the way she could convey her emotions through her eyes. It was like he could feel the way she was feeling, because she was so expressive. Many people tried to hide the way they were feeling by having a guarded look over their eyes, cooping up all of their feelings inside of them. He had been that way once, but as he got used to expressing himself through music, he also got used to showing others how he felt and not being afraid. He had once seen the guarded look come up in Terri's eyes, just once, but he knew that he couldn't blame her for doing that. After all, he barely knew her yet, no matter how much he felt like he knew her. He had no clue if any of his guesses and inferences about her were actually correct, or not. He had just been making assumptions, assuming them to be accurate, and trying to offer her advice based on them. He couldn't help the thought that, with the amount of emotion she showed through her facial expressions, she must be one amazing singer. He couldn't wait to hear her sing - he was glad that her lesson with him was right after class, so he could get to know her better and hear her sing. \"And Terri, what are your goals for this summer?\" Jensen knew that he wouldn't get as much of an answer now, because she was probably shy speaking in front of the class - he probably would have gotten a more detailed answer if he spoke to her in private. Nonetheless, he had been asking everyone else similar questions, so it was only fair to ask her. Terri was a bit caught off guard when Jensen asked her the question. She really didn't think she'd get to do a solo this year. But maybe she would now that he was speaking to her. And, she had no idea he wanted to meet her after class.He would tell her about that soon. Terri tried to think of something she wasn't that used to speaking in front of the class. When she wasn't on stage, Terri was quiet and shy around those she didn't know until she got to know them more better. \"I, um want to focus more on my singing solo, and I would also like to do other things to as well such as SongWriting.\" she said looking straight at him as she spoke. Truth be told, Terri hadn't thought that much about what she really wanted to do dealing with the breakup with Jay and still adjusting to Paul not being around to talk to. Terri had thought some about what she wanted to do like with what she told Jensen. Terri couldn't keep her eyes off Jensen as she spoke, he had this strange hold onto her. And the more they talked, the more butterflies flew about her stomach. It's just a crush she kept telling herself. Everyone has a crush on their teacher at one time or another. But what Terri tried to hide was the fact that she really was in love with Jensen, and deep in her mind, she screamed for him to just sweep her off her feet and listen to all the complaints she had to say. Terri wanted some prince that would keep her safe, and never leave her. Snap out of your crazy thoughts Terri Fletcher! she thought to herself. Terri wished she had spent more time in front of the mirror this morning and put her hair in wavy curls the way she wore it some last year and put on a bit more makeup. She never really cared about dressing up much until it came to boys. Since last summer. Jay had been her first boyfriend ever, and she was always nervous about what she wore on their dates and little things like that. But with this being just class, Terri figured she didn't need to wear anything fancy. Had she known she would have a hot music teacher, she would have prepared herself better this morning.However, she hoped she didn't look like crap. Had Jensen known about Terri's insecurities about her lack of attention to her appearance that particular day, he would have been stunned. He thought she looked radiant, inside and out. Anyone could have superficial beauty on the outside with a little makeup, but her beauty was on the inside, and it shone through. Not to mention, he thought with a chuckle, she looks great on the outside, too, which is always a plus. He couldn't help but add that. \"...And so I'll be seeing you all tommorrow, then,\" Jensen finished talking to the class. Everyone excitedly started discussing his class and their plans for the record deal and the solos, which Jensen could see were well-sought after. He couldn't blame the kids for going after them. He would have been trying to get them, as well. Even if they were all friends, they all seemed to have this secret inner desire to get the deal. But he was glad that most of the students were mature enough to get along - it always helped to have support and encouragement to boost your spirits and help you keep going. As all of the other students were there, he saw Terri slowly gathering her books, and he realized that she was probably doing it on purpose. Denise seemed to be waiting for her, and Terri whispered something accompanied by a hand gesture, and Denise gave her a knowing smile. As Terri continued to take her time packing her things away, Jensen became more confident in his earlier impression that she was gathering her belongings slowly on purpose, hoping that she would be able to talk with him again. Either that, or he was too confident in himself and was just imagining things. But as she met his eyes, he decided to just talk with her about working with her. She might find it odd if he just offered to work with her out of the blue, so instead he decided he'd just ask her to sing. Most of the students were gone by now, anyway. \"Terri Fletcher,\" he called, mentally cursing himself for using such a formal way of addressing her, and then realizing that it probably looked better if he called her that in front of the other students anyway, so they wouldn't think she was favoring her. \"Do you have a few minutes\" He saw her eyes light up. \"Oh, sure.\" She smiled, and then he saw her packing up her things slowly, still, pretending that was how she normally put away her belongings. After all, she wouldn't want to make him think she was just doing it to get a chance to talk with him. Well, at least that was how Jensen interpreted it. As before, he couldn't really be certain. But he did see her trying to suppress a smile as she packed up. \"I told you that I've heard a lot about you from the other teachers,\" Jensen said once the room was cleared and Terri was ready. \"You seem to be quite the singer\" Terri nodded shyly, blushing. He sensed that compliments made her uneasy, as they often did to him. \"And I couldn't help be intrigued by what they said, and I'd love to hear you myself to know how you sing and where you're at, musically\" He saw her eyes light up yet again, and he smiled warmly back at her. \"If you don't mind, that is\" Terri smiled back, and walked over to the piano. \"Do you mind? She gestured, as though to sit down. \"Oh no, go right ahead.\" He sat in a chair across the room about 4 feet away from her, to give her distance and space to relax. He didn't want her to feel like he was crowding her and making her nervous. He could tell that she was shaking a little, and he couldn't help but wonder what about him was making her so nervous, when the year before, she had sung in front of hundreds of people, both parents and her peers, with no problem. The song started out slowly, with a few chords from the piano, seeming to swing gently with Terri as she swayed with the music. Her voice amazed him. It was gentle, soft, sweet, and passionate, like a swan, yet grew with passion and volume and power as she lost herself in what she was singing. Her shaking went away and she seemed to be totally at ease with herself. He caught some of the lyrics, and felt that they really came from her heart, and that she was showing him some of her pain. \"If I told you who I was before, Would you follow me? If I told you that I sneak sometimes, If I told you that I love too much, If I showed you the other side, Would you follow me? Cause I'm shedding my skin So you can see my face, I need you to know who I am. I'm ready to go where I've never been, Will you stay around and follow me?\" As Terri sang, she kept her eye on the words in front of her and her heart on the song. It was almost like there wasn't anyone in the room once she got lost within the music. Some of her nerves went away as she got lost in the song to. Terri could relate to the song that she was singing. It described who she was inside and out. That she wasn't a perfect painted picture. Throughout the whole song, Terri felt like she was telling Jensen some about herself, and a little about what went on in her past. She did wonder what he would think and do if he knew that a year ago, she had asked her brother Paul to go sneak off to a Three days Grace concert while he was grounded, only to cause him to get killed later that night by a drunk driver and her being the only one to survive and carry guilt every where on her shoulders. What would he also think if Terri told him that she really did love to much and that people always seem to let her down or they just leave her? She loved Paul so much and he left. Then Jay left her Terri found it really hard to love someone again and she was afraid they would just only leave her. Terri did slowly pack up her things on purpose but she didn't know that Jensen already sensed that from her and had she known that he knew, she would have flipped out. The class had seemed so very short, even though it was an hour long. And through out the whole class, Terri knew that Jensen kept exchanging glances with her. She didn't know why, but being around him in general just made her nervous. Was it because he was hot and someone she barely knew? Terri thought maybe that was both and that if they got to know each other more, she wouldn't be as nervous around him. She finished the song and played a few more cords on the piano and then finished the music all together. She looked up when she was done.[Chapter 4] Jensen couldn't help butnwonder as the song kept repeating \"If I told you...\". Thenwords were so beautiful, but that wasn't what made the song. Thensong was complete because he felt that she was singing to him,nspeaking to him from the depths of her heart. He couldn't stopnhimself from wondering if maybe she really was trying to tell himnsomething. He put his emotions aside and tried to think it throughnlogically. It wasn't as if she was really speaking to him, she wasnjust reading words written about something else, by someone else. But the way she put so much feeling into it, it made him feel likenshe was telling him how she felt. Did she really want to tell himnsomething? He wanted so much to help her in every way possible. Notnjust with her music, but with everything. With her life, withnwhatever she was so sad about. It was just a matter of getting hernto let him into her heart. Wait, what was he even thinking? Into hernheart? No, not in that way, not like in a romantic way. Shenwas just a student. He was so much older than her, and it would benwrong to be together. Then a little voice in thenback of his mind reminded him that she looked to be about seventeen,nand he was only 25. Eight years weren't such a big age difference,nnot when some girls were marrying men old enough to be their fathersnor even grandparents. But then again, many relationships were builtnon a basis of wealth and power. He never wanted that, he wanted tonspend the rest of his life with someone who would make it whole, makenit complete. He wanted to spend it with the person who, after he hadnexperienced their presence, he couldn't imagine spending the rest ofnhis life without them. But no, he couldn't be innlove with Terri. She was his student, and that would be wrong on twonlevels. Age and position. He simply wanted to help her, right? Henkept telling himself that over and over, trying to make himselfnbelieve it. Even if it turned out that he did love her, he couldn'tnact on it, anyway. After all, it wasn't as if she could love himnback, and he didn't want to turn into one of those pedophile teachersnwho force themselves onto their students because they couldn't acceptnrejection. Then again, he thought,nshe did smile and blush whenever she saw him. No, no, no, he scoldednhimself. Even if she did have a crush on him, there was a line drawnnbetween a crush and love. Many girls with a crush on someone oldernwould have no clue what to do if they were actually with the person. The way she kept saying,n\"If I told you,\" though. If she was really talking to him,nwhat was it that she wanted to say? He wondered if she really didnwant to open up about the hurt that she felt inside, and a big partnof him wished that she did, because he so longed to help her. Butnjust as a teacher would help a student, right? He shook his headnonce again to clear it, realizing he was again going around inncircles that even he couldn't follow or comprehend. And it was a good thingnthat he did clear his head, because just after he did, she wasnfinished. He thought back on the song, admiring the way her voicenhad filled the room, she had such a remarkable presence about her. There were people who could sing well and act well, but they justndidn't give off that natural aura of talent and emotion the way Terrindid. She really was talented. \"Terri, you have anreal talent there. So many people can sing the right notes at thenright time, or follow a piece of music, but do you know why theynaren't famous? Do you know why they don't get what they dream of?\" Terri said nothing, merelyncocked her head slightly to the side. \"Because they don'tnput their feelings into it. When you were singing, I felt like younwere really talking to me, that you really did want to open up tonsomething,\" he said this to also drop a slight hint that henwould be open to what she wanted to say. \"Music is there tonbring out your emotions that you can't put into words. And that'snwhat you did, and that's what comes naturally to you. That's why youngot into this school, that's the incredible gift that you've beenngiven, that's why you have a strong chance of winning that recordndeal, and that's why,\" he paused, \"I'd like to help younreach your goals. If you're willing, I'd like to teach you.\" Terri smiled slightly asnhe gave her all these wonderful compliments. A bunch of people hadntold her she was very talented, but it sounded differentnand nice coming from her music teacher. He was right about one thingnthough, she was speaking to him through the songnshe chose to sing. It did tell him some about her life, though not inncomplete detail. And he kept dropping hints thatnhe wanted to hear what was bothering her. Terri had always heard itnwas best to talk to someone about your problems andnnot keep your feelings hidden deep down inside. And sometimes it wasnjust a good way to get emotions out. Terri sighedna little hesitating and thinking that Mr Ackles was a sincere caringnperson and it might be good to open up tonsomeone. \"Thank you Mr. AcklesnI would like for you to help me if it's not much trouble and if itndoesn't take up all your time. I do usually expressnmyself and my feelings into my music and my songwriting whenevernpossible. Sometimes I sit up late at night writing annew song pouring my feelings into it. This is just one of the othernpieces I spent writing last week. You are right aboutnone thing, in the song, I was directly speaking to you. This year andnlast year has been a huge emotional rollarncoaster ride for me. The song I Just sang talks about two people whomnI have lost and I did love\", Terri turned her head awaynslightly a few tears rolling down her cheeks. How embarassing! Now henwas going to see her cry. Terri wiped her eyesnaway and continued \"My boyfriend just broke up with me last weeknsometime. He did go to school here with me last year,nand most recently earlier this spring, got a job to go on the roadnwith Three Days Grace. I came back to the School afternnot hearing from him for several weeks. Then I get this email, and itnsays Terri I think we should see other people,nthis long distance relationship thing isn't working.\" Terrincried some more angry at herself for bringing her problemsnup to her teacher and hoped she didn't seem like another whinynteenager to him. Terri continued seeingnthat her problems weren't boring him but totally surprising him andnhe had a look of concern on his face like he cared fornher. \"Anyway. Jay was like my other best friend. Not only was henmy boyfriend, but he was more of a friend to. Injust thought we were in love and I thought we would always bentogether. Ever since I came back to here, I keep wonderingnwhat I did wrong to cause this to happen\", Terri began to crynagain the tears coming out more this time. And shencouldn't hold them back. \"Terri...\"nJensen began, feeling his heart go out to her. \"I know you feelnlike it was your fault. I know that, once you're in a relationship,nyou tend to forget about the other people who love you. You begin tonfeel like there's only that one person in the world, and just for thenfirst time, you feel like someone truly love you who wasn't obligatednto, who chose you. Someone who completely understands you, and wantsnto be with you no matter what. Someone who you can tell everythingnto. Someone you feel like you were meant to be with and will nevernbe apart from. That's why it hurts so much when you break up. Allnof that trust seems like it means nothing. It seems like that lovenis gone and everything is broken and shattered, and you can't pick upnthe pieces by yourself. It seems like everything you've ever donenwith that person doesn't even matter any more. But you can't look atnit like that. Think about everything happy that you've done withnJay. So many happy things end in sorrow, butndon't stop doing what makes you happy just because you're afraid ofnthe sorrow. Learn from it, and cherish the memories, but don't dwellnon what went wrong, because it wasn't your fault.\" \"Remember that anrelationship is two people. Not one, two. Two very differentnpeople, who get together and try to become one. They shareneverything and become a part of one another. Then something changes,nand the person who once seemed to be perfection isn't perfectnanymore. You wake up one day and the spark is just gone, just likenthat. And you know what? It's not the other person's fault. It'snno one's fault, there's no one to blame. It's just fate saying thatnmaybe you're not right for each other after all, maybe you were meantnto learn from each other and help each other along the way, but younweren't meant to be together for the rest of your lives. If younstayed with Jay and got married, you could have wound up followingnhim around on his tours for your whole life. And you're too talentednto do that, you have too much potential to waste it by not goingnafter your dreams. He might have held you back. Fate just hasnsomething different in store for you. It's not your fault. Peoplenchange, it has nothing to do with you. You did nothing wrong. Younhave to realize that.\" He touched her shoulder gently, and wasnsurprised to feel her lean into him slightly. Taking a chance, henput his arm fully around her shoulder, relieved that she didn't tensenup or pull away. \"Look outside. Donyou see what I see?\" he asked, pulling away slightly so shencould look. She glanced out the windownand shook her head. \"Let me show you. Insee buildings full of people. People who are happy, people who arencrying, people who are in relationships. I see a whole world ofnpeople taking advantage of their opportunity. And I see people whondon't. I see birds that soar to higher skies every day. I see a sunnthat makes all of this possible, a sun that makes its way pass thenclouds every day that try to oppress it to bring life to all. Cannyou see all that?\" This time, Terri nodded. \"Look in the mirror.\" Terri probably saw puffy pink eyes and a tear-stained face. \"I see a bright,ntalented, young girl. Someone who has too much potential to dwell onnthe past. I see a girl who has been hurt, I see a girl who has lovednand has lost and is in pain. And I can see opportunity in her eyes. I can see that she wants to get past this, but she needs to trustnherself and realize that it takes time. I see a girl who is much toonmuch talent to miss out on what could happen to her right now, likenthat record deal. I see a girl, no, woman, who is too strong to letnthis get in the way of her dreams. I see someone full of life. Donyou see her, too?\" Terri was a bit stunnednthat Jensen thought that much of her and no one had ever called her anwoman before. She did see what Jensen was talkingnabout but she didn't know how she could ever be that girl againnwithout him helping her. She needed his help more thannever to get over this. Terri couldn't deal with the breakup on hernown. True, he was right about a lot of things. Shendid want to get past all this and focus on her goals. She wanted tonget past Jay, get past Paul and just concentratenon her music. She wanted to be happy again and full of life. Becausenshe was sick and tired of all this crying. Out of all people, Terrindeserved to be happy.She wanted to get that record deal more thannanything she had ever strived for, but how was she goingnto do that, when she was so upset over this breakup? Terri wonderednif she would ever meet someone that would trulynbe her soul mate, and wouldn't leave her no matter what. Terri slowlynnodded at what Jensen said \"I see what younmean Jensen. But I just don't feel like that girl you see right now.nI'm sad and hurt, and I do want to get past this butnI'm going to need some help. I can't do it on my own\". shensniffed and grabbed a tissue and leaned back into hisnchest. \"I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of laying in bed at nightnwondering what is going to happen next to come crashing downnon me\". Terri found comfort with him just holding her like henwas and she needed someone she could cry on. Terri continued onntalking. \"Jay's not the only one I've lost. My brother Paul diedna year ago in a car wreck killed by a drunk driver. I wasnwith him, but I was the only one that survived. I woke up in thenhospital to find out that my brother my other bestnfriend died because of my selfish wants. The day of his Graduation Inhad bought him and me some Three Days Gracenconcert tickets. Paul at the time had been grounded because our dadnis strict and tends to try to keep us on a tightnlease. He only does it because he cares for us. So anyway, I toldnPaul it was Three Days Grace and our only chance to seenthem. I convince Paul to sneak out. And so we do and when we get tonthe concert we have a fabulous time. On the ride home,nwe're so busy having fun and singing along to a Three Days Grace cdnwhen we don't know of this drunk driver coming nearnPaul's side until it's to late then everything goes black, and last I hear is this sound of metal being crushed. You cannimagine how awful I feel once I find out Paul is dead. I blame myselfnfor weeks for his death. And I still do. If Inhadn't told him to sneak out that night, Paul might still be alive.nNow I have to live with that guilt every day\".nTerri cried some more missing her brother terribly. Jensen knew from his ownnexperiences that sometimes there was nothing else you could do for anperson when they were hurt and upset than offer them comfort. So hendid, holding Terri for a long while as he let her cry until her tearsnbegan to subside. \"It's just so hard,nkeeping this all inside sometimes. Like there's no one to turn to,nand I'm all alone, without Paul and Jay. My friend Denise knows, butnI feel like such a burden telling her. And I feel like such a burdenntelling you. My parents know, but they're not here, no matter hownmuch they care, they can't be here, so I'm just alone, trying to holdneverything inside, and now it just came pouring out, and.. and...\" \"Shh... I know it'snhard. You've been through two big losses. Loss is never somethingneasy to get over, I'm not going to lie to you. It'll take time, andnthe emotions you're feeling won't go away right away. It depends onnthe person, it can take quite a while for the feelings to go away. But it helps to have someone beside you. Terri, I don't want you tonfeel so alone. Remember how we said before that everything happensnfor a reason? I don't know what it was, and I don't want to try toncomprehend it, because I never knew Paul, but I'm sure that he was anwonderful person if you cared about him so much. I'm sure he wouldnhave wanted to have fun during his life and die earlier than gonthrough it suppressed by your father. It's not your fault that hendied. People go out, and they have fun. Every time you leave yournhouse, you take a chance that you might not return. You take anchance that something could happen to you, no matter what you do. You never know what will happen. Paul took anchance by leaving the house. So did you. It just happens thatnsomething did happen, and it took Paul's life. But that's not yournfault, that's never your fault. It's part of life, and every lifencomes to an end sometime. It's tragic if it's cut short by annaccident, but that's part of what happens.\" \"I want you to knownthat you're never alone. I know how alone you feel, but if you evernneed me, I'll be right here for you. Please don't be afraid to comento me, because I don't want you to go through this summer feelingnthat nobody cares. I promise you that you can get past this. Sometimes you just need someone beside you to be there if you evernwant to talk, and I promise you that I'll stay here for you. Nonmatter what.\" Terri nodded \"Okay, Inwill come to you. Thanks for being such a friend. \" Terri leanednagainst him still crying some but his voice soothed her as he spokento her. Terri was surprised at hisneagerness to help her. Most of the time if you had problems, peoplenwanted to avoid them and not even help. And Terri understood that. She never wanted tonbe a burden to anyone. At least she wouldn't be a burden to Jensennbecause he seemed like the type of person who cared and was a great listener. Whatnwas even more surprising was how he held her in his arms as shencried.She couldn't think of anyone much more passionate than thisnyoung man. Even her father nevernreally liked to listen to her cry. How could she blame him? \"It's nice to havensomeone to talk to\", said Terri after her crying had died downnsome. His voice was enough to calm down her nerves some.nTerri wondered if Jensen felt the special connection they shared atnthat moment. Terri felt like her feelings were muchnmore than just a crush for him. But if she had mention this, it mightnscare Jensen away and he would want to go teachnsomewhere else. Terri felt it was best to keep those feelings hiddennfor right now. She leaned against himnmore glad to have someone she could hug and hold onto for that briefnmoment. It felt so good just to hug someone whonactually cared. Not because they felt like they had to be there, butnthat they wanted to be there for her. She was glad shenstuck around after Class. Now she felt like she had more friendsnthere. As Terri began to pullnaway, Jensen rubbed her shoulder before letting go. \"You goingnto be okay?\" Terri nodded slowly. \"I'll manage. Thank you. For everything.\" Jensen waved his hand. \"Don't worry about it.\" You're worth it, he added quietlynto himself. \"Listen, Terri, I've been thinking. I know hownbadly you want that record deal, and from what I've heard, you're annamazing singer and after what you've been through in your life, youndeserve it. I have a lot of time off when I'm not teaching classes,nand that time is intended to be spent working with students, amongnother things. I'd really like to help you win that record deal, andnif you want, I could work with you on your music over the summer.\" The smile on Terri's facenmade all of his words worth saying, and everything he had said toncomfort her seemed to be rewarded as she smiled, truly smiled, fornthe first time in what seemed to be quite a long time. Sure, she hadnsmiled before, shyly, but this one reached her eyes and radiatednthroughout her, even though it was only a small curve. Hey, it was anstart. She nodded. \"I'd really like that.\" He returned her smilenwarmly. \"Then it's a deal. Let me know if you ever neednanything. See you tomorrow after class, I hope?\" She nodded again, and hensmiled to himself as he watched her leave the room after thanking himnagain. As he had told Terri,neverything happened for a reason. Everything in life. If he hadn'tnmoved out here, he would never know her and would live the samenmundane life as everyone else in the town did, and he couldn't standnthat. But it wasn't just that. He felt like there was some reasonnhe was meeting her, some twist of fate that brought her to him in herntime of need. Maybe his part was to help her, he thought. Shendeserved happiness in her life, and she deserved that record deal,nnot only because she was so talented but because she had been throughnso much pain and sorrow, and she was still going through a lot ofnhardships in her life. But was the reason he met her only so henwould be able to help her, or was it something more? Why did he keepnfeeling this urge to help her? No, he wasn't, he couldn't be fallingnfor her. She probably just reminded him of the way he was once, andnthat was why he felt so drawn to her. And because of those eyes...nNo, he scolded himself. Stop thinkingnlike that, you can't fall for a student. He had always wanted tonhelp people, anyway. And this was someone in dire need of help. That was all. It couldn't be anything more, right? Terri left the music roomnthat day feeling refreshed and it felt like a huge burden was liftednright off her shoulders. Jensen had been nothing but supportive andnkind; and listened as she cried and explained everything. Terrinwalked to the Cafeteria hungry because it was lunchtime. Today theynwere serving fried chicken, mashed potatoes and Green Beans. Jensennwas already in the teacher's table talking with some other Facultynmembers. Sighing, Terri took hernlunch tray and was going to go sit at one of the tables but no onenelse seemd to want to sit with her or let her sit with them; so shentook the tray outside feeling frustrated as she sat where she wasnlast year on the Stairway banister of the School. Terri expected hern2nd year at this school to be better. As she ate her lunch, Terrinrealized that she was still a loner.And a gifted student who wasndifferent from the others. Some kids probably thought that shenthought of herself as better than them. Which wasn't true. Shencouldn't even be popular or fit in with a crowd. Terri looked around andnsurveyed her surroundings. There were couples everywhere eithernliplocked. or holding hands. She even spotted her friends she hadnhooked up last year Sloane and \"Kiwi\" Wilson in a majornliplock a few steps down from her. Terri wanted to say hi to them butnwould only feel like she was intruding. Suddenly her thoughts wentnback to Jensen. The way he held her in his arms, there had beennsomething there. Hadn't it? There was Genuine concern in his voicenthe way he talked to her tryign to soothe her and consol her. Andnheld her made her feel safe. It was as almost as if he was fallingnfor her, No, thought Terri shaking her head. He was just her teachernand he just wanted to help. Terri didn't know at that moment, a girlnstudent who was jealous of her and Jensen mostly jealous of hernwanted to start trouble. Trouble with her and was glaring at her. Jensen felt slightly outnof place as he chatted with the other teachers. After all, they hadntaught together for years and years, and felt like a newcomer. However, they were all very kind and made an effort to include him. That combined with his natural way of talking to others made him feelnmore comfortable. They were all incredibly insightful and talented,nand he felt lucky to call himself one of them and hoped to be able tonlearn from them. He excused himself for anmoment to get more food, when a student came up to him to talk. Henwasn't surprised, students came up to him all the time for support,nguidance, or simply when they needed someone to talk to. He nevernminded giving a few minutes of his time to chat with someone or helpnthem, and he really rather enjoyed it. That was another reason whynhe liked teaching. He had an opportunity to really get to knownpeople and help them, and it made him thrilled when his students feltncomfortable around him, enough to open up. And of course, that lednto thoughts of Terri again. He could see her in the lunch room,nlooking rather unhappy. He figured that she just needed time to getnover everything that she had been going through and time to meetnpeople. After all, it was the first day of classes, and she hadn'tnreally had a chance to talk to anyone yet. There were plenty ofnpeople to get to know. He decided that she'd be fine just as thengirl game up to him. She had curly brown hair. Her eyes didn't seem to have the same warmth as Terri's. They lookedncolder, a little sharper and wary, but still open and slightlynfriendly when she smiled. \"So I've heard you just came here.\" He suddenly realized that she was in his class earlier thatnafternoon, and he struggled to pull her name out of his memory. Whatnwas it...? Something with a T? No, and R... Rob? No, that was anguy's name... \"Hi, Robin,\" hensaid, gauging the reaction on her face and realizing with relief thatnhe must have called her by the correct name. \"What are you upnto?\" \"Oh, just gettingnmore food. With the money we pay to come here, you'd think that theyncould come up with something better than this.\" she wrinkled hernnose. Jensen was a little takenna back by her comment. She appeared to be pretty spoiled, or she wasnjust stuck up. After all, they didn't come there to eat, they camenthere to learn music. But nothing prepared him for her next comment. \"Good thingneverything here isn't that gross,\" she said, tossing her hairnback and giving him a knowing smile, which he returned uneasily. Shentouched his shoulder and he felt his awkward feelings grow. Itnwasn't like the kind of warm, gentle touch he gave Terri. No, thisnwas different somehow. He hoped the othernteachers weren't watching. It looked wrong to have a studentnflirting with him. He went to remove her hand from his shoulder. However, to remove it, he had to take her hand in his, which shenprobably took as a sign of his interest, even though he dropped hernhand from his as quickly as possible. Great, just what he needed. Anstudent with a crush on him who thought he liked her back. Hensmacked himself in the forehead as she left with more of a smirk thanna smile on her face. Terri had decided toncome back into the cafeteria and finally saw a seat available fornher to sit down. Not caring if anyone saw her, Terri sat down andnate lunch. The food wasn't that great, but it was better thannhaving nothing to eat and by now, Terri was hungry enough to eatnanything. Not to far away, was the Faculty table and Jensen sat with the other teachers. Of course he would thought Terri. Henwouldn't eat lunch with a student. She sat and ate her meal whilenlooking about the Cafeteria. What shocked her next was when Robin approached Jensen. By her tone and the way she eyed Jensen, Terrininstantly knew that Robin was into Jensen and she was flirtingnwith him. Terri saw that Jensen was uncomfortable around Robin atnfirst and had a forced smile on his face. Was it a forced Smile ornactual flirtation? Then he took Robin's hand in his. IN his hand. Unable to watch anymore,nTerri didn't finish her meal. She had lost her appetite. Terri gotnup and went to throw away her remains of her lunch. By the time shengot ready to leave the cafeteria, Robin was no longer near Jensen.nThe way she saw it, towards the end; Terri thought Jensen enjoyed Robin's flirting.Terri walked outside to get some fresh air and toncontrol her emotions. But as soon as she stepped outside andntowards the stairway, Terri bumped into Robin. Her least favoritenperson in the world. Robin smiled at her in ancold way. \"Terri Fletcher. So how are you and Jay doing?\"nshe had her arms crossed, and her friends stood by her side allnseemed to be sneering at Terri. \"I\"m surprisednyou haven't heard by now, since your the gossip queen Robin. Jay andnI broke up\". said Terri not in the mood to talk or to put upnwith Robin. \"Oh. Very sorry tonhear that. But then again, Jay does somehow know his way around. Thatnnew vocal teacher Jensen is his name?\" asked Robin. Terrinnodded. \"We had anninteresting conversation. I believe he likes me. I'm going to go fornhim, and that record deal. Have a nice day, Terri\". Robin saidncoldly messing with Terri's emotions to get her upset. It was all Terri could donnot to cry again. She tried to walk past the girls but then Robinnstuck her foot out tripping Terri on purpose. \"Oops, You neednto be more careful and watch your step Terri\", she said out loudntrying to be friendly in case anyone saw or heard. What she didn'tnknow was that Jensen was close by and saw everything. The other girlsnlaughed. Terri then lost hernfooting, then her balance. She fell forward unable to stop herselfnunable to grab onto anything to break her fall. \"Agghhhhh!\"nshe screamed. Jensen was normallyneasygoing. It took a lot to make him angry. Enough years ofnteaching had given him a pretty hard shell. But his compassion fornTerri was so overpowering that he couldn't stand seeing her hurt. And Robin... not his favorite student, let's just say. Not by anlong shot. And kids bullying each other was what really set him offnbecause he had also dealt with bullies when he was in grammar school,nespecially, before he needed to develop more muscles for football. So by this time, Jensennwas quietly fuming as he watched, but so far there wasn't much hencould do. Kids picked on each other all the time, usually becausenthey were jealous of someone or wanted something from them, andninterfering would only make the bully retaliate. That was why he hadnnever spoken up when he was bullied, because it only made thensituation worse. But when they were physically harming someone, thatnwas another story. Jensen already sensed that something would benhappening, judging from the normal progression of fights. He wasnjust walking down the steps so they'd see him watching and hopefullynstop, but apparently Robin couldn't see him. She wouldn't have beenncontinuing this behavior if she could have seen him, after all. Justnas he was about to move up again, he saw that familiar smirk onnRobin's face as she pushed Terri down the stairs. Had Jensen hadnmore time to think, he would have been more than a bit surprised atnwhat Robin had done to Terri. Normally, when girlsnfought, it was more verbal. That kind of thing was harder to prove,nanyway, if Terri ever told anyone. Plus there were no witnesses onnTerri's side. Well, there were, but Robin didn't know about that. But if they did to Terri what falling down those steps could do, theynwould definitely leave more than a few marks. But that could haveneliminated Terri from Robin's competition for the record deal, asnJensen realized later. He bet Robin was willing to go to extremenmeasures to win that record deal at any cost, and she probably sawnTerri, talented and beautiful, as an obstacle. Little did he knownthat wasn't the only thing Robin saw Terri as an obstacle for, stillnnot knowing that Terri had a crush on him. And, of course, he had nonclue about what had happened between Robin and Jay. So here he was. Jensennfelt a rush of adrenaline throughout him, and he lunged forward, hisnfootball training giving him an advantage over the stairs that seemednto be against him, trying to prevent him from reaching Terri so hencould save her. Jensen reached her in the nick of time and caughtnher in his arms. Time seemed to stand still, with everything frozen,nto Jensen for just a moment. Probably because everyone was in shock. Robin was standing with her hand over her mouth, those sharp eyesnfilled with jealousy and rage. Her friends just looked stunned andnhe suspected that, though they had certainly played a role in hurtingnTerri, they had been dragged along by Robin and had no idea what theynwere in for. People like Robin usually looked for people who werendesperate for friends. One of the girls had so much compassion onnher face, he couldn't imagine blaming her. That was why he wasn'tntoo angry when the girls ran away, all except for Robin. Theyncertainly played a role in what hadnhappened, but should they run off, he could come after them later. They didn't seem to be too much of a threat that they themselvesnwould do anything to Terri. Jensen had no idea how wrong they'dnprove him. He couldn't recognize them all to go after them later,nafter all. There were too many. Robin looked down with jealousy andnscorn, seeing that she had helped place Terri in Jensen's arms. Jensen looked down atnTerri, seeing her hair had fallen over her face and brushing it away. He set her down and carefully helped her sit down. She looked verynweak, probably stunned. \"You okay?\" he murmured, and shennodded, dazed, tears frozen in her eyes. Robin smiled at himnflirtatiously. Oh, she did not have the nerve to keep flirting withnhim after all of that. There was no way. Yet she giggled lightlynand said, \"Oh, Jensen, Terri's just so clumsy. I'm sorry shenhad to be such a burden,\" she emphasized \"burden,\"nknowing it was Terri's soft spot, \"for you to catch. It's goodnthat you're strong enough to help her. But maybe I can be a betternjudge of that a little later,\" she winked. Jensen felt ragencoursing throughout him, and started running up the steps, with nonclue what he'd do to her once he caught her. Had she not run throughnthe door and disappeared amongst the kids in the cafeteria, he maynhave gotten fired for what he wanted to do with her. He realized that she innher impulses hadn't thought her actions through, and hadn't realizednthat he would see her in his class tomorrow. Or he could always huntnher down in the dorms later tonight. The thought brought a smile tonhis face, despite his anger and concern. At least he could deal withnher there. She had too much nerve to sit there and flirt with himncoolly after what she had done. She didn't even seem fazed by thenfact that she had just pushed Terri down the steps! And then justntrying to brush it off like that... He walked down the stepsnquietly, so as to not upset Terri, and sat down next to her, puttingnan arm around her. Terri couldn't believenwhat had just happened. Robin had some nerve tripping her and makingnher fall down the stairs towards to a bad injury or possibly worsenlike breaking an arm or leg. Terri felt herself lose her balance andnfall forward. She came closer to hitting the ground when out ofnnowhere, a pair of strong muscular arms grabbed her around the waistnpreventing her fall. Terri felt stunned by whoever had saved her andnfelt somewhat surprised to. No one had ever gone out of their way tonsave her like this before. ' Terri found out that thenperson who saved her was Jensen. He broke her fall by catching hernsafely in his arms and still held her even when they had stoppednfalling in which Jensen landed perfectly on the ground with Terrinstill in his arms and Robin and the others watching. Terri wasnstunned by Jensen's sudden rescue. He must have witnessed the wholenscene and sprung into action to save her. Though Terri didn't see himnuse his football training but others had witnessed the heroic event. Terri didn't know thatnJensen used to be a football star back in his hometown. She had nodded when henasked if she was okay. Her eyes threatened to bring more tearsnbecause Robin was so mean to her. Terri hated being so emotional andnit embarassed her to cry around Jensen. He probably thought of her asna baby. Robin hit a sore spot of Terri's by calling her a burden innfront of everyone especially Jensen. And she had some nerve flirtingnwith Jensen even after what she had done to Terri. Terri had anfeeling that Robin could sense the special connection between her andnJensen and was extremely jealous of it. Robin had been jealous ofnTerri ever since she came to the school. The Jealousy grew morenintense when Terri began dating Jay. Because Robin and him used to benan item as well until both of them had changed, was how Jay had putnit. Terri had found out thatnRobin was a spoiled rich girl who had always gotten her way. And ifnshe didn't get what she wanted, then others around her wouldnsuffer.Terri realized that winning this record deal wasn't going tonbe easy. Robin was going to go up against her against all odds,ndetermine to win that record deal. And now, what was worse, was thatnshe wanted Jensen and would probably get him somehow. Terri felt hernfeelings now for Jensen was more than just a crush. Her heart wouldnbeat wildly when she was with him. And it was beating wildly now innsuch a steady rush just after he had saved her. Terri saw thatnJensen's rescuing her caused Robin to be angry and more Jealous.nWhich could make problems get worse for Terri later on. But at thenmoment, she was glad Robin was angry and Jealous. She hadn't count onnJensen to come to Terri's rescue just in the nick of time. Terri smiled at him as henput his arm around her. She wanted to lean into his chest for comfortnagain just to feel those strong arms around her again, but they werenaround people, and Terri didn't want to make any wrong moves thatncould get him into trouble. For now, she and Jensen would tellneveryone that they were just friends if any questions were to benasked. For right now, Terri had to thank Jensen for saving her life.nIt seemed the right thing to do. \"Mr. Ackles, thanks for umnsaving my life. Where did you get the quick reflexes?\" Terri'snvoice asked in a amusing voice. She was impressed with his heroicnactions. She wondered if he made a habit in saving people like that.nIt made her like him more. Terri wiped some of the tears away fromnher eyes. It was embarassing to let him see her cry like this.She hadngotten so used to calling him Mr. Ackles. Jensennwas tempted to ask Terri to call him by his first name instead of Mr.nAckles, but immediately thought better of it, amused at the idea ofnthe other teachers seeing a student walk by calling him \"Jensen\"nwhile the rest called him \"Mr. Ackles.\" Yeah, like thatnwouldn't look weird. And it would be really weird for him to tellnTerri that - he'd be making it so obvious. He thought for a momentnof calling her \"Miss Fletcher\" just to kid with her, butnthought better of it. She wasn't in the best mood. Though her voicenwas light and teasing, he could see that tears were still coming fromnher eyes. Henrealized that his arm around her shoulder in front of all thesenpeople had been fine at first, because, well, he liked to protect andnhelp and comfort her, and because he had just saved her, so naturallynit was just an act of compassion. But if he kept it there for toonlong, people would probably find it a bit suspicious. He didn't wantnher to think he didn't want to touch her, though, because that wasn'tntrue and it would make her feel worse. So he gently rubbed her armnfor a couple of moments before grazing his hand across her back as henpulled his arm from around her. Still, Terri looked hurt. Jensennlet out a frustrated sigh inside. At any other time of the day,nthere wouldn't be any people around. But no, of course this placenhad to be filled with crowds of people right now. \"Comenon, let's get you somewhere inside,\" Jensen said, trying tonsmile at her to ease the hurt she felt. Terri nodded lightly and hentook her hand to help her up. Hey, that couldn't look suspicious. She just nearly killed herself. Thennhe realized he had never answered her question. \"Years ofnfootball in my hometown,\" he stated coolly, looking slightlyndown to see her face as she walked beside him. \"Nevernbeen much for sports, myself,\" Terri stated. \"As younprobably guessed from my graceful fall,\" she said, and Jensennsaw that she was trying to joke though she didn't feel like it on theninside. Henled her into the library, where it was pretty much empty. \"Comenon, follow me,\" he said, leading her down the hall. There wasnan old, unused room where he used to hang out with his friends whennhe attended the school. It was slightly run down, but cozynnonetheless. It had a fireplace for the winter, a curtained windownfor the summer. It was one of those windows that you could see outnof but couldn't see into, which meant that Jensen could come herenwhenever he needed to to enjoy a private view. He had used thisnplace a lot when he was younger to practice without anyone hearingnhim or to just think about life and read. It was nice to enjoynprivacy and time for himself after being around people all day, evennthough he did enjoy their company. Eventually, he had stopped comingnto the room and instead taken to the roof. It offered a morenbeautiful view, and he felt so in tune with nature, with the windnblowing fresh air into his face. Henwalked over to a couch and sat down beside Terri. The couch was runndown, but it made it all the more comfortable. Jensen smiled down atna stain he had made in the couch years ago, remembering the cherrynjuice he brought. Not the best thing to be drinking in a library,nespecially when drinks weren't even allowed there. Jensenninstinctively place his arm around Terri again. If he had known shenthought she was being a baby, he would have been shocked. Everyonencries sometimes, and he knew that she seemed like she didn't want toncry, but couldn't help herself. It wasn't like she was doing it fornattention or anything. Shenbegan to cry, tears slowly going down her cheeks. She wasn'tnhysterical, just worn out and the shock of falling down the stairsnwas wearing off. She probably felt embarrassed, as well, though hendidn't know why, but her cheeks were turning red. He hoped that shenwould open up to him once she was through crying. He guessed she hadnsome history with Robin that he didn't know about. Girls like Robinnusually had a motive. Terrinsuddenly began to let the tears fall. She didn't want to sit therenand cry her eyes out in public, because that's what Robin wanted. Tonsee her cry. Shencouldn't believe Robin basically tried to kill her but of course tonget that record deal and Jensen meant that Robin would try anythingnto make Terri stay outnof her way, and what she wanted to have. Terrincried if it hadn't been for Jensen and his quick reactions, Terrinhated to think what might have happened to her. She appreciated himnsaving her, and for looking afternher to make sure she was safe. And she did feel safe as long as henwas with her. She noticed no one else was around, so she leaned intonhis chest and felt hisnarms wrap around her again in a comfortable embrace. She felt so safenthere she didn't want to be released from his arms any time soon. Jensennoffered safety and security the way that no one else did. And Terrinneeded that in her life. She needed someone who could protect her andntell her that things were going to be okay. Because sometimes, she just felt like fallingnapart. Life could be so unfair. Robinnwanted to destroy her life. She wanted to make sure that Terri didn'tnget that record deal or even compete against her. Robin didn't likencompetition. Robin wantednto be a star and the heck with everyone else's problems or what theynwanted. Thought Terri. She wanted to make sure Terri stayed therenanother year attempting to get her chance innbeing a singer. Terrindidn't understand how could someone like Robin be so jealous of her,nwhen Robin had more than Terri had. Robin was rich and always got hernway. Terri was thentotal opposite. She came from a poor family that worked forneverything they had, and her dad struggled for years just to keep anroof under his kids heads. Somehow, theirndad always had a job, and always kept everyone fed. Terri thought tonherself, if she ever became famous, she wanted to help her family outnjust as they always had withnher and Paul. Aunt Nina would be able to keep her farm that she had, and Her Dad and Mom would always have a job without ever having tonworry about being laidnoff. Or worrying about not paying the bills on time. Robinnas far as she knew, had never worked for anything in her life. Terrincried for awhile in Jensen's arms then slowly she dabbed her eyesnwith a tissue from a nearby tissuenbox. She guessed that Jensen wanted to hear all about her pastnhistory with Robin now as he had witnessed the whole scene outsidenjust now. \"Robinnand I have been Enemies ever since me and Jay started dating lastnyear. She saw me as a threat since that day and has been giving me anhard time even since. Bothnher and Jay used to date for awhile until things between themnchanged. LIke Jay said, they just didn't have that spark anymore.nThen when me and Jay dated, Robinngave us a hard time then, and she even tried to steal him away fromnme. Robin cornered me today and said that she thinks you like her andnthat she was going fornthat record deal, and even you\". Terri wiped more tears from herneyes with the tissue and listened for Jensen's response.[Chapter 5] Jensen felt his handsnthreatening to clench into fists as he heard of Robin, and had tonhold back so he wouldn't hurt Terri in his anger. Hurting her wasnthe last thing he wanted to do. When she put the tissue down, hentook it from her and wiped away one more tear that was rolling downnher chin. His fingers brushed her face for just the slightestnmoment, and his heart sped up. He wondered if Terri could feel thenpounding, for he could surely feel it. He was so overcome by hernpresence that he was at a loss for words, his thoughts so filled withnher that, for a moment, he could barely even remember what she hadntold him, let alone what to say. He regained his composure asnquickly as he could. \"I hate to say this,nTerri, but Robin's probably not the last person like that you'llnencounter in your life. It seems like she's the first, but thenchances of her being the only one are like the chances that you'llnwin the lottery three times in a row. You're incredibly talented,nand people are going to be jealous of you. Robin wants what younhave. The problem is, she has no clue how to get it. You haventalent that you worked for and deserve, and you've been through a lotnof hard times to get to where you are now. Robin, on the other hand,nis also talented. But she seems to be the type of person who takesnit for granted. She probably doesn't need to work for things as hardnas you do, and she's used to getting her way. Right now, you standnin her way. And she's the type of person who can have very littlenempathy for what other people are feeling. She doesn't care how hardnyou worked for what you have, in her mind she's the one who deservesnit, just because she's used to it. Honestly,nbetween you and me, Robin infuriates me. She kept flirting with menand touching me. I've never really known how to react when anyone,nespecially a student, does that when I don't like them. I felt badnpushing her away, even though she was obviously breaking the ethicsnof a normal student-teacher relationship. But I had no clue whatntype of person she was, and I hate hurting people's feelings, so Intried to be as gentle as possible. Unfortunately, she took that as ansign of interest. She doesn't care who she has to step on, she wantsnwhat she wants and that's it.\" Terri nodded. \"Injust wish she's leave me alone. I can't deal with this this summer,nnot after everything else.\" \"I wish it was thatneasy, Terri, I really do. But you deserve to hear the truth, well,nat least what I think is the truth. I don't think she'll stop. WhennI was in high school, I made quarterback on the team. Of coursenthere were people who wanted the position that I'd worked for for sonlong. One person in particular had a father who had donated a lot ofnmoney for the team, and he wanted to be the quarterback and hadnalways assumed he would be. Then I joined and got the position, andnhe's been bitter to me since then. He's done some really nastynthings that I'd rather not talk about right now, but... that's thentype of person you're dealing with, Terri. Up until our last game,nhe wouldn't leave me alone. And I don't think Robin is going to,neither. I'll tell you what, I'm going to find her in her dorm and gontalk to her, because I can't deal with her behavior anymore. I havenno clue what type of punishment she could receive, but I'll make surenshe isn't just let off. I'm sorry you havento go through all of this, I know it must be hard on you to have tondeal with Robin on top of everything else. I'll do everything I cannto keep Robin away from you.\" Terri listened to Jensennas he told her about Robin and how she wouldn't be the only personnthat didn't like Terri in her life. He was right. Robin wasn't goingnto stop going after what she always wanted or wanted in life. Thenonly best thing to do, was to just deal with things, leave Robinnalone, and let Jensen handle her. It was his duty as a teacher tonkeep bullies from harming students. As he held her in his armsnand wiped away her tears, Terri could feel his heart beating in hisnchest fast. Whenever he was near her. Was she making him nervous?nTerri hoped she wasn't making him uncomfortable in anyway. But thennagain, he made her heart beat wildly to. Everytime she was near him. It felt so nice to be heldnlike this. She felt so safe in his arms like nothing or anyone couldnever harm her. Terri got the feeling that Jensen loved to protectnher. Terri almost forgot what it feels like to be loved, protectednand wanted. Sure her parents and Aunt Nina all loved her. And, shenthought Jay had loved her to. But the one thing she never actuallyngot to experience was real true love. From the opposite sex. What wasnthat like? When Jensen told her henwas going to confront Robin, Terri couldn't believe he would do it.nHe was going to find some way of punishing Robin. Terri just hoped hendidn't do anything drastic that would cost him his job. She carednabout the teacher and liked him a lot. And more than anything; shenwanted him to always be there to help her get that deal. \"Jensen, thank you.nYour kindess towards me is so overwhelming. I've never had somebodynsave my life like you did before let alone confront the person thatnwas bullying me. Most teachers do nothing except stand there andnwatch and let things happen because they are afraid of gettingninvolved.It's touching you care so much about me\". Terrinwondered if he could just hold her awhile longer. It would be thirtynmore minutes before they headed back to class. \"Shhh, don't mentionnit,\" Jensen whispered, just as touched that Terri was glad andngrateful for his help. \"I'm glad to be able to help you. It'snnot easy going through things on your own.\" And as Jensen and Terrinsat there peacefully in silence, Robin was sitting around in her dormnalone, having told her friends she was practicing for the recordndeal. Truth to be told, she just wanted some time to herself.Robinnwas furious and humiliated. She did things on impulse far too oftennfor her own or anyone else's liking. She never thought that Jensennwould have seen her yelling at Terri. Se wished she could take itnall back, not because she felt bad for Terri, but now Jensen probablynthought badly of her. Great. Just when she was trying to makenthings get better this summer. And the look of rage on Jensen's facenwhen he caught her eyes was almost too much to bear. She was stillnangry with herself for running, she hadn't even stopped to think thatnshe was in his class. Or he could always find her in her dorm, andnshe'd be done for. It was so embarrassing to have Jensen yelling atnher and thinking she was an immature stuck-up brat when she wanted tonbe with him. Oh, and the tendernlook in his eyes when he looked at Terri. Robin could have kickednherself, really she could. She managed to bring the girl she hatedncloser to the guy she wanted. Robin sighed. She hadn'tnalways been this way. Stuck up, yes, but not vengeful. Why wouldnshe be jealous of anyone else? She already had everything she evernwanted. She had been a bright, happy little girl. Daddy's littlengirl, she thought to herself. And it helped that said Daddy wasnrich. Full of princess gowns and crowns and shoes. She had alwaysnbeen the envy of every other little girl. After all, she thought,nshe deserved everything that she had. She was beautiful and rich, sonthat qualified her for everything she had in her life. She didn'tnneed to work hard like everyone else. While all the other kids werenselling girl scout cookies, trying to earn a prize for selling thenmost, she had her father buy thousands of boxes with just a wave ofnher hand. The other girls had nothing on her. She made her waynthrough life, not on friendliness and kindness, but by earning ancircle of backstabbing friends through her wealth. They followed hernendlessly, wanting to be her, wanting everythingnshe had, and so they put up with her cruelty. Not to mention, Robinnwas talented. She had always been the best at singing in her school,nwhich made others envy her even more, thus putting her higher up onnher pedestal of wealth and talent. So when she was accepted to thenmusic school, she found a new circle of friends who only put up withnher because she made herself popular with her riches and she couldnmake everyone afraid to even associate with a person who she saidnsomething mean about. The summer had gone perfectly, winning anscholarship at the end of the school year. She had the perfect, hotnboyfriend that so many other girls wanted. Her father threw her anparty for all of her friends, and she made a big deal of showing offnJay to all of her friends. So many girls wanted to be with him, andnhe was hers. Jay didn't know what she was really like, he only sawnher sweet side. For all he knew, she was talented, sweet, kind,nhappy, beautiful... basicallynperfect. She had spent the entirenschool year anticipating the next summer, just knowing that it wouldngo as perfectly as the last summer had. But the perfection was gone. Her perfect boyfriend was with someone else. Someone who actuallynwas beautiful, talented, and sweet without even trying or pretendingnto be. And suddenly, Robin didn't have all that she wanted anymore. She was humiliated that Jay was no longer with her after she hadnspent so much time bragging and showing him off like she would a carnthat her parents had bought her. Of course, right on her sixteenthnbirthday when she got her license. Something else to make her evennmore full of herself. Terri had everything that Robin had \"workednfor.\" In Robin's mind, she had worked for it. Truthfully,nthough, if Robin had really thought about it without focusing onnherself, she would realize that someone more deserving had takenneverything that she had that she didn't deserve out from under her. Everything that she had, everything that madenher so popular and everything that made everyone like her. Gone. And that made her furious with Terri, even though to anyone else,nTerri was sweet and harmless and would never purposely take anythingnfrom Robin. Above all else, Terri was likable. Other people wantednto be around with her just because she was Terri, not because she hadnmoney. And somewhere deep inside, Robin realized how disposableneverything she had was, and instead of blaming herself, she channelednher rage into going after Terri's boyfriend. Even the teacher whonused to think that Robin was his favorite now picked Terri instead! It wasn't fair! And she looked like a witch because she was justntrying to make things right. All during the schoolnyear, Robin let her rage boil inside as she thought about Terri. Andnshe made new friends who went with her to her school, and everythingnwas back to normal. Maybe she could just forget about Terri. Butnnooooo, there she was again. Again! And no, this time, Robin wouldnbe the one who won. Robin would have the last laugh. She would getnJensen, and she would get that record deal. Terri didn't deserventhem. Robin did. And she would do whatever it took to make sure shengot them. Whatever it took... After she talked to Jensennsome, Terri felt her tears subside, and she was able to fall into anpeaceful sleep. They only had awhile til they wentnback to class. The perfect time for her to nap, thought Terri as shenwent to sleep hoping he wouldn't mind if shentook a nap in his arms. She had no idea he would sit there and watchnover her as she slept thinking about her. She had never met anyonenthat was so kind hearted and caring as Jensen. He listened to all ofnher problems, fears, and worries, and nevernonce complained about it or called her a baby. Terri hated being sonsensitive all the time. Her emotions always gotnthe best of her, and crying around people always made hernuncomfortable unless it was family. But with Jensen, it wasndifferent. He cared about her in so many ways, it was hard for Terrinto explain. Terri never understood whynRobin hated her so much, or why she was jealous of her. It should benthe other way around. Terri was jealous overneverything Robin had. Coming from a rich family, always getting hernway and what she wanted. If Robin knew just hownjealous Terri was of her sometimes, it would surprise Robin herself.nTerri hoped that someday her and Robin could find ancommon ground and be able to get along and understand one anothernand not be Jealous of each other. And Just because Terri wasnsomewhat jealous of Robin, she never did treat the girl unfairly.nNever bullied her, Terri was only friendly towards Robin. Terri had a feeling that her and Robin would never be friendsnand the girl would always hate her.[Chapter 6] Robin sat in her room,nstill moping. She heard footsteps coming up the steps. Actually, itnsounded more like a running, angry kind of steps. Ugh, it wasnprobably Todd again. He'd had a crush on her since back when she andnJay were together. Even when it had seemed that all of her oldnfriends didn't like her anymore and that nothing would be the same,nnow that everyone liked Terri, Todd had still liked her. He reallynwasn't the annoying type of crush, but he was just so far beneathnher, she thought snootily. He was always so quiet, and no one hadnever really heard him sing. He mainly stayed buried in his guitar. No one really knew him - he seemed invisible. Ugh, so far below her,ngorgeous and rich. But Jensen on the other hand... He was... in herndorm? Uh oh. And he lookednangry. She should have known he would catch up to her sooner ornlater. She wondered what had taken him so long to get to her dorm. Probably Terri, she thought bitterly. She had helped bring Terri andnJensen yet closer together. That was just wonderful, the icing onnthe cake. Ugh. Robin just stared at Jensen, feeling a bolt of fearnand shame rush throughout her. Shame? No, not shame. Only shamenthat she hadn't gotten to Terri when Jensen wasn't there. Then shenwouldn't be able to go for that record deal for sure. But no, Jensennalways had to be there in the nick of time. And as she felt thatnfear course throughout her, Robin also felt a bolt of love. Jensennlooked so hot even when he was angry. So unfortunate that he had tonbe angry at her, though. Well, she could change that. Maybe shencould get him mad at Terri soon enough. It could definitely work. Everything felt frozen. Robin's emotions kept coursing throughout her. His face was one ofndisgust and disappointment. She hated to see those emotions directednat her. \"Do you have thenslightest idea what Terri's going through?\" Jensen couldn't even saynanything else. He couldn't believe that this girl was looking at himncoldly right in the eye, over-confident as though she had donenabsolutely nothing wrong. Robin didn't answer. Shenjust stared calmly back at him, though her head was screaming at hernto say something. For the first time in her life, she was trulynintimidated and afraid. Completely speechless. And it was evennworse, because she really liked Jensen. Jensen resisted the urgento rant about all that was going on in Terri's life. He couldn't donthat to her, and it would only give Robin more fuel. \"Don't bothernanswering,\" he said, the sarcasm that he usually held backnalways dripping though when he was angry. \"I have no reason tontell you about what's going on in her life, but I can assure you thatnit's a really hard time. The last thing she needs is someone likenyou falling her around throwing her down staircases because you'renjealous of her.\" Jensen felt a littlenguilty. Yelling wasn't in his nature, and he usually talked thingsnout with even the most difficult of students. But Robin didn't evennseem to care, she still looked cool as a cucumber. Like nothing wasneven wrong, like she felt no remorse, like she didn't do anything! And the fact that she had done something to Terri, of all people,nmade him even angrier. \"Jealous?\" Robin scoffed. \"Oh, of course.\" She waved her arms in anmocking, rather graceful manner, emulating Terri. \"Of littlenmiss perfect. Of the boyfriend and friendship stealer. Of the girlnwho took everything I have away from me. The girl who came from dirtnin some cutesy little town you only hear about in fairy tales, andnher brother's tragic death and how she made her way to the top. Well, Jay isn't here with her now.\" Robin smiled. \"Looksnlike I won after all.\" \"Won? What is thisnabout, winning to you? Hurting people, lying to them? It seems youndo know some of what Terri's going through. How can you be glad? She deserved everything good that has happened to her, and deservesnso much more that no one could ever give to her. And you have tontake away even her most brief moments of happiness and make her lifenmiserable. I really can't deal with you right now.\" He wantednto add that she made her sick, but he couldn't find it in his heartnto say it, it sounded too cruel. \"Terri's life is sonfar from perfect. I don't want to pry into your life or into hers,nand I don't want to be judging either of you and making assumptions. But I saw what you did, and that's grounds for some type ofnpunishment, I'm sure. You did push her down the stairs, and I'm morenthan willing to testify to that.\" He grabbed her arm, thoughntaking care not to hurt her, and pulled her to walk beside him. \"We're going to talk to the administration to see what they havento say about what should happen to you.\" Terri woke up an hournlater and found herself back in her dorm room. Jensen must havencarried her in here when she fell asleep, Terri thoughtnand glanced at the clock. It read 3:00 Class would begin in thirtynminutes whether she was there or not. Terrinfrantically searched for something better to wear. She chose a whitenshort sleeved blouse, a pair of jeans, and shenmade her hair wavy by adding mousse to her wet hair and then blowndrying it. Terri put on very little makeup notnto look over done, and smiled. Jensen made her feel so much betternafter talking to her. She wondered where he wentnafter he put her back into her dorm. Denise came in shortly tongrab some bottled water from their fridge and saw Terri in front ofnthe mirror. \"Terri, I heard whatnRobin did to you and how Jensen saved your life. Are you okay?\"nher friend was concerned. Terri nodded \"I'll benfine\". \"I just can't believenwhat she did to you Terri! It was so terrible of Robin to do that donyou! Aren't you going to report her to thenDean?\" asked Denise. Terri shrugged. \"Whynshould I Denise? No one is going to believe me. The only witness Inhad to Robin pushing me down the stairs wasnJensen. Besides, it could just make the situation even worse\". Denise \"Well maybenJensen will drag her trampy legs to the Dean's door himself. You andnhim did talk didn't you?\" Terri nodded \"He didnsay he would corner her in the dorms. I wonder if he's doing thatnnow.\" Denise \"Guess you'llnfind that out soon enough. Let's go to class. We get to find outnwhich Solos we can sing today.\" Terri looked hopeful. Shenhoped Jensen picked some good songs for her to sing this year at thencompetition. It would get interesting today asnthey would practice her music together afterwards. They got into thenclassroom and went to their seats. Jensen was gathering the musicninto separate folders just as class ended. Terri didn't seenRobin around, and she wondered if she got into some sort of troublenwith the Dean. Not that Terri cared of course. Shendidn't need to put up with Robin the rest of the day, she just wantednto focus on music. Jensen handed out thenfolders with each student's name on top shortly after greeting thenclass. Inside of Terri's folder was the songs shenwould sing. She was one of Jensen's soloists. She looked into her foldernshe got to sing this year: How Do I live, and Fly. Fly she had nevernheard of before because it was a fairly new songnthat had never been recorded. HOw do I live on the other hand, wasnone of Terri's favorite pop songs. She could personalynrelate to the song as well. She smiled happy about the songs thatnwere chosen. It would be interesting to performnthem. They listened to as Jensen talked about the music in theirnfolders. \"And our last twonsongs will be \"How Do I Live\" and \"Fly,\" Jensennsaid. \"With Miss Fletcher as our soloist. All soloists for allnof the other songs have been chosen based on not only talent, but onnhow well you work with others and can act as a role model,\" hensaid, with a pointed look at Robin. She already didn't look toonhappy. She didn't have any of the solos, not because of a lack ofntalent, but because of the way she worked with others. Also, she hadncome into class late from being at the administration office, and henguessed that she had been punished somehow. Jensen had the fleetingnthought that turning Robin in would only make things worse for her,nbut he couldn't think about that now. Plus, he would try to be therento protect Terri. If Robin had a crush on him, she might want to trynto impress him, so maybe that would work to his advantage and makenher more well-behaved. He couldn't stand dealing with her flirting,nbut at least it might have some advantage. Or so he hoped. Robin looked at himnbitterly, raising her hand. \"I don't see how behavior is sonimportant, Mr. Ackles. I mean, we're looking for the best person tonsing the song. We want the music to sound as good as it possiblyncan. And if that means switching things around,\" she glared atnTerri, \"then maybe everything will work out for the best. Thenaudience has no clue what the soloist is like as a person, anyway.\" And in spite of the way her mind protested, she added, \"Andnmaybe people aren't what you make them out to be at first. Maybenpeople shouldn't be judged just because you only saw one side of thenstory and didn't listen to what each person had to say. And maybenyou can't get to know everyone after such a short period of time.\" An awkwardness spreadnthroughout the class as Jensen stood stunned for a moment, trying tonfigure out how to hint back at Robin without revealing what she hadndone and without making himself look like a fool in front of hisnwhole class. \"Well, Robin, that'sna good question,\" he said through gritted teeth. \"A solonis a privilege and something that needs to be earned. The soloistndoesn't just perform and sing. A soloist stands for the whole groupnand what kind of image we want to project. We want to projectnmaturity and kindness as well as talent. We need a soloist with allnthose values and who isn't afraid to stand up for them. If a soloistnwho is disrespectful is chosen, they might start to have a big headnand brag to others, making them feel badly. They don't reallynrepresent the group, and they might not show up on time for thenrehearsals or not give it their best shot because they're so stuck upnin their own talent. However, I assure you that values weren't thenonly thing I looked for. I looked for talented people whose voicesnand musical interests fit the songs that we need soloists for. Inhave heard each of you sing, and I have also had the opportunity tonchat with many of you, who are a delightful and very brightngroup of people that I'm incredibly honored to teach. However, ifnsomeone came across as rude, and I assure you that I would have madenit obvious to you if you did, then they were not chosen for the solosnbecause of the way they act, and they have only themselves to blame.\" Terri and Denise listenednas both Robin and Jensen talked back and forth and both could sensentension building between the two. Terri looked atnthem both as they talked wondering what had went on while she hadnbeen sleeping. She figured that Jensen would open upnlater about it after class, but she had a feeling Robin had gottenninto some kind of trouble with the Dean because shenarrived late to class. And she didn't get a solo. Which shockednTerri. Usually Robin always got a solo. Even if shendidn't deserve it. Terri guessed that Jensenndidn't give her any solos because of her behavior and that he hadnwitnessed the scene earlier. Terri also figured thatnJensen probably reported her and that explained the reason why Robinnlooked so angry. The way Robin complainednand talked about the soloist, made Terri wonder was Robin jealous ofnher getting the solos, and was she trying to formnsome evil plan to get Terri into trouble, or to make her get out ofnthe competition? Terri hoped not. She had worked hardnto earn these solos, and most importantly, she earned them. Terrinthought nothing was wrong with her personality. Shenhadn't showed any rudeness. But she had a feeling Robin was cookingnup something nasty, and she could tell it wasngoing to be a bumpy ride and not easy being in a competition. Robinnwas bound to do more evil deeds now that she hadnbeen punished. \"Don't look now, butnit looks like Mr Ackle's is going to have smoke coming out of hisnears\", Denise said grinning. Terri grinned but lookednat Jensen concerned.He looked like he was about to hit the roof atnany moment or start to yell at Robin both. But goodnthing soon after he got through talking, the bell rang. Terri sighednglad the tension was over at least for now. Terri walked over to himnand sat on a stool next to him \"How'd did everything go?\"nshe asked. The anger he had for Robin now dissapeared once Terrinwalked closer to him.[Chapter 7] Jensen shook his head inndisgust. \"That girl is impossible. I have never dealt with anstudent like her in my life. Never someone so arrogant. Usuallynkids see something wrong with their actions, but they go againstntheir consciences to do it anyways when they do something wrong. Andnto avoid punishment, they start apologizing, not just to get out ofnit, but because they know deep in their heart that it was wrong, nonmatter what benefits came from it. And many times, I listen to themnand believe them. But Robin, she acts like she's never done anythingnwrong in her entire life! She's just so selfish that it amazes me. All she cares about is herself, what she wants, and how to get whatnshe wants. She wants that record deal, she wants me for some reasonnI have no clue about, and she wants those solos. She doesn't justnwant them, she believes that she deserves them, that they'renrightfully hers just because she's, from what I can tell, rich, andntalented. Whoever she steps on to get thosenthings doesn't matter. She considers them insignificant people whonare just in her way. It's so frustrating to deal with someone likenher. It's like she devised her own twisted way of having anconscience.\" \"So I eventually justngot sick of trying to reason things with her and I sent her to thenDeans to have them deal with her. They actually stopped givingndetentions and instead have the kids do some volunteer work aroundncampus for their punishments. It's definitely more productive thannsitting at a desk doing nothing, it keeps the kids out of trouble,nand it's more effective in preventing them from getting in troublenagain if they know they'll have to work. So Robin will probably bengardening and picking up trash around campus for a week.\" \"The problem is,nRobin would have been still going after you anyway whether she wasnpunished or not, but she might be worse now. I just don't know. Andnshe's going to be angry about those solos. I can't stand givingnpeople things they don't deserve, though. She deserves a solo basednonly on talent, and after that speech in front of the class, I don'tnsee how I could just give her a solo. If I give her one, she mightnbe less angry at you and less jealous. I did keep one more solo tonhand out just in case, but I just don't know. Logically, it wouldnbenefit you because she wouldn't be so angry at you. And, if I wasnbasing things on talent alone, she is one of the most talentednstudents in the room, and it would be fair to give it to her. Butnthat's not what I want to go by, I want to judge people by theirncharacter. And giving her a solo would be like giving in to hernagain just because she's talented. And the other students wouldnprobably think that something's up. So what do you think? Should she get a solo so she'll be less jealous and angry?\" Terri sat down next tonJensen. She hated that he had been put in this awkward positionnbetween her and Robin. It was Robin's own problem shendidn't get any solo this year and she should tough it out. But Jensennwas right, if they didn't give her that solo, thingsnmight get much worse for her. Terri sighed thinkingnabout what she had to say to Jensen. \"I agree with you that younshould give out solos based on someone's character. Inthink personally to me, Robin will be punished enough by having tonpick up trash. The girl hardly used to clean upnaround at home and always had someone to do it for her. I do howevernthink it is best to go ahead and give her the solo.nBecause it just might make her back off some and less jealous of me.nPlus, we don't want her to go to her dad andncomplain about you not giving her that solo\". Terri felt that maybe ifnshe helped Robin get that solo and a chance to perform on stage itnwould give Robin a chance to see what she was like innperson and that she shouldn't be jealous of her. Terri hoped thatnthe solo given to her would change things around fornthem and if they couldn't be friends that they could at least be atnpeace and be able to work together. \"And youncould tell Robin that I told you that she could have at least onensolo if it would make peace between us a lot easier\".nTerri hoped Jensen would understand her wanting him to give Robin thensolo. She wanted Robin to back off of her and have peacenbetween them. Jensen nodded. \"Yeah,nI guess I'll have to give her that solo. I just hope that the othernkids don't start gossiping about the reason she was given a solo. They'll probably figure that her speech had something to do with it. It'll look suspicious if I just give her a solo randomly after theynwere all handed out.\" \"Also, the problem isnthat I don't think we can tell Robin that she's being given a solo sonthat you guys can make peace with each other. I think she'd want tonget one on her own terms, and if she knew that she's only getting onenbasically so she'll leave you alone, even though she is veryntalented, she would just lash out at you in jealousy. She's probablynrather not be given one out of pity, she seems too stubborn andnindependent for her own good, you know?\" Terri nodded. \"So I need to come upnwith some kind of fair way to give out the solo in the next song. Atnleast, a way that will seem fair, but will really be catered to Robinnso that she'll definitely be the person to get it. So here's whatnI'm thinking. First of all, I already told the class that they hadnreceived all of the songs that they were going to be getting. SonI'll now have to tell them that, since they're handling the music sonwell, I decided we're going to do another song. I can actually use ancouple of different soloists for it so it won't look suspicious. IfnI held auditions right in class, that could be a problem because,neven though I'm pretty sure that Robin sings well enough to outsingnthe other people who will want the solo, I haven't been teaching thisnclass very long and I'm not certain. So I'm going to have to havenauditions with just me and the student after class.\" \"I just really hatento give Robin a solo, because I feel so wrong giving in to her. Ifnshe hadn't had to be so bold and make that speech in front of thenwhole class, this would be a lot easier. But now she's probablyngoing to know that this is some form of me giving into her demands. Either that, or she'll think I'm doing it because I have a crush onnher or something. And I hope there's not someone who sings betternthan she does when I hold those auditions, because either way, I'mngoing to have to give the solo to her. I have already given a solonto everyone I felt who deserved one, and Robin was good enough to winnthat scholarship at the end of her first year, so I think everythingnshould work out alright.\" Terri nodded againnlistening to what Jensen had to say. \"I understand and all ofnthat sounds good to me\". She was glad that Jensen was wise enough tonthink things through before he did things. After talking some, Terrinand Jensen focused on her music that afternoon.nTerri practiced \"Fly\", since it was the hardest song tonsing and there were places where her voice had to get high. Jensenngave her advice on how she should let her voice come out more andnTerri listened. Terri practiced singing anfew lines of the song with Jensen beside her. In a moment, everythingncan change feel the wind on yournshoulder for a minute, all thenworld can wait, let go of your yesterday; can you hear it calling,ncan you feel it in your soul can you trust thisnlonging, and take control? Fly open up a part of younthat wants to hideaway you can shine, forgetnabout your reasons and start to try, cause it's your time, timento fly. Terri finished unsure ofnhow she sounded on the song, she knew she had a few promblems in thensong, and her singing voice had some troublengetting out there and louder. She looked up as Jensen walked over,nwanting to help her get her voice out. She waited for him tonspeak up. \"So when you'rensinging 'Can you hear it calling' and all the words after that untilnyou get into the chorus, try to let the song build up a little more. Leave the audience hanging on your words, let them know that it'snleading up to something and make them excited to see what's going toncome next, then really break the tension and bring the chorus out. We're going to work on projection with you, because that's what thisnsong takes. Remember, you're really trying to get your audience tonfeel the longing and the calling that the song talks about. It'snabout trusting yourself to go after what you wish for. It's almost andesperation, and that's how you build it up more. But don't take itnall the way when you're leading up to it, let them anticipate it. And then, really let loose during the chorus. That's the partneveryone's been waiting for, that's the part when you're flying. Younbreak away from it all, and are really able to trust yourself and thenlonging to shine, and it's really a strongnmoment, a metamorphosis. Your job as the soloist is to bring thatnout. Go ahead, try it again. And remember to open your mouth anlittle wider and really support those notes to bring them out.\" Terri tried it again,nfollowing his advice, and Jensen was amazed by the almost immediatenimprovement in the song. For many students, it took a while to fullynunderstand what he was talking about, and even more time until theyncould apply it to their music. But she caught on quickly, and he wasnglad. She finished, looking atnhim expectantly, and Jensen couldn't help but hug her. \"Yes! That was it, that was what I was looking for!\" He pulled back,ntickling her briefly in joy. \"I could really feel that momentnwhere everything just came together and you sang about flying. Thatnwas so much better, Terri.\" Terri smiled brightly gladnshe could please Jensen with her ability to learn the song rathernquickly. It ran in her family to learn things quicknwhether it was School work, or music in general. And she was pleasednshe caught on the song quickly to. She just had tonremember his advice when practicing and when she did it for real innfront of the whole audience. Terri was surprised whennhe suddenly hugged her close to him, and the butterflys returned oncenagain to her stomach making her excited and happy. Shensmiled again as he hugged her and she hugged him back. She startedngiggling when he tickled her obviously lightly flirtingnwith her. No one could ever make hernsmile and feel good about herself the way that Jensen could. When shencried, he held her and listened to her fears, andnher problems. And he was there for moral support as a friend, notnjust her music teacher. He made her feel better in anway that Jay nor her parent's could. Jensen put a smile on her facenjust by being friendly to her and offeringnadvice. He wasn't the Teacher she had before last year. But he was anlot better someone she felt she could personallynrelate to on so many levels. She was thankful for his friendship andnnow she didn't feel so alone at her school. Terri kept smiling \"I'mnglad you like it, and I was pleased I caught on so quickly to\".nshe said. As she looked at him Terri checked out hisnphysical features more. He was about 6 ft, definitely taller than shenwas. Terri was only about maybe 5'3\" tall atnthe most, and her brother used to tease her about being so short.nJensen also had the prettiest eyes ever. They were green andnit always looked as if he was staring longly into her soul whenevernhe talked to her. He had what looked like anfarmer's tan from playing outdoors when he used to play football. Henhad some muscles in his arms and seemed to be well fit for a youngnteacher. Jensen liked to wear colorful plain short sleeved t-shirtsnand Jeans. Today he wore a green shirt, thatnbrought out his eyes.[Chapter 8] As Terri paused to look atnJensen, Jensen didn't notice because he was also taking a pause tonlook at her more closely. Her hair was the prettyncolor of blond. Not the super-light kind that looked obviously dyednand fake; and looked bad on most people unless they had exactly thenright color of skin. No, Terri's was a golden blonde. She hadnlighter blonde highlights as well as darker ones that were scatterednthroughout. Her hair shimmered as though it were in sunlight, evennthough it was only under the room's florescent lighting. He couldnmake out different colors in it. Her bangs were swept to the sidenand gently blended into her hair, which was curled slightly to createna look that was very natural yet still gorgeous. Though she wasnrelatively thin, she looked healthy. Unlike other girls, she didn'tndrench herself in makeup. After all, she didn't need to. Well,nreally, no one absolutely needed to, but... you get the picture. Hernskin seemed to glow with a healthy radiance. Her skin looked likenthat of a porcelain doll, but unlike the doll, hers had life in it. Terri really had a natural presence that drewnpeople to her because she was so down to earth yet full of life andnjoy. It was heartwarming to see, because a person like that was sonrare. Her eyes were a hazel color and were framed by long eyelashesnthat accented them beautifully. She had a light, shimmery pink andnpurple eyeshadow on that matched with her outfit, and her lips werenshining with a glimmery pink gloss. She really did have a naturalnbeauty about her that wasn't forced. Instead of makeup being whatnmade her look so good, makeup accented what she already had. And she had such anremarkable talent and personality, too. And she was so strong afternall that had happened to her. He could just tell that she would gonfar. \"So, Terri, now thatnyou've had a chance to work on some of your songs, what, morenspecifically, would you like to accomplish this summer?\" Terri could feel herselfnblushing to the roots of her skin as Jensen kept checking her outnand, she could tell he liked what he saw as his green eyes took inneverything in before him. They were both extremely close now.nJensen still had her in a hugging embrace and was still pulled backnslightly as he talked to her. Their lips were close enough to kiss. But, Terri wouldn't dare make the first move. What if he didn'tnfeel the same? But, Terri did notice that he wanted to kiss her to.nOr was she just imagining things? Their eyes suddenly met and Terrincould feel that he was looking into her soul and studying everythingnabout her. Terri never thought thatnshe would ever have these strong feelings for another guy so soonnafter Jay broke things off with her. But here she was, falling hardnfor a School Teacher. It was normal to have a crush on a SchoolnTeacher right? Except what Terri was feeling, was much morenstronger feelings than just some crush. She felt those butterfliesnin her stomach return once again as she looked into Jensen's eyesnsuddenly realizing he was asking her a question. Terri snapped out of hernthoughts slightly shaking her head. Get a grip, Terri. You'll onlynget hurt again if you fall for him so soon.But, he's different fromnJay and other guys she argued back with herself. Terri wanted to kissnJensen so bad and wondered did he want the same? His eyes did stare closely at her lips and for a brief second, Terri thought they wouldnkiss right then. Oh he was driving her nuts! He was such a hottienand it was hard to believe they were friends. Terri struggled to findnwords. \"I, um, want to get better at my songwritting, andnplaying the piano. I used to take piano lessons when I lived atnhome, but it's been so long since I've taken Piano lessons. I'dnlike to be able to do all three this summer. Sing, write, and playnpiano and show other's I'm so much more than just a pretty face withnthe great voice\". Great, thought Terri blushing. Now he probablynthinks she's too full of herself. Stupid Terri! she quietly scoldednherself. She did hope Jensen knew what she meant. Not to mention she'd likento do some actiing later on thought Terri.l But her main focus wouldnalways be her music. She wanted to be multi-talented even though shenalready was.[Chapter 9] Jensen hadn't even thoughtnmuch about what would happen when he pulled away. When you hugnsomeone, there's a certain sense of intimacy and comfort. Butnthere's also the added message that you're not usually looking rightnat someone when you're hugging them, so it doesn't have that awkwardnfeeling that can sometimes happen right after a kiss where neithernperson really felt the spark that they thought they would. It wasnjust a hug that makes people feel good, you pull away, and thennresume talking. But unfortunately, Jensen didn't realize that henprobably should have pulled away completely when talking to Terri. Though she didn't seem uncomfortable, he had probably made her feelnthat way. He had only pulled away a little while still remaining innthe embrace so that he could talk to her while looking into her eyes. Looking into a person's eyes when communicating with them made it sonthat there was no misunderstanding. For example, he had to watchnwhat he said when he talked with people on theninternet because if he said something as a joke to tease them, theynmight take it seriously and their feelings might be hurt. Though itnhappened less often, the same could happen while talking, so he madensure to look people in the eye when speaking. And oh, for his sake, henwas glad that he kept Terri in his arms when he talked to her. Hernlips were so close to his that he could barely focus on what he wasnsaying. And he noticed that her arms didn't drop from around him,neither, so he couldn't have made her too uncomfortable if she keptnholding on to him anyways. He could see her blushing slightly and itnbrought a smile to his face that, for her sake, he tried to suppressnas he was talking. She looked so beautiful that he couldn't helpnlooking at her lips as he was speaking, if only for a moment. Hencould tell that she noticed, however, even though he tried to hidenit. Oh well. It wasn't exactly uncommon to look at someone'snlips... maybe. He was confusing himself, lost in all of hisnfeelings for her. He had been telling himself that she was just anstudent that he cared for deeply and really admired, but that didn'tnseem to be all that was behind it anymore. He pushed the thoughts tonthe back of his mind. He couldn't think about thosennow, but he did make a mental note to think about them later. Depending on what conclusion he came to, when their lips were sonclose together, he might make a bad decision if he realized how muchnmore his feelings just might be. Her lips were temping himnendlessly, so close to his, yet he couldn't reach out for them. Hencould have sworn he felt her moving the slightest bit closer, but hendismissed that as well, figuring it was probably just his wishfulnthinking. And then Terri had madenthe comment about not just being the pretty face with the greatnvoice. Coming from someone else, someone like Robin, he would haventhought that the person was arrogant or full of themselves. But notnwith Terri. He knew her well enough to know what she meant, and hencould see her blush slightly at the words that had come out of hernmouth, probably without much thinking. He was, if anything, gladnthat she was more confident in herself. Many people lost faith innthemselves after going through loss, and Terri had lost so manynpeople close to her in her life that he was glad that she could stillnbelieve in herself and her ability. He felt the slightest urge tontease her about her comment nonetheless, but he decided against it. She looked a little anxious after the words had fallen from hernmouth, and, as he had said before, words could easily benmisinterpreted. For all he knew, she might actually end up thinkingnthat he really thought of her as arrogant, so he decidednthat teasing her wasn't worth the possibility that something could gonwrong. So he just didn't really mention anything about her commentnat the end, and focused more on what she had said earlier. \"Sure, we can work onnall of those. I've never taken the piano much myself, but I amnfamiliar with some of what's involved, and I can always listen to younplay and offer suggestions. Depending on what you want, though, itnmight be in your best interests to find a teacher for the piano,ndepending on how far you want to go. As far as singing and writingngoes, I can definitely help you with both of those.\" Terri smiled brightly uponnhearing that he could help her with those also and was now glad more than ever that he wasnher new Music Teacher. Now maybe having a new Music Teacher wouldn't be so bad afternall. Thought Terri to herself. She noticed how Jensen didn't pull away as she inched closernto him and leaned a bit forward so they could kiss that is, if he wanted to. She probablynshouldn't be making this move but maybe he wouldn't mind it. \"Great. I looknforward into practicing more things with you then!\" Terri lovednhaving his arms wrapped around her inna loving embrace. She was glad to have found this friend in him that cared deeply fornher. Terri then found herself and Jensen slowly leaning forward to go in for that kiss.nJensen used one hand to cup her chin so he was looking into her eyes. Terri closed herneyes as their faces grew closer, closer, Jensen closed his to giving in and realizing henwanted to kiss her so bad to, and no one was in the room or so he thought. Robin had just come inntired and hungry for a snack when she returned from doing work around the school. Shencouldn't believe how much trouble she had gotten in with Jensen. Usually, she was a studentnthat teacher's loved. As she was going to go to the snack machines, Robin noticed anbulletin outside of Jensen's classroom. Auditions for a newnsoloist tomorrow afternoon. If interested for a solo, drop by and see me. Robin saw this as hernchance to ask Jensen for a solo. He just had to give her one! Robin had hated doingnyardwork outside and was all dirty. At home, she never had to garden or take care of the yard.nThey had servants that did all that. Oh if her Dad only knew of her punishment, he wouldnyell at Jensen. Maybe even visit the school himself. But Robin liked Jensen andndidn't want to put his job in jeopardy. So she decided to tough out and handle hernpunishment. And she would ask Jensen for that solo and another chance to prove she was wasnworthy in getting it. She walked into thenclassroom doorway and was shocked at what she saw. Robin stopped and stared. Terri and Jensennwere about to kiss and they were so close together and if Robin hadn't walked in thatnmoment, she didn't want to think about what would happen. Robin knocked on the doornsmiling. \"Am I interrupting something?!\" Terri immediately pullednaway in a big hurry. Her heart pounded like crazy because they had almost been caughtnkissing. She pulled away more moving herself from Jensen's arms even though she wanted tonstay there much longer. She saw that Jensen was surprised at Robin's sudden entrancento and was slightly annoyed at Robin. \"No, your not Robin.nMy meeting with Jensen has just ended.I'll see you tomorrow, Jensen\". Terri gathered her booksnup clumsily and flashed him a smile. \"Thanks for everything\".shensaid. Terri went back to herndorm not knowing that Denise would invite her to Karaoke night, and she would run into Jensen. Author's note: Thanks for the replies andnkeep sending them! We love good postive feedback!Also, Jay isn't going to make any specialnappearances in this story. The whole story is mostly about Terri adapting to thentough changes in her life, and I think with Paul's reappearance and Robin's bullying wouldngive her enough drama to worry about for awhile.![Chapter 10] Jensen felt himselfnfeeling an odd combination of being furious with Robin and also,nsomewhere deep in the back of his mind, being grateful to her. Mustnhave been his conscience, telling him that he shouldn't be with anstudent. And grateful that it was only Robin who had walked in onnhim. If someone else like his boss had walked in on them... itnwould have been bad. But he was only the teeniest bit grateful. Even though it wasn't Robin's fault that she had walked in on themnwhen he was sooo close to kissing Terri, he was still angry with her. It wasn't just the temptation of finally being able to kiss Terri. It wasn't just the fact that, after being teased with her lips sonclose to his for such a long period of time, that moment of a kissnwas ripped away from him. No, it was the feeling of awkwardness thatnwould surely come next time he saw Terri. If they had kissed, theyncould have had a moment afterwards to talk about it, and to sortnthrough their feelings together. A kiss wasnsomething that sometimes just happened as an impulse, and couldn't benstopped. But afterwards, things could be thought out logically. Andna kiss was the perfect time to find out if you really liked someone,nif that spark you were so sure of was really there, or if youndiscovered that you really just thought of the person as a friend andnhad gotten your feelings mixed up. He could have talked to her afternthe kiss though, and still remained close to her. But now he feltnthat he had violated the trust that she had for him. After all, shenwas vulnerable after the death of her brother and breakup with Jay,nand she needed someone to turn to. Maybe she was just confused andnhadn't wanted the kiss... Maybe he was being too pushy. But she hadnmade the first move, after all. But why? Did she really, truly,nhave feelings for him? And what about him, did he have feelings fornher? And now, next time he saw her, he would have to come up with anway to mention the kiss withoutnmaking her afraid of him, and if she did have feelings for him and henapologized for almost kissing her, she would think that he didn'tnlike her, which... he was beginning to realize that he did. His headnwas a mess of emotions. But he couldn't deal with them right now, henhad to focus on Robin, the last person he'd wanted to be dealingnwith. He hoped that she'd have something important to say, that shenhad to interrupt them. Robin was shocked beyondnbelief. What were Terri and Jensen doing? Was there somethingnbetween them? Had she brought them closer together? How long hadnthis been going on? Did Terri make the first move? It couldn't havenbeen... Jensen. But Jensen had looked like he wanted it, too. Shenjust didn't know. Jensen looked awfully flustered. And Robin wasnglad that she had walked in on them and stopped whatever was about tonhappen. She pushed her shock aside to deal with later, because thensilence in the room was getting more and more uncomfortable. She didn't say anythingnabout the kiss, and simply said, \"I'm sorry if I came at a badntime...\" and went on before he had a chance to say anything,nbecause she wasn't up to discussing it right then. \"I was just wonderingnabout the solo auditions outside. I know that I made a scene innfront of the class today, and I'm...\" She was full of pride. Pride made it hard to apologize and admit that she was in the wrong. But Robin wanted that solo, and she had to make Jensen believe thatnshe was willing to change. She wasn't willing to change, not truly,nbut she certainly had a shot at making Jensen think she was willingnto improve her behavior, if it was for the solo's sake. Little didnshe know that Jensen had already planned to give the solo to her. \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that, I should have spoken tonyou privately. And I couldn't have blamed you for giving me one, andnyou were right to judge the solos based on behavior.\" Shenwondered if he could tell that she was lying through her teeth. \"AndnI am willing to work on my behavior, and I'd really like a shot atnthe solo. It would mean a lot to me if you would give me anothernchance.\" The words were so hard to force out, and theynwere really a blow to her pride, but Robin managed them quite well. Jensen was skeptical, tonsay the least. He knew that Robin could never change so easily, andnhe could sense how hard the words were for her to get out of hernmouth. She was only trying to act better so she would get that solo. But if she tried to show him that she was acting better, that wouldnmean she needed to be nicer to Terri, at least when he was around. So maybe things would work out after all. \"Well... I supposenwe can give you another shot at it. But you need to work hard tonreally improve your behavior. If I don't see you acting better innclass tomorrow, you can forget about the audition. Meet me afternclass, and we'll have your audition then. Just sign up for a time onnthe sheet.\" Robin's face lit up, andnshe glowed. She was so tempted to hug him, but resisted. Henwouldn't have reacted too well. Instead, she held out a hand for himnto shake, which he took, and she thanked him again. \"Yournbehavioral improvement is all the thanks that I'll need,\" hensaid, giving her a glance that was slightly sympathetic andnunderstanding. After all, it must have been a blow to her pride tonsay all of that to him, whether she meant it or not. Terri couldn't believe at what her andnJensen almost did. Kiss. The way he looked into her eyes, Terri could tell that he wanted to kiss her. And he would have, if Robinnhadn't spoiled things. What was she thinking?! Terri went inside herndorm room she shared with Denise her roommate and best friend. Shencouldn't have these deep feelings for a School Teacher. It was wrong. They couldn't act on it. Or could they without anyone knowing? Terrinsnapped out of her thoughts as Denise came in and saw Terri sittingnon her bed looking a bit flushed in the face. Denise walked in, and found Terrinlooking flushed. The same look she used to have around Jay when theynwere in love. \"Uh, oh. I sense someone is in love. Who's thenlucky guy?\" Denise asked and flopped onto her bed. Terri looked at her best friend herneyes surprised at her own feelings. \"I think you already know,nDenise. It's Jensen, our new Music Teacher. We almost kissed today,nbut then Robin showed up\", Terri explained to Denise Jensen'snreaction to Terri's trying to kiss him. \"I could tell that henwanted to kiss me bad. But was hesitating at the same time. I feelnso stupid, Denise. I know I'm not supposed to kiss a Teacher onncampus, but, I hope this doesn't ruin mine and his friendship. OhnGod, what do I say the next tiem I see him? Sorry about the almostnkiss? It's gonna feel so awkward. Maybe I should avoid practice justnfor a few days and keep my distance and feelings from him\".nTerri hugged a nearby pillow for comfort. Denise looked at her friend. She hadnbeen in love twice before and she knew that it wasn't good to avoid the feelings that you had for a certain person. They would only eatnyou up inside. And make you miserable. \"I don't think it's angood idea to avoid practice Terri or him altogether. If you do, he'll wonder what's going on with you, and he'll probably beg you to come back to practice. I see how Jensen looks at you Terri. He'snin love with you to. You both need to admit your feelings and notnhide from them\". Terri knew that Denise was right.n\"But, we can't act on these feelings Denise. I can't tell him.nWhat if he rejects me? What if he doesn't feel the same? I can't putnhis job at risk, and I've been through so much loss already that Incan't handle rejection. I can't face him again at least for a fewndays Denise\". Terri suddenly now had tears in her eyes. And shenfelt so awkward. She grabbed a tissue and dabbed at her eyes. Denise looked at her friend who seemed to be in a complete mess and unsure about what she wanted to do withnher feelings she had for Jensen. \"Okay. You can do what younwant Terri. But, you can't avoid him forever. He'll know somethingsnup once he sees you not in class tomorrow. Tell you what will makenyou feel better. .. How bout you go out with us tonight Karaokingnme, Sloane, and Kiwi?\" Terri sniffed. \"That sounds funnbut, I'm dateless, and I don't feel like singing\". Denise still encouraged her to come.nShe had to get her out of that room. \"You need a night out,nTerri. You don't have to sing, you can just hang out with us. Andnbesides, your not the only one without a date. I'm not seeing anyonenright now, and it won't do you any good to sit here and cry allnnight\". Her friend had a point. While Terrincared deeply for Jensen, she just couldn't sit here all night. Shenneeded some fun. \"Okay, I'll go\", said Terri giving in tonthe invite. Denise smiled \"That's my girl.nNow, let's go through your closet and find a cute outfit for younto wear tonight.\" They both did just that while laughing andntalking some more.[Chapter 11] Jensen sat in his room,nfeeling uneasy. He had been so busy ever since he came to thenschool. He had been spending time helping students, practicing hisnown music, looking for things to get ready for class, and spendingntime with his colleagues and getting to know people. Plus, he needednto keep in touch with everyone back at home. He had been going outnmany nights as well, just to look around and check out the town. Butnnow, he had nothing to do. And this was just when he needed andistraction, too. His almost-kiss with Terri was pulling at thencorners of his mind, yearning to escape free and allow him to sort itnout. The problem was that he couldn't allow the thoughts of the kissnto escape because he didn't know how to sort through his feelingnabout them. For the first time in his life, with all of the peoplenskills and abilities to read people that he had, he was completelynclueless about a relationship with someone. He didn't know where tonbegin - He didn't know which part of himself tonuse to sort his feelings out - the calm, logical, Jensen, or thenemotional, impulsive Jensen? The teacher or himself? The one whoncould realize that he was starting to fall in love with Terri andncould decide to take the risks involved just because of his feelings,nor the one who knew that being with a student was wrong, and he couldnboth hurt Terri and lose his job. Was Terri worth the risk? And wasntaking the risk worth hurting Terri? It was like trying tonsolve a math problem without knowing the correct formula. He didn'tnknow which of his different sides of his personality to use to comenup with a way to decide what to do about Terri, even, so he couldn'tnthink about how he should go about approaching her. Jensen hopednthat Terri would be in class tomorrow. He couldn't stand the thoughtnof Terri sacrificing her future just because of the awkwardness thatnwould surely ensue after their almost-kiss. And he wanted to see hernagain, in his class. A thought at the back of his mind nagged at himnrelentlessly. The thought that, if he didn't solve this soon, itnwould just be pushed back and back behind him and Terri, and theynwould stop talking to each other because they were afraid of thenawkward moments that happened when they would be around each other. They might never end up even talking to each other again! Hencouldn't bear to leave Terri behind him for the rest of his life, notnwhen he felt that he had known her for hisnwhole life after just a few short days. He couldn't bear wonderingn\"what if?\" for the rest of his (potentially lonely) life,nmourning what could have been and wishing that he'd had the couragento suck it up and speak to Terri. Jensen's friend Aaron cameninto the room. \"Hey, a bunch of the teachers are going out fornsome food and karaoke this evening. Interested?\" As much as he had beennlonging for something to take his mind off of his problems withnTerri, Jensen was beginning to have second thoughts about going out. Maybe he just needed to eat, take a long bath, and fall asleep andnjust relax. But he didn't want to just ignore his friends, and henstill needed to make a good impression on the other teacher, so hendecided to go. Maybe he could occupy his mind with other things thannhis pressing thoughts of Terri. Jensen longed to tell hisnfriend about his feelings for Terri, but he had only just met him andnwasn't sure how he'd react if he found out that he had feelings fornone of his students. He didn't know him well enough yet and didn'tnwant people gossiping about him, which could lead to trouble for himnand Terri. So he held his feelings inside, wishing he had someone tontalk to. He'd have to call home later. \"Sure, that soundsnfun,\" was his only response to Aaron. Terri had finally decidednon an outfit to wear. It was a light Peach sundress and she wore hernfavorite cross necklace with it that was given to her thatnonce belonged to Paul. Her mother gave it to her shortly after Paulnpassed away and they were trying to get rid of somenof his things. Terri wished now more than ever that Paul was with hernso she could have someone to talk to. He had beennher best friend for years since they were little before she metnDenise. Paul would know what to do about being in love. But,nPaul wasn't no longer here, Terri reminded herself as she put on somenpeach shimmery lipgloss and some creamy eye shadownthat had glitter in it. Her hair was in waves again and she let itnhang loose. \"Wow, you look sonsexy in that sundress\", said Denise who was wearing a straplessnyellow dress that looked hot on her. Her black hair was curly and in a ponytail. \"Thanks. I just hopenI'm not overdoing it by outdressing others. If I am, I could changenit all and wear something else\", said Terri feeling unsure. \"No, No!\" saidnDenise suddenly. \"Don't change anything\". Deep down Denisenknew that if Terri wore that and if Jensen turned up there, henwouldn't be able to keep his eyes off her the entire night and wouldnrealize he was looking at a young woman and not a kidnand he would want to talk to her all night. The Club was crowded asnthey went in and met Sloane and Kiwi there who already had a table.nThe friends said hi to one another and exchanged hugsnand sat down to talk. Kiwi smiled at Terri asnthey talked. He had heard from Denise that Terri and Jay were nonlonger an item. He saw that Terri was different thisnyear and not as happy as she once was the year before. He just hoped a night out was just what she needed. The first act up onstagenwas a guy named Brian Logan. He was a local College student withnspiky red hair. He studied Law. And he couldn't sing as he triednto do a cover song done by Peter Cetera called \"Any fool cannsee\". is voice sounded like he was trying to sing through hisnnose. Terri and her friendsnlooked at each other and laughed.It was there way of relieving stressnbuilt up from the day and they didn't mean anynharm to the singer. It's just well the singer sounded horrible andnTerri wondered why did he go onstage when he absolutelynhad no talent? Everyone else began to laugh too. Jensen had been talkingnwith the other teachers for about an hour. As they began discussingnthe record deal, even the teachers couldn't help but speculate onnwhich student would win it. Jensen listened to the conversation forna while, trying to gauge the amount of talent that the other studentsnhad compared to Terri. He couldn't help himself. Even though hendidn't want to be overly jerky and competitive, because he had alwaysnhated the guys who were like that from when he was playing football,nhe was a bit competitive and naturally wanted to see what Terri wouldnbe up against. Maybe he could use this to figure out her strengthsnand weaknesses compared to some of the other students. As hencontinued listening, he realized that the conversation was beingndirected towards both himself and to Terri. \"What about thatnFletcher girl? Her teacher last year always mentioned how talentednshe was, and she really shone at her performance at the end of thenyear. Even though she didn't win, she really did stand out amongstnthe crowd, and to stand out with all of the great talent that we havenhere, that really says a lot. She has such a natural presence fornthe stage, and she brought a great deal of emotion to her songs. Oh,nJensen, isn't she in one of your classes?\" Jensen nodded. \"You'renvery right, she has a lot of talent. I've actually started workingnwith her after classes, because I really want to bring out her fullnpotential. I mean, she's gone so far on her own, but there's so muchninside her that she's capable of and hasn't brought out yet. I'mnhopping to unbottle as much of that as I can, so she'll really shinenduring those performances for the record deal. I'd hate to see hernlose without giving it her best shot and really using all of hernpotential to her advantage, so that's why I've been helping her withnher songs.\" \"Well, that's verynadmirable of you, Jensen,\" one of the teachers said, smiling atnhim. She had a pretty face, and appeared to be about Jensen's age. It was obvious that she was very sweet and friendly, but she wasn'tntrying to flirt with him or anything of the like. It was just in hernnature to be friendly. \"Oh, not really,\"nJensen said, trying to wave off the compliment. He hadn't meant tonsound like he was bragging. He just wanted to praise Terri and letnthe other teachers know that she had something special, not to callnattention to himself for the help that he was giving her. He alwaysnloved helping his students and was willing to give his time andnenergy to them, not for attention, but because he really loved to seenthem blossom and grow both as musicians and as people. He couldn'tnwait to see what would become of Terri. After a few songs fromnsome Karaoke rejects, Terri began to feel better that night realizingnthat going out was a good idea. But nothing wouldnhelp her from Kiwi's next comment. Kiwi turned to her \"So,nTerri, Denise tells me you wrote a new song\". Terri nodded. The othernnight, when she had thoughts full of Jensen she wrote Love Just Is,nbecause it was what she was feeling inside and shenfelt better once she got her feelings all written out. \"Yeah, it's justnanother one of my love songs I wrote\", she said drinking somencoke. Since Terri wasn't old enough to drink yet, she stuck withncoke like Denise did. Kiwi exchanged a look withnthe others \"Can we hear some of it, if you don't mind singing itntonight?\" he asked. Kiwi always loved to hear Terri sing, evernsince the competition last year. He thought she was great. Terri sighed. She hadn'tnplanned on singing a song tonight. Tonight, she was suppose to letnloose, have some fun being with her friends and thatnwas it. But they really wanted to hear her new song, and Terrincouldn't let her friends down. She sipped her coke somenmore \"Alright, I'll sing. But I hadn't planned on doing it, sonif I sound terrible\", Terri as she rambled on. Giving a warningnlook at Kiwi. Kiwi just laughed. \"Youncan never sound terrible, Terri\". Terri smiled back andnheaded towards the stage to be the next one to sing. The room wasndark, from the stage, she could only see the first twonrows. Terri could remember the last time she was here with Denise andnJay. She had freaked out not because she wasngetting stage fright that wasn't the issue like she thought it was.nIt was just that she kept seeing Paul spirit. NOw hisnspirit comforted her onstage knowing he was there. The last act finished andnnow it was Terri's turn. The club owner announced her name and thensong she was suppose to sing. When Terri walked onstage,nshe kept hearing from a few drunk men: \"Aw look there's thenchick that freaked out last year\".Both him and his buddies laughed. Terri ignored them. Shencouldn't let them ruin her evening. Slow, soft pop music blared fromnthe speakers and sounded great and the lights werenall on Terri. She began to speak.\"This song is about ansignificant other\". then she began to sing. When the night won't fallnand the sun won't rise And you see the best asnyou close your eyes when you reach the top asnyou bottom out but you understand whatnit's all about Nothing's ever what itnseems in your life or in yourndreams It don't make sense , whatncan you do? So I won't try makingnsense of you Love just is...whatever itnmay be Love just is...you and me Nothing less and nothingnmore I don't know what I lovenyou for...love just is As Terri sang, she glancednamongst the crowd and saw the surprised looks on the men before hernas well as other people. They seemed impressed bynher talent, and there was no booing like there normally was onnKaraoke night. Terri had no idea Jensen was there andnlistening. She also had no idea the other teachers were there to.nTerri walked about around the stage pouring emotion to thensong like she was telling them a story. A story about her.[Chapter 12] Jensen felt bad laughingnat some of the people who were singing. After all, some of them werenquite possibly drunk, and many of them were just up there for the funnand enjoyment of it. He always had an admiration for people whondidn't care what others thought of them. Though talented, he stillnhad his insecurities about himself, and there were things that henjust wasn't comfortable sharing with others. Still, as sorry as he feltnfor laughing at the singers, Jensen couldn't help himself. It wasnall in good fun, and no one looked hurt or embarrassed. They justnlaughed along with the crowd, and once again, he couldn't help butnadmire them. When it came down to it, it didn't matter how good theynsounded or whether they were hitting the right notes. They werensinging to enjoy themselves, and that's what they did. Jensen and his friendnEric, who was a fellow teacher, were just contemplating singing anduet together when a teacher he wasn't really familiar with tappednhim on the shoulder. \"Look up there, Inthink that's Terri,\" he whispered, pointing. Jensen's breath caught innhis throat. Terri glowed. No, not under the glare of the spotlight. she just, really and truly, glowed. He had always thought she wasnbeautiful, more and more as he let himself admit that he did find hernattractive, but that was nothing compared to what he was seeing now. Honestly, Terri would look good in a potato sack after spending anmonth in the jungle. But nothing could have prepared him for the waynshe looked, standing on the stage, totally oblivious to the fact thatnhe was in the audience. He could sense something magical about her,njust being there on the stage. She truly looked like she had beennborn on the stage, she looked so natural up there. Even though hencould tell that she looked a little uncomfortable, she just looked innplace. After all, she hadn't performed on stage very much, so it wasnnatural for her to be nervous. In fact, he would find it odd if shenwasn't nervous. And oh, she was beautiful. Her hair rivaled that ofnthe girls in shampoo commercials. It gleamed under the spotlight,nreflecting the vivid lights that surrounded her on the stage. Shenhad on a peach sundress that brought out her flawless skin perfectly,nand her lips looked so incredibly soft, seeming to still be teasingnhim with the near kiss that had happened only hours ago. And, while his heartnstopped in his chest at her beauty, it also stopped for anothernreason. He had no idea what to say to her. But he couldn't just sitnthere, with her so close to him, and not say anything. He didn'tnknow what to do, what to say, especially if she happened to noticenhim when she was singing the song. He needed to talk to her and seenhow she felt, and this night would be the perfect opportunity. Hensaw her friends sitting in their seats, cheering her on. He hopednthat, if he talked to Terri, he wouldn't ruin their moment ofnhappiness. Terri had such little happiness in her life lately, henwould hate to ruin it. But for now, he justnwatched her sing. \"This song is dedicated to a significantnother,\" he heard her say. A significant other? Who would thatnbe? Jay? No, it couldn't be, she wanted to forget about Jay. Shenwasn't dating anyone, was she? No, he felt sure that she would haventold him, and if she had a boyfriend, she would probably have gone tonhim for comfort instead of Jensen. But that still didn't answer thenquestion: who could the song be dedicated to? A thought spiralednpast him, but he let it sail past him. Then, he couldn't help butntug it back and ponder it. The song couldn't be dedicated to...nhimself, could it? After all, their near kiss had just happened andnshe was probably mixed up about her feelings. At least, he hoped shenwas. He hoped that the kiss carried as much emotion for her as itndid for him. He hoped that she was as confused, or as afraid, ornas... something as he was. His worst fear was that the near kissnthat meant so much to him, caused him so much emotion andnmixed-up feelings, would mean nothing to her. And then, as Jensen wasnlost in his thoughts, Terri began her song. After the amount of badnsingers, everyone in the crowd was grateful to hear someone with anbeautiful voice and actual talent. A silence seemed to fill thenroom. Well, it wasn't a complete silence. There was the usualnchatter, but the room seemed to have lost some of its chaos ofnfriends running about, some drunk, some laughing hysterically, somenwho probably hadn't seen each other in year. The room seemed morencalm, more peaceful. And as he listened to the lyrics of the song,nhe couldn't help but think that it was dedicated to him. When he wasnaround Terri, he noticed that she got this certain look in her eyesnthat she had no where else. And she had that look right now, and henfelt that she was looking directly at him, even though she couldn'tnbecause the room was too dark and the spotlight too bright for her toneven see him. And maybe it was better that way, because she probablynwould have been mortified if she knew thatnhe was watching her. Secretly, he thought, if the song was reallyndedicated to him, he felt a sense of excitement at the thought thatnshe had dedicated it to a significant other. That must mean thatnsomething more was between them... Wait, he couldn't be hoping fornthat. She was his student. That was all. But how much longer couldnhe keep telling himself that, and forcing himself to believe it? The emotion she conveyednin her song was breathtaking. The song spoke of... almost thenconfusion that was in love, how nothing made sense, how two differentnthings could be the same thing, how things aren't what they appear tonbe... Yet she sang it with so much ease, with such gentleness. Shenskimmed over the confusion, merely acknowledging that the confusionnwas there, but she didn't let the confusion in love get to her. Shenjust said that she knew it was there, but it didn't matter. Therenwas no point in trying to figure out all the confusion and differentnemotions in love, because love... just is. Love just is. It's justnthere, amongst all the confusion, which melts away to see that lovenis the only thing that really matters. The way she sang the songntruly reflected its meaning. And then he realized thatnthe song could apply to him and Terri. That the confusion was gone,nthat all that mattered was love. Could that be how she felt? Andnwhat was love, anyway? Was it even an emotion? Love lasts, emotionsnchange. But does love really last forever? Can it? How deep doesnlove go? And what exactly did he feel for Terri? It couldn't benlove, that was wrong, she was a student. But there was somethingnthere, something deeper than just caring for her as a student. Something... else. What was it? Could it be love, despite their agendifference, despite his status as her teacher? As Terri sang the song she still felt a bit uncomfortable onstage. Singing in a Club wasn'tnsomething that she was used to. But still, she thought, singingnsomewhere was better than not getting to sing anywhere at all. Ancomforting silence seem to fall in the room even thought Terri stillnheard people talking amongst themselves and moving about.The song shenwrote yesterday had turned out quiet nicely. To get the music for hernsong, she had a demo version that she thought was perfect for it onntape. And Denise and Sloane had done a great job of singing thenwonderful echoeing background vocals on the song. Both Girls hadnpretty voices even though they only considered themselves just asnmusicians and nothing else. Kiwi did a good job in finding the rightndemo for the song. She continued to sing for the crowd. When you ask to stay andnthen disapear. It seems your gone, butnyour're really here. When every move seems outnof Place But every kiss is fillednwith Grace. Some things never getndefined in your heart, or in yournmind it don't make sense, whatncan you do So I won't try makingnsense of you Terri sang the chorus andnsecretly wondered who all else was in the audience. Had she knownnJensen was there, was closeby, and watching every move she madenadmiring her beauty, Terri would have been more nervous since thensong was about her and Jensen. Even if Jensen heard the song; Whatnwould he do?Would he deny everything between them? Would he rejectnehr and say she was just some teen with a stupid crush on him?nBecause all these feelings Terri had in her felt so much more thannjust some crush. If Jensen denied not having feelings for her, Terrinwould be crushed. She wondered if he thought about her constantlynlike she did him. Love just is... whatevernit may be Love Just is... you andnme. Nothing less, and nothingnmore I don't know what I lovenyou for... Love just is Don't ever ask me fornreasons I can't get to you Don't ever ask me fornreasons Why I live for you... Injust do Nothin's ever what itnseems in your life or insidenyour dreams It don't make sense, whatncan you do? So I won't try makingnsense of you After finishing repeatingnthe chorus, Terri finished the song and everyone clapped and cheered.nTerri smiled appreciating the fact everyone liked the song. She wentnback to her friend's table. Still unaware that Jensen was in thenaudience with his friends. Kiwi gave her a high-five. \"That wasna great song Terri. Your songwritting keeps getting better. Denisenand Sloane, you sounded awesome on the background vocals\".hensaid. Both girls smiled even though Sloane turned beet red. Shenwasn't used to nice compliments. \"I didn't think thensong would turn out the way that it did\", said Terri gettingnherself another coke.\"Considering I only worked on it lastnnight. \"Your a songwritingnGenius Terri, You should branch out more into songwriting.\" saidnDenise. \"I'd like to worknmore on that this summer. Me and Jensen are going to work on that tonthis summer together as one of my goals\". said Terri. KiWi smiled. \"That'sngreat Terri. I also heard your going for that record deal. If you asknme, your giving Robin a run for her money\". Terri laughed. \"I'dnlike to win it KiWi. And I am good, but not as good or as pretty andnpopular as Robin.\".little did she know Jensen had approachednthem and had overheard everything being said, and was behind Terri. Jensen listened to thenrest of Terri's song, and it seemed as if he could have trulynwritten it himself. The way it connected with everything that he wasnfeeling, he could only hope that it was written for him and that shenfelt the same way he did. \"I don't know what I love you for…\"nand that was so true. He didn't know why he felt the way he didnabout Terri, he didn't know exactly what about her made his heartnpound and adrenaline rush through him. It could be her eyes, fillednwith a passion and emotion that he had seen no one else before. Itncould be her strength and determination, her happiness in the face ofnher difficulties, it could be her beauty, it could be her incrediblentalents, the way she poured her heart out to him, the way she trustednhim as no one ever had before. It was everything about her… Shenwas flawless, the epitome of perfection. \"I don't know what Inlove you for\" couldn't be more true. Wait, love? He paused forna moment, letting the word soak through him, absorb intonhis mind and, more importantly, his heart. And despite his mind'snprotestations, the way it pulled at him, telling him that she was anstudent, that it was wrong, the way his mind tried to jerk him awaynfrom her, full of logic and rationality, he let his heart guide him. He let his emotions wash over his whole body, his whole mind, like anfootprint of sand on the beach… that footprint has so much impact,njust as his mind did, but in a second, it would be gone, carried awaynby the wave, just as his emotion carried him away. Fully away, untilnhe could no longer hide from his feelings for her, he could only letnthem fill him completely. And as she finished the song, saying \"Lovenjust is,\" it was then that he knew. Love just was. He couldn'tnstop it, he couldn't fight it, he couldn't do anything about it. That was it. He loved her. He smiled to himself, so incredibly gladnto be rid of the rationality that held him back. He loved her, henrepeated to himself. It feltnwonderful just to be able to admit that. And as Terri went to sitndown, Jensen realized that he needed to take a chance. He had takenna chance by coming to the school, or even by going to the karaokenclub that night. And it had led him to Terri. Maybe fate led him tonTerri. Maybe if he hadn't been born in such a small town, henwouldn't have had any reason to leave it. And maybe if he hadn'tnleft it, he wouldn't have gone to teach at this school and henwouldn't have ever met Terri. And maybe fate drew him to thenkaraoke club for a reason to hear her sing, to have a chance to worknthings out. Everything, he felt, had to tie together somewhere. This might be where it all tied together, and everything thatnhappened was based on chances. Even if he didn't get to tell Terrinhe loved her, he needed to know what her feelings for him were. Henloved her, he thought to himself again. It seemed so refreshing andnunreal to be saying that. It felt wonderful... and as he imaginedntelling her that he loved her, and having her say it back, henfelt a surge of energy and excitement flow through him, trulynelectrifying, terrifying and thrilling at the same time. And thatnfeeling made him take the final few steps over to where Terri wasnsitting and tap her on the shoulder, hoping that she wouldn't pullnaway from him or be afraid. Terri turned aroundnhappily. Before she saw him, he caught a sight of the happiness onnher face. It was wonderful to see her happy, though he did seensomething more behind her eyes, that something was bothering her,nthat the song had stirred up a lot of emotion inside of her as shensang it. She turned around with a sort of ease, not expecting to seenhim standing behind her. And as she saw him, she froze. Literally,nit was like her face had just frozen in its tracks. Jensen smiled warmly atnher and held out a hand to help her out of her chair, pushing hisnnervousness and anxiousness away. He looked as though he felt anconfident sort of ease, even though that was the last thing he felt. He wasn't the best under pressure, but he certainly had a lot ofnexperience making himself look like he was. \"Hey,\" he wantednto say more, but glanced around at her friends. They actually allnseemed pretty much occupied and like they weren't paying muchnattention to what was going on between him and Terri, but he stillnlowered his voice to say, \"I wanted to talk to you aboutneverything. Everything that has happened today, before Robin walkednin on us, the way I felt when you sang that song, what you werenfeeling when you wrote it... Everything.\" He prayed that she'dntake his hand and let him lead her out to his car. Terri was shocked to seenJensen at the club to. He had heard the song! And now he wanted tontalk to her alone outside. Terri felt more nervous. Maybe shenshouldn't have sung the song, Especially if he figured out the songnwas about him or her. He probably wanted to lecture her outside aboutnhow it was wrong to love a Teacher. Her Teacher. Now she felt more afraidnthan ever to talk to him, to be alone with him. What if he rejectednher? he had every reason to. He was her Teacher, she was a Student.nAlso, there was a major age difference between the two. Wasn't there? So what could he possiblynbe wanting with her now? Maybe it was that he just wanted to talk,nthought Terri. If he did have feelings for her, Terri deserved tonknow now. She was shocked when he tapped her on the shoulder, andncaught her by surprise. She hadn't expected for him to be there. Jensen said \"Hey\", and had a warm smile on his face. He didn't seem mad or frustratednat her about singing the song. Then he said he wanted to talk aboutneverything that happened that day, before Robin intterupted them. Andnhe held his hand out to her. Don't freak out now, Thought Terri tonherself. She put the smile back on her face hoping it would hidenher emotions. \"Okay, Let's Talk\", she said and took hisnhand. She let him lead her out to his car. Jensen's heart beat in hisnchest despite the fact that he was relieved she had agreed to go withnhim. He felt himself leading her to his car. Oh yeah, that's great,nJensen, he thought to himself. Lead your student out to your car innthe middle of the night by herself. That's a good idea, he thoughtnsarcastically. Yet, as much as he tried to joke with himself, he wasndeeply touched that she trusted him enough to let him take hernwherever he was going to take her, to be with her alone, withoutnworrying about him hurting her. He could never ever do anything tonher that would cause her any harm. He couldn't bear it. The car ride was fillednwith silence. He wasn't going to lie, the silence felt slightlynuncomfortable, at least to him. From the way Terri was fidgeting,nplaying with the edges of her sundress and twirling her hair, shenmust have felt the same way. Nervous as she was, she still made hisnheart jump and his eyes light up, growing more beautiful each time hensaw her. Neither of them was eager to break the silence. They bothnwaited for the other two, but they were both very deep into their ownnthoughts. Jensen, wondering how on earth he could talk to Terrinabout his feelings without coming off as the creepy teacher who triesnto hit on his students, and Terri, probably wondering what Jensenncould possibly want with her. Jensen paused to thinknabout where he could take Terri. Then he remembered a place that henhad come across with some friends once. They were going on a picnicnand looking for a good spot, just happening to come across a gorgeousnlake. His friends loved it and swam in it, but they never reallynreturned to the area. Jensen had come there one night, a night whennhe was filled with confusion and self-doubt, a night when he hadnwondered whether he really belonged at the school, with so muchntalent, a night when he wondered whether music was truly what henloved. And the conclusions he reached were really a turning point innhis life. And he knew that this night would be a turning point innhis lift, too, for better or for worse, whatever happened. And asnmuch as it frightened him, it also excited him. It was like waitingnanxiously for a test - you try not to get your hopes up because younmight not have done well and you don't want to disappoint yourself bynthinking you did well when you didn't, butnyou also couldn't help but entertain the fleeting thought that maybe,njust maybe, you did do well, even though you suppressed the ideanbefore you could allow yourself to enjoy it. Yes, that wasndefinitely the way he felt about this night. He parked the car, and henopened Terri's door for her to help her out of the car. He led herndown the path in the forest. It was peaceful, quiet. The trees werenon both sides of them, leaving just a narrow path and he took hernhand to guide her through some of the more dense areas. It wasnalmost eerie, but in a tantalizingly gorgeous way. The moonlightnshone through the trees where it could, and Terri's face was lit upnby the beams of light that had fought their way past the branches andnleaves. Her gasp when she saw the lake made everything he had beennthrough to get there worth it. The lake was morenbeautiful than he had remembered. Its waters were so clear and sonpure that you could drink from it with no worries of disease. Therenwas a full moon out tonight, casting just the perfect amount of lightnto illuminate their little oasis of calm, open waters in the midst ofnthe tangled branches that was the forest. He was filled with a deepnsense of peace and connection with the nature surrounding him. Crickets gently chirping welcomed them, beckoning them into theirnmidst. Jensen led Terri to sitndown on a log with him, placing his jacket on top of the log first sonshe wouldn't get her dress dirty. \"Terri...\" henlooked into her eyes, searching her for emotion. \"First of all,nyour song tonight was beautiful.\" She blushed, smiling shylynand turning her head away. He gently tilted her face back to look upnat him. \"And... it made me realize something. Love isn'tnsomething that you can think about rationally. It's not somethingnyou can understand by reading about it in a book, it's not somethingnthat you can make your brain understand. You can't make a list ofnthe reasons you like someone, and then decide if there's enough therento make you love someone. You can't think about what you dislikenabout someone, and then just not love them anymore. It doesn't worknthat way. Love's just something you know, something you feel in yournheart, not in your head. You can't even know why you love someone...nit's just there, within you, filling you with the most incrediblenfeeling you've ever experienced. It just is. And from the second Insaw you, my heart and my head have been going back and forth,nmy head telling me that it's wrong, but my heart telling me that agesndon't matter, that positions and rationally thinking things throughncan't change the way I feel about someone. My heart telling me thatnI have to let go of my mind and just follow my emotions. My emotionsnfor you. And I've been battling with that for so long, and I justncan't keep my emotions in check any more. I have to let them loose. And tonight when you sang that song, you were so right. Love justnis. You can't fight it, you can't make it go away no matter how hardnyou try. And I can't go the rest of my life without telling younthis, because, even though it's hard and it may change everythingnbetween us, I can't not say it. Terri... I love you.\" Terri couldn't believe it.nJensen was in love with her and was telling her now! Her heartnpounded wildly with excitement, she was so glad he felt the same waynabout her. She had been so afraid that she wouldn't return hernfeelings. And now here he was, pouring his heart out to her. The Forest they went tonwasn't too far from the City of Los Angeles. It almost felt Junglenlike, And it was so beautiful, and breathtaking! She heard crickets,nbirds chirping almost welcoming them. And there was the Lake. Itngleamed during the moonlight and had sparkles to it. It was so clearnto. It would make a beautifulnpostcard thought Terri. She would have to take a picture sometime so she could show mom and Aunt Nina it. It was now back to Jensennas he tilted her chin with his fingers gently once again so she couldnlook at him as they talked. Every word he said, Terri took it allnin. Then he said I love you, Terri. Then looked at her with hisngreen eyes. His deep voice gave her the chills, but, in a good way,nthought Terri as she gazed into his eyes. She struggled to findnwords. Terri looked up at him in the eyes. \"I love you to,nJensen. I have since the first moment I saw you. The song I sangntonight, it was how I felt about you and me. I couldn't sleep verynwell the other night because I kept thinking about you constantly,nand I worried that you might not feel the same way, so around 2:00nam, I wrote that song. It just felt so good to have thoughts onnpaper to express how I feel. I kept trying to Deny what I felt; keptntelling myself it was wrong to get involved with a Teacher. I evennthought I was just having some crush on you. But, then I listenednto my heart, and I knew then that I loved you. And that mynfeelings for you ran deeper than just some school girl crush. Younare so much more to me than just a Teacher. And I just want to say Inlove you to\". Terri said and looked into his eyes. She felt thenbutterflies return to her stomach once again.[Chapter 13] The moonlight surrounded them, almost casting a glowing spotlight. Their reflection shone in the lake. It seemed to be leaving their imprint on the water, a memory of that fateful night when... even though they didn't know it, they could sense it - the night when their lives would change forever. All who visited that special place in the woods knew of its magic and felt a certain connection to it. It was a place where lives were changed, were different paths were taken, different doors were opened. And that moment would forever be remembered by the lake's waters, carefully stowed away with all of the other moments that others had experienced in that same place. Maybe it was the magical memories that kept the lake alive and continued to pass its presence on to the rest of its visitors. But it shone with an enchanted light, almost as if something deep within it was glowing. The moon seemed brighter, the winds seemed to calm and stop the grasses from blowing, the trees took on a gentle instead of formidable look, and a sudden feeling of peace swept over the forest. But none of that mattered to Jensen, not even noticing it. He was finally with Terri, and the joy of being able to finally hold her without worrying about overstepping bounds, of being able to kiss her without restraint, completely overtook him, made him breathless and barely able to support Terri's weight as she leaned against him, so lightheaded by their kiss. And little did Jensen and Terri know, as they were enjoying the perfect moment where they were only the two that mattered, Robin stood close by, hidden from moonbeams in the shadows of a tree, watching with the same cold-hearted look Jensen always noticed in her. But if you glanced further into Robin, beyond the forest's mist... you could make out the tears in her eyes. They didn't get back to the Dorms until close to 1:00 that morning. Jensen kissed her goodnight by dropping her off at her room, they exchanged numbers and online screen names. Turns out, Jensen had a yahoo id like she did so they would still be able to communicate tonight if they wanted to. The two said goodnight, and Terri walked back into her and Denise's dorm room. Terri had Jensen and they finally were an item! She was so excited. Tomorrow, she would get to talk to Mom, Dad and Aunt Nina. They always called the day before 4th of July, inviting her to spend it with them. This time Terri wanted invite Denise and Jensen. But first, she would go on computer to see if Jensen logged on. When they were in the Forest, they hadn't noticed that Robin had seen their whole kissing scene. If Terri did see her, she would be mortified. Terri logged on careful not to wake Denise who laid sleeping nearby. She turned the sound down, and looked to see who was on yahoo tonight. Jensen was finally on! Terri grinned and wondered if he would im her. Suddenly, a pm message from nowhere popped onto her screen. The id read: Paul1979 and then the person said:Terri,is that you? Terri's heart suddenly felt like it stopped. No, it couldn't be her brother could it? Paul was dead! AngelChick88: It's me, who is currently speaking? Paul1979: Paul Fletcher, it's me, your brother. AngelChick88: Is this some sick joke? Because if it is, I'm not laughing.My brother died in a car wreck a year ago. Paul1979: You thought he died. You didn't see an open casket at the funeral did you? Terri's breath caught in her throat. No they didn't see an open casket at Paul's funeral. Supposedly, his body was in such bad shape, they couldn't bare to see him like he was. AngelChick88: No. There was no open casket. Give me some proof that your actually Paul. Paul1979: Well, I know that I helped you get into that Music School by mailing off that video tape. And I know you made it in. Congrats, Terri! Terri's heart pounded more. It was Paul! It had to be! Who else would help her get into this Music School? AngelChick88: Paul, where are you? Is there a way for us to meet up? Paul1979: That would be impossible Terri. I stayed gone for a reason. I just had to make sure you were okay and that they didn't hurt you. AngelChick88: What do you mean by they? Paul1979: Terri, they need me, I gotta go. We'll meet again, I promise just not now. AngelChick88: Paul, don't go and leave me hanging like this! Paul! Terri didn't get another message from Paul. By then, Jensen's message popped up. Terri's heart continued to pound. Her brother had just supposedly contact her. How was she going to handle this? And why come Paul didn't want to see her or their family? It all just didn't make sense. Send more reviews. I love em and they keep this story going :)[Chapter 14] Jensen sat outside withnhis laptop. He had been inside trying to concentrate, yet every timenhe glanced at the window, he caught sight of the moon - the same moonnthat had overlooked the beautiful moment he had been so blessed tonspend with Terri. And he was forever distracted, his thoughts fillednwith thoughts of her. He wasn't planning on IMing her so soon afternhe got back to his room, because he didn't want Terri to think thatnhe was clingy and chasing after her or anything. He had never beennthat way with other girls - he called them occasionally, but theynwere usually the ones going after him. But with Terri, he justngenuinely wanted to spend all the time with her that he possiblyncould. Something about her constantly drew him to her, even beforentheir kiss in the forest. As he lay cooped up in his room, hencouldn't take the reminder of those thoughts any more while beingnindoors, and he ventured outside. It was still warm outside, angorgeous summer night. He glanced at his watch - itnwas already one in the morning, yet he didn't feel tired at all. Ifnanything, he felt like he had been invigorated, like life had beennpumped into him as his heart spread his feelings for Terri throughoutnhis body only hours earlier. Jensen had always lovednthe openness of the outdoors. There were no boundaries, no placenthat couldn't be reached. It offered a sort of comfort, a one-nessnwith nature. It was a place to think, and somehow being in the mostnbasic and natural of all environments allowed him to get in touchnwith himself without all the modern distractions. Well, until henstarted bringing his laptop outside with him, at least. If glancing at the moonnthrough the window had made him think of Terri, being outside with itnright in front of him and being bathed in its light made itnimpossible for him to get any thoughts of her out of his head. He couldn't take it anynmore and logged on, and for a rare moment in his life, he had no cluenwhat to say to Terri. A friendly \"hi\" would sound toonfriendly after what they had just did, but it wasn't like he couldnsend her some poetic romantic poem either - she might find it creepynor stalkerish. FootballStar72: Hey,nTerri. Every time I see the moon, it seems like I can't get my mindnoff of everything that happened in the forest. I've been thinkingnabout you. No, he couldn't put that. It sounded too.. needy. Jensen erased it and tried again. FootballStar72: Hey,nTerri, I'm glad you're still on and you got into your dorm room okay. I'm outside on my laptop right now. It's so beautiful out tonight. Not perfect, but better. He could live with that. AngelChick88: Hi, Jensen. I... something's happened. I don't know how to tell you. I don'tneven know what or how to feel right now, I'm so confused and happynand scared and angry all at the same time. Jensen instinctivelynwished that he could give Terri a hug or some comfort - just holdingnher felt wonderful for him, and it made him glad to be able toncomfort her. But he couldn't, so he just stuck with replying. IMingnpeople felt so impersonal, and he couldn't convey all of the thoughtsnthat were rushing through his head, he couldn't express the worry innhis voice. FootballStar72: Terri, arenyou okay? What's wrong? He wished he could see hernface - was she crying? What was wrong? AngelChick88: It's Paul. He... he just IMed me like a few seconds ago. FootballStar72: What?! You mean your brother Paul? AngelChick88: Yeah. He'snnot dead - i don't know if he faked his death or if someone else did,nand he kept mentioning this mysterious \"they.\" I don'tnknow who they are, if they are helping him or if they're hurting him,nand I'm so frustrated because I don't know where he is, and I can'tnbe happy because I'm afraid, and I don't know why he didn't talk tonme earlier, and... FootballStar72: Shhh,nTerri, take a deep breath. Calm down. We can get through this. Start at the beginning. AngelChick88: Okay, well,nPaul send me a message and said that there wasn't an open casket atnthe funeral because he really wasn't dead. I think that he wanted toncontact me, but he couldn't for some reason. I think he's in somensort of trouble, because he said that he had to leave right away. Hensaid that he didn't let me know because he was afraid that I wouldnget hurt - and I know it's him because he told me about how he got meninto this school. He promised me that he'd contact me again, though. I don't know what to do. FootballStar72: I'm surenhe had a good reason for not contacting you. If he is in some sortnof trouble, they probably didn't want him talking to anyone orncalling the police. I don't know what he could be mixed up in,nTerri. I wish I could be more help, but I'm not. I might have ancouple of friends who can help us out, but I'm not sure. Whatever itnis, Paul kept you away from it for a good reason, so I don't thinknyou should go after them by yourself, if They're able to find outnwhere you are. Maybe you should wait until Paul contacts you againnand you can find out more about him. But I don't know when he'll getnthe chance to talk to you again. I think that if he was in realnphysical harm that he'd let you know so you could try to save him,nbut then again they might be monitoring his conversations and tellingnhim what to say, too. Terri, are you going to be okay tonight? Donyou need me to come over? I'd feel better if I knew that you werenemotionally okay and physically safe. Terri sighed and looked atnJensen's question. He was concerned about her how sweet. Should shentell him to come over? it was already so late. Onnthe other hand, she still felt a bit afraid to be alone right now. What if whoever had been watching Paul, was nownalso watching her to as well? What if she was in danger right nownafter she got through talking to Paul and now talking tonJensen about this? She needed Jensen to be with her right now to holdnher, comfort her, keep her safe and promisenher nothing wouldn't happen to her.She needed her Knight in ShiningnArmor. Terri began typing asnAngelchick88: I think should come over right now.I-I-I'm feeling sonscared and confused. I don't know what to do about Paul.nShould I tell Mom and Dad about this? What if whoever is after Paulnis also watching me to? Jensen, I'm so scared! And I hatento bother you this late. But I really do need you right now herenwith me\". Terri then sent the message. Then shenwaited for Jensen's response. FootballStar72: Okay, I'llnbe there as soon as I can Terri.Just stay where you are alright. Angelchick88: Okay. Seenyou soon Jensen. Jensen had already signednoff and was on his way to her dorm room right now. Denise layed innbed and was snoring right then. She laid sprawlednout on her back, one arm laying over the edge of the bed. Terrincouldn't help but laugh at her a bit.If Denise got a bitntoo loud, they might have to go up to the roof top where things wouldnbe more quiet or to Jensen's dorm room. Soonna knock sounded on the door. Terri looked out the peephole. It wasnJensen. His green eyes met hers. Terri opened thendoor and let him in.Denise kept snoring away regardless of anyone innthe room.[Chapter 15] Jensen was more than glad that Terri accepted. She wasn't bothering him at all - he would have been upset had she told him not to come. If he wasn't staying up with her, he would have been sick with worrying about her anyway, and feeling guilty even though she told him not to come. So he quickly packed up his laptop and decided to bring it with him to Terri's dorm (just in case) and changed into some darker clothes as opposed to the lighter ones he had been wearing earlier that evening. The lighter clothes were too obvious and reflective, and the last thing he needed was to be seen sneaking around the girls' dorm rooms after midnight. Sure, he could make up a stupid excuse like just making sure everything was safe, or just cleaning up around there, but that could easily be seen as suspicious, and he'd rather avoid the whole thing altogether. Luckily for Jensen, most of the lights in the halls were off. He smacked himself on the forehead, realizing he should have brought a flashlight or something, as he could barely make out the numbers on the dorms. If he could even remember Terri's room number... what was it? 422? 224? Jensen sighed and reached for his cell phone, deciding to just call Terri himself and ask her, cursing slightly as he hit his arm on a doorknob. He turned around, moving towards the center of the hall to avoid a mishap, when he tripped on something and toppled over. Then, as the thing fell on top of him, Jensen realized that it wasn't a something, but a someone. Oh boy, this would look wonderful to see a teacher sneaking about. He was lucky the girl didn't start screaming. But wait, why wouldn't she be? \"Quick-thinking, strong, quick... well, I guess you can't expect a football player to be graceful on top of all that,\" the voice teased, and then Jensen realized that it had been Terri who fell on top of him. Laughing in relief, Jensen hugged her in greeting, kissing the top of her head before righting himself and helping Terri up. He was glad to see Terri happy for just a moment, though she quickly sighed and the smile on her face turned to a frown. He could tell she was thinking of Paul - they could talk once they reached her dorm room, however, and Terri pulled out a flashlight. \"I figured you'd need a little help getting here,\" she explained, leading him to her dorm room and welcoming him inside. Denise muttered something in her sleep, then rolled over, leaving Jensen to breathe a sigh of relief that he and Terri hadn't woken her up. Terri led Jensen to a different part of the dorm. Jensen dimmed the flashlight so it wouldn't bother Denise and sat on a beanbag chair, pulling Terri into his arms. She rested against him with a sigh, burying her face in his chest. Holding her comforted Jensen - even if he couldn't always be there protecting her when something went wrong, he could always try to. He couldn't help it, he was protective by nature, and he felt like he could shield her from everything that could go wrong in the world just by being there with her. After going back in forth in his mind about whether or not Terri would open up, he figured that she might not talk until he asked her or at least opened up a window for conversation. \"If there's anything at all that you want to talk about, Terri, I'm here for you. Even if you just want me to listen. Anything at all.\" said Jensen. After resting in his chest for a few moments, Terri let out a sigh. Then she looked at Jensen she felt so safe with his arms wrapped protectively around her. \"It's Paul. I'm worried about him Jensen. I wonder where he is, if he's safe, and I wonder if they are hurting him. Not knowing where he is is just frustrating me and I keep wondering who is this \"They\", they speak of. I have this awful feeling that Paul might be involved in a gang and drugs might be involved. When we were living back home, Paul was usually quiet and kept to himself. But sometimes he would talk to me. I thought We talked about everything together. If something was bothering him, he would have told me. I just wondered why didn't he tell me the trouble he was then? Also, when I logged off the computer, I started not to feel safe anymore. I Couldn't help but think what if whoever is has Paul is also watching me and waiting to strike? Now I feel like maybe someone is watching me and spying on me. And that just doesn't make me feel safe. The only time I feel really safe is when I'm with you. You make me feel like nothing can harm me as long as your around\". she told him and looked into his eyes. Jensen really did offer her comfort, security, and safety and most of all love. When she was around him, Terri felt safe like nothing bad could ever happen to her. Terri briefly wondered if Jensen could stay in their dorm that night. At least until she felt better about being on her own again in the dorm. Denise wouldn't mind Jensen being there at night. Plus, Terri and Jensen wouldn't sleep together anyhow. If Jensen slept anywhere, it could be on the sofa in the small livingroom in the dorm they were sitting in right now. but if he didn't want to stay there with her, Terri couldn't beg him to. It had to be what he wanted and what he felt like he needed to do to keep her safe. They were lucky to have not waken Denise. About all Denise did was stir a little in her sleep and roll over, and that was it. Terri had led Jensen to her and Denise's small livingroom. It consisted of a tv that was 25 inches, two sofas, a chair, and a bookshelf. They sat on the bean bag in the corner near the sofa. Terri relaxed as Jensen held her in his strong arms. She appreciated him being there for her wanting to listen to all her problems.[Chapter 16] Jensen hated not being able to say everything that he wanted to say to comfort Terri. He couldn't sit there and tell her that nothing was wrong, that everything would be alright, that Paul was okay and healthy, or even still alive, or that he would always be there for her. He couldn't know any of those things. He couldn't even tell her where Paul was or what was wrong with him, or how she could find him. Just sitting there holding Terri, Jensen felt like he was clutching her, trying to protect her to no avail - how could he really protect her, or be there for her when she needed him, if there were so many unanswered questions? How could he make her feel better when he felt lost in all of their combined emotions. All he could do was hold her and try to help her. And love her. And love her, he repeated to himself, feeling reassured as he repeated the phrase over and over. \"Terri... there's so many things I want to say to you that I can't. And you wouldn't believe me even if I could. I can't tell you that Paul is okay, or that everything will turn out perfectly, or even for the better. I can't tell you that your life will return to normal. If there was any way in the entire world that I could promise you those things, I would do it, whatever the cost. But I can't. All I can do is promise to do my best to protect you and help you, and be there for you. I feel so guilty, not being able to do everything for you, to make everything better. I want to badly to be able to wave a magic wand and have everything be alright, but I'm not a fairy godmother. But I'll be here for you as long as it's possible, however long you need me to be. Not just because I feel like you want me to, but because I honestly want to. I'd be sick worrying about you if I wasn't over here, right now, with you. I could be in Hawaii on the most relaxing resort and I'd still be uneasy and I couldn't enjoy myself at all, because I wouldn't know if you were safe. There's no place else I'd rather be. And Terri, I really mean that. I'll always love you and be here for you as long as I can help it\" \"I know it hurts you that your brother wasn't being completely honest with you, if that is the case. I do think that there's a really strong possibility that his death had to do with drugs. What you have to understand is that Paul wasn't himself during whatever time he could have been using those drugs. Anything he said or didn't say, it wasn't his fault. And I'm sure that, if his faked death had to do with the drugs, he was trying to protect you by not telling you. Knowing how close you said you are to Paul, I'm sure there's a very good reason why he didn't tell you about those drugs. I'm sure he's very protective of his little sister and just wanted you to be safe. So don't be upset about what Paul did or didn't do, because none of that matters any more. What matters is first of all, that you get some sleep right now because you look exhausted, and second of all, that we start looking for Paul first thing tomorrow.\" Terri nodded at his words and let them sink in. Jensen was right about a lot of what he had said and he was great comfort just by being there for her. Terri was glad that he was going to help her find Paul and he realized just how important her brother was to. Terri did feel exhausted right then and wasn't surprised if Jensen noticed it. He was right. They both needed some sleep for they had a busy day tomorrow. With Class and trying to find Paul. Terri decided to keep this quiet from her parents. There was no use in worrying them about Paul now especially if her and Jensen could find him with the help of his friends. \"Jensen I know there's not a whole lot you can't do in this situation.And your right about everything you said.Your just a great a great comfort to me right now just by being here.And I'm touched you want to help me find Paul.And we should get some sleep since we got a big day tomorrow. If it's not too much to ask, could you spend the night here with me? At least until this whole thing with Paul is sorted out and I feel safer again. Denise won't mind.\" Terri hoped he said yes. She still remained in his arms because they offered her safety and security. \"Shhh, of course I'll stay. I could never find it in myself to leave you here like this by yourself, not even if you wanted with me to leave. I couldn't do that to you. I'll stay as long as you need me to. Come on, let's get you to bed, okay\" Terri had smiled when he told her that he would stay with her, and her smile reached out to warm his heart. She groggily responded, \"Mmm hmmm,\" her face buried in his chest and her voice muffled by his shirt. Jensen picked Terri up, realizing that she was surprisingly easy to carry - easier than he thought it would be. Then again, things were remarkably easier when you actually wanted to do them - if he were lugging around football equipment that weighed half as much as Terri, he probably would have found the equipment twice as heavy. Jensen placed Terri gently down on her bed, wrapping the covers around her and making sure she was comfortable. He gave her one last hug before he left to sleep on the couch, softly kissing her. Later in the night, Jensen woke up on the couch and went up to get a glass of water. He came across Terri, sleeping peacefully, soundly, and he couldn't help but tuck a strand of hair behind her ear. She shifted slightly, and he could have sworn he heard his name on her lips as she slept. Smiling, Jensen went back to the couch to go back to sleep. Terri had somehow found a way to sleep peacefully last night. She thinks it was because of Jensen's presence in their dorm that made her feel safer. Terri woke to the sound of Denise's alarm clock. Terri groaned as Denise's cheerful voice sounded close to her. \"Wake up Sleepyhead, or your going to be late for Jensen's Class again\", said Denise in a slight teasing tone. \"One more hour, pleaseeeeee\", Terri moaned not wanting to get up. Both her and Jensen had stayed up late, and Terri knew last night that it would be hard to get up the next day. \"One more hour and it will be 8:00. Come on Terri, you know how Jensen doesn't like for any of his students to be late. Especially you\". Denise said then she opened the Kurtains revealing sunlight which shone in Terri's face. Terri covered her eyes with her hands. \"Denise, That is soooooo harsh! I'm going to pay you back for this!\" Terri grumbled and sat up. \"Where is Jensen?\" she asked noticing he wasn't sleeping on the couch. Denise smiled \"You know Teachers. They gotta be in class earlier than we do. He left here around seven this morning. Now it's seven thirty.\" \"That's not even enough time to even have a decent breakfast\", Terri grumbled more. Denise \"There is some blueberry pastries in the kitchen. I made them earlier this morning. Jensen grabbed a few on his way out. You can eat them on the way to class and have some juice.\" Terri got dressed in a pair of blue jean shorts, and a purple tank top that had a big butterfly on it. She didn't have time to wear her hair in waves. So she decided to wear it straight. Then she brushed her teeth. Terri ate the pastry and drank some orange juice on the way to class. By the time they got there, everyone was eager to start working on their solos. Terri and Denise sat in the middle of the Class and waited for Jensen to get everything started. \"So, how did you and Jensen's date go last night?\" Denise whispered to her but not loud enough for everyone to hear. Terri gave Denise an alarmed look and whispered, \"Not in here Denise! Someone might overhear. I'll tell you all about it later, I promise\". Denise nodded understanding \"Okay. But I want full details later!\" and she sat up just as Jensen walked in the classroom. Terri's heart beated fast as Jensen walked into the room looking hotter than ever. Today he wore a navy blue t-shirt and a paire of Kaki Pants.He looked hot no matter what he wore.Terri couldn't believe that she was now dating Jensen her Music Teacher.She felt like a huge burden was lifted off her shoulders now that she knew he felt the same towards her and they were now a couple! Terri felt all giddy inside. She was in a much better mood today.[Chapter 17] Jensen loved having his students work together on group activities, because they could really accomplish so much in such a short period of time when they worked together, and he felt more and more impressed each time he saw the results of a project. He also enjoyed hearing the students discuss their ideas and work things out together. After all, they needed to learn how to compromise, share ideas, and work in a group together. As Jensen walked by Robin's group, he was pleasantly surprised. So far, she really had made good on her promise to try to act better. Not only was she laughing and talking with the group, she also was getting a lot done and had some really good ideas. Her behavior did seem a little forced and unnatural, but he couldn't think less of her for that. She was trying, really trying, and that was what mattered. Being more open and friendly to people would come with time. Jensen noticed that other students in the group also had excellent ideas, and that Robin was open to them instead of dismissing them like she would have done a couple of days ago. He was glad to see that she was acting more modest and humble instead of showing off all the time - she needed to give the other students some credit, as well. Even if she was only doing this for the solo, it certainly was a good start, and it was possible it would give her a push in the right direction. While the whole class was involved in their papers and songs, Jensen walked past Terri, briefly touching her arm and smiling reassuringly at her. Terri smiled back and Jensen walked away before anyone would notice. He wanted to make sure she was doing okay after last night. She seemed to really be enjoying the project, which was great. He thought that it would be right up her ally. He noticed that Terri was also helping Vanessa, who he was pleased to see in her group. Terri was already wonderful at what the class was working on, and she was a good person for Vanessa to work with. Hopefully Vanessa could catch on. \"Okay, are you guys ready to perform, or do you need a few more minutes?\" Jensen asked the class. Terri got so excited when she heard they were all going to do a songwriting activity. How Brilliant! She thought. Both her and Denise joined two other students named Vanessa and Mark. Vanessa was the same student whom Jensen had talked to earlier. Terri now saw this as her opportunity to share her new songwriting skills and idea. The other night she had began a new song called Hideaway. And had stopped after the first chorus because of writer's block. The others agreed to help Terri Write the rest after seeing her Writers block and the four of them sat down to write it. It didn't take them long to finish up a whole song. Terri was amazed at how much you could accomplish just by working with others as a team. Terri noticed Jensen going to and from the tables checking out kids work. Had Terri known that Jensen had walked over to her bed that morning, and studied her features even without makeup, Terri would have been horrified. She rarely let anyone see her without makeup except her parents and maybe even Paul and her friends. But rarely let guys see her without it. She had no idea that Jensen thought she was more prettier without it.[Chapter 18] Everyonenin the room was excited to be able to finally perform what they hadnbeen working so hard on for the past hour. Even Robin's group wasnexcited about the song they wrote with her for her solo. Meanwhile,nTerri and her group discussed who should sing the song. They allnagreed Terri should since she had the best singing voice, it was hernsong to. So, it was only fair that she got to sing it. They stoppedntalking once Jensen began to speak. Robin spoke up \"I thinknwe're ready to perform\". she said. The others nodded.\"Alright.nWhat song are you singing? asked Jensen curious to what Robin and herngroup came up with. Robin and her group came to the front of the roomnto demonstrate. \"The name of the song is called Get overnIt\".Both her and the group started to sing it. The song had anhip hop feel and some people were tapping their feet to it. Vanessanglanced over the song lyrics one more time. For the first time, shenwas actually proud of something that she had helped write and create.nShe really had put a lot of herself into the song. Of course, it wasnTerri's idea, but it was something that a lot of people could relatento, including herself. And while she agreed that, if only one personnwas going to sing the song, it should be Terri because she was thenone with the idea and all, and she was such a great singer, butnVanessa couldn't help but feel that maybe the group should sing thensong together. It was, after all, a group project, and she reallynwanted to try expressing herself through something she helped create,nand she wanted Jensen's opinion and tips on how she could be better.nHe couldn't help her if she didn't at least try, after all. Butnwould Terri be mad at her? Vanessa glanced over at Terri, noticingnher eyes were set on Robin's group, which was performing. Robin wasnsuch a good singer, too! Maybe Terri should just sing the song...nshe felt nervous about singing in front of such talented people. Shenwas new at this, and she was sure she wasn't as good a singer asnRobin and Terri were. Terri would be the person who could do theirnsong the best, after all, and they wanted to have as good anperformance as possible. Then again, Vanessa thought, the idea of angroup project was for people to work together and learn things fromneach other. And she noticed that Jensen never said that they would bengraded on this project - she guessed that he just wanted them tonexplore new territory. And after all, she hadn't known Terri for verynlong, but she seemed nice enough and wasn't full of herself like somenother really talented people were. Terri was an easy person to relatento. So she tapped Terri and was greetednwith a friendly, open face. Calmingnherself down, Vanessa asked, \"I was wondering. I know that thisnis your song and I totally respect it if you want to perform it bynyourself, but I really learned a lot from you during this groupnproject. I know that you could perform this song better than I could,nbut I really wanted to give the song a try, too, just so I can learnnhow to express myself better. So I was wondering - do you think wencould split this song up between the group? You know, like differentnpeople could take different verses, and we could add backgrounds andnharmonies and stuff? If that's okay with you, I mean.\" Vanessansaid all of this in almost one breath, she was nervous to be askingnTerri about this. Terrinwatched Robin and the others perform their group song. Even thoughnher and Robin didn't exactly get along, Terri enjoyed watching hernperform and thought she had a lot of talent as a singer. Terrinthought that if they could ever be friendly to one another, Terrinwould give her some advice on performing and things like that. Justnto be helpful to her. Robin's group did a great job on the song,nand she was sure others would like it to. Terri was surprised whennVanessa tapped her on the shoulder and was asking her the questionnshe wanted to ask. Terri noticed Vanessa was a bit nervous in askingnthe song, in which she shouldn't be. Terri didn't mind who sang thensong with her. Terri smiled at Vanessa to show she wasn't mad aboutnher idea. Vanessa was very creative, and deserved some credit to thensong. \"Sure! I don't mind if everyone sings in the song, it'llnbe interesting having everyone sing different parts. Your ideas soundngreat to me. Don't ever be afraid to come to me about ideas. Also,nif there's anything you need help with, I'll be more than glad tonhelp you out and give you some advice.\" Afterneveryone clapped for the first group, Jensen said \"Good job Robinnand your group, the song was great. Anyone next?\" he asked. Robinnspoke up \"I think Terri's group should go next\". Terrinwas a bit surprised when Robin mentioned that their group should gonfirst. Terri thought Robin did that because it would put their groupnin the spotlight, which was pretty embarrassing. And, they were justntrying to decide at the last minute who should sing what. \"Yeahnsure why not, we're all ready to sing and were just discussing whonshould sing what and add in last minute ideas. Ready everyone?\"nasked Terri. Her group nodded and so Terri started them off bynsinging the first part of the song, Vanessa began in on the secondnverse then the rest of them joined in together harmonizing. Itnsounded really great, and it made both Terri and Vanessa less nervousnto sing in front of the class. Singing in front of the class didn'tnbother Terri that much. It was singing in front of Jensen that madenher more nervous. Terri smiled and didn't let the nervousness show,nand the group did a fantastic job. Whenntalking to the group, Jensen made sure not to spend too muchnattention focusing on Terri. First, it would look suspicious to thenclass. Second, even though she seemed surprised each time she heardnhis compliments, Terri already knew just how talented he thought shenwas, and there was no need to keep restating that in front of thenclass and making her feel uncomfortable. So instead, Jensennconcentrated on the group as a whole. He'd talk to Vanessa privatelynlater. She was a little shy, and he figured she wouldn't want to bensingled out in front of the whole class. Besides, she had asked thenquestion to him in private for a reason, and he felt like she trustednhim not to talk about her to other people, which he respected. \"Firstnof all, I'm really impressed that you could work out the harmonies innsuch a short period of time. There was a lot going on there, and Incan tell how much work and effort you put into it. And mostnimportantly, your song captured the purpose of this assignment, whichnwas to express yourself, which you did very well. The style of thensong really fit the lyrics and the ideas and emotions you were tryingnto get across. Beautiful.\" As the next group was getting ready,nJensen took Vanessa to the side for a moment. \"Are you getting anbetter idea of what you asked me about before, now?\" he asked,ngiving her a gentle smile. Vanessannodded, her eyes brighter than they had been earlier. Jensenncontinued. \"I figured that working in groups would help you.nSee, you can do anything you put your mind to. Just believe in yournability to do well, and you'll be just fine. You're have a lot ofnpotential,\" Jensen said. Another part of his job that he lovednwas watching his students beam under praise. Andnhe also realized that he had a responsibility to be honest with thenstudents and tell them the truth about their performance and not justnblindly compliment them out of fear of hurting their feelings, so hisnstudents really knew that, when he gave them a compliment, it wasndefinitely sincere and well-meant. Through the rest of the class, thenrest of the songs included a soft, slow song sung by a group of hisnrather quiet students, with just a flute accompaniment, and a songnwith a lively jazz beat by a group of students who sat in the cornernthat Jensen had mentally labeled as his energy drink group. And thennof course, there was an angry rock song sung by some students who,nafter picking their groups, discovered they really didn't enjoynworking together all that much. Oh well, at least they got theirnfeelings across. After that, the class ended, and Jensen figured henshould talk to Terri about their plans to find Paul in the fewnminutes he had before the auditions for the solo started. Terrinwas glad that class ended so soon now that her and Jensen could benalone and discuss what to do about Paul. She gathered her books andnwalked over to where Jensen had put two chairs in front of his Pianonso they could talk. Terrinwas glad that Jensen stayed in her and Denise's Dorm to make surenthat she was safe and no one would come after her. She had badnfeelings of what Paul may be messed up into, but she wasn't exactlynsure. Also, Terri was incredibly thirsty and she had to get the songn\"Metamorphosis\" that she was working on the other night andnshe had writer's block she was wanting Jensen to help her with. \"Jensen, I need tonrun back to the room for a bit to get us some drinks and that song Inwas working on. Is that fine?\" Terri asked. It wouldn't take hernlong to get what she needed.[Chapter 19] Jensennstood awkwardly in the middle of the room, truly feeling out of placenin front of the one person he felt he could truly, completely, benhimself around. And now... everything just felt broken. Runningnthrough those hallways, he had felt anxiousness fill up his insides,nnot knowing what Terri would be doing, and feeling that he couldnsomehow help her more by reaching her more quickly... And maybe henwasn't entirely wrong in thinking that, he thought to himself,nnoticing the half-packed suitcase that lay on her bed. And thosenrushes of anxiety and emotions were all gone now - they were replacednby a numbness. The girl he felt such a strong, unbreakable connectionnto, was now the girl that he didn't know what to say to. He hadn'tneven done anything wrong, but he still felt guilty. He couldn't standnseeing her so upset, with red and puffy eyes and tears streaming downnher face - she had been through so much, and she didn't deserve anynmore pain. He could barely deal with seeing that brief flash ofnhundreds of emotions, sadness, anger, guilt, wash across her facenevery time he could tell that she was thinking of Paul. And so, evennthough he would never intentionally cause her pain, it was still himnthat she was crying over, it was still him who had hurt hernfeelings... and he felt guilty for her. He longed to just wrap her innhis arms and wash away her pain, but he didn't know how well she'dnrespond, so he continued to stand awkwardly. Henwatched as Terri collapsed down onto her bed, not even strong enoughnto remain standing any more, and his heart went out to her. He pulledna chair next to the bed, close as he could be without touching her. \"Shhh,nTerri, I would never, ever, do anything to hurt you. I love you,\"nhe saw her begin to shake her head and resisted the urge to hold hernhead still and pull her to him. \"I didn't kiss Robin. I wouldnnever kiss Robin, I have no reason to. Everything I've done to her,nevery contact I've ever had, was to reprimand her for something shendid to you. I can't stand the girl. I've been dealing with her,noffering her a solo, even, just in the hopes that she might leave younalone. I've always chosen you over her and would never do anything tonchange that. Robin kissed me. I was just in so much shock, I couldn'tnpush her away. I really thought that she was starting to change, butnI guess, with people like that, they never really change. I'm takingnaway her solo and audition. She doesn't deserve it after what she didnto you, and her promises to do better are just a pack of lies. Terri,nplease believe me. You're the best thing that's ever happened to me.nYou complete me, you're everything I didn't even dare to dream ofnbecause I thought it only existed in fairy tales. I'd never donanything that would drive you away from me. Terri, I love you. I lovenyou, I love you, I love you. If you believe anything, if you go awaynwith anything that I've ever taught you, let it be that.\" Thenwords \"I love you\", repeated through Terri's head as shenlaid their listening to Jensen's deep voice. As he explainedneverything that had happened in that music room. Robin did sound likenthe type of person that would do something like that. Impulsivelynkiss Jensen just to make her feel insecure about her and Jensen. Hisnwords sounded like he meant every word he said. Jensen didn't reallynmean to hurt her. In fact, he didn't do anything wrong,nRobin did. So if she felt anger at anyone, it should be at Robin, notnJensen. Terri got some tissue and then dabbed at her eyes. Then shenwent to get into his lap and began to speak. \"JensennI believe that you do love me and that you wouldn't intentionallynhurt me. Robin does sound like the type of person that would donimpulsive things like that. If I had seen what she done earlier, Inwouldn't have gotten upset at you. You are the best thing that's evernhappened to me to, I wouldn't have this chance of winning this recordndeal if it weren't for you. The main reason I had started to pack wasnbecause of Robin. I just was so scared that she would take everythingngood away from me again and I would go back to being miserable. I wasnso scared of losing you to her, Robin has a way of winning men overnand I don't. Robin is so determined in taking you from me and mynsolo! I was so upset that I kept telling myself sooner or later,nshe's going to take you from me, my solo, and I would be stucknanother year here trying to get that record deal! I guess I felt likenjust giving up on that solo and felt like what's the point in tryingnif it's going to get taken from me. I've always felt like a loner,na nerd that would never fit in anywhere. And if I ever found love,nand was happy, then something bad might happen. Before I met you, Inalso thought love only existed in Fairy Tales. I don't want to losenyou to Robin Jensen, I love you to.\" Terri grabbed his shirt andnclinged onto him as if she was almost afraid that he might dissapear.[Chapter 20] Jensennswept Terri into his arms, clinging to her protectively, overwhelmednand overcome by the power of his emotions and feelings of love fornher. He so desperately wanted to be her hero and protector to watchnover her and keep her safe, and whenever she felt threatened, hurt,nor upset, he felt as if he had failed her, and felt endlessly guilty,nwhether it was his fault or not. He could see the hurt in her eyes asnshe talked about Robin, and realized that she didn't truly believenthat he was really with her. Throughout her life, she had loved withnno reward except loss after loss, everything she loved being stolennaway from her. It was no wonder she had trouble trusting and lovingnand believing anymore. Who would want to bring themselves to lovensomeone and be happy with someone, if they were afraid of the pain ofnloving too much, only to have that person be taken away from them? Nonwonder she seemed to have the tendency to not believe people whonloved her, if she felt that it could only lead to more hurt. Thenthought of being with Robin sent Jensen's stomach reeling as it was,nand with the added knowledge that it would hurt Terri, the person henloved and respected more than anything else he had now or had evernhad in his life, Jensen was horrified at the mere, briefest thoughtnof that ever happening. \"Shhh...nTerri, not all of your life will be a fairy tale. No one's is, nonmatter how hard they try. Things go wrong. The things we love arentaken away from us, sometimes even the people and things we carenabout most. Not everyone can find their prince or princess that'snperfect for them, and not everyone can have a fairy godmother to getnthem to the ball. We don't all have happy endings. And you know what?nNone of that matters. None of it. We love and we lose, and that'snokay. That old saying that it's better to love and have lost than tonnever have loved at all? It's true. More than you can imagine, it'sntrue. And I don't know about you, but I've already found my princess.nAnd I know that no matter how many dragons or evil stepmothers orneven... Robins... I encounter, I would never leave her or letnanything happen to her. Because I love her. I love you. And I knownthat you're insecure about yourself, and you know what, that's okay,ntoo. Everyone has their problems, and everyone has their flaws. Theynmake us who we are, and I'll always love you for just what you are,nno matter what. But I also want to help you get past your problemsnwith insecurity, because I want you to grow to be the best person youncan be, and I can tell that your self doubt is holding you back. Incan't blame you for not wanting to believe that I really love you.nYou've loved and lost so much in your life, and I guess you can'tnhelp but feel that I'm the next one to leave you. But I want you tonknow that I'm not. I'll never leave you, Terri, ever. I don't knownwhat other guys could possibly see in Robin, or in any girl but you,nfor that matter. Robin is the most self-centered, arrogant, snobbish,negotistical, stuck-up brat I've ever come across in my entirenexistence. She tries to flirt with me relentlessly, despite the factnthat she is my student and is in no position to do so, she thinks shencan get whatever she wants just because of her money. I don't see hownanyone could possibly find that attractive. You would never, ever, innyour wildest dreams, ever need to worry about me leaving you for hernor for any other girl. I love you so much, and I feel this connectionnto you that I've never felt with anyone else, ever. I've barelynknown you for very long, and you already know me so much better thannanyone else. I can understand you and talk about you with things thatnI've never talked about with anyone, ever before. You're sonbeautiful, Terri, inside and out. And inside is the only thing thatnmatters to me - you have such a gorgeous heart and such passion fornothers and what you do. Don't put that passion aside just becausenyou're afraid, Terri. You need to believe in love and yourself.\" Terrinlistened to Jensen and he sounded like he meant every word. She couldnalso see the love in his eyes as he spoke directly to her explainingnhis feelings for her. Terri felt bad for doubting Jensen any. And,nshe knew she had a problem with her insecurity. Right before herneyes, was this great guy, her Prince. That's right. Jensen was hernPrince. The love of her life. And, to hear those words that she wasnhis Princess, made her feel great inside. Jensen said she had a greatnheart, was beautiful inside and out, and, he loved her, not Robin.Andnthat was enough to make Terri believe Jensen. He could be trusted shenknew that. But Robin couldn't be trusted. Terri smiled at Jensen herntears now subsiding, she had her arms around his neck. And his strongnmuscular arms were around her slender waist. She did feel safe in hisnarms and she never wanted him to let her go.\"I know I have anproblem with my insecurity. I started having problems with it after Inlost Paul and Jay. I shouldn't let it hold me back, your right aboutnthat. I'm sorry I misunderstood you with Robin earlier. It's justnwhen I saw you with her I didn't know what to think I was confused\",nshe said.\"I'm just so happy to hear that you love only me andnthat you can't stand Robin. I believe I have found my Prince rightnhere in front of me, and my knight in shining Armor. when I'm withnyou I feel safe, and loved\". Terri snuggled closer so she couldnlean into his chest. And she turned slightly, so she could still facenhim. \"I don't want to leave here either, I want to be with younand get that record deal\". Terri had no clue that Jensen wasnabout to sing her a song expressing his love for her. AsnJensen glanced around the room, he spotted his guitar that he hadnleft there the night before. When he went to Terri's dorm, he decidednto bring it with him - music had always served as a comfort to him, anway to work out his feelings. He could put his feelings into music,nbecause he was incapable of putting them into words. Gently puttingnTerri down on the bed for a moment, Jensen walked over to get hisnguitar, then sat down next to Terri again.\"Terri, I wish I couldnbe so gifted as to be able to put everything I feel for you intonwords, words that would make you believe my love for you for allneternity, to wash away your insecurity, and keep me always besidenyou, if not in body, then in spirit and heart. But I can't. There'snso much to say, and if I had since the beginning of time up untilnnow, I'd still be talking right now, still trying to tell you how Infeel about you. And as much as I'd love to try that and test thatntheory, I know that I've always had more of a way with music thannwith speaking. So this is a song I wrote for you... Maybe that cannshow you how much I love you.\" Jensennpulled her against him, a look so tender in his eyes that it meltednher heart. As he gazed into her eyes, he began to sing. \"Thenstrands in your eyes Thatncolor them wonderful Stopnme and steal my breath Emeraldsnfrom mountains Thrustntowards the sky Nevernrevealing their depth\" Jensennsmiled through his song, adoring the way Terri's eyes lit up -nreally, he couldn't have picked a more appropriate way to start thensong. Her eyes were filled with hope and wonder, and he saw her painnfading away, and a connection with them stronger than even thenmountains he mentioned in his song. Tellnme that we belong together Dressnit up with the trappings of love I'llnbe captivated, I'llnhang from your lips Insteadnof the gallows Ofnheartache that hang from above Captivated,nJensen thought to himself. Pulled in, endlessly drawn to, growingninfinitely closer. Avoiding their pain, and just focusing on eachnother, let everything else die down, even if just for a moment.nTerri's arm went around him and her head leaned on his shoulder. Hisnarms already occupied with the guitar, he tilted his head to restnreassuringly on hers. I'llnbe your cryin' shoulder I'llnbe love suicide I'llnbe better when I'm older I'llnbe the greatest fan of your life Cryingnshoulder... and not because he had to, because he wanted to. Becausenhe wanted Terri's trust, unbelievably precious to him, because henwanted to make her problems disappear, for him to be able to solveneverything for her, no matter the cost. And the greatest fan of hernlife... I've dropped out Burnednup Foughtnmy way back from the dead Tunednin Turnednon Rememberednthe things you said Allnof the problems that he'd gone through, all of the problems thatnshe'd gone through, they pulled through together, and would pullnthrough again. I'llnbe your cryin' shoulder I'llnbe love suicide I'llnbe better when I'm older I'llnbe the greatest fan of your lifeI'll be your cryin' shoulder I'llnbe love suicide I'llnbe better when I'm older I'llnbe the greatest fan of your life And as he finished, Jensen sawnTerri's eyes filled with tears. Not of sadness, but of love, of joy,nof inconceivably strong emotions flowing out, of hope. Almostnhypnotically, he moved his guitar aside and held her in his arms. Thengreatest fan of her life... always. ThenGreatest Fan of her life was so touching, Terri's eyes filled withntears as Jensen sang her his song. Now she truly knew how he feltnabout her not only just in song, but how he acted towards her, how henhad saved her life just only a few days ago it seemed. Now shenbelieved Jensen only had eyes and feelings for her. He didn't evennlike Robin! Terrinloved the song that he sang for her. It was so moving and touching tonher. Never before had someone sang her a song or written her a songnjust for her. Expressing their feelings for her. It was so romanticnshe thought. As he sang to her, he gazed into her eyes as he sang it,nand she gazed at him back. It was like watching a popular rock starnsinging to a young starry eyed fan. Afternthe breakup with Jay, Terri had never expected to find love again sonsoon, and it looked like she had the real thing with Jensen. Not justnsome puppy teenage love that's only temporary. Terri had found a realnlove of her life, the kind you can only find in Fairy Tales, or likenthe kind only some people are even lucky enough to find in theirnlifetime. Jensen was in love with her and only her. Terri believednthat every word in the song Jensen sang was the truth. He really didnlove her, and there was no reason she should ever doubt his love fornher. Terri leaned against his chest hugging him tightly to her as ifnshe was afraid to let him go. This young man was with her, and notnRobin and that was hard to believe because most of the time, Robinngot the guys. She was grateful for Jensen just being there with her.nEven after what Robin had tried to do to them. Since their love wasnstrong, Terri believed her and Jensen could get through anything thatncame their way. \"Jensen,nthat song of yours was so beautiful and so touching. I believe thatnyour truly in love with me and not Robin. You show me you love me innmany different ways every day. By being there to give me advice, younsit and listen to my problems and like you sang about, your mynshoulder to cry on. Jensen, no one would listen to my problems likenyou do. I see the way you love me in how you always gaze into my eyesnand how you treat me and talk to me. I'm really sorry I had doubtsnabout you earlier, it's just I'm so used to people leaving me all thentime and when you said you would never ever leave me, it's justnamazing that your really here to stay, and that you'd only rather benwith me when you can have anyone else. I just find it really hard tonbelieve good things can happen to me. I'm touched that you really donlove and care so much about me for me being who I am and not what I'mnnot\". she leaned into his chest more, and looked up into hisnhazel eyes. Her eyes were still shedding happy tears of mostly lovenand joy.[Chapter 21] -1JarednPaladecki appears as Todd Hawkins in this story who is a friend ofnJensen's and will be Robin's love interest. Robinnfumbled in her purse for the keys to her dorm room. The eyes thatnmany associated with coldness, hardness, and sharpness, had lostntheir piercing glare... they just looked dull, defeated, numb. Shencouldn't even think straight, items falling from her purse andnclattering on the floor - bending down to pick them up, she feltnblood rush to her head, overwhelmed with confused feelings ofnsadness, pain, and anger at everything and at the same time atnnothing. Finally, she remembered that she had locked her keys in herndorm room. That final straw, so minute and trivial that wouldnnormally be no big deal to her, proved to be the one that broke thencamel's back. Robin, the proud, hard, stubborn girl, the girl whonalways kept herself collected, always let others think she was calm,ncollapsed to the floor and burst into tears, everything that hadnhappened in the past few days proving itself too much to bear. Robinnfelt alone - her father gave her money, but no love. All he carednabout was his status and his image and his money, most of all. Andnshe had friends, of course, but they weren't the kind of friends thatnyou talked about deep things with, not about what you're really likenor your feelings. Oh no, that was the dear, dear price of popularity.nShe had to constantly be strong, always the calm, collected one,nalways on display. She had to coolly reply to everything and act likennothing fazed her, remaining in charge of her group of friends, thenone everyone followed, the one who decided who would be in theirngroup and who would be out. She was the one who made all the choices,nalways in control of everyone around her as well as herself. But...nthat was all she did, that was all that her friendships were,npractically just staying in charge at any costs. But what was thenpoint of it? she asked herself for the first time in her life. Whatnwas the point of staying in charge, it never lead to anything. Was itnbecause she liked the power? She didn't know. But she couldn't talknto her friends about anything that really mattered. They gossiped,ntalked about hair and clothes and makeup and putting other peoplendown or who was having the next big party. She realized that she hadnno clue about what her friends were really like inside, or whetherneverything was just a facade, like the one she felt she was puttingnon, to remain in control. They didn't know the first thing about hern- the way she felt, why she acted the way she did, what her familynwas like, what her hopes and dreams were, what she really wanted outnof life. And that was why she was alone. A day ago, she thought shenwas surrounded by friends, but maybe, really... they were justnstrangers, relationships of convenience. Oh,nshe hoped she could get into her dorm room soon, or go somewhere. Shenneeded to get away, she didn't want anyone to see her like this, sonweak and pitiful, makeup smeared all over her face, eyes puffy andnred. She just needed to run to her car to get her spare set of keys,nbut she couldn't avoid running into someone on her way back... Anhand tapped her on the shoulder. Panic shot through her. No, someonencouldn't be seeing her like this... everyone would be talking aboutnher, and... she paused. Everyone would be talking about her. Even thenpeople she called her friends. Maybe they would turn on her just asnquickly as they had turned on Terri. And she only had herself tonblame. These were the type of people she surrounded herself with. Thennshe turned, and, filled with relief, realized it was only Todd. \"Gonaway...\" she muttered, tired of him always following her around.nWhat was up with that, anyway? \"Isnthat really what you want, Robin? If you do, I'll go.\" He said. \"Indon't know..\" Robin whispered. \"I don't know what I want.\"nAnd she burst into tears again as Todd sat down beside her. Toddnsat there and listened to Robin sit there and breakdown and cry. Henhad never seen her cry. What made her so upset? He began to help hernpick up the rest of her purse contents and said \"You know,nsometimes it makes you feel better to open up your problems tonsomeone that will listen. It's not good to keep that stuff all insidenyou, believe me, I know\". Hengave her his serious and concerned about her look and it made himnlook hot. Over the last few years Todd had changed. He went from geeknboy that used to wear glasses to the male hunk that stood before hernthat wore contacts and solid sweater and jeans. Robinnlooked at Todd and realized it would be good to have someone tonconfide in. Even if it was just him. \"I'm such a terrible personnTodd. I've ruined everything this year for me and even lost my solo.nBecause of what I did and how I've been acting\". Toddnglanced at her and handed her a tissue. \"How have you beennacting?\" he asked her. Robinntold him everything. From the first time she pushed Terri down thenstairs, and all the times she flirted with Jensen just to make Terrinupset. And she even told him about kissing Jensen in front of Terri.n\"I forced the kiss on Jensen and he got angry and took my solonprivilege away from me\". Toddnlistened carefully. He understood why Jensen took Robin's solo. Butnhe also thought Jensen had been a bit too hard on her and notnunderstanding why Robin did the things she did first. \"Why didnyou do those things to Terri Robin? What has the girl done to you tondeserve to be bullied around? he asked. Robinnwiped her eyes with a tissue. \"It's stupid really. I'm jealousnof Terri. She has the perfect life, Perfect home, Perfect boyfriend,nPerfect friends! I've never had any of those things Todd! I meannsure, my Dad gave me lots of money, anything I ever wanted as far asnmaterial stuff went. But no love. No Real true friends. I havenfriends but I don't even know who they are or what they are like onnthe inside. Most of the time, I have no one to ever truly talk tonexcept you. I guess what I really want out of life is realnfriendships, real love, and acceptance too, I guess.\" Toddnlooked at her shocked. \"You have no reason to be jealous ofnTerri. Even though now, I can see why you would be. But Terri is farnfrom being perfect, Like Jensen has told you before. She lost hernbrother and boyfriend all in one year. And from what I heard fromnJensen she trying to get everything back on track.Everyone has theirnproblems in life Robin, not just you\". \"AndnI've made things worse by bullying her around and I didn't thinknabout what she's going through. How can I make things right with hernand Jensen?\" she asked. Toddngave her his best advice. He would have to remind himself later tontalk to Jensen about him and Robin's talk. \"Start Small Robin.nTell her what you told me and that your sorry. Tell the same tonJensen. Then slowly, win their trust back\".[Chapter 22] Thenrest of the week went by peacefully for everyone. All the studentsnincluding Terri were hard at work on their solos. Those that werenchosen to sing solos alongside Terri and some other students werenRobin, Vanessa, and Kevin who had at the last minute, tried fornsolos. Those three had made it through the auditions. After a longntalk with Todd last night on the phone, Jensen considered givingnRobin the solo and thought maybe he had been a bit too harsh on her.n But, he now understood that Robin was trying to turn herself naround according to what Todd said. He only hoped that was reallyntrue. Robinnin the meantime was trying to make things right with her and Terri,nand practicing for her solo to. She stopped Terri one day after classnin her dorm to try to talk to her. Terri was skeptical in lettingnher in, but she did so at Todd and Jensen's request. Robin toldnTerri the same things she told Todd about how jealous she was ofnTerri's perfect life and how she wished her's was better. Terrinwas shocked at what all this was, just jealousy! And when Robinnapologized, Terri told Robin she accepted her apology, but it wouldnbe hard to just agree to be friends with her. UnlessnRobin could prove to be trustworthy. Robin had sighed, figuring shenhad tried making things up to Terri, and went back to singing. Laternthat evening as things winded down, Terri was alone with Jensen andnDenise in their dorm room. Terri was doing Homework online when anmessage popped up. It was Paul! It notified her that she had annemail. Terri called for Jensen to come over the computer and as shendid, she checked on the email. Jensen came over gave Terri a hug andnkissed her. \"What is it, Terri?\" he asked as he glanced at thenscreen. \"It'snPaul! He just emailed me\". she said and then both her and Jensennread the email together. Terri, Hi.nIt's Paul again. I wanted to let you know that I'm okay. I knownI kinda left you hanging there last time. Terri I want to see you andnMom and Dad so bad believe me. But if they find out I'm evennemailing you, they could kill me. I will find a way for us to meetnbut I gotta go. And by the way, good luck winning that record deal!nYou deserve it Terri!\" Love, Paul. Terrinlooked at Jensen. Jensen was surprised that Paul had contacted hernagain! \"Okay Terri, let me call my good friend Todd he's annexpert on tracing things like this. We'll find Paul and make surenhe comes home safe\". He reassured her. Withinnminutes of meeting Todd; he went straight to Terri's computer andntraced down Paul. Finally, he found him. \"Looks like Paul is nearbynin the same town in Los Angeles, on 54 Rollins Street. Looks likenhe's living with some friends\". Terrinadded \"Or possibly drug dealers. Maybe we should call the cops itnwould be a bad idea for us to go there ourselves\". \"Terri'snright\", said Jensen. \"The cops should take care of things\".nThey notified the cops about Terri's brother Paul whom they foundnand was reportedly missing. Terri didn't want to think that Paulncould be doing drugs. But him not showing himself didn't seemnright. They gave the directions to the cops where Paul was located. Paul'snPov: PaulnFletcher was talking to his drug buddies when the cops suddenlynshowed up. When they arrived, his friends told him to escape if hencould that the cops shouldn't chase him down. His so-callednfriends, he thought miserably. They weren't the kind of friends henwas suppose to have. They got him into serious trouble. Awhile back nbefore the wreck happened, he owed his so-called friends a whole lotnof money. $700 dollars for pot and other drugs he purchased. Evennthough he worked at a Movie Theater part time while going to School, nit wasn't enough to pay off his debt. Sopnduring the entire time at the Hospital, Paul decided to fake his ownndeath, figuring that if everyone knew he was dead, then no onenwould come after him, or his family. When he faked his death, Paulnran and hid in started his own life there for awhile. Butnthen his so-called friends found him and kidnapped him. Eventuallynwhat money he worked for had to go into paying them back. And whennPaul tried to leave them, they didn't want that and blackmailednhim.[Chapter 23] Paulnstood in front of Terri's music school. He was let in by anstudent and asked the receptionist for Terri. Paul hunted down hernroom number and knocked wondering how Terri was going to react oncenshe knew he was still alive. Terrinwas busy sitting on Jensen's lap and he was comforting her as theynwaited on word from Paul. Jensen knew Terri was worried about hernbrother, so he kissed her forehead. \"They will find him soon Terri.nI know they will. You'll get to see Paul Soon and he'll be safe.nI promise\". Jensen soothed and smoothed a strand of blonde hairnfrom her eyes. Justnthen a knock came to the door. Terri wondered if it could already benthe cops. Nervously, she told Jensen \"I have to get that. Comenwith me?\" she asked him. Jensen nodded and took her hand. Theynboth went to answer the door. WhennTerri opened it, the cops weren't on the other side; to bring badnnews about Paul. Instead it was…..Paul! Terri's eyes lit up, andnshe rushed towards Paul. It was true. He was alive and not dead!nTerri hugged him crying tears of joy. \"Your alive!\" she cried.nPaul embraced his sister and smiled at Jensen. Jensen smiled innreturn glad the two siblings could be reunited. \"Inmissed you so much! Where have you been?! Terri fussed over at Paulnand looked at him. Paulnlooked at her \"It's a long story. And, it involved using drugsnand being part of a gang. That's why I had to fake my death\". Terrininvited her brother in. \"Well, we've got a few hours free. Dontell us everything!\" Terri introduced Paul to Jensen and Todd whonhad helped traced Paul down. And the four sat down to listen tonPaul's story.[Chapter 24] Louisville,nKentucky fourth of July Thennext few days came and went. Terri had invited both Jensen and Denisen along with her and Paul to the Annual Fletcher family barbeque. Itnwas also Terri's birthday and Terri couldn't be happier. She hadnher brother back, and things between her and Jensen were great oncenagain. Thenfour of them had piled into Jensen's blue convertible. The nightnbefore, Terri had asked her parent's if her friends could come.nTerri didn't tell them Paul was alive, she wanted them to be ansurprise to her mom and dad, plus their Aunt Nina. Itntook them 8 hours to drive to Kentucky. Jensen had offered to buynplane tickets, but Terri insisted on them to take a road trip. Sonhere they were, in a car listening and singing to music. Denise andnTerri sang along to pop/rock songs. And Paul and Jensen sang along ton80's rock songs. Both Paul and Jensen became fast friends. Jensennpulled up to the address Terri told them to go to. \"We're here\".nThe house was a cream yellow color (The Fletcher's had repaintednit.) and the backyard had been fenced in. Terri's Dad was on thenback porch getting the grill started. Everyonensoon got out. Jensen opened Terri's door for her and took her handnand smiled. He was a bit nervous in meeting the parent's so soon,nbut he hoped they would warm up to him since he helped save Paul andnbeen looking out for Terri at school. Terri'snmom came out and so did her Dad followed by Aunt Nina. First, theynhugged Terri glad to see her. Then they practically stared at Paul asnif they couldn't believe he was alive and well before them. \"Paul?!\"nTerri's mother had gasped and then ran over to him. Terri's Dadnfollowed and hugged Paul to. \"Someone's got some explaining tondo here\", he grumbled. He glanced at Terri, then at Jensennwondering who he was suppose to be. Sonwhile Terri's Dad was cooking, Paul explained what and where henhad been and what he did do before Terri's boyfriend Jensen foundnhim. He explained faking his own death because of a debt he owed tonhis gang members. His gang eventually found him and made him pay upnby kidnapping him. \"I didn't want to tell any of you guys thisnbecause I didn't want you and Terri to have to worry. Plus, if Indidn't pay up, they would be after you guys\". said Paul. \"Stillnyou should have told us you were alive Paul. It's wrong to makenyour family think you've been dead a year\". said his Dad. \"But,n we understand why you did it, to protect us, and Terri\". They allnhugged Paul. Whenn Terri's Dad returned to the grill, Terri offered to help out innthe kitchen. She went to Jensen \"Go talk to Dad and Paul. Do somenbonding time with him. \"I'm going to help the others in thenkitchen\". \"Okay.nI'll see you when the food is ready\". he said winking at her. Jensennwalked over to where Terri's Dad stood at the Grill. \"You neednany help with that?\" he asked. \"So,nUh, your Terri's boyfriend the one who helped her find Paul?\" hernDad asked. Jensennnodded. \"That is correct, sir. Me and Terri are an item and we'renin love. And, I did help save and find Paul. My best friend Toddnhelped traced his email\". Terri'snDad just nodded and said \"I appreciate you finding Paul andnbringing him and Terri home to see us\". Afternintroducing Jensen and Denise to everyone, and; everyone finishednhugging Paul. Everyone sat down to a meal of Hotdogs and Hamburgers.nThe usual fourth of July celebration thought Jensen smiling. Henlooked over at Terri and discovered she was a lot happier than shenhad been in weeks.[Chapter 25] Afterneveryone got through eating, Terri's mom brought out some vanillancake with icing and yellow roses on top. \"It's Terri'snbirthday so we have to sing!\" Terrinbegan to blush bright red as everyone sang happy birthday. Todaynshe would turn 18. And begin her new life as a woman. Not a teennanymore. She made a wish that her and Jensen would always bentogether and happy, and then she blew out the candles. Next,nTerri opened her presents. She got a necklace from Denise with anDiamond Pendant, a book from Paul, and a cd of Three Doors Downnfrom Aunt Nina, and the big present from Mom and Dad was a bicycle!nIt was purple and shiny! Terri loved it. Jensenngot her a promise ring and a matching tennis bracelet. \"I havensomething else for you Terri. A song that I want to share with you\".nhe then began to sing to her while looking into her eyes and playingnhis guitar. BeautynQueen of only 18 Shenhad some trouble with herself Henwas always there to help her Shenalways belonged to someone else. Indrove for miles and miles and wound up at your door Inhad you so many times but somehow I want more Chorus: Indon't mind spending everyday out on your corner in the pouring rain Looknfor a girl with a broken smile Andnask her if she wants to stay awhile Shenwill be loved, she will be loved. AsnJensen sang the song, he looked into Terri's eyes. He hoped shenknew she would always be loved. Not only just by her family, but bynhim. He would always help her no matter what. No matter the cost. nNo matter how big her problems were and no matter how small. BothnTerri's Mom and Dad only smiled at each other. Both of them werenthinking the same thing: Jensen seems nice, a complete gentlemannTerri's mom's eyes said. Terri's Dad smiled in return Yeah, hisnmind thought. But he better not ever hurt her.[Chapter 26] Jensen had been so nervous about singing the song to Terri, he had wondered how she would react; her family to. He wanted them to see that he would do anything to keep her happy. When Jensen was done, Terri's family clapped. Not sure if they knew that's what Jensen wanted. Terri walked over and hugged Jensen and gave him a kiss. \"I loved that song, Jensen! And I love it when you sing it to me\". Jensen hugged her back and kissed her. The rest of the night they shot fireworks which was great. Then, they watched a movie with her parents and Paul. It was the perfect evening. 4 Weeks later...... In Los Angeles At Terri's School. The big day was here. Terri was excited yet nervous at the same time. This was the day that the Record Producer would determine their fate. By choosing the one best singer to wind a record deal with one of the most popular record companies..... Buena Vista Records aka Hollywood Records with Producers Andre Recke, and Jay Landers as the school visitors. The nearing singing contest had everyone under pressure that was going to participate. Terri practiced with Jensen who helped her with her songwriting, and helped her with her solos especially the parts where she had to sing high. \"When you sing, sing it from the bottom of your stomach. Sing loud to when your singing like your almost yelling; don't be afraid to let your voice carry out\". Jensen said. Terri nodded and continued singing. Meanwhile, Robin also practiced hard with her solo. She was glad that Jensen gave her another chance and the solo. Robin wanted to sing Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\". chosen by Jensen. Now it was around six that afternoon and everyone took an hour break. Jensen told everyone to relax, and go change if they wanted to. The performance would be in another hour. \"Good luck to each and everyone of you. And may the best singer win\". Then Class ended. Terri walked up to him after everyone left. Jensen looked at her and smiled. \"Terri! So are you nervous?\" he rubbed her shoulders then pulled slightly away. Terri nodded. \"Yeah, I am. My parents will be here and so will Paul, and you\". Jensen smiled. \"Don't worry, you'll do great and I know you'll win. They would be insane not to pick you:\". Jensen knew Terri had practiced the hardest out of all students and tried really hard for this competition. One Terri left Music Class, she went with Denise and they went to their Dorms to chill for an hour. Terri read a book for awhile, then she got ready for her performance. Terri wore a silver outfit that sparkled; silver leggings and a silver hat that wasn't too big. She wore her blond hair up and some of it hung loose but otherwise, it looked put on some makeup, then she remembered she forgot about her songs in the Classroom. She had to look at those one more time, Terri ran back to the room and got the music, and was fixing to leave when two girls cornered her back into the room. \"May I help you?\" asked Terri. She wondered who these girls were. Then she remembered they were Robin's friends. Amanda the brunette said \"Your not going to win the Record Deal, Robin is!\" then before Terri knew it, she was picked up by the girls and before she could fight back, she was locked into the closet Jensen had in his room. The girls locked the door, turned the light off, and laughed as they left. Terri began banging on the door crying for help. \"Hellllllllpppppp! anyone there?! Let me out!\" she kept banging. How could they do this?! Sorry for the long overdue update when you work on so many fics, it takes time to update them all! Hope everyone is still reading this story and keep the reviews coming. I know earlier their were some mistakes, but hopefully I'm getting better with each chapter.[Chapter 27] 7:oo pm The Show begins. The Show started around 7:00 pm. Everyone began filling the Auditorium at 6:30 to find their seats. All of the Soloists were prepared to sing and a good bit were going on before Terri. Vanessa, Robin, and Kevin waited patiently for their turn. \"Where's Terri? She's suppose to be here with us!\" said Vanessa. It was unlike Terri to be late for an event. Robin \"I have no idea. Terri is always late to these things. I'm sure she'll turn up\". Vanessa and Kevin looked at her. \"What? Okay I'll go look for her.\" with a huff, Robin took off down the hallway, looking for Terri. When she wasn't in her Dorm, she checked the classroom. That's when she heard banging and shouting coming from the closet. Without hesitation and because she was in a hurry to get back; Robin decided to open it to show Terri she was changing for the better. \"You opened the door, why?\" asked Terri not believing her eyes. What Jensen and Todd said, must be true. \"I really meant that I was sorry for bullying you around Terri. It was wrong of me. I just hope you can forgive me and that we can look past the past and just be friends\". said Robin. Terri nodded stepping out of the closet. \"Okay. Sure. We can be friends. Thanks for letting me out and your friends were behind this!\" Robin smiled. \"Don't mention it and about them, I'll deal with them later. Now go break a leg but, not good luck!\" then she and Terri walked back to the Auditorium together. Robin did an amazing job with the Celine Dion performance . She came onstage wearing a white silk gown and her hair reached her shoulders. The stage filled with fake smoke, and her voice carried the song beautifully. Vanessa and Kevin's duet \"The beat goes on\", originally done by Sonny and Cher, turned out to be a cute duet. Denise did a verson of her own \"Black Velvet\". Soon after another person sang, it was Terri's turn. She walked out smiling to the Audience. Terri sang \"How do I live\", better than Leann Rimes, and then after that began to sing \"Fly\". \"In a moment, everything can change feel the wind on your shoulder for a minute, all the world can wait let go of your yesterday can you hear it calling? can you feel it in your soul can you trust this longing and take control?\" \"Fly, open up a part of you that wants to hideaway. You can change, forget about your reasons why you can't in life, and start to try, cause it's your time to Fly\". Jensen loved hearing Terri's voice. She was so awesome! He could tell her family was also impressed and proud and so was Paul. Paul looked real proud. Paul was happy thay people were finally noticing Terri's the video had been worth it. Now people saw what Paul saw in his sister. A talented Girl.[Chapter 28] Terri finished up the song letting her voice carry out as Jensen taught her. When Terri looked his way, Jensen was smiling. And she could tell she made him proud. Terri's song finished and everyone clapped and cheered loudly. She bowed and thanked them, and went over to sit down next to her other singing classmates. The Dean walked up to the stage soon after and said: \"That was our talanted bunch from our finest school\". Everyone kept clapping. Principal Gantry continued: \"Our Record Producers have decided which student gets the record deal\". he got out a envelope and unfolded it reading the piece of paper \"The student who gets the Record Deal is.....\" The crowd went silent. Terri exchanged a look with Jensen and just smiled then turned back to face the Principal. Jensen silently prayed that Terri got the Record Deal. Both her and Terri had been practicing for most of the summer on this .She deserved something great to happen to her after all she's been through. The Principal smiled as he looked at the name. \"The winner of the Record Deal is ..... Terri Fletcher!\" a roar of applause sounded throughout the Auditorium. Terri's Mom and Aunt were in tears of happiness. And her Dad and Paul were smiling and Jensen was super-excited. He knew she would win! Terri was in shock and nearly gasped when her name was anounced. Was she dreaming this? She expected Robin to win, not her! This was all so unbelievable. The Principal smiled at her. \"Terri, could you please come up onstage and meet with the Record Producers?\" Terri nodded and walked onstage. Tears of happiness had started to form in her eyes and she joined the Principal onstage. Terri tried wiping her tears with one hand and took the mic in the other. As people kept clapping,Terri smiled and began to speak \"This is such a shock to me, winning this Record Deal. I'm so gratefull to have won it words cannot express my gratitude. I want to personally thank Jensen Ackles my teacher for helping me to achieve this goal. Without his help, I don't think I would have won. I also want to also thank my Family and Paul who was recently found alive for their support. And I want to thank Denise for being the best friend ever when times got tough\". Mr. Gantry took the mic back. \"It looks like Terri is overwhelmed by winning. But I think she deserves the Record Deal what do you think?\" The crowd roared and Terri's family, her Mom, Her Aunt, Her Dad, and Paul , Jensen and Denise walked up the stage to join her. Terri's family gave her hugs, then Jensen hugged her. \"I knew you could win!\" he said giving her a wink. Then Denise gave her a hug. Robin was the last one to congratulate her with encouraging words and surprisingly a hug as well shocking her friends. Mr. Gantry spoke again. \"As our winner, can you sing us another song, Terri? Jensen said you had another one you had been practicing on\". Mr. Gantry knew she had another one. Terri nodded. \"Yeah sure. We can do another one!\" Mr. Gantry \"Great then afterwards, you can meet the Producers\". Terri nodded again and Mr. Gantry left the stage. Only her family, Jensen and close friends remained with her onstage. Fast rock music started up and Terri began to sing Metamorphosis a song she co-wrote with Denise , Kevin and Vanessa. Terri smiled as she began to sing her tears now gone. \"I've been so wrapped up in my warm cocoon But something's happenning, things are changing soon I'm pushing the edge, feeling it crack and once I get out, there's no turning back Watching the Butterfly go towards the sun I wonder what I'll become As Terri sang she was impressed out it turned out. It decribed everything about her, inside and out and everything she was going through. She was no longer a little girl anymore. But a growing , changing into a more confident woman. \"Metamorphosis whatever this is whatever I'm going through come on give me a kiss come on, I insist I'll be something new Metamorphosis\". As she sang those lines, Terri and Jensen exchanged another look. When she sang those lines, they were about him and her and he winked at her smiling thinking if only I could kiss you now, he thought.[Chapter 29] One Year Later....
