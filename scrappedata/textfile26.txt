Then she realized that she was in the aquarium! I must have sleep walked or something...Oh. Wait. I was supposed to stay the night at the aquarium to keep an eye on Winter because last week she wasn't feeling well. Well, Winter is fine. I wonder when Sawyer will be here because he always has fun ideas. Today is our off day so we can do whatever. But usually we go up to the crows nest and talk. Hazel thought to herself. \"Good Morning Hazel!\" Phoebe said with a smile. \"Good Morning Phoebe! Why are you here so early?\" She asked. \"Uhhh...Hazel? Have you checked the time? It's 9:30.\" \"What?! Oh no! I was supposed to tell my dad about how Winter was last night an hour ago! Gotta go Phoebe!\" And with that, Hazel grabbed her stuff and ran home. \"Good morning honey,\" Lorraine said as Sawyer entered the room. \"Breakfast is on the table.\" \"Thanks mom. I am going to the aquarium today.\" Sawyer said. \"But today is your off day Sawyer.\" Lorraine started, \"You should just relax and maybe watch a movie or something. After all, its only been a week since you got back from the SEA semester.\"\"I just want to see Winter, Hope and Hazel.\" Sawyer started, \"I really missed them when I was away.\" \"Well I have to go to the store today so I won't be back for a few hours. Do you want me to pick you up after I am done?\" Lorraine asked. \"It's ok Mom. I am going to ride my bike to the aquarium.\" \"Okay Sweetie.\" Sawyer quickly finished his breakfast, got dressed, and headed for the aquarium. Hazel I hope that Sawyer comes soon. I haven't had any quality time with him since he got back from his 3 month long SEA semester. Then I heard someone say \"Hey Sawyer!\" It was my dad. Then Winter made her tweety bird noise. Sawyer walked over and said hi to Winter, Hope, and I. \"Hey Hazel!\" \"Hi Sawyer!\" I replied. Then we asked my dad if we could swim with Winter and Hope, and he said yes! Winter and Hope got super excited when we got on the platform. Winter pulled Sawyer in, of course. And I jumped in after them. After we swam for a few minutes with Winter and Hope, I saw someone...It was Suzie. Sawyer Hazel and I were splashing each other with water and laughing until Hazel stopped and her smile faded. \"Hi Sawyer!\" It was Suzie. \"Oh hey Suzie! It's a surprise to see you here.\" I said. \"Oh y'know I was just passing by and wanted to say hi\" Suzie said. \"Oh, Hi Hazel.\" Suzie said. \"Hi Suzie.\" Hazel said. \"Soooo? How was the SEA semester? It sounded so fun.\" Suzie gushed. \"It was really fun. I got to see so many animals and even got to see wild dolphins!\" \"That sounds so awesome!\" Suzie said with a smile. \"Sawyer you wanna ride our bikes to my house? I made cherry popsicles! Oh. And of course you are invited too...Hazel.\" Suzie said. Hazel \"No thanks I think I'll stay here...with Winter and Hope.\" Hazel said. \"Ok Hazel. I'll see you later!\" Sawyer said as he dried off, grabbed his things and headed out the door with Suzie. \"Bye.\" I said sadly. After they left, I swam with Winter and Hope for a few more minutes. But it wasn't as fun without Sawyer. Winter tweeted sadly as if she knew my feelings. I just wanted some time with Sawyer. But Suzie had to come in and take it away. I never liked Suzie. She obviously tries to come between Sawer and I and purposely leave me out of whatever she is doing. I swam for a few more minutes then I dried off and went to the crows nest and looked at the sunset. Sawyer As Suzie got the popsicles from the freezer I sat on her deck thinking. I felt kinda bad ditching Hazel knowing that she can't ride her bike. Her dad never had time to teach her because he was always busy with the aquarium. Then Suzie came out with the popsicles. \"You still thinking about Hazel?\" Suzie asked. \"Yeah...\" I said sadly. Suzie put her hand on my shoulder. \"It's ok. I'm here. Remember?\" Then we laughed. But it was kind of awkward because the only other girl my age I've shared a laugh with was Hazel. Authors note: Hey Guys! So, looks like Hazel wants time with Sawyer but Suzie keeps interrupting them. It looks like Sawyer is feeling a little uncomfortable with Suzie because the only other girl-friend he has had is Hazel. Stay tuned for Part 2!

Hazel sat nearby, stroking Hope. \"I know you don't like this part of the day, girls, but it is time for us to get going,\" Sawyer whispered. Winter responded with her tweety bird sound. \"Sometimes I feel like they understand us.\" Hazel joked. Sawyer chuckled. It had been a month since he returned from the SEA Semester. Hope's training was coming along great, despite being new. \"You know,\" Hazel continued. \"It's nice of your mom to invite us over to dinner.\" By \"us\" she meant herself, Clay, and her grandfather. \"Yea,\" Sawyer replied. \"It'll be great. No to mention the fact you'll be spending the night.\" \"Yea.\" \"Hey, guys. You ready?\" Sawyer and Hazel spun around to see Clay. \"Yeah. We'll be right with you, Dad,\" Hazel responded. The two teens bade their goodbyes to the dolphins and crawled out of the pool. A few minutes went by and there was some clicking sounds, indicated they turned off the live webcams for the night. Then the CMA was dark and quiet. Winter swam over to the submerged platform and laid there as if waiting for something. Hope swam to the edge of the platform. \"You've been doing that for the past few days. Every day, at the same time. What is it you are even doing?\" Hope asked. \"Waiting,\" Winter responded, not taking her gaze away from the ceiling. \"For what?\" \"You'll see,\" Hopefully she added silently to herself. Where IS that pelican? I haven't seen him for quite some ti- Her thoughts were interrupted by the sound of flapping wings. Rufus flew over the edge of the pool where Winter sat. \"Well, you took your time!\" she snapped. \"A thousand apologies, boss,\" the pelican responded. \"I was checking in on the turtle in Rehab,\" \"How many times do we have to go through this? Don't. Call. Me. BOSS! \" Winter yelled. \"Whatever you say, boss,\" Winter sighed. Crazy bird. She decided to get straight to the point. \"What's the staff report?\" \"All of them are gone, except for Kat, who has the night shift at Rehab,\" Rufus happily reported. \"Okay. And you talked to Special K and Waldo?\" \"Yes,\" Special K was the name of the turtle and Waldo was the name of the stingray. They were both in Rehab. \"They are aware of the plan?\" \"What plan?\" Hope asked. Winter and Rufus ignored her. \"Yes, and they figured out how to get Kat to leave them,\" Rufus explained. \"Good. Did you have a word with Cooper and Walle?\" Cooper and Walle were the names of the Otters that lived at Otter Oasis. \"Not yet but I will in a sec,\" \"Did you drag those adorable otters into this 'plan' of yours? What's going on?\" Winter and Rufus continued to ignore her. The pelican stretched his wings and flew over to Otter Oasis. Then he bent over and started murmuring to the otters. \"Hey,\" Hope called.\"Do you want to tell me what this is all about?\" \"Patience, Hope. You'll see,\" \"Why are you being so secretive?\" Winter sighed, but it wasn't out of annoyance, Hope noticed. It was out of grief. \"Back when I first came to the Winter Zone, it was just me and Panama and she did this sort of thing to me as well. Talking secretly with Rufus, talking about the otters. It was just Cooper back then. But he did his job efficiently, despite being paralyzed in his hind legs,\" \"What was his job?\" Hope asked. \"If the plan is a success, you will see. If I tell you it would ruin the surprise,\" Winter explained, as Cooper and Walle scampered down to the gift shop with Rufus at their tails. \"How'd they get out?!\" Hope gasped. \"Rufus,\" \"Oh,\" \"Anyway, when Panama acted all secretly the first time, the plan was a success. And boy, was I surprised,\" Winter smiled, but her eyes were clouded with grief. \"I miss her,\" Winter sighed. \"If Panama really was as awesome as you make her sound, then yes, I'd miss her, too,\" Their conversation was interrupted by the sound of flapping wings. Rufus was back. Winter whispered something to him that Hope couldn't here. Rufus was slowly nodding and saying \"Sounds good\" and \"Okay, cool.\" Hope wished she was in on the conversation. Then Rufus whispered something to Winter and it was her turn to nod. When they finished, Rufus flew off again. \"What was that about?\" Hope asked. \"Rufus has another assignment for the otters. Also, Kat left her post because Special K and Waldo 'went to sleep' for the night,\" Winter explained. \"Out plan can swing into action now,\" As if on cue, Cooper and Walle showed up, holding some buckets with bottles of fish shakes in them. They set them on the feeding platform and scuttled off. Rufus showed up carrying a turtle on his back. Rufus carefully set the turtle into the pool, then flew off again. Winter and Hope swam over to greet it. \"You must be Special K,\" Winter said. \"Is that what the humans call me? I've heard them say that quite a few times while tending to my cuts from the net, but I didn't know that's what they call me,\" the turtle said. \"Well, you'll only be here temporarily. If you were a permanent resident, then you'd learn some English,\" Hope explained. \"Then you must be the famous Winter and Hope!\" Special K cried. \"Yep, that's us,\" Winter confirmed. Rufus flapped back over. This time, he was holding a stingray. Once again, Rufus landed in the pool to let his passenger down. Once the ray was in the water, Rufus flapped to the side of the pool. \"Next time,\" the ray said. \"I do NOT want to come here by bird!\" \"Well, it's either travel by bird or not come at all,\" Winter pointed out. \"True,\" the ray said. Hope tried to change the subject. \"Waldo, right?\" \"That's what the humans have been calling me,\" Waldo responded. At that moment, Walle and Cooper came back. Walle was holding a little disco ball and Cooper was holding a cassette. On his back, sat a radio. They raced to the walls and plugged in the disco ball and radio. Copper slid in the cassette. Catchy disco music filled the air. Beams of light shone everywhere. Cooper and Walle slid into the pool. \"We all ready?\" Cooper asked. \"Let's see,\" Winter said, looking around. \"Music, beverages, and food, Disco ball, everyone attending, enough room to get our groove on, yep! That's everything! Let's party while we still have moonlight!\" They didn't need to be told twice. Everyone got into the middle of the pool and started dancing in their own way. Every now and then, someone went to the side of the pool to get a fish or fish shake. Hope swan over to Winter. \"Is this the 'surprise' you told me about earlier?\" she asked. \"Yep! We don't do it often because we can almost never get away with it. So it's fun to do it when given the chance! And tonight was a good night to do so,\" Winter explained. They partied all night like it was their very first time. The next morning everyone was back in their pools where they belong. Rufus was at his usual perch by Rehab. All the stuff was put away. Everyone pretended like nothing had happened. The aquarium was going to open in two hours and the employees were starting to arrive. \"Hey, Winter. Hope,\" Sawyer said when he showed up. \"Did you have a good night?\" \"Hey...\" said Hazel. \"Don't they look kind of tired?\" It was true. They were both floating around aimlessly in the pool, eyes droopy. \"Yeah. Maybe they should get more sleep? I don't see what they would do that would make them so tired, though,\" Sawyer commented. Winter and Hope smiled at each other and winked. The End ","Summary":" Sawyer smiled as he stroked Winter's head.

While most girls her age were immersed in the inner workings of Gossip Girl and Pretty Little Liars , Hazel sought refuge in The Partridge Family and The Brady Bunch and Hazel's absolute favorite, I Love Lucy . Anything pre-21st century and Hazel was there. The superficiality of being obsessed with make up and clothes and cheerleaders simply didn't appeal to her. And Sawyer understood that. But it didn't make it any less fun to tease her about her ancient TV choices, and how she couldn't enjoy Netflix the way any normal teenager could. Hazel simply rolled with it, occasionally whacking him on the shoulder and laughing. She'd tell him that he'd love the classics if he just gave them a chance. Just give them a chance. It took about four days for the issue to arise. Sawyer kissed Hazel, they attempted to hide the fact that the vibe between them had changed, failed miserably, got teased incessantly and went about life as normally as possible. But that was the issue. Things just went back to normal. And every time Hazel would glance at Sawyer, her heart would skip a beat, and every time he smiled, she grinned, and every time he came to talk to her, she hoped to God that he'd ask her out and every time he came over, he never did. And it was killing her. So Hazel decided that she, a strong and independent spitfire, albeit tiny spitfire, would ask the damn boy out herself. They were putting away Winter and Hope's toys when she brought it up, \"Hey, Sawyer, I have a question.\" Lame, you idiot , she thought He glanced at her from behind a shelf, \"What's up?\" Hazel picked at a hangnail and took a breath, forcing herself to look at the waiting face of her best friend, \"Well, I was wondering, you know, if you wanted to hang out sometime.\" She flushed a little and glanced away, \"Aren't we hanging out right now?\" Boys. They are thicker than concrete, I swear to the Lord. She rolled her eyes a little bit and grinned, pausing to put the rubber duck ring back on the shelf, \"I meant, like a date sort of thing. Like a movie. My dad gave me Frankenstein on DVD. I thought we could watch it, even though it's a weird old movie. You did kiss me, after all. I just thought it might be nice and –\" She broke off. Sawyer's smile had slipped off pale and freckled face, and he shook his head almost imperceptibly. Hazel's heart and stomach dropped and settled somewhere roughly around her knees, \"Why are you shaking your head? What's wrong?\" Sawyer rubbed his face with one hand and sighed, \"Hazel, I've been thinking about that. I- I shouldn't have kissed you. It was a mistake.\" Hazel's face flushed red and her stomach boiled slightly, \"A mistake?\" she said, slightly shrilly, \"It was a mistake? Was it a mistake when you told me you wanted something more?\" Her eyes narrowed slightly and she cursed the fact that she had to look up at Sawyer. She was much less intimidating when she had to crane up at him. \"Yes. It was a mistake, Hazel. I work for your dad. We see each other every day. He's practically a father to me. Even if we could go out without it being weird here, what happens when we break up? I don't want to take that chance! This place, your dad, you mean too much to me!\" Sawyer's tone was desperate now. Hazel scoffed a little bit, \"Do you remember what I said the last time you laughed at my latest 'old TV' reference?\" Sawyer's confusion was visible, \"No.\" Hazel grinned humorlessly, \"I said you should give it a chance. Maybe you'll find something incredible.\" She sighed, \"Maybe you should give this a chance. Maybe we'll find something amazing.\" Sawyer opened his mouth, stopped, closed it. He stared at Hazel, \"I just can't, Hazel. I'm sorry. Forget it ever happened.\" Tears stung Hazel's eyes and she spun on her heel, \"Fine. Consider it forgotten.\" She marched away, not even pausing when he called after her, not even pausing when she heard the crash of Sawyer kicking over a box of Winter's things. Sawyer Nelson was furious at himself. He stalked to his room as soon as he got home, and locked the door, something he never does. Pacing back in forth, he muttered \"Stupid, stupid, stupid\" to himself over and over again, grabbing his hair. Irritated, he flopped back on his bed, and his head hit a plastic case. He reached above his head. It was a box set of I Love Lucy. Hazel had given it to him for his birthday as a joke. He smiled at it and lay there for a minute. He grabbed his laptop, and Sawyer watched three and a half seasons of Hazel's favorite TV show that night. He was nearly drifting off to sleep when the beautiful Lucille Ball laughed, \"I'd rather regret the things I have done than the things I haven't.\" Sawyer sat up in bed and stared at the computer screen. He had to talk to Hazel. He checked the time. It was 2:12 in the morning. He knew he should wait, but he also knew he couldn't. Hazel nearly didn't pick up her cell phone. She was too ticked about being woken up at such an ungodly hour. But she saw Sawyer's picture light up the screen, and knew something had to be up. So she answered, \"What do you want at this hour, Sawyer?\" \"I need to talk to you.\" Hazel sighed slightly, \"So talk.\" \"No, in person.\" His voice had taken on a begging tone, \"Please.\" \"Sawyer, it is 2 in the morning. I am not meeting you anywhere. This can wait until the morning.\" Hazel rolled back over, about to hang up, \" No, Hazel, please. I'm outside.\" Hazel closed her eyes and tipped her head back in exasperation, \"Ugh alright fine.\" She wrapped herself in a long sweater and tiptoed out to the front of the houseboat. Sure enough, a pajama-clad Sawyer was standing on the sidewalk. \"Sawyer, what the hell-\" \"I don't regret it,\" Sawyer blurted out, \"I don't regret kissing you. It wasn't a mistake and I'm sorry.\" Hazel wrapped her arms around herself and narrowed her eyes at him, \"What changed?\" Sawyer laughed a little bit, \"I'd rather regret the things I've done than the things I haven't.\" Hazel tilted her head to the side and smiled, \"The only things helping your case right now are that I know for a fact that you didn't want that Lucy set until tonight and that you appear to have shaken your irritating albeit slightly endearing awkward persona, at least for now.\" Sawyer tried again, \"Look, I said I was scared, and I am and I don't want to lose what we have but Hazel? I really care about you and I think I'd regret not taking this chance.\" He hopped down onto the deck. They were closer now, \"What makes you think I still want that?\" Hazel's face was a mask, unreadable. \"Because you want to find something amazing, and you think that you can find something amazing here,\" Sawyer grinned. Hazel became very aware of how close they were, and how very confident and rather un-Sawyer-ish this version of her best friend was being, \"Have you slept at all tonight?\" \"Nope.\" Hazel threw a hand up in exasperation, \"Alright, you idiot. You win. I accept your apology. Now go home, Sawyer. A lack of sleep makes you weird. We can discuss your proposition when you're rested and acting less like a movie.\" Sawyer grinned. \"Night, Sawyer.\" She turned to go, Sawyer shook his head and smiled, \"Hey, Hazel!\" She turned. \"Shut up and kiss me, would you?\" Hazel was only too happy to oblige.

I am updating Subtlety, due to popular demand. However, writers block as resulted in me being unable to write a second chapter, so as it's Valentine's Day and I'm a member of the Lonely Hearts Club, here's another little private moment for our two favorite dolphin enthusiasts. I present to you Careful Hazel Haskett and Sawyer Nelson had a sort of happening relationship. It wasn't that it was spontaneous or beautifully romantic or anything. In fact, if you even said the word romantic, they'd firmly shut you down. They were, after all, simply friends. Friends who really wanted to be not friends. But they'd deny that, too. No, they're relationship was happening because people were always happening upon their private moments. The Valentine's Day after Sawyer returned home was no different. For whatever unintelligent reason, Clay had left Sawyer and Hazel at the aquarium alone. Clearwater needed more footage of the dolphins edited together in a new short film for the exhibit, and he commandeered Sawyer and Hazel. His excuse for skipping out on it was that he had Valentine's Day plans with his new girlfriend, Marie, who Hazel disliked wholeheartedly. So here they were, sitting by the dolphin pool, leaned up against a pillar, their legs dangerously close to touching as they began to cut together footage from the past two weeks. Winter had managed to crack a joint on her prosthetic tail crossing into Hope's pool by accident and so Dr. McCarthy had fitted her for a new one earlier than expected. This was the footage they were editing. For the first hour or so, they made idle chatter, occasionally bickering about which clip went where, and why that audio was stupid, and they should use this section instead, or just record over it. It wasn't until it had gotten past ten that their conversation shifted when Hazel suddenly paused, \"Do you believe in true love, Sawyer?\" Sawyer did a double take. He of all people, someone who was grappling with bizarre dreams and feelings for the girl sitting three inches from him, was not equipped to have a conversation with Hazel about a date, let alone love. Still he turned and cocked his head slightly so that he could see her face, \"Yeah. Yeah, I do. Why?\" \"Because I don't. I hate it.\" Hazel, bright, quirky, happy Hazel, did not hate. Especially something as romanticized as love. The light of the computer illuminated her freckled face, and Hazel kept her eyes fixed on the screen as she took a breath and answered, \"Because it's stupid. You always wind up hurt, or alone.\" Sawyer narrowed his eyes, confused, \"Is this because it's Valentine's Day?\" Hazel shrugged, \"I guess I've just been thinking about love a lot in the past two months. I mean, look how sad my dad was for years. He loved my mom, and when she died, he was alone and sad and depressed. And when Marie leaves my dad, he's going to be heartbroken again. Wasn't your mom hurt when your dad left?\" Sawyer's stomach dropped. They didn't talk about his dad walking out on him. It was sort of an untouched area. He struggled to find words, \"I-I m-mean, yeah. She was devastated. We both were. He was my father. He walked out on us.\" Sawyer's blood began to boil a little and his voice rose slightly, \"He just walked out of my life, like I wasn't his son and I didn't mean anything to him. He broke my mother's heart. He left me to try and figure out how to grow up by myself. It didn't hurt. It killed when he walked out. My mother thought he was her one true love. But that doesn't mean true love sucks or doesn't exist, Hazel. There are different kinds of love.\" You are treading dangerously close to those dreams, Sawyer Nelson, and you are not having this conversation with this girl right now, his mind reminded him, rather forcefully. Hazel had closed the computer and was staring at him now, \"Yeah, I know that love exists. You love Winter. I love my dad. Phoebe loves the penguins. But true love? No way.\" Sawyer was truly confused now. Where did this all come from and why was she talking to him about this? They weren't in love or anything. \"Hazel, where is this all coming from? You don't hate and I specifically remember you and Phoebe having a conversation about how adorable Peter-\" \"Peeta\" Hazel interjected \"-Peeta, was in that Hunger Games movie, and how romantic his actions were and how beautiful true love was,\" Sawyer's voice took on a teasing tone and he grinned at Hazel, who cracked a small smile, \"I don't know.\" She gave a small sigh, \"I guess if I believe true love doesn't exist, it'll mean Marie will be gone soon, and I can have my dad back.\" Realization dawned on Sawyer \"Hazel, do you think Marie is going to replace you?\" Hazel shook her head aggressively, paused, and gave an almost imperceptible nod. Sawyer blinked and replied emphatically, \"Hazel, you're always going to be your dad's number one. I promise. You were there before Marie, and you'll be there after she is gone. I'll tell you that however many times it takes you to believe me. He's not replacing you and he won't forget you.\" Hazel turned towards the dolphin pool again, \"You think?\" Sawyer nodded, \"If I'm wrong, I'll surrender my SEA medallion to Roofus.\" Sawyer had received a small silver disc with the SEA logo and motto on the surface. He wore it on a chain around his neck, and Roofus had taken to making poor attempts at stealing it. Sawyer and Hazel had beaten the pelican off of Sawyer's back innumerable times. Hazel giggled, \"That would be a sight to see.\" Sawyer laughed, too, \"It would, wouldn't it?\" They turned back to the computer screen and stared at the finished product in silence for a second. Hazel spoke first,, \"I vote we watch it, and if we like it, we go home.\" Sawyer nodded. He tapped the space bar and the words \"Prosthetic Improbability: Saving Winter's Tail\" came across the screen. Hazel set her head on Sawyer's shoulder and he tensed slightly. This is new. Don't mess it up. Relax, you idiot! Sawyer forced his shoulder to relax. The twenty minute film finished, but when Sawyer glanced down at Hazel, she was sound asleep on his shoulder. He grinned and leaned his head back. Surely, closing his eyes for a few minutes wouldn't hurt. After all, he was exhausted. Sawyer awoke suddenly, and was momentarily disoriented. The sun was just beginning to crest over the wall into the aquarium. Hazel was gone, and Phoebe and Anna, another dolphin trainer, were bustling about, getting the breakfasts ready. He stood and stretched, meaning to go home and shower and have some breakfast before coming back for Winter's Sunday session. He passed Phoebe on his way out, \"Morning, Sawyer. Sleep well?\" Her voice was unnaturally cheery, and her wicked grin made Sawyer slightly nervous. \"Oh ha ha ha. I'll see you in a few hours.\" He got to his bike and unlocked it. He pulled out his phone. He had two texts. One was from his mother, asking if he'd be home for breakfast. He replied yes to that and checked the other one. It was a picture from Anna. He was sound asleep against the pillar, the closed laptop balanced on one leg. Hazel was next to him, also fast asleep. Her head was resting on his shoulder and his ear was in her hair. Their hands were just touching. They looked peaceful. He read the accompanying message You two kids need to be more careful :) xx Anna Sawyer flushed bright red, and checked to make sure no one was around. He fired back Get. Rid. Of. It. He simply received a ;) in return. Sawyer wouldn't tell anyone this, but before deleting the texts, he saved the picture with a small smile. Maybe Valentine's Day was a holiday for girls and sappy romantics, but he certainly enjoyed his. ","Summary":" AUTHOR'S NOTE: Ok, so I lied. I am updating Subtlety, due to popular demand.

You either confront the problem head on, or you run for the hills and hide from it. Hazel Haskett had always had the flight instinct. Not much upset her, but when she was hurt, she ran. So when Sawyer walked into the back area at Clearwater and saw Hazel tear in the other direction as her father called after her before throwing his hands in the air in exasperation, he knew that something bad had happened. And he panicked. Letting his backpack fall to the floor, he quickly wove his way through volunteers, keeping his eyes on Clay, who was walking in the other direction, \"Clay!\" He shouted across the deck, but the doctor didn't turn. Sawyer increased his pace, \"Clay!\" This time he turned and a look of exhaustion and defeat was clearly painted on his face. Sawyer's stomach dropped a little more, \"What happened? Is Winter ok? Did Hope flip again? Did-\" Clay cut off the stream of panicked questions with a hand. \"No, Hope and Winter are fine. The animals are all fine,\" Clay sighed, \"I told Hazel that I'm getting married.\" Sawyer took a step back, \"I- you're- what?\" In the three months that Sawyer had been away at SEA Semester, Clay had apparently fallen in love, which was great for everyone. Everyone except Hazel. And now, almost two months after his arrival home, Sawyer was rather taken aback at sudden proposal. He had no objections. He was happy for Clay, of course. The marine vet was the happiest Sawyer had ever seen him, and this was the man who'd saved a dolphin with no tail and an entire marine hospital with it. But Hazel hadn't taken well to the new woman and she'd become withdrawn, upset and irritable, jumping down Sawyer's and everyone else's throat about everything. Sawyer blinked and looked back at Clay, with whom he was now almost eye level to, \"You're getting married?\" He nodded and Sawyer sighed, \"So that's what Hazel ran for,\" more to himself than anyone else. He vaguely heard Clay ask him to go talk to her, but Sawyer was already walking in the direction of the crow's nest. When Hazel ran, there was no question as to where she'd be. He heard sniffing and quiet sobs before he saw her. He looked up from the roof of the quirky little houseboat and sure enough, he could see the back of Hazel's blonde head and purple wet-shirt. He climbed the salt-sprayed rope latter and poked his head up above the platform, \"Hey, can I come up?\" Hazel looked up, face wet and eyes red. There was no hiding that she'd been crying, but she wiped her eyes and tried to dry her face anyways, \"Yeah, come in or up or whatever.\" Sawyer pulled himself up the last few rungs and debated sitting right next to Hazel, before settling down a safe distance from her, \"You doing ok?\" Hazel nodded, wiping her eyes again before looking away. Sawyer tried again, \"Clay told me about what happened.\" Hazel scoffed, \"What happened? What happened is that he managed to fall in love in five months and propose to a woman he barely knows. Hasn't he forgotten Mom? The woman he built this hospital with? The woman he had me with?\" The end of her sentence broke and a sob wracked her frame. Sawyer jumped up and without thinking, wrapped his arms around her. She turned her face into his shoulder. Normally, the slightly socially inept and awkward teenager would have flinched at the reciprocation of contact from his best friend, of all people. Someone who he'd made a concerted effort to make sure that there was no question as to their friendship, despite some teasing from the older dolphin handlers; Phoebe had been especially brutal. But as the first friend he'd had in years soaked the shoulder of his Clearwater Staff wet-shirt, he just squeezed her a little and let her cry. \"Look, I don't know a lot about dads, but I know your dad. It's been six years. He's done his grieving. And I don't know anything about girls, but I know that seeing my mom move on was hard at first. But she's happy now. No, she's not married or engaged, but she's happy. And Hazel, I know you. And I know that you want to see your dad happy. He's not replacing you and he's not replacing your mom. My mom says he's just filling a void that's been empty for a long time.\" Sawyer sighed a little, and the heave of his shoulders lifted Hazel's face, \"Everyone's leaving and moving on. Even you left, and you promised Winter you wouldn't leave her. Dad is the only one who was the same and now he has his new girlfriend to marry. He doesn't need me, except as staff at the aquarium.\" Even you left. The words repeated over in his head. He'd had the time of his life at SEA Semester. He'd missed everyone at CMA, especially Winter and Hazel, but he'd gotten to spend three months doing what he loved. He pushed the words aside and sat back, removing his arm from Hazel's shoulders, \"I left, yes. But I came back. Your dad is getting married, yes. But he needs you. You're always going to be the most important thing in his life. And I-\" Sawyer trailed off, too embarrassed to finish. Hazel, who had hugged her knees to her chest, looked over at him and sniffed, \"You what?\" Sawyer wished he'd just kept his mouth shut and could feel red creeping up the back of his neck, but he still said, \"I said I'm here for you. I promise.\" Hazel smiled at him and he flushed a little again. They were silent for a minute or two, the space between them filled with the Florida sea breeze and calls of Rufus, before Hazel spoke, \"Hey, Sawyer?\" He looked away from the construction that was winding down, \"Yeah?\" \"When did you become such a dork?\" Sawyer stared at her, \"Right around the same time you became such a drama queen.\" Their laughter could be heard from the deck of the dolphin pools, and Clay smiled a little, relieved. Sawyer stood, and offered his hand to Hazel. She took it and he pulled her up before they made their way back to the aquarium, not before stopping to make sure Rufus hadn't discovered another turtle, and was truly just being insane.

Hazel: *Face-palms* (Winter's POV) \"Hey, Winter, how're you doing today?\" Sawyer asked as he crouched next to Hope and I's pool. A lot had changed in the last few months. Hope had settled in comfortably, Sawyer had returned from his... Scholarship thing. I never pay attention when he talks about stuff like that. I whistled at Sawyer happily as Hope swam up next to me. Sawyer smiled and started to squirt water into Hope's open jaw with the water gun like she loves. I noticed Hazel tiptoe up behind Sawyer, and inwardly laughed. \"SAWYER!\" She screamed in his ear. Sawyer jumped and yelped, falling into the pool. I chirped at him mockingly, and Hope tweeted nervously, not yet fully accustomed to the teen's unusual way of playing. Sawyer swam to the surface, sputtering. Hazel and I laughed at him, but Hope nudged him worriedly. I shook my head with a sigh. When was she going to learn that falling in the pool usually didn't hurt anyone? Sawyer patted Hope reassuringly and glared teasingly at Hazel, who was still laughing. As Sawyer got up out of the pool, I swam over to Hope. \"When is he going to learn she does that for attention?\" Hope sighed. I looked at her, confused. \"What do you mean?\" Hope rolled her eyes. \"Well obviously Hazel likes Sawyer. And I think Sawyer likes her too, they just don't realize it. The idiots.\" I snorted. Hope had always been a loveturtle (that's what we call lovebirds, the sea turtles, for some reason, are always especially romantic), but that was just ridiculous. \"It's true!\" Hope persisted. \"I'll show you!\" She swam up to the platform the teens were on and whistled. Hazel turned and smiled at Hope. \"What is it, Hope?\" She asked gently as she crouched and reached her hand out. Hope smirked in a way only a dolphin can smirk, and pulled Hazel's outstretched arm. Hazel fell into the pool with a splash. \"Hazel!\" Sawyer gasped, and jumped in after her. Hope came swimming back to me laughing. I shook my head. \"So I see you now know they don't get hurt when jumping in the pool.\" I said with a grin. \"See, Sawyer jumped in after her, though he knew she's a great swimmer! That proves it!\" Hope said excitedly, ignoring my comment. I nodded thoughtfully. \"I suppose. They do show unusual signs of affection... Why are humans always so complicated? Dolphins are very straightforward. And they say they're smarter than us!\" I shook my head in exasperation. Hazel and Sawyer resurfaced, coughing, and I twittered at them in humor. They rolled their eyes and climbed back out of the pool, grabbing some towels to dry off. \"So what do we do?\" Hope asked excitedly. I frowned. \"Uh... What do you mean?\" She sighed and shook her head. \"Honestly, Winnie, I thought you were smarter than this. We need to get them together!\" My eyes widened. \"What?! I am not interfering with any humans' love lives.\" Hope huffed. \"Fine. I'll do it myself.\" She swam away to, I assume, plot a plan to get the two idiotic teens together. Hope being a technical teen herself, she would have been the girliest girl for miles, if she was an actual human girl. \"Winter! Hope!\" Hazel called as she sat by the pool. I watched as Hope zoomed towards her and sighed, wondering what her devious plan is. I swam more slowly up to Hazel and Hope. Hope smirked at me evilly. I blinked and narrowed my eyes, wondering what she was up to. \"Hey, Hazel!\" Sawyer called, raising his hand as he walked towards Hazel. Hazel turned and smiled. \"Hey, Sawyer. What is it?\" She looked mildly curious. As they continued to talk, Hope swam up next to me. \"Winnie, I'm gonna need your help...\" And she told me her plan. I sighed but reluctantly agreed. Again, only two chapters. I'm not entirely sure what Hope's plan is yet, though *smiles sheepishly*. Sorry.

Introduction: Rain, pouring rain, coming down in sheets so dense that there was almost no visibility, soaked the areas around and in Tampa, Florida. These areas included the thin, thread bear clothes of the small boy running along the beaches of Clearwater, desperately trying to get to the place he called home. A loud crack of thunder sounded just as he dove through the entrance of cave in the rocky, jungle like parts of these beaches. Gasping for breath he remained kneeling just inside the mouth of the cave. His back, facing the outside and the hollowing wind, began to tense as the cold air ripped through his already soaked shirt and penetrated his skin. He started crawling deeper into the cave. Finally he collapsed against the back of the shelter next to an old milk crate filled with fruit in various stages of ripeness and decay, a well-used fishing rod and a wooden bowl that collected the water that dripped slowly from a small crack in the ceiling of the cave. There the boy stayed, asleep on the sand, for the next few hours. Unfortunately it wasn't a peaceful sleep. It was tormented with dreams of his father leaving when he was only six years old, his aunt, uncle and cousin, whom he was very close to moving away a few months later, and his mother falling ill and dying the following year. This child had lived here in the cave by himself since his mother died, since he was seven. For four years he had kept himself alive by means of meager eating. He would fish, collect fruit that was discarded by those who lived in Clearwater or swipe what he could from the vendors during farmer's markets. He collected rain water to drink and survived as well as he could. He managed, but just barely. When his mother had become seriously ill he had stopped going to school and didn't return after her death. People never questioned his disappearance. They simply assumed that his remaining family, his aunt, uncle and cousin, had taken him in. However, this was not true. The boy slipped between shadows and buildings. He was rarely ever noticed. His solitude had hurt him in many ways, most of which he didn't notice. He was well aware that he had gone from a thin boy to a skeletal, emaciated shadow of what he had been. He now bore many scars from most unlucky run-ins with gangs in the busier cities surrounding Clearwater as well as from his new life style. What he failed to notice was his voice. He hadn't spoken to a single person since he moved to the cave. Four years ago his mother died. Four years ago his voice was last heard by a human being. Four years ago he spoke his last word. Four years ago he interacted with a human. Four years ago the last thing he loved was taken from him. Four years ago was the time someone spoke to him. Four years ago he was showed love for the last time. Four years ago he showed an emotion for the last time. Four years ago he last cried. Four years ago he last laughed. Four years ago he last smiled. Four years ago he was actually alive. Four years ago he became a shell of a person. Four years ago it seems his life ended. Four years ago Sawyer Nelson had disappeared. At it has been four years to long.[Chapter 2] Well here goes chapter two. I hope it's not two disappointing. Thank you to my three reviewers I honestly could not have gotten this out without you. I apologize for the lateness but I have a very crazy life and you should feel special, I have three stories that I'm working on and this is the only one I've updated. I don't own anything and I hope you enjoy this. Please read and review. Chapter 1 Pain, it was the only thing that registered in the boy's mind. It jolted him out of his fitful sleep. Slowly he sat up. His body ached from lying in the fetal position for multiple hours while he had been sleeping. Although his body ached, that was not the pain that had woken him. After contemplating this for a few moments it dawned on him. The pain was in his stomach. Why was he so hungry? He quickly did a run through on all the food he had eaten in the last week and soon found his answer. He was in pain and hungry because he hadn't consumed any food in the past week. He quickly made his way to the milk crate that held his fruit. Reaching in, he hoped to grab an orange because for some reason he was craving the explosion of soothing juice that burst into his mouth after each bit, but instead his hand it the wooden bottom of the crate. It was completely empty. Panic filled his mind, blurring his vision as he franticly tried to figure out why he had absolutely no food. As he accepted the fact that his food was gone Sawyer's vision began to clear. It was then that he noticed small tracks in the sand. They lead from the carte out of the cave. With an inward sigh Sawyer decided that he better find more food now since his stomach still hurt and some small animal, most likely a rodent of some sort, stole what he had. Picking up his beat-up fishing pole and the milk crate he headed out of his home. As he stepped out into the bright light from the darkness of the cave he closed his eyes to protect them from the assaulting sunshine. Slowly he reopened them allowing them to adjust to the sudden change. Deciding to fish first, before anyone else showed up on the beach, he headed toward the water's edge. With a well-practiced sidearm cast he sent his old, rusty, crocked hook relatively far out into the wide blue-green expanse of the sea. Sawyer sat down on the milk crate to wait for the telltale jerk of the line telling him that he had a bite. The serene quite in which the only sounds were the waves crashing on the shore and the seagulls calling from above was interrupted by the sound of thrashing a little way down the shore. Sawyer stood, firmly barring the end of the fishing pole in the sand, and headed down the beach. He had to base a bend in the coast in order to find the noise that had interrupted him. As he got nearer the sounds of country music floated towards him. People, he shuddered at the thought of having to interact with others of his kind. Finally the source of the sound came into view. A dolphin was tangled in ropes and a crab trap. Looking up from the dolphin Sawyer saw a man franticly waving his arms, screaming and running up to passing cars. He quickly realized that this man was not going to actively help the trapped animal. Sawyer, since he lived in the wild, had a way with animals. He loved them. He found their companionship far better than that of humans. Not only did he trust these creatures but they sensed something in him that led them to trust him too. He slowly walked up to the panicked dolphin, careful to stay out of sight from the crazed man. He knelt down in the wet sand near the animals head a carefully began to work the rope out of her, he had figured out rather quickly that this was a female dolphin, mouth. After freeing her head he moved to the tail which was the more grieves of the two injuries. The ropes trap had cut off circulation to the dolphin's tail, not to mention the gashes that had also been created. Sawyer took the old, rusted knife that he used for almost everything off the belt loop it hung from and started to work on the removal of the crap trap and ropes. At this point the fisherman had finally managed to flag down a car and get in contact with the local Coast Guard. Within about fifteen minutes the Clearwater Marine Aquarium rescue team arrived. They were just getting out of the van when Sawyer finished freeing the dolphin. He looked up at the sound of people and fled. After four years of almost complete solitude Sawyer had developed a slight phobia of other human. In his mind the majority of people left you when you needed them most or were too cruel to help an orphaned, homeless child. Unfortunately for Sawyer he did make his escape unnoticed. A young girl spotted him and tugging on her father's sleeve, pointed him out before getting to work on helping to get the dolphin into the van. This man's name was Doctor Clay Haskett. His eyes followed the scrawny boy has he rounded the curve in the beach. 'What type of child could free a dolphin by himself and then disappear the second help arrived? Didn't he want thanks?' Clay wondered. Pushing these thoughts away he barked an order to the crew and they set off towards the aquarium to provide the medical attention their passenger most desperately needed. The silence of the ride was interrupted by the voice of his young daughter, Hazel. \"Winter,\" she said matter-of-factly. At the strange look her father cast her she clarified, \"the dolphin. Her name is Winter.\" ","Summary":" I know it's short but it is just the introduction. Hopefully the chapter will be longer.

More to come :) * Introduction Pheobe paced outside her bathroom door chewing on her thumb nail nervously. How could this have happened? Well, scratch that, she knew HOW it happened but the fact remained... How could she have let this happen? Pheobe was a head trainer at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and assistant to Dr. Clay Haskett, whom she had been dating for less than 3 months now. Trying to maintain a professional relationship while at work and trying to be a good girlfriend outside of it was tough enough...now this. She stopped pacing and pressed her back against the wall, letting out a slow sigh. This was a disaster. Suddenly the door beside her opened and out stepped Hazel, Dr. Clay's sixteen year old daughter. Her face drained of most color. Pheobe quickly got to her feet and hugged Hazel tightly. \"It's ok. I promise, what ever it says...\" She whispered before pressing a gentle kiss on the top of Hazel's head. \"Pheobe... I'm pregnant too.\" Pheobe sighed and hugged Hazel a little tighter. Great, not only was she pregnant but so was Hazel. This was a TOTAL disaster. \"You're dad... is gonna lose his mind.\"[Chapter 2] Take Your Time Chapter One: Well That When Well Dr. Clay was having a pretty amazing morning, thing were going exactly his way. He woke up to find a fresh pot of coffee waiting for him, a love note from Phoebe, and the latest animal wellness report from the vet techs. Hazel was even out of bed before he was, that was a surprise for sure. Yep, today was gonna be great \"Good morning, Dr. Clay.\" A group of high school volunteers chimed in at the same time. \"Good Morning,\" He said with a smile. \"It's gonna be a busy day today.\" The group of high schooler girls giggled and waved as he practically bounced to his office. He opened the door to find Phoebe and Hazel already there. \"Good morning ladies!\" He didn't even notice the tone in their voice as they returned his salutation. \"We've got a lot to go over today.\" \"Yes, we do.\" Phoebe said softly. \"Hazel, have we received the latest fish order?\" \"Hazel looked down at the floor and rubbed her arm nervously. \"It's late. \"Dr. Clay, completely unfazed just shrugged and looked at his watch. \"Must be caught up in traffic.\" He moved on to Phoebe. \"And how about the x-rays for the sea turtles.\" \"They're late.\" Phoebe smiled weakly. Dr. Clay made a face for a moment but then smile. \"Technology huh, well anything else late I should know about?\" He laughed. Hazel and Phoebe looked up at each other and then sighed. \"We are.\" Dr. Clay tilted his head and chuckled. \"Um... obviously not not, because you're both standing here.\" Hazel was on the verge of tears as she managed to mutter \"That's not what we meant.\" \"What is it? What's wrong sweetie?\" \"Clay,\" Phoebe murmured talking a step towards him. \"I'm pregnant.\" Clay shook his head a few times and his eyes got huge. \"What?!\" He said closing the distance between him and her. He took her in his arms and kissed her nose. \"Are you serious?!\" Phoebe smiled and wiped away a tear that had escaped her eyes. \"Yes. You're gonna be a dad...again.\" She smiled and looked at Hazel. \"And Hazel...you're gonna be a sister...\" Hazel smiled the best she could, she really was thrilled her her dad and Phoebe and she was ecstatic to be a big sister, but this isn't exactly how she thought her life would turn out. She closed her eyes, \"Dad...\" Clay looked over from hugging Phoebe, smiling brightly. He held out his arm and motioned for Hazel to join the hug. Hazel hesitated slightly but wrapped her arms around her father and Phoebe gently. \"You're gonna be a big sister, kiddo.\" \"Dad...\" She whispered. \"I'm pregnant too.\" \"I know you're excited and...\" He gently pushed them back to look at them. \"What...did...you...\" Phoebe placed her hands on Clay's chest, not in a defensive nor a protective stance, more like a gentle and reassuring gesture. \"Clay, I know this is all a bit much...\" \"A bit much? My sixteen year old just informed me she's going to be a mother...\" And at that exact moment, Sawyer picked the absolutely worst moment to walk into Dr. Clay's office. \"Dr. Clay... Hope is pregnant!\" He snapped his head up to glare at him. \"Oh really?\" He growled. \"Apparently, that's not the only bun in the oven.\" Sawyer gave a confused look and looked at Phoebe and Hazel. \"Um...what did I miss?\" \"I'm gonna kill him...\" He said before taking a few steps towards Sawyer, who just stood there like a deer in the head lights. \"I'm gonna kill you Sawyer.\" \"DAD!\" Hazel screamed stopping him in his tracks. \"Sawyer's not the father.\" Sawyer shot a panicked look from Hazel to Dr. Clay. \"Father? Of who...wait what?! Hazel, are you pregnant?!\" Phoebe and Hazel both gave a soft smile and raised a hand to signal they were in the same messed up boat. Sawyer's eyes nearly exploded out of his head when he realized what was happening. \"Dr. Clay... I never...I would never...I'm gonna go.\" He stuttered. \"Well that went well.\" Phoebe whispered.

He probably would have taken it back, because he happened to like CMA's shark population, but the effect was good. Of course six months ago, they'd been recovering from an uncomfortably close call to losing Winter, and Sawyer was on a plane to Boston, any feelings for Hazel Haskett pushed aside for the time being. His only concerns had been that he would be leaving Winter for three months and that he was about to embark on the journey of a lifetime. Now he was back, and if you told Sawyer that he was falling for his best friend, he'd have again told you to go jump in the shark tank. But this time, it wouldn't have been because it was ridiculous. This time, it would be because it was true, but he wasn't about to admit it. CMA, Post-Closing Time : It should have been like any other spring afternoon at CMA. Sawyer was on spring break from his sophomore year, and was spending every second at Clearwater to make up for the lost three months. He and Hazel were scrubbing the dolphin pools, keeping idle chatter, as they did every Wednesday and Sunday. Sawyer was stealing glances at Hazel at an embarrassingly high frequency, despite the fact that she kept catching him. Subtlety wasn't something they'd worked on during his time at SEA. She'd kind of just ignored it, but when he glanced over at her for seemingly the hundredth time, she'd had enough, \"Sawyer, what is your issue?\" Sawyer's neck flushed red and he muttered, \"Nothing, sorry,\" before scrubbing the side of the wall next to Winter's platform with renewed vigor. He could feel Hazel's eyes burning a hole in his t-shirt and he willed himself to stay staring at the water. Friends, friend, friends, friends , he reminded himself over and over. It became a bit of a rhythm. Scrub the wall, friends, scrub, friends. But in the silence that had followed Hazel's irritation, Sawyer's mind had run wild. He tried to focus on Winter, and the progress she was making in reversing the damage to her spine, but his mind kept returning to his best friend. She'd started popping up in his dreams, looking as beautiful and untouchable as she was in real life, at an irritatingly high frequency, and Sawyer would wake up, convinced that they were real for a second before reality would come crashing back. \"Sawyer. Sawyer. Sawyer. Sawyer Nelson, pay attention!\" Hazel's voice snapped him out of his reverie. Hazel was standing in front of him, a hand on her hip, \"Are you ok?\" Sawyer shook his head a little, \"Yeah, I'm fine. Sorry, did you say something?\" He finally worked up the courage to look at her, and her eyes were narrowed. He couldn't help but notice that her brown eyes were the exact same shade as Hope's, an observation that failed to help the matter in the slightest. Hazel sighed, \"I said, are you ok? You seem out of it. You've been scrubbing the same section of wall for the past five minutes.\" Sawyer nodded, \"Yeah, I'm fine. Just a lot on my mind, I guess.\" He sat down on the platform, the water coming up to his waist. It was easier talking with his back to her. \"Anything I can do?\" Her voice was full of an endearing concern that made him smile, \"No. Just some things I need to sort out on my own.\" He could hear her footsteps walking away and he turned to see her walking out to the gate, \"Hazel. Hazel. What are you doing? \" The last time she'd released Winter and Hope into the training pool after hours and got caught swimming with them, they'd gotten yelled at by Clay for an impossibly long time about being irresponsible and messing around. She smiled at him, \"Sawyer Nelson, you are being an idiot. And if I can't break through the idiocy, I know someone who can.\" Then, as she went to bend down to pull open the gate, she lost her footing, and with a little shriek, fell into Winter and Hope's pool. Sawyer jumped up, \"Hazel! Hazel, are you ok?\" He pulled himself out of the smaller pool and, trying not to slip, ran to the larger, sheltered one. Hazel surfaced, laughing. He breathed a sigh of relief, \"Are you insane?\" Hazel just laughed and swam towards the platform. He reached a hand to help her up onto the platform and, to his shock, Hazel pulled with all her might and he tumbled, head first, into the pool with her. He surfaced, gasping and laughing, \"Hey!\" Hazel was smiling from ear to ear, \"Serves you right! That's payback for pulling me in last time!\" Sawyer laughed and said, \"Well, if that's payback, then I think I remember something like this happening after you landed,\" and he splashed her, which she reciprocated, alerting both the bottlenose dolphins to their presence. Much to both the dolphins' seeming delight, the two teenagers kept splashing like little kids and soon, it was an all out war, Hazel and Sawyer splashing each other and Hope and Winter just flinging water in the general vicinity. Shrieks of laughter echoed throughout the outdoor deck. Finally, Sawyer threw his hands up in surrender and swam towards the platform before pulling himself up. He offered his hand to Hazel again before withdrawing it, \"Are you going to pull me in again?\" She laughed and shook her head. He clasped her hand in his and pulled her up. They stood, giggling and panting for a second, before Hazel sobered, \"Seriously, Sawyer. Are you sure you're ok?\" Sawyer looked at her, his hair dripping in his eyes, and suddenly, he had the confidence to tell her, \"Have you ever been in a situation where you want something more, but you don't want to mess up what you have?\" Hazel's eyebrow furrowed, confused, but she nodded and he continued, \"Well, when I was at SEA, I realized that there was a situation at home that I wanted something more from. There's this girl, you see. I can't stop thinking about her. But I've known her for a while and I don't want to mess up what I have with her. It's just so good . But I wake up in the morning wanting to be able to tell her how I feel, but I can't.\" He trailed off, hoping she'd catch what he was talking about. She didn't. So he plowed on, feeling a flush creeping up his spine, and his heart pounding a steady tattoo somewhere in his throat, \"She's really funny, Hazel, and she just talks and talks all the time and it makes me smile and she's passionate about what I'm passionate about.\" He saw Hazel's face fall, \"So go ask Susie out.\" Sawyer smiled, \"You see, I would. But Susie's name doesn't match her eye color. Susie didn't talk to me when no one else would-\" Suddenly, a smile broke across Hazel's face and she cut him off, \"Shut up and kiss me, Sawyer.\" He did a double take, shocked, \"What?\" She looked up at him, \"I said, shut your idiot mouth and kiss me already.\" And so, standing knee deep in water, watched by two dolphins and Roofus the pelican, Sawyer Nelson took a step forward, pulled her in and kissed his best friend for the first time. Phoebe was running late. Inappropriately late, actually. She still had to file the reports from Winter and Hope's sessions today, and check on their newest rescue, Jack the sea otter, as well as make sure Sawyer and Hazel had finished cleaning the deck, and her boyfriend would be here in 20 minutes to take her out. Speed walking, she went to make her way around the corner to Clay's office to file the reports and stopped dead. Standing on the platform of the dolphin pool were a dripping wet and kissing teenage boy and girl. The boy had one hand on the girl's waist and the other was resting at the nape of her neck. Both of the girl's hands were wrapped around the waist of the boy. Phoebe watched, smiling in triumph, as Hazel and Sawyer finally broke apart. Sawyer said something that Phoebe couldn't hear and Hazel laughed in return. Phoebe silently backed away as Hazel, blushing bright red made her way up the ladder, followed by a triumphantly smiling Sawyer. Let them have this for today, she thought. She'd be sure to give them absolute hell tomorrow, and remind them that they had both devoutly and separately stated that there would be nothing more between them. But for tonight, Phoebe could let this little moment slide. If you had told Sawyer Nelson six months ago that he would kiss Hazel Haskett, he would have told you to go jump in the shark tank. But as he walked to find towels with Hazel, his mouth tingled and body surged with excitement. Because he'd kissed Hazel Haskett. And he wasn't about to stop.[Chapter 2] So I know I said that Subtlety was going to be a one-shot, but I lied. Not sure how I feel about this, but I hope you guys like it. It's kind of based off my own personal awkwardness. For any Book Thief fans, I have a poem that I'm debating posting. Would you guys read it? Or should I stick to short stories here? Anyways, enjoy teenage awkwardness in its shining glory If you'd told Hazel Haskett six months and a day ago that she'd have kissed her best friend, she'd have flushed bright red and stammered an unthreatening threat, probably something involving Roofus. She'd have taken it back, because she really had no control over the damn bird, but the effect was good. Of course six months ago, they'd been recovering from an horrible period of time, in which they lost Panama, Mandy and came uncomfortably to losing Winter, and Sawyer was on a plane to Boston, leaving Hazel to push aside any feelings for now. Her only concerns had been that she now had to revert back to being alone and that Winter was going to need help if she were to avoid another lapse into depression. Now he was back, and if you told Hazel that she was going to kiss her best friend, she'd have looked around for Roofus. But this time, it wouldn't have been because it was ridiculous. This time, it would be because it was true, and she wasn't about to give Phoebe the satisfaction of knowing. CMA, Pre-Opening Time: It's just any other day , Hazel mentally hissed to herself as she and Phoebe prepped breakfast for the dolphins. She hadn't stopped smiling since yesterday, and it was becoming increasingly challenging to come up with reasons why she was grinning like the Cheshire Cat at nothing. Phoebe had spent the last five minutes interrogating her on just what was so smile-worthy about dead fish. She tried to focus on the supposedly delicious fish corpses in front of her, and internally sighed with relief when her phone buzzed. She wiped her hands and clicked the home button, Shut up and tell Phoebe I'm running late. Be there in ten. Sawyer. He hadn't stopped telling her to shut up and do things since she'd told him to shut up and kiss her. She snorted and Phoebe turned around, \"What's so funny, now?\" She pointed a fish at Hazel accusingly, \"And none of this it's a beautiful day crap. At least try to tell a decent lie.\" Hazel blushed a little bit and typed a quick ok, now shut up for real. See you soon. She put her phone on the table and returned to the fish, \"Just Sawyer. He says he's running late.\" They picked up the buckets of fish and moved them to the dolphin platform for today's feeding session, to be done later, and in front of an audience, \"And why is Sawyer running late particularly funny?\" She knows. I don't know how she knows but she knows, the little voice in Hazel's head muttered as her stomach dropped slightly. Slightly wary, Hazel replied, \"He's being Sawyer. Sawyer says ridiculous things.\" Phoebe cocked her eyebrow. She knows . \"Oh, shut up, Phoebe.\" Hazel's voice took on a teasing and sarcastic tone as she headed towards the sink to rinse the fish guts off, \"Want me to kiss you, too? Or do you only kiss people you deny any sort of emotional connection to?\" Hazel whirled around to see Phoebe grinning wickedly, Hazel stared at her and said slowly, \"How do you know about that?\" Phoebe examined her fingernails and opened her mouth, armed with a torrent of teasing when the door opened and Sawyer entered, slightly out of breath. Standing before him were a wickedly smirking Phoebe and an open-mouthed, flushed Hazel. They both turned to look at him, \"Sawyer!\" Hazel and Phoebe cried at the same time, Hazel out of relief of having some back up, and Phoebe out of delight. Sawyer looked perturbed at the enthusiastic greeting. Staring suspiciously at Phoebe, he slung his backpack off his shoulder and set it down, \"What's going on?\" \"Well, young Sawyer. Hazel was just about to explain herself. And yourself, actually. I mean, if we're being specific.\" Hazel watched as a flash of horror followed by a look of sheepish consent crossed his features. He glanced at her, and she gave him the can't help you, I'm stuck too look. \"Phoebe, I don't know what you know, or how much you know, but if this interrogation could wait until after you go talk to Clay about running tests on Jack, I think Jack's health and Clay would appreciate it.\" He gestured over his shoulder, towards the inside of the marine hospital, where Phoebe knew Clay was just getting ready to start the day in his office. \"Oh, crap, I forgot about that.\" She pointed at the two of them, \"We're not done here. I expect answers.\" She rushed off, leaving the two teenagers staring at the back of their tormentor. They looked back at each other and burst out giggling. \"So Phoebe knows,\" Sawyer shook his head and laughed. Hazel blushed a little bit, \"Well, it is your fault.\" Sawyer looked thoroughly indignant, and opened his mouth, closed it, and quipped, \"I resent that.\" \"Well it was your fault.\" \"You told me to kiss you.\" \"You kissed me!\" The two stared at each other in mock fury, each glaring at the other until Sawyer's resolve cracked and he burst out laughing again. Hazel lasted another two seconds before she cracked and they melted into gales of laughter. Hazel, still trying to catch her breath, looked up, \"Hey, Sawyer?\" Sawyer sobered slightly, \"Yeah?\" Hazel smirked, \"Shut up, would you?\" ","Summary":" If you had told Sawyer Nelson six months ago that he would have fallen for his best friend, he'd ha"},{"Movie":"Dolphin Tale","Title":"Dolphin Tale 3","Author":"WinterWaiter","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10738826","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I haven't watched the movie yet because it will be released on Wednesday for me and I can't go on weekdays so I believe I'll be watching on the weekends.

Please enjoy :D Dolphin Tale 3 Chapter 1 A brunette teenager holding a backpack in one arm steps out of his mom's newly cleaned car. He and his mom, Lorraine, were in a parking spot just beside a blue building. Impatient for his mom to get out of the car while she was getting stuff, he ran to the building. His steps were loud and clear. A friend greeted him on the way to the door. His eyes widen, remembering his old friend. It was Rufus. \"Hi Rufus,\" He said, smiling at the white feathered pelican. The pelican squawked in joy and it jumped around. \"Sawyer!\" The teenager's mom called, walking to him. \"Don't just leave your mom there!\" Sawyer laughed as he pointed at Rufus, who also remembered Lorraine. Again, it was overjoyed. The mother smiled and pat the pelican. The teenager crossed his fingers, hoping the entrance was unlocked. It was unlocked. He smiled as he remembered a certain someone always assigned to lock the entrance, but always forgets. He can't wait to see that person again. Sawyer quietly opened the entrance to what is called Clearwater Marine Aquarium, which is a place where not only the staff displays sea and aquatic creatures, it is also a hospital who stays true to their rule: Rescue, Rehabilitate and Release. He and his mom entered with baby steps, hoping not to catch someone's attention. The ground floor was deserted, Sawyer remembered the otters, dolphins and he saw a few new animals. Sawyer and Lorraine went to the upstairs pool and saw a few familiar faces. They hid behind the door hoping to surprise the group. Clay Haskett was there, somewhat one of the leaders of the aquarium. Phoebe and Kat, the two female trainers were there too. Mother and son also noticed Kyle and Dr. Cameron McCarthy. Sawyer tip-toed a little closer and then he saw a blonde teenager near the pool, her feet dipped into the water and two dolphins approached her, communicating with her. Winter and Hope. Sawyer remembered both of them. Winter, his best friend. Hope, a friend he met 3 months ago, who accompanied Winter after he left for the SEA Semester Program. The two dolphins made a sound like a bird chirping. \"Tweety bird,\" The blonde said. \"Sawyer should have come back here days ago.\" \"Where is he?\" She asked herself, pondering. And Hazel, his best friend ever since he met her at the aquarium. They somewhat had a spark but he was too happy to think about it. He was surprised seeing that Hazel was thinking about when he gets back. But he was a few days late. Just as he was about to walk to Hazel, someone tackles him from behind. It was Kyle, Sawyer's athletic cousin and someone he looked up to as a father figure, ever since his father vanished years ago. Hazel, not knowing what was going on behind her, looked back. Her hazel eyes widened at the sight of her best friend. She removed her feet from the pool and ran over to hug him. Lorraine, Clay, McCarthy, Phoebe and Kat watched the brunette being hugged tightly to death by Kyle and Hazel. \"How was SEA Semester, Sawyer?\" Clay asked grinning at the teenager. \"I got to meet a ton of people and learn a lot,\" Sawyer answered, smiling. \"Met any girls?\" Kyle said, smirking at his cousin, giving him a pat on the back. \"What do you mean?\" Sawyers asks Kyle as he protests. Hazel smiled at Sawyer, glad that he was back. The whole aquarium staff, even the animals missed him. \"Dr. McCarthy, how's Winter and Hope?\" Lorraine asked the chuckling man. \"They're doing fine, they've been great,\" Hazel grabbed Sawyer's hand and dragged him to the pool where Winter and Hope were together. The dolphins chirped in happiness seeing their old friend once again. Sawyer kneeled and pet the two dolphins. \"How's it going guys?\" Sawyer said. \"I missed you.\" Hazel giggled and pushed the brunette into the pool. He left a big splash as he fell into the water. The group laughed. Sawyer then pulled Hazel in and they both enjoyed playing with the dolphins. \"Come on kids, let's plan the welcome back party for Sawyer and his mom,\" Phoebe and Kat said in unison. Sawyer looked at Hazel and she nodded and smiled at him. The boy and the mom looked at the group in awe, honored to be one of them. ~0~ Sawyer and Lorraine soon were taken to the room where Sawyer also celebrated his Bon Voyage party. There holds a huge banner written along with the words \"Welcome Back to CMA!\" in big bold letters. Plastered around the room are posters of the aquarium's animals, dolphins and other things. The lights brightened up the room and the homemade food is absolutely amazing. Soft music enlightened the mood and the atmosphere felt great. The whole staff took the time to make a welcome back party for Sawyer and his mom. \"Welcome back!\" The whole staff shouted as they smiled. Lorraine and her awestruck son explored the room and looked around. They were amazed by the lights and decorations, it was amazing they were able to finish this in a few hours. Hazel then took the liberty of giving off a speech on how much she missed Sawyer and Lorraine. \"It's a huge honor to be great and close friends with the wonderful Nelson family.\" Hazel held back the tears of joy having the whole staff back once again and so she continued her speech. \"For years it's been such a hassle to get things in shape and our popular, inspirational and outstanding Winter wouldn't be herself without the aid of Sawyer and his mom, Lorraine.\" The crowd smiled at the blonde and Hazel had the feeling Sawyer and his mom, were happy and glad to be back. \"I'm glad the whole family is here, this must be the greatest moment I ever had,\" Hazel continued. \"I love everyone here and thank you for exerting all your efforts.\" As Hazel finished her speech the staff clapped in enjoyment. The blonde walked over to Lorraine and Sawyer and smiled. ~0~ The welcome back party was short but thoroughly enjoyed and everyone loved it. Clay was walking around the deserted aquarium after everyone left for home and he held a folder that held a lot of papers. He sat down a chair near a table and he looked at the aquatic animals that surrounded the place. Clay frustratingly throws down the folder and the papers scattered the table. \"The time is coming soon,\" He said sadly. The view shifted to the piles of papers and on one of them said.. Philip Hordern Florida Hotel Building planning finished Clearwater Marine Aquarium must come to a close \"All belongs to Hordern,\" Clay says, covering his face in sadness.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 I just watched Dolphin Tale 2! I loved the relationships between the two cute dolphins and the two cute teenagers! And let me tell you my heart hurt when I watched Lorraine's car go away. And sorry for the delay! School and all. I also have a project where I'll design a school! Hope you enjoy this chapter Clay Haskett has yet to tell the news to the staff because Sawyer had just came back and he couldn't bare see Hazel cry. Last night, he recklessly threw around the papers in frustration ever since his discovery of the aquarium getting shut down for Philip Hordern's hotel. Years ago he remembered where he shook Hordern's hand as he agreed to his deal of shutting down the aquarium when the planning department manages to design and plan the whole hotel. What's worst is he knew very well that Philip has been funding their operation for years. Which made him feel bad that he planned on denying the demolition of the aquarium. He knew on how much this aquarium meant to Hazel, Sawyer, the animals, and everyone else. He also felt bad about that. The aquarium was the whole reason Sawyer has accomplished so much. He had gotten into the SEA Program and he sees the kid going into a nice school. Hazel on the other hand, felt at home here. Heck, this is her home! She was dedicated on saving and rescuing aquatic animals. Hazel met and got to be friends with Sawyer here. Many memories were made inside this whole aquatic sanctuary. Reed Haskett, Hazel's grandfather, also has an old boat which stands near the dock. Clay thought of the wonderful times he had sailing the world in the boat. Now, the place where it stands may go away. And the last thing. Clay thought of his wife. Hazel's mother, the woman he proposed to years back. She admired his brave and caring personality. The way he shapes up the aquarium to save and rescue animals. This is where he proposed to her, while on a date, standing on top of what seems to be the crow's nest on the boat. They built this aquarium. This was his greatest and strongest memory of her. And now, it may just go away. ~O~ Hazel and Sawyer were sitting down on the edge of the pool, their feet dipped in the water. When Winter or Hope comes up, they would pet them gently. Figuring it's been years since they've had a conversation, they decided to take the time to get to know what's been happening. \"So.. How did the homeschooling go?\" Sawyer asked, trying to keep up conversation. \"I found it a bit hard but with a bit of help I managed,\" Hazel replied. \"How was the SEA Program?\" \"I met a lot of people, made friends.\" It was quite awkward. That's the only thing that stayed in their minds. It was the only topic they could find interesting. It was hard to just stray off topic and start a new one. \"Met any… girls?\" Not only was Sawyer surprised himself from Hazel's question, but she herself got surprised too. Hazel fake coughed, trying to make it sound like a normal question. She suddenly thought of the girl Sawyer was friends with months back. The volunteer, Susie. \"That's the same thing Kyle asked earlier what's up?\" Sawyer said, dense. Hazel kept silent for a few seconds, trying to think of an excuse to come to that question. And once she did, she spoke, \"It's pretty obvious you'd make a ton of friends that are boys, what about girls?\" Saywer also kept silent a bit and rubbed his chin while looking up. \"Oh yeah! I have! Her name is Grace!\" Hazel then froze. \"Wow! You're actually socializing!\" she joked, but inside she felt sort of… weird. Both teenagers laughed. ~O~ Phoebe and Kat were sitting in the meeting room, working on papers and files. A few minutes later, the telephone shot up and it ringed noisily. \"I'll get it,\" Kat said, running up to the phone. The young adult picked it up and she then said the common \"Hello, who is this?\" Phoebe later can hear sounds of worry from the telephone and was curious to know what's happening. Kat then put the phone down and worriedly looks at Phoebe. \"They found a female dolphin on the beach,\" she says. ~O~ Clay was running as soon as the rescue van arrived where the dolphin was beached. It was a female calf and it was shivering in the cold air. Clay then called in the stretcher team and they slowly lowered the poles and gently put down the dolphin. Hazel's carrying a video camera, recording every second of this for her Hazel Haskett films. \"She's a child,\" Sawyer said looking worriedly at the dolphin. The staff find themselves following the stretcher team and Hazel continued her recording. The dolphin then was placed down inside the pool as they arrived the area. Phoebe and Kat slowly entered the pool and swam towards the dolphin slowly. The dolphin backed away showing little signs of hostility but mostly fear. Clay discussed the dolphin's location and the time it was on the beach. The time was quite long and the dolphin is lucky to manage surviving. The sun was setting as they continue to socialize with the dolphin. Clay, Sawyer and Hazel watch the horizon and the orange sky. They smiled as they thought of the newcomer to the aquarium. \"We should name her sunset,\" Hazel suggested. \"So we'll never forget when we met her.\" Clay and Sawyer agreed without hesitation and they called the attention of the staff once again and the whole aquarium clapped as to welcome the new dolphin. ~O~ A few days later the staff ran some tests and the dolphin only had minor injuries. So far, Sunset only managed to trust Hazel and Sawyer, who was in charge of taking care of her. She was so cautious beside other people. \"Hey, Sawyer,\" Hazel spoke. \"Yeah?\" \"Why don't we ask dad if Sunset can meet Hope and Winter? Sawyer thought it was a terrific idea. He hi-fived Hazel and both went down to consult Clay about this. Clay hesitated at first and then explained the rules to the teenager once more to prevent them from making any mistakes and the girl and boy constantly nodded as he spoke. After a few minutes Hazel and Sawyer walked to the pool and they swam to the door. Hazel pulled it but somehow it won't budge and so Sawyer quickly swam to her side to help her. As their hands touch they quickly flinched but gulped simultaneously and they finally opened the door. They awkwardly withdraw their hands from the door and swam to the platform and held to the edge. Winter and Hope enter the pool where Sunset resides and they quickly swam to her in a joyous motion. Winter and Hope chirped in happiness but Sunset quickly swims to Hazel's side chirping in fear of the two. \"Sun, what are you doing?\" Hazel asked confused. \"Talk to them.\" Sawyer slowly shook his head as he watched a few meters away and spoke in a loud, clear voice. \"She's scared,\" he said. \"She's not used to this.\" Hazel quickly understood this situation and was thinking slowly in her head of what to do. Winter and Hope's blowholes quickly spat water and they slowly swam back to the pool they were in before and with slight hesitation Hazel closed the opening. She swam to the platform and egressed the pool climbing up. \"That didn't look to good.\" Saywer shook his head, agreeing with her. The dolphin must've had trust issues and that she only developed trust in Hazel and him. Something must've happened and he theorized that it may have to do with why the dolphin was beached. ~O~ The next day the two teenager informed Clay about what they gathered from yesterday and that Sunset showed cautiousness and hostility near Winter and Hope. They had already fed Sunset and that she was in no mood to make such friends now. Clay understood this and he nodded his head in interest. They will soon make such a violation once more if they leave Sunset alone. Problems were arising and it was bad timing to bring up the Philip Hordern situation which only he knows about. Or he thinks so. Reed, his dad, was watching him from a far distance. And he noticed he was doing well in keeping deep secrets.

Raptor2216 here. For all my readers I have now, I hope you have enjoyed my stories so far. And for all of my current readers, and for all the readers I may soon get, I have come forth with a brand new story. It has finally come. My first real, non-crossover fanfiction! (I am not counting the Russian Hunger Games, since that is probably not continuing) This is a Dolphin Tale 3 type fanfiction. The intro chapter will take place right after Sawyer's return from SEA Semester. Then, it will cut to Sawyer's senior year of high school. This will actually be at least 3 stories; this one, and two sequels. I originally planned for only two stories. But my plan for the sequel made it too long. I plan to cut this off just after Sawyer and Hazel go off to college, and have the sequel start up a few months later. As of now, my chapter plan calls for this to be 52 chapters. That includes an epilogue chapter to lead into the second story. First off, to clarify a few things. Susie will not be in this fanfiction. I'll reveal the backstory for that in the second chapter. I will instead have another girl fill that love antagonist role to Hazel. Secondly, there will be Kyle-Sandra in this. Third, there will be no Lorraine-Clay. Fourth, the other permanent resident dolphin at the real CMA, Nicholas, will show up in this. And fifth, Sawyer and Hazel will get married in the sequel. Also to add in this last thing: a major part of the second half of this story and the sequel will be the US Navy, since I am a bit of a military nerd. The Navy as a body will show up a few times, with one ship in particular. And one Navy officer will play a major role in the later half of this story, and the whole of the sequel. (Just a hint. The Navy and this officer may have something to do with Nicholas). I know this has been a lengthy intro, so let's get going. Here's chapter 1. Chapter 1- Sawyer Comes Home The sun shone bright over Tampa on a cool December afternoon. It was December 23rd. Only two days until Christmas. In the skies over Tampa, a United Airlines Boeing 787, flight number 735, coming from Boston after a stop in Washington DC, was descending towards the Tampa International Airport. At 2:43 PM, Flight 735 touched down on the runway. At 2:50, the big 787 pulled up to its gate, and the passengers began to disembark only a few minutes later. As passengers from the flight continued to stream out of the jetway, Sawyer Nelson exited to the jetway into the terminal. He smiled brightly. After being at sea for SEA Semester for the past three months, during which he had turned 15, he was finally home in Tampa. He turned around to see his cousin Kyle coming off the jetway, with a look of satisfaction on his face. Sawyer felt the same way. His first ride on a 787 had been a very pleasant one. Kyle smiled at his younger cousin. \"Hey, Sawyer. There you are. come on. We'd better head down to the baggage claim.\" As the two of them headed for baggage claim, Sawyer thought about the trip. SEA Semester had been amazing; a real learning experience for him. But, at last he was back, and just in time for Christmas. As Sawyer reached the bottom of the escalator to baggage claim and stepped away, he felt a hand on his shoulder. Turning his head, he saw it was Kyle. \"Well, bud, we're finally home,\" said Kyle. \"Yeah. I know. It felt like forever that I was gone,\" replied Sawyer. \"So, are you excited to see Winter and Hope? Your mom? Dr. Clay? A certain blond haired girl with freckles?\" Kyle ended with a grin. Sawyer smiled until Kyle said that last one. He instantly felt himself go a little bit red, and his smile morphed into a look of surprise. \"What? What are you talking about?\" Kyle grinned even more. \"Ooh. Getting a little flustered, are we?\" Sawyer felt himself getting more red, and a feeling of embarrassment began to grow in him. He struggled to contain himself, and managed to put on a calm face. \"Yes. I am excited to see Hazel, just like everyone else.\" Kyle's grin grew even bigger and more mischievous, and Sawyer knew that Kyle didn't believe him. Luckily, his cousin didn't press the subject. Sawyer looked away from Kyle. In truth, he had thought about Hazel a lot on his trip, and he had missed her a lot. But he didn't want to admit it. Kyle broke the silence. \"Let's go find our carousel. The bags shouldn't be too much longer.\" Sawyer nodded, and the two headed to the carousels. After looking for a minute, they found a carousel with \"UA 735\" on its display screen. They stood patiently, and didn't have to wait for more than 4 minutes before the carousel began to move and the bags started coming up the chute and onto the carousel. Kyle and Sawyer spread out a little bit, looking for their bags. They didn't take long. It only took a few minutes for Kyle to get both of his suitcases, and Sawyer to find one of his. As Sawyer found his second suitcase and lifted it off the carousel, he heard a familiar, feminine voice call out, \"Sawyer! Kyle!\" Sawyer turned around to see his mom coming towards him and Kyle. Sawyer smiled brightly and called back, \"Mom!\" He rushed to meet her. As they reached each other, Sawyer dropped his suitcases and threw his arms around his mom. \"Oh, Sawyer, you're home,\" said Lorraine, tears starting to well up. \"I missed you, mom,\" said Sawyer. \"I missed you too, sweetheart,\" said Lorraine. They stayed in their embrace for a few more moments, then they separated. Lorraine then greeted Kyle and gave him a hug too. As they separated, Lorraine smiled and said, \"Well, grab your bags and let's get going.\" Sawyer and Kyle grabbed their bags and followed Lorraine out of the terminal and towards the parking lot. Once they got there, they found the car, Sawyer and Kyle piled their bags into the car, then all three of them hopped in for the ride home. When they reached Kyle's parents' house, Lorraine stopped and let Kyle out so that he could go put his bags away. While Kyle was in the house, Lorraine turned to Sawyer. \"Once he gets back out here, we'll head over to the aquarium. Did you miss everyone there?\" \"Yes, of course,\" said Sawyer. \"Anyone in particular?\" his mom asked curiously. Sawyer almost started to say \"Winter\", but stopped himself. He had missed Winter terribly, but he felt his mom was trying to get him to admit something more. SO he didn't say anything. Lorraine gave a sly grin before she changed the subject. \"Did you get to do your Christmas shopping on your trip? If not, I can take you tonight.\" Sawyer responded, \"Don't worry mom. I took care of it when I was in Boston.\" He had actually gotten back to Boston three days earlier, and had stayed with Kyle there until their flight today. Kyle returned from the house a minute later. He hopped in the car, Lorraine started the car back up, and they took off for Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Hazel smiled as she walked up to the dolphin pool. Winter and Hope came up to the surface, whistling and clicking. \"Hey, girls,\" she said, \"Can you believe it? Sawyer's coming home today. He's been gone for so long. Are you excited?\" Her question was met with more whistling and clicking. Hazel walked around to the edge of the pool, with no railing in front of her. She looked up at the sky. She had been waiting for Sawyer to come home. She had missed him a lot. And while he was gone, she had started to realize that maybe she felt more for him than just a friend. All of a sudden, Winter began to whistle. Hazel looked down at her. She quickly recognized the familiar whistle. Tweety Bird. Then, before she could do anything, something pushed her from behind, and she fell into the pool. She quickly surfaced and turned to look at the culprit. Right behind where she had been standing was Sawyer, laughing. \"Sawyer! You're back!\" said Hazel. Then, she said in a slightly irritated voice, \"There wasn't a better way to say hello than shoving me in the pool?\" \"Nope,\" responded Sawyer, still laughing. Hazel shook her head, then swam over the other end of the pool and got out. Sawyer came over to meet her. He was still several steps away when she ran at him and threw her arms around him. \"Oh, Sawyer, it's so good to have you back. I missed you a lot,\" she said. Then she pulled back and added with a smile, \"And so did Winter!\" Sawyer smiled. \"I missed you guys too. I'm glad to be back. But, I think I'd better go say hi to everyone else.\" Together, he and Hazel headed down to the main floor. Everyone at the aquarium was thrilled to see Sawyer. They told him how much they had all missed him, and gave him a couple of welcome home presents. After a few hours, Sawyer went home with his mom and spent the rest of the day with her, mainly by finishing putting up the last of their Christmas decorations. Two days later, Sawyer and his mom celebrated Christmas with the crew at CMA. Sawyer loved the scrapbook Hazel gave him of his years at CMA. Hazel loved the necklace with the dolphin charm that Sawyer got her. As they had Christmas dinner together, Sawyer cast his thoughts forward to his future. He was finally in high school. It wouldn't be long before he would head off to college. He thought about how hectic the next few years were going to be, but couldn't wait to see what was going to happen in his life. Little did he know that, before too long, his life was going to change a lot, more than he ever thought. And, that's the end. I know this is probably a poor ending, and probably not the best overall chapter, but I just wanted to do this as an intro. Next chapter will begin in Sawyer's senior year of high school. I plan on Bethany Hamilton returning sometime in the next few chapters, and making regular appearances from time to time. Also, Sawyer and Hazel will not actually get together for some time. Well past the halfway point of the story. And, for those who are wondering, the Navy will not appear for a while. I can guarantee that up to Chapter 15 will be Navy-free. Well, I hope this wasn't too bad of a chapter. Please, please review and give me advice and ideas you'd like to see happen in the story. And I hope to have Chapter 2 up before too long. Raptor2216 out.[Chapter 2] Hello, everybody. I am back again. I hope the opening chapter of this fanfiction was not a disappointment. Now, it's time to get down to business. This chapter picks up just under three years from where Chapter 1 left off. Sawyer has just begun his senior year of high school. I plan on starting the growth of the Hawyer relationship in this chapter. It will take a very long time for them to get to their first kiss and start dating, though. And I mean a very, very long time. Well, that's enough of that. Let's get going. Chapter 2- Senior Year \"Hello, everyone. Welcome to Pre-Calculus. I'm Mrs. Myers, and I'll be your teacher this year.\" Sawyer held his pencil to his notebook, looking intently at Mrs. Myers. It was his first day of his senior year. Pre-Calculus was his last class of the day. And the one he was the least excited for. Things had been going very well lately. High school had gone very well. He had been able to greatly improve his study habits, and had gotten very good grades in all his classes. He had taken several interesting elective classes, and had taken 2 years of Spanish. Now, he was in his final year. He was very excited for this year. What was even luckier, he was taking fewer classes this year than usual, meaning he got out of school at noon instead of 2. \"Today,we are going to start with a little meet and greet activity. I'm going to pass out a sheet of paper to each of you. Each one has certain characteristics or things people may have done. Your job is to go around and find someone who has one the characteristics on your sheet or done one of the things on your list, then write that person's name down beside that thing. The goal is to have a name beside everything on that list.\" After she passed out the sheets, Mrs. Myers said,\"Well, off you go.\" Sawyer stood up, and began walking around, talking with everyone to find names. It turns out that \"Met Winter the dolphin\" was one of the things on the list, and everyone else had already put his name down for that. That made him laugh a little. The meet and greet activity lasted for about 20 minutes. After that, Mrs. Myers sat them down and started going over a review exercise, going over stuff that they had learned last year. At the end of class, she assigned them a brief homework assignment: a handful of problems from the review section at the beginning of their textbooks. Then, the bell rang, and Sawyer jumped up from his seat and hurried out into the parking lot. He climbed into his car, an old Toyota Sienna minivan that his mom had bought for him for cheap from a colleague last year, then drove out of the parking lot, making a beeline for the CMA. (CMA) Hazel made one last mark on the paper, then set down her notebook. She looked up from her position in the crow's nest of their house boat. She just finished her first essay of the year. Hazel had actually started her homeschooling a week earlier. She found it slightly amusing that back when Panama died, she told Sawyer she rarely come up in the crow's nest anymore. But, in the past few years, with schooling getting more tough,she had found herself spending quite a bit of time in the crow's nest. She picked her notebook up again, then started down the ladder. She saw more cars were starting to pull up to the aquarium. She had to hurry. She was done for the day, and she had to hurry back to the aquarium. The busy time of day was starting. As she walked over to the aquarium, she thought about recent years. Things had been going extremely well. Winter and Hope were as close as ever. They had rescued and released four more dolphins in the last 3 years. Also, the aquarium had expanded, and now also included a small interactive facility where people could get a hands-on experience with certain animals. In her personal life, things were just as good. She had enjoyed high school, even if she was homeschooled. She was currently trying to decide whether she wanted to go to college, or just stay and work at the aquarium. Also, in the past few years, she had been going through something she had confided in nobody about. In the first few years she knew Sawyer, she had grown to like him a little. But, over the past few years, her feelings towards him had grown by a lot. Things had gotten awkward when Susie started to show she liked Sawyer. But, she had moved to North Carolina about 2 years ago because of her dad's job. Secretly,Hazel had been happy about it, because that meant she wouldn't be able pursue Sawyer anymore. However, since then, she had just been unable to admit her feelings. The few times she really thought about it,she chickened out. So she had kept her feelings to herself as they grew stronger. The only person who knew besides herself was Phoebe, who had managed to get it out of her about a year ago. Luckily, Phoebe had agreed to keep Hazel's secret. Hazel blushed as she thought of Sawyer, and how happy she would be to see him when he got to the aquarium. She knew she couldn't keep her feelings to herself forever. Especially since Sawyer might be leaving for college after he graduated. But, she wasn't sure she could do it. She would just have to judge it carefully. As she entered the aquarium, Phoebe came up to her. \"Hazel, you better get up to the dolphin pool. Our first show of the day is in just a little over an hour. Sawyer will be here soon.\" Hazel nodded. \"Okay. I'll head up there.\" She jogged up the stairs. When she reached the top of the stairs, she hurried to the railing above the pool. Winter and Hope quickly came to the surface, whistling and clicking. \"Hey, girls,\" Hazel said, \"How are you?\" Hope trilled loudly, and Winter gave a few quick clicks. \"We better get ready. We've got a show to do in a little while,\" Hazel said. Suddenly, she felt arms wrap around her. \"Yeah, we do,\" said a very familiar voice. Hazel smiled. She pulled out of those arms, then turned around, and there was Sawyer, smiling at her. \"How was your first day of school?\" Hazel asked. \"Not bad,\" said Sawyer, \"But that's not important. What's important is that I haven't seen Winter and Hope in a day, and I want some quality time with them.\" Hazel smiled. \"Well, then let's not waste time.\" The two of them smiled, then hurried into the pool. They had a very enjoyable day with Winter and Hope, and doing their shows for the day. When Hazel went to bed that night, she had dreams of her and Sawyer together, playing with Winter and Hope, and then spending an evening together on the beach, ending with them walking into the sunset. Even though she was still asleep, a smile crossed Hazel's face. And there is the end of this chapter. I know it has been so long since I started this story. I am getting into a Dolphin Tale phase. So, I hope to publish more chapters in the near future. For now, just review, and stay excited for future chapters. Raptor2216 out.[Chapter 3] Hello guys. Yes, I am back with another chapter. Don't really have anything to say. Let's get going. Chapter 3- A Date? Hazel jumped the final stair and landed on the floor. She hurried off to the dolphin pool viewing window. It only took a second for Hope to swim by, spinning as she went. Suddenly, she heard footsteps approaching her. Turning, she saw Sawyer approaching. It was currently Saturday, so Sawyer didn't have school. It was about noon, and there actually wasn't too many people at the aquarium. \"Hey, Hazel,\" said Sawyer. \"Hey,\" she responded. \"What you doing?\" he asked. \"Just watching Hope,\" she said. Sawyer joined her at the window to watch Hope swimming around. Right as he did, Winter swam into view as well. She came right up to window and looked at the two of them. Sawyer put his hand right up to the glass, and she pressed her beak to the glass. The two of them stood in that position for several moments before Winter backed up and swam after Hope. Sawyer and Hazel stood there for a moment in silence. Then, Sawyer said, \"Hey, since we don't have anything going on for like two hours, what do you say we go get some ice cream at Dairy Queen?\" Hazel smiled. She hoped she just looked like she enjoyed the idea, because inside, her stomach was turning. Sawyer had never asked her to go do something like this with him. She just hoped to death that her inner emotions weren't showing on her face. \"Sure. That would be nice. Let me go tell my dad so he knows where I'm going. I'll meet you out front,\" Hazel said. Sawyer nodded with a smile, then turned and walked towards the entrance. As Hazel hurried off to find her dad, she almost felt like shouting for joy. She had a date with Sawyer. Well, not really a date. He was just inviting her to go get some ice cream during their break. Still, they had never done something like this before, just the two of them. It didn't take her long to find her dad. He was upstairs watching the otters, especially one that had come in just a week ago. \"Hey. Dad,\" Hazel asked. He turned around to face her. \"Hey, sweetheart,\" Clay said. \"I have something I wanted to ask you. Since we don't have anything to do for a while, Sawyer asked me if I wanted to go get ice cream with him. Is that okay?\" Hazel asked him. Clay smiled. \"Sure. Go ahead. Make sure you're back here for the show though.\" \"I will,\" said Hazel, and she hurried off. As Clay turned back to look at the otters again, he smiled to himself. For a while, he had held suspicions that Hazel liked Sawyer, and he thought Sawyer might like Hazel. If Sawyer was asking Hazel to go get ice cream, maybe things would progress with those two after all. Hazel hurried down to the first floor. She hurried out of the front door, and saw Sawyer waiting by his van. He waved to her, and she hurried over. Sawyer smiled. \"Okay. Let's go.\" The two of them hopped in the van, and Sawyer drove off. It was a quick drive to Dairy Queen. They hopped out of the van once Sawyer turned it off, then walked into Dairy Queen. As they did, Sawyer saw his friend Daniel from school getting into his car. They waved to each other, then Daniel looked between him and Hazel and raised his eyebrows a few times while grinning. Sawyer glared at him a little, then followed Hazel inside. They ordered their ice cream, then walked outside to a table to eat it. As she licked her ice cream, Hazel felt so happy. Maybe they weren't on a date, but she was still getting some quality one-on-one time with Sawyer. \"How've you been doing with your schooling?\" Sawyer asked. \"Alright. It's been tougher than it's ever been, but,then again, it's my last year,\" Hazel responded. \"Are you going to go to college?\" Sawyer asked. \"I don't know. If I went to college, I wouldn't be able to spend as much time at the aquarium. Plus, I don't know what I would study that could help me at the aquarium that I don't already know. Still, it would be nice to be further my education,\" Hazel said. After a moment, Hazel said, \"What is your plan for college?\" \"I definitely want to go. I'm going to start looking into specific colleges soon,\" he responded. Hazel nodded. Then, with a smile, she said, \"Your 18th birthday is coming up. What are going to do for it?\" Sawyer returned the smile. \"I'm definitely having a party. I'm planning for it to be at the aquarium. My mom also promised to take me out to a special birthday dinner at whatever restaurant I want.\" Hazel smiled. \"That sounds nice.\" Then, with a bigger grin, she said, \"I'm sure Winter and Hope will like being able to go to your birthday party.\" Sawyer chuckled a little. \"True,\" he said. They chatted about a few more things. Then, when Sawyer finished his ice cream,and Hazel was nearly done, Sawyer said, \"Well,we better get going. If we hurry back, we can get some alone time with Winter and Hope before the show.\" Hazel nodded. They both got back into his van, Hazel still finishing her ice cream, and drove back to CMA. That is the end of that chapter. Yeah, I know it's short, but hopefully it's not bad. Next will feature Sawyer's 18th birthday and his party. Also, a quick note. I have published a new fanfiction I'm really excited by, and have big plans for. It's a crossover between Arrow and Star Wars. Go check it out. I plan on publishing chapters to this story regularly from now on. Next will be up in the next few days. Until then, review and tell me what you think of the story so far. Raptor2216 out.

Yzma masajeó sus sienes en un intento por disminuir el dolor de su cabeza. No era realmente efectivo. No sabía cómo responder a esa pregunta y no era por falta de información. Ella sabía lo que les ocurrió a los emperadores, más de lo que debía decir en voz alta por su propio bien. El problema era la reacción de Kuzko, podía imaginar la forma en que lo haría. Le dolía la cabeza de solo pensar en ello. —¡Los quiero ahora! ¡Ahora! —gritó Kuzo, no estaba acostumbrado a tener que repetir las cosas, menos a gritar. —¿Tienes hambre? —preguntó Yzma, si sonrisa era tan falsa que ni siquiera logró engañar a Kuzko. El pequeño hizo un puchero y reunió aire en sus pulmones, listo para llorar y gritar con todas sus fuerzas. No sabía que era lo que ocurría y como todo lo que no lograba entender, lo odiaba. —Puedes comer lo que quieres —agregó Yzma con voz cantarina, al ver que no funcionaba trató de pensar en algo más —. ¿Qué te parece un juguete? ¿Una llama de peluche? ¿una bicicleta nueva? Mientras Yzma le ofrecía a Kuzko juguetes, varios de los empleados ingresaban a esa habitación, dejando los objetos de los que Yzma había hablado. Al principio nada parecía funcionar, Kuzko seguía llorando y gritando, cada vez con más fuerza, incluso llegando a adquirir un tono morado en su rostro. —¡Quiero ahora! —Y yo quiero ser emperatriz, pero no siempre obtenemos lo que queremos —gruñó Yzma por lo bajo, para su buena fortuna, nadie entendió lo que dijo o simplemente no le prestaron atención. Kuzko hacía demasiado ruido. Los juguetes siguieron ingresando a la habitación. En pocos minutos había tantos juguetes que cubrían la mayor parte del suelo e incluso se formaron varias montañas. La mayoría eran peluches de animales o carros de juguete. También había un juego de ajedrez y una llama real; los dos últimos no podría usarlos por su corta edad. —¡Helado! ¡Traigan mucho helado! —ordenó Yzma, lamentando no tener ninguna dotación de veneno. Kuzko dejó de llorar en cuanto tuvo el helado frente a él. Sin usar una cuchara, se comió más de tres tazones. Nadie le habló de sus padres; no le importó. En su mente infantil creyó que todo estaría bien y que ellos regresarían antes de la cena; pero esto nunca ocurrió.

We don't know how to.\" \"Do I look like I'll always have the answer? Don't you know who you're talking to Emperor Kuzco!\" \"Yes sir.\" \"So do it yourself! I'm busy!\" \"Okay, sorry sir.\" The captain walked away. Kuzco looked back at his reflection and did a clicking sound to himself. It was a long day that Kuzco wanted to sit. He did have a good time yesterday at Kuzcotopia and wanted to rest for now. But many people kept coming to him. For sure someone did come back in the room. \"Emperor Kuzco!\" it was a small townsman. \"We need your help badly sir!\" \"Uh, no,\" said Kuzco rudely. \"But sir -\" \"I said no!\" That man left the room and again someone came inside. This time an elderly woman. Kuzco shooed her away as well. Then another person, then another and another. Kuzco told all of them to go away. With a sigh, Kuzco stood up and walked away from the throne. He went into the kitchen to wait for his breakfast and hoped that Kronk would give him something. For sure, Kronk did show up. \"Hello, your highness,\" said the big man. \"Why don't you give me some eggs buddy,\" said Kuzco while snapping his fingers. Kronk went to the stove and took out a carton of eggs. In town, there was definitely an accident. Many people were surrounding a circle around a llama that was stuck under a carriage. Some of them did try to calm the llama but only spat back. \"What are we to do?\" an old lady panicked. \"What do we do?\" \"There's nothing!\" said skinny man who also shaking. \"The emperor won't do anything.\" \"And the llama won't calm down!\" said another man. \"I know someone who can do this,\" said a teen boy who was also nervous. \"I'll go get him.\" The teen boy, who was think as a stick, ran to a market and found the man he was looking for. He gave the clerk money after paying for hay. \"Thank you sir,\" said the man in the green shirt. \"Pacha!\" yelled the teen boy! \"Hey Pacha!\" The man, Pacha, looked up and noticed the kid yelling at him. He walked to him. \"Hello,\" said he politely. \"Can you help us with something? The emperor won't do it.\" \"Kuzco? Is he still misbehaving?\" The teen gulped. \"What happened?\" \"There's a rogue llama in town under a carriage.\" He pointed to the scene and Pacha looked. Pacha was the answer to the solution. He managed to calm the llama by giving him some of the hay he bought and got the carriage off him. There was an applause. \"Thank you sir! Thank you Pacha!\" Pacha smiled modestly. \"You should be the emperor!\" It was the old lady from previously who said that. \"No, no,\" Pacha smiled. \"I can't handle that.\" \"But he's been very rude! I was up there and he would barely talk to me! Sonny, you have to talk to him!\" \"He's still doing wrong?\" said Pacha incredulously. Everybody around them nodded. \"Alright. I'll go talk to him.\" \"After that adventure you had with him, I know he'll listen to you.\" \"Alright ma'am.\" Again, the people gave an applause when Pacha walked up the stairs heading to the palace. Kuzco was still in the throne room but he looked at the village where his only friend lived. But this time he was thinking of moving his theme park to a different place than next to the town. \"Ah, why not?\" He moved the model of his park on the houses where his friend lived. \"Booyah!\" From his right side Kuzco saw the captain again. \"Excuse me your highness,\" said he. \"But someone is here to see you.\" \"Ah, not another townsfolk,\" Kuzco sighed. \"No, it's Pacha this time.\" Kuzco brightened when he saw his friend enter the room that he ran to him. \"What's this about you not helping the people?\" Pacha said to Kuzco sternly. \"Oh, you have to bring that up,\" Kuzco exhaled. \"It's none of my business. I've have other things to worry about.\" \"Kuzco, you're the emperor! It is your business. Your job! You said you were going to do more work but now you broke your promise?\" Kuzco laughed devilishly that made Pacha say angrily, \"How could you! It's not always about you Kuzco!\" \"Uh, yeah, it is!\" The captain came to them before Pacha could say another word. \"You might have to leave sir,\" said the captain. \"I can't believe Kuzco is back to his old behavior,\" Pacha sighed. \"I wasn't expecting it either but there's nothing we can do.\" \"Actually…\" Pacha started to remember someone he met in town. \"…there is. He would help.\" \"Who sir?\" \"Someone who came in town for vacation. I'll go get him.\" It took two days for Pacha to get the person he mentioned. Kuzco was still berating people who came to him that he'd rather look at himself in the mirror and have things served to him. Things could've been easier if he still had Yzma as his advisor but she had to leave after her betraying him. But no, now it's all up to Kuzco. If only his parents didn't die he wouldn't have to take the job and he would be living the high life of the rich. Being the rich and snobbish kid, Kuzco loved it. He might've had a change of heart earlier but it wasn't that long until his old self came back. Kuzco didn't like being the nice guy that it was too boring. Now things were starting to make sense. But that was going to change very soon. Back in the throne room on the second day, Kuzco was sitting on the throne when Pacha came in the room. Again, Kuzco was happy to see him that he swung down from the throne to Pacha. He thought Pacha was going to give him some good news to cheer him up but instead, \"No. That's not what this is about Kuzco.\" \"Then what is it?\" \"I want you to sit.\" \"Excuse me?\" \"I brought someone who can keep you in shape.\" \"To help me with the empire?\" \"Yes.\" Kuzco was looking at Pacha skeptically but did listen to him. He went to sit on the couch that was next to the town model. \"Who is this guy Pacha?\" Kuzco asked. \"Okay, to warn you,\" it seemed that Pacha was uncomfortable talking about the person. \"He's a motivational speaker and has been drinking coffee for four hours but he should be ready. And his name's Matt Foley.\" Kuzco looked at Pacha quizzically. \"I'll go get him.\" Pacha walked to the entrance. \"Matt, come on up!\" It didn't take that long for a short fat man to arrive. He was dressed in a plaid dress sweater with a white shirt and green tie such as tan dress pants. Along with it was big glasses and his hair was very greasy. He was pulling up his pants once he faced Kuzco. \"Alright how's everybody!\" he yelled in a loud voice but got into action. \"I don't know if Pacha's told you but I'll give you a little scenario about my life. First off, I am thirty-five years old, I am divorced, and I live in a van down by the river!\" Kuzco didn't know what to think about Matt Foley but thought he was crazy. \"Now as I've been told you've been a naughty boy to the town! I'm here to tell you that you're not going to get anywhere by not having any jack squat for the empire! So, right now you're thinking, 'Hey I'm gonna get the world by the tail and wrap it around, pull it down, and put it in my pocket'! But without the empire you'd be living in a van down by the river!\" Matt pulled up his pants again. \"Now young man what will you do with your life?!\" Kuzco had to think for a while and say, \"Well, I want to be famous.\" \"Well la de freakin' da!\" Matt yelled. \"We got another Kardashian here! Hey Pacha!\" He walked to him who was standing not that far. \"I can't see well, is that Kanye over there?\" \"Well Matt,\" said Pacha. \"Kuzco has admitted that so I've tried encouraging him into something peaceful, say like working with llamas.\" Matt looked at Pacha calmly at first with, \"Pacha, I wish you could just shut your big YAPPER!\" Matt screamed the last word that scared Pacha. \"Now, Kuzco!\" He again pulled up his pants and walked to Kuzco. Kuzco was trying not to look at Matt. \"From what I've heard, you've been using your fame not for the empire but for rolling doobies! You're going to be doing a lot of doobie rolling when you're living in a VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER! What do you want to do now?!\" \"I wanna live in a van down by the river,\" Kuzco replied sarcastically. Matt nodded with, \"Well you'll have plenty of time living in a van down by the river when…YOU'RE LIVING IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!\" Everybody in the room, including Kuzco was feeling bad but the captain was trying to hold his laughter. \"Now Kuzco, you're trying to think to yourself, 'Hey Matt! How can we get back on the right track'?\" Matt failed his arms around as if he were running. \"But now I'm seeing one solution. And that is for me to get my gear and move on here! Cause you and me. We're going to be buddies! We're going to be pals! We're gonna…\" Matt picked up Kuzco and mumbled, \"…wrestle around.\" He put Kuzco back on the couch. \"Old Matt's gonna be your shadow! Here's you, here's Matt! There's you, there's-\" Matt jumped and fell onto the table model of the town, breaking it. Everybody gasped. Matt was lucky he didn't get hurt that he was able to get up and again pulling up his pants. \"Oopsy daisy!\" Matt yelled. \"Oopsy daisy! My God! We're gonna have to clean that up later. Me and my buddy!\" He yelled at Kuzco. \"My pal, my amigo. Now I'm going to get my gear.\" Matt headed to the entrance of the room that Pacha and Kuzco rushed to him that Kuzco told him honestly, \"No, I won't disobey anymore!\" Pacha said to Matt, \"Thanks for all you've done.\" \"I don't give a rat's behind for anything 'cause I'm moving in,\" said Matt when he came back to them. \"I'm sick and tired of living in a VAN DOWN THE RIVER!\" It was too late for them to do anything. Kuzco was actually afraid of Matt that he said, \"Is he going to stay Pacha?\" \"I'm afraid so.\" Kuzco cried while Pacha hugged him. They didn't know the captain was gasping for air after his fits of laughter. Nobody heard him.

I'm Roxy Goth, this is my first time writing for Emperor's new groove. Takes place before the last scene of the movie – before the pool scene at the end. Basically, I found Kuzco's line 'It's my birthday gift to me!' interesting. Depending on whether I've got Kuzco's age wrong, this might be considered slight AU. I do not own Emperor's new groove or school in any way shape or form. \"You know it's Kuzco's birthday soon?\" Pacha asked his wife. Chicha looked at it and raised an eyebrow. \"Believe it or not I did.\" Pacha draw a shape on the table with his finger. \"Should we get him something?\" \"Oh, yeah sure. A solid gold locket or some extravagant spices?\" Pacha's lips twitched. \"I was thinking more a personalised Alpaca poncho.\" Chicha considered it, before asking. \"Are you sure that's what he wants?\" Pacha was about to say definitely, when he paused. \"You know what, I think I'll go up to the palace and ask him. Back in a bit honey.\" \"It can't be anything to extravagant!\" His wife called after him. \"I know our price range!\" Twenty minutes later he'd successfully track Kuzco down. The young emperor was currently party-planning with his advisor. \"Pacha!\" He said, waving a hand in greeting when the chief peasant walked through the door. \"How's it hanging?\" \"Fairly good.\" Pacha said, trying to sound as nonchalant as he could. \"Hey, could I have a word with you please?\" Kuzco leaned back in his chair and adopted his 'listening pose'. \"Sure, go ahead.\" Pacha gave a pointed look to the advisor. \"In private, maybe?\" \"Eh, sure.\" The emperor waved a hand dismissively and the advisor took his cue. \"Take a seat.\" Pacha did so, wondering why exactly this topic seemed so hard to approach. He decided to just go for it. \"What do you want for your birthday?\" He said, before wincing. That came out a bit blunter than he thought it would. Sure enough Kuzco looked startled for all of two seconds before his features melted back into that cool impassive look again. \"What do you mean?\" Pacha couldn't help sighing. For an emperor Kuzco could be dense sometimes. \"What gift would you like us to purchase for your birthday?\" He said, trying to put it in emperor-speak, before adding. \"That's in our price range.\" Kuzco leaned forward, still looking confused. \"It's all right, Pacha. I decided this year not to make the whole kingdom give me a gift this year. Or any year for the foreseeable future. Part of the whole trying-to-be-nice thing.\" If Kuzco had announced that three months ago – or even six weeks ago – Pacha would have been thrilled. However now he found himself saying. \"But it's your 18th! Your officially emperor now, out of all the years for big celebrations, this is it!\" \"Oh, don't get me wrong, there's going to be a big celebration. Yeah, I'm gonna have balloons, cake, music, I was even going to have Kronk do the food.\" \"Are you sure?\" \"Er, as long as Yzma's not allowed in the kitchen I'm happy. And you and your family can come, you know. If you want.\" Kuzco got up and wandered over to the window. Pacha smiled. He'd noticed on the rare occasions Kuzco tried to do something nice for him he'd look away or distract himself with something. Still smiling he got up and cleared his throat. \"That would be good. The kids would love that. Speaking of the kids they've been wondering what to get you.\" There, he'd try a different tactic. Kuzco scrunched his nose up. \"They don't have to get me anything. Seriously, it's fine.\" \"You sure?\" Pacha said, not bothering to hide his disbelief. \"Yeah!\" The young adult turned away from the window and spun towards the plans that still lay on the table. \"I mean, I've got the main gift anyway. A summerhouse, from me to me!\" Kuzco picked up the little model of the summerhouse and hugged it. The older man smiled. It was nice to see Kuzco showing genuine enthusiasm for something. But the smile faded as a new line of thought opened. \"Hey, why the getting a gift for myself thing anyway? I mean, you know that's not normal right?\" Not that anything Kuzco did was normal anyway. Kuzco's brow creased. \"I'm sorry, am I not allowed to get a gift for myself?\" The surly tone had crept back in. Pacha backtracked. \"No, of course you are, I'd just like to know why you think it's necessary. Didn't Yzma ever get you anything? You know, seeing as she was meant to be your guardian and everything?\" He instantly realised he's hit a nerve as Kuzco's hand clenched tighter around the model. \"No. She just said the same thing every year, 'Get what you want, Kuzco.'\" Kuzco's said, in a pretty decent impression of Yzma. \"After all, you are emperor. You're entitled to it. And at first it was just toys and junk you know? When I was younger. When I was thirteen I had a pool built into the palace basement. Heated floors and everything.\" He trailed of, clearly reminiscing, before sighing carefully putting the model down. \"I think I used it twice, maybe three times.\" \"Twice!?\" Pacha had managed to contain himself at the mention of toys, but a swimming pool? \"What happened to it?\" \"Oh, it's still there. Still there. It'd require a big cleanout if we ever wanted to use it…\" Pacha smiled. \"We?\" Kuzco froze, as if expecting lightning to strike him before saying, a tad defensively. \"Well, if you want to of course-\" \"-Hey, sounds good. So just to clarify, no presents?\" \"No presents. Except if you're gonna make me a homemade poncho\" Kuzco joked. \"But it's have to be green, of course.\" Pacha tried one last time. \"What do I tell the kids then?\" Kuzco paused, fingering the top of the model. \"Tell them the best gift they can give me is to turn up and try to eat as much as they can. This buffet isn't cheap you know. Is that it?\" Pacha blinked. \"Sorry?\" \"I said; is that it? It's just I have an awesome 18th to plan and an advisor waiting outside-\" \"-Oh! No problem! Right well, see you soon.\" As soon as Pacha was out the room he took a deep breath, before straitening up and heading home. He and Chicha had a poncho to make. ","Summary":" Hey!

Yzma's nostrils flared, as she struggled to calm down. \"Get down from there young man! Immediately!\" she demanded, as she thrust her finger towards the ground. Kuzco merely smirked at her arrogantly, before sticking his tongue out. Yzma's pale face was immediately flooded with red, as she lunged up the large throne. \"Get down here now!\" After much struggling on both parties' parts, Yzma managed to get her thin arms wrapped around the young man, tugging him down. He screamed and flailed, nearly hitting her several times. \"I am the EMPEROR ! I refuse to do as you say!\" he yelled valiantly, trying to make a break for it as soon as he was sat on the ground. However, Yzma didn't allow it, lunging after him immediately. \"I am your guardian! You will do as I say, Emperor or not!\" she muttered. They slowly made their way from the throne room Kuzco had ran into, Yzma dragging him along the entire time. Down several corridors they went, and through several different rooms. Eventually, Yzma came to a stop in a brightly lit room. It was sparsely furnished, only containing a swivel chair and a large mirror sitting on a desk. \"No! I refuse!\" Kuzco yelled right in Yzma's ear. She winced, before angrily sitting the boy down on the chair. He tried to escape, but once more, he was stopped by Yzma. She pulled a belt from the cushion of the chair, strapping it across his waist. Kuzco fumbled with the buckle, but was unable to unlatch it. Yzma nodded, smirking slightly as she turned to face the desk. \"You can't do this to me! I am the Emperor!\" he said again. Yzma raised an eyebrow, though she didn't turn back to the boy. \"No you're not.\" \"Not yet!\" he whined. \"Exactly,\" Yzma muttered, sounding vaguely amused. Kuzco huffed slightly, before sinking down in his seat and pouting. Several minutes later, Yzma turned around, quickly flinging a plastic sheet around Kuzco's shoulders. He immediately began fighting his restraint once again, but his hands were unable to escape the sheeting. Yzma stood waiting. When Kuzco sighed heavily, defeated, she approached him, the sharp silver object in her hand glinting ominously. Kuzco waited until Yzma was gripping a strip of his hair, before freaking out once more. Yzma yelped in shock - however, she was determined to complete the task she started, reluctant little boy or no. \"Be still!\" she growled in frustration. The boy only fought harder. \"Never!\" Afterwards, Yzma yanked the sheet off him, quickly undoing the buckle. Her face was pinched, obviously annoyed. Kuzco hopped down from the chair, clutching at his hair desperately. \"What did you do to me?!\" he exclaimed in panic. Kuzco's hair was horribly uneven, and half of it was sticking up in an odd fashion. One chunk was completely sheered from his head, the tiny bit of hair that was left being extremely short and spiky. \"I cut your hair,\" Yzma replied. \"It's horrible!\" Yzma raised an eyebrow, walking towards the exit of the room. \"I told you to be still.\" She couldn't help but smirk when she heard the little brat scream, \"My hair! My beautiful hair!\" A/N I just have a feeling that Kuzco got brattier the older he got. So here's a cute and funny one-shot!

Así que aquí está la historia de Kuzca... *Kikim le da una merecida bofetada*, perdón, de Kikim :3 Por supuesto que siendo mi OC, la niña no iba a nacer normal, ¡ninguno de mis OC's lo hace! Algún día optaré por el clásico de \"la miel, las flores y las abejas\"... pero ese día no es hoy :3 IMPORTANTE: Un gran agradecimiento para mis amigas y compañeras fanfikers: Est Fragmentum, Moon Erebos y Yusefan Halackti Fanny Alejo, quienes me ayudaron a escojer un nombre para esta pequeñaja. Si no fuera por ellas, Kikim nunca habría tenido un nombre decente :D Ahora, por favor, disfrutar de la historia. Espero sea de vuestro agrado :3 — MINI-KUZCO — 1 Cinco años. Cinco largos, cinco soporíferos, cinco insufribles años. Ah, la humilde vida del plebeyo... sin duda Kuzco nunca la iba a echar de menos... puede que un poco. Casi nada. Pero algo... ¡Eso cuenta! ¡Aunque ya no importa! Kuzco ya paso sus años de instituto, ahora convertido en un hombre joven de veintitres años, vuelve a ser legalmente Emperador. ¿Qué bien, verdad? Pues tampoco es que haya mucha diferencia para con antes, solo es el mismo crio malcriado con cinco años más... ¡ah, sí! Y todo ese rollo Pachá le grabó a fuego sobre amistad, lealtad, las buenas intenciones sin esperar nada a cambio y bla, bla, bla... ¡vamonos ya a la parte buena! Cinco años. Sin contar con los dieciocho años anteriores, cinco años. ¡Tuvo cinco desesperantes y llenos de fracasos años! ¡Con sus 1.826 días y sus 423.824 horas! Todo ese tiempo tuvo a Kuzco en la palma de su mano, rebajado a un simple estudiante de secundaria y teniendo que vivir en casa del jefe de la aldea como un vulgar plebeyo y, la parte que más le gustaba, con su paso al palacio vedado. ¡Vedado! Mientras ella lo tenía enteriiiiito para si misma... ¡Y AUN ASÍ NO PUDO ASESINAR A KUZCO! — ¡Todo es tu culpa, Kronk, gorila sin cerebro! —la momia..., err, digo Yzma, descargó la furia que eso le provocaba volcando una de las mesas de su laboratorio \"secreto\", con tubos de ensallo y todo. Los cuales se rompieron nada más hacer contacto con el suelo. — ¿Mía por qué? —se quejó el pobre de Kronk, que no era capaz de entender el ramalazo de furia de la anciana. La mujer estaba que echaba humo por las orejas, se acercó a su ayudante con su cara de siempre, la de pocos amigos... para sorpresivamente lanzarle una sonora bofetada. — ¡Auch, eso dolio! —lejos de tratar defenderse o de devolver el golpe, Kronk hizo un infantil y desvalido puchero mientras se sobaba la mejilla afectada. — ¡Y MÁS QUE TE VA A DOLER! —rugió ella, fuera de si— Todo este tiempo estudiaste con él, salias de acampada con él, siempre erais enviados al aula de castigo a la vez. ¡Lo hacíais todo juntos! Siempre estabas con él. ¡Era tan fácil como clavarle un cuchillo por la espalda en cuanto menos se lo esperase y pufff, problema resuelto! Kronk se rascó la nuca. — No te sigo —dijo el hombre, provocando que Yzma se llevase las manos a la cabeza. Solo cinco años más, solo cinco años más...— ¿De quién hablas? — ¡POR SUPUESTO DE KUZCO! —explotó Yzma, la frase reverberando por todas las paredes del laboratorio. Como detestaba la memoria de pez de Kronk. Él por su parte parpadeó un par de veces, perdido, para después alzar las cejas. ¿Por qué Yzma tenía que decir siempre cosas tan raras? — ¿Por qué iba yo a matar a Kuzco? Es mi mejor amigo, aparte del Sr. Ardilla, claro. Claro, como no, manda al imbécil a hacer el trabajo sucio y el imbécil irá y se hará amigo del objetivo, pero de verdad. Un clásico. — ¿Qué por qué...? ¡Kronk, tú trabajas para mi! ¡Y yo odio a Kuzco, se interpone entre el trono y yo! ¡Así que si yo te digo que mates a Kuzco, tú no cuestionas y lo haces! ¿O es qué no quieres cobrar? Kronk abrió desmesuradamente sus ojos. — Espera, ¡¿tú odias a Kuzco?! —exclamó alarmado, como si se hubiera dado cuenta justo ahora y nunca lo hubiera sabido. Oh, sí, realmente odiaba al estúpido Kronk y su estúpida memoria de pez. — P-p-pero... ¡tú cuidaste a Kuzco desde que era un bebé! ¡Se supone que deberías quererle! ¿Por qué tenía Kronk que recordarle su mayor fallo del pasado? ¡Sí, ella crió a Kuzco! Pegó un gran resbalón, fue débil, pero vaya si no hizo un gran trabajo criando a un malcriado déspota... que mala suerte que fuera justo el detalle de haberle hecho un déspota que Kuzco se fue en su contra y ya no le quedaba más remedio que matar a su mayor creación... pero sin duda el detalle de que el joven ya no fuera tan malcriado ni tan déspota como antaño por culpa del metido de Pachá, le dolía más. ¡Había mancillado su creación con pureza y buenas intenciones! ¡Maldito seas, campesino! Pero ella era lista, erró una vez. Ya no más. Nunca volvería a caer bajo el embrujo de los bellos ojos de un bebé de nuevo. Se lo había prometido a si misma... Aunque claro, también se había prometido acabar con Kuzco lo más rápido posible y cinco años después aun estaba sin resultados... pero era culpa de Kronk. — Acercate, voy a contarte un pequeño \"secreto\" —le dijo con falsa calma. Sí, secreto de dominio público. — ¡Hou, un secreto, un secreto! —Kronk dio palmadas, emocionado— ¡Gane una insignia al mejor guardando secretos cuando era Inca-scout! Yzma rodó los ojos, ni que le interesara su vida. Kronk se acercó unos pasos a ella y se puso a su altura, con los ojos brillantes de la emoción. — Más cerca... sí, ahí, perfecto: ¡YO MATÉ A LOS PADRES DE KUZCO, CABE ESO EN TU CABEZA LLENA DE AIRE! Como si no fuese obvio. — ¡¿QUÉ?! —exclamó separándose de ella, de lo más alarmado, pero luego se tranquilizó—... Tiene sentido, pero ¿por qué? No había duda, Yzma se merecía con creces ganar una insignia a gramola para tener que repetirle siempre la misma cantinela. — ¡PARA SER EMPERATRIZ, KRONK, QUIERO SER EMPERATRIZ! ¡LA CORONA EN MI CABEZA! ¡EN LA MIA, NO EN LA SUYA! —dicho eso agarró un mazo, con el que hizo añicos sin piedad uno de los mil millones de bustos con la cara del joven emperador. — ¡Ah, claro, lo de siempre! —al fin Kronk comprendía, los ojos brillandole en reconocimiento— No sé donde tengo hoy la cabeza. — Para empezar no tienes cabeza —susurró Yzma, con ese último grito casi se había quedado afónica. — ¿Qué? —quiso saber él, que no había escuchado, tan acostumbrado que estaba a los gritos de la mujer. — ¡QUE NO TIENES CABEZA, BESUGO! — Wow, wow, wow —Kronk movió las manos, tratando de tranquilizarla—. Gritas mucho, ¿sabias? Tiiipico. A Yzma le entró un tic en el ojo. — ¿Sabes qué? Vete, mejor vete y ve a ver que es lo que está haciendo Kuzco —dijo lo primero que se le ocurrió para no tener que verle delante—. No sé, quedate con sus puntos débiles y esas cosas. A estas alturas ya dudaba que los tuviera. — ¡En seguida! —exclamó emocionado haciendo un salido militar, para después desaparecer como alma que lleva el diablo. Viéndose sola, Yzma volvió a colocar la mesa volcada en su sitio, para seguidamente darse repetidos golpes en la cabeza con ella. ¡Matar a sus padres fue estúpidamente fácil! ¡Intentar acabar con él se había cconvertido en un dolor de muelas para un plebeyo! Por mucho que molestará, no había manera de deshacerse de él. ¿Por qué demonios Kuzco no quería morir? Vamos, por ella, que lo crió cuando no tenía porque. Gruñó iracunda. Ah, aquellos hermosos años en los que Kuzco era un niño del que se encargaban las niñeras reales y ella gobernaba el Imperio por él. ¡La vida perfecta, había sido tan feliz! Pero al maldito se le dio por crecer y reclamar el trono \"que le pertenecía por derecho\", como si fuera tan fácil como decir \"¡Ya voy a cumplir dieciocho años, ese es mi trono! Fuera, momia esquelética\". De hecho, así de fácil había sido. Podría haberle manejado, claro que sí, ¡pero tuvo que aparecer Pacha y enseñarle a valerse por si mismo! ¡Adios a su marioneta perfecta! Y ahora la marioneta no quería ser tirada a la basura. La vida era tan cruel. Si solo Kuzco nunca hubiera conocido a Pacha, si el joven siguiera comiendo de la palma de su mano, como antaño... Yzma levantó rapidamente la cabeza de la mesa con una gran sonrisa macabra dividiendo su rostro. Lo que consiguió de forma natural en 18 años... podía agilizar el tiempo con sus antiguas habilidades y conseguirlo en un día. ¡Era genial, genial, genial! Sin perder un segundo más, la mujer se puso manos a la obra, ansiosa. Kuzco, preparate para ser destronado por tu propia esencia. Kronk nunca había tenido problemas para desplazarse dentro del palacio. Antaño había sido el hecho de ser el ayudante de la consejera real lo que le abría las puertas del ostentoso, muy alto y dorado lugar con forma de rostro humano, sin tener necesidad de darle ninguna explicación a los guardias. Ahora, desde que Kuzco regresó con el graduado escolar, una sonrisa triunfal imborrable en su cara y un pie bastante colérico con el que él mismo lanzó a Yzma de una patada por la ventana, era el hecho de ser buen amigo del emperador lo que le abría las puertas. El joven de sangre real no era idiota, sabía que Yzma seguía con sus andadas en su laboratorio \"secreto\" y que Kronk todavía estaba con ella es sus ratos libres, pero tenía suficiente confianza en que la estratosférica estupidez de Kronk era un impedimento fiable de que pudiera ocurrirle realmente algo malo a su real persona, como siempre había sido. La verdad, no sabía porque Yzma aun lo aguantaba, si era quien le fastidiaba todos sus planes. Su real persona lo admitía a su lado, solo porque el cocinero, explorador, sirviente del \"mal\", recien graduado y tonto oficial del Imperio era un tipo gracioso y tampoco es que hubiera tenido mucha vida social en su larga experiencia como chico corriente, aparte de él y Malina. Por eso y solo por eso le aguantaba, o eso es lo que quería creer, antes de aceptar de que lo quería a su lado porque en esos cinco años Kronk se había convertido en un amjjjj... en un amigjjjj... en eso que el resto de pobres mortales valora sabe Inti porque. El hombre entró en la sala real tarareando alguna canción de los Inca-Scouts. Tan jovial como Pedro por su casa, subió las exageradas escaleras hasta el trono en tres zancadas y se colocó al lado del trono de Kuzco, quien se había dado cuenta de su presencia, pero ni se digno a girar la cabeza y saludarle. No había nadie al lado del emperador, descontándole a él en ese mismo momento. Kuzco ya no tenía consejera, no se había preocupado por encontrar otra, pues sentía que no necesitaba más consejera que su propia cabeza, que al igual que el resto de él era algo prodigioso, o eso se creía en todo su ego. Muchos dentro del palacio le temían a esa decisión, Kuzco había madurado, sí, pero no lo suficiente. Aun así, ¿quién es el lindo que se atreve a expresarlo en palabras? — ¡Hey, Kuzco, amigo! —¡esa era la palabra! ... Sonaba horrible. Un Kuzco de veintres años, medio tumbado, casi hundido en el mantón azul de su trono, los ojos hundidos en extremo aburrimiento, siguió sin dignarse a juntar miradas con Kronk. En vez de ello, estiró pesadamente su brazo en un gesto que habría sido altanero, si no hubiera estado taaaan aburrido. — No ahora, Kronk —musitó el emperador con un suspiro de reproche, el que le faltaba— ¿Qué no ves qué estoy atendiendo las exigencias de Tipo? No estoy para aguantarte. — Emm... ¿majestad? —murmuró el pobre hombre que estaba a los pies del trono del joven emperador—, me llamo Chiko, no Tipo. — ¡Tu nombre no le interesa a nadie! —exclamó Kuzco en un exabrupto, que le hizo levantar parcialmente el trasero de su trono, haciéndole ver más o menos amenazante desde esa altura. Kronk se echó unos pasos hacía atrás con el rostro teñido de sorpresa. El pobre Chiko también se echó hacía atrás, lleno de pavor, encogido sobre si mismo. Kuzco, de repente consciente de que había estado mal lo que dijo, se permitió tomar dos respiraciones lentas, para calmar sus nervios y se volvió a hundir en el trono con muy poca gracia. Se había pasado toda la mañana escuchando a los campesinos y ya le estaba hartando. Pero no podía simplemente cancelar las citas y dejar que se fueran acumulando, él ya no era ese Kuzco libre de remordimientos (y los remordimientos eran jodidos, insoportables, no le gustaba sentirlos)... Como le gustaría volver a ser ese Kuzco, ese cuyos ojos solo veían los glamurosos derechos que le otorgaba su estatus, en vez de sus agotadores deberes que ya no podía pasar por alto, si no quería aguantar, una vez más, la mirada decepcionada de Pacha, ese placebo de padre. Le hubiera gustado que esa mirada y todo lo que había implícito en ella le importase un comino, pero para esos nuevos ojos esa mirada era importante. Si pudiera volver atrás en el tiempo se habría cargado esa idea suya de Kuzco-Topia y nunca habría conocido al campesino (también habría sido asesinado por Yzma, pero había aprendido que nada era perfecto, ni tan siquiera él, a regañadientes lo había aceptado). Pero no se podía volver hacía atrás, así que Chiko pagaba el pato por abrir la boca. — Disculpa —agradecía que esa palabra ya no le quemase la boca... demasiado, Chicha realmente había hecho milagros como placebo de madre—. Continúa con tus exigencias, son muy interesantes. Por mucho que eso chocara con lo anterior y lo que decía su rostro. El campesino se tranquilizó, volvió a abrir la boca y... — ¿Qué Tipo no es el nombre del hijo de Pacha? —recordó Kronk de pronto. — Callate —siseo Kuzco entre dientes, no dispuesto a admitir que extrañaba su vida en la casa del hombre con su esposa e hijos de forma demasiado inconsciente. La única familia que había tenido. Kronk no era tonto... para lo que le interesaba. Se dio cuenta de esa \"debilidad\" y la anotó mentalmente... realmente tenía ahí mucho espacio libre para anotar cosas. — ¿Sabes qué, Chiko? ¡Es suficiente! —sentenció el emperador, de repente en tono jovial, con muchas ganas de darle el carpetazo. Bajó del trono y se puso a su altura, Kronk le siguió desde atrás. Kuzco no se lo pensó dos veces para posar su real mano en el hombro del hombre... pero tampoco apretó. Nunca apretaba y más le valía al campesino no devolverle el contacto. — Pronto tus terrenos serán vallados —le aseguró con una sonrisa fingida. Lo haría, claro que daría la orden, pero eso no le obligaba a estar entusiasmado por ello. — Lo que quería era trabajar más terreno... —musitó el hombre, no queriendo que el emperador le volviera a gritar. — ¡Mas terreno, entonces! —Kuzco le dio un par de palmadas amistosas... y una tercera lo suficientemente fuerte, no para hacer daño, pero sí para captar el mensaje— No lo olvidaré. Chiko asintió, se despidió con una reverencia y salió casi corriendo de la sala. El rostro jovial de Kuzco se desfiguró y formó una mueca mirando hacía la salida por la que había desaparecido Chiko. Soltó un gritó desesperado sin importar que el sonido sobrepasara las paredes ni que Kronk estuviera delante. Ningún guardia se sobresaltó. Sabían que el emperador no corría peligro, lo que pasaba es que era un caprichoso frustrado. — ¡No estamos en guerra con nadie! ¡No hay hambruna! ¡El sol luce por encima de nuestras cabezas! ¡No hay delincuencia (aparte de Yzma)! ¡Los campos dan una siembra perfecta! ¡Los vejestorios están tan activos como jóvenes y tardan en morir! ¡VIVIR AQUÍ ES UN SUEÑO! —tomó con sus manos la túnica de Kronk y lo zarandeó cuan grande era, usándole de placebo como juguete anti estrés. Después se derrumbó sobre él— ¡Y aun así tienen quejas...! Tantas quejas. Nunca se sacian —jadeó frustrado mientras se separaba de Kronk, decidiendo ignorar el pinchazo de culpabilidad porque eso le había recordado su insaciable sed de caprichos inútiles de antaño— Amo mi Imperio, ¡pero odio mi Imperio! — Eso no tiene sentido, ¿lo odias o lo amas? —el más grande y con menos cerebro de los dos puso una pose pensativa durante unos momentos, temiendo que si tuviera sentido pero él no era suficientemente inteligente como para encontrárselo... y así era— Me rindo, no doy más de mi. El emperador le miró fijamente, cuan acostumbrado estaba a esa frase... De repente Kronk era un estorbo a su karma mental. Quería estar solo para poder autocompadecerse de si mismo a gusto, maldita fuera. — ¿Qué se te ha perdido, Kronk? La montaña de músculos casi consiguió formar un signo de interrogación con su cara. — ¿A mi? Nada, ¿me falta algo? —comenzó a palparse la túnica algo nervioso... como si esta tuviera bolsillos en los que hubiera podido guardar algo, en primer lugar. Kuzco se sintió tentado a iniciarse al mundo de la bebida estupidizante llamada alcohol al ver en acción a tan patético ser... no por primera vez. Decidió cambiar esa tentación simplemente sentándose al pie de la escalinata de oro, suspirar furibundo y girar levemente la mirada en gesto hosco de rechazo. Sabia decisión. \"Sí, te falta un cerebro... considerando que a lo mejor alguna vez lo tuviste\" —pensó, siendo lo suficientemente cortés para no decirlo en voz alta. Uno pensaría que después de cinco años asistiendo a clases con ese sujeto, te acabarías acostumbrando a sus miras tan cortas. Pues no. ¿Cómo demonios Kronk consiguió pasar los cursos y graduarse, solo repitiendo curso la misma vez que él lo hizo? Todo eso apestaba a plan de la momia de Yzma. Uno fallido, pues seguía entero. — Quería decir, ¿por qué estás aquí? — ¡Ah! Eso tiene mucho más sentido —antes de que el otro tuviera oportunidad de juntar miradas, Kronk se apresuró a sentarse en el suelo, frente a él, quedando ambos rostros a la misma altura. Regla número uno del emperador Kuzco: ¡NO SE TOCA! Regla número dos: Nunca des la impresión de ser más alto que él (a no ser que lo seas, pues eso no tiene caso). Kronk tenía esas reglas grabadas a fuego en su mente, pero tendría que modernizarse, pues esas eran las reglas del anterior Kuzco. Este Kuzco tenía mayores preocupaciones a que se diera la impresión de ser inferior a alguien por el mero hecho de haberse sentado; y le importaba lo mismo que Kronk se sentará en el suelo a que de repente saliera despedido por los aires sin explicación lógica. Nada. De hecho, estuvo tentado a llamar a los guardias y ordenar que lo lanzasen por una ventana, pero algo dentro de él se lo impidió. ¿Sentido común? No, arrepentimiento adelantado por haberse atrevido a desear eso. Kronk tenía algo de importancia para él. Nada tangible hecho de oro y brillantes ni eso, pero... algo. — Pues trato de averiguar tus puntos débiles para decírselos a Yz... —la ceja enarcada de Kuzco y la risilla que este no pudo contener hicieron a Kronk darse cuenta de que le estaba largando al emperador algo que no le debería estar largando. Upps. Casi le decía a Kuzco sobre los maléficos deseos de Yzma (¿casi?)— ¡Quiero decir! Solo quería pasar algo de tiempo con mi buen amigo, Kuzco. \"Lo he clavado\" —pensaba para si, creyendo que había enmendado bien y rápido su error. — ¡No me digas! —exclamó el larguirucho de pronto— ¿estas deprimido? — No, la verdad es que soy muy feliz —aseguró Kronk con una sonrisa. No entendía a que venía eso pero agradecía la pregunta. — ¡Entonces no tengo que soportarte, fuera! —y para hacer énfasis señaló la salida. — Pero, ¿por qué? —Kronk se veía perdido. — Porque no estas deprimido, por lo cual no estoy obligado por nuestra relación de amijj... amissjjjj... ¡tad! ¡amistad!, eso, a levantarte el animo porque no lo necesitas. ¡Por lo que adiós! —no había duda, si quieres un buen amigo, relacionate con Kuzco—. Aun tengo que dar las ordenes para cumplir con las suplicas de los campesinos, pasarlas ante notario para que se cumplan, ¡y así verme genial! Y necesito hacerlo antes de que se me olvide alguna, por lo que sea. — ¿Y por qué no simplemente las apuntas? Así no se te olvidarán. Era un idiota, un reverendo idiota, por eso el de sangre real odiaba cuando el sentido común de ese reverendo idiota superaba al suyo, pocas veces, pero eso fastidiaba bastante. — No hay suficiente papel en el Imperio, Kronk —respondió como excusa de forma cortante, ocultando lo tonto que se sentia porque a él no se le hubiera ocurrido eso tan simple que caía de cajón. — Pues ordena que fabriquen más —rebatió el otro de forma inocente, en verdad eso no había sido con segundas. Kuzco se levantó frotandose las sienes, dándose a si mismo paciencia. — He dicho que fuera —prefería darle carpetazo a tratar de explicarle el significado y el uso de la ironía. Más que nada porque lo último le llevaría toda la vida. Pero para cuando la masa de músculos se levantó disponiéndose a irse, un hombre bajito y gordo apareció en la sala. Kuzco bufo sonoramente ante la presencia del mismo tipo como-se-llame que en su tiempo de estudiante no dejaba de recordarle que bajara sus humos y su altivez, pues ya no era un emperador... pero ahora volvía a serlo... al parecer eso no era suficiente para librarse del hombre... — Disculpad la intromisión, Mi Emperador —Kuzco mostró una sonrisa felina por eso, que bien sentaba que los que se aprovecharon de él cuando era un cualquiera volvieran a agachar la cabeza y poner el rabo entre las piernas en su presencia. Esta vez no por nacimiento, si no porque se había ganado el estatus del pico de la pirámide social por méritos propios—, pero el nuevo lote de jóvenes casaderas ha llegado. La sonrisa se fue de nuevo. Lote. Ese hombre había comparado a esas chicas con un simple lote, como quien vende un 2x1 de fruta en el mercadillo. — Te ordeno que tengas más respeto por las mujeres —sentenció Kuzco de manera siseante. No supo exactamente como pasó, pero Malina y su portentosa inteligencia siempre habían sido buenas a la hora de atar a Kuzco con la cuerda corta para casi cualquier cosa. La joven campesina había entrado en la vida del emperador pisando fuerte, haciéndose respetar, y pisando fuerte se había quedado. Y siendo como era la única joven que el emperador conocía realmente, en su inconsciencia ella era la representación del resto de mujeres. Seres inteligentes que pisaban fuerte y que más valía hacerles caso, o lo pagabas caro. Kuzco todavía tenía en su cuerpo lindos recuerdos de eso en forma de moretones, sobretodo en su cabeza. Por supuesto, no todas eran así, pero Malina lo era, Chicha lo era y Chica estaba en camino de serlo ¿qué más necesitaba para probar su teoría? (Yzma por supuesto estaba descartada, ella no era una mujer, era un bicho). El hombre como-se-llame se refrotó las manos, nervioso y algo azorado. — Como guste, Mi Emperador, pero... ya es momento de elegir esposa, le están esperando. El momento fue hace cinco años, en realidad, pero ahí seguían. Con Kuzco profundamente enamorado de su soltería. Cierto fue que por dos años Malina le hizo perder el norte, pero con el paso del tiempo (y de muchos, muchos, muchos, pero muchos, rechazos cortantes), fue perdiendo el interés en ella hasta desistir. Ahora ya no sentía más que una amistad por ella y lo agradecía. ¡Seguiría disfrutando de su soltería, costara lo que costara, ninguna mujer del mundo le merecía! (lo que en otras palabras se podría deducir que la chica le había castrado algo más que su personalidad altiva, bien y con arte). — No estoy interesado, diles que lo lamento mucho, aunque no sea cierto, pero han perdido el tiempo —le deshechó con un movimiento de muñeca. — ¡Pero majestad...! —el hombre no pudo evitar el gallo que le salió al obligarse a si mismo a morderse la lengua, si no quería salir despedido por la ventana. ¿En dónde quedaron los últimos buenos años en los que podía golpear al chico en la cabeza con sus papeles cuándo no le ponía atención? Desde luego detestaba que esa cabeza estuviera de nuevo coronada, si aun no se atrevía a trabajar como era debido. — ¡No me casaré! —estalló Kuzco, tomándolo por los hombros y elevándolo en el aire para zaradearle un tanto— Ni ahora, ni mañana, ni nunca. No pienso convertir en emperatriz a una completa desconocida. Convierte eso en una proclama real, listillo. El hombre no supo si le estaba retando, o si se lo estaba ordenando. Esperaba fuera lo primero. No se atrevió a preguntar. — Pero majestad, necesitáis descendencia... Kuzco se quedó helado por un momento y luego lo bajo lentamente al suelo. — ¿De qué hablas? —se le notaba perdido. Detestaba sentirse perdido. Por eso como-se-llame sintió esa pregunta como un \"habla ahora o muere\", sobretodo por como le miraba el joven. Pero Kuzco había aprendido que valía la pena escucharle... algunas veces. Como-se-llame sin duda no se esperaba eso. Creía que el hecho caía de cajón. Kronk, todavía presente y bastante interesado en la escena, le tomó el relevo y habló por él. — Creo que trata de decir que debes tomar una esposa para tener un hijo con ella y así tener tu línea sucesoria asegurada —aseguró Kronk de forma tranquila, luego se encogió de hombros—. O puede que no, suelo equivocarme en estas cosas. Demasiado tarde, Kuzco se puso pálido de repente y abrió su boca en una legítima expresión de horror, la cual en segundos se transformó en una de tremendo asco. Observó al bajito hombre que se retorcía las manos, deseando tener el poder de asesinar con la mirada. — Tú pretendías que yo... con una de esas vulgares... —¿quién era quien no respetaba a las mujeres ahora? Bah, tranquilas féminas del mundo, es así con todos quienes no sean su reflejo. Pero su sorpresa era del tamaño de Imperio entero. Desde que habían comenzado a meterle prisa para desposar a una mujer, tenía la oscura y absurda idea de que lo hacían porque querían ver coronada a una sustituta suya y que no le querían a él de emperador... Después de que fue echado del palacio esa percepción errónea solo se intensificó... Incluso su enamoramiento por Malina había sido puramente platónico... nunca se le había pasado por la cabeza...— ¡DYUUUUUHHHH! ¡Asqueroso pervertido! — Mi Emperador, si me permitís, creo que estáis sacando las cosas de quicio sin... — ¿Quién te crees que eres para desear el fin de la pureza de mi Hercúleo cuerpo? —Kuzco no le escuchaba y menos mal que no lo hacía o habría sido peor— ¡Fuera! ¡No te quiero volver a ver en mi vida! ¡GUARDIAS! Dos armarios de hombres con el cuerpo totalmente pintado de rojo y azul aparecieron a la velocidad de la luz y agarraron a como-se-llame cada uno por un hombro y lo elevaron en el aire sin dificultad, esperando ordenes. Kuzco se acercó peligrosamente al hombre pálido e inmovilizado. ¡Él solo hacía su trabajo! — No existe nadie, ¿entiendes?, nadie merecedor de tal privilegio como lo es pasar una noche conmigo. ¡NADIE! El pobre por poco se queda sordo, era un milagro que no hubiera sido así — Esposas a mi... —masculló entre dientes— Guardias, arro... — ¡Espera! —antes de que Kuzco pudiera decir \"arrojadle al agujero más profundo que encontréis, después de hacerlo más profundo\", una bombilla se encendió en la mente del hombre de baja estatura. Suspiró aliviado para sus adentros cuando Kuzco enarco una ceja, más interesado que herido en su orgullo por eso— Me he equivocado, su majestad, lo siento, las damas que esperan no aspiran a ser sus esposas, si no... ¡sus consejeras! Esperaba realmente que se creyera esa mentira. Pasaron unos terribles segundos de silencio en la sala, solo roto por Kronk en su propio mundo, tarareando algo que parecía ser algo así como \"tock tiqui-ti tock\". — Guardias, soltadle —terminó por ordenar el larguirucho— y retiraos. Estos hicieron lo mandado, dejando que el otro aterrizara de culo sin ninguna consideración. Kuzco se meso unos cuantos mechones de su media melena negra como boca de lobo, mientras el otro se ponía difícilmente en pie. Al final lo consiguió porque Kronk se apiadó de él y le extendió una mano. — ¿Consejeras? Creí haber dicho que no quería ninguna sustituta de Yzma, con solo una momia loca detrás de mi deseando enterrarme es mas que suficiente. — Lo sabemos, su majestad, pero... —¡por Inti! ¿En qué se estaba metiendo? Piensa cerebro, piensa— La noticia de que el puesto estaba vacante se extendió como la pólvora... y se presentaron aquí... eran demasiadas, Mi Emperador. — Eran demasiadas, eran demasiadas... —repitió Kuzco de manera denigrante, chasqueando su lengua en disgusto, ¿qué le había hecho Yzma a su sistema de seguridad?— ¿y por qué dijiste jóvenes casaderas, huh? — Supongo que fue la fuerza de la costumbre, Mi Emperador. Otros tres segundos de silencio incómodo. — ... Está bien, ¡hora de hacer entrevistas de trabajo! —estaba muerto si su cerebro dejaba de trabajar así de rápido. Kuzco apretó el paso, de repente ansioso. ¿Otra consejera? No quería a ninguna realmente, pero ya que se lo ofrecían delante de las narices... La cosa prometía. Como-se-llame le siguió el paso esperando que su mentira improvisada no se descubriera. El emperador dijo que no convertiría a una desconocida en la emperatriz. Tal vez, si solo tal vez, tenía la suerte de que el joven se enamorase de la que fuera a elegir como \"consejera\" con el paso del tiempo (cosa altamente improbable, si se me permite decir) y la desposaba a pesar de sus duras palabras, a lo mejor el Imperio Inca podia llegar a tener un heredero al trono. Esperaba que la chica escogida, si es que iba a haber una, ojalá sí, le siguiera el paripé. Aunque era algo arriesgado, se había vuelto una salida indispensable. Nadie sospechaba de que ese día en que Kuzco iba a tener descendencia, el cual parecía muy alejado en el tiempo, en realidad estaba a la vuelta de la esquina. La magia se concentraba en el laboratorio. Oscura, pesada, una con la que nunca se debe coquetear, a no ser que vayas en serio. Magia de los muertos que deseaban desesperadamente volver a la vida, poco les importaba ya si lo hacían a las ordenes de una horrible mujer, solo querían recuperar lo que les fue vedado tan cruelmente, volver a respirar, tener una vida... Aunque fueran a suplantarla. Estaban listos, todos juntos se habían fundido en una sola alma, una sola mente, un solo corazón. El resultado de esa fusión deseaba hacerlo, solo necesitaba un cuerpo. Yzma lo crearía. Un cuerpo para él, el cual sería el vivo retrato de Kuzco, a cambio de su fidelidad. Todo por la corona. — Pronto, querido, pronto —Yzma acunó un frasco entre sus manos. Parecido al resto, pero distinto, más pequeño. Una sola gota. Lo mejor siempre viene guardado en pequeño, más que nada porque es caro y mejor era no gastar mucho. — Tú estarás vivo y Kuzco muerto. Recuerda lo único que tienes que hacer cuando seas el emperador. Un estruendo se hizo presente y una voz sin cuerpo retumbó por las paredes. Renunciar a la corona. Dártela a ti —se escuchó— y entonces viviré libre. Yzma le sonrió orgullosa al halo de magia negra sobre una mesa de operaciones, ante ella. Hacía mucho tiempo que no practicaba las enseñanzas de su padre, el primer enterrador real del Imperio, hacía ya siglos, literalmente. Le subía el ego saber que no había perdido capacidades. — Y no decirle a nadie... Que soy un impostor. — Muy bien, es lo único que te pido. Ahora solo necesitaba a Kronk para completar su plan. El sonido de un vagón de montaña rusa acercándose se escuchó. Hablando del rey de la estupidez... Kronk cayó en la entrada, de nuevo con su uniforme puesto. ... Por el agujero cae. — Yzma, tengo noticias —Kronk se acercó a ella, sin darse cuenta de la presencia sobrehumana dentro del espacio cerrado—: Kuzco va a tener una nueva consejera. La mujer miró fijamente a su ayudante, casi sin creer lo que había oído. Ay, eso si había dolido en el orgullo. — Ah —pero no lo mostró, solo fingió indiferencia—. Pues lo siento por ella. Aunque tampoco es que la pobre, fuera quien fuera, tuviera que soportarlo por mucho tiempo. Pronto el engreído personaje sería historia, kaput. Estaba a punto de contarle a Kronk su más reciente y maquiavélico plan, cuando él se le adelanto en abrir la boca. — ¡Se me ha ocurrido un plan para que seas emperatriz, sin tener que matar a Kuzco! —le informó este, con una gran sonrisa. No quería impedirle a Yzma su sueño, pero tampoco quería ver a Kuzco muerto, así que el pobre, con toda la buena intención del mundo sobrecalentó el poco seso que tenía para llegar a una solución que beneficiaba a ambos bandos. El vejestorio de mujer enarcó una ceja, un placebo de la cara de repudio que quería poner en realidad. — Dímela, pues. ¿Por qué no iba a escucharle? Tenía ganas de reírse un poco.

I am beginning to lose my voice and once it is completely gone, I will be stuck like this,\" Yzma lightly pulled at her purple fur. \"Now, you be a good kitty. Kronk will be right back.\" Kronk patted Yzma on the head and strolled into the magic store. \"Welcome to Potion in Motion, how can I assist you today?\" The young man behind the register asked unenthusiastically. \"Where would I find, say, a potion that would turn a cat who was once a human back into a human?\" The clerk looked at Kronk with concern. \"We don't really sell potions here dude. Could I interest you in some playing cards or a wand or something?\" \"Is that a real question?\" Kronk responded to the clerk. The young man showed Kronk down an isle of useless toys and gadgets. A tall, thin man sashayed out of the magic store, a stovepipe hat and black wand tucked behind his arm. His eager eyes fell upon Yzma. \"Hello Kitty,\" the man bent down to meet Yzma. \"No tags.\" Yzma tried to scare the man away by speaking but the only sound that came out was a sad \"meeew.\" \"I know,\" said the man. \"You will be my assistant!\" Yzma tried to escape the grasp the man had on her tiny body. \"Instead of a rabbit, I will pull you out of my hat! You are small enough to fit in the hidden pocket in this hat I presume.\" The man examined the hole in his stovepipe. \"A cute kitten like you otta earn me some coins.\" Yzma let out a piercing squeak. Kronk turned toward the display window and saw Yzma in the arms of the stranger. \"Yzma! Sorry, I'll have to come back for these,\" Kronk dropped his arms-full of magical gadgets on the floor and ran toward the door. He opened the shop door and looked left, no Yzma. He looked right, no Yzma. The man had already crossed the street and was headed into a small theater. \"Eeeee,\" Kronk gasped as he brought his hands to his mouth. \"I need help,\" Kronk thought to himself for a moment. He looked around. \"I know!\" He exclaimed. \"SQUEAK SQUEAKER SQUEAKEN SQUEAK!\" Kronk yelled out. Dozens of squirrels came running from the neighboring park. Kronk explained to the rodents what had happened to Yzma. He ordered them to find a potion or reverse potion to turn her back before it was too late. The first one to bring it to him got a life-time supply of acorns. The creatures scurried off. Kronk crept into the back door of the theater. He walked around backstage plotting. He discovered a ladder that led to a walkway above the stage. \"This is the best seat in the house,\" Kronk watched from above as the next act entered center-stage. \"Eeeee,\" Kronk gasped as he watched the man who took Yzma present himself. \"I am the GREAT Marcel Hoodwink!\" Kronk chewed his nails and watched the act in panic. \"And now, for my final act...\" Suddenly, a small clicking sound echoed by the ladder. \"Bucky!\" Kronk hugged the rodent. Bucky handed him a small test tube filled with a dark purple fluid. Marcel held out his hat and waved his hand over it. \"Arubus, contugas...\" \"Let's hope this works,\" Kronk held the tube steady and tipped the end aimed at the hat. \"Presto!\" shouted the magician. Mr. Hoodwink reached into the hat and pulled out... \"Ahahahaha! I'm back!\" Yzma stretched out of the hat and ran off stage. The crowd stood to their feet and cheered; throwing money onto the stage and whistling.

A tempting offer had been placed before her that night, at a meeting with several of the world's most powerful sorcerers and sorceresses (including, but not limited to Jafar, Madam Mim, Maleficent, Destane, and Dr. Facilier). She had never, in fact, attended a meeting before that night, though she was aware of the organization; she was also quite aware of the darkness and evilness that seemed to permeate the group, that being the reason for her not wanting to get involved. But recently...Yzma felt the way she was treated around the palace was despicable, especially considering the amount of time and effort had been spent on her \"job\". Her job was to, in a sense, raise the baby that resided in the kingdom. Raise him to be a great and powerful emperor. It was a frustrating, horrible, and degrading position, for a woman of her stature. She was well-educated and she knew the ins and outs of politics better than she knew the back of her hand. To be put on baby-sitting duty after all of her hard work was an insult of massive proportions. The group seemed to take an interest in her just as her frustrations were reaching their peak. They wanted her to join them, that much was apparent. \"The rewards will be great,\" they had promised as well, upon hearing the damning job she currently held. They said that she deserved some sort of reward for her work, for which she whole-heartedly agreed. However...there was a catch. None of those from the group actually spoke of said catch, but Yzma knew of it all the same. These sorcerers and sorceresses practiced dark magic, of the likes of which she had never seen before. All of them had more evil in their spirits than the average person, most likely due to prolonged exposure to such evil matter. Yzma wanted the power they offered...but she didn't want to change. She wanted to have only a touch of evil in her, not the full blown engulfment that shone in the eyes of a couple of the members. The leader, Destane, for example. His eyes were pure red, including the pupils, and his hair was frayed, burnt, and wild. He looked like some hellish demon that had crawled straight out of Hades's realm. And when he struck the child that was supposedly his apprentice... Yzma had to stop walking for a second, a bout of pained sickness gnawing at her stomach. She did not want to turn into whatever Destane was. Eventually Yzma continued her trip to her room, briefly pausing to check her charge. He was fast asleep in his crib, that was in the adjoining room to her own. He cooed slightly in his sleep, somehow managing to shove his entire fist in his mouth. A normal person would have \"awwwwed\" at the sight, but Yzma only felt disgust. She left the room quickly, as a dangerous burning-hot rage filled her stomach. It wasn't fair that she had to be stuck baby sitting. She quickly changed into her night robe, falling into her large bed. The propositions of the group wafted through her mind as she drifted off to sleep. However, her sleep was soon disturbed by the crying of a baby; in particular, the baby she was in charge of looking after. She laid awake for a few moments, her eyes trained on the ceiling. She thought about not getting up briefly, before deciding that taking care of the crying baby was better than the alternative; she absolutely despised it when the Emperor and Empress gave her a \"talking to\" about raising their son. If they were so upset about it, then why didn't they do it themselves?! She walked over to the child's room, glaring down at him in his crib. He was wailing, bashing his hands against the sides of the crib, the tiny crown on his head cock-eyed on his head. She picked up the thrashing child, holding him to her thin chest. \"Calm down, will you?\" she asked him, as she bounced. His crying calmed a bit, but refused to cease. \"Kuzco, come on, it's late...\" she sighed. Kuzco gripped the collar of her robe, making whining sounds. Yzma looked down at him glaring...however, when she looked into his wide watery eyes, her expression softened slightly. \"Little brat...\" she muttered, gently stroking his black hair back from his face. The golden crown fell from his head, clanging slightly as it hit the rug below them. Yzma didn't pay it any mind, instead walking away from it to stand by the window that looked out over the kingdom. She thought about the words of that group once again, before shaking her head. She could never do what they asked of her. She could never hurt Kuzco. \"Tonight,\" she said, \"You aren't the little brat that will some day be ruling this kingdom. You're...my boy...\" A/N Awww! I love cute fluffity-fluff-fluff one-shots!

His theme song was prominent in his mind. 'You're not just gonna let him die like that, are you?' 'My shoulder angel!' Kronk gasped as the angelic figure appeared on this shoulder. Kronk suddenly realised that he was being extremely immoral, he felt confused, frustrated and slightly aroused. 'Don't listen to that guy.

All that she remembered was the young and innocent and completely naive voice calling out. She froze, then, turning to look at the child. Kuzco was sitting near her, on the floor, chewing on one of his numerous toys. His eyes were wide and dazed with the wonders of the world, as only a child's eyes could be. For a moment, looking at him, she wondered if she had really heard the word she thought she had, for he looked completely oblivious. Then the word was spoken again: \"Mama?\" Yzma stared at Kuzco, as he reached his hand up to her, clasping it and unclasping it. He shoved his toy partially back in his mouth, before laughing at something he apparently found funny. Yzma remained where she was, her lips pressed into a thin line. In her head, a war was waging. She knew she should be mad at Kuzco; it was his fault these horrible feelings were running through her mind. But...she also felt pity for the boy, or at least something akin to it. She knelt down slowly. Kuzco immediately dropped the toy, clapping his hands in excitement as his \"baby sitter\" appeared beside him. \"Kuzco...I'm not your mother,\" Yzma said quietly, though she forced her voice to be firm. It was hard though, with those big dark eyes staring at her. \"Mama!\" he exclaimed, pulling himself over to Yzma. He climbed onto her bony lap, wrapping his chubby baby arms around her as he buried his head in her chest. \"Mama...\" \"Kuzco...Kuzco, stop this,\" Yzma said weakly. She closed her eyes, hating herself for what she was about to do. She pushed him off her lap, her eyes suddenly stone-cold. \"I am not your mother,\" she said firmly. He looked up at her, and the guilt was overwhelming. Tears had pooled in his dark eyes, silently cascading down his tanned cheeks. He made a small sound, just a little whimper, before he started sobbing hopelessly. The sound was grating on Yzma's ears. It was horribly sad, the sound a beaten dog would make. The pain in it was agonizing, and she couldn't take it. She drew him into her lap, rocking him back and forth, whispering words of comfort into his soft hair. Eventually, his sobs came to a halt, and the tears ceased to trickle. He didn't hesitate to throw his arms around her, in spite of the fact she had been the one to hurt him in the first place. She knew the reason for that, of course. She was the only one to care for the boy; his parents were often too busy for the child, and...they could really care less about their own negligence of him. Those thoughts made Yzma draw him closer to her, whispering, \"I'll be your mother, Kuzco. I'll be your \"mama\".\" A/N Aw...I think? This was so sad and yet so cute! I don't know whether to sob or say \"Awwww\". Anyway, I hope you enjoyed that! If you have a request for me to write a story for any Disney-Pixar animated film, please request!

Almost immediately she realized what was making those noises. She sighed, allowing her eyes to drift shut briefly, before sitting up. Soon after, she stood, yanking on her robe, which fell awkwardly around her bony shoulders. By the time she cleaned the anti-aging mask from her face, the crying was much louder, coming from right outside her door. Yzma sighed once more, before opening the door. Kuzco sniffed miserably, rubbing at his eyes. His dressing gown was haphazardly put on, obviously having been pulled on by himself. Under one arm was his well-loved stuffed animal, looking like it was about to fall apart. Yzma stepped aside, allowing the young prince to enter her rooms. He did so quickly, pausing only slightly, when Yzma set a thin hand on his wild hair, ruffling the ebony stands gently. As she shut the door, she heard the creak of her bed, the young prince having ran and jumped onto the piece of furniture. \"So what was it tonight?\" Yzma questioned, barely restraining another sigh. The young prince hesitated, before saying, \"Nightmare.\" Yzma raised an eyebrow at him. \"Another one? Honestly Kuzco...\" \"I'm telling the truth!\" Kuzco said defiantly, jutting out his chin. However, that effect was lost by the tear stains on his cheek. Yzma sat down beside him on the bed, crossing her legs and looking down at the boy. A small smile briefly tugged at her lips, before she forced it away. \"Alright, alright. I believe you. What was it about this time?\" Kuzco pulled his legs up on the bed, leaning into Yzma's side. The woman imagined that it couldn't be too comfortable - she was rather thin, after all - but the young boy didn't seem to mind. Finally, he began speaking. \"It...wasn't anything too terrible...but it made me...really sad.\" \"Oh?\" Kuzco nodded, wrapping his arms around her waist and hugging. \"You see...it was like...you didn't...\" \"Come now, spit it out,\" Yzma muttered impatiently. \"You didn't like me...anymore...\" Though Kuzco's voice started out bold, it steadily got quieter, his nervousness quite apparent. It was what he had said though, that truly got Yzma's attention. Kuzco was worried about her...not... \"That's preposterous, and you know it,\" she said firmly, though one arm wrapped around the boy, quickly squeezing him. \"Yeah...but...it still made me sad.\" Yzma rolled her eyes, before looking down at the prince. He was rather surprised to see his wide amber eyes staring up at her, an open willingness-to-trust-others that only a child could possess. She had to clear her throat and look away. \"Yzma?\" Kuzco asked, his tone uncharacteristically quiet. \"Hm?\" \"...Can I stay the rest of the night in here?\" Yzma shifted slightly, trying to pull away from the boy whom only gripped her robe tighter. She gave up, instead, shooting an annoyed look at him. \"Kuzco. Remember what I've told you.\" \"I know, I know,\" he said in annoyance. \"It's \"improper\".\" \"That it is,\" Yzma nodded. Kuzco bit his lip, before those wide eyes met Yzma's once more. \"Please? Just for a little while.\" Yzma thought herself weak, as she nodded, but those eyes...there was no saying no to them. Kuzco once again glued himself to her side, laying his head against her bony ribage. His wide eyes fluttered shut, the long eyelashes brushing his cheeks. \"G'night, Yzma,\" he sighed happily, as he drifted off to sleep. Yzma didn't move for several minutes, her eyes trained on the wall across from her bed. Kuzco's words, the fears of his nightmares, continued to echo in her head. Would that ambition, that carefully planted seed of that want to succeed...would that seed grow and flourish, pushing aside all other needs? All other things that were important to her. Kuzco's small hands squeezed her robe slightly, as he once again pulled himself closer to her. Yzma looked down at his sleeping face, a hand hovering over his sleep-ruffled hair. Finally, she gave in, allowing her fingers to comb through his hair. There was no way she could betray Kuzco. It was simply preposterous. A/N I don't know why, but I love the whole young!Kuzco thing.

I've been thinking about writing this for years, and finally spilled it out on paper... as it were. This story ignores the TV show and Kronk's New Groove. I really loved the sequel, but never watched the show. I hope it's worth the read. :) . *o0o* . It was inevitable, in hindsight. The sort of thing a real advisor might have warned Kuzco about before he started spending every free moment in the village. With a new, sturdier bridge installed, he could visit every weekend, spend two or three days with the Pacha family, and make time for extended stays whenever he felt the need. The need struck often, and no one question the Emperor, a God, about his motives. He loved the feeling of home, of belonging, something he'd never experienced before. Chicha loved to stuff him full of homemade maize tortillas and sopapillas, fried plantains and baked squash, even pill bugs, insisting he needed to put some meat on his bones. Pacha took him on long, leisurely strolls in the fields; the fresh smell of greenery, he musky scent of the llamas, the warmth of a hand on his shoulder were all precious. In the evening light, Chaca and Tipo would chase him around the hill, fast and breathless with innocent joy until their mother called them in for bed. After the sun had set, the children quiet in the bed, was a time for quiet reflection before the glow of the fire pit, the heat of the day replaced by the incandescence of the fire. Somehow, Kuzco didn't remember when, it became habit to snuggle up on the cushions. Pacha reclined on the couch, one arm around his wife and the other around the emperor, pulling them snug against sides and shoulders. The heat of the fire was augmented by the warmth of bodies pressed closed together on soft cushions. Kuzco found he loved the smell of the larger man, earthy and strong, and the feel of his large hand curling around his waist protectively. His body melted into the soft heat under him, relaxing even more when Chicha's hand found his across Pacha's chest. At times like that, he let the rumble of Pacha's voice flow through him, not totally absorbing the words but cherishing the tone and the stroke of a feminine thumb on his wrist that he returned. It was perfection, until it was time for bed and he had to retreat to his own house. His heart ached to stay; what did that mean, he wondered, that he preferred their tiny hovel to his gloriously luxurious palace with it's cold pillows? Their plush comfort could never rival the softened hardness of Pacha's muscles covered by a layer of well-fed padding. As the comparison became more stark, he realized he wanted to share his wealth with his new friends. They were more important to him than anyone (save his own self, of course), so why shouldn't they have access to the same sort of lifestyle to which he was entitled? In fact, the simplest way to provide them with it was to move the whole Pacha family into the palace with him. His heart soared when he thought of the children with all the benefits he could provide there, and quickened strangely when he thought of Pacha and Chicha lying among silken sheets. Kuzco didn't understand why they seemed less than thrilled when he invited them to live with him in the lap of luxury. They let him down as easily as possible, but he didn't understand it. Why wouldn't they want to avail themselves of his wealth, give their children every opportunity? He fumed and railed, but in the end found they couldn't be swayed. He tried to leave, angry and embarrassed, but Pacha hugged him hard, holding him fast as Chicha kissed his forehead, and he felt accepted again. His misguided attempt must have clued the peasants in to his feelings, which he'd only begun to understand himself, because that night when the moon was high overhead, and he stood to head back to his own cabin, Pacha stopped him with a firm and shocking kiss. His confused and guilty look towards Chicha earned him another, softer one. After that, he stopped sleeping in the little house on the next hill over. Several days later, when Chaca saw Kuzco emerge yawning and half dressed, she asked why he was sleeping in her Mom and Dad's room. He had no idea what he could say as an explanation, stuttering incoherently until Pacha appeared. He put his arm around the Emperor's shoulders, and gave a two word explanation that made Kuzco blush and smile. He's family. He ignored his new advisor's advice about choosing a bride, and eventually the gruff old man stopped asking. No one questioned it when Pacha and his family began to take frequent vacations to the palace with him, or when his time in the capital was only limited to when they could all be there. There was no public ceremony; after all, he was the Emperor. He used his Divine Authority to declare their union, and it was so. No one questioned the special lessons, usually reserved for royalty, that he ordered for all of their children. The family grew over the years as another two little girls were born; Izel and Citlalli. Kuzco couldn't be sure of course, but little Lalli was small and angular, a bit of a diva, had to be the center of attention. A lot like him. Uncle Kuzco was a second father; Pacha read them stories and gave good advice. He taught morals, the same morals he had taught Kuzco himself. Kuzco ran with them, threw them in the air, helped them play. Showed them how to have fun. Years later, Pacha and Chicha did finally move into the palace with Kuzco, when all the children were grown, leaving their House on a Hill to Tipo and his wife. Yupi had apprenticed with a carpenter and was on his own. Izel had shocked everyone when she married a man over half a century her senior; she and Kronk had opened a restaurant nearby. And tiny, delicately boned Citlalli followed her heart and joined a theatre troupe, traveling the country and earning her fame and fortune. Chaca let her parents keep the room the three shared when she took the throne, and Kuzco, much mellowed with age, became her advisor. He privately thought he was much better at it than Yzma ever was. He even refrained from sitting on the throne... in front of peasants, at least. Chaca traveled the countryside, meeting her people, and honestly being a better ruler than he had ever been. She married a strongly built peasant who came to live with her at the palace. He was strong and kind, and Kuzco was proud. Now, the lessons were for the grandchildren. Kuzco still played, but spent more time sitting than standing, his hands, gnarled with arthritis and wrinkled with age, lifting the tiny children with a bit more difficulty into his lap. He like to hold them as the lines of Pacha's beloved face deepened, his expression glowing with the stories he told as they sat with Chicha on a couch much more plush than the one in their old home. Sometimes, he tried to imagine what his life would have been like, had he never met Pacha, if he'd thrown their family, his family off that hill with nary a thought and spent his life alone. Nothing he thought of could rival the reality of the blessed years he'd spent with his soulmates. It was a surprise to all when the royal doctor gave Kuzco the bad news, but really, he should have known better. Of course his body would contrive a way to go first, though Pacha and Chicha were older. He always wanted to be the center of attention after all, so why should that change with his death? It was the wasting illness, the same thing that had claimed the life of his grandparents. When his strength finally left him, and he was confined to their bed, Chicha or Pacha was with him constantly. It was unspoken, but they all three knew they didn't want to waste a moment of his time. The children came, too, to say goodbye, and Chaca's new advisor helped him plan the funeral. It would be lavish, of course, and extravagant, just as his whole life had been. Dancing and music, and joy, he insisted. A wondrous celebration to see his spirit onward. Gods weren't supposed to die, were they? His parents had died when he was one year old. They left him alone, coddled, but not truly loved. His Divine Father and Mother had died of something as mundane as the flu, so he knew there was no fighting this. Well, he'd enjoyed more of life than they had. Seen his five children (for they were all five his as much as they were Pacha's or Chicha's) grow and begin families or careers. He'd had infinite kisses and snuggles, innumerable squeals of delight, even cherished tears when he's been confided in; Izel's illicit affair, Chaca's secret passion to rule, Lalli's desire to act, Tipo's fear of responsibility. They were his treasures and his joy, the icing on the cake that was his union with Chicha and Pacha. He had always been thin, but now he looked like was nothing but skin and bones, disappearing amidst the blankets and pillows. He'd lost his appetite, only able to eat small amounts, and only able to muster the motivation so he could make Chicha happy. She fed him personally, small spoons of watery porridge or broth, sips of milk. Kuzco couldn't blame Chicha for crying sometimes, and he had enough strength left to wrap an emaciated arm around her when she lay next to him in their bed. Now he was the one in the middle, Pacha a comforting warmth on one side and Chicha on the other. They were laying with him at the end. He felt it, knew it was time when a numbness began creeping up his limbs. He tried to gasp out something; their names, a last goodbye, how much he loved them... He wasn't really sure, but all he could manage was a hissing wheeze. A mist was encroaching on his vision. He heard a stifled sob, deep and masculine, felt warm arms wrapping around him. From his other side, Chicha, somehow the more composed one, gave him what he needed. It's okay, Kuzco. You can let go now. Her voice, warbling with age, broke regardless. Kuzco moved his eyes to the left to see his wife's wet, smiling face; he couldn't see his husband, who was quietly weeping into his hair. How had she known? His last act of holding on was the most selfless he'd ever committed. He thought he sensed the lightest pressure on his cheek as his heart stopped, leaving a strange emptiness in his chest. He was ready. His useless eyes closed and he sighed one final time. . *o0o* . ~fin ","Summary":" The Essence of Life . *o0o* .

Now if you'll follow me, we'll begin our tour!\" Two old men playing chess watched the group going in. \"What's up with them?\" the one asked the other. \"Ah, the emperor's gotten so famous since his last movie that people from all over are clamoring to see his palace in person,\" the other replied. \"Ah,\" said the one, and they resumed their game. The group followed Roxipapoticalulu as she led them from one room to another. \"Here is the entryway where Emperor Kuzco gets his groove on each morning!\" Ahhhh, said the crowd, whipping cameras out. \"Here is the Emperor's throne room, where he defies architectural sense with the stairs up to his throne!\" Oooooo, said the crowd, lenses flashing. \"Here's the dining room, where our beloved Emperor was first turned into a llama!\" Mmmmm, said the crowd, shutters clicking. \"Here's where his advisor Yzma first began her plot to get rid of Kuzco! Notice all the fragments still on the floor from the numerous Kuzco busts that she smashed with a hammer!\" Eeeeeeeeh , said the crowd, surreptitiously picking up pieces. \"And here at last is Yzma's 'secret lab'! Before we go inside, do notice—yes, we have a question?\" A little girl popped her bubblegum noisily and said, \"Yes. Why does she even have that lever?\" \"Ah, yes, the infamous question! There have been many theories put forth over the years. Some say that it is the remnant of times long past when prisoners were kept here… A guard drags a dejected prisoner behind him. \"Stand here. We are setting you free today.\" The prisoner perks up. \"Really?\" \" No, not really. Back down you go!\" He pulls the lever and the prisoner slides down the chute with a scream. \" NO FAA AIIIIIRrrrrrr….\" \"Some believe that it is a mere standard booby-trap used to keep curious invaders out…\" A man with a fedora and a bullwhip sneaks up to the pair of levers. \"I'll bet there's a wealth of knowledge and treasure behind this door…which belongs in a museum!\" He stands back from the door and pulls the lever with his whip to avoid any traps. Unfortunately, he didn't stand far enough back and ended falling down the tube, and somehow ended up in a tunnel with a large boulder coming from behind to squish him. \" How do I always end up in this kind of situation?\" He yells at the ceiling, trying to run faster. \"Some insist that it is a metaphysical plot device that allows bizarre and random events to occur against the laws of common sense. Like an Improbability Drive!\" \" Pull the lever, Kronk!\" Yzma shouts. He complies, but…. \" Wrong lev errrrrrr…!\" On the other side of the world, a bowl of petunias suddenly materializes 1254 feet above the ground, instantly plummeting down at the rate of 32 feet per second. \"Oh, no, not again….\" moans the bowl. \"Why does this keep happening to me?\" Sometime later, a llama and a large village man also pull the lever. At that moment, a wormhole suddenly appears beneath the unfortunate Yzma and her henchman Kronk, who had been dangling over a large pool of crocodiles after being struck by lightning while trying to fly over a large gap between cliffs. With a startled yell, they fall into the wormhole and suddenly appear in Yzma's \"secret lab\", just in time to welcome Kuzco and Pacha. \"But of course, the real reason….\" The tour guide lowered her voice and everyone leaned in closer. \"The real reason…is that…well, do you notice how the levers are attached to the statue to form the tusks? Well, they built two levers because….\" Everyone held their breath. \"…the statue just looked funny with only one tusk.\" The group stared at her, then stared at the statue head on the wall. After a moment's silence, the bubblegum girl agreed. \"Yup! It would look ridiculous with just one tusk.\" Thus the matter was settled, the tour continued, and everyone lived happily ever after. Except the bowl of petunias. A/N: Just a little humor to lighten the day! I hope that everyone enjoyed their tour of Kuzco's palace! Also, in case you were wondering, the two shout-outs were for Indiana Jones and Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy .

Don't judge or tell me things like \"Sawyer and Hazel don't act like that.\" cause this is my fanfic and it's whatever I want it to. Hope you guys enjoy! I'm taking suggestions. But not rants and complaints! This is what I made off of in the trailer that released on April 11. Some information here are real and gotten from the aquarium Follow them on Instagram! : /cmaaquarium The movie will come out soon in September 19 2014 Thank you! DISCLAIMER: I don't own Dolphin Tale! But I wish I was part of it! A few inspirational words~ If Winter can, I can. Don't be afraid to shoot for the stars. Once you choose hope, anything is possible. Just remember you can \"Dolphin\" lately can do it! ~ Winter and Hope's Tale ~ It's been 5 years ever since Sawyer found Winter and he had been reborn into a happy-going and helpful boy, well teenager cause he turned 17 a few months ago. After a while his mom decided to move to a different house to start things fresh. So ever since the announcement of the move Hazel planned to make a Farewell Party for Sawyer. The whole Clearwater Marine Aquarium joined in and Sawyer did not know a thing. They plan to keep it a secret but now is the day he will see CMA for the last time. It was night and the staff of the aquarium gathered around in one big spot waiting for Sawyer and his mom to come. - Clearwater Marine Aquarium - Sawyer and his mom: Lorraine just stepped out the car and walked to the entrance of the aquarium. As Sawyer opened the door everyone in the aquarium shouted and cheered. Sawyer looked around and saw a banner that said - \"WE LOVE YOU SAWYER\", a cake that said \"Bon Voyage\" which meant \"have a nice trip\" and more. Lorraine hugged Sawyer tightly, and teared up a little. \"You didn't have to do this for me..\" Sawyer said with a surprised look. Hazel slapped his back and smiled at him, \"Don't be like that! Enjoy it while you can! It's your last time here isn't it?\" After a few minutes of enjoyable fun, Sawyer secretly went to the upstairs pools to say his goodbyes. He went to Winter's pool with sadness and he dipped his legs in. Winter moved his legs playfully and made the Tweety Bird noises Hazel loved so much. \"I'm going somewhere a long while. But don't worry. You'll be happy without me.\" Sawyer said with a mournful tone. He pet the bottlenose dolphin and smiled. It was his last time with Winter. \"You know she'll be really sad if you left.\" a familiar voice said. Sawyer looked behind him and saw Hazel. \"I really doubt that.\" Sawyer replied sadly. Hazel's smile turned into a frown as she walks over to Sawyer. \"You really shouldn't be like that on your last day here.\" she said. \"Sawyer! Sawyer!\" someone called out. It was Lorraine Nelson trying to look for Sawyer. Sawyer stood up from where he was sitting and came over to his mom. \"Mom I'm right here. Just saying my goodbyes.\" Sawyer said looking at Winter. Lorraine smiled sadly and nodded. \"Okay take your time.\" Sawyer and Hazel head over to the pool where Panama used to be at. They saw no one \"Panama died in September. Winter's only known pool mate and surrogate mother,\" Hazel said. \"If Winter doesn't get a friend soon we'll lose her to the other aquariums.\" Sawyer with a shocked face turned to hers. \"But that means..!\" Sawyer said as his voice trailed off. \"Don't worry about it. We're on it.\" Hazel reassured. \"Sawyer! Hazel!\" Clay called out worriedly. \"Dad what is it?\" Hazel asked. Clay took a minute to catch his breath and looked at the two teenagers worriedly, \"A person called. Her daughter found a dolphin on land.\" Hazel and Sawyer looked at each other and went out the aquarium. The whole staff gathered outside and Clay stood in front. He then raised his hand and looked at everybody. \"When that truck arrives, you will hear one voice and it will be mine,\" Everyone then nodded. Clay then pointed a finger at Sawyer. \"Sawyer, I want you right beside me.\" After a few more minutes the truck arrived (or the car they ride). As soon as they saw it Clay looked back. \"Alright everyone let's get ready to go!\" Clay opened the truck and the people inside was caring for a bottle nose dolphin that looked like a baby. Everyone said \"Awww\" cause it was a baby and it was adorable. \"She's so little.\" Hazel said worriedly while holding a camera, recording the baby dolphin. \"She's stiffing up! We got to get her to the water fast! Clay then gently picked the mammal up and put her on the stretcher and handed it to Phoebe and Kat who walked carefully inside the aquarium. Everyone followed in worry and hope that it was okay. As soon as they arrived upstairs Clay laid the baby down on the water and then he carefully made the dolphin swim to Phoebe and Kat who were already in the water. They gently held the dolphin up to reach the air. Hazel and Sawyer then appeared beside Clay and then Sawyer spoke up. \"What happened?\" Clay then bit his lip and sighed. \"They said that she was supposed to be nursed but her mother unfortunately passed away.\" \"Now all we can do is hope.\" Clay said. \"That's her name.\" Hazel said suddenly. Both of the two boys looked at her confusingly. \"Hope,\" Clay said. \"I like it.\" Clay puts his arm around the two teenagers as they all smiled at the baby dolphin that just arrived. Hope. Okay guys I know it was short but I enjoyed it. I don't mind taking suggestions! Follow, Favorite, Review![Chapter 2] Hi guys! So I saw a review that said if Sawyer is moving in the movie. But as I said some info here are non-canon and canon, and I didn't even watch the movie yet. But me and my cousin are working on it thinking about what the whole Bon Voyage thing is. But for now this is how I want/think this movie goes. Hope you enjoy my idea for this chapter and I don't mind taking suggestions! - It's been a day after Hope arrived to Clearwater Marine Aquarium and Sawyer's Farewell Party. Well about the farewell… His move was delayed and moved back for a few days because Sawyer was too worried for Hope. - Sawyer's House - Sawyer was putting his backpack on and Lorraine was preparing food on the table. \"Sawyer no need to rush things. Eat your breakfast right now.\" She said. \"Oh come on but mom..\" Sawyer protested. Lorraine furrowed her eyebrow and looked at her son. \"I don't care eat your food right now.\" (She didn't say that in a bad way okay? Like in a mom way.) Sawyer sighed, put his backpack down and sat down on the chair. He ate some scrambled eggs, bacon and grabbed a piece of toast and stuffed it his in mouth and stood up. \"Mom I gotta go to visit Hope!\" Lorraine looked at him confusingly. \"Hope? Is that a girl?\" She asked. Sawyer shook his head in utter disagreement. \"Mom.! It's the baby dolphin from last night!\" Lorraine's face then changed. \"Ohhh! Sorry!\" She apologised laughing. - Clearwater Marine Aquarium - Hazel was carrying a big red cooler filled with fish for the animals in the upstairs pool. While holding the cooler Hazel thought about the first time Sawyer entered the aquarium. He got in because Hazel forgot to lock the entrance of the aquarium which she was supposed to lock as a task. It's been a while and their 16 or 15 already. Time goes by so fast.. \"Hazel?\" a familiar voice called out. Hazel then dropped the cooler on the floor and attended to the person. It was Sawyer. He was standing outside the building waiting for Hazel to unlock the door. Cause she finally learned her lesson to lock the back door. Hazel unlocked the door and waved hi to Sawyer. \"Came to visit Hope?\" She guessed. Sawyer nodded and Hazel grabbed the cooler and they both went upstairs. - Upstairs Pool - Sawyer and Hazel arrived upstairs and they see Clay, Phoebe and Kat in the pool tending to Hope the baby dolphin. \"She's not a good candidate for survival,\" Clay said. \"She's barely 3 months old.\" Sawyer ran towards the pool and saw Hope. \"How is she?\" Sawyer worriedly asked. \"She lost her mother but she's fine.\" Phoebe answered petting the baby. \"It's so sad..\" Hazel said looking at Hope. Clay bit his lip and looked at Sawyer. \"Hey Sawyer, what about looking after Hope with me and Hazel tonight?\" Clay asked. Sawyer looked at Hope and Clay and then at Hazel. Hazel nodded in agreement and Sawyer then finally looked at Clay for the last time. \"Sure!\" He said enthusiastically. - Clearwater Marine Aquarium, Upstairs Pool - It's 8:00 pm and Sawyer and Hazel were told to watch Hope and Winter for the night while Clay works on something about CMA. \"Hey Hazel do you think Hope will someday get released to the wild?\" Sawyer asked looking at the girl watching the baby dolphin. Hazel then thought of an answer. \"One day she will but not now.\" She answered still looking at Hope. \"Ever since Hope came you've been kind of down. Anything the matter?\" He said noticing Hazel's sad expression. She sighed and looked at him. \"It's a bit like the situation I had with my mom. She's not here and all..\" She replied. Sawyer looked at her and then a vision of his mom came up. Hope and Hazel's situation reminded him of his dad. Who left him during a young age. This is the start of a beautiful friendship. - Ok ok sorry it was not updated it's because school time! I wanted to add more but I feel like some of you wanted to read already so here ya go![Chapter 3] I really don't mind changing the story drastically. And I hope you don't mind. It was day and Sawyer and Hazel were feeding Winter. After last night, Sawyer couldn't help ponder about his dad who left him at a young age. Hazel noticed his sad expression and decided to ask about it. \"Hey, Sawyer what are you thinking about?\" She asked looking at him with a concerned look. Sawyer then shook the thought off his head and looked at Winter. \"Nothing, nothing,\" He replied. \"Just thinking about… The move.\" But the lie didn't help him either. Hazel still had that concerned look. The two teens decided to keep Winter company for a while in silence after Sawyer mentioned him moving to another place. But that very silence was broken after Phoebe came running in in panic. \"Sawyer, Hazel you need to get to Hope right now!\" She ordered. The two teenagers did not hesitate to follow the command and ran over to Hope's pool in a swift. As the threesome arrived to Hope's pool and they instantly heard the baby dolphin's constant cries. Sawyer ran over in worry and then quickly asked Clay what was wrong. \"Hope's very naive and doesn't know much about this world and it dreads the death of her mother.\" Clay answered. With no hesitation Sawyer quickly put himself in the water and calmly swam towards Hope. As expected, the dolphin drew away in fear. \"It's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you.\" Sawyer said in a calm and gentle voice. He didn't bother swimming to the dolphin anymore because the baby swam cautiously towards him. Hazel smiled, seeing this. \"It's warming up to you! Dad it's working!\" She said cheerfully. Sawyer then gave everyone a smile and the aquarium staff stood there surprised at what the teenager did. Sawyer then smiled at Hope and stroked her gently. The dolphin tweeted in happiness and if that's what he thought it is then he could see her smiling. An hour after, Sawyer and Hazel still gave each other a silent treatment and couldn't get over the awkwardness between them. On the other hand Clay was busy tending to the baby dolphin, Hope. But then a stranger comes in and calls for Clay. He looked like he was examining the whole aquarium. Clay recognized the person's uniform and walked towards him. \"How's the aquarium sir?\" Clay asked worried about the man's answer. And that's when the trouble started. \"Your female dolphin, Winter. She's not feeling well Clay.\" He said. Clay looked at him in confusion and asked why. \"She needs to interact with someone of her species. We're gonna have to take her to another aquarium for obvious reasons.\" \"What do you mean? You can't just take her away we're her-\" But Clay was cut off by the man. \"Family? Well she needs to be paired up with a female dolphin and fast.\" The man said. Clay then was about to say something but then the man cut him off once again. \"I'll give you 30 days.\" He added then he left. Clay just stood there dumbfounded. - At Sawyer's House - Lorraine, Sawyer's mom, watched her son search through the web about baby dolphins and smiled. \"Sawyer how's Hope?\" She asked her son. Sawyer, still looking at the screen replied with a \"She's fine mom.\" Lorraine sighed and beamed at her not-so-little-boy. \"Just make sure you sleep earlier than last time.\" She then walked to her bedroom and closed the door shut. She smiled seeing the boxes unpacked and at the thought she'd still be staying in the house. She sat on the bed and removed her ponytail and lied down. She's glad to have a son who loves helping out. -Next day at the aquarium- Hazel and Sawyer started talking again and stopped with the silent treatment since both of them wanted to keep their friendship going. Maybe even something more..? Clay has yet to inform the two kids about his little problem with Winter but he planned to tell them today. A little later, Hazel was performing surgery on a turtle with a brand new member in the aquarium, Natalie. She had black hair tied up in a ponytail. They were trying to get a hook out of a turtle they found that washed up on the beach. Hazel grabbed a very dangerous tool and closely examined the turtle. \"SQUAWK!\" Something said. Hazel dropped the tool on the floor, startled. Natalie gasped in shock. They looked out the window and saw a certain, familiar pelican. \"Rufus! Bad pelican!\" Hazel said grasping her tool. The pelican sounded like it snorted and started squawking obnoxiously. \"What is wrong with that bird?\" Natalie complained. Hazel rolled her eyes and smiled. \"Where do I start?\" …. Good many minutes passed by and the surgery was successful. The turtle acted quite happily and Sawyer happened to arrive at the scene. \"How's the turtle?\" He asked knowing what the answer is gonna be. Hazel knew what he was thinking and gave him a light shove. \"You know we did it.\" She said. Sawyer smiled at her and looked at Natalie and gave her a thumbs up. Natalie accepted the praise and winked at him and smiled. Kat walked over to the three and said that Clay needed to talk to them and it sounded urgent. Sawyer and Hazel arrive at Clay's office and they see him sighing while looking at a bunch of papers all together in a folder. \"You wanted to see us dad?\" Hazel said as she looked at her dad concerned. Clay took his last frustrated sigh and looked at the teenagers standing in front of him. \"Winter's gonna be taken away.\" Clay spoke. Hazel and Sawyer's eyes widened at the thought of Winter leaving. \"Mr. Clay you can't be serious.\" Sawyer said denying the fact. Clay stood up, holding the folder full of papers. \"But we can do something about it. We need to pair her up with a female dolphin. We got 30 days.\" He added. Sawyer and Hazel gave each other worried glances as their heads get filled with negative thoughts. Hazel left the office with saying she has to take care of Hope while Sawyer and Clay stood silently there. \"You aren't gonna fail your daughter or the aquarium today sir.\" Sawyer finally said. YO GUYS WASSUP! Okay I'm sorry it's short. But I need some ideas here. I kinda put some Sawyer and Hazel there and I'm open to ideas. I know this is gonna be WAY DIFFERENT from the real movie but what the heck. I like it anyway. And Rufus finally shows up! Thanks for the support guys. I really appreciate it. Heck, if I get more reviews I might make this longer..?[Chapter 4] Another notice! So I did not watch the movie yet. It's releasing in October at my place which blows! But I know everything that happened and I was thinking about making a DT3 instead? I already got a story planned out and I would like you guys to read it. So how 'bout it?

I've actually wanted to write an Emperor's New Groove fic for about 3 years now, it's just that I didn't have any ideas until this summer, when I started writing this fanfic. Funny how I don't post it until December, though. Anyways this story mostly revolves around my OC Sansa, but Kuzco is also really important too. This specific fanfic takes place over the course of New School, and hopefully if I can stay interested long enough, I can actually do the full series I was planning to do, which takes place over the movies as well (the first movie being a prequel to this story, and Kronk's New Groove a sequel) plus an original story that I was going to write like it was another sequel to the movies (but with a few crossover elements with the original concept, Kingdom of the Sun, as well as the movie The Road to El Dorado) Before you read this, and before you pass harsh judgement on Sansa-I'd like to note that her character development is the most important thing to this story, and that if you don't like how she is as a character now, that's fine, but you should remain open minded, because she won't be like this forever, as the point is for her to grow, learn, and change. Anyways, I hope you enjoy. *CHAPTER ONE* It had been a week since Kuzco had been back in the palace, after having been turned into a llama, and he was starting to get back into the swing of things-of course, things were different than they were before, as Kuzco had learned his lesson about being selfish and cruel. He became far more helpful, and a better emperor to his subjects. Of course, someone didn't like that...And she had a plan. A plan to take him out in the one way that breaks the spirits of all teenagers... High School. The brisk Andean winter ended, bringing the warmth of spring to the Kuzconian Empire. Wildflowers decorated every field, and every end table, of every home. Kuzco wasn't too fond of the flowers however, as they made him sneeze. He was relaxing in his throne, named Throney, having a facial, with cucumbers over his eyes, his feet up on a took a sip from a fruity umbrella drink, handing it off to a servant. \"Thank you, Chipana.\" he said. He had made a habit of memorizing the name of every servant. He was loving life again, especially because who'd have thought being nice to people would get you further? Kuzco didn't think so until he had his heel-face turn. The royal records keeper, Imasu, ran in. \"Sire...Something has come to our attention.\" He said anxiously, as he was expecting Kuzco to snap at him. Kuzco sat up, and pulled a cucumber off his eye, and ate it. \"Yeah?\" He pulled off the other, and ate it as well. \"Uh...you see...It's come to our attention, from the principal of Kuzco Academy, Principal Amzy, that you haven't fulfilled your high school requirements...\" he said, cowering away, expecting the worst. \"But...I'm the Emperor...And didn't I have those royal...Tooty thingies?\" he said, as he was suddenly interested by the state of his cuticles. \"Sire...you fired one because you didn't like their hair color.\" he said \"And you fired the other because you thought his name was funny and he got mad at you.\" \"Well he shouldn't have been named \"Senor Monkeyballs\" if he didn't want me laughing!\" Kuzco pointed out, waving his hand. He leaned over to another of his servants, Sansa, who was holding a jug of water. \"Get a load of this guy.\" he snickered a little. Sansa stared, in disbelief that the Emperor was talking to her. The incarnation of their very gods, taking notice of her. She didn't want to mess up so she began to laugh. Very loudly. To the point where she dropped the jug, and it shattered on the stone floor. \"a-ah! Oops..very sorry, your highness i didn't mean to-\" \"It's fine\" Kuzco cut her off. He could care less about one smashed clay jug. \"Just try not to step on those shards.\" Sansa, however, began to play with her hair in embarrassment. Kuzco turned back to the records keeper. \"School me no likey.\" \"But sire-\" \"No. No school.\" \"If you don't, you can't be Emperor anymore-\" \"School is-Wait, what?!\" \"If you don't complete your school requirements, you will be removed from the throne.\" he said \"And Yzma will be your replacement.\" Kuzco stared in horror. And so did Sansa, as she backed out of the room in worry. Kuzco was in his room, packing only what was necessary-as he wouldn't have access to any royal funds or privileges. He was to essentially act as a peasant for 4 years, or until he got all of his credits. Whichever came first. He wouldn't even be allowed his royal clothes, with the exception of one royal robe, for special occasions. He couldn't even bring his real crown, just a replica. He packed a small sack, filling it with the uniforms of the school-which he wasn't fond of. Next he picked up Wampy, setting the plush into his sack as well. He put the one robe he was allowed, and changed out of the one he was wearing, and put on his llama poncho that was a gift from Pacha. Then he set out to go find a place to stay, as he was now truly on his own. He walked for 4 days, as that bridge was still broken. It started raining, as Kuzco sat down at the base of a tree on the outer end of the jungle, towards Pacha's village, as he began to cry. Meanwhile, on the outskirts of the city, in a dark alley, in a small house made of boxes, Yzma made Kuzcramen, whilst cackling to herself. Kronk sat on the couch-also made of boxes-trying to get comfortable, whilst holding a housewarming gift basket. \"You know I could cook you something.\" He pointed out. Yzma looked over and rolled her eyes. \"I'll stick to this, I'm trying to eat light.\" she replied \"But I can't believe I managed to trick that idiotic records keeper into thinking Kuzco has to go to school!\" she laughed. \"Then all I have to do is fail him in ONE subject! Just one tiny little subject, and then I'll be!\" she ripped off her clothes to reveal an empress outfit \"EMPRESS YZMA!\" \"Do you just wear that under your clothes all the time?\" Kronk asked \"Saves time changing.\" she brushed it off. Then the door opened in a rather forceful fashion, and Sansa entered. Yzma was surprised, as she wasn't expecting a visit from her daughter so soon. \"S-Sansa, what are you doing here? And no housewarming gift for your dear mother, who birthed and nursed you?\" she crossed her arms. \"Cut out the innocent act, mother.\" she crossed her arms, and tilting her head. \"Just what do you think you're doing, Principal Amzy.\" \"Uh-uh...what? What ever do you mean, my dearest little flower-\" Yzma tried to gesture at her daughter, nervously. \"Don't you 'little flower' me, mom. I know you're just going after Kuzco!\" she said crossing her arms, and raising an eyebrow in suspicion. \"If what I think your're doing, is what you're doing, you better not be!\" \"I-I promise, daughter, now go along, mumsy needs her beauty sleep!\" Yzma rushed her out the door, and closed it-which due to Sansa's forcing actions, left the door broken, and it partially hung down in a pathetic fashion. \"Eugh, of course my daughter, and her painfully obvious crush on that little ungrateful brat, has to get in the way of my plan!\" she cursed to herself. \"You're not going to get rid of her, are you?\" Kronk said suspiciously, as if he thought that was a terrible idea-which it was. After all, Sansa was his daughter too. \"Of course not, who will carry on my brrrilliant genes.\" Yzma replied. \"And I GUESS yours too.\" she added on reluctantly. \"Uhhhh...\" Kronk was searching for an answer. \"The other one?\" \"W-what other one?\" she said nervously, then regained her composure. \"There is no other one Kronk. We-we only had one child.\" Yzma said like she had something to hide. \"Riiiiiiiii iiiiiiiiiiiight \" Kronk replied. There wasn't another child, right? Kuzco had his head in his lap, sobbing over night. He was cold, wet, and miserable. He cried. The sun was rising, and he looked up. He realized where he was. \"Maybe Pacha will let me stay with him...\"[Chapter 2] *CHAPTER TWO* Kuzco wandered up the steps leading to the top of the village, where Pacha lived. He anxiously twiddled his thumbs the whole walk there as he hoped pacha would let him stay, because if Pacha didn't, Kuzco would have nowhere to go. When he finally got to the top of the hill, he was exhausted. He panted desperately for air and fell against the front door of Pacha's hut. He dropped his suitcase. \"Good Viracocha, what did I put in here? Rocks?\" he said. Then he realized. He knew what was in there. He was the one who packed the suitcase. He let out a defeated sigh. Then he took a deep breath, stood up straight, and knocked on the door. He waited patiently, but started to get impatient as seconds went by. Then Pacha opened the door. \"Huh? Kuzco? What are you doing here?\" Pacha didn't think there was any special occasion for Kuzco to come by, and usually when the two had visits, it was Pacha who came to the palace, not the other way around. \"I-I...\" he whimpered \"Theroyalrecordskeeperkickedmeoutofthepalaceandsaidihavetogotoschoolcanistaywithyoufor4years...please?\" Kuzco stammered out quickly, hoping Pacha would just hear the important part, the part about him staying there for 4 years. \"Yeah, of course Kuzco.\" Pacha said, pulling the young Emperor into a hug. \"It's no problem, you're like family to us\" ~u~ \"What?!\" Pacha's wife, Chicha, said as she was scrubbing a pot in the sink. \"What do you mean he's staying with us for 4 years ?!\" she dropped the pot into the sink and groaned loudly. \"He'll have nowhere to stay.\" Pacha frowned. \"He's like family, Chicha.\" Chicha gave a flat expression in response. \"Maybe to you, but he's an entitled brat!\" she crossed her arms. \"He changed.\" Pacha defended Kuzco. She tilted her head and walked over to the door of the kitchen, and lifted the curtain to reveal Kuzco, wearing his replica crown, sitting on the couch, using Chaca as a stool to hold his feet up. Kuzco looked up and saw Chicha giving him a death glare of absolute judgement, and he took his feet off the eldest of Pacha's children, and gave a nervous chuckle. Then there was another knock at the door. Kuzco looked over in confusion. \"I'll get it\" said Pacha, getting up. \"No, no, I can, least I could do...\" Kuzco got up and went over to the door, and opened it. What he was not expecting was his servant to be at the door. \"S-salsa?\" Kuzco said in disbelief \"M-my name is Sansa ...\" Sansa said, frowning. \"R-right...Sans...\" he said, still not getting it right. Sansa whined. \"I-I'm here to help you!\" \"Uh, but aren't I supposed to...y'know, live as a peasant for...y'know...\" \"Well...yeah...but I'm not your servant now if you aren't the Emperor...\" she pointed out \"Which means I can help you...\" \"Hmm...\" Kuzco thought about it, and stroked his chin. \"I think I'll pass...\" he started to close the door. \"Kuzco!\" Pacha said, frowning. \"This young lady walked all the way out here, through the jungle, to come help you.\" he crossed his arms. \"Okay, okay, fine. You can help me Sisa.\" he said exasperatedly. \"It's Sansa, and now I'm starting to change my mind...\" Sansa was about to leave. \"No no!\" Kuzco ran to get in front of her. \"No, please\" he started begging. \"Okay. Thank you. Peasant Kuzco.\" she leaned down to him, her face inches from his own. Kuzco accidentally blushed. He'd never seen this side to his usually timid and quiet servant. He kind of liked it. \"Kuzco?\" she looked at him, as his staring had begun to become uncomfortable. \"Right...right.\" He stood up. \"Good, now let me show you where you two will be sleeping.\" Pacha said, as he guided them upstairs to the guest bed in Chaca and Tipo's room. \"I'm sorry there's only one bed, usually the only guests we have are my parents, and they share a bed.\" he said Kuzco was shocked. \"I have to...share a bed...\" Pacha frowned \"Don't worry, we'll get another bunk bed soon, you won't have to share too long-\" \"WITH HER?\" Kuzco stared at Sansa again. \"What? You don't want to share a bed with a peasant?\" Sansa was hurt. \"N-no...I-I just...n-never thought I'd share a bed with a woman until my wedding night...\" he said awkwardly \"That's corny.\" she replied \"I had to share my bed as long as I can remember with other servants.\" \"You, you what?\" Kuzco was in disbelief. Why hadn't anyone told him the state of living for his servants? He was enraged to think his own servants, the people who worked for him, didn't have their own beds. \"What do you mean you didn't have a bed to yourself?\" \"None of the servants do.\" she said \"There's at LEAST 4 of us to one bed.\" \"W-well...They're big enough beds right? Big enough that you all can fit in comfortably and not be packed like sardines?\" he said, hopefully. \"Nope. We all have to awkwardly fit ourselves into small beds.\" she said, matter of factly. Kuzco was shocked. \"Being a servant isn't glamorous Kuzco. Just because you have a gilded life, with a silver-spoon in your mouth from the moment of your birth, doesn't mean your servants get any of that glittering opportunity that you get merely by existing, and not doing much else.\" Kuzco looked down and felt guilty. \"I-I didn't know...\" \"Of course you didn't. These are the things they don't tell you, because they're scared of you!\" she said, crossing her arms. \"Uhh...\" Pacha said awkwardly \"I'm just gonna go...\" He left the room. \"Sansa...I'm sorry.\" he said to her gently. Sansa sat on the bed. \"It's fine, whatever.\" She looked away. \"No, really.\" \"I know you are.\" she looked back at him. \"That's not the point. It's not like you can do anything about it right now.\" She said looking at him. \"I...I guess...\" That just made him feel worse. \"Let's just go to bed, you have a big day tomorrow.\" She laid down, facing away from him. The next morning, before dawn, Kuzco was fast asleep, his face buried into Wampy, snoring like there was no tomorrow. Then the poking began. \"Your Highness\" Sansa said poking Kuzco in the back. This ellicited a smack on the hand from Kuzco. She continued. She rolled him over and poked him in the nose. \"Your Highness!\" she said with a tad more urgency. \"No...touchy...\" he said sleepily. Sansa realized this was going nowhere, and pushed him off of the bed. \"NO TOUCHY!\" he yelled at the ground, as he was brutally ripped from the comfort of sleep. \"W-what? What's? What?\" he lifted his head off the ground. \"Ugh!\" \"Kuzco, you need to wake up.\" she said sternly. \"We're going to be late for school.\" \"What time is it?\" He said. It was pitch black in the room. \"I don't know, 4 am?\" she guessed. \"4 am? No. I'm going back to sleep.\" he got back into bed, laying down. \"Kuzco, you have to be there early, so you make a good impression!\" she said even more sternly. \"Ughhhhh! Fine!\" He sat up, and set Wampy down. \"I guess.\" He got out of bed, and lit a candle. He began to get dressed. \"Stop! What do you think you're doing?\" Sansa got up, and stared at him, as he put his green llama poncho on. \"...Getting dressed?\" he said \"Isn't that what you WANTED me to do?\" he added, with a tone of smartassery. \"No. You can't wear that.\" She replied. \"Why? Am I showing too much ankle ?\" he said sarcastically. \"No.\" She reached for her own napsack, and pulled out some folded red, white, and yellow robes, and tossed them at Kuzco, successfully hitting him in the face with them. \"You have to wear that. Kuzco academy is a uniform school. Didn't you know that?\" Kuzco grabbed the garments. \"I-I knew that!\" He didn't know that. \"A-and don't YOU have to wear these too?\" he said, snapping back. \"Yes. Look away, so I can get dressed.\" After Sansa was dressed, they left to head to the school.. ","Summary":" A/N: Wow, my first fanfic on my new account. I've actually wanted to write an Emperor's New Groove "},{"Movie":"Dolphin Tale","Title":"Dolphin Tales","Author":"rachbeall","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10750917","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hello to everyone who takes a moment to stop by and read this story! Welcome! I love both Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2. After watching the second film, I decided to see what fan fiction existed for them - I was disappointed to find only 17 stories at that time (now 22...mine makes 23). Most were written before Dolphin Tale 2 came out, but a few were written after. I read all of them. With regard to the other stories, I will only make one comment - the timeline of the second movie does not seem to be taken into consideration in any of the post DT2 ones that I have read. If you note the calendar in the movie, it says that Sawyer is to leave on September 27th. If you check the SEA Semester website, it shows the semester as starting on September 29th and ending on December 23rd - that puts Sawyer home right before Christmas. For that reason, I have made the holidays a component of my own story. (The intent is not at all to write a holiday story - that is just where the timeline happens to fall and it'd be silly for me to ignore it.) Also, I chose the New Zealand program rather than the Caribbean one, as I felt that Sawyer would be more interested in \"The Global Ocean\" than \"Colonization to Conservation\". All SEA Semester information in the story was obtained directly from their website. It's very interesting, so by all means check it out! As always, nothing but the plot and any original characters belong to me! 1. Sawyer carefully maneuvered across the gangplank connecting the magnificent brigantine he had called home for the last five and half weeks to the dock where it would be moored until after the holidays. Once safely across, he turned around for one last look at the fine vessel, mentally bidding her a fond goodbye. He shivered, pulling the collar of his coat more snugly around his neck and tucking his hands firmly into his pockets with a sigh. His breath was clearly visible in the crisp December air, and he thought for the thousandth time that he was not suited for cold weather. He had enjoyed the six and a half weeks he'd spent in Woods Hole, Massachusetts before he had set sail at the beginning of November, but it had only been Autumn cold then (and he had left that behind for the warmth of late Spring in New Zealand). Now it was Winter cold. As he shifted the duffel bag on his shoulder and made his way towards the entrance of the dock – falling into step with several of his now former crewmates - he smiled at the thought of Winter. He may not be particularly fond of the Winter up here in the North, but he was definitely fond of a Winter that was in the South. He grinned when he remembered that he would be seeing her soon. He had loved his time in SEA Semester and was so glad that he had chosen to be a part of it, but he had definitely missed Winter and the aquarium...and his mom….and Kyle….and everyone , really. Despite the biting cold, he blushed at the thought of a certain someone that he had missed more than he really cared to admit. But, before the young man's mind could wander into alarming – yet confusing – territory, he was nudged out of his thoughts by the young woman walking next to him. \"Earth to Sawyer! Hey! Where did you go?\" Sawyer started and sheepishly glanced at the pretty auburn haired Boston University Junior who had been kind of like a big sister to him during the past semester. \"Sorry, Anna! Where you saying something to me?\" Anna chuckled in amusement and shook her head. \" I wasn't.\" She gestured to the end of the walkway, \"But Kyle has been trying to get your attention for the last few minutes.\" The teenager's eyes widened and he looked to where she was pointing. Sure enough, his cousin was there waving and calling his name. \"Oh…right.\" He glanced back to her with a shrug. \"I got lost in my thoughts, I guess.\" \"Lost in your thoughts, huh?\" She grinned mischievously. \"Thoughts about what? Or should I say whom ? Maybe you were thinking about being reunited with this friend – Hazel, is it? – that I've heard so much about?\" She put her arm around his shoulder, \"Hmmm?\" Sawyer blushed again, \"Um, I was thinking about home…and Winter…and the aquarium…all that stuff. You know.\" Anna chuckled again, \"Oh yes , I definitely know.\" The young man squirmed under her arm and looked away, no longer even remotely feeling the cold. \"Um…Kyle is waiting for me. I should probably go.\" The grin remained on the impish woman's face as she replied, \"Of course. I'll walk you over. But don't think I don't know that you are just trying to change the subject. I'll let it go this time, though.\" She winked as she removed her arm. \"Consider it my Christmas gift to you.\" His look of relief was not missed by the astute college student as she motioned towards the rest of their group. \"We should say goodbye first, though, don't you think?\" Sawyer nodded with a smile. This group had been really great. They had all taken him under their wings like a kid brother, but had never once babied him. They had included him in everything, and had really seemed to value his opinions and experience. They had all become good friends – a team - despite the age differences. He was used to that at the aquarium, but he hadn't really expected it to be like that with a bunch of college students that he'd never met. He could not have been happier to have been wrong. After many goodbyes, promises to stay in touch, and cheery exclamations of \"Merry Christmas!\", \"Happy New Year!\", and \"Happy Holidays!\", the two finally made their way over to the patiently waiting former soldier. The handsome Boston University Senior grabbed his cousin into a huge hug that lifted him off of his feet. \"Welcome back, Sawyer!\" The teen grinned as he was set back onto his feet. \"Thanks, Kyle. And thanks for coming to pick me up.\" Kyle returned the grin. \"Of course! You're my favorite cousin, after all.\" \"I'm your only cousin, Kyle.\" \"Eh, that's just a technicality.\" He then turned to Anna and gave her a quick hug. \"Welcome back to you, too, Anna! It's good to see you!\" He put his hand on Sawyer's shoulder. \"Thanks for looking out for our guy here.\" \"It was my pleasure!\" She blushed a little, but smiled sweetly at the attractive Pre Med student. \"Sawyer is great.\" Kyle smiled warmly and squeezed his cousin's shoulder, \"Yeah, he is.\" The young man in question looked down at the ground in discomfort. Anna decided that embarrassing him twice in less than an hour was probably more than enough, so she decided to change the subject. \"Well, I don't want to keep you guys. I know you have an early flight tomorrow.\" She pulled Sawyer into a hug. \"Take care, Sawyer.\" She pulled back and looked him in the eyes. \"And keep in touch! I need to stay up to date on Winter and the aquarium…and all that stuff . You know.\" Sawyer rolled his eyes. \"Yeah… I know .\" She winked at him one more time, then turned her attention to his cousin. \"Kyle, great to see you. You take care, too, and I'll see you next semester.\" She gave a little wave and started to walk away, but stopped after only a few paces. She turned back around with a bright smile \"Oh, how could I forget? You boys have a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\" They replied simultaneously, with smiles of their own. \"You too!\" Kyle's eyes followed her as she walked over to a friend's car. He watched her until she was safely in the vehicle, then turned back to Sawyer. He grabbed his cousin's duffel and slung it over his own shoulder, then jabbed a thumb towards a silver Jeep that had seen better days. \"Okay, ready to go?\" Sawyer nodded and Kyle slung his arm loosely around the younger male's neck, guiding him over to the SUV. \"I want to hear all about your trip!\" TBC[Chapter 2] Here's Chapter 2! (And it's even longer than Chapter 1!) I hope everyone enjoys it! As always, nothing but the plot and any original characters belong to me! 2. Kyle swung the door of his apartment open and allowed his cousin to precede him in. \"Whew, it's cold out there! Too cold for us warm bloods!\" Sawyer lobbed his duffel onto the couch and turned back toward the door. \"No kidding!\" Kyle shut the door and dropped his keys into a dish on the top of a bookshelf to his right. He shrugged out of his coat and draped it over the back of a well-worn leather armchair. \"So, are you hungry? I could really go for a pizza. Il Mondo's delivers. You game?\" \"Yeah, that sounds great.\" Sawyer shrugged out of his own coat and shot his cousin a self-conscious smile. \"But…uh…would it be okay if I took a shower first? I've really been looking forward to a real hot shower.\" \"Yeah, of course! Have at it!\" He took Sawyer's coat and placed it with his own. He then pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and began scrolling through his contacts. \"I'll just order the pizza. It should be here by the time you're done.\" He looked up. \"Mushroom okay?\" \"Yeah, perfect.\" Sawyer turned, snagged his duffel bag, and headed in the direction of the hallway that led to the bathroom and bedrooms. He paused just before he reached it, however, and swiveled back towards his cousin. \"Um, Kyle?\" Kyle looked up from his cell again. \"Yeah, buddy?\" \"Could we get some of those hot wings they make, too? They're awesome.\" The older cousin grinned. \"Definitely!\" Sawyer returned the grin. \"Great! Thanks.\" He then resumed his original course and disappeared down the hallway. Kyle chuckled, then walked into the kitchen as he put his phone to his ear. \"I love that kid.\" Thirty minutes later the apartment was filled with the wonderful aroma of a combination of Italian food and buffalo sauce. A wet-haired Sawyer walked into the living room sporting a pair of gray sweatpants and a royal blue hoodie with WHOI emblazoned across the chest in large white block letters and a line of smaller white text beneath it. Kyle looked up from the couch. \"He lives! Here I thought I was going to have to send in the Coast Guard.\" \"Haha….very funny, Kyle.\" \"Did you leave any hot water for the rest of the building there, pal?\" Kyle said as he pulled out a slice of pizza and put it on a plate for his cousin. He nudged the plate across the coffee table as Sawyer collapsed into a recliner. \"It wasn't that long.\" He picked up the plate and took a generous bite of the pizza. He chewed and swallowed, then smiled sheepishly. \"It was just really nice.\" Kyle laughed and set a can of soda in front of the teen currently devouring his dinner. \"I'll bet.\" He leaned back and helped himself to his own slice of pizza. \"I'm just teasing you, cuz. After all those weeks sharing tight spaces on a sailboat, it probably felt like heaven to have a big shower all to yourself for as long as you liked.\" Sawyer polished off his slice, then reached for another. \"You have no idea.\" As the young man reclined back again, Kyle noticed the letters on the front of his sweatshirt. \"Whoi?\" Sawyer looked over at him in confusion, his second piece of pizza suspended halfway between his plate and his mouth. \"Huh?\" Kyle pointed at his cousin's chest. \"Your shirt.\" Sawyer looked down. \"Oh! WHOI. It stands for Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. It was one of the places I studied before setting sail for New Zealand.\" \"Oh right, you told me about that.\" Kyle took a sip of his soda. \"You studied at some other places there, too, right?\" Sawyer nodded and put his pizza back on his plate and set it on the end of the coffee table so that he could grab his own soda. He cracked it open, took a sip, then continued. \"There are a lot of marine research places in Woods Hole. There's the Marine Biological Laboratory, the Woods Hole Research Center, the United States Geological Survey, the National Marine Fisheries Service…and WHOI, obviously. They say 'Woods Hole is to Scientists what Paris is to Artists.'.\" Kyle piled some wings on his plate and opened a little styrofoam container of blue cheese dressing. \"Wow. Sounds like it.\" Sawyer returned his soda to the table and picked up his plate. \"It was pretty cool. WHOI was my favorite, though, I think.\" His eyes lit up as he remembered something he had wanted to tell his cousin back in the Fall, but had never gotten the chance to. He set his plate back down and leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. \"I got to see Alvin!\" \"Alvin?\" Sawyer nodded. \"Yeah, you know…the submersible that was used in the Titanic exploration back in the '80s.\" Kyle smiled at his cousin's excitement and swallowed a bite of blue cheese drenched hot wing. \"Oh yeah. That is pretty cool!\" The plate of pizza resumed its position in the lap of the teenager. He took another bite and washed it down with a gulp of soda. \"It's had a lot of improvements since then, of course. It actually had a major overhaul pretty recently, so that it could go even deeper into the ocean than before. Usually Alvin is aboard a research vessel named Atlantis, but it was in Woods Hole for a sort of checkup, so we got to see it.\" \"That's pretty neat, Sawyer. I can see why WHOI was your favorite.\" Sawyer smiled. \"The other places were also pretty cool…but yeah.\" He reached for some wings. \"Anna said it was her favorite, too.\" \"Oh yeah?\" Kyle casually took a sip of soda. \"You spent a lot of time with Anna?\" Sawyer grabbed a napkin from a pile next to the pizza box and wiped some errant blue cheese from his face. \"Yeah, I guess. She sort of adopted me from the beginning. She said that the two of you were friends, so we should be friends, too.\" He then gave his cousin a reproachful look. \"She also told me that you had asked her to look out for me.\" Kyle raised his chin haughtily. \"I can neither confirm nor deny that statement.\" Sawyer shook his head with a small smile. \"Whatever. I thought you were studying to be a doctor, not a lawyer.\" Kyle just laughed and dug back into his wings. Both cousins ate in companionable silence for a little while, content just to be in each other's company. Kyle finished first and pushed his plate away. \"So…you like Anna?\" Sawyer looked up from his wings in mild confusion. We're still talking about Anna? \"Of course. She's great. She's kind of like you….only a girl.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"She's older than me, but I'm comfortable with her. We get along really well and she's easy to talk to. She looks out for me….stuff like that.\" He narrowed his eyes slightly. \"Why?\" \"Oh, no reason. Just curious.\" Kyle began clearing off the coffee table. \"You done?\" Sawyer snagged one more wing. \"Yeah, I'm good. Thanks.\" The older cousin grinned and stood up, carrying the pile of stuff into the kitchen. \"You're welcome.\" Sawyer watched him walk away. Just curious, huh? He knew that – as a fifteen year old boy – he could be pretty oblivious most of the time, but even he could see that his cousin was trying to hide interest in a certain auburn haired beauty. Come to think of it, he had actually noticed the very same tendency with Anna whenever he mentioned Kyle. Hmmm…interesting. He wasn't quite sure what to do about it, or even if he should do anything about it. Anna and Kyle were both adults – as weird as it was for him to think of Kyle as an adult – and adults tended to not appreciate teens interfering in their personal lives…no matter how much they may like the particular teen. Besides, he'd feel pretty awkward even if he tried. What did he know about romance ? Hazel wouldn't feel awkward…she'd just jump right in! He smiled at the thought – he was pretty sure that awkward wasn't even in his best friend's vocabulary. She was fearless, that one! He'd heard people say that homeschoolers were super shy and backward….well, they had obviously never met Hazel Haskett! He smirked. Shy is another word that probably doesn't exist in her vocabulary. It was one of the reasons he loved her. Wait, LOVE? Where did that come from? Jolted out of his reverie, he set his plate down. Hazel is just my FRIEND. I mean, she IS my BEST friend…but so is Winter. I don't love Winter…well, I DO…but not THAT way, obviously. That would be BEYOND creepy! It's just like that with Hazel…well, not JUST like that…Hazel isn't a wild animal, obviously. And it definitely wouldn't be creepy to love her that way…but I don't. Do I? We are JUST friends…right? Sawyer felt like he was clumsily stumbling around in his own mind. He definitely felt confused…and kind of uncomfortable…but he had absolutely no idea what to do about it. Lately, when it came to thoughts of a certain freckled blonde, he felt about as graceless as Rufus. He fell back into the chair with a sigh. Awkward is definitely a part of MY vocabulary . TBC[Chapter 3] Here's Chapter 3! Thank you to those who have reviewed and those who have favorited/are following this story. I hope you enjoy this installment! As always, nothing but the plot and any original characters belong to me! 3. Kyle walked out of the kitchen, completely unaware of his cousin's flustered state. \"So, tomorrow is Christmas Eve. It's going to be pretty crazy for you to have to do your Christmas shopping then.\" Sawyer shook himself out of his jumbled thoughts. \"Christmas shopping? I don't need to do any Christmas shopping.\" Kyle resumed his seat on the overstuffed couch. \"No?\" \"No, I took care of that while I was away.\" His cousin leaned back and crossed his arms. \"Really? You took care of it while you were away…..on a sailboat in the South Pacific ?\" Sawyer grinned. \"Yeah, actually.\" \"What, you wrote us all poetry or something?\" The young man gave his cousin an incredulous look. \"Poetry? Really, Kyle?\" \"Well, what else could you do for gifts when you're on a boat?\" \"We weren't on the boat the whole time, you know.\" Sawyer leaned back and crossed his own arms. \"We made port stops in Auckland, Christchurch, Dunedin, and Wellington.\" He turned his body a little more towards his cousin and propped his elbow on the arm of the chair. \"Isn't it weird that there's a Dunedin in New Zealand, just like in Florida?\" Kyle nodded. \"It's definitely not the most common of names.\" \"Yeah….it's not much like our Dunedin, though. Anyway, I did most of my shopping in Auckland, since it was right at the beginning of the trip. I figured I'd be pretty busy with research and stuff once we got started.\" \"Smart. What kind of stuff did you get?\" Sawyer's eyes lit up. \"I can show you, if you want. Well, not yours, obviously….but I can show you everybody else's.\" \"Yeah, let's see what you got.\" Sawyer jumped up excitedly, disposed of his plate in the kitchen, and jogged back to the bedrooms. He returned just a few minutes later with his arms full of what appeared to be a bunched up beach towel. He sat back down in the recliner with the bundle on his lap, then began unwrapping the top. \"I couldn't get anything big, since whatever I got had to fit into my duffel bag.\" He reached into the nest of fabric and pulled out a small octagonal-shaped wooden box with a paua inlay in the shape of a flower. \"I got this for Mom.\" He pointed to the design on the lid. \"This flower is called a 'Kowhai'. It's kind of the unofficial flower of New Zealand.\" Kyle smiled. \"It's pretty.\" Sawyer nodded his agreement. \"Yeah….you should see the real thing.\" He then opened the box and pulled out a metal chain attached by a ring to a beautifully carved heart-shaped pendant of delicate wood overlaying mother of pearl. He held it up for Kyle to see. \"I got her this necklace, too. The carving is called Kowhaiwhai. It's an old art form of the Maori.\" \"Maori?\" Sawyer looked up from the gift. \"Oh….the Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand.\" \"Cool! Aunt Lorraine's gonna love that!\" Sawyer smiled and put the necklace back into the box, then set it on the coffee table. He reached into the towel again and pulled out another wooden octagonal-shaped box. This one also had a paua inlay, but it was in the shape of a bird. \"I got this one for Hazel.\" As with his mother's box, he pointed to design on the lid. \"This is a Kiwi. They are native to New Zealand. They're kind of funny little birds, but they are pretty cool….really unique. Like Hazel. I thought she'd like it.\" Kyle smiled. \"I'm sure she will.\" He cocked his head to the side. \"Is there a necklace in that one, too?\" Sawyer grinned. \"Yes, as a matter of fact.\" He opened the box and pulled out a sterling silver chain attached to a round silver pendant a little smaller than a quarter. Pressed into the circle were three vertical eternity symbols intersected by two horizontal eternity symbols, looking much like three interlocking crosses. \"This is a Hapu pendant. The lady at the shop said that it represents extended family and friends who are like family.\" He let Kyle get a good look at it, then returned the pendant to the box and closed the lid. \"I figured we were all kind of like family at the aquarium, so….\" Kyle smiled warmly at his cousin. \"Wow, Sawyer…..that's really thoughtful!\" He leaned forward with his elbows on his knees. \"A special gift for a special girl, right?\" \"Right.\" Wait! No! Sawyer blushed furiously as he set the box next to the other one already on the table. \"I mean…um….Hazel's my best friend….she was the first friend I ever really had – other than you, but you don't count since you're related to me – and I just thought…\" Kyle smirked. \"I get it, Sawyer….it's okay.\" He gestured to the bundle. \"What else have you got in there?\" Oh wow….Sawyer likes Hazel! He LIKES likes her! How could I have missed that before? He thought back over the past Summer and was startled to realize something else. Hazel likes Sawyer, too! He felt like a complete idiot….it seemed so obvious to him now. Well, they do say that hindsight is 20/20 . He wasn't quite sure what to do about these new revelations, or even if he should do anything about it. Sawyer and Hazel were teenagers, and teens tended to not appreciate adults - as weird as it sometimes still was for Kyle to think of himself as an adult - interfering in their personal lives….no matter how much they may like the particular adult. Anna would know exactly what to do about this. Woah! Where did that come from? Why am I thinking about her right now? He shook his head to try to clear his thoughts. FOCUS…..on SAWYER, Kyle! Sawyer looked up from rummaging around in his stash, completely oblivious to his cousin's state of mind. \"I got this for Mr. Haskett.\" In his hands was a mahogany box that he opened to reveal an antique brass nautical compass. \"I got it at a little antique shop in Wellington. I thought he could use it on his sailboat….you know, since Rufus broke his other one.\" \"Sawyer, that is awesome! I'm sure he'll love it!\" The teen ducked his head. \"I hope so.\" He set the box on the table with the other gifts, then once again reached into the makeshift bag. He had a mischievous smile on his face as he pulled out the next item. \"I got this for Dr. Clay.\" Kyle noticed his cousin's expression and eyed the small nondescript box somewhat suspiciously. \"What is it?\" Sawyer handed him the box. \"Take a look.\" Kyle opened the box, surprised and a little confused at the same time by what he found. Staring up at him was the white face of a man's chrome wristwatch. Why in the world would this make Sawyer grin like that? He was about to comment when Sawyer spoke again. \"Take a good look.\" Kyle did. It's a really nice watch, but I don't…..wait, what in the world? \"The numbers are backwards! It goes counter-clockwise!\" He looked back up to see his cousin nodding with a huge grin on his face. \"Before I left, Dr. Clay told me this story about his first boat trip to Australia and New Zealand. He said that everyone kept telling him that the toilets in the Southern Hemisphere flushed in the opposite direction of the ones in the Northern Hemisphere – that they flushed counter-clockwise.\" \"Do they?\" Sawyer chuckled. \"No. The design of a toilet is the only thing that determines which way the water will go down…..it doesn't matter if you are in New Zealand or New York. Dr. Clay tried to explain that to people, but they just told him that it was only a matter of time until he saw that he was wrong – that once he actually got down there, he'd see.\" Kyle chuckled with his cousin. \"I'm sure that Dr. Clay will get a good laugh out of this, then.\" He closed the box and added it to the collection of gifts slowly filling up his coffee table. \"Got anything else in that magic towel of yours? What about Dr. McCarthy? Did you get anything for him?\" \"Yeah, I did. There was this custom bowtie shop in Christchurch. I got him a couple of silk ties - one is red with little blue dolphins on it and the other one is green with little brown kiwis on it.\" He reached down into the bunched up towel and brought out the bowties for the college student to see. \"Nice….definitely a good gift for him. Anything else?\" Sawyer started carefully returning the gifts to the soft fabric piled on his lap. \"Well, there's yours, but I already told you that you can't see it. I have a couple of t-shirts in my duffel bag for Uncle Max and Aunt Alyce. They specifically told me that if I insisted on bringing them something back, that is all they'd accept….and postcards. So, I got them some of those, too.\" Kyle shook his head and laughed lightly. \"Yup, that sounds like my parents.\" Sawyer smiled and nodded. \"The rest are just some small odds and ends for people at the aquarium.\" \"Well done, Sawyer. I'm impressed.\" He grinned impishly. \"But I'll bet the ladies would still have appreciated some poetry, too.\" Sawyer threw a pillow at his cousin, then got up and started heading back to the bedrooms with his precious cargo. He glanced at a clock on the wall. \"It's getting late…shouldn't we be heading to bed? Our plane leaves at 5AM tomorrow, right?\" \"Right!\" Kyle collected their empty soda cans and put them into the recycle bin in the kitchen, before following Sawyer down the hall. \"Set your alarm for 3AM, okay? I want to make sure that we get to the airport early enough to get through all the TSA security without a problem.\" Sawyer nodded sleepily as he turned into the bedroom that was his for the night. \"Okay. 'Night, Kyle.\" \"'Night, Sawyer. It's great to have you back!\" TBC[Chapter 4] Here's Chapter 4...my apologies for taking so long to update! Life and a full-time job tend to get in the way of any creative writing. Thanks so much to those who have favorited this story, as well as those who are following it. It is tremendously flattering to know that people enjoy the story enough to want to keep up with it! =) Thank you also to those of you who have reviewed! I have never - and will never - ask for reviews, but I do very much appreciate them! So, I want to make sure to acknowledge those who have taken the time to share their thoughts - a huge thank you goes out to all of you who have done so! (You know who you are.) As always, nothing but the plot and any original characters belong to me! 4. Sawyer and Kyle both breathed sighs of relief as they walked into the baggage claim area of the Tampa Bay Airport. It was wonderful to be back in the warmth of their own home state, but it was even more wonderful to be free of the cramped confines of the plane...not to mention also being blessedly free of the four year old boy with fiery hair (and a personality to match) that had kicked the backs of their seats off and on for almost the entire flight. They had endured nearly five hours of his incessant obnoxiousness, though it had certainly felt much longer than that. They shook their heads as the heinous child made a bee-line for the conveyer belts. His frazzled mother managed to grab him just as he was leaping onto a moving belt. He screamed and kicked his displeasure as she yanked him back, but the woman was undeterred and held onto him with an iron grip. She whisked him away to the bathroom, much to the delight of those around them. Sawyer felt like cheering, but restrained himself. He did not think that such behavior would be appropriate - given the setting - but he also had a sneaking suspicion that this particular group of people would not even remotely have a problem with it. In fact, he was pretty certain that most - if not all - of them would actually cheer with him. He was tempted, but settled for just sharing commiserating glances with his fellow passengers as they all waited patiently for their flight's assigned belt to start bringing up the luggage. \"Thank God you were never like that, Sawyer!\" The young man looked up at his cousin. \"Are you kidding? My mom would have KILLED me if I acted like that!\" \"You got that right, kid.\" Sawyer swung around at the sound of the familiar feminine voice behind him. \"Mom!\" Lorraine pulled her son into a tight hug that he returned unreservedly. \"Oh, I missed you, Sawyer!\" \"I missed you too, Mom.\" She pulled back, keeping her hands on his shoulders. \"Have you grown? You look taller.\" \"I don't know…maybe.\" She brushed his hair from his forehead. \"Your hair has definitely grown. You need a haircut.\" \"Mooommm. It's not that long.\" She ignored his comment and studied his face. \"You've gotten some sun, too. You look kind of tan.\" \"Oh please! Sawyer ? Tan ? As if that would ever happen. Freckled, maybe…but tan ? No way.\" Sawyer looked over his mother's shoulder and grinned at the sight that met his eyes. \"Hazel!\" He stepped around Lorraine, crossed his arms, and arched an eyebrow at the impudent young woman before him. \"You're one to talk about freckles .\" Hazel ducked her head with a sheepish grin and unconsciously ran a finger down her nose. \"Yeah yeah. I know.\" She glanced back up to her friend, only to find him watching her with an unreadable expression on his face. Her smile faltered slightly as she suddenly felt a little nervous, though she was at a complete loss as to why she should feel that way. What is there to be nervous about? This was Sawyer – her very best friend in the whole world – she never felt nervous around him. She loved him. Whoa...wait, what? Love? Who said anything about love? She blinked and suddenly realized that she and Sawyer had just been staring at each other. That wouldn't do. Sawyer was finally home after three very long months away and she was beyond ecstatic about it. She was NOT going to allow their reunion to become awkward just because she was inexplicably experiencing some arbitrary musings. Get it together, Haskett! Although it did take a bit of effort on her part, she managed to dismiss the confusing whirl of thoughts trying to make themselves at home and plastered on her usual exuberant smile. \"Welcome home, Sawyer! I've missed…\" Strong lean young arms wrapped around her, causing pleased surprise to cascade throughout her entire body. \"…you.\" Sawyer hugged his best friend tightly. He didn't even care that he could feel the beginnings of a blush creeping up his neck and cheeks as she returned the hug. \"I missed you too, Hazel.\" Lorraine smiled at the teenagers, then shifted her attention to her nephew. Kyle had been observing the reunion with unmasked interest - and a not so subtle grin - but quickly schooled his features when he saw his aunt turning towards him. She pulled him into a warm hug, just as she had done with her son. \"Welcome home, Kyle. It's good to see you.\" Kyle hugged her back. \"It's good to see you too, Aunt Lorraine.\" She pulled back, the smile still on her face. \"Thanks for staying up in Boston to pick up Sawyer. I know your break started a couple of weeks ago and there was nothing else keeping you there. I want you to know that I really appreciate it.\" \"No problem! He's my favorite cousin, after all.\" Lorraine crossed her arms and raised an eyebrow. \"He's your only cousin, Kyle.\" Kyle grinned. \"Like I told Sawyer, that's just a technicality.\" Lorraine chuckled and shook her head. She then gestured towards the bathrooms where the exhausted mother had dragged her unpleasant offspring. \"I'm guessing your flight was a little more eventful than you would have liked?\" Sawyer stepped back over to his mother, just as his cousin was about to answer. \"Ugh. You have NO idea, Mom.\" Kyle nodded. \"That kid was…um...well…he was definitely something .\" \"He was evil, that's what he was.\" Hazel walked over to Kyle, giving him a quick hug of welcome as Sawyer continued. \"He kicked our seats practically the whole time. He wanted more than one bag of peanuts and screamed until he got what he wanted, then he threw them all over the place.\" Kyle joined in, thinly veiled annoyance in his voice. \"He spillled his drinks everywhere. He made a million trips to the bathroom. He ran up and down the aisles with his arms out like this...\" He demonstrated by holding each of his arms straight out at his sides. \"…pretending to be a plane and whacking everyone in the aisle seats.\" He grimaced. \"I was in one of those seats.\" Hazel glanced back and forth between the cousins in mild shock. \"Wow…..that's awful! The flight attendants just put up with that?\" Sawyer shrugged. \"They tried to stop him, but there wasn't a lot they could do. They don't want to get sued or anything. And it's not like they could've just asked them to leave.\" \"No kidding. Man, it was like you guys were trapped and tortured.\" A rueful smile crept to Sawyer's face at Hazel's remark. \"I think that's a pretty good way to describe it.\" He shifted his gaze to his cousin. \"Wouldn't you say, Kyle?\" \"Definitely.\" Further conversation was temporarily cut off as the luggage belt behind them abruptly began its weary march, drawing the focused attention of all those clustered around it. The boys each alternately managed to snag their bags off of the moving track as it made its cycle. They slung the duffels over their shoulders, then followed the ladies out to the parking lot. Lorraine draped her arm across her son's shoulder. \"So, it's Christmas Eve…\" The expression on Sawyer's face clearly conveyed that he felt that she had just stated something pretty obvious. \"Yeah, I know. So?\" \"So, it's kind of a hassle to have to shop on Christmas Eve, and a lot of businesses even close early. If you want to get your shopping done in time, we'll have to...\" Kyle chimed in with a grin. \"Oh, Sawyer doesn't need to do any Christmas shopping, Aunt Lorraine. He took care of that while he was away.\" Lorraine threw her nephew a skeptical look. \"While he was away?\" He grinned wider. \"Yup.\" Hazel looked as skeptical as Lorraine. \"On a boat ?\" Sawyer rolled his eyes. \"Seriously, guys! I wasn't on the boat the whole time. Sheez!\" Kyle was amused, but did his best to contain it. He readjusted the bag on his shoulder and glanced out to the lot. \"So, where did you park, Aunt Lorraine?\" TBC[Chapter 5] Hello all! Welcome back to those of you who have stuck with this story despite the fact that it has been 15 months since I last updated it - you all rock! Thank you so much for sticking with it! Welcome to those of you who are reading this story for the first time! (You rock, too!) I'm sorry that it has taken me so long to continue the story, but real life and a full-time job have this annoying tendency to make demands on my time...and rightfully so, truth be told. That said, I truly never intended to leave the story hanging for as long as I did. (Sadly, it is not even a record for me - I once unintentionally left my other story hanging for about 4 years. I'm not proud of this. *Shame Face*) I will try to do better, but I can make no promises...other than to promise to try - which I do. I mean that I promise...to try, not to do. I mean I DO promise to TRY to do better...yeah. Ah, my eloquence astounds you, does it not? ;) Thank you also to all of you who are following/have favorited this story! It makes me happy that you like it enough to ensure that you are able to keep reading it! A big thank you definitely goes to those of you who have reviewed and encouraged me to update, as well! As always, nothing but the plot and any original characters belong to me! And now, without further ado: 5. Sawyer and Kyle tossed their bags into the back of Lorraine's SUV, then piled into it with the typical grace of men in their teens and twenties. Kyle took the front passenger seat next to his aunt, while Sawyer hopped into the back passenger side seat next to Hazel. The young woman grinned at Sawyer as he clicked his seat belt into place. \"So…Christmas shopping was a part of your grand adventure, huh?\" Sawyer rolled his eyes, but couldn't resist returning the grin. \"I guess you could say that. Really, though, it's more like I actually took a break from my 'grand adventure' so that I could get my shopping done. I knew I wouldn't have enough time once I got back.\" \"Oh, come on! You mean to tell me it wasn't an adventure shopping in a foreign country?\" Sawyer sat back into his seat as his mother skillfully maneuvered the car back out of its parking spot. \"Well, yeah. I mean, it was definitely different. But I've gotta admit, it was pretty cool too.\" Hazel's grin instantly transitioned from teasing to enthusiastic, as she unconsciously leaned almost imperceptibly towards him. \"I bet it was! It would be SO cool to be able to do that! I'm actually kind of jealous.\" Straightening up, she readjusted her position so that she could more directly face him, turning her body and pulling her right knee up onto the seat until she was sitting sort of half Indian style. \"Was it hard figuring out the difference in currency? Was it fun hearing the accents? Do they barter there, or do they have set prices? Do they have sales tax? Were things expensive? Do they have the same kind of stuff there as we have here, or was stuff there totally different? What did you get me?\" The rush of words abruptly ceased as Hazel suddenly realized how far her excited curiosity had taken her. The enthusiasm disappeared from her eyes as they widened in dismay at her verbal faux pas. Her face blossomed in color as she sputtered on in uncharacteristic embarrassment. \"I didn't mean…I just thought, you know, if you had gotten me something…but it's totally okay, if not! It's not like I expect you to get me gifts or anything. I just…um…\" Sawyer held up his hand. \"Hazel, relax. It's okay. I've given you a gift every Christmas since we've met. Why would this year be any different?\" Relieved and pleased by her friend's unaffected response to her atypical self-conscious prattling, Hazel smiled sheepishly. \"Okay.\" Sawyer crossed his arms and threw her an impish smirk. \"I'm not telling you what I got for you, though. You'll just have to wait until tonight.\" He hesitated, then glanced from Hazel to his mother and back. \"I mean, if you guys are still coming to our house tonight. That's still the plan, right?\" Hazel's face took on an impish smirk of her own. \"Sawyer, relax. We've come to your house every Christmas Eve since we've met. Why would this year be any different?\" He laughed and replied just as she had. \"Okay.\" Kyle, who had not so subtly been eavesdropping on the teens, turned a bit towards the backseat. \"Hey, Hazel?\" \"Yeah, Kyle?\" \" I know what Sawyer got for you.\" She glanced slyly at her best friend before replying with interest. \"Oh really ?\" \"Yeah, he showed it to me.\" Kyle looked to his left. \"I know what he got for you , too, Aunt Lorraine. You know, just in case you were wondering.\" Sawyer bristled immediately. \"Kyle! Don't you dare!\" Kyle plastered on the most innocent expression he could manage, but the effect was rather ruined by his complete inability to keep the puckish mirth from showing on his face. \"How do you girls feel about poetry?\" Hazel blinked. \"Poetry?\" \"Kyle! Seriously! You know I did not write poetry!\" \"Okay, settle down, boys.\" Lorraine dutifully gave her nephew a stern, albeit amused, look. \"Kyle, you will not say what gifts Sawyer has for anyone . We'll all find out when we open them. No sooner. Understand?\" He laughed and gave her a cheeky salute. \"Yes, ma'am! \" \"Thanks, Mom.\" Lorraine very briefly glanced back over her shoulder to give her son a warm and loving smile. However, being the responsible driver that she was, she wasted no time in returning her attention to the road before her. \"For the record, though, I wouldn't have minded if you had written me a poem, honey.\" Sawyer sighed dramatically, \"Thanks a lot, Kyle.\" Kyle swiveled back to face his cousin. \"Come on, Sawyer. You know I was just joking, right? It was just a little misdirection; that's all. I'd never really tell them anything! It'd break the guy code of honor. I mean, they are girls, after all.\" The younger man laughed as both women simultaneously exclaimed in protest. \"Yeah Kyle, I know.\" Kyle grinned and winked at his cousin. He nodded subtly (but meaningfully) towards the female half of the car, then resumed his forward facing position. The grin never left his face, even when his aunt flashed him a raised eyebrow. If anything, it grew wider. Lorraine was pretty sure she heard him chuckling to himself as he turned his head to glance out of the window. She shook her head with a roll of her eyes. Boys. Sawyer relaxed back into his seat, sporting a grin of his own. Hazel was shooting him some serious looks, but he knew her well enough to know that it was just an act - she wasn't really upset at all. In fact, he could sense her amusement (admittedly mixed with a touch of exasperation) bubbling just under the surface. No one could ever say that Hazel Haskett wasn't a good sport – it was part of what made teasing her so much fun. He knew his mom also took the antics of her son and nephew in stride, and was not in the least offended by the pseudo-snub. Nevertheless, he made a show of smoothing over their mock outrage by regaling them with amusing stories of his Christmas shopping adventures in New Zealand. Kyle had heard the stories on the plane already, but was glad for the opportunity to hear them again without the obnoxious and incessant interruptions of an unruly urchin who was the epitome of a holy terror. Time flew by as the young 'adventurer' was peppered with a steady flow of questions and comments from each of his traveling companions. He was so engrossed in the conversation that he didn't pay any attention to the world outside of the car, until Lorraine pulled to a stop in a certain parking lot. She backed into an empty spot, then shifted the car into park and shut off the ignition. She turned to her son with a huge smile on her face and said, \"I thought you might want to stop here for a bit before heading back to the house.\" Hazel piped in, \"Yeah, and she needed to drop me off here anyway, so…\" Sawyer blinked, then ducked his head to glance through the windshield. With effort, he managed to shift his focus from where he had been to where he actually was . A huge smile of his own broke out on his face as his eyes lit upon the oh so familiar façade of his most favorite place in the world - Clearwater Marine Aquarium. \"All right!\" Sawyer had his belt off in record speed and jumped out of the car, taking off at a run for the employee entrance. \"Hey, wait for me!\" To her extreme aggravation, Hazel's seat belt was not quite as accommodating as Sawyer's had been and she had to wrestle with it to get it to release. Come on! Finally the obstinate thing grudgingly freed her and she flew out of the car. Sawyer was already out of sight, so she pumped her legs all the harder to catch up. Reaching the building quickly, she barely pulled the glass door open before darting through it. Lorraine and Kyle both just laughed and shook their heads, following behind the teens at a more leisurely pace. Sawyer ran at a breakneck speed, excitement overtaking him. He flew up the stairs and around to the dolphin pens. His incredible familiarity with the building allowed him to maintain his rapid pace all the way to his desired destination. Nevertheless, it was still a miracle that he made it there without any collisions. He'd barely managed to dodge Rufus (and was pretty sure that the twinge at the side of his lower back meant he'd pulled a muscle doing so), but he couldn't find it in him to be annoyed. Not today. He skidded to a stop at the edge of the pool that was practically a second home to him, his eyes scanning the water before he had even come to a complete stop. After what seemed like an eternity, but was in fact only seconds, his eyes found what they were searching for. \"Winter!\" TBC ","Summary":" Hello to everyone who takes a moment to stop by and read this story! Welcome! I love both Dolphin T"},{"Movie":"Emperor's New Groove","Title":"The Emperor's New Groove: Montezuma's Revenge","Author":"Jezzikins","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12534935","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Emperor's New Groove: Montezuma's Revenge Act One: The Jaguar's Paw Long ago, somewhere in a kingdom far away … The sky was painted a dark azure, deeper than the most spacious oceans, dimmed by the abundance of thick storm clouds rolling over the curvature of a massive palace's golden roof. These were not natural storm clouds however. Sure, they bled with thunder, lightning and rain… slowly bellowing overhead, but they served as harbingers of a more sinister apparition arising on the horizon. Trails of vivid blue static illuminated the skies as the wind howled in unison with the guttural growls from an enormous shadowy figure… a creature hardly recognizable against the backdrop below save for those translucent glowing red eyes, as it climbed higher onto the building. Normally, the shining Mesoamerican fortress would seem intimidating in its own right - an impressive edifice guised as a stylized visage overlooking its subjects from a steep hilltop seat - but now its radiance was blotted out by scores of living shadows creeping higher. The myriad of people gathered in the wet, bleak, twisting city streets looked up in shock and awe; their symbol of the kingdom overtaken by this monster. The countless stairways leading to the effigy were drowned in darkness… and all seemed lost in this depressing atmosphere. A resonating roar issued from the creature, resounding its intent, but it paused when yet another figure appeared on the scene. A young rain-drenched fallen king - his once elaborate robes of crimson and saffron tattered and billowing against soaring winds - stood as an affront to it. His reedy shape threatened to topple over against the weight of the gales and his long sopping black hair framed his slowly-becoming-despondent expression. AND PAUSE! Um…. What? Thanks, you did an excellent job with that astounding visual opening there, but I think I can handle it from here… But… I'm the writer… Aw, poor baby. Well this story IS about me isn't it? Well, yeah, it is. Then I think it's pretty obvious YOU need to take a hike, sister! I mean, what do you think you're trying to pull here? Really…? Would you take a gander at that guy… he's washed up (literally)… and broken… a far cry from the powerful emperor he should be, right? That's kinda the idea, ya know. It's called a 'fake out'. Well I don't like it. You could've picked a better place to start. Alright… well you know how this ends so just go ahead and do your riff-style commentary like you like to do… Thank you… Yep, it's me again… Emperor Kuzco!.. in yet another life-threatening situation. It's funny, they worship you like a God but they don't tell you about the countless death threats or in this case, giant shadowy figures, you'll come in contact with… No! It just comes with the territory of being Emperor. So yeah, I guess you're probably wondering how THIS PARTICULAR exploit came to pass…? Well for the answer to that, we have to go back a bit… The llama emperor and his newly found best friend embraced, happily rejoicing at their victory of securing the human-transforming potion. NO, no… we did that already…! It was a beautiful sunny day in Pacha's village. Kids played in the shallow pools below as adults enjoyed a nice picnic on the riverbank - catering provided by Kronk and the staff of Mudka's Meat Hut. Okay… no… but I think you're getting warmer…. Upon the outlying roadways of the hilly terrain, a black jaguar stalked the sight before him. Massive paws kneaded the patchy earth, gleaming eyes darted to and fro, and hot breath seared past drool-laced fangs as he led an enigmatic group - five sets of bead-shackled sandaled feet following closely behind into the fringes of the far-reaching empire. Oh yeah! Here's a good place to start! The air had a slight haze to it, nothing too unusual... though it left a lingering tinge of grey. Their destination, the vibrant monolith of the palace, was visible above a scattering of thin clouds in the distance - a beacon from the mists. Approaching this palace, you'd see several two-toned painted guards lined at the entrance, alert - well most of them anyway. There are the occasional one or two that are picking their nose or staring into the sky dreaming about how it might've been like to have taken that job as an osteologist. At the current time, within the sunlit throne room, a steady stream of grievances could be heard as a shaky old man dressed in periwinkle read aloud from a thick stack of parchments tied together in ribbons. From atop his large outcropped throne, the young emperor slunk back with his lips pursed together and strummed his fingers against the armrests - the very picture of boredom. As he listened, an angled black brow raised impulsively. \"…So, in conclusion, your highness,\" Rudy cleared his throat, \"It would seem to reason that every eatery or public place in the kingdom have a special lift or cart for us senior citizens to accommodate our weak knees. I mean, do you realize how hard it is for us to get up all these stairs!?\" I try to be a good leader and all, listening to the multitude of complaints and problems from the citizens… but you never really get used to it… \"Rudy, I'm not the one who constructed this city ya know…\" He groaned and slunk back further, allowing his semicircular crown to droop toward his face. \"Of course, of course, but they do say change is good…\" the old man cheerfully replied. A tuft of sable hair poked out from underneath Kuzco's sliding crown. After a moment, he slumped forward to fix it, throwing his hands to his knees and blew at his bangs. The rest of his hair swept from behind his ears and traveled down his back slightly past his shoulder blades - tied loosely toward the end by a red strip that danced with every motion of his head. \"Tsk tsk, Rudy… I'm surprised…\" He shook his head, eager to try a new approach, \"I really would've thought someone of your generation would WANT to keep the old traditions and history behind this kingdom. Don't you think, by MY interfering with the way things are built, it…mmm…might go against all of that?\" \"Hmm…\" Rudy put a bony digit to his chin and tapped in thought. \"Yeah - but I don't care - now if I could have your attention on the matter of trash collection…!\" YOU SEE! Some people are never satisfied. Meanwhile, the troupe of strangers made their way through the increasingly busy walkways. Merchants and travelers frequented the capital city often, but none gathered quite as many stares or responses as this group did. Besides the unusual choice of a massive unleashed jaguar as a pet (at which many were taken aback by), the five figures were draped in the dark fur of their animal counterpart - long robes of it melding into various other pelts enveloping their lower extremes. A hood made from the head of the jaguar pelt graced their faces; their dark eyes peering through the same sockets the animal itself had once seen through and ornate headdresses of different feathers fraying from behind the ears. They varied in size and shape - a particular one with a few pouches tied at the hip seemed to be quite small and curvy, one was obviously a muscle-bound behemoth while another thinner one brandished a twisted staff, and yet another crooked-looking fellow jittered around slightly. But they all wore ceremonial feathered shields tied to their backs, beads and assorted furs adorning their spindly legs. Their feet, along with what little skin was shown, was covered in mud and paint barely visible through bits and pieces; dry fragments clung to their coated toes poking out knotted straw sandals. As appearances dictated… they seemed to be a rough bunch. The way they strode into town, all in a row, as if to announce their arrival as something significant, told the other passersby to stay clear. Their faces may not have been visible, but it was evident by their strides that they were of a warrior class. A hush fell through the city as they made their way inward. Nothing but frightened looks and confusion painted the villagers' faces. As if to incite the response further, the jaguar hissed and swiped toward any that came too close. His luminous yellow eyes darted through the plethora of potential targets, but one made his maw salivate all too easily. A meek looking llama with mottled fur and a notched ear shook against its restraints; captive by the reins that held him to his potato-farmer owner's cart. The jaguar let out an intimidating roar and pounced. People nearby scattered and screamed… and the alerted vendor and his llama clung to each other, shrieking in terror. But just as the big cat hurtled toward them, he was yanked back and pulled to the ground. A toned arm painted in amber resin had emerged from one of the travelers' cloaks and large claws covering the gnarled fingers were locked in a firm grip around the animal's tail. \"Down, Huaca… it's not time to feast just yet…\" A deep scratching voice issued from the figure. He turned his limber form to the two cowering. \"I'm sorry… he, like the rest of us…is just anxious to dine on the spoils of this kingdom…\" He leaned forward, his toothy grin now visible to the quivering merchant and beast of burden. \"…but… we can wait…\" The merchant gulped. \"Hey! You there!\" a sharp cry rang out. The figure blinked and slowly turned his head. The rest of the jaguar gang stiffened up as they saw a guard approaching, however cautiously, with his spear drawn in front of him. A group of villagers were glued to his back, muttering frantically. \"I can't allow you to go any further into the city with that animal running about.\" The hard-nosed stiff barked. \"If you don't want it put down, I suggest you restrain it… or leave. And do it quickly.\" A couple more identical soldiers began to file into the square. Huaca's master lifted himself up and casually turned to face them. The villagers looked on curiously. He let a smirk grace his face. \"… then again… we HAVE waited long enough….\" Looks of surprise were mirrored by everyone as a huge silhouette blanketed the crowd. Back in the palace, Kuzco groaned in his seat and rubbed his temple. \"…and on the notion of summons deliveries…\" Rudy persisted, \" the scrolls are a little hard to open with my arthritis. If we could get the ribbons to be a little less taut, that would be much appreciated…\" \"If… he doesn't shut up….\" Kuzco muttered to himself. \"…oh! And the writing is a little unclear sometimes, maybe hire a new scribe while you're at it…\" Just as the emperor was about to loose it, he was interrupted by a cheerful squeak from behind. The squirrel, Bucky, chattered in amusement. \"Oh, ha ha ha… laugh all you want, Bucky… you're not the one who has to sit here for hours listening to this drivel.\" \"Hi there, Kuzco~!\" Small voices chimed in unison as Pacha and Chicha's tikes popped out from behind either side of his throne. \"Whoa-oh… mites in the palace - I better call an exterminator.\" They laughed at his joke as they walked around to face him. Chacka, on the left, currently wore a long-sleeved orange dress with a cord fastening it around the waist. Her hair was intertwined with ribbons as two locks of braids hung down in front of her. On her back, she toted the toddler Yupi in a bunched up in a carrying cloth fastened at her shoulders, who playfully grabbed her braids as if he was reining a llama. Tipo, on the right, was looking a lot like a younger version of his dad these days, complete with a trademark green poncho just his size. His short black hair bounced as he exuberantly jumped up and down. \"I caught a fish today by myself and then we gutted it.\" his face shifted. \"It was gross.\" \"…And I lost yet another tooth!\" Chacka whistled. \"You might want to watch it, Chacka. Pretty soon you'll be like gramps down there and have none…\" Kuzco joked. She smiled in response, showing several gaps. \"Hm.. Down there… wait! How'd you all get up here?\" \"We climbed.\" They both answered, with an added \"duh\" from Chacka. \"Uh…huh…maybe I SHOULD invest in some lifts… I wouldn't want you all to fall… not to mention, your parents probably wouldn't like it very much either. Wasn't Kronk supposed to be watching you today?\" \"There you kids are!\" Kronk arrived on cue. \"Haha, we haven't concluded our baking lessons yet…\" Bucky perched himself from the throne onto Kronk's shoulder, chirping happily. The big guy was decked out in the paint of an imperial guard which clashed heavily with the pink frilly apron he was wearing over his robes. \"But Kronk,\" Tipo whined, \"we just wanted to give Kuzco some of our cookies!\" \"Cookie!\" Yupi pipped. He reached into the satchel and offered up a smaller bag. Kuzco picked it up. \"Aww… you guys…\" He pulled the drawstring open and pulled out a cookie. \"Uh, K-Kuzco…\" Kronk stammered. Kuzco popped it in his mouth and was instantly met with a retching sensation. He struggled against the disgusting and dry flavor, covering his mouth in response. Kronk winced. \"Yeah… it was their first try…\" He uttered in Kuzco's ear. \"Mm..mm..m… gah…\" Kuzco swallowed through streaming tears. \"De..li…cious…\" He hacked up crumbs, ready to toss his own cookies. Chacka looked on in astonishment. \"Wow! He likes 'em so much, he's crying!\" \"Give him another!\" Tipo urged. \"NO! No…no….\" The children looked puzzled at Kuzco's response. \"I …wouldn't want to spoil my appetite…!\" The children seemed pleased with this and shrugged. Outside, six shadows streamed across the cobblestone road, enigmatic shapes unhindered by anything - zipping along the ground like magic controlled purveyors of disaster. One by one, those who were touched by these mystic apparitions fell to their knees under a weight of grief, as if some cold hand had pulled all the happiness from them. Villagers and soldiers in pursuit issued no threat to the intangibles either. They too were covered in darkness as the trail before them erupted with the hollow screams of a mass of shades - opaque demonic creatures. Slowly but steadily, the mounting sea of shadows made its way up the green slopes, the rocky terrain, toward the golden steps that the palace was perched upon. Bounding ahead, their speed was unreachable, leaving their trackers to suffocate in the wake of wraiths slowly spreading outward. Dark wisps sprung over the precipice that began the entrance into the palace - six pillars of obscurity grew up from the vertical incline. Stairways and walls lined with duo-dyed soldiers stirred as the figures landed before them. The red banners erected along the steps wafted against the icy gale that gushed forward. The shadowy forms wriggled into their coherent shapes, brushing off their inscrutable façades. Yellow eyes and white fangs bared from the large felid creature at the front while the cloaked others approached confidently. \"Halt!\" A guard cried out. \"W-whatever you are… y-you are not allowed here without clearance from the emperor!\" \"Clearance…?\" The leader chuckled, twirling a clawed hand. \"Oh we'll GET clearance…\" Chacka tisked at Rudy still rambling… \"…these floors are too slippery… someone could trip and sprain their ankle…\" While Tipo climbed into the throne with Kuzco. \"My birthday's coming up soon.\" The boy replied. \"Oh yeah, already? How old are you going to be..?\" Kuzco asked. Time sure did fly. \"…a hundred?\" \"What… nooooo! Seven!\" He giggled. \"Really, now? Hm… maybe for you're birthday, I'll let YOU be emperor for a day.\" He placed his crown on the kid's head, the weight drooping over his eyes. \"Sure would beat ME having to sit here.\" \"Heh heh I'd be like.. 'I'm the Emperor… Praise me!\" He puffed his chest out and Chacka laughed, joining the play. \"Wooow, you sure are awesome, Emperor Tipo!\" \"Yeah..\" Kronk added, winking at Bucky on his shoulder and then at the kids, \"Maybe even more than Kuzco…\" \"Okay lets not get the boy's hopes up.\" Kuzco joshed. Yupi cooed from Chacka's back. \"Tipo not emper'r. He poo.\" \"What! I am not 'poo'!\" The older brother returned. \"Mhm… Poo!\" He then gave his sibling a look like 'so there.' Chacka bounced the bag gently, just enough to startle the younger. \"Yupi, not nice.\" Tipo's face curled in disdain and it was evident he was ready to fire back some zinger. \"Okay okay…\" Kuzco intervened, placing his crown back upon his own head. He couldn't help but smile at the funny children. Sibling rivalries was something he never had to deal with. \"No fighting in the throne room…\" Just then, his attention was garnered by a frantic commotion outside. Within the halls, many servants dashed through, scrambling in and out of quarters. One of the interior guards sprinted past the main entrance doors, crying out and motioning to the other guards he saw. Puzzled looks and notions abounded as they ran towards the front of the palace to fight the unseen foe. Kuzco and the others stared toward the throne room doorway with curiosity, unaware of the turmoil beyond. Rudy was unperturbed by the clamor though even as the throne room subjects and guards sifted past him, herded by a soldier. \"Sire!\" the man threw himself down into a bow. \"Intruders… in the palace!\" \"WHAT!\" \"We're trying to stop them but it's… like they're demons…!\" Just then, as if some invisible force rocketed them, a mountain of guards burst through the doorway flying through the air. Their bodies hurtled, flopping against the floor and walls with sickening sounds. Shrieks issued from unseen victims behind them. Kuzco and the others jumped in alarm. \"Uh oh…\" Kronk replied, as he grabbed a lance from behind the throne. \"this could get bad…\" He threw his apron off over his shoulder and Bucky squeaked in agreement, standing alert with his tiny fists drawn. Kuzco gave the kids an urgent look. \"You three hide behind the throne.\" \"But…\" \"Do it.\" They did. He looked toward his men laying on the floor twisting in pain, the servants cowering in a corner, then anxiously at the entrance where cries of terror dwindled to an uncomfortable silence. He felt his heart beating in his ears. What was happening here? He desperately wanted to know how those beyond the entrance were faring, but panic glued him to his seat… and even if it hadn't he doubted he'd get very far. What kind of opponents could send the guards soaring into the air? Whoever these invaders were, it was obvious that they… were not normal. The room suddenly grew dim and foreboding as if the sun had been blotted out. A chill overtook them all - their breath becoming visible. What was this? Black magic? Through the bubble of bleakness, intimidating figures emerged, striding toward the elevated throne. Kuzco was sure his heart stopped. From below, one of the soldiers struggled, his body pitted with nasty bruises and scrapes and his disposition greatly depressed. \"We…couldn't stop them…\" \"Yeah…. I… see that…\" Kuzco almost said 'Thanks for the update' but figured sarcasm would further damper the already suffering guy's spirits. \"Just relax there, buddy….\" The man collapsed in a heap and Kuzco could not contain the look of concern. Kronk urged forward, stiffening his lip. He twittered something to Bucky who dashed off out of sight. \"Word's been sent to my militia…\" he whispered to the emperor, his eyes transfixed on the scene before them. \"They'll be here in no time.\" Kuzco looked up. \"You sure they can take these guys?\" \"Aw yeah. They're awesome.\" Kronk broke a confident smile. \"Well, I know that and all… but uh… \" \"Don't worry there, chief.\" Kronk quietly interjected, still not meeting his gaze. \"Our job's to protect and serve you and that's what we're going to do.\" There was some real weight behind those words. \"Whatever you say, pal…\" The jaguar's roar reverberated from below. The other five individuals formed a triangle behind him. The one directly behind the animal, his owner, lifted a mud-caked hand ending in black claw-like nails to cease the others. He walked passed Huaca with a sly, gleaming grin breaking across his mug. The rest of his face may have been hidden behind the jaguar headdress, but he still managed a look of annoyance as his head perked up abruptly… at the sound of an old voice accosting him. \"Excuse me, um…sir!\" Oh no! Rudy! Kuzco had completely forgotten he was still down there. \"I'm having an audience with the emperor right now… So, if you could just come back some other ti-\" With a swift movement, Rudy was batted to the side like nothing - knocked into the rest of the cowering subjects who toppled like pins. Irritation snapped Kuzco out of any fear he had and words spewed from his mouth before he could control himself. \"HEY! What's your deal? Just whatta ya think you're dong barging in here and then smacking the old guy? I mean, yeah, he IS kinda annoying… but you didn't have to smack him…!\" \"My apologies… you're majesty…\" the other's words, gravelly, were laced with bitterness, \"I GUESS I did get carried away.\" He shrugged. \"I just didn't wish there to be anymore delays.\" He flung his arms out melodramatically. \"Well, whatever you are, you definitely have my attention NOW.\" Kronk had to hold him back. The figure grimaced but continued. \"I…no, WE… have been waiting a long time to meet the illustrious emperor of the Four Regions…heh heh.\" He cackled madly. \"Eh 'heh heh'..\" Kuzco mocked. \"Wow, if you all were anymore clichéd evil I'd think you'd have your own lightning effects...\" \"Eh… beg your pardon?\" His brow furrowed. \"You don't realize who you're talking to…\" \"Oh no no, you're right. I don't. So please… PLEASE, enlighten me with, I'm sure, the eloquent introduction monologue you have prepared…\" \"You are absolutely right, my young emperor!\" He threw his fit arm forward, pointing a claw and flung back his hood to reveal a severely burned scarred face of caramel-colored skin with a black band painted across bulging eyes and globular schnoz, surrounded by splotches of dried red around his profile down to his neck blanketed in dark unkempt dreds of hair. His elephant ears were notched and along their edges were many asymmetrical piercings. Aw geez! This guy could give Yzma a run for her money! \"I am Montezuma, of the Jaguar Warriors!\" He roared. \"My men and I have traveled here far from the north, making a name for ourselves amongst the tributaries as the most fearsome of warrior priests! We serve under the great Tezcatlpoca, lord of darkness, as envoys to his vengeance against those that harmed our kingdom…\" He shook a fist wildly. \"Whoa… okay there Crazy, calm down. What are you going on about? I don't know a-ny-thing about a northern kingdom or this 'tackypocky' guy…\" \"His name is Tezcatlpoca!\" He screamed. \"Yeah okay, him, whoever… dunno…\" Kuzco rolled his eyes, getting increasingly more annoyed. \"What exactly does this all have to do with me?\" \"Well, I admit, it doesn't have much to do with you really. In fact, I was actually expecting someone else… someone older… to be inhabiting the throne… but I guess I can't be too picky. Either way, we carry an important proposition to the Emperor.\" Kuzco narrowed his eyes and crossed his arms. \"Okay, spill it.\" \"It's not complicated really.\" He sighed and twirled his hand in the air. \"Just give up your seat… and your life… and no one ELSE has to get hurt.\" Kuzco caught his breath along with the rest of the onlookers. For a moment, they were frozen in shock. Kuzco stayed firm but his eyes nervously darted around the room. Upon seeing his people's horrified looks however, he knew he couldn't show his own anxiety. He chuckled heartily as Kronk cracked a nervous smile, not really understanding. \"That's funny… did you hear that, Kronk? It's like they're declaring war on the kingdom or something…\" He slapped his leg in feigned humor. \"Haha, oh man… you guys are good. That has GOT to be the funniest thing I've heard all day!\" He wiped a fake tear from his eye. \"Shoo… do you realize how often I have to deal with death threats and psychos like you?\" He spied the bewildered looks on their half-covered mugs. \"I'll give you a hint. It's A LOT.\" The jaguar leader looked around and then at the other five situated behind him who shook their heads in equal confusion. \"I don't think you completely comprehend who's ACTUALLY in control of this situation. You only see what's before you, but beyond that entrance way there…\" He extended a clawed hand behind him, toward the doorway, \"Well… you could say your empire has already fallen…\" He let a hoarse laugh escape. \"Did you forget how easily we dispatched your guards?\" \"Hm, yeah?\" Kuzco nonchalantly wriggled a finger in his ear, then flicked a piece of wax off into the distance. \"Well here's something YOU don't seem to comprehend? All that yap-yapping you're doing…? Yeah, that's kinda stupid. Because, yeah, you may have taken out all of the front guards, but uh…\" He snapped his fingers and a horde more of guards surrounded the interior of the room lickety-split. \"There's plenty more where they came from and the thing is; they're a lot tougher than those guys. Or… so I've been told…\" These hulking masses of testosterone seethed with bloodlust and brandished a multitude of weapons consisting of flails and swords. Their outfits were not like the other imperial guards' - purely skinned animal hides wrapped about their waists and their war paint consisted of black and indigo stripe patterns. These men towered over the rest of the attendants in the room like giants. Kronk sure knew how to pick 'em. Bucky scampered back to Kronk's shoulder and chirped in salute. \"Right on time, guys! Great job, Bucky,\" Kronk cheerfully replied, returning the squirrel's high-five with his index finger. He then turned to Kuzco \"Good timing on that snap…\" \"Of course, I'm the Emperor, hello?\" He gloated. \"I always make good cues.\" \"Ohhhh wait! I get it, you were just trying to buy them some time, weren't ya?\" Kuzco looked at him. \"No Kronk, I just like mouthing off to a group of psychotic sorcerers…\" \"Oh okay then…\" He replied, not getting the gist of sarcasm. Kronk's militia let out hollers and pounced. \"For the empire!\" One by one, the titans converged on the jaguar warriors, throwing themselves into battle. The five and their cat braced for the retaliation, the leader lifting his scarred head back toward the emperor. \"I take it that your answer's a … 'no' ?\" Montezuma swung his arms out and on command, a swirling vortex of shadow swept out from underneath them. \"Consider your empire now doomed to the same fate you will face…!\" The twirling shadow bloomed out a menagerie of ghastly spirits which split off toward the various opponents. Kuzco worriedly watched as the militia dodged and evaded with expertise, but the well-trained soldiers could not attack creatures that had no physical form. The dark spirits lunged toward them, and as they struck, it was almost as if the will had been taken from the men. They doubled over in despair and suddenly became shrouded in shadow themselves. One reached out toward his comrades as he was overtaken by darkness. \"It.. It's so cold! Help me!\" He shrieked. Kuzco was petrified with terror. It was one thing to know these people had supernatural powers at their will… but to actually see it in action caused him to instantly regret not just giving up. As the shadows took on the guards in the dark twister, he was sure he could hear coarse maniacal laughing. His head began to spin in panic. What was he supposed to do? The Militia was their last defense. He could vaguely hear a voice calling his name. \"Kuzco!\" Kronk shook him viciously. \"You and the kids have to get out of here!\" What? The kids? \"Whoa…\" a tiny voice swooned. It was Tipo from behind the throne. \"This is so awesome…\" Kuzco startled. \"Yeah, okay…\" He swiveled himself around the cathedra and snatched the three youngsters up. He had to get himself together. \"Make sure you guys don't get killed… and save some for me. I'm sure a few decades in prison will reason those guys up.\" If they could even be captured... \"Haha, don't worry!\" Kronk laughed as he disappeared over the incline, jumping into the foray below. But Kuzco did worry. He worried about the guards he was leaving behind. He worried about Kronk and all the servants still captive in the corners of the room. He worried about what was left outside. But most of all, he worried about how he was supposed to get away. He didn't want to run - that wasn't his style! He wanted to be there with his men no matter the outcome, but he couldn't put the kids in danger. He grasped the rope that was secured to the side of the stairs with his free hand, slid down and quickly landed into a sprint. Montezuma spied them escaping through the back. Amidst the commotion and turmoil of warriors getting tossed to and fro, he gracefully walked toward their exit - savoring the idea of draining all life from his enemy… \"Hey, what's up!\" Kronk pushed himself in front of the slightly shorter male, brandishing his spear at his side. Montezuma looked at the big guy puzzled for a second, and then perturbed. \"Fool! Move aside!\" \"Uh, no can do there. You want to get to them… you have to make it past me…\" Kronk flashed that confident smile again. Montezuma just let out an exasperated sigh and shot a wisp of shadow toward the lovable lug. Which, he dodged happily. \"Oop, too slow there!\" Montezuma twitched, and shot at him again; a larger shadow this time. Kronk doubled back into a flip, landing on all fours. \"Nope, didn't get me there either…\" Montezuma growled in aggravation and unleashed a sphere of shadows at him… then several… then a fury of furies… and with each attack, Kronk comically evaded - bumbling but swiftly. \"Sorry there guy, but ah… my men and I have been trained by the animals of the forest…\" he struck a pose, twirling the spear to his front. \"to be as cunning as a wolf, agile as a condor… and uh…\" Bucky pranced to his side, whispering something into his ear, \"oh right… smart as a squirrel…\" \"Well, that certainly explains a lot.\" Montezuma countered, throwing yet another shadowy blast from his hands. Kronk and Bucky ducked, only to allow the blast a complete bulls-eye on the unsuspecting soldier behind them that was busy fighting a two-headed shadowy serpent. The man howled in anguish as he was floored. \"Oh no… Jereld… are you okay?\" Kronk rushed to his side. The other just gurgled as his skin was painted a dark grey. \"Jereld… think about your wife and kids! STAY WITH ME MAN…. JERELD!\" Jereld passed out. \"Noooooo!\" Montezuma cried out to his feline companion. \"Huaca! After the Emperor!\" The jaguar obeyed his command, sprinting off after the escapees. \"The rest of you…\" He motioned to the other four cloaked ones who had been playfully biding their time zapping through the horde. \"Let us take care of these hindrances first…\" The rest of the militia, along with the attendants in the corner, readied themselves for what they were sure was the last day of their lives. Kronk jerked his head toward them. \"Well, drat.\" Kuzco slid along the opulent corridors amassed with red and gold banners, throwing back curtains and pushing down anything he could get hold off...to maybe stave off their pursuer. Clatters echoed through the halls as statues that had been there for centuries fell. It pained him to see such beauty wasted, but there was no time to think on saving inanimate objects when there was lives to be saved. The place seemed so empty. Where was everyone? He hoped they had just taken the cue to evacuate themselves, but he couldn't help wondering if something else had happened. He fumbled with the kids. Chacka managed to climb onto his back with Yupi clutching the satchel, but Tipo was getting bounced up and down from underneath his arm. \"uuhh.. … I think I'm going to be sick…\" He managed. \"Hey hey hey, don't be losing it right now buddy!\" A raging growl emanated from behind them and Kuzco turned his head sharply to see Huaca bounding over the obstacles after them. Kuzco let out an alarmed scream and kicked his legs up faster than he thought he could muster. His heart was racing. His chest ached and droplets of sweat raced down his brow. One driblet went into his eye, causing him to squint, and for that brief moment he smacked right into the wall. He spun around, dazed and panicked, still hearing the jaguar behind them. He fought to gain control of where he was going through the spinning scenery, but his legs just slipped from under him against the polished floor, and he tumbled, chin first, down the following sets of stairs, losing his crown on the way. Chacka and Yupi bobbed on his back with every step and Tipo was rescued from being squashed by Kuzco's upraised arms The jaguar watched in amusement. One by one, the collection of steps hit him until he came to a rest at the bottom. He rubbed his chin as he feebly picked himself up. Okay, so maybe Rudy had some reason to complain after all. His crown clanged against the floor after them. Again the jaguar's growling issued and Kuzco barely had time to react as the big cat pounced behind them. He fell back and cried out in terror, as well as the kids cowering behind his back. They were going to die. There was no way he could run now. They were going to die! The kids bawled out, snapping him back to sanity. No, he had to get them out of this. His mind sped as the feline approached little by little, drooling. Backpedaling slowly on his elbows with the children behind, Kuzco whipped a look around at the surroundings, spying an open doorway a ways behind them. His arm hit the side of his dismounted crown and his eyes widened in an idea. \"Look… You all make a run for that doorway and I'll follow…\" \"What!\" Chacka whispered loudly. \"What if the jaguar gets you…?\" \"Don't worry about it.. That's… not gonna happen…\" though he wasn't sure he sounded convincing. \"No…\" \"Hey, I'm the emperor! You have to do what I say remember? Now, go on!\" He shoved back at them with his arm as hard as he could, propelling them onward into a run. Huaca made a mad dash toward them and Kuzco had to make his move. He grabbed his crown and swung it right as the cat leapt. The ornament beamed Huaca right in the mug and he yelped in pain and surprise. The feline preened its nose with its paw, momentarily pausing to gather himself from the affliction. Kuzco hurriedly dashed off toward the direction he sent the kids and spied them in the opening. \"Hurry!\" \"Hurry!\" He slipped inside the room just as Huaca was coming to. He yanked at the double doors. One closed, but of course the other, to his right, had to jam, caught by interference of the runner rug. Kuzco shoved at it, then kicked at it. \"Oh, give me a break!\" He threw his back into a push as the youngsters pulled the runner taut, causing him to fall flat on his back and the door to swing right on Huaca. The big cat slammed into the door, pitting his weight against it. Kuzco struggled to keep the door shut, heeling the rug in front of him, as the cat urged his giant paw through the opening. The young emperor put his body against the door, desperately trying to fight the cat from getting in - its paw swiping at him dangerously. With one last effort, Kuzco lunged, elbowing the doorway closed as a pain slashed against his right arm. \"Yow!\" He clutched his arm and slumped against the door in pain, breathing through clenched teeth. That smarted. He couldn't actually recall a time he'd been cut. For a moment, upon realizing that he was bleeding, he thought he was going to faint. He felt and heard the scratching of the cat's claws at his back, but the kids were on it. Nimbly, Tipo climbed into Chacka's arms as she lifted him above her head, as if a couple of acrobats, and he pushed the bolt across the door handles, locking it. Indignant cries and hisses from the other side allowed them a relieved sigh. The youngsters looked at the older. Chacka gasped. \"You're bleeding!\" Tipo looked away quickly, \"Oh…\" and just lost his lunch right there, \"…that did it.\" \"Ewwww!\" the rest exclaimed. Kuzco's face twisted. \"Ugh, you couldn't have waited until we got you home?\" \"Sorry… I… I'm not feeling good.\" Between his nerves, getting bounced around and apparently being a little squeamish, it was only a matter of time. \"Ah, don't worry about it. And this is just a scratch anyway…\" Truthfully, it WAS quite a BIG 'scratch'. He lifted himself up against the pain and lumbered further into the room. It was one of the extra living quarters, for guests or palace aides, decorated in the usual red. It was a lot smaller than his room of course, but it had all the necessities; a nice well-made bed, a vanity and a wardrobe. Everything was perfectly placed, making it seem as if no one had lived in this particular room in a while and probably hadn't. There was so many rooms in the palace that he didn't even know where half of them were or well, had cared to know. Curtains draped over the window blew against the chilly wind. He ripped at one quickly, tearing it just enough so that he could wrap it around his wound. He tied it tight, flinching, then turned back to the kids. \"Good thing your mom's a good teacher, otherwise I'd probably have bleed to death.\" He joked. This seemed to lighten their mood a little. \"Now…\" He mused, \"We… have to get out of here…\" He poked his head out of the hole in the wall. He widened his eyes in astonishment. They were still off the ground a ways but that wasn't what really caught his attention. The window peered out toward the back of the palace where several aqueducts ran down the crags of the mountain toward the interlaced town and hills below. The carved structures, monolithic engraved walls and streets were overlaid with a spectral mist, black as soot, and hardly visible. From the height he could not make out much else, but was sure that the inhabitants below were not in good condition. His body quaked. He could not keep his hands from trembling as he clutched the windowsill. He pulled his head back inside the room, lost in his thoughts. The kingdom was in darkness. The Kingdom of the Sun was enveloped in darkness! The situation really dawned on him. These people… he didn't know who they were…but they obviously had no problem attacking anyone that got in their way, maybe even killing them. They had strange-shadow-magic-whatever-powers and from what he could tell, wanted to take over the kingdom because of some grudge they harbored …? He let his mouth get away from him too, and now everyone was in danger. He thought back to what Montezuma had uttered. 'Consider your empire now doomed to the same fate you will face… ' He gritted his teeth and let himself fall to the floor, still gripping the edge of the window. He should've just given up! What difference did running away even make? It was like 'Monty' had said, the kingdom was already taken over. He tapped his forehead against the wall repeatedly. \"Stupid, stupid, stupid… we're all gonna die and it's all my fault…\" \"What, we're gonna die!?\" Tipo cried out. Yupi started whining and Chacka just looked back and forth, not really knowing what to do or say to comfort anyone. \"… I can't do anything… we're doomed. We either get eaten by a jaguar or swallowed by darkness…\" Chacka panted. \"But… but I DON'T WANT TO DIE. I want to see Mom and Dad again!\" Kuzco stopped. Chacka couldn't contain her tears anymore and started to whimper. \"We all do!\" The boys looked astonished at their strong big sister crying and the three of them huddled together in distress. Kuzco blinked. Right. He wanted to see them too. He wanted them to see them. \"Okay, fine, have it your way…\" He shrugged. The kids ceased and looked up confused. He snatched them up and headed toward the window. \"I don't really like this idea, I hope you all know… but I figure I have a better chance of surviving a fall than I do surviving a jaguar mauling...\" He took a minute to think on that but straddled the window sill. \"Now, you three get on my back, hold tight as you can, don't look down and definitely don't tell me about how high off the ground we are either.\" The three did, through sniffles and whines. \"Look you all are gonna have to stop doing that in my ear - it's making me nervous.\" He slowly situated his body and lowered his foot to the embossed panel below, keeping a grasp on the window. It felt way too far away. The wind blew against them and he clutched the side of the exterior wall frantically. \"Oh man, I KNEW this was a bad idea…\" He crept gradually along the side of the building, his head poking just over the window panel now. Looking within the room for a second, he could barely see movement from underneath the door. Then a loud banging… and the door literally started shaking against the barred lock. He caught his breath and tried creeping faster. Horrified, his foot slipped and off went his sandal down… down… down into the darkness below. He paused and swallowed his fear. He reached for the nearest scored decoration, but his arm hurt against his wound. He winced and the wind smashed against them again. It was picking up. He stared at the panel just out of his reach, taunting him. He stretched, fighting against the pain, not really wanting to let go of the window either as it was the only anchor he had to keep him from falling. The kids clutched his shoulders but he felt as if one was slipping. Tipo squealed. \"I think I'm falling!\" \"Tipo, don't you dare!\" \"I am… I am falling… HELP!\" He fell. \"TIPO!\" the other two screamed. Kuzco seized him at the waist, swinging back roughly against the window. \"Gah, geez, what is UP WITH YOU TODAY?\" The kid looked through covered eyes, spying the distance below between his fingers and instantly started flailing. \"Hey… STOP, you have to stop doing that!\" Kuzco exclaimed. \"Look, I got a bad arm, remember… ouch!\" Slamming from inside the room attracted him. The door flung open, the barred lock and door handles blasting off their hinges. Kuzco could go nowhere in this situation and watched in terror as a figure made their way in. \"Oh whoa! Kuzco! What are you doing there, chief!\" Kronk quickly ran to the window and pulled the three back inside. Bucky chattered, still on his shoulder. Kronk patted the emperor on his back as the kids dropped to the floor. \"You almost gave me a heart attack, hanging out of the window like that! Haha, crazy.\" Kuzco laughed nervously. \"Haha, oh man.. Yeah that WAS crazy. But at least you ran that jaguar off that was chasing us…\" Kronk looked confused. \"Jaguar? Uh…?\" He scratched his head in thought as Huaca appeared from behind the collapsed doors, creeping up on the group. Kuzco and the kids stared at the approaching cat, as Kronk recalled, blissfully unaware. \"Hm… yeah there WAS a jaguar, wasn't there?\" Kuzco briskly spun the bloke around so that he was facing the feline. \"Ohhhh…. Right. It was THIS jaguar. Yup.\" He stood there for a minute, just smiling. Then he blinked. Then the rest blinked. Then the cat growled. \"AHHHH A JAGUAR!\" Kronk flipped the bed toward the cat and pushed with all his might, knocking over everything in his wake and ramming Huaca back through the doorway. The cat was flipped hilariously down the hall and the group made a dash. Kronk grabbed everyone up in his arms. \"Hey, I got a question. Where are we running?\" \"Toward the aqueducts!\" Kuzco urged. Kronk bounded over the staircases leading out of the back of the palace. The place was dark and quiet, not a soul stirred or a sound was heard, except for Kronk's heavy breathing. He spied a bridge overlooking one of the channels and a small fishing boat. He tossed the rest of the peeps into it and untied it from it's post, drifting it into the current. He grabbed up the oar and began to stroke, but Kuzco's hand stopped him. \"Wait… let me off this thing.\" He announced. \"Uh, what now?\" \"Look, Kronk.. You need to get the kids back to their parents. I… need to stay here with the palace. Going down with the ship and all that, right?\" Kronk just looked at him. \"I mean, I can't just run away, right? I'm too much of a fighter for that… heh heh.\" He was really trying to convince himself more than anything. \"I… I just can't leave while the rest of 'em are still trapped by those nutcases. I have to know what's going on! I have to know what happened to everyone. I… I'm the emperor, Kronk!\" Kronk looked intently at him, then slightly bemused. \"You're right there, Kuzco, you're the emperor. And as your subordinate, uh wait.. No… as your friend…\" At this, Kuzco gaped. \"I really hate to do this to you again…\" \"Huh?\" Kronk bonked him upside the head with the oar, knocking him out. The kids and Bucky huddled around his collapsed body. \"Why'd you have to do that?\" Chacka asked. \"He was already hurt, you know…\" Kronk frowned with a look of seriousness to him that was very uncharacteristic. \"Yeah…\" He glanced at Kuzco's arm and opened his mouth to say something but was interrupted by a felid snarl. The youngsters squealed as Huaca landed on the embankment and paced, hissing and debating on how to reach them. Kronk watched as the cat strode. \"Huh… looks like the kitty's afraid of a little water. I think we'll be okay, kids.\" He pushed off with the oar down the flume. Huaca eyed his prey, judging the distance. Kronk turned toward the stream and veered the boat into the opening that led outside. Huaca roared and made a rush off the ledge, diving toward the boat, claws at the ready. The children screamed. Kronk spun around wielding the oar in his arms like a mace just in time to crack it against the creature's skull. The cat's limp body splashed into the channel and the boat bumped up and down with the dangerous ebbing of the water. Kronk stared at the floating corpse gravely. \"Whoa….\" Tipo gasped. \"You… you killed it.\" Kronk sniveled. \"I generally hate hurting animals… but… it had to be done…\" He bite his index finger in distress as he looked away. \"Well, yeah. I mean, it was going to KILL us.\" \"Shh, Tipo… an animal is only as evil as it's owner…\" He frowned. \"And….\" he breathed through flaring nostrils, \"They ARE evil…\" He thought back to all he had witnessed in the throne room. Kuzco wanted to know what happened to the rest, but he wasn't sure he wanted to tell him. Visions of shadows and demons overtaking the attendants and his fellow guards… He didn't want the same fate to fall them. But, as the water picked up toward the exit, it seemed as something else would fall upon them… or rather… they were falling. They let out cries as the dinghy bounced against the bumpy channel that fed into the mountain side. The dark scenery soon enveloped them as they receded toward the jungle. Montezuma and the rest of the cloaked entourage sauntered to the edge of the aqueducts and lifted their pet out of the water. The smallest of the group put a hand to Montezuma's shoulder. \"I'm sorry…\" came her voice. \"It's hard to believe they actually got away from Huaca…. And that they could do this to him…\" Montezuma gritted his teeth. \"Huaca is irreplaceable to me. But… we must think of this as even more of a reason to exact our revenge. Besides… he did manage to help us out in the end…\" He lifted the jaguar's still blood stained paw. \"We have all we need right here.\" Wow, that was… pretty climactic… I wonder if we survived that fall. Heh heh, yeah…! And oh, Creep-o's comments aren't exactly comforting…. soooo… we're gonna take a break here, ya know, so I can - I mean YOU can - get your bearings. Take a nap, go for a walk, watch my movie… somn-somn MORE enjoyable than THESE people trying to kill me - pfft-yeah! Drama's for the llama's, y'all![Chapter 2] The Emperor's New Groove: Montezuma's Revenge Act Two: Raining on the Parade The jaguar's claw, stained with remnants of red, balanced between two delicate ochre fingers. Svelte digits from the other hand danced, hanging over the object as ominous chanting from a female breathed from the background. Drips trickled off the keratin coating, forming a strange wispy ribbon that hovered in the air twixt the dainty dactyls. The manus master shot the sliver into a patient pool of black - ripples spread across the small mirror surface of obsidian, slowly forming a colored canvas of another scene elsewhere. The preceding peaks of avocado and sweet olive peered through the densely packed trees along a certain trail, littered with small stone shacks situated haphazardly in their calm idyllic spaces - a far ways from the chaotic happenings at the capital. Groups of variegated llama grazed on the vegetated hillside, gorging themselves on the abundance of life here - a respite from the gloom, as a lumbering wobbly form made its way upward. The pack animals looked on inquisitively, their ears perked, at the blubbering silhouette. Exaggerated tears and sniffles and snorts issued from the sodden miserable mug of a beefy bloke, who wailed out incessantly, intermittently bellowing into a handkerchief. His war paint washed away and scuffs against his countenance told the story of a long arduous trek. The trio of children traveling along kept their own faces lowered in uncomfortable sympathy, only chancing some gawks toward him, then to the squidgy mismatched shuffling feet below - one missing a sandal. The soaked soles finally stopped, shaking underneath their weight. \"Okay Kronk, you've been going on for some time now… uhn… why are you crying?\" A drenched Kuzco questioned irritably from below the bawling buffoon, quaking as he carried the other's limp form over his left shoulder. The grief-stricken guard was beside himself as he clutched onto Kuzco. \"Waaah! I… I… I'm so s-s-sorry! Waaaah! I'm a big, dumb, huge failuuuuure! Waaaah!\" Kuzco cringed as Kronk blared into his ear, then rolled his eyes and scoffed, dropping the big dope onto the path before them. \"YOU'RE a failure?\" He lifted a twitching brow and put his hands to his hips while his bare foot tapped in annoyance. But Kronk, misunderstanding the implication, kept whimpering. His eyes drowned and lip quivered in the ensuing waterworks as he hysterically threw himself into the young leader's chest - who was for a moment startled then slightly vexed, allowing a look of derision at the big guy. He could only look around at the kids in shared cynicism, lowering his eyelids into a stare onward as Kronk whined. \"I knooooow! I-I couldn't do anything against those g-guys and you got hurt and-and-and I lost Bucky! Ahhhh I'm a failuuuure!\" Kuzco let out an exasperated sigh and patted his back half-heartedly. \"There there, pal… you're not a failure…\" \"Yeah!\" Tipo interjected, now swinging around the pudgy form of Yupi much to the younger's displeasure. \"You saved us from that craaazy jaguar!\" Chacka whistled in. \"Aaaand Bucky's a pretty smart squirrel… betcha he's okay!\" She looked to the emperor for support. \"Right, Kuzco?\" Kuzco gritted his teeth and looked around not very convincingly. \"Uh… yeaah… sure…. the squirrel's fine… probably maybe…\" Kronk jumped up, suddenly settled by their 'words of encouragement'. \"You're right, guys! I should have more faith in Bucky! Haha! Silly me…. I don't need …to be worried about him…\" His voice trailed off and he bit his finger in nervousness, looking away abruptly. Kuzco rolled his eyes as he looked toward their intended destination. Tipo fought to gain control of the wriggling Yupi who ushered out cries of contempt as Kuzco expertly grabbed, left-handed, the rebellious youngster by the back of his loincloth. \"Yeah, whatever, let's just keep going okay?\" Without batting an eye, he tucked Yupi under his arm and the boy giggled as he surveyed the surroundings sideways in the niche. They all continued up the trail through the misty hills toward another particular patchwork of humble huts, the backs of two very familiar ones gracing the clear skyline adjacent each other. Kuzco breathed a sigh of relief. \"Me home! Me home!\" Yupi cried out, reaching arms out toward their family dwelling. Chacka and Tipo darted ahead, eager to meet its inhabitants. Kuzco chanced a glance toward his own 'home-away-from-home' next door, slightly lower than its lofty neighbor, sufficient enough for one with several worn pots and gourds hanging on the exterior, and a pair of posts with a clothesline situated at its side. On any other day, he would want nothing more than to relax there, away from the hubbub of the city but not too far away from company. He passed though the doorway of Pacha and Chicha's abode, etched with marks of measurements and children scrawls, then into the undisturbed interior. He gazed around absently, cradling the swaying Yupi still in the crook of his arm as the two older children dashed through rooms calling for their parents. The place was quaint and a little cluttered, but somehow… though it lacked fortified walls and barricades of guards, he always felt safe here. Kronk wondered into the kitchen on default and inspected the random assortment of wares as if debating on something. After some scurrying, Tipo and Chacka returned with depressed looks. Tipo threw his arms up. \"Unh! They're not heeeere!\" A look of concern crossed Kuzco briefly but then he fixated thoughtfully at the waiting knitting of trees below the village. The cool clear pool beyond the grove of budding shrubs echoed with babbles from the fleeting flumes and feeding falls of spring streams. Gentle splashes and ripples intermingled with wittering honeyed words and swoons from a couple occupying the retreat - solitary yet not, amongst the greenery. The bigger man swung his slender wife around in a playful dance as the two flirted in the shallows. \"Oh Pacha…!\" Chicha cooed - her smaller body garbed in short bathing robes quivered as she giggled. Her husband smiled tenderly and made a movement to twirl her around, dipping her back, and leaned in for a kiss but before their lips met… \"Nice to see the two of you are enjoying yourselves…\" a stoic voice uttered just in earshot. Pacha's eyes snapped open toward the deadpan gaze of Kuzco. \"Gaah!\" He startled, accidentally dropping the unaware Chicha, squealing, into the water. \"Oh, shoot, honey-!\" Kronk came lumbering from the thicket behind Kuzco, toting the children on his back - who jumped down and rushed toward the adults. Chicha spluttered as she lifted herself out of the water, grabbing onto her husband and adjusting her headband. Upon seeing her children, she collected her bearings, slightly embarrassed, as the two other males present gave her a curious look-over. \"Kids…! Kuzco! Hi… there…\" \"Hey, uh, don't forget about me, ha ha!\" Kronk interjected, waving a howdy-do. Chacka's face contorted in thought, distracted along with her brothers at the thought of their parents' lovey-dovey notions. \"Ew, you all were being grossss-sah…\" Chicha corrected her, \"It's not being gross - it's being married.\" Pacha rubbed his temple, grimacing at the uninvited audience. \"Uhh…! W-wait-what are you all doing out here?\" Kuzco, standing aloof with his arms crossed and brows raised, responded restively \"Oh, ya know… just enjoying the fresh air… you?\" Pacha, confused by this, rubbed his neck in response \"Well… yes…\" \"Oh, well, that's great!\" Kuzco sneered. \"You all are just having the time of your lives while some of us are suffering with possible permanent emotional damage… terrific.\" \"Woah woah, alright… what's with this attitude?\" Pacha trudged over to the conflicted Kuzco. Striking an authoritative stance, he jabbed at the indignant prince. \"Things at the palace not going your way again?\" Kuzco turned crossly, but Pacha poked his right arm erupting a shrill yelp from the other. Pacha became alarmed as his small friend fell whimpering to the ground. \"Kuzco!\" \"Ah…n-no…t-touchy-y…unh…\" Kuzco managed through pathetic sobs of pain. Pacha hovered over him, now noticing the makeshift tourniquet and that his imperial robes looked worse for ware. Chicha ran over concerned and immediately began inspecting his wound. \"W-what happened!?\" She turned to the others. Kronk stammered with his words, thoughts coming back, \"Uh… w-we were… attacked…\" \"WHAT!?\" the couple cried out in unison. Chicha threw her hands to her mouth and instinctively grabbed for her children. Pacha instantly felt his heart drop to his stomach as he looked over his despondent friend. But, he was not the only one watching. Dark eyes peered over the vision scryed across the smoking mirror - a disc of obsidian encased in gold. Clawed hands fiddled the mystic instrument's rim and around the neck chain that dangled from the ornament as it sat in the limber man's deer-skin lap. Montezuma chuckled aloud as he surveyed the scene before his magic mirror, situating himself in the golden throne of the palace now shrouded in a dim light that draped a dull red hue across the interior. His shed jaguar pelt covered the arms of the coveted seat and his feathered shield leaned against it as he reclined happily - his band-painted body of amber and umber peppered in the same scars as his face. \"Aw… is the poor little emperor hurting….? Bah!\" Below, an innumerable amount of people formed an audience - standing in an eerie air of gloom with their mouths and eyes gaping as they blankly stared onward, entranced. Their skin was painted grey and quiet moans could be heard from some, while tears crossed the lifeless mugs of others. It was clear they were still somewhat aware, but had hardly any control of themselves. Montezuma continued to the masses, \"…He would do well to face the darkness like the rest of us, wouldn't he?\" He laughed again. \"Eventually you'll come to accept it - this world devoid of light… hope…\" He was silent for just a minute. \"…I did.\" Then, subconsciously, dug his claws across the stone in sullen anger. He stopped, clenching his fists and breathing heavily as he forcefully composed himself and brought out that fake smile again cracking across his tarnished face. He glared back at the scene emanating from the obsidian. \"Yes… you all need to experience it to understand it….heh heh… and what better way than to make your leader suffer… the same as I…?\" His voice droned on as he seemed to remember something. His upper lip twitched as he thought. \"…Everything taken away…. into obscurity… left with nothing… but the darkness…\" He chuckled again, then, switching gears, barked out toward the bleakness. \"Tlaloc! Totoc!\" Two shadows whipped across the barely visible floor and merged into coherent forms of the named jaguar warriors. They were still concealed by their cloaks but maintained a visible difference just in approach and posture. One was tall with noticeably pointed shoulders, jerked and quaked as if having a continuous spasm. Seething and heavy breathing could be heard underneath his garb, as the other - a thin wiry sort who sported the twisted staff - casually strutted closer to the commandeered cathedra. \"You called, sire?\" \"You wouldn't mind running an errand for me would you?\" Monty blew at his claws, rubbing them against the speckled fur that sleeved just his arms. The thin one swiveled around the warped rod, which rattled in response amongst undulating sage green limbs. \"Oh, errand?\" He responded with an eloquent flair, \"You mean like killing the emperor?\" \"KILL KILL! TOTEC SPILL BLOOD!\" the other screeched out, violently thrashing in his shadowy wardrobe. \"Yes, more blood would be useful… Oh! And if you could bring back his head on a stake…\" Montezuma nodded happily. \"Right, 'use him as an example' and all that…\" Tlaloc stated unenthusiastically. \"Quite disgusting if you ask me… but you're the boss! Where to then, sire?\" Montezuma pried over the obsidian and tapping his cheek, a thought occurred to him. He snapped his fingers and a dazed, grey-braised soldier appeared by his side. He put the smoking mirror up to the drooling zombiefied guard and pointed into it, slowly enunciating. \"Wheeeere iiiiis thiii-is?\" The guard's head cocked to one side and he moved erratically but managed through gurgles, \"K-Kuz-co-to-pi-a…\" \"Kuzcotopia…? Well, that's awfully conceited.\" Montezuma flatly remarked. \"Oh, thank you, by the way…\" He then pushed the hapless guard off the steps who warbled woefully downward, and turned back to his compatriots clapping his hands together gleefully. \"Well, there you go!\" He watched as the two shuttered out of visibility, shooting off out of the palace for their hunt. Monty began again to laugh maniacally, roaring out after them. \"Soon this kingdom will be in the paw of Tezcatlpoca, bwa ha ha ha…!\" His laugher seemed to echo even outside the palace constraints. \"He's so dramatic…\" Tlaloc muttered as the dual shadows zipped along the paths leading away. The children sat at entrance steps watching birds happily chirp amongst the weathered model of a long forgotten blueprint-turned-birdbath that stood before a frequented hut - the friendly signpost of Kuzcotopia. In one of the small rooms, the newly dressed Chicha held a sewing needle carefully in one hand and Kuzco's wounded arm firmly in the other as he winced and dramatically squirmed. He ushered all kinds of cries and wails, hiding his face behind the other arm. Chicha giving him a matter-of-fact look in some humor. \"Kuzco… I haven't even touched you yet…\" Kuzco stopped, \"… Oh.\" Then she poked him. Pacha, decked in his usual moss and khaki attire, winced himself as he heard the pitiable pleas in the next room. Kronk spluttered as he sloshed water from a basin over his face, washing away the last vestiges of paint and worry as he continued to relay their plight. \"…Yeah… and can you believe it….? The river washed us toward your village! Pretty great coincidence, I'd say!\" He leaned over the rim, squinted against the driblets and shook his head dry like some oversized dog. \"Hm… but what does that guy mean by 'those that harmed our kingdom'!?\" Pacha pondered fervently, \"I don't recall any such conquest…\" Kronk perked up. \"Ooh, Maybe Kuzco's dad fired them!\" \"Uhh, alright… but why attack now!?\" Pacha cried out. \"I don't know, stop yelling at me!\" Kronk blubbered. Kuzco grabbed a new pair of sandals and quickly changed into something more comfortable, less formal than imperial robes; a sorrel robe running down to his knees with ashen trim that sheathed his collar and arms - careful with his newly stitched, bandaged arm. He pulled over a wide-sleeved golden garment embroidered in bright orange at split sides and tied at the waist with a matching cord. Topping it off, he had to throw on the now frayed poncho Chicha had made for him some time ago, the green slightly dingy with dirt stains. He rubbed the llama insignia between his fingers and laughed in spite of himself. He'd almost rather be in that situation again than facing this mess. Being responsible sucked. Chicha returned from hanging clothes outside and noticed his forlorn appearance. \"Kuzco…\" He looked up at the sound of her voice, \"…don't worry, we'll figure something out…\" She put a consoling hand at his shoulder. \"Oh…? How do you know?\" He slighted. \"Because I'm a mom and we know everything.\" He looked toward her comforting countenance, so sure and put-together. He smiled feebly. \"Oh… heh, right…\" She was joking, but in a way she wasn't. She and Pacha always did seem to know what to do no matter how hairy the situation - figuratively and literally. The tender moment was interrupted however by a clamor in the next room. Upon entering, they looked on, puzzled at Kronk - who, desperate for some distraction or perhaps having an attention deficit episode, had snatched up a flute and began to practice a playful ditty, bounding about the abode. Pacha was barely aware of the interaction, immersed in his own thoughts - but the children had poked their heads in the window laughing and offering reassuring audience as they clapped along. The lovable lug flung his free arm back and forth in amusement as he played, tapping his feet and spinning in place while the emperor just stared at him with a gaze somewhere between utterly confused and deeply offended. Blind to the gesture, Kronk continued his repertoire and bounded right up to them, smiling through trills. Kuzco snapped an annoyed look toward the big guy and lashed out at the lummox, swiping the pipe from his mouth. He winced at the pain still in his arm, but only for a moment as he turned toward Kronk's befuddled façade, frozen with still whistling lips. \"Yeah, uh…\" Kuzco made a show of tapping the pipe to his chin. \"Just, um…tsk, WHAT are you doing!?\" He brandished the flute in his hand as if reprimanding the larger. The others looked on uncomfortably. \"I, well, I uh…\" \"Kronk, buddy…\" Kuzco chewed on his words as he fiddled with the flute, \"I know you have a hard time remembering things … heh, I guess you just have some ability to block it out after a few minutes or something right? I get it, ya know… it's hard to think about things… or maybe just hard to think at all, ha ha… yeah… So I guess I need to reiterate on the situation…\" He paused then roughly spat out, \"This… isn't a vacation, pal!\" Kronk twiddled his fingers and looked up sorrowfully. \"I… was just trying to lighten the mood… a little…\" Kuzco's face softened as he studied his chum's chiseled phizog - the hyped henchman now a mournful and defeated personage who had most definitely seen more than he. Kuzco let out a small sigh and looked briskly toward the alerted Pacha, Chicha, then the kids who huddled together, ducked down with their noses right at the windowsill nervously watching. \"Uh, yeah… well…\" He muttered quickly, \"you're off pitch….\" He threw the pipe aside and paced over to the open doorway, leaning against the frame. The others awkwardly shuffled with Chicha breaking the silence. \"So… um… who wants some snacks?\" Kronk and the children perked up at this, \"Ooh, me me me!\" and they jovially jumbled into the kitchen area, followed by the clatter of crockery. But Kuzco, unflappable, stayed glued to his spot. Pacha folded his arms in thought, joining him. \"Ya know, Chicha makes some good brownies… when she tries!\" He laughed at his own joke. Kuzco offered a weak smile in response but curtly retorted, \"I'm not hungry.\" Pacha attempted to assuage him. \"…Kuzco… I know you're scared…\" \"Scared?! Pfft… Don't be ridiculous, Pacha! I don't get scared!\" He threw an arm up behind him. \"I mean, who'd be scared …of a group of maniac magicians bent on - probably - the annihilation of the kingdom and - most certainly - my death!? Nah… that's kid's stuff.\" \"So they want to kill you? Not like you haven't been through that before…\" \"This is different. I didn't do anything this time.\" He sneered. \"I was just sitting there minding my own business… literally!\" Throwing himself back into the entry, he stared toward Pacha's hut, then down to the rest of the houses littering the side of the hills. An outline of storm clouds could be seen rolling far off in the distance. Farmers and a few inhabitants mingled as they passed each other on the dirt trails, toting their baskets of fresh picked crops and wheeling llama-drawn carts - blissfully unaware of the coming storm. The two old men, Ipi and Topo, sat outside playing a game of checkers like usual and a few children ran amuck tossing a rubber ball. \"…like… you try to be a good leader and all but then… stuff happens like… 'sorry pal, too bad'!\" He sighed heavily as Pacha watched on in empathy. \"Mm, yeah… that happens…\" \"I mean…\" Kuzco paused for a moment, \"How do you do it…? Pacha?\" \"…What?\" Kuzco shuffled uncomfortably in his spot, rubbing his wounded arm on reflex, \"Well, ya know… keep 'em safe and all that…?\" Pacha stared, a little flabbergasted. He sure had grown up in the past few years. \"Uhh… well, to be honest… you don't.\" Kuzco spun back around with a critical look. \"You really just do the best you can and, well… just hope it works out…\" Pacha shrugged. \"You can't control what happens… but… you can decide how you face it.\" He looked back into the kitchen area where forms of his family and Kronk could be seen and heard moving about. \"Because… you care about them! They're your family…!\" Kuzco glanced back out toward Pacha's village as the older spoke. \"That's what a kingdom is , right…?\" \"…Uh,\" Kuzco struggled with his thoughts, \"…yeah… I guess so…\" \"But…\" Pacha interjected, \"I don't think just giving yourself up is an option. If they're after you…\" He folded his arms and nodded his head resolutely,\"…they're after all of us!\" \"Heh, Pacha, you can't say that… aren't you worried about your family?\" Pacha's face slacked as a hint of nervousness crossed him, but he stood firm. \"Well yeah, of course… but…\" He stepped to the emperor's side and gently slapped his cap over the younger's head, \"…you're part of it…\" Kuzco stood there, with his face halfway covered, breathless a moment until he sluggishly lifted the brim of the cap to meet Pacha's reassuring smirk. \"…We are part of the kingdom, right?\" Instantly, Kuzco's muzzle melted and he blinked rapidly, fighting back the tearful theatrics. \"Aw man, what… where'd you get this life advice shtick, huh? Why you always say things like that…?\" \"Because I'm a dad and…\" the older shrugged, \"Well, that's just part of our job…\" \"Yeah whatever….,\" He weakly shoved at the older in pseudo-resentment, but quickly sported a much more characteristic smirk himself. \"But… thanks…\" He nudged the big guy. \"Dunno what I would do without ya, pal…\" \"You would be a llama.\" \"Okay you gotta stop bringing that up…\" Kuzco laughed as the two made their way back inside. Long branching brows curled atop an aged temple as the reed-like Ipi examined his checkerboard, debating his next move. A quivering arm placed a finger over one of the black pieces, but quickly pulled away - having second thoughts. The squat, baggy Topo eyeballed him lazily, drooping in and out of slumber before slapping hands down on the table, snapping a remark to his friend. \"C'mon Ipi, I'm getting old over here!\" \"Hah, too late for that! Just make sure you don't keel over before I beat you…\" Ipi chuckled as Topo rolled his eyes off toward some movement. He noticed two whipping shades travel up the trail and spring to life, sprouting from the earth as dark dressed silhouettes slightly away from the hut. He shook his head in disbelief, sure his vision was finally failing him, as Ipi jumped a few pieces with a triumphant \"Ha!\" He then looked toward the same direction as his gawking chum. The imposing figures of Totec and Tlaloc made their way toward them. \"Pardon us…\" the smaller rattled his twisted staff around as he spoke, \"We were given vague directions to find Kuzcotopia… heard of it?\" Ipi thought a moment, \"Hey 'int that the place that Kuzco fella stays at sometimes?\" Topo, spying the board before him, quickly jumped all of Ipi's remaining pieces. \"Yep.\" Ipi stared on flabbergasted at his friend's move and grunted in annoyance. \"Greeeat,\" Tlaloc responded as Totec jittered impatiently behind him, \"So you know where it is…?\" \"Well - hey wait…!\" The scrawny old man questioned. \"What's a couple of 'shady' guys like you want to know that for?\" \"Oh no reason really, we just want to kill the emperor.\" \"KILL! KILL! DEAD! DEAD!\" the pointy other screeched. The two old men darted looks to one another as they pursed their lips. Finally Topo broke the silence, rubbing a bushy eyebrow, \"Ha ha… welp, then nope… never heard of it!\" \"Yeah, uh…\" Ipi made a show to tap his chin, \"We don't even know a 'Kuzco', do we…?\" \"A ha ha… Who?\" \"Exactly!\" Eyes glared through the black jaguar pelt. \"Oh, in that case…\" A green arm swiveled, stirring up a seemingly sentient shadow from the air. \"Thanks for your help…\" Tlaloc swerved the shade straight at Topo, who immediately slumped back in his chair with graying skin and murmured under a visible weight of gloom. Ipi hoarsely cried out to his friend, but then jolted from his own chair with vigor that didn't suit his age, sprinting up the hill crying out to his neighbors. \"Crazies! Crazies in the village!\" As he hollered, the plethora of pedestrians and children playing pivoted in their spots, villagers poked their heads curiously from their shacks - including the occupants of Kuzco's, food still stuffed in their cheeks. The shade masters briskly followed and Ipi was met as the same fate as his buddy, plopping down to the dirt below, prompting the outside onlookers to panic and run. Kuzco screamed. Tlaloc looked toward the sound but no movement could be seen. The group tucked their bodies against the front wall. Kuzco whimpered and slumped to the floor, hiding his face in the brim of Pacha's hat. \"Oh man! They're here! That's two of 'em…! We're gonna die!\" He covered his mouth as he quivered and quaked. \"No, we're not!\" Pacha whispered loudly. \"C'mon we'll escape through the back… let's go…\" He quickly ushered the tiptoeing others onward, glancing frantically about and grabbing a satchel hanging by the door. He stuffed a multitude of useful things in it such as cloaks and various supplies as they went. The wind began to pick up as the rain chills grew closer. The pointy shade master Totec thrashed through people's homes, leaving a wake of screeches and debris as the panicked populace tried to flee. Tlaloc, certain of his hearing, kept examining the hilltops and focused on a clothesline with vibrant cloaks sailing in the breeze. \"Totec! The emperor's clothes!\" The edgy other spun his jaguar mug toward the shack. \"That must be it!\" They shifted and sped toward the dwelling. Thunder began to reverberate above. Chicha and Chacka held the two younger boys as Pacha frantically set up a cart usually meant for a llama. \"Alright, everyone pile in!\" With looks of confusion, but too frantic to offer debate, they did as they were told - Kuzco first, then Chicha and the kids. Kuzco struggled with the close proximity everyone was tightly packed into it as Kronk looked on saddened. \"Uh…. What about me?\" Pacha stared at him critically. But before he could offer a response, the two cloaked figures appeared in a whisp of shade in the doorway. \"You're pushing!\" Pacha quickly leapt onto the cart, perched himself on the outer edge facing his family and Kronk. \"Go, go, go!\" Kronk pedaled his feet in the air a moment as he, panicked, roughly forced the cart forward and bounded down the hill at breakneck speed with the shadowy warriors at his back. The whole group squealed as they bounced - Kuzco ushering wails and uncomfortable pleas as they seemed to hit every divot along the back trail not to mention the girls screamed at the top of their lungs right in his ears. Tipo held his stomach, but Yupi didn't seem to mind this romp - throwing his arms up happily. Pacha worriedly watched from his perch as the shades closed in. Kronk held the handles tightly but intermittently would slip, bounce against the rough trail then jump back up into his sprint. Pacha swiftly grabbed a decent-sized pebble as they passed it and lurched it toward the baddies. They dispersed for a moment, pausing only to look at it critically. Pacha ducked just before a dark blast sped by. Then several. Kronk erratically made movements to dodge these black volleys but he was having a hard time controlling the cart. \"Woaa-ohh-ohh!\" Tipo and Chacka looked to each other concerned, but with an air of determination suddenly coming over them. Chacka swung around her knapsack and they smiled impishly. The youngsters climbed onto their puzzled father's shoulders and without further ado, began to toss a multitude of toys toward the brutes. The shadesters sprinting, comically looked on as objects passed them - a husk doll, plush llama, rubber ball, hand drum and dreidel. Then, a Corn Popper dinged Totec aside the head, it's colorful balls snapping around the walker's dome. Tlaloc couldn't help but laughing at his misfortune as their prey persisted ahead. The kids high-fived atop their bemused father and Kronk, glancing back at the now empty trail, cheered. \"Yeah, looks like we shook them!\" Then he noticed an oncoming ledge. He squalled in sheer terror, along with the others, as they launched over and downward toward the forested areas below. Kronk teetered on the backend as the cart plummeting vertically along the slippery slope, smashing through bushes and shrubbery. Pacha howled and cringed in pain as branching boughs whipped at his bottom. Kuzco and the others winced in sympathy. \"Ooo…!\" Then, a cart's wheel exploded off its axel spinning the beleaguered passengers and their provisions out of control until the nose locked up on an elevated stone, flipping them all out. One by one they flew into the air. Kronk smacked a tree hard, whirling around in confusion - squirrels spinning around his head. Then Pacha squashed him, prompting a sobering gasp from the buff bloke. Chicha and the children along with their bag of supplies safely landed on the puffy Pacha - who, in an effort to relieve Kronk below, rolled over with them in his protective arms - only to have the wailing Kuzco bounce off his backside into the same tree Kronk had hit. The group barely had time to register their situation though as the shades broke through the thicket above, touching down behind them. Pacha stood in front of his petrified family as they slowly moved in. Kronk, nervously at first, struck a defiant (yet still anxious) pose. Tlaloc rattled his staff around and Totec shifted in the shadow of the canopy just as the rain begin to drizzle down. An overcast blanketed the already dark setting. Tlaloc giggled. \"Ooh, this feels much better… in the safety of the shade…\" A forest arm flung back his hood as he lapped up the fresh rain. He was not anymore sightly than his leader; a wiry figure painted in olive green with black angled lines forming squares in some places and along his caved-in cheeks, big lacquered-up fish lips, piranha chompers, a huge dangling handlebar piercing protruding from either side of his basically non-existent nose, and dark circled dilated peepers plastered on his quarry. He wore a long fashionable indigo cloak around his nether regions tied together with a frayed red sash that trailed behind him like a tail down to his bandaged up legs mostly covered by furs. Totec hissed in agreement, following suit. Though he was a little top-heavy, he was mostly bones with a knotted, angled appearance along his pale body - especially his shoulders which jutted upward like mountain peaks. He had a Neanderthal brow with a receding hairline of significant charcoal-colored spikes extending from behind pointed ears graced with huge gauges that yanked the lobes past his beaded collar. His skin was speckled in some kind of resin along with dark mud outlining his features making him look the part of a hunched skeletal gorilla trying to stand, with wide spade-like black-polished nicked-nailed paws protruding from a flayed pieced-together leathery suit. The assortment of giant beads and ornamentals he wore seemed to weigh him down, particularly a string of decent-sized bones with a llama skull. At his waist, more strings of bones wrapped a slivered pale flannel cloak about him dusting the dirt below. The two of them smiled maliciously against the bleak backdrop. Tlaloc waved his staff forward as the rain around them pitted the ground with dark spots. Suddenly these flecks flourished long vines of shadow that began to dance under Tlaloc's conducting. \"Ohh, snap!\" Kuzco screamed as the gang filed, frenzied, into the recesses of the jungle trying as much as possible to huddle together. But the whips of shadow grew up seemingly everywhere, threatening to overtake them as they sprinted. Inevitably they became separated as the dark ribbons formed fingers reaching toward them… leaving the jungle behind a black memory. Kronk, toting the kids and Chicha like sacks, huffed through the dense wilderness as the whips snaked behind them. He looked back momentarily only to trip on a tree root, sending all of them rolling into a clearing where a pack of jaguar slept amongst the tree limbs. The shadowy slivers sprung over the treetops and landed into several of the big cats' heads, instantly waking them into a sort of controlled state, milling about, ready to pounce on the potential prey before them. Chicha and the children looked on in speechless horror. But Kronk merely sighed and shrugged, pulling out a scroll and quill from his robes. \"I'm going to count thiiis… as reference, like 50...\" and made a swift stroke against the paper. The jaguars jumped toward them, backing them in a cowering corner. Yupi called out toward the cats rebelliously \"Bad kitty!\" At which, one roared back in response, frightening the squirt who huddled in his mother's arms. Chicha, upon seeing this, grew infuriated. \"Alright! I've had enough!\" She stepped toward the feral felines, placing Yupi in Kronk's arms, \"Hold him for me, would you?\" Before he could offer a protest, she had ripped the bottom of her gown, tied the fabric across her already present headband and smeared a two streaks of mud across her cheeks, roaring back at the surprised jaguars that dare threaten her babies. She quickly approached, and smacked one right in the face. The surveyors screeched as the jaguars jumped for her. But she held her cool - practicing a meditative stance before knocking one right, then left, then giving another a round house kick, after which she judo-chopped one aside the head issuing a great scream of fury. Kronk and the kids starred on shocked as silhouettes of jaguars passed them - Kronk becoming slightly afraid of the woman himself. \"Wow, go mom!\" Chacka cried out as Chicha finished her brawl. Chicha flexed her wrist. \"Don't mess with a mad mom.\" But Tipo cried out and she looked down, a shadowy vines wrapping around her legs. She struggled with the wriggling shades seeping from their hosts and beyond, but it was no use - they overtook her and the rest of them in swallowing darkness. A sprinting Kuzco squealed out as he was yanked from the side - Pacha snatching him up out of the grasp of shades. The big guy bounded through with the younger in his arm, crying out for the others \"Chicha! Kids! Kronk!?\" He was beginning to become a little worried. Sure they could take care of themselves, but this was a totally different level than anything they'd ever faced. Suddenly, he found himself at one of the many cliff drops of the jungle, protected somewhat by the rain by a dying tree at the edge. Even still, the whips crept slowly toward them. Fish-eyed Tlaloc emerged from the blackness, strutting along confidently as thunder bellowed overhead. He cracked a dagger-laden smile from behind those swelled lips. Leisurely, he twirled the staff about his body in an elegant dance, singing an intentionally eerie rhyme… \" It's raining… it's pouring… The thunder above is roaring... The emperor… went up a hill And now… it's time to kill… So we can get on with this story…\" Tlaloc chuckled, \"Okay that last part I kinda cheated…\" Kuzco caught his breath. Was this really the end for him? How was that even possible? He was the main character, right? \"Look, fine… you wanna kill me? Bring it…!\" Pacha looked at him, shocked. \"Kuzco!\" \"…just let the big man over here go, alright? I'll go with you if you just leave him and the other's alone, okay!?\" Pacha stared on in deep sympathy, but Tlaloc, pinging his nose-bone with a green digit, merely took only a second to muse on it. \"Um.. No.\" Then shot a bullet of shadow right at the unprepared Pacha, who doubled over to the ground in front of his young friend. \"Pacha!\" Kuzco screamed, throwing himself over the portly farmer. He rolled his friend over, now slowly turning grey as he struggled against the onset of the shadows' influence. Kuzco gasped in fear as he desperately clung to the larger's rain-soaked poncho, driblets gracing his own sorrowful face as the storm around them picked up momentum. Pacha looked at his desperate buddy and strained a smile as he fought against the shadowy sway - his voice harsh and breathless. \"Don't… give up….\" No longer able to keep it at bay, he let out a wheezing exhale and passed out. Kuzco slumped over his fallen friend, whimpering - feeling as if it was him that got shot as well. Tlaloc chuckled madly as he circled around the pitiful forms, strutting toward the lifeless tree just beyond them. Pale painted Totec dashed out of the darkness as well, pitting their prey between the two of them. \"Sorry, but in the end…\" Tlaloc gleefully announced, \"…everyone will meet the same fate…\" He giggled a bit then whispered out as if giddy girl revealing a tightly-held secret, \"…the scourge of the Shadow Plague…\" Kuzco's eyes snapped up at this, realizing something. \"What… did you just say?\" \"That's right… the Shadow Plague…\" Tlaloc twirled his staff around, happily listening to the rattling melding with the pitting rain. \"Montezuma is very specific with his vision of revenge…!\" He playfully engulfed the dying tree he strode by in shadows as the rest of the slivers swirled around their targets. \"Your whole kingdom… falling to the darkness! Bwahaha!\" Kuzco stared at him, now with a resolute look of anger. But Tlaloc continued, jumping onto the tree. \"And you…. well you'll be the poster boy for all to see!\" He upraised his staff in maniacal theatrics as darkness began to bloom around it. The drizzle and wind swished around them. \"The end for you is at hand!\" He bellowed in laugher above the unperturbed prince. Totec smiled insanely at what was sure to come, but the emperor kept his decisive look of disdain. Tlaloc hoisted his staff straight toward the lightning-filled heavens, a plume of shadowy magic seeping from it as he cackled above his victim - ready to smite him, \"Now… DIE!\" A great clap of thunder blared above and the sky was alit as a bolt zig-zagged down, striking the assailant where he stood! A horrific screech and crack of energy was engulfed in a shocking blaze. A surprised Kuzco, temporarily blinded, glanced back to see the roasted form of the tree - crisped with flames licking the top of the dead boughs - and the singed body of Tlaloc, which promptly fell beyond the cliff's edge. The tree cracked under the fire, branches snapping off around Kuzco and Pacha below. He startled but noticed the shadows were disappearing… and Totec, the monster-looking man, eyed the fire with a look of dread… backing away. Kuzco jumped up and grabbed a bough, swinging it toward him and the darkness. \"What… afraid of a little fire?\" Totec hissed out madly. \"Go, on! Get out of here!\" Kuzco cried out. Totec reluctantly stepped back, glaring him down but draped himself once more in the shadows and disappeared back into the jungle. Chicha was released from her prison of darkness and spied Kronk and the children, rushing toward them. They all eyed the shadowy wisps disappearing around them and even the jaguars took the cue to leave - not wanting again to mess with the mad momma. Chacka thought on this turn of events. \"Did something happen?\" Not long after, they got their answer however when they met up with the torch wielding Kuzco toting a somber-looking Pacha. Chicha and the kids cried out in fear and worry as they took the patriarch into their care. Kronk worked to set up a modest camp, using the torch to start a small bonfire as the others watched over Pacha cringing under the weight of despair that infected him. Kuzco shook his head in grief as Chicha wept out to him. \"What… is this?\" Kuzco turned away, thinking on Tlaloc's words. \"It's… the Shadow Plague.\" Chicha looked up. \"You remember it right? I mean… apparently it started when I was just a baby but I heard a lot of nasty stuff about it-\" He stopped when he realized that was not the route he should be going. Chicha sniffed sadly, but kept her strong composure for the kids. \"Yeah, I… remember it…\" \"But…\" Kuzco replied, \"Don't worry about it because we got an antidote…\" Chicha blinked. \"We… do?\" \"Well, more like we know someone who does…\" He turned to Kronk blowing on the brush pile. \"Right, Kronk?\" Kronk stopped and looked around. \"Who, me?\" \"Erm… no. But you know where she is don't you?\" He narrowed his eyes. Chicha and the kids looked on suspiciously, not really liking where this was leading. Kronk just blinked, confused. \"Uh… who?\" Kuzco sneered as the name escaped his lips. \"…Yzma…\"[Chapter 3] The Emperor's New Groove: Montezuma's Revenge Act Three: Memories and Shadows The gaunt gaudy golden-ager strutted through the golden halls of the palace in a flamboyant violet headdress and matching high-collared dress, pulling out a tube of lipstick and caking her shriveled lips as she went. Promptly she withdrew a small flask of perfume as well and doused herself as she approached two particular doors lined with a multitude of guards, throwing the used bottle over her shoulder at one of them. She glided through with unbridled vigor and flair as the doors were opened to her presence. \"A-hah!\" Drawing out a confident smile, she winked and blew familiar kisses to the interior guards standing alert. As she passed, they gagged and retched under a thought of disgust. But she did not notice, as her eyes were fixated on a shining throne before her… that lust for power gleaming. Alright, folks… time for a little world history. We all know this antique as Yzma, the extremely vain daughter of a mortician - which I guess explains why she looks like something out of a crypt herself - and EX -'Emperor's Advisor'. For who knows how long, she occupied that position… but lemme tell ya, she was terrible at it. Oh yeah! Like a class act of catastrophe! She gave crummy advice - trust me - and performed more like 'executive-take-your-spot-while-you're-out' than anything. And well, ya know… the whole trying to kill me and turning me into a llama thing didn't help her case… So, yeah, she gets banished from the kingdom as of late… which was great because I could honestly live the rest of my life peacefully without seeing her face… but ya know that just wouldn't make for a good drama, now would it? Ooooh no. We just HAD to have her come back for this sitch, didn't we!? Ahem… but uh… I'm getting ahead here… going back to the flashback… Yzma rounded the throne giggling, ready to take a sit, only to be met - deplorably so - with a cherub-faced babe donning a diaper of red cloth. His ebony hair bounced underneath the imperial crown as he faced her. Aw, it's me as a baby again! I swear I just get cuter every time I see me…! Yzma gasped in annoyance, but quickly recovered. \"Well well, if it isn't young master Kuzco…\" She attempted a ginger smile, but the heir apparent let out an ear-splitting squall in response. Yzma, flustered, quickly looked around for some answer to this hellion's cry. A riposte from another much more reverent resident entered the fray, \"Oh, Kuzco…! What's the matter?\" A slender young woman decorated in delicate gold and white silks, fine make-up, polished jewelry and a tiara pinning her hair slightly up, sashayed toward them. \"Did someone have an accident?\" Her face was kind with expressive eyes and nose similar to the babe's below a squared mane parted in a widow's peak. She picked up the crying child and turned him over to peak into the diaper - to no avail. \"Hm, that's odd…\" She mused humorously, directing her attention on his whimpering façade, \"Now what could make you cry so… hm?\" She rubbed her nose against his. \"Does someone need attention?\" Yep, you all guessed it… that's me mommy! Yzma watched in aversion as the mother cooed to her giggling child. \"Who wants attention? You do… yes you do! Aww, who's my little sunbeam!\" \"Nina!\" Yzma barked. Nina jolted and looked toward the matron as she spoke through irritated hisses. \"Just why was he sitting there…?\" Nina raised an angled brow and chuckled. \"Um, because he's the emperor, silly…!\" Yzma approached closer and wagged a hook-like finger right in her face. \"Ah ah ah - not so fast! Not YET he's not…! You KNOW Manku left ME in charge while he's away… so let's not be getting hasty, shall we?\" \"Um, what difference does it make?\" Nina chuckled, still staring at her babe. \"Kuzco will be the emperor… so I thought it would be in his best interest to get used to sitting here… that's all…\" Yzma chortled. \"Yes, well decisions like that are why you're the emperor's wife, not his advisor.\" The comment stabbed Nina and she stopped to stare at the devilish deva taking her 'rightful' seat eagerly. She then cried out a name \"Kapic!\" and a burly yesman appeared at her side with a pitcher of tea, pouring her some. \"Ah thank you, my boy!\" She patted him on the cheek as he became stern and rigid at her side, then, taking a sip of her beverage, Yzma crossed her legs over and extended an arm to Nina. \"You know, a woman of your standing still doesn't have any authority… or well, if it were up to me… any right to even be around the throne…!\" \"Any right!? Excuuuuse me…!?\" \"You're excused.\" Yzma took another sip of tea. Nina gasped in hurt shock. \"Why you nasty old crone! When I tell Manku how you're behaving…!\" Yzma laughed defiantly. \"Hah! Like he'll believe you! Your words are nothing compared to mine, little girl!\" She turned to the yielding younger with false sympathy. \"So why don't you run along and let the big girls deal with the decisions, hm…?\" If looks could kill, I think Yzma would have died right there. It's a shame they don't, huh? Nina breathed in slowly and calmed herself, issuing a soft reply as she walked away with child in hand. \"Of course… after all, you're the advisor … but…\" she paused a moment to turn back, \"I hope you make better decisions in the future…\" Oh snap! Momma knows how to call it, huh? I must get my acute sense of awareness from her…! Um heh, yeah! So… apparently this was the kind of relationship the two most, dare I say,… influential… women in my life had. Unfortunately for, well, everyone, I got stuck mainly with the dragon instead of the princess… because… um… well…. Unh… let's just get on with this already… Thin white veils billowed softly in the window as the light of day seeped into the enormous ethereal bedroom plastered in calming colors, various silks and precious carved figures. The golden guardians peered over the room lined in floral arrangements and goods, offerings for what may come to the occupant of a shrouded canopy bed - her form barely noticeable behind the layers. The silent air felt stale and heavy despite the intended uplifting atmosphere. But the calm was broken by the hollering of an ill-tempered tike bashing through the doorway and flailing on the ground. \"No, no, no… I don't want to take a bath…!\" Servants lead by Yzma herself filed in behind him but quickly stopped when they realized where they were. Shifting around they looked uneasy as the child emperor wriggled away underneath the adjacent bed, crying out the whole time \"No, go away! I'm not doing it!\" Yzma, evidently perturbed but trying to keep her voice down accost him, \"sh, sh sh…. My Emperor Kuzco…\" \"Don't shush me!\" He sassed. Yzma cringed but desperately kept her composure as she tried to sway him. \"Now now…Bathing is… uh…. Essential to your rule….heh he,yes… So why don't you come on out of here and we'll get it over with….!\" Kuzco twisted his face in thought. \"That doesn't make any sense.\" \"Grk…! Just get over here!\" She whispered loudly. \"No! You can't tell me what to do! I'm the emperor, I tell you what to do!\" He yelled as he crawled to the other side, situating himself in a huff between the bed and the far wall. \"Why you little…!\" \"Yzma…\" a soft voice muttered from the canopy covers. Yzma and the rest of the servants stopped and stared. \"Urk… my lady!\" Yzma fidgeted, trying to contain herself. \"I'm sooo sorry. I was trying to keep from waking you…\" \"It's alright… he can stay in here for a bit…\" Kuzco looked up curiously from his spot. Yzma and the others exchanged anxious looks but did indeed take their leave - Yzma giving a sideways glare at the small boy as she closed the door behind them. Kuzco smiled impishly rushing out into the floor and laughing at their expense. \"See, hah! I always get what I want!\" He made a show to shake his butt at the door. \"Nah-nah you um, um… um…\" He tried to quickly come up with a real zinger, \"…boogers! Haha, yeah! So there!\" He then pranced back over toward the bed happily leaning on the side of it. \"Can you believe it, Mom? A bath? Puh! I don't need a dumb bath! Dirt don't hurt me… nuh-uh! I'm naturally clean.\" Silence stayed behind the curtains, only the sounds of the gentling swelling shrouds answering him. After some waiting, Kuzco slumped to the floor and fiddled with the edges of the hanging sheets dusting the floor. \"I mean, the nerve of those people, right? Telling me what to do! I don't want to do it so I don't have to! I get what I want, right?\" Still nothing but silence. \"Mom!\" \"Uh yes…\" came a somewhat startled but still very weak reply, \"Kuzco… you know you can have whatever you want.\" \"Yeah!\" He bounced up, bounding into the heart of the room, spinning toward the veils. \"Just… be sure it's what you really want…\" He cocked his head as he stood, not really understanding. \"Well of course what I want is what I want, silly.\" He watched the curtains dance as he toddled closer. \"Like um…\" He thought earnestly, voicing a mental list \"…lots of toys, uh, my own amusement park, maybe a theme song guy… oh, and everyone has to stop what they're doing and dance with me whenever I feel like it! Ha ha, yeah… that would be funny…!\" He stopped and mused happily, but only heard a soft hum from the other at this. His expression turned from eager to curious, then slightly pouty toward her. He rolled his eyes and groaned, but took a moment to glance about the room at all the gifts before them. \"And… well, you getting better!\" He added quickly. \"Yeah! That's pretty high up there.\" He nodded. \"I order you to get better!\" Her breath could be heard as she tried to laugh. \"Yes, sir…\" But he just kicked his feet. \"So… are you going to do it this time?\" She faltered but rustling inside alerted him. \"Oh Kuzco… come here…\" He shuffled right up to the bedside and an arm, graying and emaciated, reached from behind the shrouds. For a second he was afraid, but he kept his stance as she patted his head gently. \"You are the light in this dark world…\" She slowly withdrew her arm back into the safety of her canopy. Her son stood there, forever analyzing the white fabrics, trying to understand such a cryptic comment. \"You know why…?\" \"Um, because I'm the Emperor?\" A weak laugh, \"Heh yes… and because - \"A booming snort cut the sentence short as Kuzco's bloodshot eyes snapped open to be met with the gaping maw of a slumbering Kronk. The resonating snore echoed in his ears as the guy loudly inhaled and whistled out mutters in his sleep. Er… wait a minute… was I doing commentary on a flashback that turned into a memory that turned into my dream…? That's… kinda meta…. \"Go figure.\" Kuzco muttered to himself. Kuzco sat up briskly in the makeshift shelter - one of the cloths Pacha had hurriedly grabbed thrown over some pitched sticks, and stared impassively at the teddy-clutching titan. He regretted having to share anything really… but especially with someone so loud…! Raising a pillow, the thought of suffocating the older crossed his mind, but he stopped himself. \"No, Kuzco… you kinda need him around…\" He departed the tent groggily, and looked toward the small brush pile. Chicha's silhouette hovered at Pacha's bedside - a mat made of leaves and folded fabrics. Kuzco felt his throat catch a moment, but made his way over to her. The glow of the guarding flames gamboled around them as she carefully wiped her husband's sweating brow with a rag. \"Uh, hey…\" Chicha looked up, quickly rubbing her lids and nose for any tell-tale signs of woe. \"Oh Kuzco! Um, what are you doing up?\" \"Oh, well the Kronk-ster is practicing his opera routine and I, uh, just thought you could use some company…\" He shuffled over to sit on a log. \"Besides… I… couldn't really sleep…\" She was silent a moment, but turned back to her work. \"That's… understandable…\" There was a palpable air of hesitation between them - both wanting to console the other but not really sure how. Kuzco glanced at the three children bundled up in a disheveled heap beside the log he sat on. They were sleeping soundly, peacefully it seemed. \"Huh, the Shadow Plague…\" Chicha's voice startled him. \"I remember it. Twenty years ago it was some mysterious affliction that swept over the kingdom.\" She sighed heavily as she brushed Pacha's hair out of his face. \"It was strange… seemed to put those infected into a state of depression that slowly withered them away physically…\" She stared at her husband, biting her lip, then studied Kuzco's distant gaze elsewhere. \"But I heard it particularly affected those around the capital… and the ones they loved…\" Kuzco looked back toward her, giving him a concerned eye. \"Is that how you know of it? Did you… know someone?\" Kuzco gawked at her for a second and rubbed his knees nervously. When he stood up and began to anxiously pace, Chicha realized what she had just asked. \"Yeah, but, ya know, it's no big deal… cuz it's not like I really knew them. The old man was gone all the time apparently… eh… I don't really remember him. And well mom…\" He stopped for a minute to catch his breath, and irritably scratched his head. \"Aw well, anyway I didn't know her long.\" He rubbed his arm nervously but spied Chicha's despondent gaze. \"B-but hey… th-that's not gonna happen to Pacha! It was still like three years before that happened and uh… it's like I said - Yzma found the antidote… so we'll just go up to her, make her give it to him and everything will be okay!\" He snapped toward her for emphasis. Chicha shook her head, \"But this seems so much worse…\" Tears started to run, as she began to finally break down. \"How… do you know?\" It broke his heart to see her so beside herself, but he forced a grin and grabbed her by the shoulders. \"Because I'm the Emperor.\" Chicha looked up at him giving her that matter-of-fact tone. \"And… I said so.\" She stared on for a second, but laughed at this. \"Oh… right…!\" He wasn't sure she was entirely confident in that response, but it did seem to lighten her spirits at least. Kuzco pulled her in for a consoling hug and patted her back. \"Hey, you get some rest… I'll watch over the big guy now…\" She smiled softly and shuffled over to join her sleeping children as he studied his struggling pal attentively. Sitting against the damp grass, he gazed at the bonfire sparks fly toward the stars - illuminating the pitch black night above. The pitch black flickered as the mirror spun in clawed hands, angrily awaiting the arrival of an accomplice. Montezuma's bulging eyes were glued to the dim foyer amassed with the fleeting shadow-controlled followers as his claws clicked the rim of the smoking mirror irregularly. Finally, a whisp of shadow snaked along the lobby to below 'his' seat, and the crooked hunched-over Totec appeared. He fidgeted again like usual, but with more of an apprehension to him as he slowly removed his hood and lifted his Neanderthal mug to his leader. \"T-TLALOC D-DEAD DEAD! MASTER!\" He bellowed. The guy really did only have one volume level. Monty stopped spinning his disc and tapped it to his maw in thought. \"Hm… really now?\" He lifted himself up with unseen force and faced his companion. \"Do… you think I don't know that?\" \"UHHHhhh…\" Totec began to cringe back, fiddling with his hanging earlobes as he looked about nervously. \"I mean… heh heh, \" Montezuma began to quickly descend the stairs with a controlled fury mounting in every step, \"I have this magic disc that allows me to track their every move and all… heh, and you don't think I KNOW that Tlaloc , one of my most trusted shade masters is DEAD…? While you … YOU… the complete buffoon of our group just let them ESCAPE!?\" He held back his rage as he confronted the taller. \"How hard is it…\" He seethed in annoyance, \"…to KILL THEM!\" Totec whined like a dog as Monty repeatedly bashed the obsidian mirror against the larger's skull, sending him groveling. \"Isn't that what you're good for? The killing!? And you come back here with the wrong one dead!? Ugh! Why can't I just get what I want!\" He sent one last good hit over the giant's head, sending him sprawling to the ground. Montezuma heaved in fury as he looked around at the semi-aware crowd. Crossing his arms he attempted to compose himself, but still irritated, he let out a roar toward the spectators - who sheepishly stepped back. He growled in annoyance over the whimpering Totec - who desperately tried to beseech him. \"FIRE! HE USE FIRE ON ME! FIRE ON SHADOWS! FIRE BAD!\" He wailed. Monty took a moment to touch his own burnt face. \"Yes… 'fire bad'…\" then snapped his dreadlocked head back vehemently, \"But not as BAD as that reference!\" \"Oh, Master…\" A breathy female voice accost him. He whipped around to see a curvaceous figure doused in shadow approaching him. Her svelte earthen-toned legs strutted toward him - barely discernable from beneath the trailing chaotic shadowy cloaks. Plump pouches strapped to her hips held the mess together and helped to accentuate her already voluptuous figure as she gaited. \"I could hear your tirade entirely from the other end…\" She pulled back her hood with dark painted fingers to reveal colorless eyes against an elegant gold-plastered face, vertical ochre patches adorning her brow and muzzle - framed by a stringy pewter plume of hair which she shook luxuriously in the dim light. She allowed her fashionably dismal fur coat to slip down to her elbows, her skin breathing in the hazy glow around them. Outlines of mud coating separated the gold of her barely covered body from the dark hewn shoulders, sides and limbs. Montezuma looked her over. \"Hm. Yes, well, Laz… I'm so sorry if I interrupted your beauty sleep or something but I'm kinda in the middle of punishing the dog, so…\" \"So…\" she whispered to him as she caressed his shoulders sensually, \"maybe you just need to relax…\" Her caught her hands sternly and stared at her. \"The only way I'll relax is when my plan comes to fruition. Now, unless you have some news or something important to show me.. I suggest you stop wasting my time!\" He brusquely threw her back, but she kept her cool with only a mild grunt. She dusted herself off and fixed her hair, firing back \"As a matter of fact, I do have something to show you…!\" Montezuma raised a brow, not really sure if she was being serious. She giggled and playfully hugged her body. \"You wanna see…?\" He just stared at her, but after a moment he turned to Totec still cringing. \"Stay, boy. Bad dog.\" Then he walked off to follow Laz. \"…Mictlan and I never expected to find things like this in the palace…\" she explained as they strode through an opening in the shape of a creature's mouth. The jaws clamped shut behind them as they waltzed over to another strange stone figure; an odd piranha-looking demon with two distinctive bottom fangs perched on a wall above a semicircular platform. Monty studied it extensively. \"Hm. Well, it is no doubt an interesting piece of work but the craftsmanship leaves something to be desired…\" \" Not the sculpture, silly!\" She flapped her free arm nonchalantly as her other gripped a certain tooth. Pulling it down, immediately a switch activated - the platform flipping them behind the wall into a dimly-lit contraption. Laz insolently eyed the confused Monty who frantically tried to regain his posture after falling in head first. \" Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times…\" \"W-what-\" before Montezuma could utter another word, the two of them careened down the coaster track, skidding along the exquisitely designed trail and tunnels. The shadow leader screamed in surprise and fury, growing hot under his collar as Laz just laughed - enjoying the ride and his misfortune. \"Ahhhh! WHAT IS THISS!\" The track stopped at a ledge, flipped them out - Monty cart wheeling down to the hard ground below. He lifted himself up feebly, only to realize he was in some strange get-up of lab attire and… a peculiar projecting hairpiece? \"Wasn't that fuuuun…?' Laz swooned jokingly. \"And we get these kitschy clothes as souvenirs!\" She danced around in her baggy garments, then looked curiously at Monty shaking in rage. \"Hm. That look really suits you.\" He jumped up and ripped off the lab coat in tatters, throwing the wig down in rage and stomping on it until it was a mess of synthetic fibers. Laz backed away cautiously. \"Wow… you really do need to relax…\" Monty let loose a kick, sending the rug plopping on the ground next to a pair of thick red muscular legs sitting crossed on the ground. The burly outline of a sitting figure cloaked in the familiar shadowy robe, his painted façade shown as a red-plastered man with a pallid pigment skeleton design, belonged to his last cohort, Mictlan. The broad-bodied bald man completely engulfed in war-paint sat there in the middle of the floor eating some kind of meat and looking worse-for-wear. The once pristine jaguar cloaks were matted and shredded with some sort of animal attack evident. Montezuma raised a brow. \"What… happened to you ?\" \"Wrong lever.\" He stated hoarsely. \"Is… that … crocodile meat?\" \"Yep. And I got fresh leather…\" Mictlan pulled out a prepared hide from behind him. \"Oooh, I can make a handbag from that!\" Laz squealed girlishly, snatching the crocodile skin up and inspecting it. Montezuma's goggle eyes flinched at the woman from behind his band of black paint. \"Laz… \" He angrily hissed, \"WHAT exactly was the purpose of showing me this place?\" \"Hm, oh right!\" She tossed the skin aside. \"Well, I thought it would make for a great workshop of sorts - I do need a big place to perform my spells and chants,\" she motioned around the interior of the spacious room, once housing contraptions, alchemic gewgaws, tubes and bubbling beakers but now a cobweb-infested storage area full of broken crates and curios \"…but mostly to accentuate my next point; Mictlan and I have found that there's many not-so-secret passageways and rooms within the confines of this palace…. Perhaps there are more 'hidden' things of interest, no…?\" She stepped in close, \"Like… I was thinking, Manku's golden staff?\" Montezuma recoiled angrily at the sound of the name, \"Manku…\" then concentrating on the last part, \"…'s staff!?\" A flash of memory plagued him - a familiar silhouette, backed by blazing light, upraised a golden scepter topped by a clear orb under the imperial sunrise design. The blinding radiance still burned against Montezuma's skin as he rubbed his visible facial scars. \"Yes…! I would very much like that wretched instrument be found as well. It is perhaps the only thing that could defeat us now. It must not fall into anyone else's hands!\" Laz clapped her hands together exuberantly. \"Way ahead of ya, boss!\" She turned to the other cohort and screamed harshly, \"HEY MIC!\" Mictlan just casually looked up from digging in a random crate, now sporting a dusty frilly hat. \"HOP TO IT!\" \"Yes, dear.\" And the brutish bloke bounded off briskly. \"Well, there we be!\" Laz announced coolly, but Monty just raised a brow. \"Oh don't worry… if it's here, we'll find it! Buuut, now to help you with your little problem…\" She strutted over to him and slinked up as close as she could, stroking her dark fingers against his bare chest. \" Little problem?\" \"…this…\" he followed her fingers downward to the obsidian disc hanging at his neck. She gently lifted it away and viewed her work. \"My tracking spell is fading, and without any blood to use, we'll have to resort to another method of following them…\" She sat the smoking mirror down and fumbled with her hip-mounted pouches, pulling out a handful of dirt. Quickly she shoved the mess into her mouth and chomped the clump around in full jaws. Spatting the chewed-up clay back out into her hands, she smacked it together, expertly sculpting between her digits. Giving an impatient Monty a dirt-crusted toothy grin, she placed three small barely-detailed figures upon the ground around the dark mirror. \"…In knowing about Tlaloc's passing, we should be a smidge bit more careful, shan't we?\" Laz explained as she fiddled with another pouch of dirt - this kind much darker, \"so I've constructed these little babies, my Cihuacotl… ~!\" She sprinkled the dark powder over the figurines, then made a spiraling trail into the mirror. The small abyss faltered in and out, but rippled to life for a moment. Laz sprinkled the same powder into the scene below. Kuzco dusted dirt out of his hair. How'd that get there? Laz dusted her hands off and giggled. \"Alright, they're bound to their target… now the fun part begins…\" Monty watched curiously as she kneeled behind her mini-constructs, letting her hands dance over them and the sandy trails, chanting an ill-intended incantation. \" Daughters of my dark powers, Arise from the dirt given life; A form anew from the shadows And depths defined by our strife…\" The dirt lit up in phosphorus trails that fed into the mirror. The streams lifted, hovering in the spell, creating strings connected to each of the three slowly contorting figures. The Cihuacotl stretched and danced under Laz's conducting hands. \"… Before my spell fades Follow the trail into day And bring back our prey!\" The clay trio hollered out banshee calls as they shifted into different feminine forms under the pale lights - taking sharp dirt-formed physiques. Each was a distinct size, with gritty hair-like tendrils sprouting from behind cracking mud masks in the shape of fanged skulls. Their spike riddled limbs were disjointed from a gravity-defying torso like floating craggy bones of putty. The lines connecting the mirror slowly disintegrated into their temples and their hollowed out eyes suddenly came to life as glowing red orbs - alert and understanding their mission. The Cihuacotl wailed out and darted out of the room over each other. Laz bid adieu to her underlings. \"Oh meeee! They're so beautiful! I think I might faint!\" Then, gathering her composure and clearing her throat, \"Ya see… why send someone who could, ya know, potentially die to do the 'dirty work' - tee hee… pun intended - when my babies are immortal… and unlike us, don't have the whole aversion to light hampering them.\" She winked to her boss. \"Hm, very good Laz…\" Montezuma praised in passing, picking up his obsidian ornament and adjusting it again on his neck. \"I guess I can relax a little now…\" Laz smirked coyly. \"You need help with that…?\" The two of them leered at each other as a pair of small eyes above watched from a cranny. Bucky leaned in curiously, then drew back disgusted - darting away with a squeak through the zigzagging crag. Popping his head from a knothole outside, he caught a glimpse of three strange figures sprinting off into the creeping sunrise. Certain of their destination, he puffed his puny chest out in bravado and dashed off after them. As the morning light slowly seeped through the trees, Tipo sprung up from his blankets screaming at the top of his lungs \"AHHH, WE'RE GONNA DIE!\" Kuzco and Chicha startled - the latter staggering awake and wiping drool from her face. Kuzco clutched his chest, sure he about had a heart attack, \"Why would you wake up SCREAMING that!?\" \"Oh… cuz um…\" Tipo calmed himself, \"I had a dream that some shadow lady made monster skeleton people out of dirt and sent them after us…!\" The others blinked at him. \"But, it was just a dream I guess.\" Kuzco and Chicha exchanged looks but then Chacka pipped up. \"Well I had a dream that Monty guy beat up that scary weird guy…\" \"Oookay, we're heading out!\" Kuzco announced abruptly. He jumped up and bolted to the tent. \"Eh, Kronk - up, up, up and at 'em!\" Kronk stumbled out of the shelter, yawning as the others gathered their things. \"F-five more minutes, Papi…\" Kuzco frowned and snapped in his face. \"Hey, hey, hey, we don't have time! Pacha's not doin' so well, remember!?\" He pointed back with his thumb towards the family desperately yet carefully trying to lift the unconscious Pop into their repaired cart. Pacha plopped into it roughly, moaning. Kuzco, Chicha and the kids winced nervously. Kronk slapped himself awake. \"Oh oh right! Don't worry chief, I'm on it….!\" Quicker then they could bat an eye, he slipped back into the tent and quick-changed into his scout master uniform, saluting. Kuzco raised a skeptic brow. \"Where'd ya get the digs?\" \"A Junior Chipmunk always has an extra change of clothes in case of such emergencies…\" Tipo and Chacka quickly did the same themselves. \"Right!\" Kuzco looked around and between them. \"Okay-no really, where are you all getting the clothes cuz I could use a new pair myself…\" \"We really shouldn't be questioning this right now.\" A deadpanned Chicha holding Yupi responded. Kronk squinted toward the now rising sun, scratching his chin and sniffing the air. Wetting his index finger with his tongue he rose it into the breeze. He made a show of scrutinizing the sky as Chicha and the kids situated blankets around Pacha and Kuzco hurriedly shoved their tent cloak back into the satchel. \"Hm…\" Kronk thought aloud, \"Alright, we need to head into the mountains due southeast about 300 kilometers, ascending roughly 3,000 meters to the elevated lake where we'll cross frog-infested waters to a booby-trapped island on which Yzma lives in a cave there...\" Kuzco stopped and stared. \"Oh, that's it?\" Kronk spun around and cracked that same dumb smile. \"Yup.\" Kuzco slung the satchel over his shoulder. \"Sounds easy.\" Of course he was being sarcastic. He joined the others next to Pacha, twirling Tipo's hat around playfully as he walked. \"Looks like we got a hike cut out for us…\" He slapped on his own cap…no, wait… it was Pacha's hat…. He glanced down at his ailing friend but he felt Chicha's hand on his shoulder. She smiled, though still with a bit of worry present on her face. \"Ya know, that cap fits you pretty well…\" \"I dunno, it's a little large…\" \"Really now!? As big as your head is?!\" \"Very funny…\" Kronk kicked dirt over the last vestiges of flame then, checking the position of the sun one more time, he bounded over to them with his arm extended into a point. \"Thatta way, everyone! Oh boy, I can't wait to see Yzma again…\" Kuzco frowned deeply at this as the group began to venture forward. \"Yeah…\" He responded as he struggled to move Pacha's cart, \"…it'll be… unh! A real JOY to see her endearing face!\" With a shove, he finally got the wagon rolling - almost plowing over Tipo and Chacka in the process. They yelped as the young emperor fell forward, accidentally ramming into the back of unflinching Kronk's legs. \"Uh… should I push…?\" Kronk thought. Kuzco's face alit for a moment but then he hesitated. \"No, wait. I want to do it.\" \"You sure you can… ehh… handle it?\" \"Oh Kronk…\" Kuzco tisked, heaving himself wearily back up. \"Puh-lease! Can't you tell I am in peak physical condition?\" Kronk looked baffled by this question as scrawny Kuzco continued to struggle with the cart. \"Nothing's…unh!… going to stop…erg… this mag-ni-tude of - eh!…machismo!\" Kuzco took a breathless moment to pant. Tipo and Chacka looked at each other once again and nodded in unspoken agreement. Chacka produced rope from her own pack. \"Don't worry! We'll help!\" With that, she and her brother quickly knotted a makeshift harness around him and the cart shafts. \"- A tether of twine secured safely with double hitch knots!\" Kuzco tugged slightly annoyed at the restrictions. \"Oh yes, yippee! Look at me… I'm a llama!\" Then realizing what he said, he quickly recoiled at the memory. \"Look, let's just get this over with shall we…!?\" He marched forward, desperately dragging the weight of the wagon through the damp grasses. Puddles from the previous rainfall still pitted the forested earth and the cart was not exactly the sturdiest. Chicha and the kids trailed alongside, keeping it steady as they heaved forward toward the mountainous terrain. The journey was not the most pleasant as they soon found out. Sure, the landscapes they passed through were breathtaking - worn trails snaking into the twisting orchid-covered slopes backed by alpine mists; elevated valleys of frolicking vicuna, great glamorous ancestral ruins feeding moss overgrowth; and the terraced nests of condors peered over from rock face roosts at the out-of-place travelers. But for all the beauty they encountered, was the living weight they carried behind them and the knowledge that with each passing day time was getting thinner. As they climbed higher and higher into the mountains, the trek tested their limits. With each sandaled step, each lug of the rope, each windswept night, each potential predator they faced… it felt heavier. Kuzco was really starting to feel the torment of manual labor, though at his own desire. Kronk even had to force him to let him take over pulling the cart a bit for fear that they were loosing speed… and the struggling emperor looked about ready to pass out. Each of the party took turns watching over their fallen fellow Pacha - periodically sponging the poor guy's brow and repositioning his covers. The days crept by, not nearly fast enough, in this ten-day hike. Everyone prayed to the gods that they'd survive… especially their patriarch. On the fourth day, Tipo and Chacka caught a few fish in a chance river. The fifth day, Chicha made a run through everyone's injuries - quickly snapping Kuzco's back in place with chiropractic expertise, applying bandages to a scrape on Kronk's arm, plucking a thorn from a yelping Tipo's hand and giving Yupi's finger boo-boo a kiss. The sixth day, Kronk managed to tame an alpaca into pulling the cart, at which Kuzco burst into gracious tears and promptly passed out. All the while, back in the capital, Montezuma made himself home in the growing darkness. Perched in the prince's place, he entertained himself at the expense of the shadow-possessed populace. Fine food and a dinner theater grappling match were at his fingertips as young women stolidly stood around him fanning and providing fabulous fabrics. Such a lavish lifestyle had him hark back to days long gone. His lackies Mictlan and Totec scoured through the palace for hidden treasures, which they did indeed find… but not to their master's liking. The only thing he was interested in was the fabled staff…! Through the city streets and villagers' niches the two pursued the object of desire. Those who hadn't been affected by the shadows' reign yet pleaded with the invaders, but to no avail. The hulking brutes bombarded through their homes and stations - ransacking their wares and destroying whatever they felt like, leaving many families in tears and distress. Old man Rudy peered around a wall from under a cloak, gasping. A similarly cloaked gang of individuals whispered from behind him at the sight of their city slowly dismantling. Where was the emperor? What happened to him? They filtered back cautiously into the recesses of the growing night. Sorceress Laz laughed hoarsely from her lair surrounded by pale pastel smoke as she peered into a swirling pile of dirt under her puppeteer hands. As they made another ascent, Kuzco looked back toward the north-west as another sunset faded behind mountain peaks. He swore he could see dark clouds beyond, threatening to swallow the resting sun. It felt too ominous in his bones. By the eighth evening, Pacha's labored breathing and ever-flinching countenance had stymied, which Chicha was not sure was a good thing. She studied his face longingly but kept her face stern. He would tell her to keep a 'stiff upper lip'… but her lip was already as stiff as she could make it. She closed her eyes in thought for a moment then made her way back over to the sleeping form of Yupi, patting him on the head before continuing on to a pot boiling over open flames. Taking the nearby stick she had at the side, she stirred the hot water, wrapping the colored fabrics stewing within around it. She pulled each of them out, quickly throwing them over a diagonal line. Chacka bounded back to camp holding a sack of water. She hesitated for a second, seeing the worry in her mom's back - but she said nothing, maneuvering onto her father's side. \"Um, hey Dad…!\" She fumbled. \"You're thirsty I bet!\" She was half-hoping Pacha would say something back, but when he didn't she sadly shrugged and lifted the canteen up to his mouth. Slow gulps responded in kind thankfully. \"There ya go! At least you're still drinking… that's… good…\" She heard a catch of breath from behind her and when she turned she saw Chicha had her hand to her mouth. Chacka could feel tears start to well in her eyes, understanding the severity of their situation but not really wanting to accept it as fact. Their dad really was DYING! She threw herself over the cart. \"Hey dad, just a f-few more days! J-just hang on please!\" Chicha turned toward her wailing daughter. \"I-I promise I won't sneak bugs into your clothes and blame it on Tipo anymore… and I-I'll even clean the llama pins for a week! Please, just don't DIE!\" Yupi jolted awake. \"Dad… die?\" He immediately started bawling. Chicha grabbed him up quickly and hugged her daughter tightly. Chacka could now see the tears, but she was also sporting a smile. \"Oh babies… you're so strong. But we have to stay strong for him. Our love will keep him alive no matter what…\" She gingerly rubbed her husband's head. Tipo shook water from his face in the nearby mountain spring. He sat with his midriff wrapped in a bathing cloth upon a submerged stone and stared at his feet through ripples in his reflection - he thought he did kinda look like his dad. Tadpoles effortlessly nibbled at his toes and the only sound was of the trickling brook. He looked toward the deeper end at the lanky form of his surrogate brother facing away. Kuzco flipped his sopping hair off his back as he inspected his now barely visible scar on his right arm. He sighed to himself. If only the pain nagging at his back would go away as easily. He rubbed his stiff neck, wincing. Well, maybe he wasn't imagining the pain after all... He closed his eyes and let his body seep back into the soothing water - his face wreathed by locks of thick hair. Tipo watched as he let himself float there with his thoughts. The younger fiddled a bit with his own thoughts before finally speaking up. \"Uh.. Kuzco…?\" \"Hm…?\" \"Um well.. Our dad's kinda like your dad right?\" He kept his eyes shut and mused on it. \"Heh… nah, he's better.\" Tipo cocked his head as the older began to back stroke over towards him. \"Oh… um, okay then.\" \"Tipo…\" Kuzco situated himself against Tipo's sitting stone. \"I don't really know my real dad… only from stories people have told me. So, yeah, for all intents and purposes, Pacha IS my dad.\" He folded his arms and looked the kid dead in the eye. \"And… ya know, I don't count on loosing another one…\" \"B-but what if Yzma doesn't want to help him!? What if… what if we don't make it!\" Tipo cried out. \"W-what if…!?\" Kuzco's brow furrowed. \"What if the sky falls!\" He snapped. Tipo startled. \"Look, I'm not gonna allow that negativity, got it! Pacha ain't dying so stop thinking that!\" Tipo sniffed as Kuzco's face shifted in uncertainty, \"I mean c'mon… what kinda twist would that be, right!?\" He folded his arms once again and stated pointedly, \"That just doesn't make any sense.\" \"Yeah… I guess you're right…\" \"Well yeah!\" He studied Tipo's crestfallen expression. \"So… wash that gloomy face off…\" He splashed the kid lightly. Tipo chuckled in spite of himself and returned a playful splash. The two of them slapped the water back and forth, forgetting their troubles for the time being. Kuzco grabbed Tipo in a headlock and noogied the struggling tike as he giggled uncontrollably, then seeing an opportunity finished him off with a wet-willy! Tipo screeched out in a combination of disgust and tickled humor as he tried to escape this comical torment. Kronk rounded the bend hurriedly leading their alpaca toting a bundle of sticks on it's back. An alert look graced his face but upon seeing the two joshing around he laughed heartedly. \"Haha! You call that splashing?\" He threw the alpaca's harness around a small sapling, at which it began to graze around casually, and swiftly stripped into his loin cloth - vaulting himself toward the water at the other swimmers' surprise. The resulting splash sent Tipo almost into the air and Kuzco smacking roughly face-first against the sitting rock. The irritated emperor spun around, lifting a veil of soaked hair to eye the others laughing. He stealthily snatched up a stick and wielded it, ready to whap Kronk with it. Kronk backed away nervously but before Kuzco had a chance to exact his revenge, a rustling in the bushes alerted them. The trembling of leaves became more and more violent as something approached - something significant! The three lads huddled in anticipation - Kronk sporting an anxious attack pose, Kuzco with the upraised twig and Tipo clutching onto the former's leg. Closer and closer the creature came, stalking upon them. It leapt out at them from the overgrowth! …and revealed itself to be…. none other than Bucky! For a moment they screamed, but Kronk instantly broke out in glee - rushing to the beige squirrel and grabbing his tiny body into a suffocating hug. \"BUUUUCKYYY! YOU'RE AAALLIIIIVE!\" Bucky squeaked for air desperately and smacked the big guy's mitts. He released his friend apologetically with a smile. Kuzco let his weapon drop with a plop into the water, making his way back to the shore where a bundle of fabrics and his llama-wittled comb waited for him. The nearby curious alpaca sniffed and tried to gnaw at the clothes, but Kuzco yanked it back, sticking his tongue out at it's unsuccessful attempt. Kronk pet his fragile rodent friend's head with two fingers. \"Oooh, sorry there buddy! I'm so glad you're alive!\" Bucky peeped in response. \"Oh, well we're on our way to see Yzma to cure Pacha from that weird shadow plague thingy - eh, long story - What about you? You have to tell us what's been happening!\" Bucky cleared his throat and began to frantically charade - issuing squeals and motions with dramatic suggestions as Kronk and Tipo nodded along. \"Uh huh… half the capital, huh? … yeah… okay… oh, oh yeah, definitely! Hm… sounds interesting… Hey, Kuzco!\" Kronk hollered back over to the newly clothed emperor combing his hair. \"Ever heard of some mystic staff your dad might've had…?\" Kuzco spun his head around and raised a brow suspiciously. \"Dad…? Um… nooo…\" \"Ok well, Bucky says those creeps are after that too…\" \"Greeaat… I'll add that to my growing list of 'Things they're talking about that I know nothing about'…!\" He flicked the comb in his wrist. \"Wait a sec…\" Tipo mused, \"We've been traveling for eight days… how'd you find us, Bucky?\" Bucky twiddled his paws and chirped to his translator Kronk. \"Oh, 'just followed the scary skeleton ladies'!\" They all took a second to process this. \"Wait… WHAT!\" \"Skeleton ladies!?\" Kuzco cried back. As soon as he did, three strange red-eyed figures appeared screeching from the brush behind him and brandishing dark claws. He gasped and twirled towards them in shock, just fast enough to be snatched back into the thicket himself. \"Kuzco!\" Kronk screamed. He leapt out of the water, tossing the alpaca's reins to Tipo. \"Take Snowflake back to camp and warn the others - I got a job to do!\" He sprinted off with determination. \"Kronk, wait!\" Tipo called, waving around a cloak. \"You forgot your clothes!\" ","Summary":" The Emperor's New Groove: Montezuma's Revenge Act One: The Jaguar's Paw Long ago, somewhere in a ki"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"The Old Place","Author":"mrkwatny","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11815379","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Thank you for reading! More coming soon! I am looking for a beta, so if you are interested, feel free to contact me! . . . \"That is silly, it is my store. Not his.\" LaBoeuf eyed me, if only for a moment before he turned to glare at Rooster. The fat, old Marshall dropped some kindling into the fire. His good eye studied the ranger and me, mouth slightly open as if ready to comment on how I was prepared to feed him like a baby. He remained quiet, and for that I was thankful. \"Eat, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" I persisted once more, moving the spoon closer to his tightly closed lips. A moment of hesitation occurred before he moved to take the gooey corn dodger for consumption. I watched him, how he was careful to chew. This made me wonder if his tongue still hurt him any. If it did, he was wary not to show it. You could see easily that he was run down, the bags under his eyes were astounding. It reminded me of the large weekend bags my Aunt Petunia carried with her when she visited us from Georgia, stock full of handmade petticoats, pearl powder, and peppermints. I was tempted to ask if LaBoeuf had any of these things stored in his eye sockets, but it was a foolish question that would only aggravate him even more. Before I could prepare another mouthful for Mr. LaBoeuf, a gruff and slurred voice made an objection. \"Stop doin' that.\" It was the Marshall, who had finally decided to say something about the feeding. A tinge of embarrassment fell upon me, but I did not cease. This caused an awkward silence that fell over our camp, and only the rain in the trees and the crackling fire could be heard. \"Why are you being so foolish?\" I asked, not wanting an answer, but just wanting to end the dreaded silence. Mr. Cogburn's foolery did not make me angry, but it made my cheeks redden when I realized there wasn't a reason I was feeding him. I felt sorry. \"He's a grown man, he can feed himself.\" I felt Mr. LaBoeuf push away from me as if to separate the awkwardness between us. \"I second that, though I appreciate the help, do not get me wrong by that, Mattie.\" I nodded, pleased that he had relieved me of that duty. It was my own initiative but Marshall Cogburn made a fool of us. I moved back to my own pack, leaving the cup and dodgers near him. I felt small, a feeling I often possessed on this trip. I was fourteen of age, Rooster must have been in his fifties, maybe seventies. Mr. LaBoeuf's age was something of a mystery to me. His features suggested he could have been in his mid thirties, but his way of speaking of himself suggested younger. The two older men, especially Reuben J. Cogburn looked upon me, not as a trail partner, but as a baby they were protecting. There were times when mid conversation, one man would say to the other, \"Mattie's virgin ears would not tolerate this kind of speech.\" And it would be left at that. Never would I care, I was too busy thinking about my justice than worry over petty conversations the two had. I would have liked to think my 'virgin ears' could take quite a bit. Papa has had farmhands with tongues sharper than knives and the pride to match. Their tongues were as slippery as oil and Papa would have them back on the job hunt by supper if they said rude words around the children. I had learn quite a few profanities in my childhood, though I am not eager to share them. \"Get some sleep, Mattie.\" Mr. Cogburn said, laying himself on the cold ground that had only been covered by his wool blanket. It was not long after that before you could hear his whistling snores emitting into the cold winter's night. It was always troubling to get to sleep. Rooster always made such a racket. His snoring was like a storm that shook the earth beneath me. After a while, it would fade away. I'd listen to the frogs and the crickets and Mr LaBoeuf's mumbling. It was comforting. I put my head on my saddle, and listened until I drifted off into a rough slumber. When I woke up, Rooster was still sleeping, unlike the Texas Ranger, who was drinking from his canteen. My head was still fuzzy from sleep, so I did not bother to wish him good morning. He nodded his head towards me, as if he did not wish to say it either. But, we both meant it. We sat in silence for a long time. I felt foolish, the embarrassment had affected me too much. It was time for me to move on from it. \"I have a feeling today we will meet our object.\" I said, letting my pride show in my voice. We were so close. Cogburn was sure they were camping just on the other side of the creek. \"Don't get your hopes up, Mattie,\" LaBoeuf said, keeping his voice low. \"Sometimes things fall apart. We don't know what is going to happen.\" I was disappointed by his honesty. It had always been a thought in my mind that we would not succeed, but I was successful of keeping that thought in the back of it. \"It sounds to me you are not confident in our pursuit.\" I said, wiping an apple clean with my sleeve. \"If you have been in this field for as long as I have, you would understand not everything pans out the way it ought to be.\" I suppose he was right, but his negativity was not doing us any favors. It was around eight in the morning, when LaBoeuf finally shook Rooster awake. He arose without verbal protest. Something told me, he objected his rising. For his good eye shot both the texas ranger and I healthy and cold glares. \"Never mind that,\" LaBoeuf said to the matter, \"Time's a' wastin'.\" We abandoned our camp and traveled across the stream. The air was particularly nippy that day, I remember. I wrapped Papa's jacket tightly around me and took the belt in a notch. There was a steep hill that we stopped in front of, and Cogburn suggested the Lucky Ned Pepper Gang were camping right up there. I noticed I was wearing a stupid grin. Tom Chaney, here I come, I thought wickedly. It was a wonder beyond me how Rooster was able to climb that hill with such determining vigor. He was drunk beyond belief. I questioned if he was as sure as he seemed. Judgement can easily be misplaced with the influence of alcohol. The ground was covered in wet, soft leaves, long dead since the Autumn. This made the quiet trek seemingly impossible. There would be no element of surprise that day. The hill began to even out quickly, as the trees became sparse. We paused a moment. There was no noise, except our heavy breathing, and a bird of prey near by. I felt my heart fall. Has this been a waste of time? \"Shit.\" I heard Rooster grumble, followed by a similar cuss from LaBoeuf. I have never seen the old Marshall move so fast. Ahead of us, there was a clearly and Rooster marched right for it. That was where he was expecting to catch the Lucky Ned Pepper Gang, but to no avail. \"They left last night it seems.\" Rooster said. \"Probably heard Mr. LaBoeuf's gibbering. That damn Texan can't keep his mouth shut. This is the second time he interfered with a good plan of mine.\" \"Yes,\" spat the Texan. \"Blame me.\" \"They could probably smell your sheep shit from all the way up here. That gives them every reason to run, I suppose.\" Rooster let out a cackle, but neither LaBoeuf nor I shared in his amusement. \"Ever since I joined this manhunt, all I have been hearing against my name is slander.\" said LaBoeuf. \"I think it is time for me to make my own time elsewhere.\" \"Was that not our original agreement?\" Rooster pulled out a cigarette. \"I believe it was, and I am prepared to honor it.\" \"Fine then, the gang is gone anyhow. No sense in pursuing further.\" This was not the first time we had nearly fell apart. A few days earlier, LaBoeuf had taken offense to something Cogburn said and left us to ourselves. We came upon him at the Original Greaser Bob's cabin. That is where he was shot and nearly took his tongue in half. In a panic, I said, \"Gentleman, please. We are so close to our goal, witch Chaney nearly in hand. The Lucky Ned Pepper Gang is only a night's ride away.\" \"Mattie…\" Laboeuf looked down, and I could tell then it might have been my 'childish tendencies' to urge further. \"It is just not possible no more.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf, there is a reward waiting back in Texas for you if you catch Chaney. How can you give up now after so many months work?\" \"Well, sometimes things are not meant to be. Some men are just easier than others.\" To that Cogburn gave a hum in agreement. I was not nor am I now a lawman, but I could not let either man just brush away this mission like it was of no importance. Tom Chaney killed my father, and I was not about to let either man get away with giving up. \"You are not leaving.\" A beat occurred before LaBoeuf continued. \"I've made my decis-\" \"No. Tom Chaney killed my father, and I will see him punished for what he did to my family.\" This statement made LaBoeuf give a small shrug, an easily recognizable expression of guilt written on his face. I felt more frustrated than upset. How men are so easy to give up, perhaps law should be a woman's job. Things would certainly get done quicker that way, without the trifling quarrels. \"I'm sorry, Mattie.\" \"If neither of you will escort me, I will find them myself. I have a revolver and enough provisions to last me until then.\" This grabbed their concern, certainly. Cogburn protested. \"You couldn't last two days without us.\" \"Even I could hardly last against the gang, you saw for yourself, how could you?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"That gives you all the more reason to stay,\" I insisted. \"Please, Mr. LaBoeuf. I need you to stay with me. Just like you said to me when we first met.\" Now, I have said things that I have regretted many times, and in the moment, I felt the tinge of regret. I felt my cheeks redden slightly when I noticed Rooster giving us a baffled expression, but my head remained high. It felt silly to feel as embarrassed as I did. \"We don't even know where they would go next.\" LaBoeuf looked at Rooster. \"You know this gang better than I do, Cogburn. Where do you think they would have gone other than straight off the map?\" \"I suppose they went to the Old Place then.\" I turned. Rooster pointed northeast. \"His sister's place, up that ways.\" \"His sister's?\" inquired the Texas Ranger. \"Johanna Pepper, her name is. She runs the coop. Pretty girl, don't go bitin' LaBoeuf. She has her eye on one of the Parmalee brothers. The doctor, I think.\" LaBoeuf stayed quiet, swinging his rifle over his shoulder. \"To the Old Place then?\" \"To the Old Place.\" ","Summary":" Thank you for reading! More coming soon!

Reuben Cogburn explained his plan to Ned Pepper, \"A little bird told me Old Man Richard has a large amount of gold buried in his cellar. Now, I need a group of capable individuals to help me retrieve this gold, and judging by your gang's reputation, it seems like your men are the perfect fit.\" The reason Rooster had sought the Ned Pepper gang's help was their criminal notoriety. They were wanted in more than ten counties, making them the most wanted men west of Indian Country. Although Reuben didn't know if he could trust the gang, he was willing to throw his cards down for the stakes involved. After all, this was no one man job, and the payoff was huge. Ned recited the plan back to Cogburn, \"So you want us to help you break into Old Man Richard's place, get the gold, and ride off into the sunset… that easy? How do you know he's not going to be there, or that there's even going to be gold?\" Cogburn replied, \"Don't worry Ned, the plan is soundproof; I know the old man pretty well, and he leaves his house at two in the afternoon and returns at around six, like clockwork. This gives us more than enough time for us to do what we have to do and get out. He wouldn't even know what hit him. Trust me; the payout will be well worth it.\" Ned was interested, and after a moment of contemplation, he agreed to it. The next day, the gang met up with Cogburn and rode out to the old man's house. They waited in the shadows until the old man finally left his house. It was time to put his plan in motion. Cogburn took a quick look around before advancing towards the house. He walked slowly and deliberately, with one hand on his revolver for reassurance. He rapped on the front door hard and loud, checking to see whether anyone was home. Certain that the coast was clear; he pulled his revolver out, blasted the lock on the door, and kicked it in. He looked back at the gang and gave them the thumbs up sign, and signaled them to follow. He walked into the house, looked around, and was quite impressed by the man's set up. In a compulsive fit of dumb rage, he trashed the man's house, knocking over civil war artifacts and throwing random objects at the wall. Eddie yelled at him to stop, and Cogburn just laughed at him, \"What's the matter Pepper, can't a man have his fun?\"Pepper just shook his head and told him to continue with the plan. Rooster found his way to the cellar door and walked down the steps, looking for the hole that the gold was supposedly buried in. After a moment of searching, he noticed a loose portion of the dirt covering the ground, and started digging there. He got about three feet deep when he felt the shovel hit something hard. He swept the dirt off and caught a glimpse of gold. He joyfully cheered, \"Eureka! We hit the jackpot!\" and continued to dig. The rest of the gang came down to help him pull the gold bars out and load them into bags. They had retrieved at least 20 bars of gold, which was worth more money than Cogburn could even comprehend. \"Looks like we're rich boys!\" exclaimed Cogburn. Ned looked at Cogburn with a sinister smile, and replied, \"Yes, the Ned Pepper gang is rich. Unfortunately, you, Rooster Cogburn, are not part of the gang, and therefore, will not be seeing any of this gold. To be honest, I never liked you Cogburn; you are nothing but a pathetic low life degenerate, and in my eyes, you do not deserve a single piece of this gold. Sorry my friend, but you've been set up.\" \"What the hell! You can't do this, we had an agreement!\" yelled Cogburn. And before he could do anything, Ned drew his pistol out in a swift motion and shoots him straight in the left eye. Rooster dropped to the floor, screaming in agony while clutching his eye. The gang bursts out into a fit of maniacal laughter and Ned Pepper says, \"Let's go boys, our job here is complete.\", and they ride off into the horizon. Half dead and half blind, Cogburn was left moaning and cursing until Old Man Richard returned a few hours later. The scene the old man came back to was horrifying. There was blood everywhere, his house was absolutely trashed, and all his gold was gone. He alerted the authorities immediately; and the Sheriff arrived to arrest Cogburn and bring him in for questioning. The sheriff sat Reuben Cogburn down and started off by saying, \"Explain to me what exactly happened Reuben Cogburn, no bullshitting! I can smell it from a mile away\". Cogburn's appearance was grotesque. His shirt was soaked in blood, and was wearing an eye patch that covered the hole where his left eye used to be. \"It was that goddamn Ned Pepper gang, they double-crossed me! The original plan was to get the gold, in and out, simple! I knew I should have never trusted those dirty rats, goddamnit!\" \"So what you're saying is that Ned Pepper gang betrayed you?\" the Sheriff asked. \"Yes! Those bastards took my gold and left me to die! I would do anything to get back at them\", said Cogburn angrily. The sheriff looked carefully at Cogburn to see if he was lying, but only saw the deep hatred radiating from him. The sheriff was confident that he was telling the truth. He thought about what Cogburn said and came up with a brilliant idea. If he could get Cogburn on his side, he could use him to capture the elusive Ned Pepper gang. After all, the Ned Pepper gang had been in the trouble making business for a long time, and it was about time someone finally shut them down. Weighing his options, he decided Cogburn was capable, and decided to make him a deal. \"So, you would do anything to get back at the Ned Pepper gang huh?\" Reuben nodded. \"How about this, I will cut you a deal, seeing how badly you want to get back at the gang. If you can hunt down the Ned Pepper gang; dead or alive, I will see to it that you are a free man.\", said the sheriff. Cogburn, surprised and wide-eyed asked, \"Wait, so you want me to hunt the Ned Pepper gang down in exchange for my freedom? How the hell would I do that?\" \"Well, I think it is in your best interest to hunt the gang down. It's either that or rotting in a jail cell for a very long time. And as for hunting down the Pepper gang, I will hire you as a U.S. Marshal so that you will have authority in any territory that the Pepper gang might be hiding out,\" said the Sheriff. Cogburn, still doubtful, asked, \"Why would you trust me? How do you know that I'm not going to just go running off on the next train the second I get out of here?\" \"Because I know how badly you want to see the Ned Pepper brought to justice. And if you do run, which I highly doubt, I will personally see to it that U.S Marshals in every state will be searching for you, and you will be caught, and this time you will be hung, comporende?\" replied the Marshal. \"Well, I guess I have no choice Sheriff, I'm in. When do I start?\" Chapter 2: Rooster Cogburn's Life After Author's Notes: 20 Years after Mattie's adventure with Rooster, Rooster is working as a trick-shot gunslinger in a circus show . The sheriff comes to visit Rooster, and they reminisce on their past experiences over a couple of drinks. Reuben Cogburn's day at the circus had finally ended, and he headed back to his tent to get some rest. He plopped himself down on his chair, kicked his boots off, and let out a huge sigh of relief. He thought to himself, \"Jesus, what a long day\", and poured himself a nice glass of whiskey. He lit up a cigarette and let the stress of his day melt away with each drag. If there was a moment Rooster cherished in his life, this would have to be on the top of his list. For Rooster, there is nothing better in the world than to drown himself in a river of whiskey, where everything is perfect and beautiful. He closed his eyes and felt himself nodding off into an alcohol induced sleep. Suddenly, a loud voice cut through the air, \"Ahem, is this Rueben Cogburn's tent?\" which Rooster angrily replied, \"Yes, this is him, what the hell do you want from me?\" \"It's me, the Sheriff, can I come in?\" the voice responded. Rooster groaned and peeked through the entrance of the tent with his good eye. Rooster immediately recognized the fat old man wearing a sheriff's badge and ivory colored uniform. \"Jesus Sheriff, you haven't changed a bit since the last time I saw you Sheriff! Come on in old friend\" laughed Rooster. The Sheriff made his way through the opening in the tent and looked at Rooster. \"And I see you've grown uglier\", joked the Sheriff. He poured the Sheriff a drink and asked him, \"What brings you here Sheriff, I haven't seen you around in years. Aren't you suppose to be fighting evil or something, catching the bad guys?\" \"Well, things have slowed down a helluva lot in my life over the years; I'm not the young man I was before. I'm thinking about turning the badge in soon and retiring. One can't live this lifestyle forever, you know?\" Rooster agreed, \"I see. I know where you're coming from, that's why I joined the circus, figured my time was done. Ah… the good old days, where did they go? I used to be a big shot Marshal, and now I'm on the road with this freak show, shooting apples for a living. Hah, who woulda knew that this is where I end up at the end of my life.\" The sheriff sat down next to Rooster and took a sip of his whiskey and sighed. \"Well, that's life for you Rooster. You never know where you're going to end up with all of its crazy twists and turns\". He paused for a second, looked at Rooster and asked, \"Do you remember the story of how we met each other?\" Rooster thought back for a minute and replied, \"Well, my memory is a bit hazy, but I recall something about you arresting me after me getting my eye blown out. What a crazy day that was huh Sheriff, going from outlaw to U.S Marshal just like that.\" \"Haha indeed, you were a scumbag from the first day I met you. You still are, but at least you've learned to do some good with it\", said the Sheriff. \"Well I sure as hell can't argue with that. I've always wondered how my life would have turned out without you giving me that U.S Marshal job. Hell, I'd for sure be in jail or dead if I continued the path I was going down.\" The Sheriff chuckled, \"Well, lucky you then, I guess I saved you. Oh by the way, have you seen that girl Mattie recently, you know, the girl you saved?\" Rooster felt a surge of nostalgia when he heard her name. It all came back to him, Mattie, Laboeuf, and the Ned Pepper Gang. He hadn't thought about any of those in years, and now it was all rushing in a wave of memories. \"Yes! I do remember! How is she doing?\" he exclaimed excitedly. \"She's doing alright; she never married though, what a pity. But then, she doesn't need a man, she's better off without one.\" \"Yes, Mattie was something else, never met anyone like her. Looking back, I suppose she is the reason I retired as Marshal. After that mission, I just felt like I was done, whatever I was looking for was found, and continuing to be a Marshal would have been a waste of time. It's strange how that little girl could have such a huge impact on me.\" said Cogburn. \"Well, we are all searching for things in life; things that make us feel complete, or things that can help us move on. Shit, I mean, you used to be an outlaw for crying out loud. If I hadn't forced you to become a Marshal, you would've been stuck being an outlaw. Just like if Mattie hadn't came along, you would still be a Marshal, and wouldn't have joined the circus.\" said the Sheriff. \"Hmm, that's an interesting point Sheriff, I never thought of it that way, but now that you say it like that, it all makes sense\", said Cogburn. \"So what's next for you Rooster?\" asked the Sheriff. \"Hell, I don't know, whatever life throws at me next I guess. I mean, that's the meaning of it, right?\" answered Cogburn. ","Summary":" Chapter 1: Rooster Cogburn's Early Years Author's Notes: A look into a scene in the pre-years of Ro"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"Yes, Little Sister","Author":"Child of Mars","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9139270","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Author's Notes: Just a drabble, a fantasy about the origins of Rooster Cogburn, our favorite drunken, grizzly bounty hunter. Yes, little Sister. He didn't remember much from his early days. Laughter, screaming, vibrating music, the air so thick with smoke and alcohol a body could barely breathe. For some forsaken reason he was always on the ground, always jerking his hands out of the way of sharp high heels and dirt covered boots as they stomped across the boarded floor. He remembered getting rusty nails and shards from broken glasses stuck in his knees and palms, leaving little red spots across the saloon floor. He always got food off the floor, or the tables, or the icebox if he could find it. Never was hit or nothing, just never got noticed. He was like the strays, the mean looking dogs that liked to poke their muzzles in and stare hungrily at everything, drawing their teeth up in an unwelcoming snarl when folks dared to be kind to them. He sorta remembered staring back at them, wondering why their eyes were so familiar. Things changed big time when he was about seven or eight…or six, he didn't remember very well. Most everything from those days was fuzzy, specially after he took to drinking. But he can still see a big, ugly man blowing the brains out of a makeup painted, sharp-mouthed woman as she's screaming at him. Then the feller turned the barrell on his own face and pulled the trigger…that was even scarier than the first time. He remembered a short, small strip of a boy; ugly like the man and quick like the woman, sitting under the dusty, splintered table. His bony arms were white as flour where the thick layer of dirt didn't make him look tan as an Indian. He was wrapped all around the table leg like some rattler, his elbows poking sharply out of the tattered sleeves of a man's shirt that was big enough to be his nightie. Folks came, of course. They found the corpses, dragged them outside and buried them in no particular place, probably inside the cemetary boundaries if they were lucky. It didn't matter much to him, except now he gets hit when he snatches food off the table or out of the icebox, and sometimes he gets a good kick in the rear if he's not out of the way fast enough. He's even more like those dogs outside then he was before; when he's noticed, he's not wanted. When he's not noticed, he's forgotten. Maybe those two who kicked the bucket were his Ma and Pa…he didn't know, didn't care. Heck, he still doesn't care. They're nothing but an image of death in his mind, a burst of fire and smoke and blood that made life just a little bit harder than it was. They never gave him anything; they only took it away. No, he doesn't know if they were his folks. And he doesn't care. He finally got thrown out, head over heels, only a few months later…or was it weeks? He doesn't remember. He walked through the streets, looking for food, snatching it from travellers…spent a lot of his time avoiding cartwheels. Saw a boy get killed by one once, saw his head get split open. It's not something he'd want to see again. Things never got better; they just got worse. He'd always been skinny. Now he looked like a walking match that could burst into flames with one spark, eaten up and gone in an instant. He'd always been dirty; now he looked like a swarthy Choctaw boy, ducking under horse stalls and sleeping in the hard, dusty alleyways, where tin cans rolled by him, tossed by the high winds as he slept. He must have been…oh, seven, eight…when they found him. Tall, black robed ladies who smelled like soap, hiding all their hair…if they had any; he'd always been suspicious about that…beneath big white veils. They shook him awake and invited him to their 'home for brats', as the men in the saloon sometimes said. Well, he didn't rightly care much for it until he heard the word, 'food'. They talked real fancy, those nuns did. They insisted on him having a birthday, a saint, and a name. Of course the name was a fancy, tongue-twisting bit of nonsense, like Mattie girl or Le Boeuf would like to hear. Reuben Cogburn. Maybe that's why he let Edna name his boy, his only boy, an awful name like Horace. The home was alright. The kids there were just like him, dirty, homeless, more like wild animals than human beings. The nuns set them up straight, cleaned them, taught them real English…not the garbled, half infant, half swearword language most street urchins spoke…and kept them well fed. His arms stopped poking through his clothes, and a real, healthy tan was able to cover his skin once the protective layer of dirt was scraped away. His favorite nun was the one who held him down for his first bath and slapped him upside the head when he kept taking the Lord's name in vain. She understood that he'd heard it from infancy all right, and she was just as certain he could change, if he only wanted to. She fought him tooth and nail to get him to read and write, but he barely got beyond the alphabet. He just didn't see the need for it, and no one was gonna drive him like some sorry mule to waste his days learning something useless. She read to him from the Bible. He never listened, always getting up and getting pulled back down, playing with his fingers, little twigs and rocks, staring out the window with an injured look of longing, as if he was some bird she'd cruelly caged. That face worked on the other nuns, but not this one. She was impossible to fool. He still remembers the rare look of pleasure on her face when he actually listened to her for once, actually learned something. He didn't really remember what he'd learned, but he did learn it, or else he wouldn't be able to write down nothing. He can write…a little. But that face is one of the sharpest, clearest memories from his past. When he's drunk in a whiskey haze, he can still see her smile. She wasn't pretty…she was actually almost as ugly as he was. He didn't ever care about that…he sorta liked her for it. She had hard hands, a sharp tongue, and the patience of a mountain. She had the presence of a mountain too, and he never forgot her. He forgot her name, but not her. Cause he ran away when he was about…ten…maybe twelve. He ran away and jumped into the world, over his head, out of his league, whirled around by fate in a twisting mess of blood and pain and fear and death until the storm finally spit him out as he was now; missing an eye, overweight, alcoholic, and a mouth so foul he just knew that nun would slap him if she could see him now. He wears a gun too, and uses it better than anyone he knows. He may be passing his prime, drawing closer and closer to the inevitable end. He's got it all settled. He's either gonna get shot, die from drinking, or pass away in some back room, alone and old. He doesn't care. Its not like life ever did really go right for him. He's seen nothing but death. It's the medium he works in, the visions that clog his dreams. After a while, the ghosts stopped haunting him. But he never forgets. He doesn't really remember how he started on the road to being a notorious killer. They wonder why he drinks. They look at him with disgust. He drinks to forget. He drowned the faces of the Warton brothers and their old daddy and the old man and his wife, and his friend, Marshal Potter. They're all dead, and he watches as their faces swirl away in the whiskey, draining to the back of his mind where he doesn't have to look at them anymore, doesn't have to think about them. Same thing at the dugout by the Carillon River, where he accidentally winged that fool LeBoeuf, and shot down Coke Hayes and Clement Parmalee. They were ugly, but they were men. Then he shot Quincy through the head and felt his wet, warm blood spatter on his face. It was done instinctively, all over with a bang. He had just stood there, powerless to turn around, knowing that the girl had seen it all. Then Moon, the thin, cowardly stripling, barely out of boyhood, awkward and ugly and afraid. He died begging for a proper burial. He comforted the boy, he promised he would, and he lied. He left every single one sitting in a ghastly row outside the hut, lining them up to be torn apart and devoured by wolves, bears, and vultures. He wasn't content with killing them; he'd leave them out to be torn into itty-bitty blood shreds. It's why he got drunk, and it's why he didn't sleep the entire night. He's as dirty and foul mouthed and sinful as he was when he's a boy. It seems like nothing's changed, except he's a whole lot older and a whole lot less innocent. But he can't forget those nuns, can't forget that one nun in particular. Which is why he likes this Mattie girl. She's sharp tongued and stubborn and too darn smart for her own good. But she's also got strength, a pure, clean and righteous strength, like those nuns. It's a strength Rueben Rooster Cogburn never had. Which is why he hopes that, somehow, after all this is over, she'll think better of him. He has no idea how to show her, no idea how to tell her…and getting stone drunk and ranting about his failed marriages and bank robberies and murders isn't going to help. She's right. He wallows in filth and bemoans his station and spits and snores. That nun would say the same thing if she were there…except she'd also turn the bed out with him in it. Sometimes he wishes she would. They're all right about him…and yet they're wrong. He knows there's something good about him. He can't put it into words, can't figure it, himself. But he wants them all to know, wants that nun to know that all she did for him wasn't wasted. It's why he's taking on a hopeless mission for a smart mouthed girl, teaming up with a Texas brushpopper and risking his own life out in the middle of a forsaken wilderness on a hopeless hunt for a measly fifty dollars. It's why he's putting up with her whiplike tongue and the bristling hostility from LeBoeuf. It's why he's trying; trying to be better than he ever has been before. And it's why, when he talks to that wonderfully stubborn, strong Mattie girl, he calls her, \"Sister\". FINIS ","Summary":" Author's Notes: Just a drabble, a fantasy about the origins of Rooster Cogburn, our favorite drunke"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"Varnish","Author":"JeanieBeanie33","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7139746","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Disclaimer: True Grit belongs to Charles Portis, the Coen Brothers, and all their affiliates. I'm only borrowing…for now…. Varnish Most women were ridiculous, obsessed with pretense and frippery, but once in a while, an exception proved they were the fairer sex in all ways. Lucky Ned Pepper had never given much thought to others' opinions, but he supposed that, for the aforementioned reason, any thought he did give tended to drift toward women's opinions over men's. Strange, since most women did not care for outlaws, even the ones whom Ned respected. Knowing men like the one sometimes known as Tom Chaney, he didn't wonder why. He looked down at the girl, her face partially covered by his boot. She was awfully young to be out here. Sniffing – the remnants of a head cold – he wondered what her story was. He held on to her as the scrambled up the hill after dealing with Cogburn, more to steady her than to control. She didn't run, only stopped to grab her slightly too-large hat that had fallen. \"May I have some bacon?\" she asked as she reached his camp, not at all rattled despite being surrounded by outlaws. \"You can help yourself,\" he said, spreading his arms wide as if in welcome. \"Have yourself some of the coffee.\" \"I do not drink coffee, I am fourteen,\" she said. Her superior smile was apparent even in her voice. Fourteen? A child still. \"Well we do not have buttermilk and we do not have bread,\" he said, more as a challenge than anything else, and immediately felt ashamed. \"We are poorly supplied.\" \"I will ring your scrawny neck!\" Chaney snarled from behind him, hindered by his wounded side. \"You let that go,\" Ned said. And he meant it. The wound was minor, and the last thing he needed was Tom to kill the most interesting character he'd met in a long while. He turned to her, knowing it would be more truthful than Chaney. \"What happened?\" Ned observed her in silence as she told her story about murdering Toms and dead fathers and federal marshals. Mattie cut a dramatic figure, her back to the plains in one of the most desolate mountain ranges in the country. She wore a large coat, likely not her own, cinched with a belt, and carried that ridiculously treacherous gun. Her pigtails were the only thing that belied her age, and even then, a lot less than those on most girls. Her hat sat perched on her head, making her seem a lot older. An image of an Indian squaw from long ago surfaced in Ned's mind, a woman he had left behind and hadn't thought of for years. She too had worn her hair in pigtails and contained more grit in her thin, borderline-malnourished body than most men Ned had known or met since. Originally, it had shocked him to find a young girl in the wilderness with only a one-eyed fat marshal as dubious protection. Now, hearing it in her own words, it all made sense. The squaw would have ventured into the wilderness to avenge her father's death, too. \"If I had killed Chaney, I would not be in this mess. My revolver misfired.\" He laughed slightly. \"It will do it. It will embarrass you every time. Most girls like to play pretties, but you like guns, do ya?\" \"I do not care a thing for guns. If I did, I would have one that worked.\" Chaney interrupted, disputing her story, and Ned knew instantly he was lying without caring to ask himself why. \"How can you sit there and tell such a big story?\" \"That pit is a hundred feet deep and I will throw you in it,\" Chaney retorted, sounding more like a child than ever when faced with the light of truth. Chaney rambled on as Ned frowned, reaching for his spyglass. Was Rooster over the hill now? Surely he would not leave the girl. There he was. Time to answer another question. \"Was that Rooster that waylaid us the night before last?\" \"That was Marshall Cogburn and myself.\" \"You and Cogburn. Quite the posse,\" he said, more to himself than her. No wonder she chose Cogburn – she was as merciless as he, albeit in different ways. He returned Cogburn's shot, still thinking. He would not kill Mattie unless he had to, and it didn't look like he would. She would not be swayed from her goal of avenging her father's death, and after the journey he knew she must have taken, he could not blame her. Turning Tom in rubbed him wrong, but then, Tom would kill a fourteen-year-old child. Ned knew he would do it. He could leave the girl here and count on Cogburn fearing the wrath of the law for leaving a fourteen-year-old child out here – surely someone knew she was out here. But leaving Miss Ross out here alone as he rode off felt wrong even to him. Ned Pepper was no angel, but he was no Satan, either. He sat across from her once more, tilting his spyglass side to side, even as he acknowledged the doctor's concern at leaving. What to do with Mattie Ross? He stalled, asking about Quincy and the kid, and believed her when she said it was \"a terrible thing to see.\" He had a feeling she didn't use that wording often. \"Please let us move, Ned. The marshall is gone.\" He barely heard him. \"You need a good lawyer?\" Mattie asked. He grinned in dry humor. \"I need a good judge.\" He meant it. The day he faced a judge, he knew he would face judgement day not long after. He would be lying if he said it wasn't warranted. Death was an old friend, anyway. \"What happened to Coke Hayes, the old fellow who fell of his horse?\" he asked. She confirmed that Coke was dead in a manner considerably more pitiless than when she told about Quincy and Moon. It was a good shot by Cogburn – Ned couldn't deny it, although he cursed Rooster's seemingly incapability of letting an outlaw live for trial. \"Your friend Rooster does not collect many prisoners,\" was all he said. Mattie's reaction surprised him. \"He is not my friend.\" Her tone was colder than a witch's nose. \"He has abandoned me to a congress of louts.\" Her unfailing honesty made him smile and wonder what \"civilized\" folk thought when she called them out on their falsehoods. \"You do not varnish your opinion.\" Her silence wiped the smile. He was not a man to care much for others' opinions. He would have finished himself off in one fashion or another if he had. As he looked at her, however, he felt a foreign feeling. Her question of needing a good lawyer let him know that she didn't despise him as she did Chaney, but he knew that her opinion of him would never be as high as his was of her. She thought he was a bad man. And he actually cared. It was not the wisest decision to make, but standing up and looking away from Mattie Ross, he knew what he had to do. He stressed the value of Mattie's life to Tom. He had full confidence in her abilities to survive if it was at all possible, even though he knew Tom was crazy. But Ned knew this was his only chance to give things a shot of being right, without letting his gang lose faith in him. They never liked Tom much, anyway. He left the two, Miss Ross and Tom Chaney. Maybe Mattie would kill him. Probably Rooster would come back. Without a doubt, however, Ned would send a horse later that night just in case. Facing Reuben Cogburn was a relief at first. He was initially quite sure things would go well, both for his remaining gang and Mattie, now that Cogburn was here. Surely he would give them the road. \"I aim to kill you, Ned, in about one minute…\" Those words signaled the end, despite the odds. Your friend Rooster does not take many prisoners . His own words spat back at him, in physical form. He took a deep breath, squaring his shoulders. As the final judgement weighed in, he found peace. He faced all his mistakes. He gave up regrets a long time ago. Most of all, Mattie would be okay. Tom, due to his own fault, would not. When the mysterious bullet hit that prefaced his final fall to the ground, so similar to the night before last yet not, he knew it was from Mattie's direction. It never occurred to him that she could not possibly make that shot, because she seemed as capable as anyone, yet he hoped it was another, Deputy Potter perhaps, not her that fired – surely it had to be…. He never cared much for opinions, murderer and thief that he was, but he supposed that he held Mattie Ross's in the highest. And as Death extended his hand, he hoped that, years from now, years he wouldn't see, she would look back on today and think that maybe he had not been a hero, but he had not been so bad. -Fin- This is the hardest piece of fanfiction I have ever written. Barry Pepper's performance as Ned spoke volumes, but as for the exact nature of those volumes, it was hard to flesh out. I adore True Grit, from the characters to the plot to the setting, and all I can hope is that I gave one of the most interesting minor characters created the spotlight that he deserves, if only for a few pages. Please review – I really want to know if I got his voice right.

She had protested but her mother had insisted that her sixteenth birthday should be celebrated. Mattie had no mind to enjoy the company of strangers. She was yet to make one friend and no man came close to her expectations. The young boys had given up on this strong-minded girl in order to avoid unnecessary embarrassment. Her sharp wit had alienated many of the townsfolk and honestly she preferred it this way. Better to be alone then in dull-minded company. When she thought the day could not possibly get worse. They showed up at her doorstep obviously pained to be in each others presence. \"What on gods green earth are you doing here?\" demanded Mattie. \"Last time I checked there aint nothing green around here\" retorted Cogburn. \"Did mother invite you?\" \"Well ma'am Cogburn here despite his continuous supply of seized whisky deduced that it was soon to be your birthday. He decided we should both come and visit and couldn't be dissuaded otherwise\" said LaBoeuf. He looked different to when Mattie had last seen him. The moustache was gone and replaced with the short yet rough looking stubble commonly found on younger men. Mattie was pleasantly surprised at the difference. She let the tension grow thick and watched as the men began to rethink their decision to visit before she gave them a beaming smile. First she ran to Cogburn and gave him the biggest hug she could muster up whilst fighting the urge recoil from the stench of whisky. Her embrace with LaBoeuf was a little more awkward. They're arms didn't seem to connect properly but we'll put that down to nerves. In the end they gave up and LaBoeuf simply tipped his hat in her direction. Cogburn chuckled to himself. He may have been a drunkard but he was no fool. He saw the way Mattie looked at LaBoeuf. He also knew the ranger wouldn't make a move during their hunt for Tom Chaney but the game had changed now Mattie was sixteen. He had opened the door and if they were so pigheaded as to not walk through it then that was their loss. \"Well aren't you going to invite a tired old man inside?\" Chirped up Cogburn. \"Honestly I think you would be more comfortable in the barn then mingling with my ma's cohort. I'll fetch you some food meet me round back\" The barn was warm and well kept courtesy of Mattie. The old Marshall had already made himself a bed of hay and blankets. With his whiskey in hand Cogburn was more than happy to block out LaBoeuf's constant yammering. LaBoeuf took a little while longer to make himself comfortable. He sat in the small amount of light offered by the oil lamp pondering how much Mattie had grown. As far as he could tell she was just as fiery as usual but she had a ladylike air to her that was absent in her younger days. Mattie entered the barn carrying with her a small candle. visitors in her house had long since departed but she was yet to inform her mother of their new guests. She wanted to spend the night with LaBoeuf and Cogburn like old times before their presence was made known by the whole town. Once that happened any alone time spent with her former companions was sure to be seen as improper. \"LaBoeuf? Cogburn?\" \"Mattie?\" replied LaBoeuf. Mattie spotted the small lamp light and sat next to the ranger. \"I should have you know that I am not accustomed to spending the night in barns with strange men.\" \"and I am not accustomed to riding with marshals but there's a first time for everything.\" \"What has become of Cogburn?\" queried Mattie. LaBoeuf merely nodded towards a bundle of hay Cogburn was somehow tangled up and passed out in. \"He sure does paint a sad picture, doesn't he?\" The Texan edged closer to Mattie, their intimacy may have failed earlier that night but he was sure that wouldn't happen again. Mattie was still staring at her passed out friend as LaBoeuf brushed the hair away and kissed her soft neck. Mattie jumped up and slapped him hard. \"What one earth do you think you're playing at?\" \"oh come on now Mattie you're making a big deal outta nothing why don't you just sit down.\" \"what would possess me to put my self in your grasp again\" \"Grasp, I merely kissed you, should I have asked permission first!\" said Lebeouf in a slightly raised tone. \"Yes any gentleman would have.\" \"what's the point in that? I was sure you would say yes.\" \"Well then you really are a half-wit.\" Shouted Mattie slightly hurt by LaBoeuf's assumption but also kicking herself for throwing away a perfect opportunity. Before LaBoeuf could reply a still passed out Cogburn rolled over and murmured in his sleep \"There's many theories about arguin' with a Woman, None of them Work.\" This time LaBoeuf actually listened to the ranger. He took a step towards Mattie and began to apologize profusely. She was smart enough to notice an opening and she wasn't about to throw away this chance either. She threw herself at LaBoeuf. He caught her and their lips met. He kissed her roughly grabbing her cheek with his right hand and placing his other hand on the small of her back. She wrapped her arms around his neck it was Mattie's first kiss and she had to say she wasn't very impressed. As far as kisses go it was more than enjoyable but according to Mattie Ross there was nothing very euphoric about a tongue down her throat. What did stir her on though was the way LaBoeuf's huge member felt against her upper thigh. She moved in closer. His breathing became deeper and they were both glad that Cogburn's cot was on the top floor of the barn. LaBoeuf laid Mattie down on a haystack. He crawled on top of her and undid the top part of her dress. Mattie's small soft breasts were revealed and he ran his hand over them. The barn door opened unexpectedly and in came another girl holding a candle. This girl was smaller and younger than Mattie \"I'm a tell mama on you\" said Victoria defiantly \"go on now run on home to mama I'll be sure to tell her about that boy of yours. What is he called Ezekiel?\" The blood drained from Victoria's face, she was only a few years younger than Mattie but she would most certainly receive a spanking for her meetings with the reverends boy. Mattie shot her sister a look and Victoria ran back inside with her tail between her legs. During the debacle LaBoeuf had awkwardly remained on top of Mattie and when the barn door closed behind Victoria he rolled onto his back next to Mattie. She used his chest as a pillow and they quickly feel asleep. Cogburn who had never actually passed out wondered if he had made a mistake bring LaBoeuf to yell county. He may have opened the door but he sure as hell wasn't expecting them to charge through it like wild bulls. Mattie couldn't help but think that this wasn't at all like the good old times with LaBoeuf and Cogburn. LaBoeuf for the first time was rendered speechless and thoughtless.

I thought the cinematography was stunning, as well as the story and the female lead. I think I have a crush on LaBoeuf now, unfortunately, and I started shipping him and Mattie like crazy. I usually hate facial hair, but oh my god, Matt Damon was hot as LaBoeuf. So fail in the beginning, but halfway through, his heart of gold came in and asdaljdsakjdlajdskjd. Damn. ^Obviously written a while back, but my stance remains firm. Though I'm not much of a movie person, True Grit will probably be one of my favorites for a long time. Disclaimer: Do not own True Grit. When Mattie was picking out apples for her adventure, she picked them out, like with everything else she did, carefully. Fingers held gently, but firmly on the waxy red skin, she scanned the fruit with a brief discerning eye. Bruised. Too waxy. Too mushy. Rotten . Her fingers nimbly picked through the apples with the same lightness and ease in her heart that morning. After all, all young girls dream of adventure, and her adventure would include the swift, sweet deliverance of justice to her father's murderer. And in addition to monetary funds, she would be contributing provisions to her business partner. Yes, this would be a grand adventure indeed. And when she saw LaBoeuf over her shoulder, mocking her from the other side of river with that cocky, insipid, Texan smile of his, Mattie went livid. How dare he insult her? How dare he ruin her plans? How dare he ruin her justice for some senator and his dog? Her eyes as red as the apples tucked in her flour sack, she tucked her hand into the bag and let fly, forcing Little Blackie across the river, spluttering and swimming behind her horse. And when she felt the ground under her once more, she stood. She was cold and she was wet. Water dripped down her face and rained from the brim of her hat. She probably looked like a poor imitation for a proper young lady, but still, she stood with her head tall and proud just as she was taught to. Feeling Rooster's amused smirk, she gave a brief nod of her head before turning to glare at LaBoeuf. LaBoeuf. His ancestors were French from that last name. How many Texan Rangers were French, she wondered. Were they all as stupid and pompous as him? As ignorant and insolent as him to ruin a girl's mission for justice just for a bounty? To make her waste vital provisions? Indignation boiled in her stomach. She regretted ever being taken in by those spurs or the profile of his face. Hat still dripping—possibly—hopefully on those blasted spurs of his—she marched straight up to the still-stunned Texas Ranger and looked him dead in the eye. \"I wasted an apple on you. I hope you're worth it.\" And with that, she marched back towards Little Blackie. ","Summary":" Inspired by the apple scene in True Grit (2010), which I watched today with my friends.

A nightmare. He leaned against the maple headboard and inhaled deeply to calm his mind. Once. Twice. Three times. He felt the weariness of too little sleep in his eyes and the sweat of the hot night creep down his neck. He looked at the girl sleeping beside him, curled up in the quilts and undisturbed by his own arousal. Little flecks of saliva caught in the corners of her pouty, sun chapped maw as she breathed noisily through her mouth. Her hair was a tangled mess of light brown, streaked with gold from the sun. Her limbs were lightly browned, freckled and roughed up from all her work outside. This sleeping creature was the closest thing Tom Chaney ever had to a constant woman. He got up sloppily, scratching himself as he made his way over to the washbasin. He splashed his face with the lukewarm water letting it dribble down his face and through his beard. It hardly did a thing for the dirt across his face but rinsed the sweat well enough away. He massaged his slackened, square jaw allowing a few drops of water to fall into his mouth. It tasted salty after intermingling with his sweat. Tom always dreamed of guns the night after he killed a man. 'There could be worse punishments' he always thought to himself. Being haunted by visions of weapons was a small price to pay compared with being apprehended. He walked over towards the chair in which his trousers were carelessly tossed the night before. He reached in the pockets and pulled out two gold pieces, he rattled them in his hand grinning. \"Serves that bastard fool right, for thinkin' me trash,\" Chaney grumbled aloud, stuffing Frank Ross's stolen pieces back into his trouser pockets. He got up and looked out the window, spying the fat mare watering herself at the trough. \"Who's callin' you trash Tom Chaney?\" came the sleep drenched, somnolent voice of his bedded companion. She leaned up on her arms, his own shirt hanging off of her small frame. Her eyes were a golden brown with tired circles underneath. Tom stomped back over to the bed and joined her. \"Nobody worth nothing\" he huffed angrily. He looked at her, frowning. \"You wearing my shirt as bedclothes now?\" She shot him a defensive look. \"I was cold!\" she stated, a tinge of resentment in her voice. \"You came in last night all out of the blue, covered in cuts and scrapes mumblin' 'bout some bar fight you had in Fort Smith. I tended your wounds, fed you my bread and you strip off all my clothes and have your way with me, rather roughly I might add! Then you fall asleep leaving me naked in the dark, not the slightest idea where you had strewn my clothes. I see your shirt and I put it on.\" This had been his and Clara's relationship for some time now. She had been young when it began, maybe a little older than nineteen. They met on her father's farm. Chaney had been searching through her family's food stores in the dead of night. However instead of absconding with their stock he found himself face to barrel with a shotgun, its proprietor a nineteen-year-old Clara. At the time, Chaney was unarmed, starving and a little bit yellow. While he refused to stoop to begging, he did his best to utilize his situation to tug at the young girl's heartstrings. Clara took pity on the careworn man and told him he could spend a few nights in the hayloft provided he stayed out of sight and helped her with a few of her chores. He begrudgingly obliged for the room and board. His work was not too difficult, mostly cleaning and feeding jobs that Clara would otherwise have to wake up early to accomplish. He would sleep for most of the day and would be brought food by Clara often. Most of their conversations revolved around where he'd been and what he'd seen, which to Tom wasn't too much. But for an impoverished working girl stuck on her parents' farm, it was an entirely new world opening up. They got together every night to share a meal, a few stories and commit to the evening's work. The found enjoyment and humor in one another's company, making the work seem less daunting, and the time pass quicker. A week or so had passed and Tom was getting ready to move on, but not before a final evening's work. While brushing down the horses a torrential downpour began outside. A soaking wet Tom found an equally damp Clara waiting for him in the hayloft with a satchel of food to take with him on his journey. \"Now you don't need to worry 'bout bringing that back\" Clara said, indicating the satchel. \"Momma won't miss it one bit.\" \"Did not even cross my mind\" Tom said with a gruff laugh, reaching into the satchel and pulling out an apple. He bit into it, sending juice everywhere, decorating his beard with traces of the fruit. Clara laughed at him and he turned to her. \"What?\" he demanded, furrowing his brow. \"You are a terrible mess Tom Chaney,\" she declared, crawling towards him. She knelt at his side, pushing his damp, dark hair out of his eyes. \"I refuse to be called a mess by a girl who looks as if she has been tossed in a lake\" he retorted, wiping his mouth and placing his face dangerously close to Clara's. There had been an unmistakable tension between the two the moment he was staring down the barrel of her shotgun. It was thick, almost tangible, like the humidity that hung in the air as the rain toppled down upon the hayloft. Tom looked at Clara who stared fixedly at his mouth, her own chapped lips slightly parted. \"I mean\" he began \"look at your dress. You are a sopping wet mess yourself, like a half drowned cat.\" He reached for the buttons of her dark dress, heavy and clinging with the rain. Clara allowed his rough hands to linger at her dress for a moment, her mind clouded with the earthy scent of his hair. Coming to her senses she took a hold of his hand and moved it away. He was a criminal and a thief, not to mention a good many years her senior. Not one to be denied Tom looked up at her. He took her face in his hands and kissed her aggressively. She defensively placed her palms at his chest in struggle, but he held her tighter, and kissed her harder. Between each rough embrace he stopped and looked at her. With every torrid stare Clara gave in a little bit more, eventually kissing him back. He invaded her young, hot mouth and hastily undid the buttons of her dress. She permitted his hands to explore her body, moist with rain, sweat and excitement. They succumbed to the tension between them, and consummated their knowing of each other in the rain drenched evening. When they were through they laid together amongst the sweet smelling hay and humid air. They both began to dress themselves, not an ounce of shame between the two for what they had done. Clara turned to Tom \"Now you will be back some time won't you?\" Tom froze, questioning the worth of the tryst. He stood and offered her his hand to help her up, she took it. \"Now Clara you listen here…\" he began. She threw her head back and laughed. \"You should see the look on your face!\" she shouted, slapping her knee in a fit of laughter. \"Do not worry, I do not believe you own me anything! Even if I were that kind of girl Tom Chaney I do not want nor believe I ever could make an honest man out of you. That bein' said I've grown rather fond of having you around, and you can not deny similar feelings. Go on, go about your life and I shall go about mine. But whenever you find yourself in the area with nowhere to board you can feel free to come back here, that's all.\" Tom grinned, it was true he could not argue with his attraction towards the girl, while he would never go as far as to call it a fondness. \"Well I thank you for your hospitality. And while I can not in any honesty say I will see you soon, I can now say I will see you.\" He grabbed the satchel and made his way towards that ladder. \"Now I am off, and you best be back inside your house before your Daddy finds himself awake.\" He left, walking through the wet approaching morning. Through the following three years Tom had made several visits to the farm of Clara's family. Returning for food, light work, board and the company of Clara. Her parents had since died, worn thin from the hard work that came with owning a farm, so the responsibility had fallen to Clara. His visits were not frequent, he came and went as he pleased, but they were enjoyed. Clara's farm made an excellent place to remain anonymous for a few days while lying low. She was aware of what he was and did not ask too many questions. \"Well it is now light\" Tom said \"and you can see exactly where your own bedclothes have fallen. So I want mine back.\" He began greedily unbuttoning the shirt Clara wore, exposing her naked body underneath. She laughed and allowed him to carry on. He laid his head in her breasts and looked up at her. \"I do not like how your eyes are the same color as your hair\", he reported, gruffly. \"Well I do not like how you turn up in my bed, drunk and smelling of the trail. But I have come to accept that there are some things we cannot change about ourselves, and I do wish you'd do the same\" she said slyly with a smile. Tom smacked her thigh, light enough to not mean any real harm, but hard enough to leave a mark. \"I smell fine,\" he said. He closed his eyes and rested on her flesh. He smelled her skin, she always smelled like hay, biscuits, honey and musk. Something in her blood, he thought. He liked Clara very much. There were always other women he found in saloons or other dark places and they got him through well enough. But Clara was different; she was good company to keep. Nothing worth tying him down, but nothing small enough to lose either. She stroked his hair. \"You were hollerin' in your sleep again, having a nightmare I suppose.\" Tom opened his eyes, a streak of anger coursing through him. He got up off the bed, leaving her. \"Maybe\" he said, back to her. \"I never remember my dreams anymore\" he lied, as he pulled up his trousers. \"I am guessing you want some breakfast,\" Clara said finding a dress and clothing herself. It had been months since Tom's last visit and the furthest thing from her mind was making him cross. Changing the subject to food typically helped. \"That is a safe bet to make\" Tom said. \"You get to it, I need to check on the horse.\" He left the house to attend to the mare, making sure not too much harm came to her while he had been unfit to ride her. Save for a few cuts on her flank and a mussed up fetlock she was in fine enough condition. He went back inside to bacon in a pan in the hearth and toast in the fireplace. He sat down at the table and Clara brought him a mug of coffee. \"You snag that mare off'a the man you were fighting in the bar?\" Clara asked him, setting out the food and buttermilk. Tom grabbed a fistful of bacon and shook his head no. \"From the man who got between me and him\" he said between mouthfuls. \"He was a meddler and a nogoodnik. Thought me to be foolish an' unimportant.\" \"So you beat both of them then? You weren't scraped up too bad,\" Clara said munching away on toast. \"I knocked the first man out, and silenced the busybody. I did not enjoy working for him in any fashion. Being in his employment was likened to bein' in hell.\" Clara stopped chewing and looked taken aback. \"The man you killed was your employer?\" Tom looked at her and nodded, taking a long swallow from his mug. Clara frowned, shaking her head. \"I can not agree with that.\" Tom stared at her, confused and cross. \"You would sooner agree with the man who would hardly give me nothing for my work, and continue to think of me as without worth?\" \"Of course not\" Clara said, audible concern in her voice. \"But Tom darlin' you come here every once in a while and tell me tales of the places you've been, the men you've killed there and the loot you've stolen off of em' and never once have I raised my voice. I know who you are and I know what you do.\" \"One of the reasons I like you Clara\" Tom said. \"You don't think little of me, do yah?\" \"No Tom, I do not. And it is certainly one thing when you come here tellin' me a story of a man in bar you've killed or an Injun on the trail. But it is another thing killing a man of standing that you work for only because he had said something that did not sit well with you.\" \"I was under his employment out of pity, he did not think kindly of me at all. And Tom Chaney does not accept pity!\" he shouted at Clara. \"Tom let us speak honestly in the idea that without a little pity you would have never lasted as long as you have!\" Clara boldly stated. \"What do you call what I presented you with three years ago?\" Tom stared at her as his anger rose. Clara remained perfectly still, meeting his cold gaze. He got up and advanced towards her grabbing her by the scruff of the neck. For the first time in the years they had know one another he brought his fist down upon Clara with the intention of hurting her. He beat her until her cheek bled, when she finally wriggled out of his grasp. For the first time Clara experienced who he really was. She had heard about it, she had seen it and she had known who he was; but she had never before felt it for herself. She had grown accustom to never being completely treated well by Tom in the gentleman's sense, nor had she been treated by any means poorly by him. Him striking her however, altered that standard completely. She felt her wound and shook her head. \"You are no longer welcome in my house, Tom Chaney\" she stated. He gaped at her, slack jawed.\" \"Get out of my house!\" she shouted, pointing at the door with contempt. \"I never wish to see you again.\" Any feelings of goodwill he once had towards her were now completely overridden by his tremendous rage. Tom advanced on Clara once again, knocking over the table and chairs that stood in his path. She shrank up against the wall, he could feel her fear. He pinned her down on the dusty wood floor, his large dirty hands grasping her throat. She made her best efforts to fight him off, but even her farm worked body was no match for his brute strength. She writhed underneath him, kicking and flailing, tears welling up in her brown eyes. They never took their eyes off one another; she could squirm, stare and thrash all she wanted he would not let her go. He would make her pay for her words. Clara continued to kick and gurgle until her body finally fell still, and breath failed her. Tom paused and listened closely for any signs of life within her. When none were heard he loosened his grip around her neck, inspecting the welts his fingers left. He frowned, his hulking, stupid face contorted with a kind of regret. \"Oh Clara\" he whined. \"Why'd you make me do it? I did not want to do it!\" He knelt beside her still body and closed her eyes with his fingertips. Without another glance at his young lover he cleared the house of supplies and provisions. He hitched whatever he could carry to his fat mare and rode off into Indian territory, where Lucky Ned Pepper would be waiting for him.

The springs grinding harshly against her back, with fringy felt gloved fingers digging into each arm of hers, close to the balls of her shoulders. Her eyebrows twitched, and her eyes sparkled. She swallowed, before a felt gloved hand made it up strongly around her neck, but not tight enough to strangle, with one thumb pressed against her jawline to the left side, and four left over fingers against the length of her scrawny neck. XXX \"Don't be scared.\" the handsome Ranger assured her, in a sweet, calming tone of voice, and she had nodded in agreement, placing one of her own hands against his, letting her fingers gently trace along the fringe of his glove. Mr. Laboeuf moved his hand, and poked at the vein, pulsing out of her neck, with the other grabbing on securely to the back of her pretty little head. Mattie let her eyes wonder around, while the Ranger sat atop her, using less of his normal weight, in worry he could crush her. . . The young girl breathed in the hot air slowly, then exhaled it all again, removing one hand from a random side, and brought it up carefully, without much force, placing her palm against his hard, yet soft clothed chest. Laboeuf stared her deeply in the eyes, and so had she. The closeness, and quietness caused her to blush red and turn her head instantly to the side. The Ranger cocked his own head slightly, and used a hand to bring her head back, with her big brown eyes locked tight and securely by his blues. \"This seems terribly wrong, Mr. Labo-boeuf.\"the girl beneath him struggled, and brushed against him, while attempting to make a break for it, but only once had he held her down with such force, to kept her still. He inhaled more strongly than he had before, and used two fingers to brush away the sticky strands of brown hair from her eyes. Mattie felt a bit uncomfortable and tense by his unknown actions, but knowing that she was cared for, she knew it was safe. \"You ain't gotta' worry, Ms. Ross. I'm a Texas Ranger, and I won't let a thing hurt you.\"he smirked behind that mustache, before leaning in slow, and found his lips so close to hers, with just a mere, small quiver, they'd be truely touching. XX Mattie just couldn't believe what she was doing. Her heart was racing faster than it ever has before, and her mind was a scrambled mess. She didn't have a clue what to do, but tried to understand everything Laboeuf did to her. :: The space between them was fairly quickly becoming over ridden by the meeting of their bodies. It gave Laboeuf a strange feeling in his gut, and he soon found himself stopping, with the musky smelling, hot, sweating air around them enclosing them closely together, but also so far apart. Laboeuf was dripping soon enough that he had used each arm to hoist himself up from the young one beneath him, and his rear sitting on the left side of the bed, back toward the window, that was the source of the hot summer air. Mattie, whom remained flat on the bed, slowly rose high on her elbows, and licked her drying lips. XX She could tell just by the backside of Mr. Laboeuf that he wasn't too happy with his intimate actions toward her, and before jerking to her knees, Laboeuf dropped to his feet, spurs crying out loud. He didn't even bother to take a turn-around, as he retrieved his hat from the chair, and put it back on. \"I must depar-!\"he was cut off so suddenly, when being grabbed fairly hard with wrapped arms around his waist as he brought his eyes down. XX He brushed a finger over one bushed brow, before attempting to free the young one from him. But it was no use. She was wrapped tightly, and he was soon pulled toward the bed, with her rosey cheek pressed against him. \"Don't leave Mr. Laboeuf.\"she begged him softly, the arms around him becoming tighter. Laboeuf knew it wasn't right, but it wasn't right to ignore the little one. \"I'm sorry, Ms. Ross, I am a busy man.\"he reassured her, grabbing loosely to both her hands and removed them, each at once. He didn't want to leave her like this, but had no choice. He turned around after getting her free, staring at her on her knees above the bed. He swallowed, removing his hat, and slowly leaning forward, where Mattie had turned a deep red, having a thought as to what could happen. \"You think I would let a man such as yer' self steal a kiss from me?\"Mattie smiled, with words that completely blown Laboeuf away. He stepped back, with a plain expression. \"I believe you would, Ms. Ross.\"he acknowledged, stroking his chin, before dropping his hat limp on the chair at the foot of the bed. The young girl snickered behind a hand, right as she crawled back into the covers, wrapping it loosely, staring, exhausted, at the cowboy before her. They continued to stare. :: \"Don't you need to be somewhere, Mr. Laboeuf?\"the girl added, before the man even thought about stepping a boot forward. He didn't respond right after that. XXX XXX Laboeuf swallowed hard, and nodded his head. \"Yes, Ms. Ross, I must leave before long.\"he wipped a sweat from his forehead, and turned 'round, moving toward the door, where his hand grasped the rusted knob. But something had stopped him. Mattie cocked her head, and swung her legs free of the quilts, dropping each foot to the cold floorboards below, her hands in her lap. \"What is it, Mr. Laboeuf?\"she smiled as so, and stood up tall, to the soles of her feet, walking, until she was met right behind him, when he made a swift turn around. He didn't make a sound. Neither had she. She could tell she was making him nervious, watching him swallow for the third time already, and took that felt hat from his head, dropping it at his side, in a clutched hand. \"Nothing, Ms. Ross.\"he spoke, breath full of hot air that escaped, reaching her face, that seemed as hot as his breath. Mattie snickered unwillingly cute, catching more of Laboeuf's attention that she could handle. Then he broke the silence, eyes darting right upon hers. \"Yer' so young, Ms. Ross.\"he smiled half-heartedly, more of a grin than a smile, as he reached out to touch her face. She looked at his hand and grabbed it. \"Your so...so old, Mr. Laboeuf.\"Mattie tried so hard not to let it come out like that, but it did, and there was no taking it back. He raised a single brow high, forcing his hand away. \"What's that 'pose to mean, Ms. Ross?\"he was a bit frustrated with her few words, but it caused him to smile back at her, watching her lips curve into a soft smile. She refused to say a word. \"You know what I am tryin' to say, Mr. Laboeuf, don't be such a foolish m-man.\"she quivered slightly at the end, eyes downcast, hoping it didn't hurt him as much as she thought it could. Both were lost for words afterwards. He moved a little, and so had she. XX \"Foolish?\"he repeated in a sort of frustrated tone of voice, letting the hat fall out of his grasp, and returned to her with strong fingers pinched deep into each arm, after removing them from around his bandoiler. She swallowed warm saliva deep in her throat, hurting a bit as if went down, staring him hard in the face. But she was strong, and stood up to him. \"Yes, foolish, Mr. Laboeuf. Your a foolish man.\"she was terribly close, nose up high, eyes sparkling in his blues that had a tight hold of her, nostrils flaring. She didn't understand what had come over her that moment. She felt terrible about it, and had caused such a caring man to leave, heart filled with pain, and eyes slightly stinging with fresh, warm tears, that hadn't fallen yet. The thought of it all brought a chill to her body, and cringed her nose hard, after shutting her eyes, and falling down upon her knees, so strongly holding back tears.

She screamed, once, when the bone-saw snagged— opened her eyes and stared, but I don't think she saw much of anything. The blanket now was sunken on the far side of the bed. Flat, where it should have been tented by her arm. There weren't many prospects for a maimed girl-child with a tongue like a whip of fire, but on thinking of it, the loss didn't seem so severe as all that. If I knew Mattie Ross at all, the lack of a limb would not warrant much more than a shrug and a sniff. If she'd just open her damn eyes. I gripped down on her shoulder and leaned close. \"Girl, you come round this moment or by the grace of God I will whip the very tar out of you.\" If I'd hoped for a revelation, I was to be disappointed. Even that insultingly empty threat produced no high-handed retort, no sharp glance. The lashes did not so much as flutter. With a grunt, I subsided. Leaned back and settled into the worn chair I'd claimed. They'd tried to remove me from the room once— and only once— and since then I had become an institution. The doctor simply moved around me during his periodic visits, as though I did not exist at all. I reached out, then— slow and careful, like I was approaching a she-cat with kits— and touched her that tangled mass of hair. \"I hope you found what you were lookin' for,\" I muttered. \"I hope it was all worth it.\" My knuckles ran lightly down her cheek before I let my hand fall heavily to my side. So young. What a fool of a thing. Settling back into my chair with a grumble for the sake of sore bones, I tilted my hat down over my eyes and got ready for another evening of silence, save for the quiet sound of her breathing and my own rasping cough. When a small hand slipped into mine long moments later, I did not move. And when a small voice whispered, \" It was ,\" I made no sound. But when the hand had fallen lax and her breathing was slow and even, I think, for a moment, that I may have smiled.

But she had not, and would not , budge. Her right hand was placed gently on her tweed skirt; she was absorbed in staring at the silver hand-hewn wedding band that bedecked the ring finger she had. \"Mattie? You comin'?\" He prodded gently. She raised her dark stare and he flashed her an impeccable grin that he reserved for special occasions. LaBoeuf hadn't realized that the morning after their wedding would be warranted as yet another 'special occasion'. Her eyes narrowed and she shook her head. Her unruly locks swayed, as she had yet put her hair up in any sort of fashion. Unruly hair that might have been attributed to how he had manhandled it the prior evening, along with a few -ahem- other items. \"No.\" \"You can't stay in here for eternity. You'll starve.\" Thoroughly he enjoyed this, their camaraderie. The banter between them that stood as a guise for the desire they craved from each other. As he should, undoubtedly. Since a lifetime of it awaited him. Her gaze was steady. \"Eternity, Mr. LaBoeuf? In a boardhouse bedroom? Truly you know me better than to throw such ill-mannered exemplifications my way. Eternity? No. For as long as I damn well please? Why, yes.\" Her sudden and sharp curse made him chuckle, and she threw him a glare. \"May I ask to why all the fuss?\" Were all young brides this queer? He could only imagine whatever else nonsensical lay before him. Horsefeathers, it was. It also didn't help matters much that his extensive knowledge of young brides (and the female species, to be perfectly honest) was fairly new and limited. She had not answered him yet. He sighed. LaBoeuf could hear and smell the bacon frying just beyond the first floor. Mrs. Hemsworth, the board house keeper didn't look too kindly on those who were tardy to breakfast. But then again, Mrs. Hemsworth had not yet met the iron will of a certain Mattie Ross. He halted and corrected himself. LaBoeuf. The surname now counted for two. \"They'll know.\" Mattie lowered her voice to just above a whisper. And before he could ask, she finished with: \"They'll know what we have been doin' in here.\" She blushed. He laughed. \"We have more than a day's ride to Yell County. I insist you gain your bearings, Mrs. LaBoeuf .\" And with that his spurs against the floorboards and a final hearty chuckle were all that could be heard.

A few minutes later ,they heard a truck moving in -Winter and Hope peeked their heads out of the water to see just why there was a truck . The humans open the back gate and in the back of the truck ...was a...dolphin![Chapter 2] A Few Minutes Later~ Hazel helped her Dad with putting the dolphin into the tank where Winter and Hope were. After the dolphin got into the water, all three of the dolphins looked up at Hazel. They gave her the,\"Who Is this?\",look. \"Winter,Hope,this is Donny, he is going to be living with you guys until we build him a tank for himself. I think you two are going like each other.\", saidHazel. She started to giggle until her Dad called her. This left the three dolphins staring at each other silently not knowing what to do next. The whole aquarium went quiet. Meanwhile,Hazel And Her Dad~ \"You've been talking to the dolphins?\", asked Clay. Hazel to smiled and blushed while giggling in embarrassment. \"Yep\", she answered. The two of them went by Winter and Hope's tank. They noticed the three dolphins just quietly stared at each other. \"Do you think that Donny could be a mate for Winter?\",asked Clay. He turned his head towards his daughter, both of them burst into laughter,then,continued to walk while having smiles on their faces.[Chapter 3] In the tanks,Winter looked at Donny and Donny looked at him back. They both responded with a squeaking noise like they were saying,hello. Hazel saw it. She was amazed how Winter and Donny communicating. \"Dad,look!\", Hazel exclaimed. Clay came over to see. He looked down at Winter and Hope's tank to see Donny and Winter meeting. He was cracking up at Hope, looking a little confused to what was going on. \"How adorable, Hazel.\" Clay was pleased to see how Donny and Winter were meeting. They were nuzzling each other on the noses. Clay smiled. \"Alright, I'm going to work on some papers okay.\",Clay told Hazel walking away. \"Okay,you go do that.\", said Hazel,as she looked down at Winter's tank thinking to herself \"Maybe Winter needs help on how to fall in love with Donny.\"[Chapter 4] The Next Day~ Hazel walked towards the dolphin tank. All three of the dolphins were playing in the water. The three dolphins saw Hazel. Hope and Donny stopped what they were doing to watch as Winter swam up to Hazel. \"Hey Winter.\", replied Hazel. Winter responded with a cute dolphin noise. Hazel giggled,\"Alright,Winter,why don't you just go play with Donny over there?\" Winter took one look ,then,looked back at Hazel. \"Come on ,Winter, just engage with him or something like that.\", urged Hazel. Winter looked back at Donny, then,swam over to him. Donny watched her swim towards him. When Winter stopped swimming. The both of them stared at each. Winter looked back at Hazel as if she's saying,\"What am I'm suppose to do?\" Hazel gave Winter some examples on what to do to interact with Donny. Winter listened those examples by swishing herself and moving her tail side by side. This made Donny's eyes focused to see what Winter was doing. Then, Winter swam herself in a circle. This made Donny not interested and he swam off. \"Yup,Winter does need some practicing into liking him.\" Thought Hazel to herself after watching the whole thing.[Chapter 5] The Next Day~ Hazel taught Winter on how to interact with Donny. Some of her lessons were helpful, some of them were kinda goofy and weird. Winter chuckled and was a little distracted. They were all pretty well taught out for today. Winter was going to try them on Donny. \"Come on ,Winter.\",whispered Hazel in the background. First Donny and Winter both stared at each other blankly before Winter smacked Donny on the side. Donny chased Winter around at first. Hazel was about to have a panic attack, but, it turns out Donny and Winter were enjoying their game of tag. That made Hazel giggle in joy! Winter has tried again!

Hazel and I had a habit of meeting every Wednesday for a lunch in their old hangout. \"Of course Sawyer!\" Hazel responded, blushing a little. I had asked her officially to be my girlfriend two weeks ago. And Hazel was still not use to this label, even though it was something that she had wanted since they had first met. My head peered over the edge of the crow's nest. \"What's for lunch today?\" I asked. \"I only had time to make ham and cheese sandwiches. I've been really busy with the new turtle.\" \"That sounds amazing!\" I smiled, sitting down next to her. \"I'm starving!\" As we sat down and enjoyed their sandwiches, I questioned Hazel about the new turtle that they had rescued the afternoon before. \"I named her Serendipity. She's a really old turtle. It's so sad but she just got stuck in a fisherman's net and is pretty cut up.\" She explained all the injuries and rehab that the turtle had to have. I wasn't really listening though. I was just thinking about how pretty she was when she talking about new animal. After an hour of talking about Serendipity, Hazel and I parted ways and returned to the hospital. Hazel went back to the rehab pool with the turtle. I returned to the dolphin pools that housed the resident dolphins Winter and Hope. For hours I worked with Winter and Hope, trying out a new trick for the shows at the aquarium. \"How's Winter doing today?\" Clay asked as he walked into the arena. \"She's doing really well; I think she is going to need a new tail soon. The old one is getting pretty tight on her.\" \"Really? We only got her a new one like five months ago. Doctor McCarthy is not coming by for almost another month.\" \"I guess I can figure something out. She has been really active lately. Hope is such a great thing for Winter.\" \"I'm so glad that she is doing so well. You should head home soon. I don't want you to be late for dinner.\" \"I'll see you tomorrow Clay!\" I replied as I gathered all the training equipment around the tanks. Once that was done, I walked back to the employees' workroom and changed out of my wetsuit and into regular clothes. As I walked out to my car, I waved goodbye to Hazel and headed home for the night. When I arrived home, I noticed that Dr. Nathan Halliburton's car was parked in front of the house. Crap , I thought, I forgot that he was coming over for dinner tonight . I really like Dr. Halliburton, but it was definitely a little awkward for my mom to be dating again. \"Sawyer, you're late!\" my mom called from the kitchen. \"I'm sorry Mom! Let me take a quick shower and I'll be right down.\" \"Ok! But hurry! Your dinner is getting cold.\" I took a quick shower, trying to make myself smell a little less fishy, and went down to the kitchen. \"Hey, Dr. Halliburton.\" I said as I sat down at the table. \"Please, Sawyer. I told you to call me Nathan.\" \"Sorry. How was your day, Mom?\" Throughout dinner, we went around making small talk. Don't get me wrong. I really like Nathan, but it is just a little awkward still. I dismissed myself from the table as soon as I was done eating, saying that I had a lot of homework to do, which was not a lie. I hid in my room until ten o'clock when I heard the front door open and close, telling me that Nathan had finally left. After that, I went to bed, knowing that it was just me and my mom in the house, safe and sound.[Chapter 2] \"Sawyer! You're late!\" my mother called the next morning. I rolled over in my bed and pulled the blanket high over my head. I could be late to work today , I thought to myself. Except there was a big show today for local middle school. Clay would kill me if I was late. I flung the blankets off and jumped out of bed. I frantically ran around the house trying to find my Clearwater polo, finally finding it still damp in the washing machine. I throw it on and grabbed the whole box of cereal. I ran back upstairs and grabbed my backpack and my car keys, and then I finally ran out of the house, slamming the door behind me. \"Sorry I'm late, Clay.\" I called as I entered the Clearwater facility. \"It's fine, Sawyer. The students should be arriving in about thirty minutes,\" he replied. \"Go and get Winter and Hope ready for the big show!\" I quickly changed into my wetsuit and headed down to the dolphin arena. I spotted a man sitting on the bleachers of the show arena. \"Excuse me,\" I said politely. \"No one is allowed to be down here until the show at ten o'clock.\" \"I'm sorry,\" the man replied. \"I'll go. I just wanted to get a look at the dolphins. I have a personally connection to one of them.\" \"It's fine. These dolphins are really special to a lot of people. That is why we ask for the dolphins to have a little privacy, or there would be people down here all the time.\" \"You know, my son was one the people who rescued the injured one.\" \"You mean Winter? The one with the prostatic tail?\" He nodded in agreement. \"What's your son's name? Maybe I know him.\" \"His name is Sawyer.\" I stood there shocked, unsure of what to say next. My father was sitting right in front of me. For years, this is what I had wanted, to see him again, to talk to him again. He had walked out on my mother when I was seven and I had never forgiven him for that. \"Right, Sawyer. Today is his day off.\" I said unconvincingly. \"Maybe try again tomorrow?\" \"Thanks for your help. I'll do that. And if you see him, will you tell him I was here? My name is Mark.\" \"Uhhh…Yeah, sure,\" I responded quickly. I watched him walk off, still dazed from the conversation I had just had. I heard Winter clicking for the fish I had in the bucket in my hand, bringing me out of my trance. So I went back to work, trying to forget that man, my father. I fed Winter and Hope, while also practicing some of the tricks for the show. Soon, I heard children screaming and running around the rest of the aquarium. I quickly wrapped up what I was doing and went to find Hazel. I found her at the turtle pond, helping some girls fed worms to turtles. \"Sawyer!\" Hazel exclaimed, as she saw me approaching. \"Good morning, Hazel!\" I called back. Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a glimpse of Mark. \"Hazel, can I talk to you in private?\" I asked quickly. \"Sure, I'll be right back girls.\" Hazel walked over to me, grabbing my hand as we walked back towards the dolphin pools. \"What's up?\" she asked with concern in her voice. \"There was a man here earlier today. He said his name was Mark. He said he was my dad.\" I explained, looking to her for support. I went on explaining all that had happened. \"Well, did you tell him who you are?\" she asked. \"No. I told him that it was my day off.\" I explained. \"I don't think that he believed me. I think he knows I lied to him. I'm kinda freaking out!\" \"Well, let's go tell Clay and we all can keep an eye out for him.\" We walked around the aquarium, hand in hand, and finally found Clay talking with one of the teachers. \"Dad?\" Hazel asked. \"Could we talk to you really quickly?\" \"Sure, Hazel. What's ups?\" Clay asked us, looking on with concern. I took a deep breath and again explained to Clay what had happened this morning. \"Have you talk to your mom?\" Clay asked when I was finished. \"No, I didn't want to worry her. She has a big day at work.\" \"Ok. Well, I will keep an eye of this guy. Try not to think about it, okay? It's almost time for the dolphin show. You better go get ready!\" \"Thanks, Clay.\" As he walked away, Hazel looked at me with those big brown eyes. \"I'll be alright. Let's go see Winter and Hope!\" I said, walking in the direction of the dolphins.[Chapter 3] \"Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the Clearwater Aquarium and Rescue Center!\" Hazel's voice boomed around the arena, starting out the show. \"I would like to introduce you to two of my best friends, Winter and Hope.\" I released the dolphins to swim around the pool, entertaining the crowd. I scanned the crowd, not being able to spot the man who claimed to be my father. I didn't see him. \"I would also like to introduce to you another one of my best friend and their trainer, Sawyer.\" The crowd clapped as the dolphins returned to me for a treat. The show went smoothly; Winter and Hope were thankfully being corporative, which was a relief after the strange morning. Hazel entertained the crowd with interesting facts about the dolphins and how the Clearwater Rescue Center had saved their lives. She's so cute when she talks about the dolphins , I thought to myself. I again scanned the crowd. This time is spotted the familiar face of the man from this morning. He wasn't watching the show; he was staring straight at me glaringly. Thankfully, the show was almost over. I quickly finished the show and ran out the arena and into the employee's locker room. I could hear Hazel trying to cover for me rapid retreat. A few minutes later, Hazel came running into the locker room. \"Sawyer, are you okay?\" she said comfortingly. \"He was there, staring at me the whole time, Hazel!\" I said, trying to keep calm and from tears. \"Oh my gosh. You should have told me.\" \"And you would have done what? I'm sure he already knows who I am.\" I exclaimed. \"You should go. You have things to do with Clay. I just want to wait until the crowd has cleared out and then I will go take care of Winter and Hope.\" \"Okay. Clay will understand if you want me to stay with you.\" \"It's ok. I'll be out in a few minutes.\" She stayed a few minutes, hugging me the whole time. Slowly she got up and left. I knew she was concerned, but I just wanted to be alone. After several minutes, I again took a deep breath and walked back to the dolphin pool, making sure that I was indeed alone. \"Hey Winter. Hey Hope. Sorry I left before I could reward both of you for such a grand show.\" I said as I throw both of them several fish. I went about my day, working with Winter and Hope. Around four o'clock Hazel joined me and we went for a long swim with the dolphins. After we had talked about our days for a while, Hazel went back to the locker room to change into dry clothes. I was picking up the toys around the tank, when I heard footsteps approaching. I turned around to be face-to-face with my father. He swayed as he walked and I could smell the alcohol on his breath. He was drunk. \"You little liar!\" he screamed at me. \"You're just like your mother!\" He slapped me across the face. I didn't know what to do or what to say. I tried to turn around, to run away, but he grabbed me arm and held me tightly to my spot. \"You should be happy to see your old man again. I mean, I'm practically the one who raised you. That is before your slut of a mother kicked me out.\" \"Get away from me!\" I yelled, trying to struggle away from his firm grip. This was not the man who I remembered. \"Help! Someone, please help me! Hazel! Clay!\" I yelled in vain. Mark stood there for several moments in silence, listening intently for footsteps. \"No one's coming, son,\" he cackled. \"I know who you were from the moment I saw you. I can't believe how much you have grown. How old are you now?\" \"Seventeen,\" I said defiantly. \"Seventeen. I remember when I was seventeen. Good times, good times. Now, come on. You're coming home with your pops.\" He pulled me close, embracing me. I'm going to pass out from the stench of alcohol , I thought. I felt his hold loosen slightly as we moved. I made my escape. I ran from him, but I didn't get very far. He was faster than me, even when drunk. \"Come back here!\" he screamed. I felt I pull on my neck as he wrenched me around to face him. Immediately, his fist made contact with my face. I felt myself falling backwards, realizing that I was now standing on the edge of the dolphin tank. I felt myself hit the water, as my leg made contact with the wall edge. I felt a blinding pain radiate from my leg. And then everything went black.[Chapter 4] As I changed into dry clothes, I listened my favorite song Shield by Cozi Zuehlsdorff. I loved her music, and after a long day at the aquarium, I needed some time to myself. I took my time, getting my hair to look really nice and making sure my eyeliner looked equally as good. I wanted to impress Sawyer. I finally finished, wondering if Sawyer was finished yet. I took my earbuds out and listened for any noises in the boy's side of the locker room. All I could hear was Winter and Hope clicking, calling for something. I quickly gathered my belongings into my backpack and walked over to see the dolphins. I saw Winter splashing around violently in the pool and Hope was trying to push something onto the platform. As I got closer, I saw that Hope was pushing a body onto the platform. \"Sawyer!\" I screamed, sprinting full speed towards him. I pulled him onto the platform, checking for a pulse and breathing. Good, he's still breathing . I quickly take notice of the bruises already forming around his right eye and his cheeks. \"Dad! Dad! Someone help!\" I cried desperately into the air. I cried out louder and louder. I searched in vain for my phone, but I accidently left it in the locker rooms. I just sat there, crying over Sawyer's unconscious body. Finally, I heard footsteps running down the hall. \"Hazel!\" my dad called, scanning the area for me. When his eyes found Sawyer and I, he accidently stopped and ran to the nearest phone. \"Is he breathing?\" he called across the deck. \"Yeah!\" I yelled back. \"He looks like he was beat up. And I think his ankle is broken.\" I noticed that his ankle was bent at an odd ankle and swelling up quickly. \"The ambulance is coming.\" Clay called as he walked in our direction. When he reached us, he bent over Sawyer's body and I could tell he was about to cry. \"Who would do something like this?\" \"I don't know, Dad,\" I replied, as Sawyer started to stir. His eyes slid open as I grabbed his hand. \"Stay still, Sawyer. Help is on the way.\" All he did was nod his head in agreement, but I could see the pain in his eyes. \"It was my dad,\" he said hoarsely after a few moments. I looked at him startled. \"It was my dad,\" he repeated. \"He was drunk and angry that I didn't tell him the truth. I tried to grab me.\" Tears were streaming out of his eyes and down his bruised cheeks. I heard the wail of the ambulance was it approached the aquarium. \"It's going to be ok, Sawyer,\" I said, trying to comfort him, but more than that, trying to comfort myself. I watched as the paramedics hurried in, getting him onto the stretcher, and took him away from me.[Chapter 5] I don't really remember the next couple of hours. I was too groggy from the morphine. When I came out of my haze, I immediately saw my left leg was encased in a large white cast. My mom was sitting next to me, holding my hand, Hazel was sitting across the room, looking at her phone, and I could hear Clay on the phone in the hallway. \"Mom?\" I asked hoarsely. Her head turned slowly as I saw her put on a fake smile. \"Hey, baby. How are you feeling?\" \"Could I have some water?\" \"Sure, honey.\" She looked up as Hazel handed me a cup of water. I reached up, grabbing the cup, and drank only a sip before I started to cough. \"Is your throat sore?\" my mom asked compassionately. \"Yeah,\" I said through my fit of coughing. \"A little.\" My mother brushed my hair out of the eyes, as Hazel looked at me with compassionate eyes. My mom spoke up, saying \"The doctor said that would be normal. From the salt water at the aquarium.\" She hesitated for a moment, before asking if I remembered what happened. I nodded, tears rushing to my eyes as images of this drunk man. \"It was him,\" I creaked out. Hazel recounted the events that had taken place during that morning. I, then, tried to compose myself and recounted the accident. My mother was in tears by the time that I finished. \"Well, Clay has been on the phone with the police for a while now. They are looking for him, but they are going to have to talk to you.\" \"Later,\" Dr. Halliburton said as he walked into the room. \"You're a lucky boy, son.\" He continued to talk about my injuries, a concussion, a bruised face and ribs, and, most serious, a broken leg. \"The tibia is fractured in two places. You'll have to be on crutches for six to eight weeks. You can leave in a couple of hours, but you need to rest now.\" \"Thank you Nathan,\" my mother replied. She got up and walked out of the room with him, talking more about how to care for me in the coming weeks. \"You okay?\" I asked Hazel, as she stared at me across the room. \"Why are you asking me? You're the one with the broken leg.\" \"You just seem really distant.\" \"I, I'm fine,\" she said unconvincingly. I could tell something was wrong, but I didn't have the energy to keep prying. \"Go to sleep, Sawyer,\" she continued. I had no argument with that as I shifted my body to the most comfortable position I could find in this really uncomfortable hospital bed. When I reawakened, I looked around the room to see that there was no one there. I could hear Clay on the phone in the hall. \"What do you mean that he hasn't been seen?\" Clay said angrily. \"He attacked a boy. He almost killed him!\" I felt tears gather in my eyes as I realized that he was talking to the police. I tried to sit up, but in the process, I shifted my leg wrong and I cried out in pain. I heard footsteps walking very quickly toward the room. Clay appeared in the doorway. \"Are you okay, Sawyer?\" \"Yeah. I'm fine. I just shifted my leg in the wrong direction.\" \"Does it hurt? Are you in a lot of pain? Should I get the doctor?\" \"Clay! I'm fine. I just want to get out of here.\" Right on cue, Dr. Halliburton and my mom walked into the room, with Hazel following close behind. My mom was carrying a large paper bag, presumably my medication, while Nathan was carrying a pair of crutches. \"Time to go home, Sawyer. Your mom has already sign you out.\" He headed me the crutches, helping me out of the bed. \"You need to rest; you have a fairly bad concussion.\" As we walked, or hobbled, towards the doors, Clay reported his conversations with the police. \"The police said that you will need to come over to the station tomorrow to give your report.\" The drive home was a quiet one. I noticed that my mom took great care to avoid the bumps and potholes in the road, worrying that it would hurt me. As we pulled up to the house, my mom finally broke the silence. \"I'm so glad you're ok, Sawyer. You really scared me today. And Hazel.\" I know, Mom , I thought. I know .[Chapter 6] \"So, can you tell me exactly what happened?\" the police officer injured the next morning. I repeated the story, reliving the events for like the hundredth time today. I hadn't really slept last night, partly from the pain of my broken leg, and partly from the nightmares of the day. To make it all worse, the police officer just stared at me, not appearing to have any sympathy. \"Thank you,\" he said gruffly as I finished talking. \"I would like to tell you that we arrested Mr. Nelson last night for driving under the influence. He is one of our cells right now.\" I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders, and I could see the relief in my mother's eyes from across the room. \"We are going to hold him until we can get to the bottom of this. I don't want you or your mother to worry about him at all.\" \"Thank you, officer,\" my mother said as she quickly walked over to us. \"Well, you are free to go, Sawyer. We will contact you if we have any more questions.\" \"Thanks,\" I said, as I struggled to stand up. I was so ready to leave the police station, to leave the nightmare of the past 24 hours behind too. But I had a nagging suspicion that this would not be that simple.

Hazel stood on her tippy toes and added a last red streamer to the wall, as a decoration. Hazel sighed of relief after she finished. She was proud of her work of the party. She did it all by herself. Hazel missed Sawyer, even though it was just three months, and they texted often. Hazel daydreamed about Sawyer seeing Winter and Hope again, smiling to them. Snap out of it!

His mom rushed out of the car, not bothering to close the car door, and ran up to him and hugged him hard. \"I missed you Sawyer! So much! Lorraine cried out. \"I missed you Mom, too. It was only three months, by the way, Mom.\" His mom let go of the hug, \"You've grown so big.\" Sawyer smiled. 'Well an inch technically.\" Sawyer chuckled. Lorraine laughs slightly. \"Come on, let's go to a restaurant, and I'll treat you. Sawyer just nodded. Sawyer went up to the car and sat in the car sea. Just as he was about to close the car door, his mom got a ring in her phone, which made her jump. \"Oh…\" Lorraine said. She apparently got a text from Hazel now, which said: Hazel: hey Lorraine, picked up Sawyer? Lorraine: Yeah, what about the party? Set it up yet? Hazel: Yay! And yes I did. You guys can come now. Lorraine: Sure, be over soon. Sawyer's mom clicked her phone off. That's strange. His mom never texted. Maybe he missed so much things. He slid the car door shut, and his mom climbed into the car. \"Where are we going?\" Sawyer asked. 'You'll see.\" His mom slyly smiled. Sawyer smiles suspiciously. \"Okay.\" … Sawyer's mom stops at a building, which color gives off a soft glow of light yellow. The building doesn't seem to be a restaurant. \"Mom, I don't think this is not a restaurant.\" Sawyer tells her suspiciously. \"Honey, I know where I am.\" Lorraine tries not to smile. Sawyer looks at her in amusement. Lorraine opens the door and surprise! Sawyer is stunned by the lights, and the image of the party. Even Kyle is there, smiling back at Sawyer. , smiling and smirking like he does, and Hazel! Sawyer's eyes locked on Hazel's brown ones. Hazel smiles. Sawyer runs toward her, giving her a hard and squeezing hug. Hazel's POV: He hugged me! He hugged me! Sure it's silly, but he hugged me! Hazel blushes, and her cheeks turn a soft pink. Sawyer lets go of their hug, and smiles sweetly to Hazel. Sweetly? Stop it Hazel! Hazel stares at Sawyer. He looks quite different. … After the party, which lasted only to ten. Yeah, a short time for a party to end. Hazel and Sawyer walked back to Clearwater, as well as Clay. Hazel watched Sawyer as he sat down on the concreate floor. … END! Anyway, I hope you enjoyed it! I hope it wasn't too short, chapter 2 is going to be quite long I think. Thanks for reading! Please leave a review! -Hope4Winter[Chapter 2] Author's note: HELLO! I'm back with a new chapter! :) And sorry if chapter 1 was short, but I'll make chapter 2 a bit longer. Also, of there is grammar mistakes, please tell me! I hate grammar mistakes - Found three in chapter one ): My writing are not that great, please do not mind that! Anyway hope you enjoy! :) I like the Winter and Sawyer cuteness in this chapter :P Please leave a review! :) Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2! Chapter two: Very bad news Hazel's POV: Hazel watched Sawyer as he sat down on the concreate floor. Sawyer called out for Winter, using his tweety-bird whistle. \"Winter…\" Sawyer says softly. Winter immediately pops out of the water, making a small splash, and greets him by bumping his hand softly with her rostrum. Sawyer smiles at Winter. A smile too cute. Stop it Hazel! Stop saying that! We're not like that! Hazel stands up, breathes air deeply, and walks toward Sawyer. She just nervous talking to Sawyer. She's nervous talking to Sawyer about bad news. Really? Sawyer smiles at Winter again, \"I missed you so much Winter.\" Sawyer says softly. Hazel sits down next to him on the floor. Winter squeals softly. He doesn't know. \"Hey.\" Sawyer greets Hazel. \"Hey and I just want to tell you some news and updates about Winter's condition.\" Hazel says sadly. I told him, no backing now. \"What type of news?\" Sawyer asked curiously. \"Um…\" Hazel bit her lip. \"Um, what?\" \"Bad.\" \"Why bad?\" The brown haired boy asked her, and looked at her. Hazel blushed. Don't do that in front of him! That's stupid! 'Uh, yeah. It's bad. Winter seems okay now, but she was refusing some of her buckets earlier. She even threw up, and of course that usually never happens to a dolphin, even Hope whines a lot. She comes to me, and whines. She swims around Winter's gate, every day.\" Hazel said sadly. Sawyer's face dropped. \"Winter did that when Panama was like that too. Either that means Winter is dying or possibly be sick. Did you tell Clay?\" Sawyer asked anxiously and. \"Ye…yeah I told my dad. He said he'll run some tests later on Winter.\" Hazel stuttered. \"I'll go gate her then.\" Sawyer tells Hazel, and Hazel just nods. Hazel watches Sawyer walk away. After he changed, he comes out in his wetsuit. Sawyer's POV: After he changes, Sawyer steps and goes in the water, slightly cold in the main pool. He dips his head underwater, and swims to get Winter. Sawyer floated up, his hair wet and soaking. Winter floats there peacefully in the water, floating vertically. Winter blew her blowhole. Sawyer thought it was strange for Winter to be doing that, or seems she is sleeping vertically up… Winter's tail stub swishes in the water swiftly. Sawyer notices Hazel staring at him, she blushes bright pink and looks away. Sawyer smiles at her blushed face. That's cute. No, wait, he's just friends! Sawyer wanted to slap himself, but he didn't. He turned to Winter, \"Hey Winter, let's get you gated. You need rest, don't you?\" Sawyer said softly to Winter. Winter just tweeted back weakly. Just as Sawyer put his hand on Winter's dorsal fin, Winter's eyes droop a little. \"Wint-!\" Sawyer says but gets interrupted. Winter starts to sink, and starts going underwater. Hazel gasps, \"Sawyer! Winter!\" Hazel gets up and runs panicking to her dad's office. Sawyer goes underwater, surrounded by bubbles. Sawyer attempts to drag Winter back up, but it's impossible to lift Winter back up since she is quite a couple of hundred pounds. Sawyer could hear two pairs of running feet, \"Dad…! Dad! Sawyer got dragged down with Winter, and Winter isn't swimming or floating! There both going to drown!\" Hazel says too fast, but Clay catches it. \"Okay Hazel, calm down. You do know Winter can breathe underwater, right?\" Hazel blushes and her breath stops pacing. \"Sorry, I was in a rush and panicking. But what about Sawyer?!\" Clay rolls his eyes. \"Get the blue mat please, Hazel!\" Clay commanded her. Hazel ran to the shelf, even though it was just behind her. She tossed Winter's favorite blue mat to her father. Clay catches it and gets a grip on the blue mat. \"Phoebe! Hurry please!\" Clay shouted. In a split second, the dark haired woman appeared. \"Get Sawyer please, I got to get the nets and divers.\" Clay told her. Phoebe nodded and obeyed. Hazel taps her fingers repetitively on the wall. Phoebe dives in the water, swims toward Sawyer and Hazel. She sees Sawyer, he looked like he needed air, and was struggling to pull Winter back up. She shoves a floating tube in Sawyer's hand. Sawyer didn't want to leave Winter, even though he was running out of breath and the water pressure was on him. I don't want to leave Winter to die! Phoebe pulled him away from Winter, and Sawyer yells something but it's barely audible in the water. Once they reached the surface, Phoebe breathed for air and brought Sawyer on the concreate floor. Sawyer stayed on the floor, coughing out the water he exhaled. Hazel crouches down and puts her hand on his back, \"You okay?\" Hazel asked. Sawyer got up and sat down. \"Yeah I'm fine. What about Winter, Phoebe? Don't leave her to die!\" Sawyer snapped. Sawyer stood up. Phoebe sighed. \"She's going to be alright, Sawyer. They're going to get her. Clay said he wants to talk to both of you in his office.\" CLIFFHANGER! Sorry if this one is short, if you wanted it to be longer, leave a suggestion! Please leave a review! (: Anyway I hoped you enjoyed and yes it is possible for a dolphin to drown and become sick, by the way ;) And if you're asking why Sawyer didn't want to leave Winter down in the pool, why would he? :) -Hope4Winter[Chapter 3] Author's note: YESSSSSS! A new chapter! :) This one would probably be longer, and yes I found another mistake in chapter 2, which is not good _ I do like the Hazel and Sawyer cuteness in this chapter :P But I'm not sure about the whole thing…and please bear with my terrible writing skills! Enjoy! :) Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2! Chapter three: The talk of Winter Hazel's POV: A talk between us? Is it about me liking Sawyer…? No, that's silly. I think. She followed her dad into his office, along with Sawyer. Sawyer had a towel around him, and he was dripping wet. Her father sat down in his usual old chair. Hazel's heart skipped a beat. What does her father want to talk about? They already knew that Winter's sick… \"You both do know that Winter is very sick but…\" Clay trailed off. \"What is it?\" Hazel asked, possibly a little demanding. \"Dolphins this sick as Winter…don't make it.\" Clay said and sighed. Hazel's jaw dropped and so did Sawyer's. No! I didn't want this! \"But, isn't it possible to make Winter better?\" Sawyer asked and his voice was cracking. \"We are keeping a twenty-four hour watch, were increasing checkups and giving her medicines. That's all we could do, Hazel.\" Hazel fights her tears back. \"Well, Dad I'll be on the ten to twelve watch, then.\" Hazel said sternly, she was rushing to leave. I can't cry here. \"Sure.\" Clay said with a sigh. Hazel opened the door, and left. \"Is it still okay to see Winter, Clay?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yeah.\" … Hazel sat on the floor next to Hope's pool, and half crying. Just as Sawyer came out to see Winter, Hazel removes her leather sandals and places them aside. She dips her toes slightly in the water. Hope pops out of the water, and bumps Hazel's toes with her rostrum. Hope always cheers me up. Hazel wipes a tear away with the back of her hand, and smiles at Hope. Hope whistles. \" Now, science doesn't know whether dolphins feel emotion the way we do- fear, joy, sadness. But their brains are complex as ours.\" Sawyer's POV: Sawyer sat down next to Winter's pool. Sawyer observed Winter, and Winter was resting on her favorite blue mat. Her eyes looked quite tired, and so were Sawyer's. Sawyer removed his soaking wet towel from his body, and places it on the floor next to him. \"Hey Winter.\" Winter shifted her head from her mat to look at Sawyer. She eyed him. She knows I'm here. \"You okay?\" Sawyer asked her calmly. Winter tweeted him back softly. \"Winter, I have to go, okay? I'll see you later.\" Winter tweeted in response again. Sawyer smiles and turns toward Hazel's way. \"Bye Hazel! I have to go home, tell Hope bye! \"Sawyer yelled to Hazel. This caught Hazel's attention. \"Okay! Bye Sawyer!\" Hazel shouted back. Sawyer smiled at Hazel and slightly blushed, and left CMA. … Sawyer went home, opened the front door, and peeked in and turned on the lights to make his presence home. The lights gave off a soft white orange glow in the house. His mom told him she had the late shift today. Always the late shift on Saturday. Sawyer climbed into bed, but he wasn't sleeping. He couldn't sleep, all he could think about is Winter. Winter. Winter, and Winter. It was 11:30, and Sawyer still wasn't asleep. He wished he knew what and why Winter was sick. Out of the blue, she became sick. Just like Clay said, Winter is most likely not to make it. Especially this sick. Maybe there is a cure, just maybe. A light appeared in Sawyer's bedroom, it seeming a soft blue white glow. What's that? He realizes it was his phone, and someone had texted him, and it was 11:43pm! It was Hazel, along with her late night shift to watch Winter. The text read: Hazel: I have bad news. Sawyer replied, Sawyer: What is it? Something happened with Winter? Hazel replied a little later, Hazel: Winter…, has a disease. Sawyer's face dropped. He wanted to drop his phone, but he did not. Sawyer: Sorry Hazel, but, is it okay to come? Hazel: … Hazel: Sure. Sawyer: See you. … Sawyer biked as fast as he could, when it was 11:50pm. Once he passed the sign that read Clearwater Marine Aquarium this way , he set his bike aside, and letting it fall. Rushed as he is, he burst through the employee entrance in the back. Hazel never locks it. He ran through the Great hall, and ran up the upper deck. The upper deck creaked a little. He ran to Winter's area, and the pools were shimmering against the moon lights. He looked for Hazel, probably by Hope's pool, until he heard crying. It was Hazel, sitting in a corner, and her face in her hands, and her blond hair seemed quite messy. \"Hazel! Are you okay?\" Sawyer asked worryingly. Hazel removed her face from her face, and looked up at Sawyer. \"No! Winter is sick! Her sickness is unknown, and we are all confused.\" Hazel said, and her blond curls fell on her face. Sawyer sat next to her. \"Hazel, it's unknown?\" Sawyer asked. No, that can't be, right? \"I'm so sorry Sawyer, it is.\" Hazel says sadness in her voice. \"Is there even medicine that could help?\" Sawyer asked, looking for more options. Hazel turned her head to Sawyer, \"I have feed Winter something like medicine before.\" Sawyer smiled, and then Hazel blushed bright red. That's perfect. END OF CHAPTER! :) Okay, anyway I hope you enjoyed chapter 3! :3 If you noticed, I do switch point of views often, so I hope that's fine. Please leave a review! :D I think Chapter 4 is going to be long :o -Hope4Winter[Chapter 4] Author's note: YAY! Chapter 4! (Like anyone is that excited!) Anyway, this one should be extra-long :P Sorry if I have terrible writing skills by the way! And please leave a review! :) I personally like the beginning part of this ;) Enjoy! :) Sawyer's POV: Sawyer woke up early to check on Winter, and it was seven. Well, not that early. The ground felt cold, and he saw Kat trying to feed Winter, who refused by swishing it away. Kat sighed, \"Can't you just eat something, Winter?\" Sawyer saw Winter was resting on her favorite blue mat, again. Winter tweeted in of Sawyer's presence. Kat looked up, \"Oh hey Sawyer, could you feed Hope for me? I'm trying to feed Winter, but she isn't budging.\" Sawyer smiled, \"Sure.\" Sawyer grabbed a bucket of fish, but heavy at the same time. Although he did not mind the smell of the fish. He plopped the bucket of fish next to Hope's pool, and Hope pops out of the water, like a surprise. Hope whines and points her rostrum toward Winter's pool, and wails. \"I know Hope, you can't play with Winter today.\" Sawyer spoke gently to Hope. Then, Hope stuck her rostrum toward a different way. \"Hope, I already told you, you can't play with Winter.\" What is she doing? Hope splashed Sawyer in the face. Sawyer wiped the water off his face. \"Hey!\" Sawyer meant to sound angry, but he couldn't be angry at Hope. Hope pointed her rostrum toward the same way again. \"Hope, I already told you, there's nothing there.\" Sawyer said, and sighed in between. Sawyer looked the way where Hope was pointing to. He realized it was Hazel. Hazel was leaning against the wall, sitting on the floor. She was asleep, and a plaid red blanket was covering her body. She looked peaceful. Her eyes were closed, and her eyelashes peeked out. She smiled in her in her sleep. Kat looked at both of them, and smirked to herself. \"What?!\" Sawyer asked her, defensively. \"Nothing.\" Kat says with a quiet giggle. Why was everyone like that? Hazel must have fell asleep on her shift, next to the pool. I could wake up Hazel myself. \"Hazel! Wake up…!\" Sawyer shouted in Hazel's ear. Hazel jumped and opened her eyelids. \"Oh! Sawyer! Don't wake me up like tha-!\" Hazel says, in a instant she gets splashed by water! She wiped her face, \"Hey! Sawyer!\" Hazel said, trying to sound angry, but started to laugh. \"I didn't do it! It was Hope!\" Sawyer told her and put his hands up, in surrender. Hope opened her mouth and squealed in delight and lifted her tail up. Hazel smiles at Hope and Sawyer. \"You guys are cute.\" Kat mumbles, quietly. Hazel gives her a dirty look, \"What? What was that?\" Kat smiles, \"Nothing.\" \"Kat?\" \"Yeah?\" \"You were on shift?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Oops, I think I fell asleep too much.\" Hazel giggles. \"It's fine Hazel, Rebecca took on one of the shifts. Plus, who would carry you back to your house?\" Kat says with a laugh. Hazel laughs along with her, and turned her eyes to Sawyer and Hope. The two were having a water war, and Sawyer splashed at Hope, which made Hope make a bigger splash and causing Hazel to crack up. \"You winning and I'm blind!\" Sawyer said laughing. While Hope was splashing Sawyer lightly, \"Hey Hazel, pull out your hand.\" Hazel looked at him with amusement. \"Why?\" The blonde asked. Sawyer grabbed her hand and pulled her in the pool. It made a splash, which rained on Hope. Hope tweeted happily. \"Hey! Stop getting me wet!: Hazel yelled, still smiling at the same time. … Sawyer and Hazel had to hold Winter later that day, while she rested on their arms. Winter's weak to support herself. They held Winter around and around the pool, hoping she move somehow. But there was no use, she never moved. Winter couldn't survive this, would she? Hazel stared at Sawyer, and he stared back, they had locked eyes for a moment. Winter's bright curious eyes woke up, and fluttered open. She started to wiggle in their hands, and Sawyer smiled. \"Winter!\" He cried happily. Hazel's smile spread. She was moving! Sawyer and Hazel were cleaning the main pool, scrubbing as hard as they can. Gripping the broom, he heard two shuffling feet. \"Clay, Winter is refusing the prosthetic.\" Phoebe said. It must be Phoebe and Clay. \"I know Phoebe, we have a x-ray later planned.\" Clay told her in hurry. Hazel glanced at Sawyer. \"She is?\" Sawyer asked out of the blue, which made Phoebe jump. \"Oh my god Sawyer! You scared me!\" Sawyer chuckled quietly, \"Well the cleaning should have gave you a clue.\" Clay gave Sawyer a look of amusement. \"Sawyer, Winter needs to get her prosthetic on, and vice versa, would you mind helping Phoebe on it?\" Clay asked Sawyer. \"Sure.\" Sawyer went down the white stepladder, careful each step. Winter on the platform, she looked up at Sawyer. Sawyer sat down next to Winter in the water. \"Hey Winter.\" Sawyer greeted softly. Winter tweeted. \"You doing okay?\" Sawyer asked Winter. Winter tweeted in response again. \"Okay then.\" Sawyer petted Winter with his hand gently. Winter made her tweety bird whistle, only harsher. \"Shh, it's okay.\" Sawyer told Winter reassuringly. \"She fine?\" Clay asked, careful not to scare Winter at the same time. \"Yeah.\" The chains of the stretcher pulled down, making a loud chinking sound. Winter flinched. … Sawyer sat in the lower deck, or the Great hall, and his mind was racing. What were Winter's results? He scanned the Great hall, and he saw Hazel sitting on the other side. Hazel was also waiting for the results. She tapped her foot lightly on the floor. Her blond curls feel in place, and her palms together. Sawyer stares at Hazel. Hazel turns her head to stare out at the distance in the hall. Hazel turned her head toward Sawyer and smiles. \"Race you to the crow's nest!\" hazel stood up and ran. Sawyer smiled and ran. \"No way!\" Once Sawyer reached the dock, he saw Hazel sitting in the crow's nest. Hazel smiled mockingly. \"I beat you!\" Hazel told Sawyer, dramatically pretending to be proud. Sawyer smiles and climbed up the crow's nest ladder and stood there on the crow's nest. Hazel stood up and leaned on the edge of the crow's nest. Hazel turned her head to Sawyer. \"I feel like we should be up here often.\" Hazel said peacefully. Hazel's blond waves blew calmly in the wind. Sawyer's heart was pounding. Stop! Were only friends, right? \"Yeah, sometimes I missed those times.\" Sawyer said, focusing on the aquarium from the view. \"What times?\" hazel asked questionably. \"The times we spent together.\" Sawyer told her, and Hazel slightly blushed. \" Crafted in a picture less frame.\" ENDDDDD OF CHAPTER! :O Anyway, hope you liked that chapter! :D Please leave a review or a suggestion! :) and yesss if you noticed I included a quote from Originals, which was Cozi's EP album. It came from the song, \"Turn the light on.\" Omg her songs are perf 3 You readers should listen to the album if you haven't! :D -Hope4Winter[Chapter 5] Author's note: CHAPTER FIVE?! Wow XD anyway, here's chapter five! :D This chapter I personally like too, and more Sawyer and Hazel! ;D Please leave a review! Enjoy! :) Hazel's POV: She tied her blond hair into pigtails, getting ready for her work today. She sighed. … Hazel entered the pool area, and she spotted Rebecca crouching down next to Winter. \"Good girl Winter!\" Rebecca said to Winter happily. What she's happy about? Rebecca was feeding Winter, and then Winter chewed it well. \"Rebecca! She's eating?\" Hazel asked delighted. Rebecca looked up and smiled at Hazel. \"Yeah, she just finished. She's doing better, Hazel. Let me get the medicine.\" Rebecca placed the feeding bucket aside, and she grabbed some medicine tubes. Hazel smirked, and she snuck two pieces of fish, and dropped them in Winter's mouth, and Winter chewed in happiness of food. Winter whistled in thanks of Hazel. Rebecca turned back to Hazel, and she was holding two medicine tubes. \"Now it's time for medicine, Winter.\" Rebecca said, sighing. \"She usually refuses medicine, but we have to try.\" Rebecca says tiredly. Hazel just nodded. Later that day, Hazel texted Sawyer. Hazel: Sawyer! I have great news! Sawyer replied a minute later. Sawyer: Well what is it? Hazel: Winter's doing better, she ate her 2pm bucket! I even snuck some fish to her and she ate it! Sawyer: … Sawyer: That's great! I hope the medicines are working well :) Hazel: Yeah, me too. Hazel sighed in relief and clicked her phone off. She turned it back on. Hazel: Wait, Sawyer. Sawyer: Yeah? Hazel: Have you ever felt like, you don't know the world at all? Sawyer: … Sawyer: Yeah, most of the time. Hazel: I was wondering if we could meet up at the beach for a walk? I would love to discuss about Winter's improvement :) Sawyer: Ha-ha, sure why not? Meet you :) Hazel: Meet you at the beach ;) … Hazel walked on the warm sand, and filling the surface of her leather sandals with it. She looked down at her toes. She felt like a cat, discovering new places and things inside a home. Hazel looked up and saw Sawyer smiling mockingly. Oops. Hazel blushed a bright pink. Sawyer started to walk, and Hazel trailed him. \"So I also have some other good news about Winter, I guess.\" Hazel said awkwardly. \"Really?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yeah, she's moving off her mat sometimes, but she's still sick, which is unfortunate.\" Hazel continued. Some random group of guys Hazel was about to pass by, they were looking at her strangely. They smirked at Hazel. I hate that. Am I a stranger to the public? Hazel glares an angry look and whips her face away from them. She shuffled up a bit faster so she was next to Sawyer. … Sawyer's POV: Sawyer sighed as he closes his locker door. He had high school this week. Too bad it wasn't the weekend. Sawyer hated school, as much everyone did. Just as he was about to leave his locker, someone's locker opened in front of him. On purpose. It must be the 'famous' jerk Mike Blacksmith. Mike smirked as he closed his locker. Mike had a short hair haircut, dark hair, and green eyes that seems to crush people. \"Hey, Mr. Dolphin, having a great day?\" Mike asked in a high, phony voice. Sawyer rolled his eyes at Mike. Mike despised Sawyer, and Sawyer despised him. \"Well, I having a great day till you showed up, by the way, my name is Sawyer.\" Sawyer said in a bitter tone, and just as he was about to walk away, Mike hesitated for a moment, and slapped Sawyer across the face. Ouch, that hurt my sanity. Sawyer turned toward Mike. Everyone turned around and stopped to stare at them. \"Stop it! Sawyer!\" Someone yelled down the hall as the voice got closer. The voice sounded like Hazel's… what was she doing here? Hazel arrives at the scene right in between Mike and Sawyer. \"You alright?\" Hazel asked Sawyer, noticing his cheek getting red. Sawyer nodded. \"What's with the bursting in my school, Hazel?\" Sawyer asked the blonde freckled girl. \"We picked up a call about a dolphin stranding, and Phoebe said she'll call me in a bit. Go to the office so you can excused.\" Hazel said in a bit of a rush, and she picked up her phone and placed it to her ear. As she was on the phone, waiting for Phoebe, and glared at Mike. Mike smirked. \"Phoebe, what is it? A juvenile male? And two dolphin stranding's?! Both male? Okay.\" Hazel put down her phone. \"Two males, Sawyer. Let's go.\" Sawyer nodded and Hazel pushed out of the crowd, and Hazel muttered 'excuse me' as she passed by. Kyle gripped the truck's wheel, and Sawyer sat in the passenger seat. Everyone was in the back, prepared for the dolphins. They had two this time. Sawyer held his breath as they reached a very covered seaweed rocky beach. Sawyer immediately got out of the truck, while everyone jumped out of the truck in the back. The two stranded dolphins sat in the beach, tangled in the seaweed, whistling and tweeting as loud as they can. Hazel pointed out, \"Phoebe! There tangled in the seaweed!\" Phoebe looked in Hazel's direction, and nodding. Everyone ran in the water, holding the stretchers. The water slowed them down, and they started to untangle the seaweed from the dolphins, while the two dolphins flailed and attempted to wiggle out of the seaweed themselves. \"Get the dolphin on!\" Clay commanded. Kat, Hazel, Sawyer, Kyle, and Phoebe pushes one of the dolphins on a stretcher. They all lifted the stretcher, and Sawyer looked at Kyle. Kyle's much stronger than before, like he ever needed a brace to help him walk. Sawyer gripped on the stretcher as hard as he could. This dolphin feels like three hundred pounds! \"Phoebe, put the solution on!\" Clay yelled to Phoebe. \"Yeah!\" Phoebe yelled back in response. The four placed the stretcher down, and removed the stretcher from the dolphin. Phoebe grabbed some solution for the dolphin's skin, and opened the lid, which simply popped off. She grabbed a fair amount of the solution cream, and spread it on the dolphin's sunburn. The dolphin tweeted loudly. \"Go help Clay!\" Phoebe told the three. Sawyer and Hazel nodded. … END OF CHAPTER! And yesssss there's a rescue! :) The ending well, I'm not so sure about it. Anyway hoped you enjoyed!

(: I would love to hear reviews, and anything I should add or change! Now read on! Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale or Dolphin Tale 2. Chapter 1: Sawyer's back Sawyer thanks the taxi driver, and grabs his things. Finally home , he thinks. Sawyer walks up to his house, and sees his mom right out on the doorstep, smiling and almost crying at the same time. Sawyer runs up to her, and hugs her tightly. \"I missed you so much, Sawyer! I was really worried you'd get eaten by a shark!\" Okay, Sawyer loved his mom, but she was being a little unrealistic. \"Don't worry, Mom.\" Sawyer mumbled calmly. \"But what are we waiting for? Let's head to the aquarium!\" Sawyer says loudly, the excitement growing in his voice. His mom smiles and tells him, \"Okay then, let's go!\" Sawyer's mom runs after him into the car, and seeing him already buckled up, and bouncing up and down, she smiled even more. The car slowed down to the parking lot of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Sawyer quickly unbuckled his seatbelt, and stormed out of the car, not bothering to wait for his mother. Sawyer kept smiling, and went through the employee's back door. Oh Hazel, you never lock this door , he thinks to himself. Sawyer got the door to open, and pushed them inward. Blue appears everywhere, and he smiles. Everything looks the same, except for this tiny expansion in construction, by the back. Sawyer saw everything, the tide pool, the turtles, shark, and- the dolphins! A dolphin had swam by, and Sawyer could barely keep his excitement. Sawyer then ran up the stairs, seeing Winter and Hope's tank nearby. He hadn't seen or Hazel yet, which he felt a little disappointed. But he did see Kat, Phoebe, and many of the volunteers he had seen before. Everyone had started to spot him, and began saying, \"Welcome back!\" or, \"We missed you Sawyer!\" Sawyer threw his backpack to the side, and walks up to the dolphin tank. Phoebe walks up next to him and smiles, \"Winter!\" Winter immediately swims to the surface, and tweets the tweety Bird. Phoebe continues to talk to Winter by saying, \"Look who's back, Winter!\" Phoebe points to Sawyer, and Winter squeaks. Winter then tweets loudly, very, very, and very loudly . Sawyer smiles, and pets her around her dorsal fin. \"You've never changed haven't you?\" he tells Winter. Sawyer accidently pets her dorsal fin, and Winter drags him into the water. Splash! Sawyer meant to sound annoyed but he wasn't and said, \"I didn't even change yet Winter!\" Winter only replies by splashing him in the face. Sawyer splashes back at Winter. They continue to have a water war, and then relax on Winter's favorite blue mat. Kat opens the gate from the smaller tank, and Hope swims out to play. Hope hadn't realized Sawyer was there, so Hope tossed the mat around. \"Hey!\" Sawyer yells. Sawyer had thought that was Winter at first, but Winter had thought it was Sawyer. Sawyer had seen Hope swim up to them and mumbles, \"It was you, huh?\" Hope squeaks, and so does Winter. Just like the old times , he thought. Sawyer keeps swimming with the two dolphins, even if it was already 30 minutes. He heard two pairs of feet which were running toward the tank. Sawyer thought it was Hazel, and he looked out of the tank. He was half-right, it was Hazel and , which is better because he can update him about the aquarium. \"Sawyer!\" they yell in unison. Sawyer waves at them frantically as if to say, I'm right over here! Hazel beats her father, and runs to the edge of the tank. Sawyer swims closer to the edge. Hazel says excitedly, \"I can't believe your back, Sawyer! But how come I wasn't invited to swim with Hope and Winter?\" At the end of the sentence Hazel tries to sound hurt, but she keeps smiling. Sawyer laughs a little himself and tells Hazel,\" I missed you Hazel! Practically everybody.\" Hazel has a chance to laugh this time. walks up to them and says, \"Glad your back, Sawyer!\" Sawyer smiles to and nods. \"Maybe you can Winter more active, she's been a little lazier.\" Winter swims up to them, but splashes . starts saying, \"That's what you get for calling a dolphin lazy.\" Hazel bursts into laughter, and Winter sinks her head underwater, and splashes him again. now keeps a straight face. Sawyer laughs too, but has seen Hope swimming up to them to see what is going on. Winter and Hope exchange tweets. Hazel looks at Hope, Winter and Sawyer. Sawyer is smiling his really, really, really, really (You get the point...), cute smile. Sawyer out of nowhere grabs Hazel and drags her into the tank. Winter shrieks of joy. Her father chuckling tells them, \"I'll be at the office.\" Hazel nodded, and quickly splashed Sawyer in revenge. Hope then splashed Sawyer, thinking she must do the same thing, and Winter now copies Hope and Hazel, and splashes Sawyer. \"Hey I can't see!\" Sawyer yells over the splashing water. Hazel thinks, best day ever . Sawyer and Hazel change out of there wet clothes. They both had a lot of fun, and even played around with them for two hours. Hazel walks toward her father's office, and Sawyer quietly trails behind her. \"Hey-\"he starts, but Hazel immediately jumps. \"Sawyer, you scared me!\" Sawyer laughs and says,\" I want to talk to too!\" Hazel nods her head and says, \"Okay, okay.\" Ding! Hazel entered her father's office and see him typing up onto a document. \"Hey Dad,\" Hazel starts, and turns around. \"Do you mind if Sawyer and I talk to you for a minute or so?\" nods his head and says, \"Sure.\" Then he motions them both to take a seat. They both sit down on his couch keeping at least an inch away from each other. \"So…what's been happening around here?\" Sawyer says. \"Quite a couple of things has happened when you left and-\" starts but Sawyer anxiously interrupts him by saying, \"Like what kind of things?\" \"I'll tell you-\" \"What is it?\" Sawyer interrupts again. \"Can I talk first?\" says. \"Sorry.\" Sawyer quietly mumbles. \"Anyway, the week after you left, we got a call for a rescue of a turtle. Hazel named him Jack, and he instantly got better in a couple of weeks. After his test, the day after, he got released. Then there was a tiny expansion downstairs, for a jellyfish tank. Rebecca got a permit to learn how to take care of jellyfish and a couple of workers, are going to help her too.\" Sawyer takes in all of the information and only says, \"Cool.\" goes on by showing Sawyer pictures of Jack, and Sawyer got interested in Jack, and Hazel smiled. She always liked seeing Sawyer interested in things, she always thought that was- oh, her dad is looking at her. He must be looking at me, looking at Sawyer , she thought to herself. Hazel tried to hide her embarrassment, but she didn't hide it very well. Hope you guys enjoy the first chapter! :) Leave me reviews and feel free to say what you want to change or add to the fanfiction! Also, feel free to PM me about any ideas I should do! Remember this is when Sawyer got back from his SEA semester! -DolphinTale123[Chapter 2] Hey guys! I have written Chapter 2! Feel free to leave reviews, and what you want me to change or add! Now read on! I made this chapter longer than Chapter 1! Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2, and Waffle House. Chapter 2: Texting Sawyer woke up at 7:56AM just to text Hazel. Knowing her, he knew she would be up at 6:30AM in the morning every day. Sawyer Nelson: Morning Hazel :) She replied a few minutes later. Hazel H: Morning :) Sawyer Nelson: I can't believe you're up already! Hazel H: That's what I was gonna say about you! :) Sawyer Nelson: Haha, very funny Hazel H: Wanna come to the aquarium already? Dad's working early today :) Sawyer Nelson: No need to ask twice! I'll be there in ten minutes ;) Hazel H: Okay :) Sawyer then shuts his phone, and does everything he can in five minutes. Shower, change, brush his teeth, and eat breakfast. He also left a note for his mom that said: Going to work early today Love you! –Sawyer :) Sawyer hurried to the garage, and started to pedal on his bike. He dashed through and under trees and finally saw the sign that said: This way to Clearwater Marine Aquarium Sawyer got there in under 10 minutes, and parked his bike. He walked to Hazel's houseboat and see her in the crow's nest. That's weird, she's rarely up there anymore. Sawyer climbs up the ladder to the crow's nest anyway, and sees Hazel. \"What's wrong?\" Sawyer asked. Hazel didn't look like she was crying, but she still looked sad. \"Nothing.\" Hazel said miserably. \"Okay.\" Sawyer awkwardly says. They sit in silence for a while. \"Let's go to work.\" Hazel says. \"Okay.\" Sawyer mumbles. Hazel climbs down, and Sawyer does after. Hazel uses the front entrance to get inside, and Sawyer just follows. There is a crowd, full of not visitors, but volunteers. Hazel keeps saying to everyone, \"Excuse me.\" But Sawyer says silent. He could have gotten out of the crowd in one more step, but someone grabbed his arm. Sawyer turned around and saw Susie. \"Susie?\" Susie smiles and keeps a firm grip on his arm. \"Can we talk?\" Susie half-yells over the chattering of the volunteers. Sawyer keeps tugging, but Susie doesn't let go. \"Later?\" he says. Susie seems a little disappointed, but Sawyer finally sees Susie has let go. Sawyer walks up to catch up to Hazel and bam! Sawyer bumped into Hazel, and he says, \"Sorry.\" Hazel says quietly, \"It's okay. Let's just go.\" Hazel walks faster than Sawyer, and walks over to sit at a bench near the dolphin tank. Sawyer wonders why Hazel is acting strange, so he sits on a bench a couple inches away and pulls out his phone. Sawyer Nelson: Are you sad, Hazel? :( Hazel heard her phone ring, and replied: Hazel H: Something like that Sawyer Nelson: Would you tell me why? Hazel H: It might be stupid… Sawyer Nelson: Nothing you say is stupid :) Hazel H: Okay :) Hazel looks at Sawyer, but Sawyer is focused on his phone. Hazel gets a little pink and types: Hazel H: Well Sawyer Nelson: Well what? Hazel H: it's kind of sad news Sawyer Nelson: mm hmm what happened? Hazel H: Dad is giving the house boat away :'( Sawyer Nelson: Why?! :( Hazel H: He says we need a regular house Sawyer Nelson: That's not a reason :| Hazel H: I know I said I wanted a real house when I was 13 I think but now I like the houseboat a lot I don't want my childhood to be given away Sawyer Nelson: You did spend basically your whole life there ;) Hazel H: yeah I did :( Sawyer Nelson: It will get better I promise :) Sawyer smiles at Hazel, and Hazel looks at him. They both blush a little. Hazel H: I like talking to you :) Sawyer Nelson: Thanks I'm pretty professional Hazel H: haha :) Sawyer turns off his phone and quietly tells Hazel, \"Race you to the sea otters!\" Hazel gets caught by surprise and turns off her phone. \"Hey! Wait up!\" Hazel yells. Hazel Hazel waved goodbye to Sawyer and he waved goodbye to her. Hazel smiles. It was turning dark, so Hazel decides to go up the crow's nest. Not to see the stars, but only to think. When Hazel looks up at the sky she thinks to herself, I wish Sawyer and I could be more than just fr- \"Hey Dad.\" Hazel tells her father seeing him about to walk to the houseboat. Her father waves at her, and she waves back. I guess I need to sleep. Hazel wakes up at 8:38AM on a Sunday, and that was unusual for her. She'd always wake up at 6:30. Hazel ignores it anyway, and checks her phone. It had 5 texts, which were all from Sawyer. Sawyer Nelson texted at 6:31AM: Morning Hazel :) Sawyer Nelson texted at 6:33AM: I know I'm up pretty early Sawyer Nelson texted at 6:52AM: HELLO :) ? Sawyer Nelson texted at 7:14AM: You probably overslept Sawyer Nelson texted at 7:56AM: text me soon :) Hazel read all his texts feeling a little guilty that she had made Sawyer wait for her response, so she texted him. Hazel H: sorry Sawyer I overslept just woke up :( Sawyer replied a second later. Sawyer Nelson: It's okay Hazel Hazel H: So … what are you doing? Sawyer Nelson: Reading a dolphin book :) Hazel H: How long have you been reading? Sawyer Nelson: An hour or so ;) Hazel H: Wanna do something till 12? Sawyer Nelson: Sure! :) Hazel H: Breakfast at Waffle House? Sawyer Nelson: Meet you there :) Hazel H: Okay Sorry I had to end right there! I just want to make sure, if this looks like a good enough fanfiction chapter for a day. (I'm beginning!) Hazel is going to Waffle House in the next chapter, don't worry. ;) See you in the next chapter! :) -DolphinTale123[Chapter 3] Hey Readers! I had noticed in the first chapter, there was a \"blank\" when Hazel was meeting Sawyer. Well, it was supposed to be her father or \" \". I'm really sorry, it irritated me a lot, if it showed up for you, leave it in your review! Also, feel free to say what you want to add or change! PM, or review it. I hope you enjoy this chapter! Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale, Dolphin Tale 2, and Waffle House. Chapter 3: Kind of like a Date? Hazel had decided on something casual, although she hadn't known why she wanted to choose what she wanted to wear to the Waffle House… Anyway, she had decided on a summer-ish kind of dress, it has floral patterns and ends below her knees, and some purple sneakers. She had also left a note for her dad that said: Gonna eat Waffle House w/ Sawyer –HAZEL Luckily Waffle House wasn't that far away from the aquarium, and she only took two minutes to walk there. Hazel spotted Sawyer focused on his phone, and she yells, \"Sawyer!\" Oops. That was a little loud. Everyone out of their cars, kept staring at Hazel. She blushes in embarrassment, and walked over to Sawyer. \"Let's eat.\" Sawyer says. Hazel nods and says, \"Yeah.\" Sawyer sits down on one side of the table, and Hazel sits on the other. The waitress hands them two menus, and Hazel quickly spots the menu having huge letters of \"Saturday Night: Two People = Free Meal!\" If only I could get a free meal for one, she thought. Sawyer looks at the menu, and Hazel just can't help but look at him, focusing at the menu. The waitress clears her throat a little, and Hazel slightly jumps. Oh! She looks through the menu frantically, and finds interest in the waffles topped with whipped cream, and berries. The waitress then asks, \"What do you want to order?\" Sawyer doesn't speak, but Hazel gets it. He meant her to go first. \"Oh, uh…the waffles topped with whip cream and berries?\" she says, a little embarrassed that she hadn't known that Sawyer meant for her to go first. Sawyer quickly tells his order after that, and the waitress nods her head and says, \"Excellent choice.\" Hazel smiles, and the waitress collects their menus. Sawyer taps his fingers on the table, while Hazel quietly checks her bag. \"Um…\" Sawyer quietly mumbles. \"…\" \"Uh…\" Hazel quietly says to herself. The waiter immediately came back with their orders, and Hazel was caught by surprise. They came back real fast, she thought. Sawyer thanks the waiter, and the waiter just nods. Hazel starts to eat her waffles, while thinking, Sawyer is so kind. \"So…\" Hazel says while walking along Sawyer. \"Want to go somewhere else?\" Hazel finishes her sentence. Sawyer nods and says,\"Yeah. The mall? It's right ahead, anyway.\" Hazel does kind-of-a excited girl squeal, and almost yells into Sawyer's ear. \"Yes! Yes! YES!\" Sawyer didn't know why Hazel is so excited to go the mall now, but they walk there anyway. \"Sawyer,\" Hazel starts grabbing his arm. \"Hurry! Hurry!\" Sawyer laughs and says, \"Why are you so excited?\" Then, Hazel crosses her arms like a little girl begging for a toy, and violently points to the fish store. \"You want a fish? That is what you want?\" Sawyer asks confused. \"No!\" Hazel yells, sort of loud, just not as loud as she did in the parking lot of Waffle House. Sawyer looks to where she was pointing again, and see she had meant the swimsuit/ ocean toys store. \"Oh.\" Sawyer mumbles, kind of embarrassed but laughing at the same time. Hazel excitedly walks into the store, and as always Sawyer trailing slowly behind her. Hazel looks around at the toys area, and sees all sorts of swim mats. Pink, purple, white, black, green, yellow, and blue! She grabs the blue, and white mat. Hazel remembers that Winter needs a new pool noodle, and at least a couple of them. Not your usual teenager girl gets that excited about ocean toys! She then grabs about five of the pool noodles, and realizes she can't carry them all on her own. \"Sawyer!\" she yells to him, although he isn't that far away. \"Yeah?\" he replies. \"Carry these for me!\" she yells, again. Sawyer slowly approaches Hazel, and when he is front of her, Hazel stuffs all the toys onto his face. \"You're going to buy all of these toys?\" he yells over the mats and pool noodles. \"Of course I am!\" Hazel yells, while looking at rubber duckies. This one, no, this one, but I also like this one…, she thought, looking at the duckies. When she is done with choosing the rubber duckies, she picks out one water gun for Hope, since the old one is getting kind of well, old. Sawyer almost carries everything Hazel gets, but Hazel isn't done. \"Checkout time!\" she tells Sawyer. \"Ah, um, okay.\" Sawyer says, while some of the noodles are slipping. They both head to the checkout, where a nice man at the counter is seeing the two teenagers carrying huge amount of ocean toys. \"Uh…okay.\" the guy at the counter tells himself. Sawyer accidentally lets go of one pool noodle, and everything came tumbling down his arm like an avalanche. \"Sorry…\" Sawyer tells the guy at the counter. \"Uh, it's okay.\" He tells Sawyer. Hazel still looks very happy, and hands the guy at the counter her credit card. (More likely her dad's.) He then takes the credit card, and scans it through. Hazel sees Sawyer picking up all the toys he dropped, while Hazel has no problem carrying all of her toys that she is holding. \"Let's go, Sawyer.\" The guy at the counter thinks to himself, that's strange. We make more profit on our swimsuits. Sawyer manages to grab all of the toys he dropped, and finally catches up to Hazel. He checks his watch, 2:56PM. He almost had a panic attack, and then yells to Hazel, \"Hazel! It's 2:56! We got to head back to the aquarium!\" Hazel checks her own watch, and then yells back to Sawyer, \"Run!\" They both respond, and run back. Hazel drops all the toys by the edge of the dolphin pool, luckily nothing drops in. Sawyer was right behind Hazel, and does the same. Winter sees them both, and tweets. \"I'm…so...Tired…from running!\" Hazel tells Sawyer, barely being able to speak. \"Me...too. Sawyer tells Hazel. Hazel checks her watch and its 3:14PM. I better hope my dad will lay it easy on me, he hates it when I'm late- \"Where were you guys?\" her father yelled to Sawyer and Hazel. Oops. Author's Note: Did you guys enjoy the chapter? Feel free to tell me what you want to add or change to the fanfiction. See you in the next chapter! -DolphinTale123[Chapter 4] Author's Note: Hey guys! Already the 4 th chapter! Yay! :) Hoping to get more feedback on this chapter, adding a special treat xD. Feel free to review, say what you want to change or add, and read on! Disclaimer: I do not own Dolphin Tale or Dolphin Tale Chapter 4: Rescue Hazel \"We were, uh… shopping?\" Hazel tells her father. \"Shopping?\" Hazel's father says, like it's not an excuse. Hazel bit her lip and said, \"Well, you know, for Winter and Hope.\" Her father hadn't seen the pile of, toys yet, so he didn't exactly know the real reason they were being \"defensive\". \"Where are the toys, anyway?\" He asked. Sawyer and Hazel scoot out of the way, and her father had quickly realized they were being \"defensive\". \"We, uh, kind of… brought a lot.\" Sawyer mumbles to her father, while trying to be, happy. Hazel bit her lip again, and says, \"Why don't we show Winter and Hope there new toys?\" Hazel's father let's her go anyway, and walks back to his office. Sawyer helps pick up all the toys, and starts replacing old toys with the new ones. Winter does the tweety bird at Sawyer, and he doesn't look at her, so Winter splashes Sawyer. Winter shrieks, and Sawyer turns around to say, \"Hey!\" Winter sinks underwater, thinking Sawyer can't splash her back underwater. Hazel walks around to the other edge of the pool, and Hope follows her. Hope tweets, and Winter shrieks back. Sawyer sits by the edge by the pool, and dries off with a towel he found in his backpack. Hazel sits directly on the other side of the pool across from Sawyer, and plays with Hope and the new toys. Phoebe comes running past the turtle tank and stops when she sees Hazel and Sawyer playing around with the dolphins at the tank. Hazel spots her, and can tell something is wrong. \"What's wrong?\" Hazel yells, seeing Phoebe at the other side of the dolphin tank. \"There's a beached dolphin. And-\"before Phoebe could finish her sentence by Hazel and Sawyer which say at the same time, \"Can we come?\" Phoebe nods, and Hazel and Sawyer run as quickly as they can. Sawyer The truck always is bumpy going somewhere, but Sawyer didn't mind. All he could he could keep his mind on, was the beached dolphin. Was it a male, or female? All the questions he didn't know, made him want to know more. The truck came to a halt, and then Sawyer could hear Hazel's Father yelling, \"Hurry!\" The truck's back door opens, and Phoebe heads out first, with all the volunteers following her, including Sawyer. Sawyer spots the beached dolphin, shrieking of fear, and a tiny crowd had formed along the shore, probably wondering what is happening. Hazel carries the stretcher alongside her father, and smiles at Sawyer. Sawyer returned the smile. Phoebe was calming down the beached dolphin, and told everyone it was a male dolphin, a little older than Winter, actually. Sawyer did notice a sunburn and some cuts that are bleeding, but they don't look bad. Phoebe and Clay were the only ones waist deep in water, and Sawyer had realized why. The sand was kind of like mud, it sort of sunk you into the water. Some of the volunteers had a hard time pushing the dolphin calmly onto the stretcher, but Hazel filmed it all. Sawyer had helped carry the 800 pound dolphin, and for sure, it wasn't easy. Hazel went waist deep into the water trying to get to her father, and almost drops the camera. It's almost a dangerous beach, he thought. Hazel almost screams from almost dropping the camera, but Sawyer catches the camera. \"Thanks, Sawyer.\" Hazel awkwardly tells Sawyer. Sawyer smiles and says, \"It's okay.\" Sawyer continues to help carry the dolphin, all the way to the truck. Hazel's father helped Phoebe and Hazel to get out of the \"sinking sand\", and follows everyone into the truck. Sawyer climbs into the back of the truck, and sits next down to the dolphin. Kat helps pet the dolphin, calming it down more. More and more dolphins. Everyone that helped the beached dolphin, also helped moving the (identified) male dolphin into the gated area from Winter and Hope's tank. Winter and Hope were playing around, trying to push each other off their new mats, even if Hazel and Sawyer had brought two. Winter had suspected there was something going on at the gated area of their tank, and Hope shrieked. Winter goes to the edge of the gate, and swims around it. Phoebe talks to Winter and says, \"Winter, not now.\" Winter tweets, and swims back to push Hope off the mat since she hogged it anyway. Finally, they had put the male dolphin into the gated area, and Sawyer sat down against the pillar. Hazel, on the other hand, was thinking of a name for the male dolphin, and still alongside her father. \"Aiden! I was thinking the aid in Aiden could be related!\" Hazel yells, almost making her father deaf. \"Okay. Aiden it is.\" Her father says, and everyone cheers. Sawyer smiles and whispers to himself, \"Hazel always thinks of good names for dolphin, doesn't she?\" Sawyer hadn't seen Kyle standing next to him, but Kyle smirked. He had always known they had liked each other. Sawyer had climbed down to the platform of the pool, and Phoebe was alongside him. They were going to introduce Winter and Hope to Aiden. He had spotted sunscreen on Aiden, and some of his cuts were healing. Winter and Hope were at the other platform, there attention to Rebecca and Kat. Phoebe ungated Aiden's area, and called him over to the platform. Hazel's father Clay, and Hazel were watching from above, and Sawyer looked at them both. Maybe Winter and Aiden could get along, I'm just not sure about Hope. Winter had been called to the center of the pool, and Hope next. They were both confused, until Aiden approached them. Winter didn't do anything, but swam alongside Aiden. Hope didn't like Aiden, so she swam back to the platform where Rebecca and Kat were. Sawyer was a little disappointed that Hope didn't like Aiden, but he was just glad she didn't react as bad as she did the first time Hope had met Winter. Winter and Aiden were getting along, at least. Phoebe called Aiden back into the gated tank, and closed the gate. Winter was left alone at the center of the pool, till she was called back by Rebecca and Kat. Sawyer biked all the way home, and he couldn't stop biking until he accidently crashes a little into the tree near his garage. He opens the door to his home swiftly, and yells at the door to his mom's room, \"Back Mom! I don't need any dinner!\" Although Sawyer had loved food, he didn't want any right now, he really badly wanted to learn more about male dolphins, but the SEA semester had only taught him a little about the difference between male and female dolphins. He wanted to make sure he could have taken care of Aiden more properly, the next day at CMA, he thought. What stinks is, school starts next week. Heyyy! I hope that is enough for today! So what do you think of the new beached dolphin? Feel free what you want to add or change and don't forget to review! See you in the next chapter! (Sorry it took so long to post this!) -DolphinTale123[Chapter 5] Author's Note: CHAPTER 5?! :O And I am deeply sorry I couldn't post chapter 5, in like FOREVER… I usually type a rough draft, then I would put the final draft, and plot difficulties! Can't just have a bad plot! Anyway, hope you enjoy the chapter, and don't forget to suggest what you want to change, add, and review! Read on! Chapter 5: The Worst Mall Day Hazel 6 days later… Hazel had realized when Sawyer was biking his way to the aquarium, he only had today, till he could go to school. I sometimes wish I could go to school too. Hazel carries a cooler full of fish to the river otter's tank, and sits down. She spots Sawyer talking to some volunteers, she may or may not have talked to before, but that didn't bother her. Earlier this morning, Hazel had seen her grandfather helping to move things out of the houseboat. When Hazel was lost in her thoughts, Sawyer had walked up next to her. \"Hazel?\" Sawyer says calmly, snapping Hazel out of her thoughts. Then Hazel tried to act casual instead of embarrassed, and said,\" Yeah?\" Sawyer smiles and says, \"Can I, um, help you?\" Hazel nods, with a grin plastered on her face, and decides she wants Sawyer a nice and peaceful last day at the aquarium. Thirty minutes passed, and now Sawyer and Hazel were ready to feed the sea turtles with buckets of veggies. Hazel sits on a flat rock, grabs a piece of lettuce, and throws it into the water. A lightly green shelled turtle spots the piece of lettuce that Hazel threw, and eats it happily. It was silent for a while, except for the sounds of water, and chomping. Hazel breaks the silence by telling Sawyer, \"Do you like every day just helping out here, you never get tired of it?\" Sawyer nods and says, \"Yeah, never ever.\" Hazel smiles to herself, and decides to get some more vegetables. When she does, her leg stumbles, and she was about to fall into the water, till Sawyer catches her. \"Oh, uh, thanks.\" Hazel mutters, while Sawyer lifts her back up. Sawyer smiles and says, \"Well, it's not going to be every day you slip on a rock in a sea turtle tank, while feeding them vegetables.\" Hazel pushes Sawyer into the water, just for fun. Sawyer yells, \"Hey! I was trying to be nice!\" Hazel laughs, till a really, really loud screech interrupts her. Sawyer looks where it was coming from, and it turns out that Kyle accidently scratched his fingernails on the chalkboard. Or maybe he did it on purpose. Anyway, Sawyer gets out of the water, and dries himself off. Sawyer sits next to Hazel on the flat rock, and Hazel feels her fingernails that she painted a faint pink this morning, brushing Sawyer's fingernails. A green eyed turtle named Gus, eyes the two teenagers, and goes back to swimming with his turtle friends. When Hazel turns her head to look at Sawyer, he had done the same. Their faces were only inches apart, till- Kyle walks by to check on them. Hazel turns to face the turtles, and now blushes a bright pink. Oops. Kyle smirks at Sawyer, and Sawyer gives him a glare. \"How the turtles doing?\" Kyle asks, like he didn't see them almost kiss. \"They are great, Kyle!\" Hazel says excitedly. \"Okay, then. See ya!\" Kyle yells, while walking in the direction of the dolphin tank. Hazel whispers to herself, \"Wonder why he's so cheerful.\" Later that day, Sawyer dries off with a towel on a bench outside of Hazel father's office or Clay. Hazel however is on a bench tying her shoes in running gear, a bench away from Sawyer. Sawyer asks Hazel curiously, \"What are you doing?\" Hazel says while tying her shoes, \"Somewhere.\" Sawyer noticed Hazel sounded, well mad, at him. He watched Hazel as she ran off the way to the Clearwater Hospital. Hazel Hazel takes a sip from her hot chocolate, and see Lorraine sit down gently, as how nice she is. \"So what's up, Hazel? Anything wrong?\" Lorraine asks nicely. \"Just, well…I like Sawyer, and I don't think he can go out with me or something.\" Hazel says miserably. Lorraine nods her head and thinks, how oblivious is my son? Lorraine says finally, \"Do you know why?\" Inside, Hazel was not sure if she could tell Sawyer's mom (Lorraine), but she did anyway. \"Susie, a volunteer at the aquarium, spread a rumor that she was going out with Sawyer next Saturday.\" Lorraine tries to cheer Hazel up with maybe good news, \" Well, maybe you can try steal Sawyer before he goes out with her?\" Hazel looks at her hot chocolate cup and says, \"Yeah. I guess.\" Sawyer Back at the aquarium, a lot happened. Now he was going shopping with Susie?! Okay, he panicked, he didn't want to let her down harshly. But before all that this is what happened: Susie approached Sawyer, and sat down on the bench next to him. \"Hey Sawyer.\" Susie says as calmly as she can. To Sawyer, her sweet voice had surprised him. \"Hey.\" He replies to Susie half-heartily. \"Would, you go out with me, Sawyer?\" Susie says, with the excitement growing in her voice. \"Um…I wa-\"Sawyer starts, but Susie interrupts him. \"Thanks! Let's go shopping for our outfits!\" Everything was a blur from after that, forced into a cab, and being dragged into the mall, into a really formal store. \"Is it a formal date?\" Sawyer yells into Susie's ear, hoping it would slow her down, but it didn't. \"Yeah!\" Susie yells. This is going to be his worst mall day. Author's Note: OH MY GOSH SO MUCH DRAMA! What do you think about this chapter? Feel free to leave reviews or suggestions! SEE YOU IN THE NEXT CHAPTER! -DolphinTale123[Chapter 6] Author's Chapter: Hey everyone! So sorry I haven't updated in a while and it would have been my last one due to plot bunnies all over the place, and a case of writer's block. So I am ending this fanfiction, and I know, pretty pathetic for me to do that for my first fanfiction. But, if you like Harry Potter or if you're an H/Hr shipper, look at my profile soon, I am posting my first Harry Potter fic, and it's going to be a one-shot. I also will experiment with different fanfictions too, not just the usual H/Hr ship. But I love you readers! Here's a free cat (or dog, or oh, whatever you like.) *gives free cat* -PotterFan3456 (I also changed my username, my old one was taken already.) ","Summary":" Author's Note: Hey readers! I love Dolphin Tale and Dolphin Tale 2, so I decided to make a fanficti"},{"Movie":"Emperor's New Groove","Title":"Emperor's New Love","Author":"ZooturtleFano6","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/12224075","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I was sweeping the floor, laughing as all my kittens chased dust particles that the broom was lifting up. By the small window, the four cats I owned were sleepily lazing in a piece of sun the window brought in. My hut was cool, the cement keeping out any summer heat the season tried to bring in. I was interrupted from my chores by a loud knock.. I put down my broom and answered the door. Standing in front of me were two guards, half of their body painted blue, the other half red. I tried to ignore their cringing looks at the sight of me; I was pretty much more concerned with the fact there were soldiers at my door. The one to the left of me said in a booming voice. \"In order of the Emperor of Tawantinsuyu , you have been called upon to come to the palace in order for the Emperor to choose a bride.\" Wait, what? One of them grabbed my arm, I tried to kick him, but the other one grabbed my whole body. \"My cats!,\" I cried, watching my door swing closed. They carried me to the palace, it was a ridiculously long trip, and I almost felt bad for the guard. Him having to carry a screaming, squirming, kicking girl over hills and up thousands of steps. I gaped at the sight before me. A hug golden palace built like Inti, our Sun God, was standing before me. The guard brought me inside past huge red and gold tapestries hung everywhere that looked they weighed a ton, and some looked like they were made of silk. He finally set me down in a room that was covered in fabric. An older man looked me over. \"Nothing I can do for her in time period Emperor wants her done. Hair too messy, no proper clothes to fit her right now. Take her away.\" Before I could move or say anything, the guards led me through a few hallways, the one who had carried me up here was about to carry me again if I didn't knock off the \"glancing in every direction to see if there's an escape\" act. They placed me next to seven other woman, all much more beautiful than me. They were all dressed in white wedding dresses, most with gold somewhere on their body. They made me feel small, looking at them then at myself. I had messy black hair that frizzed everywhere and wouldn't stay in place, and a raggy blue dress, the shoulder strap falling down my arm. I wasn't about to be anybody's \"bride\". But before I could look for a secret exit, a man burst through the two big doors. \"Boom baby!\"[Chapter 2] A man entered the room wearing a red robe, slick black shoulder length hair, and a golden crown. The Emperor. No time to think of an escape now. A stout man who had been waiting for him jumped at his entrance. \"Aah! Your Highness! It is time for you to choose your bride,\" He said with a little bow. The Emperor, or Kuzco, rubbed his hands together and said, \"Alrightey, trot out the ladies.\" I noticed the other girls around me straightened up a little, so I put my anger away for just a second and did the same. After all, this guy's an emperor right? \"Let's take a look-see. Hate your hair. Not likely. Yikes. Yikes. Yikes.\" Each time he insulted them, they gasped. I felt something begin to boil in the pit of my stomach. This was my emperor? \"And let me guess. You have a great personality.\" He rolled his eyes and looked questioningly at the official. \"Is this really the best you could do?\" A girl to my left looked like she was gonna whack him, but another girl grabbed her arm and held her back. I couldn't help but giggle a little, I don't know why. I find a lot of things funny, maybe because I felt exactly like that girl. He must've heard me, because it snapped him out of his trance staring at the official and stared at me. I gulped and looked away, trying to pretend I was a statue. Kuzco walked closer to me, giving me an odd look before scoffing \"What did you just wake up? And I thought I asked my clothing designer to dress you, you're in rags,\" he said, gesturing to my hair and clothes. I couldn't help but hiss at this insult, a habit I picked up from my cats every time somebody offends me. I only got this reply, \"Oh and you are a cat now.\" He gave the official a disgusted look, and the poor small man stuttered to find words, maybe one or two excuses that could save his job and pacify this bratty emperor. Now I was angry. I wonder if the women next to me saw how red my face was, cause like the last one they grabbed my arm in an attempt to stop me from what I was going to try next. But they failed as I whipped my arm away, and they all knocked each other over to the ground like dominoes. I wasn't able to accomplish my task of justice for what little dignity he left me with because he noticed immediately at the official's glances and the guards rushing up behind me. Wonderful. I went to run, but again, the picked me up, each one pressing my arm against my body and lifting me off the ground, kicking and trying to make them let go. He whipped around, and I wanted to smack the smug smile off his face. Literally. \"Well, maybe you're a little more interesting than I thought,\" he said, looking up at me closely. I growled as he lifted my chin up to get a better look at my face. \"Green eyes…thin waste…,\" he noted. This guy was starting to piss me off. He must've been about to check my teeth or something, because he was attempting to open my mouth. No. No one touches my mouth, and I don't care if Kuzco was Inti Himself, he will not put his stinking hand into my mouth. So I bit him. \"Ah ow!\" , he yelled grasping his hand. The guards who were holding me squeezed me tighter and were about to bring me away, but Kuzco held up his hand to tell them to stop. I couldn't help but smirk when I saw the marks I made in his finger. \"I'll take this one!\", he told the official excitedly, clapping his hands. \"What!?\", both me and the official squeaked with our mouths open. \"But…but your Highness, she bit you! She should be put in prison-\" \"Are you questioning my decision? I said I chose this one, and if you don't mind, I will have this one. Now go do something useful, like get me a glass of water,\" Kuzco glared. The official jumped and quickly scurried away muttering. The emperor told the guards to go, and I was left facing him. \"I'm not marrying you,\" I said plainly breaking what seemed to be a secret staring contest between us. This only seemed to interest him more. He leaned forward and studied me closer; making me feel so uncomfortable I finally looked away from the grin playing on his lips. He told the guards to take me to my room and have the servants find me something suitable to wear, and they dragged me out pouting. It was useless to scream or swear at him, I would only be held on tighter if I tried to struggle, and I was too confused to even think of an escape plan. I could only think of the words \"I choose this one\", they were ringing again and again in my head. What did I just unintentionally get myself into?[Chapter 3] The servant girls dressed me up in a red dress that went down to my ankles, highlighting my curves. The gold colored poncho that was attached to the dress and showed off most of my shoulders felt loose. To complete it, I had to wear turquoise earrings and black sandals with thin straps. I looked like a feminine Kuzco basically. Time to gag. But that wasn't the worst of, they spent at least an hour trying to brush out my hair, and it was so painful I ended up crying. They finally decided to put it up in a bun to hide it being only half brushed. Finally they pushed me into a hallway were Kuzco was standing checking his nails. I tried to push myself back into the room, but they slammed the door on me. Kuzco turned around, and unless I interpreted it wrong, his expression was jaw dropping awe. Yeah, I probably interpreted it wrong. I took a step back as he walked towards me. \"Hah! Bet you're excited to be the empress,\" He crooned, leaning against the wall and twisting a strand of dangling hair from my bun with his finger. \" My empress.\" Yuck. I thought I told him two hours ago I wasn't marrying him. I slapped his hand away from my hair, it was making me uncomfortable. I could tell he was annoyed, making me smile a little, but I could also see the interest in his face, making me angry. \"For the last time I am not marrying you!\" And get my point across, \"Hkkkkkss!\" A hiss. The smile never left his face. \"Okay, okay, maybe you're a slow learner. Let me explain this for you. Tomorrow, on my birthday, we will be having a wedding to celebrate our marriage, and you will become my wife and the empress, and you'll get to tell people what to do. Well, heh, except for me of course.\" I pushed back my tears, but the possibility of never seeing my cats or village again was painful. Almost as painful as being married to him. He rubbed his hands together. \"Okay, time to take care of some business.\" He started to walk away, but then turned expectantly towards me. So I shuffled over to him, not wanting the guards to carry me over, and he put his arm around me hugging me tight. And as we walked like that, it was then that I decided I was going to be so stubborn, rebellious, and maybe even a lot more violent that he would never want to marry me even if I was worth a million pieces of gold.[Chapter 4] As we entered Kuzco's throne room, I had to take a moment to look around. It was so big. \"Impressive, right?\" He said, taking my hand and leading me to the tall tower holding his throne. In his throne, a woman, an extremely old looking woman who proved that dinosaur's once roamed the earth, was rubbing her eyes as a peasant who had been asking for help with food for his family had been brought away. We snuck up behind her. \"The nerve of some of those peasants, huh?\" \"Tell me about. Aah!\" she gasped suddenly realizing who had just spoken to her. \"Hi there.\" \"Ooh, your Highness!\" She brushed of his seat. \"Oh, oh, oh, ha ha ha, um…\" \"Uh you were doing it again.\" \"Doing? Ha ha ha… doing what?\" \"My job. I'm the emperor. And you're the emperor's advisor. Remember that?\"Kuzco asked. \"But your Highness\", the woman pleaded. \"I was only dealing with meaningless peasant matters…\" I smirked at her feeble excuses, and glanced at Kuzco. I could tell he wasn't paying attention to her talking, more to her age. Probably thinking the same thing I was. 'Look at those wrinkles…what is holding this woman together…' I flinched when I saw the piece of food in her teeth. 'How long has that been there?' The guy next to Yzma broke our trance with a light punch on Kuzco's shoulder. \"Good thinking Yzma. What do you say Kuzco? \" Kuzco reacted with a jump and slicing his hands through the air defensively. \"Whoa! No touchy! No touchy! No touch. \" A servant interrupted him. \"Excuse me your Highness, the village leader is here to see you.\" \"Oh great, send him in!\" He then looked at Yzma. \"Oh and by the way you're fired.\" \"Fired? W-w-what do you mean fired? \" Kuzco looked thoughtful for a second. \"Um, how else can I say it…\" He snapped his finger and a little man appeared with a pink slip and a pen. \"You're being let go, you're department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option…take your pick. I've got more.\" The little man stuck the piece of paper on her nail. \"But I-you-uh,\" she sighed and collapsed in his seat. \"Uuh-but, your Highness, I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire for-for-for, many, many years!\" He waved her off. \"Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride. You just hit yours fifty years ago.\" I had been struggling to keep my composure and a straight face throughout all of this, but that last remark did it. I burst out laughing. \"Burn!\" I laughed through tears. Yzma, who hadn't noticed me before, gave me such a glare that Inti Himself might've melted if he had been faced with it. Kuzco smirked at my laughter, and that made my face grow red with sudden regret for laughing, realizing it gave him some sort of satisfaction. \"So…who's in my chair?\" He teased his now ex-advisor. The buff man who had stayed silence all this time suddenly spoke excitedly like a puppy, \"Oh, oh! I know! Yzma. Yzma's in your chair right?\" \"Very good Kronk. Here. Get the snack,\" Kuzco said, tossing Kronk a cracker. Kronk quickly tried to snatch it with his mouth, and ended up falling over the edge of the tall pedestal where Kuzco's throne sat. I covered my mouth in shock watching him fall. \"Ok, you heard the man. Up, up, up.\" \"I'm okay, I'm fine!\" Kronk yelled as if Yzma really cared at this instance. I was glad he was okay though. Yzma stormed away snarling. Kuzco sat in his chair comfortably. \"Sit down,\" he told me, snapping his fingers. Two guys carried in a slightly smaller golden throne and placed it next to Kuzco's. \"No.\" I refused to sit next to someone who plans on forcing me to marry him and doesn't even bother to ask my name. \"Your name.\" It came so sudden I actually looked at him. Creepy. \"Atsila,\" I said plainly, sitting with my legs crossed next to the edge of the platform. He raised an eyebrow. \"Huh.\" He shook his head and sighed, getting more comfortable. \"Okay, show him in,\" He told the guard.

Usually a snakebite was not fatal to someone unless it was on a child or an old person or someone weak. Mattie was young but not a child; and certainly not weak. Still she could die. For someone that had spent over 50 years running free, never settling down, having few he cared about, this was something new. Mattie Ross was a handful; but somehow she had become important to him over the last few weeks. Labouef would be along as soon as he could; but his wound slowed him down. He would not be here probably for another day. Getting here this fast had killed Mattie's horse; Rooster had put it out of its misery just minutes ago. The doctor rose and went towards Rooster. \"Marshal, I hate to say it but I might have to take her arm. The infection is bad.\" Rooster glared at him. \"What do you need?\" \"Marshal, there is nothing more I can do.\" Rooster stamped out the door and into the cold. Staring at the sky he cursed. For a 14 year old girl to lose an arm-that was just wrong. Grimly he began to pace. Then he remembered something he had learned long ago. He went back into the cabin. \"Doc, I remember years ago a Piute using goldenseal to treat a rattlesnake bite. It worked pretty good. Do you have any?\" The Doctor blinked and started to shake his head when his wife, who also acted as his nurse, spoke up. \"I have some. Do you remember how it was prepared?\" Rooster thought hard. \"It was a dry powder, kind of yellow. He heated up some water and poured a handful into a cup; then he soaked a rag in it and tied up the wound with it.\" The Doctor looked skeptical. \"I have heard of it but never from anyone that saw it used.\" \"You have a better idea then waiting until you have to take her arm?\" Rooster kept at him until he did it. Mattie could feel something; all was white, she could not see or hear but she could feel. Pain. Coming from her left arm. Slowly she became aware of more; she managed to open her eyes; she could hear some sounds. A face above her seemed to say something; but she could not recognize the face or the sounds. She felt herself drifting off. Rooster was dozing when suddenly he was awake. He looked around; the lantern was dim, what had woke him up? Then he heard a noise- sounded like someone trying to make a sound. He looked towards the bed and saw Mattie move her head, her eyes flickering. He moved closer, then over her, trying to get her attention; her eyes opened. She was flushed and not aware; he could tell that. Then her eyes closed and she was still. He moved to the door and went into the main part of the cabin. The Doc was asleep but his wife was knitting. \"Maam, she was awake for a minute. Then went back to sleep. Seems easier somehow.\" She nodded and went in to check on Mattie. She came out a couple minutes later. \"Her fever is down; so is the swelling over the bite wound. I think that goldenseal is working.\" Rooster grinned. \"Well that's good.\" He went back in and sat in the chair; in a while he dozed off. The next morning after checking that Mattie seemed to be getting steadily better, Rooster went outside to look around. It was cold but clear. Not much wind; all in all not a bad day. He moved away from the small cluster of buildings to get a better look around; he was not very familiar with the area. Then he noticed off in the distance a rider heading his way. He watched carefully for a few minutes until he was sure. Then he went back inside. The Doctor came out of Mattie's room. \"Well Marshall I am going to have to make sure I keep goldenseal around from now on. Her arm is much better and so is she.\" \"Well Doc that is good. I hated to see Baby Sis without an arm. For a youngun that is pretty bad.\" \"Without that goldenseal she would have lost that arm. That snake bit her right in a vein; worst place outside of the neck or an artery to be bit in.\" \"Just so long as she is going to be OK.\" \"I see no reason she should not recover completely. She seemed otherwise strong and healthy. Probably will take a few days of bed rest but that is all.\" \"Doc, I bet you she will be demanding out of here inside of two days.\" \"Headstrong, I take it?\" \"You have no idea. She rode 200 miles here in winter with me and a Texas Ranger to hunt down the man that murdered her father. Could not get rid of her. And as it turned out she was the one that shot him and killed him.\" The Doctors eyes widened at that. His wife was just as impressed. \"That young girl?\" \"Maam, that young girl is as tough as an old cob.\" The door opened and LaBoeuf stepped in, looking a little ragged at best, with a blood stained bandage around his head. He looked at Rooster, who was as usual quick. \"Baby Sis is going to be ok, you ought to have the sawbones here take a look at your head. Might need to amputate.\" LaBoeuf grinned, then took off his hat. The doctor moved towards him and took a look, then pulled him over to sit on a chair. Rooster went back into Mattie's room. Mattie felt herself slowly coming to; it was like a long set of stairs. But she could feel things and now she could hear; slowly she opened her eyes. Everything was blurry for a bit; then it began to clear. Rooster had been dozing some when he woke up and looked towards the bed. Mattie was moving her head, he got up and went over. SLOWLY her vision cleared and she recognized Rooster. She smiled softly. \"Marshal?\" Rooster looked for the water jug and the glass next to it; he filled it half way and moved over to the bed. Mattie felt weak and her arm hurt but she wanted that water more. She managed to sip some down and it felt really good. Settling back with a sigh, she looked around the room. Then at her arm, still bandaged up. It hurt, but she managed to move her fingers. Rooster watched her, then spoke up. \"You almost lost that arm; but you will be fine. Just take a while.\" Mattie nodded. Then laid back. Slowly her eyes closed and she was asleep. Rooster smiled and suddenly the world looked a lot better. He went back out. The Doctor was carefully wiping around the cut on LaBoeuf's head; he was wincing slightly but staying quiet. Rooster watched for a moment then tossed a comment. \"Well, Doc, you gonna have to take it off?\" LaBoeuf glared at him. Then winced again as the Doctor poked. \"It is not a bad cut; not infected. He will be fine.\" \"I guess that is good. Baby Sis woke up and spoke to me and wiggled her fingers; drank some water and went back to sleep.\" \"That is good. A few days and she will be up and around.\" The doctor finished bandaging LaBoeuf. \"Change this dressing every day and make sure it's clean. You should be fine.\" LaBoeuf grunted and stood up. \"Well if that is the case then I ought to see about getting Chaney's body to town so that the Sheriff can write up that it's him for the reward. What about Pepper?\" Rooster thought about it. \"One of us needs to stay for Baby Sis. Pepper is worth, I think, $200 dollars. Not sure. Take him in as well and get it written up. But you ought to rest up a day – and the horses need it just as much if not more.\" The Doctor was blunt. \"You should rest up some- head injuries are nothing to fool around with. At least a day of no exertion and rest.\" LaBoeuf sighed. He knew they were right. Rooster grinned. \"I'll show you where to put the horses. We can unload the bodies behind the stable and throw a blanket over them. Nice thing about the weather is that they won't start to stink.\" Both men were much more cheerful knowing the young girl would be OK, though they would not admit it openly. LaBoeuf sacked out in the spare room with Rooster. He finally admitted he was tired and went out early. Rooster stayed in Mattie's room until late. She woke up again and was more alert. She then asked how long before she could travel to the doctor; and when he said several days she said two; Rooster laughed. The next morning LaBoeuf went into Matties room to say goodbye. She was quite alert and sharp. \"The Texas Rangers should be proud of you, Mr LaBoeuf. You did well. And I thank you for helping me bring my fathers murderer to justice; even if it was at the end of my fathers pistol.\" \"Well Miss Ross, that was what one could consider proper justice; the gun of the man who he murdered killing him at the hand of the daughter of that man. Seems like that is fairly proper.\" Mattie nodded. \"I want to thank you for helping take care of me. I know now that going along with you two was not the right thing to do; nor was it sensible. But it was what I had to do. I had to be sure that the man that killed my father paid.\" \"We might not have gotten it done without you bothering us; one never knows. You have my address, Miss Ross. I would appreciate a letter now and then.\" Mattie smiled. \"You will get them, that I promise. And I expect great tales from Texas in return.\" \"Well I do not know about tales, but I think I can manage to get a letter out now and then.\" Mattie held out her good hand and he clasped it; nothing more needed to be said. Three days later Mattie insisted she was well enough to travel. Rooster agreed though the doctor was not so sure. It was only a days ride to town and there was a doctor there so upon getting a firm promise to rest at least a day or two there and see him he let Mattie go. Rooster snorted; he knew there was nothing the Doctor could do to keep her from going. Mattie was weak; but as always stubborn. Rooster insisted on stopping twice to let her rest; but they still made it to town by dusk. The local hotel had plenty of rooms available and Mattie immediately went to bed, despite protestations that she was fine. Rooster spent the evening happily sipping the local brew at one of the Saloons in town. But he did not get drunk and made it to bed before midnight. The next morning he rousted Mattie ought early to see the doctor in town while he went to see the Sheriff. \"Marshal, Ranger LaBoeuf was here and got all the necessary paperwork for both Tom Chaney and Ned Pepper. The reward for Pepper was raised to $500 last Month. I would expect the money to be wired in either today or tomorrow for Pepper. The money for Chaney will take longer.\" Rooster was cheered up a lot by the extra money for Pepper. \"Well Marshall, Miss Ross needs some rest so we will be here for a few days.\" Whistling cheerfully Rooster headed for the Doctors office. He found Mattie waiting for him. The Doctor was an older man, but appeared competent. \"I would recommend Miss Ross rest a day or two before continuing on; and I also recommend slow travel with at least two pauses a day for her to rest. She seems well otherwise.\" \"Well Doctor we will be here for a day or two anyway waiting for the reward money so that is not a problem.\" Leading Mattie out the door he was not surprised to hear that she had things to do. \"First I want to go to the Telegraph Office and send a message home to let my mother know that all is well and that justice has been done. Then we will go to the general store and I will purchase some additional clothes. There is a Chinese Laundry in town and I will have what I have been wearing taken care of. I am also going to see about getting a better horse. The one I have is not very good.\" Rooster smiled; she was certainly back to normal. \"Well I agree about the horse. Matter of fact I will see if they have something better for myself.\" While not flush, the outlaws had had a fair amount of cash and Pepper had some gold. Rooster was quite cheerful about that. It was not often that he had money to burn. Mattie did not realize that her story had gotten out until she was asked about it that evening at the hotel dining room. She thought that Rooster had spoken about it but he claimed innocence. \"Baby Sis, I just did some quiet drinking by myself last night. Didn't hardly speak to anyone. I reckon LaBoeuf must have let something slip when he was here.\" Mattie was not satisfied as she had become something of a minor celebrity around that town. She did not like it. The very next day the money for Ned Pepper was wired in by Western Union and Rooster happily collected it. He was not even put out by Mattie demanding that he immediately wire half of it to LaBoeuf's account in Texas. He stopped her by telling her that both he and LaBoeuf had agreed that one third of the $1000 would go to her for Tom Chaney since she had been the one to plant him. For one of the few times ever Mattie Ross was speechless. That got Rooster chuckling for the rest of the day. The following morning Mattie was determined to go and Rooster agreed; but saying they would not push it. So it took another week to reach the Ross ranch. As they rode up to the main house Mattie looked around; there was no movement; it was mid day and there should have been people around. Her little brother and sister; her mother; at least one of the hands. She paused a little bit before the yard. She looked at Rooster and saw that he was looking around very alertly; he had sensed it as well. He held up his hand- she knew he meant stay back while he checked it out. Surprisingly she found herself readily agreeing. Rooster was taking no chances; he had his rifle out with a round in the chamber as he rode into the yard before the house. He stopped and looked around very carefully. It was completely quiet. The doors and windows of the house were shut; not a sound came from the barn or the small bunkhouse. He decided to head for the bunkhouse first. He walked up and found the door open to his hand- carefully he moved in, ready to shoot. But it was empty. He looked hard; it did not look like it had been abandoned quickly. There were no clothes laying around or anything like it. He closed the door and headed for the house. He knocked on the front door and tried it- it was locked. The windows were closed and the drapes shut as well; he could not see anything. He walked around back and the same story there. He headed out front and waved Mattie in. She quickly rode up. \"Baby Sis there is no one here. But I see no signs that they left quickly. The house is locked up tight and all the drapes closed.\" Mattie was scared. This could not be good. She got off the horse and reached into her saddlebag. She found the key to the front door and headed towards it, Rooster with her and without his rifle, but with his hand on his pistol. She opened the door and they went inside; with the drapes pulled it was quite dark. She went to the foyer window and pulled the drapes back. Then into the main room at the front and did the same. They looked around and could not see a thing. She looked for a note or something; nothing. Fear slowly growing she went outside almost at a run, Rooster following. She ran up the small hill to the family cemetery. She stopped, panting, her eyes wide at what she saw. A new gravestone was there. On it was this. TOM ROSS 1836-1878 EMILY ROSS 1840-1878 Rest In Peace She sank down next to it and cried. Rooster stood off, sadly. Then slowly took off his hat. He looked around. This was a very nice ranch. Good cattle country; and he could see off to the south where they had fields that would be tilled and planted. He could see some cattle off in the distance. He did not know what other family Mattie had beyond her younger brother and sister. He did know that she needed him now more than ever; despite what she might think. Mattie slowly dried her tears. Just as slowly she stood up. She turned towards Rooster. \"This is a new stone; could not have been here more than a week or so. She must have died at least two weeks ago. She was healthy when I left.\" Rooster said softly. \"It's been more than a month since you left, Baby Sis. A lot can happen in a month. You know that.\" Slowly she nodded. She looked around and took a deep breath. \"We must go into town. They will know what happened.\" \"What other family do you have?\" \"Father has an older brother; but he is in poor health in St Louis. Mother had a sister but she died last year; her husband died before her; she was childless. I do not think there are any others; neither my father nor my mother were close to their families. They disagreed with them coming out west.\" Mattie forced herself to think. She and her brother and sister would be considered orphans. She looked around. Clearly action had been taken to sell off the chickens and everything else. She needed to contact Lawyer Dagget. She turned to Rooster. \"Lawyer Dagget will know what is going on. We must get to town.\" Rooster was glad to see some fire back in the girls eyes. But he was worried. NO family. This was not good. They headed out after Mattie carefully locked the front door and closed the drapes. Neither of them spoke – they just rode. It took them until nearly dusk to reach town. Mattie headed right for Lawyer Dagget's office. Luckily he was still there. He stood up as Mattie, closely followed by Rooster came in. \"Mattie, I am so very sorry for your loss. Your mother caught a fever only a week after you left and was gone in less than three days. I guess none of the telegrams I sent reached you. When I got the one from you I sent a reply.\" Mattie shook her head and sat down. Rooster stood behind her and laid a hand on her shoulder. \"I never got one. My Brother and Sister?\" \"They are well and staying with my wife and myself. I have sold off the livestock of the farm and laid off the hands. The cattle are being kept by Solemn Jones who has made an offer. I am checking with several sources to make sure it's a good one. Mattie, it will probably take some time for your farm to sell. Judge Rocker has left for the next two weeks; and will not make any decisions. He told me in confidence that he sees no reason to make any decisions for the time being. So we have time to make plans. Unfortunately your Fathers brother has never answered any of the letters or telegrams sent. I fear he has passed. Your mother was able to talk some before she died and told me that there was really no other family to be had. That makes the situation difficult.\" Mattie kept control of herself. \"I understand. I am glad you took the actions you did; I had been telling my father that our livestock was not of the best quality; and he was thinking of selling them off and starting over. As long as you got a good price that is fine. The same with the cattle. I will have to think. There are always alternatives if one can just think hard enough.\" Dagget nodded. He looked at Rooster. \"Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn I presume?\" \"At your service Mr Dagget. We would have gotten here a week earlier but Baby Sis here got bit by a rattler. Slowed us down some.\" Dagget looked at Mattie. \"She did not mention the bite in her telegram.\" \"It was not that important since I have recovered just about fully.\" Rooster decided the Lawyer deserved more than that. \"Actually she is the one that shot Chaney. With her fathers pistol.\" At Daggets raised eyebrow Mattie flushed slightly. \"I now know it was very foolish to insist to go along with Marshal Cogburn and Ranger LaBoeuf. But at the time it seemed the thing to do. I shot Tom Chaney in self defence; the recoil knocked me backward into a pit and I got bit by a rattlesnake. In the meantime Rooster and Laboeuf wiped out the Pepper gang; with Rooster doing most of it. But in the end justice was done. I would have preferred Chaney to hang, but what is done is done.\" At that moment several riders at a gallop went by the office, whooping and hollering. Mattie blinked and looked at Dagget, who frowned. \"Sheriff Johnson quit when a larger town offered him more money and he took both Deputies with him. He left two days ago and the word is spreading. The Mayor has wired the capital to send someone.\" He looked at Rooster. \"With you already here, Marshal, I would say you will be assigned.\" Rooster shrugged. \"So be it. If I can find a couple of men to watch my back, I can put the lid back on in short order.\" Dagget nodded and rose. \"The mayor is gathering willing men; but they need a leader and a territorial marshal is just what they need. I believe he is over at the general store now.\" Rooster looked at Mattie. \"Baby Sis, you go with the Lawyer and get some sleep while I handle things here.\" Mattie looked at him for a moment then stepped closer. \"Take care of yourself Rooster. I have lost too many people I care about already.\" Rooster tipped his hat and went outside to grab his rifle and head to the general store. Dagget looked at Mattie. \"How good is Marshal Cogburn? I have heard conflicting stories about him\" Mattie smiled softly. \"He can be foul mouthed and crude; and he drinks far too much. But he has True Grit; he faced four members of the Pepper gang and pepper as well across a field; he charged them alone and killed three of them, wounding Pepper who was finished off by a long shot from Ranger Laboeuf. After I was bit, he rode for 18 solid hours, mostly at night, to get me to a doctor. When it matters he is a man who stands tall.\" Dagget nodded; her tone said more than her actual words. Mattie Ross was no ones fool and very sharp and intelligent. Her regard for the Marshal was clear. Rooster strode into the General Store and found 8 men with shotguns waiting. \"I am Territorial Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn. If you men are willing we will go about restoring the peace and quiet here.\" A older man in a store suit came forward. \"I am Mayor Wilkins and I am very glad to see you, Marshal. I did not expect such fast action from the Capital.\" \"Mayor I came into town on other business but I can see where my duty lies; I was told your previous sheriff left and you needed help.\" \"That we do Marshal. These men will help.\" Rooster looked at them. \"First off- who has the keys to the town Jail?\" A man with a key ring came forward. \"Take three men and you will be the escort. I and the others will arrest the first ones and you will escort them to the jail and lock them up; one will stay behind to watch them. The rest will come back for more. We might have to make two or three trips but this town will be quiet by midnight. Any questions?\" There were none and Rooster and his posse headed out. Mattie and Dagget watched as Rooster and his men headed towards where the most noise was coming from. Mattie looked at Dagget. \"Rooster will be busy for a while. If you have no other business I would like to see my brother and sister.\" \"I was about to close anyway. So we will leave now.\" It only took two trips and one busted head by Rooster to quiet the town; word got out that a big and mean Territorial Marshal had arrived and that was enough. He looked around the town jail. Not bad at all. It had a fairly nice room off to the side that had what looked like a pretty comfortable bed. The building was made of stone and well built. It had iron shutters and the door was very heavy wood with iron plates on it. It would take a lot to break in. The cells were well built as well. He looked at the men who had helped him. \"Good job men. Well you can all head home. I doubt there will be any more trouble now that word has gotten out that the law is back. I will be here if anything else comes up.\" One of the men offered to take his horse to the town livery and Rooster nodded, just stopping to take his saddlebags off. He found some canned goods and such in the jail and coffee. He made a small meal then hit the sack. Mattie hugged her brother and sister; they had never been so glad to see her before. She talked softly to them and promised to take care of them then packed them off to bed. Her arm was still sore but it was getting better. She sat in her room and started to think about the situation. She had a couple of ideas she would talk to Lawyer Dagget about in the morning. She was up early and talked to her Lawyer. \"Mattie, you need a guardian. Simple as that. Now Judge Rocker will be willing to go along with any choice I make. I wish I could volunteer but Marsha is showing signs of Tuberculosis and we will need to move to a dry climate, probably Arizona soon. I have already contacted my old professor at Michigan and he has promised to find some possible replacements for me in this town. But that does not help you.\" Mattie sighed; there went plan one. Well part of plan one. Plan two now. \"Do not apologize for taking care of family; it has been brought to my attention just how important family is. I have a plan in mind. It will take some arranging but I believe it will work. I would rather stay in town, frankly; I never found life all interesting on the farm. My brother and sister would also benefit from the new school starting up.\" At that moment Mrs Dagget appeared and they talked about other things. The children were up before long and Mattie spent some time with them before leaving with Dagget to go back to town. Rooster was sitting at the desk in the Sheriffs office when Mattie came in. He had been sorting through some wanted posters. He motioned for her to sit down. \"Wasn't hard at all to put the lid back on this town. Only had to bust one head. They are all sleeping it off right now. Baby Sis, I know you well enough to figure that you already have several plans in mind. So what do you need me to do?\" Mattie took a deep breath. \"I plan to sell the farm and move into town; I prefer town life and the children will get a better education as the new school has a very well schooled teacher. The sale of the cattle should give me sufficient funds to buy the General Store. I have never thought it was very well run; and the owner wants to go back east. He was never suited to live out here. Unfortunately Lawyer Dagget will have to move soon to Arizona for his wifes health. My initial plan was to have him act as guardian until I reached 18, whereupon I could take care of myself and my brother and sister. So Rooster I would like to ask you to become our guardian. And I would suggest that you become Town Sheriff. It would be a much easier life than the one you now lead.\" Rooster blinked and thought about it. His time as a territorial Marshal was running out; sooner rather than later he would be told to retire. His pension would not be all that much. IT was true he would have an easier time here; and could last longer. He looked at Mattie. \"Baby Sis, you are right as usual. I know my time as a Marshal is running out; and I can remain Town Sheriff for a lot longer before I have to retire. I have not had family in so long that I really have no idea what it is. If I stay here I will have you; and I will be there for you and your brother and sister. So to me it looks like a pretty good deal. Shall we shake on it?\" Mattie's smile would have lit up the whole town. She reached for his hand and gave it a definite shake. \"Reuben J. Cogburn, I am glad I met you.\" \"Well Baby Sis, I am glad I met you.\"[Chapter 2] Mattie Ross contemplated her situation. One year after the deaths of her mother and father she had managed to keep her family together. With help from a certain one eyed sheriff. Lawyer Daggett had left town only two months after Mattie had returned; his wife needed to go to the dryer climate of Arizona to prevent her incipient consumption with getting worse. The ranch had been sold and all its livestock as well; Mattie was content with the deal. It had been more than sufficient to buy the General Store. Already under her management it was making a very good profit. Her brother and sister were doing well in the new school; the teacher was actually quite good. A graduate of the University of Iowa. Not an eastern school but still decent. Rooster was also doing well as the Town Marshall; with his reputation no one was going to make trouble. But she was feeling some discontent; and decided to figure out why. It took some thinking but she was able to realize that running a General Store was just not enough for her. With that in mind she began to look at other possibilities. Unfortunately they were few in this town. The only challenge that she could see would be the local bank. Unfortunately she did not have the financial ability to buy it. Still there was a possibility; right next to the store was a tavern that had gone out of business when the owner died. It was just empty; as far as she could find out he had no relatives. She was thinking on expanding the General store and that would fulfill that need nicely. She went to work on that. Rooster looked up as Mattie came in the door. By now he knew when she was about to start something. \"Well Baby Sis going to make a run at the Bank?\" \"If I had the financial resources I would. Unfortunately I do not. So I must think smaller. I wish to purchase the building next to the store and expand that way.\" Rooster thought on that. \"Makes sense. I sent out feelers on Old Man Johnson and managed to find out where he came from; originally Ohio, Columbus to be exact. From what the sheriff there said he had no family.\" Mattie nodded. \"That is good. I believe that I can petition the bank for ownership of it.\" \"More than likely; not like anyone else has shown interest.\" Lawyer Thompson was young but competent; and it did not take long for the arrangements to be finalized. In one month the addition was open and doing a very good business. With more space more goods were on display and that worked to the advantage of the proprietor. Mattie had gotten two letters so far from Ranger La Boef. Tall tales of course but interesting. She had written write back naturally. La Boef smiled as he read the letter from Mattie Ross. No surprise she had landed on her feet. About to become the town tycoon; he had no doubt of that. He looked at the other letter. And sighed. His father was in failing health; and his mother made it clear that his duty was to come home, quit the rangers, and run the family businesses. He knew very well that he was unsuited to business; the little details that were so important bored him. But family was family and he did have a duty not only to his family but to all the employees of the various businesses. The Ranch of course; and the General store and Livery and the freight company. Over 100 people depended on those businesses for their livelihood. What he needed was to find someone that was a good businessman and have him run the companies. However that would take time and frankly luck; finding someone not only honest but competent would not be easy. Then a thought struck him; it was very much one that he should have shrugged off right away; but it nagged at him and made him actually think on it. Mattie read the latest letter from La Boef with interest. \"My father is in failing health; my mother makes it clear that my duty is to come home, quit the Ranger Service and run the family businesses. But I know that I am not qualified to do so. So I must find someone to do it.\" Mattie thought on this. He had described the various enterprises that the La Boef family owned. It was in Houston, one of the largest cities in Texas. It would require a good businessman to continue to run them at a profit considering the clear competition that would come in such a big city. Finding someone honest and able would not be easy. Rooster sighed; he was getting bored. His reputation, especially after almost singlehandedly wiping out the Pepper Gang, had prevented anyone from seriously challenging him. And that was getting old. Outside of an occasional drunk and such he had nothing to do. Mattie sighed. Even expanding the store was little more than extra work; no challenge at all. She looked down from her window at the Sheriff's office across the street. She knew that Rooster was getting bored; and soon that would lead to drinking and other problems. La Boef sighed. So far his attempts to find someone to run the businesses had been an abject failure; no one suitable had appeared. He went back to his wild idea; more and more it looked like the only possibility. But how to write that letter? Mattie read the letter for the third time and still could not believe it. She sat and thought for a long time; then headed out. Rooster right away could see that something had really startled her. Which in itself was very rare. \"Baby Sis, I have a feeling you have been surprised.\" \"You are correct Rooster. I just got a letter from Ranger La Boef. Read it and see what you think.\" And handed him the letter. Rooster pulled out his spectacles and sat back and read. \"Mattie. This is without a doubt the strangest and most difficult letter I have ever written. I have spent almost a week trying to find a way to do it right. In the end I realize that you prefer straightforward speech to any other and here it is. I have been unable to find anyone that can run the family business; my father has probably less than a year to live; and some of that time he will be unable to do anything at all. So my time is short. I had a very unusual thought; I sat on it and tried to ignore it but as time went by I realized that I had to at least try. Reading between the lines of your letters I sense that you find no challenge at all in running a small town general store. Which is no surprise to me at all. Mattie Ross, I greatly admire you in many ways. Your courage and grit and intelligence; and your unwavering determination. So here is my offer. Marry me and run the family businesses. I understand you are only 16 but I have no doubt that you can do it and do it well. It will be the challenge I believe you want. As my wife there will be no difficulty in you running the various businesses; before a month is out they will all be aware of how much you are better at it than I can ever be. Honestly better than father was. I have no doubt you can do better as a husband than me. But I believe that you would have a good life here doing what you do best; become a tycoon. My true Regards Samuel Johnson La Boef Rooster slowly took off his spectacles and shook his head. Now this was a shock. He looked at Mattie who had composed herself and was as usual calm and unreadable. \"Got to admit this has shocked me. But I can see his point. You would be the one to run those businesses.\" Mattie nodded. \"I agree. I want this challenge. But what worries me is that to be honest how good a wife will I be? Rooster, I am honest enough to know that few men would want to marry one such as me.\" \"Baby Sis, you are a good looking young woman with fire and smarts. A real man would not be scared away.\" \"No one has shown interest here.\" \"Well not like there is much to choose from.\" \"That is true.\" Rooster grinned. \"I can already see that you have made up your mind.\" She sighed. She had to agree. She had indeed already decided to do it. \"There is much to do. Have to sell the Store and make arrangements to move.\" \"Not hard for you Baby Sis.\" Mattie was worried about Rooster; in all ways that mattered he was family. She decided to bring that up in the letter that she was writing; matching La Boef she was straight and honest. \"Samuel. I believe it is time to be on a first name basis with the man who will be my husband. As I guess you are not surprised to know, it did not take me long to agree with your proposal. I liked that you were honest and straightforward. I do indeed look forward to the challenge. On another matter, I believe you could also do better than I as regards a wife. I am not a simpering miss and my tolerance for the so called social skills is very low. But I promise you that I will do the best as I can as wife and partner to you. My one concern is Rooster; he needs more of a challenge then becoming a town Marshall. I fear boredom will lead to him taking up the bottle again and the troubles that would follow that. He is family to me now; beyond being me and my brother and sisters legal guardian. \"Your Intended Mattie Ross.\" La Boef smiled as he read the letter; a great weight was lifted off of his shoulders. He thought about Rooster; in a stroke of good luck he had an idea that should keep him from getting bored. Mattie read the letter with growing happiness. La Boef had clearly written right away upon receiving her acceptance of his proposal. \"My Intended. Mattie I believe you are underestimating yourself as a wife and mother. But that is for the future to show. I look forward to our marriage and life together. As regards Rooster there is a proposal I think he would find interesting. The county that Houston is in is quite large; and the county Sheriff is only given a few deputies to watch over many hundreds of square miles. The Result is that there is very little law outside of the towns. Rustling and other problems abound. There has been put between the larger ranch owners and business owners to employ what would be called regulators; a private law and order company. I think Rooster would do that job quite well. It would not be of the same physical challenge as a Territorial Marshal, but would be varied and busy. Looking Forward to the Day Samuel\" One month later the Store had been sold at a good price and they were on their way. The last letter that Mattie got before leaving was the first one that had anything that really concerned her. \"Mattie. My mother is not entirely in favor of all of this; she thinks you are too young. You will have some work to do there to get her to see the light. But I have confidence in you.\" La Boef sighed. His mother was a very stubborn woman. She and Mattie would be well matched. Mattie took a deep breath as the train stopped. They had gone to Kansas City and then from there south to Houston. Rooster was up and out and waiting to help her step down. Her brother and sister were right behind her; Rooster holding them back as he saw La Boef coming. Mattie raised her chin and walked towards the man she would be marrying in a few days. La Boef smiled at her. Then pulled her forward and thoroughly kissed her. A somewhat dazed Mattie blinked at him. Then smiled. This would work. ","Summary":" Rooster Cogburn waited and watched as the doctor worked on Mattie.

My mother, I know she loves me with all of her heart but she wants me married off as soon as she can. She think that people can see passed my arm… well that is see passed my missing arm. \"Mattie Ann, Mr. alto is here!\" my mother called for me. my sister sat on the bed next to me. She was all dressed up ready to go for her date that still had not yet showed. \"I hope the one is at least half-way normal I can't stand another that only wants to \"save me from my debts and burdens that I have.\" The next one that says that to me is going to lose a tooth\" Victoria became lost in her laugh. \"Mattie you have to lean to give people a chance. Not everyone is judgmental of your arm.\" She arose from the bed. \"Lets go see about this Mr. Alto.\" She waltzed out of the room. I flowed her but, but I was not nearly as graceful as her. at the front porch with mama stood Mr. Alto he was in a fancy riding outfit, there was a shiny badge on his shoulder. \"Miss. Ross it's very nice to meet you.\" He held out his hand, as did I. \"why don't you and Henry go walk around till supper is ready.\" Henry smiled and took my arm as we walked. \"Mattie, I have never seen a woman wear trousers to a date.\" I took a breath, and told myself Mattie it will be okay just one harmless observation. \"I don't like skirts, so they have been eliminated until Sundays.\" He frowned. \"So you do most of the business for your family, I'm guessing you don't like it do you-\" I stopped him \"No I love doing the books and negotiating over the cotton price I love doing that kind of stuff it brings me joy.\" He let go of my arm. \"You don't need any help in life do you?\" I shook my head. My temper had busted. \"Not every girl needs her prince. I never read fairy tales as a kid so I never wanted a prince and all you want is to sweep some helpless girl off her feet and I'm sorry but I am not that kind of girl, so you can go back to fort smith.\" \"How did you know?\" he seemed shock that I could even read. \"You badge is a dead giveaway and when you get back will you tell Rooster hello for me.\" he looked as if he was about to fall over dead. \"Yes I know Rooster he saved my life. Now get going.\" He walked to the house and then went in. I turned to the barn and stared to head to it. Once I approached it I when in to the stalls and my horse Boeuf was looking at me. When little backie died I had to get a new one so I named him after LaBoeuf. Whenever I was riding him he made me think of the old day back in Fort Smith. \"Boeuf I think it's time I write him a letter. Don't you think? I mean I have not made contact with the man who helped saved my life. Don't you agree.\" I rubbed his nose and gently kissed it. \"Thanks for the advice.\" I walked to the cabin. Thinking of ideas in my head but right before I walked in I looked up at the sky and saw the sun starting to set. I liked to set out here sometimes and just look at it, the way the colors filled the sky just made me tickle inside and this never happens normally. I just imagined back when I was with LaBoeuf and Rooster and how we rode off into the sunset. I saw a man riding tortes the house. I rubbed my eyes and to my surprise it was real. I could not tell who it could be, my mind stared to wonder. The stranger got closer and closer then I heard the memorable sound of spurs hitting against the horse. My eyes widened a thought was drawn up in my head could it be LaBoeuf. Once he slowly arrived at my porch he lifted his hat. \"Well Miss. Mattie Ross boy have you grown!\" he sat his hat down on the railing on the porch. \"Now aren't you going to let your dear ol pal in your house?\" he just stood there. \"Well Mr. LaBoeuf it's nice to see you too. Yes I'm doing well. Really yes I would love to invite you in to my house if I had an advance notice that you were coming!\" I pointed a finger at him. \"Now will you ask nicely I might just consider letting a Texas bush-popper like you in my house.\" \"How could you ever think about denying the man that helped save your life not come in your house?\" I just rolled my eyes. \"I'm happy to deny you! You know you have not written me or visited in me about three years so why do you think you should just come now?\" I slowly opened the door, \"come on in you lazy Texas ding bat!\" He gave me a smile and walked in. his blond hair glistened in the sun as did his bright blue eyes. They still had sparkle in them after all these years, he never changed. A/N well hello there for all of those who commented on it the first time and told me it was too forced or Mattie was way out of character, I reread it and ya'll were totally right. I decide to rewrite it and try it at a different angle and I took all of your advice and try to make it fit better. Please tell me what you think about it and I promise I will make other chapters longer and the story will get way better as it goes on. But just keep reviewing and I will always keep you ideas and always try to work them in. thank you for reading. ~ rainbow head band that loves glee~[Chapter 2] A.N.: okay so who ever is reading this story hope y'all like it and sorry it took so long I have had really bad writes block for this story dory hope y'all like it. \"LaBoeuf, wait Mr.-\" he was already in the house staring to walk to mama to great her. But then he saw Mr. alto. He paused and walked back to me. \"Dose little miss Mattie had a new boyfriend?\" he joked, but I refused to take it lightly. \"That is my mother next suitor for me that I kicked to the curb as you are about to be. Keep your mouth shut, do not mention anything about marriage suitors to her or you will be the next one she randomly chooses And that would certainly be more unpleasant then… well… being married to Mr. Alto.\" He let a chuckle go. \"Well I do think it's time you get a suitor; I know you must hate being alone, and what about your sister you don't want to cause a scandal with her being married before you do.\" I looked at him and I cool feel the rage rush to my face and my tong suddenly became shaper than a two sided Arkansas pick. \"Listen here Mr. LaBoeuf, I do believe that everyone in this town know I have canceled out ever man in this town who wishes to be my husband and most for the counties soundings us. Don't you even bring my sister in to this she had no part taking in this conversation so just be quite? Second why are you even bothering me, you ugly low down Texas bush popper.\" He threw up his hands. \"Okay you can insult me all you would like but please just keep Texas out of it she has done nothing to you.\" I came back with a sharp line. \"Actually she committee the biggest crime she gave us you, Mr. I'm- so-big-cause-I'm- a-Texas-ranger. Yes if Texas was never discovered my life would be much easier.\" He laughed. \"Then who would have saved you and roosters life back in our hunt for Cumberland?\" \"Rooster and I could do just fine.\" I crossed my arms. By this time Mr. Alto had left and I had just noticed. My mother walked up to us in our conversation. She had decided, since all we were focused on were each other, to barge into our conversation. \"Well you must be the famous Mr. LaBoeuf , Mattie Ann has told me all about you, it's a pleaser to meet you but may I ask why bring you out to these parts? I mean after all you are a Texas Ranger aren't you?\" he took off his hat in respect and held out his rough callused hand to mama. \"Yes ma'am but I have come to visit Miss. Mattie since I have not seen her since in Fort Smith; I believed it was time to see how she was getting along.\" Mama took his hand and gave it a shake, \"You do not mind do you Mrs. Ross, if I can in at an inappropate time I will come back at a later date, if you would like.\" Mama threw up her hand. \"No, no, no you stay; I need to go tend to the animals anyways so you too go catch up.\" LaBoeuf gave mama his bright shining smile. I felt week at the knees, I refused to believe that it was due to his goofy grin \"Well Mattie Ann, wow I should have guessed it.\" I gave him a playful slap. \"Never call me by that, you hear! You … TEXAS JAYBIRD! Never call me that!\" I walked off to the stove and cut it off. \"Would you like to meet Victoria, I bet she would love to meet you!\" he shook his head. \"Mattie I have some news that I think you really need to hear.\" I sat down on the bed ready to let him talk, but he was interrupted by a gun shot. BANG! BANG! BANG! I jumped from my seat on my bed and raced outside, LaBoeuf was right beside me. he had his gun out. I stared over to the barn, along with LaBoeuf, soon I heard the foot light footsteps of Victoria and little frank. My mother was spared out on the ground. She was cover in a pool of a cinnamon substance. A hole was right in her stomach. She was slowly dying in front of me. I grabbed her and kissed her forehead, \"I love you Mamma.\" Victoria and Little frank sat down next to me LaBoeuf took off his hat in respect. Her famous smile come upon her face and she slowly closed her ocean blue eyes for the last time. I could not move. I felt as my sole had died with her. I felt as if just my shell was here to give comfort to my brother and sister. Vicky began to weep over mother warm, blood covered body. Little frank sat there just as I did, just as if he had died at that moment to. Mr. LaBoeuf kneeled down beside me. he put his arm around me, he knew how if felt I don't know how but he did.

Another, what will be considerably longer, fix fic. None of the other chapters are going to be quite as HUGE as this one, though there will be a lot of time between updates (I am a busy beaver this semester) and I want each chapter to be a satisfying read on its own. This follows up 'Oh How Bright the Path' in some ways, and uses elements and facts from the Portis novel while generally following the 2010 movie canon. NOTE: Everything LaBoeuf writes about in the letters of this chapter really did happen to the detachment of Texas Ranger Frontier Battalion Company C at Ysleta, El Paso County, later the made main body of Company A, between the years of 1878 and 1881. And to the Texas Rangers in general. Prologue (\"Time just gets away from us.\") The envelope had what appeared to be a coffee stain on its upper right corner. Or else that was liquor, I could not quite be sure. I inspected it more closely. The vowels of Dardanelle, Yell County were smudged somewhat. I lifted it surreptitiously under my nose to detect the faint scent of Bull Durham smoking tobacco. I had found the envelope tucked between a letter from the Woodson Brothers in Little Rock, and another from the Vicksburg & Gulf Steamship Company. It was postmarked from Ysleta del Sur Pueblo, El Paso County, Texas. \"Is there anything else I can do for you, Ms. Ross?\" I glanced up through the service window. The post office clerk stood there with his fingers tented and brow pinched. He was a short, balding man, a prominent overbite to match his somewhat overbearing manner. I write the honorific out as Ms. because that is how he said it, though I had only turned fifteen at the beginning of the month and was yet some years away from securing my spinster status. But he was also one of the few people in Dardanelle who had mastered the skill of staring at my face while speaking to me, rather than at my pinned-up sleeve. I understood that the rest of them did not do this on purpose and admittedly the sight took some getting used to, but it was something I had grown quickly tired of. \"No. That will be all, Mr. Hughes. Thank you.\" I tucked the mail beneath my arm and walked out. The street had been churned to mud by the March rains, and it was about two miles down this road from the center of town to our farm. I found the walk invigorating, pleasant enough in the mild air, though my boots became stuck very often in the slurry. I had not yet found a horse accommodating enough to let me mount him from the right side, which of course it would be necessary for me to do. I arrived home to find two others enjoying the spring day. My brother was sitting on the front porch of our ranch house, sharing some oat bread rolls and a hoop of cheese with another round-faced boy whose name I did not remember at the time. Little Frank sat up straighter when I came into the yard. He was only three years and some months my junior, really, but still tried to put on that guileless, innocent expression you do not see in most children past the age of six. \"Frank, what are you doing home from school?\" He swallowed a mouthful of food and pondered his answer. \"I forgot my lunch pail.\" \"No, you did not. I handed it to you this morning.\" I must tell you that lying did not suit my brother's character in the slightest. He had inherited our mother's almost painful honesty and could not have told a decent fib to save himself. So rather than dig the grave any deeper, he dropped his eyes right then and muttered, \"That dried-up old stickler Ms. Brandonnberg sent me home.\" Privately I thought Linnea Brandonnberg something of a \"stickler\" myself. She had been the schoolteacher here in Dardanelle for going on five years now, yet still flew into a perennial passion over the fact that her male students had better things to do during the harvest and planting seasons than sit inside doing arithmetic. A formal education is valuable enough, yes, but it is my personal opinion that work ethic is to be held above all else. One learns principally by doing rather, not watching. I had no plans of telling Frank this for the moment. \"And why did she send you home?\" The other boy, who had been content with stuffing our bread into his face until now, decided to speak up. \"Because Frank don't take no guff offa no skirts, that's why.\" \"Tom, you are a big fat-headed snitch!\" Frank elbowed his friend hard in the ribs. The boy nearly choked. \"Keep your mouth shut.\" \"But it's true! She sassed you for not reciting the passage right, then you said real quiet-like, 'I don't take no guff offa no skirts.' You're the one who should keep his mouth shut, not me!\" \"Well, that gray-haired alligator gar shouldn't have gotten so mad in the first place. I had the words close enough, didn't I?\" \"I told you you did.\" I watched this exchange with mounting irritation. I had remembered the other boy's name now. He was Thomas Cain, who lived with his aunt and uncle further down the river. I raised my voice to cut through their cajoling. \"What was the passage you did not memorize, Frank?\" Reminded of my unwelcome presence, his expression soured again. \"John 15:13.\" \"That is a central tenements of the Lord's teachings.\" \"Yeah, yeah. That's about what Ms. Brandonnberg told me in front of everybody. In about the same words, too.\" \"How did you quote it?\" Frank, clearly in distress and not a little embarrassed now, gave a sigh and delivered the line with as much exasperation as possible. \"'Greater love hath no man than to lay down his life for a friend.'\" \"That is likely the Webster translation,\" I sniffed. \"And do you have it correctly, now?\" His next words were even more colorless, if that was at all possible. \"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for a friend.'\" Tom had been watching me with wide-set green eyes, and scrunched his face up in distaste. \"Aw, they're practically the same anyhow. I think Frank was close enough not for you to be splitting hairs over it, Mattie.\" \"And which piece of Scripture did you mangle, Thomas Cain?\" I realized that both of them were spattered with black mud all the way from their shirtsleeves down to their trousers. \"Not that Linnea Brandonnberg is in any want of reasons for your expulsion.\" \"Oh. Tom put a frog in Ms. Brandonnberg's desk after she yelled at me. We'd been saving it in a jar for a special occasion,\" Frank answered, in a way that was almost boasting. \"And he said he likes Mama's bread better than the stuff his aunt makes.\" Tom nodded and took a large bite to prove his point. Those oats had cost me two dollars a pound at the store. \"Mm-hmm. Hers tastes like tree bark.\" \"Tom, you never ate tree bark in your life.\" \"No. But I have eaten grass, and dirt, and bugs, and I figure tree bark would taste about like a good mix of the three.\" \"Joseph Atkinson dared us both twenty cents to eat those,\" Frank confided to me, as though he had forgotten who his audience was. His dark hair was disheveled. His up-turned nose, a feature we had in common, gave a sniff that I took to be the first sign of a cold. Tom grinned. \"And we got his nickels right enough, didn't we, Frank?\" \"Go home, Thomas,\" I ordered. \"And Frank, wash yourself up before you track that into the house. I will deal with you later. A man who does not know his Holy Scripture backwards and forwards is easy prey for vice.\" \"Well,\" Frank grumbled as he got to his feet, \"Papa would have said I got it close enough.\" Thomas, meanwhile, had pocketed the rest of the bread rolls. As he made ready to leave, he said in a voice low enough that he likely did not think I could hear him, \"Frank Ross don't take no guff offa no skirts.\" Frank snorted, turning away to walk towards the side yard. \"Shut it, Tom. You're going to get me in real trouble some time.\" They parted ways. I stood on the porch until Thomas had passed through our front gate, my glare on his back all the while and my boots heavy on the weather-beaten boards. I went inside. Papa's office was a narrow room on the ground floor, towards the front of our house so that visitors would not be tempted to snoop. Its walls were sage green above wainscot paneling. A small cast-iron stove, which had also served as his bill incinerator, squatted in the corner. The room's only furniture was a hoop-back chair and a Carlton House desk kept with military precision. Its single westward facing window had no curtains. I stood at this one window for a moment and observed my brother as he made a sopping mess of himself at the water pump. Hair, face, back and legs were all given their turn beneath bursts of cold groundwater as it shot from the iron spigot. Our dog Samson came running up to lap at the puddles created, and became rather soaked himself. Frank laughed. Then I sat down at the desk and began sorting through our mail. This was accomplished by placing one side of each envelope under a heavy book, to hold it in place as I slit it open. Apparently it requires two hands to work a letter opener in the ordinary fashion. And to braid hair, and peel apples, and roll cigarettes, and lace boots. It is interesting, all of the things you do not think about under ordinary circumstances. The letter from Howard and John Woodson detailed potential buyers for our cotton this coming year, most of them big textile mills in New England, and confirmed that they would be paid a three percent commission at season's end. Most planters after the war between the States only allowed two and a half percent to be taken out. Papa had always been generous in his business dealings. The other envelopes contained a check from Mr. Matthew Richards, in exchange for the hundred acres of land I had sold him once I realized we could not afford the workers needed to harvest it, and a Bill of Lading from the captain of a Vicksburg & Gulf steamboat. This formally acknowledged that he had received our small freight of bell beans, a winter cover crop Papa had thought of trying to replenish the soil, and would deliver it on schedule. I had already sent a dock warrant on ahead to Pine Bluff. Finally I came to the letter from El Paso and slit it wide. More of that tobacco smell puffed out when I did. I shook the envelope a few times until its contents fell onto the desk. The handwriting was squared and pragmatic. Words marched across the page in a way reminiscent of posts in a fence. 20 February 1878 Miss Ross, I am writing because my attempts to reach Cogburn through the U.S Marshal's office at Ft. Smith have been unsuccessful. I would give him his portion of the reward that is due – one third of the Bibbs family's $1500 for Chelmsford/Chaney dead, in keeping with the particulars of our agreement. The additional state bounty put up by Gov. Hubbard stipulated that Chaney be brought back alive, so we will not be seeing any of that. If you have information as to Cogburn's whereabouts you would do well in relaying it to me. Signed, Sgt. LaBoeuf, Representing Texas Ranger Frontier Battalion Detachment of Co. C I needed to read this letter over several times. Not because it was at all difficult to decipher, no, but because it took that amount of time for me to get a proper feel for its tone. I flipped it over, then right-side up again. It was written in pencil on what I guessed to be newsprint. From the back of the house, I heard Frank come plodding through the door and start pulling off his boots in the kitchen. Victoria's hoarse, questioning voice called out from the bedroom we shared. Mama, I figured, was with her, or else in bed herself. Opening a drawer, I snatched up a leaf of foolscap paper. One corner of it was set beneath the book, because I could not use my left hand to keep it in place. I drew out a pen. Plunged it into the blue ink well. The steel nib made slicing, decisive noises as it turned copperplate loops across the page. Friday, March 22nd, 1878 Dear Sgt. LaBoeuf, Representing Texas Ranger Frontier Battalion Detachment of Co. C, Whenever I propose to go about extracting information from a former acquaintance, I at least have the decency to exchange a few pleasantries before the arm-twisting can begin in earnest. Texans, I gather, do not receive any kind of instruction regarding this social practice. Therefore I am speaking for the both of us when I ask: What cheer? It is quiet here in Arkansas. I am anticipating a good season for cotton. The Farmer's Almanac predicts there will be no early frosts this year, and of course frost is enough to turn any crop from fair to strict low middling condition overnight. How does this letter find you? Yours finds my family well enough, though Victoria has a cough and Mama will sometimes spend afternoons in bed if I let her. Frank is being a nuisance. Our dog bit Mr. DuBois in the ankle last Thursday, which I take as further evidence that he is an uncommonly excellent judge of character: the dog, that is. Not the banker. As you can see, these questions are not so difficult to ask, or answer. Basic civilities now attended to, I will tell you what I have been able to gather about Rooster from Mr. Chen Lee and my own personal inquiries. Here is what happened. Three weeks after our return from the Indian Territory in early December, the Marshal Reuben J. Cogburn shot Odus Wharton dead in Fort Gibson. You may recall Wharton as that man who broke jail in Fort Smith, the one they had on trial. (It is a pity you missed Lawyer Goudy having it out with Rooster on the witness stand. It was an entertaining thing to watch.) Wharton was a convicted man, a fugitive besides, but Rooster also killed two men who were with him and this drew enough criticism that he was pressed by Chief Deputy Upham to surrender his badge. He has since relocated to San Antonio and is working for the stockmen's association as a range detective. Along with the rest of my hundred dollar reward, Rooster has received a personal check for two hundred dollars from Lawyer Daggett. I am pleased to hear you are making good on your agreement as well. I find his relocation to Texas odd; during one of our conversations, Rooster had mentioned disliking the territory. He said there is an average of six trees per hundred square miles out there, and everything that grows has got barbs all over it. I had thought maybe he would go to Illinois. His son Horace and first wife are purportedly there. But then, there is no telling what is in the minds or hearts of men. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross I ended this signature with a harsh stab, peeved that there were no dipping or curling letters in my name where a flourish might be added. The papers were waved about until the ink dried, folded up into somewhat uneven fourths, then slipped into an envelope which I held open with two fingers. Then I rose from my seat and went to give Victoria a spoonful of the cough syrup I had made, a rather frightful tonic gotten from onion juice and sugar left to sit in a jar. It was an old farm recipe and very effective. Mama got out of bed with some prodding on my part. I found her curled up under a quilt she had gotten as a wedding present. I mailed the letter three days later – the postage rate back then, as I recall, was $0.02 per half ounce – and forgot about it. 29 April 1878 Mattie, Because you insist on knowing, I will oblige you – your letter finds me short-tempered, and indecisive as to whether I should beat myself senseless against a hitching post or toss back a bottle of Prvt. Rutherford's whiskey to achieve a similar result. That is cheer for you these days. Last June, an El Paso judge by the name of Howard – also referred to by certain individuals as the Greased Pig – took it upon himself to privatize several salt lakes near the Guadalupe Mountains. Previously, residents from along the Rio Grande had been able to take wagon loads of salt from the deposits there and haul it off to be sold. They did this whenever they pleased and free of charge, as there was no claim on the land and so no owner to pay charges to. No doubt you read about all this in the newspapers, but I must explain so you understand my situation. Because Greased Pigs will do as Greased Pigs will do, Howard saw the opportunity and used his contacts in Austin to buy up some land certificates. He demanded any further access to the salt lakes occur only through business with him. As you can imagine, this set Mexicans and settlers on both sides of the river in an uproar. A number of people were killed. Purportedly it was over the salt, but of course it was really over who ought to have owned the land, and who really did own the land, and who could decide which was which. I returned from detached service in mid December – in time to hear of 2nd Lt. Tays shaming our battalion, to say nothing of the Ranger troop as a whole, when he chose to surrender Howard and those two bondsmen to Barela's firing squad at San Elizario rather than fight outnumbered. Even pigs do not deserve being handed over to their deaths like that. Prvt. Marsh put it best when he said the only difference between Lt. Tays and a skunk is that a skunk has a white streak down his back. I would add that I have never seen Tay's bare back for myself, so he may not even have this in his favor. Howard's death pretty well ended the fighting itself. Gov. Hubbard had Maj. Jones organize a board along with colonels King and Lewis. They conferred on March 16. They concluded the state had lost close to $31000 all told, but more importantly decided that Mexico was to honor extradition papers for fugitives and make reparations for the damage inflicted by rioters. Also that those who had been involved in the revolt be delivered for trial in Texas. Now it may surprise you to learn I speak some patchy Spanish. My father spent time in Santa Fe during his youth, back before he was elected to the legislature of Lamar County. He made a go at teaching the language to my siblings and myself, with varied results. A while back I made the mistake of letting this information slip to Prvt. Lloyd, and I suspect it was that squirrel-headed cuss who gave my name up to Maj. Jones. So that is why I have been tossed along the frontier from Saragossa to Ft. Quitman during this previous month - to aid negotiations. My tongue still gives me trouble on occasion and leads to some muddled pronunciation. When he was done laughing, I found out that one old caballero with whom I had been arguing for a good half hour spoke perfect English. But do not think I have forgotten our friend Cogburn. I have sent his $500 to San Antonio along with a package – this contained a prickly pear cactus, and a note both welcoming him to the state and saying you had mentioned how awful fond he was of it. Signed, LaBoeuf Tuesday, May 16th, 1878 Dear LaBoeuf, the Tongue-Tied Caballero, I have enclosed a recent issue of The National Temperance Advocate, of which I am an avid reader, and recommend consulting it should you think about reaching for the liquor cabinet again. My grandmother is right in saying men will live like billy goats if left to their own devices. And they will fight over salt, too, as it would seem. Those sorts of conflicts must not be construed to be anything but what they are, which is wasteful foolishness. How thoughtful of you to send Rooster a gift along with his money. You are taking further steps towards a lasting friendship: though I was never able to understand why such enmity grew up betwixt you two in the first place. It seems to me you should have been \"pards\" from the beginning. Besides a striking similarity in lifestyles, you have a shared predilection for making your jobs sound much harder than they actually are. You are acting as a diplomat. There is nothing so trying in it. When I say I have hired on a tenant family and set aside 30 acres for them to work, or that we must finish planting cotton by the end of this month if we are to have a harvest come September, I simply say the thing and let my listener infer its relative difficulty. For your addled tongue, I will refer you to the following as a daily exercise: \"There sits those thousand thinkers thinking how three thoughtless thieves got through.\" It ought to keep you busy for a piece. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross Post Script: I gleaned from a minor article in the Galveston Daily News (Sam Levy of Levy's Wholesale Mercantile hails from down there, and gets it specially delivered) that your skunkish companion Tays is retiring from the Ranger force. Perhaps this will alleviate your suffering some. 6 July 1878 Mattie, For once the Galveston Daily has gotten it right. Our detachment at Ysleta will receive a new lieutenant by the summer of next year. In the meantime, commanding duties are to be divided between Sgt. Ludwick and I. Tays himself went off to enter the customs service. I will not respond to your goading remarks about lifestyle or occupation. With this lethargic mail system, any returning quip I make would have long lost its edge by the time it reached you. But the Texas & Pacific is expected to come through El Paso – or else the Southern Pacific, whichever railway gets here first. We are looking forward to the race – within four years. Then mail will not take a month or more to achieve its postmarked destination. Though the heat is another reason everything moves slowly this time of year. It gets so hot at midday that if you go out riding, you must stop intermittently to soak your horse's bit in cold water – or else the metal will burn his tongue. That is why most traveling is done by night during the summer. There is such light from the moon and stars that you can see your own shadow, so the dark presents no real disadvantage. And to those in the southern states who provide the consolation that what we have here is a 'dry' heat, I always recommend sticking their heads into a brick oven. Signed, LaBoeuf Saturday, August 10th, 1878 Dear LaBoeuf, Tall Tale Teller Extraordinaire, You are exaggerating about the horse's bits, I think. I have come to understand that this inclination towards grandiose storytelling can be found in all Texans. I was once told by Aaron Walker, who is the deputy in Russellville and passed a few years driving cattle up the Shawnee, that whenever the chuck wagon ran out of salt he would lick the horse's sweat from his saddle instead. I expect you also carved the Rio Grande out with a stick and take women who ride giant catfish for your paramours. Concerning the package that should accompany this letter: our tenant and his wife gave me a pair of deerskin gloves to compensate for coming up short on their rent. As they have promised to give a fourth of their cotton crop after this season's harvest (fourth being the regular portion to give – corn is farmed in thirds) and I know they are honest Christian people who make good on such promises, I let them keep their money and took only the gloves. They are too large to fit Little Frank or myself. Perhaps you can make use of them: after adding some frivolous tassels, of course. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross 19 October 1878 Mattie, The deerskin gloves are appreciated. We have been helping to put up fences for some farmers and thick hide is good against the barbed wire. Our official job is to patrol for 'fence cutters', a title the free grass men have been earning for themselves lately, but we usually do this by shifts and in the meantime help repair damaged stretches of fence. The gloves are also well-suited for handling my rattlesnake lasso, which I might as well admit to owning – seeing as how you are convinced I am one of those ridiculous caricatures, created first by our national press during the Mexican War and currently running amok in dime novels. Signed, LaBoeuf Wednesday, November 27th, 1878 Dear LaBoeuf, Wrangler of the Open Range, I do not see you as a caricature. I see you for exactly what you are and take great care in addressing you as such. It is no special treatment on my part. I do it with everyone. And in case you do not believe this, I will share the following example. This Tuesday I greeted my first (and very likely last) marriage suitor. He was a Mr. Edward Woodson, nephew to the Woodson Brothers who are our cotton factors over in Little Rock. He was very frank with me; he said that in spite of the fact that I am two social stations above a sharecropper, young yet, and even with my being \"physically incomplete\" besides, if I were willing to take his name my family's financial struggles would be at an end. I thanked him for his honesty and responded likewise. I told him finances are in fact in respectable condition. Our harvest this year was 120 pounds of cotton per acre (that is one-quarter of a single 480 pound bale, where most planters only muster up one-fifth), which with our 350 acres of land and cotton selling at ten cents per pound should have meant an earning of $4,200 dollars, or $4,074 once the factor's commission was paid. Furthermore, I pointed out to Mr. Woodson that he would know this better than anyone: as it was clear he and his uncles had given me $4,053 at season's end. Which meant they had put aside a 3.5% commission for themselves, instead of 3% as has been our long-standing agreement. And if he thought he could nickel and dime my family out of our bread money before attempting an outright land grab, then I was left with a choice of either breaking his head with an iron skillet or simply shooting him dead where he stood. As he could see, I still had a hand and arm enough for those activities. (Needless to say, that I have since made plans to move our business to another factor.) I also told the young Mr. Edward Woodson he had a nose like a potato. No woman with an ounce of brains in her head would marry a nose like that. Mama agreed with me afterward. I told him this because he carried himself with the ostentatious bearing of someone who had never heard an honest remark about his appearance in his life, and because that is really what it looked like. And if you had a nose resembling a potato, or a root vegetable of any kind for that matter, I would tell you so too. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross I had not been sure what to make of the little package Mr. Hughes passed me through the service window. My walk home confirmed that it was something hard, dense, cold even through the stiff brown paper it was wrapped up in. I inspected the bundle for a few concentrated moments, standing in the office with rainwater puddling around my feet. It must have cost a hefty sum in postage. Then I left the package to sit there waiting for me, next to a typewriter that now took up part of the space. I went outside to feed our pigs. Victoria assisted me at the trough, tossing bread crusts and extra potato peels to a sow she claimed was especially friendly. Of course I knew very well that pigs are friendly to anyone who feeds them, but did not tell her so. Victoria inquired as to what my favorite hymnal was. She had not gotten me a gift, she explained soberly, but to pass the time she would like to sing me something. I told her I was partial to \"Leaning on the Everlasting Arms\", and this was sung on mostly warbling notes as we pestered brooding chickens for their eggs. Our breath eddied out of us in frozen huffs, like smoke, our slickers adhering to our shoulders and arms under the heavy, hissing rain. Frank came out to join us in cleaning the horse's stalls. I assigned myself the task of standing in the loft and hefting the damp, sweet-smelling hay down into their waiting hands below. I needed to grasp the pitchfork very high up, with the rest of the handle tucked under my arm, in order to achieve the right leverage. The labor quickly made my back and shoulders start to burn, so I doubled my efforts. Victoria continued singing. She also offered to comb my hair once we had gone inside and asked if she could braid it, the way I had used to for her when I had possessed the hands with which to do it. She stood on a chair behind me, humming loudly, until the comb's wooden teeth became caught in a large tangle somewhere at the middle of my back. Then she began to cry, and cry, and did not cease to cry until I had rubbed a bit of soap on the comb and worked it through myself. Mama made a small ginger spice cake which we split into four even slices (but not five, as we had mistakenly done last year) after supper. I have always thought birthdays to be something of an unnecessary fuss. When I returned to the office later that night, oil lamp in hand, I was carrying a pair of scissors in my pocket. These were used to snip clumsily away at heavy strings that bound the package, and then tear through the pleated paper its insides were padded with. I believe that sort of paper is most often used these days for stuffing fancy hats. Folding the paper aside, I saw what the package contained. It was a gun. A letter was tucked inside, as well, and spare bullets pattered down around my feet as I withdrew it. 20 January 1879 Mattie, This is a Colt .38 New Line Revolver. I won it from Prvt. Lloyd in a game of five-card stud - thus exacting my revenge for the Salt War diplomacy incident - but I already own two revolvers and this piece would benefit me little out here due to its size and caliber. It is not a hand-held cannon like your father's .44 Dragoon was, but neither is it to be treated like one of those foolish .22 pepper-box pistols ladies carry in their garters. It will take the vinegar out of who or whatever you aim at and operates the way any other single-action firearm does. When threatening to shoot a man dead where he stands, you must first ascertain that you are equipped to do the job right. Signed, LaBoeuf Shells continued to roll their way across the floor and into the dark. I turned the gun over, scrutinizing its purposeful design. The barrel could not have been more than four inches long, the steel all glossed over with a striking blued finish. It had a concealed spur-style trigger and rosewood grips. I composed my response several days later. Wednesday, March 5th , 1879 Dear LaBoeuf, Five-Card Stud Champion of the Southwest, You should understand that I do not care a thing in the world for guns. I merely thought that particular threat would best convey to Mr. Woodson how serious I was. (I have decided to follow in the wake of other cotton planters by taking my business to a furnishing merchant instead. This is a grim but necessary prospect.) Your Colt .38 is currently in a box underneath my bed, and with any luck that is where it will stay. I would also like to know how it is you came to be so informed on the subject of where ladies carry their derringers. Nevertheless, your gift was a timely one. I am writing this letter on my newly acquired Sholes and Glidden typewriter. It was a birthday present from Mama and Little Frank. He clipped an advertisement for it out of a Bannerman catalog last year, and together they have been saving up ever since. (Really they bought it second-hand from Mr. Douglas down at the depot.) It is a splendid device with many noisy keys. They inspire in one the temptation to type out utter nonsense just to hear them. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross Post Script: In truth I know Little Frank is quickly getting to be taller than I am and cannot rightfully be considered little anymore. That is just what we called him when I was younger, because then my father was also \"Frank\" and it made things easier for Mama when she was yelling after one or the other. 5 May 1879 Mattie, It does not matter whether you care a thing for guns or not. At our present moment in history they are a part of life, and it is always better to have something and not need it than to need something and not have it. I recently purchased some .45-70 Springfield Trapdoor rifles to outfit several Tiguas I have recruited to be scouts – many think and speak of the Pueblo Indians as being all one tribe, but in fact they are many living in proximity. These men know the territory far better than any of us could ever hope to. On foot they can keep up with an ordinary cavalryman, and in the mountains they can out-march him. Sgt. Ludwick expressed some concern over the expense of these rifles. He reminded me that Gen. Terrazas' Indian infantry gets along fine with Remington muskets. I asked Sgt. Ludwick if he would consider sending any regular officer into a hostile situation, armed only with a rusty old blunderbuss whose recoil would do almost as much damage to the man shooting it as the man being shot at. Sgt. Ludwick said no, he would not. But it did not matter either way. The guns were paid for with a portion of the Bibbs' reward money that I had saved. As for the matter with your brother – my own older brothers were named Isaiah and Jeremiah, respectively, but were called Issy and Jerms by our sister Danielle until they were both grown men. They despised it. Refer to your brother by his usual title for as long as he will tolerate, and then for a while beyond that. That is where the fun lies. Signed, LaBoeuf Wednesday, July 9th, 1879 Dear LaBoeuf, Brother to Hebrew Prophets and Dispenser of Sage Advice, I am astonished to hear that you saved any of the Bibbs money. Whatever are you planning to do with the rest of it? I thought by now it would have all been spent on buckskin jackets, stovepipe boots, half-bent Dublin pipes and flat-crowned Stetson hats. I had imagined you made it a point to own several identical ones of each. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross Post Script: Little Frank sends his regards. 16 August 1879 Mattie, You have seriously misconceived the allotted space a Ranger is given for his possessions. Barracks do not lend themselves to owning duplicates of anything. Everything I have may be fitted easily into several saddlebags on a strong bay horse. Which is not to say everyone at this station heeds the rule – certainly not Lt. Baylor. Our detachment of Co. C received its new commanding officer, one 1st Lt. George Wythe Baylor out of San Antonio, three days ago. He arrived along with his wife, two daughters, sister-in-law, six escort Rangers from Co. D, some household furniture, a square piano, a violin, and a coop of game chickens. Baylor won recognition for his service with the 2nd Calvary Regiment of the Arizona Brigade, but had been farming cabbages in the Nueces Canyon when he asked Gov. Roberts for a Ranger position. His war record and political endorsements qualified him for a place of leadership, and there was only one vacancy. Lt. Baylor strikes me as an old-time frontier gentleman. He has especially lauded my recruitment of the Tigua scouts. He is a combat-tested solider and, according to Sgt. Gillett who arrived with him, a superb marksman. I believe he will prove himself to be a man of 'true grit', as you would say. Signed, LaBoeuf Tuesday, September 16th, 1879 Dear LaBoeuf, Judge of True Grit and Gentlemanly Qualities Alike, I do not understand why anyone would elect to haul a piano the six hundred or so miles it must be from San Antonio to El Paso. Mama used to play the piano, but she left that behind in Monterey, California when she married Papa because it would have been beastly to transport. We are not a particularly musical family, though Mama and Victoria are fond of singing and even some dancing. I have never cared much for either myself. Most Respectfully Yours, Mattie Ross There was something different about the next letter that came. It took me a moment to realize what. It was enclosed in an envelope that felt to be made either of royal or some other heavy-stock paper. A seal had been applied, with something close to assiduousness, and I spent my walk home pondering the care and time that had been given it. The postmark was still El Paso, Texas. The handwriting and the newsprint paper, I discovered upon opening the letter, were the same: though it was in pen rather than pencil. I settled down into my hoop-back chair and held the letter up to a shaft of cold light as I read. 20 November 1879 Mattie, I have not written for some time. For that I, apologize. It has been restless here since the beginning of October. An awful thing happened recently. In late September, the Apache chief Victorio – who is a far better commander than old Geronimo ever was, in my own opinion – quit the Mescalero Reservation along with 40 warriors, and a number of women and children. For this I cannot fault him. The land out there is poor and hates both the seed and the plow. He fought off cavalry units that tried cornering him in the Black Range before crossing into Mexico. We have stayed clear of there since the Salt Wars, figuring we would not be welcome, and planned to continue doing so. The upset began when a band of 18 others, riding out to join their leader, raided across our sector and attacked a group of hay cutters just north of the La Quadria stage station. Lt. Baylor received permission to follow across the international border from Capt. Gregorio Garcia – he and Garcia fought Yankees together in '61 and are fast friends. The ensuing chase took us some hundred miles all told and resulted in nothing. Next we heard of Victorio was on November 8. His band had grown to around 100 by then and he had taken to the Candelaria Hills, where he made plans to obtain fresh horses from a settlement near San Jose. He chose his position like you would expect a military-minded man to. It provided him with a clear view of the main road, which passes from the Santa Maria river to Juarez through the Candelarias. The hills are called this because of how they rise out of an otherwise flat horizon – in the sun, their color puts your mind on tallow wax. The road passes around the northern side of these formations and at a certain point winds between two tall peaks. Victorio sent 6 or 7 of his men to a small village called Carrizal, where they cut loose a string of ponies. The Mexican townsmen went off with a group of 15 in hopes of recovering their animals. They struck the trail of Victorio's warriors, which of course brought them up the main road and through the narrow mountain pass. Once there, they were caught up in an ambuscade and killed down to the last man. A party of 35 others struck out when their companions failed to return. They met the same fate. We were called to the site soon after this and arrived with some volunteers from Paso del Norte. The 50 dead men we found there in the Candelarias were too many to carry back, with the number of horses we had, but to leave them lying out in the desert for another day would have meant letting them be picked to the bone by scavengers. So Lt. Baylor ordered that we bury them, which is to say that we buried almost the entire male population of Carrizal there on the road to Juarez. The earth is dry and it was hard going, with us using stones or gun stocks to make the graves deep enough. Most men had their hands turned raw with blistering. Again my thanks for the gloves. Back at the border town, the people thanked Lt. Baylor and the rest of us for doing it – they said they would gladly help our battalion any time aid was needed or asked. They said we would \"make a good stand-off fight\" together. Signed, LaBoeuf I laid this letter down on the desk. A necklace chain was drawn out from inside my shirtwaist. From the end of it swung one of Papa's California gold pieces, which I had gotten a small hole bored through. The other piece had been given for Mama to keep. I watched the gold flash as it turned lazily about, first left, then right, then around again before stilling. My face was reflected in its polished surface. It was a tiny and distorted image, but one that accurately mirrored my frown nonetheless. LaBoeuf had found the gold piece in Tom Chaney's boot as he was preparing the body for its transport to Texas. He had returned it to me while I was recovering in Dr. Medill's house at Fort Smith. I tucked the chain back under my collar, pulled up a sheet of paper and wrote the following: Monday, January 12th, 1880 Dear LaBoeuf, Whose Experience the Prophet Ezekiel Would Well Understand, In dark times you must keep close the words of Deuteronomy 33:27; \"The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.\" Or arm, in my specific and more marginalized case. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross I sent it the same day. 10 February 1880 Mattie, I told myself I would not write you again unless I had some more favorable piece of news to share, and I figure this is fitting enough. Anyway, it was unusual. Recently, 2 men called us away on a rescue mission. We had first met them in early January – they had introduced themselves as Andrews and Wiseall, mining engineers who stopped by Ysleta on their way to San Antonio. They had with them a few horses, a wagon of modern firearms and other goods, and an English shepherd dog. Against our advice they chose to travel by way of the old Butterfield stagecoach route, instead of taking the safer one around Fort Davis. They got about as far as Crow Flats, where they made camp at one of the abandoned stage stations, before some thieves came by and made off with their horses. You see where ignoring us got them. Stranded, they then chose to turn around and make the 100 mile walk to Ysleta – at that point, it was the second-closest town. The other was Pecos, 75 miles distant, but that would have meant crossing mountains. The journey took them some 15 days and left them more dead then alive once they finally got here. You will find that most people out in this country have a strong aversion to walking places they ought to be riding. But both men were still coherent enough to demand that we go back for their cargo, and their dog. Sgt. Gillett and I left with 8 other men, Andrews and Wiseall accompanying. When we reached the station, the dog challenged us from a position he had selected atop the north wall. He gave Prvt. Marsh a good bite in the arm and I was spared a similar fate only by throwing the beast a piece of jerky. His temper was not unreasonable. For over two weeks he had fought off coyotes, eaten what foodstuffs his owners left behind, and in general held down the place with as much resolve as Travis at the Alamo. The dog's mood changed quickly when he realized two of the riders with us were his old friends, come back for him – no doubt he spent those two weeks thinking he had been forgotten. The other officers and I were glad to see the dog delivered to his owners safely. Being that we are used to dealing with things only in their aftermath, it was a welcome change. The dog also ate my week's ration of beans. I could not really begrudge him for it. Signed, LaBoeuf Thursday, April 8th, 1880 Dear LaBoeuf, Hero to Canis Familiaris Everywhere, I can well understand the thoughts that dog must have been entertaining. No doubt I had similar ones, when I was under the impression you and Rooster had left me in the hands of Ned Pepper's gang. I assure you said thoughts were not of a particularly kind or docile nature. While by now you must realize I am not one of those fragile-constituted women who insists on having news softened before it is presented to her, I would nevertheless like to return the favor of a peculiar story. We own a pig. We used to own several, but I sold the rest and have only had my hand stayed in disposing of this one because Victoria has made it something of a pet. Early Tuesday morning, I had gathered up a bucket of bean snips, peels and such for the morning slop, and was going out to feed Clarabelle. That is the pig's name. I heard a shout, as well as a distressed noise from one of our horses, so that picked my pace up to a run: and what should I enter the barn to find but a horse thief, caught in the act of unlatching our mare Gertrude's stall. Victoria names all of the animals here. I advanced and got his attention by yelling something, I cannot remember what, in the exact instant he spun around to notice me. We discovered together that in a contest of swiftness between a man with a gun and a woman with a slop bucket, it is the one whose weapon cannot become jammed inside its holster who emerges victorious. I swung the bucket a hard right and knocked him stupid upside the head. He fell backwards into the mud and sat there dazed. You can imagine my surprise when I recognized him; it was an old schoolmate of my brother's named Thomas Cain. Frank considers him a friend, or at least he did when they were young, but I have always figured him for trash and here was indisputable proof of it. I stood there with my bucket and told him he should be ashamed of himself. Was this behavior how he repaid his uncle, after the care that had been given him all these years? I told Thomas I ought to notify the authorities, which of course put him into a contrite sort of mood. The horses his farm keeps are worth twice what ours are, and are twice in number besides, so I refreshed his memory on the story of the rich man who seized the poor man's one ewe lamb. That was enough to turn King David from his sinful ways, anyhow, and it ought to have been enough for Thomas Cain. I also told him how I had once met a stock thief who got his fingers cut off, just prior to being stabbed in the heart by someone he considered a comrade. That, if you remember, was Moon and Quincy. I put down my bucket and turned to fix the latch on Gertrude's stall. When I did this Thomas saw his chance, swayed to his feet, and took off running. I did not end by reporting the Cain boy to Sheriff Quinn (J.W Quinn is the lawman over in Russellville. Our own sheriff has gotten on in years and is fixing for retirement). It would bring a great deal of shame upon his uncle, who is a prominent member of our church, and he is just a foolish boy after all. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross 10 July 1880 Mattie, Your adeptness at dispatching thieves with slop buckets would have come in handy these past few days, I think. Last year 2 outlaws from New Mexico by the names of Jesse Evans and John Selman decided they would try their luck in Texas, crossed into the Davis Mountains, and dropped out of sight of the law. Turns out, they had set up a butcher shop in Ft. Davis – which Selman ran while calling himself 'Captain John Tyson', and Evans kept supplied with stolen livestock. An unsuspecting citizen could very well end up paying overprice for a side of his own cow. The gall of these men is unbelievable. On May 19, Evans and 3 companions robbed the Sender and Siebenborn Store for $930 and scurried off. That is what rats do, scurry. When local authorities were unsuccessful in catching them for over a month, the Rangers at Ysleta were summoned along with a group of nine men from Capt. Robert's Co. D camp near Ft. McKavett, headed up by Sgt. Sieker. We received information that the Evans bunch had been spotted on the road to Presidio del Norte. It was 85 miles hard riding before we caught up with them near the Chinati Mountains, at which point both we and our horses were pretty well winded. The outlaws opened fire at the same time we did, and they withdrew up a steep rock slope with plans of sniping away at us from higher ground. I had the hat blasted right off of my head - I am no longer sorry it was a size too large. I saw one of the men lean out to shoot again and fired off twice with my revolver. The first went wide, but the second one caused him to jerk back and behind cover again. Several minutes later, the gun battle ended with Evans surrendering - turns out it was him that I hit. My second shot had gotten him in the right arm, and he was cursing a blue streak at me the whole way back. I ought to have taken a page from Cogburn's book and shot him in the lip instead. We realized after the outlaws surrendered that a man from Co. D, Prvt. George Bingham, had been struck in the heart with a bullet from the Winchester rifle Evans was carrying. Sgt. Sieker had killed one of the outlaws during our skirmish, but stated that had he known about Bingham at the time he would have killed them all. He was very upset. Evans will likely draw at least a 10 year sentence at Hunstville Penitentiary for killing a peace officer, but Selman is expected to walk for what I think are reasons of laziness on the part of the sheriff in Shackelford County. The sheriff said evidence to convict Selman had vanished. That, as you may know, is what happens if you do not see to the law for yourself. Major Jones has since decided that Ft. Davis needs its own Ranger unit, so Lt. Nevill was ordered to establish a detachment of Company E there. The prisoners were taken back to Ft. McKavett, rather than Lt. Baylor here at Ysleta. If there is one fault I can find in our lieutenant, it is that he is a somewhat poor disciplinarian. He trusts all men at a glance and hates to see anyone in trouble. I do not know how he would react to the news that Sgt. Gillett is courting his eldest daughter. Signed, LaBoeuf Wednesday, August 18th, 1880 Dear LaBoeuf, Who Has Probably Raided His Surplus Stock of Hats by Now, You would be very surprised where robbers can turn up these days. I learned this recently. Here is what happened. Yesterday, I was in a disagreement with Mr. DuBois the banker. There is no bank in Dardanelle, much to my chagrin, nor in all of Yell County for that matter. Our townsmen apparently thought that the building of a hardware store, a wagon and implement business, and several hotels was more important. (There is a vacant building near the post office but they are asking $1000 for it.) So for financial matters one most go the four miles over to Russellville in Pope County, across the river. I took out a loan at the beginning of the planting season, to replace our plow after the old one had its blade bent on a rock. Mr. DuBois reminded me, in what I imagine he believed to be a tactful fashion, that I ought to have repaid it long ago. Debt was owed, and he would have it; Mr. DuBois is the sort who likes to bear men down more with his fluency than the strength of his reasoning. He has been pestering me about this for some time and his interest rates leave much to be desired. Under normal circumstances I would have been more cordial in my reply, but he spoke in such an insinuating sort of way that I informed Mr. DuBois of the following: It is assumed that 'debt' is the money owed by a debtor, and the word is often used to mean such. This is erroneous. Debt is defined under the laws of commerce as the debtor's personal duty to pay back any money loaned. Every person who borrows money incurs a debt, or personal obligation. The essence of an obligation is not in that it makes any specific goods the property of another, but rather it binds that person to give you something. That is to say, no particular money in the debtor's possession rightfully belongs to the creditor. None of it is pledged to him. All money continues to be absolute property of the debtor: as per the Mutumm nature of commercial loans, and not Commodata, in that they are transfers of property. It is all very simple. Therefore Mr. DuBois had no right to claim any of my money for himself, or even say such a thing as \"debt was owned\", and I would get the loan paid off to him in due time. I concluded by stating that the books of Deuteronomy, Jeremiah and Presbyterian church law all prohibit a man from charging interest, so he should not be getting any ideas about increasing his current rate. It is truly astonishing, the degree to which people believe they can horn-swoggle a woman simply because she has no father to direct her finances. Our confrontation may have escalated from there, but Mr. DuBois Sr. came out of his office and with some joking and light conversation put his son in a better mood. Abraham DuBois is a polite, good-humored man and I cannot understand where Issac DuBois' sour disposition originates from. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross 13 September 1880 Mattie, I am just now beginning to grasp the dire straits that unsuspecting men enter when doing business with you. I believe it was that Francis Bacon man who said something along the lines, 'Testimony is like the shot of a long bow, which owes its efficacy to the force of the shooter – while argument is like the shot of a cross bow, equally forcible whether discharged by a giant or a dwarf.' We both know which one is your weapon of choice. Signed, LaBoeuf Friday, October 1st, 1880 Dear LaBoeuf, Who Has At Last Learned That 'He Who Hath Knowledge Spareth His Words', You did not grasp the thing before? I am sorry. From this point on I will make a concerted effort to be clearer. And you should mind that while Frank is now taller than me, I am of average height and therefore not considered a dwarf by any standard of measurement. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross 28 October 1880 Mattie, This letter, like you, will be short. I do not know when I will be able to write again. We have for several weeks been entertaining Victorio the Apache in a seven-league game of manhunt, along with Col. Terrazas and his Indian infantry out of Mexico, and United States cavalry under Lts. Shaffer, Manney and Col. Grierson. The instigator for this was that a U.S troop, several stage drivers and their passengers were all killed between the areas of Eagle Springs and Quitman Canyon. Last week Col. Terrazas' soldiers attacked Victorio and his forces in the Pinos Mountains, a confrontation during which Victorio himself was killed. We were not present for the battle. Twelve of Victorio's warriors had deserted the main force about a week earlier, taking along with them four Indian women and four children, and have been harassing small groups of soldiers, isolated herders, and travelers on the transcontinental road. No word yet as to whether or not we will be pursuing them into the mountains, but we are keeping prepared. Which we do not as a detachment of Company C, but rather as the main body of Frontier Battalion Company A. Major Jones – though he is properly called Adjutant General Jones now – informed us in a letter that our detachment had been mustered back into the main force, with Captain George Baylor commanding. Signed, LaBoeuf I wrote no reply to that one. \"Mattie! Hey! Mattie!\" Victoria rushed into Hatchet and Gimlet's Hardware Store, waving a thin yellow strip of paper about in her gloved hand. I glanced up from an advertisement for mechanical cotton pickers. The idea of the contraption sounded promising, but I foresaw too many hidden problems occurring with the rotating spindles. \"Yes.\" She waved the paper with such enthusiasm that I feared it would rip. \"We got a telegram!\" \"I see that.\" I directed my attention to Frank, who followed in behind her with a stack of mail in one over-sized hand and a ten pound bag of feed in the other. I had sent them over to Sam Levy's Mercantile and the post office. \"Mr. Hughes just gave it to us,\" he explained. His voice cracked between tenor and baritone as he spoke. \"It is for you.\" Victoria was impatiently rubbing out creases in the paper, over the words 'ATTN MATTIE ROSS.' I plucked the long strip from her hands and read what the receiving operator had transcribed. VICTORIO WARRIORS ATTACKED STAGECOACH IN QUITMAN COUNTY STOP RANGERS GIVING PURSUIT INTO EAGLE MOUNTAINS STOP WILL WEAR GLOVES FOR COLD WEATHER STOP SIGNED LABOEUF STOP \"Who is it from?\" Victoria asked. Then, tilting her chin up a few degrees, she explained, \"I would have read it for myself, but Frank said that was nosy.\" I looked down at my sister. Her cheeks were burned pink from the cold. She was wearing a canvas coat that had fit me very long time ago and was missing a button. We shared the same eye color, but her hair curled a great deal more than mine. I could clearly predict a future full of unscrupulous suitors in need of winnowing. She was ten years younger than I: there had been another baby born between Frank and Victoria who had not lived more than a few months. \"It is from Mr. LaBoeuf.\" I handed it over for her to inspect again. \"It seems even Morse Code has no effect on his loquaciousness.\" \"Are we going to answer it?\" Victoria turned to Frank, as if expecting him to know. \"Who is this Victorio person? Why is Mr. LaBoeuf chasing him?\" We did not have a separate telegraph station, as some towns did in those days. Telegrams to and from Dardanelle were processed by Mr. Lawler in a small room at the back of the post office. He had recently installed a Dutch door, and I pushed its upper half open with my elbow to find him at his desk. The big telegraph machine was making its insectile clicks and buzzes as he fed a roll of paper tape in. Behind me, I heard Frank stoop and lift Victoria up to see. \"Mr. Lawler,\" I said by way of greeting. He turned. Mr. Trigg Lawler wore glasses and had a great deal of bushy orange hair. \"Hello, Miss Ross. Did you receive your telegram alright?\" \"I did, thank you.\" I held the yellow paper up. \"When was this sent?\" Mr. Lawler got up from his desk and walked over. The sleeves of his suit were rubbed thin at the elbows. \"It arrived here today, but it was sent up from El Paso on the fourteenth. It had to go through the offices at Fort Davis, San Angelo and Dallas first.\" He grinned around his cigar. \"I have never gotten one from somewhere that remote before. It is amazing. What hath God wrought, indeed.\" \"I want to send a response.\" \"Say please,\" came Victoria's whispering reminder. Frank guffawed. I frowned at them both over my shoulder. \"I want to send a response, please.\" Mr. Lawler cleaned his glasses with a corner of shirt tail. \"You can try, but it might not get through. I heard Indians have been cutting the military telegraph lines down there for a few months. Messy business.\" \"I am not surprised. Victorio the Apache was a military-minded man,\" I informed Mr. Lawler. \"I would like to try anyway.\" He raised his bushy eyebrows, but handed me a piece of paper and a pencil. Frank held it in place as I wrote my intended message out. ATTN SGT LABOEUF: DO NOT GET SELF KILLED STOP WOULD BE RUDE STOP YOURS MATTIE STOP I handed the paper off to Mr. Lawler. It was January 16th, 1881. It is not commonplace for news out of El Paso to end up in the Galveston Daily newspaper. But then it is not commonplace for what history would later designate as the last \"real Indian fight\" in the state of Texas to take place, either. Even then, the article I read over Sam Levy's shoulder was a short one. Its information had purportedly come from the mouth of Lieutenant Charles L. Nevill of Frontier Battalion Company E, who had joined together with Captain George Baylor and fourteen of his Company A El Paso Rangers (because that is all the article referred to them as) before ascending into the Devil Mountains and losing contact with the outside world for five days. They had come upon the rogue band of Mescalero Apaches at dawn on January 29th. In the ensuing fight, eight people had died. But the idiot reporter had either forgotten - not bothered to learn, not been permitted to disclose - who they were, or even what side they had fought and perished for. Saturday, February 20th, 1881 Dear LaBoeuf, Whose Epitaph I Have Decided Will Read 'Here Lieth a Sagebrush Oaf', Surely you must realize that I cannot have information relayed to me through dreams. I am not the prophet Isaiah, or Jeremiah, or Daniel. Either I have some news of you, or else I give you up for dead and attend to the job of arranging your proper Christian burial: a task I sincerely doubt anyone in your salty outfit can manage. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie Ross I read this letter over once and found it distasteful. Twice over, it seemed pleading. I moved to raise the paper up before me and tear it in two. And was surprised when only one hand rose to do my bidding. Irritated with myself at having made such a foolish mistake after so long, I crushed the page up and went to kick the office's glowing cast-iron stove open. My letter was tossed in. Fire licked its edges black before the whole thing shriveled up on itself and crumbled to a pale gray dust. And things went on, as they are wont to do. The state of Kansas passed a law prohibiting the sale of alcoholic beverages. Mama sold all of her muslin dresses, including the white one that had been Papa's favorite. Ferdinand De Lessep's company began work on a canal down in Panama, and everyone said that it would not and could not be finished. Victoria's barn cat Luanne had three kittens. The market price of cotton dropped to five cents a pound, near the lowest it had ever been, while the tariff duty rose to forty-five percent. Upon my insistence, Frank secured a job for himself moving crates down at the steamship docks for wages of $1.75 a day. My furnishing merchant advanced supplies for our tenants on credit. James A. Garfield was inaugurated as the 20th President of the United States. I turned eighteen. In the month of March, Arkansas received five and a half inches of rain. My mother always hesitated at the office door before walking in. She had not started doing this until a few months after Papa died. At first, I think she needed those seconds just to soundly convince herself that she would not, in fact, find her husband sitting in his usual place at the desk. By now it was likely force of habit. Then she leaned around the corner, the rest of her thin body following shortly behind. I waited for her to speak first. I was doing our bookkeeping and had gotten distracted in adding up living expenses. Breadstuffs at $13.75, meats, $7.62. \"Mattie?\" she said mildly. \"There is a letter here for you. Matthew Richards just dropped by on his way home with it. Mr. Hughes told him that you have not picked up the mail in several days.\" I nodded but went on writing. Dairy and farming expenses, $12.68. Soap, starch, pepper, salt, etc., $3.50. Sundries, $1.12. \"It is from that Texas Ranger of yours, I think. That is what the postmark says.\" My pen stopped. I straightened up and turned my head towards her. Mama was holding the little envelope out in her left hand; I noticed she had still not taken off her wedding ring. It was very likely that she never would. \"I make no claims of ownership on Mr. LaBoeuf,\" was my answer. I quickly added the numbers up and subtracted it from our income. \"Just leave it on the desk, please.\" But she kept a hold of the letter, moved closer and offered it out for me to take. \"You do not speak about him very much.\" \"I do not think about him very much, either. One usually follows the other.\" \"Well. He seems to enjoy your letters, at least.\" I turned my whole body towards her this time. It was a damp day, cold for late April. Mama was wearing a cherry-colored shawl that made her face look paler by comparison. Her dark hair, jetted all through with silver now, was done up into a clever French twist and held in place with a wooden comb. She had sold her tortoiseshell ones to buy a new pair of work boots for Frank. Let down from its confines, I knew my mother's hair would tumble almost to her hips. Papa had liked to brush it before they retired for the evening. When I was young I had occasionally peered in through the door at them and told myself I would grow my hair long like that, so that one day my own husband could stand there combing the spider-silk threads. Neither of us would speak, no, but if our eyes chanced to meet in the gilt-frame mirror we would both smile. I had since left off such silly imaginings, of course. And my hair had become much more straggly as I got older. I set my pen down and accepted the letter. \"I believe Mr. LaBoeuf keeps the correspondence up largely as a way to stave off boredom.\" The envelope was sliced open in my usual chirurgical way. \"There is nothing to look at down there but scrub-brush and dust. I would be writing regular letters to me, as well, if I lived a hundred miles from the nearest running water and green grass.\" Mama cocked her head. \"Oh, I don't know. I have always found Texas country to be pretty enough. Your father and I traveled across it on our way back from California, you know, just after we were married. All of the wildflowers were in season.\" I let the letter drop out into my lap. Only one page. \"What kind of flowers were they?\" \"Mostly little azure ones. With petals that turned themselves outward, like on those wide-brimmed sun hats city women wear.\" Mama's hands made a delicate spreading gesture to pantomime the petal's shape. \"They are called bluebonnets. They bloom everywhere in the spring.\" \"I would most likely be allergic to them.\" I unfolded the letter and read it. 10 April 1881 Mattie, It may surprise you to learn that you are no longer writing to 1st Sergeant LaBoeuf of Frontier Battalion Co. A at Ysleta del Sur Pablo in El Paso County – without vanity, I may say that you are now addressing 2nd Lieutenant LaBoeuf of Frontier Battalion Co. B, at Hackberry Springs in Mitchell County under Capt. Marsh. Marsh is retiring soon and will be replaced by a man named Sam A. McMurry. Company B was recently chosen for the job of shepherding the Texas & Pacific railway through the Trans-Pecos. Their aim is to meet the Southern Pacific at a junction in Sierra Blanca, east of El Paso. Capt. Baylor recommended me to Adjutant General Jones as someone who knows the more western territories, brought the detachment of Co. C through a peaceful year, and for my services in tracking Chelmsford. The transfer itself was my own suggestion. Once McMurry takes charge we will be reorganized at Colorado City, which is also in Mitchell County but is a more appropriate location for our headquarters. In the middle of the page was drawn a crude map displaying the state of Texas as it was dotted by camps, forts, towns, and a few wriggling lines for the rivers and railroads. Mitchell County was west of Abilene on the Colorado River. Assuming I was too dense to figure it out for myself, LaBoeuf had also sketched a much less detailed Arkansas off to the right and crossed the whole map with two lines. One stretched from El Paso to Dardanelle and marked the spanned distance to be over nine hundred miles. A second told me that the distance from Hackberry Springs to Dardanelle, in contrast, was closer to six hundred. Why he had done this I could not fathom. This was the Ranger company crucial in the hunting of outlaw Sam Bass and his gang three years ago, and I am glad to be serving in it. But do not get it into your head that one company is greater or lesser than the other because of alphabetic arrangement. That is just how the frontier was partitioned in '74. Headquarters is in Austin, but that is all desk work and no man enters the Rangers intent on doing that. Signed, LaBoeuf \"What does it say?\" Mama asked. She was looking at me with one of her sad, anxious expressions. Some ugly little barb of a retort rose quickly in my throat. Then I looked at the silver hairs around her face, the silver wedding ring on her long pianist's hand. I had given her that red shawl for her twenty-fifth birthday, I realized, the year I was seven. Mama had been seventeen when Papa married her. She was thirty-five now. I folded the letter back up in neat little quarters and slipped it into a pigeonhole along with all of LaBoeuf's letters, which were tied up together with some twine. \"Nothing,\" I replied. \"It does not say anything. Thank you for bringing it, Mama.\" 20 July 1881 Mattie, Our Adjutant General John B. Jones, formerly Major Jones, died two days ago. Jones' health had been failing him for some time, but I think most of us expected that grand old stooge to live forever. His efforts were essential in transforming the Rangers from a scattered collection of Indian fighters into professional lawmen and it will be impossible for Gov. Roberts to replace him. Though I believe my own men would do an adequate job, if put to the task. There are 20 of us in the company – 18 regular officers, myself, and the new captain McMurry. We are stretched pretty thin with a number like this, even with detachments camped over several neighboring counties. We are expected to manage things from here all the way up into the Panhandle, which as I am sure you know is quite a large area. Capt. McMurry is a terse, stoic man. I heard he once drew three aces in succession during a poker game and never turned a hair. He is a peace officer determined to enforce the law with no more gun-play than essential. I believe he will also show himself to be a man of 'true grit.' The sergeant is a man named Sam Platt. I will swear under solemn oath that he would charge into Hell armed only with a bucket of water – or pig slop – if he thought it necessary. He has also demonstrated an odd sense of humor. We were recently discussing what ought to be done about the fence cutters, who as the ranges are being progressively closed in are growing progressively greater in number. There has even been talk of using what Sgt. Ira Aten of Co. D termed 'dinamite booms' in his letters to the quartermaster – once Aten had procured some packages for himself, this spelling error was corrected to be 'dynamite'. Obviously this was in jest, but I asked Platt what he thought of it. He replied, never once cracking a smile,\"If such a thing is possible, I don't want to kill these rascals and have any more deadly enemies on my trail than I have already got.\" I find I must concur on that point. It would be nice to see old age if I am allowed it. Another man here is Prvt. Britton. His full name is James M. Britton, but everyone calls him 'Grude' for reasons I cannot quite understand. He is our company's youngest officer, at nineteen, and as something of a veteran I am expected to accompany him on assignments as often as possible. That is how you learn, of course, by observing. Britton has a girl back in Dallas whom he writes poetry for. I have been read excerpts of this and it is atrocious. Signed, LaBoeuf 15 August 1881 Mattie, I asked about this with a clerk at the post office and learned that you did indeed receive my last two letters alright. I was wondering if maybe they had gotten turned back along their route. The conclusion I am to draw from this is that you have joined up with some band of outlaws or another and run off – this is a much more feasible explanation than others I have weighed, principally that you intend to ignore my correspondence. I had heard news that the Rangers of Co. F chased outlaws Will and Lizzy Garrett all the way to Texarkana before losing their trail – they are believed to have crossed the Red River into Arkansas, so perhaps you have fallen in with that pair and gotten yourself a name like Rattler Mattie or the One Armed Bandit. You would probably want companions of notoriety, and there is a $500 dollar reward on each of them. I sincerely hope you have not done this. Because then I will be obliged to go after you, and I suspect it would take a fearsome amount of manpower to hunt you down. I like my fellow officers here and would rather not risk their safety in such a venture. Signed, LaBoeuf The next letter was extraordinary. This was not because of the way it was sealed up, presented, or anything slipped in along with the letter itself. It was extraordinary because of the force with which it seemed to have been written, as if any stopping or raising the pen from the paper (because this one, also, was in pen) would mean a loss of critical momentum. Words were written, crossed out in several places. Big slash marks were made over some of them, but for the most part I could see what had first been said before it was struck through with what was meant. I had not waited to reach my office before opening this one. I had instead elected to open it while going up the front walk, tearing the paper rather indelicately with my teeth, and now the thud of my congress shoes halted there on the porch. 2 September 1881 Mattie, I have just realized that I never told you how things ended in mountains with the Mescalero Apaches. I will correct this error now. Here, as you say, is what happened. We trailed the band from the Eagle Mountains through Eagle Springs, and eventually into the Sierra Diablos. We came upon them very early on the morning of January 29. The fight that broke out could not have lasted more than a few minutes. I know you are familiar with what happens in a gunfight. It is noise enough to cave your head in. Everything is smoke and fire. With thick coats against the cold, and we were up high enough for there to be snow on the ground, you can hardly tell anybody apart. I cannot even half remember what I did during that span of a time, except I do recall clearly thinking how cold the gun barrel in my hands was even through the gloves. Odd thoughts pass in and out of your mind at times like that. When the firing ceased we discovered that four of the warriors had been killed - as well as two of the women, and two of the children who had been with them. The rest scattered. As we were hurrying down the mountainside we caught sight of a child half-hidden by the rocks. I motioned for her to stay put. She obeyed. When I had climbed down all the way to where the child was, I discovered it was an Apache girl around three years of age or so. Her foot was hurt but she did not seem afraid. We went first to Ft. Davis, to the post hospital there. None of us spoke much. There we left the two surviving women – one of them had been shot in the hand – the baby she had with her, and the girl. On the return trip the girl had insisted on riding with me. All the while she seemed to take an interest in my appearance. I thought at first that it was because Indian men do not wear beards or mustaches, but it developed later that in fact she had never met a person with blue eyes before. She also liked fiddling with the tassels on my coat. I gave it to her. It fit about as well as a collapsed tent, but she may find some use for it as a blanket. Signed, LaBoeuf I made no move to go inside, and instead stood there in the fall afternoon looking down at heavy, black letters as they formed heavy, black words. My thumb rubbed over the paper to find it was newsprint, as always. A marvel the page had not torn. There was suddenly a loud, metallic bang that seemed to have come from the cotton house, and my ear turned towards the noise. I heard Frank let off something that sounded like a curse, and Victoria as she followed this with a stern scolding. I walked to the end of the porch, letter in hand, and looked out. Far off, hired hands could be seen picking their way down along the rows of cotton. Their tanned, bowing backs were shiny with sweat. There were a few more bangs, sputters that came in rapid succession, and this quickly leveled out into brassy, rattling roar. Frank and Victoria gave simultaneous shouts of triumph. I had sold our cow to a livestock auctioneer and used the money to purchase Frank an Armington & Sims shaft-governed engine, at his request. He had concocted some idea about running a belt from its flywheel to the cylinder of our cotton gin, to make it turn faster. Like Papa, his head was full of schemes. He been a good part of two days at fixing the small engine's boiler. Mama, standing in the side yard, looked up towards the cotton house as well. She was hanging laundry. She had hiked the skirt of her dress up and tucked them into her apron band. I could see the strong, blue-veined tendons at the backs of her knees. Four or five wooden clothespins were held in her mouth. Her hair was a long braid that fell down her back. As she moved to hang our sheets and clothing, her shoulder blades parted and met like the wings of a small butterfly. Victoria and Frank had by now broken out into celebratory song, hollering \"When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again\" over the grinding noise of the cotton gin. (\"The old church bell will peal with joy, Hurrah! Hurrah! To welcome home our darling boy, Hurrah! Hurrah!\") Very likely they were swinging each other around by the elbows, too, making complete fools of themselves. Soon I would go to join them in feeding rough bolls through the gin, packing it into the baler after that. There had been a time when there were enough workers to help us at that task, of course. And with ginning the cotton, and even hanging the laundry if we had wished it. I knew this would be another poor year. A storm in late August had caused much of our crop to turn dingy and brown. (\"The laurel wreath is ready now, to place upon his loyal brow, And we'll all feel glad when Johnny comes marching home!\") Mama glanced from the cotton house over to the porch, noticed me standing there. She waved in greeting. Her shapeless cotton dress was white with little blue flowers on it. A strand of her graying hair had escaped the braid, and it clung damply to her cheek. I raised my good arm to wave back. And I stared down at the letter again: which had been written to me by a man I knew to be a proud buffoon, one who nevertheless had always tried the hardest he could to do the best that he was able. In the cotton house, Frank and Victoria were still carrying on. I had not been aware that the song had so many verses. (\"Get ready for the jubilee, Hurrah! Hurrah! We'll give the hero three times three, Hurrah! Hurrah!\") Then I walked into the house, feet swinging out in long strides. Went into my office, sat down at my desk, because they were both mine now and I could not clearly remember when I had started calling them that. I drew a pen out once more, plunged it into the ink well once more. And with the same swift, twisting motions as the first time, I wrote the following. Saturday, September 24th, 1881 Dear LaBoeuf, I am writing to inform you of four things. One: I have scarce ever heard or read the introductory words 'Without vanity I may say' but some vain thing immediately followed it. You should mind that, regardless of how your Texas title or trappings change, you will forever be an old clown. Two: the outlaw siblings William and Elizabeth Garrett are touring the more southern Arkansas counties of Ouachita, Cleveland and Jefferson. I do not believe there is anything of interest to them here, though I will keep scalleywaggery open as a future endeavor merely on the prospect of being able to outwit you further. Three: as fine as those deerskin gloves are, they cannot make warm the steel barrel of a gun that has been carried through a January cold. And, moreover, has not been fired. Four: the term 'true grit' is not in fact one of my own making. Credit belongs to my Grandfather Spurling. Stalwart though I believe your commanding officer McMurry is, there are only two men I know of who deserve that particular distinction. The list does not currently have any openings. Yours Most Respectfully, Rattler Mattie (\"And let each one perform some part, to fill with joy the warrior's heart, And we'll all feel glad when Johnny comes marching home!\") 14 October 1881 Mattie, Whose Opinions I Hold in Esteem Despite Their Typically Rude, Condescending and Overall Disrespectful Nature I am replying to inform you of four things. One – I am 36. That is perfectly middle-aged, and a long way from being spoon-fed castor oil or commiserating about the gout. Gov. Roberts decided that Jones' successor would be a gentleman out of Dallas named Gen. Wilburn - not Wilburt - King, a two-time legislator with a passion for thrift. With the present cutbacks, captains will need to be more selective about the men in their companies. Ideal is for an officer to be a good horseman, an accurate shot, and above all, young. I have often passed for 30 and will carry on doing so for as long as possible, permitting certain parties do not give me away. You, on the other hand, were likely born with the spirit of a 40 year old and have grown progressively more crotchety ever since. Two – Upon further consideration, I believe you would not do well as part of an outlaw band. You would be subversive as an underling and tyrannical as a leader. But I did think Rattler Mattie was a suitable alias, and I am glad you have taken to it. Three – The gloves I gave to the girl's mother. Her hand will bother her for years to come, and I have learned well the importance of keeping old injuries protected against the cold. The gloves are warm enough for that, I think. Four – I have yet to meet another person so adept at handing out insults colored as compliments, and vice versa. It is an extraordinary talent and you ought to teach it to Capt. McMurry, who I believe is too easy-going on these men at times. But thank you. Signed, LaBoeuf November 23rd, 1881 Dear LaBoeuf, Who Must Realize That He is No Longer a Rank Tenderfoot and Start Acting His Age, I am sure your captain McMurry can handle complications in his own way. As I read over your letters, though, I think more and more that there is some hidden design ultimately engined towards making me, in a fit of uncharacteristic soft-headedness, elect to visit your vast and dusty territory. Mama says there is a wildflower called the bluebonnet which grows by the thousands every spring, but I think this is partially sentimentality speaking on her part. I am telling you, I will not do it. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie 5 January, 1882 Mattie, I am expected to leave for a T&P; railroad camp soon. You will not hear from me for a while. It is going to be a long few months – end-of-track settlements draw all manners of unsavory characters. The cars that transport currency, as any thinking man would guess, are an attractive target for robbers. Sgt. Platt and I agree that these new lines are going to be a drain on our forces. And headquarters was officially moved to Colorado City, if you are interested to know. I have never had any plans of inviting you to this state. You would not be able to see its finer qualities, and even if you did you would not comment on them. In fact, I think you would go around purposefully seeking out negative things - I will admit that our trains do not always run on schedule, in part for the reasons I have mentioned - to prove yourself right. But I will tell you that there are not thousands of bluebonnets, there are millions. You can ride for miles on a carpet of them. That is not what you call our Texan fondness for storytelling at work, that is the truth. And as Cogburn in particular should note, there is not a barb or briar to be seen. I bet you would claim to be allergic to them. Signed, LaBoeuf P.S – Capt. McMurry has been making plans to obtain some mustangs from the territory, which I believe he is intent on turning into saddle-horses. I also suspect he has learned that I spent my years between the war and the Rangers by doing ranch work. No doubt I will be designated for the job of breaking and training them when I return. I imagine that you yourself are still able to go about on horseback – I figure you would have to mount them from the right, but I cannot picture how you manage it without spooking the horse. Monday, February 13th, 1882 Dear LaBoeuf, Bronco Buster, Despite popular belief, horses do in fact allow themselves to be mounted from the right side. The only thing is that you must not hesitate, or give them any time to think the odd situation over. Here are several other things I have discovered: Eggs may be cracked and opened with one hand, if you keep the shell properly cupped inside your fingers. If you position things correctly on the keys of a typewriter you can go along at a rate of sixty words per minute. Every so often you will move to satisfy an itch and be surprised when you rake only air, though it happens much less now than at first. Hooks, buttons and straps are negotiable where laces and clasps are not. Bustles also require multiple arms for proper assembly, but it is nice not to go gadding about with fifteen pounds of metal clinging to one's person. If you cannot clasp two hands in prayer, the Lord will find it acceptable should you press one over your heart instead. Risking a few small cuts on the thumb, you can peel ginger root and potatoes. I have not yet figured out apples. It is interesting, all of the things you do not think about under ordinary circumstances. Yours Most Respectfully, Mattie And the time passed. The outlaw Jesse James was shot dead in St. Joseph, Missouri. Men were predicting a dry fall, which meant the shallow river banks would not be made navigable by steamboats until later in the season than usual. I turned nineteen. Robert Koch claimed to have discovered the bacteria responsible for tuberculosis. The lawyer J. Noble Daggett went to his birthplace of Helena, out in east Arkansas, with plans to run for County Commissioner. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow died in March, Charles Robert Darwin in April. Frank turned sixteen. Victoria once again prevented me from selling Clarabelle, even if it meant she had to hobble about in shoes that pinched her feet. One article in Sam Levy's Galveston Daily paper happened to catch my interest. On May 23rd, a prisoner at Huntsville Penitentiary named Evans walked off of a work detail and vanished, right from under the collective nose of his supervisors. His name sounded somewhat familiar, and later it came to mind why. He was the cattle thief from Fort Davis, who had killed one of the Rangers trying to arrest him in the Chinati Mountains. LaBoeuf had shot him in the right arm. I remember thinking it a pity he had not shot Evans in the left shoulder, instead, as there would have at least been an amusing hint of irony in that. 27 May 1882 Mattie, I have decided that I despise the railway system. The locomotive is a hateful invention and breeds crime as much as it does civilization. I have just returned from working the towns and railway camps out around the Trans-Pecos. The Texas & Pacific has officially been joined with the Southern Pacific at Sierra Blanca. It was all disorder out there. Being sometimes one or two hundred miles from the nearest courthouse, you must move in this sequence to maintain authority – commanding presence, verbal reprimanding, physical force, and as a last resort bending the barrel of a six-shooter over the dunce's head. Note that I say the barrel, not the butt. No one but an idiot changes ends with a pistol. In April the holdup of a T&P; express car brought three of us running up from a passenger coach to the station platform to exchange gunfire with the bandits. My hat was the only casualty. Signed, LaBoeuf P.S: I figured you would have devised some clever trick for the horses. Do you keep your hair in those two braids, still? Yes, time does get away from you. Long prologue is LONG. Not all of the chapters will be as heinously large as this one. But I wanted to do something different than just starting off several years later and bringing people up to speed, and at the same time make mention of the major characters (all of them have now been mentioned or introduced. ALL OF THEM) and plot points. And give you a sense of the bond between the members of Mattie's family, because that is something the rest of the story will hinge on. Like I said before, everything LaBoeuf writes about is true. Yes, even the rescue of the shepherd dog, finding the child (though no sources say whether it was a boy or girl, so I took a creative liberty) and the disappearance of outlaw Jesse Evans from Hunstville Penitentiary on May 23rd of 1882. (A few internet sources say 1880, but text sources said 1882.) History seems to have lost track of him after that: and where history drops off, I figure that fiction can begin. Lucky we let his partner Selman go, though. Selman ended up turning to the side of the law, and was the El Paso constable who finally shot and killed famous murderer John Wesley Hardin. I will probably end up publishing a bibliography along with the last chapter of this story, because I needed to consult an insane amount of sources just for this chapter alone and the trend will likely continue. All of the calendar days on Mattie's letters are accurate. March 22nd of 1878 really was a Friday, February 13th of 1882 really was a Monday, and so on. The first bank in Yell County opened in 1895. 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' was not actually written until 1887, but I have fudged that bit of history because I CAN, gosh darn it. But if anyone spotted any other anachronisms, please let me know! If I have not bored you to tears by now, please stay tuned for Chapter One. And, as always, any questions, comments, suggestions or critiques are welcome.[Chapter 2] A/N: No, this story isn't dead yet. It may kill me before this is all over, but I plan to continue with it. Even with a full time job, I swear. True Grit is the property of Charles Portis. I am making no profit off of this One (\"The wicked flee when none pursueth: but the righteous are as bold as a lion.\" - Proverbs 28:1) When I heard the first gunshot, I was sitting down at my desk to begin a letter. I cannot tell you now what its intended contents were. I can recall the date for you, though, each stroke of ink as I wrote it there atop the page. Saturday, June 24 th , 1882 . It was not 8:30 PM, as some newspapers would have you believe: nor was it midnight, which Lucille Biggers Langford has claimed would give my narrative a somewhat more dramatic touch. The sun was at least a half-hour set and it was dark enough inside my office that a lift-wire lantern beside me gave off the smell of paraffin, which places things a short time before 9:00 PM. The ensuing events, I would later figure, took about ten minutes. I do not know if people these days are familiar with the sound of a pistol report. It is nothing like the crash of thunder or the breathtaking recoil of a cannon, as I have seen some city types cover their ears in anticipation of. It is instead compressed, snapping, the crack of a whip. Bang. And I was writing with my father's old Gorham sterling silver dip pen. I can remember this because when I set it down, I noticed that the floral repousse etchings along its shaft had left an impression on the skin between my thumb and forefinger. \"Mattie?\" was Mama's call from the kitchen. Her voice strained through two octaves. \"Did you hear that?\" That was a silly question. I could also hear the pounding of horses' hooves, shouting voices, but saw nothing pertinent or helpful in telling Mama this. I hefted the brass lantern up by its handle. \"Yes, Mama.\" Brisk steps carried me to the front door. I dropped the latch with some awkward fumbling, walked out, and crossed our porch before halting. I looked down the road. Yell County sits on a piece of flat bottom land which stretches from the south bank of the Arkansas River to the Ouchita Mountains. If you were to stand on our porch back then and slide your gaze east to west, you would be able to see for miles as easily as letting go a breath. There would be the trees spaced like pickets to serve as property lines, the hulking shape of other farmhouses, a thin needle of the river itself far off, and of course there would be the cotton: endless, stretching fields of it. We had planted in April and it was just beginning to flower, then, white blossoms that looked spectral in the moonlight. The moon itself was a first quarter with some clouds blotting it. I can remember that, as well. And I remember spotting two distant figures as they ran through our fields, coming from the road towards our yard with one about a hundred feet behind the other. I can remember drawing my focus in closer to realize that there was a small light burning inside our barn. I walked to the front door again and shouted into the house. \"Frank? Where are you?\" Victoria answered me instead. \"He said he was going out to feed Clarabelle.\" I heard her steps beat a quick path into the kitchen where Mama was. \"He forgot to do it earlier.\" From the edge of my peripheral vision, I saw the light coming from our barn go out. There was a second gunshot. The noise of it seemed sharper than the first. Bang. I went inside. Ten minutes. As my hand was occupied in holding the lantern, I could not pick up my long skirts as I ran down the hallway: as I mounted the stairs, clipped against a corner, entered the room I shared with Victoria, stumbled once, dropped to my knees. I groped under my bed for the corner of a Goodman & Myers cigar box. One pull sent it skidding out. I flipped back its lid and closed my fingers around where the Colt .38 New Line Revolver LaBoeuf had once given me should have been laying. I grabbed onto nothing but pleated paper. The box was empty. Nine minutes. \"Mattie?\" Mama called again. I rose and went back the way I had come, stopping to lift a Palmer rifle from its pegs above our fireplace. The leather strap was hooked over my shoulder. A pouch that had been hanging from the gun's hammer was slipped over my wrist. The drawstring of this bag came loose and sent .50 caliber bullets clattering across the floor. I gathered up what I could. Eight, seven minutes here. Mama was just lighting another lantern as I came into the kitchen. I put my own fading one down along with the pouch of bullets, thrust the rifle into her arms, and set the new lantern's glass globe in place before taking it up. \"Mama, I want you to load Papa's gun and wait with Victoria in the back bedroom.\" The Palmer was a bolt-action and would be of no use to me. The back bedroom, meanwhile, had the only door in our house that locked. \"Stay here until Frank or I get back.\" \"What? Mattie, wait.\" Mama laid the gun aside to reach for me. A lifetime of work had granted her slender arms a wiry kind of strength, and I stepped back to avoid them. \"You are staying here with us.\" \"Who is that out there?\" Victoria had rocked up on her toes and was peering out into the yard. \"Were those gunshots?\" I gestured at my sister. \"Victoria, come away from the window. Take those bullets and help Mama while she loads the gun.\" \"What? Why? I don't know how to do that. Mattie, you do it!\" Victoria yanked the drawstring pouch off of the table. It opened again. Long, slender bullets leaped through the air. \"See? I can't! You do it, you do it!\" Minutes six and five gasped by. \"Because I have other matters to deal with. And do not wail, wailing will not help us.\" I retreated a few steps more. Mama's voice was raw when next she spoke. \"Mattie, stop.\" I believe her intention was to grab me about the waist. She had done this very often when I was a child; whenever I had exhibited a proclivity for charging recklessly about, which was quite often, there would suddenly be Mama's arms to snatch me up and swoop me high out of harm's reach. But I turned away at the same time as my mother advanced further, so she grabbed my left sleeve instead. The pin holding it came free and struck the floor with a clear, silver ring. We stared at each other. Four minutes. \"Stay here, Mama.\" Then I was gone, out the back door. I had thought to fetch an ax from the tool shed. I had decided it is better to have something and not need it than to need something and not have it, though I could not recall just then who had said those words to me. The lantern's handle wire was placed over my elbow as I threw the shed door open, but I saw nothing that would be of use there and made to begin searching a big woodpile under the side awning. Three, two minutes. The last gunshot came. Bang. There was only a little moonlight, yes, but enough that I could track the progression of my shadow beside me as I ran. My breath was coming in hard puffs and blows, though it could not have been much more than a hundred and fifty feet from our shed to the barn. Its wide Dutch doors were open, and I halted before these with such an abruptness that my lantern was set rocking on its hinges. It began tossing light high into the eaves before falling back down like a pendulum. I tried to still the swaying lantern, but could not halt its progress without a left hand. For a moment all my attention was taken up by this: by the churning of a pulse inside my mouth, by the creaking whine of brass in my ears. Then, as Ms. Langsford would have me tell you, the minute and the hour joined hands there atop the clock. One. There was a high, animal scream. The noise of it drove a spike through everything else and pinned me where I stood. A horse came plunging forward out of the dark barn, through my swinging circle of light, past me with clods of earth kicking up under its hooves. And I saw the face of its rider, childish in an expression of absolute terror, as the lantern rose high again. It was Thomas Cain. I do not clearly remember shouting anything at him as he rode past. But some harsh, wordless cry must have escaped me, because in those few breathless seconds I thought that perhaps I saw Thomas Cain glance back. A pale flash of face and eye, just over his right shoulder as he fled. I will confess that I cannot be certain. What I am certain of is this: I stood there and watched Thomas Cain charge the horse across our yard, leaving gouge marks in the soil as they went. They cleared the front gate together in one long dreamlike leap before pulling hard around, turning east. This turn was so sharp that the horse's legs almost went out from under it, and I realized he was riding our mare Gertrude. Then Thomas Cain dug his heels in, slapped her flank with the reins, and they shot down the road into the dark. I stood there and watched until I could not hear the beat of hooves anymore. Then it was quiet, mostly. The lantern still swung at my ear. A pulse was still throbbing against the skin of my throat, behind my eyes. My breath shuddered a few times before leveling off again, and my feet made dull thuds across our wooden threshing floor as I walked forward into the barn. \"Frank?\" I tripped over something. In truth it was only a stumble, my second of the evening, but it raised a word of exclamation from me anyway. The toe of my left boot was snatched, my balance pitched forward. The lantern gave one more pendulous swing. I turned about to see what was lying there and discovered that it was a body; I had caught my foot against one of its legs. Closer inspection, in fact, confirmed that it was a body I knew. It was the Russellville Deputy Aaron Walker, the man who had once tried to entertain me with that fib about having to lick horse's sweat from his saddle. He was fallen over on his left side, and I tipped him up slightly with one of my feet to see that he had been shot in the chest. Some hay chaff was stuck inside hole, which was still spilling blood out onto his shirt and the floor. You may think it callous that I was not horrified at what I saw then. But having happened across a dead man once before, down in the rattlesnake pit, I can tell you that a sense of purpose will often speed the recovery of your wits well enough. Such was the case here: I looked away from the body when I heard the sound of retching, and gathered up my resolve to call out again. \"Frank?\" The retching was followed by a fit of sputtering coughs. I received no other answer. I spoke again. \"Frank, we ceased playing the Midnight Caller game several years ago, so please come out from wherever it is you are hiding. I have several questions I wish to ask you. There were a few more coughs which ended in a ragged, sucking breath. \" Then my brother Little Frank, whom I had once reprimanded for putting a frog in his teacher's desk, came staggering out of an empty stall. His boots, and a good portion of his pant legs, were covered in what I guessed to be either pig slop or vomit. His movements were disjointed and lethargic like those of a drunkard. There was something clutched in his left hand, which I discerned a moment later to be my missing Colt .38 revolver. Frank opened his mouth, then looked past me to spot the body of Aaron Walker. He bent nearly in half to retch again. \"Frank.\" I hung my lantern by the doorway and and went to jerk him upright. \"Frank, look at me. Tell me what happened.\" Unsteady though his body was, my brother's eyes were as alert as a startled roe deer's. There was some spittle on his chin, and it dribbled when he spoke. \"...Lord, Mattie, why are you shouting?\" I pulled the cuff of my right sleeve down to wipe his mouth clean. \"That is Deputy Walker lying there. Do you realize that? He has been shot.\" Frank pulled his face away from my administering sleeve. The touch of it seemed to repulse him. \"You don't have to talk that way. I'm not stupid.\" \"Then stop acting as though you are. Who shot Mr. Walker, Frank?\" My brother looked down at the Colt revolver in his hand. His fingers uncurled slowly, as though stiffened by cold, and the gun dropped between his feet. \"Nobody.\" I picked my Colt .38 up. Its six-chambered cylinder was rotated out, and I counted that two shots were missing. A plunge line seemed to fall from the crown of my head to the pit of my stomach. \"I have neither the patience nor the time for your jokes right now. There is a dead peace officer lying on our barn floor with a bullet in him, and I would like to put myself at an advantage by knowing the facts. Why were you carrying this gun? What was Thomas Cain doing here?\" Frank did not seem to have heard me. He started running both hands through his hair, and his breath made a reedy sighing noise inside his narrow chest. \"No, that's not what I meant. I meant nobody really sh-sh...shot him. It was an ac...an accident.\" \"What do you mean by that?\" My brother stayed with both hands fisted in his dark hair and his eyes turned down. \"Leave me alone please, Mattie.\" I do not know what I would have done at that point, had my ears not picked up the faint staccato of horse's hooves once again. I set my gun on the floor and lifted the lantern from its hook to look outside. This, it turned out, was the wrong thing to do; in the middle of the road were two men on horseback, who seemed to have just struck up a heated discussion. From that distance I could not tell you precisely who they were, though one of them sat in his saddle with a vaguely familiar hunch. They both caught sight of my lantern as I held it aloft. Both of them called out, and one of them dismounted to pass through our front gate. I did not wait to see if the other man would follow suit. When I turned back, Frank had picked the gun up again and was spinning its clockwork cylinder in and out, tick-tick-tick. \"Frank, let go of that.\" He blinked at me. There was the most ancient, resigned sort of expression on his face. \"Why?\" Tick-tick-tick. I did not bother hanging my lantern up this time. I set it beside Aaron Walker's body, stepped meticulously over a small puddle of blood that had spread out and congealed beneath him, and reached to prise the revolver free of its incriminating position in my brother's hands. \"Do not ask me why. Do as I say.\" Frank took one step back. \"That's your answer for everything, isn't it?\" \"Frank, give me the gun.\" My brother had a response prepared, most likely, but then his attention shifted past me once more to widen at the sight of something in the doorway. Behind us, a man's voice rasped. \"Aaron?...Oh, Lord.\" The Russellville Sheriff J.W Quinn was standing there. Light flaring up from my lantern colored his face in a way that made his eyes seem like dark, pitted hollows. Mr. DuBois the banker, the younger one, was beside him. Both eyebrows rose up to near his thinning hairline when he saw me. At least Frank had ceased that inane tick-tick-tick of the cylinder with its two missing rounds: that was my thought, just then. I dropped my hand from his and turned towards the two men, Aaron Walker's body dividing the space between us. \"Good evening, gentlemen. May I ask what you are doing on my property?\" Mr. DuBois paid no mind to my question. He looked instead at Sheriff Quinn, who had knelt down beside the body. \"You said Deputy Walker followed one of the thieves here, Sheriff?\" \"Yes. Aaron had shot his horse, and the boy took off into the cotton field. He told me he would sort that one out while I went after the other two.\" Sheriff Quinn was trying to ease Deputy Walker's gun from its holster. He needed to rock the body towards him to do so, and it looked as if he were going to be sick himself. The .44 Dance revolver was snapped open. \"That was the only bullet he fired. You heard three gunshots, you said?\" \"Yes. Which one of the thieves did Deputy Walker chase after?\" Rather than standing up again, Sheriff Quinn sat down hard on the wood floor with his legs propped up on either side of him. He took off his hat to reveal blond hair. \"I do not know. The youngest one, I think. The boy.\" \"I know him,\" Mr. DuBois spat. \"That one was Thomas Cain. He has come into my bank before to make deposits for his uncle.\" \"He has also stolen one of our horses,\" I said, which garnered their attention again. They would regret ignoring me. \"You have just missed him.\" As Sheriff Quinn made no move to leave Aaron Walker's side, and remained sitting there with the back of one hand against his forehead, Mr. DuBois chose to conduct the interrogation on his own terms and stepped forward. \"I should not be surprised that you have managed to entangle yourself in this business, Miss Ross. Is Thomas Cain also the one who shot Deputy Walker here?\" Before I could answer, Frank's footsteps moved around me. \"Tom did not shoot anybody.\" Mr. Issac DuBois was an ugly little sort of man. Even with the lantern behind him to outline his figure in strong gold lines, blue shadows in front to deepen his weak features, his eyes made me think of glass marbles pressed into dough as he squinted. \"...What is that your brother is holding there?\" Mr. DuBois took several more paces forward. Sheriff Quinn glanced up. I stepped in front of Frank again, wishing I could spread both of my arms out wide as you or any other person would have done. I instead stopped my hand against Mr. DuBois' chest and formed a fist. My knuckles were pressed in. \"There will be no more questions until you answer mine. What are you doing here? What has happened?\" Mr. DuBois swatted my hand away. \"My bank was robbed earlier this evening, Miss Ross, a robbery during which my father was killed over the matter of some bank notes he was signing. The Sheriff and his deputy pursued them across the town line into Dardanelle, and I followed shortly behind.\" He swallowed. \"Does that answer your question?\" \"It does not. Who are the the persons responsible?\" \"I've already said the Cain boy was one of them. I do not know who the other two were, but I can provide you with an exact description.\" Sheriff Quinn gave an snort, which sounded more like a sniff in his distraught state. \"I know who they were. That was William and Elizabeth Garrett. Aaron was the one who recognized them from a poster, after we caught up with them a little ways down the road from here.\" He rubbed at his eyes as he stood up. \"Oh, Lord.\" \"The Garrett siblings are Texas outlaws,\" I said. \"They evaded capture last spring by coming up through Texarkana into Arkansas. Where are they now?\" Sheriff Quinn shook his head, keeping the heels of his hands pressed in. \"I don't know. Escaped, most likely. I turned back after I heard the third gunshot.\" \"And why did you not maintain pursuit, Sheriff Quinn? No doubt Mr. Cain has gone off to join his partners in crime by now. If you had performed your duties and stayed on their trail, perhaps all three of them would have been caught and apprehended by now.\" \"Miss Ross,\" Mr. DuBois stated flatly, \"I have had quite enough of your sanctimonious prattle. Now be silent and stand aside so that your brother may explain his role in all of this.\" \"Who is to say that he has any part?\" \"He is holding a revolver. A man is dead at his feet. I believe those two particulars speak for themselves.\" \"I believe they speak no more than you force them to, Mr. DuBois. My brother will not submit to your questioning without a lawyer present. He is protected by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and is innocent until proven guilty.\" \"A peace officer has been shot and my father has been murdered. Innocence, I think, has no part in this.\" \"Nobody meant to shoot him, sir,\" Frank offered in a bland voice. \"It was an accident.\" \"Excuse me, Mr. Ross?\" I turned to reprimand Frank for speaking, as it was quite clear this was a situation best left to myself, but Mr. DuBois moved first. He lunged to wrest the revolver from my brother's hands, and it was relinquished without a struggle this time. \"Thank you, Mr. Ross. Now I believe you have several things to answer for...Quinn, look into their harness and tack room for me. Its door is open.\" As I had done shortly before, Mr. DuBois spun the Colt .38 open. \"Four shots left. Did you miss him the first time, Mr. Ross? One should know how to handle his own gun.\" \"Do not say anything else, Frank\" I snapped at my brother. \"And that is not his gun, it is mine.\" \"Miss Ross,\" Mr. DuBois snapped in response, \"if you speak out one more time I am going to have you arrested.\" \"I would like to see you try. Chapter X of the Arkansas State Constitution privileges all women from such brutal treatment.\" \"Yes. And Article III of Chapter XLIV uses the term 'any person' when speaking on the misdemeanor that is obstruction of process. Perhaps you would also like to see which statute carries more weight.\" \"Wait,\" Frank started, \"wait, my sister has nothing to do with – \" Mr. DuBois wagged the gun barrel in my brother's face. \"Frank, is it? Your sister seems to think she is above the law, Frank, but I would strongly advise you against making a similar mistake. Now start talking, or else I will make good on my word to have her charged. What happened?\" Frank mouthed words the several times before he succeeded in actually forming them. \"I was here fuh-feeding Cla-Clarabelle when – \" \"Clarabelle?\" \"My sister's puh-puh-pig, sir.\" His eyes stayed fixed on the blue steel gun barrel as it moved back and forth. \"I heard something and went to the door. I saw Tom and somebody else running from the road towards our barn, so I...so I fired off a shot.\" \"Why? Were you signaling him?\" Frank did not answer him and stumbled onwards. \"Tom came in, said he nuh-needed a horse because his had been... his had been killed. Deputy Walker was there in the doorway trying to talk Tom out of being ruh-reckless, and I said – \" \"Did you hand him the gun, Mr. Ross? Did you witness Thomas Cain shoot Deputy Walker?\" \"No, no. I have told you, it was an accident . We were, we were fuh-fuh-f-fighting over it. Mr. Walker was st-standing there and the gun juh-juh-just...\"the muscles in Frank's throat heaved. \"Excuse me, sir...\" My brother bent to vomit up whatever was left in his stomach. Mr. DuBois leaped away with a cry of disgust. Shaking the muck off his shoes, he called out, \"Do you see anything in there, Sheriff?\" By then, Sheriff Quinn had ambled unsteadily across our barn to the small harness and tack room. That barn also had several storage rooms for cotton bales, if I am remembering correctly, a series of other empty animal stalls. Some moonlight usually came into that back room through chinks in the wood. We heard him shift several things around before he came walking back out, an extinguished lantern in hand. \"This was up on a ceiling hook. Its glass is still hot,\" he answered. \"It seems one of their saddles is missing along with their horse.\" Mr. DuBois forgot the matter of his shoes then. He snapped back around to face Frank, his nostrils flaring white. \"So is that what this is, you bastard?\" Frank tried to stumble backwards. Mr. DuBois pocketed the revolver and seized my brother by his filthy shirtfront. \"Is that it? You wait up the road with a spare horse saddled and ready, just in case? Is that how they said you would earn your share of the spoils? Or maybe you were planning to ride out and join them, but the Cain boy came in here in need of some help escaping! You were a part of this, weren't you? My father is dead, you damned filthy little bastard!\" As he bellowed all of this, Issac DuBois was shaking my brother the way a terrier shakes a rat. I had gotten my hand around his shoulder and was preparing to separate them when my ear caught the faint, oily sound of a bolt action being worked. Click as it locked in place. Bang. In that small space the gunshot was a monstrous noise. Wooden splinters flew everywhere. The hole is still there today, I believe, unless they have repaired it; it is on the barn's northern wall and is large enough for a man's fist to pass through. Mr. DuBois let go of my brother with a start, dropping Frank to the floor as he turned around along with the rest of us. My mother stood there with the Palmer rifle on her shoulder. \"Ms. Ross,\" Sheriff Quinn said, \"What are you doing?\" Mama did not answer, pulling back the gun's action instead. A smoking brass shell leaped out. She fit another bullet into the chamber and dropped the bolt, click. Then she braced herself against the door frame and fired again. Bang. More wooden splinters. Mr. DuBois cursed, and Sheriff Quinn ducked involuntarily. Frank had entered a kind of reeling stupor by now, but he still flinched at the noise as well. Mama lowered the rifle. \"I am sorry, gentlemen.\" Her eyes seemed to take up a good half of her face as they fell on Deputy Walker's body. \"The second shot was only to prove that my first was not an accident. If you would be so kind as to step away from my son, now, I would greatly appreciate it.\" Sheriff Quinn had pulled a pair of handcuffs from his belt loop. His own heavy hands were trembling as he did, and he shook his head. \"I cannot to that, Mrs. Ross. Your son will have to come with us.\" \"My brother is little more than a child,\" I protested, \"He will not be treated like a common criminal. Issac DuBois scoffed at me. \"Reformers up north can wag their tongues endlessly about the idea of juvenile court, Miss Ross, but I personally put no stock in it. Quinn, you are not going to this boy walk free, are you?\" Sheriff Quinn walked past Frank to sit back down by his deputy's body. The blood had dried to a black, viscid stain on the floor. \"No, no. I will pray a writ to the commissioner tomorrow morning. Issac, if you would like to include a personal statement or a letter, that may be...that may be used as a formal complaint.\" \"But Frank is staying here with us,\" I insisted. \"You will not keep him chained up like an animal. Please, Sheriff.\" Sheriff J. W Quinn drew a small tin flask out from is coat. He pulled the little cork and tipped it back. His hair was all stuck up at different angles. \"I am sorry, Miss Ross. Your brother will remain lodged in the Russellville jail until a writ of capias is issued, at which point he will be brought before Mr. Wilson to answer for the charges against him.\" \"Which are?\" \"The murder of Deputy Walker,\" Mr DuBois said. \"And accomplice to robbery, if I have anything to say about it.\" Frank had not gotten up from where Mr. DuBois had dropped him, and he looked over at Mama. \"Say, Mama,\" he croaked. \"That is twice Mattie has said 'please' now just this evening. Haw. Must be a special occasion.\" There was no courthouse in Dardanelle, in those days, though a perfectly fine one was built just three years later. The only circuit court for Yell County was located in Danville, and they took my brother there for his preliminary examination three days later. The U.S Commissioner Mr. Wilson confirmed that there was indeed probable cause and evidence for maintaining a criminal proceeding here; little else could be expected, of course, when a man was being charged with murder. Three days after that saw the defense attorney J. Noble Daggett boarding a steamboat to Dardanelle. The bail bonds holding Frank were too high for us to pay, although Victoria suggested we free him by burning down the Russellville jail. That, she said, was what the Texas man Bloody Bill had done to escape. I reminded her that Bill Longley was hunted down shortly thereafter, and apprehended, and hung, and it was no less than he had deserved. Three young people were noticed boarding a Missouri Pacific train in Little Rock. Two of them were later said to have resembled the posters for Will and Lizzy Garrett. The third was a boy estimated at about sixteen years of age with wide-set green eyes. Six days later they were putting together a grand jury to determine whether or not Frank would stand trial. All of the men were chosen as random from the Dardanelle tax roll. I do not believe any of them had known my father. A full week proved sufficient time for the press to go about things in their usual eviscerating manner. Looking at a sample of the \"yellow\" journalism that was spun around my brother's case, one might be led to think that the good citizens of Arkansas honor the law more in its breach than its observance; The Dardanelle Post-Dispatch was quick to inculpate Frank, reminding its readers how the loss of a father at the tender age of eleven would likely compromise a young man's ability to reason. The Russellville Courier hearkened back to the days when such callous murderers were branded with hot tongs, and included a long quote from the recently widowed Ms. Josephine Anne Walker. I forget now what her statement was. A gentleman from the The Democrat Gazette also came to our door with hopes of obtaining a photograph of Frank. He introduced himself to me as Phineas Beauregard, as if that fact alone would arouse my compliance by way of pity, and informed me that the photograph was to be run alongside a \"scoop\" he was writing. I had by then taken to keeping the Colt .38 New Line Revolver in my pocket and informed Mr. Phineas Beauregard that Chapter CLIII of the Arkansas State Constitution, which addresses the felony of trespassing, would find me in the right if I shot him. Just outside of Dallas, two men and a young woman climbed aboard a Texas & Pacific railway train and robbed the express car. The night before Frank's case was to go before a grand jury, I was lying awake in bed. I was going over the events of Saturday, June 24th, 1882, trying to account for all of the minutes between the first and last gunshots. One, two, three, five, nine, ten. I thought of how long it had taken to saddle Gertrude under normal circumstances. I thought of the little revolver with its curious spur-style trigger. An accident. Frank had said it went off by accident. I would see Thomas Cain's face whenever I closed my eyes, Thomas Cain's frightened face as the brass lantern swung up like a pendulum to illuminate it. And I would see it be replaced by Frank's solemn and accepting one, as he stood there spinning the revolver's cylinder. Tick-tick-tick. That was what I was imagining, when I heard Victoria's voice call out to me from across the bedroom we shared. \"Mattie?\" I opened my eyes in darkness and turned my head aside to look at her. A shaft of moonlight from our window fell across her bed. My sister looked very small, curled up there as she was; her voice sounded small, too, as she whispered, \"I had a strange dream.\" One hand was pulling the covers up to her cheeks. Her fingers were all clasped tightly around the fabric. Mama had embroidered little pink tea roses and green leaves onto her sheets a long time ago, back when the sheets had been mine. \"Did it frighten you?\" I asked. Victoria pursed her lips and rubbed one cheek against the pillow. I supposed that was a way of shaking her head. \"No. It was a dream about Frank.\" I did not answer for a moment. I was considering the rifle bullets as they had flown from my sister's hands, that careless scattering the seconds and minutes. Tick-tick-tick. \"Was it,\" I said. Now she nodded. A curl of her hair bobbed drowsily up and down in the moonlight. \"Mm-hm.\" \"Are you going to tell me what happened?\" \"I am getting to that.\" She sat herself up on one sharp elbow. \"In my dream, I was standing on the porch with you. We were looking out into the cotton field, and we spotted Frank walking towards us from a long ways off.\" \"That is not strange. If you wish to talk, Victoria, you had best save it for the morning.\" \"But he was wearing Papa's mason apron. Don't you think that is even a little strange? He was out walking in the field, but he was wearing a thing that belonged to Papa.\" Excitement raised her voice above a whisper. \"You hollered something to him. That was what had made him start walking towards home.\" \"What did I say?\" \"Not say. Holler. You hollered 'ven fuera,' just like in the Midnight Caller game.\" Victoria was right. Whoever was assigned the role of protagonist would say those near the story's end, to make the Caller show itself. Papa had made the game up while he was traveling in southern California, basing it off of another ghost story people tell down there about a woman called La Llorona . I had always guessed the words to be nonsense. A frown came suddenly between my brows. \"You said Frank was wearing Papa's mason apron?\" \"Mm-hm. In my dream.\" Papa had been wearing his Master Freemason's apron when they buried him. I myself had not attended the funeral, being occupied with the business of Chaney, but I knew Yarnell was always good on his word. \"It was likely not Papa's you imagined,\" I said. Victoria had been four years old when our father died. She would be nine in the fall. \"You are too young to really remember what his apron looked like.\" \"Well, I do,\" she responded obdurately. \"It was made of white lambskin and lined all in blue. It was very soft.\" I turned my attention back to the slanted eaves above my bed, which had always seemed to be pressing down upon me with a soundless, insistent patience. Victoria's voice fell to a whisper again. \"I wish Papa was here. Don't you?\" My eyes closed. Tick-tick-tick. \"It matters little what I wish. He is not here, I am. That should be enough.\" There was quiet for a while. I finally heard the sheets slide against each other as Victoria shifted to face the wall. She said no more to me after that, though when I looked over again I observed that the rise and fall of her shoulders was somewhat irregular. The grand jury delivered their indictment the next morning. There is no need to recite it from memory, as I have kept a written copy in my possession. \"And so the jurors, upon their oaths, do say that Frank Douglas Ross did kill and murder Deputy Aaron Walker by the means aforesaid, contrary to the law and against the peace and dignity of the State.\" But the judge in Danville could hear only civil cases, which meant that the State of Arkansas vs. Ross would go to the federal court; in the Western District of Arkansas in 1882, that meant a journey upriver to Fort Smith. And to the court of Judge Issac Parker. \"Mattie,\" Frank asked me on the train, \"Is it true that the nickname for him out there is 'The Hanging Judge'?\" Lawyer Daggett was seated across the aisle, reviewing a list of witnesses, but he paused to glance over at us. He was a trimly mustachioed man about of fifty years, with a smart tidy figure and brown hair that was graying at the sides. Mama was by the window with both hands laid placidly in her lap. Victoria sat between them and angled her jaw up in a declared refusal to look my way; she had not spoken to me since the night before Frank was indicted. I pulled Papa's black open-crowned hat down further. There was a crinkling from the pleated paper I had stuffed inside it. \"That is misconception talking. Federal law mandates that a judge hand down the death sentence to any persons found guilty of murder or dishonoring a woman. The judge himself is just an instrument. Parker's court has authority over the Indian Territory and happens to see most of the unsavory characters who are caught there. That is all.\" The whole time we were speaking, my eyes stayed facing forward. \"But I would like to know who told you such a horrid rumor.\" \"Ethan Price. He said his brother Luke was up there for that first quadruple hanging back in 1875. He said they call that court 'The Parker Slaughterhouse.'\" \"The Price brothers could not make one fully functional brain between the two of them. You put that comment out of your mind and do not think of it again.\" \"Alright.\" Frank turned his attention down again to the handcuffs they had put him in, and began to tug the short chain back and forth in a restless, rhythmic fashion. Ching-ching-ching. It was a bright rattling noise that put my mind on LaBoeuf's spurs, ching-ching-ching with their big fancy rowels . Tick-tick-tick. I soon asked for Frank to stop his fidgeting. Fort Smith had changed little. It still seemed to me like a place that did not belong in Arkansas, with its wide center street and dirty field-stone buildings. The Monarch boardinghouse had not changed either, though the rates had been raised to $1.00 a night with two meals and $1.25 with three. When Mrs. Floyd found out who Mama was she made a very big to-do about putting us up for the night, us being Mama, Victoria, Lawyer Daggett and myself. A marshal had met us at the train station and taken Frank to stay in a prison under the Federal Courthouse. The gallows remained standing hard beside it, though they had put up a wall several years earlier to close it off from the public. (The Fort Smith gallows had been designed to hang twelve men at a time, but I believe the most they ever did at once was six.) We went there the next morning, while they were empaneling a jury; it was composed of ten white men and two colored men. No Indians were permitted to sit in court. One of the complaints often voiced by Judge Parker's Indian prisoners, in fact, was that they were not truly tried by a jury of their peers. I believe the argument holds some merit, but you cannot go about thinking that the whole word is set against you: it is a manner of thinking that will not get you very far. Men had packed themselves into the courtroom, as many as had come to see Odus Wharton's trial, and there was a great deal laughing and passing bottles of whiskey about. You would think strong spirits at 8:30 in the morning would offend even the crudest man's sensibilities, but I am in a position to know that such is not the case. Some of these men looked up at us as we entered the courtroom with Lawyer Daggett. \"Why are there so many people?\" Mama asked in a hushed voice. \"Do they think this is a revival meeting?\" Or rather, I suppose most of the men were looking at my mother. I myself glanced over at her as she walked beside me, and I can still see her in that moment. My memory has held to it like albumen paper. Her dress was Prussian blue moiré, a gift Papa had given her after Victoria was born; she had kept it wrapped up with paper inside a trunk and had not worn it until now, though when she had first opened Papa's package and held the dress against herself she had cried. White lace lined the dress' collar and covered her arms below the wide pagoda sleeves. Metal buttons darted down its bodice. Her hair was pulled into a low chignon bun at the nape of her neck. And many of the men inside that courtroom, too ill-mannered to have removed their hats prior, did so as my mother passed by. Some of them nodded. Some of them stood up. Mama's step beneath the pleated skirts was serene, and methodical, and I realized that this was how my father must have seen her. \"They think they have come to see a show,\" I answered at last. \"I am afraid they will be disappointed in that regard.\" Lawyer Daggett was already seated beside Frank. I heard him mentioning to my brother, beneath the surge and recession of voices, \"...And remember that you are only required to answer yes or no during a cross-examination. Yes or no. That is all you have to say.\" Mama and I slid into the bench directly behind them. Frank turned to look at Mama but avoided my eyes. Then we stood, and the courtroom silenced, as the judge entered. When I had first looked at Judge Parker, five years ago, I had praised him in my mind as a judge who would rely more on the Good Book's teachings of an eye for an eye than on what I am sure he considered to be Blackstone's mumbo-jumbo about the administration of justice. He had those same still blue eyes, that same brown billy goat's beard, but suddenly I found its appearance to be distinctly Mephistophelean in quality. Reaching his stand, the Judge set both hands down on the wood and spoke. He did not sit, so neither did we. \"I hereby open session for the Federal Court of the Western District of Arkansas. The date is July 2nd, 1882. The trial is of Mr. Frank Douglas Ross from Dardanelle, Yell County. Secretary Stephen Finch, are all of the witnesses present?\" There was a man in his sixties over by the window, taking down a court transcript in shorthand. He stood up to answer. Large sweat stains were forming about his collar and arms. \"Your Honor. Present are the witnesses Sheriff J.W Quinn and Mr. Issac DuBois for the prosecution, and Miss Martha Ross for the defense.\" Judge Parker seated himself at last, with perhaps a bit more quiet fluidity than a man of his stature should have been able. There is always a certain dignity about persons of stature, you may have noticed: a quality of being more present than most, occupying the space in time which God has allotted them with something like authority. \"Accused Frank Ross,\" he asked, sending his gaze at my brother with the straightened efficacy of a crossbow bolt, \"born May 15th, 1866, have you received a copy of the indictment?\" \"Yes.\" \"Yes, what?\" \"Yes, your Honor. I have.\" And Judge Parker nodded. Just once, almost imperceptibly, before he went on talking. \"Would you read the true bill for us, Secretary Finch?\" \"Yes, your Honor. Of course.\" The formal true bill was longer than the indictment I had been given a copy of. It took Mr. Finch some time to get through it, mostly because he continued to loose his place. \"Your Honor, the accused Frank Douglas Ross is charges with murder and assistance to robbery, i.e crimes covered by Articles I and II of Division III, Article III of the Division IV, Chapter XLIV of the Constitution of Arkansas. On Saturday, June 24th, 1882, the accused is believed to have shot Deputy Arron Walker dead and aided in the escape of fugitive Thomas Cain, also of Dardanelle, Arkansas, who had robbed the bank of Issac DuBois alongside know fugitives William and Elizabeth Garrett of Beaumont, Texas.\" My eyes were on Mama just then, looking at the sharpness of her profile as she tightened her jaw, so I did not see the look on Judge Parker's face as he asked, \"Accused Frank Ross, how do you plead to the charges brought against you?\" \"Not guilty, sir.\" \"Prosecution is conducted by District Attorney W. H.H Clayton.\" Parker did not even need to look at the papers set in front of him as he spoke. \"The accused is defended by Attorney-at-Law Joseph Noble Daggett. I must explain that they have the right to put questions to the witnesses and the accused, respectively, and also to submit explanations on any questions that may form the subject of the investigation. Has the prosecutor any questions to make?\" The prosecutor in Parker's court was a man named William Henry Harrison Clayton. He had a white ducktail beard and a severe countenance, the effect of which was accented by a round pair of spectacles that sat high up on the bridge of his nose. Why he insisted upon being referred to only as W. H.H Clayton in all of the federal records, I do not know. I do know that he and Judge Parker worked together for fourteen years, all told. \"No,\" answered the Lawyer Clayton. \"Has the Counselor for Defense?\" And I realize there is something I must tell you about Lawyer Daggett, as well. He had been in the war between the states alongside my father; that is how they had come to know each other, in the fighting at Elkhorn Tavern and Chickamunga up in Tennessee. It had been Lawyer Daggett who saw Papa home to be cared for when he was injured, who had been wounded himself that same year at the Battle of Missionary Ridge when a 12-pound shell went off in the midst of his infantry. His back had been badly burned, Mama once told me, and peppered with shrapnel that had needed to be dug out. It had caused the skin to heal oddly, tightened and stiff in places and with a polished smoothness like glass from the heat. So I knew how it must have hurt him, to stand up as straight as he did just then. \"No, your Honor.\" \"Well then, Lawyer Daggett, I suppose we may proceed. Court confirms the proceedings for investigation, as proposed yesterday by Secretary Finch, and is now in session.\" My brother had both hands in his lap, but began tapping one on the little table he was seated at. A few men laughed amidst the temporary confusion and shuffle after Judge Parker opened the court, and I remember thinking to myself that Rooster likely would have found this reversal of fortunes amusing as well. I could not guess at what LaBoeuf would have to say on the matter. But then of course, there is no telling what is in the minds and hearts of men. A/N: I had originally meant for this chapter and the trial itself to be all together, but got itchy and impatient and decided to split it up. Law is not my forte: any tips for accuracy would be greatly welcome, along with any of the usual questions or comments. To those who are still reading, thank you for your patience. The trial is already partly written, so it should be up within a much shorter time frame! ","Summary":" Oh my. Another, what will be considerably longer, fix fic.

I can't believe how fast everything has been happening. Winter and Hope get along. Sawyer's gone, but coming home in an hour. When did life start moving so fast? \"Hazel, are you coming to help put up the streamers?\" My dad yelled. \"Ya, I'll be right down.\" I yelled back. We were decorating the aquarium for Sawyer's return and I was in charge of putting streamers up around Winter and Hopes pool while everyone set up around the outside of the building. I was standing on the ladder taping up the streamers when Winter and Hope started splashing the water at me. So when I started to climb down the ladder I slipped and began to fall into the pool below. I began to sink. Winter screeched. She tried to push me above water, but then I would just go back under. Hope would screech every once and a while. I would go in and out of consciousness. My head and back hurt like crazy. Then I heard a familiar scream, \"Hazel! Clay! Winter!\" Sawyer. I knew that voice anywhere. \"Hope.\" I only had to say one word and she screeched. \"Winter! Hope! What's wrong?\" I heard footsteps. I could feel my eyes closing. \"Hazel!\" I looked up to see Sawyer's face. \"Sawyer.\" I said my voice weak. \"Hazel, stay awake. How long were you down there?\" His voice was obviously worried. I wasn't in the water anymore. \"About a hour.\" His eyes widened. \"My head hurts.\" \"I know. Just look at me and stay awake.\" He lifted me off the ground. \"Does anyone know your here?\" I looked up at him. \"No, I came in through the back. Where is everyone?\" \"Out front. I think.\" I looked at his face. It started to burr and then darkness. \"Hello! Where am I?\" I screamed into darkness. Light appeared and I saw a face I never thought I'd see again. \"Mom!\" I hugged her afraid if I let go she would disappear. \"Turn around.\" I let go of her and saw Sawyer holding me on the ground crying. \"I've missed you, Mom. Why'd you have go go? I need you. Sometimes I just feel so alone. Sawyer has been gone for forever and Dad is usually to busy.\" I cried. \"I know, but it was my time and I couldn't do anything about it.\" \"I know that mom, but it still hurts. Everyday I wonder if your proud of me and if your watching me, but I always think your to busy to pay attention. Dad always tells me that you loved me more than anything, but if never helps. I pretend to be fine. In front of Dad, it's like I'm hiding behind a smile. I know I'm not the only one that misses you, but I think I miss you the most. You left when I was 7. I didn't know that I was saying goodbye forever. No matter how much I cry and try to forget or move on it still hurts.\" I broke down in tears. \"I know it does, but keep fighting. Don't go into the light.\" My eyes opened to appear Sawyer's crying face. \"Hazel, I thought you were going to to leave me.\" He cried. \"Don't worry, I'm not going into the light just yet.\" I smiled remembering what my mom told me. \"Come on. Let's go find everybody.\" He smiled and lifted me up again. \"I'm surprised that after how much noise Hope and Winter made no one bothered to check on them.\" He opened the door. \"Doctor Clay!\" \"Sawyer, your- Hazel! What happened?\" Dad asked franticly. \"She fell into Winter and Hope's pool and was apparently in there for a hour.\" Hazel suddenly burst into tears. \"Hazel, what's wrong?\" Dad looked at me worried. \"I saw mom.\" \"What? Did you hit your head?\" \"Yes, but I really did see her. She told me not to go in to the light.\" \"Sawyer, set her down. We need to check her injuries.\" Hazel hissed in pain when they laid her on her back. \"What hurts?\" \"My back and head.\" \"So you probably don't appreciate me laying you on your back.\" \"Not at all.\" They rolled me onto my stomach. \"Hazel, stay here. Don't move.\" A few minutes later, my dad and Sawyer returned with Ms. Nelson , but then my dad drug Sawyer away. \"Hazel, what happened? She looked at me worried. \"Well this is what climbing down a wet ladder can do to you.\" \"How about we go back to my house and get you cleaned up.\" She helped me get to the car and then drove away. \"I guess your glad Sawyer is finally back home.\" She smiled. \"Ya, I'm my glad my family is finally back together.\" \"It seems like your glad he's home too.\" \"Ya, I guess. It's just just I wanted today to be perfect, but instead I almost drown.\" \"No matter what happened you to reuniting is perfect.\" \"I know that, but Sawyer is the only person that I don't have to hide behind a smile in front of.\" \"Here we are.\" She helped me out of the car and laid me down on the couch. \"Don't move, I'm going to go get some bandages For your back.\" She returned a few minutes later with a few rolls of bandages. She began to roll them around my torso while I laid on my stomach. She brought me over to a chair while she unrolled the couch. She disappeared into the next room and I went over to lay down on the couch bed. She returned a few minutes later with a thick blanket and a cold wash cloth. She began put the blanket over my body and put the washcloth on my forehead. Before I knew it I faded into darkness. I opened my eyes and saw Sawyer's face. I looked at him with a blank expression. \"Smile.\" He looked at my face. \"No, with you I don't have to.\"[Chapter 2] I've had a few messages asking me to continue this story. Should I keep writing or leave it as it is? -Sparklyglitterglue[Chapter 3] Some people say I'm lucky, but I'm not as lucky as I may seem to be. My mom died. I made one promise to her and I'm not sure if I can keep it. I literally have to hide who I am. Only one person in life understands me. Sawyer Nelson. He's the only one who is stopping me from doing something I will regret. I have to admit the day I fell off the ladder in to the pool, I wanted to drown. I wanted to make Winter stop trying to save me. I wanted to disappear. I wanted to take that last breath and die. On that day I was hiding who I really am from myself. There are two reasons I want to disappear. 1. No one knows who I really am. 2. I want to be with mom. There are also things holding me here. Sawyer. Dad. Winter. Hope. The aquarium. Life. My future. If I died I would hurt Dad. When Mom died, he cried. He cried a lot. He would barely talk during those days. Sometimes he wouldn't even come eat dinner. I can't do that to him. Sawyer. He cried when I went unconscious. I can't even imagine what would happen to him if I died. I feel like he would come after me. I would hate myself if he did. He has a life ahead of him. He deserves to live. Winter and Hope. They are two of my best friends. I can't imagine life without them even if I was with Mom. The aquarium. If Dad does something wrong. If he becomes depressed. The aquarium will shut down. Winter and Hope will probably be separate. They would separate Sawyer and Winter. They need each other. I don't want to be known as the girl who gave up. The girl who was lived at the marine hospital. The girl who ended her life. Even if I hadn't it realized until now it doesn't matter. I do have reasons to Smile . I decided I would continue the story. Sorry for the short chapter. - Sparklyglitterglue[Chapter 4] My life is wonderful. I know what I'm fighting for. I have a secret. Its so big I can't even tell myself. This is about the time I start to miss Mom. I could really use her advice. \"Hazel! Are you up there?\" Sawyer screamed from below the crow's nest. \"Ya, why?\" \"They picked up a stranding. It's a male bottle nose.\" \"I'm coming down.\" As soon as my feet touched the ground, Sawyer and I ran as fast as we could towards the aquarium. \"Dad! Where are you?\" Dad walked through the door towards us. \"Hazel, I need you to stay with Hope and Winter. Sawyer, come with me.\" Before I could do anything Sawyer started following Dad in the other direction, so I just started towards Winter and Hope's pool. \"Hey girls.\" Winter started making the tweety bird sound at me. Soon enough Hope joined in too. \"What do you want Winter? Duck?\" I held the duck ring near her nose and she did what I had feared. She flipped me into the water. I grabbed onto her fin and we started swimming around the pool with Hope swimming beside us. There's something amazing about dolphins. They are almost human or are we just little dolphin. In the water, they can do whatever we do, but it's almost like they wait for us to do it before they try. They can flip. They can swim. They can twirl. They can wave. They can jump and dive. In their own way it makes them a little human. To me that doesn't matter. To me they are human. They're my friends. It doesn't matter what they are. No matter what they will always be my friends. I was hugging Winter as close as possible. \"I will always love you.\" \"Hazel, he's here.\" I heard Sawyer from the other side of the room. He came and sat on the platform. His feet dangling in the water. I swam over to him and sat beside him. \"Just like I told Winter, I will always love you.\" We found ourselves leaning towards each other lips apart.

At first everything was black and I was scared, but then I saw my mom. For a while I talked to her about my feelings and all that and I was happy, but then she looked at me with a upset face and I knew it was time for me to go. She said one last thing to me before she left. She told me not to go into the light.

The humidity of the Peruvian forest swallowed them and made the waxy leaves on billowy trees hang especially low. Such surroundings only accentuated Chicha's claustrophobia as they voyaged up the mountain. Much to Micos' excitement (and her dismay), Chicha had finally become of age and it was time to find her a suitable husband. None of lowly, uneducated men in her village would do for her proud and obstinate father, so he sought out other prospects, connecting with any and every contact he knew in search for a man fit enough to care for his prized daughter. Despite a lifetime of living in the mountains, the high altitude proved to be troublesome for her father's weakening lungs. The duo stopped briefly as Micos weathered an especially tumultuous coughing attack. He smiled meekly at Chicha, then they continued on. Chicha worried often about her father and how he would fare living alone. Her mother passed away when she was young, so taking care of Micos became her favorite title. She was the only person who could conquer her father's hard-headedness. She would have been content living in the same village as her father while raising her own family, but Chicha was willing to sacrifice her happiness at the expense of erasing her father's potential worry. She inherited her mother's selfless devotion to her family, along with her strong wit and determination. They had received news from a messenger that an old friend of her father's had a son in search of a wife to take with him as he began his job as one of the emperor's consultants. He was good-looking and promised with a hefty salary and a luxuriant life in the city. \"This is all you could ever want,\" Micos told her as they packed for their four-day hike to meet her new husband. \"This is all I could ever want for my daughter.\" \"I didn't know you loved me so much that you wanted to ship me off to a village a four day's trip away,\" Chicha added playfully, and the two laughed. \"See the clearing over there,\" her father lifted his knobby walking stick at waved it at the opening between the trees. \"Past there is our destination. We have finally reached it. Come, daughter,\" he said. Chicha tried to smile for her father, but the continuing feeling of claustrophobia lingered and she trudged along the path. These trails were unfamiliar to her, the birdcalls and plants essentially alien. She wondered if she would have anything in common with this new suitor, or if she had the strength in her to fake her own happiness in their marriage. They made it past the clearing and were welcomed by the clamor of this foreign village. Chicha smiled at several of the people in the streets, and thankfully her smile was returned. Her father stopped once to ask a group of women for directions, and they all wordlessly pointed to the top of the village. After what seemed like an eternity, Micos and Chicha finally approached a modest house surrounded by farmland. Despite its domineering presence on top of the mountain, it was evident that this family had just as much money as Micos. Her father knocked on the rusty door and it opened almost immediately. \"Micos!\" a burly man about the same age as him exclaimed and gathered him in a hug. \"It has been far too long! I am beyond thrilled that such exciting events have brought us together again.\" \"Indeed, Raymi,\" her father chuckled as he placed a hand on his friend's shoulder. \"I would like for you to meet my daughter, Chicha.\" Micos ushered for her to come closer to the door, and she obliged. Raymi took her hand in his. \"My, Micos, she looks just like your wife. What a beauty,\" he sighed, then looked at her father. \"I now see why you kept her tucked away in your neck of the forest all these years. It is an honor to welcome you to my family.\" Chicha tucked a loose strand of her hair back into her green headband and smiled at him. \"If you knew my sense of humor, then you would understand why he kept me hidden from the world.\" Her father shot her a look as they entered the modest house. \"Chicha, this is my son, Sumac. I think you will enjoy each other's company,\" Raymi said, and gestured to the man standing in their living room. \"Why, hello, Chicha,\" said Sumac, and immediately Chicha was taken aback by his exquisite looks and rich voice. Although he wasn't tall, per say, his stance definitely exuded confidence. His rich, black hair was tied up neatly into a braid that fell at his shoulders, and his clothes accentuated his muscular build. His sharp features only added to his alluring presence. He had almond eyes that glistened as he sized up her narrow waist and childbearing hips. His ears adorned brandish gold earrings that indicated his educated status, and a grin that suggested he had mischievous things on his mind. Chicha sighed. He was just like the rest of them. \"Hello, Sumac. I've heard from some trusted sources that we would be compatible.\" One of Chicha's strongest features was her sarcasm, a trait she inherited after years of interacting with arrogant men like him. Sumac gave her a puzzled look, but brushed it off. \"Let me escort you to the dining room,\" he said and placed his hand on the small of her back—albeit a little past the small of her back—as he guided her into the room. The sheer movement alone irked Chicha tremendously, thus leading the evening off to an unsettling start.[Chapter 2] At the dining room table, Chicha was introduced to Sumac's mother, an aged woman who didn't speak at all to her but smiled warmly. She noticed that there was an empty spot at the dining room table. \"Who are we waiting for?\" Chicha eyed the idle seat as they passed around the food. \"Oh, that seat is saved for Pacha, Sumac's twin brother. He's usually too busy tending to the fields or the llamas to come for dinner, but we always save a hefty portion for him out of courtesy,\" Sumac's father said with a chuckle. \"I didn't know you had a twin brother,\" Chicha mused, genuinely curious. \"You wouldn't see the resemblance,\" Sumac said with annoyance. \"Such a simple man.\" \"Huh,\" was all Chicha could muster before digging into her meal. Dinner party conversation revolved mostly on Raymi and Micos reminiscing on their friendship stemming from their days trading at various markets. It pleased Chicha's heart seeing her father look so joyful. Years of mourning his wife aged him greatly, and he grew wistful leading up to the day of their departure. When Sumac's mother began pouring the after-dinner tea, an air of seriousness swept over the dining room table. \"Sumac intends to begin his position as consultant next week, and it takes roughly three days to travel to the city. It would look unfavorable for him to arrive without a wife,\" Raymi said in a hushed tone. \"So we push the wedding closer than anticipated?\" Micos suggested, to which Chicha almost spat out her tea. \"Next week?\" You want me to marry this guy in less than a week ?\" she sputtered, and looked at her father helplessly. \"It is not becoming of a consultant's wife to display such defiance amongst company,\" Sumac admonished, but Chicha ignored him. Instead, she looked at her father. The tiredness in his eyes was the only answer she needed. Marrying Sumac would mean that she would be wealthy, and without a doubt she would send money to pay for his medicine and everyday necessities. With a husband of high status, he would have no cause to fret about her, and she had no doubt that he spent many sleepless nights worrying about his beloved daughter. \"Forgive me… I'm just so… so caught off-guard, but perhaps learning more about our life together would answer questions I have about the unknown,\" Chicha said in hopes of deescalating the situation. \"Ah, I see,\" Sumac responded, and raised an eyebrow. \"The city is bustling with life. At every corner you'll find crowded markets selling the most decadent clothes and succulent delicacies. The streets won't reek of rancid rainwater like here in the country, and the maddening sound of frogs at night will be replaced with the bustling sounds of nightlife. Festivals every night, can you imagine? Our children will learn actual skills, none of this low-grade survival skills education that peasants learn. Our life will be fantastic.\" At this, Chicha abruptly stood up. \"Excuse me. With all of the excitement I've gotten a little overheated. I'm going to step outside for some fresh air,\" she said. Chicha hurried out of the room, thinking to herself over and over again: This is not what I wanted. This is not what I wanted. This is not what I wanted.[Chapter 3] Outside, the stars and vast sky welcomed her as sobs shook her body. She wandered aimlessly into some gated field and sank her knees into the damp ground as she buried her face in her hands. \"Wives of consultants don't typically dirty their dresses,\" said a rich baritone voice behind where she was kneeling. \"So I've heard,\" Chicha answered and rolled her eyes, clearly knowing that whoever spoke behind her wouldn't see it. \"Pardon me while I say goodbye to Mother Nature before joining the metropolitan hubbub.\" The person laughed heartily as they approached Chicha. Normally, Chicha would panic knowing that some mysterious stranger was closing in on her, but the tone of this mysterious person's voice was calm, good natured, and safe. \"Not many women around here want to stick around for the dirt and bugs. I'm impressed. Here, let me help you up,\" said the voice. Chicha looked up to see a ginormous beast of a man towering over her, shifting their weight to lend her a hand. Cautiously, she took it, and was amazed to see her hand dissolve in the vastness of his palm, how perfectly it enveloped hers like a corn wrapped in its husk. \"I grew up adoring dirt and bugs,' thank you very much,\" she said somewhat breathlessly as the mysterious man lifted her up in one smooth motion. Chicha's girlfriends back in her village said the same thing to her. \"Ah, Chicha, you better bring us back fine clothes! And sweets! How we envy you!\" Such conversations began to annoy her. Chicha tilted her head to get a better look at him as he emerged from the moonlight. This man cowered over her by a solid foot and a half, and his chest barreled out of him like a great Incan god. While some parts of him looked soft, he undoubtedly possessed the strength of three men, at least. His thick, dark eyebrows were poised in a quizzical expression as his deep-set eyes gazed into hers. He ran one of his thick hands over his messy black mane and then offered it to her. \"I'm Pacha.\" \"Chicha. Sorry you caught me at a bad moment,\" she said, motioning to her mud-stained dress. Pacha smiled wide. \"I'm sorry that I'm about to make your day worse,\" he replied, and pointed to her dress. \"That's not mud.\" \"What do you mean?\" Chicha asked, mildly panicked. \"Where are we right now?\" \"This is where we let the llamas free graze,\" he replied, and looked down at the grass. Horrified, Chicha out of frustration and snorted (something she did when she felt overly-emotional) and proceeded to storm off. \"Hey!\" Pacha called out. \"I can help you.\" \"Really?\" Chicha snarled. She turned back to face him. \"Well, I can help you get rid of that stain,\" he said and jerked his head to the right. \"Come.\" Together, they walked inside a dank hut with several stalls for their llamas. Chicha struggled to catch up to Pacha due to his long strides, but he was patient with her. \"That's Sol, he's the oldest one we have. And over there is Amkha, don't get too close to her or else she'll spit,\" he proclaimed, pointing out the llamas in each stall to Chicha. She noticed that each animal perked up at the sound of his deep voice and rushed to the end of their stall asking to be stroked. They finally reached a workstation of sorts. \"If you wouldn't mind,\" he said, and motioned for her to sit on the high table. He took a piece of cloth and began to blot out the stain. \"Thank you,\" she said genuinely. He looked up and smiled at her. \"I take it you spend a lot of time here.\" \"That's right,\" he boasted, and pulled out a stool for him to sit on. \"I take care of the land and our llamas. A simple life, but it brings me great joy.\" \"So Sumac really was right: I truly do not see the resemblance between the two of you,\" Chicha noted. \"My mother tells me we descended from giant mountain men,\" Pacha said, and gently dabbed at the stain. \"I'm not talking about physical characteristics. Why didn't you end up like a busy cityboy like him? You two could not be more different, \" Chicha implored. She became fascinated by the preciseness of his movements as he removed the filthy substance from her long dress. \"Ah,\" was all Pacha said and continued to work on her dress. Chicha grew impatient. \"Hey,\" she quipped, and gently placed her hand on the underside of his chin to lift up his head. They stared at each other, wordlessly, for what felt like minutes. In this silent exchange Chicha studied his wide eyes; they displayed such purity that could not be feigned. She followed the edges of his hooked nose, all the way to his lips, which were set in a grim smile. \"You clearly have a good heart. Why can't I seem to find that in your brother?\" she asked. They were still staring at each other. \"My brother is a good man, you simply value different things. He will take excellent care of you; anything you could ever want he will buy for you. The city may take some getting used to, but he will show you the way,\" Pacha stated, and stood up. \"I believe the stain is removed.\" \"How can I repay you?\" Chicha teased. \"It's nothing,\" he said, and dusted off his pants. He didn't look at her, though she clearly was. As he helped Chicha off the table, she couldn't help but again notice how carefully he carried her hand in his, and kept it safe, protected. Together, they walked back into the house and didn't mention their interaction to anyone. Chicha felt discomfort in the silence they shared as they entered the house, but didn't know exactly how to address it. Pacha's mother eyed them suspiciously, and, if Chicha wasn't mistaken, smiled at her before disappearing into the kitchen.[Chapter 4] \"Come in.\" Chicha kept her back to the door as she continued to braid her long, luscious hair before tucking it into her signature updo. In fact, not many people knew she had long hair, as the style she chose to keep it in was the same style that her mother used. Her customary green headband was sewn by her mother, and although it was ratty and worn, she never went without it. Her father walked in the room slowly. \"It was nice of them to give you a room to yourself,\" he commented as he observed the modest surroundings. \"I wish you would sleep here instead of on the floor in the living room,\" Chicha protested, and faced Micos, attempting to give him a harsh look. \"You know how much pain your back has endured.\" Her father waved off her comment and sat at the foot of her bed. \"You realize how happy your mother would be, now that you know the man you will marry. He will take excellent care of you and you will live the life I dreamed for you,\" her father said, and motioned for Chicha to sit down next to him. \"I have nothing in common with him,\" Chicha protested, and noticed that she was starting to cry. \"I will miss you so much.\" \"My dear Chicha,\" Micos sighed and reached over to wipe a tear, \"You are the closest remembrance I have to your wonderful mother. I will miss you more than you can imagine, but this is what is best for you.\" \"I understand,\" was all Chicha could say, and put her hand over her father's. \"I understand.\" Her father kissed her on the cheek and left the room. Just as Chicha got up from her bed she heard the door open again. \"Did you forget something, Fath-\" she began, only to see that it was Sumac at the door. \"I didn't realize that knocking was a custom only in my village.\" Sumac laughed loudly at her comment. \"Oh Chicha, we will be getting to know each other soon enough, I think it's perfectly acceptable to have an air of openness. Should I be cautious of what you might be doing behind closed doors in my house?\" he asked, then raised an eyebrow. \"Not at all,\" she remarked, and made way to her bed. \"If you would please excuse my exhaustion I think I'm going to go to sleep now.\" As she walked past him to get to the bed Sumac suddenly reached out and placed a forceful hand on her shoulder. \"Why are you so distant with me?\" he growled. \"Forgive me if I'm a little fatigued after hiking for four days. Next time I will ask for permission to go to sleep,\" Chicha said, and gave him an appalled look. \"People will see your defiance and question my authority at the emperor's palace,\" he admonished, and narrowed his eyes at her. \"Your attractiveness will be the envy of all men, and I can see that you have enough wit and charm to entertain even the largest dinner party. But if you refuse to be submissive to me then I highly doubt that you will enjoy the life of luxury I have planned for us.\" \"Is that what my life will be like with you? A timid housewife who tends to your drunken dinner guests and stays cooped up in the city all day long? Lucky for me I will be rewarded with jewels and fine silks and your stamp of approval,\" Chicha spat out, and moved past him. \"I would like to rest now.\" Sumac gave her a menacing glare. \"Women would envy the opportunity I have given you. I suggest you be a little more grateful,\" he said, adding a bite to each word. He slammed the door behind him, almost blowing out the candle due to sheer force. With this, Chicha sank into her bed and wept until sleep came upon her.[Chapter 5] Chicha always woke up unreasonably early. It was one of her mother's habits, tending to the house, fields, and animals with undisrupted silence while Chicha and her father slept. When she passed away, it was almost as if Chicha's body rewired overnight to do the same, and she began her days at dawn, listening to the echoes of her mother's spirit in the lonesome household. This morning, waking up in Sumac's house, proved to be no different. When she opened her swollen eyes, she noted the barely emerging sun peeking from her window, and rose from her bed. As she walked around the house, it became evident to her that the rest of its inhabitants were still asleep. She wandered into the kitchen and noted the loaf of bread still rising, not quite ready to be put in the oven. Chicha thought about cleaning the dining table (or anything, for that matter), but feared that would insult Sumac's mother if she saw her in action. Fidgety and restless, Chicha walked outside and breathed in the dewy morning air. This calmed her tremendously. She surveyed the plants that bordered their property and noted their flourishing features. Chickens were spread out sporadically around the fields, aimlessly picking at the earth. She walked closer to one of them and knelt down to stroke its neck. After several minutes, Chicha realized that she wasn't the only person enjoying the early morning dawn. Pacha slowly emerged from the llama stable and waved at her. Chicha tried to ignore the bubbling sensation of sheer joy she felt as she watched him approach. She opted not to stand up and greet him properly, instead continuing to feel the soft feathers between her fingers. Chicha marveled at how swiftly Pacha was able to stoop his bulky frame into a crouching stance opposite of her. Rather than being intimidated by him, many of the chickens hopped to his direction, begging to be pet. She couldn't help but chuckle. \"It seems like they trust you,\" she noted, and smiled at him. \"I trust them ,\" Pacha corrected, and returned her smile. She let his comment soak in the air, and nodded. \"It's hard to have faith in people sometimes.\" \"That's not what I meant. Watch,\" he lowered his already deep voice and made a poking motion in the dirt, \"if you pretend you're scavenging for something then they'll flock to you.\" She observed his tactic and copied his movements. Immediately, three more chickens meandered to her darting fingers, erratically tilting their heads to catch more seed. \"Animals, you see, sense a good heart. Once they know that it is there, and that you are willing to devote yourself to a sacrificial love, then they do not hesitate to do the same,\" Pacha continued. \"Are you implying that humans do not sense when someone has a good heart?\" Chicha implored. \"It just takes them longer,\" Pacha corrected, then looked at her and grinned. \"Not you,\" she said quickly. She moved her darting fingers closer and gently interlocked them with his, as a slender vine travels along a sturdy, aged tree trunk. This caused Pacha to avert his eyes and stare at the ground, but he didn't move his hand. If Chicha wasn't mistaken, she saw hints of red under his worn, sundried cheeks. \"As you can tell accepting compliments is a skill I have yet to acquire,\" Pacha said abashedly. \"You truly are an outstanding woman, Chicha. My brother is quite fortunate to have you as his wife.\" \"Well I wish—\" Chicha began, but Pacha interrupted her by firmly grasping her shoulder. His heavy-lidded eyes narrowed as he looked past her and onto a scattering of bushes by the llamas' grazing area. Chicha followed his trance and noticed something bustling in the shrub. The llamas, only yards away, were too busy picking at the grass to notice. In a flash, a large and stealthy creature the color of midnight barreled out of the bushes and encroached the group of llamas. \"No!\" bellowed Pacha, and hurled his body to the animal, but it dashed into the shrubs. In those brief moments, Chicha saw that this living specimen was a male black panther. She caught herself paralyzed in amazement by watching the animal's muscles ripple like fine cloth blowing in the breeze. Her eyes found Pacha, who hurriedly shepherded the llamas in the stable and was sealing the door. The precision and sureness in his movements amid the chaos impressed Chicha. \"What happened?\" she yelled, completely unsure of what to do. \"That panther has been lurking on our land for weeks,\" Pacha replied, tugging on the door in a harsh manner to ensure its security before turning to her. He had a spear in his hands. \"Get inside now.\" Chicha's signature stubbornness and occasional hot-headed temperament flared inside of her. She crossed her arms and kept her feet firmly planted to the ground. \"I'm not leaving you. I want to help.\" Pacha tightened his mouth. \"Chicha, I swear on every single god known to man that if you don't—\" An ear-splitting roar from the dense forest cut him off. The following series of events unfolded so quickly that Chicha was barely able to comprehend the grave danger she was in. The panther lunged from the trees. A scream escaped her lips as she tried to think of a plan with the milliseconds she had before the beast ravaged her body and attempted to harm Pacha. From the corner of her eye she saw him charge at the animal. She was only a few yards away from it, close enough to absorb the savage beauty of his emerald eyes and measure the unbounded strength of his forelegs. Just as the panther leaped up to sink its claws into Chicha, Pacha thrust the spear into the air and threw his body over hers. The fall should have hurt Chicha, damaged her in some way, but it didn't. Chicha kept her eyes closed, still fearful of the situation at hand. But she felt Pacha's thick hand cradle her waist, his heavy frame pressed against hers, his labored breathing brushing against her cheek. Her eyes fluttered open, and they were looking directly into Pacha's deep, dark irises. His eyebrows were knit in a concerned expression as he studied her, mere centimeters from her face. The grass beneath them felt crisp and cool, but the heat between their bodies easily counteracted that. He held her in that protective embrace for quite sometime, wordlessly, gazing at her. Chicha wasn't sure what became of the panther but just feeling his hand curve around her body instantly made her feel warm, and safe. Something had changed between them. \"You protected me,\" Chicha murmured, and immediately Pacha brought his lips to hers. They were so soft, so unlike the rest of his rugged and sturdy exterior that Chicha found herself more surprised by the texture of his lips than the actual kiss itself. Chicha breathed into the kiss and tasted the spiciness in his mouth. She wrapped her slender arms around his burly biceps and tugged at them to bring him closer to her. She found so many answers in that kiss. \"Why do I feel so strongly about you?\" Pacha whispered. Chicha was about to respond but Raymi, Micos, and Sumac rushed to the clearing. Pacha immediately stood up and hoisted her onto her feet in one swift motion. She, still wrapped up in what happened, could barely stand on her own and leaned into his frame for support. \"What happened here? A loud noise awoke us. Oh, my!\" Raymi gasped as he observed the carnage. The panther's body was sprawled a few yards from where Pacha and she were laying down, lifeless. The long spear that Pacha was holding earlier clearly found its target. \"Chicha and I were tending to the llamas when the panther attacked us,\" Pacha stated bluntly. \"And Pacha miraculously saved the llamas and me,\" Chicha boasted, and turned her body so that it was only facing him. She hoped that it would force Pacha to look at her in the eye, but instead made him stare at the ground, eyebrows furrowed. \"I owe my life to him.\" \"Ah, let us all gawk at the magnificent and daunting job of serving as our family's handyman and llama caretaker,\" Sumac replied, his voice full of sarcasm. \"Thank you, brother, for returning my wife without ruining her most valuable asset: her beauty.\" Chicha took one look at Sumac, so pristinely dressed and clean, and felt sick to her stomach. If Pacha was irritated by his brother's comment, he clearly didn't show it since he simply exhaled and neared the dead panther. The vivacious energy that radiated from its emerald eyes had vanished and instead were dull and glazed over. Pacha kneeled keenly over the animal, removed the spear from its underbelly, and smoothed over its glossy coat. He closed his eyes and began to move his lips. \"What a wretched animal,\" Sumac scoffed and forcefully nudged a chicken that was approaching his feet. \"It was a beautiful thing,\" she said softly, and took a place next to Pacha. Despite the near-death experience she just experienced, Chicha couldn't help but feel melancholy to see such a miraculous animal slain right in front of her. She leaned closer to Pacha to try and hear what he was saying. He was asking Urcuchillay, the god that watched over animals, for forgiveness. The action alone brought tears to her eyes. \"I am sorry my senselessness forced you to kill this creature,\" she whispered to him. He sighed, a sorrowful sigh, and replied, \"I am sorry for transgressing on your upcoming union with my brother. What I did was completely uncalled for, and I can assure you that I will no longer make foolish decisions.\" \"Pacha.\" He scooped up the limp animal and looked at her once more. \"The last thing I would ever want is for you to become injured. You have a strong, beautiful heart and will be an excellent wife to Sumac.\" \"You and I both know that is not what I want,\" Chicha pleaded, still whispering. \"You do not know what you want,\" Pacha shot back, angered by her resilience. \"You said this to me in the stable last night. I have nothing to offer, are you too blind to see that? Please, be the daughter your father expects of you and make both our families happy.\" Chicha, seared by his hurtful words, tried to fight back tears. She retreated to her future husband and feigned an expression of graciousness, hopefully masking the utter devastation she felt inside.

The natives created an empire built upon the fundamental belief that everyone, no matter their appearance or parentage, can succeed if they possess talent and a good work ethic. This was the philosophy heralded by the empire's benevolent Emperor, a bright young man in his early twenties named Cuntur. Under Emperor Cuntur's leadership, his people entered a glorious renaissance. Then it happened. From across the sea they came, yearning for treasure, thirsty for gold - willing to destroy everything in their path in order to satisfy their greed. Emperor Cuntur made the mistake of inviting them in with open arms. He believed that these pale faced men were the human incarnations of the great god, Quetzalcoatl. Cuntur's people paid dearly for this mistake. The invaders brought disease and despair to the native peoples. They stole all the land's riches, leaving nothing behind. A once wealthy populace was decimated. The only economic industry that survived the invasion was the undignified practice of llama herding. The invaders purposely sucked the life out of a once vibrant people. To add insult to injury, they even broke into the Emperor's palace in the dead of night and defiled his newlywed bride. However, Cuntur's people were resilient and refused to loose hope, even in the direst of circumstances. They slowly began to pick up the pieces, rebuilding their lives from the carnage. Sadly, they all knew that the wounds inflicted upon them by the heartless foreigners would never fully heal.[Chapter 2] Approximately 9 months later… The entire empire was holding its breath. Rumors were swirling that the Empress had gone into labor. People young and old cried tears of joy, llama herders left the fields to celebrate, scribes put down their quail feathered pens, merchants closed their shops. Everyone wanted to pay homage to the royal baby. The citizens' festive mood was in stark contrast to the bleak atmosphere of the palace. The public was unaware of the gravity of the situation. The Empress wasn't doing well. Months back she had contracted a bad case of smallpox's from one of the invaders. The pregnancy was also taking its toll on her. The Empress looked gauntly thin even with child. She was in no shape to deliver a baby. Now that the due date had come, she was ready to end her suffering. She whispered goodbye to her husband, Cuntur, and with her dying breaths she brought her daughter into this world. The little girl would one day be known throughout the lands. Her name will live on in infamy. Her name will become a synonym to shame. It will cause people throughout the empire to become scared beyond all reason. This little girl will grow up to be the bane of her nation. She will one day be referred to as the dreaded Yzma.[Chapter 3] Emperor Cuntur was a proud man. He was a strong man. He never showed any sign of weakness. But at the sight of his wife's lifeless body he completely lost it. This wasn't fair. Why did the Gods do this to him? To her? They ruled the empire kindly and justly. They didn't deserve this. She didn't deserve this. The voice of one of the servants broke Emperor Cuntur out of his grief induced trance. \"Would you like to meet your daughter?\" a nurse-maid sobbed. Still shaking from misery, the Emperor held out his arms and cradled the newborn in his arms. Unlike most newborns who scream and cry at birth, this child was unnaturally silent. Her big eyes stuck out like they were analyzing every detail of the room. Looking at the helpless babe Emperor Cuntur felt nothing but contempt. This was the parasite that sucked the life out of his beloved bride. Looking into the child's eyes Emperor came to a realization. He knew those eyes. Why were they so hauntingly familiar to him? He met them face to face in all his nightmares. They were the same eyes that belonged to the leader of pale-faced demons who stole his tears all those moons ago. The baby in his arms was no child of his! He shoved the child back into the nurse-maid's arms. Emperor Cuntur turned around to bark orders at the two guards stationed by the doors. \"See to it that preparations are in order for my wife's funeral.\" \"Should we tell the people about the child's birth?\" one of the guards asked. \"No\" Emperor Cuntur croaked. Tell them she lost the baby.\" The nurse-maid cleared her throat, \"the child is perfectly healt-\" \"Take it away\" The Emperor screamed. \"Take it away!\"[Chapter 4] The empire's celebrations were cut short by tragedy. It was as if someone had snuffed out the light. Citizens wept for the loss of their Empress and her little girl. Little did the mourners know but the baby was placed at the room at the top of the highest tower in the palace. No one knew about the child's existence except a select few palace servants who valued their lives too much to spill the secret. The lonely room at the top palace of the palace is where Yzma grew into a young woman. Soon she was all but forgotten except by the servants who slid her daily rations through the door. Emperor Cuntur soon remarried a noblewoman from a neighboring tribe, named Cava, who became the new empress. Within a year of the matrimony they had a beautiful baby girl and the empire rejoiced. All the while Yzma remained in her prison. She had only two links to the outside world. One was the servants' hushed whispers she heard through the wall. Yzma taught herself how to speak by mimicking their whispers. Her other link to to the outside world was a small window above her bedside table. One night Yzma was gazing up at the full moon, she heard a noise that startled her. The door to her room had been opened. Yzma let out a yelp and jumped down, hiding in the corner. For as long as she could remember the door had been shut. She thought it was a permanently closed fixture. A feminine voice called out from the doorway. \"So it's true then? You actually are imprisoned up here. I wasn't entirely sure you were real. The servants start loads of ridiculous rumors. Had I known you were really up here I would have knocked.\" Yzma pushed herself up against the wall. Who was this stranger? \"You don't have to be afraid. I'm not going to hurt you. We are sisters. My name is Urpi. What's your name?\" she smiled. Yzma shuddered. She didn't know how to respond. As far as she knew, she had no name. Urpi continued. \"Sorry for barging in here. I realize this is all a bit much to take in. I've never discovered a long-lost sister before so I'm not sure how to approach this kind of thing. The scribes don't make guidebooks for this sort of thing.\" Urpi took a deep breath. \"I can see that I'm overwhelming you. I will come back tomorrow night. That way we will both have a chance to process everything. It was so nice to meet you.\" Quickly as she had come Urpi left the room once again leaving Yzma all alone. \"Sister\" Yzma mumbled. The girl said she was her sister. She had said it with such enthusiasm in her voice. Yzma had never heard the servants use that word. Yzma didn't know what a sister is but she had a feeling that she would soon find out. And for the first time in forever she had something to look foreword to.[Chapter 5] The sun disappeared beneath the horizon. Any second now Urpi would appear. Yzma eagerly anticipated her arrival, glancing at the door every couple seconds. Finally, after what seemed like an enternity. Urpi peeked her head through the doorway. \"Hello I come bearing gifts.\" Urpi strolled over to Yzma's bed and laid a dark purple dress on the sheets. \"You know purple has always been my favorite color. Purple is beautiful and unique, as it is not as commonly found in nature as the other colors. But my mother never lets me wear purple. She says it is a child's color, not befitting a future ruler of the empire.\" Urpi signed, \"O and I also brought these.\" She held out a tray of food that gave off a heavenly aroma. Certainly more appetizing then anything Yzma had eaten before. \"Come on try one.\" Urpi encouraged. \"This is hands down the best dish in the whole land I swear to it. They are called spinach puffs. I would like to take credit and say I baked them but alas I did not. A young boy from the village down yonder makes them. He's extremely gifted, been baking desserts since before he could talk.\" The spinach puffs were so tasty that Yzma devoured them whole. Urpi then began to tell Yzma more about her life as a princess. She talked about her hopes and dreams. How she had no interest in ruling the empire. How she wanted to marry and settle down somewhere peaceful. Maybe on a nice hill in a llama herding village. Urpi also told Yzma stories about people from all walks of life from across the empire. This went on every night for a couple weeks. Yzma was enthralled by ever single word. She even dared to dream of a world beyond the walls of her room. One night Urpi came in proclaiming that she had run out of stories. Yzma looked downcast. \"Don't worry\" Urpi reassured her. \"I brought something even better! It's a book of fairy tales the nursemaids used to read to me. Here I will read you one.\" From then on, it became a nightly occurrence for Yzma to listen to tales as old as time. Urpi's storybook brought to life a mystical world filled with gingerbread houses, magic mirrors, and fairy godmothers. One night Urpi read a story about a beautiful long haired maiden stuck in a tower. When the story concluded, Yzma spoke. \"That is my favorite.\" Urpi's jaw dropped. \"Of all the stories you've read. It's my favorite. I relate to the girl in the tower.\" \"You can talk?\" Urpi stammered. \"Yes.\" \"Then why haven't you said anything before?\" \"I never had anything meaningful to say.\" Urpi smiled, \"Every word ever spoken has some meaning behind it.\" \"Every word\" Yzma repeated. \"Yes, Wow this is such a relief I wasn't even sure if you could understand me. Speaking of which what would you like me to call you. Do you have a name?\" The girl who would become known as Yzma shook her head. \"That's alright\" Urpi reassured her. \"We will think of something to call you. I promise.\" Gradually the two grew closer as if they were sisters. Urpi would visit every night promptly at nine-o-clock. Some nights Urpi would give Yzma reading lessons, other nights they would sneak onto the palace roof via Yzma's window. One night as they laid on the roof, Urpi was telling Yzma about all the constellations in the sky. But Yzma had no interest in llamas found in the night sky. Something was weighing down on her. \"Urpi, Can I ask you something?\" \"Ask away.\" \"You know how all the characters in the book you read have a mother and father. Or at least a mention of them. Well I was just wondering: who are my parents?\" Urpi, \"Our father is the Emperor.\" \"Our? So we really are sisters.\" \"We share the same father but not the same mother.\" Yzma looked puzzled, \"Is that why am I in the room and you aren't?\" \"That's is something I have kept asking myself ever since I found you. The truth is that I don't really know why you have been locked away all these years. From what I've heard your mother, the former Empress, died during labor. Our father in some twisted way of dealing with his grief probably locked you away in an effort to numb the pain. That's what father does best. Place his own concerns above everyone's else in the entire empire.\" Urpi spat bitterly. \"Just to add insult to injury, after your mother's death he signed a new law into decree. He made it a requirement that when ready to start a family, every young man must go to the temple of Ocllo, the fertile goddess. Once there he must sacrifice his best livestock to the goddess. The sacrifice is to ensure that both mother and child are happy and healthy. That hypocrite. If he had any sense at all he would abolish that silly law and concentrate on being a decent father to the both of us.\" \"What was her name?\" \"Whose name?\" \"My mother's.\" \"Her name was Yzma.\" \"Yzma\" the word lingered on her lips. \"I like it. Can my name be Yzma?\" \"Whatever you say Yzma\" Urpi laughed. Both girls were too wrapped in their conversation to notice someone approaching them from behind. \"I am disappointed in you, Urpi\" said a man with a gruff voice. They spun around to find the Emperor towering down at that. \"Daddy I can explain\" Urpi began. \"No I don't want to hear it. There's no excuse for what you've done. How do you think I feel? The stress of running an empire and I can't even get a good night's sleep. Do you know why? I have servants knocking on my door in the dead of night informing me that my daughter is alone on the roof with a questionable character. So now I had to climb up here and fetch you.\" The Emperor shrieked \"If you would just listen.\" \"No you haven't earned the right for me to listen. Your actions are inexcusable. Nothing you say will change that. Go back to bed.\" The Emperor commanded. Urpi signed but did as she was told. \"As for you\" Emperor Cuntur made a conscious effort not to look at Yzma as he spoke. \"If you value your limbs I suggest you go back to your room. And while you are at it stay away from my daughter.\" Yzma couldn't help but mentally note how he put emphasis on that last word. She didn't know how to respond to her father. So she listened and went back to her room. The next night, Yzma eagerly awaited Urpi's visit. But Urpi never made an appearance. The second night came and went but still no Urpi. Yzma was going sick with worry cooped up in her room. She needed to get her mind off of Urpir and her father. Naturally, she picked up a book and began reading. However, this was no fairytales book, it was a book detailing animal physiology. It gave Yzma so very interesting ideas. Very interesting indeed. Finally on the third night Urpi frantically shoved open Yzma's door. \"You need to go. Now\" Urpi panted. \"Go?\" Yzma asked. \"Why?\" \"Father is absolutely livid about the other night. He has convinced himself that you are the source of all the empire's problems. He has scheduled your execution for dawn.\" \"He wants me dead?\" \"I realize this is a lot to take in but you have time to grieve later. Now we have to get you out of here.\" \"Alright I'm ready.\" Yzma grabbed her animal physiology book and bolted out of the room. She didn't even look back. Urpi guided her through a complex series of corridors until they were just outside the palace's gates. Urpi pointed ahead. \"You see that trail. Follow it, it will lead you straight into town. You will blend right in with the villagers. It will be difficult for my father to find you there.\" \"You're not coming?\" Yzma asked. \"Alas I cannot. My place is here. But don't fret. We will see each other again.\" \"You promise?\" \"I promise. Sisterhood is forever.\" \"Forever\" Yzma agreed. \"Now go! I doubt our absence will go unnoticed much longer. Goodbye Yzma. I look foreword to seeing you again.\" Without another word, Yzma ran out into the dark unknown. ","Summary":" Once upon a time an empire flourished in the South American jungle, undisturbed.

Just a few disclaimers and sidenotes before we get to the good stuff. 1) This fic does not account for any events from Kronk's New Groove or the spin—off television series, The Emperor's New School. Everything aside from headcanons are pulled from the original feature film. 2) Not a lot of action in this fic, if that's your cup of tea. It focuses more on character dynamics and development. My apologies if that's not what you're into! 3) Annnd the usual. I do not own the characters, I do not own the Disney franchise. Also, my writing may be a bit rusty—it's been a while since I've typed up anything that hasn't been an essay on comparing and contrasting rhetorical devices in classical literature. Thanks for reading nevertheless! I think we're good now, here we go :) Long ago, somewhere deep in the jungle... ...there was nothing much to look at. A squirrel, maybe. A chimp. A few bugs. This particular story takes place in a palace, and it begins with a young boy by the name of Yaku. Yaku was sitting in his royal bedroom, fiercely clutching his pillow, trying to regain composure. Today had been a particularly humiliating day for him. He needed someone, something, to blame. He whipped his head around to glare at the crown on his nightstand, as if it was the royal headdress's fault that he broke down crying in front of the royal council, in front of his future subjects, in front of Killa, his most favorite person in the whole wide world. ...Well, technically, it was the crown's fault. He clutched the pillow tighter, but it didn't give him any sense of comfort whatsoever. After a moment of hesitation, he checked to see if anyone had entered his room without him noticing. The coast seemed clear, so he quickly discarded his pillow and grabbed his stuffed manatee, Peppy, out from under his bed. He buried his face into the soft gray animal. He might have looked stupid. He might have looked childish. Everything an emperor shouldn't be. But he didn't care. The faded grey fabric smelled faintly of mint and chilies, just the right balance to calm him yet keep him awake. More importantly, he could hold onto it. It was tangible, it was there. Yaku sat there on his bed, his face smothered in stuffed manatee until he heard the unmistakable creak of his bedroom door opening. He looked up and saw the tall, graceful figure of Killa enter his room, still clad in the green robes she had worn that morning, worry lines etched around her dark brown eyes. \"Hey, Yaku, you oka—oh,\" she said, glancing down at the pathetic sight of the young boy and his manatee. She bit her lip. \"Okay, if you need to have Peppy out, then I know something's wrong.\" \"Shut up,\" squeaked Yaku. Killa raised an eyebrow. \"Excuse me? That is no way to talk to your advisor—to—be.\" \"Ugh, don't remind me.\" Killa made her way toward Yaku's bed and took a seat, putting a hand around his shoulder. They sat in a comfortable silence as the woman decided how to figure out what Yaku's problem was. Killa was always good at that. \"Do you...want to be emperor?\" she started off. \"Well—yes! Of course, but—I mean no! I—I mean—I don't know—! Rrrghhh!\" Yaku buried his face into Peppy once again. The two of them sat together in silence while Yaku recalled what had happened. His coronation was in two days, and as expected, the royal staff was causing quite a commotion in the palace. There were so many things to do. The little boy had never been so busy in his entire eleven years of life. His whole life, his whole sense of security...it had all come down with a crash when his parents had been proclaimed dead. They just had to decide to get themselves drowned by attacking some enemies overseas. Sure, they might have saved the whole empire, but it had cost them their lives. Now Yaku was the one with the crown, and that in itself wasn't that bad...in fact, Yaku had always wanted to be emperor. Just...not like this. Not in this way. He thought his parents would be there, with him, while he received the crown that was rightfully his, but now that would never happen. Yaku was scared. Confused. Frustrated. But most of all, he was angry. Jealous. Angry that mom and dad had to leave him like this. Jealous that everyone else—the royal record keeper, the emperor's advisor, even the maids and butler—because they all knew where they belonged. They all knew what they did why they did what they did. They all had—Yaku did his best to ignore the pressure building up behind his eyes as he thought this—they all had family. He didn't know his parents much anyways though, why did he want a family all of a sudden? Stupid parents had never paid attention to him anyways... And so at the council meeting that took place earlier that day, Yaku's emotions got the best of him. It had all been one big, embarrassing string of events. The head of the council was announcing the duties of being emperor when Yaku decided to have an emotional breakdown, abruptly bursting into tears in front of the entirety of the council. The small boy and the tall woman both sat on the end in silence until Yaku got out of his manatee decided to speak up. He just needed to get some of the pain he was feeling out of him, and what better choice than Killa, the woman who practically raised him? \"I...I guess it just—the coronation, well...it just makes everything seem so real.\" Killa stared at him, digesting the information he just gave her. \"Real. You mean...\" she looked down at the floor. \"Emperor Kanan and Empress Tulpa...?\" Yaku could feel his eyes sting. He didn't respond. Killa opened her mouth to say something, but Yaku cut her short, as all of the feelings bubbling inside of him— his anger, his confusion, his sorrow— took over his little body. \"Why did they have to leave me here?! Why did they have to go on some stupid sea trip and drown?! And now I don't have a family and I don't belong anywhere and the coronation's in two days and I have to rule the entire empire and I'm only eleven!\" he cried, heaving his chest. \"I can't do this!\" He clutched Peppy the manatee so hard he was afraid he might make the toy's seams pop. Silence once more. \"It's all their fault,\" he muttered bitterly to no one in particular. Killa sighed. \"Yaku. Don't say that. They were good people. Great leaders. And...Yaku, I know you're feeling upset, but don't say things like that, okay? You do have a family. You do belong.\" \"What are you talking about?! I never even knew my parents! They were always too busy. The empire always came first,\" he said. He didn't even care if he sounded selfish. Perhaps the villagers and townspeople he spied on through the palace windows didn't have gold and servants and the extravagant lap of luxury, but they had something the prince didn't have. He was merely eleven and had much more to learn; but he was wise enough to know that the smile shared by a mother and son as they held hands and spoke of the dinner they'd make while shopping at the marketplace was something that could not be bought. \"And that's their loss,\" Killa said softly, \"to not take part in raising someone as wonderful as you.\" Soft, warm hands grasped Yaku's shoulders as he pondered. Perhaps Killa didn't give birth to him, but she may as well have. In a palace full of aloof servants who saw him godlike, she was the only one who nurtured him (and reprimanded him. And argued with him). \"Thanks,\" Yaku finally muttered. \"But it won't change the fact that I'll be a terrible emperor.\" Killa scoffed. \"Yaku, you are not going to be a terrible emperor. And just because you're not your parents doesn't mean that you aren't a good person. I know that you can be a great leader. You have it in you,\" she said, poking him in the stomach. Yaku giggled, arms covering his stomach to prevent a second attack. \"I...I guess,\" he said, finally smiling a little. Then he looked down at Peppy the manatee and frowned once more. \"I'm being really immature, though. Emperors don't need stuffed animals!\" \"Really?\" mused Killa. \"Because I have a story to tell you, and it has to do with your great—great—great—great grandfather.\" \"Well, what does that have to do with anything?\" She grinned. \"I know for a fact that he loved his Wompy.\" \"Woah, what?\" Yaku got up and stared at her in disbelief. \"He had a stuffed animal?\" \"Hm...well, I'm not so sure as to whether it was a animal, exactly. I think it was more of a doll. Its name was Wompy.\" Yaku snickered. \"Wompy? What kind of name is that?\" \"Oh, like Peppy is a normal name.\" \"Oh, whatever,\" the young boy said, shrugging. \"But...wow. Wompy.\" Yaku pondered in silence for a minute. \"Wait...great—great—great—great grandfather..? I know this—hold on! You taught me about my family tree a week ago! Great—great—great—great...hey! Wasn't that the one who turned into a llama?\" Killa smiled and nodded, her curly locks of dark hair bobbing up and down as she did so. \"Yep. Emperor Kuzco.\" \"Oh.\" Yaku's shoulders slumped in disappointment as he recognized the name. \"So that's your story? The llama one? You already told me about Kuzco!\" he said. \"Not everything about him, though.\" \"But I know the whole story! He was a brat, his advisor turned him into a llama, he teamed up with a peasant—your great—great—something—something grandfather, right? And then he changed back and he was a good guy after that. What else is there to know?\" \"A lot more, actually,\" Killa replied. \"Because believe it or not, Emperor Kuzco was a lot like you.\" Yaku considered this for a moment. \"...A lot like me—hey wait! Are you calling me a brat?\" Yaku puffed his tiny chest out indignantly. Killa giggled. \"No, silly. You see, Kuzco's parents—his 'real' parents, as you put it—\" she said, quoting the air, \"...Well, he didn't really know them either. In fact, he took the throne at eight!\" Yaku's eyes widened. \"Eight?!\" Killa nodded. \"Yep. And after the whole llama incident that happened ten years afterwards, Kuzco wasn't really sure about his family and where he belonged and who he was. So you see? Kuzco was like you...although he didn't have that great of an advisor. That woman practically raised him,\" she said, frowning. \"You think he would've turned out better, huh?\" \"Mmm.\" Yaku looked around his bedroom, suddenly very aware that it was the same one that his ancestor used about a hundred years ago. It was hard to believe that he, scared little emperor-to-be Yaku, had descended from the great, confident Kuzco. According to the royal records, Kuzco was a generous monarch, always sure of himself (Yaku even managed to get a glimpse at one of the poems written about him back when he was alive— something about how he was \"the sovereign lord of the nation\" and the \"hippest cat in creation.\" Personally, Yaku thought that would work better as a theme song than a poem. Weird). All of the stories about Emperor Kuzco made him seem like a hero. A leader. Well, except for the llama story. But even then, the story had a happy ending. The summer home had been built without destroying the village on the hill, the evil advisor got turned into a cat, the emperor was a nice guy now, and they all lived happily ever after. A perfect world. Perhaps he was a bit eccentric and oddly compatible with the peasants, but it was understandable considering how his life was saved by one in the first place. How in the world could Kuzco, of all people, be like Yaku? He wondered just what story Killa wanted to tell him. He looked up at her anxiously. \"So...you gonna tell me the story or what?\" \"Stories, actually. Sit tight, this is gonna take a while,\"she said, as Yaku proceeded to wrap himself in his blanket and get settled. Killa cleared her throat. \"Alright,\" she said, glancing to the side. \"Enough of boring you with exposition. You ready to hear about Kuzco?\" \"Uh-huh!\" Yaku leaned in a bit, ready to listen. \"Okay,\" Killa said. \"It all started up in the village on the hill...\" I've decided to post Chapter 1 alongside the prologue, as OCs are usually appealing only to a certain extent, especially when they're the ones who start a fic off. Plus, creating child characters can be quite difficult—it's hard getting that right balance between whiny and overly edgy and precocious. I'm not quite sure what little Yaku would measure on that scale. So I'm posting a double-feature now, but from now on it'll just be one chapter at a time. Thanks for reading! :)[Chapter 2] The Emperor was dead. That's what everyone had thought. And why wouldn't they? The guy had his own funeral and eulogy and everything! That being said, it had been rather awkward convincing the empire that their ruler had returned— their true ruler, that is. Not the old wrinkled hag that was scary beyond all reason. The Emperor's return was clumsy. Rushed. Not at all the graceful, confident entrance he had expected it to be. However, the memory was seared into his brain, whether he liked it or not. Moments after his human transformation, his Majesty, followed by his homely-looking peasant friend, had hastily made their way down from the massive, gilded face of the emperor's palace. Key word: hastily, not carefully. It wasn't a particularly pleasant journey. The emperor received enough tiny scratches to last a lifetime on the way. He wasn't sure about the peasant, though. If he was hurt, he sure wasn't showing it. The only expression on the older man's face was determination—and occasionally concern, which occurred whenever his smaller friend exclaimed in pain during the way down. And the cat? What became of the cat? The emperor wanted to push the wretched thing off the palace and let it fall to its death, but after some gentle admonition from the peasant about how he wouldn't be better than his assassin if he did so, he sighed and gave in. In the end, they gave the unconscious feline to her former assistant, Kronk, and set off. Once they both reached solid ground, they hurried toward the front doors of the palace, which was mysteriously devoid of guards. And so the doors burst open, the strange duo of a young, scrawny monarch and an older, hefty peasant quickly making their way to the royal council room. That was when the explanation started. The peasant ran in on the council, followed by the emperor, who was panting quite heavily. He had actually held up quite well so far, considering the boy had pretty much never lifted a finger in his entire life before the llama incident. But never before had the young ruler ever experienced so much physical activity in so little time. After his breath began to steady, he looked up at the bewildered council, all of whom were deeply in engrossed in his peasant friend's story of how the emperor was indeed alive. \"...and now he's human, and he's ready to rule the empire again,\" he heard the peasant say. He looked expectantly at the young emperor, everyone in the council following his lead. Were they expecting him to say something? What was he supposed to say? Uh, yeah? \"Uh—yeah,\" he said, and then proceeded to mentally kick himself. He was their emperor! He was a god! So why was his confidence, his cool demeanor that he had prized for so long, dwindling by the minute? Probably because he never imagined that a situation like this would ever happen. After all, who would? A few months ago, if anyone had told him that he would be turned into a llama by his secretly evil advisor and forced to team up with a simple peasant to regain the throne, he would have had them imprisoned, or perhaps thrown out a window, for their blatant lies. And yet here he was, standing in front of his council, probably looking like a compete idiot. He suddenly became very self—conscious about his appearance. His arms and legs were riddled with tiny scratches from the journey down the palace, his hair was most likely a mess, and he was wearing nothing but a oversized green poncho that the peasant had given him after he had turned human. His robes, his crown, his flashy jade earrings—they had all been taken from him after he was knocked unconscious and crudely stuffed into a bag, llama form. All of the symbols that defined him as royalty were gone. Hell, even his spoiled attitude that had defined him as him was gone! Why did that stupid peasant have to come into the picture and change up everything (hmm, maybe he did retain a bit of his former self)? But then again, he'd probably be long dead if the peasant wasn't in the picture. The rest of that day was a blur. All he could remember was that his former advisor lost her shortly-lived right to rule, he got it back, and the entirety of the palace now knew that the emperor wasn't dead. The contrary, actually. Emperor Kuzco was very much alive. He lay on his back, floating on top of cool water, eyes closed, body facing the starry sky above him as he replayed the events that had happened in his life so far after his adventure as a llama, which wasn't much. It had barely been a month since the whole fiasco, and not even a week since he'd built his summer home. And now here he was, floating atop his summer pool, complete with a built in waterslide. Oh, yeah. But still...something bothered him. It was something insignificant, but it nagged him in the back of his mind, demanding for attention to be brought upon it. Back when he and Pacha had entered the palace to claim that Kuzco was alive...why weren't there any guards at the front doors? Was Yzma so careless that she thought she didn't need any guards? ...Wait. It suddenly dawned on Kuzco. The guards were probably part of the party of guards that Yzma had ordered to kill llama Kuzco. And what had happened to those guards? They fell to their deaths while Yzma did nothing but growl in frustration. Kuzco shivered a bit at the thought. Yzma was so heartless, so merciless, that she'd carelessly sacrifice human lives to get what she wanted. Gods, who would even do that? Me, Kuzco realized with a start. He didn't care that he'd be destroying a whole village to build Kuzcotopia. He didn't care that he might have left people homeless in the process. Pawns. Maybe he wasn't killing them outright, but he may as well have. Was he really no better than Yzma? No wonder Pacha hated him at first. Kuzco glared up at the stars. Ugh, a pity party was the last thing he needed. It just wasn't him. Not groovy. And yet that was what his mind had spent most of its time doing in the past month. The rest of his alone time wasn't any better either. When he wasn't wallowing in self—pity, all he could think about was— \"Kuzco?\" a large figure loomed over him, curiously glancing down at the emperor. Him. Pacha. The young boy was startled, and so he ended up sinking into the water, thrashing around and cursing for a few fleeting seconds, and then thrusting himself out and landing right next to the peasant in order to glare at him. \"Don't do that!\" he snapped, yanking his towel from a nearby branch and encasing his soaking wet body and swim trunks in it. \"Do what?\" the peasant demanded, staring at him. \"What are you even doing out here, anyways?\" \"Oh, uh. I was...reflecting.\" Kuzco glanced down at the water and realized what he had just said. \"No pun intended,\" he added hastily after a few seconds. Pacha cracked a smile. \"Mm—hmm.\" He sat down in the grass near the water, motioning for the young emperor to sit down with him. Kuzco obliged. \"And may I ask just what you were reflecting on?\" Kuzco suddenly became very interested in looking at his feet. \"Just...stuff.\" \"What kind of stuff?\" He made a pointed effort to stare intently at his toes, trying to sound casual and failing miserably at doing so. \"It's nothing, alright?\" \"Kuzco, there's something bothering you, I can tell—\" \"Nope, not telling—\" \"Kuzco—\" \"Lalalalala, not listening—!\" \"Kuzco!\" \"Ugh, alright...!\" Kuzco mumbled, his face beginning to burn. Gods, why did Pacha always have to ask him about every little detail? His servants back at the palace had never done that. They would just ask him what he wanted, do his request, and leave him be. They were complying, unquestioning, unbothered. Pacha was the complete opposite. Stubborn, nosy...concerned. And as much as Kuzco didn't want to admit it, he felt kind of touched by that. Pacha wasn't just another one of his servants, treating him as a god of sorts that required his every little need to be fed instantaneously. No, Pacha treated Kuzco like a human. He didn't like him (or pretend to) just because he was emperor. They fought, they yelled. But it was because he mattered to him. Kuzco liked that. It was something the boy had never experienced before. Maybe it came as a package with the whole friend gig. How was he to know? He'd never had a friend until now... Annnd there comes the self—pity again, he thought, gritting his teeth. \"Kuzco...if there's anything going on, don't be a stranger, alright? You can tell me,\" Pacha said, snapping Kuzco out of his thoughts. \"After all,\" he added, jovially slapping him on the back, \"That's what friends do.\" Kuzco made a big show of rubbing his back. There it was, that word again. Friends. It had never mattered to him until that peasant came marching into his life and changed it, for better or for worse. \"...Uh—huh. Right,\" Kuzco said. \"So, basically, I was thinking.\" \"I think we've already established that.\" \"I'm sorry, what did you say?\" \"Oh, nothing,\" Pacha said quickly, glancing sideways. Kuzco couldn't help but give his trademark smirk. \"Yeah, that's what I thought. So anyways,\" he said, his smile fading, \"I...\" He faltered. How was he supposed to get the words out? He didn't know how to. Everything in his mind was a huge mess. A huge, tangled up mess of thoughts and pictures. \"I guess I just...\" he tried again, but his tongue failed him. \"I don't...I'm...\" Come on, just say it! Say something! Anything, he urged himself. Stop looking like a total loser. \"I'm Yzma!\" he blurted out finally. Pacha stared at him, bewildered. \"What?\" Kuzco groaned and slapped himself on the forehead. That came out wrong. Really wrong. \"Th—that's not what I meant—!\" he said, desperately trying to correct himself. \"I mean, I just...\" he sighed. \"I was thinking...about how Yzma never cared about anyone and she would do anything to get her way—I guess that's why I never liked her that much,\" Kuzco said hurriedly trying to get the thought out of his head. Maybe now it wouldn't bother him so much—but then he began realizing in a whole new light why no one had cared that he was presumably dead (as Kronk so conveniently mentioned outside of Mudka's on that rainy afternoon. He'd never forget that day, try as he might). Pacha nudged him gently. \"Go on.\" \"...So, I was wondering, 'wow, who in the world could be as heartless as her to do anything, no matter what the cost, just for their own selfish motives?'And then I just kind of realized. Well...\" he trailed off, looking up at Pacha. He watched the gears turn in Pacha's head as he realized what he was saying. His eyes slowly widened. \"Oh.\" Really? Pacha tells him to spill his problems, and all he gets in return is a measly 'oh?' \"Gee, thanks for the support, Pacha, now all my problems are solved!\" Kuzco snapped as he stared downward. \"Kuzco...\" He looked down at his toes until he felt the warm, heavy weight of Pacha's arm wrap around his shoulder. He wanted to make a big deal of pushing the peasant's arm off because he didn't need his pity, but he decided against it. He didn't want to ruin this whole \"friend\" thing. He...well, he liked it. He liked having someone there for him, for once. Someone solidly, tangibly, reassuringly there. Someone who didn't ignore him until it was too late, someone who disappear on him when he needed them the most... \"You're a changed man now. You know that,\" Pacha said, his rugged yet warm voice bringing Kuzco back to reality. \"Doesn't mean that anyone's gonna believe I'm a changed man,\" Kuzco retorted. \"I've spent so many years creating this—this image for myself, and then boom. How's anyone gonna believe that I'm not the old Kuzco?\" \"...Who says,\" he whispered as he dug his nails into the dirt, \"that I won't become the old Kuzco in a few weeks' time?\" Pacha stared at Kuzco for a long time. Like, a really long time. Kuzco was just about to say that Pacha was kind of scaring him when the peasant came to an abrupt conclusion. \"You are the old Kuzco.\" Silence. Numbness. Kuzco felt a nasty sinking sensation in his chest. \"What?\" \"I said, you are the old Kuzco,\" Pacha repeated. \"But...\" He added, \"you're a new Kuzco too.\" Now it was Kuzco's turn to stare at Pacha. \"Okay, now you're making no sense.\" \"Yes, I am,\" the peasant insisted. \"Look, when I first met you, you seemed like a spoiled, selfish brat—\" Kuzco sniffed. \"Thanks.\" Pacha ignored his comment and continued. \"—but I knew that there was some good in you. You just had to tap it out. Granted, it took a lot of tapping and poking and prodding...a loooot—\" \"Get to the point.\" \"Well...you came through in the end. You saved my life twice, even though you knew you could've just walked away.\" Kuzco rolled his eyes. \"Oh, come on. Anyone would've done that. Nobody's that heartless.\" \"Exactly my point. You do have good in you.\" Pacha grinned. \"You just needed a little help getting it to the outside world instead of just keeping it caged up inside of yourself. And now it's slowly coming outside, bit by bit.\" \"Like...baby steps,\" Kuzco said. Pacha nodded. \"Mm—hmm. Baby steps. What I'm trying to say is, the world may not know how good of a person you are yet, but they will eventually. It may not feel like you're doing much, but it'll all be worth it in the end.\" Kuzco could feel the corners of his mouth twitch as the beginnings of a smile were creeping up on his face. \"I guess.\" And then they were interrupted by a voice. \"Pacha!\" he heard a woman call up from the peasant's hilltop. \"It's time to put the kids to bed!\" \"Coming, Chicha!\" Pacha responded, slowly getting up and nudging Kuzco's shoulder gently as he did so. \"Hey, if you ever need to talk about anything else, I'm there, alright? I'm usually up on that tuneless little hilltop,\" he said, chuckling. The smile that was forming took over Kuzco's face. \"Right,\" he said, getting up as well. \"Well, guess I'll head back to my hut too, then.\" \"Mm—hmm. Alright. See you then, Kuzco.\" The emperor said his goodbye, but he wasn't quite ready to take leave yet. \"Hey, Pacha.\" The peasant turned around. \"Yeah?\" \"You...you told me that it'll all be worth it in the end, but...\" Kuzco could feel his face turn hot as he blurted out the remaining words. \"Was it all worth it for you in the end?\" Pacha seemed confused at first as to what Kuzco was talking about, but then his face slowly broke into a smile. \"You bet it was.\" Kuzco looked up at Pacha's warm, inviting smile. He saw his encouraging eyes, crinkled at the corners, and for a moment, he forgot of being emperor. He was a simple peasant boy, enjoying the gentle, balmy night with his... He cursed inwardly. Was he really about to think Pacha was his father? What was wrong with him? He was feeling too many things too quickly. Great. Just when he was beginning to feel happy again, something had to push him back down. Stupid brain. Nevertheless, he smiled at Pacha. \"Well, goodnight, I guess.\" \"Goodnight!\" the peasant called back to him as he walked up that tuneless little hilltop up to his house. Kuzco knew he should be getting back home, but he allowed himself to stand there near the pool for a moment, looking up at Pacha's hilltop. He saw the figure of a woman, no doubt Pacha's wife. Then he saw two smaller figures. Children, he assumed. They ran up toward their dad as he made his way home, and the three of them collapsed into a bear hug led by Pacha. Pacha and the children then made their way to the woman (what had Pacha called her? Chicha?), and then they appeared to stand there, talking for a few moments while the children seemed to be trying to get Pacha's attention. Then Pacha knelt down, heard something one of the children said, and then they all started laughing as they went inside. The door closed and they didn't come back out. \"Alright, show's over,\" Kuzco muttered to himself as he walked back to his summer house. And yet he couldn't help but wonder what it was like. What was it like to be out working the whole day, tending to crops and smelly livestock, drenched in sweat and smeared with dirt? The peasant life didn't seem particularly rewarding. So what was up with Pacha and Chicha and their army of midgets? Why were they so happy? Family. The word sounded so strange to him. And he couldn't just shake it off, either. Pacha wasn't just his friend, he was also a father. And father was just as strange of a word to Kuzco. His father would always be that jerk who pushed him away until the very end. And his mother would never be Chicha. He didn't even know Chicha and yet he still knew she'd be a better mother. His mother would be the other person who always pushed him away, the one who died right when her son needed him the most. That would be their legacy. In Kuzco's book, at least. Kuzco narrowed his eyes, and his mind quickly ran through every curse known to man. He didn't like thinking about his parents. He didn't like talking about his parents. At least, he thought that he wouldn't like talking about his parents. No one had ever bothered to ask him about it. Or maybe they did and he was too self—conceited to notice...so great, it was his fault now. Whatever. It wasn't like he ever asked for a family. He was an emperor. A god on Earth. And why would a god need a family? But...he couldn't help but wonder what it was like to live up on that hilltop. Feeling like he belonged somewhere, now that the palace would never again be the same for him. Kuzco reached his hut, closed the front door, and lit a candle. He was going to be up for a while. He changed into his pajamas and then lay down on his bed in exhaustion, letting out a melodramatic groan. Who knew that having fun in pools and getting pep talks from Pacha could be so tiring? After a moment or two, Kuzco got back up, realizing that he forgot something. He opened one of the drawers on his nightstand and grabbed his Wompy by the arm, smiling at it. He closed the drawer, and for a fleeting moment, he was glad that he wasn't living with Pacha. Seriously, if the man found out that he slept with a stuffed purple doll, he'd never let Kuzco hear the end of it. But just as quickly as that moment of relief came, it vanished. He saw Pacha's house. He saw Pacha's family, doing family things...whatever...families did. Ugh, he didn't even know what they were doing! So why did he want to do it so badly? Sure, he had heard the word family before, but he never really stopped to consider what it was. For half of his childhood, he never even acknowledged that he was part of a family, or that he even had parents. That was because his parents never noticed him, too busy carrying out royal duties and managing the empire. And so he never knew what family was, and he'd never really seen it, so it never really bothered him, since it never really concerned him. And if it didn't concern him, it didn't matter. But then, of course, he just had to see Pacha's family, get an abstract idea of what family was, and let it bother him now. The universe just seemed to love hating him. In a way, the concept of family was kind of like the concept of friends. They were terms that were in his database of words, but not in his everyday vocabulary. They were concepts that were far away to him; almost exotic, in a way. The only difference was that he had a friend now. He didn't have a family. Those stupid peasants had to introduce what he now knew he'd never have to him. Sure, Pacha could be nice and fatherly to him. He could even want to have Kuzco as a son the same way Kuzco wanted a dad like Pacha. But he knew that he'd have to go back to the palace eventually. He couldn't just stay in this village forever. And that was why he'd never truly belong here. And there were probably a million other Pachas out there; being caring and considerate just seemed to be a tenet of peasant life. Pacha was just as nice to everyone else as he was to Kuzco. After eighteen years in a life of lavish disillusionment, it was pretty hard for the emperor to take in the fact that he was not as special as he once thought he was. Not a god. Not a peasant. Who was... Kuzco? It made his head hurt just to think about it. \"Alright Kuzco,\" he told himself. \"That's enough deep thinking for today. Let's sleep on it now.\" And with that, he blew out his candle, pulled up the covers, and closed his eyes, not sure exactly what to make of his funny peasant friend and that tuneless little hilltop he lived on. Well! Perhaps a little too angsty given the source material? That was quite fun for me, though, I really liked writing interactions between Pacha and Kuzco. :) Love me some character dynamics. But now I'm off to write a huge lab report for chemistry. Updates may be erratic, but stay tuned! I refuse to give into the dead fic culture.[Chapter 3] Hello again! Thanksgiving update, whoo! I am so in that holiday mood, I'm literally scarfing down a slice of apple pie while proofreading this. Anyways, yes, this chapter is pretty long. I don't think I will write a chapter as long as this afterwards, though. Most of it is of Kuzco establishing character dynamics with the rest of Pacha's family. Fun! I feel like this particular chapter isn't my absolute best work though...I hope you guys can brave it through this one, because I feel like the next chapter is actually coming along quite well! Kuzco woke up the next morning to the sunlight gently streaming into his hut through an open window. Normally, he would have slept in for a while, all his curtains drawn, doors closed, snuggled in his big bed with Wompy. But that was back at the palace. Things worked a little differently here at the village—not necessarily a bad kind of different, though. Just different. He rubbed his eyes, stretched a little, and then gently placed Wompy on his nightstand. He ambled into his bathroom. While brushing his teeth, he wondered what he would do for the day. After all, it was his last day here at the village. Of course he could come back again whenever he wished, but tomorrow he had to head back to the palace and, well...catch up on emperor stuff. Dedicating buildings. Talking to the royal council. Stuff like that. The least he could do was make his last day memorable. But he couldn't just sit in the pool all day. His beautiful face would get all shriveled! And plus, it was a public pool, open to all of the peasants as well as him. Who knew what surprises were in there, waiting to be found. Kuzco shuddered. Ugh, great. Now he was going to think twice before setting foot in that pool again. The pool was out of the question. What about just staying indoors for the entire day, keeping to himself? Yeah. Kuzco time with Kuzco, starring Kuzco. That has a nice ring to it, he thought as he slipped into a poncho. But...no. He shook his head. He'd already had enough alone time back at the palace. Plus, who said he'd truly be alone? His stupid brain would keep bothering him, feeding him negative thoughts. He wanted to do something...different. He wanted to do something...with someone. His thoughts drifted to the house on the hilltop. Yeah, that sounded good. He'd go do stuff with Pacha. And maybe the rest of his family, too. He'd get to know them, and then he'd have more friends to do stuff with, so it wouldn't look like he was specifically dependent on Pacha. He'd ask good ol' Pacha to introduce him, and then— Woah, woah, woah, hold it! said the obnoxious voice in his head, interrupting him. What are you trying to do, adopt yourself into their family? At this point, Kuzco felt like punching the voice in his head right in its nonexistent face, but he thought better of it. It would just give him an unwanted headache, so instead he just satisfied himself by muttering \"stupid brain.\" ...Wait. Did he just talk to himself? He had just stooped the loneliest level of lonely. How pathetic. That settled it. He was going to march right up to Pacha's house and demand that he introduce him to his family. Emperor's orders. And then they'd do stuff. He didn't know what stuff, exactly, but he would work out the details along the way. Besides, just because I can't do family stuff with them doesn't mean I can't do neighbory stuff with them, he thought. And with that thought fueling his confidence, the young emperor pushed open the door in front of him and exited the bathroom, ready to start the day. And then he spotted two kids sitting on his bed. There were things Kuzco wanted to say. A lot of things Kuzco wanted to say. But the first words that came out of his mouth were: \"I thought I locked the door.\" \"You did,\" one of the kids on the bed said. She was a small girl with pigtails who sported a pair of crooked buckteeth. \"But I picked the lock!\" she continued brightly, producing a bent hairpin out of seemingly nowhere. Kuzco stared at her in disbelief. That was a royal lock, presumably made by one of the best metalsmiths in the empire. \"Wha...how?\" \"Oh, it was easy,\" the girl said, waving her hand nonchalantly. \"First, I took my hairpin out, and then I bent it half. After that, I stuck it up the lock and felt for the latch and—\" \"Uh-huh, that's nice,\" Kuzco interrupted, unceremoniously ending the explanation. \"So...why are you here? Aren't you aware that this is the emperor's summer home? No crossy without permission.\" \"But it's an emergency!\" the other kid exclaimed, jumping off the bed. This one appeared to be a boy, his hair tied up at the top of his head, resembling a small black fountain. He flailed his chubby arms in the air as he tried to make his point. \"...Right. An emergency,\" said Kuzco, quoting the air. \"And what exactly would this emergency be?\" \"We found a rat under our bed!\" the girl piped up, looking at him expectantly. Kuzco frowned. \"And what? I look like an exterminator to you?\" \"Well...\" The girl frowned as well. \"No,\" she admitted finally. \"Then go ask your parents or something. Go on,\" said the emperor, waving them off. \"Shoo. Vamoose.\" \"But we can't ask our parents,\" said the boy insistently. \"Mom's too busy making lunch and looking after Yupi, and—\" The emperor's brows furrowed in confusion at the unknown name. \"Yupi?\" The girl nodded. \"Yeah, he's our baby brother. Oh— I'm Chaca and that's Tipo, by the way,\" she added, pointing to the small boy with the fountain—hair. \"So anyways, Mom's too busy, and Dad's out at the marketplace trading for stuff, so he told us to go get you if we needed help with anything, and—\" she paused for a moment, looking Kuzco up and down. \"You are Emperor Kuzco, right?\" Kuzco huffed. \"Of course I am. And...\" his eyes narrowed in suspicion. \"Who exactly is this dad of yours who told you to come see me?\" \"Pacha,\" the kids responded in unison. \"Figures,\" he muttered. So Pacha was out at the marketplace. That was at the center of the empire, near the palace. The man must have left at dawn if he was at the marketplace now. He probably wouldn't be back until evening. There went Kuzco's plans for the day. And now he had to play babysitter too. He crossed his arms. Thanks, Pach. But wait...these were Pacha's kids, right? So I'm gonna have to go over to their house, he thought. And then I can be all neighbory...and stuff. Although it's gonna be kind of awkward making introductions without Pacha being there...ah, whatever. I'm freaking Kuzco! I can pull this off with my charm and good looks. Heh. \"Alright, fine, I'll check this rat thing out...I guess,\" he replied as Chaca and Tipo hopped off the bed and followed him outside. \"You know, you don't look like an emperor,\" Chaca said as she eyed Kuzco on the walk up the hill. He eyed her back. \"And what were you expecting?\" \"Hmm...\" she said, seriously contemplating this. \"Someone more buff,\" she decided. \"And good—looking.\" He gritted his teeth as he tuned her out. He hadn't even been with this kid for ten minutes and she was already getting on his nerves. The little brat thought she had the right to insult her emperor, her supreme— \"No!\" he shouted suddenly. Chaca stopped listing various ideal attributes and raised an eyebrow at Kuzco. \"What?\" He had to channel that Yzma out of him. He couldn't go revert to his old self, Pacha believed in him...and as much as he hated to admit it, Kuzco cared what Pacha thought of him. Gods, why did life always become so harder when other people were thrown into the mix? Couldn't he just be happy being a loner? And yet he couldn't stop thinking of last night and that hilltop full of life that he once thought was so tuneless... Kuzco took a deep breath. Okay. Humor them. \"Uh—well, I bet you've never seen an emperor in person then.\" \"Fair enough,\" Chaca replied. \"I mean, I expected you to be older, too. How old are you anyways?\" \"Eighteen,\" he said coolly. \"And my blood type is A negative, and my sandal size is seven.\" Chaca gawked at him. \"I didn't ask for any—\" \"I know. Just figured I'd answer before you inevitably did.\" Tipo broke into a giggle fit until Chaca gently elbowed his chest. \"Not funny,\" she grumbled. \"You're weird,\" Tipo said, snorting. Kuzco rolled his eyes. \"Shut up.\" \"It's a good kind of weird, though,\" Chaca interjected as Tipo nodded. \"That would have been kind of funny, actually, if it wasn't directed at me.\" \"Huh. Well, thanks...I guess,\" said the emperor, as the three of them continued to walk up the hill. As they neared the house, Kuzco examined it. It seemed to be a bit smaller than he remembered it to be. Definitely going for that small yet cozy vibe, he thought. He turned to the children. \"So, where's this rat you two were talking about earlier?\" \"Oh! It's in our bedroom,\" Chaca replied as Tipo grabbed Kuzco by the arm and pulled him into Pacha's hut, followed by the protest of \"no touchy!\", courtesy of the emperor. Kuzco staggered inside, taking in the surroundings of the hut. The place was open and inviting, much more roomier than anyone would have thought it might have been from the outside. A few feet in front of him, there stood a sink with a few dishes stacked on a drying rack right next to it. To his right, he saw an entrance to another room, steam hissing out of it. He could hear something boiling and bubbling. Probably the kitchen. Chicha must have been in there, making lunch. And to his left, he saw a staircase that the kids were beckoning him toward. \"Hey, hey, alright,\" said Kuzco as Chaca and Tipo yanked his arms in an effort to get him up the stairs. Instead, they ended up making him trip over the first step and fall face first. He yelped in pain, naturally. \"Kids!\" he heard a concerned voice emanate from the kitchen. \"Is everything alright?\" \"Yeah, Mom!\" Tipo called back. \"We just invited a friend over! We're going upstairs, okay?\" \"Okay!\" the voice called back. It also said something else, but Kuzco couldn't comprehend the rest because, in truth, he was a bit shocked. Friend. Tipo had called him friend. He saw the kids go upstairs and smiled to himself. Huh. Maybe I do have this whole neighbor thing down pat, he thought to himself as he followed them up the stairs. Kuzco walked into the bedroom, taking care not to step on the various toys strewn across the floor. \"Okay,\" said Chaca, clearly meaning business. She pointed to underneath what appeared to be the bottom bunk of a bunk bed. \"The rat's under there.\" Kuzco grimaced. Right. The rat. That's why he was here. And now he had to get a dirty, smelly rat that probably carried some sort of disgusting disease out from under a bed. Why him? Because neighbors, he thought. Because neighbors. Because you don't want to spend the rest of your life talking to a stupid voice inside your brain. He swallowed down whatever disgust he had plastered a grin onto his face, rubbing his hands together and walking toward the bunk bed. \"Alright, kiddos, move along. 'Cause Emperor Kuzco has got this down, baby!\" Kuzco knelt down, squinting to see what was under the bed. \"So, why don't you guys wanna touch this thing?\" Kuzco asked. \"Well, 'cause it's a rat,\" he heard Chaca say. \"Uh-huh. And you have no problem with me touching it.\" \"...Oh. Uh. Well...\" he heard her say hesitantly. To his surprise, Kuzco found himself laughing rather than being angered. \"Hey, it's cool. I probably would have done the same thing. And besides, maybe we can get this thing out without touching it. That is,\" he said, frowning as he peered into the darkness, \"if I can find the freaking thing.\" He got out from under the bed and looked at the kids. \"Get me a stick or something.\" Tipo was the first to oblige, grabbing a twig and handing it to Kuzco. \"Thanks, I...wait, why do you have twigs in your room?\" Chaca stuck her tongue out. \"Junior Chipmunk stuff. Tipo always comes home with sticks and bugs in his hair.\" \"Hey! I'm trying to get my forager badge.\" \"Please, Tipo. That's such a boring one. Everyone knows the fishing badge is the best.\" \"Fishing's boring.\" \"Is not!\" \"Is too!\" They continued what seemed to be a never-ending battle consisting of only those two phrases as Kuzco took hold of the branch and stuck his neck back into the darkness, slowly feeling his way around with his newfound tool. he poked and prodded, trying to feel if there was anything undeneath. Just when he was about to give up, he felt the tip of branch touch something soft, and a startled squeak was heard soon afterwards. Aha. Jackpot. \"Alright,\" said the emperor. \"Enough fun and games, little guy. Time to come out.\" In one swift movement, he gently shoved the stick into the rat's stomach and got back out, his stick now housing a small, furry, and quite frightened rodent perched on top of it. The kids stopped arguing as suddenly as they had started and applauded. Kuzco beamed, mentally applauding himself as well until the children ceased clapping and he felt something furry tickle his neck and shoulders. The rat. The young man jumped up and proceeded to shriek, \"gedditoffgedditoffgedditoffgedditoff!\", but then it seemed as if the rat decided that it had had enough fun distressing him. It fell down into Kuzco's lap with a plop as he sat down on the bottom of the bunk bed trying to calm himself down. His face was burning as Chaca and Tipo howled with laughter. He glared down at the rat. \"It's all your fault,\" he muttered, then stopped talking as he realized something. \"What the—this isn't a rat. Look at its ears, they're huge.\" The \"rat's\" pink nose quivered and it buried its face into Kuzco's palms, as if it were suddenly self-conscious of its ear size. \"Woah, Kuzco's right,\" Chaca noted, kneeling down next to the bed. \"Its tail isn't all gross and pink and naked, it's fluffy.\" Kuzco stared down at the creature, meeting its huge, black eyes as it squeaked and pawed at his palms. \"It's a chinchilla,\" he told the kids, grinning. \"Man, I haven't seen one of these in ages.\" The rodent squeaked and bobbed its head as if in agreement and hopped onto Kuzco's shoulder. \"Ooh,\" the children exclaimed in unison, looking just about ready to worship the furry creature. \"Looks like it likes you,\" Tipo said. Kuzco laughed. \"Who wouldn't? Er—just kidding,\" he added sheepishly. He could almost feel Pacha's presence in the room, shaking his head in disapproval. \"Um...you wanna hold it?\" he offered. \"Yesyesyes!\" Four small, eager hands stretched out into Kuzco's face. Kuzco scooped up the chinchilla from its perching spot and placed it in Chaca's hands, despite Tipo's protests (\"Sorry, buddy, the thing's pretty much half your size. You'd probably get smothered or something\"). Nevertheless, both children were starry-eyed as they stroked the chinchilla, who seemed to be enjoying basking in all the newfound attention. The three sat there, first in an uncomfortable silence, which gave way into small talk, eventually winding up into conversational territory when Chaca asked about Kuzco's adventures as a llama. It always came back to that, but it really helped with kickstarting conversations. And Kuzco obliged, not leaving out a single detail. \"Woah, so not only did the bridge break, there were scorpions too?\" Chaca asked. \"And bats!\" interjected Kuzco. He shuddered as he thought of how they all flew into his mouth for a fleeting moment. \"Don't forget the bats.\" \"And the waterfall!\" Tipo threw up his hands in triumph as he turned to Chaca. \"See, told you my dream about dad was true.\" She rolled her eyes. \"Well, I still wouldn't call it a 'raging river of death.' \" \"Well, at least mine actually makes sense! Why would Dad ever have to kiss a llama?\" The two were interrupted by a very loud cough from a very red-faced Kuzco. \"...Yeah, totally agree.\" He didn't know when, exactly, but the conversation eventually turned away from himself. Tipo excitedly spoke of the harvesting festivals; warm plates and bowls heaped with dishes of potatoes and corn and fish seasoned with chilis, giant bells and flutes delivering bold melodies the kids stamped and danced together to as they played games and cracked jokes, everyone's worries forgotten in the midst of celebration. Chaca, a bit more aware that Kuzco wasn't quite accustomed to a peasants' life, spoke of the smaller, more mundane rituals, yet in a way that made even washing the clothes seem memorable. Bright hues of pink and green and yellow and blue swirling around in their huge, wooden washing basin, Chaca and Tipo scrubbing the clothes clean while Pacha and Chicha smoothed out the creased, soaking fabric and hung them up to dry on an aged, wooden bar where the clothes would be baked by the sun, nature's oven. But the task was never truly done until the kids splashed around in the suds, splashing water into one another's faces with little Yupi sitting in the middle, squealing in laughter as some of the water hit him as well, a cool relief in the sweltering Peruvian summer. Kuzco never considered how his clothes were washed. In all honesty, he didn't even know if his clothes were washed; he may have been wearing brand-new robes every single day, for all he knew. Sovereigns could not afford to have even a speck on their robes, it was an insult to their noble stature, a deviation from godliness. And so he just was not able to explain, for the life of him, why he wanted to see those red robes be swirled around in the basin and set to rest on a rickety wooden bar. But he supposed some things were beyond explaining: things such as the oddly compatible trio of an excitable young boy, a precocious young girl, and a confused yet eager monarch talking away the hours. The chinchilla seemed eager as well, bounding between each of the three pairs of hands as they spoke. They eventually made their way up to the top bunk. They lay down and and gazed at the ceiling, the silence between them now a comfortable one. Kuzco closed his eyes, trying to regain his breath—not from tiring his body out physically, but from talking so much. Never in his life had he talked that much in so little time. Back at the palace, things got done with a snap of his finger, maybe a few short \"yeses\" and \"nos,\" but barely anything beyond that. In fact, the only person he'd ever talked to as much as he'd just talked now was Pacha, probably. Over the span of...two days? Three? It was jarring how short of a time it was, and yet how so many things still happened. Eighteen years of a set way of life, turned upside-down in less than even a week's time... His eyes snapped open as he heard a voice shout. \"Kids! Lunch!\" Chaca and Tipo hopped off the bed as the door creaked open, leaving Kuzco with the chinchilla perched on his shoulder, just as confused as he was. A fairly tall woman peered in, her eyes scanning the room until her gaze met Kuzco's up at the top bunk. Unsure what to do, he quickly averted it. His flawless memory reminded him that Chicha could pack quite a punch; he wasn't ready to feel a faceful of frying pan again just yet. \"What, too high-and-mighty to look me in the eye?\" Kuzco froze, then slowly, slowly lifted his head up to meet Chicha's gaze once more. One of her strong, dark brows was raised, large copper earrings and bouncy black curls framing the expectant expression on her face. Her arms were crossed, yellow robes swaying gently in the breeze from the room's single window. \"Kuzco, right?\" \"Yeeeahh,\" he said, stretching his reply out as long as possible while he searched his brain for something else to say. Nothing came. She bent down and looked at the kids. \"I know you said you invited a friend over, but I didn't know that meant the person who almost destroyed our entire village.\" Her arms were now akimbo as heat crept up the boy's cheeks. Sure, she had a right to be upset with him, but that didn't mean he had to like it. And it certainly didn't help with the whole neighbor thing. \"Uh...sorry?\" he offered weakly, palms spread out in front of him. She pursed her lips. \"Mhm.\" Was that approval? Acceptance of his apology? He had never used that word before, it tasted strange and foreign on his tongue. And yet when she was about to walk away with the kids, he knew he had to use it again—for his sake, at least. Winning the kids over was easy with his natural charisma and charming demeanor (which he seemed to be strangely lacking at the moment), but gaining the approval of this Mama Jaguar would be a challenge. \"Wait,\" he called out, in a tone squeakier and more unbecoming than he expected. He flinched at it, but Chicha turned around nevertheless. \"Um...sorry,\" he began again, feeling the strange word snaking its way out of his mouth. \"Just learning how to use that word isn't going to cut it,\" said Chicha. And how true that was. He knew he should say more, but what? Or should he not think about it at all? Maybe that was it. Just don't think about how to start it off, just let it all out. \"I could have cared less about getting rid of this village,\" he blurted out quickly. \"It was just taking up space that could have been mine.\" Ugh, just speak without thinking? Thanks brain, worst idea ever. Chicha looked confused and a bit disgusted as Kuzco groaned inwardly. He was not off to a good start. \"But...\" he swallowed down his pride. \"I was wrong.\" Chicha's expression softened a little. Okay, maybe now he was getting somewhere. \"I never knew about the people up here. Since it wasn't important to me, it wasn't important to anyone, and maybe if i did actually do it you would have been dead, but I wouldn't know you so I wouldn't care but now I do know you, I know you and I know Pacha and maybe that shouldn't make any difference, but I know it does, but there's still one thing I don't know, its how even when your floors are literally dirt and clothes have tears in them and you're soaked in sweat and smell all day, you're happy with it!\" He yelled, then closed his eyes and tried to catch his breath. Silence. When he opened his eyes again, Chicha was now fully turned to face him. Tipo and Chaca peered out from behind, clutching onto their Mama Jaguar's yellow robes. And...\" Kuzco sighed. \"Maybe I'll never understand that. Maybe I'll never totally get why you're so happy or how you're so happy. But I'll admit, I, uh...I can appreciate it. And I don't want to destroy that. So...\" he cleared his throat. \"That's why I'm sorry.\" Chicha still appeared confused, her brows still furrowed and her expression still sour. Perhaps some battles just couldn't be won. Kuzco was just about to say he'd take leave when she decided to speak. \"You don't sound like the man Pacha was telling me about after his visit to the palace.\" Ugh, it was always this. Changed man, changed man. Okay, maybe he had changed. But did it always have to be pointed out? You can't say you've changed without pointing out how you were once an idiot in the process...and that just wasn't groovy. \"Well, believe it or not, it's me,\" Kuzco said. \"And I feel like I've said my part the best I could, so...nice seeing you, I guess.\" He made his way to the door when Chicha unceremoniously blocked him. He gulped, wondering what he had did wrong now. \"Rule number one of a Chicha household: you can't leave until you have at least one meal here.\" The young man was taken aback. He had expected to feel the brunt of Chicha's fury, but instead she was offering him lunch. People were so complicated... \"And don't complain about how it's not the fancy whatever-it-is you eat back at your palace. My house, my rules. By the way, what's that thing on your shoulder?\" \"Oh, that's Silvie,\" Chaca said nonchalantly before Kuzco could even open his mouth. \"Short for silver.\" \"What? No, that's Puma.\" \"Puma?\" Chaca snorted. \"It's a chinchilla.\" \"Well, who said that you could get to name it?\" Tipo stuck his tongue out. \"Well, I come up with better names than you anyways!\" Chaca crossed her arms and followed her brother as he walked out of the room. \"Do not!\" \"Do too!\" A chorus of do-not-do-toos echoed down the stairs as Chicha leaned against the doorframe and sighed, giving Kuzco a tired yet knowing smile, as if saying, you know how kids are. But didn't know how kids were, so he just gave a stiff, awkward smile as the two headed down the stairs to lunch. \"And there were scorpions too?\" Chicha asked incredulously, eyes wide. \"And don't forget the bats!\" Tipo chimed in. \"Wow.\" Chicha crossed her arms and considered this. \"My husband risked his life to save you. You better be grateful.\" Kuzco crossed his legs on the bench in the living room. \"Oh, believe me, I am.\" A smile tugged on the corners of Chicha's mouth. \"I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.\" Kuzco smiled back. \"Yeah?\" Chicha's smile was more genuine now, reaching her dark brown eyes. The whole atmosphere of the room began to lighten as Mama Jaguar began to shed off the cold exterior she had greeted the emperor with. \"You know, you don't even seem like an emperor right now.\" He couldn't argue with that. He wasn't reclining in his golden throne and woolen robes, ordering servants around in the heart of the empire. Instead, he sat on a crude, wooden bench on the outskirts of the capital, in a plain red poncho, a sleeping chinchilla nestled between his hands. He'd had a peasant lunch for the first time in his life: fish stew and corn cakes. No roast duck, no spinach puffs, no spiced cocoa. But...lunch wasn't bad. Just different. \"Hey! You in there?\" A hand waved in front of his face. He snapped to attention, looking up at Chicha. \"I called your name four times.\" \"Ah,\" he said dumbly, wondering what was up with this family and its knack to suddenly render him incapable of speech. \"Making dinner,\" Chicha said, pointing back to the kitchen. \"You coming?\" \"Oh.\" Dinner too? Well, it wasn't like he had much to do in this village anyway. \"Yeah, just tell me when it's ready.\" He was met with laughter, of all things. Chicha had one hand on her forehead and one on her stomach as she chuckled, with Chaca and Tipo sniggering as well, their hands over their mouths. \"Oh, you're not just staying for dinner,\" Chicha explained after the laughter subsided. \"You're making it.\" Chaca and Tipo stayed at the dining table, happily feeding Silvie/Puma (a decisive name still hadn't been chosen, and frankly, neither sounded all that amazing to Kuzco) a twig Kuzco had yanked off for them from a tree just outside their house. Meanwhile, Kuzco frowned down at his potatoes, weakly grazing them with a knife. Chicha walked up to him, her arms on her hips, a bowl of finely chopped tomatoes and avocadoes nested in the crook of one of them. Now it was her turn to frown. \"You haven't even started yet?\" \"Oh! I, uh—\" he fumbled with his knife, nearly dropping it. \"Of course I've started, uh...\" He could feel beads of sweat forming on his forehead as Chicha looked at him expectantly. Without thinking, he dove the knife straight into a potato, stared at it in silence for a moment, then picked up the knife by the handle, its blade now adorned with the vegetable. His cheeks grew warm as he offered the knife to Chicha. \"I think it's stuck.\" There it was again, that laughter. What was he to the village, some sort of joke? Perhaps he was the laughingstock of the entire empire and he just didn't know it. Chicha used her free arm to wipe a tear from her eye as Kuzco stood there, silent and expressionless. \"You really don't know how to look after yourself, do you?\" Kuzco clenched his fists. \"No! And I'd appreciate it if I wasn't laughed at for it, thanks,\" he snapped. Chicha's smile faded as Kuzco turned his back to face those stupid potatoes once more. A warm, gentle breeze wafted in from the kitchen windows, but to Kuzco, it felt like it was raining. Stupid and cold and grey and dreary and stupid, while he stood there, speechless and stupid. Everything was stupid. He was in front of Mudka's, once more a stupid llama, eavesdropping on words he would never forget, try as he might. The empire will finally be rid of that useless slug. He dropped his knife and heard a dull clang as it hit the floor. That's what Yzma had said. Emperors were reincarnations of Inti, the great Sun God himself. The great life force that helped the crops of the empire thrive. He was the sun, the people his crops. But these crops...they thrived on their own. He didn't know who or what it was, but they already had their own Sun. And he certainly wasn't a crop, so what exactly was he? He bit his lip. A hand gently touched his shoulder as he stared down at the counter. \"Kuzco.\" It was Chicha. No snark, no aggression, just something that sounded like concern. \"It's okay if you don't know everything.\" \"But that's not my problem, is it?\" He answered bitterly. \"I don't know anything.\" \"What? That's not what I meant—\" \"Maybe that's not what you said, but that's what's true. All of you know exactly what to do, and exactly how to do it. It doesn't matter if you have basically nothing, you still know how to roll with it. And...I can't and I don't know why.\" He looked up at Chicha and sighed. \"I'm the emperor. I'm supposed to know what to do.\" Chicha looked down, brows furrowed as Kuzco picked up the knife and set it back on the counter. \"You're not the emperor,\" she said finally. His eyes narrowed in confusion. \"What?\" What was it with this family and spouting advice that never made sense? \"Emperor, that's...well, that's just a title,\" she explained. \"Emperor isn't the only part of you, though.\" \"Yeah, easy for you to say. You're a mom, a wife, a neighbor, a good cook—\" \"Hey, are you trying to flatter me into liking you?\" He smirked. \"Maybe.\" Chicha chuckled. \"See? You're just as much of a person as any of us. And not paying attention to that can hurt you.\" \"Mmm. I get you. But...if I'm not just emperor, then what else am I?\" The front door creaked as it was flung open. \"Honey, I'm back!\" Pacha yelled from the entrance. Chicha crossed her arms and smiled knowingly, and this time Kuzco could understand what that smile meant. \"Take a guess.\" A friend. Kuzco was a friend. Reminders of that were strewn all throughout dinner. \"Mmm, Chicha—\" Pacha said between bites of dinner, \"—the quinoa's amazing.\" \"Well, don't thank just me,\" she said, raising an eyebrow and smiling. \"Llama Boy here helped me too.\" Pacha blinked for a second, trying to process what she'd said. Kuzco laughed. \"Yeah, I can't believe it either. I didn't even know how to peel and cut a potato until an hour ago.\" \"Well, it's good you're learning,\" said Pacha, piling more food onto his plate. \"Heh. Yeah.\" Suddenly, a grey furball leapt onto the table, disrupting the peace as both Chaca and Tipo leapt up from their seats. \"Dad, look, it's Silvie! I think it's hungry.\" \"Here, Puma.\" Tipo offered his spoon to the creature. \"Want some of my tomatoes?\" \"Oh no no no!\" Now it was Kuzco's turn to jump out of his seat. \"Put that spoon down. Chinchillas can't eat tomatoes, it makes them sick.\" \"Ohh,\" Tipo said quietly as he set the spoon down. \"Sorry, buddy,\" he told the chinchilla. \"Huh. How do you know that?\" Pacha asked Kuzco as the boy gently scooped up the chinchilla in his hands and placed it in his lap. \"Had one once,\" he replied. \"Named her Bean—don't laugh, she was really small and I was like, ten,\" he protested when he heard the kids snort. \"Anyways, I found her in the palace garden. She was screeching and it was annoying me, I couldn't go to sleep. I tried to shoo her off but she just stuck to me and wouldn't let go.\" He laughed. \"I sure didn't sleep that night, but she did. On my shoulder.\" He chuckled, recalling the memory. \"Man, Yzma was so mad when she found that thing scurrying in my bedroom.\" \"I...wait,\" Pacha said, setting his spoon down and staring across the table at Kuzco. \"Yzma?\" \"Ah, yeah,\" Kuzco said, grimacing a little. \"She practically raised me. And let me tell you, it was a trip.\" \"That's...awful.\" He smiled. \"Oh man, you're telling me.\" \"So...what happened to Bean?\" Chaca asked. Kuzco's smile faded. \"Oh. Uh, Yzma found her in my room and chewed me out. Something about how it was beneath me to take her in, huge mistakes start with small actions, I'd eventually squander the empire's resources and end up housing a village in my palace, pity was a tactic people used to manipulate my choices so I shouldn't pay attention to them, yadda yadda yadda. I woke up the next day and that was it. Bean was gone and I never saw her again.\" Pacha gazed at him sadly. \"I'm sorry, Kuzco.\" \"It's fine,\" he said, fondling the little furball in his lap. \"This guy's just as cute and furry.\" \"Er, no. I mean—I'm sorry you had someone like...her growing up.\" \"Oh...\" he trailed off. Yzma. The only person with whom he had held conversations with in his entire childhood. Every day was a new lesson: bow down to no one. Don't allow anyone to make you feel for them. Being hard on people is the only way to teach them to submit. Only now could he truly see how it all made him worse, how it had all been poison she was feeding him. But any attention was better than no attention at all...right? She'd helped him up when he scuffed his knees, she talked to him when he cried and couldn't sleep on a stormy night. She pretended to care to keep her position, gain his trust, then strike at just the right time. Snuff out the light she'd helped kindle in the first place. He gritted his teeth. Yzma had been the one to manipulate him all this time. And feeling things for others...that was the way he got out of the hole, not into it. \"Well...you got us, Kuzco,\" Pacha said as picked up his now-empty plate and rose. Chicha nodded in agreement. \"We might not seem like much, but I think you know what us smelly, stupid peasants can be capable of.\" Pacha winked. \"Well, gotta get going. Gotta pack up to head to the palace and stuff.\" The orangey-purple sunset had long since melted into a black sky when Kuzco took leave. \"Bye Kuzco! Thanks for Puma!\" Tipo yelled. \"Um, we never agreed we'd name it Puma. It's a chinchilla. But yeah, it was fun to have you around, Kuzco,\" Chaca said. \"And by the way,\" she added, smirking, \"you're pretty cool for someone who sleeps with a doll.\" \"I—\" Kuzco's words stuck to the inside of his throat. He tried again. \"Wha—\" Chaca and Tipo sniggered. \"How do you know about Wompy?\" \"What, you think no one would notice that purple doll on your nightstand? It looks pretty cute, though.\" Pacha snorted. \"What now? How come you never told me this?\" Kuzco pulled a Chaca and Tipo, sticking his tongue out at the old man. \"Take a guess.\" \"Well, I just hope you know you're never going to hear the end of this one.\" \"Oh, I know that plenty well, Captain Obvious,\" he said. \"Well, seeya.\" \"Bye!\" the family shouted in unison, waving all the way until Kuzco reached the bottom of the hill. He had had eighteen years of living in a shiny illusion, then everything was turned upside—down in less than a week. Pacha had definitely thrown off his groove, big time. But as the boy looked back at that strangely wonderful little house nesting on that large hill, he supposed he could forgive Pacha for that. Oh, boy, was that fun. I figured Chicha would be a bit of a Mama Jaguar before opening up to Kuzco; he did almost take away her family's home, after all. I loved writing her. Like, you could make an entire spin—off series about her. But yeah! There you go. Stay tuned for the next chapter soon! As always, feedback is very much appreciated! :)[Chapter 4] Hello! I'm back once more. Exams and such may get in the way of a consistent update schedule, but rest assure this will not be abandoned. Fun fact: I wrote the draft for the first two chapters almost two years ago. They were lying around in my drafts until I dusted them off and fleshed them out (because let's face it, my writing skills in 8th grade weren't exactly the best). Anyways, hope you enjoy! :) \"Thanks, Mama Jaguar.\" \"Stop calling me that.\" Kuzco snorted as Chicha handed him another cloth. \"But it suits you. Perfect combo of 'don't mess with me' and 'don't mess with my kids.'\" \"Hmm,\" Chicha considered as Kuzco knelt down to scrub the cloth in the basin. \"Fair enough, Llama Boy.\" The two always did laundry like this, full of witty remarks and nicknames, a few laughs here and there. Kuzco claimed that the only reason he stuck around to do the work whenever he stayed at the village was to get a share of Chicha's famous sweet potato bread as a reward; the crop only grew at the very outskirts of the empire and exporting it to the capital wasn't really a priority. And Kuzco just so happened to never address making it a priority in order to keep brandishing his excuse for staying at the Pacha-Chicha residence. But they all knew he didn't stay there just to eat a slice of bread, no matter how undeniably delicious it was. There was some other reason that made him want to stay. Perhaps it was how the sun made the dewdrops on the grass sparkle in the soft light of dawn, as he heard the village around him come to life: the clanging of pots and pans as breakfast was being made, the llamas clucking and bleating as their owners herded them to the pastures, the children playfully yelling and romping around while the babies cried for their mothers. Maybe it was the way Chaca and Tipo always pulled him into their antics, making the emperor climb trees and build forts and wonder just how much of a childhood he has missed out on in the grandeur of the palace. Was it the way he and Chicha exchanged quips and sarcasm? The way he could see laughter lines etched around the corners of her mouth and eyes as she talked and laughed and argued with him, so drastically different from placid, dull-eyed servants who never dared talk back to their god? Was it the way Pacha jovially slapped him on the back whenever he saw him, listening intently as he gossiped about royal affairs (\"I swear, the royal seamstress must have either died and been replaced with a clone overnight or gotten a major facelift. The guy looks like, my age now\")? Perhaps it was all of those things put together...to form a single, distinguishable feeling. But that just frustrated him even more. He always knew that feeling was there, but never what to call it. He stared down at the old washing basin, hues of yellow and green and blue and pink dancing around in the suds just like Chaca had told him they did months ago. Except this time, a bit of red blossomed in the center of the flowers of wet cloth. Chicha had given Kuzco a strange look when he placed those pricey, woollen robes in the basin. \"You sure you wanna do that?\" she asked, tilting an eyebrow upwards. \"The dye from all the other clothes will get into yours.\" Kuzco frowned. \"Well, then, why do you guys do it?\" \"Well, we don't mind.\" \"Well, then, I don't mind either,\" Kuzco stated adamantly. And so he stood there, watching all of the colors bleed, almost fusing with one another in the water. His robes were now tainted with peasant. But it gave him a strange, unexplainable sense of satisfaction. Gods, he wished he could just be able to explain that feeling for once. The two headed inside after setting the clothes out to dry behind the house. House... They treaded through the living room, Kuzco headed straight towards the kitchen for a slice of sweet potato bread, now cooled and ready to be attacked by hungry children and emperors alike. He headed to the second drawer on the left of the kitchen counter for a knife. After visiting this place a few times, he came to know it like the back of his hand. It felt like... ...Home. House. Home. Oh, no. Nonononononono. Kuzco nearly dropped the knife as he realized what that strange feeling that constantly gnawed at him was. Up here, up on this strange, little hilltop at the outskirts of his empire... ...He felt at home. Stupid peasants. He shouldn't be feeling this way. The palace was his home. The palace was his rightful home, the place he was promised ever since birth. If he threw that away, what would he have left? This stupid feeling and this strange desire to be something he would never be. Oh, Gods. How had he been falling for this act this whole time? They reeled him in with their jokes, laughter, advice, and friendliness. But now it had tainted him. Once he had gotten a taste of it, he wanted more. But he'd only ever get it halfway, never on the level he wanted it. Family and Kuzco were never meant to belong in the same sentence. He set the knife down on the table. He had lost his appetite. He never wanted to step foot in this house again. It was filled with things he could never have. \"Kuzco?\" He looked up. Chicha was there, leaning on the kitchen entryway like she always did. Kuzco grit his teeth. Like she always did . He had noticed it and thought it was important enough to file away in his brain. But why was she so important? Peasant. Just a measly peasant. They were all peasants. They didn't matter, didn't matter shouldn't matter never mattered. \"—bread yet?\" Kuzco realized he had accidentally tuned Chicha out. He glared down at his sandals. \"What?\" he asked softly, unable to trust himself to say anything more. Old Kuzco was fighting to come back to the surface, and it wasn't going to be pretty. \"I asked if you'd gotten some bread yet...\" Kuzco could almost feel her eyes narrow as she trailed off. \"What's up with you?\" \"Oh, nothing. Doing just dandy. Just remembered I have an errand back at the palace I forgot about though. Seeya.\" He almost ran to the front door, anxious to leave all this behind and lock up his strange feelings in this house he'd never come back to again. \"Hold it, mister.\" Chicha's authoritative tone made Kuzco's spine stiffen. \"You're not going anywhere. Something's up.\" \"And I don't want you to care about it!\" Kuzco spun around, jabbing a finger in Chicha's direction. \"You think you can just pull me into your little peasant game and act like I'm one of you when I'm not! Seriously? Helping you cook? Sweeping the house? Doing laundry? What is this, my house? No! I don't even tie my own sandals back at the palace! Someone else does it for me! What are you trying to do, convert me? I'm done falling for your mind tricks!\" A shocked silence filled the air as Kuzco panted after his tirade, a hand planted on his forehead, sweaty and glistening from the work he did outside. \"Sorry,\" he breathed finally. There it was again, that foreign word snaking its way out of his mouth in a low hiss. He turned back to face the door, not daring to look Chicha in the eye. \"What you're doing is nice, but it's not gonna work. I'm leaving.\" He pushed open the wooden door to walk out, only to find himself face to face with a large man in a green poncho, arms crossed and wearing an unreadable expression on his face. \"Kuzco,\" Pacha ordered. \"Back of the house. Now.\" \"Look. I don't know what came over me, okay? But it's not gonna happen again 'cause I'm never coming back here. Just leave me alone.\" \"No,\" Pacha said, crossing his arms. \"Being alone is the last thing you need right now. You always seem so happy visiting us. Don't you like it here?\" \"Ugh, I do!\" Kuzco turned away from him, violently tearing out blades of grass from the ground. \"That's why I'm not coming back.\" \"What? That doesn't even make any sense!\" Kuzco gave a sharp laugh. \"Well, that makes you ugly and stupid! You just don't understand!\" \"Well, how can I understand it if all you do is keep acting up and pushing everyone away?!\" Kuzco's mouth clamped shut. As usual, Pacha was right. And he. Hated it. The two sat in a tense silence until Pacha finally broke it. \"Kuzco, what was it like at the palace?\" The young man stared at him. \"What do you mean? You've been inside there before, haven't you? It's huge and fancy. And I live there. That's all you need to know.\" \"No. I mean...growing up there.\" \"Oh. Well, every day was just like the other. Singing, dancing, bossing people around. There's a method to the madness.\" \"Huh.\" Pacha raised an eyebrow. \"Even before you took the throne?\" \"What the—what do you care about that?\" Kuzco asked, suddenly wary. He wasn't going to dive into this again. He had been doing well at forgetting it all before these peasants barged into his life. \"Well, emperor or not, you must've come from somewhere, right? From someone?\" Kuzco stopped attacking the grass, his hands suddenly still. He placed them in his lap. \"You talking about my parents?\" \"Well...yeah.\" \"Then forget it,\" Kuzco snapped, getting up. \"I'm out of here.\" \"Oh, no you're not!\" Pacha yanked the boy back to the ground where he fell facefirst with a yelp. \"Uh—sorry,\" Pacha said sheepishly as Kuzco cursed and wiped the dirt from his face. \"But look, I'm trying to help you. And besides, I saved your life. Multiple times. You gotta owe me one sometime or another.\" Kuzco gave a dramatic sigh, blowing black tendrils of hair out of his face. \"Fiiine. If I tell you, will you just shut up and mind your own business for the rest of the time I'm at the village?\" \"Deal. Anything else you want, your Highness?\" \"Hmm.\" Kuzco considered this. \"A loaf of bread to take back to the palace.\" Pacha laughed. \"Alright. But only if you talk. Now spill.\" \"Um...okay. Mom was Empress Suti. Dad was Emperor Urqu. But I guess you already knew that.\" He shrugged. \"Look, if you want me to tell you stuff about them, there's not really much to say. They barely talked to me. He spent all his time locked up in the royal meeting chamber talking about war tactics. She spent all her time balancing the imperial budget. The empire was their child. Not me. So there I was, stuck with the worst babysitter imaginable.\" Pacha grimaced. \"Yzma.\" \"Yep. Except...\" Kuzco sighed. \"I didn't think she was all that bad,\" he said quietly. \"Huh, really...\" \"Mhm. I mean, she talked to me. She told me the world was mine. Pointed out how the rulers never paid attention to their own son and said, 'See? You can't trust anyone. The only one you have in this world is yourself.'\" He gently traced the patches of bare dirt from which he'd uprooted bunches of grass. \"It's all about me,\" he whispered. Except it wasn't. Not exactly. It was about his reflection. Not Kuzco himself. It was about how others saw him and how they acted accordingly. But the water was ugly and murky, the mirrors all shattered. He had no idea what his reflection looked like. \"Anyways,\" Kuzco continued, \"I think I was around eight when Dad went on a sailing trip. Some sort of diplomatic sesh with a nearby kingdom to prevent invasion.\" \"And what happened?\" Pacha asked. \"They say he got speared right through the chest as he made his way to negotiate with them. But whatever it was, he didn't make it back. That's the important part. Mom had to take the wheel from there. Well, technically, it was supposed to be me. But I had no idea how to run an empire—probably still don't, either. But yeah. No way was she gonna let some kid touch her precious child.\" He gritted his teeth. \"So she took over entirely. Like I mean, entirely . She wouldn't let anyone advise her. She fired nearly all of the royal council. She locked herself up in her room sketching forts and warships. Guess she was paranoid of an invasion after what happened. Eventually, the stress got to her really bad. Silver hair, scary-dark eyebags. She just kept withering away, 'til one day...she was nothing at all. She got so stressed and sick that she just couldn't take it anymore. And then—this guy made it to the throne,\" he said, pointing at himself. \"No bittersweet memories or mushy feelings if that's what you were expecting, thank you very much.\" \"Hmm. So you don't miss them. At all.\" Kuzco crossed his arms. \"Nope. Not one bit.\" \"Honest?\" \"Ugh, yes. Honest. So...\" he continued to trace the bald patches of dirt on the ground. \"Why do I still feel like I'm missing...something?\" \"Well, 'cause you miss them,\" Pacha said, matter-of-factly. \"Pacha! I just said I don't! Were you even listening to me?\" Gods , this man was impossible. \"Now, I'm not you, but it sounds like...you miss the idea of them. The idea of a family. Like after your chance to have one was taken away from you...\" \"...I felt like I'd never be able to have one again,\" Kuzco finished. \"And...I convinced myself that the only person I ever needed in my life was me.\" \"But, hey.\" Pacha got up, motioning for Kuzco to do the same. He gave Kuzco that warm smile of his, the kind that reached his eyes and made Kuzco feel even stranger than before, but in a good way. \"Guess even gods can be wrong.\" And he pulled the young boy into a hug. A bear hug. The same hug he saw Pacha give Chaca and Tipo not too long ago. And it was enough to make the emperor truly spill. Oh, sweet Inti, it was embarrassing. Hot tears fell down Kuzco's face as he held onto that green poncho, almost digging his nails into it. Solid. Reassuring. There. Three characteristics he'd only ever had in objects, like his Wompy or the golden throne. But to have it in a person...it sure was something else. A strange feeling. But rather than shoving it aside, he was beginning to accept it. \"Gods, I'm such a baby,\" he said, laughing as he wiped his face after pulling away from Pacha. \"Oh, no you're not.\" \"Oh, really? And when was the last time you cried?\" \"That one time Chicha tried making roast beetles for dinner.\" \"I heard that,\" Chicha said as she made her way outside, little Yupi nesting happily in a baby sling around her back. Pacha grinned sheepishly. \"And for your information,\" she said, \"beetles are full of protein and rich in nutrients.\" \"Well! As delicious as that sounds, I'll stick to that bread,\" Kuzco said. \"Don't you know the rules of this house, young man? Dinner before dessert.\" \"But—!\" \"No buts.\" At that moment, a small blob of grey sped out of the house's back entrance, followed by two kids, panting from exhaustion. \"Silvie!\" \"Puma!\" Chaca and Tipo eventually forgot about the chinchilla they were pursuing, who was now napping comfortably in Kuzco's lap. Chicha put a hand to her forehead. \"Ugh, Kuzco, why did you have to get that thing out from underneath their bed? They've been arguing over what to name it for months.\" Kuzco grinned. \"Well, if they really can't decide, we might as well just name this handsome devil Kuzco Junior.\" \"Wait—no!\" Chaca and Tipo hastily stopped arguing and ran over to Kuzco. \"Anything but that!\" Chaca pleaded. \"Hmm...how about Bean?\" Pacha offered. Kuzco stared at him. \"Really?\" \"Well, yeah—if you want, that is.\" \"Hmm. Yeah, guess we could name it Bean,\" Kuzco said nonchalantly. \"You're gonna regret not naming it Kuzco Junior, though, just saying.\" Pacha laughed. \"Right.\" \"Yeah, I swear, you're gonna...\" Kuzco trailed off as he eyed the robes drying on the wooden stick a few feet away from him. \"What is it, Kuzco?\" \"Er, nothing, I just...\" he trailed off again, making his way to the bar. \"My robe,\" Kuzco said finally. \"It's...kinda greenish. And a little yellow some places too.\" Chicha sighed. \"I'm sorry, Kuzco...I told you the other colors would bleed into it if you washed it with them.\" \"Hey.\" Kuzco turned around to face Chicha. \"I never said it was a bad thing.\" He held the royal robes up in the light of the now-setting sun, inspecting the multicolored blotches that had blossomed on it from its time in the basin. It looked drastically different from the flashy, spotless red he had worn his entire life. It even smelled different after being in the basin, like fresh mint with a trace of...was that llama? He knew that smell all too well. The robe had a soft texture, as was expected, but slightly fluffier than usual, small bits of yarn frayed and branching out into small, fuzzy red tendrils. And he couldn't wait to wear it at the palace. It would be a reminder of the busy mornings and the noisy llamas, of Chaca and Tipo's boundless energy (as well as the little furball's) and of Chicha's smile and that trademark Mama Jaguar sass that almost outrivaled his (almost). And it would remind him of Pacha, that crazy old man who swung on a vine through a bunch of killer jaguars, fell down a waterfall, punched the emperor right in the face, dressed him up like a peasant lady, ran around with him on the palace roof...and saved Kuzco's life. Every stain on that robe was a reminder. Even at the distant palace with its aloof servants and obliging silence, in the heart of the capital, far from the outskirts of the empire, he would be reminded of... Home. Some heartwarming stuff because I'm a sucker for that; sometimes cheesy stuff is nice, but hopefully I didn't make it too gooey! Also, woah! I'm like, halfway through finishing this fic. I'll be back with some more stuff soon enough. :) In the meantime, I'd like to thank you guys for the support, it means a lot![Chapter 5] \"Kuuuuzcoooo!\" The emperor braced himself as two small missiles launched themselves at him, latching onto the arms he had extended outwards to greet them with a hug. Instead, Chaca and Tipo seemed to be content with hanging from Kuzco's arms. Kuzco chuckled. \"Miss me much?\" Tipo hopped down. \"Yeah! What did you get for us?\" \"Ohhh, I see. You're playing it nice so you can grab the goods and leave.\" Kuzco tapped his head. \"Smart thinking.\" \"What? Nonono—\" Chaca hopped down as well. \"—we missed you!\" Kuzco turned his head away melodramatically. \"Likely story.\" \"No!\" Tipo protested as well. \"We did, you always have funny stories and cool dance moves and—hey! Yupi, get out of the way, I'm trying to have a conversation!\" \"Wait, what?\" Kuzco whipped his head back around; sure enough, Yupi was tottering between Kuzco and Tipo, small curls of black hair bouncing up and down on his head as he did so. He almost tripped over his chubby legs and quickly grabbed hold of Kuzco's robes for support before he did so. \"...Huh. Well, that's new.\" Kuzco picked up Yupi. \"So, how long has this been a thing?\" Yupi began kicking his legs in the air excitedly, ready to be put down to show off his new skill once more. Chaca shrugged. \"A month, maybe?\" \"A month,\" Kuzco repeated, incredulous. He narrowed his eyes. \"What else did I miss?\" \"Hmm...\" Chaca furrowed her brows as she thought back to what else had happened. \"I lost another tooth! It's near the back here, see?\" Chaca opened up her mouth and twisted her tongue so it pointed towards the gap in her mouth. Kuzco laughed. \"You don't even need to tell me that. It's like you lose a tooth every time I see you.\" \"I grew an inch!\" Tipo interjected. Kuzco blinked. \"An inch in a month?\" Tipo shrugged. \"Isn't that normal?\" \"Uh...no.\" \"Guess I'm just special, then.\" He beamed, revealing a sizeable gap in the middle of his bottom row of teeth. \"Woah, get out. You too?\" Kuzco muttered as Tipo stuck his tongue through the place where two of his baby teeth once were. \"Kuzco!\" Chicha walked out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a towel she was holding. \"Great to see you.\" \"Yeah, you too...\" Kuzco frowned. \"You know where Pacha's at?\" \"Near the back tending to Misty. I can deliver a message to him if you want.\" \"Nah, it's more of a one-on-one kind of thing.\" \"Huh. Alright. Make it quick, though. We got a fresh load of laundry to take care of in the back.\" Kuzco peered into the kitchen, rocking back and forth on his heels. \"Is there a fresh loaf in the oven to take care of, too?\" Chicha chuckled. \"Not today. I'm making something a little more...special.\" Kuzco narrowed his eyes in confusion. \"Ooookay.\" He decided not to question her. He had more important things to do. Like having a little chat with his peasant friend. \"I just hope it's beetle-free!\" he called back to Chicha as he ran outside of the house. When Kuzco saw Pacha, he promptly punched him in the arm. \"Ow! What the...\" he turned around, frowning as his eyes met Kuzco's. \"Well, that's one way to make an entrance.\" Kuzco simply glared back at Pacha, arms crossed in silence. \"So, uh...\" Pacha cleared his throat as he offered a bowl of water in his hand to Misty, holding it up to the llama's mouth. \"what's up?\" \"Pach, buddy, I'm gonna kill you.\" \"And why is that?\" \"Oh, take a guess. I walk into the house and Chaca and Tipo jump up and start swinging around my arms like a bunch of little monkeys, right? Nothing new. But then Yupi runs up to me and starts to climb my leg too? I just— ugh.\" Kuzco kicked at the dirt in frustration. Pacha placed the now empty bowl on the ground and raised his hands in defense. \"Hey, I can't help you with that. The kids just seem to gravitate towards you, Kuzco. Even the ones who have no idea what you're saying.\" He chuckled. \"No, no. That's not what I meant, I mean—Yupi's walking? Tipo's losing teeth now? He even told me he grew a whole inch while I was gone!\" Pacha grinned. \"He's lying about that, you know. He keeps counting his hair as part of his height.\" \"Oh. Heh.\" Kuzco almost smiled but caught himself, shaking his head. \"Doesn't matter, Mister 'Oh-Nothing-Much-Going-On-In-The-Old-Village.' You seriously think you can get away with lying to me whenever you visit me at the palace?\" \"The kids are just growing up! That's a normal thing, Kuzco.\" \"For you, maybe!\" Pacha raised an eyebrow. \"Well, what did you do in the last month?\" Kuzco shrugged. \"Eh. Went over some last-minute formalities about a new school before opening it, settled a major land dispute between two peasant families, kissed a few babies. Nothing special.\" \"I don't know, those sound like pretty important things to me.\" \"I could care less about them, honestly.\" Pacha grinned. \"Are you saying you care about us more?\" \"What? I, uh—\" Kuzco cleared his throat, spine stiff and shoulders tensed. \"I don't know what you're talking about, I uh...\" he cleared his throat again, almost as if he were trying to cough the words out. \"I thought you already knew that,\" he said finally, quietly. \"Oh, I do know. Just wanted to hear you say it out loud for once.\" \"Wooow. Not cool.\" Kuzco glared at Pacha, whose crinkled smile took up most of his weathered face; he stared back at the ground, which still sported a few black patches of dirt from the fit he had thrown months ago, when he had claimed that he would never come back to this stupid hilltop ever again. But here he was once more, paying monthly visits to Pacha and Co. But it seemed like even once a month wasn't enough. \"Just...keep me posted, okay? You're lucky I didn't trip over Yupi today. He's getting pretty tall.\" Pacha laughed. \"You're telling me. He almost grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter the other day. Chicha nearly had a heart attack.\" Kuzco crossed his arms. \"Oh, like you didn't?\" Pacha shrugged. \"Fair enough. So...you bring anything for the kids?\" \"You too?\"Kuzco rolled his eyes. \"Of course I did.\" Pacha pointed to Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi, who were running out of the house towards Kuzco, giggling with their arms outstretched. \"Better give those to them, then. Looks like they're about to attack you again.\" Chaca waltzed around the house in circles, attempting to teach herself how to play the flute Kuzco had given her, and Tipo was delighted with his colored pencils—until Chicha said he wasn't allowed to use the walls as his canvas. Yupi sat on the couch next to Pacha, violently shaking the ball in his hands and cooing at the rattling noise it made. Bean made sure to steer clear from Yupi's hands, preferring to scurry around on the edge of one of the couch's arms. \"Well!\" Kuzco said, patting his nonexistent pockets, \"Looks like the gift well is all dry. Come back again some other time!\" \"Hold up!\" Chicha strode into the living room, wearing faded blue oven mitts and carrying a steaming plate of something that looked remarkably unlike sweet potato bread. The smell seemed strangely familiar, though. Kuzco eyed the plate. \"What's this? Dinner before dessert?\" \"Just a little something special for today,\" Chicha replied, setting the plate and a knife down on the table. \"...Chocolate?\" Kuzco asked, confused. \"Thought that stuff wasn't common on the countryside.\" \"Well, just because it's a delicacy doesn't mean we never have it,\" said Chicha. The kids crowded around to look at the cake. \"Soooo...what's the special occasion? I thought Chaca turned eleven last month.\" \"That she did,\" Pacha said, the weight on the couch shifting slightly as he turned a bit to face Kuzco. \"This one's for me.\" Kuzco gaped at him. \"Get out.\" \"No, really. I think I'm...oh, what? Forty-one? Forty-two? Aging doesn't exactly help improve your memory.\" \"Don't. Even. Talk. To me.\" \"What's his problem?\" Chaca asked her mother. Chicha simply crossed her arms in response, raising an eyebrow as she stared at the emperor. Pacha sighed. \"Kuzco, I'm sorry...\" \"You better be. Look at me!\" He spread his arms out. \"Coming here empty-handed. It's like you want to humiliate me.\" \"I didn't want anything from you.\" Kuzco jerked his head up to glare at Pacha, a bit stung. \"Really,\" he said coldly. \"Really! I mean—\" he slung his arm over Kuzco's shoulder and used his other one to gesture to the kids and Chicha. \"—look around. I'm surrounded by a loving family. What more could I ever want?\" Kuzco snorted, pointing to a tear in Pacha's clothes. \"Maybe a nicer poncho?\" \"Kuzco!\" \"You're wasting your time trying to pull off this whole fuzzy-feely tactic on me, old man. Expect a wagonload of stuff the next time I see you.\" He jabbed a finger in Pacha's chest. \"You hear that? Wagonload.\" \"I hear you.\" \"Good. And don't you ever keep me out of the loop again, capisce?\" Pacha chuckled. \"Alright, alright. You drive a hard bargain, your Highness.\" \"Hey, just doing what I do. So!\" Kuzco clapped his hands. \"Anyone ready to break the rules? Here's to dinner before dessert.\" He grabbed the knife. Reverse dinner was going quite well until Chaca spit her cake back out onto her plate. Kuzco was going to have a hard time unseeing that. \"I think I lost another tooth,\" she announced, digging through her chewed-up slice until she found a hard, white canine. \"What? That's crazy!\" Kuzco exclaimed. \"How many teeth do you even have in your mouth now, kid? Three? Two?\" \"Actually, if my calculations are correct, twenty-one.\" Kuzco blinked. \"Wow. Maybe I should get you a pair of dentures the next time I visit.\" Chaca shoved him. \"Oh, shut up,\" she grumbled. Kuzco and Pacha both laughed as Chaca scooped up Bean from the couch and marched off. \"You know,\" Kuzco said, in between forkfuls of cake, \"this isn't too bad. You should spend more birthdays with me.\" Pacha smiled. \"Will do. Well, for however many birthdays I have left, anyways.\" Kuzco's smile faded instantly. He set his plate down, stony-faced. \"Don't say that,\" he snapped. \"Woah, hey. I didn't mean it that way.\" \"Doesn't matter. Just don't ever say that again.\" Kuzco started fiddling with a loose thread on the couch. \"Kuzco...it's gonna happen to all of us someday. And when it does—\" Kuzco snorted. \"What, are you too afraid to say die? I know you're going to die someday, okay? I'm not that stupid.\" \"Never said you were.\" Kuzco didn't answer. He squeezed his eyes shut and and inhaled sharply. All this time, he had only ever thought of gaining friends. Gods, he was so stupid to not realize that he could lose them just as quickly. Mortality was a curse even the emperor couldn't escape. It made him slightly more than irritated. \"Do you know who built this house?\" The emperor's eyes snapped open upon hearing Pacha's voice. He groaned. \"You're doing that thing again.\" Pacha frowned. \"What thing?\" \"That thing where you ask some random question that makes no sense and then connect it to some sort of heartwarming advice that's supposed to make me feel all gooey sentimental inside. So, what's your moral of the day, Daddy Pach?\" \"Take it easy,\" Pacha replied. \"And try not to rip up the couch.\" \"Oh, come on. You were about to say something deeper than that.\" \"So you wanna hear it?\" Kuzco shrugged, sinking back into the couch. \"I'll humor you.\" Pacha rolled his eyes. \"I'm deeply honored, your Highness. Anyways, this house was built by my great-great-great-great grandfather and grandmother. It's stood up on this village for almost two hundred years.\" \"Huh. That's pretty long. Impressive.\" \"Yep. Needless to say, they're not around anymore— well, their bodies aren't, anyways. But I can still feel them. They're here. They're watching over us. They founded this village and they're helping it grow. You can see them if you look up outside at night.\" \"The...stars?\" Kuzco asked, perplexed. \"Yep. Never believed in that kind of stuff at first, but when I looked up at the stars the night my grandmother died, I saw a new one, right next to the spot my great-grandparents were supposed to be. They're all there, staring down at this village. We're never alone.\" \"Wow.\" Kuzco considered this. \"That's...kinda creepy, actually.\" Pacha groaned. \"Heh! Just kidding. So, Pacha...when you turn into a star, where are you gonna be?\" He shrugged. \"Don't know yet.\" \"Gee, real helpful. Thanks.\" \"Kuzco, I don't even know when it'll happen. And I don't think anyone ever knows where they'll be. It just sort of...happens. You know where you belong up there, and it just becomes your spot. You don't pick and choose.\" \"Huh.\" Kuzco looked out through the window. A cool, gentle breeze wafted in, making the ends of his hair tickle his neck. Would Kuzco's star be above the palace? It seemed to be the most logical place, shining right above his throne, large and bright. A beacon of light in the night sky, right in the heart of the empire. But he knew Pacha's would be up here on this hilltop. The old man had gone through ridiculous lengths to keep this small house here, among the noisy llamas and bountiful vegetable fields. And Kuzco was beginning to understand why. He sighed. \"Just promise you'll tell me before you head up there, alright?\" Pacha set his cake down on the table and looked out the window, smiling. \"Oh, don't worry. I will.\" \"Good,\" Kuzco said. \"'Cause that's an order from your emperor.\" He picked up his slice of cake and clinked the edge of his plate with the one Pacha was holding. \"Cheers, Grandpa.\" Whoo, almost done! I have one more chapter in mind and an epilogue, although I'm considering making them both just one chapter because I don't think the epilogue will be too long. Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'm actually going to go watch this movie again for the first time since last year. Never gets old. Also, I'm a sucker for stargazing scenes. I just love the atmosphere of them. Once more, thank you so much for reading! :) ","Summary":" Hello! Just a few disclaimers and sidenotes before we get to the good stuff. 1) This fic does not a"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"Rooster Cogburn: The Early Years","Author":"Writing39B","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9098050","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter 1: The Rooster Takes Flight The Civil War is over. The Union has won and the Confederate States of America are no more. For the Confederate veterans, there isn't much to do anymore. Some of them choose to still resist the Union while the others give in to the new government. Two young Confederate veterans just received news that the war is over. Their names are Reuben \"Rooster\" Cogburn and Harold Potter. Rooster is a fiery one who often gets into trouble and is as stubborn as a fourteen-year-old girl. Deep down inside though, he is a softy. Potter is a calm soul whose vigilance is matched only by his loyalty to his friends. \"What do we do now that the war is over?\" asked Potter. \"We have no money and not many are too willing to give a couple of Confederates a job, much less one missing an eye.\" \"Hell, I don't know,\" said Rooster. \"Shooting is about all I know how to do. That's why I signed up for the war in the first place.\" \"I know it may be hard for you but first we need to get over the whole Confederate business and get used to the new government.\" \"Damn those Yankees! If I didn't lose an eye and we were still with Captain Quantrill, we would've swept the Yankee line in Kansas City. But I guess you're right. I'll just have to suck it up.\" \"That's the spirit. We're coming up on a town right now.\" They came up to a town called Independence, where Federal officers were looking to round up the last of the Confederate guerrilla soldiers. An officer approached the two men. \"Are you boys Confederates?\" asked the officer. \"Yes. We've come to surrender our arms and swear loyalty to the government,\" replied Potter. \"You've come to the right place. You two follow me to my office. We can start the ceremony and do all the formal stuff there.\" Rooster and Potter followed the officer until they came up to a relatively large wooden building. On the side of the building was a small stable with some mules inside. The group entered the office and the Federal officer walked into the back room. He returned with a few papers and a pen. \"Ok you can start by swearing this oath out loud to me. Then you have to sign a few papers,\" said the officer. Rooster and Potter swore the oath and signed the papers. Rooster angrily grumbled the oath and spilled the pen ink by \"accident\". \"Alright, now the business part is over with,\" said the officer. \"Now you boys have a one-day parole to wait for. Tonight we have a major from Kansas coming in to weed out any of you bushwhackers so don't think about leaving town. Come back here tomorrow morning. Until then you can stay at one of the inns in town.\" The officer walked into the back room again. Rooster whispered to Potter, \"I don't like the sound of that big shot major. And what the hell is a bushwhacker?\" \"I don't know but it sounds a bit fishy to me too. I doubt they'd be too kind if they found out we rode with Bill Anderson and Captain Quantrill. Maybe we ought to leave before anything gets nasty,\" said Potter. \"But what do we do without our weapons?\" Rooster replied, \"I saw the officer put his revolver in the desk drawer. We could take that for protection. Then we can go around to the stable and take a couple of mules and book it out of town.\" \"Ok but we need to do this quickly and quietly.\" \"You think I can't do that?\" Rooster and Potter smiled at each other then tiptoed around the officer's desk. They quietly slipped the revolver out of his drawer and snuck out before the officer came back. They proceeded to creep into the stable where the mules were tied up. Rooster untied two mules from their posts but left their mouths tied so they wouldn't make as much noise. Without looking suspicious, the two veterans walked out of town with the two mules and a new revolver. About eight miles out of town, Potter spotted some figures in the distance. Potter pulled Rooster to the side and said, \"Wait a second. I see some people coming up on us.\" \"You think they came for us?\" asked Rooster. Potter shook his head and said, \"No. They came from the opposite direction of town so I don't think they would've come so fast. They look like they're carrying something though.\" \"Alright then what do we have to be afraid of? If we act natural then we shouldn't have any problems.\" Soon they approached the figures. There were four of them riding on horses. They were all wearing Federal uniforms. One of them had the uniform of a Union Captain and carried large sacks on his horse. The captain asked them, \"Hello there gentlemen. Would either of you two know where Kansas City is?\" \"We wouldn't know,\" replied Potter. \"But there's a town a few miles down the road that may be able to help you. If you don't mind me asking, what's taking you to Kansas city?\" \"We have some gold to deliver to the reserves there. That's why I have these four guards,\" answered the captain. Without a word, Rooster and Potter looked at each other and instantly hatched a plan. Rooster jumped at the captain and grabbed his gun. At the same time, Potter knocked one of the guards in the head with the stolen revolver. Then they held the captain and the other guards at gunpoint. \"Don't move an inch!\" yelled Rooster. \"If one of you moves so much as a finger I'll blow your hand clean off! Now drop your guns and get off your horses!\" The captain and the two conscious soldiers dropped their rifles and dismounted. Potter quickly grabbed the rifles. Rooster jumped onto one of the horses and grabbed the reins of another. Potter followed suit. The two veterans turned bandit rode off down the road and left the Federates stranded. After riding a few miles down further, Rooster and Potter stopped to count their loot. \"Looks like we got ourselves a few thousand in gold Potter!\" exclaimed Rooster. \"Ya. Looks like we did,\" Potter said solemnly. \"Buck up Potter. It was just some government money. What's a few thousand gold to them? They have plenty and we don't have any.\" \"But now they'll be after us. I think it's best if we don't ride together for awhile. At least until we get the heat off of us.\" \"I suppose you're right. What'll you do?\" \"I think I'll ride down south to Arkansas. I know the area well enough. I was thinking about settling down after the war anyhow. What about you?\" \"I don't know. I figure I'll ride east and see where that takes me.\" \"Try not to start too much trouble over there. I hear the law is tougher on the east.\" \"Since when do I start trouble?\" They both looked at each other and smiled. After splitting the gold, Rooster and Potter parted ways.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2: The Princess and the Green Frog As a precaution, Rooster took the next few weeks living off the land and riding on his horse. He only ventured into town when he needed supplies. Eventually, Rooster became tired of roughing it and ended up in Cairo, Illinois where he started going by the name Reuben Burroughs. He used his money to buy himself a small living quarters and a local saloon called The Green Frog. While the saloon served mostly men, one afternoon Rooster had an unusual customer. While Rooster was busy fixing up a drink for a customer, the saloon doors swung open and the room suddenly got quiet. Rooster didn't look at who sat down at the bar but he asked \"What can I get for you bud?\" Instead of hearing a deep voice asking for a sarsaparilla, he heard a small feminine voice say \"Just a glass of milk for me.\" This catches Rooster's attention and he turn to see a woman. She looked to be around the age of twenty, dressed in a nice blue dress, definitely not attire for a saloon. Rooster stared for a good three or four seconds before replying \"Coming right up!\" He quickly finished the other customer's drink and started on the glass of milk immediately. The rest of the saloon went about their business as usual. \"So what brings a pretty little thing like you into a place like this? Don't you have a husband to get to or some children to look after?\" asked Rooster. \"Hello to you too. You don't have very good people skills for a barkeeper. You don't even have the decency to ask my name first?\" she replied. \"Sorry but you caught me off guard. You're the first woman I've gotten in here.\" \"So you're the new owner of this place? Don't you think you're a bit young to be buying and running a saloon?,\" she asked sarcastically. \"I had some very rewarding jobs.\" \"I see. Sounds like trouble to me. Just don't go bringing any of us into it.\" Rooster laughed. \"What makes you say that?\" \"Just a hunch.\" \"Well anyway, my name is Reuben Burroughs. What do they call you?\" \"'They' call me Nola Wilds.\" \"So Nola then, you got a husband and kids?\" \"He left me after the war. Said he wasn't fit for the boring house life yet. As for children, I don't have any of those either.\" \"That's too bad. I'm sorry to hear that.\" Rooster and Nola talked until closing time. Anyone in the saloon that afternoon could tell you that there was instantly something between them and they were right. Nola came in everyday from then on, always ordering just a glass of milk then spending the rest of the day talking to Rooster. Two weeks later he hired her to help him run the saloon. She would take of of ordering supplies and preparing the food since he wasn't good at it. Then again, neither was she. They kept it running with the money from his last heist. A few months later, Rooster and Nola got married. Rooster would be seen around the saloon with a big smile on his face everyday as his wife worked next to him, which helped with his people skills. The two could often be seen making googly eyes at each other while working. Rooster was happy. Within a year, they had a boy named Horace, who was goofy and not all that bright. Rooster was a tough father to say the least. By the time Horace was six they had him helping in the saloon, although he was clumsy and would often break plates and glasses. Rooster would take him to the back to swat and scold him every time. Despite how happy they they were, business was slow and Rooster was running low on money. The tension between them grew whenever they would see that they were losing money and they began to argue more and more often. One night as they were closing up the saloon, Nola said to Rooster, \"You know, I think maybe we could make some more money if you became a lawyer.\" \"How the hell am I going to learn to do something like that?\" replied Rooster. \"Well I went out and found this book on it. It's called Daniels on Negotiable Instruments.\" She dropped a heavy book in front of him. It looked bland and dusty. \"And you expect me to read this?\" Rooster asked. \"If we want some money to take of your wife and ten year old son, then yes.\" Rooster sighed but he knew that arguing wouldn't do any good because she was even more stubborn than him, so he tried to read it. He couldn't get a grasp of it so he went out with some friends to drink without telling Nola. By the time he got back, Nola was furious and yelling at him, again, and telling him how he should take some responsibility in life and for his family. This pattern continued for a couple of weeks where he would come back, they would fight, and he would leave again. Whiskey became his new love. Sometimes it would seem like he drank more alcohol than his customers. Eventually Nola got tired of it. Finally, Nola told him \"I'm leaving you Reuben. Horace is growing and we're not getting any younger. I need someone reliable who can take care of us instead of going to drink with some river fools. I'm going back to find my first husband in Paducah.\" Rooster was angry and a bit shocked, but he was able to contain it and say sternly \"I know we've been having some troubles but I think we can still do this. If you want me to become a lawyer, I'll become a lawyer. I'll read that Daniels book and we'll be happy again. Just don't leave.\" \"It's too late. I can't take you leaving all the time and coming back drunk. Our own son fears you now. It's not just about the money. It's not like it was in the beginning. Goodbye, Reuben, a love for decency does not abide in you.\" At that, Rooster let his anger go and yelled \"Goodbye, Nola, I hope that little nail-selling bastard will make you happy this time.\" Nola left with Horace and Rooster never saw them again. He tried running the store with some other hired help, but he couldn't hold it for long. He became even grumpier and meaner than he was before he met Nola. His broken heart showed on his face and on his gut. He started to look older and fatter from the drinking as well. Eventually he decided he was better suited to go back to his old lifestyle. So, he sold the saloon for nine-hundred dollars and set off again in search of a new adventure.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3: The Law and the Outlaw Rooster found himself wandering through the wild once again. He wanted to leave Reuben Burroughs and all the memories behind him. Still, he couldn't stop thinking about Nola and his son. He would ride town to town not speaking with anyone except for the saloon keeper and the other saloon patrons when he was drunk enough, which was all too often. He bought a pair of navy six rifles with some of the money he had left for hunting. With all the money he spent, he needed a road stake. That's when he came upon the town of Las Vegas, New Mexico. It was a bustling town full of people because it was a stop on the Santa Fe trail and it had a railroad. Along with all the positives of being a booming town, it had its fair share of outlaws. The town had a few banks spread around which were prime targets for outlaws. Once of these outlaws would be Rooster. As he rode into town, Rooster looked around and spotted people walking in and out of a bank. He sat there on his horse in front of the bank, wondering how much money was in there. He thought, \"It wouldn't be the first time I've taken money that wasn't mine. Then again it isn't really theirs either. In fact, these bastards are the ones robbing these poor people of their money! They take the money and spend it on whatever they want. If I take the bank's money, I wouldn't be taking the people's money. I'm taking back what the bank took from them!\" It was failed rationalization but Rooster got off his horse and walked in. There was only a couple of people in the bank and a teller. A guard was stationed next to the door. Rooster quickly pulled the revolver out of the guard's holster and yelled, \"Get down on the ground!\" and shot into the air. Everyone inside panicked and dropped to the floor, including the guard. Rooster wasted no time in going up to the bank teller. \"Tell me where you keep all the cash,\" demanded Rooster. \"I will not hesitate to shoot!\" The bank teller was shaking but he managed to say, \"Behind the counter, in the safe.\" Rooster yelled, \"Well open it up!\" The bank teller stumbled to the safe and started opening the safe. Once the safe was open, Rooster walked around and grabbed a bag from under the counter. He then began stuffing the bag with money until he could hear some distant galloping. Rooster ran outside with the bag in hand and tried to mount the horse. However, the bank guard ripped Rooster down and tried to punch him. Despite being heavier and out of practice, Rooster was able to dodge the punch and send one of his own flying into the guard's temple, knocking him out. Rooster now mounted his horse just in time for three of the town deputies to come riding in. One of them yelled to Rooster, \"Leave the bag here and there won't be any trouble. There are three of us here and more are coming. If you give yourself up now, we won't shoot at you.\" \"Come on, you'll have to do better than that,\" Rooster replied. Rooster had no intention of backing down. He pulled out the revolver, shot at the leg of the deputy's horse and took off. The bullet missed and the deputies took chase. Rooster rode through the town full of people, not knowing which turn led where. The deputies weren't firing for fear of hitting any civilians, which was just fine with Rooster. He rode until he came to the Gallinas River that divided the town in half. He looked back and saw the deputies slowing down behind him. They expected his to stop at the river but he took his horse into the river instead. By the time the other deputies got in, Rooster was out on the other side. However, four more deputies were waiting for him. They blocked Rooster from moving forward while the first three deputies covered his rear. \"There's nowhere to run now,\" said the same deputy as before. \"Even you have to see you're surrounded and outnumbered.\" Rooster was stuck. He thought that he didn't have much to live for at this point anyway. His family is long gone. But somewhere deep inside of him, Rooster still had a crazy determination to live and he still had one crazy plan up his sleeve. \"You're right,\" he said. \"I'll be nice about it though. If any of you value your lives you'll move out of the way.\" The deputies all stood speechless until they all burst out in laughter. \"You've got to be joking,\" one of them said. \"This guy has to be crazy or stupid to think he can break the line!\" \"I may be a bit crazy,\" Rooster said calmly. \"But I don't plan on dying like a dog to some shoddy lawmen like yourselves!\" At that, Rooster put the horse reins between his teeth, grabbed his two navy six rifles, and started forward. He shot both rifles straight ahead of him, missing the deputies but showing them that he meant business. The deputies quickly scattered at the sound of the shots, seeing the determination Rooster had to live. Rooster didn't stop riding even after the town was out of sight. He didn't even bother to look back. He rode for about three hours straight before he just stopped. He may not have someone to live for or a purpose, but Rooster decided that whatever he did, he would be a man of true grit. ","Summary":" Chapter 1: The Rooster Takes Flight The Civil War is over.

I had not thought to ever hear from the Ranger again, especially after finding Cogburn dead and buried, but I did not think the idea distasteful. I was churning butter in the kitchen of my farm when the young boy, Angus Murphy, brought the letter. He was a bright child, not as given to prattling and immoderately high spirits as the rest of his six siblings, and I did not mind his company. \"Miss Mattie?\" His blond head just peeked over the kitchen table, forming a comical picture, were I given to amusement, which I am not. \"State your business, young Angus,\" I said, slightly red from the exertion of churning. \"A letter's come for you, and my Ma told me to bring it over.\" The child's mother was the postmistress, a job she did not do well, but the town tolerated her on account of her being a widow with a large family. I tool the parcel from the boy. It was slightly larger than a normal letter. \"It's all the way from Texas, ma'am!\" The child looked as if he might bounce like an India Rubber Ball. \"I can read that for myself, young Angus,\" I said, thought not as sharply as I might. I gave him a particular look, and he scampered away across the fields. I allowed myself an almost indulgent smile before carefully opening the letter, which had no name on the outside but was marked with a sender's address of San Antonio, Texas. The letter itself was written on plain white paper. Dear Miss Ross, I do not know if you will have retained the name with which I address you, though I have a certain suspicion that you may have done so. By making this observation, I do not mean to denigrate either your person or your character, for I know for a fact that you have been an exemplary and most determined woman from the age of fourteen years, and one not without attractions, though I did not comment upon them during our prior acquaintance. The reason I have chosen to write to you after so long an interval is that it has recently come to my attention that our mutual acquaintance, Mr. Rooster Cogburn, US Marshall, has gone to his final rest. Knowing you as I do, I thought that you would like to know. I do not think you will be averse to hearing a short account of my own life. I was a Ranger for many years, both feared by the lawless and praised by the righteous, of which I am, I believe, justifiably proud. I was married for six months in the year that would have contained your eighteenth birthday. My wife passed away while birthing our daughter Lizzie, who also died. The years have not taken the missing from me, but they have taken my youth. I am an old man now, Mattie Ross. I know that you are a woman now, grown and approaching age yourself, but I confess that I cannot picture you so. I ever remember you as the small, determined person who did not bear me ill-will for a beating and fought harder than any officer with whom I have since served. I do not expect a response from you, though if you wish to return one, I will receive it with pleasure and read it with satisfaction. Yours, LaBoeuf I read the letter over three times, noting the inelegant handwriting that nonetheless articulated a certain elegant economy of phrase. Mr. LaBoeuf had not changed. He was still the unassuming gentleman of my recollections. I put the paper aside and began to form a cake of cornbread, satisfied that my own predictions had come true. I'd often imagined the futures of both Marshall Cogburn and Mr. LaBoeuf, though the Marshall's had always been somewhat vague in my mind; Mr. LaBoeuf, on the other hand, my imagination had always showered with quiet honors of the sort he had apparently attained. I let myself ponder his sadness for a moment. Like me, he was not given to a great deal of mirth, but even so, no man deserves such a grief. I wondered that he had not married again, for my mind recalled him as a pleasant-looking man with passable manners as long as he wasn't after one with a switch. Perhaps, like me, he had not found the time. I thought I ought to send a response, but as is my usual practice, I ate dinner and read a chapter of the Psalms before taking to bed, intending to pen the letter in the morning. During the night, I dreamed of Tom Chaney and awoke with satisfaction that he was dead.[Chapter 2] \"There's a delivery for you down at the station, LaBoeuf.\" The gray-haired man looked up from his pipe and wondered at the look of amusement on his old friend's face. \"Couldn't you have brought it here?\" These days, he liked to stay in his barn with his horses, Jack and Millie, and his pig, DeCourcy. He would not go into town without the most important of reasons. \"It's too big for that—needs a wagon.\" LaBoeuf began to wonder at Morgan's sanity. \"What is it, then? More mattress stuffing from my fool sister?\" \"Nope, ain't nothing like that. You gotta come and see.\" With a shake of the head, LaBoeuf tipped his cigar ash onto the barn floor and got to his feet. \"This had better be worth the trouble.\" Morgan didn't say a single word the whole way into town, for once. LaBoeuf was glad of the silence, but he couldn't understand why his friend had picked this one time to be quiet or why he kept looking over at him and laughing. He'd better tell Mabel, he figured. Maybe Morgan had been into the whiskey again. \"It's inside, waiting for you,\" Morgan finally said in a funny, strangled voice as LaBoeuf pulled the wagon up to the train depot. Wordlessly, he threw the reigns to his friend and jumped to the ground, proud of the fact that he felt no pain in spite of his age and years of hard work. He wondered if he were imagining the strange looks that greeted him instead of the usual pleasantries as he came to the entrance of the station and opened the large wooden door. Inside, he saw a group of people clustered around something he couldn't see. \"…and I assure you, Mr. LaBoeuf will see to it.\" The voice was unmistakable, both in tone and timbre. He pushed through the crowd. Mattie Ross stood beside the stationmaster's desk, wearing a black coat. Her hair was not plaited; it was twisted atop her head. \"Miss Ross.\" He had no idea what else to say. \"Good afternoon, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" She smiled. \"Please inform these people that we are to be married. I believe they think I am untruthful.\" LaBoeuf stared at her a moment, but it was not a very long one. \"Miss Ross and I are engaged,\" he heard himself utter, \"and furthermore, we are on our way to be married this afternoon.\" He held out an arm, and Mattie took it determinedly. He wondered if he should tell her he was pleased to see her, but of course, she already knew. \"I hope that my present course of action is as desirable to you as it is to me.\" She spoke quietly, for his ears only, and her voice was confident, but even so, he felt the tiniest tremble in the hand that rested on his arm, and he knew that he held the fate of her happiness. It was a strange thing, to finally have the power over Mattie Ross that he'd wanted at the very beginning. \"I assure you, ma'am, that I consider myself a fortunate man.\" Her relieved sigh was nearly imperceptible, and she did not pull away when he placed his hand atop hers. He thought that he would like to place his arm around her waist, but he would not dare to do so until after the service.[Chapter 3] It is a strange thing. I never had time to marry anyone else, but when it came to marrying Mr. LaBoeuf, I found that I had time aplenty.

Gone without a word. XX Marshall Cogburn had won the poker game, and earned his well played money and it was just enough money for him to get a room in the hotel. But for some odd reason, he didn't. Mattie herself didn't understand that at all after realizing that Cogburn was still living in the back of the Chinese Market. . . . As new morning had appeared over the horizon, the sun had shined like never before. It wasn't too hot and it wasn't too cool. It was perfect and the rays beaming downwards on Yell County caused the dirt road to glisten gold. \"Marshall Cogburn, I think you may be makin' a big mistake with those there bottles.\"Mattie let out words of positive advice, standing before him, as he lay comfortably and also very inebriated in his bed, with the curry powders and ducks, so many beer bottles lining around him, Mattie had to be careful where she stepped. He didn't bother to listen. He burped loudly, with his eye closed and lip curved into a sly smirk. \"Sister, this what I'm good at.\"he replied, with a fourth bottle gripped tightly by the neck in a rough, dry hand, and lips sucking around the mouth of the wet glass feverishly. Mattie swallowed, wondering how the glazed, swishing, liquid in that bottle in his hand, must've tasted like. It must taste good if Rooster was drinking so many of them, but then again, he was much older, and didn't mind what anything tasted like. Soon after standing there, watching him so quietly slurp down those clear bottles of brown liquor, Mattie was wanting to have a taste. :: :: A minute after finding her eyes on him, Rooster turned his head slowly with a cock, and squinted, letting the bottle slip from his moist lips, some excess booze drizzling down his chin, into his beard. His mouth hung open, and his brow furrowed. \"What is it girl?\"he jerked his arm upwards, and swipped it over his lips, in a rather swift motion, and layed it back limp on his belly, raising the empty bottle high in his hand. Mattie turned downwards, and smiled. Rooster smiled back, but most of it was caused by the alcohol injected into his system. \"You wanna' try?\"he arched his bushed brow high, and attempted to get his feet on the floor, but failed a few times before actually being successful. Mattie snickered a bit after watching him struggle to get to his feet, and nodded. \"Only a sip, please.\"she responded careful and quietly, as if she was nervious, like it being her first time of doing something so bad. Rooster nodded to her response, and burped once again, before standing up uncoordinated before her small form, and handing her a half-empty bottle brought up from the spot behind his boot. \"Here sister.\"he remarked, forcing it into her hand, as his larger hands overcame hers, wrapped tightly around the glass body. XX Mattie looked at their hands so closely together and pulled away instantaneously, eyes dialated, and palm sweaty after three seconds. She just couldn't quite understand where this was going, and wasn't going to stay and find out. \"I must depart, Marshall.\"Mattie didn't bother to look at the older man while talking, but with her back facing him instead. She was too nervious, and her emotions were running all over in an insane frenzy inside of her head. Rooster didn't say a word. He leaned downwards, putting a bit of strain on his back and calf muscles, put the bottle back down on the floor where it was before, with the other empty bottles behind his boots, and quickly extended a hand, wrapping his fingers forcefully around the flesh of her arm. Mattie's eyes bulged, and her face heated up as wild and as crazy as the burning heat outside, before being turned around on her heels, and facing the old fellow again. . . She swallowed softly as she could, and stared at him the same as she was being stared at by the Marshall. Wanting to speak to the child before she fled, the pinched fingers dug into her skin released slowly, and he found her eyes once again. \"You becareful sister. Ya' here?\"he told her in somewhat of a scold, with a deep growl in the back of his throat, before Mattie nodded slowly and left. But she had found herself stopping again: She stepped forward, one step at a time, and raised her hand up so very, very careful and shakey, letting it melt perfectly into the warm skin of Rooster's furry face, with a smile after he let her in, and put his own massive hand over hers. Just being this close, this intimate with Marshall Cogburn made her want to fall down and cry. She knew it wasn't a forever 'Goodbye'. They both knew they will meet up again, but whatever this was, it was so real. XXX XXX -finally leaving, her palm as warm as the skin on Rooster's face, she stepped outside, out into the warm, sweltering heat that was held high, taunting the folk of Dardanelle with it's intense rays that burned the skin of some. -and now that the day was turning quickly to midday, the temperature was changing with it, but a bit more than the day itself, if you were smart enough to realize. . . Turning into the Main Hotel, she ran into Ms. Louise, with a friendly smile and tight unbareable embrace with those stubby arms of hers. \"Oh hello Ms. Ross, I have gotten somethin' fer' you.\"the older woman shined so brightly, the smile over those rosey lips went literally from ear to ear, in a cracky reply, she rushed for the kitchen, disappearing from sight. Mattie looked around the corner, where she stood before the staircase, her hand clinging to the wall, in confusion. XX XX Before she turned back around, she was bumped by a young fellow. He wasn't exactly her age. In his twenties just by the look of his outfit and those crazy wind blown golden brown curls he possessed. \"Pardon me, Miss.\" he gave her a sweet smile, with a tip of his hat and those hypnotic blue eyes of his stealing away her only reason for standing there, right before him, without a smile, like his that greeted her. She was totally lost for words. E/N: Hm? I hope he turns out sweet;D and like so many enjoy Rooster/Mattie, I had to add a small, close interaction between the two. Yes Laboeuf wasn't in this one...your going to have to find out about Laboeuf and the new man!:D So excited! Part 2 that is coming, will be a bit sad. Relationships might be broken, but will soon heal like before...affairs, romantic bubble baths:D JK...but maybe...stay reading! I love you ALL![Chapter 2] . . Mattie stayed lost in the man's eyes, that seemed to pull at hers. -and that bright smile hadn't faded, not once. He was so handsome. Younger than Mr. Laboeuf by far, with a few crooked teeth here and there, but doesn't everyone have a set of chompers like that-and what's with the dirty whiskers growing on his well-molded face. He wasn't too dirty, but he did look like a farm boy. He wore a tight blue bandana around his neck, half buttoned up red flannel shirt with the sleeves rolled up to the nook of the elbows, leaving his forearms bare and covered in fuzzy goodness. The man moved uncomfortable in his dirty blue slacks and dirty buckskin chaps, and stuck his dirty thumbs into the belt loop, where a belt overcame. \"Missy? You alright?\"he removed his straw belted cowboy hat, revieling more crazy curls than before, that smile that was once there, gone. XX Mattie flushed suddenly, right when Ms. Louise returned from her long trip, with a sizzling basket full of butter biscuits, awaiting her. She turned on her heels, and met the woman's grey eyes, watching a finger slowly push up her bifocals resting just above the knotch of her nose. \"Here, Ms. Ross.\"she offered sweetly in that old southern voice, that seemed crackled in the back, as she handed the girl the basket, that felt a bit warm to the touch. Mattie swallowed and made a quick attempt to grabbing it without making a fool out of herself in front of this strange man, but she ended up doing what she hoped not too. She had suddenly dropped to her knees, and the basket fell landing over top of her lap, heating up her thighs terribly fast, with Ms. Louise and that man there beside her, trying to help her stand again. Once to the soles of her mucky boots, she turned downwards and felt her brows twitch all the same and stinging pain in her eyes. Ms. Louise brought a veined, wrinkled hand to the girl's middle back, and rubbed tenderly, while the man watched, feeling bad, when he took a first single look at that missing arm on her left side. ::: He found himself bitting back a few words, and put the hat held in both hands back on, and smiled at Ms. Louise. \"Pardon me, Ma'am. But may I have a few 'lone words with her?\"he asked in a strange tone of voice all out of the blue, bringing up a calloused hand for his face and scratched the whiskers, and the growing mustache that seemed to slightly tickle his nose. Ms. Louise removed her hand suspiciously, still looking at Mattie, who had raised her head up high, to find those eyes on her, and then at the taller man whom besided her. She had swallowed hard, and licked her lips afterwards, before giving him acceptance that he could. \"Yes you may, stranger. Just bring 'er back, she's a sweet child.\"she added soon after, the basket of biscuits held by the bow tied handles, with old eyes watching the young girl leave with him. XXXX XXXX She had a strange feeling in the pit of her stomach. It hurt, but as soon as she was out of sight, she went back into the Hotel, trying to forget it, unfortunately and the pain gone. XXXX XXXX This unfamiliar man had an arm around her, his heating palm hitting the middle of her back, where it seemed to heat up more than any other area of her body, both walking in step with eachother, and her brown eyes downcast at his moving boots, watching how the steeled points glistened back at her, the sunshine bouncing off the hot metal, into her eyes. \"What's yer' name, girl?\"the young fellow broke the silence between two strangers, and she looked back up in that instant, and moved away, pulling his arm from her. He stopped. \"I'm sorry.\"he added, removing his hat again, only to scratch his greasey curls. Greasey or not, he was still as handsome as he was when he had bumped into her back at the hotel, only a few minutes ago. Mattie breathed in sharp through her nose and let it back out, staring up at him. \"It's alright, I just don't understand. Who are you, Mister?\"she had asked the similar question he had asked just seconds ago but was interrupted, and now he moved both his arms, bent his elbows outwards, and placed each hand on those hips, with a loud gruff and a scuff of his torn boot. \"Well girl, I just asked you the same thin'. You 'pose to answer me first.\"he replied with the sun hitting his face at a bad moment, defining his angered expression more clearly, giving Mattie a couple seconds to think to herself. XX \"My name is Mattie. Mattie Ross, you?\"she had told him feeling a bit worried that she had even gave it to him, but it was too late now, and the sun had become more of a bother than this man had. He was hesitant for a few. The man turned his head to the right, to the left, and then finally to her, where she stood, tapping her foot impatiently at him. All of her patience was gone, and she was ready to ditch this fellow that she thought was a sweet, kind, good looking man. \"I'm sorry, maybe I should go-she was grabbed by the arm, and pulled near him. Her nose cringed at the slight disgusting smell crawling up her nose. It wasn't body odor, it was something more. Like tabacco, probably chew? It had to be chew. The smell of chew by itself was horrid, with maybe a mix of alcohol in there somewhere too. Giving it an extra tangy scent, which made it hard to be so close. But before she could even think about pulling free, he clenched his hat tight in a fist, at his side, and the other squeezed tighter to her arm he had in that painful grasp; causing a whimper to move passed her lips. \"Don't go. I don't like it when they go. Please. My name is Wyatt. Wyatt Johnston, miss.\" he finished in a hurry, and that's when she remembered. Smitty Johnston, Maggie Johnston...and-and Wyatt Johnston. Mr. Johnston had two children? She just wished hopefully that Wyatt wasn't like his pa'. Wyatt was too much of a sweet-looking man. Much better looking than his pa' ever had been or in that case, ever will be. So with that all sorted out, and thought through, Mattie swallowed the warm bubbly saliva she rolled around inside her mouth with her tongue, and he slowly let go, leaving red finger prints. \"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mattie Ross.\"he extended his hand out to her, and smiled nerviously. Mattie smiled back, looking down ready to shake it, when she had stopped herself, and found a rather perculiar scar across the base of his palm. It was only a crooked line, but something about it gave her strange thoughts. He was still patiently waiting, and ignored her wondering eyes that caught sight of the scar fairly quickly. \"Oh, yes it is, Wyatt Johnst-ston.\"Mattie reached out and put her hand in his, realizing how warm it was and dry, especially dirty, but that rarely bothered the young girl much. So they shook, and let go. XX XX \"It's gettn' rather late.\" he began, squinting as so, when pointing his head to the sky, and noticing the change from deep blue to bright sunshining yellow. \"You like somethin' to eat, Mattie?\"he let his head fall back down, and gave her all his attention, without a smile, but a sorta' squint, that reminded her so much of Mr. Laboeuf, when ever the sun shined in the right spot. She breathed in deep. \"Um, well I have to-she smiled weakly, stepping a foot backwards. He jerked. \"Oh, oh it's alright if you can't, I mean, we can some other time?\"he wondered, holding his hat in his hands, over his groin area, and staring hard at her with his squinted blue eyes. Mattie giggled girly, and nodded. \"Sure, Mr. Johnston. That would be nice.\"she answered him positively, with a sweet smile, scratching the nape of her neck from the bugging knats that already swarmed. He smiled bright, and put his hat back on. \"Great, Miss-Miss-he was confused already-hoping for her help. Mattie rolled her eyes with another smile that was hard to keep away. \"Mattie.\"she finished his words, and he smiled after her. Wyatt had tipped his hat to her, walking backwards as he did, nearly backing up into some older woman, who was just walking by, minding her own business, like she should. \"Well, I never!\"she bellowed at him, with jiggly rosey cheeks flapping with every movement, as she swung her bag, and aimed to hit him, but he continued to dodge, ever swing. \"Goodbye.\"he called out after Mattie, who continued to walk, but turned to see him, being attacked by some older woman. :: She didn't laugh, but she did grin. \"Bye... she acknowleged terribly soft, not even the biggest earred man could hear, even if that made a little bit of sense at all:/ E/N: Well there you go.

Hollis is sitting at her terminal watching for signs of intrusion into Terrain space. The night shift started off like any other night shift that she has handled sense she was assigned to HQ, boring and looking to be uneventful. She went to refill her mug with another round of coffee to keep her going through the rest of her shift when her monitor begins sounding an alert. Hollis hurries back to her monitor and studies the information scrolling past her eyes. \"Lt. Mason, I am receiving reports of a drifting shuttlecraft that has just crossed our border. Holographic identification suggests that is an older design of a shuttle that was equipped with a status pod for prolonged deep space exploration.\" \"Sgt. Hollis you know as well as I that status pods were never put onto shuttlecraft because they were deemed to be too big a drain on the main power core. Only our carriers and passenger liners had them installed.\" \"Yes sir, I know that sir however that is what this report is telling me. I'm unable to bet better information at this time however.\" \"Why is that?\" \"Sir, I have been locked out of the system. My screen has gone blank and isn't responding. I apparently do not have the security clearance to give you more information at this time.\" While Hollis had been reporting to him, Mason has come over to determine what the problem is and to make sure that someone isn't trying to hack into the I.F. mainframe. When he confirms the report for himself he enters his clearance code to access the rest of the report, only to find that he is unable to access the rest of the information. The message on the screen reads \"Insufficient security clearance. Alpha level 8 clearance or higher required.\" \"Sir, have you ever been denied access to information like this before?\" \"Yes, only once before Hollis. That was when I tried to get more information on the young admiral that went missing ten years ago. I saw this same message back then too. It's as if he ceased to exist after he went to Command School, when we were still at war with the Formics.\" \"If this information is being secured behind that same level of lockout, no one in this room has the clearance to get any further information about this intrusion into Terrain space. We have to call this in to the Colonel, which means that I have to go call him and wake him up. He's not going to be in a good mood over this, he likes his sleep.\" I.F.

He donned his uniform quickly and left his quarters to follow Mason back to the I.F. main building, hoping against hope that he might finally be able to repay the debt that he owed, redeem himself to the person that he wronged so many years ago and lift the shame that he carried from what he did to do to a very bright young man.

What if that someone loved you back as much if not more? Imagine you found that One. That One person you would spend the rest of your life with. Now imagine they were torn away from you between words. Just gone. No way of contacting them again. Never knowing if they've moved on from you or not. Now you know how Gem felt when Leo was torn away from her. Enjoy the tale of the two literally star-crossed lovers, in every sense of the term. She never really thought about it. How much she loved hearing his voice, seeing his face. Even just reading his words gave her so much pain now. She looked at them again on the screen. The letters became fuzzy, then blurry, then completely out of focus. Water rolled down her cheeks and splashed onto the platform screen of her visor. \"I could've sworn you were right here next to me. : )\" The last words she'd heard from him in over two months. What room did she have to complain though? Many other women and men had been torn apart by longer periods of time. Still. These past two and a half months have seemed like years. She couldn't hold on much longer. She was going to join the IF. She had to. There was no other choice. She had to know if he was okay. If he was still alive. 2 Years Later Still no word. But tomorrow Gem as getting shipped out to Eros where he was last established. She hoped he would still be there. He had to be okay, she didn't know what she would do if he was…. In just 24 approximate hours she could potentially be with him again. Please be okay. 24 Hours Later On the shuttle now, heading for the asteroid. There are no windows in the new pods since the last invasion of the Buggers. She could only hope all was good on the asteroid. She stepped off the last step with her mouth open in horrible awe. No. No, no, no, no, no. There's no way. They couldn't have kept this a secret. Not on this scale! No! It was impossible! The rock was in ruins. Fire everywhere, Buggers everywhere. Dead men and women, some children. The IF is just sending troops here to die! To keep the peace on Earth in death. Once deployed some people are never seen again and listed as so called \"Heroes\" but the reality is they are being slaughtered by the hundreds, and the Fleet wasn't doing ANYTHING about it! She ran around, desperately searching. Maybe he was okay, maybe he lasted. Then she saw it. A small, makeshift graveyard where the common cafeteria used to be. She walked the rows of the dead, firepower and enemies around her. She looked closely at the names on each grave, giving her respects to each and every one of them wile praying she wouldn't find his. She walked to the last one sighing with relief too early. Leo Scott Veraldi. She fell to her knees. The last one. She pounded her fists against the ground and screamed. The Last One! No! That moment of relief gone, flying away like her breath on the cold, space air. A shadow looms over her now. Too big to be human. Definitely Bugger. She turns, drawing her gun and aims it at that monster. That horrendous thing that probably had killed her one love. She fires one shot. It misses by an inch. The terrible thing looks at her and brings it's hand high above it's disgusting head. Then….. Blackness. ","Summary":" What if you met someone you really, really loved them.

Wiggin has been seen. He left Command School after he was tricked into what he viewed as an act of genocide of the Formic species. What very few people knew was that he had taken the only surviving Queen with him in an attempt to find a new home for the species to come back from the brink of total annihilation. Now after almost a decade has passed, the International Fleet third night watch shift begins to detect an I.F. shuttle entering the Solar system at the time of 0214(2:14am). Sgt. Dap said, \"I want a positive identification on that shuttle now!\" The other officer on duty started at the sergeant's harsh command and hurried to follow it, and soon came back with a report saying, \"Sir, we are not able to raise the shuttle it's just outside of comms range.\" \"Can we confirm that it is even a shuttle at all?!\" \"Thirty seconds until solid comms lock, Sir.\" As the duty officers were trying to establish communications with the as yet unidentified object, another transmission was coming in. \"I.F. Headquarters, this is Commander Petra Arkanian of the carrier Night Star. We have identified the incoming object as an I.F. personal shuttlecraft. It is not answering hails due to a damaged transceiver array. We have launched rescue craft to assess the situation, stand-by for I.D. confirmation.\" After a minute had gone by without further contact, Dap said, \"Commander, is there a problem? Have you made contact with the shuttle and determined the status of the occupant?\" It took another minute for Petra to answer however, when she did, it shocked everyone on both the Night Star's bridge but most of all Sgt. Dap could not believe his ears. \"Yes Headquarters, we have made contact with the shuttle. Its occupant is alive and his stasis pod is functioning normally. Sgt. Dap you should clear the room, now. \" Dap recognized the tone of her voice as well as the fact that she had a look of total disbelief on her face. \"Clear the room and secure this frequency.\" As soon as the room cleared and the door locked Dap said, \"Alright Petra, please tell me what you can. The last time that I say you like this was when Wiggin completed his final mission as a Commander.\" The look on Petra's face was momentarily laced with anger at the reminder of her own part in that mission before she was able to calm herself again. \"Dap, the shuttlecraft does belong to the I.F. however, this is his shuttle.

Once they were inside the one large, half moon shaped room that had a ceiling that is covered with various glass colored bottles that either had flowers or candles lit in them as the rest of the room had various sized soft cushioned furniture ranging from couches to chairs all over the place with random placed folded out walls to give a sense of privacy. Prin said, \"Did you buy those clothes?\", Carol said, \"No, I made them myself.\", Prin said, \"Groovy! Now lets do your hair and I'll show you some of my clothes that I am getting rid of and see if you look groovy in them as well!\", Carol tried on various hippe/loose clothing while one of Prin's friends took pictures of her. After trying on various shirts, pants, etc. they decided to go out to a local arcade and as they hung out Carol grew a liking to one of Prin's boy friends who introduced himself as Alex. They played many arcade games together as Carol told him she never played an arcade game before and she enjoyed herself while playing with him. They went back to their hangout and Carol tried on some more clothes until Prin turned on the jukebox and \"Season of the Witch\" by Donovan played and some of them began dancing while others smoked as they sat and watched and Carol decided to join in and danced as well. She then noticed Alex is watching her intently and she moved in his direction and sat on his lap as he looked up at her and she moved her hips and upper body over him as she continued to dance and ran her hands over his shoulders, chest and arms as the others watched (but looked high) till Carol flopped down on her back onto the couch resting her legs and feet on Alex's lap. She closed her eyes and Alex began massaging her stocking feet and legs and Carol moaned with pleasure and said, \"Dude, you got good hands.\", Alex said, \"I work at a massage parlor. Maybe you could come by sometime.\", Carol replied, \"Maybe.\", and the others moved away to the other side of The Hangout leaving Alex and Carol alone. She looked up as they were whispering to each other and she said, \"Where are they going?\", Alex replied, \"I guess they want to leave us alone. Finally.\", Carol looked up interested and said, \"Why?\", Alex said, \"I usually prefer to be by myself.\", Carol said, \"I usually do too. Except this time.\", they looked at each other and Carol grabbed Alex behind the neck and she sat up and kissed him. Alex held her as well and he began kissing deeply till Carol is on her back and they made love. Carol exited the car as they dropped her back home and she entered the estate to see it is dark and quiet. She took a few steps till a voice said behind her (dull), \"Did you had a good time?\", and Carol swung around in shock till she saw Crow was standing right behind her and she sighed in relief and kicked him on the right knee cap and said in an angry voice, \"Yes I did! Stop creeping me up like that!\", and Crow stood there (with his face still hidden) unflinched by her kick and he said, \"Sorry.\", Carol replied still frustrated, \"Okay whatever, just don't do it again. Yes, I did had a good time, the best in awhile.\", she then started her way upstairs and noticed Crow wasn't following and she turned back and said, \"Well are you going to come and get yours or are you going to stand there!\", before she knew it she was swooped up and there was a rush of air before she fell back on the bed and Crow began furiously kissing her and Carol replied in kind as they both had rough sex. When she went out again the next night with her friends they parked over a cliff looking over the ocean and as her friends went out into the dark forest she was left alone with Alex. Carol turned to Alex and said, \"So what do yOU!\", she yelled in surprise as Alex leaned down over her lap and started making love to her when Carol suddenly grabbed a handful of hair on the back of his head and yanked him up to where Alex slammed his back up against the door on his driver side and he yelled, \"WHAT THE HELL BRO?\", Carol said, \"I'm not a melodramatic so I'm just going to say we can't do this anymore.\", Alex said, \"Why not? Last night you loved it!\", Carol said, \"Alex you know why. I'm married.\", Alex said, \"We all know that, but ever since you are away from him you have been very happy! We are meant to be together!\", Carol said, \"You're right on some aspects but he really does love me! It's just he has a different way of showing it.\", Alex said, \"All right then explain to me why before we hang out you only go to the grocery stare and back and no where else and avoid long conversations with other people?\", Carol replied, \"Alex I know you all think you know me but in reality you don't!\", Alex said, \"Then tell me!\", Carol replied, \"I can't!\", Alex they yelled, \"THEN YOU ARE JUST MAKING EXCUSES!\", and he tried to kiss her but Carol pushed him away and she yelled, \"NO!\", then he threw himself on top of her and tried to take her clothes when suddenly she snarled and she kicked Alex back where he ended up smashing the driver side door open and he fell on his back to the ground. The others came running back and saw Carol with her clothes either torn or stretched and they saw Alex on the ground and Prin said, \"Dude what the f?\", Alex said, \"She is confused, I was just trying to help her!\", one of Prin's friends said, \"You have a sick way of showing it!\", Prin pulled out her cell phone and said, \"I'll get her a cab. We need to talk!\", and she began dialing. The front door opened and Carol walked inside holding her top close when she saw Crow standing on top of the stairs looking down at her with his face hidden and he said in a monotone voice, \"Did he rape you?\", Carol first looked embarrassed but then frustrated and she said, \"Don't worry, I'll take care of him.\", Crow said, \"I assure you I...\", Carol yelled back, \"I SAID I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM!\", and she stormed up the stairs ignoring his hidden gaze as she walked past him and slammed the door close in their bedroom. Both Karl and Abby came out looking shocked and Karl said, \"Is she okay?\", Crow replied, \"I believe she will be soon.\", and as he turned away there was a sound of a window being opened in their bedroom. Alex was lying back in bed, sleeping, and did not hear the window in his bedroom open and a female in the shadows jumped in so lightly there was no sound and climbed on top of the bed casting a shadow over Alex's face and the top of his bed and she said, \"I want you to see who I really am.\", and Alex woke up in a startled, looked up and saw Carol in a form of a werewolf with her yellow eyes shinning brightly in the dark bedroom staring down at Alex. He looked terrified and was about to scream till Carol grabbed his throat with her clawed left hand and she snarled up close to his face. Carol said, \"I would have killed you about now.\", she then sniffed and looked down and noticed he peed his pants as he looked like he is about to whimper and Carol said, \"You fucking cry baby. You better not tell anyone about what I am or else next time I am going to chew your face off. Got it?\", he nodded and with quick, quiet cat like reflexes she let go of his neck and jumped out the window. Alex pulled the covers up close to him as he pulled out his lighter and a spray can and held them up as he continued to look at the window seeing the full moon with a wolf howl in the distance. Once she got back she noticed the house is dark but she heard the sound of \"Starman\" by David Bowie playing upstairs. She walked up quietly and when she opened the bedroom door she noticed Crow was laying back in bed looking straight at her and he said, \"Did he learn his lesson?\", Carol closed the door and changed into her black robe and said, \"Yes. He also peed in his pants which makes it more than satisfactory.\", she then got in bed and laid on top of Crow and held in for comfort as she purred and he stroke her hair as his eyes glistened in the moon light showing his chalk white face and he smiled showing his fangs protruding from his lips. She looked up and saw his face and fangs and she leapt back with shock and fear near the door. Carol yelled, \"WHAT THE FUCK!\", Crow looked at her puzzled and worried and said, \"What is it?\", Carol yelled back and pointed at his fangs, \"THOSE!\", Crow felt his face and then he sighed and said, \"Carol I can explain.\", Carol yelled, \"You better!\", Crow said, \"You know I spend my time helping Abby overcome her hunger for human blood right?\", Carol said, \"Yeah?', Crow said, \"Well...\", the full moon then shinned brightly through the window behind him and Carol (not minding the moon) said, \"No. No!\", and she lowered her head as she shivered and Crow said, \"I was shocked as you are. I thought it would be impossible since I am a cyborg, but...my synthetic skin, apparently, also affects my systems in a way that I do turn into a vampire. I am still trying to figure out how this is possible but so far I can't find any simple explanation.\", Carol is moaning and making low throat growls and Crow said, \"Do you understand?\", Carol looked up and revealed she transformed into a werewolf and she growled at him and said, \"Yeah I get it, bloodsucker.\", Crow then revealed his fangs and made a hissing sound while Carol revealed her fangs and roared before she jumped on top of him and they began kissing hard and groped each other hard with their claws. Carol knocked Crow's hand away and end up hitting the music box and the song \"You're the First, the Last, My Everything.\" by Barry White played. They both flew in the air as Carol slammed her back up against the wall knocking posters and a lamp down as Carol gasped and Crow kissed roughly down her neck as he clawed her back and sides (as Carol is too) and suddenly Crow is thrown on his back on the floor as Carol is on top of him and she roared before she shoved her mouth into his and began kissing hard. Crow then grabbed the back of her head and rolled her on her back and kissed hard as well as he began clawing/tearing her night gown. Abby and Karl looked outside their room as they heard the noise and Karl looked at her puzzled while Abby looked back at him smiling and he said, \"What's happening?\", and Abby giggled and said, \"I think it's better if I show you.\", and they closed their bedroom door. Once Ender is considered fit for full duty he left his quarters and began making his rounds in Olympus's barracks and the physical training room around the ring and his and Petra's quarters and noticed the students are a lot more relaxed. He then went back to his quarters and heard a low hum sound and he opened his locker and one of the drawers to see a small cocoon shaped object covered in a thick blanket that glowed orange. Ender rubbed the covered cocoon and a soothing male voice said, \"I see you are still finding a home for the Hive Queen.\", Ender turned back shocked and saw Khan standing by the doorway and Ender said, \"How do you know?\", Khan replied, \"I read the report from the transport ship's computer database when you went outside the base into one of the Formic ruins and came back carrying something small, plus passing security checkpoints as you boarded the Battle School also found the same object but they have detected life. I told them to let it on board as I know it means so much to you.\", Ender relaxed and said, \"It does. I am still searching, hoping to repopulate a species I nearly completely destroyed.\", Khan said, \"The way you are progressing you will be given a ship under your own command so you can continue your search. I really came by here though to tell you those people that were on board the transport ship have been cleared and are now heading this way to join the rest of your crew and other students to undergo further training. I even heard this Julian Delphiki III insists on joining your army.\", Ender replied, \"Then I would like to meet him once he arrives.\", Khan said, \"Excellent. This should be very interesting, I hope your own people can be as formidable as you or Petra when they begin their training.\", and he left leaving Ender pondering his thoughts wondering when they arrive if they will be happy to see Ender or be angry at him for desertion and repopulating a species that nearly whipped out his home world. The next morning a ringing sound woke Ender up and he looked to his right to see a rolled up piece of paper in the mail tube. He opened and read it silently when Petra stirred next to him under the covers as she held him and said tiredly, \"What is it?\", Ender replied, \"It seems those children on the transport are going to be in their own launch group and not be integrated with the rest of the armies in the ship.\", Petra said tiredly, \"At least they will be together. Let's sleep...\", the digital alarm clock went off and Petra grunted with frustration as they slowly got up. Ender finished dressing and opened the door to see Julian standing right in front of him and Ender stumbled back a little startled at first and then he said, \"What do you want launchy?\", Julian said, \"The name's Julius Delphiki.\", there was a short pause and Ender said, \"Sir.\", Julius said sarcastically, \"Sir. I know you have the power to object the Captain's decision and allow us to join other armies and I can be the best man you've got, sir.\", Ender stared down at him and said, \"If I had the power why should you join my army?\", Julius stared up at him unwatered and said, \"You know why, sir. I can lead a platoon on my own and train them so you can use us to do whatever special mission you wish.\", Ender said, \"Knowing what to do with them is easy (if you can manage), but training them and getting them to do whatever you want is another. Plus you are a launch so who would want to follow you anyway?\", Julius replied, \"I will earn their respect sir.\", Ender said, \"You, a launchy, will earn their respect?\", Julius said, \"I just told you, sir.\", Ender then shoved him up against the pillar without losing his temper but his voice showed his aggravation as he said, \"Listen smart mouth! You have not fought in the Battle Dome nor set foot in one and you still have to prove that you are a good soldier and you can follow orders without talking back to your superiors.\", Julius just smiled and said, \"Yes sir, and if I am in your army I will accomplish all that when you give me the chance.\", they stared at each other silently as Julius still smirked at Ender till Ender let Julius go and said, \"I will consider it. That is all launchy!\", Julius left and Petra stood next to Ender and said, \"Do you think it is wise Ender?\", Ender replied, \"We'll see.\", and he left with his desk as Petra led Olympus to their classes. The next day Khan called Olympus Army to the Battle Dome and Ender led his army up the ladder and saw Julius is standing next to Khan as Ender's army formed up. Khan said, \"Good morning to you all. This is Julius Delphiki III and he will be joining your army.\", Julius looked at everyone as if he was inspecting them as he stood next to Khan and Khan continued, \"This maybe against protocol but on the authority given by the Captain, Mr. Delphiki will be leading platoon B.\", they all looked confused but they remained at attention trying to not break ranks. Khan then held up a metal rod that is the size of his hand with a single switch and he pressed it to reveal a short dark blue glow beam coming out of the top before pressing the button again and it vanished and he said, \"This device is now part of your training and this will simulate a combat knife when you fight hand to hand.\", he handed it to Julius and ordered him to fall in and he told them that the stick (as it is called) acts the same way as their pistol and he expects them to all be experts. He hands a box of the same sticks to Ender before he leaves and Ender ordered his army around and showed them some techniques to weld a knife before they began practicing on one another. There was a loud report of a rifle behind a large house and Jen woke up with a start and when she looked outside and saw it is daylight she made an irritated sigh and slumped back on the bed and said, \"You got to be kidding me.\", and she got up to start getting dressed. Out in the back, beneath an open patio, Gabriel pulled back the bolt of his single shot rifle letting out the shell before he reloaded and aimed back at the target range (where target rabbit shaped plates popped up from hiding) when Jen yelled out, \"IT'S 8 IN THE MORNING MORON!\",Gabriel sighed and said, \"Then you should wear ear plugs!\", Jen yelled back, \"I told you the last time! Ear plugs don't do crap with your loud shooting just beneath my bedroom!\", Gabriel looked irritated as he decided to pull out a scoped rifle instead and Jen yelled out again, \"You better not be changing to a higher caliber rifle!\", Gabriel breathed, \"Yes I am wrench.\", and he pulled back the bolt hard and shoved the bullet in before locking the bolt furiously and aimed his rifle looking through the scope when Jen yelled out, \"WHAT DID YOU SAY?\", and Gabriel looked furious as he looked down the scope at the target. Just as he was about to pull the trigger a laser beam blew through the lens of the scope and hit right at the target causing the target to explode. Gabriel yelped with shock and dropped the rifle as he looked at once was his target and back at his rifle that had smoke coming out of the front of the scope. Gabriel breathed, \"What is this?\", Jen yelled, \"Did you fire a laser?\", Gabriel quickly think and said, \"Unintentional! I think I will take up your offer and stop!\", Jen yelled back, \"Thank fucking god!\", Gabriel sighed with irritation and he snatched up his rifle and shoved it back in its cradle only when he did, the rifle smashed to pieces and left a hole in the wooden wall. Gabriel pulled his hand back, shocked, and when he looked at his hand he saw he has no bruises or cut marks. He looked back at the pieces of the rifle, the hole in the wall and down at the target range and he said to himself, \"I think now is the best time for a checkup.\", and he quickly put the pieces and debris in the garbage and cleaned the casings from the floor before heading inside. After just two days of classes and practices in the Battle Dome Michael walked to the barracks and saw Julius was sitting in his bunk alone as the rest of the students engaged in talk at various parts as if to isolate Julius and Ender said, \"Delphiki!\", Julius stood at attention and Ender said, \"My quarters if you please!\", and Julius went to Ender's quarters as Ender followed before the hatch closed behind him and Ender said, \"Well Julius how does it feel having your own toon?\", Julius remained at attention and said, \"Fine sir.\", Ender said, \"At ease Julius, sit down.\", and Julius sat on Ender's bed as Ender sat at his desk and said, \"Having any difficulty adjusting to the students in your platoon?\", Julius replied, \"Nothing I can't handle.\", Ender said, \"I can see that. Especially in all the practices your platoon is the best of the rest in Olympus.\", Ender waited for a response but Julius just kept looking at him and Ender said, \"Julius I have a record of you before you joined us and even though I didn't exactly live in the lifestyle you had before, I can understand it is hard to trust people even when you are living in the streets and ran away from home.\", Julius laughed as Ender kept from showing his puzzlement and Julius said, \"Ran away from home? You really think I can be that stupid and give up a decent life just to survive on the streets and hoping no one kills me in the middle of the night?\", Ender said, \"No. I heard you are spending most of your free time reading military history and strategy like Vauban.\", Julius said, \"That's correct. So?\", Ender said, \"How do fortifications even benefit space battles when it is impossible?\", Julius explained to Ender about defenses even using other planets as a means for early detection and defending a single most important planet if the right emplacements are built to either repeal or destroy enemy ships by firing from the planet's surface. Ender said, \"Interesting. Did you even bother to talk to one of your fellow students about this?\", Julius replied, \"Joachim.\", Ender said, \"What did he say?\", Julius replied, \"He approved. As a matter of fact he finds my military strategies and ideas interesting.\", Ender said, \"Good, then I know Olympus is in good hands with you and Joachim as I will be leaving in a few days.\", Julius looked a little surprised and said, \"What do you mean? We still haven't tested our hand to hand combat skills in any actual battles yet!\", Ender put his right hand on Julius's shoulder and said, \"Don't worry, I have full confidence in you to lead your platoon and eventually an army. Plus, we still have one battle before I leave and I know you will not let me down.\", Julius said, \"Sir you know there are commanders here that are not going to let you leave here in one piece! Maybe even try to kill you!\", Ender replied, \"I like to see them try Julius.\", Julius said, \"At least allow two of us to guard you and Petra's quarters or have one of us follow you wherever you go.\", Ender replied, \"Denied. You are dismissed Julius.\", Julius stood up and after he paid his respects he left Ender's quarters looking both frustrated and angry as Julius believed Ender is not taking the matter seriously. They were all surprised by the next two days they had four battles and each one lasted longer than their previous battles before as the commanders of the opposing armies tried to prolong the battles in an attempt to wear out Olympus during the battles or before the next one as if the commanders of the other armies are working together in order to defeat Olympus or Ender. After the last battle they jogged back to their barracks after they won against Lizard Army and Ender had Julius to lead the army back to their barracks and as they jogged Petra yelped in pain and Ender stopped as the army kept going as he asked Petra what's wrong as she rubbed her calf. As Julius lead the army back he noticed a large group of students from various armies stood in front of them and he immediately turned and called the rest of the army to hold their position and cover Ender and Petra. Ender did not hear the commotion as he nursed Petra's sprained calf when suddenly a group of students appeared from the Game Room and jumped both Ender and Petra before they could react and they were hauled away gagged. One of the students in Olympus yelled out, \"THEY GOT OUR COMMANDERS!\", and Julius immediately ran at the back of the army shoving anyone in his path aside leaving Joachim behind to command the army. Julius franticly looked around and even called out Ender's name till he heard a voice down the corridor to his left saying, \"Pick up their legs! Move it!\", Julius turned and saw a group of students, including their leader Fong, carrying Ender and Petra away bounded and gaged and he ran after them till the entrance to Lizard Army closed right in front of him. He repeatedly pushed the button to open the door only for the screen to read \"SEALED\", and Julius looked around till he looked back at the Game Room and smiled. Fong set the gravity on in the Battle Dome and his students carried Ender and Petra into the Dome and forced them kneeling on the floor. Fong said, \"Do you know what happens when you set the pistol to maximum setting and fired at close range without wearing a suit?\", Petra looked up terrified while Ender looked up in anger and Fong said, \"It's like being struck by lightning.\", he aimed at Petra and she started to struggle under one of the students grips only not being able to budge under his muscle strong hands and Fong laughed as Ender moaned loudly in anger and Fong said, \"I am not going to kill you Ender. We want you to know what it feels like when something so precious to you is hurt badly or worse! Like our pride and honor!\", Ender moaned loudly and moved to get in Petra's way as if to point the gun at him, but Fong pistol whipped him knocking Ender to the deck and is held down as Fong pointed the pistol directly at Petra's head as she looked down at Ender with tears running down her face. A voice yelled out, \"HEY ASSHOLE!\", Fong and the others looked up and saw Julius at the side of the dome on the platform going all the way around the dome and holding a deadline. Fong yelled out, \"You are going to learn your place you little shit!\", at that moment students appeared on the stars floating in the dome surrounding Julius and Fong yelled out, \"GET HIM!\", the students and commanders from the nearest stars either jumped on the catwalk or started shooting at Julius as he dodged them as he quickly kicked and punched the others on the catwalk knocking them back or throwing them off the catwalk as they screamed and fell on the deck with a loud thud and even smashed through the glass shielding on a helmet on one of the student's as Julius punched him in the face and the student fell back dazed and unable to get up. He then grabbed hold of the deadline and he jumped over a few yards to the nearest star and kicked a student in the midsection knocking him off as he fell far down to the deck with a loud pop noise. In one yank Julius tore the deadline from its cradle on the catwalk and began using it as a whip. As he swung the deadline he struck other students and commanders knocking them off the nearby stars as the rest took cover. He continued whipping the deadline around as he struck a student on the side of his helmet and smashed it to pieces before shedding off the skin on his cheek and falling off the star to land on his head and hitting others that tore chunks off their normal suits and tearing some of the flesh off their skins before they were either knocked back or fell to the deck below with either repeated thumping or popping noises as their bodies struck while Ender, Petra and the others watched in horror. He then pulled out his pistol and fired at the students making them freeze but so doing they fell unable to move as they screamed, even as one student fell and smashed his head on the deck sending a large blood splatter that reached Petra's knees. The students began zeroing in on Julius and he whipped his deadline as it wrapped around another student's neck, as he clawed and began choking, and Julius swung to another star kicking a decorated commander off in the face sending out a splash of blood before Julius landed and the student (that had the deadline wrapped around his neck) fell far down to the deck below. Fong seethed in anger and he pulled Petra where he pointed the pistol at the back of her head making her face Ender as Ender was just able to pull his gag off and he yelled, \"FONG LET HER GO! This is between you and me!\", Fong said, \"I will when she's dead! You...\", a student jumped behind Fong as a star struck him and knocked both him and Fong down making Fong firing his pistol and just singing the hair on the left side of Petra's face as the shot hit the deck. Julius then cast the deadline away and jumped high off the star firing a shot to his right at a student trying to aim at him (hitting the student through the helmet) and landed hard on the deck as he slid on his feet in the kneeling position. As he slid he tore off a metal shard on the deck and struck a student in the throat as he grasped the shard with blood running down his chest and hands. Julius then pulled out his stick as a student tackled him in the front and as he tried to choke him Julius engaged the stick and shoved the beam through the face plate and part of the beam exited at the back of his head. More students ran up to him and Julius sliced the Achilles tendons on the two and stabbed one through the chest and another down his back as they both yelped/screamed in pain. Another started to grab Julius from behind, but Julius swung around and stabbed the stick through Sparrow Army's commander's head into his right temple. Julius yanked his stick out as the rest of the students stood back and Julius put his stick away as he aimed his pistol at Fong and walked up briskly towards him. The hatch opened on the deck and a security guard appeared with his rifle raised and he yelled, \"Put the gu...\", but Julius shot the rifle from the guard's hands as he continued towards Fong as Fong yanked Petra back to her knees and rested the barrel of the pistol at her left temple as Julius stopped right in front of him. Fong yelled in anger, \"WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU?\", Julius replied calmly as he stared down at Fong, \"Let her go.\", Fong yelled back, \"FUCK Y...\", but Julius fired and hit Fong's left hand knocking the pistol off his grip as he screamed and Petra was able to break free from his grip. Fong kneeled as he was shot and he saw that his left hand is burnt black and he held it as he looked in shock and screamed in pain. Julius then grabbed Fong by the throat with his right hand and lifted him up in the air (even though Fong is twice his size) as Fong looked down at him shocked as he tried to break Julius's grip from choking him but to no avail. At this point Khan and the other teachers and students arrived and they all looked around in shock as they saw the students either stumbling to get up, moaning in pain, while the rest remained on the deck either unconscious or dead. Julius kept looking up at Fong as he is choking him and made a villainous grin when Ender yelled, \"JULIUS STOP!\", Julius then looked at Ender and saw him kneeling next to Petra as she held her left temple and looked up at Julius with tears still stained on her face. Julius turned back on Fong with a grim look on his face and he dropped Fong down as Fong struggle to regain his breath. Fong looked up at Julius with a look of anger and he said, \"You...\", but as he looked up Julius kicked him squarely in the face, knocking him out. The next day Ender walked into the barracks where everyone was gone except Julius as he lounged in his bunk when Ender approached. When Julius looked up he snapped to attention in his undergarments and Ender replied, \"Relax Julius.\", and Julius sat back in his bed while Ender sat across from him. Ender said, \"How are you doing Julius?\", Julius replied, \"Confined to the barracks is a walk in the park for me.\", Ender said, \"Don't worry, this is only to keep others from trying to hurt you and for their safety as well.\", Julius replied, \"I can take care of myself. Where is Ms. Arkanian?\", Ender replied, \"She's busy debriefing Joachim when he takes over. After what happened in the Dome the Captain has denied you promotion to being Joachim's second in command, but me and Petra thank you for saving us.\", Julius said, \"You don't need to thank me. Anyone in our army could have done the same, I just happen to react faster.\", Ender said, \"Before we leave is there anything you want?\", Julius replied, \"No, both you and Petra have done enough for me. Thank You for taking me in and teaching me. Its great that after all we've been through, I am your friend.\", Ender grabbed Julius's left hand with both his hands and said, \"You don't need to thank us Julius, the power is within you. My dear friend Bean will also be proud of what you have accomplished. I hope one day we meet each other again under a command of my own someday and take you under my wing like I did with your older brother.\", Julius broke the hand shake and out of bed to give Ender a big hug as they held onto each other as if they are brothers. Back on Mab-Bu, Chloe wore her pink robe and laid next to Michael as they kissed and embraced each other. Michael caressed his wife's face as she looked at him as she smiled and Michael said, \"God you're beautiful.\" Chloe giggled and said, \"You know that's the fifth time you said it.\", Michael said, \"I know. I just love saying that every time I look at your amazing face.\", Chloe blushed and said, \"Awww.\", and they kissed before Chloe hopped out of bed and said, \"Come on, lets go to the fair!\", Michael sighed and said, \"Really?\", Chloe said, \"Yes do fuss! I don't want to spend our entire time in bed! Come on!\", and she grabbed her pillow as she was dressing and threw it at him and hit his head as he failed to catch it and he said, \"Okay, okay!\", and moved out of bed tiredly. As they enjoyed themselves at the fair they went on the Ferris wheel and they watched the sights as they went up when all of the sudden the wheel stopped and they heard commotion at the bottom as they looked down. Chloe looked a little shocked and said, \"Are you kidding me!\", Michael looked down over her shoulder and saw the commotion as well and made a frown face and said, \"Hmm, looks like the power is out.\", Chloe looked back at him and said, \"Great, now what are we going to do?\", Michael scratched his chin and looked up as if he is thinking (sarcastically) and said, \"Gosh, I don't know.\", she first looked puzzled and then her face lit up in shock and said, \"Wait a minute! You set this up, didn't you?\", and Michael smirked and said, \"What if I say yes?\", she glared at him and Michael looked a little worried till she leapt onto his arms and lap and said, \"I say that is a pretty ingenious idea.\", and they both kissed passionately. Later, the power came back on and when the top car reached the bottom and the doors opened Michael and Chloe stepped out and the operator said, \"I'm sorry for the power outage sir and ma'm!\", Chloe said, \"Don't worry, we still had a good time.\", and both Chloe and Micheal left smiling. When Ender and Petra arrived on the surface and to their lodge they noticed it is snowing. Once they left the shuttle and Ender waved the pilot off they quickly put their bags inside and changed into warmer (thick) clothing and they went back outside. Petra was out the door first and she immediately went into the field of snow in front of the lodge and started gathering a large pile when suddenly a snowball hit her in the back of the head knocking her black stocking cap off. She looked in shock as Ender said, \"Ohhh!\", Petra turned and started to move towards him as she said, \"Ender whAT!\", and she slipped and fell back hitting the pile of snow she started on. Ender laughed so hard he was almost down to his knees as Petra struggled to get up while at the same time she grabbed a mitten full of snow and she threw it at Ender hitting him in the chest. She laughed and Ender grabbed another handful of snow but Petra quickly dodged behind the left side of the stairs leading up to the lodge while Ender dodged to the right and they threw snowballs at each other as they laughed. Ender then runs from cover and charges at Petra as she runs away only to be tackled from behind into the snowy ground and turns over with Ender sitting on top of her and they both laughed. They smiled at each other till Ender leaned down and began kissing her. They both embraced each other as they continued to kiss, but more passionately, till Petra shoved Ender back hard and he fell on his back into the snow as Petra stood above him as she laughed and said, \"Race you inside!\", and Ender gave chase as they both ran inside the lodge. The song \"Hot Stuff\" by Donna Summer played loudly in the house Michael and Chloe are staying and Chloe swung her blonde hair around as she danced and singed in the kitchen cooking using a large spoon as a microphone. When Michael entered she pointed at him as she sang \"I need your hot stuff!\" and she shook her hips as Michael smirked and then began to dance as well till they heard a growing sound of a shuttle approaching and they both stopped as Michael looked outside and saw the lights heading to the front of the house. When he opened the front door with a phaser behind his back he saw a Type 9A shuttle land with lights shinning right at him. He raised his hand to temporarily cover his eyes till his lens adjust and a voice said, \"Is Captain Valkyrie here?\", Michael said, \"Yes, who are you?\", when his eyes adjusted he saw a Centaurian in a yellow Starfleet uniform and he said, \"Sir we're sorry to drop in like this but I have orders from my captain to come get you! We tried hailing you on your communicator but it seems that it maybe malfunctioning.\", Michael replied, \"That's because I'm on vacation. Why does your captain want me?\", the Starfleet officer said, \"I'm sent here by Captain Kirk because this is most urgent! He wants you to contact him immediately and we already have communications setup inside the shuttlecraft as he is waiting!\", the Starfleet officer guided Michael to the shuttlecraft and hailed the Enterprise before he and another crewman stepped out and Kirk filled the screen. Kirk said, \"Hi Michael, how is your leave going?\", Michael said, \"Fine till now. What's so important that you decided to contact me on my leave?\", Kirk said, \"Sorry that my crew disturbed you but you have been called to escort one of our starships to Earth to drop off very sensitive material. According to command due to your record you and your ship are the best candidates to guard this starship.\", Michael looked a little surprised and said, \"Me? Why not you? Did you piss off Starfleet again?\", Kirk laughed and said, \"No I didn't! We are also on a very important mission that we will be too far from the Mutara Sector.\", Michael looked puzzled and said, \"Mutara Sector? That seems pretty far. What is the ship and it's location?\", Kirk said, \"You will be escorting one of our newest frigates, the USS Reliant, from Regula 1 and two other starships will be there to assist you. The USS Ricardo and the USS Verdun.\", Michael looked even more puzzled and said, \"Two more starships! What is so important about this cargo?\", Kirk said, \"Michael, the Genesis Device, it's completed.\", Michael looked shocked and said, \"Shut, up! Really?\", Kirk said, \"Yeap! Looks like Carol is also a miracle worker! The Federation wants to bring the device to Earth where it will be safe. The last thing we want is the Klingons to get their hands on it.\", Michael said, \"I'll call the rest...\", Kirk intervened, \"We already notified Zhargosia Command and they are contacting the rest of your crew as we speak. Zhargosia wants me to tell you that they are also sending Joachim and Julius Delphiki to join you as well to know what it is like being onboard a starship. Personally I think this is a bad idea because I dealt with superhuman's before and it did not turn out so well.\", Michael said, \"Don't worry, they have been checked out before going to the Battle School Ship and I had a third party look into them as well and they are both fine. They aren't going to turn out like Khan or any of his people, don't worry.\", Kirk waved it off and said, \"Anyway, it's going to be a walk in the park and you will be back to finish your leave in no time.\", Michael said, \"Well Jim, then it looks like I'm going to take your word for it.\", they both said their goodbyes and Michael stepped outside to see Crow, Carol, Gabriel, Jen, Ender, Petra, Arsenal, Carrie, Abby, Karl and Chloe standing outside in various forms of fashion and some of them looked stunned. Crow was the first one to speak and said, \"What the hell is this?\", Gabriel said, \"I was just about to say the same thing. First I get a call that we are recalled back to the Challenger and me and Jen just finished packing when the next thing I know I was beamed here.\", Michael shook his head as he smiled and said, \"I guess we are needed that badly.\", he looked at Crow, then Carol, Abby and Karl and said, \"You do not have to come. Under certain circumstances and what you have been through I believe you have done enough.\", he then shook Crow's hand as Chloe hugged Carol. They both hugged their daughter Abby as the others boarded the shuttle and Abby said, \"Please come back.\", Michael said, \"We will.\", and they kissed Abby and Chloe boarded the shuttle (teary eyed) and Michael approached Karl and said, \"Watch out for her while we are gone. It shouldn't be long.\", Karl said, \"I will.\", and they both hugged before Michael boarded the shuttle and it took off as Michael and Chloe looked out the window and saw Crow and Carol standing behind Abby and Karl as they waved and Chloe waved back as she started to cry and Michael embraced her.

Michael said, \"Who are you all waiting for?\", Gabriel replied, \"For you of course. We want to say our goodbyes before we leave.\", Michael said, \"And what are you going to be doing with your spare time?\", Gabriel replied, \"Most likely in the rifle range. With your connections I was able to acquire a rifle range that is part of this house I am staying.\", Michael laughed heartedly and said, \"You lucky dog! Is it only yourself?\", Law said, \"Unfortunately not! Apparently the place I was going to stay was damaged by a forest fire, so I am forced to stay with him!\", Michael and Chloe looked surprised and Michael looked at Gabriel as he gave a slight smirk and Michael whispered in his ear, \"Good luck.\", Law looked at them alarmed and yelled, \"WHAT?\", Michael turned his attention to everyone else and said, \"I hope you have a nice long rest and hope we see each other again!\", and they all gave each other goodbyes before each of them went up to the transporter pads and began beaming down to the surface of Mab-Bu. Once Gabriel and Jen Law rematerialized on the surface they were greeted by a large two story colonial house right in front of them and Law looked at him shocked and said, \"Seriously?!\", Gabriel replied, \"I'm use to living in big houses. It's a force of habitat, that and sword fighting and rifle shooting.\", Law grabbed her only two bags and walked briskly ahead of him and said, \"I'm taking the first bedroom I see.\", Gabriel said, \"Except the main bedroom, that one is mine.\", Law looked at him before reaching the steps and replied, \"Then you better claim it before I do!\", and she continued onwards as Gabriel throat growled in aggravation and he grabbed his bags and walked towards the front door as Law opened it and he walked fast to catch up as he said to himself, \"This is going to be one hell of a vacation.\", before he entered and kicked the door close with the back of his knee high boots. The doorbell rang and Ender walked up and answered it to see Michael and a tall latino black haired male standing beside him and Michael said cheerfully, \"Hi Ender, how is the unpacking going!\", Ender sighed and said, \"We just finished.\", he looked at the stranger beside Michael and Ender said, \"Who is this?\", Michael replied, \"Ender I want you to meet Khan Noonien Singh. Khan this is Andrew Wiggin I was talking about.\", Ender then looked wide eyed at Khan as he extended his hand and said, \"It's a pleasure to meet you Mr. Wiggin.\", Ender hesitated but quickly overcame as he took Khan's hand and he replied, \"The the pleasure is mine Mr. Singh.\", Khan said, \"Please, just call me Khan.\", Michael lightly laughed and said, \"You can relax Ender.\", and Ender noticed he was tensed and he relaxed with a sigh of relief and said, \"Thank You, you can just call me Ender likewise Khan.\", Petra yelled from upstairs, \"Ender who is it?!\", Ender replied, \"Michael and a guest!\", Petra yelled back, \"Do they want anything to eat?!\", Michael and Khan nodded and Ender yelled back, \"No, we're good!\", and Ender invited them inside and Michael said, \"We have something special for you and Petra if you are interested.\", and they all sat in the living room. Khan told Ender he has brought a special ship with him that was formally a botanical cruiser but is reconfigured into a Battle School similar to what Ender and Petra were on. Ender kept a straight face as he remained silent as Khan further explained that the school is built to test or regain their superior abilities. Khan said, \"I will be one of your instructors and I will personally teach you and the classmates you will lead self-defense and tactics. When I met with the leader of the Velora Aggregate and told him about you and Petra as well as myself and my people he and his people are delighted and wish to have their younger generations join in the training if you and Petra approve.\", Ender sat back in silence till he replied, \"Why would I want to be a leader of an army, if this school is organized like the Battle School I remember, and how will this keep me from turning into my brother who is obsessed with killing?\", Khan said, \"Michael told me about your hesitation with killing or hurting others and the only way to overcome your fears is you must strengthen your mind and body and develop a sense of control while doing so. These children are like us and your girlfriend but have no sense of direction or control and some of them may even try to challenge you.\", Ender said, \"What about communications? Can I talk to people outside the school?\", Khan replied, \"Since we are not at war you can receive and send letters or calls to whomever you wish, as long as you don't discuss about your training in detail.\", Ender said, \"How long is this supposed to last?\", Khan replied, \"For now it is one year. This is the first year that this school or station will be operational and after one year the administration and I will determine how long should the school last for each group of students.\", Ender stood up and said, \"Then I will join. I'll talk to Petra but if I agree then no doubt she will to.\", Ender and Khan shook hands and Khan said, \"Excellent. In one week the school year will begin and the ship is right now in orbit and awaiting for your arrival. Just hail them on your communicator and they should beam you two up.\", they all said their goodbyes and they left Ender and Petra's home before Ender could fully process if what he is doing is right. Ender and Petra rematerialized and saw the transporter room that looks like it has no paneling on the walls or ceiling as Petra looked surprised and said, \"What a frickin' mess!\", the operator behind the console said, \"Sorry ma'm, this station had no transporter rooms built so we had to improvise.\", Petra then looked at Ender when they stepped off and said, \"I still think this is a bad idea.\", Ender said, \"Then why did you come?\", Petra replied, \"Because you can't do this alone, plus I do agree with Khan said that this may help you overcome your worries about your brother.\", they left the transporter room and were a little shocked to see a lot of similarities to Battle School and they saw orange lights along the ceiling going towards the right and Ender said, \"I believe that's us.\", and they walked down till they saw an emblem on the door that has a mountain in a circle and the door slid open on automatic before they walked in and saw the words \"Commanders Quarters\" above another doorway to the right of a large metal pillar in the middle of the circular room and they saw the words \"Barracks\" to the left. As they entered a dark blonde haired boy ran into Ender and he said, \"Sorry I'm...\", he looked up and was shocked to see Ender and he immediately stood at attention and said, \"Good afternoon ma'm and sir! Joachim Weiss of Ceti Alpha V reporting for duty!\", Ender waved down his hand and said, \"At ease Joachim. I am your commander and this is a military school but we can relax on the formalities for now.\", Joachim nervously relaxed and said, \"Yes sir.\", and Ender extended his hand and said, \"Just call me Ender, Joachim. If we are going to work together I insist we use our first names so it will feel like we are a family.\", Joachim shook his hand steadily and Ender said, \"Are they all here yet?\", Joachim replied, \"Yes si... Ender. We are just waiting for you and Petra.\", they entered the barracks as Joachim called them to attention. Petra stood behind and to the side of Ender when he introduced himself and Petra and told them that he plans to make this the best army in the school. He also told them that if anyone has any ideas he and Petra are more than willing to listen and if they are going to make it through the year they have to work together as a family. The loudspeaker came on and a male voice said, \"Olympus report to Battle Dome 1. Repeat, Olympus...\", Joachim said, \"That's us sir. The dome is right above us.\", Ender told his army to suit up and once they did they fell into formation and they followed the ladder well that is outside Olympus to the dome above where there are many platforms and cube objects (like in the Battle Room) and Ender gave them the same orientation that Graff taught him when he first entered the Battle Room. Ender stood by while Petra went out with Joachim and taught them how to navigate through the weightlessness and how to activate their gravity boots even as they walked on the dome floor. Ender heard the sound of someone climbing the ladder and when he looked back he saw Khan in his gravity suit standing behind him and he told Ender to have them form up. Ender called them back and once they were able to make it back (with some difficulty) Khan gave them a briefing to use the lighted cubes to their advantage when they fight and he told them as he is their head instructor he expect the best from this army and once he finished he let Ender take charge and tell them the goals and purpose of the Battle Dome. Ender briefed his army that the battle is determined whoever army is last standing or if an opposing army surrenders to the other. He told them about the gravity boots and how they can use them to their advantage and once his army was able to activate their boots he told them that per each dome there are four armies and at times they will have to report to other domes for battle. He also briefed them about their pistols and how they are use to freeze their opponents where ever they are whitened once Ender finished with the debriefing Khan intervened and told all of them to report to classroom A for the rest of their orientation. As the rest of his army was making its way to the classroom Ender asked Khan how does he and the rest of the administration know about Battle School since the ship and rules are so very similar and Khan replied, \"You think you and Petra are the only ones that went through Battle School?\", and he left as Ender looked at him puzzled. As what Ender learned in Battle School in Dragon Army he had his army practice in the Battle Dome during their free time and he even gives them little time to get dressed and ready, but after the first couple of battles his army surprisingly was able to adapt quickly that even at one time Ender entered the barracks with only two minutes to spare he saw his army was already waiting for him and he quickly overcame his shock and they went to battle. For the next six days they had a battle every day at four in the morning giving Ender's army four hours of sleep and they won every battle in the process. One day after lunch Ender received a message of another battle that day after winning one earlier and he was told classes are pushed back till after the battle. Petra saw the message as Ender read it to her in their shared quarters and they ran into the barracks and called the rest of the army to attention and told them about the message he received. Some of them groaned with disappointment but the rest did not flinched and they suited up and marched up to the ladder to the dome above them where the rival army was waiting and Olympus won the battle both to Ender and Petra's surprise. For the next four days they fought two battles a day and end up getting two to three hours a sleep a night due to classes being pushed back and Ender and Petra are even more surprised that the kids in their army are not complaining too much nor even protesting the amount of battles they fought and the little sleep they're getting even as they noticed some of the students looked like they may pass out from time to time and Ender relayed his protest to Khan but only left a message as for some reason he avoids talking to him. Khan sent a reply message and told him he will talk to the school administrator to see if he can drop it back down to one battle a day at least but there are no guarantees. He urged Ender to hang in there during this time as he believes he will and Ender turned off his computer and went straight to bed making one pound on the wall panel next to him in frustration and not staying up to do his studies as Petra sat at her desk and glances at his direction with a worried expression. The two battles a day began taking its toll when after two weeks almost two third's of their battles were on the verge of losing and some of them lasted so long that when they went to bed they have only enough time to get 10 to 15 minutes worth before finishing their studies and the next battle. Late one night as Ender slept he jerked in bed a little as he dreamt he, Petra, Bernard, Dink, Bean and Alai were trying to escape from Peter as he lead a dreadnought that continued to fire on their shuttle and he heard their voices yelling out orders or damage reports as the shuttle was taking multiple hits. Ender then began sweating and moaning orders on top of his body jerking when in his dream he saw the computer console in front of Dink exploded showering his face with sparks and debris as Dink was also thrown back and hit the back of his head on the elevated floor behind him as blood began running down like a stream from where he hit his head as he laid motionless. Petra screamed, \"DINK!\", and she was about to leave her station when Ender yelled out, \"PETRA! KEEP PETER FROM TARGETING US!\", and Petra quickly remembered and resumed her station as Ender called Bernard to check Dink. Once Bernard left his station as the shuttle jerked the floor panel beneath him exploded flipping Bernard's body in the air before landing on the floor with his head resting on Dink's lap and Ender noticed his legs are missing leaving bloody stumps as blood spurted from is severed arteries and his face is partially burnt as he laid motionless. He called over to Alai and just as Alai looked at him the console and the floor beneath Alai exploded (engulfing him in flames) and he saw a figure rose from the flames and began flailing about screaming bloody murder. After a few moments Ender recognized the face as Alai as Alai continuously screamed (while groping his melting, burning face in the flames), \"ENDER! ENDER! ENDERRRRRRRRR!\", and all of a sudden there was a flash of light as Alai was shot in the forehead and Alai fell on his back laying motionless as he continued to burn. Ender looked to see who it was till there was an explosion that erupted in front of himself and the next thing he saw was Bean standing in front of the destroyed bridge and a hatch closed between them and he heard Bean say, \"I will see you again.\", then the image changed to the wrecked shuttle he was on crashing into the side of the International Fleet's dreadnought and exploded and Ender screamed, \"NOOOOOOOO!\", and he felt a hard smack across his face and the next thing he saw was Peter's face over him in bed and Ender's face filled with rage and he screamed, \"YOU!\", and Ender immediately clasped his hands around Peter's throat and threw him back on the bed as Ender sat on top of him and squeezed all his might as Peter smiled back up at him and he said, \"Good, you are a killer now.\", and Ender screamed at him in rage till all of a sudden something grabbed his left hand and Ender was flipped over and his back slammed onto the metal deck as his arms and hands were pinned to the floor and he then heard a young man's voice yelling, \"Commander Wiggin, he's dead!\", and Ender looked up to see Peter's face transform into Joachim's. Ender looked shocked and continued to breath heavily as he heard someone gasping for breath and when he looked at his bed he saw Petra sitting on the side of the bed rubbing her throat as Ender saw deep red finger marks and her face is light purple. Ender looked shocked and said, \"Petra...I'm sorry.\", Joachim let him go as Ender sat up confused as the other students arrived and stood at the entrance to the Commander's quarters. Once the medical team arrive the teachers came and urged the students to go back to bed and they eventually left leaving only Joachim and Petra sitting next to Ender's side. Ender looked at Joachim as he was able to control his breathing and said, \"Joachim, go ahead.\", Joachim looked confused and said, \"Sir?\", Ender replied, \"You are their leader now. Till I am cleared.\", Joachim was about to protest but stopped himself as Petra held Ender's hands (as they were shaking) and Joachim nodded and left. As the medical team finished their examination the doctor told him that he suffered a severe anxiety attack and he must rest for two days before reporting back to classes or further training. Ender nodded in agreement and the doctor gave Petra a slip of paper and said, \"Since you two are close I'm leaving his care to you, AND no funny business!\", Ender looked down to keep from showing his smile as Petra looked at the doctor and acknowledged before he left and then they both laughed. During those two days Ender either exercised in his quarters or stayed in bed with Petra by his side and embracing him as they slept when the intercom in his came to life and a male voice said, \"Andrew Wiggin, Petra Arkanian and Khan Singh report to the bridge immediately.\", and Ender sighed with disappointment as Petra got out of bed. As they went up the ladder in the tube and entered the bridge they saw two roles of computer consoles with one in the back on an elevated platform while another row is ahead with a large glass window separating the vacuum of space and Khan was already standing by a short grey haired man with their back to them in a red Zhargosian uniform. As they approached Khan and who they believe is the captain the officer faced them and told Ender and Petra that they have an unidentified ship that is adrift and sending out an emergency signal and according to their scanners the ship's designs are not in the data base and they want Ender, Petra and Khan to see if they can identify it. Ender said, \"Yes sir, we will try our best.\" , the captain replied, \"Good.\", he turned to another officer on his right on one of the consoles and said, \"Proceed into the Taurus Nebula!\", and the officer pressed a few buttons and the ship entered the cloudy nebula covering the glass with purple fog. After a few moments and officer in the back said, \"We are about to clear the fog! The ship should come into view any moment!\", the fog finally cleared and Ender and Petra went from being concerned to shock as they starred at the main viewer and the captain noticed and said, \"What is that?\", Petra is the first to come to and she said, \"Sir, that is an Interstellar Transport ship from the International Fleet.\", and they all looked in amazement until they received a message that a Miranda and a Constellation class starships arrived to assist. One of the operator's on the bridge called out that the captain of the Mirage has detected faint life signs on board the derelict and the captain said, \"Prepare a boarding party, this will be a good lesson for our students. Andrew Wiggin, Petra Arkanian, you will lead two groups of students to board the derelict as Khan will be your senior supervisor as well as a handful of teachers and adults that will follow.\", Ender was about to speak when the captain said, \"That's all!\", and Ender looked at Petra (who nodded \"no\") and Ender kept his mouth shut and walked away. The deadline hooked onto one of the clips on the belt of a gravity suit as Ender looked up to see the other students do the same as the adults watched but none of the dozen students in Ender's group needed help. Ender looked at the hatch in front of him as the light above is red till suddenly it turned green and Ender put both his hands out and pulled down the lever on the hatch and it opened sending out a short gust of wind as the air inside was sucked out into space. Ender put his hands on the sides of his thighs and there was a short burst as small thrusters are attached to the sides of his thighs and he lead his group out into space followed by Petra's and one group of teachers/adults. They continued moving forward as they are well away from the ship and the only thing that is keeping them together is the deadline and Ender, Petra and Khan leading the groups with their thrusters attached to their thighs till they finally reached the derelict transport. Ender, Petra and Khan probed the hull of the ship with their hands trying to find a lever or something to get them inside till Ender found one when he swept the space dust away. Ender called out to Khan and Petra and they brought their groups to where he is and Ender pulled the lever and turned it counter-clockwise and the hatch opened. Once Ender and his group is inside they closed the outer hatch and there was the sound of decompression but they are still floating in the air when Ender opened the inside hatch and as they looked around the inside of the ship was a massive wreck. Ender led his group towards the bridge with their helmet lights on as there is no power or gravity and when they climbed up the staircase in zero gravity they noticed that the main viewer was blown out and everything that is loose (including any crew members) was blown out into space. As the rest of the group looked around Ender swept space dust off one of the powered down control consoles and saw the language he was familiar with and he pressed the red button that ended up turning on the console and he scrolled through with his finger and pressed another button that turned on the emergency power and lights throughout the ship. One of the adults said, \"What the hell is going on?!\", Ender replied, \"This is Andrew Wiggin, I turned on the emergency power. Looks like all primary systems including life support and gravity are all but destroyed.\", then he noticed a series of yellow lights blinking on the map diagram of the ship in front of him on the console and he touched the area to enlarge and it zoomed in to show lighted pill size spots and Ender said, \"Correction, gravity and life support systems are fully functional but in certain areas that appear to be...\", he paused as he looked confused and said, \"cryo-tubes.\", Khan said on the radio, \"How many?\", Ender pressed a few more buttons and said, \"168.\", he scrolled through the screen to find the manifest and the captain's logs but the computer records are all but destroyed or lost. Petra said, \"Ender, you need to get down here right away!\", Ender looked puzzled by her worried excited voice and said, \"Why?\", Petra replied frustratingly, \"Just get down here now!\", Ender looked around and found Joachim scrolling and looking through the navigation systems on the console in front and to the right of Ender and Ender said, \"Joachim.\", he turned to look at Ender and Ender said, \"You're in charge. I'm going to see what's getting Petra all worried.\", Joachim replied, \"Yes sir.\", and Ender moved out and once he was out of the bridge he made his way down and followed the tethered line through an open wrecked bay as large sections of the ship were either blown inwards or fell apart till he went up a ladder and entered another open bay but this time having rows of tubes lining the walls along the scaffolding as more wrecked sections or parts of the ship laid in the middle of the large open bay and he found Petra with her head down and resting one of her hands on one of the tubes as he came up behind her and asked what's wrong. She turned at him and Ender noticed she is crying and she buried her face into Ender's chest and all she said is, \"Behind me.\". Ender looked at one of the cry-tubes and he brushed his right hand over the name plate and Ender looked shocked beyond belief and said, \"It can't be.\", as the name plate read, \"Julian Delphiki III\". Back on Mab-Bu, after Arsenal and Carrie were dropped off, Arsenal carried both his and Carrie's bags and once Carrie opened the door and Arsenal dropped down the bags she approached to help him unpack but Arsenal raises his hand and says, \"I got this.\", Carrie smirked and she went upstairs and into the bedroom. Once Arsenal finished unpacking he went upstairs and saw Carrie laying on her side on the bed and Arsenal came up and laid down up beside her, even as the bed sagged and made a squeak sound as if it is about to break, and puts his arms around her and held her close as he closed his eyes. Carrie woke up briefly and she held his hands in hers and she smirked before going back to sleep. At first there is an undistinguishable whisper (as Carrie squirmed a little) and then there is more and more till it sounded like there is a large crowd in the room till suddenly a female voice yelled out, \"PLUG IT UP!\", and Carrie suddenly awoke, sweating and rasping for breath as she tried to sit up in bed looking around alert and Arsenal said calmly, \"It's a dream. You are alright. Relax.\", she laid back down in bed holding Arsenal's hands and arms tightly as he laid closer to comfort her. The ships (including the battle school) left the Taurus Nebula as the Battle School Ship resumed orbit around Mab-Bu while the transport ship was taken (in tow) to Anar'Qand where the survivors in cryo-sleep will be awaken and the transport ship will be further analyzed. Once the battle school resumed orbit and both Ender and Petra overcame their shook of seeing a clone of Bean they were told the battles in the Battle Domes would be reduced to one per week and Ender and the others are able to relax after days of continuous battles that left them with very little sleep. Ender stood in the shower in the commander's quarters as the hot water ran down his face and body as he sighed. He heard the door to the quarters open and he said, \"I'm in the shower, I'll be right out.\", and he heard Petra say, \"So who do you think he is? A clone?\", Ender said, \"I don't know. All I'm told is what you know and we have to wait till they are all awaken and can join us if Zhargosia and the Federation approve.\", all of a sudden the shower door opened and Petra came in naked as Ender looked up shocked and said, \"I said I'll be right out!\", Petra replied, \"Can't wait.\", and she stood under the shower head as Ender stepped back for her to wash herself but she stood there and said, \"Do you mind? I can't get my back.\", and Ender ran soap around her back and as he looked up he saw her smiling over her shoulder at him and before he knew it he had his arms wrapped around her before they started kissing. Since Michael and the others left for Termina and their return Crow and Carol stayed in the estate as Abby and Karl also lived their till Crow can find a way to reverse the effects Abby has as a vampire. One day Carol decided to leave the estate and went shopping and saw a group of older punk/hippy kids hanging outside the store talking to one another till as she left the store she saw that they are grouped right next to her car. She minded her own business as she opened the side door and put the groceries in (ignoring some of them that were staring at her) and as she was about to get in the car a hippy dressed teenager got in her way and said, \"Aren't you the kid that lives up in the hill?\", Carol stared down at her and said, \"I am no kid hippy, but yeah I live there. Why?\", the hippy said, \"Cause this is the first time we saw you, and we have been here for months. Are you afraid to come out?\", Carol said, \"No, I just mind my own business. Plus the people here are not my type.\", the hippy girl said, \"Dude, the people here are not our type either! Cause the way we look we are outsiders to the rest of this stuck up society.\", Carol replied, \"I can believe that.\", the girl introduced herself as Prin as the others also gathered around and introduced themselves as well. Prin then gave Carol the address to where they are staying and Carol told them she will come after she changes and drops off the groceries. Once she got back to the estate she quickly brought the groceries in and went upstairs to change into hippy like clothing before coming down and jumped in shock as Crow is already standing at the bottom of the stairs with his face hidden as the sun was setting behind him and he said, \"Do you want me to come too?\", Carol replied, \"No, I don't believe they would approve you. I'll be fine on my with these punks.\", Crow said, \"I know. Are there boys in this group?\", Carol stared at him with both frustration and anger and she said, \"Yes, and don't even think I am getting any dirty ideas!\", Crow replied calmly, \"That is not my intent. I am just happy that you are finally going to meet and hang out with other people including the opposite sex.\", Carol came down the stairs and said sarcastically, \"You sound happy with that dull tone.\", she still couldn't see his hidden face beneath his dark hair and shadows and she looked concerned and said, \"Are you alright?\", Crow put his hands on her shoulders and said, \"Till now never better.\", she then leaned forward and kissed his hidden lips as she embraced him and there was a sound of a car pulling up and a car horn and she said, \"That's them. I may be home late.\", Crow replied, \"I'll wait for you.\", and she went to the door and opened it before turning back and seeing him standing there with his face still hidden and she waved at him as she said to herself, \"I hope he's right.\", before turning around and closing the door behind her.

My heart speeds up, \"Ender!\" I scream. I grab two bags and sprint after him. He slows down in front of me and stops. He hunches over and is breathing heavy. I finally reach him and put the mask over his mouth and then fix my own. I remove my mask and say, \"What are you thinking? You can't just do that!\" I yell at him. He looks at me and removes his mask now that his breathing is even. \"I have to fix it, they were trying to communicate with me. I have to fix it,\" he says looking at me almost pleading. \"You can't do it alone,\" I state. I move my hand to his shoulder and say, \"I'm coming with you.\" \"You can't Petra,\" he says placing his hand on mine, my stomach flips and I feel almost giddy from the contact but I have to ignore it this time, I don't know what comes over me when I'm around him and when we touch it's like explosions. \"I have to do it alone,\" he squeezes my hand and removes it from his shoulder but stays holding it tightly. I feel a lump form and my throat tighten. He pulls me closer into a hug. I feel a tear fall and I nestle my face into the crook between his neck and shoulder. He lets me go. \"Go back,\" he says and turns around to walk into the fallen castle. I stand there for a second after he disappears before I wipe my eyes. I turn and walk back inside the ship. I walk straight past everyone and to his room. He has given me the code enough times so my fingers numbly click 96042. I walk in and sit on his bed, after a while my back and neck start aching so I lay down. I smile slightly because the bed smells so strongly of him, like earth and mint, surprisingly a good combination. My eyes start to get heavy and I try to stay awake but the eventually stay closed. I awaken to the sound of the door opening so I quickly sit up. Ender walks in and looks at me. \"What are you doing here?\" He asks a bit loudly sounding slightly annoyed but relieved at the same time. \"Waiting for you to get back, I knew you couldn't do anything stupid without coming here first,\" I snapped, there is silence for a minute, \"Did you find what you were looking for?\" I asked a bit gentler. He nods, \"I'm leaving out in an hour to fix everything.\" He still stands in the same spot right in front of the now closed door. I get up and go over to him, \"I'm coming with you,\" I say seriously. \"You can't Petra, you have to stay here,\" his voice is soft and almost breaks when he says my name. \"You need a crew. It's not up for discussion, I'm coming with you.\" I say softly but sternly while looking into his bright blue eyes that are so easy to get distracted by. \"Petra,\" he says but I stop him from saying anything else by taking another step, placing a hand on each of his shoulders, and tugging him so that we are only a few inches apart. I leave my hands there but now he's close enough that I can smell the earthyness and mint radiating off of him. \"I said not up for discussion, you're not going to be a super hero on you're own this time\" I whisper in his ear. \"Please don't make me bring you,\" he whispered back almost begging, \"I couldn't live with myself if you got hurt.\" My stomach flips and I can't resist the urge to pull him the rest of the way into a hug, so I just do it. \"With me and you, I don't think either of us can get hurt. We'll protect each other,\" I say little louder but still in a whisper. We stay in the embrace for a few more moments before he pulls away enough to see me, but not enough so we aren't still holding each other. \"We better get packing, meet me back here as soon as you're done,\" he says still sounding a bit worried. I hug him tightly again and when I let go I walk out and over to my room. ~time skip~ We both step into the small craft that we would be living in. \"When I requested it I didn't expect to have you so it's small,\" he pauses, \"and there is only one tube,\" he says almost sounding slightly embarrassed. I laughed, looking away slightly so he wouldn't see my small blush than looking back, \"We can manage,\" I say slightly laughing still. He smiled back at me and said, \"I'm sure we can, we might be here a while.\" \"Works with me, so what exactly are we doing?\" I asked. \"I found an egg, so we are finding a planet. There's still hope for them,\" he says with his beautiful blue eyes sparkling. He goes over to the control center and types some things in I follow him, \"Looks like it will take a little over a month to get to the stopping point,\" \"Start it up then,\" I say as the engine starts to roar. \"How are we going to do the whole tube thing? I mean it's kinda time to figure that out,\" he says sheepishly. \"We share it, I thought that was obvious,\" I state with a slight head shake. \"Oh okay,\" he says and we both crawl in. It's a bit smaller than usual, but it's still comfortable. He flips the switch on so we will both be asleep soon, \"Hey, Petra?\" \"Yeah Ender?\" I ask looking at him. \"Why did you insist on coming with me?\" He says. \"Ummmm,\" I come up blank maybe because I don't quite know or maybe I don't want to admit it, so I say the first thing that comes to my mind, \"The same reason you didn't want me to come, I didn't want you to get hurt.\" I say maybe a bit to fast. \"But why?\" He asks, he grabs my hand and intertwines my fingers with his still looking up, \"You can tell me. You can tell me anything Petra,\" He yawns. \"I...I,\" I can't tell him, it won't come out right. He gives my hand a squeeze, \"I'm not good with words,\" I trail off he looks over and gives me a curious look. All my senses are overwhelmed with him. His eyes and lips are all my eyes can focus on, he is all I can smell and truthfully I can't get enough, his breathing is all I can hear besides the purring of the engine in the background, all I can feel is how we are pressed up against each other and our hands intertwined, all I can think about is him, from when we met to now and all the memories and the quirks about him I have noticed, and there is a heat about the whole thing as the explosions are going off in between them. All I can do is lean in and place my lips against his. That's when we both fell asleep and I think that was the longest kiss there ever has been and the most awkward waking up I have ever had, but it was worth it.

You may be acting like your true teenage self but you can't help it. He is a cute boy. So as you were being lead to where the cast was getting their make-up done, you were nervous. 'What is he finds me odd? What if I say something stupid or annoy him?' You have so many thoughts in your mind now that you havent noticed you arrived at the make-up room. \"And here is the cast.\" The guy showing you around says, making you come out of your mind for a moment to greet each person.

It was not like this before. After all, he had known her long before this. But what now? \"Ender? Are you even breathing?\" asked Bean, raising a questioning eyebrow. He realized he hadn't taken a breath. He took a long, deep breath and looked at Bean, a teasing smile on the latter's face. \"Yes, I am,\" he replied and began to leave for his bunks. He had been in the hallway when she had passed by, her long raven brown hair freshly washed and dried. \"I'd bet otherwise,\" replied Bean. \"Anastasia's somewhat beautiful, isn't she?\" \"She's beautiful, there is no doubt about that. Smart, sweet, kind, brilliant - how can she not be beautiful?\" replied Ender, changing course to go to a free game station instead of his bunks. \"Not that way, Ender. I mean physically, \" he replied, conjuring an image of her in her usual T-Shirt and Pajamas in his mind and smirking. \"Sure is.\" Ender looked at him, a little disturbed. He didn't like the way Bean was thinking. \"Bean? Do you know you sound like a pervert?\" he said, sounding irate and angry. \"And do you know you sound like a boyfriend? Her boyfriend?\" he replied with a smirk and a snicker. \"Why so defensive?\" \"I don't like it when guys think of girls like that,\" he replied, taking a gaming station. Especially of Anastasia Cromwell. No one can think of her that way. Saving me , he added, remembering the dreams that often crossed him in his sleep, dreams that would make his throat burn and lips dry when she would sit with him, his eyes glazing over when he thought of it and later, berate and scold himself to think so, even though most of the times he saw them sitting together, holding hands and laughing. I'm not supposed to. He hated the lust he felt, hated how those thoughts made him go crazy with longing. \"Yeah, right? So why weren't you offended when Dink called Petra a hottie and stared at her like all he wanted to do was kiss her senseless?\" asked Bean. \"Because Petra and Dink are together,\" he replied tiredly. \"Anastasia is a friend.\" \"You forgot the just ,\" Bean replied teasingly. Ender turned to look at him, eyebrows raised. \"Every guy who claims he doesn't have a crush on the girl he does says he's just a friend of hers.\" His ship went crashing down. \"I don't have a crush on her!\" Ender replied indignantly, angry at both Bean and the game. Bean, who was smiling till now, cracked up. \"Don't lie! I can tell the way you look at her in classes sometimes that the best that could happen to you these days was her and you kissing each other breathless.\" The very mention of that made Ender's throat go dry. \"I'm going to bed,\" he replied and left for the commander's quarters, shared by him and Anastasia. Thinking of her name brought up her image in his mind. Raven hair, emerald-colored eyes, lithe figure, pale skin - she looked a lot like him in terms of stature, but her eyes defined her physically. Reaching his quarters, the darkness put his senses into a state of sleepy sluggishness. He looked at her bunk, fast asleep, hair falling on her face, making her look cute in his opinion. He undressed and put on his pajamas, sitting on his bed, staring at the ceiling and then the windows, looking at the empty space in front of him. Even after winning the war, they had been sent back to Battle School, now the school for the gifted and talented, the battle rooms now recreation centers. They held all regular classes here for the selective fifty who came hear every year at ten and studied for the next seven years, till they turned sixteen or seventeen at the most. And so, even the winning squad was sent back for regular education. Ender was nearing the end of his education, after which he would go back to Earth, and then Eros, if he chose to study military history, warfare, or enroll in the army. Fifteen and still not used to the changes in his body and his emotional framework, he was getting used to all things a regular teen would. Anastasia was the first. He looked at his most able friend in a different light now; she had co-commandeered with Ender in the war, and was the person he could count on the most. They were good friends. But now things were changing, now Ender looked at her like she was someone else, not a friend whom he would video-call in the night to share his worries and fears and ideas with. Rather someone who teased his fantasies and made his mind scramble for control on itself. With Anastasia asleep, he could now stare at her uninterrupted, which is what he often did when he got too stressed or confused. Either that or recite all the squares he knew. He looked at her face, shielded by her hair, body covered by the covers, wearing her white pajamas that night. Feeling restless, he walked up to her and began to untangle the hair all over face, trying not to take her up. Soon he had removed all of the hair from her face and was placing a loose strand properly in its place when his eyes strayed onto her lips, him breathing in the familiar scent of juniper and watercress which was emanating from her hair, mixed with the new scent of chocolate, now making its presence felt. Her lips were slightly parted, the smell of chocolate coming from them. It was 85% dark chocolate, his favorite. He tried to dispel the nervousness and moistened his now dry lips, which were getting drier by the second. He leaned in to smell the intoxicating smell, not realizing how close he had come. It was only when he felt a soft pair of lips brush by his and those emerald eyes look at him with confusion was when he realized what he had done. Anastasia had always wanted Ender, but couldn't bring herself to admitting it to him. Sure, she fantasized about him and her breath would often hitch in her throat, her lips dry and her body lose all strength when he touched her but she couldn't bring herself do admit her love for him. She was sure this wasn't a crush. After all, they had been through so much - she remembered the days when Petra was the one locked with him in that room on Eros after the battle; she wouldn't eat all meals, only drink water timely and feel unsettled and uneasy all the time. Only Dink understood why at that time, and he never said anything about it. He knew the closeness Ender had with her, and he knew how they would talk in the night, defying Bonzo's orders and when promoted to Dragon Army commanders, were rarely seen apart. They cheered the other up on bad days and shared their problems and achievements. Even at Command School and during the war, he would often chat with Anastasia at odd hours, and would never be seen without her during lunchtimes or any other time for that matter. And now, Ender Wiggin was kissing her, not that he knew he was. She wasn't going to let him slip away. She got up and moved away from him, looking slightly surprised. He looked ashamed, blushing, stuttering and trying to offer an explanation. \"I'm s-so sorry, I didn't me-mean to,\" but his apology was cut short when she took him by the neck of his t-shirt and pulled him in. All his thoughts were thrown out of the metaphorical window as he got lost in kissing her back, savoring his first kiss. It started as a soft kiss from her, but he ended up wrapping an arm around her waist, her hand in his air, him kissing her passionately, pushing her up against the wall. Bean opened the door without knocking, having Anastasia and Ender's permission to do so. He expected to see the two of them asleep and wanted to invite them over to the bunk for a game of Truth and Dare going on, but found Anastasia Cromwell pushed up against the wall, kissing Andrew Wiggin as if she would never get to again. He too was no different, his hand cupping her face, pulling her closer, as if they could come any more closer. Bean snickered quietly and signaled Dink to go. \"Why?\" Dink signaled. He beckoned him towards the door. Dink, seeing the scene, quietly went back with a grin, while Bean closed the door behind his back and flipped on the lights, clearing his throat for good measure. The two pulled apart, startled nevertheless. \"Bean? What are you doing here at this time of the night?\" she asked, receiving a smirk from Bean. Both her and Ender were blushing. \"I would ask you guys the same thing,\" Bean replied. \"Is this what goes on in the commander's bunks each night?\" \"Bean,\" Ender said warningly, an arm around her waist. \"And you said she wasn't your crush?\" he replied. \"Just leave,\" she said, annoyed. \"This isn't appropriate, you know.\" \"Okay, okay, go on,\" he said with a smile, switching off the lights as he left. Anastasia gave her boyfriend a grin, who replied by kissing her again. \"So, what happened, are they coming?\" asked Petra, looking curious. Dink had been grinning like crazy, yet didn't say a word. \"Well, let's just say they're busy, \" replied Bean, winking at Dink. Petra saw the look on the boy's faces, and shared the same confusion as Alai. Taking Alai for an alibi in case Ender asked her why she was snooping around, she looked into the door via the space under the door. It took her a couple of minutes to adjust to the darkness but when she did see properly, she could clearly a pair of figures kissing each other, leaning against the wall. \"Yeah, they're busy,\" she muttered under her breath, a huge grin on her face.

Few liabilities taken (least as far as novel canon is concerned), but...well, suffice to say, this does indeed contain book spoilers. Put on Ice Gwen Anderson couldn't remember the last time she laughed. Likely before assigned to Battle School, in hindsight, but even that felt like a different life entirely. A time where laughter was possible. A time where she didn't have to see children's lives be altered for the sake of humanity. To see those children depart, whether they washed out, be launched into the void to take part in an invasion dozens of light-years away, or if they were lucky, assigned to command positions within Sol itself. Lucky! Luck, she recalled, was almost as foreign a concept as laughter. Maybe it had been luck that had got Andrew \"Ender\" Wiggin into Battle School, but now, on Eros, luck was something that he didn't have to rely on. Luck wasn't playing into his manipulation of the International Fleet. If anything, it was the desire to win. And I'd know. I gave him that desire. She, and Graff, she reflected. But there'd be no shirking from responsibility if (or when) the time came for it, when historians could do its work without the threat of a bugger invasion hanging over them. All she could hope was that Wiggin's actions over the next few weeks would justify everything that had been done leading up to this point. \"Track them from below the ice and mirror their path.\" Anderson and every other officer (the number of which had been steadily increasing over the last few days, she'd noticed) watched as the fleet approached the formic ships. Three of them, all deployed above the icy rings of a gas giant. Nameless ships defending a nameless planet, about to be engaged by human beings who certainly weren't nameless. And Wiggin thinks, believes they are. That this is still a simulation. Christ! \"He's the one,\" she heard Graff say, as if reading her thoughts. For all she knew, the grizzled bastard could. \"Deploy all drones,\" she heard Wiggin say. The display screen showed the fleet's fighters disengage to engage the formic ships, the buggers' own swarms deploying to meet their foes. The Ansible did its job well, she thought. Perhaps too well. Seeing a recording might have been easier, but this was occurring in real time. Right now, light-years away, men and women were fighting and dying. Though, as she noted, not as many as they might have otherwise. Because three of Wiggin's capital ships were moving to engage the buggers from below. \"He's gonna crush them,\" she heard Graff murmur. Crush them. Obliterate them. Send thousands of buggers into the ether. To win the game, as far as the children believed. \"Now!\" she heard Wiggin yell. Sound didn't travel through space. Light did though. And the Ansible did its job even better. In real-time, she saw the ships open fire. In real-time, she saw the bugger ships explode into hundreds of pieces. In real-time, she saw their fighters lose all coordination. And in real-time, just a few metres away, she saw the children whoop and cheer. Level complete. Game on. \"I've never seen anyone do that,\" she murmured. Do what? Engage buggers for the first time since the Second Invasion? \"Still think he's not ready?\" she heard Graff ask. Or celebrate the destruction of bugger ships not knowing that those ships were actually real? \"Well?\" \"Of course Wiggin's ready,\" she said, turning to Graff. \"That's what scares me.\" \"Ah, just focus on the enemy Major. At the least, the buggers were put…on ice.\" Anderson stared. Graff remained stoic. The children continued to celebrate. \"On ice,\" she murmured. \"Seriously?\" \"You know me. I'm always serious.\" Anderson wanted to say something. Something derogatory. Something to get all the guilt out of her.

Adults really never tell you the truth. And this, he noted to himself, will hurt a lot. As he adjusted himself on the chair provided for him, he focused his thoughts on what would happen next. Peter won't hate me anymore. I'll come home and show him my monitor's gone. Then we'll be friends-wait, not friends, brothers. Able to live in the same house. And when he wants to play buggers and astronauts, maybe I can just go and read a book. \"This won't take long, and some people say they have a feeling that something missing. You keep looking for it, and you can't remember what it is. So I'll tell you. It's the monitor, and that feeling is normal and will pass a few days after.\" The doctor said as he now motioned for Ender to lie face down. What Ender felt afterwards was a jolt of pain that stabbed him from his neck to his groin, then he realized he forgot how to speak when the nurse asked him if he was alright. But at least his monitor is gone. Ender got back to his class only fifteen minutes before the closing bell, and he was still feeling a bit queasy. \"Are you alright Andrew?\" He nodded. \"Were you ill?\" He shook his head. \"You're not looking well.\" \"I'm OK.\" Ender insisted. \"Then you better sit down, Andrew.\" He went to his seat. But along the way, he stopped. What was he looking for? I don't remember what I was looking for. \"Your seat is over there.\" He went and sat down, but it was something else. I'll find it later. \"your monitor.\" A girl whispered behind him. He just shrugged. \"His monitor!\" She said to the others. Andrew reached out to where his monitor was. It got replaced by a band-aid. He was like the others now. He could hear whispers behind him. \"Oh, for Pete's sake, so what if it's his bloody monitor?\" The girl beside him said at the back.\"go and leave him alone, mind you. And don't disturb the class!\" She continued, not minding Ender at all. \"Your monitor too.\" \"Oh now it's mine. Do I look like I'm looking for something? Fuck off.\" She irritably replied. Ender managed to catch her eye as she turned back, and they got locked in a deep stare. Emerald green eyes. Never saw that before . \"Washed out Andy?\" Another boy who sat across the aisle said. The girl then dropped her stare and opened her desk. Couldn't think of his name. Peter. No, that was someome else. \"Be quiet, Mr. Stilson.\" Ender found himself opening his desk, like the emerald-green eyed girl did earlier. Never saw her before. Couldn't think of her name. He walked out of the room, expecting the bad kids to be waiting. They could freely hit him now that his monitor was gone. And it was always Stilson. Stilson and his buddies. \"Hey third.\" Nothing to say. \"Hey, Third, we're talkin' to you, Third, hey bugger-lover, we're talkin' to you.\" Anything I say will make it worse. So will saying anything. Then they all arrived at the part where Stilson and his friends won't let Ender pass. \"Lost your birdie, thirdie?\" They began pushing Ender, encircling him. Creating noise. \"See-saw, marjorie daw.\" \"Tennis!\" \"Pingpong!\" This isn't going to have a happy ending. So I'm not going to be the unhappiest. Ender kicked out high and hard, catching Stilson square in the breastbone. He dropped. Ender was surprised. The others backed away, wondering if Stilson was dead. I have to win this now, or I'll fight it everyday and will get worse and worse. So Ender kicked Stilson hard, again, in the ribs. Stilson groaned. Ender kicked him again on his crotch. \"You might be having some idea on ganging up on me. You could probably beat me up pretty bad. But just remember what I do to people who try to hurt me. From then on, you'd be wondering when I'd get you, and how bad it would be.\" He then kicked Stilson in the face. \"It wouldn't be this bad,\"Ender remarked coldly.\"it would be worse.\" He turned and walked away. Nobody followed him. Actually only a few were there. It was peculiar. A fight like that should have gathered a crowd. But there simply wasn't. He turned a corner and walked until he reached the bus stop. He leaned his head aginst the wall and cried. \"T-take my monitor a-away, and I'm just l-like Peter.\" He whispered to himself, tears falling down his cheeks. A warm hand touched his shoulder. Ender flinched. The hand was almost comforting, like his sister Valentine's comforts. He wioed the tears on his cheeks. \"Wiggin? Andrew Wiggin?\" A familiar female voice asked. Ender turned to see who it was. Emerald green eyes. Her again. Still don't know her name. \"You don't really wanna miss your bus. Takes two hours or more to wait for the next.\" She said. \"Yeah.\" Ender replied. \"It's there. Time to go.\" \"Thanks.\" He said. \"No prob. See ya.\" She said, giving him a warm smile as she turned and walked away from him, her blonde hair flowing along with the gentle wind. Ender almost smiled. Blonde. That's nice. A few weeks after, Ender Wiggin found himself on battle school. A launchie on his yellow suit. He was on space, but his mind was still on earthside. He couldn't stop thinking about the girl who was there with him on the stop, and her warm smile. blonde and emerald green. And I forgot to ask her name. He thouht as he entered the barracks. The only bunk left was the lower bhnk beside the door. He smiled. \"Thanks. I thought I had to ask for it.\" He said sarcastically as he went to wards his bunk. \"Ah, the sarcasm and coldness never leaves you, neh?\" A familiar female voice said above him. Ender looked up to see who it was and smiled. Same blonde hair. Same emerald green eyes. on the name tag. Same warm smile on her pretty face. \"Eh.\" He only said. \"Eh indeed.\" She said as she went back to face her desk. Looks like I don't need to worry about asking her name. Ender thought as he smiled at her and sat on his bunk.

Hope you enjoy it anyway! Song 'I'd come for you' and lyrics is owned by Nickelback. I no owny! The beep beep beep of the heart monitor reminded Peter where he was and why he was here. The bang bang bang of a cart being rolled down the hall reminded him of the reason he was seated in this seat. After all that had happened Peter still couldn't wrap his mind around it. Why had Ender done it? Ender was afraid of him. He hated Ender. He had tried to kill Ender on many occasions. Yet when he was almost cut down the idiot had jumped in the way and taken the bullet for him. All to literally. Apparently some old enemy of his had found him and brought his gun. He was dead in his tracks at the sight of the gun being pointed right at him. And just as the bullet was fired and about to run through his chest ending his life all together some had rammed into his side. HE remembered as he fell to the ground nad looked up in time to see the guy jump and speed off in his car and then to see Ender grasp his stomach and slump to his knees. He didn't know why but he was worried, and angry. Angry at the bastard for shooting the brother he hated and for his idiot of a little brother jumping in to save his life. Time flew after that as he remembered picking Ender up and realizing for the first time how light his brother was. The blood hand grasping his arm and the voice telling him to let him go. He shook his head and had run Ender to the car and drove him to the hospital. He probably should have just left the brat and ran. But when he arrived and he saw as his brother was rushed to the ER he found himself unable to. SO that's how he found himself in the uncomfortable chair sitting next to Enders bed. Now as he was able to get a clear look at the kid he had always for as long as he remembered hated with his whole being he finally realized how Ender was a perfect mix of him and Valentine. It had been hours since they had brought him in this room and his brother out of the surgery and into his own private room. Since then he had sat here and waited for him to wake up. To move, to show he was at least still in there. He looked down at the limp hand on the bed and back up at the pale face. \"Come on wake up Ender.. Anything?\" Yet there was nothing. Which brought back the question as to why his darling little brother had risked his life for him. He knew Ender feared him, he knew that the kid knew he hated him. Hell he had even tried to suffocate the kid before he went to battle school. And yet after all the attempts he had made on his life the kid had still been willing to get himself killed for him. That's what had confused Peter. And as to why he hadn't fought back when it was clear Ender had the ability. For everyone knew what happened to Bonzo at Battle School. It had been hours since the event and even longer since he had been shot and yet the kid still was up. He remembered how the doctors had said that it was possible he wouldn't wake up. It was possible for him to slip into a coma and stay there. He was about to give up hope when out of the corner of his eye he saw it. A twitch. A small one but a twitch at that. Ender was waking up. \"Come on Andrew come wake up for me\" He doesn't know what gave him the urge to stand up. Or to appear next to his little brothers bed side and brush the brown hair out of his face. But he had. Ender groaned and began to panic. Peter's eyes widened in realization. Ender recognized his voice and was scared. He was afraid for his own self that his brother was going to hurt him. Peter latched onto the kids hands and pulled them away from his bandaged chest as he had begun to claw at the bandages. \"No Drew I promise I wont hurt you. OK I promise not to hurt you ok just calm down\" To his surprise it worked. The kids hands stopped pulling against his and he settled down once again. He watched as the eyes moved under the closed lids and soon they began to flutter open. The hands he had grasped were now grasping his. He watched as Ender looked around and his eyes fell back on him. \"Pe-Peter?\" he sighed in relief, which was a new feeling altogether. He hated the kid! I mean he seriously hated the kid right? He let go of the hands but one was still trapped in his little brothers alarmingly strong grip. He settled for holding the one and sitting back down in his chair. Ender simply stared at him and remained silent. \"What the hell was that Ender?\" \"I-I couldn't let him ki-kill you\" \"Why the hell not?\" \"Be-because your my brother\" Peter could feel his eyes widen. His brother. After everything Ender was willing to put his life on the line for him because he still thought of him as his brother. It made him really think, did he really hate Ender. Of was he just to strong-minded and arrogant to see what he had right in front of him. \"I'd always come for you\" Peter smiled, although since Ender was probably high on pain meds and wouldn't remember it Peter vowed to never mention it again. He reached and ruffled his younger brothers hair. \"Well don't so it again\" \"Pe-Peter I never knew you cared\" He smirk. Smart-ass. \"I don't kid I just can't be mean to a girl and feel proud about it.\" And I'd fight for you I'd lie, its true Give me life for you You know I'd always come for you. So i hope you liked it! I wanted to explore the more brotherly side of Peter.. If he has one... I hope I did ok for my first time with the concept! Reviews are much appreciated!

As I called the bottle nose dolphin keep making a tweety bird sound making me smile then the sounds of sirens came close so I turned around to see a ambulance like vehicle come then a bunch of people came rushing out of the front and the back. \"Winter!\" A teenaged girl that looked about 16 said she had brown hair, white skin, brown eyes, and a camcorder in her hand. \"Where have you been? Oh my gosh Sawyer has been going crazy!\" And then a guy who was kind of cute came to the girls side he looked about 17 with also brown hair that reached to his forehead, brown, and white skin. \"Winter!\" He gasped then looked at me making the girl make a face. \"Thank you so much for finding and calling us, we've been looking all over for her!\" And I smiled then he looked at me werid. \"Your not from here are you?\" And I shook my head. \"No i just moved here from Texas\" I said and he smiled then pulled out a peice of paper then wrote something on it. \"My names Sawyer\" he said extending his hand to me and I shook his hand. \"Emily\" I said and he handed me the paper. \"Text me if you wanna hang out or something\" he said \"well I got to go, I'll see you around.

Sincerely, The writer[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 When I arrived home from walking on the beach I went into my house and saw some of the unboxed boxes in the far left corner making me sigh wishing that my mom never got this stupid job transfer. \"Hey\" my mom said coming into my new empty room. \"Hi\" I mumbled sitting on my bed. \"What do you want?\" And she sighed. \"You'll be starting school tomorrow\" she said and my eyes widen. \"Maybe you'll make some new friends.\" And I shook my head. \"Doubt it\" I mumbled and she sighed then walked out of the room and I felt a tear fall down my left cheek. The next morning I woke up to my mom shaking me and the light turning on making my eyes burn. \"It's a little chilly outside so you should wear a long sleeve shirt or something\" my mom said and I nodded going to my closet and pulling out a tank top with a cardigan and skinny jeans along with a pair of my black and white converse. \"I bought some donuts from the store\" and I raised an eyebrow then put my backpack over my left shoulder as I saw the time 6:21 so I grabbed a donut and sighed feeling the butterflies in my stomach. \"Good luck, make friends. I love you\" . When the bus finally arrived at the school my stomach twisted into a huge not and my heart began to race faster and faster everytime I got closer to inside. As I got inside everyone stared at me giving me strange looks so I pulled out my schedule that had my locker number and combination on it along with my classes. Emily Stefani Locker 299; 30-2-20 1st:World history 2nd:Biology 3rd:Caculus 4:English ~lunch~ 5:Advisory 6:Spanish As I was walking to my my first class I bumped into this guy making me drop all of my notebooks and he started to help me. \"Sorry, I wasn't paying attention. I'm new, I'm sorry\" I said stuttering and he chuckled. \"It's fine\" He said grabbing my stuff and as I looked up I saw that it was Sawyer making me smile. \"I should of been looking\" and then he looked up and smiled. \"Hi\" I said and he chuckled. \"Emily right?\" He asked and I nodded. \"Sawyer?\" I asked and he nodded his head. \"Sorry ..do you know where room 301 is?\" I asked and he smiled. \"Yeah that's my class\" he said. \"Follow me\" and I did. \"Good morning miss. Peck\" as we walked into the class it was small and smelled like Apple Cinnamon \"Hi my name is Emily Stefani\" I said handing her my schedule and she smiled. \"Oh you must be my new students! How great\" she said and I smiled. \"Welcome, you may sit in the back\" and I did. \"Why is she here?\" I heard a voice trying to whisper so I sighed and tried to cover my face then I saw that it was the girl from yeasterday making me roll my eyes. When lunch finally rolled around I sat down outside by myself because I didn't have anywhere to sit and I didn't want to sit near the trash. \"Why are you out here?\" A voice asked from behind so I tuned around to see Sawyer. \"Just wanted to be alone\" I mumbled and he sat down next to me. \"I'm pretty sure your girlfriend wouldn't like you out here with me\" and he raised an eyebrow then laughed. \"You mean Hazel? She's not my girlfriend\" he said and I could feel my checks warm up. \"Oh\" \"Yeah, and thanks again for calling yeasterday we've been looking all over for winter\" he said and I smiled. \"How did she get out?\" I asked and he shrugged. \"Nobody know to be honest\" he said and I chewed on my bottom lip. \"She's so pretty, she keep making a tweety bird sound\" I said and he smiled then looked into my eyes. \"She likes you\" He said and I smiled. \"She was probley looking for me\" and I raised an eyebrow. \"Why? \" \"Because I've been gone for 3 months for this Semester at Sea thing\" he said and my jaw dropped. \"You were the guy that got into that? I've always wanted to do that but they keep denying me\" I said and he smiled. \"No offense but how did you get in?\" \"I still don't know, a professor from Boston came up to me and asked. It was a tough decision because Winter had just lost her friend Panama and was depressed until we found a new dolphin named Hope who lost her mom when she was little. It was hard.\" He said and I laughed. \"So what's your next class after Advisory?\" And I looked at my schedule again. \"Spanish\" I said and he smiled. \"Same here!\" He said and I smiled until Hazel came outside. \"Sawyer!\" She said. \"I need to-\" \"I'll talk to you later\" he said and she walked back inside. \"Sorry\" and I shook my head. \"It's fine, I know this will beat werid question but do you know where I could work around here?\" I asked. \"At the aquarium, is all I can think of\" he said and I smiled. \"I can show you around, see how you like it and if you do then I'll figure something out\" and I nodded my head then smiled. \"Thanks!\" \"No problem, meet me here after school and I'll drive you to the Aquarium\" he said and then the bell rung.[Chapter 3] Ch.3 When I got to Clearwater Marine Aquarium the first thought about it was that it was huge. \"It's huge \" I said as we walked inside and he chuckled. \"Yeah, I'm suprise it didn't get messed up during hurricane Wendy\" he said and I raised an eyebrow. \"I think that's how Winter got out\" \"Wait I thought you said you didn't know?\" I asked and he looked at me werid. \"I did?\" \"Yeah\" \"Oh sorry\" he said and I smiled then he turned the corner leading me into the dolphin den. \"She's on the other side, this is Hope\" and I put my hand on the glass as if I was touching her. \"I've always loved dolphins\" I said and he nudged me leading me up stairs to see a pool full of water. \"That's alot of water\" and he nodded then grabbed my hand leading me to the other side of the pool making my checks warm. \"There she is, hey girl\" he said putting a hand in the water and she came up making her tweety bird sound and he copied her. \"She's so adorable\" I said watching him and he looked at me smiling. \"You can touch her\" he said and I shook my head. \"Come on\" so I bent down and stretched out my arm touching the cold water then her, her skin was so soft. Then age began to nudge me. \"No Winter she can't get in\" and I pulled my hand out of the water. \"What is she doing in here? This is staff only!\" Hazel said and I pulled down my sleeve. \"Sawyer you know the rules\" and I brushed a piece of hair behind my ear. \"Sorry, I just wanted to see how Winter was doing\" I said and she gave me a look then looked at Sawyer making me feel uncomfortable. \"Thanks Sawyer \" then I walked out. As I walked out I could hear them start to argue. Later as I got home i walked into to see my mom was unpacking the last couple of boxes that we didn't get to yeasterday. \"Hey sweetie, how was your first day?\" She asked and I shrugged. \"Okay I guess. I met a guy named Sawyer Nelson, he's really nice. I didn't tell you but i kind of met him when I found the dolphin name Winter yeasterday\" I said and she smiled then reached into the box. \"That's good! What about your classes?\" She asked taking out a picture of us together and putting it on top of the fireplace mantel. \"There boring\" I said sitting down on the couch. \"Sawyer said that he could help me get a job at the aquarium\" and she nodded her head. \"That's nice\" she said and I smiled then my phone buzzed so I grabbed it out of my pocket and saw it was from Sawyer. 'Hey it's Sawyer and I'm sorry for Hazel, I don't know what's up with her lately. I talked to Dr. Clay Haskett and he would love to met you in person tomorrow' and my jaw dropped. 'It's okay, and OH MY GOSH! thank you so much Sawyer!' I replied and he replied with a smiley face.[Chapter 4] Ch.4 The next day as I waited outside Dr. Haskett's room I keep walking in circles trying to keep calm. \"You must be Emily, so nice to met you. Come in\" he said opening the door he had brown hair, brown eyes, and white skin. \"So tell me why you want to work here\" and I smiled. \"Well I'm new to town and I wanted to work here because I love aquatic life. I was the person who found Winter and I feel like I have a special place in winters heart.\" I said and he smiled. \"Winter has that effect on everybody\" he said and I smiled \"Where do you see yourself five years from now?\" \"In five years? I see myself out of high school, into college for aquatic, and then working for a place like this.\" I said and he nodded his head. \"Sound good\" he said and I smiled. \"And last but not least, tell me a little bit of yourself\" \"I'm a grade A student-\" \"You do seem like an A student, one last question, do you have any questions for me?\" He asked and I nodded \"You must get this question alot but can I work with Winter in the pool?\" I asked and he chuckled. \"Why not you have a connection to her, do you know how to swim?\" He asked and I laughed. \"Yes sir\" I said and he stretched his arm out to shake my hand. \"I'll call you tomorrow to tell you my decision\" he said and I nodded shaking his hand. \"It was nice to met you Emily\" he said and I nodded. \"It was nice to met you to Dr . haskett\" I said then exited his office. The next day after school I had my phone on me with the volume all the way up waiting for Dr. Haskett's call. \"Your going to get in\" my mom said coming into my room and I smiled. \"How do you know?\" I asked and she smiled putting my clothes into my closet. \"Mom you didn't need to do that I was going to do it\" and she kissed my forehead then my phone started ringing making my heart race. \"Hello?\" I asked answering the phone call. \"Hi Emily, this is Dr. Haskett and I was wondering if you come by to the aquarium I need to ask you more questions\" he said and my heart began to race even more. \"Sure\" I said \"Thank you, see you in a bit\" he said and then the line went dead. When I arrived to the aquarium everything was turned off even Dr. Haskett's office and as I was about to leave I saw a note. 'Meet me in dolphin den' so I sighed and walked down to the dolphin den. When I got there the lights where turned off then they came on reveling all of the staff including Sawyer and Hazel who looked like she didn't want to be here. \"Congratulations!\" They said and I raised an eyebrow wondering what was going on. \"Emily welcome to Clearwater Marine Aquarium\" Dr. Haskett said handing me a employee shirt making me smile. \"Oh my gosh! Thank you\" I said and he chuckled. \"Congratulations\" Sawyer said and I smiled. \"Thanks \" I said and he hugged me making my checks red. \"You start tomorrow since it's a Saturday, I'm going to train you\" He said and I smiled. \"Cool\" \"Were going to swim with Winter\" he said \"here is your swim suite and a lock for your locker\" and I grabbed the stuff from him. \"Thank you\" I said. \"What time do I need to be here?\" \"Nine \" he said and I nodded.

Sincerely, The writer :)[Chapter 5] Ch.7 As I sat on my bed I stood up and looked into the mirror to see if my outfit was okay. A cute blouse, skinny jeans, and my converse. \"Emily!\" My mom said from the living room and my heart began to race fast so I walked outside of my room and he stood in the front door way. \"Have fun you guys\" my mom said and I smiled walking outside. \"Hey\" I said when she closed the door and he smiled. \"Hey\" he said as we walked down the driveway and to his car where he open the passenger side for me. \"Ladies first\" and I laughed as he closed the door and went to the drivers seat. \"So where are we going?\" I asked and he smiled. \"Do you like scary movies?\" He asked and I shrugged. \"I don't mind them- \"Great cause that's what we're doing\" he said and I raised an eyebrow then shrugged. \"Okay\" I said and he nodded his head Hey guys sorry for not being able to update so quickly I've just been busy with school and I've ran out of ideas so if you wanna help feel free to email me so yeah and thanks for reading and being very patient.~the author[Chapter 6] As we where watching the movie Swayer and I looked at eachother and left laughing at the horrible movie. \"That was so horrible!\" I said and he laughed \"I know right! Especially when she tried to escape but tripped\" he said and we laughed again then gave me a look that made my heart melt and smiled. \"So\" I said and he started to walk off and I followed. \"Swayer?\" A female voice said so we turned around to see Hazel so I bit my lip and looked at the floor as she looked at me then Swayer. It was awkward. \"Hey hazel!\" He said and I smiled. \"Hey\" I said and she gave me a look and I looked back down to the floor. \"I thought you had to go to tutorials with Mrs. Debbie\" she said and he shook his head. \"No I had to take a rain check\" he said. \"Emily and I just came out from watching that new horror movie\" \"You mean that one WE were supposed to watch together? \" she asked and I pressed my eye lids together can't believing this is happening. \"Oh yeah, I forgot, sorry hazel\" he said \"Ugh I cant belive you did this Swayer! Ever since you met her-\" and I sighed \"Have him Hazel!\" I blurted out then walked off, I couldn't handle all of the drama. The next day at the aquarium I tried to avoide Swayer and especially Hazel. As I was getting Winter her food I wasn't paying attention and bumped into this guy making me slip and drop the bucket. \"Crap\" i mumbled under my breath then looked up to see a guy with brown hair, brown eyes, and white skin looking at me to see if I was okay. \"I'm so sorry \" he said lending me a hand and I shook my head. \"I wasnt looking\" \"No I'm sorry I should of been looking\" and then he smiled making me smile. \"Kyle\" he said handing his hand out so I could shake it. \"Emily, I'm a little new\" I said and he smiled then grabbed the bucket. \"Sorry, for um.. bumping into you\" \"It's fine,I'm guessing that you need food?\" He asked looking at the bucket and I nodded. \"I'll get it\" he said \"for winter?\" \"Yeah\" I said and he poured the fish into the bucket then gave me the food. \"We should hang out or something \" he said and I smiled then he went to get a pice of paper and a pen. \"I would like that\" I said as he handed me the paper. \"Text me when your available\" he said and I laughed then left to give winter her food. As I got closer to the den I could hear Winter's tweets making me smile then the voices of Swayer and Hazel came into the sounds making my heart race so I hurried to the table to set down the food and leave. \"Your so weird\" Hazel said and I rolled my eyes then saw them kiss so I put the bucket down and walked out trying to hold in my tears.[Chapter 7] HEY GUYS IT ME THE AUTHOR AND I AM SO INCREDIBLY SORRY FOR NOT UPDATING.

His face lowered again as he realized if he just barged in there and banished all of them then everything they're talking about was true, and he didn't want to satisfy them with that. He was the emperor, other people were supposed to satisfy him, not the other way around. Kuzco gave a small growl before stomping away and running off to his bedroom. Once inside his room Kuzco grabbed his Wompy and held it tight against his face and chest and screamed in it. This was nothing new. He knew a lot of people didn't like him for thousands of reasons, the biggest was when they compared him to his father and noticed the stretching difference the two of them had. He knew his father was a great man. Yzma would sometimes talk about him, so would many of the other people within the palace whom either once knew his dad or knew of him and how his leadership benefited to the people of the kingdom greatly. Kronk, Yzma's assistant showed up immediately before Kuzco's dad left but he had mentioned to him once how Kuzco's dad practically saved everyone in his village from a drought with the help of the village leader. Sometimes people talked about how his father loved his son Kuzco so much he'd even had a school built in his name, and even named the money after him as soon as his son was born, just so people could bask in the greatness his heir will become when he reaches maturity. Yzma had even mentioned to him once his father had many plans for him as he ages which he unfortunately kept secret from everyone else. Kuzco knew his dad will be gone for a long time, by now most likely forever, he found himself wondering if his dad was so great why was he so different from him? Had he stayed and his mother never passed away would things have been different? Would he be the honorable charismatic leader or heir he thinks himself to be? Why his father left, no one will ever truly know for sure, once his father was declared missing and most likely never to return his mother died of a broken heart. Kuzo reached inside his royal robe and pulled out half of a locket. His father, the great emperor gave this to him when he was a baby before he left. The other half was taken by his dad. Only two things from what Kuzco knew connected him to his dad, the half locket and the same llama shaped birthmark the two of them had. Kuzco rarely ever pulled out his locket, he didn't like looking at it because it continuously reminded him someone very important who had loved him was gone and is never returning to complete this royal artifact. However he liked the feeling of the locket against him, it always gave him a small sense of hope. What he was hoping for, he never understood what. Was he hoping for his dad to return? Greatness in the near future? Was he hoping some of his father's greatness and/or personality would somehow rub off, on him through the locket? Kuzco wasn't sure. Then there was the birthmark. Despite llamas being his favorite animal he hated his birthmark more than anything. It was always used as an excuse to compare him to his father somehow. Just because of that mark people expect him and his father to have some sort of spiritual connection and somehow his dad will lead the empire through Kuzco. Remembering this Kuzco angrily threw down his Wompy. That doesn't mean I'm HIM!\" Kuzco shouted frustrated. Kuzco quickly lifted up his Wompy and held it tight quickly apologizing to it and placing it on his bed. He sat down his back against the wall beside his bed. He grabbed the locket and looked at his birthmark and threw himself back first against the bed frustrated and angry and called up at the ceiling. \" What am I doing wrong? What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to be you? Can I be me and you at the same time dad? I don't even know who you really are! \" Kuzco laid in silence waiting for an answer, when nothing responded he rolled on his side angrily muttering a bit before a blast of thunder scared and startled him. Kuzco's eyes shot open as the thunderstorm raged outside Pacha's hut. He felt a cold piece of slightly heavy metal pressed against him. He pulled it out from inside his pajamas and realized it was just his locket. He noticed flashes of lightning outside from small cracks of the window of the bedroom he sahred with Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi, Pacha's and Chicha's (his guardians') kids. Kuzco placed the royal artifact back and looked around the room. Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi were all sound asleep on their side of the room. Kuzco rolled off his side and lied on his back instead and heard the thunder and rain going off outside. Mother Nature must've decided to stir up a summer storm before vacation started. Kuzco wasn't sure what time it was, all he knew was that when the sun rose up he'd have to get up to go to his last day of school before the summer break. Kuzco was annoyed now, knowing he would have to endure the last day of school sleepy and with the haunting memory of a dream he had of a time when he was eleven. Not to mention everything outside would be damp and slippery in the morning. Unbeknownst to everyone in the Incan Empire, large ships had made their way up north to the Aztec Empire nearly two months prior. The unknown invaders made it to the Aztec shore and immediately started attacking and stealing anything in sight. XXXX When it was finally morning in the Incan Empire, Chicha's voice called up to the kids and teen telling them to get ready for their last day. When everyone was finally downstairs Chicha and Pacha quickly noticed Kuzco's odd behavior. They highly expected him to be bouncing around the house excited for it being the last day of school and a long summer break starting. They'd even taking the liberty in Kuzco proofing the hut the previous day ready for Kuzco's macro-mini-celebration. The teenage emperor to be sitting at their breakfast table looked like a boy who had a rough night. Ordinarily Chicha would be the first to speak up and ask the kids what's wrong but Pache decided to go first this time. Pacha cleared his throat and spoke to get Kuzco's attention. \"Kuzco, everything alright?\" Pacha asked. Kuzco head lifted up tiredly. \"Huh? …Oh, yeah.\" Kuzco mumbled before he finally stopped twirling his food with his fork and started eating. Chicha shared a look with Pacha completely unconvinced. \"Are you sure Kuzco, was it the storm that kept you up?\" Chicha asked. Kuzco thought for a moment before saying, \"Yeah, I barely got any sleep last night.\" Kuzco demonstrated this with a yawn, before getting up from the table ready to head off to school. \"Oh speaking of school,\" Chicha said deciding to hold the conversation about Kuzco's behavior for after school, \"Kuzco, would you mind dropping Chaca and Tipo off? Pacha and I wanna head down to check up on the llama pen as soon as possible.\" \"Yeah, sure.\" Kuzco called out from the door way a hint of distraction in his voice. Chicha made a face and walked up to Kuzco in the living room. \"Okay, now I know something's wrong with you.\" Chicha said as she left the kitchen talking to Kuzco. \"What do you mean?\" Kuzco asked. You never agree to take Chaca and Tipo, to school when I tell you to.\" Chicha said. Kuzco shrugged and said, \"Was this some sort of test or something? Besides it's the last day, one day won't kill me.\" Chicha shook her head and sighed. \"Kuzco, is there something bothering you?\" Chicha laid a hand on Kuzco's shoulder. \"You know you can tell Pacha and I anything right?\" Chicha said. Kuzco looked down and said said, \"Well…\" He was interrupted when Chaca and Tipo came out the kitchen calling out, \"Bye dad, bye Yupi, bye mom! Chicha kneeled down to give her kids hugs and kisses wishing them a happy last day and sending them out the door with Kuzco, before calling out to the teen, \"Kuzco, keep your head up high, but out of the clouds, you hear me?\" \"Yeah I hear you!\" Kuzco called out back, with a backhand wave, smiling as he was looking over his shoulder to Chicha and Pacha, who was now at the door beside Chicha. Kuzco had actually sounded like he heard her, leaving smiles on Pacha's and Chicha's faces. On the way down Chaca and Tipo splashed around the puddles left behind by the storm. \"Can you two not splash so much?\" Kuzco asked. Chaca toned down her splashing a little but Tipo completely ignored him and continued on with his splashing and giggling. \"Oh hey, Kuzco, why were you all upset earlier? Chaca asked. Kuzco made a face before replacing it with a happy confident look and claiming in an overly confident voice, \"Upset?! Me? Kuzco? I'm never upset about anything! I mean come on, you guys know me! I'm cool, confident, Kuzco!\" Chaca and Tipo giggled at this. \"Are you sure the words you were looking weren't, arrogant and cocky?\" Chaca asked. \"No,\" Kuzco said, \"cuz then the acronym would be ACK. And that does not sound like me.\" Chaca laughed lightly before Tipo accidently splashed her. \"Hey!\" She cried out. Then it was Kuzco's turn to laugh. \"Not funny Kuzco!\" Chaca warned him. \"Well it's funny from where I'm standing.\" Kuzco said between chuckles. At that Chaca took the liberty to stomp on a puddle between her and Kuzco resulting in Kuzco to jump back and slipping off the last step of the hill. Chaca and Tipo both laughed at him. \"Oh, you two just asked for it!\" Kuzco said challengingly with a smirk on his face. His hand had landed on a small puddle and he flung what little dirty water he could at them. Chaca and Tipo yelped and backed away and took off running down the pathway that lead to their school with Kuzco racing beside them. Their walk to school had become a race to see who gets to school without getting splashed at by your opponents. When the three of them finally arrived at Kuzco Acadamy they found they were lucky enough not to get drenched with their splashing but definitely needed to dry off a bit. Kuzco left Chaca and Tipo to get to their classes in the lower level of the school while he went up to get to his first period in the higher levels. On the way up Kuzco thought about how the walk to school had actually been fun, despite living with them, he hardly ever plays with Chaca, Tipo, or Yupi, of course there had been that previous summer before Kuzco was taken off the thrown to go to school, he'd spent a lot of time with Pacha and his family at the summer home he'd built for vacation, he wondered why he shouldn't just spare a little bit of time ever now and then to hang out with Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi? I'm the emperor, people are supposed to satisfy me, not the other way around! Kuzco stopped in his tracks, remembering that old phrase he continuously repeated to himself like a mantra when he was eleven and part of his early teen years. He remembered it from his dream last night He hasn't said that to himself in a long time. \"Hey Kuzco!\" Malina said calling up to him with a wave. \"Oh hey, Ma-lina.\" Kuzco said in his usual \"flirting-with-Malina\" voice. Malina rolled her eyes and smiled. \"So how's it going? Did you hear that giant storm last night?\" \"Of course I did, I live at the top of the hill.\" Kuzco said. \"Oh right, did you manage to get any sleep? Cuz I could see some tiny black bags under your eyes.\" Malina teased. At this Kuzco paniced and opened his locker to pull out his mirror and check his face. Malina chuckled as Kuzco realized there was no sign of sleep deprivation on his face and placed the mirror back. \"Ha, ha, very funny.\" Kuzco said and walked beside Malina to their first class of the day. \"So what are you plans for this summer? Are you going to head back to your summer home and hang out with Pacha and his family their again like what you told me about you did last summer?\" Malina asked. \"Still haven't made much plans yet, however I think I'd definitely look forward to a beach and a certain hottie-hot-hottie to be by my side.\" Kuzco said wiggling his eyebrows in Malina's direction. Malina gave a small scowl to Kuzco and rolled her eyes before saying, \"Sorry Kuzco, but I actually do have plans this summer with my family.\" \"Really? Where are you headed?\" Kuzco asked. \"My dad got invited by a few of his distant relatives to the Mayan Kingdom to help with the giant calendar project they've been working on and they asked me to help too! I'm so excited!\" Malina said. \"Mayan?\" Kuzco asked, \"You're half Mayan? \"Well, me not specifically, my dad has a few relatives here and there. But you know I hear Ramon is half Incan and half Aztec.\" Malina said. \"well that explains the sound of his name.\" Kuzco muttered. \"Kuzco!\" Malina scolded. Kuzco raised his hands up in defense while reluctantly apologizing. \"So tell me all about this giant calander project.\" Kuzco said. \"Oh, you don't want to hear about that.\" Kronk said popping out of nowhere. It's some really horrifying stuff!\" Kronk said. \"Horrifying?\" Kuzco asked. Malina sighed and said, \"Kronk, there's really nothing horrifying about it.\" \"Oh but it is! I mean, who would want to make a calendar that's literally going to mark… JUDGEMENT DAY!\" Kronk said with a gasp holding a fist against his chest and biting his lower lip. \"That calendar's going to tell us when the world's going to end?\" Kuzco asked. Malina sighed again and said, \"It might or it might not, I haven't grasped all the details yet, but I promise to tell you guys all about it when I get back.\" \"No! I don't wanna hear it!\" Kronk said sticking his fingers in his ears before running off with a loud, \"LALALALALA!\" coming out of his mouth. XXXX The rest of the day went by fast, considering it was the last day. Most of the day was filled with either last minute pop quizzes which irked Kuzco greatly out of natural dislike of doing schoolwork and other parts of the day was mostly filled with watching documentaries as a recap for the class with the requirement of taking notes. Until finally the last class of the day: As Mr. M spoke to the class on the final day of school before summer vacation only one unruly student meant to rule the Kuzconian (Incan) Empire only sat staring at the clock as if willing it to go faster. \"Kuzco!\" Malina whispered. The emperor to be turned his head to the hottie-hot-hottie and asked, \"What? Can't you see I'm waiting for the bell to ring?\" \"You have to pay attention, this could be important.\" Malina said. Kuzco sighed and turned to face Mr. M. \"I'm sorry to inform you students but this summer may not go as you planned, due to some unfortunate circumstances.\" Mr. M. stated sounding mournful. \" Please don't say summer homework, I thought it was just a myth! Oh pretty please, please! Don't let it be summer homework! \" Kuzco begged in his head with a worried look. \"There have been some unknown invaders entering within the Aztec Empire our next door kingdom, The Empress Anacaona has made arrangements within our army to speak with the general and ask for reinforcements…\". At this Mr. M's words flew out of Kuzco's ears and Kuzco's eyes widened as wide as they can possibly go with surprise and shock filling them before it was replaced with anger and a heavy glare formed in his eyes. Kuzco shot up from his seat and exclaimed, \"I never agreed to this!\" The whole class was taken by surprise at Kuzco's outburst as did Mr. M. \"Kuzco please sit back down and allow me to finish-\" \"No!\" Kuzco cut his teacher off and continued speaking, or more like exclaiming, \"I never agreed to allow anyone from outside this kingdom to speak to the general, and especially getting my army involved with other kingdom's affairs. No one talks to the army before speaking to the emperor, it's a royal law!\" While Mr. M. wiped the surprise from his face he continued speaking, \"Well Kuzco considering you are currently at the moment not officially emperor I believe whoever is in charge of the palace while you're away made these arrangements without consulting you first.\" \"Well, who does this Empress Anacaona think she is, getting my soldiers and empire involved with her problems?\" Kuzco asked his angry demeanor not soothing a bit. \"Kuzco, she is behaving in a way any leader would when they're kingdom is under siege. In the last two months half her army had already been wiped out and she is seeking an alliance from us, a neighboring kingdom. Think about it what if it was your kingdom in danger, you'd only have two options for an alliance either through the Aztecs or Mayans.\" Mr. M explained. At that Kuzco toned down his demeanor a bit. \"Kuzco…\" Mr. M said, \"You may not be crowned yet, but take this as your first real test as an emperor. It may seem unfair now, but you'll understand when you're older and a more experienced emperor Think of what you father would do in this situation...\" Kuzco's eyes widened at the mention of the former emperor, he knew exactly what his dad would do. Apparently that was something else Kuzco realized was different between him and Emperor Ayar-Manco, but Kuzco wanted people to trust his own judgment as well, he was sick of being compared to his father. Kuzco has heard enough stories about his dad to determine his personality, his father would help out of the goodness of his heart, but he'd still be endangering the innocent lives of his soldiers, tear families apart, and all for what? To save and form an alliance with strangers. Kuzco on the other hand wouldn't dare think about endangering his soldiers, sure sometimes he's taken advantage of people's servitude for selfish reasons, but he wouldn't send them off to defend strangers with their lives either. Strangers… who are probably currently in torture, and despair if he doesn't make a choice soon. Kuzco sat down annoyed and frustrated without a word holding his head in his hands looking down at the desk. He knew everyone was probably staring at him, they have been the moment he spoke up. They were all probably thinking he was angry about the whole situation going on outside the Inca Empire, that was only half true, but this was something else entirely. This is the position rarely seen by anyone else, when a storm just as powerful as the one last night and the storm of a war arriving soon raged inside him. This is Kuzco when he's thinking, \" Even when my dad's not here, he's still always right…\" A/N: Anacaona: Means Golden Flower Ayar-Manco: Means The Most Successful Please review and tell me if I should continue, I know there was a lot of OOCness here and there but I hope you all still enjoyed it! Sincerely, *SS8*[Chapter 2] A/N: This is just a kick back chapter before we get to the more intense stuff. Warning: Their maybe some slight OOCness Please review and enjoy! (… Uh… switch that around!) Please enjoy and then review! :) Chapter 2: Moves Like Jaguar When the last bell finally rung Kuzco wanted nothing more than to get out of the school with Malina and Kronk, mostly Malina though, and get back to a better mood, however Mr. M. called him back to apologize to Kuzco. The small man had been awkward at his apology, but Kuzco forgave him anyway, all he wanted was to get out of the school. Once Kuzco made it back to Malina and Kronk he appeared much more chipper than he had in the class room, the two were confused but a happy Kuzco was much more bett- tolerable than an upset Kuzco. To celebrate the last day of school and the start of vacation Kuzco had arranged a party at Mudka's Meat Hut two weeks prior. Everyone was in casual clothes, Kuzco in his yellow hoodie, and blue pants, Malina in her pink poncho with white leggings a belt, white top and pink hat, apparently Kuzco's number one rule to attend the party was not to wear school uniform at the party, he'd even ordered a new invention called a juke box to play music at the hut. The machine was fantastic and everyone enjoyed the music it played, besides Kuzco knew if he had instead ordered a large extravagant band like he'd originally planned it wouldn't have impressed Malina at all knowing he was wasting royal funds on a huge party just for the last day of school. Everyone Kuzco knew from school, unfortunately this had to include Ramon as well, was at the party. Luckily when one of Kuzco's favorite songs besides his theme music started playing Kuzco quickly had Malina with him on the dance floor dancing to moves like jaguar. Everyone made large room for them in the center of the dance floor where Kuzco was busting his best moves with Malina. When Kuzco noticed all the attention was on them, unintended for once, he grabbed Malina's hand, catching her by surprise and smirked. He started leading her in an extravagant dance. It started with Kuzco's and Malina's hands held out between them as they swayed their legs to the music. He then pulled Malina closer to him where she spun at his side while he swung to Malina's old spot and Malina landed in his after her spin. Kuzco and Malina's hands were brought up as fists and the two swayed their bodies from side to side opposite of each other. The first move was repeated between them, only this time Kuzco did the spin and Malina did the swing, only this time they didn't need to grab each other's hands. Now they were still facing each other but left space to their sides and starteded kicking their feet high while swaying their hands to the motions. Kuazco and Malina circled each other in a dance, they were incredibly close. It wasn't till Malina noticed how close Kuzco got and the empty space surrounding them as their friends watched, Malina whispered, \"Kuzco, everyone's staring at us!\" Kuzco smirked and said, \"Who cares, you know I personally like the attention, but you should try and enjoy the lime light every now and then, you'll see how great it feels.\" \"Is that why you're so obsessed with it?\" Malina asked. Kuzco smirked before once again catching Malina by surprise by grabbing her hand yet again and held her close to him and started using the space around the room to dance to the music. Kuzco and Malina used their hands to pull apart and get close and spin in their dancing, Malina felt excited being able to dance this way, she was going to feel embarrassed later no doubt but she had to admit the spot light wasn't so bad, also she had to admit that Kuzco certainly had the dance moves like jaguar, not that she'd ever admit it to his face, despite being his friend, she wasn't going to give him that satisfaction. As the song gradually came to an end everyone on the dance floor was brought back to life again swarming around them as the next song started up. Everyone danced throughout the afternoon and most of the night. Malina was hanging outside the hut under a night sky with Yatta chatting it up with fizzy drinks in their hands and music playing in the background with lights shooting out from inside the hut where the party was still going on. Malina was enjoying her chat with Yatta when she suddenly asked an unexpected question. \"So Malina do you like Kuzco now?\" Yatta asked. Malina nearly coughed out her drink when MYatta asked that question, although, she did end up slightly choking on her drink. Yatta laughed once Malina pulled herself together. \"What kind of a question is that?\" Malina practically gasped as she heard Yatta laughing beside her. \"Hey, judging by how you and Kuzco were hitting it off on the dance floor, you could literally feel the electrical sparks in the air girl.\" Yatta said. \"It's humid out!\" Malina tried to explain while accidently exclaiming her reason. Yatta couldn't help herself and gave another fit of laughter at Malina's hurried excuse. Malina scowled at her, folded her arms, and turned away with her chin up. Yatta's laughter gradually died down and she laid a hand on Malina's shoulder saying, \"Girl, don't be that way, you know I'm only fooling.\" Malina turned back to Yatta with a smile and sighed. \"Yatta, Kuzco and I are just friends, he's just a really good dancer, that's all.\" \"Whatever you say Malina.\" Yatta said pretending to give up before giving an evil grin and asked, \"So that makes Kuzco available huh?\" Malina once again nearly choked on her drink, this time Yatta had to force herself to stifle her giggles at this if she wanted to pull this off. \"You- you like Kuzco!?\" Malina nearly shrieked. Yatta placed her hands on the wooden blcony railing her and Malina were leaning by outside the hut and shrugged continuing to play her part and said, \"Eh, maybe a little, but hey what girl wouldn't give for a life of riches and power.\" Malina's eyes widened, then she scowled, trying not to glare at her best friend and said, \"You're terrible Yatta.\" \"And he's so cute too.\" Yatta continued. Yatta felt a silence beside her and looked beside her to see Malina glaring at her, whether or not she was angry or jealous, Yatta couldn't tell what, but Yatta decided to quickly discard her role and laughed tapping Malina on the shoulder lightly and said, \"Girl, I'm just kidding, you should see the look on your face!\" Yatta stood herself straight from the railing and gestured to Malina inside the hut, \"C'mon, we're gonne miss the rest of the party if we stay out her all night trying to convince you, you like Kuzco.\" With that Yatta walked ahead of Malina inside. Malina blinked several times taken aback by Yatta. She shook her head, sighed and, smiled, before discarding the remnants of her cup containing the fizzy drink on an abandoned messy table and followed Yatta inside where the party kept going. Inside Malina caught sight of Kuzco dancing alongside Kronk, Guaca, and Ramon. With Ramon on Kronk's side where Kuzco wasn't, they weren't dancing in a group but more in a row, with Guaca on Kuzco's left, Kronk on his right, and Ramon to Kronk's right. A song that was really recent and never heard by Malina before was playing in the background. Although she can make out some of the lyrics as pa pa l'americano As the rest of the students danced all over the hut, even a few just chilling beside the walls or inside the booths or tables of the restaurant. The four of them were doing a very odd, elaborate, and somewhat silly dance, Malina covered her mouth as she giggled at them as they all danced in synch never missing a beat. The party went on for several more hours and Malina and Yatta danced the night away with their friends as did Kuzco and Kronk did with theirs. Soon the boys and girls were dancing in a group to the music. Everyone had to admit, Kuzco may sometimes act like an arrogant jerk, but he sure knew how to throw a party. Once a song was over the ones who was hosting the party, which surprisingly wasn't Kuzco but instead his old theme song guy and Kronk's old theme song girl announced that it was karaoke time many hands shot up in the air. The two theme singers were looking for several random people, and had Kuzco come up first (not random obviously), then Kronk, and Ramon, they were all voted to sing Viv'n la vida loca . Everyone cheered and many others laughed in the crowd, of all the songs they were asked to sing. Malina only hoped Kuzco won't bring himself to shove Kronk and Ramon off the stage as they sang. Kuzco had to resist the urge to shove them off the stage in the beginning, knowing everyone, especially Malina would all get upset with him and leave ruining the party. He learned that mistake when he ruined Dirk Brock's voice and he was not going through that again. He soon found himself enjoying himself with his semi-friend (Kronk) and rival (Ramon), of course it did help that Kuzco was the one singing in the middle of them both, somewhat making him the star of the show. When the song ended, everyone cheered for them, and Kronk, Ramon, and a reluctant Kuzco got off the stage to allow someone else to sing. The next group were a small handful of the cheerleaders from school who got up to sing Asereje (The Ketchup Song). The party was full of excitement as many people went up to go sing in front of the entire junior class of Kuzco Academy's high school. Several more groups and singles went up to sing, Yatta had just come down after singing I Got Nerve, when theme song girl asked who well be the next lucky pick. Yatta automatically raised Malina's hand up to go next. \"Yatta! What are you doing?\" Malina hissed. \"Theme song girl! Malina would love nothing more than to go up next!\" Yatta shouted at the smaller woman. Theme song girl smiled and gestured the girl up to the stage, as for Yatta, she took the liberty in pushing Malina up the stage. \"Yatta I don't even know what song I should sing!\" Malina whispered. \"Don't worry girl, I've got that covered.\" Yatta said before speeding off the stage to talk to theme song guy who was in charge of playing the songs. Yatta whispered to him, \"Malina would like to sing the song, \"Just The Way I Am.\" Theme song guy nodded and started playing the song. Malina held onto the microphone on stage looking at the crowd confused until she heard a song start playing for her to sing. Malina wasn't sure she wanted to sing that song but the entire junior class started roaring in cheers, she could barely hear the sounds of Kuzco and Yatta being the loudest ones cheering. Malina took a breath knowing she wasn't getting out of this and started singing. The song was upbeat and catchy and had everyone at the party dancing and cheering for Malina. It was a good thing to, if Malina was going to sing something emotional and sweet it'd probably bring down the whole party. Once the song was over everyone cheered for Malina as she walked off the stage. The cheerleaders, Yatta and the rest of her friends (Kuzco, Kronk, Guaca, and Ramon) all complimented her while several gave her pats on the back. Malina looked to Kuzco whom she caught smiling at her, Malina turned away her face reddening just a bit on her cheeks. Several hours later the party started dying down and many of the guests had already started going home. Eventually it was just Kuzco, Malina, Kronk, Yatta, Guaca, and Ramon with three cheerleaders surrounding him left in Mudka's Meat Hut. It seemed like nothing more than a friendly outing amongst friends, little did anyone know that a message had been sent from within the palace and is currently traveling to Pacha's hut on the highest hill of a small farming village for Emperor Kuzco… A/N: Hope everyone enjoyed! Please review and recommend this story to friends. :) Sincerely, *SS8*[Chapter 3] A/N: Ok just gotta say, to those who miraculously gave me 20 extra reviews in one night, and to the first 3 whom had originally reviewed the story, have all officially become some of my most FAVORITE people on the PLANET! :D THANK YOU SO MUCH! What did you guys do to make that happen? Gather all in one room and suddenly decide to read and review the same story at once? Lol. You people are amazing! Disclaimer: Don't own the movies/show. Italics: Thoughts Enjoy! Chapter 3: The War Meeting It was dark out as Malina and Kuzco headed their way back to their homes from Mudka's Meat Hut. The rest of the gang had already returned home. As the two walked Kuzco rested his hands behind his head looking up at the starry night sky with Malina by his side. They were both smiling and relaxed. Kuzco at the moment felt grateful, for once, for everything he had. To think no more than a year ago he would have laughed if someone had told him his dream girl would be found in the smallest of all peasant villages in the entire empire, not to mention he also would have had the offending person thrown out the window, and everyone knows it. Then there's his surrogate family at the top of the hill, growing up Yzma had always told him he could have anything he wanted and no one in the kingdom was allowed to stand in his way. That must've been what drew him to Malina and Pacha and his family. They don't treat him as the royal he once saw himself fit to be, they treat him like an equal though it sometimes bothered him he couldn't help but feel that those were his companions' best qualities. They stand up for themselves, they refuse to have someone above them if they feel like they're not worthy to be their superior. They all brought Kuzco down to their level and taught him something Yzma or anyone else never did, right from wrong. Yzma probably believed if she gave Kuzco whatever he wanted he'd someday return the favor, little did the mad little old woman know that her actions caused Kuzco to grow up as a selfish spoiled brat and her expectations of him must've backfired. It was all thanks to Pacha, his family, and Malina as well that he's turned over a new leaf, mostly, baby steps at a time, he's trying his best to become better, after spending a lifetime the way he is now, it takes time to change and his friends were their every step of the way to help him get through it and especially learn it. That's probably the other reasons why he likes them all a lot. When everyone else in the kingdom was afraid to stand up to him they put effort into changing him for the better, many of the people he's met since he met Pacha and started school seemed to be the only people whoever seemed to care about his wellbeing, that was a good feeling, as for everyone in the palace, they just seemed to care about the fact that they have to keep the emperor in line to rule. Growing up he's never had any real friends- well… unless you count Wompy, Pacha was his first real friend and thanks to him he's made many others as well, that's why he felt so grateful. Even though he never really shows it he does appreciate everything he has now. Then again if it wasn't for Pacha allowing him to move in with him he never would have met Malina, he probably would've met her at school, but if he'd chosen to move in with one of the noble's homes from one of the richer villages he probably wouldn't have spoken to her in the first place. When Kuzco was sent away from the palace, many Noble homes offered him a place to stay but Kuzco knew their style, they were after his riches and he was pretty sure many of them were trying to offer him up their daughters, they probably thought if Kuzco had chosen one of their homes they'd have an easier chance at having their daughters woo him over. And as much as he would have preferred to live in a rich household, he was not looking for a bride, or gold diggers. Besides after meeting Malina, Kuzco learned one thing, as much as he liked things offered up to him he also enjoyed a challenge and a woman with a brain, it's what made the victory of winning her over that much more awesome in his head. And when Pacha opened his doors to him he introduced him to the whole village before school started, that's where he met Malina, that's where his attraction to her began. He has no idea how much he feels like he owes Pacha for everything. As the two finally made it to the hills where the village was located Malina started speaking. \"Hey Kuzco, I know you're all happy and in a good mood right now but I wanted to talk to you about what happened at school today, what was all that about?\" At that Kuzco frowned a bit and brought his arms from behind his head and folded them in front of him. \"I don't know, I guess I just got mad when Mr. Moleguaco said that another ruler of another empire felt that it was okay to drag us into her problems like she was in charge of us.\" Kuzco said. \"Kuzco come on, it's not like she's the one invading us, she just wants an alliance to help defend her kingdom.\" Malina said. \"Yeah, I understand what you mean, I just can't stand that Mr. Moleguaco had to put me in her shoes to try to help understand, you know I always thought I was doing a good job to help keep my kingdom guarded, no doubt that's how Empress Anacaona felt too before the attack.\" Kuzco said a small hint of sympathy in his voice. \"Don't take this the wrong way Kuzco, but even though we haven't been attacked yet, what have you done to keep the kingdom from getting attacked exactly?\" Malina asked. \"When I turned to twelve I started going to the war meetings held by the council, the general, lieutenants, and the captains of the army. Not much ever really want on there, it was mostly just talk on how to keep the empire protected, they always revised my dad's outlines and plans to help keep the kingdom guarded from invaders. I tried pitching in ideas every now and then, but hey who'd listen to a scrawny twelve year old right? The only time when one of my ideas was actually used was when I mentioned, why don't we set up a system of round the clock guards to check up on the perimeter of the kingdom and when invaders are seen one person would go back to inform me and the general while an entire group stays back to hold off the invaders for as much as they can until reinforcements come in. They actually liked the idea and they've been using it for several years now.\" \"Wow.\" Malina said, \"Wait a minute, even after so many years does the army still check up on your dad's plans?\" \"Yeah, usually, they sometimes don't listen to me as much, the first thing they taught me when I was finally old enough to understand was, that my dad was always right.\" \"Harsh, did they at least give you any chances to act like an emperor?\" Malina asked. \"Dad, set up a good and stable enough system in the empire so I could grow up comfortably.\" Kuzco said. \"Not to mention a bit spoiled.\" Malina murmured through the corner of her mouth. \"Heard that.\" Kuzco said. Malina growled a bit. Kuzco snickered and Malina turned back to smile at him. \"Yeah, I know I grew up like a spoiled brat, Pacha taught me that, then again I was also raised by Yzma.\" Kuzco said. \"Hmm… think you would've turned out better huh?\" Malina teased with a smirk. Kuzco shrugged shoving his hands into his hoodie pockets. \"Hm, go figure.\" Kuzco said. Malina laughed and Kuzco chuckled along with her. They both stopped in front of a small hut. \"Well,\" Malina said, \"tonight was a great party Kuzco, thanks, hope you enjoy the rest of your summer. I'm leaving the next day early in the morning to the Mayans.\" Kuzco frowned as the unfortunate news that Malina was leaving for the rest of the summer crashed down on him again. \"Wait do we have to say bye right now? You're not leaving till one more day!\" Kuzco whined. Malina sighed and said, \"Sorry Kuzco, but I'm packing and getting things ready the whole day tomorrow and I won't get the chance to see anyone after or during that.\" Kuzco let out a breath trying not to grunt in annoyance. \"Do I at least get a hug?\" Kuzco asked giving her his best puppy dog eyes. Malina sighed and stretched out her arms. Kuzco wrapped his arms around her waist and held her tight as did Malina around Kuzco's neck. \"Hey, you promise you won't fall for any Mayan nerds while you're over there?\" Kuzco asked while resting his chin on Malina's shoulder. Malina chuckled, and she and Kuzco let go of each other. \"Oh Kuzco, you never give up do you?\" Malina asked. \"Nope, not with you, can you blame a guy for trying?\" Kuzco asked. Malina chuckled shaking her head in amusement, Kuzco took this as a , no don't ever stop trying or no I promise I won't fall for any of them shake of the head. Malina then turned to enter her hut before turning around and said, \"Bye Kuzco, and goodnight.\" \"Bye Malina, and goodnight to you too.\" Kuzco said waving to her while one hand is in his pocket. Malina smiled and headed inside. Kuzco's other hand slid into his pocket and he sighed, he hesitated before turning around to walk away looking back at Malina's front door once before finally walking away. When Kuzco finally made it up to the top of the hill he entered the hut which was incredibly dark. Kuzco poked his head inside. He slid himself inside and started creeping in. \"Well it looks like everyone fell asleep.\" Kuzco said about to make his way up to his shared bedroom with the kids. \"Not everyone.\" A stern voice said and the sound of a flame starting up was heard. Kuzco watched as the flame lit up a small candle and was greeted with the sight of Chicha sitting on a couch in the living room none too pleased to see Kuzco at this late hour. \"Oh! Hey! Chicha!\" Kuzco said in his high pitched (crud I've been caught) voice. Chicha blew out the match and folded her arms looking at Kuzco crossly. \"Kuzco, you told me and Pacha that the party wasn't going to last long.\" Chicha said. \"Well can you blame me for wanting to throw a huge party for the first day of break?\" Chicha sighed placing her fingers on her forehead trying to hold her patience, as much as Kuzco was like a son to her, she didn't feel ready to raise a teenager she was barely raising her own younger kids. \"Kuzco, I understand, you're a teenager and you want to head out to have fun but you'll be graduating next year, and you need to start being more responsible do you understand?\" Kuzco sighed slumping his shoulders. \"Yes Chicha.\" \"By the way Kuzco, I wanted to talk to you about something, before you left for school today, you seemed so unlike yourself, was something bothering you?\" Kuzco was slightly taken aback by this. \"Uh, that was nothing really, don't worry about it.\" Kuzco said. Chicha laid a hand on his shoulder and said the same thing she said that morning, \"Kuzco you know you can talk to me and Pacha about anything.\" Kuzco shoulders slumped slightly and gently. \"It's really not that important.\" Kuzco said. \"Kuzco.\" Chicha said a bit sternly. \"It was just a bad dream that got me down, that's all, plus the storm.\" Kuzco said. \"A bad dream?\" Chicha asked removing her hand from Kuzco's shoulder. \"By any chance was this Yzma's doing?\" Kuzco chuckled. \"I wish, when it was the last day, she didn't pop out once, it was weird.\" Kuzco said. \"Hmm… so tell me about this dream.\" Chicha said. \"The dream?\" Kuzco asked. \"Yes, the dream.\" Chicha said and brought Kuzco to sit down. As the two sat Kuzco started explaining the dream albeit reluctantly. \"Well, it wasn't really a dream, it was more of a memory from when I was eleven.\" Kuzco said. \"Really?\" Chicha asked. \"Yeah… I remember, I was running around the halls and I heard several of the elder members of the council talking in one of the rooms, I wasn't twelve years old yet so I still wasn't allowed to enter those meetings yet. I heard them speaking pretty angrily to each other. At first I thought they were angry at each other, but it turned out they were expressing their anger over me. A lot of them were talking about how I don't deserve to be emperor, I'm just a kid without any honor. They also brought up my dad,\" At this Chicha's eyes widened. Kuzco never talked about his dad, or any family member for that matter, the whole kingdom knew of the disappearance of the previous emperor and the death of Kuzco's broken hearted mother recently after his disappearance, wait a minute… Kuzco's mother… this was the first time Chicha had ever referred Empress Chasca as Kuzco's mother. She should've known how hard it had been for Kuzco to grow up in that lonely palace. Chicha's eyes lidded down slightly feeling guilty while giving Kuzco a sympathetic look. \"They kept comparing me to him, that I'll never amount to anything like him, like he was born perfect and I was his hiccup of a son.\" \"Well that's just prejudice Kuzco!\" Chicha said cutting Kuzco off. Kuzco's eyes widened and looked at Chicha. \"They didn't even give you a fair chance!\" Chicha looked angry from the looks of it. She calmed down a bit and allowed Kuzco to continue. Well after that I remember getting angry, I wanted to barge in there and give them a piece of my mind.\" Chicha giggled, \" He sounds like me. \" She thought. Kuzco smiled when he heard Chicha chuckle. \"Then I remembered all the reasons why a lot of people don't like me in the palace and in the kingdom…\" Kuzco muttered the last part, Chicha frowned, at one point Chicha knew she had been the same, but hey the Emperor was incredibility young back then and after living with him for a year she realized he was just spoiled and immature who needed some maturing and proper life lessons, he missed out on a lot of childhood lessons and if she could go back in time and give the whole kingdom a piece of her mind that Kuzco was just not being given a stable environment like the rest of them to grow up happily and to properly run a kingdom she definitely would. \"And if I barged in their like the way I wanted to I would've proven them right, no doubt that would've satisfied them, then I thought to myself something I've been telling myself for a long time…\" \"And what was that?\" Chicha asked. \"I'm the emperor, people are supposed to satisfy me, not the other way around.\" Chicha blinked at this revelation, she didn't know what to say to that. \"Something I sort of kind of picked up from Yzma, she planted the idea in my head.\" Chicha scowled learning this, of course, Yzma, she was the one who raised Kuzco, she's the reason why Kuzco grew up so selfish and spoiled, who knows how many awful and selfish ideas she planted in his head. \"Kuzco, why did you trust Yzma so much?\" Chicha asked. Kuzco was slightly taken aback by this question, but answered anyway. \"Well, she was the only one who ever gave me attention at the palace, I thought she was the only person who cared about me there, well partly along with Kronk.\" \"Kronk? How long have you known Kronk?\" Chicha asked. \"He showed up as Yzma's assistant right before my dad left to sea, I never hung around him much mainly because the council didn't like the idea of a peasant boy hanging around the royal heir, so he spent his time with Yzma, most likely being brainwashed to help take over the throne and Yzma spoiled me like crazy to keep me distracted and kept telling me since I'm the emperor I could do whatever I want, I don't have to care about anyone, and I believed her. So obviously I was a little more attached and comfortable towards her than anyone else, besides after I've gotten to know Kronk a little better I kind of figured why she wouldn't want me hanging around him, he knew all her plans, he'd probably teach me right from wrong, I was attached to the both of them so it hurt badly when I found out they were planning on destroying me because what I said right before I discovered that, was that their whole world revolved around me, cuz that's what they made me believe my whole life.\" Chicha placed a hand over her mouth in shock, that was... CRUEL! Chicha was surprised Kuzco didn't have Yzma imprisoned for life. \"Anyways after I heard everything the council was saying behind my back through the door I got angry and stormed off. \"And is that where the dream ended?\" Chicha asked. Kuzco looked down and shook his head. \"I wanna say yes… the other part's kind of embarrassing for me.\" Chicha laid a hand over his. \"Nothing leaves this room Kuzco.\" Chicha said giving him one of her motherly smiles before removing her hand. \"Well I kind of went back to my room and started shouting at the ceiling… I pretended like I was talking with my dad, but I was angry, not at him but at… everything.\" I wanted answers and all I got back instead was a thunderstorm that night.\" \"So the thunderstorm from last night must've triggered that dream.\" Chicha said. Kuzco shrugged. \"Kuzco, I don't know what you went through growing up at the palace the way you did, but I hope you know the way they thought of you back then isn't the same way you're thought of in our home. We all know you're capable of great things, if that day hasn't arrived yet don't worry, it will, you just have to try and understand others around you a little better to achieve that, you've already come so far.\" Chicha smiled at Kuzco, Kuzco smiled back at her and wrapped his arms around her. Kuzco's whole life he'd been told his father expected great things from him, he even heard his father knew this, although, it was nice to finally hear it from someone else, in this case by someone who actually knows him personally and cares for him. Someone who actually believes it, and not just saying someone else did before. \"Thanks Chicha.\" Kuzco said, Chicha hugged Kuzco tight. \"I may get annoyed with you, but I do believe in you. Remember that.\" Kuzco nodded against her. The two soon let go, exchanged \"goodnights\", and the two left to their rooms as quiet as possible. XXXX Early that next morning, or should we say FLIPP'N DAWN ! There was a rapid knocking on the door of the hut waking nearly everyone up. Chicha nudged Pacha from behind her to get up and get the door, she was already too tired from waiting all night for Kuzco to return and having that conversation with him. \"Pacha! Go get the door!\" Chicha hissed her voice a bit groggy from sleep stupor. Pacha groaned and sat up on the side of the bed rubbing at his eyes. He left to go answer the door still in his pajamas. When he got to the living room he saw Kuzco coming down from the attic yawning and rubbing one of his eyes, also in his pajamas. \"Hey Pach, what the heck's going on?\" Kuzco asked in a yawn, the rapid knocking now felt like it was rocking the whole house making Kuzco and Pacha jump back. \"Oh man, pleases tell me it's not a stampede of demon llamas!\" Kuzco panicked now fully awake with his eyes wide. \"Don't worry Kuzco, I'll go check who, or what, it is.\" Pacha said walking up to the shaking door. Kuzco hid behind a piece of furniture afraid of what may be behind the door. Pacha placed his hand on the knob and twisted it slowly before opening it. Kuzco can be heard shivering from behind his hiding place. When the door was finally opened Pacha realized the person knocking on the door was a man in what looked like his late thirties, he was tall, muscular, and what really worried Pacha was that he was wearing an Incan army uniform. Pacha's eyes widened at the sight of the man. When the knocking of the door finally subsided, Kuzco peered out from his hiding place and saw the soldier from within the hut. The soldier pointed a scroll at Pacha. :\"Does Emperor Kuzco reside her?\" Kuzco got up and walked to the front door beside Pacha and said, \"Uh, yeah, that would be me. What do you want?\" The soldier eyed Kuzco before holding the scroll out to him. \"This just arrived from the palace,\" the soldier thrust the scroll into Kuzco's hands none too gently, Kuzco stumbled back slightly from the man's powerful strength, \"you are to attend a war meeting held tonight by your council, and the commanding officers of the army,\" at this both Kuzco's and Pacha's eyes widened, \"there you'll be discussing the alliance arrangements with the members in the war room and the Aztec Empress, Empress Anacaona.\" \"All those rumors about the Aztec Empire getting invaded and their Empress forming an alliance with our kingdom are true?\" Pacha asked. At that Kuzco turned to Pacha with a shocked face. \"Yes sir.\" The soldier answered. \"Wait that Aztec Empress is gonna be there! Why wasn't I told this five days ago?\" Kuzco asked. \"I'm sorry you're just hearing about it now, time is moving fast Emperor Kuzco. I'm afraid you'll only have today to prepare. Be sure to arrive at the given hour on the scroll.\" The soldier said before turning away. \"Wait a minute I'm not done talking here!\" Kuzco shouted at the man's back. The man turned to him and gave him a look, a look that clearly explained he has a low amount of patience at the moment. Kuzco had to keep himself from gulping as he saw the man's face, but decided to instead pull a very Kuzco like move and test this. \"My friend Pacha just said he'd been hearing rumors about this, exactly how long have these rumors been going on? Why am I just hearing all this in the span of two days?\" The look on the soldier's face turned into a glare and he grabbed Kuzco by his collarbone harshly causing him to drop the scroll he was holding. \"No touchy- OW! HEY!\" Kuzco yelled. Pacha tried to get in between the soldier and Kuzco. \"Hey, hey, hey! There is no need to be so drastic and aggressive!\" Pacha said. \"Stay out of this peasant!\" The soldier growled which was unfortunately directed at Kuzco face causing him to flinch and duck his head slightly. Pacha was taken aback by the soldier's angry growl and watched as the soldier's large hand grabbed Kuzco by the top of his neck, not choking him but strong enough to get him to look up at him and keep him from moving. Kuzco and the soldier looked at one another from eye to eye, the look on Kuzco's face clearly showed that he was terrified. \"Listen you whiny little twerp, maybe you'd gain some more information about the affairs of your kingdom if you paid attention to others around you every now and then instead of always thinking of yourself. You may say you've changed but you're still the same arrogant, dense, and self-absorbed, unruly emperor you've always been.\" Kuzco's glare was replaced with shock widened eyes as he looked at the fuming soldier in front of him holding him in a vice grip, in the corner of his eye he could see Pacha looking at the soldier in disgusted shock and could see a shocked and horrified Chicha standing at the entrance of the living room with wide eyes and a hand over her mouth, she must've barely entered the living room to find out what was wrong, only to find this shocking scene. With that said, the soldier threw Kuzco down to the ground harshly. Kuzco grunted as he hit the floor. \"Kuzco!\" Pacha and Chicha said simultaneously in worry. They both ran over to him helping him up. They both looked over to see the retreating form of the soldier at the doorway. Chicha's face was almost red with anger she walked over to the door grabbed a big rock and threw it at the man's helmet. Chicha smirked as she heard the satisfying raddle of the helmet and the soldier's pained grunt from the few yards he was away from her house. \"Nice throw.\" Kuzco said smirking up at Chicha from his sat up position on the ground beside a crouched and also smiling Pacha. Chicha smiled a bit before walking over to Kuzco replacing her smile with her motherly concerned look, she crouched down in front of him. \"Kuzco, are you alright?\" \"Yeah, I guess.\" Kuzco said his voice feigning confidence. Chicha stood herself straight her hands on her hips then looked to Pacha as the two of them stood up as well. \"Pacha why was that man here?\" Chicha asked. Kuzco looked around on the floor before finding the scroll. \"This is why.\" Kuzco said looking down at the scroll. Chicha held her hand out for the scroll. Kuzco and Pacha looked at one another before Kuzco handed her the scroll. Chicha looked at the scroll and her eyes widened in surprise. \"You have to attend a war meeting tonight?\" Kuzco nodded, his face a bit solemn. \"Yeah, my council, all of my army's commanding officers, and even the Aztec Empress Anacaona are gonna be there.\" Kuzco said. Chicha brought the scroll down looking at Pacha and Kuzco. \"So the rumors were true?\" Chicha asked. They both nodded. XXXX After the big fiasco that morning Kuzco had no other choice other than going over the scroll and prepare for the meeting that night. The scroll mentioned he was to be at the palace by six o'clock tonight. The guidelines of the war meeting were in the scroll as well. They were going to be discussing war layouts, strategies, weapons, training, etc. etc., however there was one thing that caught his attention. A Draft … The whole day Kuzco couldn't help but feel a bit infuriated about attending the war meeting. When he was eleven he wasn't allowed to go anywhere near a war meeting, that changed when he'd aged twelve. By then he'd basically become full fledged emperor, what irked him was that all his life whenever he'd attended anything that had to do with ruling his kingdom, his council were mostly just revising his father's plans for the kingdom, Kuzco's ideas were rarely if ever used let alone heard. By the time he'd turned sixteen Kuzco basically gave up and decided to rule and spend money however he wanted, resulting in Yzma's role in ruling behind his back. Several hours before Kuzco was to leave for the palace Pacha was outside tending the llamas. He wasn't sure how he felt about Kuzco attending the meeting tonight, he could only hope Kuzco had learned a thing or two from his schooling to help him in this sort of situation. However one thing that reassured him was Kuzco being completely focused on the scroll and preparing for the night. Of course Kuzco didn't start that on his own, Chicha and himself had to lay down the law to get him to focus, not too harshly fortunately. The soldier's words this morning, as harsh as they were rattled a few thoughts in Kuzco as well. Pacha patted Misty, his head llama's head as she grazed in the field. Luckily the storm hadn't destroyed his field or the pen that night. Pacha turned when he heard the swing of the gate. It was Kuzco wearing his usual green poncho with the red llama on it and red tunic beneath it, he was holding his scroll. Pacha gave a look of concern as he realized Kuzco didn't appear happy. Of course Kuzco was a bit of a handful when he was happy, that didn't mean anyone wanted to see him upset either, an upset Kuzco was completely unpredictable. Pacha watched as Kuzco didn't acknowledge him and came up at a post of the fence and sat down with his knees high and both arms over his knees. Pacha walked over to Kuzco and looked down at him. \"Kuzco is there something wrong?\" Kuzco didn't look up at him. He only turned away and shrugged. Pacha decided to sit beside Kuzco. \"Something you want to talk about? I know you didn't come out here for nothing.\" Pacha said. Kuzco was silent for a moment before speaking. \"I guess I'm just worried.\" Kuzco said. \"About the meeting?\" Pacha asked. \"Kuzco, I'm sure you'll do fine. And if you get stuck on something, try to pull something out of what you've learned throughout your school year.\" \"That's the problem.\" Kuzco said. \"I was actually planning on throwing out all my schoolwork at the end of the school year, but because of the party I had the other day I forgot, so I looked through all of it, I even tried remembering anything I've heard, both at school and during my time at the palace. And not one of thing talked about anything having to do with handling a war.\" Pacha blinked sympathetically, and laid a hand on Kuzco's shoulder. \"It could be because you're only a junior, most likely you were meant to learn this when you reached seniority... Remember you still have to take this seriously, think it through thoroughly… think of-\" \"What my father would've done?\" Kuzco asked, cutting Pacha off. Pacha's eyes widened slightly while removing his hand from Kuzco's shoulder before giving a shake of his head. \"No. I want you to think of how you think this situation should be handled. I know you're capable of making both good and the right choices.\" Pacha said. Kuzco looked up at Pacha with surprised eyes and blinked several times, then turned away scowling. \"Do you hear yourself Pach? It's like you don't even know me.\" Kuzco said. Pacha smiled. \"How did you save my life the first time?\" Pacha asked. The question took Kuzco by surprise and he glanced up at Pacha from the corner of his eyes. \"What does that have to do with anything?\" Kuzco asked. \"Just answer the question.\" Pacha said. Kuzco sighed and rested his chin over his arms. \"I pulled you away from crumbling cliff.\" Kuzco mumbled. Pacha nodded. \"Exactly, you acted on impulse because someone was in danger and you knew what needed to be done at that instant, that's an example of a good choice, that's when you showed me there is good in you. And the second time, you had to make a choice, between saving me and grabbing the potion that would turn you human again. Kuzco, when you chose to save me, I know that at the time that wasn't exactly the choice you wanted, but something in you must've told you to do it anyway. Why? Because deep down you knew it was the right choice even though it meant sacrificing something very important to you.\" Kuzco was staring up at Pacha from the corner of his eyes before looking straight ahead. \"Let's talk hypothetically then.\" Kuzco said. \"Let's say there's a neighboring kingdom under attack and their only option for help wants to refuse because the emperor next door doesn't like the idea of sending his army to risk their lives fighting for the lives of strangers.\" Pacha frowned looking at Kuzco. \"That's how you feel?\" Pacha asked. \"We're talking hypothetically here!\" Kuzco snapped. Pacha sighed while sitting back. \"Well then I'll give you a hypothetic response; A lowly peasant from the smallest, most unknown farming village in the kingdom found a crazy egotistic demon llama in a bag, who just turned out to be the emperor of the entire kingdom, he was so determined to get back to his palace he needed the assistance of the peasant, when the peasant refused he took off on his own and put himself in danger while walking through the jungle. Eventually the peasant realized he'd made a mistake by allowing a life to put itself in danger and came to the emperor llama's aid when he got attacked. That peasant put himself at risk because he knew he needed to do the right thing, which was doing something for the sake of someone else, in the beginning he and that llama were nothing more than strangers, but it was all worth it in the end.\" Kuzco's eyes widened when Pacha reached the end of his lecture. He wasn't harsh, if anything he was emphasizing a message, which unfortunately in Kuzco's case he received loud and clear. \"You forgot the part where the emperor was going to destroy the peasant's village.\" Kuzco muttered earning a chuckle from Pacha which Kuzco joined in with, before his face went serious again. \"So are you saying I should send the army off?\" Kuzco asked. \"I'm saying, as the emperor you should try and make noble choices. Choices that are both right and good. For all you know, it might all be worth it in the end.\" With that Pacha stood up and walked over to tend the llamas. Kuzco sat their watching Pacha for a while before getting up and reentering the hut and looking over the scroll in his room. The kids were outside playing fútbol (soccer) with their friends from their chipmunk campers group allowing him to focus, however Kuzco would do anything for a distraction at the moment \" How the heck is he good at this? \" Kuzco thought thinking of Pacha first.\" What would my own dad say at a time like this? \" Kuzco laid back on his bed as he tried to sort out the differences between Pacha and his father Ayar-Manco. Pacha lived in a world of with grey areas, and from what he was told about Ayar-Manco growing up he's sure he was a man of black and white. Heck, if he'd known Yzma would try to take over the kingdom and try to kill his son he would have fired her and possibly imprisoned her for life or burn her at the stake. Kuzco had indeed fired her, but she had also raised him since he was a baby, which put a restraint on his harshness toward her, if anything Kuzco believes he let her off easy, she was fired but still had a room at the palace, it was clear the only thing that drove her were money and power, and losing that privilege obviously caused her to take drastic and psychotic measures to try to re-achieve it. Speaking of Yzma where the heck was she? She normally tries to destroy him on a daily basis but the entire last day of school she's left him alone entirely, her daily announcements weren't even said that day, like she'd disappeared. Kuzco shook his head and unfolded the scroll and continued reading through the subjects the council will be discussing with him. The draft still irked him, drafting his people to fight for another kingdom didn't sound good to him. He also knew he had to consider the idea that if the Aztec Kingdom was destroyed the invaders would possibly continue down south into both Mayan and Incan territories. Kuzco's decision was everyone's, literally everyone in Mesoamerica's only hope. The Mayans were closer to the Aztecs, just a little northern up Incan territory, with the Aztecs right above them. According to the scroll the problem was that their territory was so small and defenseless they had no suitable army to join in battle against these mysterious invaders, however they were sending up a few of their best men to fight, now if the Incas decide to fight they'll be defending not one, not two, but three territories: Aztec, Mayan, and Inca. If they combine forces and defeat the invaders, his people will be looked up to as heroes, even himself for making this decision, but if they lose, worst case scenario would be dethroning Kuzco for making that decision in the first place. Kuzco covered his eyes with his palms and grunted in frustration. \" I hate Anacaona right now. \" He thought bitterly. He turned to his side on his bed and grabbed his Wompy. \"What do you think I should do?\" Kuzco asked it, \"You've never lied to me before. Unlike, Yzma and Kronk.\" He bitterly muttered the last part. As usual whenever he spoke to it Wompy never responds. He looked at the shiny button eyes of Wompy. Kuzco's eyes drooped slightly remembering his biggest Wompy, the one he's holding, was the one his mother had made him to keep him company while he slept as a baby, the other smaller (yet breakable) Wompies\" were built by the royal toy maker. Kuzco quickly stuffed his Wompy under his pillow when he heard the door slam open. \"Hey Kuzco. What you doing?\" Tipo asked as he walked in to grab a pair of gloves. \"Nothing. Just reading over important emperor stuff.\" Kuzco said. Pacha and Chicha had told Kuzco earlier not to mention anything about a war to the kids. \"Sounds boring.\" Tipo said. \"You have no idea.\" Kuzco groaned. \"I thought you were playing fútbol with your friends?\" Kuzco said eyeing Tipo's gloves. \"I am, I got switched to goalie. Everyone thinks I'm a better blocker than player.\" Tipo muttered. Kuzco sat up on his bed. Ordinarily Kuzco wouldn't care less but he wanted a distraction at the moment. \"How come?\" Kuzco asked. Tipo looked up at Kuzco surprised at the question. \"They say I dribble the ball wrong and can't control my aim when I kick the ball.\" Tipo said. Kuzco stood up and grabbed an extra soccer ball from behind the bunk bed Tipo, Chaca, and Yupi share. He tossed the ball at Tipo who grabbed it with his glove covered hands. \"Show me.\" Kuzco said. Tipo looked at the ball in his hands and dropped it the floor beginning to dribble it around the room. As Kuzco observed this he spotted the problem. He abruptly stopped Tipo with his dribbling and stole the ball from his feet with his. \"Hey!\" Tipo said. \"You're using your toes, that's the problem.\" Kuzco said. \"Huh?\" Tipo asked looking down at his feet. \"Here I'll show you.\" Kuzco said demonstrating several maneuvers on how to dribble the ball. \"You're supposed to use the inside and outside of your feet, if you use your toes you'll break your toes. Got it?\" Kuzco asked. Tipo watched Kuzco's feet observing the maneuvers and nodded. \"Yeah, I get it! Thanks Kuzco!\" Tipo said smiling up at him. He took the ball from Kuzco's feet ready to practice before Kuzco's voice made him stop in his tracks. \"Wrong.\" kuzco said. \"Huh?\" Tipo asked. Once again Kuzco snatched the ball from Tipo's feet and cockily smirked at him before saying, \"That's how you steal a ball.\" Tipo looked at the ball determinedly and snatched it from Kuzco's feet trying to copy how Kuzco did it and began dribbling around the room again. Kuzco watched noticing the improvement before Tipo tripped and fell over flat on the floor. Kuzco chuckled and found himself extending a hand out to Tipo to help him off the floor. Tipo accepted and stood with Kuzco's help. \"It's a little hard at first but you'll get better. \"Thanks Kuzco, think you could help me practice with that some other time?\" \"Well…\" Kuzco said. Tipo then clasped his hands together and looked up at Kuzco with his biggest puppy dog eyes. Kuzco caved. \"Fine!\" He said reluctantly. \"Cool! Thanks Kuzco! Well I better go.\" Tipo said before running out the room leaving the ball behind him. Kuzco smiled slightly before sitting back on his bed and looked over the scroll one last time. Kuzco began looking through all of Pacha's and Chicha's books trying to look for resources and information, the way how Malina taught him to search for information if he ever needed any. Chicha was a bit annoyed seeing the mess of cluttered books in her living room she quickly got over it when she spotted Kuzco reading, actually reading out of a political book. This was by far a mess that Kuzco has made that she wouldn't mind cleaning up after. When it was finally time for Kuzco to go, he tried delaying it by offering to clean up his mess of books, Chicha smiled at him knowing he was only making excuses and sent him out the door, she stopped him when she spotted something under his sleeve when it waved in the wind. She reached out and grabbed Kuzco's arm. She folded up Kuzco's sleeve ignoring his protests of, \"Hey, no touchy!\" Chicha looked at the writing on his arm. \"Kuzco what's this?\" Chicha asked sternly. Kuzco pulled his hand back and held it looking at Chicha sheepishly. \"Uh, notes, incase I need some more info.\" Chicha sighed and decided to let this one go, it wasn't like he was cheating on a test or anything, it's good to have extra resources of information at your fingertips, or in this case, on his arm, to help with serious situations, that's how real life works, you can't always rely on common knowledge. Chicha sent him off while giving him a reassuring smile. Kuzco walked past the llama pen where Pacha stopped him. \"Kuzco, leaving already?\" Pacha asked. \"Yeah, it says in the scroll since I'm living so far away from the palace I should leave two hours early and take the shortcut that was built.\" Kuzco said. Ever since they're adventure from when they'd first met, three separate roots were built from the small farming village to the palace, the four day path, the shorter but still long way, that would take eight hours to travel by llama, and the short cut Kuzco had insisted on being built that would take two hours by llama. \"Don't tell me you're walking all the way over there.\" Pacha said. \"I'll probably find a ride on the way there, the palace doesn't have enough time to send a ride for me right now.\" Kuzco said, with a surprisingly understanding voice. Pacha knew he was trying to avoid the meeting. \"Wait here.\" Pacha said, he walked over to the shed next to the pen and came back with a small saddle with reigns, he then gestured to one of the llamas and Misty walked over to the gate. Pacha opened the gate and guided Misty out. \"Here, why don't you borrow Misty for the trip?\" Pacha said. Kuzco's eyes widened. Of course he was used to taking Misty out on a small carriage with his friends sometimes, but he's never actually saddle ridden her. If anything being handed the reigns to ride a llama is the equivalent of being handed the car keys (that is if cars existed back then) and this was Kuzco's first time riding without any guidance from Pacha, Chicha, or anyone for that matter. \"Y-you sure?\" Kuzco asked. Kuzco stood beside Pacha as he set up the saddle on Misty. \"Of course, at this rate you'll get there faster.\" He handed Kuzco the reigns once they were attached to Misty. \"Wow, thanks Pacha.\" Kuzco said, feeling honored for once in his life. Of course he would've preferred the moment he gets to ride a llama alone any other time when he didn't have to travel for a war meeting. \"No problem, and good luck ok.\" Pacha said patting Kuzco's back smiling down at him, he turned to Misty and said. \"Be sure to take care of Kuzco.\" Pacha told the llama. Kuzco gave Pacha a questioning look. \"Uh, don't you mean I take good care of Misty?\" Kuzco asked. \"Yeah that, but trouble certainly has a way of finding you, so be careful, got it?\" Pacha said. Kuzco nodded. Pacha whispered one last, inaudible, thing to Misty before he turned around to leave for the pen again before Kuzco called out to him. \"Um, hey Pacha.\" Pacha turned back to Kuzco. Kuzco looked away seeming a little nervouse, before looking up and asked, \"Was it, you know… worth it in the end for you?\" Pacha smiled at Kuzco, and his only response was a nod, he finally turned to walk away, without saying another word. Kuzco smiled at the response he'd received for his question, before hopping one leg over Misty's saddle and sat down. He held the reigns tightly and used one hand to pat Misty on the neck softly to get her attention. \"So, you think you can take me…\" Kuzco hesitated before choosing his words carefully, \"to the palace, through the short cut?\" Kuzco asked her. Misty responded with a curt mwa and started off to the palace. XXXX The ride to the palace was peaceful to say the least, which made Kuzco a little uneasy, he had to admit all of Yzma's concocted schemes have actually made him a little paranoid when it came to peaceful moments. And whenever Kuzco got the chance to ask Misty if she were tired, or hungry and offered to take a break Misty stubbornly refused all of them and continuously walked the whole two hour voyage to the palace. … \"Are you sure you don't wanna take a break now? After two long hours of walking you've got to be exhausted, or hungry, thirsty? Anything? Hey I know, if you stop right now I'll even throw in a nice long relaxing day at the llama spa just for you.\" Misty ignored him, but Kuzco chose to respond anyway, \"What? They don't have those? Well then I'll build one, just for you and the rest of your little llama friends. What do you say, maybe take a five to six hour long break?\" Kuzco asked, Misty ignored him, and Kuzco slumped his shoulders and muttered, \"Okay, whatever Pacha told you must've made you act this way. Man, how the heck did he know I was trying to bail out? What I say?\" Then Kuzco thought back when he'd told Pacha about the palace not being able to send a ride for him on time, and he didn't complain about it like he normally would. Kuzco face palmed. \"Yeesh! Why do I have to be such a winey baby all the time? Pacha knows me way too well now.\" Kuzco said frustratingly while scowling to his left. It wasn't till Misty finally stopped that Kuzco jerked and looked to his right and spotted the large palace, a place he used to call home. Kuzco sat up straight while grasping Misty's reigns tightly and took a deep breath. He scowled over to Misty and said, \"Oh sure, now you stop.\" Misty, gave what sounded like a deal with it \"mwa\" sound to Kuzco. Kuzco reluctantly got off the llama and tied her reigns to the railing on the large staircase of the palace. \"Why am I tying you? It's not like you're going anywhere, considering you've made it obvious the only person you'll listen to is Pacha.\" Kuzco said as he finished tying up Misty's reigns to the railing. He looked up at the palace at the top of the staircase, \"Man this is the only time I've ever dreaded coming home.\" Kuzco said. He looked at the scroll. \"Well wish me luck.\" Kuzco said before hesitating and started his way up the staircase. Every little step up Kuzco was practically begging and praying in his mind to the Sun God for help, anything to either help him get through this war meeting, or anything to get out of it, Or at this rate, anything to prevent the draft option he'd seen on the scroll. The worst of it was, no one even knew about that part yet. Kuzco made it to the top and was about to push open the doors himself before they opened by themselves. Two blue and red painted guards looked at Kuzco oddly, as if they couldn't believe Kuzco was about to push open the doors himself. \"Oh right. I forgot I have people here to do that for me.\" Kuzco said, sounding a bit sheepish before entering through the doors passing by the two guards who were still perplexed. After eighteen years of opening doors for Emperor Kuzco, this was the first he nearly attempted opening a door for himself. \"What the hell has peasant life done to him?\" One of the guards asked the other. The other shrugged. As Kuzco walked through the palace he couldn't help but feel a change to the atmosphere. He looked around, the walls weren't bright, they were incredibly darkened due to the setting sun. The only thing that brought light indoors were a few candles attached to the walls. The cozy, comfortable feeling he was so accustomed to back when he lived here felt as if it had slipped away and replaced with a cold hollow feeling. Kuzco walked down a hall were he was greeted by one of his stressed and hurried caretakers who led him to his old wardrobe room to get him changed into his emperor robe, albeit hurriedly, and uncomfortably. Kuzco crown nearly fell off as he was pushed out the changing room and was led to another room guarded by two guards. \"Welcome, future Emperor Kuzco.\" One of the guards said who held his hand out for the scroll. \"Hey.\" Kuzco said and handed the guard the scroll. The guard opened the door and Kuzco entered. Inside he was met with the faces of serious and angry looking council members, guards, commanding officers, and the army general. All of them were definitely older than him and more experienced and knowledgeable of their positions. Kuzco also noticed a group of guards around a mahogany mobile throne with magenta veil curtains concealing whoever was inside. \"Glad to see you finally arrived Emperor Kuzco.\" Said General Rick, A.K.A Kronk's Papi! His voice was its usual stern and angry tone, maybe with a hint of anger and annoyance at Kuzco for showing up three minutes late. \"Hey, General Rick. How's Kronk?\"Kuzco asked trying to pass off as casua being slightly fearful of Kronk's Papil. \"You would know, last night he came home late from a party.\" Rick/Papi said, his voice stern. \"Why don't you sit down Emperor Kuzco?\" One of the commanding officers, Commander Aaron suggested. Kuzco complied and sat in his war meeting throne at the front of the meeting chamber. Kuzco eyed the mobile throne and the foreign guards wondering if any of them are going to speak first. General Rick took the liberty in getting the war meeting started. \"As everyone knows, the Aztec Kingdom has been invaded by unknown invaders only to be described as, cloaked figures with advanced weaponry unknown to our kind.\" \"Advanced weaponry? What do you mean?\" Kuzco asked knowing enemy weaponry is something that should be thoroughjly looked into. It was something he'd read in the books earlier and something he had written down on his arm. \"They are long, heavy as metal, glowing with light, and practically radiating with energy.\" A feminine voice said. Kuzco looked around trying to track the voice. A dark tanned feminine hand poked out from the end of the magenta curtain from inside the mobile throne. The hand delicately removed the curtain. Inside revealed a beautiful woman with long black hair. a large crown over her head, long feathered and jeweled earing hung from her ears, she wore a modest gold necklace around her neck, gold bracelets were worn on her right upper and lowere arm, she wore a golden yellow, with sapphire blue dress. She was sitting like any queen would on the throne, with poise and strength. The queen appeared twenty-one but was for certain in her mid-thirties. She gave a kind smile to everyone in the room before turning to Kuzco. \"Emperor Kuzco, I am Empress Anacaona, of the Aztecs-\" \"I kind of figured.\" Kuzco cut her off scowling at her. Anacaona was slightly taken aback at his rudeness but shook it off and continued. \"I understand this is… an inconvenience for you, to be dragged into a meeting like this before you even finish your studies at your school. But my kingdom, my people, are in need of assistance more than ever. These invaders, from what I had seen… they do not posses human like qualities. I came face to face with one myself when myself and my army were investigating an abandoned village. It attacked me. Its head shrouded its entire face in darkmess I could only see its eyes. Round eyes glowing yellow. Its entire body was hidden beneath a cloak, hood, and what looked like gloves and shoes made of an impossibly strng fabric.\" This new information grabbed everyone's attention especially Kuzco's. \" Inhuman qualities? Glowing weapons and eyes? \" \"In the last month, I've lost nearly half of my army to these invaders, my people have become homeless, many are becoming fearful to leave their shelters and begin production again, their going hungry. Bodies were found but not all of them, that's worrying me. What could those monsters be doing to my people? Emperor Kuzco, If we combine our armies together, we can be undefeatable against those invaders. We can save countless lives. \" \"Not to mention countless lives would also be lost. If my army gets involved we'll become a target too.\" Kuzco heard the sound of murmuring coming from his council and members from his army, commander Aaron was the only one who stayed silent. Kuzco's words however did not faze Anacaona. She looked at Kuzco dead in the eye and said. \"Your people are already a target.\" \"What?\" Kuzco asked confused. \"Emperor Kuzco, if you don't act now, once those invaders finish off my kingdom they will not stop there. Many of my best soldiers started tracking down areas of attacks, all returning with the same results. South. The invaders are headed south, and at the rate they're going they won't stop there. They'll continue heading south down to the Mayans, and then to you. That is where you'll be asking yourself where can you get reinforcements? You won't get any because they will all be gone. This is your chance to save your people beforehand.\" Anacaona gestured to Commander Aaron. \"As many of you well know Commander Aaron is an immigrant from the Aztec Kingdom, and respectively joined your army, leading and training one of the highest ranks you've got, he is here vouching for my claim of army failure and fatal attacks, he invited me here today in hopes to form an alliance with his home kingdom.\" Kuzco turned to Commander Aaron in shock. \"You invited her here to form an alliance without telling me first?\" Kuzco accused his voice quickly turning angry. \"Emperor Kuzco,\" General Rick said demanding Kuzco's attention to him, \"he consulted with all of us here individually first before inviting her here-\" \"What about me! This is my kingdom! I should've been at least told first hand before you guys decided to go a wol on me! Now you guys, gone and brought her hear deciding it's time to ask me permission when clearly you guys weren't looking for it in the first place.\" Kuzco said cutting General Rick off. \"This is exactly why we didn't discuss it with you in the first place!\" General Rick shouted losing his temper., \"You're nothing but a spoiled selfish brat, the exact opposite of your father and a disgrace to his name! You wouldn't spare a glance at anyone needing assistance if they won't benefit you.\" Kuzco's eyes widened in shock, his eyes then narrowed forgetting his fear towards General Rick for a few moments before speaking. \"You're one to talk. Kronk is exactly like that! Yet you're the one keeping him from being who he really is!\" General Rick was taken aback by this before flaring his nostrils in total rage before shouting, \"You unruly emperor, leave my son out of this!\" At this Kuzco angrily and back, \"I leave people you care about out of this when all of you start leaving my dad out of these meetings!\" Kuzco shouted, slamming the side of his fist on the arm of his throne before rising from it. Anacaona was taken aback by Kuzco's outburst raising her eyes at him, as did several of her guards. She gave a pointed look at General Rick and said in a scolding tone, \"Sir, you should know better. You must treat your emperor with respect.\" General Rick sat himself straight not daring to look at a smirking Kuzco in the eye. Anacaona then directed her gaze towards Kuzco. \"As for you. You do not demand respect, from your people, that is something earned.\" Kuzco looked at her before turning his head away. \" She sounds like Pacha. \" Kuzco thought bitterly. \"I would like an answer.\" Anacaona said. Kuzco looked up at her. \"Huh?\" He asked. \"I already told you my reasoning for wanting an alliance before you interrupted me. Are we in agreement? Or do you have a better reason to refuse my plea?\" Kuzco looked around. His council members and the top in command of the army were all boring their eyes at him. Kuzco didn't like this. The pressure. He's not used to it. Kuzco rested his elbows on his knees trying to keep his sleeve hiding the notes from slipping down. He rested his mouth behind his clasped hands in thought, feeling strands of hair falling into his face. According to the books he'd read at Pacha's house his father would do exactly as he'd anticipated earlier. He would agree out of the goodness of his heart. Countless lives would be lost, but countless others would be saved. His thoughts were interrupted when Commander Aaron spoke up. \"Emperor Kuzco. Please accept my apologies for not discussing this with you beforehand. When I had heard my native home was under attack I panicked. I have family over there. Only the Sun God knows what's happening with them.\" \"Emperor Kuzco.\" A council member spoke up this time. \"If I may, putting others' lives above your own is a step in the right direction to becoming an honorable emperor.\" \" Pacha said that to me earlier. \" Kuzco thought suddenly feeling miserable. Kuzco went silent for another few minutes now resting his forehead over his clasped hands deep in thought. When General Rick was about to interrupt him, Anacaona came up beside him resting a hand over his shoulder and shook her head. Everyone watched, Kuzco sneaked a glance under his sleeve making everyone think he was looking at his tell tale mark (the llama shaped birthmark) and caught sight of something he's written down. War strategy Kuzco still had his forehead resting over his clasped hands and swallowed before looking up. \"I guess I don't have any other choice huh?\" Kuzco asked. everyone shook their head. \"What would the strategy be then?\" Kuzco asked. The corner's of Anacaona's mouth twitched up slightly. \"Now we're getting somewhere.\" She moved to get seated back on her mobile throne and began explaining the story on how the invaders arrived. Kuzco made sure to listen intently far more than he ever had at school now that he didn't have his doodle notebook to distract him into making an idiotic doodle of Anacaona going on about the story. The story had actually peaked Kuzco's interest quite a lot. According to her, the invaders arrived from the sea, on large metal boats that seemed to be floating on water like magic. The doors weren't the traditional open in and out doors, they slid up open. Like secret openings you'd find in a temple. From where they were spotted they looked incredibly dark inside and no one was sure what was in them. At least five had arrived the first week of attack, after that more and more boats were arriving with more invaders on board. They stole resources, they destroyed villages and homes, like they were ransacking for something. Kuzco's stomach churned when he heard those invaders were killing and kidnapping people. Violence was nothing new to Kuzco, who knows how many people he'd thrown out these very palace windows for who knows what stupid reason. But as far as he knew, he'd never killed anyone. He's threatened people of course before then. His mind returned to the man pleading to Yzma for food for his family that day when he'd fired her, when Anacaona once again mentioned the starving villagers. That day Kuzco couldn't care less about the poor guy, after his adventure as a llama he remembered going behind the council's back and sent a small group of soldiers to deliver food to all the starving villages. Commander Aaron had been a part of that group now that he remembers. That must explain why he'd thought it was okay to go behind Kuzco's back and bring Anacaona here. Soon after Anacaona finished the story she started explaining a war strategy along with several of her guards who turned out to be soldiers from her very own army and had already gone through combat in the last few weeks. She mentioned how the Mayans won't be sending in an army due to their territory being too small and needing the protection. but will be sending some of their best men to fight, and with the help of a full army alliance with the Incas They'll have enough men to send off into battle at every location where attacks may occur and the strongest men from those units will be chosen to unite together to destroy the ships at the beaches from the inside out. Kuzco heard several of the members in the war meeting discussing that the army isn't that big to help with a plan like that. Kuzco felt a little relieved at that, someone else would have to tell her they can't help. Several others began coming up with different kinds of approaches. Kuzco did too while sneaking glances at his arm. They began discussing, warfare production and new machines and weaponry they can build, someone had even suggested Yzma's help, that plan was immediately shot down by both Kuzco and Rick. The war meeting began going on for hours, discussing, strategy, weaponry, resources, transportation, etc., etc, That's when it was said. Draft. \"We could initiate a draft.\" General Rick said. \"A draft?\" Severeal of the members of the war meeting murmured to one another. \"A- a draft?\" Kuzco choked out.\" \"Yes a draft.\" One council member said with a contemplative voice. \"-If we want any of these plans to work we'll be needing twice as many men.\" Another council member said. \"-Not to mention women, we'll be needing twice as many nurses too.\" A commanding officer pitched in. \"-Probably more.\" Another voice sounded. The idea about the draft got tossed back and forth around the war chamber, just as easily as any other plan that was thrown out there earlier. Kuzco began shaking his head. \"No!\" Kuzco shouted. \"A draft is where I draw the line!\" \"Emperor Kuzco at this point we don't have much of any other choice.\" A commanding officer said. \"We or her?\" Kuzco asked pointing a finger at Anacaona. Anacaona shook her head in annoyance. \"Emperor Kuzco, must I explain myself to you again? My kingdom is not the only one in danger here, yours and the Mayans as well.\" \"Well I can't just draft my people like that without so much as a warning. A lot of you guys are already discussing to conduct a draft tomorrow morning. \"Emperor Kuzco, a draft is our best option to be able to defeat those invaders and to prevent them from moving south.\" A council member said. \"If we just go in with the recruits we have, we'll have a higher chance at defeat than anything. \" General Rick said. Kuzco felt like a pile of bricks knocked the air out of him. He didn't want a draft. He knew what they were, completely random summons to join the army, any man ranging from a middle class village to a poor farming village. Last he checked nobles had immunity from drafts. Emperors are free to fight in battle as they please as long as they have an heir to take their place just in case –wait a minute… Farming village? Kuzco's eyes widened. \"I can't allow a draft. I just can't. Countless people would-\" \"Die? Emperor Kuzco that happens in war.\" General Rick said. \"Why don't we take a vote?\" Anacaona asked. \"You mean we vote amongst ourselves whether or not we have a draft?\" Commander Aaron asked. Anacaona nodded. Then without Kuzco's approval, she began speaking. \"All in favor for a draft?\" She asked. Kuzco looked around as just about everyone in the room rose a hand. He felt his heart pound against his chest. \"All opposed?\" Anacaona turned to Kuzco. Kuzco looked around as everyone in the room silently stared at him, none of which were raising their hands. Kuzco shakily rose his hand up looking around partly embarrassed and partly in fear. He was the only one opposed to the draft. General Rick looked to Kuzco before saying, \"Overruled, your highness.\" Kuzco looked down feeling a lump forming in his throat. \" Pacha's village… \" He thought, \" all my friends, and their families… \" Kuzco looked up forcing himself to look brave. \"Ok. If we're having a draft… then I want immunity to be granted to the farming village where I'm living at.\" Everyone in the room looked at him strangely, then a voice spoke up. \"Defending worthless peasants? Why did we even bother bringing you to this meeting?\" A voice called out. Kuzco looked up and saw the familiar face of the soldier who had delivered the scroll to him that morning. \"Lieutenant Rango.\" General Rick said. Kuzco looked up at the soldier in mild shock, he was the soldier who had delivered the scroll to him that morning. Kuzco's eyes widened. \"How's your head?\" Kuzco asked smirking while ignoring how strange the question may've sounded to everyone else. \"Better since this morning. No thanks to the village leader's wife.\" Lieutenant Rango said voice stern and annoyed. \"What did Chicha do to you?\" General Rick asked confused. \"I don't want to talk about it.\" Lieutenant Rango said rubbing the back of his helmet covered head. He turned back to Kuzco glaring at him before saying, \"Emperor Kuzco this is a draft, you can't ask for immunity on anyone-\" \"I can and I will!\" Kuzco said. \"That peasant village you disregard so much has done nothing but clothe and fed the kingdom for who knows how long, not only that they shelter and raise me better than the old hag Yzma everyone left me with. I can't pay them back for everything they've done for me by sending them off to war.\" \"Emperor Kuzco.\" Anacaona's voice was heard. \"I understand you feel an attachment to that village, but understand if you don't send them off now to protect their kingdom, who will protect them when there all that's left?\" Kuzco looked downnot wanting to imagine the consequence. He shook his head. \"No I just can't allow it. they're like family, I may not act like it but I know everyone in that village and they know me. There are two old guys who play a board game at the bottom of the hill who say hi to me every day when I get back from school. Many of my friends from school live there too. they'll never forgive me if I just allow their dads to head off to war. Then there's my friend Pacha- I can't send him off to war! Not after everything he's done for me!\" \"That peasant who thought it his business to come in between a quarrel amongst an Emperor and a Lieutenant?\" \"You were trying to hurt me, he was only trying to protect me!\" Kuzco shouted. \"I was trying to open your eyes to the real problems out there! That man should know his place! And so should you Emperor Kuzco! Remember you're an emperor he's a peasant. You rule, he serves.\" That last comment hit Kuzco close to home. His eyes glared down at him darkly. \"Lieutenant Rango, that's enough out of you. You're insulting one of my friends here too.\" General Rick said voice stern. Lieutenant Rango turned to General Rick, he looked down at him, something General Rick despised more than anything, before saying, \"If he's your friend then you should understand the sacrifices he should be making for his kingdom. If you must do it, why shouldn't he, especially during a time like this?\" General Rick's eye narrowed at Lieutenant Rango. Before anyone knew it, Kuzco lunged at Lieutenant Rango, making a sound that sounded like a war cry. Everyone rose from their positions in shock, including Anacaona who was just as shocked as everyone else. Her guards held her back in protection. \"Take that back!\" Kuzco demanded after knocking the man several feet back, which was impressive for a young man who'd never lifted a finger before in his life. When Lieutenant Rango refused to take his words back Kuzco's breathing went heavy with anger like a dragon's. He curled his hand into a fist and was nearly inches away from slugging Lieutenant Rango a new one, someone caught his arm. The arm with the ink written notes all over it. Kuzco's eyes widened. He looked towards the man who had stopped him, he half expected it to be General Rick or Commander Aaron. To Kuzco's surprise the man who had caught his arm was… \"Mr. Moleguaco?\" Kuzco asked in surprise and confusion. Mr. M. gave Kuzco a stern look before releasing Kuzco's arm. \"Kuzco. I understand you're worried for the sake of your friends. That's good. But understand there is a lot of truth to Lieutenant Rango's words, as offensive as they were, he's right. We all as a kingdom must do our part to protect it, and you of all people should be encouraging that more than anyone.\" Kuzco took the words in as he tried to take in the fact his school teacher had popped out of nowhere. \"What are you doing here?\" Kuzco asked. Mr. M. cleared his throat while straightening up his robe which became wrinkled while trying to stop Kuzco. \"I'm a head member of your council Emperor Kuzco.\" Mr. M. said. Kuzco looked at him oddly. He's been to hundreds of meetings concerning his council and Mr. M had never once been there, all though it could be possible that he'd missed him on several occasions considering he'd basically stopped paying attention after some time. \"Of course it makes sense that you didn't know that.\" Mr. M. said. \"I'd be even more surprised if you did. I rarely if ever come to the meetings, I spend most of time teaching and working at the school, putting my knowledge to some good use. And you being one of my students, makes it basically unnecessary to attend meetings at all. I'll basically just be telling you the same thing at the meetings that I would at school. I was there during your first meeting. Even the one when you made that brilliant suggestion.\" \"Did you agree to the draft?\" Kuzco ignoring all of Mr. M's words. Mr. M. turned solemn before nodding looking somewhat ashamed. \"None of us are happy about the draft Emperor Kuzco.\" Commander Aaron said. \"But we need all the reinforcement we can get.\" Kuzco looked down solemnly before saying, \"Who are we protecting if we're just sending everybody off to die?\" Anacaona had to turn away at this feeling guilty about the situation. \"Mr. Moleguaco. What's that on your hand?\" Lieutenant Rango asked. Mr. M. looked down at his hand that grabbed Kuzco's arm and noticed the ink stain on his hand. His eyes widened not expecting this. Kuzco's eyes widened as well. Lieutenant Rango grabbed Kuzco's arm and spotted the ink blot stain on his hand barely making out a few words. He used Kuzco's arm to thrust him back, Kuzco staggered slightly. \"You dishonorable Emperor! You should be ashamed to call you his son. You can't even come to a meeting prepared! You thought bringing in notes would dissolve the chances in initiating a draft. Like I said, if you would only learn to understand the world around you, you would have been better prepared for this meeting if you hadn't chosen to procrastinate and studying everything the last minute. Your father would never have behaved this pathetically.\" \"Leave my dad out of this!\" Kuzco snarled. \"Your dad would have immediately accepted the alliance, a draft wouldn't have bothered him so much, and we'd be saving countless people by now instead of wasting our time here with his hiccup of a son who'd rather protect easily replaceable peasants instead of those who really matter in this kingdom.\" \"Those people do matter!\" Kuzco shouted lunging forward again, only to be held back by both, General Rick and Commander Aaron. \"They provide food, clothes-\" \"-All, easily replaceable people.\" Lieutenant Rango cut off. \"Lieutenant you've said enough!\" General Rick said. \"But I haven't!\" Kuzco said angrily still trying to break free from General Rick's and Commander Aaron's grasp. \"I demand immunity for that village. They deserve better than the way you think of them!\" Kuzco shouted. \"Kuzo, you've said enough as well.\" Mr. M. said. Kuzco grunted while trying to break free. \"Fine!\" Kuzco shouted stopping his struggle to break loose and stood up straight,. \"Anacaona, you've got your alliance! We're going to save MesoAmerica!\" Loud cheering came from all over the room as Kuzco now posed the looks and attitude of a true emperor. \"All I want is immunity for Pacha's village. That won't change.\" The cheering died down at that. \"Kuzco…\" Commander Aaron began before being interrupted. \"Emperor Kuzco, I believe it's time for you to go home. With your approval this meeting has now been adjourned.\" Mr. M. said. Kuzco's eyes widened, he shook his head for the umpteenth time that night. \"What about Pacha's village?\" Kuzco asked trying to get everyone's attention back to the draft. \"We'll continue discussing that amongst ourselves. You go home to your peasant friend's cottage.\" Lieutenant Rango spat. \"No! I have to stay!\" Kuzco said as he fought his way out from getting escorted out the door by two of his own red and blue painted guards. Kuzco struggled to break free from his guards grips. Lieutenant Rango came over grabbed Kuzco by the shoulder sleeve of his red royal robe and threw him out the door. He unfolded the sleeve with ink stained arm. \"Your father would be ashamed to have you as a son. You're an embarrassment. Did you pull the same trick when you came up with that supposed brilliant idea all those years ago.\" He let Kuzco go and said, \"You may look like an emperor but you'll never amount to your father.\" Kuzco grit his teeth a heavy blender of mixed emotions blurring through his mind.. \"The village…\" Kuzco said weakly looking down at Mr. M. who was now standing by the door. Mr. M. gave Kuzco an apologetic look before closing the door while saying, \"We'll take it into consideration.\" Kuzco caught a glimpse of General Rick, and Commander Aaron, both of them giving him apologetic faces. Kuzco grabbed his arm and looked down as the door shut in front of him. \" What did I do wrong? \" Kuzco thought. He looked up glaring at the door determinedly, about to barge back inside before a guard grabbed his upper arm. \"Hey! What do you think you're-\" \"My apologies Emperor Kuzco, but we were asked to escort you back outside as soon as the meeting was adjourned. Kuzco pulled his arm out of the guards grip angrily before sayin, \"But the meeting's not over. They're still discussing things without me!\" \"I'm sorry Emperor Kuzco but those are my orders.\" \"No they're not!\" Kuzco said. \"I'm your emperor you're supposed to obey me! And I order you to reopen that door!\" \"You are not the emperor.\" The guard said. Kuzco's eyes widened yet again. \"W-what? What are you talking about? Ofcourse I'm your emperor!\" \"Not officially, at least not until you graduate next year. Until then my orders come from the highest members of your council and the army.\" A second guard arrived and gripped Kuzco's other arm as did the first guard with the free arm. They began escorting Kuzco outside the palace by force with Kuzco kicking and shouting angrily, demanding to be let go, to reopen the door, anything to go back and get immunity for the small farming village. Before he knew it he was thrown out the large palace doors and they shut behind him. His crown had fallen off and remained inside behind the 3 feet thick steel doors. Kuzco remained in his emperor garb. He stood from where he had fallen and looked at the door. He grew frustrated realizing there was no way back in. \" Mwa. \" The unexpected sound caught Kuzco off guard. He whirled around and saw Misty still tied to the railing. Kuzco hurried down the staircase and began unwinding the knot. \"Misty. I'm sorry. Please don't kick me in the shins or something.\" Kuzco said. Kuzco looked up at the sky. \"What time is it? We should go find you some food and water, let's go.\" Kuzco's voice turned solemn. He grabbed Misty's reigns and guided her around the city in search of a merchant, or anyone selling food for llamas. They're in the palace areas, meaning no nature, no grass or open water for Misty, everything had to be bought and sold. Kuzco brought Misty to an all-night llama station far from the palace where Misty happily ate grass and given water for the trip back. Kuzco bought off extra llama and human food to store for the trip. As soon as Misty was ready to go Kuzco hopped on and Misty took him to the outskirts of the palace areas. Kuzco Looked at all the paths offered to him. \"Misty, I'm sorry, I know you're probably tired but I can't face Pacha and Chicha right away. I don't care if it'll take all night. I want to take the long way, not the four day path, the eight hour one. Is that okay?\" Without hesitation Misty guided him towards the eight hour pathway as asked. Kuzco faced down as he started his journey back… Home...? XXXX A/N: Wooh! Finally finished. I can't wait to start writing the next chapter, I literally finished this one just now.

Hope you all enjoy reading! :) Italics: Thoughts Chapter 4: The Draft Kuzco guided Misty up the hill at the grey crack of dawn, his head hung low. He was long dressed out of his emperor robe and wearing his usual green poncho with the red llama, and red tunic underneath. \" What am I going to tell... \" Kuzco's thoughts trailed off as he spotted Malina's house on his way up the hill. \" At least she'll be leaving today. That's good… maybe she already left, I hope. \" Kuzco couldn't tell if anyone was home, ordinarily Kuzco wouldn't care about causing a scene in public, but by revealing news of a potentially impending draft meant trudging on dangerous territory. Kuzco had no other choice as one by one he passed by houses belonging to friends and neighbors. Guaca's house. Yatta's house. Kavo's house. Moxie's house. Ramon's mom's house. \"Kronk's Aunt Matilda's house where his brother Krank lives. Kuzco's eyes shut tight in anger. He looked down unable to imagine when and if his friends: Malina, Guaca, Yatta, Kavo, Moxie, and Ramon have to be told their fathers will head off to war. He could only imagine Kronk's Aunt Matilda's reaction when she hears her brother Rick and her nephews: Kronk and Krank will be joining in battle. And Ramon's mom when she hears her ex-husband will or might be drafted into the army. Kuzco doesn't know much about Ramon's family, all he knows is that his parents are divorced and his dad lives somewhere else in the kingdom. He and Misty made it up the hill and he guided her to the llama pen. He removed the saddle and the reigns and placed them over the fence unsure of where they go. He looked at Misty and patted her on her long neck. Thanks Misty.\" \" Mwa! \" Misty responed. Kuzco forced a small smile as he allowed Misty to find a spot to rest in the pen with the other sleeping llamas. Kuzco turned away and sighed. \"Pacha and Chicha are gonna kill me for getting home late.\" Kuzco sighed. He walked over to the fence and sat on the grass and leaned against it. Kuzco thought back on the war meeting. Kuzco felt his blood boil in anger and grunte he held his head in his hands in fruatration. \" Is this how Pacha felt when I told him I was going to build Kuzcotopia? What am I going to tell him and Chicha? The whole village? Heck! I don't even have any time to inform the entire kingdom! It's not like there's getting any out of it. Anyone who tries to go running will be arrested or killed for treason, and so would I for warning them. I would get dethroned... \" Kuzco leaned his head against the fence and looked up at the dawn sky. \" It's not like it's confirmed yet or anything. The draft's still gonna happen, but immunity for the village is still in consideration... I hope.. .\" Kuzco found himself nearly dozing off when the sound of Pacha's voice shot through the air. \"Kuzco!\" Pacha shouted. Kuzco jolted and looked up where the voice came from. \"What took you so long! How long did the meeting last?\" Pacha asked worriedly. Kuzco felt at a loss for words. At the look of shock on Kuzco's face, Pacha grew worried. Pacha knelt beside Kuzco. \"Kuzco what happened?\" Kuzco felt his lips trembling. He shook his head trying to rid the tremble. \"P-Pacha.\" Kuzco stuttered. He swallowed trying to control his voice. \"S-something's going to happen. I didn't ask for it! The meeting… they acted like I wasn't there. I was just a figurehead for them while they called all the shots.\" Kuzco paused for a moment, \"… We're going to war Pacha.\" Pacha's eyes widened, he looked like he'd gone a few shades paler. Kuzco's words began tumbling out of his mouth as he felt himself release so much suppressed panic from the last several hours. \"They gave me no other choice but to agree to everything! Lives are at stake and if we don't start fighting now we'll have no protection, no resources, no allies. The invaders are moving south, soon there won't be anymore: Aztecs, then Mayans, and then us. They didn't give me any other choice but to agree to an alliance. Not like my opinion mattered to them anyway. One of my own commanding officers went behind my back creating some sort of underground agreement with a few other members of the army and council to form an alliance with Empress Anacaaona without informing me.\" Kuzco looked down his shoulders trembling. He was about to mention the draft when Pacha's hand rested over Kuzco's shoulder. \"You tried your best Kuzco. This war won't be the end of the world.\" Kuzco shook his head at Pacha's words. Pach- that's not everything. Pacha's brows furrowed in confusion. \"What do you mean?\" Kuzco swallowed unsure whether or not he should say it. \"Kuzco, talk to me.\" Pacha said. Kuzco removed himself from Pacha's hand holding his shoulder and leaned against the fence. Pacha sat beside him. Kuzzco took a breath before speaking. \"What Anacaona told me, the invaders… they aren't ordinary. They came in large metal boats with strange technology never before seen by our kind.\" Pacha blinked in confusion by this. \"So they're some sort of advanced nation?\" Pacha asked. Kuzco shook his head with a shrug. \"No one knows. No one knows what they even look like, their entire bodies are covered in cloaks. Their weaponry is said to be so advanced they light up and are more powerful than what we have. What's strange is that they don't even sound like they're fighting for territory or conquer or whatever, Anacaona said they looked like they're ransacking and killing and kidnapping anyone who might have what they want.\" Kuzco hesitated before continuing, \"Anacaona said there're too many of them. It started out with five of their large metal transport boats, then more and more came carrying who knows how many invaders. Everyone in the war meeting gave me no other choice but to agree to an alliance to make the army stronger. The Mayans can't send in an army, they'll be sending in some of their best men., but…\" Kuzco brought his knees to his chest and held his legs close. Kuzco shut his eyes tight and grit his teeth, \"…but not even our own army will be enough people to fight them off. More and more ships are arriving every day and the invaders are moving south looking for whatever it is they're searching for. Kuzco turned his head tp Pacha, \"… They want to draft the kingdom Pacha…\" Pacha's eyes widened. He found himself looking over at his village through the gaps of the fence. Pacha shook his head. \"No...\" \"Pacha, I tried asking for immunity, they threw me out before they gave me an answer. I don't even know if they will or won't…\" \"Guess we'll find out won't we?\" Pacha said interrupting Kuzco, his voice blunt. Pacha stood, Kuzco did as well. \"Pacha? Are you okay?\" Kuzco asked worriedly looking at Pacha's back. Pacha faced down not daring to turn to Kuzco. \"Kuzco, I don't know what happened at that war meeting, and I really don't want to blame you either. The only thing that's keeping me from lashing, is knowing you tried to get immunity for this village. Let's both head inside and get some rest before, when or if, they arrive.\" Pacha began walking towards the hut. Kuzco mouth hung slightly agap not processing well what Pacha had told him. Kuzco ran up behind him. \"Pacha! Pacha wait!\" Kuzco couldn't help but feel like a llama again the moment he found out Yzma and Kronk were trying to destroy him and he went calling out to Pacha, at the time with no avail. Pacha stopped in his tracks. Kuzco haulted in his steps in a stumble. \"Pacha? Are you angry?\" Kuzco felt like a little kid for some reason. For some reason this man's opinion of him and his actions mattered more than anything. Pacha shook his head still hanging low. \"No Kuzco, I'm not mad… just disappointed…\" With that Pacha said nothing more and headed inside. Kuzco's eyes widened, he felt his breathing elevate. Kuzco ran back inside the llama pen and kicked the fence in anger. He grunted and got on his knees with gripped fists slamming onto the top of second wood post. \"Why didn't he just say he was mad!?\" Kuzco shouted. He brought his forehead on top of the sides of his fists almost in a praying position. Kuzco shut his eyes tightly in frustration. \"Sun God? Or dad. or mom? Anyone who might be up there! Please! Have the council and army leaders decide to give this village immunity!\" Kuzco exclaimed his prayer. Kuzco remained in his position for hours. The sun had risen considerably and was beating down Kuzco's back. Chicha looked out the window as the family began their breakfast and saw Kuzco in the pen. \"How long has Kuzco been out there?\" Chicha asked. \"You mean he never came inside?\" Pacha asked. \"Came inside? What are you talking about?\" Chicha asked. \"I saw him get here this morning. I told him to get inside to get some rest…\" Pacha paused in a frown, \"I may have said some other things… I should go talk to him.\" Pacha headed out the door leaving a confused Chicha inside. \"What's wrong with Kuzco?\" Chaca asked as she began eating her breakfast. \"Probably some emperor stuff. I saw him working on it yesterday.\" Tipo said. Chicha looked at Tipo her eyes widening. \"You did? What did he say?\" Chicha asked. \"Nothing. Why?\" Tipo said sounding confused. \"Mom, is everything okay?\" Chaca asked. \"Y-yes, everything's fine.\" Chicha said, she looked back at the window and looked at Kuzco's position. \" I hope… \" Kuzco was snoring. He felt pressure behind one of his shoulder blades, the unexpected shake surprised him. Kuzco's head shot up and hit it against the top third wooden post of the llama pen fence. \"Ow!\" Kuzco groaned rubbing the back of his head. \"Kuzco you okay?\" Pacha asked. Kuzco looked down unhappily before standing up and saying, \"Yeah, I'm okay.\" Kuzco leaned against the fence placing his hands the top of the third post looking anywhere but Pacha. Folded his arms over his chest doing the same as Kuzco for a bit before looking up first. \"Kuzzco about what I said earlier today…\" Kuzco shook his head. \"Pacha I get it, I messed up…\" He looked down as he said his next words. \"I'm not my dad. I try all I can but, in the end I'm just a scrawny kid who can't hold his own. If my dad wanted immunity he would've gotten his way. But I'm not him. …Y-you see…\" Pacha rose a hand up before he continued the same way he did when Kuzco tried apologizing to him as a llama for accusing him of things he didn't do. \"Kuzco I'm…\" Before Pacha could get another word out loud drumming was heard from the bottom of the hill. \"What's going on?\" Kuzco asked aloud. He and Pacha both looked over the fence down the hill. There was what looked like a parade of soldiers riding llamas drumming to a beat. Kuzco's eyes widened his mouth agap. \"No!\" Both he and Pacha hopped over the fence and went running towards the front of the hut. Chicha came running outside as well as soon as she heard the drumming from inside, she gestured the kids to stay inside. Chaca and Tipo were both holding Yupi's hands worriedly. Chcha shut the door in front of them. Chaca saw the look in her mom's eyes before the door shut all the way. \"Mom looks really scared!\" Chaca said worriedly. \"C'mom! We have to go see what's going on!\" Tipo said gesturing his siblings to follow him. They all ran up the stairs and climbed out their bedroom window. Chaca was careful with Yupi as they jumped down a safe spot on the roof to peer over to see what's going on. The whole village came out of their houses at the surprise. Kuzco Pacha, and Chicha and the rest of the village all looked at the soldiers on their six feet tall llamas. Two or four of them were carrying the Incan national flag. There were at least eight different soldiers. Three of which Kyzco knew on sight. General Rick, Commander Aaron, and Lieutenant Rango. Kuzco's blood ran cold at the sight of the third one. He glared heavily at him. Mr. M. came up on his llama in front of the other soldiers. Kuzco's eyes widened. Once the soldiers and councilman came to a stop where everyone in the village can see and hear them Mr. M. sat straight on his llama's saddle and began the announcements for the one thing Kuzco dreaded most. The Draft… XXXX \"Citizens,\" Mr. M. began, \"I bring a proclamation from the palace. The previous night our emperor to be, Kuzco, the Aztec Empress Anacaona, the kingdom's council, and head army leaders held a war meeting discussing an alliance between our kingdom, and the Aztecs. You are hearing here and now An alliance has been forged to defeat invaders trespassing onto MesoAmerincan lands.\" Mr. M. announced there were several gasps and a few cheers at the knowledge their kingdom will be assisting the Aztecs. \"By agreement of the council, army leaders, and Empress Anacaona, one man from every family must serve in the army!\" Kuzco's eyes widened as he realized Mr. Moleguaco left him out of the list. Hundreds of gasps were heard among the crowded villagers. Pacha's eyes widened only a bit not at all too surprised at the knews. Chicha let out a gasp and turned to Kuzco. \"Kuzco did you know about this.\" Kuzco looked at her and shook his head. \"No! I asked for immunity, they kicked me out of discussing the draft after I…\" Kuzco looked down. Pacha turned to Kuzco now interested on why the draft could've been prevented because of Kuzco. \"After you what?\" Pacha asked. Kuzco looked down feeling both ashamed and guilty. Kuzco didn't like these feelings. They didn't feel like him. Pacha and Chicha were both waiting for an answer, he had to speak now. \"After I had an outburst. I got so angry I tried attacking a lieutanent. Chicha gave Kuzco a face that resembled both grief and disappointment. She shook his head as she said his name in dismay. After the announcement from Mr. M. Kuzco was forced to watch as one by one neighbors and friends were forced to watch fathers, brothers, and sons get drafted into the army. Moxie, a supposed bad girl and straight A student of Kuzco Acadamy burst into tears as her father's name was called. He watched as Guaca's face downcast in sorrow and fear as his father's name was called. Kuzco shook his head not believing his eyes and ears. Kuzco's eyes narrowed down into a glare. \"They lied to me!\" Kuzco snarled. Kavo's father was later called after several men before him were called. Kavo's father was an elderly little man who could barely walk without a cane. Kuzco's eyes downcasted that not even the draft takes mercy on the elderly. Everyone watched in surprise as Kavo placed his large beefy arm in front of his father and said. \"Kavo will take place of father in army.\" Mr. M's eyes widened then half lidded in what appeared to be sadness feeling guilty to be sending in one of his own students into the army, however Kavo did volunteer. \"Very well.\" Mr. M. said reluctantly. Kavo was a big guy who tried beating up Kuzco once. He was large and strong, Kuzco already knew he would be useful to the army but his family was none too happy to see him grab the scroll originally meant for his father. \"Kronk and Krank!\" Mr. M. called out after several more names were called. Kuzco watched as Kronk and Krank's Aunt Matilda shed several tears at this, General Rick turned his head away unable to watch his two only sons grab the scrolls accepting their drafts to the army. Kronk and his brother joining the army was no surprise to Kuzco, part of him always knew they would follow in their father's footsteps someday. Kuzco knew Kronk, Krank, and Rick all live in a different village, Rick must've brought them over here to their Aunt Matilda's to say their goodbyes before the draft. Kuzco did feel bad for their Aunt Matilda who cared so much about the both of them. This must mean Kronk and Krank must've known ahead of time they was going to get drafted they didn't look at all fazed at the situation. \"Ramon!\" \"Ramon stood up straight and walked bravely towards Mr. M to grab the scroll. Ramon's mother was in tears as he walked away Ramon's eyes locked with Commander Aaron's for a split second as he eyed Ramon remorsefully as he walked back to his weeping mother. Ramon is old enough to join the army Kuzco wasn't entirely surprised he was called, what did surprise Kuzco was that he didn't feel like gloating that Ramon might never be seen again. Kuzco watched on as the sound of Malina's father's name was called after several other neighbors' names were called. \"No!\" A scream was heard. It was Malina! \" They haven't left yet! \" Kuzco thought. The next thing that was heard was the sound of Malina's voice. \"Mr. M.! I want to volunteer as a nurse!\" Malina cried out. Mr. M looked at Malina in shock and surprise as did many of the villagers. \"Malina? Are you sure you're up for the job?\" Mr. M. asked hesitantly. \"It's extremely intense and gruesome, who knows what you might see and what you'll have to do.\" General Rick said. Malina stood up straight and bravely and boldly said, \"I'm sure!\" Kuzco looked at Malina in shock. \"No.\" He whispered. \"I would like to volunteer as a nurse too!\" Moxie cried out.\" \"So would I!\" Yatta's voice shouted. Yatta's mom Mata pulled her back and whispered. \"Yatta! What are you thinking?\" \"Mama. Daddy died in war because they didn't have enough nurses to treat everyone, I won't let my friends have to suffer through that too.\" Yatta said. \"Ahem! Do we have a nurse or not?\" It was Lieutenant Rango who'd asked this. Mata patted Yatta's hand and frowned as she let go. Yatta turned around and looked Lieutenant Rango in the eye and said, \"Yes sir!\" \"Sir!\" It was the sound of a terrified and weak sounding voice that called Lieutenant Rango. It was Guaca. \"I would like to volunteer as a soldier!\" Guaca said trying to keep his trembling voice firm. \"No!\" It was Guaca's father who'd said this. \"Please don't allow it!\" Guaca's dad pleaded. \"Are you entitled to your decision boy?\" Lieutenant Rango asked using an intimidating voice looking down at Guaca with his shadow casting over both of them. Guaca looked up at him a bit terrified looking at the shaded face of Lieutenant Rango before forcing himself to nod, he was sorrowful but determined. \"Moleguaco!\" Rango called turning to Mr. M. who frowned not wanting to send off more of his students as he dug through the bag containing the scrolls and pulled out one nameless volunteer scroll and handed it to Guaca. Chicha covered her hand over her mouth in shock at this scene. Kuzco and Pacha both frowned. \" Is this what village teens do for their fathers? Join them in battle or go in their place? \" Kuzco thought observing a scene so forieghn to him. The next name that was called was like a blow to the chest for Chicha, the kids watching on the roof, and Kuzco. \"Pacha, the village leader!\" Everyone gasped. \"Dad!\" Chaca, Tipo, even Yupi cried from the roof top. They were so high up no one heard them. Pacha began walking up to Mr. M. to receive the scroll. At this moment Kuzco finally snapped. \"No!\" Kuzco ran up and spread his arms out blocking Pacha's path much to the surprise of Pacha, the soldiers, council member, and the entire village watching. \"I won't allow anyone in this village to get drafted! I asked for immunity, you all said-!\" \"We said we'll consider it.\" Rango cut off in a snarling impatient tone. \"As emperor I demanded it! That was an order! I allowed the draft as long as this village had immunity!\" Kuzco shouted. Before he knew it a heavy wooden stick was swung at Kuzco. Kuzco felt the stick strike his upper right arm and part of his back, knocking the air out of him as he hit the ground. He heard the villagers gasp and Pacha and Chicha shout out his name in worry. From the rooftop Chaca gasped and covered Yupi's eyes. \"Kuzco!\" Tipo cried. Pacha and Chicha hurried beside Kuzco as he tried to sit up gasping for breath. The end of the stick was brought to Kuzo's face in a threatening manner. Kuzco's eyes widened as he eyed it. \"Kuzco!\" Malina shouted. She was about to run up to him before her parents pulled her back. General Rick and Commander Aaron as did all of the other soldiers, villagers, and Kuzco's friends looked on in shock that a lowly lieutenant struck the emperor to be with a wooden staff. The end of the staff was still looming threateningly in front of Kuzco's face. \"We knew you'd never agree to this draft. You've already grown too attached to peasant life and those you live amongst. We figured the best we can do was lie to you.\" Kuzco grit his teeth and glared. He growled as he rose about to charge at Rango before Pacha and Chicha held him back. Kuzco looked up at Mr. M. still glaring. \"Did you know about this!?\" He asked. Mr. M's eyes were wide still shocked at what just occurred and shook his head. \"Pacha!\" Rango said sternly demanding the village leader his attention. \"I believe you have a scroll to receive. Mr. M. frowned as he had no other choice but to hand Pacha his draft scroll. Kuzco shot his hand out trying to reach for Pacha as Chicha still held him back. \"No!\" Kuzco said. \"Kuzco, it'll be alright.\" Chicha said. \"Pacha,\" Mr. M. said, \"since you are village leader, leading the village cannot go unattended. While you're away the council decided to leave village leading duties to the elder, Urkon.\" Pacha's eyes blinked. \"Urkon? Are you sure?\" Mr. M. nodded. Pacha let out a breath as he grabbed the scroll and walked back to Chicha and Kuzco, his back straight and braver than anyone else who has already received a scroll. \"No! I won't allow this!\" Kuzco shouted. Kuzco tried breaking free from Chicha's grip. \"Kuzco, there's nothing more you can do… it's done.\" Chicha said trying to calm Kuzco down. Kuzco broke free and ran up to the pathway where the llamas were riding away carrying Mr. M. and the soldiers. \"I won't allow this. I'll find a way to-!\" Lieutenant Rango turned around on his llama and pointed the wooden staff at Kuzco threateningly. \"To what little boy? Find immunity and save your friends? It's too late for that. You failed them.\" Kuzco was knocked to the ground by the end of the stick thrusting Kuzco in the chest. Kuzco hit the ground yet again. The end of the staff was this time stuck under Kuzco's chin and forced him to look up at Rango which was difficult to do under the glare of the sun. \"For an Emperor you're hella unruly! You're an embarrassment to royalty, by standing up for people as worthless as easily replaceable peasants!\" Rango spat. He jumped off his llama and intimidatingly glared at Kuzco. \"And for the record you are not the emperor.\" Rango turned around and hopped back onto his llama and rode off with the others. Kuzco looked down as the reminder of not being the emperor and not being able to control his kingdom's affairs or the army hit him again. Pacha and Chicha came up beside him and helped him up. Kuzco caught several looks from the villagers some angry, some confused, others who actually looked grateful for Kuzco trying to help them, even a few looked satisfied at the sight of Kuzco getting beat around for once. Pacha and Chicha brought Kuzco back to the hut once the village decided it was time to head in and shut the doors and windows for a moment of peace. Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi were already inside acting as if they hadn't seen the scene outside. Later that evening… Another summer storm was raging outside the hut like the night before the last day of school. Kuzco and his foster family were eating dinner in silence that evening. Kuzco felt his appetite slipping little by little as the guilt made his stomach feel sludgy. After the beating Kuzco received today Chicha and Malina, who'd come over had to nurse him back to health. There were a few bruises on his right arm and back when he was struck the first time and one on his chest where the staff had struck him the second time. Kuzco began to feel the silence weighing over thickly. Chicha had also felt the silence become tense she turned to the children and said, \"Kids, as soon as you finish go upstairs and head to bed. Chaca and Tipo nodded in understanding why, unfortunately they made it a little too obvious why. \"You heard and saw everything, didn't you?\" Chicha asked. Chaca and Tipo both nodded guiltily, even Yupi looked a bit guilty as he looked down. Kuzco wrinkled his forehead in anger as he looked to the side. \"Don't worry.\" Pacha said. \"Everything will be alright. I promise.\" Pacha looked at his kids showing so much bravery while displaying genuine promise. The sound of silverware clattering against a plate was heard from one end of the table. Everyone turned to look at Kuzco who had his hands clasped together and headed facing down at them, his hair blocking all traces of his face. \"This is all my fault. You shouldn't have to go Pacha.\" Kuzco said, his voice sounding nearly self-loathing. \"Kuzco...\" Chicha said trailing off. \"Kuzco, I know you tried your best but in the end we have to do whatever we can to help lives in danger. Even if it doesn't go the way we plan.\" Pacha said. \"But you-!\" \"I can handle myself Kuzco! You should learn to do that for yourself!\" Pacha said his voice raised. Kuzco was silenced at that. He stared at Pacha for only a few seconds which felt like hours for everyone at the table. Kuzco grit his teeth unable to hold his temper, what Pacha said hit close to home. He slammed the side of his fist against the table in frustration. \"This isn't right! They should've listened to me! They lied and disobeyed me! Now they're putting innocent people in danger! They're no better than I was…\" Kuzco said beginning to raise his voice as well. Pacha didn't like this and kept his voice raised as well. \"Kuzco you didn't get your way, that happens in life. You need to understand just because you're in line for the throne doesn't mean things are always going to go your way! Sorry Kuzco but this time you had no power over them… Y-you… you just weren't strong enough.\" Kuzco's eyes widened at this. \"You think I'm not strong enough to protect my kingdom?\" Kuzco asked. Pacha looked down then back at Kuzco about to speak. Kuzco shook his head looking at Pacha not wanting to hear what he had to say and ran out of the kitchen. The door to the hut was heard slammed shut. Pacha sighed placing a hand on his head before sitting down. Chicha had her hands clasped together under her chin unable to speak. She stood and asked her children to go upstairs to bed. \"Okay.\" They both said reluctantly.\" She lifted Yupi from his high chair who appeared stunned into silence by the intensity of the night, even at his young age he understood when things were going wrong. The kids all hugged and wished their father goodnight. Pacha held them closely, part of him believing it would be the last time he will. The kids slowly and reluctantly made their way upstairs to their shared bedroom in the attic. Chicha and Pacha watched their children head upstairs with unshed tears in their eyes. Chicha, still holding Yupi walked up to Pacha. He grazed his hand against Yupi's face affectionately and kissed him on his head. Chicha leaned up to him, Pacha held his wife close to him who rested her head on his shoulder. They stayed like that with Yupi slowly falling asleep between them for a long moment. Chicha broke the silence first in a whisper, careful not to wake Yupi. \"You should go talk to him…\" Chicha said as a suggestion. Pacha's head was against the side of his wife's head. He shook his head at her suggestion. \"I can't.\" He said. \"All the important stuff, can't be taught, sometimes he just has to learn…\" XXXX Kuzco sat on the fence of the llama pen watching the hut with longing eyes. For once in Kuzco's life he didn't care he was getting soaking wet in the middle of a cold summer storm. As much as Kuzco denied it for the past year he's been living with them, this was his home, these people are his family. He asked for immunity to protect them, yet in some ways it was still wrong trying to protect a small amount when there was a greater amount fighting for their lives. Kuzco didn't want to send Pacha out there, not after all he's done for him from the moment they met a second time, as llama and human. Kuzco understood Pacha felt like Kuzco had repaid his debt the moment he saved him from falling off a cliff and falling from the palace structure. But Kuzco didn't believe his debt was all the way paid. Those two times he saved Pacha didn't require Kuzcp to risk his life, of course one of them meant sacrificing an old life but they managed to pull through in the end and get his old life back. Kuzco thought back on the moment when Guaca and Kavo both volunteered to join the army, one to protect his own father, the other to stand beside him. \" Why would they do that? \" Kuzco thought. Kuzco had no father, he got lost at sea a year after Kuzco was born, he didn't understand the relationship fathers and sons were supposed to have. All Kuzco knew was that Pacha had been like a father to Kuzco for sometime now, he understood a father was there to guide you, protect you, advise you, raise you… but a son…? Kuzco didn't understand the meaning of the word son. They were all different just like fathers only more complicated. How are they supposed to repay everything a father does for their son? He knows that on certain occasions Tipo gives Pacha gifts. But that's child's play. Tipo's still too young, still under the guidance of Pacha too be able to fully repay what Pacha will teach him as he grows. Kavo chose to take his father's place in the army, Guaca chose to join his, Kronk and Krank are expected to follow in the footsteps of theirs' and joined their's. Kuzco was already grown, he may've not known Pacha for very long, but he knows he owes him for everything he's done. Pacha risked his life to get him back to the palace, in return, Kuzco saved him from falling off a cliff. That's one debt paid. Pacha taught him how to work as a team when both their lives were at risk, Pacha saved them both, in return Kuzco chose to save him instead of saving his ticket back to his old life. That's two debts paid. When Kuzco was throne out of the only home he's ever known, Pacha stepped forward and offered him a new one, a real one, with a warm family, good neighbors and friends as a bonus. In return Kuzco tried protecting it. That's a third debt… unpaid… Kuzco stared at the hut and waited until the final piece of candlelight from inside was blown out. Kuzco's eyes narrowed determinedly. Kuzco was expected to follow in the footsteps of his own father. Take his place in the throne. Bottom line was, Kuzco never met him. Never knew him. How can he? Kuzco knows Pacha, and owes him. Pacha, who is like a father to him, still had his family to raise. Kuzco couldn't allow it, to have Tipo, Chaca, and Yupi to grow up without him. To have an empty void where someone significant is supposed to be. Both Pacha and Chicha filled two empty voids Kuzco had. Kuzco couldn't tear them apart, not after the way his mother reacted when the news of his father's disappearance shattered her, he could only imagine how Chicha would react if this family lost Pacha. Kuzco shook his head. Pacha was too important, village leader, family man. Kuzco knew he had to save him, but how?\" … It was against the law for an emperor without an heir, to join the army. But like Lieutenant Rango said, Kuzco was not the emperor. Kuzco watched as the last candle light from inside the hut was blown away, darkening the whole inside of the hut. Kuzco rose from the fence, and hurried to get his new priorities done. And that's protecting his family. Kuzco snuck into his shared room where the kids, Chaca, Tipo, and Yupi have each already been laid to rest. Pacha and Chicha have already gone to their room, which Kuzco was grateful for being able to avoid them. The first thing Kuzco needed to do was grab his doodle notebook and hurriedly wrote everything he needed to write down in it. Kuzco didn't even bother to rip out the pages with his old doodles. As soon as he finished writing everything he needed to right down in it. He slipped the notebook under Tipo's pillow carefuly not to wake him. Next he grabbed his lucky golden llama comb (the one he used in the film) and slid it under Chaca's pillow. It was good a detangling hair and he assumed Chaca might like it for herself or for her dolls. The gift he was leaving for Yupi was a bit heart wrenching for Kuzco. He grabbed his big Wompy, the one his mother handmade for him, hugged it one last time and hesitatingly placed it beside Yupi who actually appeared to be having a bad dream, he immediately felt the soft object when Kuzco placed it beside him in his sleep and hugged it with all his little might. Kuzco felt tears stinging the corners of his eyes. He wiped them with the sleeve of his red tunic before they could fall. Kuzco watched as Yupi calmed down immediately. \" Take care of him Wompy, he needs you more than I do now. \" Kuzco thought as he watched his Wompy get held by a new owner Kuzco stepped away and hesitated turning around before looking back at all three kids he's come to think of as siblings before turning away and walking out of the room. He hurried into Pacha's and Chicha's room who were fortunately both fast asleep. Kuzco watched them as they slept for a moment. He remembered as a young child the many times he would wake up crying from bad dreams and run to his mother's bedroom for comfort. She was always alone, but always there for him. Then that day happened, when the news his father's ship was no longer being tracked and had gone missing, his mother's heart broke. He'd had a nightmare that night, he tried awakening her for comfort and she didn't she was still, absolutely still and cold as ice. He called out to anyone in the palace who would help him reawaken his mother. As soon as someone came to check on her they called a doctor, after her examination he was told she was gone. Kuzco didn't sleep at all that night Four months later on his sixth birthday Kuzco received a gift that was hidden in his mother's closet. He was told a very short man who was a head council member was in charge of organizing her things after her funeral and had found it and given it to Kuzco anonymously. On the card read, From: Mother To: Kuzco May your nightmares forever vanish . Inside the box was the original hand stitched Wompy. Kuzco recognized the stitching as his mother's handy work, considering the number of times he'd ripped his emperor robes while playing fútbol around the palace grounds. That very Wompy now had a new owner. An owner who received it with his parents still together when the original did not. Kuzco couldn't help but feel he was giving Yupi, Pacha, and Chicha the life he didn't have. Kuzco looked down. \" They're good people, they deserve it. \" Kuzco thought. He turned to the drawer beside Pacha and Chicha's bed. On it was an unlit candle and the draft scroll with Pacha's name on it. Kuzco gulped silently as he reached for it. He grabbed it and in its place left his half of his father's locket, just like Wompy, it was painful to let it go but he needed something significant to let them know Kuzco was gone. Pacha was the only one who knew about the locket so he'll recognize it immediately. Kuzco turned away ready to run out of the room before turning back and giving his guardians one last look. He gave them a small smile before turning away and heading out of the hut. The storm was still raging outside. Kuzco forced himself to the shed where Pacha stored everything important. At some point this place was of unimportance to Kuzco, who'd always assumed the shed was filled with Pacha's useless peasant junk, but now it must be the only place where he'd hide his army uniform. Around the hours when Chicha and Malina were nursing his bruises several more soldiers arrived during the afternoon when Kuzco was forced to take a nap, those soldiers delivered Pacha's army uniform which he would be taking tomorrow. He knew Pacha must've hid it in the shed so the kids woudn't see it. To Kuzco's annoyance the shed was locked. He turned to his side and rammed against the door with his non-bruised arm. He grunted as he barged against it. It was a bit painful but luckily the material wasn't sturdy enough and Kuzco managed to break the rusting lock and ram the door wide open. Kuzco fell inside and hit the floor. He got himself up quickly and looked around the shed. He spotted the uniform hanging on a wall. Kuzco walked towards it and looked at it. The military doesn't have time to customize armor and clothes to fit each individual so they all wear a one-size-fits-all uniform to Kuzco's convenience. Kuzco grabbed the armor and began the process of placing it on. It took him a while to figure it out before finally getting it right. Kuzco needed to remove his earrings they were too recognizable. He hid them in a box. Then there was his easily recognizable long shoulder length hair. He realized he may need to cut it, but there was no useful object in sight. However he found a piece of black rope in a box. He used it to tie his hair up, not in a ponytail but in a bun so small the rope managed to camouflage in his hair and gave the illusion of him having short hair. Kuzco found Pacha's bow and arrow and Misty's saddle and lifted them. The arrow isn't strong enough to cut his hair but the rope will be enough. Kuzco took the bow, saddle, and sack of arrows and rushed out of the shed. He made his way over to the llama pen. There all the llamas were seen fast asleep. He made his way where Misty was resting beside her daughter Fluffy. The white llama with the pink bow on her head. Kuzco once thought her to be a demon llama once, which technically wasn't untrue at the time. Kuzco felt guilty about this but Misty is the bravest and strongest llama there is. He awoke Misty who was startled at the sight of Kuzco in the army uniform, not recognizing him with short hair. Kuzco calmed her down before she could panic. \"Misty, I need you to do me a favor…\" Misty turned away about to lie down completely ignoring Kuzco before he spoke up again, \"Fine don't do it for me, but do it for Pacha, please?\" Misty stopped in her tracks and turned back to Kuzco. Kuzco reached out his hand to her. \"Please?\" He asked. Misty stared at Kuzco for a moment before looking down at her sleeping cria. She leaned down and nuzzled Fluffy with her snout. Kuzco heard Fluffy murmur in her sleep as she felt her mother's affectionate nuzzle. Misty stood back up straight and walked towards Kuzco. Kuzco patted Misty on the head and got to work on settling the saddle on her back. As soon as Kuzco finished he swung a leg over Misty's saddle, he turned back and took one last look at the dark hut and at Fluffy making a silent promise to return her mother back safely, however he made no such promise to everyone of clan Pacha that he'll return… ever. Kuzco yanked at the reigns and Misty took off out of the pen into the rainy night. Neither her nor Kuzco looking back. XXXX Tipo tossed and turned in his sleep rapidly, he quickly shot up awake with a gasp as a blast of thunder sounded from outside the hut however it was not the thunder that woke him. Chaca found herself awake the same moment Tipo had. Tipo rushed out of the room before Chaca got the chance to process what was happening, and got out of bed following Tipo in pursuit. Tipo wasted no time in barging into his parents' room and automatically exclaimed, \"Mom! Dad! Kuzco's gone!\" Both his parents sat up abruptly and groggily surprised at the exclamation. \"What?\" They both said confused. Pacha's eyes immediately widened as what Tipo had just said finally sunk in. He looked at Tipo and Chaca who were both standing at his and Chicha's bedroom door. Chaca was carrying a candle in her hands illuminating the room. In the corner of Pacha's eyes he caught sight of something glimmering from the light on the desk drawer. Pacha turned to the bedside drawer and caught sight of what could only be…- Pacha grabbed it hastily and looked at it in shock. Kuzco's locket! Pacha shook his head while staring at it in shock. \"He didn't…\" Before anyone knew it Pacha was hurrying out the door into the rainy night. Everyone hurriedly in worry ran out behind him. Pacha ran straight towards the shed. To his dread, it was already open and quite forcefully if you might add. Pacha looked inside. The armor, the bow, arrows, saddle, all gone. Chicha ran beside Pacha at the shed and to add to his worry she'd said, \"Misty's gone too.\" Pacha ran to the opposite side of the shed and ran out the path near the stable, there his children stood there staring at llama tracks disappearing thanks to the rain and mud. Chicha came up beside Pacha and caught sight of the disappearing tracks. She turned to Pacha. \"You have to go after him! What if he…\" Pacha shook his head solemnly, interrupting his wife. He turned to her and said, \"He broke a law. He's next in line for the throne, going off to war without an heir to take over for him… who knows what they'll do to him…\" Chicha covered her mouth and leaned her head on her husband's shoulder and let out silent sobs. Pacha held her close as he watched the llama tracks completely disappear from the muddy path. Chaca was frowning sadly as she watched the tracks. Tipo looked up at the sky and said, \"Sun God… please take care of Kuzco for us.\" A/N: Yahoo! First day of (Olaf singing voice) SUMMER ! The chapter's posted and I sent Kuzco off to war, wait no, that's not a good thing… whatever it's part of the story. Yep, this chapter definitely resembled Mulan but hey I told you guys that in one of my earlier chapter A/N's also I definitely feel like Tipo and Chaca have some sort of psychic abilities that were never expanded on in the series so I just had to add it here and maybe even Yupi has it, which obviously explains why he was having a bad dream he may've seen Kuzco's future or not. You'll never know. Hehe. JK, you'll all find out in due time. However I am going to get to work on the next chapter and remember in the first chapter how Kuzco was panicking about summer homework? Well guess what, it's real and I have to do it. :( Damn the IB Program! Anyway thanks for reading! Review and recommend please. Sincerely, \" SS8*[Chapter 5] A/N: To put it short major writer's block. I'm gonna say all of this now cause there's no time to put it at the bottom. Sorry for the long wait, school started :P. I hope you're all satisfied with this chapter, and please review and recommend. And when I say review I mean please tell me what you think. I love that you're all loving this story and always asking me to update soon, but I'd also like to know what exactly you think of it please. Disclaimer: I own nothing this is strictly for entertainment purposes or whatever. Chapter 5: The New Recruit It was dark… That was probably because the sleeve of the uniform was dark and thick, his left arm rested over his eyes as he rested on the ground in an open area of the forest. The last thing Kuzco remembered was that the storm grew heavy as he and Misty travelled overnight. A loud blast of thunder startled both him and Misty causing him to lose his grip and the reigns and her to run out of control in a panic. Kuzco slipped off the saddle and fell to the ground and Misty took off on her own. The pain from the beating he received from the day before returned leaving him feeling exhausted and unable to get up and follow Misty but he tried anyway. Falling off a speeding llama proved to be painful especially since he was still partially recovering. He remembered he'd forced himself to get up and search for her. It was too difficult with the pain and the heavy armor slowing him down. Kuzco motivated himself to keep going until he found her by reminding himself if he wanted to join the army he'd have to endure pain and get used to the thick and heavy black uniform which had heavy black shoulder pads, a shiny black chest plate, thick long sleeves a gold cloth design on the abdomen, thick black pants and gold and black boots . Kuzco has seen hundreds of army uniforms but he's never seen one with this kind of design. He figured it must be a new model designed to be thicker and more protective. Kuzco wandered for what felt like hours around the forest in the middle of a storm searching and calling out for Misty. He finally found her sheltered beneath a tree branch. Kuzco was filled with relief once he saw her but too exhausted to go up to her so instead he collapsed onto the muddy forest floor and rested. He saw Misty several times in his sleepy blurred vision as his eyes closed and opened over and over again, not seeing any signs of injury on her before finally closing his eyes and slept for the night. The reason he'd gotten so exhausted wasn't because of searching for her but because the adrenaline he felt when he chose to runaway finally drained from him and was replaced by fear and shock of what he'll put himself through putting him to sleep in order to relax. The next morning was hot, dry, and sunny. He removed his arm from over his eyes only to slam his palms ever his eyes to protect them from the blinding glare of the sun. Kuzco groaned and forced himself to sit up while rubbing his eyes covered with his hands. He blinked several times trying to adjust to the light. Misty walked up to him from her shelter and nudged him. Kuzco looked up to look at her. She was still wearing her saddle. \"You okay Misty?\" Kuzco muttered. Misty didn't respond. Instead she nudged Kuzco again and helped him stand up. Kuzco wobbled a bit but regained his balance. Kuzco took a breath and brushed off the mud from himself and the uniform. He felt the back of his hair and was relieved to learn the black rope miraculously kept his hair intact, still maintaining the short hair illusion. Kuzco patted Misty's head and walked around her. He grabbed onto the saddle and dug for the scroll in one of the hidden compartments he'd found. Inside the scroll was a hidden map leading to the training camp and the name of the man drafted. Pacha: Village Leader Kuzco blinked and faced down recalling the argument they'd had. He shook his head trying to discard the memory and looked around. \"Where are we?\" Kuzco asked looking around. He walked several steps around the area. He walked between several trees with Misty trailing behind him. No sooner than half an hour later Kuzco stumbled on a tiny cliff. He forced himself back grabbing onto two trees beside him and stared ahead. Beneath the cliff was a hill and at the bottom of it looked like the camp drawn on the map. \"We made it?\" Kuzco said in disbelief. Kuzco backed away from the site before he could get spotted and turned to Misty. \"Well I guess I better work on acting like a brawny soldier.\" Misty made several Mwa sounds. If Kuzco didn't know any better it looked as if Misty was laughing at him. Kuzco glared. \"Don't laugh at me, I know how to be tough!\" Kuzco said. Misty made a sound that sounded like clearing her throat and holding back more laughter. Kuzco scowled and puffed up his chest. \"What do you think?\" Kuzco said with his breath tightened. \"Ya' think this makes me look stronger?\" Misty closed her eyes and shook her head in disapproval. Kuzco scowled and toned his chest back down to size and folded his arms together. \"Well, what do you expect me to do?\" Misty trotted over to Kuzco and gave him a nudge. \"Hey, hey, what are you doing?\" Another (stronger) nudge. \"No- TOUCHY-EEE!\" Kuzco found himself stumbling back and rolling down the hill. He came to a stop mid-way with Misty trotting behind him. Kuzco landed on his stomach and lifted himself up with the palms of his hands. He turned to Misty behind him and glared. He sat on his knees and gestured at the camp at the bottom of the hill. \"You can't expect me to just GO there!\" \" Mwa! \" Misty nudged Kuzco again. Kuzco grabbed her snout. \"Oh no you don't!\" Misty pressed on and next thing they knew… \"Ahhh!\" Kuzco yelled and was once again rolling down the hill with Misty slipping on a spot of dirt and tumbling after. Kuzco landed flat at the bottom of the hill with Misty coming down beside him. Kuzco once again lifted himself up and sat on his bottom, with his knees sticking up, and an arm draped over them. He reached to the back of his head with his other hand making sure the black rope hadn't fallen off his hair. On the shiny, metal chest plate of his armor he was able to confirm his illusion of short hair was still intact. He draped his other hand along with the first over his knees giving Misty a scowl and muttered, \":Man if I knew it was that easy for a llama to force a human to do something for them I would've done the same to Pacha.\" Kuzco looked towards the entrance of the camp stood himself up. \"Well… looks like we're here.\" Kuzco puffed his chest up to make himself look more brawny and made his way towards the camp in what looked like a combo of marching and strutting. Needless to say, the llama did not approve of that either. (Back home…) That first morning for the members of Clan Pacha without Kuzco was… quiet… an unsettling quietness. Everyone ate without looking at each other. No one dared bring up Kuzco, it was hard, it was… strange, getting back to their old routine without him. A long time ago everyone would've appreciated the peacefulness without Kuzco, but this was different. There was however one question lingering in everyone's mind. Why did Kuzco leave? Did he leave cause Pacha got mad at him? Did he leave to prove himself worthy of protecting his kingdom? Did he leave to save Pacha? All of these being possible answers, the problem was deciphering which was the right one or if it was all three. For the moment at the table it was just Pacha, Chicha, Tipo, and Chaca. Yupi was still asleep in the kids' bedroom attic. The silence was interrupted with a knock from the door. Pacha and Chicha looked at one another worriedly. Had Kuzco been discovered already? Both Chicha and Pacha stood and walked over to the door. \"Who do you think that is?\" Tipo whispered looking at Chaca. \"I don't know.\" Chaca whispered back. Both children snuck over to the entrance of the kitchen and peered into the living room. Chicha reached for the knob hesitantly and opened it. There standing behind the door was Urkon the newly appointed village leader who was staring at Pacha surprisingly. \"What are you still doing here?\" Urkon asked. Pacha's eyes widened as he realized what he meant. \"Uh… well… you see…\" \"You should've been down at the training camp hours ago.\" Urkon interrupted. Pacha sighed and glanced at his wife before speaking. \"You see, here's the thing. Our oldest… nephew… showed up last minute and offered to…\" Pacha trailed off looking away feeling ashamed. \"Offered to take your place in the army. You tried to stop him but gave you no other option.\" Urkon sighed. \"I heard the same story from a neighbor claiming to have seen someone ride off with a llama from your hut last night, saying your nephew had shown up and left kast night. I didn't believe her at first but of course, it seems I've been proven wrong. Well, it looks like Kuzco got what he wanted, your safety. Although I can't say the same for your nephew.\" \"Our nephew will be fine, he's a tough boy.\" Chicha said with a sheepish smile. Urkon smiled. \"That's very good to hear.\" Urkon cleared his throat. \"By the way, the real reason as to why I'm here is to ask for the scroll document of leadership status.\" \"But since I'm here, that won't be necessary right?\" Pacha asked. \"No.\" Urkon said. Pacha and Chicha both blinked several times in surprise. \"What?\" Pacha asked. \"I'm sorry Pacha but I was officially appointed by the royal council, while you're supposed to be away, at least until the army returns or the war ends you will not be village leader, unless you decide to explain to the royal council of your predicament. They can locate him and have him confirm…\" \"That's fine.\" Pacha said interrupting Urkon. Both Chicha and Urkon looked up at him confused. \"I'll get you the scroll.\" Pacha turned away and walked deep into the home while Chicha stood at the front door with Urkon. \"What's going on?\" Tipo whispered to his sister still peering into the living room from the kitchen with Chaca. \"I don't know but I think dad just lost leadership status in the village.\" Chaca whispered. \"What! Nobody's a better leader than da-!\" Tipo exclaimed but Chaca covered his mouth with her hands. \"What was that?\" Urkon asked from the front door. \"Oh nothing.\" Chicha said calmly. \"Sorry, excuse my manners, would you like anything to drink, Urkon?\" Urkon shook his head. \"No thank you mam. However I would like to know about Kuzco. How is the boy?\" Chicha blinked several times taken aback. \"Kuzco? He's fine. He's been in bed all day yesterday and all morning today. He's still recovering from yesterday's… incident.\" \"Ah yes, I saw. And here I thought he would've been unconscious with only the first blow, but the boy showed so much strength and bravery. Very out of character from the scrawny cowardly emperor we all know. But you have to admit, despite going out of line it was very impressive.\" Chicha felt her stomach drop at this. It was impressive how Kuzco stayed firm after the first hit, however it was a bit strange yet relieving to see him handle that especially now that he's gone off to battle. \" Wait a minute… stepping out of line? \" Chicha looked up glaring angrily. \"Kuzco did not step out of line!\" She wanted to be the one to say it, but it wasn't her, it was Pacha. Chicha turned behind her to see Pacha standing there, scroll in hand, a scowl marred on his face. \"The one who stepped out of line was that lieutenant who struck our emperor to be when he was trying to protect, not only me but the entire village.\" Pacha handed over the scroll to Urkon. \"Here.\" He said. Urkon took the scroll and nodded. \"Alright, thank you.\" With that Urkon turned away and made his way down the hill. Chicha closed the door, Chaca and Tipo both came out of the kitchen. \"Mom, dad… what's going to happen now?\" Tipo asked. \"Everything's going to be alright kids, don't worry about it.\" Pacha said. \"And Kuzco?\" Chaca asked. Chicha knelt down to be eye level with the kids. \"Kuzco will be alright. He's gone through worse than this. All those times he's been turned into an animal he still pulled through, remember?\" The kids smiled at this. \"Mama, papa?\" A little voice called. Everyone turned to the staircase spotting Yupi holding onto Wompy. Chicha walked over to Yupi and lifted him up. \"Good morning Yupi. What are you doing with Kuzco's Wompy?\" \"No, not Kutsco Wompy, mine- pwesent.\" Yupi said. \"Present?\" Chicha asked. Pacha's eye widened at the sound of that. He took out Kuzco's golden locket from his pocket and looked at it. \" Present…? \" ( Camp) As Kuzco marched/strutted through the camp he looked around seeing all the men, several he recognized from his village, and others who were from different villages from around the whole kingdom, mostly peasants, minus nobles. \" Ok, I made it inside, what now? \" Kuzco wondered glancing around observing all the new recruits. They were behaving in ways Kuzco had to assume was manly. There already several men engaging in fights with one another testing their strength. \"Ok Misty, let's go look for registration.\" Kuzco sighed as he tried to avoid the recruits. \" Mwa! \" Misty said. Kuzco turned around walking backwards to face Misty. \"What you think they'll recognize me? Look at me. My hair's tied up to the point where it looks short with the black rope, and this armor adds a good five pounds, it looks like added muscle. Trust me no one's going to recognize me.\" \" MWA! \" CRASH! Kuzco hadn't been watching where he was going and tripped over a small pile of equipment sending him tumbling aimlessly and crashing into another recruit. \"Ow!\" Kuzco groaned rubbing his head while sitting up on the ground. \"This is seriously the third and hopefully last time today I hit the ground.\" Kuzco groaned. \"Hey, you!\" Kuzco yelped as a large hand hauled him up from the ground holding him in a vice grasp. Kuzco found himself face to face with Kavo, of all people he could've run into. Kavo was wearing the same armor as Kuzco but on him it looked far more menacing. \"H-hey… uh…\" Kuzco had to keep himself from saying Kavo's name like he recognized him. \"Listen… buddy, I didn't mean…\" \"New scrawny recruit smacked into Kavo. Kavo's gonna teach you a lesson.\" Kavo said in his deep, blunt, choppy voice. Kuzco gulped and forced himself out of Kavo's grip and quickly ducking down before he could land a punch on him. Kavo found himself punching free air. He looked down and caught sight of his new foe on the ground. He growled internally, he bended forward aiming another fist at Kuzco. Kuzco shielded his face afraid to run until someone else's hand got in the way of Kavo's large beefy one. Kuzco's eyes widened at this. He placed his hands on the ground as he looked up to see his savior. \" Guaca? \" Kuzco thought in disbelief. \"Kavo, relax. Put your hand to the side, close your eyes and find a happy place.\" Guaca said. \"Hm?\" Kavo questioned, his hum sounding like a growl with his deep voice. Kavo slowly put his arm to the side, has hand stil gripped in a fist, he closed his eyes. \"Good.\" Guaca said, \"Now start taking even breaths and regain some peace with yourself.\" Kuzco raised a confused eyebrow at the scene as he stared up at Guaca (who too is wearing the uniform) and Kavo. Kuzco noticed Kavo started taking even breaths through his nose, looking as peaceful as if he were asleep. Kavo opened his eyes and Kuzco shrunk away fearing Kavo may've not calmed down. \"Feel better?\" Guaca asked. \"Hm.\" Kavo responded. That must've been good enough for Guaca. \"Scrawny recruit not worth Kavo's time.\" Kavo said. Kuzco let out a breath of relief. Guaca extended a hand out to Kuzco. Kuzco took it and stood up. \"My name's Guaca, this is Kavo. Who are you?\" Guaca asked. \" They really can't recognize me. \" Kuzco thought. \" Name? Oh man, I haven't thought of one yet! \" \"Hey!\" Kavo said. \"Scrawny recruit was asked for name. Answer!\" Both Kuzco's and Guaca's eyes widened as they realized Kavo's anger from earlier hadn't entirely withered away. \"Uh…?\" Kuzco thought as he tried to desperately think of a name. Any name! Kavo growled at his silence and in his fit of anger threw another fist aiming at Kuzco, he quickly managed to duck out of the way again, unfortunately the fist ended up colliding with a passerby and accidently knocking him down. Kuzco's eyes widened as he realized who that passerbyer was. The general's youngest son Krank! \"Whoops, sorry Krank.\" Kavo said. \"Hey! Watch who you're aiming that!\" Krank said as he stood up ready to pound Kavo. Kavo grabbed his fist and swung him in Kuzco's direction. Kuzco jumped out of the way as Krank tumbled down. Krank stood up glaring at Kuzco he then pointed at him. \"You're the one he was after aren't you? You let me take the hit!\" Krank said. Kuzco's eyes widened. \"Get him!\" Kavo said. Both Krank and Kavo charged towards Kuzco who had no other choice but to run away. \"Hang on you guys! You shou-!\" Guaca shouted unable to complete his sentence as he took off after the three of them. Kuzco was chased through the camp as two maniacs and one semi-peacekeeper charged after him. Kuzco's breathing staggered as he called out for Misty. \"Misty! Where'd you go?\" Kuzco shouted. Kuzco hid in a tent. And watched as his three pursuers passed him. Kuzco let out a breath of relief. \"And here I thought Kronk's brother would be more like him.\" Kuzco muttered. Kuzco heard a loud commotion happen outside startling him. He poked his head out of the tent and saw the three other boys had made a mess of the supply tent in what looked like an accident. Several other soldiers were lying on the ground. Every one of them began sitting up in annoyance as they spotted Kuzco. They all saw the commotion with him happening earlier, making everyone believe this was all his fault. Kuzco stepped out of the tent and gulped as Kavo and Krank both stood. Krank pounded his fist against his palm as Kavo glared down at him darkly. Now Kuzco had a large crowd ganging up on him. Kuzco started backing away nervously. \"Hey, guys…\" Kuzco said sheepishly. XXXX Unbeknownst to them Mr. Moleguaco and Lt. Rango observed the whole thing. Lt. Rango looked down at Mr. M and told him. \"Make a note of their behavior.\" \"Sir, I'll have you know I know how to do my job per-\" Mr. M cut himself off as he noticed the anger in Lt. Rango's face. Mr. M. gulped and did as he was told. The two headed inside the general's tent behind them. In there General Rick and Commander Aaron, who is representing the Aztec army by instead of wearing the gold designs wore red instead. He'd been positioned as General Ambassador in the Aztec Army by Empress Anacaona, but still a speaking commander in the Incan Army, in the tent both Generals were discussing strategies among each other with Kronk present in the room watching silently. When Lt. Rango and Mr. M entered Commander Aaron looked up and asked. \"Has my son arrived yet?\" \"We still haven't caught sight of him sir.\" Mr. M said. \"Howevere…\" \"I'm over here.\" A voice interrupted. Everyone turned to the opposite entrance of the tent and spotted Ramon clad in the black Incan armor, wearing the exact same gold design but instead in red like the commander. \"Glad your finally here son, come here we could bring you up to speed with our strategy.\" Commander Aaron said as he gestured his son to get closer. Ramon got closer to the table where a map of Meso-America was laid out. He stood no where near his dad much like Kronk was doing with his own. They both had different reasons for the distance but everyone chose to ignore it. \"According to Anacaona and the message we received from her general this morning, the invaders have struck here and here.\" General Rick stated as he pointed at different areas in the Aztec areas of the map. \"Commander Aaron and I will be leading two groups north of Mayan territory and pick up half of our allies as we pass there.\" \"From there we'll split as General Rick continues through Aztec territory and meet with our Aztec Allies before they destroy the next village on the Aztec map.\" Explained Commander Aaron. \"I'll be left behind training the other half of our Mayan Allies until our new recruits here are ready for battle and we'll all rendezvous in the Mayan training camp and set out towards Aztec Territory to back up General Rick and his men.\" Commander Aaron added. At this both Kronk and Ramon looked up at their fathers wide eyed with shock. \"And who do you guys suggests stays here to train the new guys huh?\" Kronk asked. \"When these new recruits are ready you'll both join us… captains.\" General Rick said looking at both Kronk and Ramon as he said this. Ramon's and Kronk 's eyes both widened at this news. \"Captains?\" Kronk said in disbelief. Ramon looked between Commander Aaron and General Rick. \"You guys are making us captains to these guys?\" Ramon asked. \"Trust me, neither one of us ever believed we'd have to announce this to you two.\" Commander Aaron said. \"Well especially you Kronk.\" General Rick said. \"I know you never wanted this life. But now isn't the time to try and get out of it.\" Kronk looked down feeling slightly ashamed. Lt. Rango and Mr. M watched this scene, one in disbelief and the other in full fledged anger. \"Are you two sure about this!? Why not position a soldier with more experience…?\" Lt. Rango didn't get the chance to finish when General Rick cut him off. \"Lt. Rango, both these boys are highly strong, skilled, and intelligent young men when it comes to military training. Not to mention, they have more patient personalities when it comes to teaching and training others. You on the other hand have a short temper and personality not equipped to train beginners. Your only assignment is to make sure none of these new recruits go awol and to lead them towards Mayan territory when their training is done.\" \"So you're leaving me with baby-sitting duty?\" Lt. Rango asked, anger in his tone. \"Listen if the boys feel it necessary to have your service while training for any reason, that'll be up to them. In the meantime just keep an eye on them.\" Commander Aaron said. Lt. Rango glared down at them holding in a growl. General Rick and Commander Aaron turned around to the boys behind them. \"We have to go now, we trust you two to train these recruits well.\" Commander Aaron said. \"We'll be expecting a full report from Moleguaco in two weeks.\" General Rick said. Kronk, Ramon, and Mr. M. all nodded. Everyone but Kronk and Ramon walked out the tent leaving the two young men behind. \"Captains…\" Ramon said. \"Yep.\" Kronk said. Ramon looked up at Kronk. Ramon gave a smirk and said. \"Don't worry my friend, we could do this, just imagine, when we return home, people will be cheering our names as leaders of Inca's finest warriors.\" Kronk gave a smile. \"No, the greatest warriors of all time.\" Kronk said. Kronk and Ramon fist bumped each other and made their way out of the tent along with the others. General Rick and Commander Aaron had already mounted their tall llamas, aside from that, what really awaited the two young captains outside was the last thing they expected from their soon to be \" greatest warriors of all time \". Outside looked like what appeared to have been a battle mixed with a twister hitting their supply tent. \"Very impressive.\" Lt. Rango muttered sarcastically. Mr. M sighed as he had no other choice but to mark down what he'd just witnessed. General Rick and Commander Aaron laid one hand on one of their sons' shoulders before wishing them luck. Neither boy replied as they stared on at the shocking scene before them. Both men removed their hands and rode off with their llamas signaling the real warriors waiting for them to follow pursuit of them. Both young captains took a deep breath while internally wishing their dad's good luck, neither daring to voice it out loud. Both captains returned their attention to the new warriors or what they should really be calling them, maggots. \"I feel as if we've been punked.\" Ramon said folding his arms over his chest. \"Yeah, how do they expect us to turn that.\" Kronk said pointing at the scrambling and fighting new recruits, then pointed at the real warriors riding away on their llamas in the distance, \"into them?\" Ramon sighed. He stepped forward in front of the crowd before calling out, \"Warriors!\" Everyone in the crowd immediately stopped their fighting and stood up revealing someone on the ground and pointed at the fetal positioned young man shielding his head with his hands and arms, he looked to be about Ramon's age, but a lot smaller. \"He started it!\" They all called out. Kronk and Ramon raised an eyebrow. Both not believing that little fellow could've been able to have caused this whole mess. However everyone else seemed to believe it. Kronk decided to be the one to approach him. When Kuzco heard the shout, \"He started it!\" he felt a large shadow begin to loom over him, he uncovered his hands over his head and peeked up. \" Kronk? \" Kuzco's eyes widened and stood himself up while brushing off dirt from his uniform. He faced Kronk and noticed the unhappy look on his face. \"Listen maggot. We don't need anyone causing trouble at this camp.\" Kuzco's eyes widened as he noted the anger in Kronk's voice. \"S-sorry, 'bout that.\" Kuzco stuttered in fear, while trying to disguise his voice. \" \"What's you're name maggot?\" Kronk asked abruptly. Kuzco's eyes widened. \" Is Kronk like this with the Junior Chipmunks? Man I feel bad for them. \" \"Uh, uh, uhm…\" Kuzco stuttered having forgotten the part he still hadn't come up with a name for himself yet. \"Your commanding officer just asked you a question.\" Kuzco found himself face to face with an annoyed Lt. Rango. \" Crud! Not this again! And this guy again! \" \"I've got a name.\" Kuzco said, \"And it's a peasant name too.\" Kuzco grew silent as he tried to think hard for a new name. Ramon watched from eside Mr. Molequaco. \"Poor maggot. Looks like he's never been scolded a day in his life.\" Ramon said. \"Hmm.\" Mr. M. thought as he watched the scene. Kuzco rubbed the back of his head still trying to come up with a name. \" Cory? No. Junior? No. Alex? No… \" \"Any day now little boy.\" Lt. Rango said lifting one end of the staff at Kuzco face. Kuzco eyes crossed looking at the same staff he was struck with the other day. \"My name's uh… Kuz-… on?\"All the heads of Kronk, Rango, Mr. M., and Ramon tilted to the side in confusion. \"Kuz-on?\" Kronk asked confused while Lt. Rango's eyes widened in surprise. Kuzco nodded vigorously affirming his new name. Ramon turned to Mr. M. beside him. \"Is that even a name?\" Mr. M. responded with a shrug. \"Yes, my name is Kuzon.\" Kuzco said determinedly. \"Let me see your draft scroll.\" Ramon said coming up holding his hand out for the scroll. Kuzco handed it over. Ramon opened the draft scroll and read it over.\" \"Pacha?\" Ramon asked. \"As in thee Pacha? Village leader Pacha?\" Kronk asked. \"The Pacha with current guardianship of Emperor Kuzco?\" Lt. Rango asked. \"I had no idea Pacha had an older son.\" Mr. M. said. Kuzco nodded at everything except for Mr. M's statement. \"I'm not Pacha's son. I'm his nephew who just came back from visiting the Mayans last week. When I heard about the war I took it upon myself to take Pacha's place.\" Kuzco said. \"Hmm… Clan Pacha or Kuzco haven't said a word about a returning nephew named Kuzon.\" Kronk said. Kuzco's face downcasted slightly at the sound of being excluded from Clan Pacha. \"They don't talk about me much.\" Kuzco said sheepishly while picking up an arrow from the ground twirling it and accidently pricking his finger with it. \"Ow!\" He said. \"We could see why, Clan Pacha are masters of archery, this boy looks like he's never handled a weapon before in his life.\" Mr. M. said. Ramon shook his head and stepped forward facing the new maggots. \"Alright maggots. Thanks to your new friend, Kuzon ! Today you'll be reassembling and reorganizing the entire supply tent. Then tomorrow the real training begins.\" Ramon said with a voice that spoke more with authority than its usual charm and charisma earning him a crowd of groans than the usual cheers he'd get at school. \" How's Ramon a captain all of a sudden? Kronk I get but… \" Kuzco stopped his thoughts short and noticed the difference between their uniforms. \" He's… wearing red… \" XXXX The Village: That same day back at the village, Pacha and his family tried to get back into their old routine before Kuzco had moved in. It was difficult herding the llamas without Misty but Pacha understood Kuzco needed her more than he did. After all Pacha had another llama just as good as Misty. He only hoped they'd both return home safely. Things just weren't the same without them and everyone noticed. \" Mwa! \"It was the sound of a young cria's cry. Pacha turned around to see Fluffy, Misty's white cria with the pink bow on her head wandering around the pen in the middle of a crowd of other grown llamas, most likely in search of her mother. Pacha walked up to the small cria and pet her on the head. \"Don't worry Fluffy. Your mom will come back. Kuzco wouldn't let anything happen to her. I'm sure of it.\" \" And Misty will look out for Kuzco too. That's what I asked her to do… \" When Pacha's daily rounds were done he went back home. The minute he entered through the door, Chaca and Tipo were racing down the stairs. \"Dad look what we found!\" They both cheered. Chicha came out of the kitchen to see the commotion. \"What's going on?\" She asked. \"Look at these!\" They said. Yupi looked up from his coloring on the floor with Wompy observing him at his side. \"What are they?\" Pacha asked. \"We found them under our pillows. Look it's Kuzco's doodle notebook.\" Tipo said. \"And his golden llama comb.\" Chaca said. \"He left those for you?\" Chicha asked. \"Yeah I guess.\" Chaca said looking down. Chicha sighed. \":Kuzco's coming back, and before you know it he'll be slamming open that door asking for his stuff back.\" Chicha said. \"You really think so mom?\" Tipo asked smiling at her. \"I know so.\" Chicha said gathering her children in her arms. \"Did kuzco write anything in the notebook?\" Pacha asked kneeling in front of his wife and kids on the floor. Chicha let go of Tipo to allow himto open the notebook. Tipo flipped through many of Kuzco's useless and hilariously drawn doodles before making it on the final page of his doodles. The pages after the last doodle were filled with pages with words and drawings explaining and demonstrating several Fútbol maneuvers and techniques. Tipo smiled with tears pricking the corners of his eyes. \"Kuzco's not letting me down.\" Tipo said. \"What?\" Chicha and Pacha asked. \"Kuzco told me he'd help me improve my Fútbol techniques this summer. I guess this is his way of him being here for me.\" Pacha, Chicha, and Chaca all leaned over Tipo's shoulder to observe all the drawings and explanations Kuzco left for Tipo with smiles. Chicha rubbed Tipo's head with her hand as Tipo continued to flip through the notebook. When he made it to the end of the training exercises there was a letter. The family was now all over this. Tipo handed the notebook to Pacha for him to read out loud. Hey, everyone of Clan Pacha. I'm sure you've all noticed by now that I left and took Pacha's place in the army. Just to let you guys know I don't regret my decision at all even if it gets me into trouble later. I promise to return Misty home to you and Fluffy as safely as I can. But I won't be making any promises about me. I want to let you all know that I'm doing this to fix my mistake and to repay my final debt to you all. Also because, I know I've never said it before out loud but, you're all like family to me, I know what it feels like to watch your family get torn apart for something you didn't cause and I couldn't stand by and let that happen to any of you. I've been an unruly ruler long enough. It's time I learn where I stand. I'll miss you, Kuzco A/N: Thanks for reading. Sincerely, *SS8*[Chapter 6] A/N: Just to let you guys know, this story is not finished yet, and yes, for those of you who have seen the cartoon, Avatar The Last Airbender, yes I did borrow the name Kuzon from the episode The Headband . Only because it sounds similar to Kuzco. Disclaimer: I don't own The Emperor's New (Fill blank here) franchise what's so ever.

Chapter 6: Spirit Guardian Somewhere up in the heavens a message… a prayer, got through to a mysterious power worshipped by all the Incas. The prayer was small, yet heavy with light. If you lay a hand upon it you can feel the depth on how heartfelt and selfless the prayer was. That very heartfelt and selfless prayer is meant for the sake of someone else committing another selfless act. Those are one of the few most beautiful forms of prayers this mysterious power has ever been honored to witness from beyond the Earth. This young mortal man whom another mortal boy has chosen worthy to pray for is no ordinary human. The family of this young mortal was hand chosen by this mysterious power, generations ago, to rule an Earthly empire full of loyal worshippers to the mysterious power above. The one who filled the Earth with light. Now a descendant of the great line of royalty is in grave danger of losing his forefathers' throne if this prayer is not granted. The mortal boy who sent this prayer holds the young royal in high regards not only as ruler but as family and friend. Four more prayers ascended to him bearing many similarities to the first sent by the young boy. Together they grew strong and were determined to be granted together. The mysterious power gave heed to the prayers knowing he cannot ignore the strength of those prayers combined. He summoned a spirit to aid the young royal on his quest to protect those who prayed for him, however he cannot guarantee the royal will be returned home to them the same. Village: The family of Clan Pacha was bustling about at home trying to keep their minds off Kuzco. Which was easier considering all of Kuzco's friends were never coming around because they were all participating in the war effort so no one in town ever really asked about him, believing he was sick. The only times he was ever brought up was when someone else would bring up the subject of his actions the day of the draft. However no one ever included anyone from Clan Pacha in the conversation. That topic spread around like murmured gossip with people turning away from Pacha and/or Chicha and would silently murmur it while receiving angry and dirty looks from Pacha and Chicha. One day when Chicha was delivering fruit around the village she came across Matilda(Kronk's aunt)'s house, she greeted her with a warm smile and invited her in. \"Hello Chicha how are you?\" \"I'm… fine Matilda, thank you for asking, and you how are you holding up about your brother and nephews?\" \"There tough men they can handle anything that comes their way. To be honest it's Kuzco I'm worried about. Would you like some tea?\" Matilda headed for the kitchen where Chicha followed her in confusion. \"Kuzco? What do you mean? This conversation has nothing to do with him.\" Chicha said feeling slightly nervous. \"Do you like yours with cream, sugar?\" Matilda asked. \"Matilda.\" Chicha said, her voice coming out stern trying to get the older woman's attention. \"You're lucky Urkon came to my house first asking for directions and I just happened to have mentioned he'll be seeing Pacha in his home because I witnessed a young man, quite possibly a nephew of yours riding off to the training camp wearing the assigned armor. That probably got him off your back's about why Pacha is still here and hasn't pressed the subject since he took charge of the village.\" There was a look of shock and horror on Chicha's face before she started speaking. \"It was you? You were the neighbor he was talking about? How did you know we would even use the same excuse? Why haven't you reported it?\" Chicha sat down trying to take even breaths as she tried to calm herself down. Someone knew the secret and though Chicha liked Matilda she felt like she couldn't trust anyone in town anymore considering how they've been disrespectfully talking about Kuzco behind her and her family's backs. Matilda sat beside Chicha. \"Chicha calm yourself. I won't be telling anyone. I swear. I only chose to tell Urkon what I said, because I knew you would use the same excuse. Everyone in town knows you don't have an older child so I figured you'd say he was your nephew, and the mere fact that I mentioned it to Urkon before he got to you confirmed it, especially since you confirmed it without practice means he won't be badgering you and your family about him. Like his name, where he came from. He'll only be focused on running the village instead of exposing you. Chicha regained her breath back. \"Matilda, thank you. You have no idea how much we appreciate your help.\" Matilda smiled and nodded. She made her way to the kitchen to get the tea and handed one to Chicha to relax her. Chicha was letting a few stray tears run down her face as she and Matilda sat at the table drinking their tea. \"Chicha, I understand the pain knowing a loved one has put themselves in danger for war. I won't lie, it hurts the worst and is far more frightening the first time their gone.\" Chicha nodded while whiping away her tears. \"Keep Kuzco in your prayers and he'll be fine. I doubt the Sun God granted an impact like Kuzco to your family only to rip him away from you once you've developed a bond.\" Chicha took a breath. \"It wasn't the Sun God who thrust Kuzco into my and my family's life. It was the selfish acts of a greedy old woman and the kindness of my husband's heart why Kuzco became part of our lives at all. From before he even moved in we were friends. Just friends with him. We'd visit the vacation home he built on the hill next to us, we'd visit him at the palace, he'd invite us to wonderful dinners, we'd go see amazing parades in the noble areas of the kingdom. After he moved in that bond shifted, and he became part of the family he became less like a friend that our family enjoyed to hang out with and more like a son who needed guidance, teaching, and overall raising. We just thought he had a fun personality for a time. He turned out to be very immature, self absorbed, and spoiled, (she definitely learned what her husband went through traveling with him, he could've warned them first) and though he got on my nerves I never wished any harm to him, and the thought of kicking him out of the house never crossed my mind. It never felt like the right thing to do, I'd feel like I'd given up on him. I would never do that to my own children, and at some point Kuzco became mine and Pacha's son,\" the tears were welling up in Chicha's eyes. \"I don't see why he feels the need to…\" Chicha covered her face a started to silently sob into her hands. Matilda stayed with Chicha the whole afternoon trying to help her get through the pain and fear. Meanwhile back at the house Tipo was reading Kuzco's instructions trying to work on his techniques. They were helpful and at times even filled with funny stories. One of them even read. If Tipo didn't get a certain technique down right the first time to not worry about it, there had once been a time when Kuzco damaged property around the palace while practicing with his ball as a child. There was even a time when Kuzco was pretty sure he chipped one of Yzma's teeth when he'd accidentally kicked a ball once to her face. That got a chuckle out of Tipo. It was nice knowing that he and Kuzco weren't that much different at the age Tipo is now. It makes him feel closer to his friend. Though it would've been nice if Kuzco had been here to teach him himself. He took his ball to try kicking the ball into the net in single kick. Chaca was there posing as a goalie. He planted his feet to the ground hunched his shoulders he ran forward and kicked. The ball went flying at Chaca who barely missed the ball as she tried to catch it. It flew beneath her arms and hit the back of the goal net as she landed on the ground. \"I did it?! Tipo said. \"I did it! Chaca did you see that!\" Tipo asked excitedly. Chaca smiled crouching on the ground. \"Yeah.\" She got up and walked over to him and grabbed the notebook while flipping through the pages. \"You'd make Kuzco proud.\" \"You think so?\" Tipo asked. \"Yeah. I'm sure he would be.\" From within the house Pacha watched his children with a small smile from the window. Pacha hadn't felt the desire to leave the house all that often especially since Kuzco's gone. He feels that isolating himself from the outside world is a deservable punishment for not being able to stop Kuzco from taking his place. He feels ashamed that Kuzco believes he owes him and that this is sufficient repayment. Pacha never felt like he was owed anything. Kuzco is his friend. More than that, he's family. I horrifying thought of fathers burying their sons crosses his mind and leaves a chill and hollow feeling in his chest which he quickly tries to shake off. He has to have more faith in Kuzco. If he doesn't believe in him Pacha would be the one to owe him mote than his life and he's tired of this idea that Kuzco feels like he's in debt to him and his family. Kuzco is family and you don't owe your family for caring for you Kuzco should know that. No, Kuzco wouldn't know that. He grew up alone and raised by Yzma, she gave him no concept or idea of what it was like to grow up with a real loving family. He sat down in the living room where he watched Yupi coloring on the floor with Wompy sitting beside him. He silently thought to himself hoping and praying for Kuzco's safety. Chicha tells him not to dwell on it too much, but how could he not? Kuzco's gone because of him, for him, if anything happens to him he'll never forgive himself. He only wishes his last conversation with Kuzco wasn't an argument. He hated how Kuzco felt responsible for the draft, he hated himself that he showed disappointment in him when Kuzco confessed he was kicked out of the war meeting for nearly attacking an incredibly disrespectful lieutenant, and was unable to be a part of the final decision process over the draft which he's sure by this point wasn't a process but a preconceived unstoppable plan all along. Kuzco no longer had any official power as Emperor any more he can no longer snap his fingers and fix everything suitable to his needs anymore. Pacha hated it even worse when he made Kuzco think he was too weak to rule his empire. The last way he ever wanted Kuzco to feel is weak. That's why he took off into the army, to prove he wasn't weak, and that he is a suitable emperor to the Inca empire. Pacha was sure that's why the council sent Kuzco home early they never wanted him there, but as emperor to be (Pachas's really starting to get sick of that phrase now Kuzco is their rightful emperor and everyone knows it)Kuzco had to be there at the war meeting and they used his actions as an excuse to send him home like he had his tail between his legs and decided to let other people handle his problems. That was not true. Of course Kuzco was just like that before but Pacha's seen him grow and mature a little over the time he's lived here. Kuzco was a fighter, he fought for what he believed in, fought to get his point across… and is now fighting for people he cares about. Pacha knows Kuzco cares about them, you don't tell a man, when you're locked in a dungeon with the threat of death looming over your head, that he's become a fatherly figure to you without it implying you care about him. Pacha sighed and rested his forehead on his fists. This is war. Who knows how long Kuzco will be gone and under a faux alias will make things difficult to get into contact with unless Kuzco contacts them first, which Pacha doubts he'll do. He really wishes their last conversation wasn't an argument. It'll be the worst memory Pacha would have to live with until Kuzco returns. Pacha's determined to keep his thoughts that way as a when not an if . \"Papa.\" Yupi says. Pacha looks up at him. \"What is it Yupi?\" \"Ook!\" Yupi says proudly while holding out a colorful drawing. \"Wow. What is it?\" Pacha asks smiling down at his son. \"Yupi gets up while picking up Wompy and carries the drawing over to his father. \"Ook!\" Yupi says again as he thrusts his drawing into his father's hand. The drawing was colorful and a bit sloppy, however it looked like a winged reptile attacking or fighting a serpent. \"This is a really great drawing Yupi Pacha says smiling. \"'Ank you!\" Yupi says happily. XXXX Kuzco crawled inside his tent that took him more than two hours to figure out how to build while rolling out his sleeping matt. He removed the black armor and laid down on the matt wearing a white t-shirt and shorts. He felt slight discomfort under his head and removed the black rope, letting his hair fall freely. \" Mwa! \" \"Goodnight Misty.\" Kuzco said as he rolled to his side. He sighed to himself, to put it short, it was a horrible first day. He made a mess of everything and all the other recruits obviously hate him considering the number of times he got smacked and pushed every time another guy got near him, he needed to restrain himself from shouting his signature catchphrase, \" No touchy !\" at them. Everyone in the kingdom knew Kuzco despises being touched and anyone would instantly recognize the phrase. Whenever the urge rose he would think of Pacha and his family becoming separated and he himself permanently losing the throne. Kuzco shut his eyes tight trying to ignore the fact he was sleeping on the ground. Here he couldn't complain about how he slept, what he ate, or what he wore, he remembered the disaste that gave him and Pacha away when they were in disguise at a Mudka's Meat Hut when he started complaining about the food. Besides it's definitely not the first time he slept on the ground he mildly surprised himself on how willing he was to sleep on the ground without bothering to order Pacha to do the impossible and build him a bed in the middle of the forest when he was a llama, he was sure he could handle this. … Rustle ! Rustle ! \" MWA! \" Kuzco's eyes shot open and he shot up from the matt. He grabbed an arrow from inside the pouch he brought and poked his head out the tent. \"Misty.\" Kuzco whispered. \"Hey what do you think you're doing?!\" A gruff voice whispered. \"Huh?\" Who said that?\" Kuzco said. \"Your hair man! Your hair! Someone could catch you!\" Kuzco's eyes widened and poked his head back in the tent and poked it back out with his hair up behind his head like before. Kuzco stepped out of the tent, arrow in hand and looked around. \"Who… said that?\" Kuzco found Misty hiding behind his tent. \"Misty?\" Misty shook her head. \"Down here!\" Kuzco looked down and saw a talking… \"Wompy?\" Kuzco said eyes widening and bending down to look at, not the cloth, hand stitched Wompy that he left with Yupi but one of the imitated smaller plastic Wompies whose heads pop off easily. The kind made by the royal toy maker. \"Nah uh, kid. The name's not Wompy. You can…\" The small talking Wompy doll whipped its tiny head from side to side looking around. \"Quick kid, get inside the tent. Kuzco felt his legs wobbling as he took a step back and tumbled to the matt on the floor. The toy looked at Misty before walking in and said, \"Feel free to stick your head in the tent if you wanna know what's going on.\" \"No way, I'm looking at a talking Wompy doll. This whole mess has to be a dream! There's no war, there's no talking Wompy…!\" \"Denial will lead you nowhere kid. Pinch yourself.\" Kuzco stared at the plastic Wompy and made his thumb and forefinger reach for the skin on his arm. He shut his eyes bracing himself for the pain. \"Ouch!\" Kuzco said as softly as he could. The little Wompy sighed while shaking his, its(?) head. \"Kid, If you can't handle little pain like that what makes you think you'll be able to survive training the next two weeks?\" Kuzco looked at the living toy in shock before asking, \"What are you? How are you alive?\" The Wompy toy looked up at him and started speaking again. \"One: the name's not Wompy. Two: You can call me Nahual I'm a guardian angel prayed for by Tipo and sent by the Sun God to guide and protect you.\" \" Mwa! \" \"And I believe what the Llama, Misty here would like you to know is that I tried possessing her to get to you, which is why she panicked and I had to resort to my last choice because posing as a jaguar or any other animal would set your cover off. Kuzco felt his mouth drop open slightly in shock. \"Ok… which question do I ask first?\" Kuzco asked staring at Wo- Nahual. \"How about we start with what I'm here for.\" Nahual started. Kuzco nodded still staring at the talking toy. \"First off your highness, I'm here because your dear little brother prayed for you to have guidance and safety while you're away in battle. The Sun God paid heed and sent me down to look after you. It's a pretty noble thing what you're doing, I respect that, but pretty stupid when you think of the consequences. I'm here to make sure that doesn't happen. \"And… how are you going to do that? Wait, I don't have a little brother.\" Kuzco said looking down at Nahual. \"Oh well, can you tell me who this kid is then?\" Nahual asked and created a magical floating image of a little boy playing fútbol. Kuzco looked at the boy and couldn't help the small smile on his face. He took a breath before speaking. \"That's Tipo, my human guardians' son.\" Kuzco said as he watched Tipo playing, probably from during earlier the day. Nahual looked at the image. \"Oh well, close enough.\" He said before making the image disappear.\" Listen kid, I'm going to make sure you don't get caught and keep you motivated in preparing for battle. If you fail you lose the throne. If you lose this war, it could spell doom for the whole empire, are we clear?\" \"Yes.\" Kuzco mumbled. \"Sorry can't quite here you.\" Nahual said. \"I said yes.\" Kuzco said speaking a little more clearly. \"One more time.\" \"Yes we're clear!\" Kuzco said, not loudly, more determinedly. \"Good. My first job as Spirit Guardian is to make sure you rest. I've kept you up long enough.\" A/N: This story is not dead!

He comes calling first in the form of a letter, which I find overly long and containing a good deal of bluster about his work in Texas. His punctuation is more-or-less acceptable. He writes to tell me that he will be coming up to Dardanelle in September to give the Sheriff some information on the matter of a pair of armed robbers, brothers named Paddy and Cecil Mauldin. LaBoeuf tells me he pursued them briefly through the north of Texas, but that the Mauldin boys fled to Arkansas and their capture will now be in the hands of our capable law enforcement. I recall seeing a wanted notice in the newspaper about the Mauldins, but other than a few sightings, they seem to be laying low in Arkansas. In his letter, LaBoeuf wonders if I will have some time to catch up and talk about as he put it, \"old times.\" He then asks if I knew of any boarding houses in town with reasonable rates. I write back immediately: Dear Mr. LaBoeuf, I cannot tell you how pleased I am to hear that you have been well these past few years. How time does pass! It seems only yesterday that you and Marshal Cogburn were courageously dispatching corn dodgers on the prairie. When you make your way up to Dardanelle next month, I insist you stay as a guest in the Ross estate. We are only a short ride from town, and I assure you the meals will be far better here than in any boarding house. We have plenty of room for you, and I do not intend to take no for an answer. You seem to have made quite an impression here when last you came into town in pursuit of Tom Chaney. Mother, Victoria and Frankie (especially Frankie) are looking forward to hosting a real Texas Ranger. Yours truly, Mattie Ross His response arrives a week before he does: Many thanks, Miss Ross. I will take you up on your offer, which is very generous. It has been quite some time since I have had a home-cooked meal. You can expect me sometime after the 20 th . I will not trouble you too long, my visit should last only a few days. LaBoeuf, Texas Ranger / Frankie spots him first, from what I suspect is his hidden vantage point behind the sofa, looking out the front picture window. I had been after Frankie all afternoon to help Victoria clean the silver, but he kept slipping off to keep vigil for Mr. LaBoeuf's arrival. \"He's here!\" Frankie's boots clatter rapidly on the floor. \"He's here, I seen him!\" I stand from my desk where I'd been writing this month's expenses into the ledger and head downstairs, reaching the bottom step just Frankie as bolts into the foyer. I catch him under the arms and sweep him off his feet in mid-run. At the age of eleven, he is growing quickly, but I have the advantage of size yet. As a child I was always tall for my age, and I seem to have topped off at five feet and seven inches. I spin Frankie around in the opposite direction and point him toward the kitchen. \"Running in the house! I'll box your ears, Franklin Ross. Go find Victoria and Mama and alert everyone that Mr. LaBoeuf has arrived.\" He scowls but obediently tramps off, leaving me alone. The house feels suddenly still. I can hear the murmur of female voices from far off, probably Mama and Nettie, our cook, in the pantry. The screen door to the rear porch yawns open then shuts again, but even that seems oddly muted. I take a breath, and step out the front door onto the veranda. Frankie is not mistaken. LaBoeuf is coming up the path, perched upon his tawny appaloosa. He notices me and slows the pony. He is a ways off yet and he makes, it seems to me, a quite exaggerated display of squinting in my direction, like he is not sure what he is looking at. The brim of his hat casts a deep shadow and I cannot see his eyes, but I have the impression he is somehow amused. He slides down off the appaloosa and walks it the rest of the way up. Frankie must have done as I asked, for Edie, one of the stable hands comes out from the barn and takes the appaloosa's reins from LaBoeuf. LaBoeuf gives the young man a few brief instructions before patting him on the shoulder and sending him on his way with the pony. \"Hidy, Miss Ross,\" LaBoeuf calls to me. \"You are a sight to see.\" I notice that he still has the spurs, which sing out their odd cadence of heavy clunks and light-as-bells tinkling as he saunters up the steps of the veranda. His jacket is the same ridiculous buckskin number too, though it is unbuttoned and flapping open to relieve the late summer heat. I notice someone has sewn up the bullet hole in the shoulder. I smile. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I cannot help but notice you did not specify what kind of sight I am, exactly.\" He laughs and gives a shake of his head. \"Cagey as ever,\" he says. He looks at me again and shakes his head again, slower this time. \"It has been some time, hasn't it.\" Despite the years that have elapsed, he looks no worse for the wear, and indeed a great deal better than when I had seen him last, bleeding and maimed as he was. The weather is unseasonably warm, and no doubt the sun has been a burden on his journey here. Sweat lacquers his brow, but that only serves to increase his appearance of health and vitality. I search his face for some sign of aging and note the gentle creasing around his eyes, which are as bright and gently blue as ever. He levels those eyes at me now, and I feel a sudden spike of something almost like fear in my gut. I force myself to hold his stare until finally he drops his head, putting his hands lightly on his waist. \"Well!\" I say. \"You must be very tired from your journey. Won't you come in, then? We have soda cake and corn on the ear and chicken pie ready for you.\" / \"Four hundred yards!\" I have just recounted the story of Mr. LaBoeuf's rifle shot that killed Lucky Ned Pepper, much to Frankie's delight. Victoria has also proven an excellent member of the audience, gasping at all the right places. Mama tries to keep her composure, but I can tell the story has rattled her some. She was beside herself when I came home with most of my left arm gone, and out of mercy for her, I was spare with the details of what had happened to me during my great adventure. Now though, with Mr. LaBoeuf throwing in his own memories, I cannot help but regale in the specifics. \"Four hundred yards, at least,\" I correct. \"So, anyway, we both breathed in, waiting. There was total silence for miles. And Lucky Ned just slid right off his horse,\" I say, clapping my hand on the table. \"Dead as a doornail.\" All eyes are on Mr. LaBoeuf now. Victoria and Mama seem to be fixing him with something between trepidation and disbelief. Frankie says without disguising his reverence, \"four hundred yards, that ain't even human!\" LaBoeuf says, \"Like I told Miss Ross here, the Sharp's carbine is a instrument of incredible precision. Had I been using another—\" I can't believe he is demurring. Of all the times for modesty to crop up in him! I did not think it possible. \"A gun can be as fancy as you like, but it is just a hunk of lead and wood without a keen eye and a steady hand behind it,\" I say sharply. \"Well, ain't that the truth,\" he concedes with a smile. He looks at me then across the table, and I feel that funny spike of something from earlier run through me again. I turn and ask Victoria to pass me the basket of soda cake. My mother clears her throat. To her credit, she's been a sport about the rather bloody turn our dinner conversation has taken. \"So, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she says. \"What brings you out to Yell County? Mattie tells me you have some business with the sheriff in Dardanelle?\" He takes a swig of water and leans back in his chair. \"Yes Ma'am, I do. \" Then suddenly he leans forward again and says the rest mostly toward Frankie and Victoria. \"Now, normally I would say that the grisly business I am about to describe has no place at the dinner table, especially in front of women and children. But, given you all have shown such great fortitude in hearing out the story of Ned Pepper, I believe I can make an exception here. What do you think, would you like to hear about the escapades of Paddy and Cecil Mauldin in the north of Texas?\" / After dinner we sit in the parlor, the adults and I in chairs and Frankie and Victoria at our feet. It seems Mr. LaBoeuf possesses more manners than I would have expected from a man living hand-to-mouth on the prairie, and has brought us each a little gift from Texas. It suddenly occurs to me that he was at some point a child with parents and siblings of his own. I wonder what they were like, whether his father shares his blue eyes and dusky blond hair. It occurs to me that too, he is likely of good breeding, what with his affected speech, finicky hygiene and ridiculous clothing. From a leather satchel he produces for Frankie and Victoria a little sack of glass marbles, and a pretty doll with a deep green frock and eyes to match. For Mama he has a package of what he describes as \"pure Texas coffee.\" She opens the top a bit and I admit that it smells quite good to me, though I do not care for the stuff myself. At any rate, she seems pleased with it, and I can tell the gesture alone has won some regard from her. Finally, he reaches into the satchel and produces for me an oddly shaped device. He places it in my hands, and it takes me a moment to register what it is. \"A stereoscope!\" exclaims Victoria, and then I recognize it immediately, having seen them in the shops at Dardanelle. This one is particularly pretty, furnished in a richly varnished maple, with a sculpted black leather hood over the binoculars. \"And this as well,\" he says, handing me a cloth pouch. I open it and find a neat stack of stereoscopic cards. I begin shuffling through them for one to place into the fitting, and he clears his throat, suddenly looking embarrassed. \"It is occurring to me just now that those particular cards might be a touch childish for you,\" he says. \"I know you are not a child any longer, but I suppose it was hard for me to really understand that, as it were, while I was purchasing them.\" Looking through the images, I see what he means. A number of the cards bear frivolous things both Frankie and Victoria might enjoy: a troupe of school children running with a spaniel, violets waving in the breeze, a funny illustration of a circus. Others though I notice are images of rocky cliffs and dessert plains I imagine must be located in Texas. I stop when I reach a card showing a delicately painted eagle. The artist has inscribed below it in neat, spidery writing: \"But those who hope in the Lord will renew their strength. They will soar on wings like eagles; they will run and not grow weary, they will walk and not be faint.\" \"Philippians 4:13,\" I say aloud. \"What's that?\" He stands from his chair and leans over the back of mine to get a look at the card. \"Oh, yes. I thought you might enjoy that one.\" I place the card into the fitting and we pass the instrument around. Victoria seems particularly taken by it, and I must admit that it is quite a site, that tiny image of an eagle soaring high above the canyon made so real by a pair of glass lenses. Frankie asks if we can look at the photographs of Texas next, but I tell them it is high time we all turned in for the night. \"Mr. LaBoeuf does have an early day tomorrow,\" Mama adds. She herds them off to bed and I tell Mr. LaBoeuf that I will escort him to his room. \"That would be fine, though first I think I will take my pipe outside, if you don't mind.\" / I follow him onto the veranda. Twilight is bedding down over the prairie and in the distant hills. Though the air remains warm, a soothing breeze washes over us as we sit. Mr. LaBoeuf's match flares briefly into the bowl of his pipe, and he leans back with a sigh of what I suppose must be contentment. Tendrils of smoke curl about his face, and I can smell the soft bite of the burning tobacco. \"Well,\" he says, \"I will be meeting Sheriff Gillaspie tomorrow at nine. What will you do?\" \"I was thinking I would ride into town with you. We shipped a crop of cotton to Dallas this year and I have been expecting a letter at the post office regarding the balance.\" \"You got it out awful early.\" \"It was on account of the prediction that the weevils would be particularly bad this season,\" I say. \"I wasn't able to find a suitable price with our usual factor in Little Rock. They say the business is all moving eastward, or down south. I was eying a group way down in Galveston, but they would not give me a fair shake, as they say. I found a factor in Dallas that advertised 13 cents per pound, but I'll believe it only when I see the money in my hand.\" \"Dallas is quite a long way off for you to be doing business there, let alone Galveston.\" \"Even shouldering the shipping costs ourselves, we still reap more than we do with a local factor. Anyway, the market there was favorable for us this year. As I understand it, blight was widespread in your home state. My condolences to your farmers.\" \"I would not know much about that,\" he says. \"You have been overseeing the family's affairs, then.\" \"Of course. Mama never had a head for sums, and frankly she is ill-prepared to manage little outside of Frankie and Victoria. Even that I must admit, I question from time-to-time.\" \"Those children have been brought up right so far as I can tell.\" He leans back in his chair and chews at his pipe stem. \"You are content then to spend the rest of your days here in Yell County?\" \"Of course,\" I say. \"I have my father's estate to manage.\" I think about his words for a second, then add: \"You make it sound morbid.\" \"I just wonder that a young lady your age does not think of her prospects,\" he says. I do not allow him to elaborate on what those prospects might be. \"Foolish dreaming is for foolish girls. I have my business here,\" I say. Then I turn and ask, \"and your business has been rewarding you, I trust?\" He goes a little stiff at my words. He says, \"I think of my position as a ranger as less of a business and more of a calling. It is privilege to serve the state of Texas.\" \"Oh, certainly,\" I say lightly. There is that pride, I think to myself. He gives me a look but continues. \"As far as compensation goes, it is irregular at best. However, I received a great deal of money from the reward for Chaney's body and have been kept well by it.\" He frowns for a moment. \"I suppose I have you to thank for that, when all is said and done.\" \"I don't know what you're talking about,\" I say. \"From what I hear, 'Chelmsford's' chest was blown open by a Sharp's carbine rifle, an instrument that I have heard you are quite handy with.\" \"That is the conclusion that was reached in Texas.\" I frown. Something has been weighing on me these four years. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, did you ever come across my father's second California gold piece on Chaney's person?\" He exhales. \"I regret to say I did not. But I did look on your behalf.\" \"Well, I thank you for that. I suppose nothing more can be done about it.\" \"I am sorry all the same. Do you still have the other?\" I pull a thin chain out from inside the collar of my dress and hold it up for him. The remaining California gold piece is looped on the end. It catches the faint orange light of his pipe bowl and shines like a tiny star in the dark. I replace the gold piece. \"Were they pleased with your retrieval of Chaney down in Texas?\" \"They were,\" he says. \"In the end, it did not seem to matter to the Bibbs family how he was executed, so I suppose you both won out in the end.\" We are quiet for awhile as Mr. LaBoeuf steadily pulls at his pipe. \"Miss Ross, when I return to Texas, I will tender my resignation from the Ranger Corps.\" I turn toward him in surprise. \"But, why?\" He extracts the pipe from his mouth and taps it against the armrest of his chair for a moment before saying: \"My shoulder never fully recovered from that rifle shot Marshal Cogburn generously doled me. You see, when the pain flares up, I have no choice but to take leave, which I have done several times over these past four years. Lately, I have noticed that even when the pain is dormant, I have very limited mobility with the arm. To stay in the field handicapped would mean endangering my fellow rangers, and that cannot be allowed to happen. No, I will tender my resignation. It is time.\" \"I am sorry to hear that, Mr. LaBoeuf, that is terrible news.\" I think for a moment, then say encouragingly, \"though, the five hundred dollars from Texas, plus the reward from the senator's family, why, that is enough to keep a single man with few expenses afloat for years.\" \"The money is not my concern. No, what preoccupies me is how I will use my time. As a ranger, I have enjoyed the satisfaction and the excitement of enacting justice on the behalf of the state of Texas for over ten years. I wonder if there is anything I can do from here on out that will seem equally rewarding. I imagine not.\" \"There must surely be demand for a man with your experience,\" I say. \"A man with my experience, perhaps, but not my shoulder. As a very young man, I spent some time in prospecting. I could go back to that. It occurred to me that I could work as a private contract detective. I also have a good memory for legal matters.\" \"I do recall that,\" I say. \"I could perhaps see myself doing one of those things in the end,\" he muses. \"And it would allow me to settle down, take a wife, start a family. The LaBoeufs still have people residing in El Paso where I grew up, I would not mind spending my remaining years out there.\" We are still for some time, until I say: \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I am pleased you managed to get in touch after all this time.\" He holds the pipe in his hands, looking it over thoughtfully as though seeing it for the first time. \"The truth of it is, I'd have done it sooner if I'd felt I had proper cause to. But I'm not sorry it took this long.\" \"And why is that?\" He turns his head toward me and we look at one another for a moment. Then he stands and shrugs. I can't tell if he intends the gesture as a response to my question. He knocks the ash from his pipe off the side of the veranda and says, \"I think I'll turn in now if that's all right with you.\" / I show Mr. LaBoeuf to his room. He kicks off his boots and I tell him I will fetch him a pitcher of water for washing up. When I return, he is reclining against the headboard, eyes closed. He opens them when he hears my steps. He has hung his jacket from one of the bedposts and I see he is wearing a soft chambray shirt. It is a blue not so different from the color of his eyes. I quickly place the pitcher of water on his bedside table. It hits with a clatter. \"Well,\" I say. \"I'll take my leave now. Good night, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Sebastian,\" he says. I pause with my hand on the doorknob. \"Excuse me?\" \"My name is Sebastian.\" \"All right,\" I say. He closes his eyes again. \"Good night, Miss Ross.\" As I shut the door, I hear the shuffle of little feet and a poorly suppressed giggle in the hall behind me. I whirl around just in time to see Frankie and Victoria fleeing back into their bedroom. Two wide steps and I stick my foot in the door before they're able to get it closed. \"And what are you two still doing up?\" I demand, pushing the door the rest of the way open and putting on my sternest face. Victoria flushes crimson the way she does when she knows I'm about to bring the law down on her and she shoots a desperate look toward Frankie, who just grins like a fool back at her. In spite of herself, Victoria dissolves into a fit of desperate giggles. \"We're wondering if you'll make Mr. LaBoeuf your sweetheart,\" she manages to gasp out. \"Frankie says he seen you blush when you look at Mr. LaBoeuf.\" I'm taken aback and exclaim, \"what! This is just—just silly!\" Frankie's laughing now, too. \"Were you giving him a goodnight kiss, Mattie?\" I must own that the color in my cheeks rises at this comment. \"Get to bed you two,\" I snap. \"And this time stay there!\" I stand out in the hall for awhile after, listening for the creak of their relaxing mattresses, the slow dissolution of their giggles into silence. Then I make my way down the dark hall toward my own bedroom. Frankie and Victoria have inherited my father's predilection for humor of that sort. While I will indulge them from time-to-time, sometimes I do not know where they think up their jokes. / When I come downstairs the next morning, Mr. LaBoeuf is already seated in the parlor. I nearly bark out a laugh when I see him: he wears a ditto suit of charcoal grey with pale piling around the lapels and collar. It is a nice enough suit I suppose, but it looks a bit strange on him, like seeing a dog wearing trousers. \"Good morning,\" he says, shifting somewhat uncomfortably in his chair. \"Did you not think your Texas trappings impressive enough for the Sheriff?\" I ask. \"What's that?\" He blinks. \"Oh, the suit. Well, I thought civilian attire more suited for a place like Dardanelle.\" We share a breakfast of hot corn bread, fried potatoes and boiled eggs before heading out for Dardanelle. Mr. LaBoeuf takes coffee and I do not. I pack the leftover cornbread in my satchel for later, and as an afterthought wrap up some cured pork as well. We will want to have a quick meal before riding back home, and he is a guest after all. Mama, Frankie and Victoria see us off. As the house and their waving figures retreat behind us, Mr. LaBoeuf calls back, \"Adios!\" I do not turn back as I do not want to lose my balance. This does not escape Mr. LaBoeuf's attention and he says to me, \"you ride very well despite your impediment.\" \"It took me a year or so to really get the hang of it,\" I say. We are riding at a leisurely pace, and conversation feels pleasant and easy, so I add, \"I believe in many ways, I am a better rider now than I ever was with both arms, on account of all the practicing I had to do.\" \"Your horse responds magnificently to you.\" \"She is a beautiful mare, is she not?\" \"She is. Do you call her 'Little Blackie' as well?\" His tone is teasing. I give him a scornful look that he does not notice, or at least pretends not to notice. \"I do not,\" I say. \"That would make little sense considering she is chestnut in color. Her name is Thankful.\" \"That is an unusual name for a horse,\" he informs me. \"I suppose it is. When I was a little girl I met a cousin Pike County with the same name and I thought it quite nice.\" We ride awhile longer, and I take the liberty of pointing out the familiar landmarks, as well as listing the names of the farms that we pass. I do not know how well Mr. LaBoeuf is listening as he is uncharacteristically quiet. I have the impression he is mulling something over, probably the Mauldin business. I grow tired of chattering after some time and stop. Mr. LaBoeuf is still silent, and I soon become lost in my own thoughts. I do not entertain idle daydreams, but a person can get a good deal of useful thinking done while on a trip like this. I'm distracted though, when Mr. LaBoeuf suddenly says \"Your riding costume is great deal finer now than the one I recall you wearing four years ago.\" He gestures with one hand to my high-necked blue wool riding habit. The left sleeve is pinned up of course. \"That was my father's coat I wore back then,\" I remind him. \"This one is far more becoming.\" I feel myself go quite scarlet, and hope the shade from my hat provides adequate cover. \"You would do well to keep such opinions to yourself, I think,\" I say sharply. \"My apologies. I surely meant nothing by it.\" It seems likely that he really did not mean anything by his words. I know that men often just talk this way around young women, though I have no patience for it. I am unfamiliar with the customs of Texas, but if Mr. LaBoeuf is any example it would not surprise me if such forward comments passed for casual conversation there. I say, \"we should pick up our pace a bit if we want to make it to Dardanelle by nine,\" and then I dig my heels into Thankful's side perhaps a bit harder than is necessary. / I see Mr. LaBoeuf off at the Sheriff's Office and walk the distance to the Post Office. As expected, there is a letter from Dallas waiting for me. The return address bears a Texas seal. Thanking the clerk, I take the letter outside and read it on the steps: Dear Mr. M. Ross, We have received the 76 bales / 38,461 pounds of cotton shipped from your estate. We previously quoted you a price of 13 cents per pound for ordinary. Recalculated to the current market rate of 11 cents per pound, you are owed a total balance of $4,230.71. Please advise how you wish to proceed with this transaction. Sincerely, J. Hardie Cotton Factor W.S. Beadles & Co. I fold the letter crisply into two and place it in my pocket. I stand on the steps for awhile, considering my position. The sun is lazing upward in the sky, and the early afternoon heat has begun to build like a low hum just below a level of discernable discomfort. Sometime between now and when I left Mr. LaBoeuf with the Sheriff, the city has roused itself, and merchants and men in suits hurry past the post office. A young couple, a man and woman, pause near the steps where I stand. I see that the woman's sleeve has come unbuttoned at the wrist, and she is having some difficulty closing it again, encumbered as she is by a lacy fan and small purse. Her companion gently pushes her hand away and buttons the sleeve for her. She rewards him with a warm, indulgent smile, and as they resume walking she slips a hand through the crook of his arm. She meets my eyes as they pass by me and I give her a scowl to show my disapproval at their public affection, but she just smiles at me, too. It is not the same smile she gave to the man, this one vague and distant-eyed. No matter. I have a list of errands to run while Mr. LaBoeuf is at his meeting, and so I attend to those next. / It is well past noon by the time Mr. LaBoeuf exits the Sheriff's office. I have taken a seat on a railing in the shade of the building, and I wave him over. I have a napkin spread in my lap and am halfway through a piece of corn cake. \"My apologies, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" I say. \"I have begun eating without you.\" \"No matter,\" he says. I hand him his canteen. He gulps liberally at the water, then uses his handkerchief to mop his brow. \"Hot as dickens in that Sheriff's office,\" he says, taking the hunk of corn cake I offer him. \"And how did your meeting go?\" He shrugs. \"It was fine. I gave what information I have on the brothers' movements, their tendencies, but I do not think they will pursue the Mauldins actively. They've gone quiet since crossing into Arkansas, so the law does not consider them a priority.\" He sounds disappointed. I think of the combination of his bum shoulder and his preening vanity. It is important for a man like that to feed necessary and productive. \"So I suppose you'll be heading back to Texas, then?\" \"I suppose so.\" He mops his brow one last time before replacing his hat. The dark grey wool looks rather severe against his fair skin and hair, and I think it does him a disservice. \"Look here, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" I say. \"I have a proposition for you.\" He looks distracted. \"And what's that?\" \"Our cotton factor is trying to shortchange us for our product. I need to go to Dallas to straighten out the matter, but I'll need an escort. Now, ordinarily I would hire Yarnell to accompany me on this type of business, but he's getting on in years, and his daughter is expecting a baby in the next couple weeks. I know he'd like to be around for the birth, and anyway I'd prefer someone familiar with the area. So, it occurred to me, who better for the job than a Texas Ranger?\" LaBoeuf now looks thoughtful, though I detect an obnoxious hint of amusement in his face. He carefully closed expression is not as artful as he would like to think. He takes another swig from his canteen. \"Has this factor cheated you?\" \"Not per se, but I believe he is attempting to take advantage of my distance. He thinks I will not have the resources nor the wherewithal to remonstrate.\" He reflects for a moment then says, \"well, I cannot use the force of law if he has not actually stolen anything from you, Miss Ross.\" \"You don't need to. Your presence as a perceived agent of the law alone should be enough. I can be quite persuasive myself.\" \"I do not doubt that.\" \"We will take the train from Dardanelle down to Dallas. You can leave your appaloosa in our stables during the trip. I will pay you twenty-five dollars each way to accompany me, plus meals and board, and your train tickets, naturally. To top it off, I will pay you a bonus of another twenty,\" I say. \"That is a possible seventy dollars, but either way you will earn you a neat profit of fifty.\" He swipes the hunk of corn cake from my lap and takes a large bite, studying me as he chews. He swallows and drains the rest of his canteen. \"I will do it for no less than forty dollars each way.\" \"Forty is highway robbery,\" I retort. \"I will pay you thirty.\" He considers this for a moment. \"All right then, thirty.\" He extends his hand and I shake it. I allow a smile. \"I hope you don't feel you're being 'hoorawed by a little girl,'\" I say. He laughs, a good honest hard laugh. Then he says, \"I see no little girl.\" / Mama is displeased when I explain my plans to her. She says nothing in front of LaBoeuf or the children, but she approaches me when I head to my room to I pack my things. \"But Mattie, you barely know the man,\" she protests, if you can call it that. She is so soft-spoken I have some difficulty rebutting her without feeling like a bully. \"I know him well enough,\" I reply, folding a pair of stockings into my trunk. \"It'll be okay, I promise.\" She looks me over nervously. \"Mattie, bright as you are, you—you do not understand yet the dangers facing a woman your age. Men will take, well, advantage of you, given the opportunity.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf is a career officer of the law, and a trusted friend. He saved my life, I need not remind you.\" She chews her lip. I can tell from the way she is looking at me that she is still unconvinced. She is no real threat to my plans, but I feel a little sorry for her. Mentioning that Mr. LaBoeuf saved my life also reminds her of the state of my short arm, of almost losing me altogether. In my youth, Mama was a very mild, placid woman, but since Papa's death she has become rather prone to fits of anxiety and depression. I do my best to keep her in good spirits. \"I will be fine, Mama,\" I say, more softly now. \"And it is essential we get the full balance owed us on this crop.\" \"Can't Lawyer Daggett see to it?\" she pleads. \"He will be in Little Rock for another month.\" \"Well, why not just send Mr. LaBoeuf to retrieve the balance on his own?\" I snort, pulling my grey riding coat from the closet. \"I have seen the man in negotiation. He would somehow return with 9 cents per pound. I do not know how, but he would do it.\" Mama says, \"so you would trust this man with your virtue, but not your money?\" I smooth my riding coat out across the bed. \"Well, if you think of it that way, then yes.\" / Yarnell drives us to the train station in Dardanelle in our family's coach. Mama and Victoria see us off at the house, but Frankie pleads to come along to town. I tell him no, because Yarnell is feeling under the weather and I know that Frankie will be yammering non-stop both ways, but Mr. LaBoeuf says I should take it easy on him. \"If the boy wants to come for the ride, just let him,\" he says. Frankie beams at him and I scowl. \"Well, you have 'turned over a new leaf,'\" I say. \"As I recall, you were staunchly against allowing children to ride along with you in the past.\" \"A ride to town and a ride to capture a fugitive are two very different things,\" he points out. \"Anyway, someone changed my mind about that.\" I help Yarnell lift my little traveling case into the back and tie it in place. \"Are you sure you will be up for this?\" I ask. He looks a touch pale, and has a handkerchief out with which to catch his dry coughs. \"I'll be all right, Mattie,\" he says. \"I am on the road to recovery, should be as good as new in a few days.\" \"Well, don't let little Frankie get you down when I'm not here to mind him.\" \"He's a good boy,\" Yarnell says. \"Don't you worry about him.\" Mama gives me a tight, long hug. \"Be careful , child,\" she whispers. I give Victoria a quick squeeze around the shoulders. \"I'll be back in a week at most,\" I tell her. \"You watch after Mama, tend to her moods, all right?\" She looks at me with her limpid grey eyes, so oddly solemn for a girl her age. \"Don't worry, Mattie. Frankie and I know what to do.\" \"All right then,\" I say, straightening. \"I'll write from each point in the trip that I can.\" And like that, we are off. Like I told Victoria, this will not be a long trip. Nevertheless, I cannot help but feel an almost physical tingle in my gut as I watch the farmhouse recede into the distance behind the coach. Excitement, I suppose, at the prospect of seeing places I have never been before. I own the feeling is not unpleasant. Mr. LaBoeuf, perhaps noticing the faint smile playing over my mouth leans over and says, \"ready for another adventure?\" \"An errand of this nature is hardly an adventure,\" I say. \"In Texas, everything is an adventure,\" he tells me. / Author's Notes: The time frame and characters for this fic were based largely on the screenplay for the Coen brothers' 2010 version of True Grit, with some additional details extracted from deleted scenes from the script that did not make the film, as well as the original novel by Charles Portis. The bulk of the events in the Portis novel takes place in 1873, at which time Mattie was 14 years old (putting her year of birth at 1859), and LaBoeuf around 30-35 (b. approximately 1838-43). Edited to add: Thanks to commenter xcgirl08, who pointed out that since Rooster died in 1903, the events of the film would have actually taken place around 1877, putting this story at 1881. I did a small amount of research going into this fic, especially regarding the geography and demographics of Arkansas, as well as the cotton trade and domestic life in the US around this time. That said, I am by no means well-versed in this time period or the region, and gladly welcome any input and criticisms from readers who are. Much of my research turned up information about American life closer to the turn-of-the-century (c. the 1890s) so some of the details may be slightly anachronistic. Also anachronistic (and otherwise wildly inaccurate or impossible) are the details regarding train travel. According to my (very limited) research, there was little passenger rail transport in Arkansas until the 1880s and later. Portis's novel (and by extension, the Coen brothers' film) obviously suggest otherwise, so I stuck with their portrayal and filled in my own details as needed. I went back-and-forth about giving LaBoeuf a first name, but it eventually became unavoidable, so I decided to get it over with as soon as possible. My goal initially was to find as unremarkable a name as possible so that it neither added nor took anything away from his character. Then I decided something with a little panache was actually most fitting. He will be referred to largely as LaBoeuf from here on out, though. Also, I believe in the novel is it made clear that LaBoeuf will not receive reward money from the state of Texas if Chaney is not brought back alive. I omitted this detail for no particular reason.[Chapter 2] The Dardanelle train station is lousy with people. We have to push our way to the platform for the 9:13 to Little Rock, where we will transfer to a second train that will take us straight through to Dallas. We bid a hasty farewell to Yarnell and Frankie, who very spiritedly resists my attempts to force a kiss on his cheek. I do not much care for meaningless affections, but as I learned early on you never know which goodbye will be your last, so you may as well make them all count. \"Come on, Miss Ross,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says. \"That is the last call to board.\" \"All right,\" I say. I reach for my case but he tells me not to be silly and grabs it himself. It is a small case, but I suppose the weight of it surprises him because he says, \"what do you need with all this anyway? What is in here?\" I tell him to mind his business. It is only clothes, he need not make a fuss. The train is as crowded as the platform and Mr. LaBoeuf seizes upon the first free seats we come across, facing a middle-aged couple in fine traveling clothes. Mr. LaBoeuf puts my case up top and slides in across the bench, gesturing for me to sit beside him. I say, \"I want to sit by the window.\" He says, \"I am not accustomed to riding on trains, and the movement nauseates me. I need to sit by the window or else I will become ill.\" \"Well, I do not go about riding trains daily either,\" I point out. \"How do you know I will not become ill?\" \"We can switch back and forth at each stop, how does that suit you?\" \"As your employer—\" He says, \"how about as my friend?\" I relent and sit. I say, \"so we are friends, are we.\" He flashes me a grin. \"Sure, we are friends.\" The woman across from us fixes me with a curious stare. She is wondering about my arm. I give her a deliberately frigid look to let her know her gawking has not escaped my attention. She quickly casts her eyes out the window as though admiring the view of the dusty station. Mr. LaBoeuf points out Yarnell and Frankie, who are squinting up from the platform at the train's soot-covered windows. They are searching for our faces, I imagine. We wave enthusiastically, but so I suppose does everyone else, because they don't see us. The train starts to pull away, so I give one last wave but that too is missed entirely. This leaves me feeling morose. Mr. LaBoeuf pulls out a sack of biscuits that Victoria gave us and inspects one before taking a generous bite. \"Those who eat willy-nilly outside of mealtimes grow sluggish and slow,\" I tell him. \"You ought to save those for suppertime.\" \"And you ought to save your sauce for Dallas. At the rate you are spending it you will run out before you are able to get your twelve cents for that cotton.\" \"Thirteen cents,\" I correct him. He seems somewhat annoyed with me so I take out a newspaper that I bought at the station. The front page is splashed with a drawing of the Mauldin brothers' faces. I think this is silly as no one has seen hide nor hair of either of them since they fled Texas. I do not care for newspapers. All the editors ever see fit to print is sensationalism and trash, and this particular rag is clearly no exception. That said, there are useful parts of a newspaper as well. I turn to the obituaries. / We let pass an hour in silence. Mr. LaBoeuf's eyes are closed and naturally I take it he is asleep, but presently he says: \"What is your plan, Miss Ross?\" I say, \"I have brought with me the previous agreement we made with the factor with the estimated cost of thirteen cents. The quote was not binding but it was solid, and little could have changed between the time we made it and now. I will make the factor see that we are in the right.\" \"I wonder what you will do next year, when they try to cheat you again.\" \"They will not get the opportunity,\" I tell him. \"The cotton business is moving both south and eastward, we will not try our luck in Dallas a second time. I will go to Mobile if I have to.\" \"If the business is moving in that direction, why not move your family out of the state?\" I say, \"you seem to have a prejudice against Arkansas, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" He opens his eyes and grins. \"I do not. I am merely wondering if Dardanelle is not too small a place to contain someone like yourself.\" \"Arkansas is a 'top-notch.' Yell County is 'top-notch' as well.\" \"It is small ,\" he repeats. Then he says: \"I think you know that. I think that is why you asked to take this trip. You could live out the rest of your days on your estate, flipping numbers in your ledger season after season, and I imagine you would even be happy to do it. But ask yourself why you are really here, on this train. It is not for the extra cent per pound of cotton. Tell me there is not a small voice inside of you that wonders if it would be a mistake to never leave home again. You are afraid to grow up without one last jaunt into the unknown, and you should be! I have felt that feeling, it is why I joined the Rangers, and I can see it now in your eyes.\" \"You speak too freely about what you do not know, Mr. LaBoeuf. Too freely.\" I say, \"I love my family's estate and I would sooner die than part with that land. Not all of us aspire to run about the wilds for the rest of our lives like you.\" \"What of marriage,\" he says. \"Do you think you will find a husband with enough wit and polish to satisfy you in Yell County?\" \"I am 18 years old,\" I tell him. \"I do not think about finding a husband at all.\" \"18 is nearly 20, and 20 is near enough 25. You will be an 'old maid' before you know it.\" \"What of you?\" I retort. \"You are twice my age easy, and I do not see you getting married.\" \"The wife of a ranger has a difficult life,\" he says. \"Now that I am about to retire, I am considering my options.\" \"Oh, tell me,\" I say, \"can you not choose between your many girlfriends, or do you just prefer hopping from one loose woman to the next?\" His face purples and he says, \"I do not have 'many girlfriends.' I see clearly now that you still harbor a low opinion of me, but I assure you that you are wrong.\" I say, not very kindly, \"may I ask who mended the holes in your jacket?\" He looks down at the neat stitching in the breast of his buckskin jacket as though he is seeing it for the first time. He opens and closes his mouth but does not reply. I take his ensuing stony silence as a victory for myself. Funny that it does not make me feel much better. / It is dusk by the time the train draws into the station at Little Rock. A glorious sunset is upon the city: shoots of vermillion and violet and gold arc wide across the sky. It does not do to grow fond of this material world, but there is no evil in appreciating the natural splendors our Lord creates. Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"it will be dark soon, we should move toward this boarding house of yours.\" It is the first thing he has said to me since our fight on the train, and he does not say it in a particularly friendly tone of voice. I have decided we will stay at the Little Penny, an establishment that twice accommodated Papa and I, each time he brought me down to Little Rock with him on business. As I recall, it was named after a hen the owner reared right there in the house. This sounds like the sort of brainless thing one might expect from city folk, but it was actually very endearing. Papa got a real 'kick' out of it, and so did I. The animal had a small basket in the parlor where she liked to roost, at the foot of her master's favorite rocking chair. A pair of small boys are loitering around on the platform, apparently finished for the day with selling whatever it was they once carried in the matching sacks strung over their shoulders. They give us directions to the Little Penny and I offer them a nickel each. We take a few wrong turns, and it is quite late by the time we arrive at our destination. I say nothing of it as we walk but I am very happy to have a bona fide Texas Ranger in my company. Little Rock is a pleasant enough city during the day, but I would not want to walk it alone at night. A night clerk greets us at the Little Penny. He is seated around a table with three other men playing a dice game with which I am unfamiliar, but he rises politely when we enter. I am told the owner I remember from my childhood died two summers back after suffering for years from a weak heart. Little Penny herself has passed on as well. As I make the arrangements for our rooms, Mr. LaBoeuf casts an eye around the parlor at the other men, who have halted their game waiting for the night clerk to return. They are giving us a 'once over.' Two of them have soot on their faces, not smeared on the surface like makeup, but caked deep into the pores like they have been living in a mine for years. I suppose they work for the railroad. I cannot imagine what else could cause them to look like that. \"A fine choice of accommodations you have made, Miss. Ross,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says in a low voice. \"It was all right the last time I was here,\" I tell him. \"Papa would not have booked it if it were dangerous.\" \"Well, I think the 'Little Penny' has degenerated some since then,\" I look again toward the dice-playing men. Mr. LaBoeuf may have a point, but I will not give him the satisfaction of knowing I agree. I say, \"our rooms have locks, we will be fine.\" / I can hear men cussing and yelling and tramping up and down the stairs all night. I put a pillow over my head, but I still sleep poorly. I suppose the rougher elements in the house must sleep through the day to make up for their nighttime mischief because it is refreshingly quiet when I wake in the morning. My bones feel stiff as I dress myself. I have grown accustomed to dressing with one hand, but it does take me some time to style my hair. I twist it into a neat loop at the base of my neck and pin a net over it. I am not beautiful, but I effect a neat appearance and no one can say otherwise. I open my door and nearly scream out loud. There is a man sitting on the floor in front of me. Rather, it seems he was asleep with his back against the door, an arrangement that was spoiled when I opened it. It is Mr. LaBoeuf. He recovers and stands quickly. \"Good morning, Miss Ross.\" \"Have you lost your mind?\" I say. I am speaking perhaps louder than is necessary, I do not like being surprised. I own too that I may still be angry with him for our fight yesterday. I am not known for my mean streak for nothing. \"What are you doing sleeping on the floor? Have you been here all night?\" \"Not the whole night, no.\" Here is what happened. The same men who had kept me awake with their cussing and yelling had kept Mr. LaBoeuf awake as well, and in the middle of the night he decided absolutely that the Little Penny was no place for a woman alone. He knocked on my door to check on me, but I did not hear him, I suppose due to the pillow I had clamped over my ears. Not one to be deterred, Mr. LaBoeuf decided he would pass the night there in the hallway. \"I hired you as an escort,\" I tell him warily. \"Not as a watchdog.\" \"You should be more grateful than this,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says. \"The dice players were also drunkards.\" He rubs the small of his back as he speaks. I take it he is even more sore than I. I say conciliatorily, \"at your age, you ought to be kinder to your back.\" Downstairs, the night clerk has been replaced by a mousy woman who initially appears much younger than she actually is. I pay her forty cents for our breakfast, which amounts to little more than two cups of watery grits. I express my displeasure, but she just gives me an anemic little shrug. I have no patience for people who do not take pride in their work. In my opinion it spells a lack of character. / At the train station, Mr. LaBoeuf spots the boys who gave us directions last night. It being so early in the morning, their wares sacks are full. They are selling tamales and I buy two. I have only seen tamales in Fort Smith and have never tried one before, but Mr. LaBoeuf tells me they are good and that they eat them all the time down in Texas. He says to the boys, \"you did not give us good instruction last night. We had a devil of a time finding the Little Penny.\" We board the first Cotton Belt passenger train of the morning bound for Dallas. It is only four cars long, but I am told it makes good time. I think to myself, farewell good city of Little Rock! Farewell my dear Arkansas! I find us a pair of seats across from a stout man wearing a maroon vest and a shabby Stetson drawn down over his eyes. He is already asleep and his snores are thin and reedy. Mr. LaBoeuf claims the seat by the window and says we can switch back and forth again at each stop. I say it is not fair, as he took the window first on the last train. I suggest we flip a coin. I lose. I remain exhausted from my poor rest the night before, and soon, window or no window, the rhythm of the train lulls me to sleep. / I suppose it is because I am seated upright, but I doze fitfully and when I wake it is like I cannot breathe for a long moment. I open my eyes and the air rushes into me, sweet and gratifying. I am mildly confused by my surroundings. The side of my face is pressed against warm, smoky-smelling leather and it occurs to me with a jolt that I have been sleeping with my head resting on Mr. LaBoeuf's shoulder. I jerk away like I've been burned. The sun is over-bright in the sky, fiercely glinting through the windows and waging warfare on my eyes. I squint and put my hand up to shade myself. I estimate it is just past noon. There are fewer passengers now than when we boarded, but the stout man with the Stetson remains sleeping across from us. \"Where are we?\" I ask. \"Just passed Texarkana a few miles back, let a load of people off,\" Mr. LaBoeuf informs me. I realize that the train is slowing to a crawl. The change in velocity must be what woke me. I ask why we are barely moving. \"It is so we can stop at the Texas and Pacific crossing,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says. \"The conductor came through and told us at the station.\" \"We were supposed to switch seats at every stop,\" I say. \"It has been many stops already.\" \"You were 'conked out.'\" I cast a suspicious look at him, \"how did I come to be leaned against you like that?\" \"Well, you were flopping all around in your sleep and that is where you came to rest. I thought it best not to bother you, you seemed so tired.\" He says, \"you are a hard sleeper, it seems you can doze through anything.\" \"That is not true, I must be feeling 'under the weather,'\" I inform him. As an afterthought, I add, \"if it happens again, please wake me.\" \"I will do that,\" he says. The train stops altogether. I look out the window and see that we are at the crossing. The landscape does not look altogether as I imagined Texas. A fair number of trees dot the horizon. They are wizened, dehydrated little things, but none of them have stickers as far as I can tell. Mr. LaBoeuf takes a dime store novel from his satchel and flips through it. It seems like an oddly childish thing for him to carry. He tells me he picked it up in Austin months ago and that he has read it four times already. \"Why not get a new book?\" I ask, but he just shrugs. He says he will read part of it aloud to me, and that I can read part of it aloud to him, and I agree, because this seems to be his way of making amends for yesterday's fight. There is nothing else to do at any rate. The story is about a New York City detective in a rakish derby and suspenders. We follow him through the dank alleyways of the city where he is shot at and buffeted by hanging laundry while in pursuit of dangerous gangsters and gamblers. His informants are boyish hoodlums and buxom women of ill-repute. He has no friends. The narrator repeats this fact several times. It is a silly story that at times borders on vulgar, but it is exciting enough and we have a good time of putting on voices for the different characters. Mr. LaBoeuf effects a Yankee accent that he claims is dead accurate, but it just sounds strange to me. I suppose he would know better, having had more firsthand experience with carpetbaggers than I. \"Would you cease your giggling, please?\" We look up, abruptly drawn out of the world of the story. It is the stout man sitting across from us. I had completely forgotten about him. He has removed the Stetson from over his eyes and is fixing us with an unpleasant, beady-eyed stare. He continues: \"I would like to get some rest, but am unable to sleep due to your ceaseless laughter. Reading should be conducted in silence, especially on a crowded train. You are too loud.\" I say, \"Sir, I am sorry if we have disturbed you, but I do not see how our quiet reading should agitate you. And I have not 'giggled' since I was as high as your knee.\" He looks at me like I am something particularly unpleasant he has just found on the bottom of his boot. He turns to Mr. LaBoeuf and says, \"your ugly wife has a mouth on her. Are you unable to keep her in line?\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"you mind how you address her,\" just as I say, \"I am not his wife, I am his employer!\" The man waves a hand as though batting a fly away from his head. I have the feeling he regrets opening his mouth, but he is unwilling to back down now. He says, \"I do not know where you two hail from, but in back home in Morrilton, Arkansas our women know their place and mind their manners.\" Mr. LaBoeuf stands, drawing the attention of several of the nearest passengers. He says, \"Sir, I am a Texas Ranger, and in my home state men know how to show a lady courtesy.\" I say, \"I hail from Yell County just outside Dardanelle. My family has over 400 acres of good land, and I am a proud citizen of Arkansas through and through. I have apologized on our behalf for disturbing you, but I believe now it is I that is owed an apology for the way you have maligned me.\" \"Nothing doing,\" the man retorts. \"You are this Texas man's paramour, I see no ring on your hand. I would not give my regard to a harlot.\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"Miss Ross, would you like me to arrest this man?\" The stout man cries out, \"you Texas lawmen have no authority over a native of Arkansas!\" \"While you were sleeping we passed over the state border. You are now in my jurisdiction,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says. \"Either way it would not matter. If we were still in Arkansas I would hog-tie you and drag you on your belly to the nearest Texas jail cell! Now, you apologize to the lady.\" The stout man goes pale and now I am certain he wishes he had never addressed us. I say, \"gentlemen, please, let us calm down. I believe this has gone on long enough.\" Before I can continue, I hear a distinctive popping noise outside the train. It sounds far off, then suddenly much closer. I turn to Mr. LaBoeuf, whose hand drops instinctively to the revolver at his waist. The sound seems so unlikely, and yet it is unmistakable. I would recognize it anywhere. Gunshots , I think. For a moment everything is quiet. Then, quite abruptly, three men on horseback thunder past our window, heading toward the front of the train. It is like a signal. Everyone is on their feet, yelling over one another and trying to get a better look outside. The stout man is in the aisle, turning his head back and forth between our window and the window on the other side of the train. It is to no avail, we cannot see a thing from where we stand. We hear more popping noises, much closer this time, and screams fill the train car. The stout man says to no one in particular, \"my God, they are holding up the train!\" \"You do not know that,\" I say. \"Look out the window, you silly girl!\" The stout man is yelling now. \"They will kill and rob every last one of us, and there is no one around for miles to stop them!\" Everyone hears him this time and the result is bedlam. Mr. LaBoeuf calls out to the panicking passengers, \"I am a Texas Ranger, and I will take it upon myself to protect every last man and woman in this train car. However, we must have calm and order.\" At that moment, the door to our car bursts open and a rangy man carrying a shotgun strides in. He yells, \"everyone in their seats!\" We stare at him. No one moves. I suppose the man with the shotgun takes this as a sign of defiance because he pumps the barrel of his weapon and before I have time to make sense of what is happening, he blasts a hole through the chest of the stout man, who is still standing in the aisle. The stout man does not even have time to cry out. He is blown backwards like he is made of sawdust and cotton and he crumples on the floor. Everyone is in hysterics. I own I must be in shock. The left side of my face is spattered with blood and Lord knows what other parts of the stout man. \"In your seats, I said!\" The man with the shotgun pumps his weapon again and quite suddenly everyone is sitting silently, all except Mr. LaBoeuf. The man swivels around and trains the shotgun on him. \"Did you not hear what I said?\" Much to his credit, Mr. LaBoeuf does not waver. He slowly raises his hands, dangling the revolver from his thumb. \"Whoa, now,\" he says. \"Let's be reasonable about this, Paddy.\" Paddy Mauldin! Here, on this train! I do not know if I gasp out loud. Probably not. The stout man's blood is already drying on my face, puckering and tightening my skin. \"Well now, you know my name,\" says Paddy. \"We associates?\" \"My name is LaBoeuf. I was one of the Texas Rangers who pursued you and your brother about two months back.\" \"Rangers!\" Paddy barks. \"Damned Rangers!\" \"Now Paddy,\" says Mr. LaBoeuf. \"You keep it together. This does not have to get worse.\" The door slides open and another man enters, this one holding a pistol with cedar inlays in the handle. He is built similarly to Paddy, tall and underfed, but where Paddy is decidedly unkempt, this other man has a neatly trimmed moustache and under his hat his black hair is combed back with pomade. He assesses the situation with steely, inscrutable eyes. He frowns very slightly at the stout man's body and says, \"what happened here?\" He speaks as though it is just him and Paddy and he is not being watched by a train car full of terrified people. \"I did not like his look,\" Paddy shrugs. Then he says, \"we got a Ranger back there.\" The other man is already fixing his gaze on Mr. LaBoeuf and he says, \"so I see.\" \"Cecil,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"you and your bother keep civil, now. Let's hear what you want, and no one else has to get hurt. I know you boys are smart. We are going to work this out.\" The man Cecil just smiles placidly. At least, his mouth moves into the shape of a smile. He says, \"all right, Ranger. We will 'keep things civil.' First, you are going to have to kick that revolver my way. We do not want to start a firefight in this train car, do we? It would be like shooting in a tin can. Very dangerous.\" Mr. LaBoeuf makes to lean over me with the revolver, but Cecil Mauldin raises his pistol and cocks it in one fluid motion. I have seen men who are familiar with guns. It is rare to see one who uses a weapon so much like it is an extension of his own arm. \"You are making me nervous, Ranger,\" Cecil says. He flicks his gaze over to me. \"Let the girl take it from you, nice and slow. She will bring it over to me, won't you, darling?\" It is like I am being dredged up from deep inside a well. \"I will bring you the gun, but I will not consent to be called 'darling' by the likes of you,\" I say. Behind me I hear someone gasp. Cecil's face looks positively ferocious for a second, but then it is like a mask drops down and he is smiling all placid again. \"You have a lot of cheek. I do not approve of that in a woman. Bring me the gun easy now and I will not have to smack you on the mouth.\" I gingerly take the gun from Mr. LaBoeuf's hand and walk it up the aisle. It is slow going because I do not want to remove my eyes from either Cecil Mauldin or his pistol for even a second, and yet I must navigate around all the spilled luggage and the horrible bits of the stout man that litter the aisle of the train. I reach Cecil and deposit the gun in his open hand. He smirks at me, looking me over. He has a face that is as sharp as a knife, but nevertheless his features are well-formed. Had he led another life, he might have been nice-looking. In this life, his skin is weathered beyond his years and he is missing a number of teeth. \"How came you to lose the arm?\" he asks. \"That is a rude question, and I will not answer it,\" I say. At that moment three more men loaded down with rifles and bulging bags on their backs enter the car. Cecil gestures for them to shove past us. \"Go through all the trunks,\" he tells them. \"Take any jewelry or watches or purses you see on the passengers. I will be splitting up the goods after so mind nothing accidentally falls into your pockets. It would be bad news for you if that were to happen.\" He looks back at me and I see his eyes focus in on my throat. Quick as a cat, he snatches the gold chain that is around my neck and pulls Papa's gold piece out from inside my dress. \"Well, this is an unusual trinket,\" he says. \"I have not seen a California gold piece in a good many years.\" \"You cannot have it,\" I say. \"Look here, I have a small store of money in my trunk that I will give you, but that gold piece belonged to my late father. He was gunned down by a coward like you.\" \"That is a sad tale,\" says Cecil Mauldin. \"But then, the world is full of sad tales.\" He jerks his hand hard, wrenching the chain from around my neck. The clasp cuts my skin and I note distantly that I am probably bleeding. \"Hey! That is enough! Now you leave her alone—\" Mr. LaBoeuf makes toward me, but Paddy trains his shotgun back on him and shoots. I cry out, but Paddy does not aim properly, just shoots wildly from the waist. The ball goes wide and buries itself in the dead stout man's upturned knee. It is true that dead men do not bleed, but given the right circumstances their parts will still explode. It is awful. Mr. LaBoeuf lurches back against the window. Everyone screams. \"That is enough, Paddy,\" Cecil barks. Then he calls to the others: \"All right, boys. We have dallied long enough. I have the money from the safe. Let us haul out.\" He takes my chin in his hand and tips my face up until I am forced to look him in the eye. He grins. \"I thank you for the necklace and the story, darling,\" he says. \"I only wish we could have spent more time together.\" And like that, they are gone. We hear the men whooping outside the train as they tie up their bounty and mount their horses. There is the muted thundering of hooves against dry ground, and then nothing. I feel a hand on my elbow and start. I realize that Mr. LaBoeuf is at my side. \"Are you all right?\" he asks, turning me to face him. He looks very concerned. \"Papa's California gold piece,\" I say. \"Cecil Mauldin took it.\" \"I know, Mattie.\" He pats down his pockets until he produces a filthy handkerchief which he uses to dab at the gore on my face. It occurs to me that he is trying to be tender with me. I snatch the handkerchief away from him. \"Let me do that,\" I say. \"I am fine, I do not need to be treated like a frightened child!\" I wipe off as much of the stuff from my face as I can, then fold the cloth in half and use it to dab at the blood on Mr. LaBoeuf's jacket. I do not know how one typically removes blood from buckskin, but the handkerchief does next to nothing. I let Mr. LaBoeuf attend to his own trouser leg, which is also bloodied up. The other passengers are up and about as well. The car door slides open and I think we all gasp reflexively, but it is only the conductor, along with a group of passengers from the car in front of us. We are told the engineer has sustained a shot to the gut, and that the fireman was 'winged' as well, but that everyone else is fine. Most of the gunshots we heard had been fired into the air outside, it seems. The stout man is the only person who was killed. \"The engineer will not be able to drive us onward in his state, but we are in the middle of nothing and he needs a doctor or he will bleed out,\" says the conductor. \"We think it best if bind him up with whatever we have and carry him over to Red Lick.\" \"What is Red Lick?\" I ask. The conductor says, \"the closest town. It is about two miles north of here.\" I say, \"I am from Yell County. I have never heard of Red Lick.\" \"There is no reason you should have,\" Mr. LaBoeuf interjects. He turns to the conductor and says, \"are you sure you will be able to find a doctor there?\" The conductor tells him, \"that is what the fireman tells us. He is from around here.\" \"Is it wise to just leave the train sitting here on the tracks unattended?\" I ask. The conductor says, \"those bandits cleaned out the safe, and it appears they have taken all of the passengers' valuables as well. I do not think there is anything left to steal.\" / We make a rather somber parade tramping across the dry prairie: the train's crew, the thirty or so other passengers, and Mr. LaBoeuf and me. The engineer's middle has been bound tight with a nightshirt from someone's luggage and he is laid out across a wooden pallet. Six men carry him by holding the edges of the pallet as they walk and I imagine it must seem unpleasantly to him like they are pallbearers at his funeral. The nightshirt is soaked through with dark blood. Mr. LaBoeuf carries my traveling case, in which we have packed what remains of our things. Aside from the twenty dollars I am carrying on my person, and the thirty I paid to Mr. LaBoeuf before we left, all of my money has been taken by the bandits. We have no choice but to leave the stout man's body with the train. I express some regret over this but Mr. LaBoeuf points out that the sooner we reach town, the sooner we can send someone back for him. I suppose he is right. / Author's Notes: First, thank you so much to everyone who reviewed the last chapter. Your corrections and comments were terrific, and I can't tell you how much I appreciated them! I hope you enjoyed this new chapter as well. Regarding the language, while the film and book are known for their lack of contractions, the contractions are not totally absent (ex. \"I won't rest 'til Tom Chaney's barking in hell!\"). My general rule in writing this fic has been to avoid contractions, while still serving the flow and rhythm of the dialog above all else. Also, I believe one commenter pointed out that \"okay\" would not be used around this time period and to my knowledge, yes, you are absolutely correct! That was one of those words that kept popping up for me naturally while I was writing, and I made super efforts to avoid it in this chapter. Thank you! Full disclosure: I wrote the train robbery scene without knowing anything about trains, then had to go back and revise the technical details. However, the spirit of it, as well as the location remain the same in this final draft. Oddly, in my follow-up research I came across an article in the New York Times from 1901 that detailed the robbery of a passenger train leaving Texarkana—exactly where \"my\" robbery was to take place! The engineer in the real-life robbery even ended up looking for help in Redwater, TX, which seemed serendipitously close (in name at least!) to Red Lick. I used some of the details provided by that article, but the bulk of it is pure fiction. ETA: I doubt anyone noticed in the short time this happened, but I changed the rating of the story from T to M for the violence in this chapter. After reviewing the rating policy, I decided to keep the rating at T after all. Please don't hesitate to let me know if you feel I should increase it to M.[Chapter 3] It seems flat impossible to me that a town could be hidden within a two mile radius of the abandoned train, that is how empty the landscape looks. But after much walking, a town does appear. Mr. LaBoeuf suggests that we send someone ahead to alert the townsfolk and locate a doctor, and so a young man with freckles is dispatched from the train crew. We watch him scurry off across the dry prairie. During the course of our walk the train's crew have begun to defer to Mr. LaBoeuf, I suppose on account of his Ranger pedigree. He leaves me straggling behind with the rest of the passengers in order to converse with the conductor. I quicken my pace to catch up with him. I want to hear what is happening as well. We are greeted by a group of concerned-looking men on what must be Red Lick's main street, if you can call it that. Little clapboard buildings line the narrow road, the largest of which is two stories and labeled with a hand-painted sign hanging over the door. The sign declares in neat red letters \"T. G. Fletcher and Sons, General Store.\" Outside of that, I see no bank, no post office, and no courthouse or law of any kind. I would like to point out to Mr. LaBoeuf that if this is what Texas has to offer us, he has no business calling Yell County \"small,\" but it does not seem like the proper time so I hold my tongue. Mr. LaBoeuf consults briefly with the crew and the townsmen, and they make the following arrangements: first, a young man from Red Lick will leave on a fast pony bound for Texarkana this very day. There he will make contact with dispatchers at the train station and have them send a new locomotive and crew to the Crossing with enough cars to accommodate us. The young messenger will also make contact with local rangers and present them with a letter signed by Mr. LaBoeuf, requesting that a troop be sent to Red Lick to conduct a proper investigation and begin pursuit of the Mauldin brothers. Someone presents Mr. LaBoeuf with a pen and paper and he quickly drafts and signs a letter that he entrusts to the young messenger. In the meantime, the other passengers from the train are herded off toward various homes and buildings with the promise of local hospitality until the new train arrives. A pair of the townsmen help the train crew carry the poor gut-shot engineer inside the general store, where we are told a doctor is waiting in the back room. The engineer's face has gone very pale as chalk and his eyes are closed, but I can see he is still breathing all right. \"I will need to speak with the Rangers as soon as they arrive here,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, more to himself than to me. Then he takes me by my good arm and says, \"come on, we will wait in the general store with the train crew.\" I shake his hand off and tell him, \"I am capable of walking myself.\" The store is empty when we enter, but we can hear urgent murmurs from the back room. I look around. The place is dimly lit and not very well stocked, but it is tidy and smells faintly sweet and smoky. I note a stool beside a basket of sorry-looking yellow onions and gratefully take a seat. The little black boots I am wearing were not made for long treks across the prairie and I am exhausted. I am about to tell Mr. LaBoeuf that we should see to our arrangements for the night when a young woman emerges from the back room carrying a wooden basin. She is startled by the sight of us, and upon seeing my face she exclaims, \"oh heavens!\" A good deal of water slops out of the side of her basin. I do not understand her reaction until I remember that I am still splattered with the stout man's blood from when Cecil Mauldin shot him to pieces right in front of me on the train. Mr. LaBoeuf's handkerchief it seems has only succeeded in making my face look both bloody and generally soiled. The young woman pulls a clean wet rag from her basin and rushes to my side. She says, \"you are from the train as well? Show me where you are injured.\" I stand before she can reach me and I say, \"it is another man's blood on me, Miss. I am unharmed, but I would thank you for the use of that rag.\" The young woman is thus relieved and hands me the rag. She smiles curiously at me. Her gaze flickers briefly in surprise as she notices my short arm for the first time, but she does not respond with repulsion the way I have seen others do. She has a strikingly pretty face, tawny and heart-shaped with large limpid brown eyes. Her hair is heavy and dark. She is the sort of woman who 'turns heads' when she enters a room. I like her immediately. Mr. LaBoeuf removes his hat and gives her a polite nod. I can see from the way he has thrown his shoulders back and puffed out his chest that her finer qualities have not escaped his attention as well. \"Hidy, Miss,\" he says. \"As you guessed, we were on the train. A keen observation on your part.\" He opens his jacket to reveal his star badge. \"My name is LaBoeuf and I am a Texas Ranger.\" The young lady says, \"oh, you are the Ranger that the train crew was telling me about, then. Well, I am Abigail Fletcher, and this is my family's place.\" Abigail steps toward him eagerly and says, \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I was saying to the gentlemen from the train, I think it would interest you to know that our store—this very store—was robbed not eight days ago by the Mauldins.\" This is news! Mr. LaBoeuf all but jumps forward. \"The Mauldins were here! Eight days…why, they must have some kind of a hide-out in the area, then. Abigail, you are a witness and I will take your statement.\" She replies, \"I did not witness the robbery myself, I was upstairs at the time. We live above the store, you see. My brother Clay was minding the counter. He will be able to give you any information you need.\" \"Well, where can I find Clay?\" Abigail says, \"I am afraid he will not be home 'til suppertime. He took our little brothers Petey and Henry hunting for quail in the switch grass up by Coyote Lane. If they do not catch anything in the morning, they rest during midday and hunt again in the evening. I expect that is what they will do today. But they will return before it is too dark.\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"was anyone hurt during the robbery?\" \"Thank the Lord, no,\" says Abigail. \"But they took all the money that was in the register, our best pony and our mule, as well as the one hundred dollars that Clay was saving up for the boys' schooling. That was hidden out back in the barn, though I do not know where, exactly. Clay minds that sort of thing. You will need to ask him for the details.\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"I am very sorry to hear you and your family have had to suffer this way, Miss Fletcher. I want you to know that I have sent urgent word about the Mauldins to the rangers stationed in Texarkana. I expect they will send a troop of men here to Red Lick within a matter of days.\" This is a very different tone of voice than I am used to him using with me, that is for certain! If his fancy words have made an impression on Abigail though, she does not show it. Instead, an oddly sad look flickers across her face. She only says, \"we don't often see Rangers around here.\" \"Well, I am here now,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says to her with a foolish, buttery grin on his face. I say a little loudly, \"yes, though it is a pity he is on leave from the Rangers. On account of his weak shoulder.\" It is like they both suddenly remember I am in the room. Abigail exclaims, \"oh, where are my manners! I am Abigail, and you must be Mr. LaBoeuf's—\" She looks between Mr. LaBoeuf and me before trailing off uncertainly. I open my mouth to explain that I am Mr. LaBoeuf's employer but he interrupts me. \"She is my baby sister.\" I am so taken aback by this story that I do not have the wherewithal to protest. I throw Mr. LaBoeuf a look of utter fury that he pretends not to notice. \"Her name is Mattie,\" he continues. \"Short for Martha. We ah, we were traveling down Fort Worth way to visit with some family.\" \"Well!\" says Abigail. \"It is nice to make both your acquaintances, though I am sorry we could not meet under happier circumstances. You must stay here with us while you wait for Clay. I will go upstairs and fix you something to eat if you are hungry.\" \"That is mighty kind of you,\" Mr. LaBoeuf says. \"We appreciate your hospitality.\" She disappears up a staircase by the door of the backroom. When she is gone I hiss, \"your baby sister !\" \"Look here, Mattie—\" he begins. I seize one of the yellow onions from the basket at my feet and hurl it at him. It hits him in the middle of his chest and he yelps, \"hey!\" as it drops to the floor. It is an absurd thing to do on my part, I know, but I am hungry and tired and angry and I am not thinking straight. \"You are going to have to pay for that onion,\" he tells me. \"I am your employer , Mr. LaBoeuf,\" I say. He says, \"Now, listen! I am operating as a Ranger here, and I need to maintain a dignified image in these people's eyes. It would not reflect well if I told them I am employed by a child.\" \"Oh, a child ! Not two days ago you were calling me an old maid!\" I say. \"Which will you have, Mr. LaBoeuf, because you cannot have both.\" \"You are only cranky because your feet are sore, and your plans inconvenienced,\" he says, waving one hand dismissively at me. \"And you are only trying to make yourself look impressive for this pretty girl, Abigail,\" I retort, taking some grim satisfaction as his face and neck flush in response. If he would like to say more he cannot for Abigail returns with a basket of cold corn cakes and a pitcher of milk. She sets us up at a little table by the counter and I thank her as graciously as I can, soured as I feel toward Mr. LaBoeuf. If Abigail notices the friction between us, she does not demonstrate it. Mr. LaBoeuf remembers the tamales we bought in Little Rock and I fish them out of my traveling case. They are cold, and grease has soaked through both the corn husk and paper wrappers, but the meat in their centers is tangy and well-spiced. I ask Abigail to share the meal with us but she excuses herself, saying she is needed in the backroom to assist the doctor. We both watch her go. Then Mr. LaBoeuf turns his gaze toward me warily and says, \"do not start in on me again. I am the adult here and you will do as I say.\" I say, \"I am tired now, but do not think I have forgotten about this.\" / I nap for the slim remainder of the afternoon. There is no place to lie down so I just bed my head down in my arms at the table. When I awake the store is dark and there is no one around. I suppose the excitement on the train has left me 'riled,' because the meal Abigail provided us is still sitting like a rock in my nervous gut. I stand and find I am quite off-kilter. I manage to trot outside (it is quite dark by now) and round the corner of the house before regurgitating the contents of my stomach onto the bare ground. It is unpleasant, as you can imagine. I bend at the waist to catch my breath, hands braced on my knees. Slowly, the awful cramp in my gut releases. \"What are you doing out here?\" It is Mr. LaBoeuf. I grimace and spit. My mouth is still sour-tasting. \"Enjoying the scenery,\" says I. \"Yes, now is a fine time to get cute.\" But his look of annoyance fades as he takes in my situation. \"Are you ill? Let me take a look at you.\" He comes up close and takes my face in his hands, peering at my eyes. His are attentive and searching, reflecting back the same color as the twilit sky. I do not know what he is looking for, but I am too unsteady to fight him off. His palms feel cool and dry against my flushed skin. \"You feel a bit warm, but your pupils look all right. You have expelled whatever was ailing you, I suspect.\" He releases me and says, \"come, Abigail's made dinner for us and train crew. Even if you are still ill you should have some bread and water at least.\" I stand and take a few deep breaths to steady myself. Mr. LaBoeuf watches me and says, \"you are not going to swoon are you? Shall I carry you?\" I say, \"were I dying I would not give you the satisfaction.\" He says, \"there is Mattie Ross. Now I know you will be all right.\" Then he laughs. We walk around to the front of the house and I say, \"you are awfully old to be my brother.\" He looks at me carefully and says, \"about that. It must have been quite a shock to you when I pulled that story out.\" \"I will say.\" \"I gave you my reasons for it, and they were sound,\" he says. \"I am a stranger here. I cannot be known as the man employed by a child. Just play along, it will only be for a day or two more at most.\" I consider this. I try to recall my earlier fury at him, but find I cannot. I say, \"I will do it for ten dollars.\" He stops and looks at me in what I suppose must be disbelief. \"Good Lord, girl,\" he says. \"Do you never stop thinking of your bank account.\" I say, \"you do not need to pay me now. If you would like, at the end of our trip to Dallas I will pay you twenty dollars instead of the thirty we previously agreed upon.\" \"At the end of our trip—oh, right. Dallas.\" He runs a hand through his hair. \"You have not forgotten about our arrangement?\" I say, taken aback. \"Or do you have other plans in mind now?\" \"Of course not,\" he says. \"It is only that so much has happened today, I temporarily lost my bearings. I will see you safely to Dallas and back home again.\" \"So, what do you say about my proposition?\" I ask. \"Twenty at the end?\" He says, \"ten dollars is a lot of money for such a small story.\" I say, \"that 'small story' has erased my whole family, and the name of Ross. Anyway, what price would you put on your reputation?\" He gives me an irked look before saying, \"fine. Twenty at the end.\" We shake on it. I find my stomach is no longer churning, and I am even feeling a bit hungry. I say, \"let's see what is for supper then, 'brother.'\" / Author's Notes: My apologies for the tardy update! I've been really busy IRL, and frankly writing a story of this length, I get held up with all the editing it requires. I actually have about 25 more pages written (so far! Including some—spoiler—kissing, aha!) but I'm only comfortable releasing this much at the moment. In order to make my updates more frequent, I will likely be posting shorter chapters about the same length as this one. This means the cut-off points aren't exactly where I'd like them to be, but I'm willing to compromise on this because it means 1) more consistent updates, and 2) I'm sure you guys would prefer to read this in smaller fractions, rather than getting 14 pages at a time. Or maybe that's just me? Thank you again to those of you who reviewed Chapters 1 and 2! I can't tell you how much I appreciate your taking the time to leave comments—they really keep me slogging through this beast of a fic! ETA: I realized I somehow only uploaded half of this chapter. I am slipping in the second half about an hour after it was originally posted, my apologies if this affects anyone's reading.[Chapter 4] We pack into the dining room with the train crew and the doctor, the lot of us tired and dusty and smelling somewhat rank. The Fletchers' home is dimly lit, with low ceilings and small rooms, but like the store below it is tidy and pleasant. I have the impression it is likely one of the nicer homes in town. The decorating is fairly 'bare-bones' though I spot a fine pair of pewter candle sticks displayed proudly on the mantle—a little touch suggesting someone, probably Abigail, has endeavored to enliven the place. The doctor sits beside me and introduces himself as Edwin. He explains that he is not a true doctor, but that he makes his living treating livestock, mostly. He says he did perform a fair amount of field surgery during the war. He points to my short arm and asks, \"did they use a Liston blade here?\" I pull my arm away instinctively and say, \"you have been treating horses for too long, Doctor. Your bedside manner could stand improvement.\" Perhaps this offends him. I do not know, I turn away and speak with the fireman from the train. The fireman tells me that the engineer is likely to 'pull through.' The poor man has been left resting in the backroom downstairs. Abigail, as it turns out, is an excellent cook. The meal is somewhat small, owing I suppose to the fact that she was not expecting a to feed an extra six men (and one tall girl) when she arose this morning. But what she has prepared is delicious: a brown peppery stew brimming with chopped carrots and potatoes and what I think must be a wild game-bird, as well as a whitish bean I do not recognize. There are warm biscuits with sweet butter, too. Unlike the biscuits I am accustomed to, these seem to be cut with corn meal. In spite of my weak stomach I eat two. She does not ask for any payment, but when Abigail leaves the table to fetch me some more butter Mr. LaBoeuf passes around his hat and we all pitch in some of what remains of our money. As we do so, I hear the clatter of several pairs of footsteps coming up the stairs. I suppose Abigail hears it too for she hurries back into the room. A man enters with two boys. I recognize them immediately as Abigail's kin—they have the same heavy dark hair and olive skin. The man though has hard bottle-green eyes, in contrast to Abigail's warm brown. I think, this must be Clay. He has a crutch under one arm and I see his left leg is oddly stiff, the foot pointed out at an odd angle. The boys are young, maybe Frankie's age. The taller of the two is carrying a sack over his shoulder. I expect Clay would be surprised to see his dining room full of strangers, but he just surveys us with a canny stillness. Abigail says, \"Clay, these folks is from a train that was robbed—\" He holds up his hand and says, \"I heard. We came by Duke Noblet on the way home, he told us the whole story.\" He turns from her and gestures to the two boys. \"Peter, what are you still doing with them birds? Get that sack down to the smokehouse.\" Abigail produces another bowl and begins to serve Clay his dinner. She says, \"you are mighty late tonight. Everything all right with the boys?\" \"Well, you know how Duke likes to jabber,\" Clay grunts, making his way over to the washstand behind me. \"Apart from that, the bird dog I bought from Lyle is simple-minded. Damned thing took off after a jackrabbit this afternoon, we had a hell of a time coaxing it back. Should have left it out there to be food for the buzzards.\" \"Aw, Clay, he's just a pup,\" says the smaller of the boys, Henry. Peter reenters the room now, unburdened of his sack of quails. They are both clearly hungry for supper. \"You two wash up first,\" Clay says sharply seeing them start to sit down. He himself makes his way over to a seat at the far end of the table. His crooked leg gives him a pronounced limp, but he is able to walk. I decide that the crutch he was using when he came in must be helpful for long distances, but that he can get by on his own in the house at least. Clay sits and sucks a breath in deep, surveying us. He does not smile. He says, \"well, I welcome you gentlemen.\" His eyes fall my way and he seems to consider me for a second before adding: \"And lady. I am Clay Fletcher. My family is sure glad to have y'all with us tonight.\" The lot of us introduce ourselves. When it is my turn I say, \"I'm Mattie Ro—\" A sharp pain in my shin. It takes me a stunned moment to realize Mr. LaBoeuf has kicked me under the table. I flash him a horrified look, but his face is impassive as he casually stabs a fork into his bowl. I suppose I should count myself lucky he did not dig his spurs into me! The table is now fixated on me. I say, \"I'm Mattie…Ro—Rose LaBoeuf.\" grating out the words. I now have a false middle name as well as surname! Clay looks at me as though perhaps I am a bit silly. I do not blame him, frankly. I would think the same were I in his position. Mr. LaBoeuf clears his throat and says, \"she is my sister. We are from just east of El Paso.\" Abigail says, \"Mr. LaBoeuf is a Ranger. He will be assisting in the pursuit of them Mauldin boys who robbed us.\" \"That right,\" Clay says. He looks at Mr. LaBoeuf and I am surprised at hard, unmistakable contempt in his eyes. \"Well, 'hats off' to the Ranger troop.\" It is impossible to ignore the ice in Clay's voice. Abigail goes stiff and passes an anxious sidelong glance at her brother. The men around me keep plugging food into their mouths, but I can sense a tightening in their shoulders, the curious darting of their eyes. If they are eager to see a quarrel go down though, they are disappointed. Mr. LaBoeuf pauses for a long moment, meeting Clay's eyes, but only says, \"Yes, that is correct. I would like to interview you about the incident after dinner.\" \"Always happy to help the law,\" says Clay. His voice is dry as a bone. / I help Abigail with the washing up. The men from the train crew, drowsy on their full bellies, are given a stack of blankets and retire to a little barn around back of the place. I suppose they will bed down in the straw. Despite my long nap this afternoon, I find I am so tired I would happily fall asleep in the straw myself. But Abigail says, \"come on, you will share my bed. I will dig up an old flannel shirt of Mama's that should fit you all right.\" I own I am not particularly pleased to wear some dead woman's night shirt, though I know in my head it is silly to be so \"spooked.\" Abigail brings me to her room, which I quickly realize used to belong to her dead parents. I find I can almost draw a line where their effects end and Abigail's begin—as though I can mark by the objects therein when they died. The sky blue quilt, the iron bed, the milk-glass pitcher on the washstand, these are their things. The small girl's clutch of dried prairie flowers on the beside table, the small colorful beadwork pouches handing from individual pegs in the wall, these are hers. I realize Abigail is younger than I initially thought, probably not much older than myself. As she digs through a trunk of her mother's old clothes I wander to the dresser where I find a tintype of her parents on their wedding day. I am surprised at how fair her father is. He has whiskers not unlike Mr. LaBoeuf's, and a little billy goat's beard. As for his wife, Abigail looks just like her. I say suddenly, \"my father is dead, too. He was shot and killed by a coward in his employment.\" My voice catches in my throat as I think of Tom Chaney's face, his sour breath my cheek as he pressed a dull-edged knife to my throat. Abigail says, \"I am sorry to hear that. My parents died of influenza, along with my three little sisters. It was horrible—we near lost Petey and Henry. Clay and I were wretched with it for a long while, too. Clay was only 17 at the time, but he has done well taking care of the rest of us ever since.\" I say, \"that could not have been easy.\" \"No,\" she agrees. \"But then, you know what it is like to lose a parent. And I am sure Mr. LaBoeuf takes good care of you.\" It takes me a moment to register what she is saying. \"Oh, yes. On account of he is my brother.\" I feel my gut twist at the lie. She is so earnest. Abigail says, \"here we are,\" handing me a green night shirt. I put it on. The hem hits just below the knee. \"My mother was a rather small lady,\" Abigail says by way of apology. I am struck then by the undertone of melancholy in her. It is part of her demeanor, independent of mood—a low mournfulness in her eyes that makes her seem like she is peering at you from the end of a long hallway. It is like in illustrations of the Virgin Mother holding Christ, where her body is dipped in sorrow over His, like the stem of a wilted flower. Some women have this quality by nature. Mother does, and young as she is, so does Victoria. I do not. I point to the beadwork pouches and say, \"did you make these?\" \"Oh!\" Abigail says, her eyes lighting up. \"Yes. Well, many of them. My grandfather, he was full Caddo, he taught me beadwork. Them two medicine pouches on the end are his.\" \"They are all beautiful,\" I say. \"You are very talented.\" \"Thank you.\" Abigail smiles a little. \"Back when my parents were alive, we would go to fairs over in Hooks, and even a few times in Texarkana. I would show my beadwork there while father sold his wares or traded livestock, whatever it was that year. I won a ribbon once. I was just nine years old.\" \"Are you working on any now?\" \"Oh,\" she winces. \"No. The materials are not easy to come by out here. Sometimes we have wagon traders coming through town, but…\" She waves her hand a little, as though shooing off whatever reverie she is in. She says, \"it was only a childhood hobby.\" I have the feeling this is something someone else has told her. I say with sudden vehemence, \"you should take pride in your accomplishments. No one else will do that for you, especially when you are a woman.\" She looks at me in surprise. Finally, she says, \"I suppose you are right about that.\" / Abigail leaves to see Petey and Henry off to bed. She tells me the milk-glass pitcher in the bedroom is just for show and should I like to wash up, she has left a basin in the kitchen sink. I make my way down the narrow hallway and back into the kitchen, which is now dark. Dim light spills from the dining room from where I can hear men's voices. Mr. LaBoeuf is conducting his interview with Clay. I keep my footsteps quiet so as not to disturb them. There is a heel of lye soap by the basin and I reach for it. I do not intend to eavesdrop, but as I bend over the sink I cannot help but overhear Clay saying, \"you have the number wrong. They actually stole three hundred from the barn. Plus the four or so from the register. I can get you the exact amount from my ledger.\" \"Your sister told me it was one hundred in the barn,\" says Mr. LaBoeuf, scratching something onto a piece of paper. Clay gives a frustrated huff and says, \"I told Abigail it was a hundred. Truth is, I do not tell Abigail much about our finances. I do not like to worry her about such matters.\" Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"Where was the money, exactly? Please describe this in detail.s\" \"In the corner of the tack room, under an old milk crate. I had an old lock box with a key that Papa used to keep contracts in. Money was tucked in there.\" Clay sighs, \"I was saving to send Peter and Henry to school in Texarkana, or even Fort Worth. Give them a fighting chance, like you people have down in El Paso, Dallas, wherever. Everywhere else but here.\" At this last part, his voice goes tight and bitter. Mr. LaBoeuf says, \"I am sorry for your loss.\" This just seems to agitate Clay. He says, \"well, perhaps that is sincere, perhaps it ain't, but on the whole the Rangers do not give a damn what goes on in Red Lick, or any place like it.\" I hear Mr. LaBoeuf shift in his chair and I imagine he has gone rigid at this comment. He sets down his pen and says, \"well, hold on now, Mr. Fletcher!\" he says. \"Let's take a moment to cool down. I understand you are upset, but there is no reason to speak ill of the Ranger troop.\" \"I sent word to you boys in Texarkana soon as the robbery 'went down' eight days ago and have heard nothing back. Some defenders of peace!\" Clay retorts. Mr. LaBoeuf (I imagine his face has gone red now) says, \"now, I am sure there is an explanation to that. I am not stationed in Texarkana and cannot account for it, but on behalf of the Ranger troop, I am here now.\" \"Yes,\" agrees Clay. \"And it took a damned train robbery to pin you down!\" I hear his chair scrape back on the floor as he stands angrily. I deliberately drop the heel of soap from my hands. It lands in the basin with a splash. Clay calls out in a much different tone of voice, \"that you, Abby?\" \"It is only me,\" I reply, making my way to the doorway. I say, \"I am washing up for the night.\" The men both look at me, then quickly look away, as though embarrassed. It occurs to me that Mrs. Fletcher's night gown is a good deal shorter than is appropriate for a girl my age to be wearing. I feel my face flush and I quickly retreat out of the circle of lamplight, back into the darkness of the kitchen. \"My apologies for disturbing you gentlemen,\" I say. \"No problem,\" Clay mumbles gruffly, still refusing to face me. \"We, ah—look, Mr. LaBoeuf, it has been a long day for the both of us. Let us retire now and conclude this interview tomorrow morning.\" \"That suits me,\" says Mr. LaBoeuf stiffly. He stands as well. Clay says to him tiredly, \"come. You can sleep in the parlor.\" They push past me with mumbled apologies and disappear into the hallway, leaving me standing in the dark, at the edge of the brimming lamplight.

Ender and Petra had just taken their child to the mall to see the Santa there. The seven year old climbed onto the jolly old man's lap, beaming with joy. \"Hello Santa!\" She said. \"Ho ho ho! Hello little girl! What's your name?\" \"My name is Rosemary Wiggin sir!\" Petra shook her head, her daughter had a habit of calling her superiors sir, even if they were family. \"Rosemary huh? I remember you! Top of the nice list four years in a row!\" Rosemary's smile widened, Santa remembered her. \"Ho ho ho!\" the mall Santa said, \"What would you\" he poked her nose and she giggled, \"like for Christmas?\" Rosemary made a face and her parents looked at each other with a bit of worry. For months their daughter had been asking for a phaser gun, the type they used to use when they were in battle school. Ender shifter nervously, worried about what his daughter would say. She tended to go into detail sometimes, and this would not be good. Their daughter though hard about this, you could see the wheels turning in her head. \"Well…\" She began, \"I'd like a phaser gun, but I don't really want that.\" Rosemary's parents exchanged a confused look. What does she mean she doesn't really want that? She's been ranting about it for months! \"Really? And what would you like?\" Rosemary smiled and looked over at her father, \"I'd like for daddy's nightmares to stop.\" Both Ender's and Petra's face bore a surprised and shocked expression. \"He wakes up screaming during the night, and he begins crying...\" Petra slipped her hand into Ender's. \"Mommy and I comfort him as best we can, but nightmares return almost every night.\" Ender's grip on Petra's hand tightened. \"Santa, you're magical. Could you please use your magic to stop my daddy's nightmares? I don't need the phaser or anything else. I just want my daddy to be ok.\" The Santa sat there with a seven year old on his lap, a seven year old that had just shocked him. Where other seven year olds would have gone on and on about toys and useless baubles, this one seven year old simply wished for her father to be able to sleep peacefully. He looked over at Ender, who was running toward his daughter. Her father swept her into an embrace, while her mother stood to the side with the biggest smile on her face, letting them have this moment. Rosemary closed her eyes and smiled while Ender looked over at the Santa. He looked at the sight before him, a war-torn veteran hugging his daughter, the light of his life, like she was the most precious thing in the world. Ender mouthed thank you, and the Santa saluted. Two weeks later Christmas finally arrived. Rosemary went into her parents' room and jumped on their bed. \"Christmas is here! Christmas is here!\" the little girl yelled. Ender groaned and Petra mumbled \"Five more minutes...\" But the hyper child wouldn't give up. She pulled on her father's hand. After about five minutes the two adults decided it was time to get up. They walked into the living room with their daughter bouncing in front of them. Her eyes lit up when she saw the glittering tree with perfectly wrapped presents arranged neatly under it. She slid in front of the tree and started to tear open her presents, one at a time. She periodically gave one to her parents. Finally there was one present under the tree. It was addressed \"To Rosemary. From Santa. I know how much you wanted this.\" She opened the packing carefully and gasped at what she saw. Inside was a phaser suit, a phaser, and a tiny little package. Rosemay held up the package and read the label. \"Daddy, it's for you\" she said as she handing it to her father. Ender took it gently and opened it. Inside was a glass vile of blue liquid, and a note. \"Dear Ender. I heard you weren't sleeping. This should fix that. Go on, drink up.\" At the bottom was a fancy SC intertwined with reindeer antlers and mistletoe. He chuckled and drank the solution. \"Tastes like peppermint\" he said to his wife and child, who both laughed. The rest of the day Rosemary played with her toys, she even got her father and mother to play battle games with her. At the end of the day Ender tucked her in and kissed her forehead. \"Sleep well daddy.\" She said as he closed the door. Ender settled into the bed next to his wife and turned to face her, \"What do you think that blue liquid was, Ender?\" \"I have no idea… We'll see in the morning I guess.\" From that night on Ender barely had any nightmares, and when he did they weren't severe at all. For the magic of Christmas is boundless.[Chapter 2] Ok so teenage ender and Petra. Petra is going through this stage where all she can think about is Ender and the battle. She develops depression because of the battle and starts to cut her arms. She hides it by wearing her jacket and long sleeves every day. She develops a crush on Ender but never tells him because she is afraid he will reject her, just like her father did when she went to battle school and left. This causes her to cut even more. She and Ender often meet for lunch. Today was one of those days but she couldn't take it. She was so awkward around Ender, she was afraid if everything she did. What if she did something that signaled that she liked him? What if he found out? So she decided not to go. She locked herself in her room and changed into sweats and a tank top because she needed to relax. Therefore she did a bit of yoga before settling down with a nice book. About 15 minutes after she was supposed to meet Ender she heard the lock on her door click open. Immediately forgetting the book she quietly crept around the corner and saw ender entering. She sighed \"oh it's just you.\" \"Ha ha. Ya, just me.\" Ender smiled at her, \"So did you forget we had a lunch date?\" Petra swallowed at the word date, \"Uh... Yes... No... No I didn't. I'm just not feeling well.\" Ender smiled, \"Well call next time! I'll come over.\" Petra sighed \"Will do.\" Ender stood there for a second longer before his goofy smile fell. Petra tilted her head a bit \"Ender?\" \"Petra... What are these?\" Ender said as he walked forward and grabbed both of her arms. \"What are...? Oh... Those\" Petra said, looking sadly down at her cuts. \"Petra. Who hurt you? Why didn't you tell me? I could help! I could\" \"I did\" \"what?\" \"I did Ender...\" She said, looking away, \"I did this to myself.\" A shocked Ender stood in front of her. He looked so grief stricken, so shocked. She hadn't seen him like this since the battle. \"Why?\" A small whisper escaped his lips. She cringed at the heart broken words. \"I couldn't handle the pain. I committed genocide ender. Genocide! I just couldn't take it and the only way to release that anger was to... Mph!\" Ender cut her off by kissing her. It wasn't long, just a short little thing. He pulled away slowly and they both stood there. Petra's hand went to her lips and she slowly raised her eyes to look at his pale blue ones. \"Petra. We were tricked into doing that. We both have the weight of the world on our shoulders but that is no reason to... To do this to your body! You are the most beautiful creature I've ever met. Please, don't scar up your body just because you feel guilt for something you never would have knowingly done.\" Petra stood there, not knowing what to say. Ender, the boy she loved, had just said she was the most beautiful thing he had ever laid eyes on. But that wasn't it. \"Petra I love you... It hurts me to see you like this\" He loved her too. Her worst fears were banished in those three little words. She blinked back tears and ender let go of her hands. \"That... That was uncalled for. I'm sorry Petra. I overstepped.\" \"Ender I...\" The boy turned to leave and she reached out and grabbed his hand. \"Ender, I love you too\" he smiled and turned around, taking her hands in his. \"Please promise me you'll stop defiling your body.\" Petra pulled him into a hug. Ender uttered a small, surprised gasp due to the sudden contact. \"I promise\" she whispered. Ended smiles and wrapped his arm around Petra. They had both confessed, and part of the weight on their shoulders was lifted. ","Summary":" It was Christmas time.

She wasn't one for space. She liked being in enclosed spaces, where the variables were limited, therefore the outcomes were limited. Space introduced all kinds of variables, variables which Hazel couldn't control, and didn't like. Yet she went on the ship anyway. Her mind was screaming, NO NO NO NO NO This is a bad idea, don't you DARE go on that ship but her feet had a mind of their own, and before she knew it, she was strapped into a seat, next to two boys. Ugh, boys. She thought it was rather sexist that more boys were chosen than girls. Sure, the people who ran Battle School claimed that it was the mind patterns and decisions of a subject that influenced them, but Hazel had a secret theory that they thought boys were stronger, boys were better, girls were weaker, just like humanity (well, the males) had thought for thousands, tens of thousands of years. She wanted to change that. She wasn't sure if she could, but she could certainly try. Or maybe fail. We'll see , she thought bitterly. She scrunched down in her seat, avoiding eye contact with anyone around her. New people were unknown variables, too. They could do anything, and until Hazel could read minds (which she didn't see herself doing anytime soon), she would never trust people fully. Yet one boy next to her made an effort to talk to her, even after all of Hazel's prayers to a god she wasn't even sure existed and her body language which she hoped conveyed something like I do not want to talk to you or Leave me alone . \"Oi! You alive?\" the boy next to her said impatiently. British, if Hazel remembered correctly. Which she almost always did. \"Hmm? Oh. Sorry. Yes.\" Hazel spoke in short bursts. She supposed she'd have to get used to talking to people often. Sigh. \"I'm Freddie. You are...?\" he asked her, his dark brown eyes sparkling. \"Hazel.\" she replied. \"You excited for Battle School, Hazel?\" Agh. Conversation. \"Not really...\" she said reluctantly. She wasn't, but who knew what could happen if one of the teachers overheard. \"I mean, I've heard it's kind of violent up there...\" she said. \"Ah, don't worry about it. I'll protect you,\" he said, laughing a little. Hazel wondered if he thought she was the kind of girl that needed protecting. Nevertheless, she blushed, because no one had really ever said anything like that to her before. At her school, she was classified as the weird kid sitting in the back row that didn't talk to anyone. It's not that Hazel was mute, she just didn't like talking, especially to the other shallow, athletic kids. It wasted thinking time. \"Girls can take care of ourselves,\" a girl's voice, through a thick Italian accent, came from in front of her. \"Right?\" \"Right,\" Hazel replied softly. \"Marzia Giovanni,\" the girl said, twisting around in her seat as much as the seat belt would allow her. \"Hazel Thomas,\" Hazel said. Her name sounded so...plain, compared to the others. \"Frederick Winchester the Third,\" Freddie said, grinning. \"Is that your actual name?\" Marzia asked. \"Yep. I'm a third. Both ways,\" he said, still grinning that easy grin. Hazel wondered how he could talk about that and just smile so easily. Hazel heard retching sounds from the other side of the ship, and Hazel, Freddie, and Marzia's heads turned to see a boy looking like he was about to be sick. Hazel winced, and looked away quickly. \"Bag! Give him the bag!\" she heard someone say. Choruses of 'ew' and 'gross' filled the ship. Hazel squeezed her eyes shut, and tried to think of something else. It was then she noticed gravity. The lack of it, actually. Hazel smiled a little, letting her arm float. Come to think of it, gravity was another variable in space. In the Battle Room, there was no gravity. There was no telling how hard it would be to fight in that. That is, if she even could. She heard a small laugh from the other side of the ship, and turned again. Colonel Hyrum Graff, her superior by a lot of ranks, faced the source of the laugh, a boy, with raven black hair that reminded her of her cat's fur spiked to a point, cropped on the sides, like the traditional military haircut all of the boys had. \"What are you doing, Wiggin?\" Colonel Graff asked, an edge to his voice. \"Nothing, sir,\" he responded. Ouch, not a good answer. \"Something funny? I asked you a question, Launchie,\" Graff said, using the nickname for the fresh recruits. \"Sir, the way you're floating. Horizontal. I thought that was funny.\" Hazel tilted her head, like the boy had. He was right, Graff was floating horizontal. Or vertical, she thought. There is no up or down or left or right in space. Just...space. And frankly, that alarmed her, because how was she supposed to orient herself? Humans were used to gravity, you just expect to yank a flower out of the dirt, put it in rocks, and expect it to grow? \"Is that funny?\" \"Sir, no, sir.\" Ah, there it was. This kid had a brain after all. \"Yes, it is. Alai, you know what he's talking about?\" Graff faced another boy, one decidedly less handsome. Hazel wanted to say YES but she knew she couldn't, because then she would get in trouble and trouble was bad and she would get iced or even worse, ridiculed... \"Yes, sir.\" \"No, you don't. There's only one kid on this launch with any brains at all so far and that's Ender Wiggin.\" All eyes turned to Ender, and Hazel could see his face turning red under the flourescent lighting. Hazel saw what Graff was doing. Turning the other children against him. Why, she didn't know, but she had seen this happen before. Mostly to her. Ah, the good old days. Hazel heard Freddie mutter something that she was not allowed to say at home and rhymed with \"mart glass\". She smiled slightly. \"Couldn't agree more,\" Marzia replied. \"Commanders here play favorites. Wiggin's bright, no doubt about it. That just means the rest of us will have to work twice as hard to even get noticed.\" Hazel noticed a bitter undertone to her voice. \"Well, would you really want to be noticed here?\" She immediately regretted what she said, they would just see her as a coward, her first sort-of-friends, now turned against her like all of her other sort-of-friends. Sure enough, Marzia and Freddie stared at her like she was crazy. \"What do you mean?\" Marzia said after a moment of silence. \"Of course you would want to be noticed. Isn't that the entire point of Battle School, to move up in the rankings, and get a high-ranking position defending our home?\" \"Well, yeah...\" Hazel said quietly. \"Just...I've heard it's violent here, and some kids have...anger issues...and probably won't take well to teacher's pets.\" \"No kidding,\" Freddie said dryly. \"You've gotta learn how to defend yourself here, to hurt them before they can hurt you. It's all about being ahead of your enemy,\" he said, tapping the side of his head. Hazel knew that of course, but she had to admit she hadn't really thought of it that way before. Hurt them before they could hurt you. For anyone else, it would have been easy. \"If they've got offense, strengthen your defense,\" Marzia added. \"Walls are built to keep people out. Make your walls the strongest.\" Oh, if only she knew how strong Hazel's mental walls were. Freddie put a hand on her shoulder, and Hazel flinched slightly at the touch. He didn't seem to notice, though. \"Don't worry. You'll survive.\" It was supposed to make Hazel feel better, but it didn't, instead, it plunged her mind into a whirlwind of worry, like it always did. Survive? Was he implying she might not survive? Or just not be iced? Would she get iced? How would her parents react to her getting iced? It always came down to that, Hazel worrying about getting iced. It was, to say the least, her worst fear. Aside from getting hurt in Battle School, but that was really a given. ... The rest of the ride passed with no events or incidents, just Marzia and Freddie idly chatting, Hazel listening in and sometimes even adding to the conversation. Her mother would be proud. Something that was unexpected, however, was the fact that Hazel kept glancing over to the raven-haired boy. Ender Wiggin, child prodigy, a prodigy of prodigies, as she had overheard Graff whisper to Major Anderson. Not talking made you an extremely good listener. She told herself she was curious, curious about him, what made him say that, what made him tick. And for the most part, it was true. For the most part. A little while later, she felt the ship dock into the International Fleet space station. Away from Earth. Away from home. Sure, it had its downsides, but she would take home any day over the I.F. Graff told them to unstrap themselves, to follow him. Hazel, Marzia, and Freddie did what they were told. They filed out, single file, to the I.F. Somewhere, Hazel got separated from Marzia and Freddie, lost in the sea of bodies and canary yellow jumpsuits. But she found herself next to the raven-haired boy, next to Ender. Ender was stopped by Graff on the way out. Keeping a straight face, Hazel looked ahead, but kept her ears trained on Ender and Graff. \"Sir, you made them hate me,\" he said. \"I told them you were the best. We need a Julius Caesar, a Napoleon,\" he said simply. Hazel recognized this from history class. \"We hope that will be you,\" Major Anderson added. \"Caesar was assassinated by the people he trusted,\" Ender deadpanned. \"And Napoleon lost in the end,\" Anderson said, tension audible in her voice. \"Not before he conquered the known world,\" Graff said, while Hazel imagined the smirk on his face. She didn't hear anything after that, following the crowd out of the shuttle. … \"You don't want the bunks by the door,\" Freddie said, steering Hazel to the back of the room. \"Why?\" she asked. That made no sense. If you were by the door, you could get out of the room faster, be more efficient. \"I dunno. It's just a thing,\" he replied. But Hazel and Freddie found that most of the bunks in the back of the room were already taken. Freddie winced, and took a bunk in the middle. He motioned for Hazel to do the same, to get the one below him, but she wasn't fast enough. She went for the one next to him, but that was quickly snatched up, too. She had no choice but to get one by the door. She wasn't that disappointed, though, she still didn't understand why the ones by the door were so bad. Status, maybe? If that was the case, she didn't really care. Nothing could drag her status down more by now, students were probably realizing she was a pushover. She took the bottom bunk of one of the beds nearest to the door. Oh well, it didn't really matter. She saw someone fill up the space above her, and she studied them, noting the familiar head of coppery hair, and realized it was Marzia. \"Freddie still paranoid about all the Battle School rituals?\" she asked, grinning down at Hazel. Hazel nodded, a smile on her face. \"Yeah. I really don't see why these bunks are bad, I mean, we get out first, so...\" Marzia laughed, bittersweet. \"That's true. First to the battle room, first to get our butts kicked.\" She didn't actually say butts, but Hazel changed it in her mind. A figure walked in the door, Ender, she noted. A boy in the back of the room, a larger boy, crossed his arms. \"Oh look. The smart $$,\" he said. Hazel mentally chided him. Language. Everyone turned to look at Ender, all eyes on him. Ender stood there, icy eyes surveying the room. The only bunk left was the bottom one closest to the door. He glanced at it. \"Thanks,\" he said cooly. \"I thought I'd have to ask to be by the door.\" The recruits, including Hazel and Marzia, then proceeded to code their lockers. \"Speak your name,\" said the female voice of the computer. \"Hazel Thomas,\" Hazel replied. The screen embedded next to her bunk then spun around, revealing a flash suit, helmet, extra uniforms, and a weird-looking laser gun thing behind it. She studied the object, when a British voice rang out. \"Don't freeze your balls, kid,\" said a black man in an I.F. uniform. Hazel identified him as a sergeant. \"Attention on deck!\" someone said. Hazel scrambled to get in position, the neat rows of kids lining the walls. \"At ease.\" Hazel tried not to stare at Ender, who was directly across from her. He, however, didn't even glance at her, his attention focused on the sergeant. She sighed in her mind. \"LISTEN UP LAUNCHIES!\" yelled the sergeant. \"My name is Sergeant James Dap, ask me a legitimate question, and I will give you a direct answer!\" Hazel tried not to shrink away from Sergeant Dap's...loudness. \"But if you're looking for a shoulder to cry on, use a pillow!\" Ouch. Harsh. \"DO I LOOK LIKE I'M JOKING, SNOTS?\" Hazel's eyes widened. She did not like Sergeant Dap at all. She wondered if Ender noticed her fear. She hoped not. Marzia, Hazel noticed, kept a stony look of blankness on her face. She admired that. \"SIR YES SIR!\" the recruits chorused. \"Good! You are to work as a team. You will make this bunkroom your home. You will keep your home clean. There are seperate showers for both genders. If you are found in an area not designated to your gender, I will personally neuter you! Am I clear?\" Sergeant Dap had reached Hazel. She tried to wash away the look of terror on her face that was probably there and replace it with Marzia's blank stare. \"SIR YES SIR!\" Dap turned to look at Ender, Ender staring back at him. For a moment, Hazel wondered if Ender would question Dap, but Dap looked away. \"Class is in five! Follow the yellow lights, yellow like your current selves!\" \"SIR YES SIR!\" Dap then left the room, leaving the recruits to scramble all over themselves, following the yellow lights. Freddie jogged up to the front of the room, standing in front of Hazel and Marzia. \"I'm sticking with you guys. Nice to know I actually have some friends in this place.\" Hazel smiled at him, she really felt the same way. Friends were a luxury in Battle School, sometimes even on Earth. Not everyone was lucky enough to have friends, and Hazel was glad she was one of the lucky few to have friends in Battle School. Well, she hoped they were her friends. With Freddie and Marzia at her sides, she followed the yellow lights. It was EXCRUCIATING to find all of the right lines, I hope I did find all of them. I probably won't do that for the next few chapters, I might make up some lines that sound vaguely like the ones said in the movie. Sorry if that bothers you, but YOU try spending an hour searching for quotes from the movie.[Chapter 2] Variable Chapter Two \"He thinks he has friends.\" \"What are you implying, Anderson?\" \"It's up to you to determine whether that's good or not. I was simply stating a fact.\" \"Of course it isn't good! Where were you when we decided to isolate Ender? Shouldn't we be doing the same with him?\" \"That's your decision, not mine.\" \"Well, what's your imput? And that's an order, Major.\" \"May I speak freely?\" \"Speak.\" \"Well, my imput is why didn't you isolate him like you did with Ender?\" \"They would have found solace in each other. I couldn't have that. They're both extremely promising, but we agreed Ender was the one.\" \"Look again. Did you even listen to the audio recording?\" \"Of what?\" \"On the shuttle. When he was talking to the two girls.\" \"No, not yet. Is there something I should listen to?\" \"I find it promising.\" \"Play it.\" \"No kidding. You've gotta learn to defend yourself here, to hurt them before they hurt you. It's all about being ahead of your enemy.\" \"And this means what, Anderson? You're the psychologist here.\" \"It means that this is his mentality. Hurt them before they hurt you. Remind you of anything?\" \"Don't get smart with me.\" \"What Ender said, why he put the Stilson boy in the hospital. To win all the other battles after the first. Hurting them before they hurt you.\" \"But Freddie is willing to hurt others. Ender didn't want to, he just...snapped. Do you remember how Ender would just sit there and take it, make no action to stop them, and how Freddie would be the one sending threats to the bullies, setting up ambushes?\" \"It was all in self-defense.\" \"Yes, you're right, yet Freddie was always one step ahead. Cunning. And do you know what cunning leads to? You remember Peter Wiggin, right?\" \"He was sadistic. Freddie isn't.\" \"But he could be.\" \"But he chooses not to be. Yes, he could, but he isn't. He's got a good heart, just not to his enemies. That's something we need, something Ender doesn't have. Ender has a good heart through and through. Freddie is variable.\" \"What are you suggesting we do?\" \"Manipulate him. Push his buttons. See how far he's willing to go. See how he reacts to threats, even with his friends around. Let him keep the girls for now.\" \"Who are the girls, again?\" \"Hazel Thomas. Second born, of Pennsylvania, America. Marzia Giovanni, first born, of Verona, Italy.\" \"Why are they here? I didn't authorize them...\" \"I authorized Hazel. Major Queensbury authorized Marzia. Hazel has a brilliant mind for decision making, she's able to analyze and evaluate situations, and choose the one with most benefit for her or her family in record times. However, she's cripplingly shy, and she just takes bullying, like Ender. Though she doesn't fight back, she never has. Marzia is a master of the poker face, she can completely disguise her emotions. It's incredibly hard to read her by anything other than what she's giving off. A useful skill, though I'm not sure why Queensbury wanted her up here.\" \"Hazel's gonna get iced. You have to learn how to fight back.\" \"I'm hoping she will, with Marzia and Freddie. Worse comes to worse, we might have to ice here, even though we could really use her up here.\" \"Where are they now?\" \"Heading to class.\" \"Play the recording.\" \"You been staring at someone, Haze?\" \"NO! Just...I don't know, he seems to get in trouble a lot...\" \"Questioning the system. I like that.\" \"Why, you questioning it?\" \"I'd prefer not to speak with cameras undoubtably watching our every move.\" \"Good point, Fred.\" \"Freddie.\" \"Winchester.\" \"Freddie.\" \"Third.\" \" What ?\" \"Think he'll snap, Anderson?\" \"I'm really not sure. You authorized him, remember?\" \"Oh...sorry, I didn't mean it like that...\" \"Let's hope you didn't.\" \"Was that what you would qualify as snapping, Colonel?\" \"He handled it well.\" \"I'd like to think so.\" \"We should check in on Ender.\" \"I'll pull up the recording.\" ","Summary":" Variable Chapter One Hazel Thomas wrinkled her nose at the sight of the spaceship.

They were several million miles from Earth, stuck on a godforsaken planet in what was undoubtedly a rather unpleasant corner of the universe. \"'Morning Mace.\" A voice spoke in the Squadron Leader's ear, jerking him away from his thoughts. Kane turned and saw Captain Cray Chester standing behind him. \"'Morning skipper. You slept well I trust?\" He inquired. Cray grinned. \"Like the dead – pretty darn knackered after those manoeuvres yesterday.\" Kane winced at the thought. It was fair to say their final day of simulation training hadn't gone exactly to plan. Still, today would be different – it had to be different. Real lives would be at stake from now on, a pressure incomparable to computer-generated holograms. Every decision made in the Command Room could bring doom to countless Formics, or just as easily cost thousands of frontline soldiers their lives. This was to be war at its most advanced – the third and final Formic conflict. The queue slowly crawled towards the serving hatches, the anxiety playing on Kane's mind as he waited. \"You seen the menu?\" Kane spoke for the sake of speaking. \"Hell yeah.\" Replied Cray, grimacing. He didn't seem nervous at all. \"What I wouldn't give for a steamin' hot bowl of porridge.\" Kane nodded, glad for the conversation. \"Why stop there? What about a fry up, with bacon, and beans, and hash browns…\" \"I bet even the Formics eat better than this.\" Cray murmured, his voice quieting as they came within earshot of the kitchen staff. They finally reached the end of the queue and picked up their trays, sitting down at one of the many tables laid out in the Officer's Mess. Kane poked at his food, wrinkling his nose as grey, stodgy lumps sloshed about his plate. He wasn't hungry – something Cray noticed. \"The sooner this new Commander gets here, the sooner we annihilate the buggers and the sooner we can go home. And home means good food.\" The Captain said consolingly. \"D'ya think the new boss will come down here to eat?\" Kane wondered. Cray shook his head. \"I doubt it. I heard he doesn't need food, or water, or sleep! Not that I believe that of course.\" He added hastily. \"He's only human, unless of course they trained a Formic specially for the job.\" Kane was about to reply but was cut off by a loud yell, booming through the canteen. \"Ten-hut!\" Everybody stood up to attention as one, turning towards a raised platform at one end of the hall, where Colonel Graff was standing. \"At ease.\" He spoke. \"Pilots of the International Fleet.\" Said Graff, leaning on the dais. \"Today your training ends and the real war begins. Today our finest Commander will take charge of you for the first time – the first battle of what will undoubtedly be a long and hard crusade, but one in which I have absolute faith in you to succeed. I trust my confidence is not misplaced?\" The occupants of the canteen snapped to attention and uttered in unison. \"Sir, no sir!\" Then they stood back at ease. Colonel Graff nodded. \"Now as you know, you have been divided into Battle Groups, each of which will be directed by a Group Captain, hand picked from Battle School – you will be introduced to your respective leader shortly. Remember your training, good luck and give 'em hell. Parade in the Briefing Room – ten minutes. Don't let us down.\" \"Ten-hut!\" The voice bellowed again and once more everyone in the room stood to attention. Graff took one final glance around the room and strode out. Almost instantly, the occupants of the Officer's Mess sat down and the dull murmur of conversation resumed. It was Kane who spoke first, shaking his head sadly. \"I'm not so sure that confidence of his is in the right place.\" Cray shrugged. \"We'll soon find out. I reckon he's right, we got this.\" \"But the team ain't ready. You saw what happened yesterday, we were dead meat once those Formic carriers opened up…\" Said Kane. \"Look Mace, that was with me in command – I'm a pilot, not a bloody Admiral. Trust me, with a proper Commander in charge, those carriers will be a piece o' cake.\" Replied Cray. \"I hope you're right skip.\" Said Kane. \"Ain't I always?\" Said Cray cheerfully. \"Now eat up, we've got a war to win. ... The Command Room Kane sat at his console in the Command Room, idly drumming his fingers on the VR headpiece lying in front of him. Sitting to his left, the two Flight Sergeants were talking quietly while Cray sat on his right, also beating out a rhythm on his helmet. They had been sitting there for over an hour and the air in the Command Room could have been cut with a knife, nervous tension weighing heavily upon each pilot's shoulders. They were the chosen ones; scarcely through puberty but expected to rid humanity of the Formic threat once and for all. Kane stopped tapping his deactivated headpiece and turned to Cray. \"He's late.\" \"He's a genius, what do you expect? Braincases ain't known for their punctuality.\" Cray replied, without taking his eyes off the platform in front of them. The room was in fact a massive cave, set deep into the mountains backing onto Command School. It was comprised of two curved banks of control consoles, flanking a large platform where the Commander and his aides were positioned. At least they would be, if they weren't late. Kane glanced round at the two Flight Sergeants and gave them a reassuring smile, transmitting a confidence he didn't feel. They were both younger than the Squadron Leader, at only fourteen years of age. Even so, they were extremely capable drone pilots and had given Kane a run for his money on the combat simulator many times. Simulator. Always on the simulator. And now they're expected to win a real-life war for the entire human race. Thought Kane, and was about to voice his thoughts to Cray when the doors behind the platform hissed open and five officers strode in – one female, the rest male. Kane recognised the smallest as Acting Group Captain Delphiki – although according to his nametag, he was just known as \"Bean\". They had spoken briefly at the parade just over an hour ago, and apparently Bean had been through Battle School with the Commander. The only other information Kane had been able to glean was the new boss's name, which was Wiggin. Commander Ender Wiggin. \"Ten-hut!\" The command echoed around Command Room and the pilots stood up to attention, eying the newcomers as they did so. The doors hissed shut behind the officers and they took up position in a semicircle around the platform, facing whence they had just come. A few moments later the doors opened again, and this time just two people entered: one boy and one man. Kane had never seen the man before – he would have remembered if he had, as his face bore strange markings, forming some kind of pattern. The Squadron Leader wondered if he was the new Commander, but dismissed the notion instantly. Too old. He thought and turned his attention to the boy instead. His complexion was dark and his steely blue eyes swept the room, taking in the rows and rows of pilots standing tensely behind their consoles in one glance. The two stopped when they reached the semicircle of officers and it was the boy who spoke, his voice assertively carrying to the ears of every pilot in the room, instantly impressing his command. \"At ease.\" He said. Definitely the Commander. As the pilots sat down at their consoles once more, the Commander exchanged words with his officers that Kane couldn't make out. A moment later the officers snapped to attention themselves and made their way to the five seats positioned on the platform. A moment later, every console in the room initialised in unison, VR helmets sparking into life. Kane exchanged a thin smile with Cray. \"Looks like this is it.\" \"Good hunting.\" Replied Cray and pulled on his headpiece. Kane took a deep breath and did the same. ... Virtual Reality The headpiece display was the same as in the simulator but of a much higher resolution, displaying the emptiness of space in far greater detail. In fact, this was not a computer-generated image at all, instead a computer-enhanced display comprised of real-time camera feeds augmented by the base's mainframe. The Squadron Leader reached out with both hands and felt for the twin joysticks in front of him, grasping them firmly and rotating full circles to check for obstructions. Satisfied that all was well, he pressed a button beside the left joystick, bringing up his HUD. The green lines and numbers instantly appeared, overlaying and brightening the dark display. Kane experimentally turned his head from side to side and then up and down, testing his view indicator was working correctly; it was. After a few more checks, Kane pressed another button, this time mounted on his right-hand joystick. The transmit icon popped up in his helmet and he spoke. \"Mason here – request status report.\" The radio crackled in his ear almost immediately. \"Flight Sergeant Samuelson reporting all systems go.\" A moment later the other Flight Sergeant reported in. \"Frost here sir. All good to go.\" \"Copy that. Let's check out our ships.\" Said Kane, his hand moving over the controls on his console. His view changed and the display now showed a group of starships, each bearing the International Fleet emblem and apparently stationary. The Squadron Leader immediately recognised the craft as belonging to Battle Group Two, commanded by Bean and including No.27 Squadron – Kane's Squadron. Kane zoomed in his display and picked out the ships directly related to BG-2: one carrier, transporting 150 drone fighters, thirty of which were under his command; one Juggernaut class cruiser, controlled by Captain Chester; and lastly three Dreadnought class battleships, each armed with high-yield cannons of which Bean himself was in charge. \"Better than CG ships, eh lads?\" Kane remarked in awe. \"You bet boss!\" Kwesi echoed. \"And we've got 'em all to ourselves!\" Added Beta. A moment later the fleet began to move, each ship moving in perfect unison, creating the illusion of the presence of one huge craft. A warning flashed at the top left of Kane's screen, accompanied by an audible beeping. 'WARNING: International Fleet entering Formic detection range. All crew to Battle Stations.\"' The alert read. Kane cancelled the warning with a deft flick of his left joystick – he didn't need reminding of the danger the Formics posed. \"Looks like this is it. Good luck everybody.\" Cray's voice grimly sounded in Kane's ears. Almost before he had finished speaking, another alert message appeared in Kane's visor. '27 SQUADRON – DEPLOYMENT AUTHORISED' It said. Kane gazed at the words, for a millisecond unable to register what was actually happening – all his years of training, his entire life even, had been geared towards this moment. They were at war, there was to be no turning back now, no shirking of duties – the time was nigh. He steeled himself one final time, took a deep, calming breath and spoke. \"Squadron Scramble!\" \"Yes sir!\" The Flight Sergeants chorused, almost gleeful in their eagerness to get going. They were excited, excited at finally being given the chance to prove their worth in a real battle – they knew to leave the worrying to their superior. After all, that was his job, they were just there to fly space fighters! Kane twisted both joysticks and watched as thirty RSF-7B 'Cyclone' drone fighters explosively detached themselves from the carrier and initiated their engine start sequences. Just like on the simulator. Pretend it's only a game. Just a game. Status indicators illuminated on Kane's HUD one by one until each drone was represented by small symbol. He noted with satisfaction that they were all green, meaning the drones were combat ready. \"Sammy, you're B Flight leader – over to you.\" Said Kane, selecting ten drones and switching them over to Beta's control. The corresponding indicators disappeared from the Squadron Leader's screen. \"Copy that sir, assuming control.\" Beta replied. \"Jacko, you take C Flight – handing over now.\" Kane addressed his other Flight Sergeant and relinquished another ten fighters. \"Roger, I have control.\" Said Kwesi. Kane closed his hand over the right joystick and powered up the fighters with his thumb. While the engines were spooling up he switched the view to a camera mounted on the cockpit of the lead drone and pressed a button marked 'Declare' – the latter's function was to notify the Group Captain of 27 Squadron's readiness to engage in combat. \"Ok lads, form up on my lead.\" Said Kane and maneuvered his fighters into a line astern configuration. He turned his head and the camera mounted on the drone also turned, allowing him to watch as Beta and Kwesi brought their fighters alongside Kane's. A tone sounded in the Squadron Leader's ears, followed by an electronic voice. \"Stand by for orders. Stand by for orders. Stand by for orders.\" There was a serene calmness about the computerised sound that was somehow irritating and Kane was glad when the promised orders finally scrolled across his display. '27 SQUADRON INSTRUCTION: Assigned to BG-2 formation; Combat Air Patrol; Sector 17; Grid 370B – 788K; Engage on sight.' \"Time to put the hammer down.\" Kane said quietly and flicked the throttle open with his thumb. His ten drones accelerated quickly away from the carrier group, B and C Flights following closely. Sector 17 was not far from the International Fleet's position; in fact, it took around thirty seconds to reach at full throttle. The sector itself was bisected by a thin asteroid belt – this posed no obstacle to the nimble Cyclone fighters but would slow the larger ships down, hindering the fleet's progress by several days. This made the sector an important tactical objective and Kane assumed the fighters were being sent in advance to secure it. As they neared the asteroids Kane noticed more and more fighters appearing until, by the time they entered the belt, every fighter in Battle Group Two had joined them, forming one huge formation. More orders scrolled across Kane's visor, instructing him to form a parabolic formation with squadrons 20 to 30. He swiftly guided his drones into formation as instructed and watched as Beta and Kwesi did the same. Suddenly three radar-warning triangles appeared on his HUD, indicating the presence of three unidentified craft. \"Mace here – you getting those bogeys?\" Kane broadcasted on the battle group wide channel, communicating directly with the other Squadron Leaders assigned to BG-2. \"Sure am.\" A voice confirmed amid general mutterings of agreement. \"Roger that, let's go get 'em.\" Replied Kane. He switched back to the 27 Squadron channel. \"Bogeys confirmed as hostile, stand by to engage. Safeties off boys.\" He said. \"Ready to engage boss!\" Kane could hear the excitement in Kwesi's voice. \"Good to go sir!\" Beta wasn't any less keyed up. Kane returned to watching his screen intently, searching for any visual trace of the hostiles. There was nothing to be seen, nothing, nothing, nothing, then… \"I see them! There they are!\" Kwesi yelled over the intercom, almost bursting his colleagues' eardrums. Sure enough, hovering just above a blanket of icy asteroids, were three Formic carriers. \"Copy that 'Flight!\" Replied Kane before hastily switching to the Group intercom again. \"Fox three Bandits, one o' clock low! Three transports just above the ice!\" \"I have the Bandits. Engaging when in range.\" Someone called out. \"Permission to attack sir?\" Asked Beta, eager to prove he was just as useful as his opposite number. \"Negative Sammy…Hold fire until the very last second.\" Kane spoke in a half whisper as the formation roared ever closer to the blissfully unaware Formic carriers. \"Not yet… Not yet… Now! Open fire!\" Kane yelled and simultaneously pulled the trigger on his joystick, unleashing a fiery hail of laser pulses from the cannons mounted on the wings of his drone fighters. \"Yee-haa!\" Kwesi whooped over the intercom as pulses tore into the Formic ships, blasting away at the semi-deployed shields. \"Give 'em hell, the man said!\" Beta chuckled. Kane was not so happy; something about the situation didn't seem right to him, and it didn't take long to find out what. Large numbers of Formic fighter craft were appearing from underneath the carriers. They're swarming… We walked straight into a trap! I knew we weren't ready, it's the same as on the simulators – we'll be cut to pieces! Kane was about to yell a warning to the battle group when the ice beneath the carriers began to disintegrate. The words stuck in his throat as he watched three huge plasma beams burst through the frozen asteroids and pierced the bellies of the Formic ships, impaling the insect-like craft. A moment later they exploded into a million pieces, the swarming fighters plummeting lifelessly onto the ice bellow. Two words appeared on Kane's screen. 'MISSION COMPLETE'. Just like a game. Kane absently pressed several buttons on his left joystick, sending the drones back to their transports and powering down his Virtual Reality helmet. As the HUD died he slipped the headset off, blinking as his eyes accustomed once again to the gloom of the Command Room. ... Command Room Kane stood up and exchanged wide-eyed stares with Beta and Kwesi, who had also removed their helmets. They were still slightly shell-shocked at the speed it had all unfolded and the decisiveness of the Formic ships' destruction. It was unlike anything they had ever seen before, even on the simulator. It was only really comparable to one thing: the video. Everyone had seen the video – it was the International Fleet's propaganda mainstay and what kept everyone together. But today, the actions of Commander Wiggin had been… Rackham-esque. Kane was fully convinced. He truly is our finest Commander. There was only one thing to do, and this sentiment was echoed by every other drone pilot in the room. They stood and, as one, applauded Commander Ender Wiggin.[Chapter 2] The Officer's Mess hall was bouncing that night – the Flight Sergeants and lower ranks had been invited up to join the officers for the evening, and Senior Command had seen to it that a case of ancient soft drinks was left suggestively in the centre of the room, much to the delight of the younger pilots present. At the far end of the hall, a trio from the tech & maintenance division had set up an impromptu stage on old packing cases and were attempting a performance that those who were slightly hard of hearing – or even completely deaf – might describe as vaguely musical in nature. Midway down the hall, Cray, Kwesi, Beta and two other young Flight Sergeants were sitting at a small table, chatting amongst themselves and laughing as they reminisced over old times at Battle School. Kane sat a little apart from the group, absorbed in his own thoughts. \"…So then Tyro grabs his helmet, chucks it out the airlock and says 'And next time, don't forget to floss!'\" One of Kwesi and Beta's friends - who's name was Joey - finished his story and the others erupted into fits of giggles, Cray laughing so hard that he somehow managed to bang his head on the table, causing even more hysterics among the youngsters. Although pilots were hand picked for their outstanding performance during academy simulator tests while still on Earth, they were still required to attend Battle School like everyone else. However, instead of undergoing the more complex strategy training, pilot cadets were transferred to Flight School where they spent their days learning advanced combat manoeuvres, tactical formations likely to be employed and space navigation techniques. This was the point where ranks were determined; leadership and ability to manage a combat situation led to the command of a Squadron; anticipation of the enemy and strategic awareness were attributes looked for in a Space Captain; while other ranks were simply related to overall flying skill. \"That reminds me of a lad I used to know, back then.\" Said Cray once he'd got his breath back. \"Sven his name was – we had one hell of a laugh together. In the end the poor fella got iced for booby-trappin' the Duty Sergeant's bidet. The last thing he said before they came for him was that it was gonna be worth every freezin' cold second!\" The Sergeants giggled. \"You remember Sven, Mace?\" Cray asked. There was no reply. \"C'mon, Mace? Wakey-wakey!\" The Captain persisted. Kane snapped out of his daydream. \"W-Who? Sven? Oh yeah, how could I forget 'ol bugger face.\" He replied gloomily. Cray chuckled and whispered playfully to the others, just loud enough for Kane to hear. \"You see lads, Private Mason here didn't get on too well with Sven 'Chomper' McBride.\" \"Damn right I didn't.\" Kane agreed. \"That bastard almost bit my ear off before we were out the atmosphere!\" \"To be fair, that was only after Mace described Sven's sister as… Now let me think, what was that word he used… Ah yes, 'Banging', I believe it was.\" Cray explained to the youngsters in a stage whisper. They shook their heads and tutted in mock disapproval, loving their inclusion in the officers' banter. Kane was about to reply with a suitably scathing retort when Cray held up a finger. \"Hold on, I'm not finished yet. I also seem to remember you referring to his mother as 'a right hotty'…\" \"Well, she was.\" Kane protested. \"…And saying his father was an 'old crock'. In fact, I reckon the only member of his family you refrained from insulting was his pet chinchilla.\" Cray finished triumphantly. \"Fair point, I did forget about the rodent.\" Kane conceded sarcastically, amidst more giggles from the younger contingent. \"But the bidet prank? Please. So last year.\" \"That's rich coming from the sole perpetrator of the 'starfish' prank – I did tell you not to use boiling water.\" Cray mocked. \"Always have to be right, don't you Chester.\" Replied Kane, leaning back in his seat and casting his eyes to the ceiling. Cray had known the Squadron Leader long enough to detect a slight hint of irritation in his reply – a reference to their earlier conversation, perhaps. \"Touché my friend, touché.\" The Captain addressed his friend lightly, before turning to the Flight Sergeants. \"Listen, why don't you boys go find some more drinks – looks to me like five-three Squadron have more than their fair share.\" He pointed to where Squadron Leader Dill Taggart was sitting with his flight crew. This fact was not lost on the youngsters and they set off bent double, apparently hatching a cunning plan to repossess the soft drinks with the clever use of distractions, diversions and Kwesi's jacket. Cray pulled his chair up in front of Kane and sat on it backwards, facing his friend. \"Come on then, spit it out.\" Kane looked at him blankly. \"Spit what out?\" Cray rolled his eyes. \"Ever since that engagement you haven't been yourself. Hell, ever since you found out about this new Commander you've been acting weird. So what's biting ya? Other than Sven of course...\" Kane smiled slightly and stared at Cray for a moment – it seemed strange to think they had first met at six years old, an unthinkably long distance away back on Earth. They had spent most of their lives together, one way and another. Both were only children, but they were nothing less than brothers to each other – albeit, brothers in arms. \"Look Cray… We just took hundreds, maybe even thousands of lives. It doesn't matter that they're Formics, they're still alive and… Well, living. And I killed them. Me, out here, from the comfort of a VR helmet. And that's not even the worst part; here we are, partying, drinking, playing music and celebrating when all we've done is start yet another war. And this time… This time it's supposed to be the end. For one of us, anyway.\" Kane paused and looked over his shoulder, subconsciously checking nobody else had heard. Cray sighed heavily. \"It's like we always say Mace – it's a game, just a game.\" \"Except it isn't a game anymore.\" Kane persisted. \"You try telling that to the families of those buggers we just killed. Hell, you try telling that to the Commander.\" \"Mace, I was there too – it wasn't so bad…\" Cray started but Kane cut him off. \"You didn't pull the trigger. You didn't make them crash and burn. Real ships, real people, not sims.\" \"Formics, Mace, not people! Aliens that want to see us all destroyed!\" Cray corrected him. \"And you gotta stop thinking like this – what good is it gonna do? Command will find out, you'll get yourself relieved of duty, iced and sent back to Earth on a charge, and then what'll happen to two-seven? The boys need you Mace… Hell, I need you. You and me, the best of the best. The way it's always been, right?\" Before Kane could reply, the conquering heroes – aka Kwesi, Beta, Joey and Kath – returned with their cargo of pilfered drinks. Before turning to congratulate them on their haul, Cray raised his eyebrows at Kane, who nodded slightly in return; the message was clear. The Squadron Leader had to pull himself together and get on with the task at hand. Time enough for a conscience later; they had to finish what they had started. The third and final Formic war had begun, and nothing anybody could say was going to change that. ","Summary":" Squadron Leader *Beep* *Beep* *Beep* The alarm echoed around the sleeping chamber, waking the three"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"Where The Soul Never Dies","Author":"Code Green","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10517103","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One: I'm On My Way to that Fair Land She could still smell smoke. True, it had been five days since the fire, but the scent seemed permanently lodged in Mattie's nose. She had never been opposed to fire, rather, she had once liked it. It had warmed her hands on cold days when she had traveled with Rooster Cogburn. It had cooked her food when she shared a meal with LaBoeuf. Up until five days ago, it had been an ally, a dear friend, but it had fast turned into a terrifying enemy. It had only taken one spark, one tiny lick, to catch hold of the chimney and burn down the entire house. Tiny spit drops of red and orange had leaped across the dirt surrounding the house to grab hold of one solitary strand of hay. The fields had gone up into flames in a matter of seconds, the barn had followed suit, and it was by mere good providence that the family and workers on the farm had escaped, rescuing several of the animals as well. Mr. Ross had often mentioned to his eldest daughter how the tongue was \"a fire\" and \"a world of iniquity.\" Of course, he had been trying to teach Mattie to watch her tongue, yet even now, she didn't fully heed the verses of Scripture. Her temper was still as fiery as ever, but she hoped it couldn't cause as much destruction as the recent fire had. It saddened her, and her heart ached that there was no longer a farm. It had been doing so well, too. Three years has passed since she had shot down Tom Chaney, and in those three years, she had exerted most of her energy to building up Papa's farm. The rest of her energy had been spent on helping Mama with the children and in teaching Mama how to read. Mrs. Ross was doing fairly well with her reading, now being able to read simple words like \"cat,\" much to Mattie's pride. No amount of reading would comfort the woman, however, and Mattie glanced to her mother with concern as the wagon they were sitting on jostled and bumped over uneven dirt ground. Mama was dabbing her wet eyes with a handkerchief, doing her best to keep her crying and misery to herself as Yarnell patted her kindly on the back. It had been difficult enough losing her husband, but losing his farm had been a truly powerful blow. She hadn't complained, but she hadn't been able to stop crying either, not even when a letter had arrived at the home where she and her children were staying while trying to determine what course of action to take after the great blaze. Mattie had read the letter to her, and the beautiful, elegant writing had been accompanied by a small sum of money, enough to bring Mama and her children to Bordertown, Texas. Mattie didn't think much of Texas, but she knew that Mama was excited, despite her crying, to see the sisters who had so generously invited the family to come live with them. Mama loved to talk about her sisters, and Mattie felt as though she knew them, although she had never met them. There were three sisters, and all lived in Bordertown, Texas. Rosemary was the oldest of the girls, and she owned a boarding house in the bustling town. Mama was the second born, and after her came Eileen and Caroline. Mama didn't speak much about Eileen, but she admired Rosemary with the adoration that only a younger sister can give, and she adored Caroline with a great passion. She had often exclaimed that she wished Mattie could meet Caroline, for the two young women were not far apart in age, and now her wish was to come true. \"This here be Bordertown, Ma'am.\" Yarnell's voice sounded pleased, and Mattie looked before the wagon team. She had thought Fort Smith was a large town, but Bordertown seemed much larger. The great dirt path before her was teeming with horses and wagons, adults and children, and there were countless shops and homes stretching out as far as Mattie could see. She didn't take much stock in busy towns, preferring the country air and fields, and she kept quiet as Mama's team of bay horses pulled them through the town, Yarnell keeping the excited animals to a walk to prevent them from hitting anyone. \"It is good to be back,\" Mama sighed, weary from the exertion of grieving and from traveling. \"Frank, sit up straight now. Victoria, straighten your collar. Mattie...\" She trailed off at the stern expression on Mattie's face and then looked forward again. \"Are the aunts expecting us, Mama?\" Mattie questioned, unable to prevent herself from looking about curiously. \"I hope so,\" Mama said nervously, rubbing her hands together. \"I did not take the time to reply to their letter. I was eager to return here. How I have missed this place.\" The horses came to a stop in front of a large building, possibly one of the largest in a long row of storefronts, and Mama laughed joyously as Yarnell helped her off the cart and then tied the horses to a hitching post. The great building had a long, wide front porch with many rocking chairs, and most of the chairs were occupied by guests to the boarding house. Flowers lined the steps up to the porch, and above the immense front doors, in large, bright lettering, was written the word \"Rosemary's.\" People greeted Mattie and her family as they made their way into the boarding house, and Mattie nodded politely back at them before turning her attention to the interior of the boarding house. The entrance room was the largest room Mattie had ever been in. The ceiling rose five stories up, and the perimeter must have been larger than a barn. Towards the front of the room, there were large couches and comfortable chairs, and there were two big fireplaces, one on either side of the entrance doors. The back half of the room was crowded with tables and chairs for eating. The great space was decorated with beautiful flowers and lovely paintings on the walls, and the whole room was painted white with tiny blue flowers splashed across, making the enormity warm and welcoming. There was a large piano in one corner of the room, and a gentleman, dressed in a dark blue suit, was playing something light and airy. \"It is beautiful,\" Mattie spoke breathlessly. \"It is,\" Mama nodded. \"It has changed so much since Rosemary first bought it.\" A door opened at the far end of the room, and a large woman bustled out, arms laden with dishes. She had rich, dark hair, nearly black, that was pulled back into a loose bun, and she had a lovely countenance. Her cheeks were bright pink, and her dark brown eyes sparkled with mirth and joy. She didn't seem to mind her heavy burden, but immediately carried her plates to one of the many long dinner tables and began to lay them out in their appropriate places. She glanced, a loose brown curly falling into her eyes, and then let out a loud gasp. \"Agnes! My dear, beautiful sister! Is that you? And your lovely children?\" \"Rosemary!\" Mama exclaimed happily, hurrying to her sister and giving her a large hug. \"How good it is to see you!\" \"We weren't certain you were coming!\" Rosemary exclaimed. \"But I am so glad that you have! Hello!\" She waved to the children. \"You must be Mattie, and Frank, and Victoria! I am so glad to finally meet you! You must be exhausted from your trip. Caroline!\" she called towards the door she had come from. \"Caroline, our dear sister is here! Come out, won't you, and bring some lemonade and cookies with you!\" \"Rosemary, I can't even begin to thank you,\" Mama began, but Rosemary waved her hand. \"Hush now, sister. I wouldn't even think of you being alone when your farm is gone. We would have had you come when Frank died, but I remembered that you could not read. Eileen tried writing to you again when we heard your farm was gone, and here you are!\" The kitchen door opened again, and a young woman walked out, carrying a tray of white cookies and a pitcher of lemonade. Unlike her older sisters, she had light hair, nearly blonde, and wide blue eyes. She was thin, but her cheeks were also pink, and she smiled shyly at her nieces and nephew as they sat down at a table and she placed the food and drink before them. The next few minutes passed in silence for the young folk, but Mama and Rosemary spoke constantly, gossiping about the people they knew or remembered and reminiscing old times. Yarnell brought the family's few belongings up to the fifth floor, where the sisters had their living quarters, and then he said his farewells to the Ross family. Mattie's heart ached as she first shook the man's hand and then hugged him, grateful for his friendship, loyalty, and kindness after all this time. It upset her that she could not hug him properly, for she only had one arm to hug him with, but he appreciated her gesture and nodded politely to her, a large smile on his dark face, before he said his goodbyes to the other members of the family and then left, hoping to get to the train station and be on his way home to Yell County before it was dark outside. Rosemary soon ushered the family upstairs, showing them to their new living quarters. Mama and Victoria had a room to share, Little Frank had his own room, and Mattie was to share a room with Caroline. Already she found this troublesome, for she found Caroline to be a silly young lady who thought only of young men, dances, and dresses. Mattie certainly wasn't opposed to such vain things, but she preferred reading and math sums to boys and romance. To her chagrin, she found that she and Caroline were soon left to themselves, for Mama, Little Frank, and Victoria opted to take a nap before the evening meal. \"I am so glad that you are here,\" Caroline spoke excitedly. \"It can be ever so lonely in this boarding house. We have guests constantly, but I never have anyone to talk to. I am sorry if I talk so much.\" She blushed, and Mattie smiled slightly, shaking her head. \"I am sorry that I am not much company. I have only ever had Mama, Little Frank, and Victoria to talk with. I don't know much about how to talk of dresses and other things.\" \"I suppose I had best change the subject then,\" Caroline said quickly. \"I don't need you thinking I am some silly girl. What do you think of my room?\" Mattie looked about, pleased that Caroline did not have an extravagant room, for it told her that her aunt could be practical and truly didn't know how to speak of things other than what other young ladies spoke of. She had a large four-poster bed, made of a dark wood, a simple vanity, a few pieces of comfortable furniture, and two large glass windows that opened up onto a small balcony. There were paintings of trees and forests on the walls, and Caroline smiled happily, sitting down on the bed and bouncing once. \"Do you like them?\" she asked, gesturing to the paintings. \"They are lovely,\" Mattie nodded, sitting down on one of the room's chairs. \"I painted them.\" \"They are excellent.\" \"Would you care to see Eileen's room? She has a wonderful art gallery from paintings taken from all over the world,\" Caroline beamed. \"All over the world?\" Mattie frowned, her eyebrows narrowed. Surely the lady was over-exaggerating. \"Yes,\" Caroline nodded. \"Let me show you.\" She got off the bed and waited for Mattie to join her at the bedroom door before she led Mattie down a hallway towards the back of the building. She then opened the last door and gestured for Mattie to step inside. There could not have been a greater difference between bedrooms. This bedroom was nearly overflowing with silver and deep red. The bed was made of metal and was covered in silks and satins. There was an ornate full-length mirror and pieces of furniture the likes of which Mattie had never seen before. In nearly every place and corner of the room, there were bouquets of flowers, explaining where all the flowers in the entrance room had come from. This room spoke of luxury, of beauty, and Mattie could only imagine the kinds of clothing that were in a rich, mahogany wardrobe in a corner of the room. The paintings that surrounded her were famous and certainly came from every corner of the earth, and she could scarcely take her off of them. \"How did she come by this?\" Mattie gasped, unable to comprehend how someone could have so much money. \"Suitors,\" Caroline giggled. \"Suitors? Where does she find them?\" Mattie breathed, puzzled. \"Eileen is a saloon girl. Didn't Agnes tell you? I suppose she didn't. Rosemary doesn't like to talk about Eileen much either,\" Caroline said softly. \"I love my sister dearly, but I fear she is bound for a hellish end. She does tell me that I shouldn't follow in her footsteps, though. I suppose that is a comfort.\" Mattie could think of no reply, she was so shocked, but she needn't have said anything. There was a rustling sound against the large glass doors across the room from her, and she and Caroline turned to see a shadow emerging from the other side. \"She's done it again!\" Caroline exclaimed, running for the doors and flinging them open, Mattie at her side. There was a woman climbing over the railing of the small balcony there, and Mattie couldn't make out her features until she was standing safely on the balcony, smoothing down her skirts and then rubbing sweat from off her forehead. \"Well, that was a mighty climb, I must say!\" \"Eileen, Rosemary will be furious!\" Caroline exclaimed as her older sister brushed past the two younger women and swept into her room. \"What she doesn't know won't hurt her,\" Eileen chuckled, sitting on the edge of the bed. It was then that she noticed Mattie. \"Mattie!\" she exclaimed, leaping back up and moving to her niece. \"I would know who you are anywhere! You look just like your mother!\" She shook Mattie's hand and then sat down again. \"You'll forgive me, but that tree outside the doors is rather difficult to climb. Certainly in this heat!\" She looked as close to a China doll as anyone could. Her skin was pale and flawless, her lips were a scarlet red, her eyes were so dark that Mattie could not distinguish their color, and her hair was a deep brown with a great deal of red in it, pulled back into loose curls. She was beautiful, astonishingly so, and Mattie immediately felt intimidated, though she brushed her discomfort away and smiled politely. \"Hello, Aunt Eileen.\" \"Just Eileen, if you please,\" Eileen smiled, hurriedly pulling off some leather gloves and rushing to the mirror. \"Is Rosemary already setting the tables, Caroline?\" \"She is,\" Caroline nodded, watching as her sister straightened her hair. \"Has she asked for me yet?\" \"Not yet.\" \"Good,\" Eileen breathed easily. \"You'll forgive me for my odd entrance, Mattie, but I went for a ride and I knew Rosemary would be after me were I to arrive through the front doors.\" \"A ride? Isn't it hot out?\" Caroline questioned, exchanging curious looks with Mattie. \"No matter the heat,\" Eileen smiled, moving towards her bedroom door. \"Lone Star loves a good lope through the woods. To the dining room we go, ladies.\" Mattie followed the sisters downstairs, shaking her head as she slid her hand down the banisters. She didn't quite understand why Mama had chosen to come here after the fire, and she didn't know what sort of a relationship she was going to have with these aunts, but something told her that this was the beginning of a great adventure, and she didn't want to miss it.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two: Where There Will Be No Parting Hand The great room of the boarding house was alive with customers as Mattie followed Eileen and Caroline into the room. The only time she had ever seen a place so crowded had been at the hanging in Fort Smith. Men and women of all ages, and even children, were milling through the room, making their way to the long tables and chairs where they would be eating their evening meal. The room smelled of roasted meat and fresh bread, and Mattie heard her stomach grumble as she followed Caroline and Eileen into the kitchen behind the great room. Rosemary and Mama were already there, hurrying about with several other women to dish food into serving bowls and onto platters, and Mattie found dishes of food being handed to her. She carried these out into the dining hall and followed Eileen's instructions, putting the bowls and platters where they were needed. After the mad rush of food being distributed and drinks being poured, a prayer was spoken, and all began to eat. Mattie was able to take several bites of food before she realized that Eileen and Caroline were missing, but before she could ask about it, the kitchen door opened and the two young ladies returned to the great room, an enormous cake carried between them. \"Everyone!\" Eileen called, and Mattie was secretly amused to see everyone immediately turn to the rich voice. \"In honor of our dear sister's engagement, Caroline and I have baked a cake. Rosemary...\" The beautiful woman turned to her eldest sister, a warm smile on her face. \"We wish you and Charles all the best.\" She and Caroline carried the cake to where Rosemary sat and then placed the large dessert in front of Rosemary. The room erupted into loud applause and cheering, and Rosemary beamed with delight. Dessert plates were found, and within minutes, the entire room was enjoying the cake. \"Rosemary, you didn't tell me you were betrothed!\" Mama exclaimed from Mattie's side. \"I reckon I simply haven't had the time since you arrived, Agnes!\" Rosemary smiled. \"Charles proposed to me just days ago. Where is he, so I can introduce him...\" \"Right here, my dear Miss Rosemary,\" A deep voice answered, and Charles came to a stand behind Rosemary, smiling proudly down at her. He was a plain man, with light brown hair, blue eyes, and a boyish face, and looking at him and her aunt, Mattie could see that the two were an appropriate match. Charles carried extra weight in his belly, proving that he enjoyed Rosemary's cooking just as much as she enjoyed doing the cooking, and Rosemary could not stop blushing and smiling. \"This calls for some music!\" Someone shouted, and suddenly the tables and chairs were being moved to press against the walls of the room. A fiddle, a Jewish harp, and a guitar were found, and music flooded the room. Mattie rushed to escape from what was now the dance floor. Mama and Victoria were both swept into the dance. Caroline found herself being whisked away by a tall, skinny boy. Charles picked up Little Frank and whirled him around the room with Rosemary. Mattie found herself to be quite alone, leaning against the wall, but she didn't mind. \"No interest in frivolity, Mattie?\" Eileen's voice asked. Mattie turned her head to see her aunt standing a short distance away, her eyes looking over the dancers. \"It is all foolishness, really,\" Mattie said, standing up taller. \"You don't know how to dance, do you?\" \"I don't. And even if I did, I only have one arm,\" Mattie frowned. \"Come now. Let me teach you,\" Eileen offered, holding out her hand. \"It is great fun, and I feel as though you have forgotten what the word means. Come along, now. One of those boys has been looking at you, and if you don't come with me, you will have to refuse him.\" That didn't suit Mattie's fashion at all. She stepped towards her aunt and offered her one hand. Eileen took that hand in hers and then led Mattie onto the dance floor, amidst the swirling of skirts, the clapping of hands, and the kicking of feet. \"Let us see now,\" Eileen mused, studying Mattie's stump for a moment. \"Ah. Put your hand on my shoulder, Mattie, and I will put my hands on your waist. Like this now.\" She helped Mattie get into the proper position, and then the two waltzed amongst the other dancers. \"I haven't had such a wonderful dance partner in years!\" Eileen praised as they moved about the floor. \"You are most talented, Mattie Ross. Of course, the last wonderful dancer I was with didn't hold me quite like this!\" \"Oh?\" Mattie asked, blinking up at the lovely woman dancing with her. \"No,\" Eileen shook her head and then, unexpectedly, pulled Mattie in closer so that the younger girl's cheek was against Eileen's in an intimate fashion. Before Mattie could stop herself, she giggled. She gasped at her own silliness and pulled back to see her aunt grinning larger than a barnyard cat. \"That was more like how we danced!\" Eileen laughed. \"Always so serious, Mattie! Let me see if I can keep a lively conversation, else you'll remain as quiet as a tombstone. See that couple over there? They are the Carters. Mrs. Carter is expecting her tenth child, and she is hardly older than I am! Can you believe it? And that there is Matthew Hickock. He claims to be related to someone famous.\" \"And who is that?\" Mattie asked, gesturing towards the door. Eileen turned the two of them so she could see who Mattie was referring to. A stranger had entered the boarding house. He was a tall man with a handsome build. His eyes were dark brown, his hair was dark brown, and he was most attractive to look on. He wore a black hat and had a star on his shirt, indicating that he was the sheriff of Bordertown. \"Sheriff Kent Larson,\" Eileen frowned, stopping her dance. \"He has been after Rosemary for quite some time. I believe he is a liar and a thief, but there is no evidence to my suspicions. He is not welcome here. Excuse me, Mattie. The last thing I need him doing tonight is ruining Rosemary's joy.\" Mattie moved to sit in one of the chairs that was pressed against the wall, and she watched as her aunt approached the sheriff. Eileen stopped mere inches in front of Sheriff Larson, and her bright countenance darkened considerably as she spoke with the man. Mattie didn't hear any of the words that passed between the two, but she suspected that they were not friendly, and the hairs on the back of her neck rose when she saw the sheriff grab for Eileen's hands, placing them roughly in their correct positions so that he could dance onto the floor with her. Eileen had no desire to dance with the man, that much was obvious, but she desired to appear unaffected, and so she danced, the darkness still in her face. The sheriff's motions were rough and crude, suggesting things with his actions that no one but Mattie would have noticed. He may have been a good sheriff, but he didn't not know how to behave well with women, and his actions alarmed Mattie. She wanted to find someone to help, but who here could she find? She didn't know anyone except women! Her eyes landed on Charles, and Mattie got out of her seat and pushed her way through the dancers to where the man was holding Rosemary, protectively and lovingly, pleased just to dance with the pretty lady. Mattie hated that she had to interrupt the moment, but Eileen needed help. \"Excuse me, Mr. Charles,\" Mattie spoke, and he stopped dancing, letting go of Rosemary to look at Mattie. \"Hello. Who might you be?\" he asked pleasantly, smiling. \"Charles, this is my niece, Miss Mattie Ross,\" Rosemary introduced, and Charles held out his hand to shake Mattie's. She shook his hand and then spoke. \"Mr. Charles, Sheriff Kent Larson is here, and he is forcing Eileen to dance with him.\" The smile on Charles' face abruptly vanished, and he stood taller, looking over the heads of the other dancers. He was a very tall man, and Mattie was well aware of it as he towered above her. \"Oh Charles, not again,\" Rosemary sighed, putting a hand on his arm. \"Eileen can care for herself. Please, let's not make a scene again.\" \"He is trash,\" Charles spoke, and Mattie nodded vigorously. Something told her that she and this man were going to be good friends. \"Leave Eileen to it,\" Rosemary pleaded. \"She has dealt with him before.\" \"And it appears she is about to do it again,\" Charles spoke, the smile returning slowly to his face. Mattie turned to see the sheriff and Eileen dance by, and she glanced down just in time to see Eileen \"deal with\" Sheriff Larson. Coyly, and almost elegantly, Eileen brought one heeled boot down on the inside of Sheriff Larson's left foot. He wore heavy boots himself, but the insides were softer than the tops, and she had aimed perfectly, making certain to pinch his flesh in a way that was uncomfortable, to say the least. Mattie didn't hear the man's response, but she could be certain that he cursed, and he made to pull away from Eileen, but the woman kept her heel dug into his foot. She reached up a hand and put it behind his neck, and Mattie could just see how her fingers were harsh against the man's skin. She moved her fingers quickly, leaving a good burn in the sensitive skin, and the sheriff sucked in a deep breath of pain before Eileen released him and then stepped back. More heated words passed between the two, and then the sheriff turned and left, limping and with a fiery red mark on the back of his neck. Eileen stepped back and rubbed her hands together, as though attempting to clean them with an imaginary bar of soap. She then straightened her skirts, smoothed back her hair, and left the building. \"Oh dear. Off she goes again,\" Rosemary sighed. \"Thank you for your concern, Mattie, but I do believe she will be alright.\" \"If the sheriff is that unkind, why is he the sheriff?\" Mattie frowned. \"He has done much for Bordertown, and he doesn't treat everyone in such a foul manner,\" Charles frowned, giving Rosemary's hand a squeeze. \"He does seem to delight in tormenting Miss Eileen and her sisters.\" \"He wouldn't bother her if she didn't ask for it,\" Rosemary laughed lightly. \"She refuses to let him get near me. That is why he causes her grief.\" \"You have wonderful sisters. I am grateful they invited me into the family,\" Charles spoke, gazing at his bride-to-be admiringly. \"Thank you for your help, Mattie,\" Rosemary said gently. \"I think the rest of the evening should go well.\" Mattie nodded and then left the couple to themselves, making her way to the kitchen so that she could begin cleaning dishes. She was not one for merriment and socializing, preferring to clean and be active when there was company. There were large stacks of dishes sitting just outside, and she walked onto the back courtyard of the boarding house. There was a pump not far from the back door, and she moved dishes over to it. She pumped water into a large barrel and then began to scrub the dishes as well as she could, picking one up and then resting it atop the rim of the barrel. She held the dish down with her stump and then scrubbed with her remaining hand. She appreciated the work. It gave her a quiet place to think and be productive at the same time. She looked about her as she cleaned, and she could see a small pasture only a short distance away. There wasn't room in it for more than once horse, and it was connected to a dainty barn, clean and welcoming. Whatever horse was housed in the barn surely must have been ridden every day to have such a small pasture! The occupant within the barn must have heard Mattie's thoughts, for as she scrubbed, she heard a rustle of hay, and she watched as a truly magnificent creature exited the barn and walked towards her, ears perked forward expectantly. Mattie's still wasn't one for horses. It still hurt that Little Blackie had died, for he had been a good friend on a great adventure as well as a brave and noble mount, but Mattie still thought little of the helpful creatures. This noble steed that approached her, though, was something. All of the Bible verses about horses came to Mattie's mind as she continued to scrub, though her scrubbing had slowed as she gazed at the creature. She remembered the verses in Job, about how the brave horse was ready for battle and laughed at the call of war. How he was unafraid and majestic. This horse must have come straight out of the pages of Holy Scripture. He was a stallion, bigger than Little Blackie had been. He had a dapple gray coat and a thick black mane and tail. His forelock fell into large, brown eyes, and his ears were dainty and tipped with black, swiveling in every direction as he studied Mattie with the same intensity with which she studied him. He was beautiful and he knew it, and Mattie couldn't help but wish she had an apple for him. \"Isn't he lovely?\" Caroline asked, moving to stand next to Mattie, a large towel in her hands. \"Whose is he?\" Mattie nodded. \"That's Lone Star. He belongs to Eileen. He is so beautiful that she refuses to keep him out to pasture with the geldings or in a barn with the other boarding house horses,\" Caroline smiled. \"He was the best gift one of her admirers ever gave her. That horse is worth so much money.\" \"Is he a Quarter horse?\" \"Oh no!\" Caroline laughed. \"No. He is an Andalusian. They are a breed from Spain.\" \"From Spain,\" Mattie breathed, even the word of the country sounding wonderful on her tongue. \"Lone Star is straight from Mexico,\" Caroline nodded. \"Here. Let me clean the dishes and you can dry. It will be easier for you. I don't care for all the noise and activity in the house either,\" she smiled understandingly. \"It is too much for me. I don't mean to talk much, silence is good too, but how did you lose your arm?\" \"It was a snake bite,\" Mattie said quietly. \"It is strange, but I can still feel my arm sometimes. It seems as though it is still there.\" Caroline nodded, scrubbing a particularly grimy dish. \"I lost a foot,\" she spoke. \"A wagon wheel rolled over it when I was little. There was nothing I could do for it.\" \"I never would have known that. You walk so well.\" \"I have had time to practice! And a foot is easier to hide than an arm!\" Caroline laughed. \"That is one reason why I am not much good at dancing.\" The two girls continued to clean in silence, both deep in thought. Mattie glanced over at Caroline every now and then, a feeling of warmth flooding through her. Perhaps she and her aunt were going to get along well after all! She had been too quick to judge. It would be new and strange to have a good friend! She never had had one before, and she was looking forward to developing her relationship with Caroline. Perhaps now it would be alright to stop hoping for adventure and to settle down a bit.[Chapter 3] I am writing this story with the thought that if it became a movie it would be PG13, so please forgive me if you think anything should be rated higher. :) Enjoy! Chapter Three: No Sad Farewells Screams split through the stillness of night like a knife. Mattie sat bolt upright in her bed, and she turned her head to see that Caroline was sitting up straight as well, breathing hard as her body immediately went into panic mode. The young women exchanged glances, and then both were up and running to the window of their room. Their window looked out onto the busy street of Bordertown, and while the street should have been dark, it was ablaze with the flames that were billowing from the city bank. Dark silhouettes of horses and men could be seen mingling amongst the flames, and terror gripped Mattie's heart. Not another fire. The fire didn't stop at the bank, and it took her a moment to realize that the dark silhouettes were not attempting to put out the blaze but were instead spreading it, lighting other buildings as they rode their horses through the street. \"It's an attack on the city!\" Caroline gasped from Mattie's side. \"They are attempting to bring all of Bordertown down in the blaze!\" \"Who would do such a thing?\" Mattie cried, and her voice was interrupted by another scream, this one much closer and much louder. \"Rosemary!\" Caroline panicked, grabbing Mattie's arm and pulling her towards the bedroom door. Neither girl took any time to think as they ran down the dark hall to Rosemary's room. The woman's bedroom door was already open, and Mattie and Caroline sprang inside to run head first into Mama. Someone slammed the door shut behind them, and they suddenly realized that they were trapped in the bedroom with Mama and Victoria. Three men were in the room with them. One had closed the door behind them, another was standing at the window, and the third was on top of Rosemary in the bed. \"Make another sound and we'll shoot your heads in!\" Rosemary's attacker hissed, and the four females standing near the door caught a very good look at Sheriff Larson. He was hardly interested in them, instead keeping his hands busy on Rosemary as he did to her as he pleased, hitting her as he violated her. Mama moved her hands, shielding Victoria's eyes and trying to keep Mattie and Caroline from seeing, but she needn't have bothered. Neither of the older girls were looking, keeping their heads turned away from the ugly scene. Caroline was crying softly, but Mattie's heart was too hard for tears. She had been living with Rosemary and her sisters for a week now. She had come to love Rosemary like her own sister, and being helpless in a situation like this made her angry, angrier than she could ever remember being. She had been angry when her home had gone up into flames, but it was nothing like the anger that seared through her now. If it didn't mean danger for anyone else, she would have run at that wicked sheriff and she would have killed him with her own fingers! \"For goodness' sake, stop!\" Mama pleaded, her voice choked by tears. \"You've done enough!\" \"Shut up, woman!\" The sheriff shouted, giving Rosemary a good shake and then getting up from the bed. \"Hines, get down to the street and rally the others. George, see to it that these women never speak of what they have seen.\" \"Kill them, Kent?\" George blinked from behind the women. \"Yes. We can't have any snitches, can we?\" Caroline's whimpers got louder, and Rosemary started screaming again, struggling to cover herself with her blankets. Mama's hand found Mattie's and gave it a strong squeeze as George moved to stand in front of them, shotgun ready. Sheriff Larson and Hines were both making to climb through the window, shouting orders to the men who waited for them below. Mattie heard the loading of the shot gun, and she turned her gaze, staring directly into George's eyes. She had thought he sounded uncertain when questioning Sheriff Larson, but now that she was looking at him, she could see solid determination there. They were going to die, all of the women in the room, and there was nothing she could do about it. And then the door crashed down behind them. Five shots were fired. George and Hines both fell, dead, but Sheriff Larson finished his climb out the window and disappeared from sight. Mattie found herself on her hand and knees on the floor, Mama holding her, Caroline, and Victoria as well as she could in her protective embrace. Rosemary was cowering in the corner of her bed, crying her heart out, and no one seemed inclined to move. Mattie struggled to her feet and turned to see Eileen standing in the doorway, a rifle in her hands. She was dressed in her saloon clothes, a well-fitted corset top made of green velvet with a matching long-trained skirt. She had feathers in her hair and color on her face, and she was more beautiful than ever, but there was a look in her eyes, such a cold look that Mattie shivered. This woman wasn't at all upset that she had just killed two people. With the grace of a queen, she stepped over George's limp form and moved to Rosemary. A few whispered words were spoken, and then Eileen added more bullets to her weapon. \"Eileen, what are you going to do?\" Mama demanded, terrified as she watched how calmly her sister loaded her rifle. \"I'm going after him,\" Eileen spoke coolly. \"You can't! He'll kill you! Don't be foolish, Eileen!\" \"That son of a... (Mama covered Mattie's ears) just raped my sister and torched the entire town, bringing the entire posse into hell with him!\" Eileen shouted, roaring in her anger. \"I'll be hanged if I don't go after him! No one else is going to. You take care of Rosemary, Agnes. I'll be back, and I'll be dragging Larson back with me!\" \"Eileen!\" Rosemary screamed in despair, but her sister paid no heed. Within seconds, Eileen was out the window and gone into the night. \"Someone's got to go after her! Charles! Where is Charles?\" Mama panicked. And somehow, miraculously, he was there. He ran first to Rosemary, wrapping his arms around her tightly. \"You must go bring Eileen back!\" Mama cried. \"Someone has to stop her!\" \"Don't leave me! Oh Charles, don't leave me!\" Rosemary sobbed, clinging to her beau with a death grip. \"Please!\" \"I'll go!\" Everyone turned to look at Mattie. \"I'll go,\" she repeated. \"We don't have much time. I'll need a horse. Caroline, please help me get dressed. Quickly. Victoria, go into the kitchen and get as much food as you can. I will have to be fast if I can catch up to Eileen. I am certain the sheriff must already be leaving town. I can't do it by myself. Hurry!\" To her surprise, Mama didn't protest. Instead, the older woman, still shaken by what she had seen and experienced, left the room with a flurry of her nightgown, immediately running down the stairs towards the kitchen. Mattie was rushed into her bedroom where Caroline helped her dress in trousers and an over-sized plaid shirt. Before Mattie knew it, she was outside and was being lifted up onto a large brown horse. Mama was there, tying several bags to the back of Mattie's saddle. Mattie was surprised to see Caroline swinging up onto a horse next to her, determination on her pale face. \"Take these,\" Mama said, giving each girl a pistol. \"I am strongly against women using weapons, but I see there is no choice. Mattie, you have been on an adventure such as this. I know it will do no good to argue with you. Take care of yourself and take care of Caroline. Send word to me as soon as you can. I love you.\" She stood up on her tiptoes and kissed Mattie's cheek. \"Eileen rode out of town, towards the south. She's following Kent and his gang further south. You will have to ride hard and fast to keep up with her. Go!\" Mama stepped back and slapped both horses' on their rumps. The town was a red blaze of fire as the horses galloped out of Bordertown, following the dust that rose far before them. Mattie's mind was reeling as she held tightly to her horse's mane and the reins with her only hand, struggling to stay astride as her mount galloped alongside Caroline's. There was a hot breeze tonight, and it whipped at her face, stinging and burning her eyes. She did her best not to pay attention to the sensation as the horses galloped through a creek and then clambered up a hill, hooves scraping against gravel. \"Do you think we will catch up to her?\" Caroline shouted over the hoof beats. \"She will have to slow and think at some point,\" Mattie nodded. \"She won't push her horse at a full gallop for long. Lone Star is running by himself. He won't have the encouragement of other horses to push him on.\" \"You're right. She loves him too much to force him to run hard for a long distance,\" Caroline agreed. \"How long should we push our horses?\" \"Until we hear them panting hard,\" Mattie spoke and then both girls were silent. She remembered another dark night like this, when the only light was the stars shining above. She remembered hearing the desperate panting of her horse as Little Blackie struggled to stay on his feet. She remembered his scream as Rooster stabbed him and then rubbed salt in the horse's wound, pushing Mattie's horse to death even as he fought to save her life. It wasn't a fond memory, and Mattie tried to push it away as minutes, and then an hour, passed by. Time seemed to slow as the horses moved from a gallop, to a canter, to a lazy trot. When next to she looked about her, Mattie didn't know where she was. They were in a large open field, and she couldn't see any signs of anyone ahead. Both horses stopped abruptly, nostrils flaring and ears swiveling in all directions, and Mattie and Caroline looked about, trying to determine the sudden alarm. They could see nothing. They were in a great open area, able to see far out in all directions over the tall grass, but there was nothing there to startle them. \"Perhaps they have smelled a snake,\" Caroline whispered nervously, and Mattie felt cold sweat trickle onto her forehead. Snakes. She had no desire to see any of those creatures again. And then, abruptly, a hand was around her ankle. She didn't have a chance to make a sound as she was pulled off her horse and into the tall grass, but Caroline screamed for her even as both horses spooked sideways. A hand went to Mattie's mouth, to stop her from screaming, and a voice spoke, rapid but not unkind. \"What are you two doing here?\" \"Eileen!\" Caroline nearly sobbed, so glad that it had been her sister hiding in the grass. Mattie sat up and looked next to her. Eileen was sitting in the grass, her long skirt billowed about her, and Lone Star was directly behind her, laying flat on the ground, one ear turned towards the girls. \"You shouldn't have followed me!\" Eileen declared, standing up and smoothing down her skirts. She moved Mattie forward, and Lone Star clambered to his feet, shaking his body, starting with the tip of his nose all the way back to his tail. \"I didn't run out stupidly. I knew what I was doing. Why are you here?\" \"You can't go after Larson alone,\" Mattie said firmly. \"You didn't bring any supplies with you. You won't last without food and you won't get far by yourself.\" \"Really?\" Eileen smiled, an eyebrow arched. \"And I will get much further with two young ladies holding me back?\" \"I know a little about hunting bandits,\" Mattie said. \"I can help. And Caroline will give us the safety of numbers.\" \"Your mother allowed this?\" Eileen asked, folding her arms across her chest. \"Yes, because Mama knows you aren't going to come back without Larson, and she knows you need help.\" \"Why were you in the grass?\" Caroline asked, reaching forward to scratch Lone Star between the ears. \"I wanted to know where Larson and his miscreants are going,\" Eileen said simply. She turned to Lone Star and then curtsied prettily. The stallion bobbed his head once and then lowered himself, kneeling in the grass so that his owner could climb atop his bare back. Eileen had done nothing to prepare herself for the chase. Her stallion was wearing only a bridle, and she was still dressed in her saloon clothes, her hair falling out of its curls and into long waves against her back. \"How would you know? You were behind him,\" Caroline spoke. \"We managed to get ahead of them. You know how Lone Star and I like to run. He has more training than the other horses,\" Eileen explained, gathering up her reins. \"We got ahead of Larson and then hid in the grass. I was able to hear where he and the others are riding to. This is going to be a terribly long journey. I would prefer it if you ladies returned home, though I will not argue with you if you wish to stay. I know how stubborn young ladies can be.\" \"Where is he going?\" Mattie asked. \"Where all the other villains go,\" Eileen grinned. \"To Mexico.\"[Chapter 4] Chapter Four: My Darkest Night will Turn to Day Mexico. Mattie had never been, but she had heard horror stories of desperadoes and hoodlums. It was the country of everything her mother would have been traumatized to hear about, and now Mattie's own aunt, her mother's own sister, was suggesting that three single women, none-too-terrible-looking, should all chase a band of ruffians into the hostile land. \"I'm not suggesting we go there,\" Eileen grinned, unfazed by Mattie's and Caroline's shared looks of dismay. \"Do you need help getting back up onto your horse, Mattie?\" \"I think I can manage,\" Mattie shook her head, struggling only briefly to get on her pony's back. \"So we're going to chase them to the Mexican border?\" \"We're going to chase them to Dallas, where they plan to regroup with some friends and prepare themselves for the journey. Once in Dallas, we're going to go to Lem's, and then we're going to find a ranger or someone who can help us with Larson. We will probably need someone who can track the gang, and then we'll decide what to do from there.\" \"Lem's?\" Caroline demanded. \"Who is Lem?\" Mattie asked as the horses trotted side by side across the field. \"An old friend of mine,\" Eileen smiled. \"He owns a saloon,\" Caroline grimaced. \"Eileen, I don't know that...\" \"Now ladies,\" Eileen said firmly, turning Lone Star so that the other horses had to stop, \"I intend to go after Larson with or without you. Dallas is an immense city, and we won't be able to find Larson in a day. Lem may own a saloon, but he is a good friend, and he can give me work. I would be willing to bet that Larson and his gang are going to take a train to the Mexican border, and we are going to need to get more money if we're to go along with them. We will be safe with Lem, regardless of how much you might be opposed to a saloon. We will be safe there.\" \"If you're going to be singing at a saloon, you will need to keep your dress safe,\" Mattie commented. \"We are about to enter a wood. Why don't you change once we get there? I am sure Mama packed clothes for you, Eileen.\" \"Thank you, Mattie. I hadn't even thought of that.\" \"How were you going to travel to Dallas?\" Caroline asked as the horses entered the woods. \"Just ride until you can't go anymore?\" \"No,\" Eileen shook her head. \"That will be Larson's idea, and he won't do well by it. It takes about a week to get to Dallas, if the weather is good. He can't run his horses for that long before they'll need a long rest. He and his men never did take good care of their mounts. Lone Star could go for a long time without a stop, but I don't know about your boys. We'll travel by night and rest in the daylight. The nights will be cooler, so we can travel further.\" \"There isn't much hoping of beating the men to Dallas, is there?\" Mattie asked. \"It's possible, but I sincerely hope we don't,\" Eileen shook her head. \"He'll have gathered more men on the ride, and we don't have the gun power or the manpower to do anything about them until we get help in Dallas. Let's stop here.\" She swung off Lone Star and then held Mattie and Caroline's horses as they dismounted. \"Let's see what your mama packed, Mattie.\" Eileen took the saddle bags off the horses and began to rummage through them. \"Some pistols, a couple of rifles attached to the saddles, food, a brush, and bless my stars, my makeup and a clean corset. And these...\" Her voice got soft, and she pulled out a pair of deerskin breeches, a bolero hat, and a heavy buckskin jacket with fringe dangling from the sleeves. \"And my boots.\" They were knee-high boots made of the softest tan leather to match the buckskin jacket. \"Those must mean a lot to you,\" Mattie commented as Eileen looked through several more bundles of clothes and supplies and then began to unlace the front of her saloon dress. \"Oh yes,\" Eileen nodded. \"The bolero was from a friend in Mexico. The breeches are from an Apache who enjoyed my singing and appreciated my kindness. The boots are from Pa, and the coat,\" she paused, \"the coat is from a very, very dear friend.\" She loosened her corset and removed her shoes and bloomers before pulling on a loose white shirt, her breeches, and her boots. \"It's going to get colder tonight, ladies. There are gloves and other warm articles of clothing in the saddle bags if you need them.\" Mattie watched as Eileen pulled on her coat and then her bolero. There was something familiar about the coat, and Mattie was reminded of Mr. Laboeuf. His eyes suddenly twinkled at her from the stars and she shook her head, trying to shake away thoughts and a blush. The man had been such an arrogant scoundrel. She didn't understand why now, after all this time, she felt strange stirrings for him. \"Shall we ride?\" Eileen asked, putting the saddle bags back in their places and then swinging up onto Lone Star's back. Even in men's clothes, she was glamorous, her long hair pulled back with a leather strip, cascading in rich curls down her back. Mattie nodded and then clucked her tongue at her mount, encouraging him to move on. The sun was high in the sky when the women finally prepared to stop their horses. They had ridden steadily through the night, at a decent pace, moving as quickly as was safely possible through the trees before they exited the woods and found themselves on a well-worn dusty stage coach trail that traveled south. \"There's a patch of trees just down the way,\" Eileen yawned, pointing ahead. \"We'll stop there and hide under cover of the trees. They will give us shade and protection.\" \"Are we going to be able to sleep through the daylight?\" Caroline asked, patting her horse's neck as they entered the trees. \"I think so. It's going to be a rough night of riding, so you'll have to try your best,\" Eileen sighed. \"Oh?\" Mattie asked, bringing her horse to a stop and then swinging off. \"It's rather humid. We're in for a thunderstorm.\" All three women were saddle sore as they took the saddles, blankets, and bridles off their horses. Mattie had trouble keeping her eyes open as she made sure her horse's halter was securely fastened and then led him to a small stream that flowed through the trees. She ground tied her horse near the water and then waddled to where Caroline was resting with her back against a tree. Eileen took care of both hers and Caroline's horses and then plopped down next to the girls. \"Dry meat, an apple each, and two flasks of water,\" she announced, tossing a small parcel to Mattie. \"Comfortable, ladies?\" \"Tired,\" Caroline yawned. \"Agreed,\" Eileen stretched and then popped a piece of dry meat into her mouth. \"Meal of kings, this.\" \"What is Dallas like?\" Caroline asked, speaking between pieces of apple. \"Very busy. You have to be careful when you try to cross the roads. It isn't proper or safe for a lady to go out alone at night, although I guess that isn't proper anywhere. There are shows every night. Operas travel through there, and all sorts of merchandise. It's very active and somewhat tiring, but fun,\" Eileen said, leaning back and closing her eyes. \"What were you doing in Dallas?\" Mattie asked, suddenly more awake than she wanted to be. \"Eileen went there with her beau,\" Caroline said, her cheeks turning pink. \"I was told Dallas was the best place in the world for singers,\" Eileen smiled slightly, tilting her hat so that it covered her eyes. \"I had a young man that was willing to bring me there.\" \"We shouldn't talk about such things,\" Caroline said firmly. \"You're just like Mattie's mother,\" Eileen chuckled. \"It wouldn't have been very appropriate for me to go alone, would it?\" \"You know what I mean,\" Caroline stammered. \"I had a beau,\" Eileen said, lifting the brim of her hat and looking sideways to Mattie. \"He gave me this jacket, actually. He was a decent, moral, and tempting gentleman. He wooed me away to Dallas. I met Lem there, and I ended my relationship with my beau.\" \"Why?\" Mattie couldn't help herself. \"Because he had a bigger love for Texas than he did for me,\" Eileen shrugged, closing her eyes again, a smile tugging at her lips. \"I can't compete with that. Now if you don't mind, ladies, I need to sleep.\" \"Now that you've thoroughly woken us up,\" Caroline huffed. \"I can't help your high standards, Caroline.\" \"It was disgraceful, and you know it. Rosemary said it sent Pa to his grave.\" \"My leaving with my man didn't send Pa to his grave. It was my not marrying him. Pa wanted nothing more than to marry us all off. You're lucky you weren't old enough,\" Eileen said calmly. \"Pa was a wonderful man and loving, but he was pushy when it came to men and marriage. He always regretted not having a son. He loved your father, Mattie. He was the son Pa never had. He loved Glen, too, but he wouldn't have minded if I married the man without much love involved. I couldn't compete with Texas, as I said. She's too big a competitor and too tempting a mistress. We need to sleep.\" \"I'm sorry, Eileen,\" Caroline's voice softened. \"I didn't mean to upset you. It isn't any of our business anyway. Can you sing to us, to help us sleep?\" \"You know me well,\" Eileen answered. \"Very well. Get comfortable, girls.\" Mattie lay down, using her saddle blanket as a pillow, and closed her eyes. The faintest of breezes rustled through the trees, licking at her face, and she breathed deeply, hoping that Eileen's voice was the type that could lull her into sleep. \"I gave my love a cherry that has no stone. I gave my love a chicken that has no bone. I gave my love a ring that has no end. I gave my love a baby with no crying.\" It was the most soothing voice Mattie had ever heard. She could feel a lump building in her throat, and she gathered the saddle blanket in her arms, letting the sweet voice wash over her. \"How can there be a cherry that has no stone? How can there be a chicken that has no bone? How can there be a ring that has no end? How can there be a baby with no crying?\" A cherry when it's blooming, it has no stone. A chicken when it's pipping, it has no bone. A ring when it's rolling, it has no end. A baby when he's sleeping, has no crying.\"[Chapter 5] Chapter Five: A Rose is Blooming The rain began that night and did not stop for the next seven days. Mattie couldn't remember ever having been more miserable on a long trip. Water pelted off her horse's hide even as rain dripped down the back of her coat and dress, soaked her through, and made her clothes cling to her. She couldn't see clearly, constantly having to squint against the downpour. There was no where dry to sleep, and if it hadn't been for the warm weather, she knew she and the other women would most surely have come down with pneumonia. \"Only a day more, and we'll be in Dallas!\" Eileen shouted over the roar of thunder. \"We would have been there sooner, but the rain has slowed us down!\" \"Will Lem have a warm place for us to stay?\" Caroline called, shuddering when a streak of lightning touched a tree a mile away. \"Yes! Hang in there, Caroline! Not much longer! We might even be there by nightfall! Let's get the horses to move a bit faster, ladies!\" The horses wanted to be out of the horrible weather just as much as their riders did. They eagerly broke into a swift gallop, heads lowered as they pressed against the rain. Water and mud splashed up against their legs, and they snorted, sneezing water out of their nostrils. Mattie tried not to look up at the sky, did her best to ignore the bolts of electricity crackling through the clouds and lighting up the muddied path. Her horse's mane was a knotted mess, and she patted her horse's neck, doing her best to encourage her mount on. His ears flicked back and then forward again before they pinned flat back as the horse jumped sideways, spooking when a gun shot crackled over the sound of the thunder. \"Down!\" Eileen shouted, and Mattie watched, horrified, as Lone Star immediately stopped cantering and fell over onto his side. Mattie was terrified that the stallion had been shot, but then she saw Eileen sitting up from behind the horse, a shotgun hoisted against her shoulder. \"Down!\" Eileen shouted again. \"Pull your horse's right rein as far back against their withers as you can. Jerk their heads around! It will throw them off balance! Fling your body to the right, throwing all your weight! Watch your right legs! Pull your right leg back so you aren't crushed. Now! We're being shot at!\" Mattie sucked in a deep breath and then did as her aunt ordered. She pulled as sharply as she could on her horse's mouth, forcing his head to snap to the right. At the same time, she flung herself to the right, shoving all her weight there, throwing her pony off balance. The animal grunted and then fell, Mattie moving her leg just in time to avoid being crushed as she went down. Mattie held the right rein tightly, breathing a quick sigh of relief when she saw that her horse had no intention to get back up. Caroline and her pony were down immediately next to Mattie, and the girls reached for each other even as Eileen fired several shots into the rain. \"Hold fire!\" Someone shouted from the torrential downpour, and Mattie squinted, trying to get a better view of the seven horses now moving towards them, riders dressed in dusters and wide-brimmed hats. \"Well, well, well,\" a familiar voice chuckled, and Mattie heard Eileen snort as the lead horse stepped forward. \"If it ain't Miss Eileen herself.\" \"You don't sound at all surprised, Larson,\" Eileen said, huddling low behind Lone Star, her hands working for a moment before she turned back to address Sheriff Larson. \"Only a mite bit. I had thought men would be after me, but I suppose the best they could do was you.\" \"Proud of yourself for robbing and burning the whole town, are you?\" \"Now don't take it personal, Eileen. Just business.\" \"Oh, Bordertown wasn't personal,\" Eileen said, leaning over Lone Star's side again, this time with a pistol in hand. \"But my sister was.\" She fired, a perfect, clean shot to Larson's horse. The bullet pierced the animal's chest, and the beast fell, immediately dead. Larson scrambled off the horse, grabbing his gun and pulling it towards Eileen. He didn't have a chance to shoot before Eileen fired again, lodging a bullet in the sheriff's right leg. He hissed in pain and sprang back, allowing one of his men to grab him by the arms and hoist him up onto his mount. Mattie heard the sheriff shouting orders to his men, and then the air erupted in gunfire. Mattie did her best to slide herself beneath her horse's body, praying that she would stay safe, hoping that the mud, now oozing up an all sides, would somehow shield them from the barrage of bullets. \"Mattie! Caroline!\" Eileen was shouting again. \"Girls! Get your horses up! Go! Go!\" \"How?\" Caroline cried. \"Eileen, my horse is dead!\" \"Ladies, now, you just stay right there!\" A new voice shouted over the din. \"You stay right there! I've got ya!\" Shotgun blasts intermingled with the rest of the gunfire and horse screams, completely drowning out the angry thunder overhead. \"Eileen! What should we do?\" Caroline cried again. \"Stay there! We have help!\" A chestnut blur rushed in front of Mattie, a giant red horse with four white stockings. She watched between the horse's legs, stunned, as Sheriff Larson and his men turned tail and ran. She became aware of several things all at once, then. Her horse was still breathing, hard, straining to get to its feet. The rain had slowed to a drizzle. The dark night sky was beginning to appear from behind disappearing rain clouds. Caroline was crying, scrambling to get up from beneath her dead horse. Eileen hadn't moved, still in a shooting position, using Lone Star's side to brace herself. And Rooster Cogburn himself was seated on the horse in front of her. ","Summary":" Chapter One: I'm On My Way to that Fair Land She could still smell smoke. True, it had been five da"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"Truly Beloved","Author":"wellwithmysoul","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/7129553","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Prologue People do not give it credence that a fourteen-year-old girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood... The same folk, upon learning such a story is truth and upon making a short study of such girl, do not give credence to the thought that she possessed a woman's heart beating within her breast. I am here to tell you, Reader, that such proposition is gospel truth. On my first account of my, albeit unlikely, great adventures with the Marshal Cogburn and the Ranger LeBoeuf I quickly surmised I had no contact with either man since. I am sorry to admit this was a bald faced lie, a sin which has grieved me since and in more ways than one. Yes, Mattie Ross is a sinner like all others and more so than many as you will see, should you be bold enough to learn the truth of my life. I am an old woman now, soon to be crossing over that Great Divide. It has come to my attention that when you grow old, your pride loosens its grip somewhat and your previous life is revealed to you in new light. What I was ashamed to admit before no longer do I view in disgrace – only joy, love and great sorrow are brought to mind. My life after returning home to Yell County was as passionate and tumultuous as those saccharine heroines in the dime novels I hid under my mattress as a girl. Verily I say to you - you did not truly believe Mattie Ross was ordained to live out her days in amity and content? I lived as passionately as Solomon in my own right, as you will see.[Chapter 2] I could really use a beta… anyone? After this chapter we really get to the meat and potatoes of the story. :) Chapter One: This Heart of Mine There was a young man by the unfortunate name of Clarence Thaddeus Throgmorton III who lived with his family on a farm up the road from ours of good size, near 600 acres with a nice homestead and six-stall horse barn. Now do not misjudge, Clarence Thaddeus Throgmorton III is a proper, stalwart sort of name if one has the countenance and fortitude to live up to it, but this particular Clarence did not. Now, mind you, he was a very amiable young man with good sense that only lacked finishing. I only mean that he was a terribly small sort of person, barely taller than I, and wispy as a spring willow branch. He was not ugly by most standards, but very dark and heavy browed. I preferred a fairer sort of man, tall and broad shouldered. But that is neither here nor there. The Throgmorton family and my own long had it in mind that Clarence and I should marry, thus joining our estates that were separated only by the creek where Papa and I caught many a good trout while he lived, God rest him. Though I had always been aware of this scheme if perhaps only in the back of my mind, it was brought to light the year I turned eighteen. Clarence was a full year and two months my elder. He and his Papa, a small man like himself but very friendly, came to visit us on that day of my birth and arrange the particulars of what would be our lives together. They met with Mama and I in the parlor. I served lemonade with my one arm, the sleeve of the other neatly pinned just above what was my elbow. Now I may digress a moment to tell you that in that year or so since my return, I had to learn hard and fast to deal with my new shortcomings. I will only glaze over it, as it was a hard time and not one I prefer to recall. You only need to know that I learned to do most things almost as well as before, with note that I did become a much better rider, learning to lead and respond to the horses with my body and not just the reigns. I never did master things with laces or the ability to fix my hair proper. When Victoria was not able to do it, I satisfied myself with securing it over one shoulder with a length of ribbon, one side held in my teeth as I tied. Clarence studied me openly and, if I may say, appreciatively as our parents conversed. I will own at the risk of vanity that while I was remarked on more than one occasion at fourteen as being unattractive I had matured considerably. While I was still no great beauty - that lot fell to Victoria who was eighteen months my younger - I was a fine looking young woman with fair eyes and an excellent figure. My hair was my one vanity, for it was thick and dark and soft as rabbits fur. Even Victoria owned to be jealous of it. Paired with my superior intellect and business sense, I was a catch even minus the arm. Clarence knew this and appreciated it. Arrangements were made and we shook hands, then he presented me with a simple gold band that I would have to wear on my right hand. He told me he paid a good 20 percent on the dollar less than it's actual value. I told him was to his credit, though secretly I thought he could have gotten it down at least 5 percent more. He called me \"Matilda\" which no one ever did. We were to be married the following fall, after the last harvest was squared away. One might think I would be bothered to be bartered and traded like the very cotton we sold, but such was the way of the world at the time. I did not love Clarence and he did not love me, and that was fine. At least I thought it was fine. In truth I had not given it much thought at all until one lovely autumn evening, not a week before the ceremony joining our families was to take place, Victoria crept into my room long after the last candle had blown out. \"Mattie, are you asleep?\" She whispered in the dark. \"Is everything all right Vickie?\" I said as she threw back my covers and quickly crawled in. \"I can't sleep.\" Was all she said as she snuggled close to me and stuck her cold toes on my leg and I threw my arm around her. \"You are a bit old for nightmares.\" I admonished, but in truth I did not care. I could not sleep a wink either for the full moon was near bright enough to read by. She stayed like that for a few minutes, running her hand through my hair, as was her habit when she was nervous or worried about something. \"Out with it, baby sister.\" I finally said. \"Oh Mattie, are you sure you are making the right decision!\" She cried out and the anguish in her voice surprised me. \"Victoria! What are you on about?\" I said. \"You know! About marrying Clarence!\" She hissed. \"Mattie do you even love him?\" She sighed dramatically. I rolled my eyes. \"Clarence is a good, respectable young man. I admire him.\" \"Oh!\" Victoria cried and buried her face in my pillow in anguish. \" Admire him? Poor Mattie!\" came her muffled reply. \"Victoria you are being ridiculous.\" At that she sat up stiffly and pushed away from me. I could see her tears in her eyes, shining in the moonlight. \"I am not! I am only considering your happiness! Mattie, can you really live with someone your entire life whom you only admire ? A marriage with no passion? I cannot imagine anything worse!\" \"You have been reading too many novels. This is real life Victoria, things are not always about feelings . This is about duty.\" \"This coming from you, someone who has lived such a grand adventure!\" She scoffed. \"I know you better than you know yourself, Mattie, at least I know the you that is beneath all your piety and solemnity. I cannot see you resigning your life to feeding chickens and baking pies. \" \"You do not know me then. There will be a matter of these farms to run.\" \"You know full well what I mean! I have seen you pine for those days, staring out into the sunset when you think no one is looking like some old man in his rockin' chair, thinking of his best days. I see the way your face changes when you talk about it – and the true fact that you never talk about it anymore.\" I had nothing to argue against that, so I sat back against the padded headboard and closed my eyes, suddenly weary. Victoria did not realize I had lived my best days in those few short weeks. To hope for some grander scheme any more was futile and silly. \"Did your cowboy ever write to you?\" Her hushed voice came to me. \"Marshall Cogburn? I showed you his letter the day it arrived.\" \"Not that old coot! I mean the Texas Ranger.\" Him. \"No.\" Was all I said. I was betrayed and surprise by the bitterness in my voice. \"You could still go look for him!\" She pursued. \"It has been four years Victoria. A man like him is either dead or married. And frankly I am shocked at your passion, Vickie!\" I admonished, but she shook her head and gripped my shoulder. \"And I am surprised by your lack of!\" She cried. \"My bullheaded sister Mattie, who always gotten exactly what she wants.\" \"Got. Or better yet, received. \" I corrected and she shot me a withering look. \"You love him, Mattie. Admit it.\" Her statement hung in the moonlight like a night owl – searching, waiting, silent. \"Love? What is love but a… a puff of smoke in a young and foolish girl's heart!\" I turned from away from her. \"I admit that I esteem Mr. LeBeouf greatly and I always will. I have yet to meet his equal.\" \"Esteem all you like, Mattie dear.\" Victoria flung the covers off and stomped to the door. \"But we both know the truth! You will take vows with Clarence when it is another man who holds your heart!\" The week came and went and soon I found myself in a pretty blue calico frock, headed for the Presbyterian Church in the carriage to bind my soul forever to another. I was tired, and there were dark circles etched under my eyes that made my mother sigh. Victoria had spoken scarcely a word to me since that night in my room, but her words echoed over and over in my mind nonetheless. It was a gray day, unseasonably cool and the threat of rain loomed in the sky. They say it is lucky for it to rain on your wedding day, but I say this is hogwash. The church was near full of smiling faces eager to see poor one-armed Mattie walk down the aisle alone, for Little Frank had already returned to school and my Papa watched from that Glory Above. I held my breath for a moment before I took to the aisle, sending a little prayer heavenward for strength. I joined Clarence before the pulpit; he was smiling and looked dapper in his Sunday suit. I smiled as best I could at him, but inside my heart gave a funny little turn. The preacher prayed over us and blessed us both. I hardly heard a word for the pounding of my blood in my ears. Vaguely I realized Clarence had taken my hand in his and was saying his vows. \"Matilda.\" The preacher turned to me. I had known him the entirety of my life and that was the first time he ever called me anything but Miss Mattie. \"Repeat after me: I, Matida Ross, take you, Clarence Throgmorton to be my lawfully wedded husband.\" I said so. \"To have and to hold\" \"To have and to hold\" Came my reply. \"To cherish, to love, to honor and obey.\" \"To- to cherish, to lo…\" To love? Could I really stand before God Almighty and proclaim to give my heart wholly to another when in truth… In truth it was pinned neatly beneath a silver Texas star. Tears rushed to my eyes and I felt near faint with sudden panic. \"Matilda?\" Clarence was staring at me with concern. He gave a little nervous laugh that sounded somewhat like a colt's whinny. \"Not getting cold feet are you?\" \"My name is Mattie, Clarence, and I do not think it prudent I marry you.\" I stated quietly, turned and ran from the church as fast as I could in the mud and the pouring rain, tossing my bouquet into a deepening puddle where a stray pig rooted for grubs.[Chapter 3] Chapter Two: All My Tears Now I do not want you to go on feeling sorry for Mr. Clarence Thaddeus Throgmorton III so I feel I ought to clear things up before moving on. All's well that end's well, as the poet says, and he ended up marrying Victoria not a year later. Yes, the very same sister of mine who neatly persuaded me not to marry him. Before you take up your sword against her, know that she did not have an evil scheme to turn me from him and keep him to herself. They met in town and at church and spoke often and fell in love as natural as two people do. Victoria wept great alligator tears the day she told m, and begged me not to be angry with her. I told her I gave them all my best, and I meant it. Victoria and Clarence were well suited to one another, he was quite proficient at being the head of the family and she was quite happy to be his helpmate – I am not sure the same could have been said of he and I. Time moved right along as it has always done and always will do. The spring I turned twenty years old found me on a train bound from Dallas to home, Little Frank in tow, though Little he was no longer. After Papa was gone and after my \"escapade\" across Indian Territory, Mama decided Frank would do well with a solid education away from home and under a man's influence, rather than my own, I am sure. He spent most of his next few years at the Texas Military Academy near Waco. He graduated that year, barely seventeen years old and a finer young man there never was. I attended his graduation ceremonies on my own, as Mama was not up to much traveling and Victoria was swollen with child. We rocked in contentment with the sway of the train, listening to the constant lull – clacka clacka clacka of the wheels on the track. Across from us sat a rather portly man in a tweed suit and bowler who must have the conscience of a babe - we were barely past the station when he started snoring softly. \"I met a girl, Mattie.\" Frank confided in me suddenly as he took my hand in his own. A lopsided grin tugged at his lips. I cocked my head and matched his smile. \"You never mentioned her before?\" He shook his head and looked down at our hands as he absently rubbed mine with his thumb. \"I did not wish to worry Mama. You know how she badgered me about my studies. I did not want her to think I was distracted.\" His smile grew wider. \"Her name is Anne and I love her more than anything, sis.\" \"Well Frank! I am happy for you!\" I beamed. \"Why did you not introduce me to this girl?\" \"Her family lives in Austin, but she comes to stay with an Aunt in Waco often. Oh Mattie how I wish you could have met her! You know I value your opinion greatly.\" \"Well I am sure that if she has captured your heart so readily I can not help but like her.\" I assured. \"But Frank, Austin is a long way from Dardanelle.\" He fidgeted for a minute, casting his gaze out the window, to the fat man and down the aisle – everywhere but to me. \"I am not going home to stay, Mattie May.\" He finally confessed, using his favorite nickname for me. He rushed on, his grip tightened on my hand as he spoke. \"I already have it figured! Anne's Daddy is a big man in Austin politics, he is going to help me get in the Texas Militia where I'll serve until I'm older and maybe make Sergeant or even First Lieutenant. Then Anne and I can get married and I am going to try for Texas Ranger – I have the brains and the skills for it, you know I have. You aren't the only one in the family with a hankering for adventure.\" He prodded me with his elbow. I stared at him open mouthed for a full minute. His clear brow knit with worry and his blue eyes darkened. \"You think I am a fool.\" He grimaced. \"Indeed I do not!\" I said, finally recovering. \"I am in a state of shock, that is all! Frank, I did not think you knew what you wanted from tomorrow, much less had your whole life figured!\" I laughed and shook my head. \"You certainly had me fooled! I never knew you to be such a big dreamer.\" \"But you think I can do it?\" He truly questioned me, and I knew he was searching for my approval. I sobered up and spoke with all the earnestness of my heart. \"Frank, if we Ross's have anything, it is grit. I have no doubt you will do all you say and more.\" His grin reflected my own and he fished a necklace out of his shirt, on the end was a tiny gold ring with an emerald set in it. \"Where in the world did you get the money for it?\" I asked, taking it in my hands to admire it better. \"I have worked two jobs the past couple of years, one moving hay and the other looking after a rich man's horses. He liked me so he paid me more than fair. Then all the money you and Mama and Grandpa Sterling in California have sent me.\" \"I did notice the elbows of your jacket are growing thin. I wondered why you had not found something new.\" I let a smile come over my face again as he slipped the treasure back under his shirt. \"Mama is going to have a conniption.\" \"I know it.\" He shot me a charming smile. \"You could tell her for me?\" I snorted and shook my head. \"Not likely. Now, tell me about this Anne of yours.\" Frank was more than happy to oblige me on the subject of his Anne and I confess I only half listened. The rest of my brain was ruminating on this new revelation. It seemed everyone had their lives sorted, hopes and dreams, plans and futures to pursue. I lost myself in a vision where I was on the single passenger on a silent and motionless train, stopped at the station with no intent or purpose to put it to motion once again. While I sat another train was passed me by – everyone I loved was on it but no one looked my way. \"What about you, Mattie May?\" Frank's question broke me from my dream. \"What about me?\" I said, with a little smile. \"Still butting heads with Clarence?\" \"Oh, Clarence is all right. He knows his business.\" I begrudged. \"Though he should not have sold those mules for what he did, it was nothing short of robbery. I told him so.\" \"I have no doubt you did.\" Frank watched me for a minute with those searching blue eyes. I did not like that look. \"Mattie May.\" He said with such fondness it made my heart clench. \"What about you?\" He repeated. \"What do you want to do with this life of yours? You are still a young woman, sis, for all the big show you put on.\" \"I do not recall claiming to be anything else.\" I knew my tone was surly. Frank put his arm around my shoulder. \"I just want you to be happy, sis. I want you to know what I know now. I want you to feel this love I have found.\" I rolled my eyes and then sent my gaze out the window. \"Never did I know I was related to a bunch of troubadours. All we need are lyres and lutes to complete the effect.\" Before Frank could respond to my jeer the sound of gunfire filled the cabin and the train gave a sudden lurch, throwing bags and trunks into the air and tossing people into the aisles, including our snoring neighbor, who woke up with a snort. In the blink of an eye two armed men stormed into our cabin, one sending a bullet from his pistol into the roof. It happened so fast no one even had the chance to scream. \"All right folks, y'all know what this is!\" He yelled from beneath the dirty black bandana that covered his face. He was a short-ish man, dressed in all the trappings of an outlaw. \"Out with your money and your pretties!\" His partner pulled out a flour sack and started dancing down the aisle with it. Frank put his arm in front of me and pushed me back behind him a bit, his face grave and his keen eyes watching. \"Do not do anything rash, Frank.\" I whispered, for I knew he had a Colt pistol matching mine somewhere on his person. The Ross's did not go unarmed. Mine was in it's holster beneath my left arm, hidden in my traveling cloak. Some of the women in the cabin began to twitter with fright, and from somewhere in front a toddler started wailing. \"Shut that babe up!\" The tall man yelled. \"I can't stand a howlin' child.\" I noticed out the window a mounted man holding four horses. That made four in the railcars, two in here. The man with the flour sack had his shotgun tucked up in the crook of his arm so he could hold the heavy sack with both hands, and he was giggling at the amount of swag weighing it down. \"I said hush that thing up!\" The pistoled bandit growled and rose his hand to strike the woman just as his minion with the sack got to us - Frank reached into his jacket and I knew it was not his watch and fob he was after. Quick as a flash we had our pistols out, his aimed directly at between the wide eyes of the lackey with the sack, mine pointed further ahead to the short man giving orders. Stillness settled in over the cabin as everyone held their breath collectively. My heart was pounding in my chest but my hand did not waver or shake. \"Well now.\" The short man said smugly. \"What have we here?\" He began sauntering our way. \"You hold your peace, pariah.\" I warned and he stopped, holding his pistols up towards the roof. Luckily for me, my voice did not quaver. \"So much for not being rash.\" I hissed at Frank. He ignored me. \"Now I want you to lay down that sack.\" Frank ordered the man in front of him. I was shocked at the coldness in his voice. \"Y'all just back on up out of here and I will allow this man to keep his brains in his head.\" \"Boy, you got some nerve, I'll give you that much.\" The short man warned, but his voice was amused. \"What is your name?\" \"Frank Ross, and you best not forget it. Now lay down that sack.\" The lackey did as he was told, slowly, never taking his wide eyes off Frank. \"Frank Ross you say?\" the short man questioned, and I noticed for the first time his eyes were focused on my missing left arm and the amusement was gone from his voice. \"I don't suppose that would make you Miss Mattie Ross?\" He asked me. \"What is it to you?\" I followed Frank as he pushed the other bandit towards the door, my pistol never straying from it's target. \"It is indeed a lot to me, Missy.\" His voice had grown cold by then and his blue eyes were like ice. \"It means a great deal to me, for it were a Mattie Ross that got my favorite little brother shot down in Arkansas. I heard tell she lost her arm that same day to a snakebite. Now, tell me if you recollect the name of Lucky Ned Pepper?\" \"He is not so lucky anymore.\" The quip was gone off my tongue before I had chance to think better of it. The tall man's brows fell heavy over his eyes. His lackey had backed up clean to his chest but the bandit would not move. \"Keep on out the door or this man will lose his head!\" Frank warned, but the bandit did not budge. I felt the situation quickly escalating from bad to worse. Damn Frank and his hot head! \"I think he might mean to shoot me, Jake!\" His lackey quivered, Frank's gun barrel all but pressed against his sweating forehead. \"I do not think so.\" He challenged, not taking his eyes from me. \"This must be your brother, is that right, Mattie Ross?\" He said my name all sweet-like, but there was no sugar on his tongue. I did not give him a reply and he kept on. \"I do not think it right that your brother is alive well and my brother's bones lie in shallow grave, do you, Mattie Ross?\" By the time his words were hissed from his lips he brought one of his pistols down like lightning and the sound of gunfire roared through the cabin. His first shot went through the lackey's chest, blowing blood and gore all over Frank and me, but he was supernaturally fast and fired once again before I could get my first shot. I fired back but fired wide and he kicked my feet out from under me, sending my pistol clattering across the cabin. I fell down next to Frank, who lay motionless on the floor. . \"Frank?\" I said his name, forgetting the bandit in a moment of panic as my eyes met with the growing red stain on the breast of his blue corduroy jacket. \"Frank! Oh God!\" I pressed my hand to the wound. He was growing ever paler, his breath ragged and shallow. His eyes met mine and reflected he fear I felt. \"A brother for a brother, Mattie Ross.\" The bandit said, pulling down his bandana so I could see his ugly face. I spit at him and he kicked me in the gut, doubling me over. I gasped for air and could do nothing but watch as he reached his filthy hand down to pluck the necklace and ring from Frank's chest. In a vulgar gesture he kissed the ring and held it out to me. A robber stuck his head in the door. \"Jake, let's high tail it outta here!\" He called. Jake smiled at me and took the bloody flour sack from his dead friend before bolting out the door. Vaguely I heard someone yell that the conductor had been shot and there was a flurry of pandemonium around me, but mostly all I could hear was the low moan issued from my brother's throat. \"I fear I am done in, Mattie May.\" He whispered. \"No!\" I ordered sternly threw myself on him and wrapping him tight with my one arm. \"You are not. You will not leave me, Little Frank!\" Someone then was at my elbow, pulling me back but I jerked from their grasp \"Please Miss, I am a doctor!\" It was the portly man in tweed. I felt many hands pulling me back then and the mother of the wailing toddler, now silent, put her arm about my waist and wiped the gore from my face with her handkerchief while she prayed quietly for Frank. It was late that night I found myself in a hospital room just outside Waco. I resisted any attempts to make me comfortable and remained at Frank's side, not caring to clean the blood from my dress and hair. The first bullet went clean through the unfortunate bandit's head and buried itself in Frank's shoulder, the second passed through him, nicking a lung. The doctor's hands were guided by the Almighty that night and they had hope for Frank, but he was not out of the woods yet. I sat in silent vigil at his bedside, feeling utterly useless. There was no one to bargain with, no deals to be made or accords to be struck. That fine balance between life and death is a cold, wonton place bereft of choice and action. There is nothing to be done but wait, hope and pray. I slid to my knees there beside Frank's bed, my face pressed into the bed and my hand clinging to his. I shook so fiercely with fear and trepidation I though I might be ill. I stayed that way and prayed, prayed from the deepest depths of my soul for God's grace, for His mercy, for a miracle. I cried harder than I ever cried before or since; guttural, violent sobs that choked me and left me gasping. \"Mattie!\" A voice reached down to me in my sorrow and I could feel a pair of strong hands on my shoulders. \"Mattie Ross!\" There was a body there, kneeling next to mine at Frank's beside and speaking to me with a voice I never forgot. He pulled me back from my prostration on the bed and turned my shoulders to face him. I could see his eyes through my bleary gaze – brilliant and blue and full of worry. \"Mattie are you hurt?\" He said, still holding me tight by the shoulders as we kneeled by the bed. I shook my head, covering my face with my hand, ashamed of my tears and hiccups that I could not control. He pulled my hand down and I met his searching gaze. \"It is you.\" He said quietly, more to himself than me. A wave of dizziness passed over me and I thought for a moment I might swoon. LaBoeuf pulled me against his chest then, one arm wrapped tightly around my back and the other hand stroking my head like a child. I tried to push away but found I lacked the strength to fight so I resigned myself to trembling in his arms like a damsel. \"You are in shock from your ordeal.\" He said quietly. \"Astute as ever, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" I mumbled into his chest as comfort washed over me. He was warm and smelled of sweet pipe tobacco, gun oil and horses. I clutched his jacket in my hand and pressed my forehead into his scratchy neck. \"My brother is shot to pieces.\" I whispered. \"But I know the Good Lord will see him through.\" \"I believe you are right.\" LaBoeuf agreed. \"See for yourself.\" I pulled back from him quickly and looked at Frank, who was watching us through heavy lidded eyes. \"Frank!\" LaBoeuf helped me to sit on his bedside and I stroked my brother's cheek. The corners of his lip quirked up just the tiniest bit. \"Don't see that everyday.\" His voice was a hoarse whisper. \"What is that Frank?\" \"…Mattie May… in the arms of some stranger…\" His little smile broadened just a bit. My heart felt as though it would burst from joy. \"You rest easy now, Frank.\" I said, kissing his forehead. He nodded ever so slightly as he closed his eyes. I watched him breathe steady for a moment, forgetting we were not alone. There was a knock at the door and the resident doctor came in. He was an older gentlemen with a \"crown of glory\" and thick glasses. I told him Frank had spoken and he too took it as a good sign. He encouraged me again to walk to the boarding house nearby to wash and rest in a littler room they kept ready by the kitchen for just such an occasion. \"Though it is late in the evening for a young lady to go walking about, I am sure the Ranger will see you there safely.\" The doctor said as he took his leave. LaBoeuf leaned against the doorframe with his arms crossed over his chest. I regarded him resignedly. Had I not been so utterly spent, I might have thought of a clever comment as he took my arm in his and led me from the room. As it was, we walked in silence through the halls and out into the quiet, cool night. The crunch of our feet on the gravel was the only sound. \"It was Ned Pepper's brother.\" I finally said, my voice like a ghost haunting the still air. \"I know it. He is wanted for killing a bank teller, among other crimes. He and his gang are thought to be holed up just west of here. We make for them in a few short hours, at first light.\" \"How did you come to be here?\" \"I have been stationed in Waco these past three months.\" \"Oh.\" \"I am sure how you came to be here is a much more interesting story.\" He looked at me curiously and spoke in a low tone. \"It would seem Fate has not intended for you to lead an easy life, Miss Mattie.\" We had reached the room and where a pretty colored girl waited for me in the door. I took my arm from LeBoeuf's and shifted awkwardly away from him. \"I will check in on you and your brother on my return.\" He said and with a tip of his hat, he was gone. The colored girl's name was Lettie and she was a doll, taking pity on me in my sad state. She had drawn me a bath and helped me out of my soiled clothes, even going so far as washing my hair. I allowed her to lead me around like a helpless child. Even my pride was worn out by that point. When she had me bathed and plaited my hair she dressed me in Frank's nightshirt. Someone had been kind enough to fetch his trunk from the train, but my little bag was nowhere to be found. I collapsed on the little feather mattress by the fire, wrapped in Frank's scent and quickly fell into a dreamless sleep. Phew, I have never churned out a story this quick! I hope you are not turned off by Mattie's breakdown in this chapter, she will be back to her usual tricks in the next. But really, even tough girls lose it now and then, don't we?[Chapter 4] Thanks for all the reviews and alerts! Chapter 3: Firecracker Frank was much improved even in the scant hours since I last saw him. His pallor was better and in the few moments he was awake they managed to get him to drink some water. I spent the morning in his room and wrote a letter to Mama with few details, merely mentioning Frank and I stayed over to \"see the sights\" in Waco. No need worrying her over things completely out of her control. All day my mind wandered back to the events prior. I could not get past the thought of Frank's precious ring, lost to that vile man. I hoped beyond measure they could recover it, that LeBoeuf and his Rangers had arrested Jake Pepper and his gang but something in my gut told me it was not to be so. This premonition proved itself that same day around noontime as I took a little stroll to clear my head and stretch my woes. A ways down the dusty, bustling road was a livery with what looked like a few fresh horses out front for loan. I stopped in my tracks when I laid eyes on one in particular, my mind flashing back to the previous day. I had looked out the window briefly and noticed a single man keeping the horses for getaway. One of the horses caught my eye and stood out in my mind – a pretty little grey roan with a white mask and mane - an interesting little pony and more importantly a unique little pony. That very same little pony stood now at the livery with it's ears ticked straight towards me and watched me with dewy black eyes as if she recognized me too. My heart pounded in my breast like a drum as I stomped my way into the office where a man sat at an oak desk filling out papers. He was scrawny as a scarecrow and twice as ugly. His black hair was greased back with what looked like pig lard and his bushy moustache covered all of his mouth and it twitched like a rabbit's tail when he spoke. A seedier looking man never lived. His black eyes looked me up and down as I approached. A brass nameplate on his desk said Sheamus McKinney. He looked about as Irish as a buffalo. \"May I help you, ma'am?\" He oozed, but did not bother to so much as rise from his seat. \"Do not bother yourself to get up, trash!\" I scolded and he at least had sense enough to look taken back. \"I came to inquire about that roan hitched outside. Just when and where did you come by her?\" His moustache twitched and he leisurely too a sip of black coffee. Brown glistening drops clung to his whiskers like muddy water. \"That is a beautiful little gal, ain't she?\" He said as he leaned back in his chair. \"I am not here to query her looks.\" I snapped. He sipped his coffee again. \"I found her myself, roaming the Oklahoma prairie like a gray ghost. Perhaps she is…\" He tried to sound mysterious and theatrical, no doubt thinking he could swoon me out of my money with some romantic story. I slammed my palm down on his table with a satisfying smack and caused him to jump in his seat and slosh a bit of his coffee into his lap. \"I do not want to hear any of your tall tales, charlatan! If you will not offer where you found the pony, then I will be forced to job your memory. She was until just recently the property of one Thomas Dawson, a thief whose blood ruined my best traveling dress.\" I leaned over the desk, pointing down at him. \"You must have come by his companions and bought the horse from them, sorry rabble they were! You will tell me now where exactly you met them and exactly when this meeting occurred, or I shall report you to my very good friend, Sergeant LeBoeuf of the Texas Rangers, for withholding information as to the whereabouts of the Jake Pepper gang, wanted for murder, attempted murder and robbery! I do not think hanging is too great a punishment for persons aiding nefarious criminals, procuring evidence and withholding information. I am sure the lawmen, once alerted to your own disreputable activities, would become aware of some other discrepancies in this fine establishment of yours, would they not, Mr. McKinney?\" He sat stock still, staring at me as though I were a banshee sent straight from hell to torment him for his sins. After a moment's hesitation sizing me up… he told me. Spilled the beans, as they say, but he was not happy about it. I cannot repeat what he said, for there were many colorful words peppering his confession that a Christian should not utter. Once he finished, I said, \"Now, I am willing to relieve you of the pony that has caused you so much grief for a fair price. No doubt those men, being in such a hurry, sold you the saddle and the rest of the trappings with it. I am willing to offer you twenty five dollars for the lot.\" I always carried money in my boot when I travelled, for you never know when you might be in need of it. That sent him to his feet and I was tickled to notice he was a good three inches shorter than myself. \"That's highway robbery!\" He sputtered. I looked down my long nose at him and said, \"Well, you of all people would know robbery when you see it, right, Mr. McKinney?\" I gave my new pony to the stable boy at the hotel to feed and give a good combing. She was a calm, sweet spirited mare; I knew we would fast become friends. Mr. McKinney was right in likening her to a ghost so I named her \"Spookie.\" I returned to my room then for some sausage and cheese and a little nap. I woke up some time later feeling quite refreshed. I fished out Frank a change of clothes from his trunk, noting a lovely pair of deerskin riding breeches that must have come from his rich employer. I asked Lettie if she would mind throwing them in the wash for me, extra hot water. \"But Miss Mattie, they'll shrink!\" She said to me. \"Precisely,\" came my reply. Frank was awake and sitting up a bit on some pillows when I returned, a pretty little Mexican nurse tending to him. She giggled at something he said when I walked in. \"Mr. Ross!\" She tittered before sashaying out. I threw him a look and he responded with that dashing smile of his. That boy could charm the bark off a tree. \"I see you are feeling better?\" I questioned as I sat down next to him on the bed. He put his hand on my arm. \"Tired.\" He said, and he looked it. \"You wrote to Mama?\" I nodded. \"You did not tell her what happened, right?\" I chuckled. \"I am not crazy, despite what most people will say.\" He nodded and closed his eyes. \"The doctor was here a little while ago, said I would be here two weeks at least. \"I figured as much.\" I said. \"Why did you do it, Frank?\" I knew the answer, but I wanted him to say it. \"I thought I could help, sister.\" He sighed. \"I cannot just sit by and let justice go unserved.\" \"Unserved' is not a word, Frank, but I know what you mean. Still, it was a foolhardy thing to do.\" I leaned against him. He knew what I meant without me saying it. \"I do believe you are the last person to lecture about such things.\" He opened his eyes to wink at me and was caught by the stern look on my face. \"Mattie May, what is going on in that head of yours?\" His grip on my arm tightened, but I was saved a reply by a knock at the door. LeBoeuf stood in the doorway and I rose to greet him. He took his hat in his hand like I was some high borne lady and nodded my way. I noticed with a smile that his cowlick was as stubborn as ever. \"It is a gracious day when Mattie Ross greets you with a smile.\" He said. My face quickly fell and my cheeks reddened just a little bit. \"Mr. Ross, you are looking much improved.\" He said to Frank. \"I do not believe we have been properly introduced, I am Samuel LeBoeuf.\" Samuel suited him just fine, thought I. I figured people called him \"Sam\" on occasion, however, and that did not suit him at all. \"Mr. LeBoeuf, it is a pleasure to meet you.\" Frank said, offering his hand weakly. I did not like the sweet undertone in his voice. \"Finally, I have heard many things about you.\" At this he directed a mischievous look in my direction. \"Ahem!\" I cleared my throat loudly. \"Mr. LeBoeuf, I imagine you have come to tell us of the apprehension of the Jake Pepper gang?\" \"I wish it were so. As it was, we went on a wild goose chase. I am sorry.\" It was as I figured then. This news sent a little starch out of Frank and he sunk back further on his pillows. \"You will still go after them, right?\" Frank asked, his voice hopeful. \"You are Texas Rangers, after all.\" I ruffled his hair back – at times I forgot he was only seventeen. Mr. LeBoeuf puffed out his chest a bit more at that. \"I can assure you that we will do everything in our power to bring these men to justice.\" He looked at me, too, catching my gaze and holding it. I felt the pink creep back in my cheeks and I chastised myself for it. \"You are tired, Frank. I think it is best if we let you rest tonight.\" I kissed his forehead. \"Things will look better in the morning.\" He nodded slightly, already on his way to sleep. Mr. LeBoeuf tried to take my arm again as we left the room, but I shimmied out of his grasp. He cleared his throat to speak but I beat him to it. \"Mr. LeBoeuf, I would be much obliged if you would accompany me to dinner this evening? I have heard the hotel's dumpling are quite delicious.\" He favored me with an exasperated look. \"Well Ms. Ross, I was going to ask you the same, but it seems you are not a lady who waits for a gentlemen's invitation.\" \"Indeed I am not a lady, Mr. LeBoeuf, and if I happen to see any gentlemen in this dusty town I assure you I will act with the utmost decorum.\" A half smile slipped while I made my jibe and he roared with laughter. \"Same old Mattie Ross.\" He chuckled, taking my arm in his while I was distracted, perhaps by his smile. I felt my heart give a little twist and I knew then and there I was in trouble. The restaurant in the hotel was clean and comfortable with a few partons making quiet conversation in the lamplight. We ordered the house special – chicken and dumplings, then settled into an uncomfortable silence. I felt every bit as self conscious as I did the first day we shared a meal together, six years ago in the boarding house at Ft. Smith. LeBoeuf shifted uncomfortably in his chair. \"I apologize, I have been calling you Ms. Ross when surely that is no longer your name.\" I felt my feathers ruffle but I swallowed my pride along with a sip of iced tea. \"Indeed it is, though Mattie was good enough six years ago and it is still fine now.\" He gave me a queer look then, which I was unable to decipher. I thought maybe he was going to be ill. \"LeBoeuf? Are you all right?\" He recovered quickly, taking a draw from his mug. We entered into light conversation then, speaking of trivial things like the price of cotton and his new horse. A fog of unease had settled over both of us, as happens sometimes when you see someone you have not seen for a long while. We were both happy for the distraction of eating when the food arrived. The dumplings were good, though not anything as good as the one's Mama used to make on cold winter days. Once our bellies were full, I cleared my throat and straightened my back, ready to do business. \"So what about Jake Pepper?\" I finally asked. \"When will you all continue your search for them?\" \"Now Mattie, the Rangers here are already stretched thin as butter.\" \"You mean not to chase after them?\" \"Did I say that? I only mean that it will be difficult to get started with no clear trail to follow. Jake Pepper and his buddies are slippery one's. If there was an idea of where to look I would be after them like a fox on a rabbit's trail.\" \"Oh, there is a trail to follow, Mr. LeBoeuf, if your eyes are open to see it. I have a business proposition for you.\" I said. \"I bet you do.\" He said dryly. I ignored his comment and continued. \"I came across certain information today that I believe is your metaphorical rabbit.\" \"Is that so?\" He cut in and not at all in a friendly tone. \"It is so, and I will thank you not to interrupt me again! I have recently come into possession of a roan pony, which I recognized immediately as one of the horses in company of Pepper's gang. It is a very unique looking creature, as you will see. I spotted her outside McGinney's livery just this morning, and after questioning Mr. McGinney as to where and when he acquired her I have learned valuable information about the location and destination of Pepper's gang.\" LeBoeuf's eyes grew darker as I spoke, his brow deepening over his blue eyes. He learned forward now, not taking his eyes off me. \"Go on.\" He said as I paused to gather my wits. I turned my nose up slightly at him and continued. \"Now, I am willing to pay you seventy-five dollars for capture of Jake Pepper and the return of something very valuable to me, as well as supply our food and other necessaries for the journey. You will receive twenty-five now and the rest on his capture. I believe the reward currently offered for him is somewhere around two hundred dollars?\" \"That is correct.\" \"And that would be yours to keep as well, I do not expect to keep my share for our efforts. Justice is enough reward for me.\" I looked straight back at him now, daring him to rebuff. He studied me for a long moment with eyes that glittered with anger. \"Absolutely not.\" He finally said, pushing away from the table. With hat in hand he made his way to the door without so much as looking at me. I admit I was expecting more of a fight. \"LeBoeuf!\" I called his name as I followed him out into the lamp lit street. He walked on, not turning my direction. \"LeBoeuf, it is a good offer!\" I stepped in front of him, blocking his path and grabbed his arm. \"What reason do you give for refusing it?\" He glared down at me and I felt a little swirl of unease in my stomach. Roughly he took my hand and jerked me down the sidewalk to my little room off the back. He threw open the door and quite literally flung me inside, slamming the door behind him. I was reminded suddenly of a moment we shared by the river. \"Surely you did not mean to give me a good hiding at twenty years old!\" I growled. He threw his hat at me and hit me right in the nose! I sat on the bed in shock. \"I ought to, by golly!\" He cried. \"Tell me why you will not accept my offer.\" I rubbed my nose sullenly. \"Tell you- Mattie Ross, you are the most vexing creature God has ever created! I would take a thousand stubborn mules over you!\" \"It is because of my arm, is it not? I manage just as well and better than most people who still have two!\" He gave me a scathing look then. \"I have no doubt of that. Even just today you have managed to hornswaggle Mr. McKinney-\" \"Hornswaggle!\" \"Yes, hornswaggle! Why did you not go directly to the law when you recognized the pony?\" \"...Because I knew I could deal with him better than some chumped up deputy! And I wanted that pony!\" I regretted my words as soon as they left my mouth. LeBoeuf looked smug then and whipped the little wooden chair around, pressing the back of it against my knees and sitting in it backwards, trapping me to the bed. He leaned over the back, inches from my face; I could smell the beer from dinner on his breath. \"You wanted the pony?\" He said and I nodded. \"You wanted the pony to go gallivanting off on some big adventure again. Lose another arm or worse ! After hearing what your brother did I am certain you are a foolhardy family.\" I opened my mouth to protest but he put one of his big hands over it and I glared at him over it. \"There is no wheedling to be done here, Mattie Ross. I am the judge and jury. I will take your case and pursue Jake Pepper on my own, that is final . You will wait here until your brother is well then see him back home. Now, tell me what Mr. McGinney told you.\" He removed his hand and I pursed my lips into a thin line. \"Mattie…\" He warned. I stopped myself short of crossing my arms, well trying to anyway, and opted to turn my nose up and away from him. This point near boiled him over. \"Fine, if you do not tell me, the trail goes cold and Pepper will get off scot free. Is that what you want?\" \"Of course not.\" I said and looked back at him \"If you will not take me, I will find someone who will. I am sure not every Texas Ranger is as virtuous as you, Mr. LeBoeuf. Is that what you want? To see me ride off into the wild with some disreputable curr?\" This was a dirty hand, but I dealt it anyway. He softened a bit, only just a bit, his hands gripping the sides of the chair until his knuckles were white. \"I do not want that, you know it. You make a good point besides the danger, though - traveling with me will stain your reputation, Mattie. What about your prospects, your reputation as a young lady?\" \"Mr. LeBoeuf, I am a one armed girl of little consequence with a tongue like a whip, and you said yourself that I am unattractive. I have no prospects.\" Strangely enough, my throat tightened up as I spoke. Sometimes the truth will choke you. I turned away from him, ashamed. It was a few breaths before LeBoeuf spoke but I could feel his eyes on me. \"Why is it so important you catch him yourself? Do you not trust me to come through?\" \"I do. You are a fine example of your sex, and I have said before you proved to have true grit. I stand by that.\" I fidgeted with a ruffle on my skirt. \"He took Frank's engagement ring for his sweetheart. It was a personal insult to us. Had he not been shot he would be hot on Pepper's tail to get it back. I doubt you would have fought with him about it.\" I shot him a look. \"I would not have, but he is a stout young man and you are a young lady.\" \"I am no lady.\" I mumbled. He reached out and fingered the cream lace at my collar. \"You could have fooled me.\" His voice was softer than it had ever been and his blue eyes were heavy-lidded. I felt blush rise to my cheeks and I prayed he could not hear my heart that suddenly felt the need to beat like a war drum. The moment ended as quickly as it began, he stood up and pulled the chair away from me. \"You will really find someone else should I refuse?\" I nodded. \"Someone rougher around the edges than Rooster, if I can.\" I was serious and he knew it. He sighed and shook his head. \"You are one firecracker, Mattie Ross. Be ready at dawn.\" I was ready before dawn. The afternoon before I had already settled with the hotel cook to make us provisions for our journey, which he provided later that evening after LeBoeuf left. I packed them up neatly in the saddlebags. Lettie brought me the deerskin breeches that she had shrunk in the wash. They fit me snug; perfect for long rides through God knows what kind of Texas country. If Rooster was telling anything close to the truth there were more thorns than green leaves in this brush. And, much to my luck and blessing, the same young lady who passed away in the cream colored gown was an avid rider staying at the hotel, from what Lettie said, in hopes of snagging her one of those richey big time cattle men that frequented the area. I was able to buy a pair of her used riding boots and felt hat for a fair price. It may have been because she died while wearing them, bucked off and kicked by a horse. Some people are superstitious about that sort of thing, but it does not hold water with me. I borrowed one of Frank's linen shirts and a dove grey vest. They were a little big but worn in and comfortable. I would take his scent with me, anyway. Across my hips I slung his gun belt and holsters, fitted with his and my matching Colt pistols. I had to make an extra hole in the leather for the belt to fit. Late in the night as my candle burned dangerously low I penned Frank a long letter to be delivered mid-morning explaining my actions. I did not figure him to be surprised, but I knew he would be mad as a hornet. I had tried to convince him of my noble intentions, just as I had done the previous night to LeBoeuf. My excuses were every bit as flimsy as they had been the night before. I did want justice. I did want to see that precious ring, a symbol of all things good and right, delivered back into my brother's hand. But there was more to it than just that. I needed to go against the grain of my sex, of my handicap. If I had been born a boy, I would no doubt be a bounty hunter or Ranger or great military man. Instead I was born a girl who had become a woman. A right proper woman, expected to sit at home and embroider pillows. Had I been born of a poor family, I would have at least had the honor of working hard, scratching out a living from dirt and rocks. My sense of adventure and longing for something more was what drove me. That… and the fact that I would be adventuring with my one truest love. So I waited until I heard him knock on my door just before first light. I quickly tied my hair over one shoulder and put on my new hat. Outside the stable boy held my pony, I paid him a nickel to get her ready for me. I opened the door, ready for a new adventure. LeBoeuf stood in my doorway and I heaved a sigh of relief that he knew better than to take off without me. He blinked in surprise before a shadow fell over his face. He put his hands on my shoulders and started pushing me back inside. Had he changed his mind? \"You get right back in there young lady and put on something decent!\" He growled like an old man. \"What?\" I ducked down out of his grasp and whirled back around to face him. \"If you think I am going to ride across Texas in a corset and stockings you are sorely mistaken!\" I planted my hand on my hip and stood my ground. \"If you wish, I will pull my hair up in my hat and pretend to be a man. You may speak for the both of us if we should come upon someone.\" \"Number one, the day you let someone else speak for you will be the day the trumpets sound and the Angel of the Lord himself comes to carry us home. Number two, no one would ever be fooled into thinking you were a man.\" He caught me off guard with his complement, and he knew it. There was an awkward silence between us. This did not bode well for the coming days; all we seemed to be able to do was fight and discomfort one another. I reached down and pulled my traveling cloak from off the chair rest. I had intended to wear it all along, as the spring morning was quite chilly. I wrapped it around my neck and buttoned it tight. \"There. Better?\" I said and walked past him without waiting for a reply. Phew! Finally, the story begins![Chapter 5] A/N I apologize for the delay! Life, you know. Thanks so much for the awesome reviews and alerts! Also: Buccee ' s , lol. Distress Pt. 1 So fades the lovely blooming flower Frail smiling solace of an hour So soon our transient comforts fly And pleasure only blooms to die ~Crooked Still \"You are certain McKinney said Buccee's?\" LaBoeuf asked me for what must have been the third time. I heaved a great sigh and nodded my head curtly. LaBoeuf blew air from his nose like a horse and shook his head. \"I have known Buc Walters for many years and have never ,\" he emphasized the word, cutting the air with his hand, \"ever suspected him of running anything but a reputable and respectable business.\" \"No one knows what is in the hearts of man but the Lord.\" I said absently, not really allotting much attention to his doubts. We had ridden since dawn, southward and soon to turn west, passing many farms and homesteads along the way. Texas seemed a ripe and fertile country and I noted that I had yet to see so much as a sticker burr. By evening the rolling farms outside Waco gave way to tall, lonesome pines that creaked and cracked us hello as we rode by. I shifted again in the saddle, unable to find a place to appease my aching backside. Spookie was a sweet tempered and beautiful horse but she had a rough trot and an even worse lope. Indeed it seemed she only had two comfortable speeds: very fast or very slow. I attempted discretion about my saddle woes but LaBoeuf, who was never without at least one eye on me it seemed, took notice. \"We will let soon and make camp for the night. I imagine you are suffering already from the long hours in the saddle, being unaccustomed to the task of hard riding as you are.\" He boasted, one hand on his hip and the other resting on the saddle horn as was his habit. \"I myself have ridden for days on end without setting so much as a toe on the earth. A Ranger learns to disregard his own needs and sensitivities while in pursuit of a criminal.\" \"Did you shoot straight from the saddle then or is your body so well trained as to not take so much as one sip of water during those arduous days of travel?\" I said saucily. I do not normally speak so crudely, but his continual boasting did not need to go unchecked and I was mighty tired of it. Once he caught my drift, his head whipped in my direction and I was gratified to see a bit of color in his cheeks. He looked away just as quick. \"I see that tongue of yours is no more honeyed now than it was before.\" He grumbled. We had passed the day quickly; I listened to LaBoeuf as he rattled away about his adventures during the past few years. I did not believe the majority of it but he was a good storyteller and very entertaining. He spoke with clarity and his cadence flowed along comfortably with the clop clop clop of the horse hooves. As he spoke he articulated his words with his hands, especially when he was \"telling a good one.\" The man was a talker. One might almost forget we were in pursuit of a criminal and imagine rather we were just out for a pleasant Sunday afternoon ride. Almost. The sun soon dipped low on the horizon, darkness coming soft but quick in the shadows of the pines. We made camp in a little copse of ash trees that managed to claim their own straggling piece of sunlight from the thick evergreens. There was a crick nearby where I watered the horses as LaBoeuf set up camp. By the time I returned he had a cheery cook fire going. I shooed him away and took over, placing his spindle legged skillet over the fire and throwing some thick portions of bacon in it. They soon began to sizzle and pop and I added heaping portions of cornmeal I mixed with water to fry in the fat. LaBoeuf watched me work openly. \"You do get on very well.\" He observed. \"Though I am not surprised, knowing your obstinacy.\" \"I am not one to let something hold me down.\" I said proudly. \"I know it.\" He said, catching my eye. \"So Mattie Ross, what have you done with yourself these past six years?\" I noted he knew the exact time as well I as I did. \"Or should I say, who have you been haranguing?\" He said the last bit with a smile that crinkled the corner of his eyes, proud of his joke. I ignored it, shrugging my shoulders as I set two camp plates down on a rock near the fire to serve our portions into. \"There is always work to be done.\" I said noncommittally, taking my seat with my plate in my lap not too far from his side. Before he could handle his spoon I reached over and slipped my fingers into his hand, bowing my head. \"Gracious Father, we thank you for what we are about to receive. We ask that you would bless us and give us wisdom on our journey and to grace Frank with a speedy recovery. Amen.\" I attempted to pull my hand from LaBoeuf's then but found it arrested there. I looked sharply at him only to be stilled by the sudden tenderness in his blue eyes trained on our joined hands. His hand was warm and calloused and wrapped around mine like a bear paw. \"It is not an unpleasant thing to have company on a journey, for all I may carp against it.\" He said earnestly. After another moment he released my hand from his. Immediately it protested against the sudden lack of warmth so I occupied it with my own spoon, fearing it would drift back to him of it's own accord. After a few minutes of uncomfortable silence, LaBoeuf cleared his throat and spoke. \"Your mother, she is well?\" I glanced at him then, surprised by this sudden exchange of pleasantries. \"Mama is doing well enough as to be expected. She is of a delicate nature and low spirits. She has Victoria to dote on her and soon she will have the welcome distraction of a little one in the house.\" My voice held a drop of wistfulness as I thought of home and of Victoria eagerly awaiting her new babe. \"I am to be an Aunt.\" I told LaBoeuf proudly. He smiled and cocked his head towards me. \"Congratulations are in order then. You did not say your sister was settled.\" \"Yes, she had been Mrs. Clarence Throgmorton the Third for a-\" Here my statement was cut short by LaBoeuf being throttled viciously by a bit of bacon. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" I pounded my fist between his shoulders. He coughed and sputtered and I quickly handed him his canteen from which he took a long draw. \"Are you sorted?\" I asked, kneeling down next to him with my hand on his shoulder. His face was beet red and there were tears in his eyes but he nodded, still coughing. \"I am sorted.\" He stammered. I set back down to allow him some dignity. After a few deep breaths and throat rattles he seemed well enough. \"Pardon me.\" He finally said roughly. \"You were saying your sister was married.\" \"Yes, to our neighbor's son, Clarence Throgmorton. They make a smart match, for he is intelligent enough and she is beautiful.\" I did not feel like elaborating on Clarence and I's past… or lack thereof. I felt his blue eyes on me and looked up to meet his gaze, surprised to see an oddly pinched look on his face. \"And you yourself have never married.\" He stated quietly, almost to himself. \"I have not, as I told you once before.\" My confused reply came equally as quiet. \"I suppose the task of managing your family's farm has been relented to Mr. Throgmorton's shoulders then.\" He stated. \"It has.\" I conceded, not without a slight tinge of bitterness creeping into my voice. I could feel LaBoeuf's eye on me as I pushed my fried corn biscuits around on my plate absently. \"It is what is only right and proper.\" He said sagely. \"Though I have not often known you to be one to yield to what is right or proper.\" This earned a glower from me but I held my tongue, considering our current situation. \"Clarence does a fine job managing the farm.\" I grumbled, hating every word. \"Though there are some things we do not see eye to eye on, such as the best day to plant. I believe it is best to take an average of past frost dates and good rain days to come up with a median day that falls well between. We have always kept meticulous records of such in our family. Clarence always plants by the moon phase, superstitious mumbo-jumbo if you ask me. I have told him so on many occasion.\" LaBoeuf chuckled. \"I have no doubt of that whatsoever.\" We finished our meal in silence and I felt the conversation over until LaBoeuf spoke again with a serious set to his mouth and eyes. \"So where does that leave you, Mattie?\" \"There is the house to manage, as well as the barnyard and such. There is always work to be done.\" I repeated my sentiment from earlier. \"I do not see you content with such a life, knitting stockings comfortably by a fire. I propose that is the real reason why you insisted on accompanying me on this dangerous manhunt. You are not cut from the same cloth as the rest of your sex.\" I felt my face grow hot and indignant. \"How dare you profess to know me!\" I scowled. \"It is impertinent and I will not stand for it!You are as pompous and vain as ever in all your superciliousness.\" \"You may say what you wish of me, but you do not argue that what I say is truth.\" His blue eyes sought mine and I turned away in anger. \"I do not argue with fools, it is an imprudent waste of my time.\" I said haughtily. It burned me up inside that this man of all should understand me so well. I heard LaBoeuf sigh heavily beside me and tap out his pipe on a rock and toss another handful of sticks on the fire. After a good while, it was LaBoeuf who broke the silence. \"Have you ever seen it rain amphibians?\" \"I…what?\" I turned to him, forgetting my anger in surprise. \"I myself have witnessed a toad storm.\" I had no response to this, so he continued after filling his pipe with tobacco. \"I was near Lubbock when it happened. There was a storm off to the nor'east, and a bad one. I could tell by the greenish cast to the clouds; the way the wind pulled towards it. About the time I figured I ought to high tail it out of there, something heavy and wet hit the brim of my hat, knocking it clean off my head. Spooked my horse something fierce, that same Appalachian pony you will remember, and she took off like a shot without me. I went to retrieve my hat when something else made a loud, wet ploppin' sound directly to my left. It was a toad, facedown on the ground and all splayed out. As I was mightily and understandably puzzling over this, there came another ploppin' sound, and another and so on. It was raining toads from that great big green storm cloud. About that time, the loudest, wickedest bolt of lightening straight from the hand of God hit the ground not too far from me. I laid out flat as one of those toads and prayed to be spared. Before long the wind shifted and that storm moved off to the east. There were toads everywhere but not one drop of rain. It did not take me long thereafter to find my horse; I only followed the scent of burnt flesh and hair. That one wicked lightening bolt had struck her down. Had it not been for those toads, I would have been struck down as well.\" I stared at him for a long while. \"Toads?\" I finally managed to croak. He winked at me, a smile playing at the corner of his lips. \"As I live and breathe.\" He said, settling back on his pack with his hands behind his head. I felt a smile then, twitching my lips and no amount of effort could control it. That smile soon turned to a grin, which soon turned to a full out, side clutching howl of laughter. LaBoeuf chuckled at my mirth. \"That was a hundred and twenty five dollar pony, I'll have you know.\" He said dryly. \"And one never really gets the scent of smote horseflesh from your nostrils.\" He took a deep breath. \"Yes, it is still there today.\" Eventually I fell back on my blanket, wiping tears from my eyes. LaBoeuf wore a pleased smile like the cat that got the cream. \"You are beautiful when you laugh, Mattie Ross.\" I felt the smile slip at once from my face. I sat up and turned to lash him for nettling me, but I stopped short when I saw his face. He was no longer smirking. The humor was gone from his eyes, replaced by anxious honesty. \"You ought not say such things.\" I told him sternly, though my rebuke did not come out as icy as I wished. What I meant was you ought not play with a girl's heart. \"Maybe I ought not, but it is the truth.\" The seriousness in his eyes had me utterly disconcerted. Without another word I gathered our plates and cooking pot and took them to the crick to wash. I scoured them furiously with some gravel then splashed the frigid water on my burning face. When I finally returned to camp, LaBoeuf had slid down on his blanket and covered his eyes with his hat. I was very glad for it. I was uncommonly chipper the next day, though I refused to believe it some rosy afterglow of the night before. LaBoeuf assured me we were nearing Buccee's Trading Post and I was right glad to be getting on with our pursuit. Also, the day was warm and lovely – the dark pines had given way to rolling hills carpeted with pink and blue wildflowers as far as the eyes could see and the air was filled with birdsong. It was quite unlike anything I had ever seen. I threw back my cloak and hat against the warmth and LaBoeuf rode comfortably in his faded blue linen shirt. \"You do indeed hail from a beautiful country.\" I conceded to LaBoeuf. He near fell from his horse from the compliment. I did regret it though after an endless tirade in which he praised his beloved state, even through us stopping past midday to stretch our legs and water the horses. \"And in the hills to the west run waters as clear as those in Eden itself, cold and refreshing, so full of fish a man has but to dip in his net down in the water-\" \"Have you heard anything of Rooster, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" I asked, searching for a change of subject before I said something downright ugly. I squatted down at the creek's edge to fill my canteen. After a few moments of silence I glanced up at LaBoeuf to see if he heard me. He was standing next to me, looking down with a pout on his face that would challenge Victoria in its absurdity. Silence stretched on but for the chuffing noises of the horses in the grass nearby and the happy trickling of the creek. Somewhere nearby a woodpecker assaulted a tree in search of bugs. \"I asked if you heard tell of Rooster.\" I repeated. He turned from me slightly and fiddled with removing his gloves. \"And there she said it again!\" He mumbled sullenly, raising his eyebrows in disdain. I confess now that my eyes did linger a moment on the slight downturn of his lower lip. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" I prodded. His blue eyes shot me an exasperated look when I spoke. \"You would call on that old codger with such familiar appellation but continue to use the utmost decorum with me!\" He grumbled, pulling out his canteen roughly and stooping to fill it. \"I have taken for granted the thought that we were friends.\" After a moment of dissecting his statement I felt a smile tug at my mouth. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" I scolded, \"Why, you are acting like a petulant child! All because I called our old pard Rooster by his common name?\" I couldn't help but goad him on. He whipped up to his feet quickly and swung his head around towards me so fast his hat slipped off. I caught it just before it fell into the water. His cowlick stood up from his head like a crown, making him look even more like a sulky little boy than before. I had to cover my face with his hat to hide my laughter at the very thought. \"And now you make me the object of your fun!\" He cried indignantly, roughly pulling his hat away from my face and causing me to stumble. Suddenly I found myself pulled up against him, one arm wrapped securely around my waist, his other and mine both still holding his hat. My laugh caught in my throat as his breath washed over me and felt the quick rise and fall of his chest against mine. \"Mr. LaBoeuf…\" I said breathlessly. He gave me a stern look and I feared another wholloping with his hat brim. \"I call you thus because you never asked me to call you otherwise.\" I finished quickly, pulling his hat from his grasp and plunking it securely on his head. His cheeks flushed and I leaned back to relieve myself from his grip but he held me fast. \"You may let go, I am in no danger of falling.\" I scolded; pushing my hand gently against his chest, for my heart was truly not in the action. \"Are you not?\" His voice was barely above a whisper and his face had taken on that same soft look again. \"Mattie, I'm asking you to call me by my name.\" \"No.\" I shook my head. \"We are business partners in this venture and should treat each other as such. Now unhand me.\" The hurt that crossed his face pained me. Still he did not relent, only pulled me tighter. \"Very well. Then when we are in town or other such places, you may call me LaBoeuf. But, when we are on the trail with no one but each other for company, it's Mattie and Samuel.\" I could see he was going to be a bulldog on the subject and I was relishing the feel of his arm around me more than I wanted to admit and longed to be free of it. \"As you wish.\" I said. He gave me a chastising look and I sighed. \"As you wish, Samuel.\" He watched my mouth as his name left my lips and my voice softened as I said it, such as one who reveals a great secret. \"I said once I thought to steal a kiss from you.\" He said, his brow creasing slightly in reflection. I felt his free hand traveling up my arm. A nervous flutter erupted in my stomach. \"You decided I was too young and unattractive, as I recall.\" \"I believe I have changed my mind to that respect.\" His fingers were on my neck, and he brushed my cheek with his calloused thumb. My eyes closed as his lips sought mine. I have been kissed before, only twice, but enough for sufficient knowledge that this kiss felt much different than anything I had felt before. His kiss was gentle, seeking and slow, yet I could feel him shaking with restraint and his heart pounded fiercely beneath my palm. He kissed me once, twice, three times then pulled my face closer to his and kissed me again, a bit rougher this time, his whiskers pleasantly scratching my chin and lip. When he pulled away and his blue eyes opened to mine. I felt as though I could both melt into his arms and run away in terror at once from the way he looked at me, both tenderly but with a wolfish hunger. \"You have many looks, Mattie, but I believe this could be my very favorite.\" He said, a smug smile beginning to form on his lips. \"And just what look would that be?\" I said, pleased to hear some vinegar back in my voice. \"Looking very thoroughly kissed. By me.\" He added pompously. \"I suppose I should look kissed.\" I conceded. \"Though how thoroughly is a completely debatable point.\" He started to protest and I covered his lips with mine to silence them. I could tell already I would need the Lord's help in practicing moderation with this man so I pulled away quickly and twirled out of his grasp while he was distracted. \"We are wasting precious time here, Samuel.\" I said fetching the horses. \"If your curiosity has been satisfied, I suggest we move on to Buccee's before the daylight fades and see what information we can gather therein.\" He frowned at me, a little of the pout still left in his mouth. I looked at him expectantly, waiting for a \"leg-up\" next to my horse. He sighed and shook his head before yielding and coming up behind me. He placed his hands on my hips and leaned over me, kissing me softly on the neck. Icy fingers tickled my back and I turned to glower at him. \"My curiosity has not been satisfied,\" he said, kissing me again just below my ear, \"but you are right… for now.\" Then he hoisted me up on Spookie and I set out in her rough jarring trot so he would not be privy to the grin that crossed my face. We did not make it to Buccee's Post that day, forcing us to set up camp once again. LaBoeuf, Samuel , promised we would arrive first thing in the morning. He spoke little after our encounter by the creek and one would almost say he looked quite troubled by it. The silence was welcome by me to allow me also the opportunity to mull over what had happened. He asked me to call him by his Christian name. Samuel. I turned the name over in my mind. He was the first person besides family I had ever called by their first name. Not only did he ask me, but he seemed so desirous of it, as though he craved the intimacy of it. Then there was the kiss…. I shivered involuntarily again as I replayed it again in my mind. The feel of his soft lips and rough chin on my neck would not leave me soon. So what did it mean? I did not know LaBoeuf to be a man given to flights of fancy and false passions… Then again how much did I truly know of him at all? I stole a glance at him across our little campfire. His brown was creased and his eyes trained firmly on the ground as he ruminated on something seemingly unpleasant. Could it be he regretted his actions? My heart gave a little turn at the thought. I lived to rationalize, to understand and to sort away, but these feelings refused to be classified. \"Mattie.\" He finally spoke, after our dinner had been put away and there was nothing to do but wait for weariness to turn to sleep. \"Yes, Samuel?\" A ghost of a smile drifted across his lips at the mention of his name. Still he did not look my way. \"I behaved wrongly today. I have been castigating myself for it since. It was insalubrious and improper of me to steal a kiss from you when you have already put your trust in me to behave as a gentleman and respect your virtue on the venture. I do not expect it, but I do ask for your forgiveness.\" I stared at him in the firelight as my stomach twisted in a knot. He did regret it. He does not care one whit for me beyond a friend, but was merely caught in the moment, unable to resist the beastly urges of man. Then why did he look so pained? For anyone as vain as he, admitting his nature as a man should not cause such distress. It took a while to find my words before I could utter them. I willed myself to rise to anger for him morally chastising himself while I could find no fault in it. I should be the one distressed and agitated, yet for all I should, I could find no sin. \"It is not stealing but what I freely gave.\" I finally stated. My voice was firm, challenging, finally causing him to look up sharply at me from his sullen reverie. \"You do not know what it is you say.\" \"When have you ever known that to be true of me?\" I asked, raising my eyebrow in question. I stood and moved to his side to keep his eye from avoiding me. \"Dad gummit Mattie do not make this any harder than it already is!\" He glowered at me then. \"It was wrong of me to kiss you. It will not happen again. Goodnight.\" With that he flopped on his side to be rid of the sight of me. We neither slept very much that night. Buccee's for being so seemingly famous was not exactly what I expected. It squatted, brown and ugly, like a blemish amongst rolling hills and oak trees verdant with spring. It was a hodgepodge of a building that had been hastily added to over the years pieced together by mismatched and rusted tin. A crooked, peeling sign declared \"Buccees\" was off center above the front porch. It was however bustling with business it seemed, though where the patrons came from I did not know - Texans must spring straight from the trees and rocks in this part of the country. As we neared I could see several men loitering about in the shade of the front porch. \"Now you let me handle the interrogation.\" LeBoeuf warned as we dismounted outside the rickety log store. I looked up at him innocently. \"I would never dream of overstepping your authority, Mr. LaBoeuf .\" I said with mock-sweetness. He snorted, but his face spoke of his seriousness as he eyed the men watching us from the front porch. He reached around me then, pulling my cloak back up over my shoulders and pulling it tight over my chest, his big hands clenched under my chin, drawing me towards him slightly. \"You jest all you like with me, but keep that saucy little mouth of yours closed in there.\" His eyes lingered on my lips as he spoke and something in their clear blue depths made ice trickle down my back. He released me then, and put his hand lightly against my back as we walked. He had removed his own jacket, revealing the star pinned at his breast that winked in the sunlight. He tipped his hat at the men eyeing us warily. A man's voice could be heard bartering from within before they even crossed the threshold. It was gravelly and good-natured. We weaved their way through an array of dry goods to the counter in the back where an older, round bellied man in a striped shirt and suspenders worked. His hair was white as snow and ringed his head like a halo, meeting bushy white chops that nearly touched an equally bushy white moustache. He had a rather bulbous red nose and liver spots on his hands. I liked him immediately. \"Well Tom you drive a hard bargain but I guess that is fair enough!\" He chuckled, handing the man at the counter a sack of goods. \"Thank ya, Buc.\" The man rumbled and stepped out of their way. \"Well I'll be damned!\" He roared as he slapped his big palm against the glass countertop. \"If it isn't my favorite lawman!\" \"Good to see you, Buc.\" LeBoeuf graced him with a wide grin as he grasped his hand warmly. The man I guessed was Buck Walters, as LeBoeuf did not seem to have the good manners to introduce us, turned his bright green gaze full on me. \"Well looky here!\" He grinned, slapping LaBoeuf hard on the shoulder as men tend to do in their camaraderie. \"You told me you'd never bring the Misses around to see me, you old dog!\" He cried as he gave me a good look over. \"She's a right pretty little thing! I always did like big brown eyes.\" \"I am no thing , sir, nor am I anyone's Misses .\" I replied tartly, turning my eyes to LaBoeuf to aid me. I was surprised to see him visibly pale, a bead of sweat breaking out on his brow. \"Buc!\" He cried. \"This is Ms. Mattie Ross .\" He emphasized my last name. I furrowed my brow as warning bells sounded off in my head. Mr. Walter's looked equally confused. \"Now Samuel, I though you said your wife's name was Elizabeth?\" LeBoeuf was positively stricken then. He gave Mr. Walter's a hard look but did not dare look my way. Mr. Walter's finally got the hint and began fidgeting, stammering awkwardly. \"Oh! Well… then…\" Suddenly I felt as though I had stumbled onto shifting sands. LaBoeuf was a married man. Ok, I am a native Texan and I'm pretty sure there's no way you can ride from Waco to Seguin in two days. I tried to add more to make up for it but it was coming out so very forced that I gave up. So! Just pretend they have reeeeally fast horses or something! Next update soon! ","Summary":" Prologue People do not give it credence that a fourteen-year-old girl could leave home and go off i"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"The Red Road","Author":"MissScaryKitty","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6766887","Passage":"[Chapter 1] The Red Road As I rode past the crow-pecked bodies in the field I wondered why they were there and why they deserved to be lying face down in the dirt all contorted and flesh-torn. Pinching my tired eyes shut, I stopped my horse to let my eyes adjust in the darkness. The waning moon had slipped behind the clouds putting the field in shadow. My count stopped at five men, all of whom were riding in the same direction. I have come across dozens men in my relatively short span of life who deserved the same fate- some of whom I delivered it to myself. In my opinion, no one's a sinner for setting those types of men straight. Looking out at the edge of the tree line, I waited until the white birches came clearly into my view and then I rode calmly on, fairly certain that I would pass through the field without harm. Twigs and frozen clods of dirt cracked beneath my horse's hooves as we followed the old Indian trail up the backside of the ridge. The cool air was tinged with strings of smoke that carried on the wind, the sweet smell alerting me to a nearby campsite. Judging by the freshness of the bodies below the ridge and the close proximity of the camp I took a guess that this was the group who dispatched my friends down in the valley. To avoid any misunderstandings I rode off of the trail, making a wide circle around the place where I figured the campsite to be. I didn't stop that night, occasionally dosing off in my saddle. I had my horse carry on past daybreak at a slow walk. It was tiring but I did it with an eye to pass the group of riders from last night and to avoid any chance of crossing their path along the trail. It was smarter this way; I've seen riders killed for nothing more than the biscuits in their satchel much less a horse, two pistols, one rifle, and a small sack of coins. It took me another four days to ride out of the Chawktaw Nation and cross the river into Yell County. The frost was beginning to come on heavy making it a lucky thing I made it out of the Indian territory in the time that I did. Securing a room in town was hard this time of year but it so happened that a train was pulling out that night for California, leaving some rooms open in the inn above the tack and feed store. My board was significantly lower than that of my horse's but I was too tired to argue a lower price with the bloated man at the front desk. Reaching my room, I found that the wick for the oil lamp was burnt to a charred nub so I dragged open the ratty curtains and used the lights from the street to illuminate the space. Rolling onto the lumpy bed, I closed my eyes and let sleep take me. The morning came quickly. It felt as if my eyes opened up only a minute after my head hit the pillow. The yellow sunlight hit my face from the open window as it peeked over the tops of the roofs; the color of it's' rays were warm but the air was cold and wet. Beads of water sat on the waxed window sill even though it didn't rain last night. The tops of my sheets were cold and damp to the touch. That's when I decided that what felt good last night was not the same conclusion in the morning. Rubbing the sleep from my eyes, I got a feel of my ice cold nose and cheeks. If I didn't get sick, it would be a miracle. There was nothing for it now but to shut the window and burry myself under the covers. Doing just that, I fell asleep for another hour before pushing myself downstairs and out the door. I knew where to find who I was looking for, no inquiry needed. Rooster Cogburn lived in the back of an old Chinese market among the ducks and curry powders, never able to afford a real room. He kept a full stock of liquor on hand however, even though most of it was confiscated and not bought himself. I hoped that the morning gave him enough time to sober up. The last time I talked to him when he was in the middle of one of his binges, it did not end well. AN: Hope you enjoyed it thus far. Let me know what you think.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 A chain of brass bells clanked over my head as I pushed open the door to the Chinese grocery. The potent smell of ginger and other spices washed over me as I entered. I walked in between isles and rows of crates filled with strange roots and vegetables until I reached the back of the shop where the owner was lazily wiping down the countertop. He looked up at me through his tired eyes expectantly, waiting for me to speak. I ran a hand through my hair, my fingers catching on some tangles. \"I know you may not remember me, but I need to see Marshal Cogburn.\" The man's chapped lips thinned out into an odd grin as he nodded to himself. \"I remember you enough to know that Mister Cogburn will not be happy to see you. Come, he's back here.\" The Chinese man led me around the counter and into the storeroom where a large, long-john-wearing lump of flesh, slept cradled in an old rope bed. I was assuming that this was the marshal. He looked like a sorry excuse. Wordlessly pointing to the older man in the bed, the Chinese grocer turned and left, leaving me alone with the marshal. \"Marshal Cogburn.\" I called, stepping closer to him. My mud swathed boots made the floorboards creak beneath my steps but nothing made them groan louder than when the Marshal stirred in his bed. \"Who is it?\" He asked, lazily turning over and wiping the sleep from his eyes. His gravelly voice was accentuated by his current weariness. A smirk tugged at my lips as I looked down at him. I always preferred starting out a conversation already having the upper hand and the marshal's tiredness granted me that. \"Don't you recognize my voice?\" I asked, patiently waiting for him to spot me at the foot of the bed. Once Cogburn caught sight of my face, he was very much awake. He hadn't seen me for about two years and I'm sure he wasn't ever expecting to see me again. Regardless, it felt like it had been less time than what it really had been. He still seemed like the same old marshal and I hadn't changed much myself. \"Miss Rachel M. Burns,\" he greeted me, an amused grin playing at the corners of his lips. I didn't get the feeling from him that this reunion was a pleasant surprise. Luckily for him the feeling was mutual. \"I should have recognized the accent… pure West Virginia.\" I nodded, coming around to the side of the bed. Cogburn ran his fingers through his messy, sweat-slick hair and carefully began to sit up. I knew the wound in his side had slowed him down a bit so I didn't make a crack at his age. Even so, he looked better than some men but then that wasn't saying much at all. I'm sure he noted my appearance as well; scuffed and dirty boots, thick two-layered dress, and unkempt hair. All of this, plus the absence of a wedding ring or a widow's frock, told him that I was still roaming the Indian territories, never having settled down and become a lady. \"I came across your handy work while crossing through the Chawktaw Nation about a week ago,\" I told him. I watched as he carefully swung his legs, one after the other, over the side of the bed frame. I was trying to assess his health by simply observing his movements. \"You get paid good for that job?\" \"Good enough,\" He said, looking up at me from his seated position. He knew I wanted something. If my visit alone wasn't telling enough, the course of this conversation certainly was. I folded my arms across my chest for warmth and took a seat on a stack of crates across from him. \"Good enough to forget about goin' after Charlie Lambton and his boys?\" I asked, relaxing my back against a large sack of soy beans. Now I was getting down to business. Cogburn snorted in response to my hopeful question as he began to pull on a pair of pants he had grabbed from the sawed-off bedpost. \"It's never that good. Besides we have old history Lambton and me.\" I nodded, seeing that this was going to go the typical rout of all our dealings. \"You have old history with everyone Rooster.\" I said, leaning forward in my seat. Cogburn's eyes locked with mine then if only for the briefest of moments before he continued to get dressed. \"How's about you let this one go to me and you can heal your bullet wound?\" \"How'd you hear about that?\" He asked, pulling on his shirt and buttoning it up. I merely shrugged, \"S'all over town… and you winced slightly when grabbing for your pants.\" Cogburn got a chuckle from that. In all honesty I wouldn't have known a thing about his injury if it weren't for the Ross girl getting snake bit and her arm amputated. People tend to talk about things like that. Also a story about one man riding against five isn't something that keeps quiet either. I tilted my head slightly, trying to imagine him riding against five men. What a sight that would have been, I thought to myself. I had seen the aftermath of the scene myself just some hours after it happened. Even though it irked me to have to admit it, that ranger and him did an impressive job. Then again one could have probably chalked the feat up to Cogburn's stubbornness… or his boldness depending on his alcohol intake. \"I'm actually surprised you survived it,\" I told him, watching him pull his boots on. The marshal shrugged. \"Well I'm fine now,\" He said standing up from the bed straight and tall to prove his claim. I could tell it hurt him but I didn't say anything; I didn't need to be getting into an argument with him. Cogburn slipped his suspenders on and tucked his shirt into his pants. Then he began to button up and straighten everything out. \"So you're still goin' after him, injury or not?\" I asked, slipping off my stack of crates and approaching him. Cogburn grabbed up his coat and gave me a sort glance as he pulled it on. \"Yeah, I'm goin' after him.\" I nodded, \"Right, well that doesn't exactly put us in a good position then.\" AN: Hey everyone. Glad you seem interested in my story. I hope it continues to please. Please drop a line and let me know what you think.[Chapter 3] Chapter 3 \"So you're still goin' after him, injury or not?\" I asked, slipping off my stack of crates and approaching him. Cogburn grabbed up his coat and gave me a short glance as he pulled it on. \"Yeah, I'm goin' after him.\" I nodded, \"Right, well that doesn't exactly put us in a good position then.\" \"What position is that?\" He asked, rolling himself a cigarette and lighting up. Smartly blowing the strings of smoke away from my direction, I crossed my arms over my chest and leaned my against a support beam, \"One where we both find ourselves gunnin' for the same man.\" My words took a moment for him to register then he laughed, \"You're going after Lambton?\" I nodded, pushing another curl of smoke away from me with my hand. \"Yes I am Marshal; don't see the humor in it.\" Cogburn shook his head with a grin and took another drag of his cigarette, \"Ain't no humor, just foolishness.\" \"I've brought in criminals before Cogburn.\" I reminded him. He knew damn well what I was capable of but I suppose he found some enjoyment in performing the old dance. In the end it didn't really matter, I had a rough idea where this conversation was going and it wasn't pretty. Cogburn took his cigarette from his lips and regarded me with a serious glance, \"You know no one here is going to pay a woman to do the job.\" \"And you know no one's going to hire an infirmed man either,\" I shot back. \"Infirmed?\" He grunted, taken somewhat aback. I couldn't help but get a bit of a grin out of his reaction, \"Yes infirmed- a bullet wound only a week into healing counts as infirmed Marshal. You're not tracking down anyone for the next month except a doctor.\" Cogburn grunted again and took another long drag of his cigarette. I could tell I had gotten him riled up now. My words held some bite because they were the truth- he was indeed old and injured. Cogburn would be a fool to think that he could best a gang of men in the condition he was in; especially since he was planning on doing it alone. He turned to his rope bed and reached for his wide-brimmed hat that was resting on one of the shelves above him. Putting it on, he turned back to me. His eyes brushed over my appearance and then fell on my gaze. \"Miss Burns,\" He sighed. \"My suggestion is that you let this idea of bringing in Charlie Lambton go. You may have made a name for yourself among the Indian tribes where you were the only form of justice they could get but no white man is going to want a woman bringing in their man.\" \"And what choice would they have if I just showed up with him?\" Cogburn chuckled, \"Well, they'd probably give you the minimum payment, if that. It's not enough to survive on without a reward attached to it.\" Unfortunately Cogburn had a point. It was one that I knew all along but didn't care to give much thought to until now. Money, although a factor of definite importance, was not the main reason why I was taking on this chase. Something inside of me just wanted to go after this criminal. But to get no reward money for the job would be a fruitless venture and Cogburn knew that. Without the money, I was dead in the water. Still, that drive I felt could not be chased away so easily. The marshal saw the wheels turning in my head. \"It isn't worth the effort.\" He told me, dropping the stub of his cigarette to the ground and snuffing it out with his boot. \"Look, if you plan on coming back to society, my suggestion is that you get married.\" Truth be told, this had almost set me off but I held back as best as I could. I tried to let my anger settle in me before answering him. \"I'm twenty nine Cogburn with no money, no land, and no family to recommend me. I've killed people without blinking an eye- you've seen that firsthand. You know what I'm capable of. No respectable man wants the kind of woman that I am for a wife. The time for marriage is long gone.\" AN: Sorry I have been away. Hope all of you like this. Thank you for reading and please let me know what you think.[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 Cogburn put his satchel over his shoulder, now paying me no mind. My breathing had thinned out from holding in my anger. It wasn't often that I'd lose ground in a fight but Cogburn and I were good at pushing one another to the brink of a shouting match and then some. However, I would very much like to avoid one and I'm sure he would too; it didn't make for a pretty sight. I wiped the palms of my sweaty hands against my skirt as I conveniently put myself between him and the door, \"You know I'm not going to give up on this marshal. I'm going after this one no matter what you do to convince me otherwise.\" \"You've been chasin' down the same man your whole life.\" He sighed, taking the last drag of his cigarette and dropping it to the ground. \"Lambton ain't him and no criminal you take in is ever gonna be.\" I fixed my sharp gaze on the marshal as his pressed out the smoking butt of his cigarette with the sole of his boot. My eyes were lit with anger as I chewed over what he had just said to me. I couldn't quite believe that he'd step into this territory but he did. \"What do you mean by that?\" My tone warned him of the dangers of him continuing down the road he was on. I tried to remain in control of my temper but it was hitting a dangerous level and when it broke there was no turning back. Cogburn regarded me with a stern look, letting me know he was not joking around anymore. \"You know what I mean.\" I certainly did and I wasn't going to stand for it for one moment longer. \"Listen here Cogburn; my daddy died the moment I pulled that trigger and he stayed dead. I make the path of my life, not him. Charlie Lambton is just another man in a long line of criminals I'll have put to rest. So quit this bullshit about my father and think of something else to say because what you're tryin' to do now ain't working.\" There was a moment of silence were the tension hung thick on the air. I wished that I hadn't yelled but he knew not to bring up my father. \"I got nothing else.\" Cogburn finally spoke. \"You're going to do what you're going to do- just thought I'd warn you against it first.\" \"I don't need a warning marshal.\" I told him curtly, trying my best not to let my temper resurface. Pulling my shawl around me I made my way to the door. I was done here as far as I was concerned. \"I guess I'll be seeing you.\" I was halfway out the door when Cogburn asked, \"When are you riding out?\" \"Within the week, but it doesn't really matter since you're not going.\" I gave him a bit of a smirk before turning and leaving the storeroom. AN: Yay, some back history. More will be revealed in later chapters. Hope you all like this piece. Drop me a line or two and let me know what you think.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 I wandered through the town quietly, my wool shawl wrapped snugly around my shoulders. I had my pants on under my skirts for extra warmth. It had snowed last night and the wet cold only agitated my nose and throat. Despite the discomfort, I was in a peaceful mood. I was leaving for the Indian Nation in two days and there was nothing to do but rest and gather supplies for the journey to the Plains tribe. They knew me well and would welcome me to stay with them for a few days. The icy streets were barren; the congregation gathered in the church for Sunday service. I heard the soft strings of Amazing Grace coming from the white church house. Looking at the heavy double doors, I briefly I wondered if Cogburn attended… what a notion. Still, a person's opinion of a man says very little about the man himself; I've met murderers who were God-fearing men. They said their prayers every night and went to church on Sundays somehow convinced that they'd still be saved. In life one learns that it takes all types. I myself never attended church nor do I plan on starting. The prayers and hymns most people memorized by heart were only pretty words and sweet music to me. I wasn't above any of it; I just wasn't a part of it. To most people church was a habit and growing up as I did it never became a habit for me. Besides, I don't think these people would welcome me to pray with them anyways. They were a queer kind of folk who stuck amongst themselves. Outsiders like myself weren't welcome. I gently kicked a few frozen clods of dirt from my path as I made my way down the main street. No one was going to open up their shops until church let out so I minded my own business for a while and took in the scenery. Cogburn was nowhere in sight and I hoped he stayed behind in his little rope bed with his whiskey bottle. Gathering up my heavy skirts in one hand, I climbed the stairs onto the porch of the tack and feed shop, sat down on the wooden bench next to the door and waited for the owner to come from the church house. The weather was beginning to turn bitter cold but I made no complaint. Once the bell tolled, the congregation began leaving the white building. A stout white haired man who I assumed was the owner of the shop moseyed up the stairs and fished in his pocket for his keys. He glanced down at me on the bench, his eyes straying to the hems of my pant legs that were poking out from under my skirts and then entered the shop. He did this in silence and total complacency. Knowing that I wasn't going to get any sort of a welcome, I followed him inside shortly. We negotiated on a price for some supplies and it was little surprise that the man was hard on bargaining with unfamiliar faces. I suppose he figured that he could get away with pinching out a higher price for goods with the non-locals. However I was very familiar with this territory and others beyond it so I knew the prices and the worth of things. All in all I came out on top in the deal but it was hardly worth the argument it took to get there. My next stop was to get a drink at the bar to warm me up and quell my increasing headache. Little did I know women weren't allowed in. Still, I paid it no mind and entered. After all I was not from these parts and things were done differently in different counties. A quick explanation on my part would set the men inside straight. Later I would regret my bold as brass decision. How did the old saying go?- when you go looking for trouble, you always find it. AN: Hope you all enjoyed, things get a bit exciting in the next chapter! PLEASE REVIEW!

The picture depicted a girl with a neat tan and long dark hair that she had draped over one shoulder and held by a golden band around the middle. \"Gia Daniels. She was on the launch with Ender. According to her scores, she's ruthless, aggressive, strategic, precise, if a little impulsive. But she has the second best scores behind Ender himself.\" \"Why was she not brought to my attention?\" Graff demanded. \"She's wiping the floor with the rest of the teams, even Dragon.\" \"Maybe you were so concerned with Ender, you didn't notice.\" Anderson said nonchalantly. \"When is her next battle?\" \"Tomorrow, with the Rat army. Should be an easy win.\" \"Yeah, no kidding. Be here tomorrow for it. Has she been evaluated?\" \"She's clean.\" \"Hmm.\" The alarm sounded and Gia swore as she swung herself out of bed. She quickly got dressed in her battle suit, leaving the front unzipped and carrying her helmet under one arm. She walked around the corner to her squad's barracks and screamed, \"Let's go, Hyenas, battle in 15 minutes! Move it!\" The squad leaped into action and were ready to go in 10. She lead them down to the battle room and waited for the door to open. \"Form a tank, Kane in the middle. Jake, Max, Liam, get ready to lead a rush. Tom, Dirk, Oz, I want you as snipers. Take them out from a distance. Eveyrbody, wait for my signal.\" Gia commanded. The doors opened, slowly and revealed the battle room to the Hyena army. The Rat army were just leaping into the room when Gia gave the command. The hyenas rushed forward. The snipers remained at the door entrance while Jake, Max and Liam immediately launched themselves forward as fast as they could straight through the battle room, followed by the tank which moved at a much slower pace. Gia herself, rode on top of the tank and picked off any she could spot. The Rat army was incredibly disorganized, with no formation or obvious tactic, just firing in any direction. The victory felt like nothing when the tank passed through the enemy door. She didn't even get hit. Victory:Hyena Army \"That's some damn good leading.\" said Graff. \"Indeed, but the Rat army hasn't won a battle in years. It's hardly a great victory.\" Said Anderson. \"Play recordings of her other battles.\" The Major did so , and her earlier description of Gia was correct. She was one helluva commander. \"Using the rush to distract the enemy and the tank as the manpower to win and the snipers as a failsafe. I like this kid.\" \"So, what are you thinking sir?\" Anderson asked. \"I'm thinking we should put Gia and Enders in the same room, see how they react to each other. Bring Ender to the battle room and send word for Gia to stay there. Imagine if the two of them joined forces. It would be hell.\"[Chapter 2] A/N: Hello Everyone, I have decided that since I have so many stories and ideas for more, that I'll update the stories by category and/or by whichever story has the most reviews. For reviews, I would love detailed feedback on the stories, what you liked, what you didn't like, what you didn't understand, etc. You get the drift. I'm really sorry for the stories that haven't been updated in a while. I just finished with honors chemistry and it was kicking my ass. So sorry, I'll try to do better with the updates. Thanks![Chapter 3] Gia watched her army depart, several of them glancing back at her, their confused expressions mirroring her own. The doors of the battle room were still open. She looked inside, but saw nothing. Then the enemy doors opened and a single person leaped through. He was cautious, clearly confused as well. She recognized him as Ender, Graff's supposed prodigy. \"Hello?\" \"Ender.\" She said as she leaped back into the room and made her way toward him. \"Gia. Why are we here?\" \"I don't know, I'm just as confused as you are.\" She looked around. \"I don't like this.\" The doors suddenly opened, startling both army commanders. Then they spotted the green battle suits. The Salamander Army, with Bonzo in the lead. \"Come on out, Wiggins!\" Bonzo roared. Gia and Ender quickly hid behind one of the floating obstacles. \"This must be a test.\" Ender surmised. \"What kind of test is this?\" Gia hissed. \"We don't even have our blasters!\" She suddenly grinned making Ender look at her funny. \"Guess we have to take them. Who's the best shooters in the Salamander Army?\" \"Petra is the best by far.\" \"Then we take her out first. Distract Bonzo for me, will ya?\" She didn't wait for him to agree before making her way through the battle room as stealthily as possible. She easily spotted Petra, scouting the perimeter of the Battle Room with some other guy who hadn't even bothered to unsheath his blaster. Bonzo's yelling told her that Ender had his attention. Petra and the other guy turned as well and she attacked. She quickly grabbed the guy's blaster and used his body as a shield as Petra fired at her. She fired back and hit Petra in the chest before snatching her blaster and using her body as a launchpad, launched herself away from them and towards Ender. SHe stayed beneath the obstacles, choosing precise moments to pick off a few of the Salamanders, but by then Bonzo had wised up and called them back into formation. As they fell to command she launched herself at him, interlocking her body with his and using it as a shield as she fired on the rest of the Salamander Army. Ender assisted with a stolen blaster and soon the pair was floating towards the enemy battle platform. They walked through and an alarm sounded. \"That was pretty amazing.\" Ender said as he removed his helmet. \"You were fantastic.\" She shrugged. \"Sorry, I didn't give you any time to come up with a plan. I like to act quickly, you know strike before the enemy does.\" \"A sound theory.\" Ender smiled. She returned it as she removed her own helmet. The doors opened and Graff stepped through. They quickly snapped to attention. \"At ease, Commanders. I was very impressed with your win this afternoon.\" \"Thank you, Sir.\" They said in unison. \"But Ender was right. It was a test. Very good thinking, Commander Daniels. Excellent teamwork from the both of you. Expect tougher challenges in the Battle Room for both of your armies from now on. You are dismissed.\" Gia and Ender saluted and left. \"That was strange.\" Ender commented as they walked back to the squad rooms. \"Yeah, I wonder why we're being tested.\" Gia agreed. \"See you at lunch, Ender.\" \"See you, Gia.\" Gia walked into the commander's room and changed out of her battle suit before rejoining the rest of her army who immediately assaulted her with questions. She simply retold what happened in the battle room. \"Tougher challenges?\" Liam, her second, a scruffy dark haired boy said as he got off of his bed. \"Why do we need tougher challenges?\" \"Because we're the best.\" Oz chimed in with a grin. \"Finally, we get some competition!\" The rest of the army added in their own cheers of agreement. \"Now, we can earn our victories. Not even Dragon or Salamander can hold a candle to the Hyena Army!\" The Army cheered again and Gia laughed. \"Alright, cool it guys. You know tougher challenges means more work and more training. Not slacking like the Rat squad. File out to lunch.\" She took up the rear as they headed down to the lunch room. \"Gia!\" She stopped just before entering and turned to see Bonzo and the Salamander Army arrive. Bonzo motioned for his squad to go in before pulling her over to the side. \"I just wanted to say, congratulations on both of your victories today.\" Gia narrowed her eyes. \"Really? And what happened to the real Bonzo, was he replaced with a guy who was less of a jackass?\" Bonzo grinned. \"I guess I deserve that. I am not a clone or a robot. but I do know when I have been beat. You were pretty amazing today.\" \"Thank you. You would've been better if you didn't let your rivalry with Ender cloud your judgement, Commander.\" He scoffed. \"Rivalry? Really? Okay. Anyways, you were a great warrior today.\" \"Thank you. You weren't so bad yourself, taking all those shots for me.\" She grinned. He grinned back. \"You're welcome. Hey, maybe we can train sometime, sit together at lunch-\" She held up her hand to stop him. \"Perhaps, when the Salamander Army beats the Dragon Army.\" His eyes narrowed this time. \"You are a great commander, Bonzo. You earned your place as commander, now…\" She leaned in close to him and smirked. \"Show me why.\" Please Review!

She was one of the best veterans that had been placed Dragon Army, and was one of only a few females. Ender immediately took in her nametag, which said \"VELA\" next to the dot matrix that indicated her rank. He had remembered seeing her name fairly high in the standings, but had assumed she was male. \"What is it?\" he asked her briskly. He had no time for pleasantries, but she had requested a private meeting with her commander. He was rule-bound to oblige her. \"Look, I just wanted to let you know that you don't know this army yet. I know most of the vets. They either from my launch group or the one right after. They know me. They know I be good.\" She drew out the last word. Her language was slipping into the soldier's slangy way of talking, the tone most would never dare take with their commander. \"They don't care I'm a girl. I showed 'em quick that it don't matter who you are or where you from, you can be damn good.\" \"You perform as well as you talk and we'll see about getting you a toon,\" Ender said. It was the same response he'd given Bean just that morning. \"Now get to class.\" He pushed past her and walked back into the bunks. She followed him at a respectful distance, head held high to show that there had been no argument. She was taller than most of the others, having been brought to the school a year later than most at fourteen. Besides that, she was not a sharpshooter like a certain someone that had gone into space with her that had already befriended the prodigal commander. Constantly overlooked, she had grown used to being an outcast, unlike Petra who had fit right in, climbed the ranks almost as quickly as Ender. Everyone with them had assumed that as the only two girls in the group they would stick together, but as she was left in Petra's dust, people stopped thinking that soon enough. One of the younger boys bumped into her. He hadn't met her yet. \"Who are you, Stretchy?\" A nearby boy, also young and small, laughed sycophantically. \"Geddit, cos she's so tall and scrawny like she's been all stretched out! Ha!\" \"Name's Cole,\" she said, shoving the little bugger out of the way roughly. \"That's a boy's name!\" he called after her, hoping to get a last jab in as he rubbed his arm where it had hit a bed. \"It's a boy's school,\" Cole tossed over her shoulder. The rest of the army moved out of her way as she swung her lanky frame into her top bunk near the back of the room. They knew better than to mess with her. First time writing for Ender's Game, woo! This is basically going to be me ranting about how Petra shouldn't have had as big of a role in the film as she did…but it will be a lovely well-written story as well! Heh. Let the Anniversary Update Binge begin![Chapter 2] \"Dragon Army, stand at attention!\" Everyone bolted upright, some swinging down from the upper bunks. Ender continued shouting directions at them. Cole noticed that he was already in his flash suit, and she began suiting up as well, listening to what he was saying. \"We're on the morning schedule, straight to practice after breakfast. Officially, you have a free hour between breakfast and practice. We'll see what happens after I find out how good you are.\" A smaller kid near the front replied, \"That's not how the other commanders do it.\" \"I'm not like any other commander,\" Ender said quietly. Then he shouted, \"Dragon Army, fall out!\" A few of the army members hadn't finished getting dressed, as they complained when they were herded out the door. \"Dress faster next time,\" was all Ender said to them. \"Three minutes from first call to running out the door - that's the rule this week. Next week, the rule is two minutes,\" he told them as they ran to the Battle Room. When they got there, Ender had the undressed ones go to the back and finish getting their suits on while he gave directions. \"Jump up. Use the ceiling handholds to hurl yourself into the room. Assemble on the far wall, as if you were going for the enemy's gate. Move!\" Cole made sure that she was the first one to push off into the Battle Room. She was overconfident, though, and she swung in at an awkward angle, rebounding off the ceiling before hitting the wall she was aiming for. Cursing herself quietly in her helmet, she waited for the others to reach her. Ender was the last one out, gliding smoothly towards the clump of his army. \"Dragon Army! Why are you upside down?\" Cole was confused and slightly annoyed. He'd said to assemble on the far wall, and that's what they did. He said nothing about orientating themselves one particular way or another, the way she did when she was bored. \"I said, why are you upside down, soldiers? Why does every one of you have his feet in the air and his head towards the ground?\" Cole was about to shout out that there was no gravity and therefore no true down, but some idiot started talking first. \"Sir, this is the direction we were coming in out of the corridor.\" \"Well what difference is that going to make? Are we going to fight in the corridor? Is there any gravity here?\" \"No sir!\" the soldier responded. Cole rolled her eyes. Ender had said exactly what she was going to. We stayed the way we were because that's how we were instructed when we learned, but there is no gravity so it doesn't matter which way was down. \"From now on, you forget about gravity before you go through that door. The old gravity is gone, erased. Whatever your gravity is when you get to the door, remember...the enemy's gate is down.\" Oh. Now Cole knew where Ender was going with the gravity discussion. A new way of orientation would be a huge asset, and was sure to confuse the enemy's forces. Cole remembered how, in a battle of Rat and Scorpion, her old army, Dink Meeker had led his toon in a feet-first attack that confused everybody. Now she knew the thought process behind it...her mind spun, thinking of new formations and tactics they could use, and she missed Ender's next words but not the next instruction. \"Launch and form on the ceiling! Right now! Move!\" Turning and pushing off the wall that was now the floor, she headed back towards their own gate. The only person who reached it before her was the smallest soldier in the army, one that had been in Ender's launch group and was rumoured to be smarter than the prodigal son himself. Ender began a demonstration with freezing soldiers. He commanded five to move off the wall, and they just stared at him. He froze them quickly, and they got in the way of the remaining soldiers. The next five he called moved quickly, and were also frozen, but this time blocking up the invisible enemy lines. Cole began eyeing Ender more appreciatively. Apparently the people who sang his praises weren't all the nutters she had taken them for. She had a feeling that they would work very well together. Then Ender showed them a new way to attack. He bent his knees in front of himself and froze them. Cole watched, very interested. \"THIS is out attack position! Legs up, frozen, firing between our legs.\" He pushed off the wall. \"Which way is the enemy's gate?\" he shouted. At the silence that greeted him, everyone too focused on their bodies, he shouted louder, \"Is Bean the only one who knows? WHICH WAY IS THE ENEMY'S GATE?\" \"DOWN!\" A/N - This chapter's pretty short, and I leaned heavily on the book to provide correct quotes and settings and what have you since in the move we hardly saw Ender at Battle School or Dragon Army at all, and those were my favorite parts of the book! The story will be kind of a mixture of both the book and the movie, since most of what I'm writing about is stuff that I think should have happened in the movie and actually did happen in the book. If that makes any sense. Anyway, the support I've been getting for this story has been kind of amazing, way better than I had dared hope, so thank you soooo much and keep it up! :3[Chapter 3] \"Attention...the game room will close in 30 minutes. Repeating...final bell in 30 minutes.\" Cole glared up at the speaker. At the rate the two in front of her were going, she wasn't going to have enough time to face Petra that night. It had almost become a tradition; arrive at the game room, wait for ages, maybe get a turn against somebody else on the ship simulator. Usually after a little while, Cole was bored enough to move on and play a different game that was only one-player. Sometimes she played the mind game, but from what she'd heard from other people she was getting close to the Giant's Drink, which she then avoided at all costs. The one time she got there by accident, she immediately turned off her desk and stared at the ceiling, trying to forget what she'd seen. Cole knew she was supposed to be tougher than that, but for whatever reason, she just really hated the Giant. It reminded her too much of the family she had been all too glad to leave behind. But after the practice with Ender that morning, how it had made her feel, Cole stood her ground in line. She wanted to face Petra, maybe actually get to play a game against her. Petra was very good. She also firmly believed that the next commanders were scouted out from the game room. Cole knew that was a pile of kuso, but any chance to face Petra now that they were no longer Launchies and everything counted was too good to pass up. At the same time, though, there really was no point to staying if she wasn't going to get her turn. So Cole turned to leave. She wasn't sure what she was going to do when she got back to the bunks, but she didn't really care. She passed Ender and paused. Ender? What was her new commander doing in the game room? Cole leaned casually up against the wall like she was waiting for a turn by an unspecified game. If everyone assumed she was waiting for a game that wasn't theirs, everyone would also leave her alone. It looked like he was talking to Alai, his Launchy friend. \"You can try. I taught you everything you know. But I didn't teach you everything I know.\" Cole imagined the smirk on Ender's face as he said that and grinned herself. Of course he didn't. He was brilliant. \"I knew all along that you were holding something back, Ender,\" Alai responded. After a pause, Ender said, \"I wasn't, Alai. Holding anything back.\" Oh. Well that was a stupid move, Cole thought. Oh, right. They were the best of friends. Cole rolled her eyes when Alai said, \"I know. Neither was I.\" \"Ohhh-kay,\" Cole said to herself, standing up straight again and walking towards the door again. It was getting to be too touchy-feely in there. Cole didn't really enjoy dealing with any sort of feelings she couldn't control. Like love. Or pure hatred. Then Petra just appeared in her path. \"Gah.\" Cole stepped back, startled out of her thoughts. \"Sorry!\" Petra said. Cole gave her the best parody of a smile she could muster before saying, \"You know, Petra, you've got about the worst timing ever.\" Petra cocked her head. Jeez, she was so girly. \"Huh? Well, whatever. I just wanted to say congratulations!\" Cole raised an eyebrow. \"Why, dare I ask?\" \"Are you serious?\" Petra's mouth fell open. At Cole's decision to not dignify that with a response, Petra barrelled on. \"You are one of the few in Ender's army! You're kind of the elite...he is the best student here, and he's not even allowed to teach anyone not in his army!\" \"When did that happen?\" Cole asked. Ender's reputation wasn't just his intelligence. He held his special practices every night during free time in the Battle Room. \"Just recently,\" Petra replied. \"Colonel Anderson told him that Battle Room practices have to be scheduled and that you can only practice with members of your same army.\" Cole was still a little suspicious. It all sounded very specific, like Petra made it up. Cole didn't know why she would do that, but she just didn't trust Petra. \"How do you know all that?\" Petra shrugged. \"He told me right after it happened, just before coming here.\" \"Oh,\" Cole grumbled. \"Well, I'd like to head back to my bunk. I'm tired and we probably have at least one practice tomorrow.\" \"Okay.\" Petra headed off, hair swinging. She turned, making sure to flip her long hair fabulously. \"It was nice talking to you again!\" Cole grimaced at her retreating back. \"Yeah, heh heh, not really.\" Cole ran her fingers through her own short, blonde hair. She had wanted to fit in as best she could when she arrived, not to mention distance herself from Petra, who'd chosen to keep her hair long from the moment she arrived in Battle School. Cole's hair had stayed that short in the years since. Reflecting on it, she realized that she was only a little bit older than Ender, as was Petra. Cole had forgotten that they were both a year older than most of their launch group. Ender was brought up to the school when he was twelve, but it had only taken him one year to move up to Commander. Cole and Petra were brought up to the school at fourteen and were both on their way to being sixteen. That meant they were both under the leadership of someone three years their junior. Which wasn't really all that odd. It happened all the time on Earth. But things were supposedly different in Battle School. \"Ten minutes to lights out.\" Cole scowled at the speakers again and left the game room. A/N - Hi! I got really excited about this chapter for like no reason at all. Like it takes place over the course of twenty minutes. So...yeah, I don't know why this chapter made me really happy. But anyway...we see Cole finally meet Petra! I think that's cool...yeah? Anyway, it turns out I had this chapter written but I couldn't find it anywhere until I was looking at the story and realized I hadn't actually published it yet. So here it is. Also, thank you so much for the continued incredible support! This story is doing so much better than I ever could have dreamed and it's all because of you guys. :) I am sorry to say that I can't update until about June because I have a lot going on, but once I make it through the school year I will definitely be writing a lot. So again, I am truly sorry, but no more story for a while. ","Summary":" She pushed her hair out of her face, a decidedly feminine gesture. She was one of the best veterans"},{"Movie":"Ender's Game","Title":"Ender's Game One-Shots","Author":"Fan-Fiction-802","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9834339","Passage":"[Chapter 1] This one is set after Ender finds out that the simulation was real and was put unconscious. Petra and the rest of the Dragon Army watched as Ender lay motionless on his bed. Moments ago, they were celebrating over their graduation simulation win, but now? Celebrating was the last thing on everyone's mind. \"Let's let him rest,\" Said Bean, summoning everyone but Petra out of the room. She remained, staring at Ender. Slowly and silently, she crept over to his bed and sat next to his waist on it. \"I'm so sorry,\" She looked at Ender's closed eyelids, and gently ran her fingers down his chest. That course blue uniform remained on him. She thought about putting pajamas on him, but that'd be weird- wouldn't it? Besides, he'd only be asleep for a little while longer (or at least, that's what she hoped). Tears were stinging at Petra's eyes as she thought of what she knew. The whole Dragon Army knew, except for Ender. The whole fleet knew that it wasn't really a simulation, that everything they did- everyone they sacrificed- were real. Alai had wanted to tell Ender, but Colonel Graff insisted that not a single word was told to him. \"He's too obsessed with those aliens to take this seriously,\" He'd said, \"I love Ender like a son, I think he has true potential, but if I learned anything in this program it's that you can't show mercy,\" Petra grew a hatred for Colonel Graff that day, a hatred she couldn't forget. He wanted these children, some of them even younger than herself, to forget love, forget compassion, forget it all and just murder. The pit of Petra's stomach felt awkward and hurt. Maybe it was because she was deceiving Ender? Petra couldn't explain her feelings for Ender. Nobody could. It was these feelings, she felt, that caused Bonzo to die. She knew, the whole Salamander Army knew, that Bonzo loved her. Before Ender came along, Petra went along with Bonzo's lines and moves. He even abused Petra, but she thought it to be love. But once she met Ender, she felt real love, something she never felt with Bonzo. Petra understood what it was like to love, a feeling that'd been washed out of her since Battle Camp. Bonzo was jealous of Ender, he was jealous that Petra loved Ender and not him. If Petra hadn't loved Ender, Bonzo wouldn't have been jealous. If Bonzo wasn't jealous, he wouldn't hate Ender. If Bonzo hadn't hated Ender, he wouldn't have attacked him. If Bonzo hadn't attacked Ender, Ender wouldn't have fought back. If Ender hadn't fought back, Bonzo would be okay. So, in a crazy, twisted way, if Petra hadn't loved Ender, everyone would be safe and sound in Battle Camp. Somehow, to Petra, it was only logical to blame everything on herself. \"If it weren't for me, we wouldn't be here,\" Petra whispered, a cold tear running down her cheek. She stroked Ender's warm forehead, her hand running through his hair. She wanted to freeze time; to be with Ender like this forever. Here and now was a place where she could touch and hold young Ender and love him like she was meant to. He wouldn't even know. But the dark thoughts that caused Petra's tears told her not to wish that. They told her that Colonel Graff was right, that love isn't meant to be used in this battle. Love is a thing of the past now. \"I knew,\" Choked Petra. \"I knew the whole time. Graff told me it was real and I should have told you, Ender,\" Tears were now steadily flowing down Petra's cheeks. Ender's eyes flew open and he bolted upright. Petra retracted her hand so swiftly you'd have thought the boy's skin was poisonous. \" You knew? \" Ender narrowed his blue eyes at Petra, glaring at her. \"You let me murder and entire species?\" \"Ender, I-\" Petra had to make amends, but she was crying so hard she could barely speak. \"Don't try to give me an excuse!\" Yelled Ender, in that loud voice that clearly didn't match his small, fragile body. Ender got up from his bed, and so did Petra. \"Ender, please, just let me explain!\" Petra cried, standing in front of Ender to block him from leaving. Ender planted a finger on Petra's chest, saying \"You're despicable! I'd have expected this from Bonzo, not you!\" Petra let out a sob. Bonzo often treated her like this. In her mind, Ender's face morphed into Bonzo's. \"You don't keep secrets from your commander! You're off the Dragon Army!\" She heard Bonzo's voice in her ears. Here stands Petra, a strong, brave girl. But when it comes to her past with Bonzo, or her love for Ender, she breaks. Here stands Ender, a loving, yet tough boy. But when he's angry, he loses the compassion of his sister and gains the violence of his brother. Ender didn't think about Petra. He didn't think about how she was already a mess, how she didn't need more pain. He just knew he was mad, and an outlet for him was violence. With a loud SMACK! Petra was on the ground, unable to control her sobs. Ender looked down to her, an evil superior look in his eye. Ender Wiggin was a man to be feared.[Chapter 2] So in here Ender is 9, Valentine is 11, and Peter is 13. I'm unsure of the real age differences, those are just guesstimates. This is before Battle School or anything like that. Valentine was dining into what she thought was a perfect lunch: a turkey sandwich with mayonnaise, tomato, and lettuce, fresh orange juice, and a handful of baby carrots served with ranch dressing. Her two brothers, Ender and Peter, were upstairs. Valentine figured Peter was punching something and Ender was harmlessly playing with his toy cars. Valentine dipped a carrot into the dressing to bit it with a loud snap. Upstairs, however, things were different. Valentine was somewhat right, Ender was playing with his toy cars, but Peter was sitting on the couch next to him, watching TV. Peter hadn't had a violent outbreak in three days. Valentine figured it was a phase he'd outgrown, but the rest of the family knew that Peter was bottling up all his anger to release on a perfectly vulnerable target. I guess you couldn't really say that Ender was 'playing' with the cars. He was more analyzing their weight and aerodynamic ability than racing them. He was comparing his electric green car to his deep blue one. According to Ender's calculations, the blue one should win by half a second if they were going at the same speed. But, judging by the engine size, the green car could go two seconds faster, making it able to win by one and a half seconds. \"Watcha doin' there?\" Peter smirked, looking at Ender. \"Being a little nerd?\" Ender ignored him, he wasn't worth his time or brain power. Now back to that bulky side mirror... \"Hey, barfbag, I was talking to you,\" Peter snorted. Ignored again. \"Hey!\" Peter lunged forward and yanked Ender to him by his shirt collar. \"You listen to me when I talk to you.\" Valentine, who'd been using her keen hearing to detect any noise, didn't hear a thing and continued to eat. Peter released Ender, but he wasn't done yet. He picked up Ender's red car and started to examine it. \"Give it back,\" Ender said, very calm and collected. \"No,\" Peter scoffed and 'accidentally' snapped the car in half. Ender glared at Peter threateningly. \"Give. It. Back!\" Ender shouted, standing up. He clenched his fists, even though he knew he was no match for Peter. Peter lunged at Ender, knocking him down and punching his stomach repeatedly. This Valentine heard. She dropped her sandwich and flew upstairs, using all her might. \"Ender!\" She screeched, horrified at the sight. She darted forward and grabbed her older brother, throwing him off Ender. Peter pushed Valentine to the side with so incredible force. Valentine slammed into the wall, then stumbled forward and tripped. \"Valentine!\" Ender shouted. \"Peter, please, stop!\" Begged Ender. Valentine sat dazed on the floor, barely conscious from the blow. \"Make me,\" Peter snarled, an evi look in his eye. It was these moments that Valentine and Ender wondered- what happened? Why was Peter so violent, so evil? What Valentine hated the most was that Ender was becoming more and more like Peter. Sometimes it was little things, throwing a tantrum or breaking something, other times it was big, like fights in school. Peter again lunged at Ender, but this time to finish him off. Peter grabbed Ender's throat, making it impossible to breathe. His gasps for air brought Valentine back to Earth. She took a deep breath, debating what to do. If she didn't fight Peter, Ender would die. But she couldn't fight her own brother, she couldn't fight anybody. Valentine hates squishing flies, for Pete's sake! But Ender was more important than any promise Valentine could've made to herself. She charged at Peter, knocking him off Ender. \"Ender, run!\" She screamed, squirming as Peter pinned her to the floor with both hands. Valentine thought again, she'd have to hurt Peter in order to save herself and Ender. She had no choice. Closing her eyes tightly and taking a silent inhale, Valentine kneed Peter where it'd hurt. He fell to her side, eyes shut, biting his lip. Valentine stood and ran, escaping Peter for the time being.[Chapter 3] This is based off a request. It takes place in the Dragon Army Quarters. \"I grew up on the streets, not worth a bean, you know?\" Bean hated the streets. Battle Camp was a glorious escape for him. He grew up not knowing what a good meal was, or what a comfy bed was like. He clambered into bed, saying a quick goodnight to everyone in the Dragon Army Quarters. After a few minutes of straight thinking, he dozed off. Bean awoke, rock-hard concrete beneath him. He was in a familiar, yet somehow unfamiliar, place. There were red brick buildings, and a tattered, old street separating a few. The buildings seemed to be endless. No car passed by, no pedestrian walked. It was empty- except for Bean. He stood up and looked both ways down the street. Nobody. He ran to his left, using all his power. Yet after a few moments, he stopped. He was exaushted and out of breath. But how? Bean looked at his arm, which was all skin and bone. \"Bean! Dragon Army needs you!\" A voice called out, but there was no body it came from. It sounded like Ender, but where was he...? \"Sir, Petra's injured!\" Alai's voice reported urgently, but again, no body. \"I'm here!\" Bean yelled, but he wasn't sure who to yell to. \"It's too late,\" An evil voice snarled, and Bean saw zombie versions of Ender, Petra, and Alai emerge. Ender was missing an eye and and ear, Petra lost an entire arm, and Alai only had waist-up reamaining. Bean screamed and stumbled backward. The grotesque figures got closer and closer, rotting flesh hanging off them. Just as they were about to reach him, the whole place dissapeared. It was like a drawing that'd been erased, a sentence backspaced. It was just gone. Petra darted down the hall as fast as her feet could carry her. When she saw his sign, she stopped. 'Ender Wiggin, Dragon Army Fleet Admiral' was hammered onto the door. Petra pounded with all her might. \"What?\" Ender answered minutes later, looking tired and groggy. \"It's Bean,\" Both took off running down the hall, Ender tiredly tripping and veering from his path. When they reached the Dragon Army Quarters, Alai was gaping at Bean, who was sweating and flailing in his bed. \"What do we do?\" Alai asked urgently. Petra and Ender exchanged a glance. \"Smack him,\" They said in unison. Alai looked nervously from Petra to Ender and back again, before giving in and distributing Bean with a hard slap to the face. \"AHHH!\" Bean bolted upright and screamed. In his mind, Ender still didn't have both eyes or ears, Petra had no left arm, and Alai was nothing but a waist, torso, arms, and head. \"Bean, calm down,\" Said Petra in a zombified, distorted voice. \"Y-you're d-d-dead!\" Bean shrieked. \"That's just your mind trying to bring your nightmares to life,\" Ender reassured. He remembered when Valentine wouldn't stop screaming because she said aliens were attacking her. Battle School scarred that poor girl. \"E-Ender, you-you're e-eye!\" Bean choked, pointing to Ender's eye. \"And P-Petra's arm, a-and Alai...\" Petra took Bean's hand and set it on her arm. Bean felt it, from shoulder to wrist, shuddering silently. It had been gone a moment ago, but now it was here, clear as day. After a few moments of hugs and awkward silence, the team retreated to their beds. All of them were too afraid to sleep. Bean laid awake, thinking about his old life. But when you're given this chance of living on a different planet, you have to start anew. Bean couldn't let himself crack, look at all he's accomplished. Coming here came with an unsaid warning: everyone will snap, break, shatter, burn, and so on. But your team will be there, always. Just like they were there for Bean they will be there for each other. There'll be ups and there'll certainly be downs. But above all, there'll always be the Dragon Army.

Enjoy! EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he, who in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee. Ezekiel 25:17 Ender Wiggin hadn't slept in three days. He shivered in the dark silence. Stared out of the cockpit viewport at the open voids. But he couldn't stop them. Even in this sea of silent hyper-awareness that beat like poison in his blood, the visions flashed across his eyes like fireworks over the infinite backdrop of space. He clenched his bloodshot eyes shut and gritted his teeth. Another spasm of terror tore through him like a searing kiss from hot metal. The ring of fire consumed, spreading wider and wider like a great mouth swallowing everything. The horror crushed his heart as he lost all balance, all sight, brushing through the crowd as the floor threatened to leave his feet. He opened his eyes again. He steeled his mind, closing it like the lid of Pandora's box. He stood alone again in the cockpit of his small silver vessel, silence closed in on him like a coffin. The lights from the HUD winked. Ahead of him was nothing. To his left was nothing. To his right – nothing. And behind him, stowed safely in a box in the cargo hold, sat the egg. The last Queen. The last hope of life. He tried to keep his eyes open. He swallowed mightily and tried to calm his breathing. It didn't work. Nothing worked. His heart wouldn't slow down. The rivers of prickling fire wouldn't stop racing down his skin. Sweat beaded on his forehead and ran down the tip of his nose. A question reached his mind. A foreign thought, wondering what was going to happen next. \"Not now,\" He whispered. \"I can't- please, not now.\" It faded. He strangled a yelp as it threatened to rise from his belly and choke him – a nightmare flashed again and his stomach convulsed. \"You said it was only a game!\" He noticed the collar of his uniform sticking to his skin, wet from his sweat. When he opened his eyes again he stumbled forward, desperately throwing himself into the captain's chair and fumbling for the control monitor. With shaking hands, he activated it and tapped his fingers on the screen, opening a menu. Destination Coordinates: [ _ - _ - _ ] Ender paused for a moment, the cursor blinking at him, then opened the keypad and entered three numbers: 00-00-00 The computer automatically acknowledged his input. Destination Coordinates: [ 00 - 00 - 00 ] Confirm Destination? YES NO He pressed 'YES.' The engines immediately activated, humming and rising to a roar, and the ship spun up and to the left, adjustment nozzles hissing as it righted itself in space. The drives engaged, and the ship shot forward so fast the stars blazed past like missiles. Ender felt nothing – there was no acceleration. He leaned back against his seat, letting the streaks of the flashing stars draw lines on his tired vision. Coordinates 00-00-00. Earth. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG The doorbell buzzed as he depressed it with his finger. The sun shone on his shoulders, filtering through the trees as they waved in the gentle wind, casting pleasant shadows over the grass. A tiny suitcase sat by his ankle. Ender kept his eyes fixed on the holovid as the screen appeared, giving him a view of the inside hallway. Valentine's face appeared. Her deep brown hair was longer than when he had last seen it. Her stormy blue eyes flashed wide in surprise. \"Ender!\" She shouted, and flashed out of view. The Holovid disappeared. Footsteps clattered closer to the door and the door flew open. \"Ender!\" she cried again, throwing her arms around him. A brief smile reached the corner of Ender's lips as he encircled his arms around her back. \"Oh, Ender I got your message – I was so worried you wouldn't come back. Where have you been?\" She finally pulled away, resting her hands on his shoulders and watching his eyes earnestly. He stared back, narrowing his slightly, watching her. \"I've… just been busy,\" he murmured at last. Her happiness faded slightly from her face, but then she grabbed his arm. \"Please – come in.\" By now all of this commotion had summoned the rest of the family. Mother showered him with hugs and kisses, practically smothering him, and Father praised him with such affection that Ender dimly remembered that only a year ago he would have paid a fortune to hear those words. All the while Peter, who had grown even taller and more muscular in Ender's absence, leaned carelessly against the wall of the hallway, watching him. Mother finally let him go and Ender met Peter's eyes. \"We heard all the details about the third invasion,\" he drawled. \"Nice move.\" Ender paused, his eyes narrowing. \"What do you mean, 'third invasion?'\" He asked. \"We heard all about it,\" Father said, his Polish accent as thick as Ender remembered it. \"How the Bugs launched another invasion into our space, but you- you went behind them took them by surprise. You wiped out their entire fleet!\" \"Like I said, nice,\" said Peter. \"Stole that one from Hannibal, right?\" Ender didn't speak. He just stared. Surrender… that's what they decided to call it. But - of course they wouldn't release the real story. He should have seen it coming. He shook his head – where had his mind gone? \"Are you okay?\" Valentine asked, frowning at him, her brow creased with worry. \"I'm fine,\" Ender said dully. He gestured to his suitcase. \"Can I take this to my room?\" They all fell silent, watching him. \"Oh – um… sure. Of course, Andrew,\" said Mom, giving him a small, quivering smile. Ender nodded, expressionless, picked up his bag, and strode past them to his room. It was untouched – everything sat in the exact spot at which he had left it a year ago. He glanced around for a moment, noting that someone had at least dusted in here, then placed the suitcase on his bed. A soft footstep on the carpet behind him. Too quiet. \"So, how does it feel,\" a low voice breathed in his ear, 'To be the hero? \" Ender whirled and slammed his grip over Peter's throat, crushing his windpipe in his fingers and driving him backwards, slamming his head into the wall. The wall shuddered and a picture frame fell from its hook with a crack. Ender looked straight into Peter's eyes, nose touching his, a blaze of fury with such power and strength coursing through him that that he felt the strength to kill surging in his hands. Peter stood frozen in Ender's grasp, his eyes wide and focused, looking unflinchingly back. Then they widened further and he took in a labored gasp. It was as though he was seeing Ender for the first time. \"What was that?\" Valentine's muffled voice came from the hall. Ender loosened his grip and lowered his hand. Red marks lined Peter's throat where his fingers had cut into the skin. Valentine appeared outside the door and opened it. Her eyes immediately flashed upon the scene, looking back and forth between them. Ender saw – she knew exactly what had happened as surely as though she had seen it herself. \"Ender?\" she asked quietly. Ender and Peter's eye contact hadn't broken. And Ender realized that something had changed – his vision had blurred. Then it cleared as tears spilled down his cheeks. \"What did they do to you?\" Peter breathed. They were silent. Ender turned away and moved back to his suitcase, keeping Peter in his line of sight. Peter and Valentine stayed still as statues, watching him. Ender swallowed and looked down. He tried not to close his eyes. His heart slammed in his chest and refused to calm. His fingers shook as he tried to undo the clasps of his luggage. \"They lied,\" Valentine murmured. \"I knew it.\" Ender looked up at them. \"Your poker face sucks,\" Peter sniped softly, folding his arms across his chest. Ender's jaw trembled. \"Is it almost suppertime?\" He managed, his voice quivering. \"Um… yeah. It'll be – yeah, in a bit,\" said Valentine. She looked at Peter and touched his arm. \"Come on, Peter.\" Peter narrowed his eyes, studying Ender, then turned and left the room, Valentine behind him. Silence reigned. Ender sank onto his bed, the covers rustling. He ran his hand across them, their touch stirring old memories under his skin. Another tear fell and made a damp spot on the starched fabric of his grey trousers. His family was like strangers. Be it in the chasm of infinite space, or in the arms of his sister, always he carried this immortal hell: Always- always he stood alone. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG After an intolerably long supper in which Ender dutifully answered every question they asked him – except for what really happened – he excused himself to bed, claiming that traveling had worn him out. Their concerned gazes burned into his back as he left. He gritted his teeth, trying to ignore them. When the long night had finally begun, Ender lay in his bed, staring up at the blank ceiling – he had taken down the mobile of the Formic spaceship that he had made when he was young and hidden it in his closet. Then, for good measure, he took down everything off of his walls – his models of Mazer's plane, all of his models and toys, all of the posters of propaganda from the IF that he had once hung for inspiration. His door opened. Ender closed his eyes and slowed his breathing pattern. The footsteps slipped across the carpet – too soft. Peter. \"I know you're awake.\" Ender opened his eyes. Peter stared down at him. His expression was hidden in shadow. \"I killed someone at battle school,\" said Ender, surprised at how dull and flat his voice sounded. \"He tried to beat me up when I was naked in the shower.\" He meant it as a warning, but Peter just replied: \"Serves him right. Terrible choice of location.\" He slowly knelt by the bedside. Ender sat up on his elbow. So, Peter wasn't here to get revenge after all. Maybe. \"Tell me,\" Peter murmured, his eyes narrow. \"Tell me what really happened.\" Ender's throat closed. His nose wrinkled. \"Don't pretend,\" he whispered. \"Ender, talk,\" Peter asked again. \"I'll understand.\" Ender threw his covers off and put his feet on the ground. \"No matter how violent you were,\" Ender snarled, \"or how cruel, or vicious, You have no idea , no ability to comprehend what I've been through. You know nothing! You just find me intriguing because I know something you don't!\" Peter closed his eyes and let out a low sigh through his nose. \"Maybe you'll see, one day, Ender.\" He got to his feet again and looked down at him. \"Maybe you'll see me. I hope you can.\" And Peter turned and left the room. Ender sat motionless on the edge of his bed for the rest of the night, holding back the river of nightmares with a dam of wet clay.

I was submitting my application for film school – I'm going to get my MFA in Movie Directing! As a reward for the long wait, here's an extra long chapter! EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG \"Where is the horse and the rider? Where is the horn that was blowing? They have passed like rain on the mountains. Like wind in the meadow. The days have gone down in the west. Behind the hills, into shadow. How did it come to this?\" -The Lord of the Rings From: Col. Hyram Graff To: Adm. Ender Wiggin Bonzo Madrid is dead. Funeral on 03-23 at 1900 Cementerio de la Costa Cartagena, Spain Ender squeezed the sides of his tablet so hard the plastic creaked in protest. He stared at the message until the words burned into his eyes. So clever, Colonel. Opening an unhealed wound. Driving another pin into the doll. Trying to break him. But no tears came. No shadow crossed his expression. A shiver passed through his insides and an old and terrible sensation filled up his heart. Rage. And it burned as cold as black ice. That very morning, he said his goodbyes to Valentine and his family, and took to the stars. Just for a short while, the silence of space enveloped him again as he piloted the personal ship he had appropriated from the base into a tight orbital trajectory. The earth curved away beneath him, shining like the brightest of multicolored jewels. The oceans glittered in the distant sunlight, the land seeming to shimmer with its vibrancy. Such a familiar sight. Ender had seen it countless times. But the silence and utter, glorious beauty stole his heart with every gaze. And there in the distance, hovering in the blackness above the glow of the atmosphere, he could even see the school itself, so miniscule in comparison to the titanic size of its homeworld. Ender looked away and brought the ship back down out of orbit – it didn't take long in space to cross a thousand miles. The twenty-third was two days away. And if no one else, he wanted her at his side. The ship descended through the atmosphere in a blaze of fire, the viewscreen dimming to shield his eyes. Finally, he broke into the blue skies and passed through the clouds. A massive urban sprawl spread below him, and at its edge there lay a segment of total order among the disorganized structure – aligned in perfect longitude and latitude design. Soon a voice greeted him on the military channel and guided him in to land. Ender allowed the computer to do most of the work, and exited the cockpit as soon as his craft touched down. He activated the landing ramp and a blast of sharp mountain air surged into the ship as the ship's pressure seal was broken and the ramp descended. He strode down the ramp, looking down at whoever was here to welcome him – he had made sure, even though every ounce of him wanted to tear it off and never look at it again, to wear his military uniform. A single ensign saluted him as he stepped onto the tarmac. \"Keep my ship here. I'll only be here for a day at most.\" \"Yes sir,\" the ensign replied stiffly. The ensign kept flicking his eyes to Ender's and then looking away, and his hands quivered slightly. Ender requested transportation and a car labeled with the insignia of the IF was waiting for him as he exited the main doors of the base. As he lowered himself into the backseat and told the driver where he was going, it struck him as odd that even after all he had done, he was still considered too young to drive. He stared out the window as the car took a path through mountains blanketed with waving evergreens, following the same path as a swirling, boulder-filled river that coursed alongside the road to their right. After an hour's journey, the sun had risen to its zenith in the sky, looking somehow harsher than he was used to. Finally the car exited the mountains and came to a city that hugged the foothills like buildings on a coastline. He watched through the tinted windows as the bustle of people strode through their lives on either side of the street – going shopping; having lunch. How foreign it all seemed. The driver took him to a residential area, where large white houses and manicured lawns lined the road and short trees dotted the lawns. A boy no older than Ender skateboarded down the sidewalk, headphones in his ears. A father and his daughter played catch with a softball in their front yard. The car slowed and pulled into a house just like all the others in the neighborhood, with cream-colored siding and brown brick foundation. A two-car garage stood in front, with a recessed front entrance to the left side of it. Ender ordered the driver to wait, and he opened the car door and stepped out onto the pavement. A strange sense of detachment came over him as he strode up to the front door and rang the bell. But he didn't have time to dwell on it – in a few moments a figure moved behind the shadowed panes of glass and the latch clicked. The door opened and there she stood, staring at him with wide eyes. Her brown hair flicked to the side in an errant breeze, shining in the light of the sun. Petra. \"Ender!\" she burst out. Ender smiled. \"Petra.\" She stepped off the threshold and grabbed him roughly by the shoulders. \"What were you thinking? Where did you go? Why didn't you tell me?\" She demanded heatedly, shaking him with each question, then threw her arms around him and crushed him to her chest. Ender lowered his head into her shoulder and closed his eyes, swiftly wrapping his arms around her back and squeezing her just as tightly. \"I'm sorry,\" he murmured. \"But I'm back.\" She let him go and met his eyes, staring daggers at him. \"Don't you ever disappear like that again. Not without telling us where you're going.\" Ender nodded. \"I promise.\" She watched him for a moment, then nodded in return. She looked him up and down and raised an eyebrow. \"You still wear that uniform?\" \"I see that you don't,\" Ender replied, eyeing her white t-shirt and jeans. Petra snorted. \"They offered to promote me to Commander; I told them to shove it and I resigned.\" She waved a hand towards the open door. \"Come on in.\" She led him into a living room area, with soft carpet, plush sofa and chairs surrounding a holovid display and large windows streaming in sunlight. \"My parents are out right now, so it's just us,\" said Petra. She gestured at the sofa. \"Have a seat.\" \"Thanks,\" said Ender, and lowered himself onto the cushions. The couch seemed to invite him to lean back and sink into it, but Ender kept his spine straight. He watched Petra's face as she sat in one of the chairs. \"Did you hear about Bonzo?\" Ender asked. Petra frowned. \"No I didn't. What about him? Did he wake up?\" \"He's dead.\" Petra took in a breath. She didn't speak for a long moment. \"Ender, I'm so sorry,\" she said softly. Ender shook his head and looked at the carpet. \"The funeral is Friday.\" Petra sat up straight, looking at him askance. \"You're… going?\" \"Would you come with me, please?\" Petra's brow furrowed as she watched him for a moment, her eyes narrow. Finally, she nodded. \"Where is it? Ender let out a breath. \"Cartagena.\" \"Cartagena, Spain ?\" Petra confirmed. Ender nodded. \"How exactly are we going to get there?\" she asked. Ender allowed himself a small smile. \"Well… my rank has its perks.\" EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG Ender left Petra's as though a great weight had been taken from his chest. And a ball had begun to roll inside his mind. Petra hadn't referred to herself – she had referred to 'us.' She was right. Relief coursed through him as he realized that others had seen his visions as well. Others had been betrayed. And others would be ready to follow him again. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG Ender strode through the halls of West Point, accompanied by the Academy Administrator. Since… since what happened had happened, the IF had abandoned their forward command school on Eros and transferred the students to other academies on, or nearer to, Earth. His footsteps, and the footsteps of the cadet that guided him, echoed down the long, empty hallway. The hallway extended a hundred yards in either direction, doorways to classrooms on either side. Ender kept his eyes ahead, letting the cadet lead. The cadet finally stopped and gestured deliberately at a classroom door marked 217A. \"He's in there, sir.\" Ender nodded. \"Thank you. I can find my own way back.\" \"Sir, I would not recommend-\" \"Dismissed,\" Ender said firmly, giving him a piercing look. The cadet blinked, then saluted and walked back the way they came, his fading footsteps echoing like dripping water in a cave. Ender paused for a moment to gather himself, then grasped the handle and pulled the classroom door open. The room beyond was small, with a table lining each wall, leaving a space in the center. Students of varying ages sat facing inward, dressed in simple grey uniforms, monitors and keyboards sitting in front of them currently displaying a complex maneuver diagram of orange arrows and various colored dots. The instructor, a tall, balding, thin man, stood in the center of the room, pointing at a hovering holovid diagram that matched the display on the students' screens. All heads turned to him as he stood framed in the doorway. The teacher paused in mid sentence and fixed him with a stern look. \"Excuse me, we are in the middle of-\" \"Ten-hut!\" Bean, who until that moment Ender had been unable to spot, shot to his feet amongst the students as he shouted the command. Immediately all of the other students jumped out of their chairs and snapped to attention. Ender smiled briefly. They probably only did it out of reflex. The instructor whirled to Bean, now dwarfed by the older classmates on either side of him, with a look of outrage. \"Mister Delphiki!\" he bellowed. Ender blinked. Delphiki? He'd never heard Bean's real name – even his uniform at battle school had been labeled with his nickname. \"What is the meaning of this interruption?\" But bean didn't even look at him. His eyes remained fixed on Ender. \" Fallaces sunt rerum species , sir,\" He answered, a flicker of a smile touching a corner of his mouth. \"Why have you seen fit to disrupt my classroom?\" the instructor shouted back. \"I apologize for the interruption,\" said Ender, lifting his chin and stepping into the room. \"I'm Admiral Ender Wiggin.\" All the blood drained out of the instructor's face. The silence of Ender's words hung in the air. The instructor slowly turned to face him. The other students' eyes flicked to Ender and widened, but none dared to fall out of their attention pose. The instructor scanned Ender's uniform for a moment and spotted the four silver stars on Ender's collar, then finally came, himself, to attention and saluted him. \"My apologies sir,\" he said in a low voice. \"What can I do for you?\" \"I would appreciate it if I could borrow Mr. …Delphiki for a moment.\" Bean rolled his eyes. \"Of course, sir,\" the instructor said. Ender nodded. \"I'll have him back shortly.\" \"Yes sir.\" Bean slid past the other students and strode past Ender out the door. Ender turned and followed, closing and latching the door behind him. Bean spun to face him, and his face lit up with a warm smile. \"Ho, Ender.\" \"Ho, Bean,\" Ender replied with a grin. They fell in side by side, adopting an idle pace down the vacant hall. Ender looked down at the floor as he walked, hands clasped behind his back. \"So… Mr. Delphiki?\" Bean snorted. \"I hate that stupid name.\" \"I can see why – Bean fits you better,\" Ender chuckled. \"Graff encouraged my nickname, but guess that's not the way they do things here at the Point,\" Bean huffed. He turned and looked at Ender as they walked. \"I had heard you had gone off the grid. Why are you here?\" Ender's stride paused. Bean stopped. Ender closed his eyes for a moment. \"I need your help.\" Bean seemed to swell a size. \"Anything,\" he said immediately. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG The evening sun burned into Ender's eyes as the horse-drawn limber and caisson pulled closer. The horse's head bobbed with its steps, hooves clopping on the dirt path that wound through the white headstones. On either side of the limber stepped four men in IF uniform, each footfall deliberate and precise, and behind them trailed three more, armed with black laser rifles. The setting sun burned red on the horizon, minutes from kissing the edge of the ocean. A restless breeze wafted from the waters and ruffled the fringe of a red canopy that stood guard over an open grave. The horse drew near and turned with the path, revealing the cargo laid upon the limber: a coffin, swathed in a blue flag emblazoned with the crest of the International Fleet. Ender sat motionless on his plastic folding chair. Petra sat on his left, Bean on his right. Further down the row were Alai, Dink, and Bernard, all here at Ender's invitation. Petra held his hand, fingers entwined with his, but somehow he couldn't feel it. He couldn't breathe. The silence of the coffin screamed at him. Over a hundred others had gathered in these uncomfortable chairs, sitting in perfect lines. An aisle dividing them, pointing to the canopy; to the perfectly rectangular hole in the ground. Ender could hear a woman crying in the front row, wearing a black dress and a veil. A man with graying black hair sat stiffly beside her. The men on either side of the limber bearing Bonzo's casket lifted it as one, silently bringing it back off of the limber with practiced stillness. Then, with choreographed steps, they carried it to the canopy. All eyes followed it in unison as the shadow fell over it. They laid the coffin on a metal stand to the side of the grave, then gently pulled the corners of the flag until it sprung tight, hovering over the coffin. Keeping it taut, the four soldiers stepped to one side and began to fold it with practiced perfection, first in half lengthwise, then in half again, then folding an overlapping triangle until it had become a tight diamond. One of the solders took the flag, holding it on top and bottom, and bent at the waist and presented it to the man seated beside the weeping woman. Ender swallowed, understanding. They were Bonzo's parents. \"Mr. Madrid, in honor of your son's service to the International Fleet, we present you with this flag.\" Bonzo's father slowly took it and put it in his lap. Bonzo's mother couldn't hold it in anymore – she burst into loud wails that gouged into Ender's skin like rusted nails. A wave of nausea overtook him and he shifted in his chair. Petra looked to him, gripping his hand tightly. Her eyes glistened. The soldiers who folded the flag turned their backs on the crowd and faced Bonzo's coffin. \"Ten-hut!\" They shouted. Ender stood, immediately followed by Dink, Alai, Bean, Bernard, and Petra. Several other uniformed men and women also rose. Ender whipped his hand to his forehead in salute, and everyone followed suit, including Petra – even though she no longer wore a uniform. In the distance by the caisson, the three men with rifles brought them swiftly to their shoulders, aiming forty-five degrees up to the sky. \"Fire!\" Someone called. A scream of pressure exploded against their ears as bolts of light rocketed from the barrels and flashed up to the heavens like comets. \"Fire!\" Three streaks of light blazed to the sky again. \"Fire!\" The final triad sprang from the bullets and jetted skyward. The men lowered their guns. A roar grew in the distance behind them. Ender's vision blurred as he turned around to face the noise, and tears spilled down his cheeks. Three fighers, their engines glowing a piercing blue, rocketed toward them. The roar grew to a deafening blast as they passed straight overhead, and then the middle fighter pulled up and zoomed skyward, abandoning the other two ships to their course. The roar of the engines slowly fell away, echoing across the waters like rolling thunder. The soldiers left, leading the horse in a circle and coming back the way they had come. Bonzo's mother hadn't stopped crying. Her weeping and the clops of the retreating horse's hooves were the only sounds that broke the silence through the errant wind. Everyone else rose, too, and a quiet muttering began between the gathered people. Ender let go of Petra's hand and left the row, walking up the aisle. Ender's mind seemed to deepen into a trance. The corners of his vision hazed into black as he approached the coffin. He stopped when the ground ended. The six-foot chasm of waiting surrender separated him from the wooden tomb on the stand. He reached out a futile hand, then let it drop. Another tear rolled down his cheek and he took a shuddering breath. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\" Ender lowered his head and turned, and found someone standing in his way. \"You are Admiral Wiggin?\" Ender raised his gaze and found himself looking up into a man's face – a pronounced nose, thin, elegant eyebrows, and short-cut salt and pepper graying hair. His eyes were swollen and red. They narrowed. \"I wish to make… apology,\" he said in a low voice, his accent thick and heavy. \"You fought with honor… my son did not.\" Ender swallowed, sustaining his gaze. Everyone else in the funeral gathering had frozen behind Bonzo's father, watching them. Finally, Ender lowered his head. A hand came to rest on his shoulder.

I told you I'd update faster! Thanks for all of your lovely responses! I treasure each one. Now, on with the story! EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG The Dark Lord has Nine. But we have One, mightier than they: the White Rider. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads. -The Lord of the Rings The autopilot chirped, indicating that their chosen trajectory and speed had been reached. Ender sat back in the pilot's chair, tracing his eyes along the curve of the earth as the ocean passed underneath them. Behind him, in the rear of the ship, Petra, Dink, Alai, Bean, and Bernard sat and quietly talked. Enough space separated him from them that their voices faded to a pleasant murmur. Ender closed his eyes, sinking into the rhythm of their tones. A thrill of fatigue closed over him and he wondered if he might sleep – but then footsteps approached, clacking on the plated metal of the ship's floor. Ender opened his eyes. Alai sat down in the copilot's chair, folding his hands in his lap and watching out the viewport for a moment. He turned to Ender and gave him a warm smile that softened his dark eyes. \"Hey, Ender.\" \"Alai,\" Ender replied. \"Thank you for inviting us,\" said Alai, looking back to the stars again. \"It was a good funeral.\" Ender huffed through his nose, glancing down. Alai remained silent for a moment. \"What next?\" Alai finally wondered, raising an eyebrow and nodding towards the cockpit window. \"I see that we have already passed by New York, and you never make mistakes, so you obviously aren't dropping Bean off. Or any of us.\" Alai leaned forward in his chair, resting his forearms on his knees and locking his eyes on Ender. \"Where are we going?\" Ender met Alai's watchful look for a moment longer, then faced forward again and tapped a button on the control screen to activate the descent sequence. The engines hummed and the ship angled down, filling their viewscreen with a brilliant vista of the planet. \"Somewhere safe,\" he answered. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG They hiked in silence. Ender led them on the same path he'd trod every day for two weeks on his leave from battle school, between the house where Bonzo had lain and the lake. Rustling trees marched tightly on either side of the path, forcing them to duck under outstretched branches. The wind, cold off the lake, drifted through the flickering leaves and caressed Ender's face, ruffling his hair. When they had arrived, Ender had accessed the house and everyone who still wore a uniform changed into what spare clothing they could find inside – t-shirts, jeans, sweatpants. Tennis shoes. None of them had spoken since they had arrived. Ender could feel them waiting for him to be the first to talk. At long last the trees opened like a curtain and revealed the shore. A grey pebbled beach sloped into crystalline azure water, reflecting a glorious array of mountains that surrounded the edges of the lake like the points of a crown. Dink whistled at the view, and Ender smiled. He approached the water, the rocks clacking as his footsteps sent the looser stones tumbling, and bent when he reached it, running his finger through the lapping shoreline. It was cold, too cold to swim in, and the breeze still carried a trace of winter's edge. Ender shook the water from his hand, then rose and turned to them. They waited in a tight group, watching him. \"Spread out and look for wood,\" he called. \"We'll need the longest logs we can find, and a lot of them.\" \"What for?\" Bernard asked. \"Help me build a raft,\" Ender answered, and began striding down the beach towards the nearest bunch of driftwood he could see. They immediately followed his words. Dink and Alai walked the coastline in the other direction, Petra joined Ender, and Bean and Dink crunched back into the forest to search for fallen branches. They brought the suitable logs they could find and piled them on the shore by the path, and Ender examined them to make sure they were long and sturdy enough. After they had gathered a large pile of rugged logs Ender set them to picking the thick grasses that grew in the woods to weave into rope. They worked in silence all the while, as the sun slowly rose higher in the sky and warmed their shoulders and necks. When they had woven several lengths of rope, they began constructing the raft. They laid out sixteen of logs in a row, then bound sixteen logs to them perpendicularly, eight on top and eight on the bottom, using their woven rope to secure it all in place. Eventually Ender was satisfied. When it was finished, they stood side by side on the shore, laid their hands on the edge of the raft, and as one shoved it out into the water, hopping aboard as the water splashed around their ankles and waves sprayed onto the raft. They spread across it laid down paddled the raft out onto the lake using their hands. It was slow work, and the water chilled their forearms, but Ender plowed onward and no one said a word. It was a thrill to have a goal again - even if that goal was as simple as getting a raft to the middle of a lake. Eventually Ender called for them to stop. They had left the shores far behind, and the wind-blown water lightly splashed and surrounded them. The mountains towered to the sky even at this distance, and the sun sparkled on the restless waves. Though they had built the raft as well as Ender could have hoped, it wasn't water-tight by any means – a bit of water seeped up and dampened their clothes when minor swells passed underneath them. Ender sat cross-legged on the coarse wood, just as he had when he had done on his own little raft when he come here for silence during his leave. The others sat along the edges of the raft to make sure it stayed balanced. The wood creaked, and the lake slopped against and underneath it. A constant wind buffeted them. \"What's up?\" Dink asked. Ender looked up. He nodded. \"I need your help.\" He looked to all of them. They remained motionless. Petra's hair flapped in the wind like a flag. He took a breath. \"I found something. Back on Eros.\" And he told them everything. How the Queen had been using the mind game to speak to him, that the Formics had been trying to speak to them the whole time; how it had led him to the secret chamber in the ruins; and how he and promised to find them a new home. No one interrupted while he spoke. They all watched with rapt attention, completely motionless. When he finished they sat for a long moment, silent. \"Bastards,\" Dink muttered. \"There's one flaw with your plan,\" said Alai slowly. \"You know what will happen if you try to bring the Formics back.\" \"The IF will find them and destroy them,\" Bean finished with a nod. \"Remember what Graff said? 'Their very existence is a threat.'\" \"I know,\" Ender said quietly. \"What do you want from us?\" Bernard asked, leaning forward where he sat. The raft rocked on the waves as Ender waited, methodically selecting his next words. \"They lied to us. They tricked us. They turned us into killers.\" Ender lowered his hands to his lap and clenched them into white-knuckled fists. \"I offer … revenge. \" He let that hang in the air, looking to each of them in turn. Their eyes narrowed – but no one looked shocked. \"I promised the Queen that I would find them a new home. We have to deliver on that promise. We owe them that.\" Bernard nodded. \"But to do that…\" Dink began slowly. \"We'd have to go public,\" said Alai, his brow furrowing. \"And to do that we'd have to subvert the censors in the media.\" \"And we'd have to change public opinion about the Formics themselves,\" Dink added. \"Seventy years of fear and propaganda is hard to counter,\" said Bernard. \"And to prevent the IF from destroying the new formic civilization, we have to…\" Dink breathed, his eyes widening. \"We have to destroy them,\" Bean growled. \"Graff. The Strategos. Even Mazer Rackham.\" \"Treason,\" Petra murmured. Ender's face was impassive. \"Of the highest order,\" he agreed. They glanced back and forth amongst each other, conferring without words. Ender waited, watching them. Then they looked back to him in unison. \"We're in,\" said Bean. Bernard, Petra, Dink, and Alai all added their assent. Ender nodded and looked down, his chest swelling with pride. \"We are-\" he murmured. \"Dragon,\" they replied. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG They sat out on the raft until the sun had fallen into the west and bathed the lake in colors of fire, laying out every facet, every eventuality of their plan. Nothing could go wrong. And nothing could be overlooked. When the sky began to darken, they set to paddling the raft back to the shore to keep from getting caught on the water when night fell. The raft crunched against the pebbled shore and the five of them hopped off, splashing their sneakers into the edge of the water as they pulled the raft further onto the land to keep it from drifting away. The sun had fallen beyond the horizon and the details of the landscape had begun to fade into shadow. A blast of light struck them all in the face. Ender raised a hand, shielding his eyes, as the others let out surprised shouts. \"What the?\" A hundred yards away a pair of blinding headlights cut across the beach. Ender stayed in place, keeping his hand up. \"Is that a car?\" Petra asked. \"Who knows we're here, Ender?\" Dink asked. Ender's eyes narrowed. He waited. \"Keep calm,\" he ordered gently. Something moved. The driver's door opened and a figure emerged. The snap of the door shutting popped against their ears, breaking the silence. The air had gone still after the sun had set. The figure stepped around the car and into the headlights, striking a long, stretched shadow across the beach. It paused for a moment, then began to stride towards them. No one moved. Ender waited. As the figure approached, details of its silhouette became clear: silver hair. A military unform. An older, slightly hunched bearing. Ender's heart pummeled against his ribcage and a rock settled in his stomach. \"Colonel Graff,\" he finally managed. Graff stopped in front of Ender, looking at the others for a moment, then dropped his eyes to him. \"Ender. It's been a while,\" he said, his voice gravelly as usual. He nodded to the others. \"What brings them here?\" \"We came here after Bonzo's funeral,\" said Petra, her voice soft. Ender could feel their fear pressing against his back. He struggled to manage his heartbeat, to betray nothing in his face, to keep meeting those eyes. To hide his lust for murder. \"I could ask you the same question,\" Ender cut in, putting more force into his voice. \"What are you doing out here?\" He murmured. \"I don't believe that's any of your concern,\" Ender shot back, with more edge than he had intended. He clenched his jaw and swallowed, trying to wet his drying throat. \"That's not your call,\" Graff retorted. He looked over Ender's head at the others. \"So; a little Dragon Army reunion, huh?\" He dropped his gaze to Ender again. \"Why were you out on the lake?\" Ender refused to blink. \"Why are you here?\" He snapped. \"I would imagine that, should someone try, it would be very hard to hear what you were saying out there. Even with enhanced listening devices. The wind, and everything. Don't you think, Petra?\" \"I-I…\" Petra stammered. \"Are you implying something, Colonel?\" Ender growled. \"Should I be?\" \"Hey Colonel ,\" Bean interrupted loudly. Graff snapped his eyes up to him. \"I just realized something – Ender here outranks you. Where's his salute?\" The fire in Graff's eyes dimmed. Ender would have laughed if he hadn't been so angry. Graff worked his jaw for a moment, then looked back to Ender and waved a half-salute to him. \"Be careful… Admiral,\" Graff muttered as his hand dropped. Ender's eyes flashed. \"Don't pretend I don't know what's going on,\" he snarled in a low murmur. \"You will get in your car, and you will leave.\" Graff's expression didn't change. He saluted Ender one more time, accepting the order, then turned and strode away. Ender stood, unmoving, and watched him get into his car and drive away, the wheels crunching on the pebbled shore. Alai, Dink, Bean, Petra, and Bernard came to stand next to him, watching the headlights trail off up the road and into the countryside. \"That- was terrifying,\" said Petra, letting out a breath. The others let out similar sighs of relief. \"Bring them on,\" said Bean. EGEGEGEGEGEGEGEG Thanks so much for reading! If you like it, please leave a review!

Awsmpup, why are you starting a new story when you already have stories that need to be finished?! I just can't help myself! Like I said in my Special Announcement, my stories are just random thoughts I have, so I want to start this one before I forget what I wanted to do. It has happened numorous times. Anyway, on with my new story! Ch. 1 Me and Kuzco's idiot messenger are waiting for Kuzco to pick out a bride. I still don't get why he needs a stupid princess bride. Oh, I should probably introduce myself. I'm Kida, Kuzco's best friend. I'm the only one who can call the Emperor by his first name, since ya know, we're best friends. Have been since birth. I'm also the only one who can tell him off, cause I'm awesome like that. I have blonde hair, yeah not the most common hair color. Ok no one but myself has that hair color. And no one but myself has eyes that change color by mood. Yes I'm a freak of nature, but Kuzco doesn't seem to mind. And just so you know, I don't have feelings for him. Not one bit. Fine, a litte. Ok, more than a little. Alright! I'm in love with him, but it's not like it matters. He doesn't like me like that. And now you know why I'm against this whole bride thing. Anyway, like I said, we're waiting for Kuzco to pick out a bride. He's probably dancing to his \"Theme Song.\" Why did I just hear a scream? I still don't know why we're best friend's, let alone why I love. He's egotistical, selfish, self absorbed, sorta mean to others, handsome, hot- and I'm shutting up now. The doors burst open and Kuzco shouts out, \"Ha! Boom baby!\" \"Hey Kuzco\" I say the same time the messenger says, \"Ah, Your Highness, it is time for you to choose your bride.\" Kuzco looks past him and says, \"Alright, trodd out the ladies.\" I just know Kuzco is going to refuse and insult them. He does it all the time. I don't know why he does, but I'm not complaining. He walks up to the first girl, and goes down the row, insulting each. And I'm trying to hold in my laughter. What? I really hate these princesses. \"Let's take a looksie. Hate your hair, not likely, yikes, yikes, yikes, and let me guess, you have a great personality\" he says, then turning to his messenger, \"Is this really the best you can do?\" And then the idiot messenger starts to babble on and on about stupid things. I can tell Kuzco is thinking the same as me, he's like the thing that wouldn't shut up. I roll my eyes. Kuzco also rolls his eyes. My eye twitches as the idiot goes on and on, then I notice Kuzco looking at me. Why? Don't ask me. Wait, do I have something on my face? I look at him, questionably, but he quickly looks back the idiot. I rub my face to see if I have anything on it. Nope, nothing. Oh well, Kuzco is as unpredictable as rain. Actually, nevermind, he is very predictable. And, now I'm annoyed at the idiot. I hit him upside the head. Kuzco smirks...I think I just died inside. Fangirl squeal! What is a fangirl anyway? I push Kuzco to the door. \"Come on Kuzco. I have a feeling Yzma is doing it again\" I say, pushing him out. Kuzco rolls his eyes. \"When will she learn?\" He asks, rhetorically, stopping for a second. I let go of his shoulders. \"Probably never. You forget, her brain is as old as dirt\" I say, grinning. We both laugh and continue walking to the throne room. Though, I stop for a second, while Kuzco continues walking. I look back at the princesses, who still have insulted looks on their faces. I smirk and blow raspberries at them. Some look like they want to clobber me. I laugh and then quickly catch up with Kuzco. \"By the way, what was that scream earlier?\" I ask him. \"Huh? Oh, that was some old guy I had thrown out of the Palace\" Kuzco says. I know, that when he says thrown, he literally meant thrown out, like out of the window. \"KUZCO!\" I yell at him. \"What? He threw off my groove!\" he explains. I scoff and walk ahead, mad. \"Kida!\" he calls to me, but I ignore him and enter the Throne room. End of Ch.1 Me: So, what do you think? I don't think I did all that well. Sorry if it's predictable, and if Kuzco is OOC. I tried to do the best I could. Anyway, seriously, tell me what you think and if I should continue it. BYE-BYE![Chapter 2] Me and My Emperor Me: So I've decided that I'm going to update every other Saturday since I have so many stories and I hate having people in suspense for so long. But not this chapter since I made you wait so long. Chapter 3 should be up next Saturday. Kida: Yeah, that's really a downer Me: *stares at Kida* Uh, why and how are you here? Kida: Hm? Oh, I'm here so you're not alone in you AN's and this is your mind, so of course I'm going to be here. I'm your OC Me: Oh~ ri~ght, I forgot, sorry. Kida: It's alright everyone forgets something at one point or another Me: Thanks! Well, before we move to the story, a few things. One, Warty Hog, I checked your profile to find more about you, and I get that you are against plagerism, but so are tons of other people, including me. I'm not trying to be rude, but if ya have read any of my stories and not just the AN, you'd realize that I'm not writing things word for word. I'm basing my story on my favorite movies and shows while adding my own dialogue to it. Don't assume I'm taking credit for anything just because I forgot to do a disclaimer, which happens a lot. Kida: Yeah, I mean, no one likes it when someone goes up and accuses you of stealing something Me: Yeah, if anything you're plagerizing other people by calling yourself a plagerist hunter because other people before you called themselves the same thing and you're basically copying them Kida: *stares at me* Uh, that made no sense whatsoever Me: Yeah...that kinda sounded better in my head and I may or may not have forgot some bits and pieces of what I wanted to say Kida: *sighs and shakes head* I told you not to eat that last piece of cake, it makes you lazy and you become forgetful. Me: But it was so goooooood. And I'm forgetful all the time. Kida: *thinks for a moment and then nods* Yeah that is true Me: Anyway, moving on to the rest of info, my friend NobleSilverShadow wrote a new story with me in it! So read it, even though it isn't finished, because so far, it's awesome! Kida: *says dreamily while looking at laptop* Yeah it's cool Me: *frowns* Uh, what are you doing? Kida: *ignores me and starts to sigh dreamily* Me: *looks over her shoulder, widens my eyes, converts face into a disgusted look, and then pulls away quickly, shaking my head* OH, EW! GROSS! I DON'T WANT TO SEE KUZCO LIKE THAT! EW! THAT'S NASTY! I'M GOING TO HAVE NIGHTMARES FOR MONTHS! Kida: *shoots up, surprised* Huh? What?! *looks at me freaking out* Oh *shrugs, then goes back to staring at the laptop* Me: *shakes head quickly a few times then sighs and waves hand at reviewers* Just, just read the chapter while I go bleach my eyes Ch.2 And… I was right, Yzma is doing Kuzco's job again. She's sitting up in his Throne, wearing some sort of fan thing behind her. Seriously, she is living proof that dinosaurs once roamed on Earth. Kronk is standing next to her. Kronk is her right hand man. She gets a new one every decade or so. She's listening to a commoner talk about his problem. Kuzco comes in and rolls his eyes. We climb up the side stairs, and when we get to the top, Yzma says, \"It is no concern of mine, whether your family has, what was it again?\" \"Uh, food\" the commoner says. \"Well, you should've thought of that when you became peasants! We're through here. Take him away. Next!\" She calls out. I roll my eyes. Yes, because they chose to be poor. The guards take the man away, and Yzma sighs, rubbing her eyes. Kuzco leans against his Throne. \"The nerve of some peasants, right?\" he asks, smirking a bit. \"Tell me about it\" she says, then she realizes who was talking to her. She gasps and jumps to her feet. \"Your Highness! Kida!\" she exclaims. \"Your were doing it again\" I say, eyebrow raised. \"Doing, doing, doing what?\" she stutters. \"Oh, my job. I'm the Emperor\" Kuzco says, gesturing to himself, \"And you're the Emperor's advisor .\" As she tries to explain, I get sidetracked by her wrinkles. Uh, ew. Man, she needs facial work done. Badly. Wait a minute...EW! She has food in her teeth. Yuck! \"Good thinking Yzma! What do you say, Kuzco?\" Kronk says, punching Kuzco's shoulder, bringing me back to reality, Kuzco as well apparently. Kuzco jumps back, slicing his hands in the air at Kronk. \"Whoa! No touchy! No touchy! No touch\" Kuzco says, \"Only Kida touchy.\" I roll my eyes. Typical Kuzco. So I punch him. \"Owie!\" Kuzco whines, holding his shoulder. \"You said only I could touch you and your being a jerk\" I say shrugging. He glares at me a bit. \"Excuse me, your highnesses. The village leader is here to see you\" a servant says, below us. I forgot to mention that some servants call me royalty since me and Kuzco are so close. Yzma obviously doesn't, she doesn't like me much. I think it might be because if Kuzco dies without a wife and/or heir, I'm next in line, not her. His rule. Kuzco smiles. \"Oh, great. Send him in!\" The servant bows and leaves. \"Oh, by the way, you're fired\" Kuzco says to Yzma, waving her off. Ha, I knew it. He's finally got annoyed with her behavior, to the point where he's fired her. She's not going to like this. \"Fired?\" She exclaims, shocked, \"What do you mean, fired? \"Uh, how else can we say this?\" I ask to no one. Kuzco snaps his fingers and a scribe appears. \"You're being let go\" I say. \"Your department's being downsized\" Kuzco says. \"You're part of an outplacement.\" \"We're going in a different direction.\" \"We're not picking up your option.\" \"Take your pick. We've got more\" Kuzco says, smirking, as the scribe sticks the pink slip on Yzma's nail. \"But-I-you-uh\" she stutters, sighs and collapse onto Kuzco's Throne. \"But your Highness, I have been nothing if not loyal to the Throne for many, many years\" she says, trying to smile at Kuzco. Yeah, I'll believe the many, many, many years part, not so much loyal, though. \"Hey, hey. Everybody hits their stride\" Kuzco says. \"You just hit yours 50 years ago\" I says. \"So, who's in my chair?\" Kuzco asks, leaning over Yzma. \"Oh, oh, I know! Yzma! Yzma's in your chair, right?\" Kronk says, like a little excited puppy. \"Very good, Kronk!\" Kuzco says, pulling out a cracker. \"Here, get the snack!\" He tosses the cracker at Kronk, who tries to catch it with his teeth. \"Got it!\" He says, diving off the platform, after he misses the cracker. I flinch when he hits the ground with a thud. Ooh, that's gotta hurt. \"Ok, you heard the man. Up, up, up\" Kuzco says, ushering Yzma out of his Throne. \"I'm ok! I'm fine!\" Kronk yells up, as Yzma gets up and mutters angrily as she walks off the platform. \"Ah!\" Kuzco sighs, happily, as he flops into his Throne. I glare at him, my arms crossed. He notices. \"What?\" he asks, confused. \"I'm still mad at you about throwing that poor man out the window\" I say, my glare intensifying. He flinches a bit and I don't blame him. Mad Kida, is a Scary Kida. Plus my glare could probably scare Satan himself. \"But, but he threw off my groove!\" he whines. I roll my eyes. \"Why do you need the village leader anyway?\" I ask, not stopping my glare. \"Um\" he starts to say something, but looks a little too happy when the door opens. Something tells me I'm going to want to kill him when this is over. End of Ch.2 Me: There we go! Kida: So, am I really going to kill him? Me: No Kida: Why? Me: One, you love him. Two, you love him. And Three, without him, we have no story Kida: We could Me: How? Kida: *smirks evilly* I could take his place Me: *sweatdrops* Uh, you love him, remember? Kida: ….Dang it…. Me: Anyway, please review! Kida: *smirks evilly again* Maybe if you review, we could convince her to let me kill him Me: For the last time, WE AREN'T GOING TO KILL HIM OFF! Kida: *crosses arm and pouts*[Chapter 3] Me and My Emperor Me: FOR THE LAST TIME, WE AREN'T KILLING KUZCO OFF! Kida: *whines* But why not~?! Me: Because without him, we have no story! Kida: I could take his place! Me: No you can't! Kida: Why~?! Me: because this story is about you- wait a minute I ain't telling you how the story goes! Find out yourself! Kida: *huffs, crosses arms, and pouts* Me: *sighs and rubs forehead* Seriously, why are you so difficult? *turns to reviewers* So here's chapter 3. Go ahead and enjoy it while I talk to Kida here. I OWN NOTHING! Ch.3 A man pops his head in and clears his throat. Then he walks in and I can get a good look at him. He's a middle aged (?) man with brown hair. He is wearing a green poncho, with brown shorts, and a brown hat. \"Uh, afternoon, Your Highnesses. I'm here because I received a summons-\" Kuzco cuts the man off. \"Hey there he is! My main village man!\" Kuzco exclaims happily. \"Uh, Pacha. Anyway, I got this summons-\" Once again, Kuzco cuts him off. Can I hit him? \"Pacha. That's right. You are just the man I wanted to see\" Kuzco says. \"I am?\" Pacha asks. \"He is?\" I ask confused. Why does Kuzco want to see the leader of a small village? \"Word on the street is you can fix my problem\" Kuzco says. \"What problem?\" I ask, throwing my arms up exasperated. Kuzco normally tells me everything! What's so different about this?! I feel hurt now…. Kuzco jumps off the platform and slides down the rope. I follow his lead, only slower. \"You can fix my problem, can't you?\" Kuzco asks. \"For the last time, what problem?!\" I exclaims. \"Sh\" Kuzco shushes me, then he turns back to Pacha. I try to grab his neck to strangle him, but unfortunately my loyal and loving side stops me, so I just settle with a huff and a tiny scream. \"Uh, sure. I'll do what I can\" Pacha says, uncertainly. I think I might've scared him a bit. \"Good, good. That's just what I wanted to hear\" Kuzco says, patting Pacha's shoulder and leading him to another room. I follow them, steaming. \"Are you aware just how important your village is to the empire?\" Kuzco asks. Huh? \"Well, I know we grow the crops you use here at the Palace. We also herd the llamas that you-\" Pacha stops talking after Kuzco pulls a rope to reveal a tiny replica of his village. \"Uh, why do you have a tiny replica of his village?\" I ask, with an eyebrow raised. This time Kuzco ignores me. \"My village?\" Pacha asks, confused. \"Oh, yeah. You got a pretty sweet little set up there on top of that hill, don't you? Ha ha ha\" Kuzco asks with a tone of voice he uses to trick people into telling him what he wants to know. Not good. \"Yeah. My family has lived on that hilltop for the last 6 generations\" Pacha says proudly. \"Uh-huh. So tell me, where do you find you get the most sun?\" Kuzco asks. \"Oh, I say just on the other side of those trees\" Pacha tells him, moving to the spot he's talking about. \"When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing.\" \"Well, that settles it!\" Kuzco exclaims happily. \"What?\" me and Pacha ask together. \"Yep! Thanks for coming!\" Kuzco says, pushing Pacha away. \"That's it? That's all you wanted me for?\" Pacha asks. \"I just wanted an insider's opinion\" Kuzco says. \"For what?\" I ask him. I seriously don't like where this is going. \"I wanted an opinion before I ok'd this spot for my pool\" Kuzco explains, examining the replica. \"Uh… your pool?\" Pacha asks, looking at the replica of his house. \"What pool?\" I ask. He didn't tell me anything about a pool! Kuzco slams a figure of his apparent pool on top of Pacha's house. \"BOOYA! Welcome to Kuzcotopia! My ultimate summer getaway!\" he exclaims. \"YOUR WHAT?!\" I yell. \"Oh sorry\" Kuzco says, pulling me into a one-armed hug, \"OUR ultimate summer getaway!\" ...I'll kill him! \"Complete with water slide!\" he says, attaching a figure of a water slide. \"What?\" Pacha asks, confused, while I give Kuzco my 'you're a dead man' glare, which he ignores. Mostly. \"Isn't it great? It's my birthday gift to me! Ha ha. I'm so happy\" he says happily, hugging the figure. \"Uh..uh..um..I don't understand how this could happen\" Pacha says, examining the broken house in his hands. \"Well, let me clear it up for you. At my birthday celebration tomorrow, I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this\" Kuzco says, pushing a button that releases confetti from the little pool, while he hums a carnival tune. Pacha fixes the tiny house, and then Kuzco walks over to him and makes him drop it. \"So, if I were you, I'd pick up some change-of-address forms on the way home\" Kuzco says, nonchalatly. \"But, um, where will we live?\" Pacha asks. \"Hmm...Don't know, don't care, how's that?\" Kuzco says, walking away, pulling me with him. Ok, Kuzco has gone too far now! \"Uh, but wait, you can't-\" Pacha gets cut off by the guards. Kuzco stops, and slowly turns back to Pacha. \"When I give the word, your little town thingly will be…Bye-bye\" he slightly whispers, then he exclaims happily, \"Bye-bye!\" \"Oh w- wait. No\" Pacha tries to reason with Kuzco, but the guards take him away. \"Heh heh. Boo hoo\" Kuzco cries mockingly. Then he turns around and get my full blast death glare. Which makes him jump with a tiny scream. Like I said, Mad Kida is Scary Kida. \"What is wrong with you?!\" I yell. \"But-but\" I cut him off. \"No buts! Seriously, why are you so selfish?! You're throwing people out on the street all because you want a stupid little pool?! Why don't you move the pool to a different location without, oh I don't know, people living there?! UGH! I'm sick of the way you act! I've had it, Kuzco!\" I yell at him. \"What's that supposed to mean?\" he whimpers. \"...I'm leaving….\" I then walk out of the room. ….Wait, what did I just do?! Ch. 3 Me: HAHA! WEREN'T EXPECTING THAT WERE YA?! MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA Kida:...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! WHY?! KUZCO! *sobs loudly* Me: *sweatdrops* You were the one that wanted to kill him…. Kida: *sobs louder* Me: Uh, ok? Please review![Chapter 4] Me and My Emperor Me: Hey- Kida: *sobs loudly* WHY?! Me: Hey- Kida: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA! Me: WILL YOU SHUT UP FOR ONE SECOND?! *turns to reviewers* Hey guys! So, yeah, Kida is still crying over Kuzco Kida: *sobs loudly again* W-W-W-WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY?! KUZCOOOOOOOOOOOO! Me: *rolls eyes* Anyway, I'm glad a lot of people liked the last chapter. I thought you guys would hate me after what I wrote Kida: I HATE YOU! Me: No one cares. By the way, I made Kida on Doll Divine! Check it out. Remember, I don't own anything, except Kida and Ix Chel! Here's chapter 4! Enjoy! Ch.4 So, I probably cried my eyes out for about an hour before someone knocked on my door. \"Who is it?\" I ask, wiping my eyes. \"Your highness?\" someone calls. I peek out and see Ix Chel, the head seamstress. Yzma practically raised Kuzco, which you would think that he would've turn out better...on second thought, nevermind. However, Ix Chel practically raised me. But she also helped raise Kuzco when Yzma was off doing who know's what. \"Yes?\" I ask. She smiles at me knowingly. She probably knows about what happened earlier. It wouldn't surprise me, since she basically knows everything that happens in the Palace. \"Yzma has invited you and Kuzco to a dinner party tonight\" she says, in a kind tone. \"Oh, uh, ok. I, guess I could go\" I say, uncertainly. Ix Chel smiles, nods her head, and leaves me alone again. I close the door. Why the heck would Yzma invite us for dinner? I mean, me and Kuzco fired her earlier today. Hmm, suspicious...Oh well. I start to get ready, still pondering over the invitation. Wait, she invited me AND Kuzco...Not good. Well, I guess I have to face him sooner or later to, you know. I finish getting ready (AN: Her outfit is on Doll Divine) and start to head for Yzma's quarters. I get there and see Kuzco heading down too. He notices me, \"Kida!\" Ok, so I know I cried over him for about an hour, but I'm still mad at him, so I turn up my nose and ignore him, as I walk inside. \"Hey!\" he whines. \"Hi Yzma, Kronk\" I say, slamming the door on Kuzco, and sitting in a chair. \"Boom bam Baby!\" Kuzco says, kicking open the door, as if nothing out of the ordinary happened. Jerk… \"Let's get to the grub. I am one hungry king of the world!\" He says, spinning his chair, then sitting in it with his feet on the table. \"Last I checked you were only Emperor of the Inca Empire\" I mumble. Kuzco's eye twitches, then he ignores me, \"So, no hard feeling about being let go?\" \"None whatsoever\" Yzma says, tightly. Yeah, and llama's fly. \"Kronk, get the Emperor and Kida a drink\" Yzma tells him. \"Drink. Right….\" Kronk says, in a weird voice. Still suspicious…. Kronk goes to a little table behind Kuzco, and starts to pour the drinks. I drum my fingers against the table and then jump slightly when I hear two tiny explosions. Kuzco just sits there, ignorantly. Kronk comes back over, with a serving plate holding four drinks, two on one side and two on the other. ...Really suspicious…. \"Your Highness\" Kronk gestures to Kuzco. Kuzco sniffs the air. \"Is something burning?\" He asks, as I sniff. Kronk wears a look of worry as he gasps. \"My spinach puffs!\" He exclaims, running to the kitchen. While we wait, there's an awkward silence as Kuzco twangs his fork. \"Ahem\" Kuzco coughs. \"He seems nice…\" I say awkwardly. \"Heh, he is\" Yzma says, also awkwardly. \"He's what, in his late 20's?\" Kuzco asks. \"Heh heh, I'm not sure\" Yzma says. \"Saved 'em!\" Kronk exclaims coming back in, carrying his spinach puffs. \"That's great!\" Kuzco says, as Yzma says, \"Great!\" \"Good job!\" I say. \"Watch it, they're still hot\" Kronk warns us. \"Ahem\" Yzma coughs. \"Ahem!\" Yzma coughs again, as Kronk starts to serve the spinach puffs. \"Kronk\" Yzma says, getting his attention, \"The Emperor and Kida need their...drinks.\" \"Right!\" Kronk says, then he does his weird voice again, \"Oh. Right…\" He starts to get the cups for me and Kuzco, but stops. He hovers his hand over each and then bites his lip in confusion. He lifts a finger, with a guilty smiles, and quickly takes the drinks to the little table again. \"Hey, Kronky, everything ok back there?\" Kuzco asks. \"Oh, uh...Ooh, the drinks are a bit on the...oh...uh...Warm side!\" Kronk says, as four more tiny explosions sound. Really, really, suspicious…. \"Heh heh. Hey, did you see that sky today? Talk about blue!\" Kron says, awkwardly. Yzma laughs nervously. \"Yes Kronk. Riveting\" she says, as Kronk gives me and Kuzco a cup. \"A toast to the Emperor! Long live Kuzco!\" Yzma says. I watch Kuzco closely, as he spins his cup and drinks it. I wait a few seconds and nothing happens. I look at my drink and sniff it a little, before taking a few sips. It tasted ok, so I drank some more. \"Ah! Tasty!\" Kuzco says, then his face slams into his plate. I widen my eyes in worry, then I blank out for a little bit. \"Ok! What were we saying?\" Kuzco asks, as I shake my head a little, trying to think of what happened. \"Uh...We were just making a toast to your long and-\" Yzma stops a little when Kuzco grows llama ears. I stare at him, gaping, as he rubs inside his ear as if everything was fine. \"...Healthy rule\" Yzma continues. \"Right. So what are you going to do?\" Kuzco asks, as he grows a llama neck. How doesn't he notice this?! Oh right, he's Kuzco. \"I mean, you've been around here a long time, and..I really mean a long time. Um…\"Kuzco goes on, as I gape at him. I ignore everything, except him turning into a llama. First it's his hand into a hoof, then his face grows into that of a llama. I feel something pop on my head and I reach up, to feel llama ears. Crap… Kuzco still ignores everything except himself. Then Kronk slams the broccoli bowl on his head, which makes him unconcious. \"What? A llama? He's supposed to be dead!\" Yzma yells. \"WHAT?!\" I yell. Then Yzma and Kronk remember I'm here, look at each other, then I black out. End of Ch.5 Me: So that's chapter 5! Kida: *rocks back and forth hugging a container of Ice Cream, with a spoon, while sobbing* Me: Seriously, that's getting old. Kida: I DON'T CARE! THIS IS HOW I COPE! Me: *rolls eyes* So, check out my Doll Divine. She's in my Story OC gallery and the story picture is what she looks like as a llama Kida: I better not look ugly... Me: At least she stopped crying… Kida: KUZCOOOOOOO! *sobs* Me: Spoke too soon...[Chapter 5] Me and My Emperor Me: Ok, so I banished Kida away from my AN's until she stops crying. Which means I'm in this alone. For now. Anyway, I don't own The Emperor's New Groove. No matter how much I want to. I only own Kida. Oh and the new cover image is what Kida looks like as a Llama. Ch.5 I groan in pain as I start to wake up. \"Where'd you two come from?\" someone asks. \"No touchy…\" Someone whines weakly. I get the feeling it's Kuzco. \"AH! Demon llamas!\" The voice from before exclaims. \"Demon llamas?! Where?!\" Kuzco exclaims. I look next to me and see another llama, looking at me. \"AAAAAHHHHH!\" We both scream. I tumble out of the cart and land on my back, while the other llama starts to tumble away, trying to walk on two hooves, while freaking out. ...Yep, that's Kuzco. He starts to roll on the ground after he trips over two hooves, and rams into a wall. \"Ow. My head…\" He groans. \"My back…\" I moan. \"Ok, demon llama's. Just take it easy. I mean you no harm\" A man says. \"Hey, you're that guy from earlier\" I say, getting up on my now 4 legs. \"Yeah! You're that whiny peasant!\" Kuzco says, sitting up. \"How is trying to fight for your home whiny?\" I ask rudely, walking past him to a water trough. \"Kida?!\" Kuzco asks, shocked. \"Duh\" I say, then I look at the water. \"Emperor Kuzco?\" The man asks. I think his name was Pacha. \"Yeah, who'd you think you were talking too? I understand if you didn't know Kida, but seriously\" Kuzco says rudely. I roll my eyes and examine my reflection. The top half of my face was black and the bottom half was white. The tips of my ears were black, while the rest of my ears, my neck, my chest and my legs were white. The area near my hooves on the back legs are white. Then the rest of my body is black. \"Well, um, you don't, uh, look like the Emperor\" Pacha explains, because Kuzco is ignoarnt and doesn't realize he's also a llama. \"What do you mean I don't look like the Emperor?!\" Kuzco glares. \"Wiggle your fingers, moron. Or should I say hooves?\" I say, glaring at him. \"What do you mean hooves? Is this some kind of game you-\" he stops himself, seeing his new hooves after trying to wiggle them, then he gasps. \"It can't be! Aah!\" He looks around quickly, then he runs to the trough I'm standing at. \"AH! MY FACE! My beautiful, beautiful face!\" Kuzco cries, \"I'm an ugly, stinky llama!\" \"Ha ha\" I say. He glares at me. \"You're also a llama!\" he says. \"Yeah, but I'm a pretty llama\" I say, smugly. It's true. I'm more pretty than him as a llama. Kuzco starts freaking out and Pacha tries to calm him down. \"What happened?\" Pacha asks. Then Kuzco's punches himself in the face. \"I'm trying to figure that out, ok?\" he says, standing on two legs and trying to walk. Then he face plants to the ground. He starts laughing hysterically, \"I can't remember! i can't remember! Wait a minute! I remember you! I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was! Then you got mad at me!\" Kuzco gasps, \"Then you turned us into llamas!\" \"Kuzco, I tried to defend, him so why would he turn me into a llama? Plus, last thing I remember was being invited to Yzma's diner party, but then I draw a blank…\" I trail off. \"That's right! You probably turned me into a llama to get back at me!\" he accuses me. I facepalm. Or is it facehoof? I don't exactly have a palm anymore... \"Kuzco. Why would I turn myself into a llama?\" I ask him, ticked off that he isn't understanding anything in his hysteria. \"Oh, right…\" he trails off. Then he points at Kuzco, \"You turned us into llama's!\" I facehoof again. \"No, I did not!\" Pacha says. \"Yes and then you kidnapped us!\" Kuzco yells. \"Why would I kidnap llamas?!\" Pacha asks. \"I have no idea! You're the criminal mastermind! Not me!\" Kuzco exclaims. \"What?!\" Pacha exclaims in disbelief. \"Pft. You're right. That's giving you way too much credit\" Kuzco says. I roll my eyes. \"Ok, we just need to get to the Palace. Yzma's got that 'Secret Lab.' I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change us back!\" Kuzco says. He tries to walk on two legs, again. \"Hey, you. No time to waste. Let's go!\" Me and Pacha watch him, Pacha's thinking about something. \"Hey, Tiny. Kida. I want to get out of this body! Don't you?!\" He calls back, as he continues to try to walk with two legs, holding onto the fence. \"Build your summer house, somewhere else\" Pacha says. \"You wanna run that by me again?\" Kuzco asks, threatenly. Pacha hesitates. \"I can't let you go back unless you change your mind, and build your summer home somewhere else.\" \"I got secret for ya\" Kuzco says, slyly, \"Come here.\" \"Kuzco\" I warn. \"No, closer\" Kuzco says, then he goes to Pacha's ear and yells, \"I DON'T MAKE DEALS WITH PEASANTS!\" \"Then I guess I can't take you back\" Pacha says. \"Fine, we don't need you! We can find our own way back!\" Kuzco says, determined. Pacha quickly gets in Kuzco's way. \"I wouldn't recommend it. It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way\" Pacha warns. I'm just standing by the trough watching the two. \"Nice try pal!\" Kuzco says. \"No really! I'm telling you! There are jaguars, and snakes. And quicksand!\" Pacha calls after him. Kuzco is doing his thing where he sings 'la la la' to ignore people. \"I'm not kidding. Listen, you can't go in there!\" Pacha yells. \"Still not listening!\" Kuzco sings, then he yells back, \"Kida! Hurry up or I'm leaving you!\" \"Fine. There's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia\" Pacha huffs. I sigh. \"We're both gonna die\" I say, exasperated, walking after Kuzco. \"Wait, you're seriously going after him?\" Pacha asks in disbelief. I stop and look back. \"Well, yeah. He may be a jerk, but he's my best friend. As unbelievable as that sounds\" I say, then I continue to catch up with Kuzco. Ch.5 Me: So that's chapter 5! Yes, Kida is experiencing memory loss. Please reiview![Chapter 6] Me and My Emperor Me: Sorry for the long wait. At first, I was on vacation, then after vacation i was sick for a week, then after that we finally start school again, so I've been busy with school until now. Here's ch.6 Ch.6 \"Kuzco wait up!\" I call, running after him. Though there were a few stumbles. \"The Emperor waits for no one\" he says, but stops anyway. \"Then what was that right there?\" I ask smugly, when I finally catch up to him. He ignores me and continues walking. \"Do you have any idea where we are going?\" I ask, looking around, \"This place is creeping me out….\" \"I'm the Emperor, and as such, I'm born with an innate sense of direction\" he says. \"Uh huh, and that's why, when we were 8, you got us lost in one of the Palace corridors\" I say, smirking. \"Shut it\" he says, glaring. I stick my tongue out at him. Then he stops. \"Ok...Where are we?\" he asks, looking around. \"Called it!\" I shout. A bug flies past us and gets stuck in a spider web. \"Help me! Help me! Help me!\" he calls in a squeaky voice. Ok...so we can talk to animals… Then a spider comes and eats him. \"Uhh\" Kuzco says in disgust. \"Eep\" I squeak at the same time. \"Ok. That was the freakiest thing I've ever seen\" he says. \"Creepiest, too\" I add. \"Yep\" he nods. Something rushes past us in the bushes. We gasp in fear and stare at the bush in front of us. Then a cute squirrel holding a nut hops out. \"Aw\" I say, as Kuzco huffs. \"What do you want?\" he asks, rudely. \"Be nice\" I say, shoving him with a glare. The squirrel chitters as it holds a nut out to us. \"Oh, for us?\" Kuzco fakes happiness, taking the nut, \"Why, I don't know what to say.\" The squirrel chitters, bashfully. Then Kuzco throws the nut at the squirrels head. \"Hit the road Bucky!\" Kuzco says, glaring. \"Kuzco!\" i glare at him and then I comfort Bucky. Kuzco rolls his eyes and walks away. Then he falls through the ground. I walk over and look down the hole to see Kuzco laying on the ground in pain. \"That's what you get\" I say, carefully climbing down on the branches below. \"Shh!\" Kuzco covers my mouth with his hoof. \"Mmph?\" I ask. He points in front of us with his other hoof. I look to where he's pointing to. ….We're dead… In front of us, are a bunch of panthers. Bucky hops onto a cactus next to us and takes out a balloon. Then he blows it up and makes a balloon llama. After, he takes a needle from the cactus and smiles at Kuzco, while holding it near the balloon. \"Now see where your stupid attitude got us\" I whisper harshly at him. He ignores me and looks at Bucky fearfully. \"No. Nonononononono\" Kuzco starts to beg. \"Nono. No don't\" He says. Bucky nods, and pops the balloon loudly. Me and Kuzco wait for the panthers to attacks us, but it never happens. We open our eyes and look around the pack, who are still sleeping. \"HA!\" Kuzco yells. We gasp, because as soon as he laughs at Bucky, the panthers wake up and start growling at us. \"AAAHHH!\" we scream, running away. We run pretty far, at one point we ended up riding on the panthers. The panther notices and halts, sending us rolling forward, until we're at the edge of a cliff. We quickly stand up and try to put as much distance between ourselves and the panthers without falling over the edge. \"You killer jaguars…\" Kuzco laughs nervously. \"Um. Here, eat Kuzco. He's the reason we're in this mess. You can have him\" I say quickly. \"Hey!\" Kuzco glares at me. We've been glaring at each other a lot lately. \"What? Its true. You just had to upset Bucky, and then you had to gloat at him\" I glare back. The panthers growl louder, which brings us back to staring at them with fear. Then a jungle yell is heard beside us. We all look over and see Pacha swinging towards us with a vine. We smiles smugly at the panthers. Until Pacha swings right past us. Then me and Kuzco go back to shying away from the panthers. BUt right before we're about to get eaten, me and Kuzco were flying in the air. \"AAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" We scream. \"Don't worry, your highnesses. I got ya! You're safe now!\" Pacha tries to assure us. And then we end up tied to a tree hanging off the side of the mountain. I end up tried next to Kuzco and Pacha is tied on the other side of the tree branch. \"Maybe I'm just knew to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say?\" Kuzco says. \"I have to agree with him\" I add. \"No no no. It's-it's ok. This-this is all right. We can figure this out\" Pacha once again tries to assure us. Crack. The tree starts to break. \"We hate you\" me and Kuzco say, stimuniously. \"AAAAAHHHHHHHH!\" We all scream, falling. The tree hit big rocks, to which we all grunt because of the impact, until it finally falls into the river. I'm not prepared for the river, so as soon as we're under it, I get a big mouthful of water. We all gasp for air as soon as we surface. \"Whoo-hoo-hoo!\" Kuzco exclaims, as we ride the rapids. \"Ow!\" Pacha exclaims, hitting a rock. \"Ow!\" me and Kuzco exclaim, when we hit a different rock. We hit one more rock until we start to calmly float above the river's surface. \"I don't know about you, but I'm getting all funned out\" Kuzco says sarcastically. \"Since when was any of this fun?\" I tease. \"Uh oh\" Pacha says. \"Don't tell us, we're about to go over a huge waterfall\" I say. \"Yep\" Pacha says. \"Sharp rocks at the bottom?\" Kuzco asks. \"Most likely\" Pacha says. \"Bring it on\" me and Kuzco say. \"BOOOOO-YAAAAAAAHAAAHAAAHAAAA!\" Kuzco screams as we go over. \"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\" I scream at the same time. And then we hit the water. Ch.6 Me: The waterfall is my favorite scene! Kida: THAT WAS TOTALLY EPIC! Me: Yeah, I allowed Kida back. She said if I didn't, then she'd get my coworker *cough* slave *cough* Howl to send me into a dimension with no anime! THE HORROR! Anyway, that's chapter 6. Please review! BYE-BYE![Chapter 7] Hey guys! Just wanted to tell you guys that I finished that Twilight story I told you about (or not. I didn't post that An on all my stories….)! The entire thing! I'll explain more in the first chapter of the story. I suggest you guys check it out. I'll update two chapters everyday! Anyway, now that I have my Twilight block out of the way, I'm going to start finishing up some other stories of mine. I had already promised that I'd do my hobbit story after, so I'm going to start that one! Be warned, I'll most likely not be updating until I finished the first two movies as I haven't seen the last one yet, though I may occasionally update very rarely. If I have any writer's block (which may happen often), I'll consult my co-authors, so hopefully, they'll be able to snap me out of whatever funk I may be put in. Also, to find out my writing list progress (such as stories I'm working on in order), check out my profile! Anywho, that's all guys. Bye-Bye for now![Chapter 8] It has been a couple years since I began writing and I have come to terms with the fact that I, was not that good of a writer. But that's ok, because everyone needs time to learn and grow in whatever they take a first shot at doing. I myself have grown as a writer. I have learn different techniques to make stories interesting and attention grabbing. And due to this, I have come to decide that it is time to upgrade my stories. All of my stories will have a bout of rewriting. It may take time, but I swear that I WILL get around to fixing AND finishing all of my stories. I no longer have school and my business is finally getting ready to take off. Since my business is a work at home sort of thing, I will of course have a lot of time with writing all of my stories. Hopefully it will not take TOO long to fix and finish the ones I already have up, but I make no direct promises to the time frame of it, as there are some that have long plots (mostly the ones based on shows). BUt there are some that I have completely given up on as I feel the plots I had written for them were not good in the first place and I have no inspiration to try continuing with them. I have written the list below, but the list will also be on my profile. This note will be taken down depending on the story, but only when I begin reposting the new stories. For example, I'm going to start with my Twilight story, as it is one of the few that I have actually finished and I feel needs the most work (though my Howl's Moving Castle one is a very close second), so once that is completely rewritten, I will start posting the story and deleting all the old chapters, including this note. I have made the list according to the order I will work on them (though this isn't exact as I may in fact change the list according to inspirations that I feel). Rewriting: ","Summary":" Me and My Emperor Me: I know, I know.

He liked them both but was thinking about him and Hazel how they should date but they don't want to stop their friendship. He sighed and didn't know what to do about it. He then went to bed and while falling a sleep he was thinking about Angel and Hazel. The next morning he was eating breakfast with this mom his phone buzzed he looked at it to see a text from Angel saying hey do u want to hang out? Sayer texted back sorry I can't maybe tomorrow? Angel \" sure.\" After the text he went to outside and got on his bike and went to the aquarium and then walked in and after some hello's he went to Winter and Hope. He sat there watching Winter and Hope swim around he didn't know what to do anymore he likes Angel but he also liked Hazel. Hazel and him are best friends they worked together since they were 12. He only knows Angel from boating school and that was only three months. He does love Hazel but he was thinking Hazel will never like him back and he doesn't know what would happen if they were dating and it doesn't work and when they break up they won't be friends anymore. (Hazel pov) I'm at home just in my room think about Sawyer like Why is he with her? I'm happy for him but why like him and he doesn't know I have a crush on him the girl is pretty but I wish he know how much I like him. I wish I can just tell him but I can't I'm siting here trying to read but I can't stop thinking about Sawyer what would happen if he didn't go to boat school? Would I be able to tell him how I feel? Would he tell me how he feels I looked out the window and saw how dark it was and then looked at my clock it was 10:30 then I lay down and let sleep take over. Sawyer pov I then said goodbye to Winter and Hope and went on my bike and when I got home I went inside and ate dinner then went to bed the next morning he sat in his room thinking when there was a another text message I looked at it to see it was from Angel i looked at it and it said \"hey Sawyer want to hang out?\" He did promise so he text back saying\" sure.\" Then got ready and went outside on his bike and went to Angels house. They were hanging out when Angel then goes \" Sawyer are you ok?\" Sawyer\" what oh ya I'm fine.\" Angel\" are you sure?\" Sawyer\" ya I'm fine.\" But I was not fine he was thinking about Hazel and Angel he didn't know what to do he liked them both. After a while Sawyer goes\" Angel I'm going to go I will see you later bye.\" Then left but didn't go home he went to the beach and sat there watching the waves still thanking about the two girls when he heard something coming he turned around and saw Kyle. Kyle then sat there and no one said a word after five minutes Kyle then goes \" what are you doing here?\" Sawyer\" thinking how did you find me?\" Kyle\" I was here already walking around until I saw you here.\" Sawyer didn't say a word when Kyle goes \" what are you thinking about Angel?\" Sawyer looked at him and then asked \" her and Hazel and how did you know?\" Kyle\" I just know why is there something wrong?\" Sawyer \" no I like Angel but...\" Kyle\" but you have a crush on Hazel right?\" Sawyer\" how do you know that?\" Kyle\" everyone knows but you two.\" Sawyer looked at him then at the waves then finally he asked I don't know if I should date Angel anymore I love them both but if I date Hazel and we break up our friendship will be broke too what should I do?\" Kyle \" Sawyer what I want you to do is follow your heart and listen to it and see what it is telling you.\" Sawyer\" thanks Kyle.\" Kyle \" no problem lets get home it's getting late.\" The two then started walking to Kyle's car.

Wild Rippling Water by snarkypants The room to which Mrs. Floyd led him was the same one where Mattie Ross had slept years before. Grandma Turner was not now in evidence, but there remained a lingering scent of camphor oil in the room. It had taken him six bits to be rid of Grandma Turner for the duration of his interview with Mattie Ross. The old woman had protested at first, insisting that the girl needed her nearby for the sake of propriety, but she changed her tune when he withdrew his coin purse. As soon as the coins were in her knurled arthritic hands she was out of the bed and down the stairs with a speed that surprised him, leaving him alone with the girl. The old woman's mercenary turn had been disturbing. On one hand, it made his work easier, but what if he had been the sort of man to take advantage? Mattie Ross was fortunate, indeed, that he did not pursue his thought of stealing a kiss. No one would have blamed him for stealing more than a kiss, since she had removed herself from the safety of her family, and had behaved with unfeminine willfulness withal. He had set out to scare her, to intimidate her into compliance, first with his presence and, that failing, with his words. Neither had worked. The girl's saucy manner might easily have provoked a lesser man, a man without LaBoeuf's scruples, into ungentlemanly behavior. \"Have you been here before, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Mrs. Floyd asked, looking at him with a narrowed eye. \"I have, ma'am. About five years ago.\" She smiled beneficently, mystery solved. \"Oh, I never forget a face,\" she said. \"I may not be handy with names, but once I have seen a face it is locked in my memory forever. What brings you back to Fort Smith?\" \"I am testifying before Judge Parker's court.\" \"You are the Texas Ranger, yes, I remember now. You were here about the business with that poor girl and her father.\" \"'Poor girl,'\" he echoed. \"Do you mean Mattie Ross?\" \"Oh, yes, that was her name.\" \"Last I heard about her was that she was expected to recover.\" \"She did recover, but the doctor had to take her arm, the poor little thing. I saw her as they put her on the train for home, and I declare you have never seen anything so pitiful in your life before. We gathered up half the town to bid her farewell.\" The Mattie Ross he had known would not have liked that. He could picture her easily, stone-faced and glaring at the ostensible well-wishers. \"Do you hear any more of her?\" Mrs. Floyd's eyes lit up, and her smile became even more cloying. \"Well, sir, I do not hear much from Dardanelle, but I can tell you that your Miss Ross is at home and unmarried still.\" \"That is not what—\" he began, but Mrs. Floyd was off and running. \"I swan that is precisely what that poor girl needs: a good, Christian man who will take her on despite her defects.\" Her face creased with some garish swell of emotion. \"Oh, God bless you, sir.\" He cleared his throat. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" he said, and moved toward the door, hoping she would take the hint. She did, but as he was closing the door she stuck her head back into the room. \"If you would like paper and ink to write her they are in the parlor downstairs. I will just add a dime to your keep.\" Monarch Boarding House Fort Smith, Arkansas April 13 th , 1885 Dear Madam: May I call on you and your family on the afternoon of Thursday, the 16 th of April? I am in Fort Smith on business, and at its conclusion, if welcome, would take the train the short distance to Dardanelle happily to renew my acquaintance. Respectfully yours, G. J. LaBoeuf The return letter arrived the following evening, written in a delicate, spidery hand, with the loops pulled so thin as to be almost invisible. Dardanelle, Arkansas April 14 th , 1885 Dear Sir: You are indeed most welcome to call on us Thursday. We will expect you at some time after four in the afternoon. If you are not too greatly detained by travel, you are cordially invited to join us for supper, which will be ready at six that evening. Yours sincerely, Mary Ross Once in Dardanelle LaBoeuf installed himself in a respectable-looking boarding house not far from the station. The proprietress, Mrs. Hayden was neither as garrulous nor as parsimonious as Mrs. Floyd at the Monarch had been, and her maid brought him a bowl of hot water and a small looking glass without requiring him to explain why he wished to look as well as he might. When he had chosen the Monarch back in Fort Smith he forgotten both the sparse quality of Mrs. Floyd's bill of fare and the landlady's innate officiousness, else he might have chosen another boarding house. His only excuse was that when he disembarked the train, groggy and fatigued with the day's travel, the familiarity of the house had been a spur moving him onwards, so to speak. Of course, if he had chosen another boarding house he would not have heard more about the girl Mattie… or Miss Ross, as he supposed he should now call her. He dressed himself in his spare shirt. This, like his neckerchief, was freshly laundered; he had learned that laundry was one service that Mrs. Floyd provided well, although it came dear, and the knowing look she gave him almost convinced him to give up the enterprise. He buttoned up his waistcoat and gave a cursory shine to his badge of office. After giving the jacket of his court suit a good shaking out he decided that it was still up to standards. It smelled of cigar smoke, but such things were to be expected when travelling. If he were at home (or what passed for home these days), he would have taken a brush to the dark brown corduroy, but as with the smoke this could not be helped. The short walk to the Ross house was pleasant, especially after being cooped up in either a train or a courtroom for several days. It was just warm enough that he did not miss his buckskins and flannels, just cool enough that he did not break a sweat. He was unaccustomed to journeying without a horse, and every so often on this trip he had caught himself wondering how Pablo fared in the train's livestock car or at the town's livery stable, before he remembered that the gelding was in the troop herd in Texas, unaware of either LaBoeuf's absence or concern. The turning of the road amidst a small grove of pecan trees was just as he had remembered it. The house, too, with its tidy outbuildings and garden, was much the same. A well-appointed buggy sat near the barn, with a pair of well-matched bays harnessed to it. The last time he had been here, Mattie's younger brother had met him out front, chattering about horses and looking with wide, impressed eyes at his gun rig and the Sharps Carbine on his saddle. Her younger sister had hidden herself behind the front door as he spoke with Mrs. Ross, peeping out at him with one eye. Neither child was now in evidence; he walked up to the door in silence. Mattie opened the door with a pleasing eagerness, but then she just stared at him, as though he had materialized from the ether. He removed his hat and she blinked a few times, as though not quite trusting her eyes. \"Good heavens, it is Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she finally said, weakly at that. \"'Good heavens'?\" he echoed, feeling a prickling of the annoyance she had engendered in him years ago. \"I am not given to dropping in without warning, Miss Ross; I assure you, I was invited.\" She shook her head, and tried to smile at him. \"Of course you are. Is it Thursday? Forgive my manners; we have had some upheaval here in the past few days, and I was supposing… well, I thought to see my brother or my sister at the doorstep, not you, a friend.\" He accepted the apology with a curt nod, and took her in with a shock of his own. His eye went to the left sleeve of her blouse: nonexistent from the elbow down, the truncated sleeve sewn shut so as not to waste fabric on an empty forearm. His heart made a sick little thump in his chest. The gossipy Mrs. Floyd had the right of it. He realized that he had been somehow expecting to see the same young girl he had last seen in the Winding Stair Mountains, still whole and still wearing her childish short skirts and braids. He could not account for it, but all of a sudden he felt ancient. She was no prettier than she had been as a girl, but there was brilliancy to her complexion that somehow offset her stern bearing. She bore not one superfluous scrap of ornament on her person. Mattie had grown tall and slender, and the color and cut of her simple ash-grey gown suited her angular frame and haughty face far better than would the doll-like excesses of flounces and ringlets worn by fashionable young women. \"It would be wrong for me to turn you back when you have come so far out of your way,\" she was saying, \"but you may not wish to remain, and I would not begrudge you for it at all.\" \"Begrudge me… what, exactly? What has happened?\" She brought her thin hand to her forehead and pressed with her fingertips. \"There is some, ah, difficulty with my sister and as a result there is some difficulty with my brother and therefore with my mother. As a result of all these, the family supper that was promised you may be little more than the 'dinner of herbs,' but I will do my best.\" She paused to take a breath and she smiled at him. \"Please forgive my grumbling. It does me good to see you so well, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Can I be of some assistance?\" he asked, more from politeness than anything else. \"I very much doubt it, but thank you for asking.\" She paused. \"This is your last chance to withdraw, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"I am made of sterner stuff than that, Miss Ross.\" \"I do remember it; 'ever stalwart,' indeed.\" She offered him her hand to shake, and he took it. \"Please come in.\" She admitted him into a darkened parlor where an agitated Mrs. Ross sat in state; she was now but a frail rendering of the woman he had met five years ago. The shades were drawn and the lamps were lit, giving everything the aspect of twilight, and it took his eyes a few moments to adjust. An older man, bald but for a luxurious sweep of silvery moustaches, sat nearest Mrs. Ross; he rose when Mattie and LaBoeuf entered the room. \"Mama, you remember Mr. LaBoeuf, of course.\" Mrs. Ross nodded, and murmured, \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" and LaBoeuf dipped his head toward her. \"Mr. Daggett, allow me to introduce to you Mr. LaBoeuf of the Texas Rangers,\" Mattie said. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, Mr. Daggett, our attorney and a dear family friend.\" After a fleeting assessing look and a nod the men shook hands. \"Please do be seated,\" she said, and Daggett took his seat without pause. This, then, was how the house was run: Mattie in charge. \"Can I get you something to drink?\" \"I am comfortable, thank you,\" LaBoeuf said, sitting at the other end of the settee from Daggett, his hat in his lap. Mattie took up the other parlor chair by the stove. \"Please do not keep me in suspense, Mr. LaBoeuf; I must know what news you have,\" Mrs. Ross said. \"I would not willfully keep you in suspense, ma'am, but I do not know what you are talking about.\" He saw Daggett and Mattie exchange a glance and then she took a deep breath and spoke. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, my younger sister Victoria has eloped with a man of… uncertain character.\" \"There must be some misunderstanding, Mattie,\" Mrs. Ross piped in a tremulous voice. \"Victoria is a good girl; she would not purposely cause me such worry.\" \"Mama, there is no misunderstanding; she wrote the letter herself.\" Mattie's voice was gentle but firm. \"Perhaps she was compelled away from home, and here is good Mr. LaBoeuf to bring her home again.\" He could not school his features quickly enough to conceal his dismay; the look Mattie turned on him was both amused and pitying, as if to say, \"Do you see what you have gotten yourself into?\" \"You must read the letter, Mr. LaBoeuf; you can assess its credibility,\" Mrs. Ross said. She began to look about her for the letter, which served only to increase her agitation when she could not lay hands on it at once. \"Oh! Oh! Where is it?\" \"I have it, Mama,\" Mattie said, pulling it from her pocket. \"Oh, Mattie! Do you not see how vexed I am?\" The older woman was nearly in tears, wringing her hands together. \"Yes, Mama, I do see. I am sorry.\" Her tone was softer than LaBoeuf had ever heard it, and she exchanged another of those odd glances with Daggett. She rose to pass the letter to LaBoeuf, and he rose to accept it. He read it with some difficulty; the room was dark and Victoria's handwriting was uneven, with numerous inkblots marring the page. Mama sence you & Mattie will not let us Marry Stephen and I are Gone Away into Indin Territory where You Cannot Find Us. Good-bye. Yr Daughter Victoria He looked back up again, to see Mrs. Ross's eager eyes following his every move. It was uncharitable of him to compare her expression to a big-eyed spaniel awaiting a treat, but the resemblance did occur to him. \"Mrs. Ross—\" he began. \"Do you not see?\" she said. \"She must have been coerced.\" LaBoeuf looked to Mattie for guidance, and she shrugged. \"Ma'am, I see no clear indication of coercion here,\" he said. \"It is possible—\" he began again, only to be cut off once more. Mrs. Ross burst into tears. \"You are all so inclined to believe the worst.\" For such a fragile thing she was on her feet and out the door before LaBoeuf could even do her the courtesy of rising. Mattie gave them both a pained look before following her mother. LaBoeuf just stood there for a moment, feeling awkwardly as though he ought to apologize for something, but for what, and to whom? Daggett, who had also risen to his feet, looked at LaBoeuf as they seated themselves once more. \"Do not be alarmed; Mrs. Ross will be better now. Mattie will give her a medicine for her nerves, and she will sleep.\" As the 'formal call' appeared to be over, LaBoeuf set his hat on the floor by his feet. \"How long has all this been going on?\" \"With Victoria, you mean? Mattie discovered the letter yesterday morning.\" \"They are for Indian Territory? I wish them joy of it; the Nations do not permit elopers to remain there.\" Daggett nodded, looking at LaBoeuf with a growing respect. \"Those are my thoughts exactly.\" \"Where is the brother?\" \"Frank is on the trail after them, with naught but a horse and a pistol and ten dollars cash; that is but one of the things we are keeping dark from Mrs. Ross.\" \"Mattie—Miss Ross, I mean—I am surprised that she did not go.\" \"She meant to, but… if I may be blunt, her deformity makes it impossible for her to mount up without some assistance, which I believe is a blessing in disguise. She would have taken the gig but I finally convinced her that Babcock is unlikely to take the main roads. She could pass them by and never know it.\" \"Who is this fellow? Miss Ross called him a man of 'uncertain character,' but if he has eloped with the girl I would say there is nothing 'uncertain' about it.\" \"Stephen P. Babcock, he called himself. He claimed to be from Memphis, but Mattie had some doubts, so I had my man of business in that city make some discreet enquiries about him, to no avail.\" \"You learned no ill of him, you mean?\" \"I learned nothing of him at all. If he ever lived in Memphis, it was not as 'Stephen Babcock.' A man named 'Stephen Peter Babbitt' lived there a few years back, but I cannot confirm that they are the same man.\" LaBoeuf leaned forward, resting his elbows on his knees. \"I have heard of a 'Stinky Pete' Babbitt,\" he said, almost musing to himself. \"His name is on the Texas adjutant general's fugitive list.\" \"You are certain of this?\" \"Quite certain; when I draw a 'herd day' I take the fugitive list with me to read while I watch the stock. I have seen that name many times.\" \"What is he wanted for?\" \"Stock theft. As I recall the bounty was 'small potatoes,' say two hundred.\" \"I will pay you another two hundred to help me catch up to him and bring my sister and brother home,\" Mattie said from the doorway. He and Daggett both rose to their feet again, but she motioned for them to sit as she closed the door behind her. \"Mattie, no,\" Daggett said with a groan. \"Your poor mother cannot take the strain of having all of you away at once.\" Mattie's face creased briefly, but after a glance at Daggett she spoke as though the lawyer had said nothing. \"If we do not get Babcock or Victoria but we keep Little Frank from killing him, I will pay you one hundred dollars.\" \"You are making the presumption that Babcock and Babbitt are the same man, which is pure conjecture at this point,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Tell me what you know of Babcock. Is he a criminal?\" \"He has lured my young sister away from the protection of her home and family; is that not sufficiently wicked?\" \"It is disgraceful, but I presume the young lady is of legal age for marriage.\" Mattie clamped her lips together, making a thin line of them. \"She is fifteen, so she would be if Mama gives her consent. Which she does not,\" she added. \"What is your objection to the man?\" There was something furtive in her expression, but he could not quite identify it. Her gaze sought out Daggett's for a moment before sliding back to LaBoeuf. \"He is shiftless and a Papist.\" \"He has Romish tendencies? Now that is criminal,\" LaBoeuf said, smirking at the arrogant look Mattie gave him. \"Oh, I am not opposed to Papists on principle; they are welcome to their idols and their beads, but Victoria is a Presbyterian and she cannot marry him.\" Somehow that did not ring quite true to LaBoeuf, so he pushed harder. \"Is that all? I find that hard to believe. Perhaps he was your beau, Miss Ross, and then threw you over for your sister. Could that account for your ardor in this?\" Her lip curled. \"Far from it; I think you will allow that I am not such a fool as to be taken in by a pretty stranger with fancy clothes and fancier talk.\" He shrugged, holding her gaze. \"Everyone has some sort of a weakness.\" \"That is not my weakness; I am trying to protect my sister from an imprudent marriage.\" \"There are worse things, Miss Ross.\" Her face colored. \"I am not as ignorant as you seem to think. Marriage will be the lesser of several evils if we do not find them.\" He cleared his throat. \"Miss Ross… Mattie… Your sister would not be the first good girl to forget herself, not by a long shot. You may need to resign yourself to having a Catholic brother-in-law.\" She looked back to Daggett, who seemed to shrug, holding his hands open, and then she took a deep breath. \"Mama does not know it, but this man Babbitt left a wife in Memphis. If he and Babcock are one and the same he means to commit bigamy, or he does not intend to marry Victoria at all.\" A/N: Presbyterians really were forbidden from marrying Catholics at this time. LaBoeuf's belief that Mattie's actions could 'provoke' a man into ungentlemanly behavior was the thinking of the times, not the author's opinion (which is that no one deserves to be sexually assaulted, no matter what). I have set this story in 1885, five years after the action of the film. This may be a controversial choice, but my thinking was this: LaBoeuf goes to war when he's 15 and sees six months of service before the surrender in 1865. For me, that put his date of birth in 1850. The book describes him as being in his 30s, so I guessed the story to be taking place in 1880. The filmmakers/crew on the Blu-ray disc variously describe the year as 1876 and 1878 (with fashions from the 1860s, oddly), and the titles to some of the featurettes indicate that the date was 1880. In the absence of a definite date, I chose my own. Neener neener neener.[Chapter 2] Wild Rippling Water by snarkypants Chapter 2 With hearts and thanks to jenbachand. At length Lawyer Daggett stood. \"Well, Mattie, I am wanted in town; may I convey you back to your lodgings, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" LaBoeuf appeared to be on the verge of accepting, but Mattie spoke up. \"I cannot let him go back without a meal; he will have missed supper at Mrs. Hayden's.\" Daggett paused long enough that Mattie heard the unspoken demur in it. \"Very well, then. Send word if you hear anything further. Good evening to you.\" Mattie walked Daggett to the door. \"Take care, Mattie,\" he said, pinning her with his scrutiny. Mattie rarely saw the J. Noble Daggett that the steamboat owners saw when he excoriated them in court; the man she had known from her childhood had a jolly smile and a tolerant expression. She saw now how very flinty his eyes could be when he was delivering a warning. \"Do not worry, Mr. Daggett,\" she said, trying to soothe his ruffled feathers. \"Mr. LaBoeuf is a gentleman, and my mother is just down the hall.\" He worried at his lower lip with his teeth, causing his moustaches to undulate like a caterpillar wriggling across a leaf. \"Mattie, with your father gone and your mother ill, it falls to me to advise you in this: it will do your reputation no good for you to go off into the wilderness alone with this man.\" She sighed, impatient. \"What other option is open to me, Mr. Daggett? And I trust Mr. LaBoeuf unreservedly; perhaps you can forget that he saved my life in the Winding Stair Mountains, but I cannot.\" \"You were a child to him then, but like any man he is only as good as the woman he is with.\" \"Since I am generally accounted 'good,' or at the very least 'off-putting,' I do not foresee a problem.\" He shook his head, clearly still perturbed. \"Take care,\" he said again, taking his hat from her. \"I will.\" \"Please convey my respects to your mother.\" \"Of course.\" LaBoeuf was solemn when she returned to the parlor. \"I do not mean to cause trouble for you,\" he said. \"You have not caused any trouble for me,\" she said. \"I feel it keenly that you should be lured all the way out here on that train for such mean hospitality.\" \"I have endured worse, I assure you.\" \"Of that I have little doubt, but you are in Arkansas now and this is a point of pride.\" She paused, biting her lip. \"Would you be so good as to join me in the kitchen? It is not quite proper, particularly since you are a guest, but I may need your assistance.\" \"I would be happy to, Miss Ross,\" he said, and followed her. The kitchen was a large room, situated on the north side of the house where it might provide additional warmth during the winter. There was a stone fireplace that appeared to date to the time of the house's building, but the modern coal stove was probably the favored instrument; LaBoeuf's mother had much preferred the stove to the fire, despite her wood stove's finicky temperament. The walls and ceiling were painted milky arsenic green to keep down flies, and the heart pine floors gleamed in the lamplight. Mattie raised a long cotton apron over her head and spent a few moments lowering it and tugging it into place; LaBoeuf saw that it was already fastened in the back so she would not require assistance with it. Her garments protected, she fed coal into the belly of the stove and arranged the coals with a poker, stirring the embers to glowing life. \"Would you care to do some chopping?\" she asked. \"Else you could be here all night waiting for your supper.\" He agreed and she handed him a knife, and then a bowl containing a few potatoes and an onion. \"Peel and cut the potatoes into cubes about the size of my thumbnail, and then cut the onion into pieces the size of my fingernail.\" She showed him the nails in question as she spoke. \"Do you have any questions?\" she asked. \"Miss Ross, I was in the army. I know how to process potatoes,\" he said in a long-suffering voice, and sat at the table to do just that. \"Very well, then,\" she said. She lit a lantern and went out the kitchen door, returning a few minutes later with a bunch of dark green leaves stuffed into the large pocket on the front of her apron. She rinsed the dirt off and set to stripping the spinach leaves from their tough stems. They worked in companionable silence. Every so often she would look across the kitchen table to gauge his progress, and nod her approval. When the spinach was prepared she went outdoors again, bringing up an earthenware crock from the cellar; she set about spooning up lumps of sausage from the crock and forming them into patties. She dredged these in flour and set them aside while the pan heated. By this time LaBoeuf's preparatory work was complete and he was at leisure to watch as she sprinkled water into the hot pan until the drops crackled and skated across the black iron. She transferred patties to the pan with a fork, balancing them with the forefinger of her remaining hand, with the ease of long practice. While the sausages sizzled, releasing their rich fragrance of meat and sage and fennel, she poured cream into a saucepan, stirring as it heated on the stove. When she deemed it sufficiently thick she dropped in the spinach and stirred as it wilted and gave up its color to the cream. She paused to flip the sausages to their other sides with the fork, and then she moved the creamed spinach to the back of the stovetop to cool. \"Are the potatoes and onions ready?\" she asked, and he answered in the affirmative. She removed the sausage patties from the pan and put them on a platter, and then heated some bacon drippings in the same pan, gradually adding the hash that LaBoeuf had chopped. She stirred the potatoes until they were golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside, and then she moved the pan off the burner. It took some doing, but LaBoeuf was able to convince Mattie that he would be more comfortable eating in the kitchen than in the dining room, as it was just the two of them. \"Let me check on Mama; she may wish to join us,\" she said, ducking out of the room. LaBoeuf served plates for both of them and put them on the table, and waited for Mattie's return. \"She is fast asleep,\" Mattie said after a few moments; her skirts made a rustling noise against the door frame. She had removed her apron, and she hung it on a hook by the door. It was a simple, wholesome meal, and LaBoeuf ate until his ribs creaked, sopping up the residue on his plate with pieces of sourdough bread slathered with sweet butter. \"Thank you, Miss Ross,\" he said, pushing away his plate. \"I cannot remember the last time I had such a good supper. The food we get in camp is little better than bully beef, often salted to within an inch of its life, and there is little to no produce to be had.\" \"It is a pity that Victoria is not here; she is the true cook in the family,\" Mattie said, and then her expression darkened. The tin percolator on the stove wheezed and gasped, drawing her attention away from her thoughts. \"You are worried about her,\" he said, and she nodded. \"Did you have any indication your sister was making plans with Babcock?\" \"Not at all; Mama had invited him to dinner the night before, and nothing seemed amiss. Victoria admired him, but not in the silly way she has with the local boys; I thought it was a good thing, for the most part. Mr. Babcock and Mama sat in the parlor while we did the dishes and Frank tended the animals. Victoria sat with Mr. Babcock on the porch for a little while, and that was all. He left and we went to bed. The next morning Victoria was gone.\" \"In the note she said that you would not let them get married.\" \"That is a mystery; he never broached the subject with either of us, and neither did Victoria. I would have discouraged it since I had some doubts about him, but I never got the chance.\" \"Was there anything unusual about that night?\" \"No. Frank was provoking me more than usual, but that was because—\" she began, and then broke off, gaping at him and, oddly enough, blushing. \"Because…?\" he prompted. \"Frank was teasing me about your visit, going on and on about my 'suitor,' the Texas Ranger.\" She winced. \"That is just his way of provoking me; he also claims Marshal Cogburn for my suitor, so please do not take anything by it.\" \"Perhaps I flatter myself, but I should go a long way to be as inappropriate a suitor as Cogburn ,\" he said, stung. \"But that is neither here nor there; that was when Babcock learned I was coming to visit, was it?\" She nodded. \"It was. The timing of the elopement, at least, makes sense.\" \"Miss Ross, I think that I will wire my company tomorrow, to see if I might learn more about this man Babcock.\" \"So you will be staying for a day or two longer?\" she asked. He could not tell by either her tone or her expression whether this was pleasing to her or not. \"I believe I will.\" \"Oh, the coffee,\" she said. She went to fetch the percolator, returning to the table to pour both of them a cup. She set out a jug of cream and a small lidded bowl of white sugar. \"Well, I reckon this beats all,\" he said with a grin, stirring a spoonful of sugar into his cup. \"Do you care for gingerbread?\" she asked, and he shook his head, groaning. \"No, thank you. I will make myself ill if I do not check my appetite here.\" \"I am glad you enjoyed it; it is the least I can do. You deserve much more of a fuss than we are able to make just now.\" He tried to object, but his heart was not quite in it; he enjoyed her admiration more than he wanted to admit. \"Would you care to go sit on the porch and smoke your pipe while I clean the dishes?\" \"I believe I will take you up on that,\" he said. \"What about your stock, do you need help with them?\" \"No, thank you; one of our tenants is looking after the animals until things settle down here.\" \"All right.\" \"Make yourself comfortable, and I will be out directly,\" she said. LaBoeuf looked quite at home on the porch; her papa's last remaining old bird dog, Hector, was stretched out beside his chair, having clearly made a friend. His tail wagged lazily as Mattie joined them, and she gave the beast a scratch behind the ear. \"Whatever have you done with your buckskins, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked. Her hand was still damp from washing-up, and she tried surreptitiously to wipe it on the folds of her skirt. \"I did not recognize you at first without all of your Texas trappings.\" \"This is my court suit.\" He looked at her through a haze of pipe smoke. \"Do you approve?\" \"Very appropriate for Arkansas, but I think it would not pass muster in Texas. Not enough fringes and furbelows for your state. They might stop you at the border and forbid you re-entry.\" \"Do not fear on that score; my buckskins are in my valise, back in town.\" \"You relieve my mind.\" \"Until I got to Fort Smith I was unaware that you had, ah, lost your arm,\" he said haltingly, ducking his head a little. \"I am sorrier than I can express.\" \"What for?\" She squinted at him, genuinely surprised. \"You did more to save my life than anyone except perhaps Marshal Cogburn. You have nothing whatsoever to regret.\" \"Well. I call it a sorry turn of affairs, that a young girl was disfigured while under my protection.\" \"While I take issue with your use of the word 'protection' I fail to see how you could have prevented any of it; you did everything you could to stop me.\" He grimaced. \"Do you regret it?\" \"Not at all,\" she said. \"I achieved my goal and got justice for my father. Everything after that is of no importance.\" \"Losing an arm is of no importance?\" \"What is lost will be restored in the hereafter; my defect means that I have a few more challenges in accomplishing my daily tasks, but I do accomplish them. What about you: have you recovered fully from our meeting with Tom Chaney?\" \"I suffer from the head-ache and blurred vision from time to time, but that is the extent of it.\" \"Your shoulder and your mouth healed cleanly, I hope?\" \"They did.\" She nodded, approving. \"I am glad to hear it. I would like to know how the marshal fares, but I cannot locate him.\" \"Aw, hel-,\" he began, and stopped, clearing his throat. \"He came out of it better than either of us,\" LaBoeuf said. \"A few pellets to the face, was all.\" \"Hm,\" Mattie said, not convinced. \"I have heard that he married the widow Potter and moved to Texas, but that is all I can discover. I do hope that all is well with him.\" Hector sighed noisily between them. LaBoeuf hesitated, as though choosing his words carefully. \"He is quite a character.\" She darted a sidelong glance at him, taking his meaning, and changed the subject. \"How did you come to testify for Judge Parker? Surely you have not left the Ranger troop.\" \"No, quite the opposite; I have earned a new posting, and am now the most senior sergeant in my company. I am now stationed in Wichita Falls, which is adjacent to the Comanche Nation.\" \"Congratulations. Do you like your new posting?\" He nodded his thanks, and then paused, considering his words. \"I am not yet accustomed to the high prairie. I do not remember the wind in Ysleta ever being so relentless, and I miss the mountains. There are greater opportunities for command, however, so my duties are more varied.\" \"That sounds like a mixed blessing to me.\" \"It can be.\" He leaned back in his chair, and his demeanor, always somewhat professorial, became even more so; she bit her lip to keep from smiling. \"You have seen for yourself that outlaws seldom stop at the state line and offer themselves up for surrender; this particular criminal killed a soldier at Fort Sill after we pursued him into the Nation, and he was brought to answer for it.\" \"Was the man convicted?\" \"He was.\" He drew on his pipe. \"I presume he will be hanged.\" \"That was the sentence.\" He shook his head. \"I still have no great love for the U.S. Army, but that young private did not deserve what Richards did to him. It was cold-blooded murder.\" \"It is a fine thing that he was convicted; good work, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"That is always my goal, thank you.\" \"When do you think you will hear back from your company about Babcock?\" \"By Saturday at the latest, I think. Why?\" \"We will set out on Saturday, or possibly Sunday, then. That gives me a few days to get our provisions ready.\" His eyebrows went straight up, nearly meeting his hairline. \" We are not going to set out anywhere. I mean only to alert the marshals in Fort Smith to his presence and his known aliases, and then I am going to return to Texas.\" \"You will not go with me,\" she said. \"That is what I said.\" She exhaled loudly through her nose. \"Well then, I shall have to go on my own,\" she said in a tight voice. Hector sat up, alerted by her tone; he looked anxiously from Mattie to LaBoeuf. \"Do not be foolish, Mattie. I know you cannot go out on your own, and I will not go with you. Let that be an end to it.\" \"Who says that I cannot?\" \"I do. You might be able to mount up in your own yard, but what about on the trail, where you cannot count on obliging mounting blocks or fences, or even fortuitously placed rocks?\" She was silent, trying to find an argument to this, when he spoke again. \"Put aside your vanity and your pride and leave your brother to it.\" \"Vanity!\" \"Yes, vanity. You believe that you alone are capable; what would you call it?\" \"Little Frank is seventeen; he knows nothing of being on the trail.\" \"Nor did you, but you learned, and so will he.\" \"What if he is—\" she began loudly, and then lowered her voice. \"—killed? What if he kills Babcock and ends up in prison? Mama would never recover.\" \"You cannot hide him behind your petticoats forever. I was younger when I went to war, and you were younger still when you killed Chelmsford.\" The breath left her body as though she had been punched in the belly. \"We did our duty . This is… this is merely a lark to a rash, heedless boy.\" He gave her a long, level look. \"If you wish him to remain rash and heedless, pray continue on your present course.\" \"Oh! Well, if you are so inclined to take his part you are at liberty to join him on the trail.\" He laughed out loud, exasperated. \"Haw haw! I had almost forgotten what a little martinet you are. Do you not see what he is up against? His own sister, when younger than he is now, avenged his father's murder, witnessed unspeakable violence, and survived the company of both vicious outlaws and rattlesnakes. How could he possibly hope to live up to that?\" \"Who would expect him to do this? Not I and certainly not my mother.\" \"He expects it, depend on it.\" \"Well, that is arrant foolishness.\" \"Mattie, whether you like it or not, he is the man of the family—\" She opened her mouth to protest, but he continued over her. \"—and however much you may ride roughshod over your mother and Lawyer Daggett, you are doing Frank a disservice when you do the same with him. He will be a husband and a father someday; what sort will he be if he cannot take care of himself for a few days?\" That brought her up short, and it was a disconcerting experience; her mouth worked soundlessly for a moment before she could summon the words to strike back. \"I do not recall giving you permission to use my Christian name, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she scolded. He glared at her, annoyed. \"Well, for that I apologize, Miss Ross.\" \"For that I accept.\" \"Good.\" He tapped the bowl of his pipe on the porch rail, knocking the spent tobacco to the dirt, and then he tucked the cooled pipe into his jacket. \"Good,\" she echoed, looking out across the yard. All was silent between them for several minutes. LaBoeuf laced his fingers together over his waist and Mattie plucked at a loose thread on her skirt. One of Yarnell Poindexter's dogs barked and howled across the way, and Hector again sat at attention, whining a little as a prelude to barking, but Mattie hissed at him, shushing him, and he subsided again. \"That is a good dog,\" LaBoeuf said. \"He is. My father trained him.\" Hector wagged his tail and grinned at them both, happy to be the center of attention. He stuck his long snout under LaBoeuf's hand and nudged until LaBoeuf had no choice but to rub his ears. Finally LaBoeuf rose to his feet and cleared his throat. \"Thank you for a fine meal and your good company, Miss Ross.\" She looked skeptically at him, but he appeared and sounded sincere. Shaking her head in wonderment, she replied in a mild tone, \"If your life in Texas renders this a fine meal and me good company you may need to consider relocating, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"I believe the appropriate reply is 'you're welcome,' Miss Ross.\" Now he appeared smug. She scowled at him. \"You're welcome.\" He grinned at her, and put on his hat. \"Good night, Miss Ross.\" \"Good night, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" The dog followed LaBoeuf until he got to the fence and Mattie called him back. She watched LaBoeuf walk away until he had passed the stand of pecan trees and was out of sight. In the privacy of his room at Mrs. Hayden's boarding house, LaBoeuf withdrew a little leather-bound diary he kept in his pocket. Due perhaps to his advancing years, or perhaps to the blow to the head he sustained in apprehension of Chelmsford, he no longer cared to rely exclusively on memory for important facts. He saw no reason to advertise this. His pencil was still sharp enough from his notations on the cost of his bed and board in Ft. Smith and his train ticket to Dardanelle. In neat, economical script he wrote: \" In Dardanelle, Ark. Stephen P. Babcock eloped into Choctaw Nation with Miss Victoria Ross. Possibly Stinky Pete Babbitt?[Chapter 3] Wild Rippling Water by snarkypants Chapter 3 Mattie awoke with a start in the blue pre-dawn. Without Victoria thrashing beside her in their bed she slept more soundly and did not wake quite as early as was her wont, making her feel oddly out of sorts. She sighed and sank back onto her pillow. She was not one to lie abed and doze while shadows shifted across the room, but these few minutes before dawn were an exception. She had enough time to collect her thoughts and plan what she must accomplish. Thank God that the cotton was planted and seedlings were up. Collect eggs from the henhouse. Milk the cows, feed and turn out the horses, and slop the hogs, because Mr. Harper would not be able to come by this morning. Try and get her mama up and out of bed, which would be easier said than done. Make breakfast. Weed the kitchen garden; it was looking raggedy last night when she collected the spinach for Mr. LaBoeuf's supper. Transplant the broccoli, celery and fennel shoots from the cold frame. Find time to go to Mr. Fisher's bakery for bread because they were nearly out and she could not keep up with the baking (which often required two hands) in addition to all of her other tasks around the farm. If things continued thus for much longer, what with Victoria and Frank gone and Mama ill, Mattie would have to hire out the laundering. Plan something for supper that she could cook largely unaided in case Mr. LaBoeuf… Mr. LaBoeuf. She had thought for years that she remembered precisely what LaBoeuf had looked like, but her memory had failed her in many particulars. While she had remembered his smug grin and his cowlick she had lost the finer details, such as the dimple in his chin and the vivid summer blue of his eyes. Accustomed as she was to the muted palette of the Rosses his brightness drew the eye; she would have to watch herself to make sure she was not staring at the poor man. Her Grandmother Ross had used to say, \"A dimple in the chin, the devil within,\" but over the years Mattie had found this to be unreliable at best. And really, with so many men wearing beards, it was often difficult to say for certain… She realized that she was stroking her throat with the bound end of her braid, like a paintbrush, and she blushed even though no one was there to see. It was time for her to be up anyway; she tossed the end of her braid over her shoulder and got out of bed. She washed her face and cleaned her teeth and then began the struggle to button herself into her Emancipation Waist; she could not begin to imagine the trial of hooking herself into a corset alone and one-handed. Her gowns and blouses were all made to button up the front, which afforded her a measure of autonomy she would not have otherwise. Mattie dressed herself in a simple gown of flower-sprigged cotton with a high neck. It was several years old, and had in fact once been a church dress, made for a bustle, but Mattie had Mama take in the excess fabric as soon as it was old and worn enough to be used as a work dress. As long as she could dress herself and her clothes were not so very unfashionable as to elicit comment she was content. If only she could deal with her hair on her own grooming might be much simpler. What a pity modern decency meant that a woman could not cut her hair into a short cap of curls like the women of ancient Greece had, if the statues were accurate. Her twice-slept-on braid must suffice for one more day; she smoothed it as best she could with a brush before she pinned it up. She still resembled a porcupine, though, with strands and ends waving all over her head. She emptied her night-jar into the privy, rinsed it with a solution of chloride of lime and set it in the sunshine to dry. When she went in to wake her, she found that Mama was still poorly, and Mattie had to take several deep breaths to suppress her impatience. \"Mama, I will need you today.\" \"I will try, Mattie,\" her mother said in a wispy voice. She covered her eyes with the crook of her elbow, which often augured ill, and Mattie left the room, closing the door behind her. Mattie went out to the barn to tend to the animals, and from there went to her quick, cold breakfast of rolled oats, milk and dried peaches. Midmorning found her in the garden, when she looked up from her trowel to see little Lydia Daggett standing in the yard. \"Lydia, for heaven's sake, did you walk all the way out here on your own?\" \"No, Miss Mattie, Jonas came part of the way with me, but I wanted to come the rest of the way all by myself. Mama sent me to ask you and Missus Ross over to supper tonight,\" she said, the gaps where her front teeth once sat causing her to lisp a little. \"We may have company tonight, Lydia, but thank you.\" The child's round face fell. \"But Mama invited your gentleman friend, too.\" Mattie paused. \"Oh. Well, then, I can accept for myself, but my Mama is unwell.\" Lydia nodded as if this was expected. \"Is he your beau?\" she asked, wrinkling her nose in the sunlight. \"That is an impertinent question, Lydia,\" Mattie said, tugging on an especially tenacious strand of bindweed. \"Oh,\" Lydia said. She remained where she stood, switching her short skirts back and forth expectantly. Her boots were covered with a patina of dust from her walk. \"Papa says he is not your beau, but Mama thinks he is.\" Mattie exhaled through her nose and released the weed. \"He is not my beau. Would you like some lemonade before you set out for home?\" \"Oh, yes, please,\" Lydia said, nodding and setting her bright pigtails to bobbing. Telegram sent: Dardanelle, Ark, April 17 th 1885 To: Captain McMurry, Ranger Coy. B, Wichita Falls, Tex Requesting particulars Pete Babbitt Possible sighting Ark LaBoeuf After sending his telegram LaBoeuf amused himself for a time by walking quayside along Front Street and watching the ferry as it went back and forth, carrying wagons and livestock and people. He had grown up in a river town, and even though the Guadalupe River was not quite the trade route the Arkansas River was he felt at home. He made his way to the sheriff's office and introduced himself to the deputy in charge as a fellow lawman. He enquired about Stephen Babcock, who seemed to have steered clear of the law while in Dardanelle. Although Deputy MacDonald had looked askance at LaBoeuf at first (due very possibly to his buckskins, but he would not tell Mattie that), after a few minutes of swapping 'war stories' the two men were largely at ease with each other. LaBoeuf spent a pleasant morning with the deputy drinking coffee, each man good-naturedly one-upping the other's tales of criminal idiocy. \"How long you in town for, LaBoeuf?\" MacDonald asked; he was a young, gangly fellow with black hair and a lazy eye. \"Not long; I am awaiting a telegram from my captain before I set out, so possibly tomorrow or Sunday.\" MacDonald nodded. \"Well. If you hear a set-to tonight I do hope you will come to our aid here. They are bringing Dick Wallace in from Danville today, and I fear there will be a mob.\" \"Who is Dick Wallace?\" \"A local boy; he got liquored up and stabbed his best friend to death while they were out coon hunting, but he does not seem to remember it. The dead man, Harry Fogarty, had just gotten married, so the townsfolk are pretty riled about it. We have been keeping him in Danville, waiting for tempers to settle, but the judge wants him back in Dardanelle now.\" LaBoeuf shook his head. \"That is a hard thing; it could turn ugly, then.\" \"We do not mean to let the mob hang him. He deserves a day in court. I feel badly for Wallace. He does not seem to care whether he lives or dies; he is just that tore up about it.\" \"Could it be an act, to garner sympathy?\" \"If it is an act, it is a good one. He was either insensible or weeping every time I saw him.\" MacDonald sucked on one of his teeth, shaking his head. \"Well, I do not know what my day holds, but if I am in town I will keep an ear out.\" \"That will be appreciated, sir.\" \"The Texas Rangers do have a reputation to uphold, Deputy.\" From outside LaBoeuf heard a child's piping voice, calling, \"Is Mr. LaBoeuf there?\" MacDonald looked up and called out, \"He is here.\" A boy thundered into the office. He was about ten years old, with a shock of gingery-blond hair. \"My Mama wants you to come to supper tonight.\" \"I am busy tonight, Jonas,\" MacDonald drawled, \"But you tell Mrs. Daggett I said thank you.\" The child stopped, nonplussed. \"My Mama said to ask Mr. LaBoeuf, not you,\" he said. \"I know it,\" MacDonald said, grinning. \"Are you him?\" Jonas asked LaBoeuf. \"Yes, I am. And I accept the gracious invitation.\" The boy sighed, clearly considering himself much put-upon. \"Be there at six.\" With this, he turned and stomped out. \"Be where at six?\" LaBoeuf called after him. \"At our house,\" Jonas called back, as if there could be no other answer to this question. \"How about that,\" MacDonald said. \"I lived here my whole life and I never rated supper at Lawyer Daggett's.\" \"I did not expect it myself. I have some acquaintance with the Ross family, but they are not able to entertain much company at present.\" MacDonald nodded, but then his eyes narrowed and he scowled a bit. \"Here, now, you are not sparking Miss Victoria, are you? That would not go down so well around here.\" \"I am not sparking Miss Victoria; of that you may be certain,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Well, then,\" MacDonald said, somewhat mollified. \"That girl is a daisy.\" LaBoeuf did not care to inform the deputy that his 'daisy' had run off with another man; that would come out soon enough, small towns being what they were. The business with Dick Wallace must have drawn everyone's attention for the time being. \"How might I find Lawyer Daggett's place?\" \"We are on First Street now; get on Second Street and head downriver. If you pass the First Baptist Church you have gone too far. It is a great, white clapboard house, and he has his shingle out front.\" LaBoeuf extended his hand to the deputy. \"Thank you, Deputy MacDonald; I will listen for trouble tonight, and I will help you if I can.\" \"I could not ask for more,\" MacDonald said. In the end, Mattie decided to hitch up her little runabout gig to drive Lydia home, and then drop by Mr. Fisher's bakery while she was in town. It was a fine day for driving. The sky looked like rain, which would put any farmer in a good mood provided it was the right time of year. The air was still and growing oppressive, so riding behind a trotting horse was an excellent way to cool off, and if it did rain Mattie could put the top up. Mattie's horse Opal, a flea-bitten grey mare, was good-natured and docile, so Mattie did not have to struggle to keep the vehicle going at a safe, easy pace. Since she had only the one hand to hold the reins and steer she was very cautious, more for Lydia's safety than her own; she had been tipped into the ditch more times than she cared to recount back when she was learning to drive . From the time Mattie poured her a glass of lemonade until they were in town Lydia kept up an endless stream of chatter, about her older brother Jonas, Baby Francis, the kittens living in the barn, and her mama's new ball gown from Memphis. She chirpily admired Opal, Mattie's straw bonnet, and the bounciness of the springs on the runabout. Lydia was an amiable companion, but not a restful one. When they drove in view of a well-set-up man wearing buckskins and fringes and a large, outlandishly blocked hat, Lydia commented, loudly enough to be heard all the way over in Russellville, \"That is a strange man.\" \"That is my friend, Mr. LaBoeuf. He is not strange at all.\" Lydia regarded LaBoeuf with worried eyes. \"He is dressed strangely,\" she said. Mattie bit her lip against a smile. \"That is how people dress in his state.\" \"Oh,\" Lydia said. \"Many people think that I look strange, Lydia.\" The girl scrunched up her face, more with genuine confusion than loyalty. \"Why?\" \"Because I only have one arm,\" Mattie said. \"Oh. But that is just how you are , Miss Mattie,\" Lydia said. \"That is true.\" Lydia nodded sagely, trying to square up all of this new information. They overtook LaBoeuf, who was walking in the same direction, and Mattie reined Opal to a halt. \"Good afternoon, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mattie said. \"Good day, ladies,\" he said, touching the brim of his hat. \"He looks nicer up close,\" Lydia said in a stage whisper from the corner of her mouth. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, this little chatterbox is Miss Lydia Daggett,\" Mattie said. \"How are you, Miss Lydia? I believe I met your brother earlier.\" \"I am well, thank you,\" Lydia said, like the well-brought-up child she often forgot to be, folding her little hands in her lap. \"Can I drop you somewhere, Mr. LaBoeuf? I am taking Lydia home and then I must visit the bakery, but after that I am free.\" \"Well, I was on my way to scout out Daggett's house so I will be sure to find it in good time tonight.\" \"Do you care to join us, then?\" Mattie asked. \"I would like that,\" he said, and climbed up, angling his body so he did not crowd Lydia. This also meant that he had to brace his arm on the back of the seat, which Mattie pretended not to notice for the present. She liked particularly that he did not reach for the reins, which is what her brother would have done. Mattie clucked to Opal, and said \"Drive on,\" and the horse resumed her progress. \"Miss Mattie said that you are not her beau,\" Lydia said. \" Lydia —\" Mattie began, blushing furiously. LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"That is a thing for grownups to talk about.\" \"Oh,\" Lydia said, as unembarrassed as only a child could be. \"Well, she is nice,\" she said, obviously determined to put in a good word. \"Thank you, Lydia,\" Mattie said in a tight voice. Lydia's innate sense of fair play demanded that she continue: \"But she only has one arm.\" \"I had noticed as much,\" LaBoeuf said gravely. \"What is your mother planning to serve for supper, Miss Lydia?\" \"I do not know,\" she said. \"But there is mince pie.\" She grinned widely at him. LaBoeuf grinned back. \"I do hope that there might be a goose, with lots of sauce,\" he said. \"Since Miss Mattie so enjoys serving sauce for a gander.\" Mattie sniffed at him, and LaBoeuf laughed. \"I believe it will rain today,\" Mattie said. \"When was the last time you saw rain in that sere state of yours, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"To which state do you now refer: my home state or my unmarried state?\" he teased her over the top of Lydia's head. \"I refer to your home state, of course. I would hardly presume to comment on your unmarried state, as I am resident there myself,\" she said primly. LaBoeuf appeared about to retort when Mattie halted the gig in front of a large, fine white house, built in the Greek pillared style of some of the fine old houses LaBoeuf had seen in Virginia. \"We are home,\" Lydia sang, and began to scramble from the gig, but LaBoeuf beat her to the ground and handed her down. \"There you go, miss,\" he said. \"Good-bye, Miss Mattie, good-bye, Mr. LaBoeuf. I think you are not so strange after all,\" Lydia said. He touched his hat brim and climbed back into the gig, returning his arm to the seat back. \"Do all young girls today have such pert opinions, or is it just the ones from Dardanelle?\" Mattie looked over her shoulder at his arm and back up at his face. He returned her glance, all innocence, and she cleared her throat loudly, looking back at his arm. \"Unless you want it all over town that we are sweethearts you should move your arm, sir,\" she snapped. \"Yes, ma'am.\" He complied, albeit more slowly than she would have liked. \"I do beg your pardon; this shoulder still pains me when rain is coming on,\" he said. He shrugged and rotated the shoulder, wincing a bit. \"Oh, I am sorry,\" Mattie said, contrite. \"I did not think...\" \"Do not trouble yourself; only a cad would put his comfort before a lady's reputation.\" Well. Did she not feel just like a fussy old maid now? Mattie chirruped at Opal to get her going again, turning easily at the corner to return back in the direction of the bakery. \"I did not expect a man of Mr. Daggett's age to have such a young family,\" LaBoeuf said. \"I have heard him say that an attorney should not marry until his practice is well-established.\" He nodded. \"That is what I call prudent.\" He looked past the horse to the street ahead. \"I have put off marriage for similar reasons, but I believe the time has come for me to press forward.\" She looked her confusion at him before returning her attention to the horse. \"Oh?\" \"You disagree?\" \"I do not doubt you; I have simply not thought about a subject that has so little to do with me.\" He shrugged and continued. \"I have always lived within my means. The prizes I have taken enabled me to save funds sufficient to purchase land and build a modest, comfortable house.\" \"How nice for you,\" she said with some asperity, hoping that he might take her hint. \"My habits, interests and demeanor are conducive to a satisfying family life.\" Mattie sighed. He carried on, seemingly oblivious to her discomfort. \"This peripatetic lifestyle is grown wearisome. My company rides into one sorry, dusty little encampment and before we have even met the populace we pull stakes and move further west, to wherever the rails go.\" He shook his head. \"And it does surely stick in my craw to ride at Jay Gould's say-so, protecting his millions; if I wanted to be a Pinkerton I would have become one.\" \"So you would abandon your steadfast fellow Rangers for a woman?\" \"Not just any woman; I am far too particular for that. I have little doubt, though, that I will find a sensible, respectable woman for my wife, my helpmeet and my dearest friend.\" \" Beauty must figure into your equation somewhere, of course, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said mockingly. \"Yes, that is true; I must find her beautiful,\" he said, nodding his agreement. \"You make an excellent point.\" It was a tiny, deadly little sting, like a fishhook in the fingertip. There was no way to pull it out, though; she must push it through. She swallowed. \"Well. I wish you happy.\" \"I aim to be,\" he said in a mild tone of voice. \"What occupation would you take up, if you left the Rangers?\" \"I do not know.\" This did not seem to concern him. \"That would depend on where I settled, I suppose. They want lawmen out west, places like Silver City and Tucson and Reno.\" \"This could well be your last trip through Arkansas for some time, then,\" she said. \"That is possible; if I went west I would have no reason to come any further east than San Antone, and that only rarely.\" \"Well.\" She risked a quick look over at him. \"In that case I am very glad you decided to pay a visit.\" His smile was bright with the warmth of friendship, and she could not help it; she glowed. \"So am I,\" he said. A/N: Thanks to jenbachand, my beta! You rawk![Chapter 4] Chapter 4 A great snake of lightning crackled to the west, followed by a salvo of thunder like the Federal artillery. The rain that threatened all afternoon burst upon them, beautiful and terrible as an army with banners. Mattie yelped and reined Opal to a halt, looping the reins around a bar on the dash board. \"Help me get the top up,\" she said. \"No, no, pull that hinge there, or you will get such a pinch,\" she directed, pointing. \"Here?\" LaBoeuf asked, tugging that hinge into place. He heard a metallic clicking, felt the metal snap into position, blocking the deluge. Mattie tugged off her glove by pulling at the fingertips with her teeth, and then reached forward, holding out her hand and smiling with satisfaction as her palm filled. \"Oh, we do need it, every drop.\" A gust of cool air hit them, and Mattie laughed out loud. She turned to beam at him, before looking back at the water she held cupped in her hand. She was a plain, obstinate girl, but her happiness was infectious. He grinned, too, just because it was raining and he was alone with a young lady, and he could not remember the last time either of those things had happened. Mattie tipped the water from her hand, wiping her palm on her skirt. She struggled for a few moments to work her still-damp hand back into her driving glove, so LaBoeuf gestured toward the reins. \"May I drive?\" he asked. \"I would offer to help you with your glove, but I think you would just rebuke me for being forward.\" She fought for a bit longer, and then sighed, dropping her hand, partially gloved, to her lap. \"Please do,\" she said. \"The bakery is ahead in the next block.\" Thunder boomed overhead again and Opal startled, but LaBoeuf held firm to the reins. The mare flicked her ears back towards him, as if sensing the change in leadership, but she responded to his direction and walked on. Mattie pointed out the bakery to him, and he drove them up alongside the shop. She craned her neck, looking in the windows, which had remained largely clear despite the contrast between the cool rain without and the heat within. \"I do not suppose that I could convince you to remain out here with Opal, could I?\" she asked, turning to look up at him with such an entreating expression that it put him immediately on his guard. \"Is something wrong?\" he asked. \"Not a thing, aside from every gossip in Yell County being at this moment in Fisher's.\" \"Hm,\" LaBoeuf said. \"I do not recall you being so troubled by gossip before.\" \"Gossip does not trouble me, Mr. LaBoeuf, but if I may somehow save all parties some annoyance I will do it.\" \"Sounds like 'troubled' to me,\" he said, allowing the ghost of a smile to creep onto his face. \"And that is easy for you to say,\" she said. \"For I live here and you do not. You may well be content to stir up a tempest in a teapot, knowing that you can just ride away tomorrow, but I do not have that luxury.\" \"It may surprise you to learn that I do not ride from pillar to post compromising the reputations of young ladies.\" \"Well, it would be one thing if—\" she began, and then stopped herself, pressing her lips into a tight, unyielding line. \"If what?\" he asked. When she did not immediately answer, he prodded a little. \"If what, Miss Ross?\" \"If Victoria were safe and sound and everything were as it ought to be, of course,\" she said, looking so unhappy that he did not have the heart to tease her any longer. \"I will wait for you out here,\" he said. Mattie nodded, and swung herself down to the ground, clearly unused to waiting for a man to help her descend. She climbed the steps to the covered walkway with a quick gait and a firmly planted foot. Here was no frivolous, enervated miss, he thought, smiling to himself. He kept his gaze on her as she went into the baker's. Mattie entered Mr. Fisher's establishment with every intention of purchasing a loaf of bread and departing unnoticed, but it would not go like that. \"Why, Miss Mattie, I have not seen you for an age,\" Mr. Fisher said. \"Hello, Mr. Fisher. I would like a loaf of brown bread, please.\" \"Of course. How is everyone at home these days?\" \"About as well as can be expected, thank you,\" she said. \"You should never have driven that light-colored horse out into this storm, Mattie Ross,\" Mrs. Carroll said in her booming voice, the bane of every Presbyterian choir leader in Dardanelle since time immemorial. \"Everyone knows that they draw lightning.\" She shook her finger in Mattie's direction. Mattie did not sigh, but it was a near thing. \"That is a supersti—\" she began, but when Mrs. Carroll gasped as if Mattie stuck her with a pin everyone in the bakery stopped talking. \"Why, whoever is that man out there in your cart?\" Mrs. Carroll asked, pointing. Naturally, every head in the store swiveled to look out the window to where LaBoeuf sat in the gig. At that moment, providentially, he appeared to be gazing off into the distance toward Mount Nebo, only partially visible under a shroud of clouds. Mattie exhaled slowly. \"He is Mr. LaBoeuf, a family friend from Texas.\" Mrs. Carroll's eyebrows went up. \" Texas . Well.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" Mattie said. \"Well,\" Mrs. Carroll said again, peering at LaBoeuf with an even greater interest. \"What is his profession?\" \"He is a lawman, Mrs. Carroll,\" Mattie said. Mr. Fisher handed her the wrapped loaf. \"Put it to our account, please, Mr. Fisher.\" The baker nodded and made some notes in his ledger. As Mattie moved toward the door Mrs. Carroll stopped her with a hand on her arm. \"Now, miss, you be sweet to that young man. Do not put him off with your headstrong ways, and see if he comes up to scratch.\" Years ago, Mattie had scolded Little Frank after church for snickering when Mrs. Carroll boomed out the hymn: \"It is finished! Oh, what pleasure/Do these precious words accord!\" She had chuckled about it later, privately, though, so this, then, must be the punishment for her misdeed. \"Yes, Mrs. Carroll,\" she said, dull as a mushroom, and strode out of the bakery. LaBoeuf kept Opal standing even after Mattie seated herself. \"This evening I will walk back to your home and convey you to Daggett's in time for supper,\" he said. The rain pattered on the cover overhead. \"What if it is still raining?\" \"I will not melt; the rain is pleasant to me. So I will see you after five o'clock.\" \"You will get your nice suit all wet and muddy. I can certainly contrive to get myself to Lawyer Daggett's, to say nothing of collecting you from Mrs. Hayden's house.\" He shook his head at her. \"No. I would be easier if you did not go out alone tonight.\" Mattie could almost feel her hackles rising. \"Oh, you would, would you? That is high-handed, even for you.\" \"There could be some trouble in town, and you should have an escort.\" \"An escort, in Dardanelle?\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"What sort of trouble?\" \"There may be a mob to hang a fellow named Dick Wallace when the sheriff brings him to the calaboose.\" She shrugged. \"It is naught to do with me.\" \"In my experience mobs are not particular.\" \"Do you have so much experience with mobs?\" He grinned at her, all superiority and self-satisfaction. \"Have you heard the saying, 'one riot, one Ranger'?\" \"No.\" \"No? Oh. Well.\" He seemed to deflate a little. \"I assure you, it is well known in Texas.\" \"Coming from a lawless place is nothing to boast of, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Now, I would wager that Texas is no more lawless than Arkansas when figured per capita. At any rate-\" \"Wagering, really ,\" Mattie muttered, sniffing. LaBoeuf continued over her. \"As I said, at any rate, I think we can both agree that the Indian Territories are more lawless than Texas and Arkansas combined.\" \"They would not be, if all of your Texas criminals would remain in Texas; the Choctaw I have met have all been decent sorts.\" LaBoeuf sighed. \"I can see that you are as set in your opinions as ever and will not be swayed.\" \"You are correct. Perhaps I could wait at Mrs. Hayden's while you tidy up, and then you can drive me home and be at ease there while I dress. How would that serve?\" \"You would enter a boarding house with me, but not the baker's. I find that very strange.\" \"Oh. Mrs. Hayden keeps a very respectable house, so no one would think ill of it.\" \"An unmarried girl and a bachelor, going into a boarding house together in the afternoon without a chaperone, and no one would think ill of it?\" His voice rose in indignation. \"Do not take that tone with me. You were easy enough with entering the very room of an unmarried girl in Fort Smith.\" \"You were little more than a child then, and I had been in communication with your mother.\" \"I was grown enough for you to threaten to kiss me.\" LaBoeuf's face flushed to a deep red. \"I assure you, if I had known then what I know now—\" he began, but then thought better of it and clamped his mouth shut. \"Oh, for Heaven's sake. What if I were to just sit on Mrs. Hayden's porch and wait for you there? That way you do not spend the day walking all over town and I do not offend your sense of propriety.\" \"If this is Arkansas 'propriety', no wonder Babcock made free with your sister,\" LaBoeuf muttered, and she glared at him. \"All right. If that is what you wish to do, you can wait for me there.\" LaBoeuf came downstairs to find Mattie sitting with his landlady and a guest on the porch. It was a cool, pleasant spot, out of the rain. The guest, a drummer with a plaid sack suit and a Yankee accent, kept grinning at Mattie, displaying a rack of tobacco-stained teeth. \"Well, miss, I would be happy to bring a plow out to your place so I can demonstrate all of the benefits to your menfolk,\" he was saying. \"If you would give me your direction—\" \"How is your product an improvement over Mr. Wilson's plow?\" \"Oh, miss, someone has taken sore advantage of you with that old thing. Why, most of my customers would happily string old Wilson up if he dared set foot on their land. Which he does not, no, indeed, miss, he does not.\" He grinned again, and LaBoeuf could see dark leaves of tobacco packed into his gums. She looked down her nose at him. \"We have been pleased enough with ours,\" she said. \"You would be even more pleased with mine. Almost as pleased as I am to pass the time with such a beautiful young lady.\" He was sure laying it on thick. \"Do your customers appreciate that sort of fresh talk, for I assure you that I do not,\" she said testily, but it seemed merely to encourage the drummer, who leered at her. LaBoeuf cleared his throat from the doorway. \"I am sorry to have kept you waiting, Miss Ross,\" he said. \"Not at all; I have been visiting with Mrs. Hayden and Mister …\" She paused, and the drummer stood, presenting his hand to LaBoeuf. \"Downey. I am M. K. Downey of the Harrison Plough Manufactory.\" LaBoeuf shook the man's hand, squeezing perhaps a little harder than necessary. \"I am Sergeant LaBoeuf of the Texas Rangers.\" \"Pleased ta meetcha,\" Downey said. \"A Texas Ranger, you say.\" \"Yes, indeed.\" LaBoeuf turned his attention to Mrs. Hayden. \"Miss Ross and I have a supper engagement tonight, ma'am, so do not expect me at your table.\" \"Oh, how nice. You young people have a lovely evening,\" Mrs. Hayden said. \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Mattie said, gathering up her wrapped loaf. \"Now is a good time to go; the rain is stopped.\" LaBoeuf made a point of taking the package from Mattie and offering his other elbow to her. She blinked but took his arm. When they were seated in the gig and Mattie had the reins in hand, LaBoeuf said, \"That fellow sure seemed taken with you.\" Mattie made a dismissive noise. \"I have been dealing with drummers and tradesmen for years. The greater fools among them think that I trade greenback dollars for Spanish coin.\" She clucked to Opal and they drove on. \"Oh.\" LaBoeuf said. \"So you were genuinely interested in his plows.\" \"Not especially. If he has nothing to offer but slander and flattery his product is not worth the trouble.\" \"Oh,\" LaBoeuf said again. \"Well, that is very sensible of you.\" Mattie chortled, and LaBoeuf clenched his teeth. After tolerating that ridiculous drummer's blandishments she was laughing at him ? \"You need not sound so surprised,\" she said. \"It is insulting.\" \"You can get all the flattery you want back there,\" he said. \"That is certainly true. That, and much more, I suspect.\" Mama had spent an uncommonly busy afternoon, sponging and pressing Mattie's best dress, even tacking on a lace collar and cuff salvaged from one of Mama's old gowns. That only one of those cuffs was still useable made it perfect for Mattie's dress, since her left sleeve would be tacked up and therefore unseen. In the spirit of thrift Mattie had insisted that the gown be made up with the sleeve pieced entire, since her best dress might be passed on to someone else someday, perhaps to Victoria, who would need a left sleeve. Mama combed corn starch through her hair, followed by some orange blossom water, and then she brushed it out until it shone. She dressed it in a twist that she must have seen in The Delineator , frizzling some of the ends into a little false fringe in the front. Mattie could not have replicated it even before her adventures in the Winding Stairs. Victoria at her most whimsical never would have attempted it, since Mattie would not have sat still for that long. But this was the first thing Mama had been interested in for some time, and Mattie's fear of looking silly must be secondary. \"You leave everything to me, Mattie,\" Mama said, around the hairpins in her mouth. Her hands trembled, and Mattie wondered if she had taken her chloral that afternoon. \"No one can say I have done poorly by my girls; no, they cannot say that,\" she added, almost to herself. \"No one says that, Mama,\" Mattie said, trying to soothe her. Mama stabbed the last pin into the mass of Mattie's hair, locking it firmly in place. \"Victoria should be here—\" she said, and broke off with a sob. \"She will be. Frank will bring her home.\" Mattie patted her mother's arm. \"Oh, Mattie, she is ruined. What would your papa say?\" \"He would never blame you.\" Mama walked away sniffling and then returned with bright eyes. \"You should wear your coral earbobs,\" Mama said after clearing her throat. \"They bring out the pink in your cheeks.\" \"I will, Mama.\" The earbobs had been left to her by her grandmother Ross. She kept them in a little box with her father's remaining gold piece. Mattie worked the hooks through her earlobes and tossed her head experimentally, enjoying the light glinting from the pink teardrop beads and the little clicking noises they made. \"Now wash, and you may use my orange blossom talcum powder. Call me when you are ready for your corset and gown. Whatever you do, do not sweat .\" LaBoeuf was dozing in the parlor with his chin on his chest and his hands clasped over his belly when Mattie entered the room. \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said, \"wake up. It is time to go.\" He started, blinking in the gloom, and then looked at her. His gaze swept from her feet to her hair, lingering a bit at her bodice. \"You look—\" he began before he remembered himself. \"I mean, your dress is pretty and it suits you well.\" It was; the dress was a soft sage green poplin, trimmed with dull bronze ribbons and facings and a bit of lace. \"Oh. Thank you,\" she said. Her mother bustled into the room, carrying Mattie's shawl and glove. Mama had purloined one of Victoria's more fashionable bonnets for the occasion, which under ordinary circumstances would have resulted in near-endless cries of ill-use followed by sulking. Mattie cared little for Victoria's presumed indignation at the moment, as apparently did Mama. Once Mattie was properly hatted and shawled and gloved, LaBoeuf stood and turned to Mattie's mother. \"Ma'am, I will take good care of her, and will return her home safe at a decent hour.\" \"Thank you, Mr. LaBoeuf. Enjoy yourself, my dear girl.\" \"I will, Mama. Good night.\" Mr. LaBoeuf assisted her into the gig. \"I mean to drive us,\" he said, \"if only to spare your fine glove.\" \"That is all right,\" Mattie said. She draped a cloth over her lap to protect her dress from mud and water kicked up by Opal's hooves, and passed the other end so LaBoeuf might cover his trousers as well. He urged the horse forward, and they were on their way. The sky above the trees and hills was a brilliant orange and intensified the vivid greens and blacks of the freshly-soaked fields. LaBoeuf inhaled deeply and exhaled. \"Fine weather for a drive,\" he said. \"It is. Despite all of the extra work it is my favorite time of year.\" LaBoeuf nodded. \"Are you at all fond of reading the newspapers?\" \"Very much so. We have a fine paper here in town.\" \"What do you think of our president, 'Grover the Good'?\" \"He is a Democrat, and a Presbyterian, so I expect good things.\" \"Even after that unpleasant business about Mrs. Halpin's son?\" She gave him an indignant look and sniffed. \"What a subject to bring up with an unmarried lady. Are there so few ladies in Texas that you are unaccustomed to the rules of polite conversation?\" He appeared to flush, although it could have been a trick of the waning sunlight. He tucked his chin down and cleared his throat. \"I do apologize; I was curious to see what a good Presbyterian like yourself might make of our President Cleveland.\" \"I am nothing like a model of Presbyterian behavior. I have killed a man.\" LaBoeuf laughed out loud. \"Well, when you put it that way…\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"I was disappointed to hear of it, though, and I do pity that poor boy. Can you imagine, everyone in the country now knowing the sordid details of one's birth and infamous mother?\" \"I suppose that would be a painful cross to bear,\" he said. \"As to Mr. Cleveland, perhaps New York Presbyterians conduct themselves differently, although we 'all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God'.\" She paused. \"By all reports he has done rightly by the child, and he did not dissemble when the scandal was revealed, so in that at least his conduct was honorable. What do you think of him?\" LaBoeuf thought a minute. \"I shall wait and see. I prefer him to Blaine, which is faint praise.\" \"Yes, unfortunately,\" Mattie said. \"I had high hopes for President Garfield, but Mr. Blaine, although his friend, seems to be cut from an entirely different sort of cloth, leaving Mr. Cleveland as the only choice.\" She sighed. \"It is a nuisance, sometimes, being a woman. I must wait for Little Frank to be old enough to vote for the interests of our property.\" LaBoeuf kept his gaze on the road ahead. \"You might marry.\" Mattie smirked. \"I might also find El Dorado, but I do not care to 'entertain hypotheticals',\" she said. \"Is it so unlikely?\" he asked. \"Do you enjoy teasing me over my lack of prospects? I do not wish to rebuke you so close on the heels of my last scolding, but I shall if necessary.\" He sighed as though she were being excessively tiresome. \"It is not outside the bounds of possibility that you should marry if you wish it, and I would not suggest otherwise.\" He cleared his throat. \"We will have a good showing of stars tonight, since the clouds have moved on.\" \"I suppose we will,\" Mattie said in a diffident voice, looking intently at something beyond the horse's ears. LaBoeuf looked over at her. \"What is wrong?\" \"I am thinking about my sister. Do not mistake me: I am still angry with her. But I picture her cold and hungry and alone and soaked with rain.\" \"Well. It is possible, but just as likely that she is ensconced somewhere warm with Babcock. Neither possibility can be of much comfort, I know.\" Mattie pursed her lips. \"I have little doubt that he has gotten what he wanted from her. Her virtue would be worth little to him after the fact, but the horse she took with her was a fine animal.\" She sighed. \"No, I fear that he will abandon her when she grows tiresome, and he will take the horse to sell, leaving her penniless and friendless and prey to whatever should find her next.\" LaBoeuf nodded. \"In any case, I fear that there is little to do but wait for news.\" The sun was sinking lower in the sky, making Mount Nebo look as though it were wreathed in fire. \"That is a sight to see,\" LaBoeuf said. \"It is. We have a little summerhouse there and—\" Mattie gasped, covering her mouth. \"What is it?\" \"We must go to Mount Nebo!\" \"We? Tonight ?\" \"No, no, not tonight. But tomorrow! Please say you will come. I should be so grateful of your company.\" \"Hold on. How long of a trip would this be?\" \"Just an hour or two. They could have gone there, Mr. LaBoeuf. She might be there still.\" \"Let us speak of it tomorrow. For now, try to enjoy the evening. I know I will.\" As fine as the Daggett's house appeared it was but a setting for its jewel-like mistress. Mrs. Daggett was a handsome woman of perhaps thirty years, with elaborately dressed golden hair and lovely, regular features. She wore a frothy reception gown of deep blue silk, and gold earbobs glistened at her ears. She greeted Mattie warmly and bade LaBoeuf a gracious welcome to her home. LaBoeuf heard a small scuffling upstairs, and looked up to see little Lydia waving at them through the stair rails. \"Hello,\" she called in a loud whisper. Mrs. Daggett turned to look up at her daughter and Lydia scampered back into the nursery. \"You made quite an impression on my children today, Mr. LaBoeuf. They could speak of nothing but the Texas Ranger.\" She led them into the parlor. \"Mr. Daggett will join us presently, but allow me to introduce you to our other guests.\" Judge Stewart, a tall, thin, ascetic man with hawk-like features and whiskey blossoms on his sunken cheeks, greeted them gravely. Mrs. Stewart was equally thin, but the resemblance ended there; her pale face bloomed with paint instead of spirits, and her eyes sparkled with humor behind her pince-nez spectacles. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, this is Lorenzo Perry, Mr. Daggett's law clerk,\" Mrs. Daggett said, indicating a slight, round-shouldered man with scraggly moustaches and a face like a bowl of clabber, particularly when he bent over Mattie's hand in greeting. \"My dear sister Miss Keel is visiting us from Memphis.\" Miss Keel dimpled prettily and smiled. Although not quite the vision her older sister was, she was well-dressed and moved with a beguiling feminine grace. \"I do hope you will share with us some stories of Texas, Mr. LaBoeuf. Mr. LaBoeuf is a Texas Ranger,\" Mrs. Daggett said, and the other guests made the appropriate noises of interest. State Representative William Barton and his daughter Alice arrived with Mr. Daggett shortly before a servant rang the bell for supper. Barton was smooth and dapper, with oleaginous hair and a smile to match. The girl Alice was a shy fifteen year old, with none of Mattie's presumed gravitas at that tender age. The men escorted their supper partners to table. LaBoeuf had the honor of giving Miss Keel his arm, and the judge thoughtfully switched sides, offering his left arm so he could escort Mattie with the minimum of awkwardness. The meal was delicious, beginning with oyster soup, followed by a roast goose. LaBoeuf kept his expression neutral but could not resist stealing a glance at Mattie as Mrs. Daggett carved the bird. She met his gaze and raised her eyebrows, as though asking, \"what of it?\" before turning back to the judge. \"What brings you from Texas, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Representative Barton asked. \"I apprehended a criminal in the Indian Territory, and was called to testify in Judge Parker's court.\" \"That was in Fort Smith, though. Dardanelle is somewhat out of the way, I think you will agree,\" Barton said. \"I met Miss Ross and her family some years ago, and passed through to pay my respects since I was nearby.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf was one of the lawmen who joined me in pursuit of my father's murderer five years ago,\" Mattie added. The Stewarts, the Daggetts and Perry continued to enjoy their goose and their rice croquettes and Irish potatoes, but the others seemed to both recoil and lean forward simultaneously, forks and knives temporarily forgotten in their hands. \" You pursued the man?\" Miss Keel asked. Alice Barton's mouth gaped until she remembered herself, then watched the adults for cues on how to react. \"Yes, indeed,\" Mattie replied, matter-of-fact. \"I hired the Federal Marshal and we went in pursuit of Tom Chaney. We were then joined by Mr. LaBoeuf, who sought Chaney for another crime.\" \"Despite my initial misgivings and protestations, Miss Ross was most heroic out there,\" LaBoeuf said. \"No more than yourself,\" Mattie protested. \"Mr. LaBoeuf landed a 400 foot shot with his Sharps Carbine to save the Marshal from a cowardly ambuscade.\" \"And then Miss Ross dispatched Chaney with my Sharps after he broke my skull.\" \"And I fell into a pit, where I was bitten by a rattlesnake. I would have died if my companions had not pulled me to safety and then carried me back to Fort Smith.\" Alice Barton looked across the table at LaBoeuf with undisguised admiration and starry eyes. \"You saved Miss Ross's life, Mr. LaBoeuf? That is very romantic.\" She blushed and looked down at her plate as her father gave her a stern look. Mattie choked on a sip of water. \"I am afraid that it was not romantic at all, Miss Barton,\" LaBoeuf said, but not unkindly. \"Miss Ross was very ill and very young, and I was sorely wounded. It was the Federal marshal who did most of the saving, and he was not at all what young ladies might call a romantic figure.\" \"No, Miss Barton, he was more of a picaresque figure,\" Daggett said, chuckling. \"Mr. Daggett,\" Mattie said, protesting. \"A good man, though, certainly,\" Daggett said, nodding an apology to Mattie. He cleared his throat. \"He was tall, as I recollect, but stout, with a patch over one eye and a grizzled beard. He looked a right desperado, and smelled like a distillery.\" Mattie identified Mr. Daggett's storytelling voice as a close cousin to Mr. LaBoeuf's professorial voice and she clamped her lips together to keep from smiling at the similarity. \"Oh, were you not frightened to be in the company of such a man, Miss Ross?\" Miss Keel asked. \"Not at all. He was over fond of whiskey and bluster, but the nobility of his character was plain to see, despite his rough exterior. Only someone with foul intent would have cause to fear Marshal Cogburn.\" \"Cogburn… he was the fellow who shot all those Wharton boys, was he not?\" the judge asked. \"He was,\" Mattie said. \"He lost his position over it.\" Judge Stewart harrumphed. \"They should have given him a medal and a prize; those Whartons were all mean as snakes, and twice as devious.\" \"I agree, Judge,\" Mattie said. \"I saw that Odus Wharton in Judge Parker's court, and there was no question as to his bad character.\" \"What news from Memphis, Miss Keel?\" Lorenzo Perry, Daggett's law clerk, asked, jumping on the heels of Mattie's words. Miss Keel blinked at the abrupt change of subject. \"Oh, my, let me see… my friends the Looneys gave the most delightful ball for Mardi Gras.\" \"Was it not splendid?\" Representative Barton chimed in from his seat next to her. \"Were you there, sir?\" Miss Keel asked. \"Indeed I was, but I did not realize until now that our mutual friends neglected to present me to the most charming lady in attendance. Please do forgive my negligence, Miss Keel.\" \"I am sure no forgiveness is necessary, sir. You must have any number of people clamoring for your attention at these events.\" \"Ah, that is no excuse, miss. I hope you will allow me to atone for my lack of attention.\" \"It will be my pleasure.\" LaBoeuf did not miss the tiny smile shared by Miss Keel and her sister. He looked across the table at Mattie, to see what she thought of the human drama enacted there, but she appeared to be in a serious discussion with the judge. LaBoeuf turned to Mrs. Stewart, who gave him a crinkly smile. \"If the Representative is not careful he may find himself with a leg-shackle,\" she said, sotto voce . \"I think you may be right, ma'am.\" \"Of course I am. I also suspect you might be in that market yourself.\" LaBoeuf blushed and cleared his throat. \"I hope to be in a position to marry before too long.\" Mrs. Stewart nodded. \"And how does Mrs. Ross fare?\" \"I am afraid she is under the weather tonight.\" Mrs. Stewart looked knowingly at him. \"Mary Ross was my dear friend before her husband died. I remember when Frank brought her here from California. The most beautiful girl I ever saw, with her black hair and dark eyes. She grew up wild out west, with little learning to speak of, and none of us knew quite what to make of her at first. She soon settled down, though, and made for a fine wife and mother.\" \"Yes, that certainly appears to be—\" \"Her elder daughter is worth two of her.\" LaBoeuf blinked. \"Ma'am?\" \"Would you say that you have a dangerous profession?\" \"Ah, yes, ma'am, it can be.\" She peered at him through the tiny lenses of her pince-nez . \"Well, then. A decent man in a dangerous line of work would want to ensure that his widow and children thrive after his death, would he not?\" \"I, ah…I suppose he would.\" \"You must know that the only reason that Mary and the children do not live hand-to-mouth in some wretched hovel is that girl sitting across from us. Despite Mr. Daggett's good advice, without Mattie her mother would have lost everything Frank Ross built. You should think on that.\" LaBoeuf's jaw worked for a moment. How had he gotten himself into such a conversation? \"Yes, ma'am,\" he said and turned his attention to his quail on toast. Oh, man, I so wrote myself into a corner with the supper party. What on earth was I thinking? Now it's x years later, and no one will be reading it. Ah, well. Merry Christmas to you all, if any! The saying \"one riot, one Ranger\" actually comes a few years after this time, but I love it, and I think LaBoeuf would, too. LaBoeuf tries to engage Mattie in that age-old game of \"Oklahoma Dissing,\" because, theoretically, if there's anything that a Texan and an Arkansan can agree on, it's that Oklahoma is worse. \"Chloral\" refers to chloral hydrate, which was given commonly to those who, in the parlance of our times, are suffering from insomnia and anxiety. It was the Valium of its day, and also the primary ingredient for slipping someone a \"Mickey Finn\" or one of Jackie Treehorn's White Russians.[Chapter 5] Wild Rippling Water Chapter 5 by snarkypants Just as the Daggetts' maid was bringing out mince pie and lemon pie, one of Mr. Daggett's men beckoned to him from outside the dining room. Daggett excused himself and urged his company to avoid Front Street on their journeys home if his return took longer than expected. LaBoeuf folded his napkin and set it aside. \"Ma'am, thank you for your gracious hospitality. I told the sheriff's deputy I would come to his aid if things turned ugly, so I must beg your pardon. It was my pleasure and honor to meet you and your guests.\" He paused. \"Miss Ross, I must ask you to please wait for me to return so I might escort you safely home.\" Without even waiting for Mattie's reply, he rose and followed Daggett out of the room, to his study. \"How bad is it?\" Daggett was asking the man. \"Those boys are all liquored up and spoiling for a hanging.\" \"All right. Thank you, George. If you would like you can head to the kitchen and ask Delia to make you up a plate.\" \"Yessir, Mr. Daggett. Thank you.\" Daggett turned to LaBoeuf. \"I suppose you will need a firearm, then, unless you have one tucked in your boot there.\" \"No sir, not tonight.\" Daggett handed him a shotgun and a handful of shells. \"Mattie has extolled your marksmanship so you can surely put this humble instrument to good use.\" \"If all goes well I should not need it, but I would rather have it all the same.\" Daggett led him to the same buggy and team of bays LaBoeuf had seen outside Mattie's house when he first arrived. \"I should like to get there sooner rather than later, and I do not care to foot it,\" he said. \"Not after that meal.\" Daggett patted his belly. \"Marriage is a good thing, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" he said, and belched. LaBoeuf smiled to himself at the older man's transparent attempts at matchmaking. \"Lawyer Daggett, this is not the best place for you tonight,\" the sheriff said. \"I have hope that cooler heads will prevail. If not, though, I am well armed.\" The sheriff sighed. \"Well, all right. Who is your friend?\" \"I am Sergeant LaBoeuf of the Texas Rangers.\" \"Sergeant,\" the sheriff said. \"I am glad to meet you. Deputy McDonald said you might come by.\" LaBoeuf nodded a greeting to the deputy and the other men. \"How may I help?\" \"I have heard that you Ranger fellows can disperse a mob without so much as firing a weapon. Is that true?\" \"Yes, that is always our goal.\" \"That is my goal, too. This has gone on long enough, and I do not care to have a blood feud in my town. All I want is to keep the peace.\" LaBoeuf gathered the men around. \"Spread yourselves out in front of the calaboose. Keep your muzzles down and your pistols holstered. Keep your chest and your chin up, and the sheriff and I will do the talking. Mr. Daggett, you will keep watch over Wallace. Douse the lights inside. We do not want any sharpshooter taking Wallace out before the judge says so.\" One of the men was looking out the window and yelped, \"They are coming!\" The glow of torches confirmed it. LaBoeuf nodded at the sheriff, who led his men out. LaBoeuf brought up the rear, coming to stand next to the sheriff at the middle of the line of men. They concealed their nerves well enough, he thought. The group heaved into sight and began to shout and chant: \"Bring him out! Hang him!\" \"May God be with us,\" the sheriff muttered. \"Amen,\" LaBoeuf said. Daggett heaved himself into his buggy seat and withdrew a pewter flask from his jacket pocket, opened it and passed it to LaBoeuf. \"Whew! I am glad that is over!\" LaBoeuf saluted him with the flask and took a swig, relishing the velvety burn of good whiskey. \"Thank you,\" he croaked, handing the vessel back. \"That was thirsty work.\" \"I can well imagine. I must say, you are wasted on the Rangers. Even I understood only about three-quarters of your speechifying there. I have never heard the like, and I have gone up against Polk Goudy! You should go before the bar.\" Daggett tipped the flask into his mouth. \"I have always preferred a more active sort of profession.\" Daggett harrumphed and took another slug of whiskey. He cleared his throat. \"And now I must enquire as to your intentions with our Mattie.\" This was not unexpected. \"My intentions, such as they are, are strictly honorable.\" \"Could you be more specific?\" \"I will not dishonor her. She is a remarkable young lady.\" \"Hm. I suppose you could support a family on your wages.\" \"I would have to leave the Rangers in order to marry, and I am not prepared to do that just yet.\" Daggett made an impatient sound. \"Good God, man, what will it take? You are getting no younger. You have been gunshot and had your head broken and nearly severed your tongue, and those are only the wounds I know about. Get yourself a wife and a family before it is too late.\" LaBoeuf scowled at him and took back the flask, drinking in silence. Daggett took another tack. \"To all reports you are an honorable man, but so was Brutus. What is the situation of your family?\" \"I am estranged from my father. Have been since the war.\" \"He is a drunk,\" Daggett said; it wasn't a question. LaBoeuf resisted looking surprised. \"He is. As is his wife.\" \"Your brother Henry is a respectable man, but your brother Charlie…\" Daggett's voice trailed off, leaving his meaning clear. \"Well. Charlie spent nine months in Point Lookout during the war. He barely survived and ruined his health. He does what he can. I do not like it much, but he is my brother.\" \"So which way will you go? The way of the drunkard, or the panderer, or the clerk?\" LaBoeuf bristled. \"Since I am well past my first youth, I believe the answer to that question is clear, sir: I will go as I have gone. Like you I am both a Confederate veteran and a man of law. I am a sergeant of Texas Rangers. I have served honorably these many years, and I defy you to find anyone who says otherwise.\" Daggett nodded as though none of it was a surprise. \"That is what my man in Texas has reported. I wished to hear it from you. These days a man cannot be too careful with his loved ones.\" He took the flask back from LaBoeuf, draining it. \"Frank Ross was my dearest friend in the world. I lost everything in the war, so Frank let me live in a cabin on his land for the merest pittance while I recovered my health and read the law. Little Mattie cut her teeth on my books,\" he said with a chuckle. \"I can never repay his generosity to me. For all intents and purposes, his family is my own, and I will always look after them as best I can. I have failed with Victoria, and to a certain extent with Mattie, but I do wish to see her happy.\" LaBoeuf nodded, some of his annoyance fading. \"I understand.\" \"Well, I reckon we ought to head back, then,\" Daggett said, tucking the empty flask in his vest pocket. \"I expect Lorena will be beside herself.\" They entered the house to find the charming tableau of Miss Keel playing the piano as Mr. Barton turned the pages of the music for her. Mrs. Daggett entertained Miss Barton with stereopticon views of the seashore. Mattie held Mrs. Daggett's sleeping baby against her shoulder. Taken together, it was a scene of perfect domesticity, calculated to charm a single man-or two-into contemplating the pleasures of matrimony. \"I hope that you enjoyed your evening,\" he said. \"It was very pleasant. The Daggetts are excellent hosts,\" Mattie said, although she sounded hesitant. \"What is it?\" \"I was glad that you and Mr. Daggett left, as it turned out,\" Mattie said. \"Why?\" he asked, stung. \"Because Mrs. Daggett had meant for there to be dancing after supper. But we were down to two gentlemen for five ladies, so she changed her plans.\" She grinned at him. LaBoeuf tipped his head to the side in confusion. \"But there were three men left,\" he said, squinting at her. \"Judge Stewart began complaining about his 'rheumatiz' as soon as he saw the way the wind was blowing.\" \"Ah. Well, that is a pity for I do like to dance. I am very sorry to have missed it.\" He looked over at her. \"I take it that you do not care for it, though.\" Mattie sighed. \"Perhaps if I could somehow steady myself better it would be nicer. Those men who have been coerced into dancing with me in the past often turn me so quickly that they send me crashing into walls and furniture. I do not care to be in that position any longer.\" \"It sounds as though you have been badly partnered.\" \"That goes without saying.\" \"Would that Mr. Perry be one of the men who has treated you in this way?\" She blinked. \"Why do you ask me that?\" \"He appears to hold you in some disdain. And you him.\" Mattie worried at her lip with her teeth for a moment. \"At one time he thought to curry favor with Mr. Daggett by turning me up sweet.\" \"He might have had other reasons,\" LaBoeuf said, and Mattie gave him an arch look. \"Oh, yes, four hundred and eighty acres full of reasons, by my reckoning. When Mr. Daggett asked me about it I told him that his clerk was too great a fool to live.\" \"Ah. That could account for it.\" \"Honestly, he has been clerking for six years now; if he had any sense he would have gone before the bar years ago. I could have, and I have not read half as much law as he has.\" \"Perhaps you should.\" He grinned at her. \"Hm,\" she said. \"Assuming they would admit me—which I doubt—I do not think I could convince any man to hire me as his lawyer. I do not have the sort of face or demeanor that can entice a man into doing my bidding unless I am holding my bank book. No, I will toil away in my own sphere and make the best of it.\" \"You have made the best of it. It is a fine place.\" \"All of the credit for that goes to my father. He built the house and the outbuildings, but more than that, he shared it with those who needed it. Even Mr. Daggett lived in a mean little cabin on our land for years. Up until he married Mrs. Daggett.\" \"Is that not why a man seeks to marry? To secure the heart of a lady who will make him a happy and comfortable home? I will admit, the idea has merit. Your home makes my canvas tent on the prairie a sad prospect, indeed.\" \"You live in tents? I thought you must be in barracks at least.\" \"Barracks take time to construct, and the lumber and materials must come up by train. The only timber anywhere nearby is mesquite and that is so hard that you could melt a saw blade trying to plane it. So we bivouac, unless there are families willing to take us in.\" \"Do wives bivouac also?\" His gaze was sharp as he turned it on her, and she stammered a little. \"I mean only that many ladies must find it challenging to live that way after a while.\" \"Only lieutenants and captains may marry, and in civilized places there are plenty of houses for the ladies. My last captain's wife declined to leave her pleasant home in Galveston, so he slept in a tent on the plains like the rest of us.\" \"It sounds like our excursion into the Winding Stair Mountains. What do you do for amusement?\" \"I read whatever is at hand. If there are ladies and music I like to dance. And I work with the horses.\" \"Do you still play your Jew's harp?\" \"I lost it, and have never acquired another. I miss it, though. I do like to have music about me.\" \"You should marry a woman who can sing or play, then,\" she said. \"Perhaps I should.\" He paused. \"Are you musical?\" \"My voice is true, but not pretty. Mama taught me a little at the piano before I lost my arm.\" They fell into silence, broken by squeak of the wheels and the clop-clop-clop of Opal's hooves on the dirt road. After a minute or two, Mr. LaBoeuf cleared his throat and spoke again. \"Mr. Daggett's home is fashionable and fine, but I was concerned the entire time that I should put a hand or foot wrong and destroy the silks and filigrees and wallpaper. I prefer a home to be smaller and simpler, like my old home in Texas.\" \"Oh, where is it? Do you visit often?\" \"It is in a pretty little town called Seguin, on the Guadeloupe River, but I have not been there in some years, not since the war.\" \"You must miss it.\" LaBoeuf took so long to answer that Mattie thought that he had disregarded her comment. \"In some ways. My mother died of a cancer while we were all away. My father remarried with intemperate haste, to a woman who was—and is—no better than she ought to be. I have not returned since.\" \"I am sorry,\" Mattie said. \"How terrible, to come home, expecting to see your dear mother, and find a stranger in her place.\" \"It was.\" He cleared his throat and spoke again in a brighter tone. \"But it was also the making of me. I took myself to Round Rock, to my uncle the farrier's, and spent several years working with him. I had meant to go for a drover, but my uncle trained me so as to keep me out of trouble; he said he owed it to my mother.\" \"That was sensible of him,\" Mattie said. \"It was, although I did later try my hand at droving. I managed to stay out of trouble, but my fellows were not the sort of company I wished to keep.\" He smirked. \"I wanted to believe then that people were more or less hardworking and decent. War or no war, I was still very young.\" \"There is nothing wrong in looking for the best in people.\" \"There is when those people are brutish and ignorant scofflaws. I saw little that was good amongst those cowboys.\" \"You did well to get away from them, then.\" He chuckled. \"I was never their prisoner, Mattie.\" She shook her head. \"No, I do not mean it in that way. I have found that it is a difficult thing, to go against the herd. To do what your conscience tells you is right, when everyone else wants you to just go along with what they are doing.\" She sighed. \"It is lonely.\" LaBoeuf said nothing, looking ahead into the pools of light cast by the dash lamps. \"I think of the boy in the dugout sometimes. Moon. He could have been a good man, perhaps he even came from a good family, but he went bad because of the company he kept. It is an old story.\" \"Is it?\" he asked when he thought he could trust his voice. \"Yes. But you are not the sort of man to be swayed by what others think. I think it is one of your finer qualities.\" \"You should tell that to my fellow Rangers. They say that I am a dull old dog.\" \"They do not!\" \"They do, indeed.\" \"Well, I cannot see it.\" \"In any event, my skill with horses has always stood me in good stead. It is one of the things that has made me invaluable to the Rangers.\" \"I am certain of it. Could you perhaps explain for me why Texas cowboys do not ride mares? I have wondered ever since my father bought those ponies from Col. Stonehill. Mares are more biddable than geldings, after all.\" LaBoeuf's jaw worked a bit. \"Well, I am sure you understand that it is no good to have stallions and mares together in a working herd. But even geldings can take it into their heads that they are stallions, and when a mare is in season, you cannot get a lick of work out of them. And then a broody mare cannot work hard for long, nor can a mare with a foal. It is better for us to have only geldings, and buy fresh blood as needed for the remuda.\" \"I had not thought of that. I suppose it makes sense.\" \"I am glad you approve,\" he said, a note of teasing in his voice. She sniffed. LaBoeuf drove the buggy into the barnyard and halted Opal. He came around to Mattie's side and assisted her from the vehicle. He unhitched the horse, led her into a stall and began to rub her down. He looked over Opal's back to see Mattie standing there, and cleared his throat. \"When I am done here perhaps you will allow me to prove myself to you.\" She looked at him, alarmed. \"In what way?\" \"I am accounted a good dancer and I have never once lost control of my partner.\" \"Oh, do not trouble yourself,\" Mattie said. \"It is no trouble at all.\" \"There is no music.\" \"Then I will whistle.' \"I do not care to dance, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said and left the barn. He sighed and continued to care for the horse. When Opal was cooled down and munching placidly at her oats he let himself out of the stall, extinguished the lantern, and followed Mattie outside. Mattie removed Victoria's bonnet and her glove and shawl, setting them on the porch. She felt too fidgety to sit, though, and she paced in the moonlight until LaBoeuf emerged from the barn. \"I will lock up for you, and then I will be on my way,\" he said. \"I should make the old joke about barn doors and horses.\" \"You have a horse still at home, though. Surely she is no less dear than the others.\" She made a small noise of amusement and smiled at him, and then watched as the humor drained from his face as surely as if it were a leaky washtub and she had pulled the plug. \"What is wrong?\" \"Nothing is wrong, Mattie.\" \"Then why are you looking at me so strangely?\" \"What is strange about it?\" He stepped closer to her, and she had to steel herself against stepping back. \"You look very serious.\" \"I am a serious man.\" His voice seemed deeper than usual, she thought. Why should it make her face heat to hear him say it? \"You look very…intent.\" He appeared to ponder that for a moment. \"I suppose it is because I feel inclined to kiss you.\" \"Oh.\" Mattie took a breath, swallowed. \"Well, that inclination will soon pass, with no harm done to either of us.\" \"I am not so certain of it.\" She huffed, indignant. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I suspect that you are only interested at this moment because I am convenient.\" He laughed at that, but she did not find it humorous. \"Lord, Mattie. You are many things, but convenient is not one of them.\" He caught her hand and caressed the back with his thumb, and she jerked away as if burned. \"I meant, because I appear convenient to you here and now.\" \"I know what you meant, but I will stand by my answer.\" He pushed his hat back and loomed over her, even though he was only a scant inch or so taller than she. Mattie was not frightened. Her legs felt twitchy and jittery, as if wanting to run of their own accord, but she had faced LaBoeuf down before. She scowled at him. He grinned back. \"You must think of your future wife, Mr. LaBoeuf. She will not want you to succumb to such a temptation.\" \"What she does not know cannot hurt her,\" he said, shrugging. She gaped at him. \"Really!\" \"She will not reveal her identity to me, so I see little point to sparing her feelings. It would serve her right.\" \"That poor woman!\" \"The way I feel now, I may jilt her yet.\" \"Perhaps you can joke about such things, but—\" What she was going to say vanished as he pulled her into his arms and kissed her. After a moment of shock she forced herself to remain stock still, even as her skin prickled and the hairs on the back of her neck stood up. When he released her, she glared at him. \"Masher!\" she hissed. \"Now, Mattie—\" he began, but she wasn't finished with him. \"I have welcomed you into my home, and this is how you treat me?\" \"Come now, sweetheart. I am fond of you—\" \"I am not your sweetheart! Where do you get such harebrained ideas? I have not had a word from you in five years and—\" \"Had I known you wished it I would certainly have written to you.\" His grin was as smug as ever. She stared at him. \"That is not what I meant at all!\" She wanted to stamp her foot but resisted the impulse. \"What do you mean? I have a long walk ahead of me before I sleep, so please enlighten me.\" \"You are impossible.\" She spun around, her skirts twirling and twisting around her legs. \"I will see you tomorrow, then.\" \"Not if I see you first! You can take the first train back to Texas as far as I am concerned.\" \"Have you forgotten our excursion to Mt.—\" he paused. \"Nebo,\" she snapped. \"—Nebo tomorrow? I have not. So I will see you then. Good night, Mattie,\" he said, as she marched toward the house. She waited for him to leave before creeping back onto the porch to collect her things. A/N: Y'all might have figured out by now that I am an unabashed Coen Brothers geek, and I have scattered some teensy Easter Eggs from some of their other films throughout these chapters. Not so much by design, but just because they made me laugh. I'm terribly slow at updating, and this was no exception. I have no plans to abandon this, and have plotted out and written sections for the next few chapters. Had a lot of IRL upheaval in the past year, for good (DD graduated from HS and went off to college) and ill (DH's heart attack, from which he has recovered nicely), and working out scenes in my head in the midst was a great distraction (which also led to some storyline revisions, which slowed me down further)! So thank you so much for sticking with me. If you celebrate it, have a Happy Thanksgiving! If you don't, have a great Thursday![Chapter 6] LaBoeuf tucked the paper into his vest pocket and stepped out of the telegraph office onto the road. The weather had turned chilly overnight. A fierce gust of wind buffeted him to the side, making his steps a bit unsteady. He turned up his collar, pushed down his hat, and headed towards the Ross farm. The chill and wind made for an unpleasant walk, and he was glad when he finally saw the Ross's barn through the trees. Mattie might still be angry with him, but she would surely offer him a cup of coffee. At least he hoped so. His arrival was announced by Hector, the old bird dog, who barked a few times and then walked out on stiff legs to meet him. Mattie eyed him as he approached, but kept to her task. \"Good morning,\" he said, raising his voice so she might hear him above the wind. \"Good morning,\" she replied. She was not scowling at him outright, but the set of her mouth and jaw hinted at her displeasure. \"I must apologize to you, Mattie,\" he said. She paused for a moment before continuing to work at the horse's traces. \"Oh?\" she asked, pressing her lips together. \"I was rude and impetuous last night.\" That got her attention. She stopped what she was doing and looked at him. \"Yes, you were.\" \"I am sorry for it.\" \"I see.\" She rested her hand on the horse's withers. \"Thank you for saying that.\" \"I imagine it was the whiskey,\" he said. \"You will get no sympathy from me there,\" she said. \"I expect none.\" \"Hm,\" she said. \"Would you by chance have any coffee ready?\" he asked. \"I left my lodgings before my landlady made breakfast.\" She shook her head and clucked her tongue at him. \"Everyone says Mrs. Hayden sets a fine board for her lodgers.\" \"Well, you see, I was in no mood to wait,\" he said, and gave her a sheepish smile. \"There is coffee, but whether it is still warm I cannot say.\" \"I will take it, and gladly. Let me finish up with your cart here and then we can go.\" \"All right,\" she said, and put the straps in his hands. A few minutes later, she came out from the kitchen with a steaming cup in her hand and something tucked under her amputated arm. He wiped his hands on his trousers and took the coffee from her with a murmured \"Thank you.\" Then she gave him two thick pieces of buttered bread, wrapped awkwardly in waxed paper. \"I thought you might want something to eat later,\" she said. He tucked the food in his pocket, bolted the last of the coffee, and handed the cup back to her. \"I think we are ready to go.\" \"I will put these things in the kitchen and tell Mama that we are going, then.\" They were soon under way, heading west toward the mountain. \"Tell me about this Babcock,\" LaBoeuf said after they had got on the main road. \"Was there anything unusual about him, anything to set him apart from other men?\" \"He was a smooth talker, but that is not so unusual.\" \"What about his grooming?\" \"His grooming? He kept himself tidy, I suppose. Lawyer Daggett called him a dandy, but…\" Mattie stopped, wrinkling her nose. \"Yes?\" \"He was too fond of the bay rum, I thought. A little bit is well enough, but he seemed to bathe in it.\" LaBoeuf smiled. \"Oh, what is it, Mr. LaBoeuf? Have you heard something?\" \"What of his height? Was he as tall as me? Taller or shorter?\" \"Ah…I think his boots made him appear taller than he was. He was perhaps my height, but I never saw him in stocking feet, and never hope to.\" LaBoeuf pulled the telegraph from his breast pocket. \"Read this,\" he said, and handed it to her. Wichita Falls, Tex, April 18th 1885 To: Sergeant LaBoeuf, Ranger Coy. B (Det), Dardanelle, Ark Five nine slim Brown hair beard 26 Bay Rum hence Stinky Robbery assault McMurry She looked up at him. \"Oh, Mr. LaBoeuf! That is him. It must be,\" Mattie said. \"There could be something in this for me after all,\" LaBoeuf said. \"The bounty is sure to have gone up as his crimes have—\" He stopped talking and cleared his throat. \"As his crimes have escalated,\" she murmured. \"I am sorry,\" he said. \"It is all right,\" she said, and sank into glum silence. None of his attempts at conversation was successful in drawing her out. They rode on for half a mile without speaking. \"It is my fault,\" Mattie said at length. \"What is?\" LaBoeuf asked, startled to hear her voice again. \"Victoria. It is my fault she ran off.\" \"I do not see how that could be,\" he said. \"Nevertheless. It is my fault.\" \"How do you figure?\" \"After we received your letter, Little Frank began to tease me about you.\" \"Oh?\" \"He loves to tease people, and the more he thinks it tells on you, the better. He kept on and on about how I was trying to show you what a good housekeeper I was so you could be induced to marry me.\" Her face was blotchy with embarrassment. \"I see,\" LaBoeuf said, a little red faced himself. \"Victoria was whining about the housework, and between that and my brother's jokes, I lost my temper. I asked her how she would like it if I, ah, married you, and went off, leaving her alone to take care of Mama and the farm and Frank. Well. She went all quiet, and the next day she was gone. So you see.\" She paused. \"I am sorry to bring you into it, even in jest. You never asked for such gross speculation.\" \"Well,\" LaBoeuf said, and fell silent for a moment. \"Well, there are worse things than being taken for the suitor of a lovely and respectable young woman.\" Mattie looked sharply at him, as though trying to find an insult in his words. She sniffed. \"Oh, yes, such an honor for you.\" \"It is not dis honor.\" \"Hm.\" She looked away, raising her eyebrows in dismissal. \"Have I offended you in some way?\" \"I mistrust flattery, particularly when the flatterer has made no bones of how 'unattractive' I am.\" LaBoeuf scrunched up his forehead. \"When did I—\" he began and stopped, but he still looked confused. \"In Ft. Smith, of course. When we first met.\" LaBoeuf's face cleared. \"Why, you thought little enough of me at that time. Dare I to hope that your opinion might have changed a little?\" Mattie shrugged. \"A very little,\" she said, and LaBoeuf smiled at her. \"Well, there you have it.\" \"Would you like to play a game to pass the time?\" Mattie asked. \"What sort of a game?\" he asked. \"Something you can do while driving. Crambo, perhaps?\" \"I suppose we could. What happens if I guess your answer or you forfeit? What do I win?\" She thought about it for a moment. \"A penny.\" He laughed out loud. \"I will not enter into financial dealings with you, least of all over a parlor game. If just a few questions go poorly for me I could end up in your indenture for years.\" She raised her eyebrows, as though acknowledging the possibility, absurd though it was. \"Then what would you like?\" The road was clear and flat, and he just looked at her for a long time, long enough that she wanted to look away. By that point, though, maintaining eye contact with him felt like a contest, one that she could not bear to lose. \"A kiss.\" Her jaw dropped in outrage even as her breath caught. \"Is that all you ever think about?\" \"Far from it; there are few things that could induce me to play at a silly game, though, and that is one of them.\" \"Absolutely not.\" He shrugged, and turned his attention back to the road ahead. She felt a fluttering, sinking sensation in her belly and an aching in her throat. It felt like a curious combination of relief and disappointment. What could it hurt, though? There was little chance that she would forfeit, still less that she would lose her head and be overcome by some, heretofore unknown, ungovernable passion. A rude, silly boy had kissed her once at a picnic and it had not stirred her at all. To the contrary, she had found it silly, mildly unpleasant and easy to repent, especially after he had joked about it with his friends in her hearing. Even LaBoeuf's stolen kiss the night before had failed to shake her composure. \"I know a word that rhymes with 'coil,'\" Mattie said before she could lose her nerve. LaBoeuf looked over at her with sudden alertness and excitement. She saw his throat move as he swallowed. \"Will it make me weary?\" he asked in a low voice. \"No, it is not 'toil.'\" \"Will it hinder my plans?\" he asked. She thought about that one for a bit, pursing her lips. His gaze went to her mouth and lingered there, and she had to look away to concentrate. \"No,\" she said after a few moments. \"It is not 'foil.'\" \"I nearly had you there,\" he said, and she sniffed. \"Do they make fine soap with it?\" \"It is not 'oil.'\" \"Is it how my wife might cook my supper?\" \"Your wife?\" she asked. \"What wife is this?\" \"Yes or no, or I will claim my forfeit,\" he said. She made an exasperated sound. \"No, it is not 'boil.' You told me you were not married, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"I am not yet, of course, but will be eventually. Does it describe a king?\" \"What?\" \"This word that rhymes with 'coil;' does it describe a king?\" She frowned in concentration, looking up as she went through her mental tally of possible words. \"Have I gotten it?\" he asked, and she held up her hand. \"One more moment.\" \"Your time is up,\" he said. \"What was your word?\" She gave him an irritated look. \"Mine was 'soil.' What was yours?\" \"'Royal.'\" Her mouth worked before she sputtered at him. \"'Royal' and 'soil' do not rhyme, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"They do when I say them: 'royal' and 'soil.' See?\" \"Only in Texas could those words rhyme. I say you cheat.\" He goggled at her in pretend shock. \"That is exactly the sort of talk that could get you into serious trouble in my neck of the woods. You are fortunate that I have a temperate disposition.\" \"Temperate!\" Mattie cried, scoffing. \"You owe me a forfeit, or will it be pistols at dawn?\" \"Oh! Very well.\" She paused and turned so she was facing him. She screwed her eyes shut and puckered her lips so firmly that they stuck out as far as her nose. He reined in the horse, and after looking both up and down the road, tied the reins to the dashboard. He moved himself closer to her, closer than propriety would allow for conversation. Flyaway strands of hair around her face danced as his breath stirred them. He touched her chin, tilting her face up, and there he stopped, just looking at her. After a while she could not maintain the forced attitude of her eyes and mouth. She relaxed a tiny amount, opening her eyes by a sliver. She swallowed and her lips parted. Her hand was splayed against his chest, as though pushing him away but she did not push. He covered her hand with his own, and put his other arm around her shoulders. He dipped his head down to hers, but instead of going straight for her lips he traced the line of her nose with his own. Well. It was odd, but inoffensive. Was this what people meant when they spoke of \"billing and cooing\"? She had never imagined herself being so silly, but she did not feel silly. She felt… tender. Like a fresh bruise or the start of a cold. Not uncomfortable precisely. Just strange. He caressed her cheek in the same way, moving up towards her forehead. His breath was warm and soft on her skin. She swallowed. He pressed a kiss—just a dabbing of pursed lips—to her temple and she closed her eyes again. This is how girls forget themselves , she thought, wondering at the notion. She turned her face to him like a sunflower to the sun. And then he released her. She did not wobble although she felt queer and off balance, as though she had taken a slug of Dr. Underwood's Bile Activator. Her teeth wanted to chatter together. She clenched her jaw, feeling relieved and angry and alarmed, all at once. LaBoeuf picked up the reins and told Opal to walk on. He began to whistle, and Mattie scowled. The very gall of the man! The summerhouse sat close to a small clearing, although trees grew thickly around it, shading it from the sun. Even from the cart it was plain that no one had disturbed the building in some time. A shrub had overgrown the path to the cabin, and leaves and pine needles lay in a thick mat against the threshold. Even without looking at her, LaBoeuf was aware of Mattie's dismay. She said nothing, but she made a small, choked sound, and then he felt her sit straighter in her seat. He reached for her hand, giving it a quick squeeze, and then he cleared his throat. \"Let us go and make sure, Mattie.\" \"Yes,\" she said, but she stayed where she was. LaBoeuf climbed out of the gig and went over to Mattie's side, holding out his hand for her to take. After a moment she did, and he helped her down. She walked more slowly than he had ever seen her. When her skirt caught on the shrub, she paused and carefully disengaged the thorn before continuing. She pulled a key from her pocket and inserted it in the rusty padlock holding the door closed. LaBoeuf had to grab the lock to keep it from swinging while she turned the key. With a crusty, grinding sound, the lock finally disengaged, and LaBoeuf swung open the door. The first thing he was aware of was the overpowering reek of mouse piss. The puncheon floor was littered with dust, pine needles, bare rodent bones and little tufts of fur and detritus that he identified as pack rat piles. Mattie dropped the key in her pocket, and entered the cabin. \"Will you open the shutters, please?\" she asked him in a tight voice. \"Yes, of course,\" he said. Mattie remained inside while he walked around outside, unhooking the latches on the shutters and opening them. The insides of the two windows were somewhat covered by canvas stretched on wooden frames fitted to each opening. The canvas was old and sagging and riddled with holes both small and large. Mattie pulled the frames free, allowing light to enter the cabin. LaBoeuf went back inside. With the windows and door open the smell was starting to improve. Mattie had located a bedraggled broom, and was dragging it across the floor, trying to clear away some of the mess. He could now see a hand-hewn table in the room, surrounded by sawed stump seats, a small stone hearth, and a threadbare straw tick mattress moldering in its bed frame on the opposite wall. A sturdy-looking ladder led to a small sleeping loft. \"They did not come through here,\" Mattie said. \"It does not look like it,\" LaBoeuf said. \"At the least I should have brought soap and scrub brushes,\" Mattie said, almost to herself. \"Perhaps later in the year,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Yes,\" she said. LaBoeuf pulled one of the stumps from under the table and sat heavily upon it. \"When is the last time you were here?\" \"Before Papa died. Mama is always so bothered by the mosquitoes in summer, so he would bring us up here to stay while he mostly remained at the farm, which is what I do. Little Frank is supposed to take care of it, but clearly…\" \"Clearly.\" LaBoeuf exhaled, impatient. \"He should be doing more to help you, Mattie.\" \"I know,\" she said. She nudged another stump away from the table and sat beside him. \"I mean it. I know that you have had a lot to shoulder since your father died.\" \"I am proud to take care of my family. It is my duty to Papa.\" \"It is Frank's duty, also.\" She nodded \"Yes, it is.\" \"And your mother's. And…and your sister's. If no one helps you, how are you supposed to leave and start your own family someday?\" \"I expect that I will not; I must be content with that,\" she said, her expression taking on a mulish look. LaBoeuf sighed. \"I doubt that your father would want you to live as an anchorite, tied to vows you never made.\" \"Who else is there? Frank hates the farm and will leave at his earliest opportunity. Victoria— if she comes home—she has no aptitude for numbers or cotton. The doctor insists that Mama must always take chloral for her nerves. So it all falls to me.\" LaBoeuf shook his head slowly and chewed on his lower lip. \"You deserve better,\" he said finally. \"It is neither here nor there.\" \"What if—\" LaBoeuf began, and then closed his mouth. \"What if…\" she prompted, looking at him, but he said nothing, and they just sat listening to the wind rustling through the pines and Opal and her tack shifting in the clearing. After a moment or two, he stood. \"I should get water for the horse. Is there a bucket I could fill at that pump?\" he asked, pointing vaguely out front. Mattie went over to the door and closed it partway, revealing some shelves and a tin bucket hanging on a peg. \"You will have to prime it first,\" she said, handing the bucket to him. \"I never travel without water, just in case,\" LaBoeuf said, and went outside. Mattie followed him. He went to the gig and retrieved a cloth-covered canteen from behind the seat, and carried it to the hand pump. Mattie watched as he drizzled water down the throat of the pump, wetting the gasket, and then worked the handle. It took a while; by the time water ran freely, LaBoeuf had removed his jacket and tossed it to the grass and rolled up the sleeves of his shirt. He dragged his powerful forearm across his forehead, and then tipped out the canteen before refilling it from the stream of water. He drank deeply from the vessel even as he worked the pump handle; the bucket caught the excess. \"Whew!\" he said. \"That is a good well. Cold and sweet.\" He wiped his lip with his sleeve. \"Forgive me; would you like some water?\" \"Yes, thank you,\" she said. He handed her the canteen before carrying the filled bucket to the horse. The water tasted as good as she had remembered it. He returned to her side, smelling of exertion and sunshine and something that was LaBoeuf alone. She shivered. \"Are you cold?\" he asked. \"Just a chill,\" she said. He nodded and took the canteen from her, taking another great swig from the bottle. She watched the muscles in his throat as he drank. He was only a little taller than she was, but she felt overpowered and fluttery, like a chicken next to a Cooper's hawk. Was that how Victoria had felt with Babcock? As if reading her mind, LaBoeuf said, \"I understand why you wanted to check this place. If I wanted a place to elope to, this would be it.\" Their gazes met, and she felt something sharp and hungry stab at her belly. LaBoeuf cleared his throat and dropped his eyes. \"I mean, plenty of water, game everywhere, and hardly anyone around. This would be a good spot to hide. Let me refill this, and then we can close up the cabin and return to town.\" \"Of course,\" Mattie said. She went back and began to fit the canvas frames back inside the window openings. It took a few minutes, because she had to strike one side of the frame with the heel of her hand, which made the other side jump out of place, but eventually the windows were covered and LaBoeuf latched the shutters. He tipped out the last drops from the bucket and hung it on its peg before closing the door and forcing the padlock closed again. The drive back to town was uneventful at first. They talked of inconsequential things every so often, but they were largely silent. They passed a few farmers and riders on the way, but they were no one that Mattie knew. LaBoeuf's body was warm and solid in the seat next to her. She watched his hands and wrists as he held the reins, almost painfully aware of the sharp bones and muscles and calluses that marked him as a man who worked capably with his hands. She had always been put off by men with soft, smooth hands, the Yankee drummer being the most recent example. There was something untrustworthy, even unwholesome, about them. Of course, Lawyer Daggett's hands were a little soft now, but he was the exception. When he had lived on their property, he had worked as hard as any man, and now that he was wealthy he had earned the right to hire others to work for him. When she had been a very young girl, before Mrs. Daggett had come from Memphis and before Tom Chaney, Mattie had figured that she would someday marry Mr. Daggett. Aside from her father, he had been the only man who had approved of her or encouraged her odd turns of mind. She had thought it would be a very agreeable life. That had been before she grew up, though. When she had learned enough to piece together a few bare facts about marital relations, she was glad that her girlhood imaginings had not come to pass. While she loved Mr. Daggett, she did not think she would have liked sharing a bed—or anything else—with him. He had continued to treat her with the same avuncular fondness as always, and she was glad of it. And then there was LaBoeuf. She looked up at him, making a study of the lines of his face as he drove. The vertical plane from his forehead to his chin indicated intelligence, and his strong jaw indicated stubbornness, both of which she could confirm from life. His eyes were hooded, which gave him a deceptively sleepy look until he turned the force of his gaze on her. Which, of course, he did, clearly smiling at her even though the corners of his mouth turned down. \"What is it?\" he asked. She dropped her eyes. \"Nothing.\" \"If you were looking for flaws you would not have to study so closely. I keep them right out front, where everyone can see.\" He wiggled the tip of his nose like a rabbit. \"Perhaps I am looking for signs of intelligence,\" she quipped. \"Ah,\" he said. \"You would not be the first. Let me know how you get on.\" Mattie laughed. \"The Mr. LaBoeuf I used to know would never have said this. He seemed very set on securing my good opinion.\" LaBoeuf nodded. \"He was. You were a tough customer. But I like to think that you and I understand one another better now.\" \"Do we?\" she asked. \"Very much so.\" He gave her a look that made her breath catch in her throat. \"For instance, I know that you hate to lose.\" \"Everyone does,\" Mattie sniffed. \"…And that having lost, you would relish the chance to even the score.\" Mattie just looked at him as though he were the greatest fool in Yell County. \"Which is why I would be willing to engage in one— just one —more round of Crambo with you. To spare your pride. It is the least I can do for an old trail pardner.\" This was so patently ridiculous that she hooted before clapping her hand over her mouth. \"Oh, you would, would you? What a saintly sacrifice.\" He chuckled at her, and then rubbed one of his knuckles against his lower lip. \"I know a word that rhymes with 'sweet.'\" She narrowed her eyes at him. \"Oh, very well. Are they in my shoes?\" \"No, it is not 'feet'.\" \"Is it tidy?\" \"No, it is not 'neat.'\" \"Is it the sound a sheep makes?\" \"No, it is not 'bleat.'\" \"Is it how Paddy O'Brien keeps warm?\" He was silent for a few moments. \"Your time is spent; do you forfeit, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Her face grew warm as laughter threatened to burst out. \"No, I do not, and it is not 'peat.'\" He grinned at her. \"You figured I would say 'heat,' did you?\" She shrugged. \"Is it where you keep your brains?\" she asked, in a tone that was as close to 'sweet' as she could muster. He had two choices: he could admit to her that his brains were in his 'seat,' or he could forfeit, neither of which he could find particularly appealing, she thought. He gave a long-suffering sigh and spoke. \"No, it is not 'seat.'\" \"Are you certain of that?\" \"Ask your question or forfeit,\" he snapped. \"Is it… is it subtle?\" He blinked. \"Yes, it is 'discreet.'\" He reined in the horse and then tilted his head to the side, regarding her. \"What must I forfeit?\" She thought for a moment. Could she really be so wicked? \"The same as before, I think,\" she said in a low voice, staring at his lapels. He swallowed, tied off the reins, and then rubbed his palms against his trouser legs. \"Only the one, though; I do not want you thinking I am fast.\" His eyes twinkled at his joke, but Mattie's throat was too dry to laugh at him. He dipped his head a little, and she leaned forward a little and pressed a kiss to his mouth. The momentum was all hers: she made it happen. His lips were warm and soft against hers. A bright, silver thrill ran through her body, making her shiver, and then he put his arms around her and kissed her right back. After what seemed like forever but was probably less than a minute, she started and pulled away a little, putting some space between them. He sighed and pressed his forehead to hers. \"Oh, my girl. You are sweet.\" As a rule she disliked tobacco. She disliked the mess and she most particularly disliked the expense. But on LaBoeuf's breath the trace of pipe tobacco was pleasant, even comforting. She breathed him in, humming a little as she exhaled. He stroked her cheek with his knuckles, which was unaccountably nice, and then he pulled her closer, tucking her under his arm and kissing her as she flailed a little, trying to find her balance. His mouth slanted across hers, and he was holding her so closely, kissing her with such focus that it took a long time for her to realize that his cheek was pressed against her nose and she couldn't breathe. She struggled, trying to catch her breath, and he released her, but not all the way. \"Are you my girl, Mattie?\" he murmured. He cupped her face in his hands. Her breathing was easier, but she still sounded winded when she spoke. \"Yes,\" she whispered. \"I think I am.\" He had the strangest look on his face, she thought, happy and worried all at once. His mouth was red and his eyes were so blue… She closed her eyes and kissed him again until he took her shoulders between his hands and gently moved her away from him. \"There, now,\" he said in a rough voice. He seemed to be concentrating on taking deep breaths. \"There. We should get going. This road will not be empty all day.\" Her face burned from LaBoeuf's whiskers, and she could taste him on her lips. \"Are you ready?\" he asked. \"Do we need to make a stop here first?\" Mattie nodded, lost in her thoughts. \"Do you need to stop?\" LaBoeuf asked, elaborately patient. \"Oh! Ah, no,\" she said, and he directed the horse to walk. The new and tenuous thing between them did not seem to admit much speech, but they spent the next little while taking turns at watching the other and making shy, silly grins. Anyone riding up on them would have thought them escaped lunatics, Mattie thought with her usual asperity, even though her thoughts seemed muffled by a thick layer of wool padding. A couple of kisses and she was lost to all good sense. They made a left turn to take the road to Mattie's house, and soon overcame a slight young man on a safety bicycle. As soon as he saw Mattie, he began waving madly, flagging them down, and LaBoeuf pulled the gig to a halt. \"Miss Ross,\" the man said, gasping. Mattie recognized him as the assistant to the telegraph operator. \"Yes, Mr. Harrison?\" \"Telegraph for you,\" he said, handing her the envelope. She fished a few coins from her pocket for a tip, and then the telegraph man was wheeling his bicycle around and heading back to town. Without ceremony she tore open the envelope with her teeth and tugged out the slip of paper. \"Oh!\" she said and her mouth dropped open. \"What is it?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Little Frank has found her. She is in Hot Springs.\" ","Summary":" With thanks to my dear jenbachand, who read this over for me.

The empty streets glowing in the light of sparkling summer fireflies. Each moving in the same direction of the cool blowing wind. XX Mattie Ross had only been asleep for fifteen minutes or so, until being woken up by the ruckus of mixed instruments playing aloud right outside her window, of the Main Hotel. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, with her one hand, and pushed aside the covers that wrapped around her petite form, sneaking those long legs of hers from off the feather mattress and felt a rush of cold air crawl up her spine slowly when the flats of feet hit the cool surface below. Mattie hadn't forgotten about her candle, but from the burning light from outside shining brightly through her window, creating funny looking shadows on the walls, she knew she didn't need that any longer, peering out and down the window. After her first look upon the world outside the window, she didn't quite see a thing besides the light gleaming in her eyes, but sneaking her body further out the window, she caught something at the side of eye. It wasn't anything at all that seemed to be causing all that friendly, joyful music. It was more of a man by the looks of it. Mattie leaned back into the room, stepping off her tip-toes and feeling the once cold feeling run up her spine a second time. Her mind began to flow with mixed emotions, mixed feelings she had lost almost all concentration. She knew it was wrong to sneak from her comfort zone after seeing a strange man right outside her window, but something about it pressured her to go on, and she did. . . After decending the creaking steps, in the most quietest creep she could ever execute with her tiny feet, with a flickering candle in her hand, she patted the thin fabric of her nightgown down, after setting the candle down, the man outside was gone, when she raised her head up high to take a look outside the front window, ignoring the flapping patterned curtain in the slight breeze. She felt her beating heart thump wild! . . She was probably a bit naive and silly for doing this. Trying to keep in mind that the man or lady right outside could be a probable pervert. Or even some inebriated middle aged fool waiting to strike young Mattie Ross. It gave her the chills just imagining it that open-mindedly, but the strange feeling swept off her shoulders right then, after hearing the joyful playing of instruments climb inside her ears once before. It brought back memories. Happy ones of her and papa' Ross. He was always a great fiddle player and even a swell banjo player at the most. Papa' Ross was always a talented man, and wished nothing more but to up his dreams, and do whatever it was he had his heart set on. And that one thing to do was play music. Papa' Ross had almost welcomed his dream, nearly starting his own band. They were all amazing players, well until one of them, by the name of Smitty Johnston of Fort Smith had gotten thrown behind bars for molesting his own daughter, Maggie Johnston. It was terrible to see Papa's dream end up that way, and Smitty and Papa were the closest friends of all. Both covered in filth, missing teeth, but also excellent players. No doubt about that. XX Mattie smiled softly, and wondered off into the joyful tunes of the music. Finding herself slowly devoured by it's powerful redneck, country sounds, she was right in the middle of it. A large crowd surrounded a large campfire right along side the Main Hotel, and the few players that played. It was a wonderful sight. Everyone was having a great time. Moving around, mostly all inebriated off their rears, and some being little smoochy romantics, sitting right along the wall of the hotel. It brought a big smile to her face, and glistening sparkles to her eyes that stared deep at the band, whom danced around like baphoons, on the other side of the sparking fire. There was a banjo player, a hermonica player of course, the whiskey-bottle blower, and then lastly, the fiddle player who was as old as the fiddle itself, but played as well as Papa, and sang some drunken jumbled up words, that made everyone around them as happy as him. It was great, even staying for a short-period of time, before hopefully crawling back into bed. Still, it wasn't what she got. XXX A heavy hand groped the ball of her shoulder, beneath the thin material, and she spung around, swinging the candle's flame while doing so. The girl swallowed, the music in the mere background suddenly fading as she stared the Texas Ranger in the face. His head was cocked slightly to the left, part of his hat falling over his eyes, creating a mysterious shadow to appear upon his handsome face. Mattie couldn't speak. Ranger stared at her confused as much as she was, with his brows furrowed. \"Well Ms. Ross, what is a young little think such as yourself still doin' 'round these parts? Thought you had better things to do with the rest of yer' life after all three's of us separated?\"he added into the cricketing chirps far in the distance, catching Mattie by suprise. She coughed, and smiled but hardly. \"Why must you ask such a strange question, Mr. Laboeuf? You mus'nt worry 'bout me, afterall, I am only sixteen of age and you whom is only thirty six thirty seven by now, hm?\"she did make a great point, and he shouldn't have no reason to wonder about her. But she was a beautiful young lady, even those years back did she look as lovely as ever tonight. He aimed his snickering face downwards, and his fingers wrapped tightly around his bandoiler. \"Such a young girl as yourself shouldn't be out and 'bout this late at night. I will take you to yer' room, Ms. Ross.\"he told her in such a hurry, taking the candle from her hand, and guiding it over their way. Mattie's smile disappeard and she growled at Mr. Laboeuf, before putting a tight squeeze on his forearm. The Ranger stopped, and those spurs of his finally silenced. He looked down upon her, gazing over at her same deep brunette braids, one draped over each shoulder. \"I do not need your help Mr. Laboeuf and I would greatly appreciate it if you would kindly leave.\"she nearly said to him in a scolding tone, those fingers around his forearm grabbing tighter. But the thickness and muscle of his arm was preventing that. He wriggled his nose a few times just to end the forever tickling of his mustache below, scuffing his boot with eyes gazing down upon them. He brought his eyes back up, and kept them on that little girl for quite sometime. \"Marshal Cogborn is in town. Thought you would care to speak with him?\"those fingers wrapped around his bandoiler moved and fallen into the pockets of his fringe coat, with her eyes right on him. She felt her nose cringe and couldn't think of a reason why. \"Maybe I will see him in the morning? Will you tell him that, Mr. Laboeuf?\"she had asked the Ranger standing before her, her eyes shining with new arrived tears, swelling up in the pink corners. . . Mr. Laboeuf nodded hesitantly, before tipping his hat to Mattie in the most kind gesture and turning to leave, back to the midnight throw-down. She just couldn't stand to see him leave already. Mattie was starting to think that it was her fault for making him leave and it was. But people would think something of her. All she could do now was watch him leave, and creep silently into the hotel, back up those creaky steps and crawl back up into bed, wrapped, comforted, by the handsewn quilts, drifting away into the joyful sound of the music playing right outside her window. E/N: This will be a maybe Three-shot...I hope it was a great chapter:D and more will be heading this way.[Chapter 2] XX XX She woke up quite early. Her eyes sparkled wearily, and caught sight of the Texas Ranger, whom at the foot of her bed, was lent back in the wooden chair he sat in comfortably, smoking nonchalantly from his pipe. The smoke released forming many shapes by the way it shown through her eyes. Mattie rose up, her back against the headboard, face a bit sticky and hot from the warmth of the sun that was invited through the open window, a smile tugging at the ends of her lips. \"I always have seemed to wonder why it was you always in the wake of my sleep, Mr. Laboeuf.\"that little remark caused Laboeuf to smile half-heartedly, removing the pipe, and leaning forward into his lap. . . He didn't respond to that, in no need or reason to, leaning back. So the silence lasted almost more than five minutes, but it didn't seem to be a bother to either of them. Mattie moved her eyes, and found the window, with the curtains and the valance moving carelessly in the soothing, moving-by wind of the new arrived day. \"I don't think it is right of me as a young woman to except an older man such as your self sitting at the foot of my bed each morning, Mr. Laboeuf.\" Mattie gave him a small smile, returning her eyes, afraid of what her new morning hair had to look like through the eyes of the Texas Ranger. He had probably seen worse, but Mattie was never fond of her morning hair. Especially on a hot day like this. . . Laboeuf moved one hand upwards, and stuck two fingers inside his bandana wrapped around his neck, giving it a tug, relieving the sweltering, burning hot skin beneath it. \"I believe that, Ms. Ross.\"he went forward into his lap again, slipping the tip of the pipe through his lips, and smoked the new tabacco. Mattie couldn't help but stare as long as she had, not flinching or moving at all. . . Until Mr. Laboeuf rose from his seat, and came her way. Mattie looked up at him with those deep chocolate eyes that she had forever possessed, fidgiting a bit beneath the quickly warming quilts around her. \"What's your reasoning for being here, Mr. Laboeuf. I thought you would had already gone off to Texas?\"Young Mattie asked, giving him a wonderous stare, couldn't find the best way out of his blue eyes, that stared back at her, with a slight expression of anger behind those calm lips. He hadn't found a good reason to move his eyes from her, and answered that while taking a seat upon the mattress, right beside her petite feet. Mr. Laboeuf had made a small indent into the feather mattress, but it wasn't as bad as it could've been with someone much bigger, fat wise, and Mr. Laboeuf was far from being what she called 'round'. It just sounded the most proper way to describe an obese person. \"What is a small town like Dardanelle without a Texas Ranger like me? This town is in need of me, and I reckon I will be stay'n here fer' quite a few days, enjoyn' the peaceful folk and great tastn' beer.\"he answered her just the way she had played in her mind, giving her a turn-around, and a tiny grin like expression. Mattie rolled her eyes, and used the muscle in her one arm to lift her body up a bit higher than it was, still well rested against the wooden headboard of the mattress. \"I believe that, Mr. Laboeuf.\"Mattie leaned forwards into her own lap, letting her one hand fall limp over her legs, staring childishly at Laboeuf, who was aware of the young girl but was too caught up in his pipe-smoking, he didn't bother to turn. XXX XXX Minutes later, Mattie moved herself from the bed itself, back already tense as being rested in one closed in space for too long and stood tall before Mr. Laboeuf, patting down on the thin fabric of her nightgown. He snaked his eyes over to her, but found himself taking notice to how well her body had grown since those couple years back. He still couldn't believe how much she looked like \"Mattie Ross\" he knew back then, and still knows today. She hadn't changed at all, and hopeful that he hadn't changed either. Mattie swallowed and cleared her throat before opening her lips to let some few words out: \"I do need my privacy Mr. Laboeuf. If you would kindly leave, I would like that, and I am a girl whom doesn't need a watcher, especially the eyes of you, sir.\"that serious expression spread over her face so smoothly grabbed his every last bit of attention, and he wobbled on out, hat shielding half his eyes with a fringed gloved hand that held it in that current position. Nodding, he was finally gone in the eyes of Ms. Ross. . . Now in the process of waiting, he trailed on down the stairs to pass the time, with the silver clings of his spurs quickly fading as soon as he knew he was at the bottom, standing still, with eyes watching through those windows, with a deep mahogany painted frame, and red and white checkered curtains flopping gingerly, air slowly blowing through them hitting close in contact with the wall of the chipped color of plain white. He swallowed hard, pulling on his grey bandana once again to release some of the heat, that continued to bother, then his hat. His eyes wondered around the rest of the room, while he moved an index finger toward his head and itched the spot right between a few locks of his dirty blond hair, near his cowlick. XX XX Mattie closed her eyes, taking in a long, deep breath, feeling the sunshine brighten against her face, and let them open again, gazing at herself in the standing victorian mirror in the corner of the room aside the only window, with the round frame of it the color of glistening gold, and only a few bad spots which had been accidently or even naturally chipped through. She couldn't believe how such a simple white dress could change a woman's appearance and it did. Just after a few moments to herself to twirl around in it, she knew it was true. But her sweet child was showing, and that was a good thing. :: It was long. Fell to her knees ending at the bottom with a lacey cuff, and a laced collar cut out as a small circle, barely showing signs of her collarbone, with long sleeves that flared out with a really thin lacey cuff also. There was just one thing different about it and it was the half sleeve on the opposite side, which was made special for her half amputated arm. The town's taylor was a sweet old man. Merely seventy years of age, unmarried, but had two young adopted children of the Indian Territory. The eldest seven and youngest only five; Mattie had only seen them once before, and hadn't seen them for a while after that. Such a sweet family. Buttons also of the color white lined down between each breast, straight down the middle and ended right before the start of the slightly poofed skirt of the dress. It made her feel more of the age sixteen, but her height and face changed her mind after looking. Her body was mainly the the main thing that has changed over the years, and without quite taking notice, she saw how much her brown hair popped out with the white. It was pretty and made her agape in awe. . . Mr. Laboeuf stepped foot outside the hotel, hands on both hips, feet spread perfectly apart, standing exactly like the Ranger he was. Most Rangers would even think about standing so dramatically and eye-catching, but Mr. Laboeuf was different out of the rest, and the most unique. Fringy costume and all. But he was such a chauvinist. XXXXXXXXXX Buggies strolled by, stirring up the golden dirt as they went passed down mainstreet, horses whinnying and trotting on the way. Even a pair of sweet young ladies passed the Ranger by with cute, curious stares, with those blue eyes of the two brunettes. Laboeuf tipped his hat to them, without a smile. They continued to stare and giggled behind pretty hands before leaving his view. He tried to hide that smile that slowly appeared, feeling some slight awkwardness slowly overcome him, moving toward the bar, where he had a feeling he was about to meet Marshal Cogburn. . . Mattie was finished. Ms. Louise, the Main Hotel owner, invited herself inside of the girl's occupied room. She was a kind older woman. Grey, silver hair wrapped up in a tight bun, with a few strays of hairs falling out of place, and a petite set of bifocals hanging right on the bridge of her knotched nose. \"Why ain't you the cutest thing, darlin'.\"Ms. Louise added into the deafening silence that Mattie was so used to enclosing her, and turned but jumped first. Mattie smiled. \"Oh, thank you, Ms. Louise. I gotten it only yesterday.\"she informed her with her sweet southern drawl everyone loved to hear, twirling around in it once more, staring at herself in the mirror. Old Louise smiled, pushing her bifocals up a bit, and watching Ms. Ross through those greying old eyes of hers. \"No worries dear. I will take your clothes and get'em warshed fer' you.\"the old lady smiled those red chapped lips, heading for the other side of the room where Mattie's dirty clothes lay in a pile. Mattie smiled small, and left right along side Ms. Louise to assist her. XX E/N: Second chapter already. Honestly in the movie, I don't know whom the hotel owner was, so I decided I'd make 'er up. Thanks for reading:D third chapter coming![Chapter 3] . . After leaving Ms. Louise, right after assisting her of hanging her own wet laundry up with the round headed clothespin in the decorative pot right beside the wash tub, Mattie left saying her goodbye. XX Stepping out into the hot, sunny open air of Dardanelle, she could already feel herself breathing heavy, and sweat sliding down her face in cold orbs that were swiftly wipped away. She hadn't seen any sign of Mr. Laboeuf. Only unfamiliar faces walking around her, all nitty-gritty like. Mattie watched the town folk walk 'round, and stopped for a passing buggy, before crossing the street. . . while making eye-contact with the strange buggy driver, she felt her heart shake, but it wasn't good. The man staring so deeply at her looked almost like Smitty Johnston. Papa' Ross's good friend from years back, when she was just twelve to thirteen years old. He had the same blood-hound eyes, so deep, dark and mysterious. The bad teeth, and the curly mustache beneath his knotched nose, which had been scarred ever since the fight he had with a man of law, and even the crazy grey hairs sticking out each sides like those creepy circus clowns, but had most of it covered by that olive green fedora. Swallowing and removing her eyes from the man, she waited for him to pass and crossed in the nick of time, before meeting him face-to-face again. Smitty was such a sweet man. He was nice to Mama and Papa' Ross, and was too terribly kind to young naive Mattie Ross. But ever since that incident with him and Maggie, she knew he couldn't have been the same. :: Trying to get those memories out of her thoughts, Mattie thought maybe Mr. Laboeuf would be inside the saloon having a few drinks. She never liked going into those smelly places, but had. She stopped at first before the doors, and then opened them, swallowing again hopefully the fear that was tearing her up inside. Once hitting the inside, it was more than she could ever imagine. She had arrived at the wrong time. Two men rumbling, because of a card game. Taking notice to the knocked over tables, and chairs, and even the terrified folk whom came in for a smooth drink huddled far from those two ferocious men, who through curses and fists like beasts. Something Mattie had never seen. But before even realizing, Mattie was pulled by her arm, and forced out of the saloon as soon as possible before the whole event gotten worse. . . \"Marshal Cogburn?\" Mattie pulled the gripped arm free, and looked up at the man or woman who had saved her just in time. Her eyes glistened, unaware of the pissed, furious look smacked on the gruffy man's face. He didn't say a word, and reached out another hard hand, grabbing roughly by the arm once again, and stormed off in a red rage, stopping along side the Main Hotel, that was a far ways down left of the town from where they stood previously. Mattie didn't understand what was going on. \"Stop it! Stop it!\"she bellowed so loud and full of anger, a few walking civilians took suspicious notice to the Marshal. Finally after letting her redend arm loose, she furrowed her brows and didn't say a word back. Marshal Cogburn mumbled something below his alcoholic breath, popping an already folded cigarette between his lips. \"Sister, why in the hell were you steppin' inside that here bar? Don't you know young girlie's like yer' self ain't allowed?\"he spat as he informed her with slight worry in his much angered voice, which mattie turned her head upon. . . \"I was in search of Mr. Laboeuf, Marshal! If you cared to know.\"she had her back turned, eyes watching the clouds above create funny looking shadows on the dirt rode before her, which had several prints molded into it. Marshal was quite silent for a while before putting another hand on her small shoulder, and spining around. \"You have to understand that these here parts ain't safe fer' long with a little thing like yer'self here. Crazy basterds!\"Marshal turned his eye that gazed down at Mattie, looking behind him at the saloon. XX Mattie felt a question come to mind. \"Marshal, then who is the one tryin' to stop them?\"she was confused on how it could be stopped when Marshal Cogburn was standing here right before her, smoking like a crazy addict. He returned his stare: \"Well who in hell else? That chauvinist son' bitch, Texas Ranger. That's who, sister. And why you still standin' here?\"he rambled on, getting more of Mattie's attention than was needed from her. Her chest pounded! -and her eyes popped. \"And you, bein' Marshal, you have no need in helpin' him?\"the young girl before him, standing way shorter than Cogburn himself, thought she had the nerve to back talk this old, gruffy one-eyed Marshal the way she did. Marshal wasn't suprised but not too calm either. He knew this girl had the guts to stand up to someone as bad as Marshal, but it didn't make things better. Before able to speak his mind and truth about his actions, Mattie ignored him completely and took off, running back toward the bar ahead. He took the cigarette from his mouth, dropped it without stomping it in, and went after her, with many startled civillians aware of the whole thing. . . Behind her, she could hear his shouting voice. It was a good thing it was scarying her, cause if it hadn't, she wouldn't be able to understand it anymore than she had now. \"God damnit!\"he cursed deeply, close on her heels. That's when she knew and had felt those thick arms of his wrap around her waist and pull her backward, from the bar she nearly made to. She kicked vigorously! \"Let me go, Marshal! Let go!\" she used the only muscle she had in that one hand, and began to hit those arms around her, kicking ahead of herself, missing Cogburn, until she gotten the idea of using the hard heels of her boots, and hit his upper thighs. Close to where it mattered the most. \"Put me down!\"she gave him one last chance, and he dropped her. Not hard, but not too softly either. She dropped to her knees, stood up and dusted her new white dress off that collected so much of the golden dirty below them, that was instantly darkend from the new grey clouds that hidden the radiating sun, and it's warm rays. By the expression on Marshal's face, she could tell he meant business, but barely showed it, swipping sweat from his forehead. \"I will be leavin'. To assist the Ranger as much as I can.\" he pushed aside his dark coat, that had hidden a weapon, aimed downwards in his leather holster. Just the sight of it triggered the courage and bravery inside Mattie. She wanted to assist them just as she had long ago. But after being told otherwise, she stood there in the middle of the dirt road, watching Marshal walk away, disappearing into the doorway. XXXX XXXX The day was quickly growing into midday, and it wasn't turning out as great as she hoped. After reunited with Marshal for a few minutes, it was the worst. She hated it, that after finally seeing him eye-to-eye again, they had gotten into a sudden fight, of what was right-from-wrong. It angered her terribly bringing a pain to her gut that she held. Even the sun refused to shine, and the birds were long gone, left with the dark, shadowed reflections of them. Crows. Snapping, crazily cawing crows. She moved her eyes from high above in the sky, and went back inside the Main Hotel, were Ms. Louise was standing absolutely quiet before her, nearly crashing into her, if she hadn't peeped up. Her wrinkling hands found their way on each of the young girl's shoulder, and rubbed gingerly, full of motherly love. \"What is it, dear?\"her crackling voice interrupted her daydreaming, and Mattie smiled at the short and stubby woman before her. \"Oh. Nothin', Ms. Louise.\"she gave her quite the original response that everyone now 'a days used, even if it weren't truthful, gently removing those hand from her shoulders, starting to decend the few stairs behind her. The older woman pursed her lips, and didn't even think about smiling. She knew something was a bother to this young girl but didn't understand what. But she had her own list of things to worry about. : : : The sheriff had finally appeared. He dismounted his black furred mare, before stepping into the saloon with boots with sparkling pair of silver spurs, hitting the wooden floorboards below, his twin revolvers staring everyone down, and a tooth pick close to snapping on the edge of his lips. Texas Ranger Laboeuf, and Marshal Cogburn, had caught the two men, but couldn't stop them right away before they bashed eachothers faces. They weren't pretty anyway, and if anything, it made them look much better with all those knife slashes, bruises and broken noses. Cogburn laughed a bit in the process of watching them argue back and forth, but he was way too serious all the same. The wide eyed Sheriff thought he was some big stuff, the way he walked, and the cowhide vest, the red bandana, big buckle, and pointed boots and sparkling points of his badge that eye-popped to whom ever took a look. Especially the ladies. XX Cogburn turned his head slowly, both men still restrained, and smiled catching Laboeuf sneering at the Sheriff. He didn't say a word, but was thinking the words. And what a pair of cocky hateful words they were. Laboeuf was just lucky he didn't exploit him in a crude way, everyone knew he would. \"So.\" the older man began, swishing the assumed chew smashed against his molers.\"Yer' the two who caught them? A Ranger and Marshal?\" he nodded his head as he looked down at each struggling wanted man, then up at the Ranger and Marshal afterwards. They refused to respond. and the Sheriff took the two wanted fellows off their hands. \"Come on by my office later and get yer' rewards, fellows. You caught the Recker Brothers. Been on their tails fer' as long as I can remember.\"the sheriff informed them, each brother standing tall on their feet, and forced to walk out with the Sheriff. . . Laboeuf removed his buckled hat, holding it in one clenched fist at a side. He swallowed, and put it back on, leaving Marshal Cogburn, who still stood inside the saloon. A few of the women were still shaking and quivering, and that was Cogburn's job to calm them back down. But Cogburn was never a gentle kind of man and attempting to help the frightened women was a bad idea. So he tipped his hat to them, with a 'Goodday' and left, on Laboeuf's trail. XXX Mattie was upstairs, in her room, in the Main Hotel sitting on the edge of the feather mattress, grabbing a handful of the white material from her dress and bunched it all in a tight, clenched fist. She didn't know what to think. Afterall, Marshal Cogburn had told her to stay away from danger. And Mattie liked danger as much as the next guy. She was mainly interested in the rushed feeling of adrenaline, and the tickling way sweat dripped down her face. It sounds pretty silly, but she was a truthful little girl. . . Soon enough, when the day had turned away, the wind started up, and brought a cold breeze with it, giving the skin of Mattie's body prickles of goosebumps. All she could do to relieve her pain of being cold, was grab the quilt and wrap it around her as best she could with her one hand, still feeling the hard finger indentations of Marshal Cogburn's hard grip deep in her arm, slowly dozing off, after letting her head come into the pillow and sunk deep in slowly before her body followed seconds after. E/N: This may be the most confusing chapter of this entire story, but who said it had to make sense. Just as long as it's interesting:D hope you readers enjoy! Two final chapters coming shortly![Chapter 4] XX Being woken up by the constant grumbles deep in her stomach, Mattie rose so that her back hit the wooden headboard. The air around her was pitch black. No sound, no peep. Nothing at all was heard. No light glowing from the outside into her bedroom. But she knew one thing. She was hungry. Hadn't eaten once today, and was dying for something. So sliding slowly and carefully out of bed, the dress that was still around her body had become stuck to her from the night's warm breeze, and decided that since she was wide awake, she'd rather sneak around in her dress besides her nightgown. . . Taking her lit candle with her, decending the steps, she had heard sounds. It caused her to hop backwards just a step, but something about the chatting voices brought her closer to peeking. Mattie swallowed, and finally stepped from the last step, causing some attention with how painfully annoying the squeek was to the ears. \"Oh!\" she whimpered quietly, thinking about making a quick run for it back up the stairs, but she was caught way too quickly. The clinking jingles of spurs hitting the floor would explain alot whom the man was behind her. No one other than the Texas Ranger, Laboeuf. She turned around, and sat down, on the third step, letting her eyes wonder around, trying not to make complete eye contact with the handsome fellow before her. He didn't say a word, and took the candle from her hand, and extended his other for her to grab a hold. \"I extend my hand.\"he had a soft smile on his lips and a soft tone of voice, that hat that was usually on his top head was gone, and the cowlick was in sight. Mattie didn't make any movements. She knew her face was flushed after the warmth heating her up rather quickly, she could barely concentrate. But his hands was still out there, with the other holding the candle outwards, behind his back. \"Thank you.\"she smiled wide this time, and took his well-sized hand, realizing how much bigger in size and height he was to her. It brought a snicker passed her lips after finding out, and Laboeuf pulled her further inside the motel, bringing her into the main lobby, where a few unfamiliar faces gathered, busy with a game of poker in the corners of the room at round wooden tables, and some just chatting over near the bar. Mattie cringed her nose, after an unfamiliar scent lingered up her nostrils. She thought of the smell of alcohol, but it was too strong, and smelled more rotten than anything she's ever smelled before. Laboeuf noticed her strange expressions, but didn't bother to ask, both walking in step with each other. \"I reckon yer' waitin' fer' somethin' to eat, aren't you, Ms. Ross?\"Laboeuf didn't look down at her, still staring straight ahead, while they walked on. Her eyes soon caught up with his own. Mattie flushed red once again, and held her stomach. \"Your right, Mr. Laboeuf. What is there to eat?\"she wondered, giving him her all attention, and came into a very damp, chilly room, that seemed to be the kitchen where all the motel food was cooked. Her eyes skimmed the room, and seemed to stop at the wood cook stove. There was by the looks of it, a tall pot sitting over the top of the rusting surface, and leaned over, taking in a strong sniff of it's amazing aroma. Laboeuf watched her, and found himself besiding her, opening the pot and letting her take a peek inside. \"What is it?\"she asked, looking straight inside the warm pot, but could barely tell because of all the surrounding, brown bubbling juices. The man beside her startled her as he slammed the lid back onto the pot, and stared down at her, as if there wasn't a sound to be heard. \"Pork.\"he answered her casually, giving her a soft stare, and actually wondering down. Mattie tried not to watch him, but it was soon stopped after her eyes met his. \"I see yer' dressed in somethin' new?\"he added below his breath a bit unnoticable to the ears, as nervious as he was. Mattie blushed, and nodded. \"That's kind of you to notice, Mr. Laboeuf.\"she stared down the length of the white dress, which was dirty over the knees, after Marshal Cogburn had dropped her in the middle of the road. She didn't bother telling that story, and went out back, stepping into the ice house. XXXXX XXXXX Smiling to himself and snickering, Mr. Laboeuf removed the lid from the pot, and pulled one glove free from his hand with his teeth before dipping a finger into the boiling juices that surrounded the cooking meat. No one seemed to catch him doing it, and no one cared. E/N: Sorry for this one being so uninteresting. I am making a little change to my story. I will be adding TWO more extra chapters, and they will be the romantic, fluffy scenes:D[Chapter 5] XX Late that cool, evening night, Mattie had gotten a few blueberry muffins from Ms. Louise, right before retiring for the night. \"Here you go, darlin'. There are quite a few in there.\"Ms. Louise handed her a small square wicker basket, with a cute fancy blue silk bow around the two handles. Just to add a bit of color to the fading yellow color of the basket itself, with a smile over her cracked lips. Mattie stared down at the basket, and taken it carefully from Ms. Louise, dropping it down at her side. \"Thank you Ms. Louise. That is very kind of you. Now I must return to my room, I am very tired.\"she started, batting the sleep away from her eyes, that were begining to see crazy spots now. The older woman smiled small and barely noticable, patting Mattie's shoulder. \"Yer' welcome dear. I have made yer' bed. Now you sleep comfy.\"old Louise pushed up her bifocals with her index finger, and watched the young girl before her, march slowly up those creaky steps. . . . After ascending the stairs, and finding herself enclosed into her own private room, she lit her lamp, that sat high on top of the dresser, and she took a seat in the old no back velvet chair, scooting into the desk before her, which had been covered with beautiful brushes with golden bodies, and mirrors, and bottles of fancy perfumes. Mattie wasn't fond of makeup and didn't even know how to apply it, so she knew well to keep away from those strange powders, and decided to remove those two tight braids. But sometimes she felt really silly that she would forget about her only one arm. She did hate having to be assisted by many people just because of that missing arm. She wanted to do things herself, hating to be a bother. XX Mattie sighed, staring at herself in the oval vintage mirror before her, that had been made connected to the entire desk, taking a gander at her braids. Before giving up just yet on her hair, Mattie stood up, pushed the velvet seated stool back in, and brought her one hand up toward her neck, where she attempted to pop a button of her dress. The first one had obeyed, and so have the others. So she had undressed carefully, pulling out her one arm first then letting the other half come out after. She let the dress drop from her tight hand, and felt it cuddle limp around her ankles. She smiled to herself, still had her eyes gazed down upon her dress, after feeling the cold air of the room play against her pale skin, ready to step from the circle and grab her long sleeved nightgown. But that didn't happen, when the door suddenly opened. Mattie quickly dodged for the well made bed, and pulled the covers over herself, afraid of actually letting the stranger see. He wasn't a stranger, and he was someone she knew well. The girl jumped, and held the quilt up around her growing breasts, towering herself high upon her knees, with wondering eyes that found Mr. Laboeuf in the doorway with a pair of glazed blue eyes, that had somehow frightened her, the perfect sized room half illuminated by a single oil lamp, standing tall over the dresser, to the right of her shoulder. \"M-Mr. Laboeuf?\" she heard a slight croak in the back of her throat after spilling those few words in confusion, his boots stepping closer, and his back leaned into the door that slowly closed with a clicking echo. He refused to say a word back, and she became more mad than scared. \"Why did you come into my room like this Mr. Laboeuf?\"she raised her sweet southern voice that always drew him closer everytime he heard it, and once close enough to the bed, which was too close for Mattie, she moved backward, still holding the covers, while watching Labouef wobble over the chair at the foot of the bed, and fall into it hard, with his hat rested in his lap. . . After that strange performance, Mattie was lost for words completely, staring down at the man whom sat in the chair, head falling back, and eyes staring hard up at the ceiling, almost in deep thought. \"You were drinkin' Mr. Laboeuf! Get out before I-I... she was suddenly silenced with those blue eyes that snapped a look at her, and rose from the chair as he did so, the belt around his waist that was quickly pulled from each loop and held tight in his clenched bare fist. Mattie swallowed, and turned her head staring down at the wood floor below, finding her nightgown. \"I reckon I had been drinkin', Ms. Ross.\"he finally said a few words that caught Mattie off guard and had her back, back against the headboard, eyes that glistened, and lips and fingers that quivered. XXX XXX \"I don't want anythin' to happen. Please leave now!\"she forced the words from her lips that had been quickly licked over with her tongue, and found herself back where she was before, watching the Ranger sneak closer, slapping that belt in his hand. He was terribly inebriated. More than he ever had been through the eyes of her, and after swallowing constantly over and over, she finally stood up, the quilt still around her, and stood small before Laboeuf, whose eyes took a wondering, and a pair of fingers prying at the quilt that hidden her female parts. She knew she couldn't leave the room without any clothing on, and she definately couldn't scream. But what Mr. Laboeuf was doing, was a bit strange, discomforting. \"Stop it, Mr. Laboeuf.\"she caught his eyes at the last moment, keeping them locked tight, trying to come up with some good distraction inside her intelligent mind, that would hopefully keep that belt out of his hands before using it. XXX XXX \"Mr. Laboeuf...your a sweet man, and I know you wouldn't hurt me. You couldn't hurt a fly, Mr. Laboeu-she was so close to finishing, when she was grabbed by his hands, and pulled forward into a kiss, that lasted so long, she couldn't even remember when it had begun. . . . It was Mr. Laboeuf's strange way of trying to steal a kiss from her; maybe that was the point of all the drinking. Mattie Ross knew it was a sin to do something so intimate with a girl her age, and with a man like Mr. Laboeuf, but there was something that was keepign her close without force. XXX XXX :DTo be continued:D E/N: Sorry about this, I am not discontinuing the story for good. I have to think a bit for this. I have also made a few changes. Now instead of being only SIX chapters long, it will be a Two-Part story. So these first SIX chapters are in part one and part two will be started soon. UGH! This is a sucky note, but anyway, the fluffiness will continue on newer chapters and if it sucked I am sorry. I have to be honest. I kind of rushed on the Mattie/Laboeuf scene:/ And yes...there will be a Mattie/Rooster scene:D:D:D:D[Chapter 6] . . Mr. Labouef hadn't left. But he knew just by the look in the little girl's eyes he could tell Mattie was tired, and needed her much needed rest. -and so did he, even if he didn't notice. He hadn't gotten this drunk for so long, he could barely remember the last time. But Ranger Laboeuf's reasoning for drinking so wild, were for the feelings that always overcame him most of the time...even after being around Ms. Ross so much. XXX XXX The night grew more into night and soon the bats would be out and about screeching loud, and flapping so terribly low scaring those who slept in their warm beds, bringing on the cold wind through the open window. Mattie had gotten herself into her nightgown; after Laboeuf's acceptance that he wouldn't turn around or even take a peek at her, while she dressed. But he had no choice. He did anyway. Any man would and it was just in their nature to do things they weren't told to do. -and Mattie Ross was a small little thing. \"Mr. Laboeuf, I think this is where we say goodnight.\"the little girl added, getting the attention she needed from Laboeuf, extending her hand, awaiting his single hand shake. So he spung around on his heels and looked down at that hand of hers. His brows furrowed in slight confusion: \"I reckon it is, Ms. Ross.\"he answered that with a silly smile beneath that fuzzy mustache, and the strong smell of the much drank alcohol lingering toward Mattie herself, causing her to cringe, finally in close contact with the massive hand of his, that felt warm and snugged wrapped around her own. So with out anymore thought, Mattie smiled and they shook. He showed himself to the door, a bit uncoordinated on his feet, but managed otherwise to depart the cold room. And at that time, Mattie thought that she wasn't going to see him anymore tonight, but he turned back around and met her eyes. It stunned her completely! and it always seemed to give her a silly, tickly feeling in her gut after finding his stare on her. He looked down, his head hung low, his hat held tight in both hands, almost the expression of guilt and sorrow spread over his face that usually seemed too \"big-shot\" and strong with a side of silliness. It always brought a smile to her lips no matter the predicament. \"What is wrong, Mr. Laboeuf?\" Mattie was too big-hearted like her father and couldn't help it, especially someone she really cared for. Before he could talk, a small hand reached out to him, and dropped limp to his thick forearm, with one small index finger tapping lightly on to the rough fabric of his fringe coat. He noticed the finger, and came back up to find her eyes shining, while awaiting his final response. He thought he could say it, say what was bothering him so much and it was on the tip of his tongue, but it just didn't happen. \"I tip my hat to you, Ms. Ross-and he did, and finally left the room, her ears wanting and waiting, listening to the eerie clangs of his spurs as he moved with a slight drunken tremble. XX Mattie held herself against the door, with her palm and her forehead faced down the same, trying to keep her quivering of the cold wind and the sadness that swept over her in such a instantaneous motion, under control. She just had to get some sleep and that's what she did. X A crazed nightmare hit, but young Mattie was strong enough to realize that it wasn't real, keeping her sleep in regular motion. :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: :::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: Hours after the croaking of toads in the far distance, after the soft cricketing of the crickets, and after all the sounds of the night died down, in the back of the Chinese Market was where the one-eyed grey bearded Marshal slept. Probably not the best, but it was all he had and made every last bit of time spent sleeping away in the market the best even surrounded by curry powders and ducks. . . In the new morning, Marshall turned over, only to find that one person standing over him. \"Marshall Cogburn? Your awake?\"Mattie smiled down at the old man, who squinted only to see passed the sleep and funny dots that filled his sight, while fixing his lopped eyepatch. The gruffy man growled deep in his throat. Not in anger, but frustration and exhaustion. Marshall was never an early morning riser, like Ms. Ross. \"What do you want?\"he asked, as Mattie leaned forward and put her arm around him, helping him stand up out of that so-called bed he slept in. She didn't reply that instant. -and Rooster stared down at her, prying her arm off. \"What you want from me girlie? Why ain't you buggn' Laboeuf?\"he swung a hand behind and scratched that bugging itch that lay right in the middle of his back, pulling out an already made cigarette from his trousers that slumped over his waist with the suspenders. Mattie still hadn't replied. She stared up at the cigarette between his lips, feeling terrible that she could no longer make them for him like she was so used to doing, and it was no bother out of her day. \"Mr. Laboeuf had left for Fort Smith, Marshall, and he had informed me that you were still in town.\"she gave him a soft smile, with those large brown eyes of hers shining brightly in his own, that found a box of a few powders, kept his eye on that until he knew she was looking away. Mattie was too cute, and he knew if she saw his face flush, she would definately think different of such a True Gritted fellow much like himself. So he nodded, and turned back to her, dodging as best a big man such as himself could under all the hanging ducks and sausage links, that somehow gotten caught either way, no matter how greatly he moved from them. \"Goin' to play a card game with some boys down at the bar-he mumbled with that cigarette still hanging loose from his lips, as he grabbed his best looking jacket and put it over right after he slipped on his suspenders. Mattie watched him practically dress up without a word. \"Can I come, Marshall? I promise not to be a bother?\"Mattie moved forward one step in her boots, right behind him, and her hand lay limp over her dress that she had worn before on the trail to Tom Chaney. . . The old man had to think a bit on that one, thinking back to the day she and him gotten into a silly argument at the same time the Recker Brothers were in town, brawling in the near saloon. \"I do not think so, sister.\"he became a bit angry after spilling those few words, removing the cigarette from his mouth with an index finger and thumb, in a fearful pinching manner, looking down as he brushed his jacket off, and sat down harshly into his bed, but managed to hit his head against a spice box from behind. Mattie knew it was wrong to laugh about other people's pain, but it was sort of funny, and Rooster somehow always seemed to bring a snicker or giggle out of the little girl. Rubbing the back of his head with his rough calloused palm, Rooster eyed back at the girl standing before him, and attempted to get his feet back on the floor, and slipped into his boots right below. \"Damnit! Where's my hat?\"he let out a curse, with a croak visible in his voice, when he lent over and put his head between his legs, staring underneath the bed, into a pitch black hole that looked that led nowhere but here. What the old man didn't know is what Mattie held tight in her hand, waiting silent for him to realize. XX XX \"Where i-sister?\"he raised his head back up high, and found it held in those little fingers of the girl before him. She smiled at him, while extending it out to him, and he took it. It was quite silent after he took it and put it over his grey top head. \"Please Marshall. I sware I won't be a bother.\"she asked yet again, with the same tone of voice, grabbing Rooster's attention with her cute smile, and shining ways. He remained very still on the bed, his hands rested over his lap, and that same exact cigarette hanging from his lips, barely held on to as their eyes met. . . . Quietness swept over them as before, and rambling horse hooves trampling in the dirt road, and buggies could be heard strolling by from the outside in the sweltering heat. \"Sorry sister, It's an m'portant poker game.\"he finally answered her, after removing the cigarette and released all the inhaled smoke, from his dry, dirty mouth, already heading outside. Mattie breathed hard and heavy, while following the older man outside. Rooster knew she was right behind him. He could hear her boots crunch in the dry dirt. \"I really want to come with you Marshall.\"she begged him again, in that same whimpering tone and it finally took it's toll, shivering up the man's spine. He didn't look too happy about it either after spinning around to meet the girl once again. \"I told you already sister. No!\"he growled out deeply, his breath coming out in her face smelling of bad cigarettes and day-old booze. Mattie blinked a few times before looking down at the tips of her dirty boots. She gave up. She just couldn't loose a friend because of something so stupid and silly. -and anyway, it probably was a poker game Rooster couldn't afford to loose, with money involved, and with Marshall Cogburn, money was always involved. XX XX She continued with her head down and hand over her belly. Rooster felt bad about leaving the sport behind, but it was what needed to be done. He let out a dusty sigh through his nose, and put a large hand over her shoulder. The brown eyes pointed upward at him in that instant his hand had touched her, and she awaited his welcomed words. But they didn't come that instantly. \"Stay outta' trouble sister.\"he tipped his hat to her, and removed that hand from her shoulder, turning his back on her and left down the dirt path, that seemed to glow golden as ever with the bright sunny rays casted down upon it, barely busy with any folk. Mattie smiled small, and went her own way. XX E/N: I know how I said in my last note that there will be some fluff, but I didn't get to it, and I didn't want a too terribly long chapter. And honestly I felt good about ending Part One like this:D Just hope it didn't disappoint anyone Lol:D But at least there was a bit of short-lasting connection between Rooster and Mattie:D Part Two will be coming very shortly!

Hi, everyone. It's me, Kuzco. The Emperor. You remember me. I was the star of \"The Emperor's New Groove\", that movie that that one company made. Here's some neat trivia kids: It's all true. That's right. It's completely based on my life as the Emperor. I'm not just some actor here to amuse and dance for you. In fact, as the Emperor, I think you should dance for me. I totally can make you. That is, if I didn't just go through a life changing event, such as turning into a llama and learning the important lesson of being kind to others. You should feel lucky that I learned that lesson. Anywho, so you're probably wondering why after such a successful movie and great life-changing lesson that I'm here talking to you. You're probably also wondering why I've been turned back into a llama. But most of all, you're probably wondering, \"What's up with the new title? I really liked the other one. How dare they change the title.\" Don't get your panties in a twist. There's a simple explanation. And I'm still waiting for it. See, it's like this. Even though I went through a terrible, awful ordeal and learned a very good lesson, not everyone was convinced of my miraculous transformation. There was someone out there who continued to hold a grudge against me. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Who'd want to do something like that to me? I mean, I was a llama for like. . . two days. Isn't that punishment enough? Apparently, someone wanted me to suffer. What's that? Izma? You think it was Izma? Ha ha ha ha, you wish. No, I admit that Izma was cunning enough to pull the wool over my sharp eyes for a while, but her evil ways are nothing compared to the sinister, uncouth gorgon that stepped into my life and ruined it. And for no reason whatsoever. Oh, she might tell you some sob story about how I was \"insensitive\", \"unreasonable\", and \"heartless\" or something like that, but I, in now way, deserved her festering scorn. And you know what? She's someone you know. Oh, yes. You're quite familiar with her. Let's recap. Okay, do you remember this scene from my movie? After the dramatic opening and my way cool theme song (Love it. Buy the CD), I looked over a group of young ladies who had the chance of marrying the coolest guy in the world. PSH. Unlikely. Let's watch. Roll film. \"Let's take a look-see. Hate your hair. Not likely. Yikes. Yikes. Yikes. And, let me guess, you have a great personality. Is this really the best you could do?\" Stop! There. Right there. Look at her. Miss \"Great Personality\". Don't let her appearance fool you. See the evil glint in her eyes, the fiery rage in her face as she raises her iron fist to hurt poor, little me. Totally not lady-like. All you guys out there, here's a lesson for you. Whenever a woman asks you to be completely honest with them, don't. It's a dastardly trap so they have an excuse to wreck your perfect, awesome life. They want to take everything important away from you and change you back into a llama. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's go back in time. No, not that far back in time. Although, even at age eleven, I was still a handsome devil. Let's go back, right before my awesome theme song scene, where this story begins. Now you're humming the song, aren't you? I know you are.[Chapter 2] (Author's Note: Quillana is pronounced Ki-ya-na) Don't Touch My Llama (Yeah, we decided to stay with the second title) By Emilou aka Hatashi Kitty Chapter 2: The Rise of the Witch \"Pst. Quillana. Wake up.\" I lifted my head at the soft whisper. I had only closed my eyes for a moment to relieve the headache I could feel coming on as the girl to my side shook me. \"I'm okay,\" I told the girl with a small smile. I wasn't the only one having a hard time standing in line. A few of the other girls were struggling with yawns and keeping their back straight enough to appease the Match-Maker. There were seven of us, acting as if we were being drilled in military tactics. The Match-Maker was running back and forth, assuring us that Emperor Kuzco would arrive soon. He had been repeating himself for the past two hours. We had been up before the sun to make ourselves presentable to our emperor, fixing make-up and teasing hair for hours with the hopes that Kuzco would pick us, that we'd soon become an empress. We were all given the same pure, white dress (the styles were a bit different) and large, gold earrings to wear. This was the proper way for a bride-to-be to dress when meeting their betrothed. Once we had reached as close to perfection as was possible, we stood in a silent, demure line, awaiting our fate. We stood for hours, the time dragging across our nerves like a rake across dry dirt. As I shifted from one foot to another restlessly, a sudden burst of music came from beyond the door. A few girls jumped and looked around nervously. They had all heard rumors of the emperor's unusual behavior, but I had not. While the others had been in the palace for days, I had arrived the night before with little time to adjust to my new surroundings before I'd be paraded in front of the most powerful young man in the land. Nice welcome. Seeing the girl next to me start to tremble as the music grew louder, I wondered if the young emperor was that intimidating. Or was it something else? \"Ah, that's his theme song. Get ready, girls. He'll be here any minute,\" the Match-Maker exclaimed as he fussed over us. He straightened one girl's white dress, draped another girl's hair differently and picked a spot of lint off my shoulder. Out of all of us, he was the most nervous. What did he have to worry about? At least he wouldn't have to marry the guy. As the tension in the room grew until it was suffocating, I kept my eyes on the door, my chin low in a subservient fashion. I was the daughter of a highly respectable and sophisticated family, with royalty in my blood. In my village, I was used to holding my head high as was suited to my higher station. But in the presence of the emperor, I must bow to him. When the call for young women to be presented to Emperor Kuzco for potential brides-to-be, I was honored to be chosen. It would have brought respect and prestige to my family, and I would serve the emperor as his wife proudly. As a citizen of our great country, I could do nothing less than what was asked of me by the emperor. The door burst open. \"Boom Baby!\" From the corner of my eyes, I saw that many of the girls jumped, a few even gave a squeak at the emperor's entrance. I thanked my mother's training that I was raised not to bat an eye or flinch at the unexpected. The Match-Maker jumped highest of all, immediately starting to shake at Kuzco's presence. The emperor must have been proud of his entrance because he posed in the doorway with the smarmiest smirk I have ever seen before sauntering in. He wore red silk clothing with embroidery that sparkled as if sewn with thread made of gold. He had thin, round earrings carved from beautiful turquoise. To top off his ensemble, his sleek, obsidian-black hair was accentuated with the royal crown that represented the power of the sun and the throne. While his clothes spoke of wealth and his high statue, the style was a strange style that I had never seen before. The back end of his robe curled up in a little curie-que that made me think of a squirrel. It bounced along behind him like a train of dancers. Eccentric clothing. An air of arrogance. So, this must be the emperor. So far, I wasn't impressed with our glorious leader His behavior didn't speak much of a first impression. I berated myself for my thoughts. Kuzco was the emperor, no matter his personality or style of clothing. It was disrespectful of me to critic him, even if it was only in my mind. \"Alrighty. Trot out the ladies.\" I saw one girl's lips quiver. My jaw tightened. \"Let's take a look-see. Hate your hair. Not likely. Yikes. Yikes. Yikes.\" I couldn't believe what I was hearing. Expressions of shock and hurt appeared on faces as he pointed to each girl and spoke criticizing words. They were like sharp needles to the soul. Then Kuzco stopped in front of me. His eye-lids were lowered halfway; a sneer appeared on his royal lips as a limp finger pointed at me. \"And, let me guess, you have a great personality.\" The next few seconds were a blur as my body moved on its own. The next thing I knew, the girl next to me had my wrist in hand and was holding me back from striking the emperor in the back of his stupid, royal head to knock some sense into that hollow melon of his. I was very grateful that she had stopped me. I took a moment to calm myself down as the Match-Maker babbled excuses to the emperor as to why the selection of brides-to-be wasn't good enough for His Excellency. It was hard for me to imagined that I had lost my temper to the point of violence. I have always been patient and long-suffering in my work around my village. I have never raised a hand to anyone. But within a few minutes of meeting Emperor Kuzco, I was ready to commit regicide. Soon, Kuzco dismissed us in a crude and callous way so he could go do \"important emperor business.\" Rumor was that he was organizing the construction of his own personal water park. The match-making ceremony didn't go as I thought it would. I hoped that it would have been more of an interview with questions like: What do you think an empress needs to do? If your were empress, how would you support your emperor and country? What do we have in common? You know, those kinds of things. If I knew he was going to judge us on our looks like we were some piece of horse flesh, then I would have opened my mouth to show that I had all my teeth. All seven of us failed brides-to-be were hustled back to our chambers to either be pampered by palace servants or catch up on much needed sleep. I, on the other hand, knew that this match-making was just a business transaction. Most royal marriages were based on what was best for the country. I wasn't going to sit around and let the cards stand as they were. I was going to do something. In some cases, it was the most tenacious that was chosen. I went to the Match-Maker, cornering him and demanding who the emperor had chosen to be his bride. The nervous little man wasn't sure and said the emperor's decision was pending until two weeks. \"Two weeks,\" I repeated in a stern, disapproving voice. A lady doesn't need to raise her voice to get her point across. \"What are we suppose to do in the meantime? Lay around and do nothing?\" \"I guess,\" the Match-Maker shrugged pathetically. Feeling irritated for being treated with insults and bureaucracy to my summons, I gave the Match-Maker an icy glare that made him cringe. I was sure the emperor's pending decision was because he wanted to see if something better would come around. \"Make him decide sooner. After all, some of us have more important things to do than just lay around,\" I told him. This statement was absolutely untrue (at least in my case. I'm not sure with the other girls), but he didn't need to know that. The Match-Maker wrung his hands and babbled excuses. After much debating and sighing (on my part), I persuaded him to let me see the emperor that evening. I returned to my room to practice what I would say to him. My speech was perfectly crafted to display my regal habits, intelligence, knowledge of the country and economy, as well as mentioning my highly sophisticated lineage. Basically, I was going to flaunt everything I had at him. I tried not to think of it as seducing him. To me, this was going to be no more than two adults conversing over a business deal. It was NOT seduction. The bi-colored guards standing by the emperor's room watched me as I approached. I couldn't help but wonder if they were born red and blue, painted or tattooed. I matched their stares as I was higher in station to them. They may be intimidating with their massive size and spears, but I was a lady. I kept my head held high as I stopped in front of the guards. \"I have an appointment to see Emperor Kuzco,\" I told the guards firmly. The guards nodded and opened the door. \"You have five minutes,\" one told me menacingly. \"The emperor had a very important dinner engagement.\" I nodded before walking inside. I was surprised that I was meeting Emperor Kuzco in his own quarters; it felt private and personal. Either I had made a mistake in judging him or he was more laid-back than I thought. Kuzco's room was filled with every luxury I could think of and more. I thought it was excessive to have a bed the size of a pool, three jacuzzis and your own personal chef with a gourmet kitchen in your bedroom. It looked to be a fantasy world for a spoiled child. The more I knew of Kuzco, the more I wanted to get out of there. But I couldn't. I had to stay, for the sake of my family, my village and the empire. With en emperor like Kuzco, his wife had to be organized and ready to work or something was bound to happen to the empire. I was my duty to become empress if it was possible. I knew I was the right woman for the job. Kuzco was singing in front of a full-length mirror, straightening his clothing and combing his already sleek and straight hair. The way he looked at his image told me he thought he saw perfection. It was as if he were flirting with himself. \"Okay, lady, hurry it up. I've got this 'oh-so-important' dinner that my ex-adviser just arranged for me,\" Kuzco said nonchalantly as he admired himself some more. \"Ex-advisor?\" I couldn't help but repeat. Rumors of Izma's power and influence on the justice system of the empire was notorious. She had been in her position for decades, even before Kuzco was born. I was curious about this announcement. Was Kuzco smarter than he was letting on? If he was, getting rid of Izma was a great leap in running the empire. \"Oh yeah. I fired her today,\" Kuzco said without the least bit of remorse. \"I caught her sitting in my seat again.\" My face slipped for a moment before I recovered. I must be careful, I told myself. If he'll fire someone for just sitting in his seat, then I need to stay on his good side. I took a deep breath before I started my speech. \"My emperor,\" I said respectfully, lowering to my knees. \"Please forgive this humble one's presence in your most honorable sight. This one is ashamed that she did not please His Royal Majesty this morning. Perhaps if this one knew what displeased His Eminence, this one could. . .\" I was using my mother's old way of talking to depict a humble and lowly attitude. Just when I was getting into the long stretch of my speech, Kuzco interrupts me. \"What? Oh, that. Sorry, sister, but I don't think there's anything you can do to 'please' me,\" Kuzco said coldly. I lower my bow, sinking my head almost to the floor. \"This one was thinking that if His Grace would tell this one what he is looking for, this one would become who His Royalness is looking for.\" \"What?\" Kuzco exclaimed, turning away from his beloved mirror. \"I don't know what you're saying, but let me straighten you out. What I'm looking for is something you can't become.\" I look at him in confusion. \"I know what kind of girl you are. You're a snooty-patooty chick that knows what to say all the time. Polite and sophisticated,\" Kuzco ranted, using a mocking tone. \"You've been hand-raised by your snooty mommy, thinking that when I marry you, they can run the empire and palace, mooching off my wealth. If I'm going to be stuck with that much baggage, I'm going to make sure to marry a girl as gorgeous as I am.\" The shallowness of his words stunned me. \"This one. . .,\" I started to say. \"Can get her prissy butt off my floor and leave,\" Kuzco finished my sentence. \"Because as far as I'm concerned, You didn't even make the bar.\" I stood up, eyes wide. Once again, I was filled with an indescribable rage that took over my thoughts and actions without my knowledge. My reaction was quicker than thought as I rushed at that smug, condescending face, hands petrified into claws to scratch and pierce with sharp nails. I could imagine how twisted my face was with intense revenge for Kuzco's words. As fast as I was, Kuzco's guards were faster. The next thing I knew, I was being restrained by strong hands, my perfectly manicured nails a hair's width away from the emperor's calm face. I feel the need to reiterate that I have never lost my temper or raised a hand against anyone. I have been the epitome of restraint and peace for my entire life. At least, until I met Kuzco. \"Bye-bye,\" Kuzco said to me with a wicked grin on his face, waving. The guards took me away. Once caught, I willingly went peaceably, figuring that I had embarrassed myself enough. I was sure they would take me back to my room to pack up and leave, only being within the palace for twenty-four hours. That must have been some sort of record. I was willing to accept the shame of being kicked out of the palace and never allowed to return. However, I couldn't figure out why the guards were taking me to the window. As the realization of my eminent doom appeared to me, I fought against the two guards, forgetting any resemblance of a sophisticated, well-balanced young woman of high lineage. My struggling didn't stop them from hurling me from the top window of the grand palace. As I fell, I cursed the architect who decided to build the blasted thing so tall. Many other thoughts went through my mind as well. My favorite was, \"Ahhhhhhhh!\" Lucky for me, I landed in the moat. The water broke my fall and almost my neck. I hauled myself out of the water, a bedraggled mess covered in mud and water moss. I rung my clothing out as best I could before walking slowly away from the palace. I was cold and shivering as I passed through the emptying streets. A tender-hearted baker took pity on me and invited me into his home. He gave me a warm blanket and something to eat as he sent his son to the palace to retrieve my things and my horse. I gave the baker some gold coins for his kindness, then found an inn to stay in. That night, I planned to go home. To make sure my family and village wouldn't receive any recoil for my shameful actions, I decided to send an apology gift to the emperor. I wanted to find a goldsmith to make a statue of Kuzco for an apology gift. I figured that would be a proper appeasement gift for the conceited royal youth. However, my plans were in vain. News of the emperor's death was called out on every corner early the next day. As much as I disliked Kuzco, I felt ashamed for treating him so poorly on his last day on Earth. I found a goldsmith to order the same gift I planned the night before, but this would be a funeral gift to be placed in the emperor's tomb. The funeral was bleak and dreary and disturbingly curt. Izma (who obviously made a great dinner last night since she was given her job back) was directing the event and promptly started changing the palace into her image once the ceremony was over. I didn't hang around to talk to the new monarch, but started on the road despite how late in the day it was. On the trip, I tried not to feel glad that the emperor had died. I benefited so much from his demise. You see, I am the daughter of a village Elder and Leader. My mother is the niece of a neighboring king. Along with that, my family owned an expansive estate. Our village may have been small, but it was very rich. A majority of the residents were wealthy retirees and the Nouveau riche. My part in the village was an icon. I represented the village at social functions. My mother taught me how to act in sophisticated company. It would have been a black mark on my mother (and her uncle) if word had gotten out about my behavior toward the emperor. That's benefit number one. My father taught me to be a peacekeeper. I would talk to the residents whenever there was a small disagreement. Nothing too big, just property line issues or someone was angry about someone's dog on their lawn. My father trusted me to keep the peace in the village. He said it was good practice since he expected me to marry someone in a leadership position. It would reflect badly on my father over my attitude toward the emperor. That's benefit number two. When the call for brides came from the emperor's palace, the villagers were proud that I was chosen. They sent with me all sorts of jewels and gold for my dowry. They even sent with me the Golden Statue of Chasca, our village's animal patron. It was made of the finest gold with large, priceless blue sapphires for eyes. They sent it with me for good luck. I was able to return my entire dowry along with our patron's statue. Benefit number three. The villagers were so proud of me and thought so highly of me, they were absolutely convinced that the emperor would choose me as his bride. There was no doubt in their minds that I would not be returning home. They also let me know that if, by some small, miniscule possibility that I wasn't chosen, I would be a total disgrace to the village. Benefit number four. I felt lucky that my shame wouldn't follow me to my village. I had a suitable excuse for my return, which all the villagers accepted. The next few days were completely normal. I greeted old friends, went shopping, saw my psychiatrist and organized a charity. I was happy. Until awful, horrible and gut-wrenching atrocious news came to our village. Emperor Kuzco was not really dead.[Chapter 3] (Author's note: Still in the revision process. I'm working on it quickly.) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 3: Towing the Line By: Emilou Do you see what I mean? I warned you, didn't I? Don't let Quillana's little girly sob story fool you for a second; it's all a ruse so you'll turn against me. Don't forget, she's the reason I'm back to being a llama. So uncool. Just disregard everything she said, because its a lie. Everything in the previous chapter was a lie. Well, except for the chapter title. I'm the one who wrote that. Ha ha. What's that? Some of you are sympathizing with her? You actually believe her? Oh, now I have to defend myself. First off, what was the old me. That's not how I am at all. Remember, I've been a llama and paid for being a jerk. I think that's good enough, don't you? Second, I didn't do anything to her. She attacked me. I'm not a violent person. Well, except that time on the cliff with Pacha. . . But that's a different matter. Where was I. . .? Oh yeah. Her glamorous words and nice writing techniques are manipulating you. Did you see how much space she took in her chapter? It was like ten times longer than my part. She took up all that time so you'd forget about me, the victim. She's crafty, but don't let her fool you. Maybe I should tell you a little of my story. You saw the end of my movie when I was nice to that old man. Yeah, him. I forget his name. Anyway, I was so nice to him, and I totally didn't pulverize Pacha's house for my own personal water park. That was so nice of me. And that wasn't all. I was a changed emperor. I gave money to that scout group that talks to squirrels, gave food to the homeless, and even hired Kronk as my head cook and food taster. See, I totally changed. Yep, I felt like a new man. Then SHE came back into my life. It was less than a month of being back to my old self that Pacha wrote me a letter. First, I need to explain. Pacha and I became really good friends. We hung out a lot at my new water park, and I grew close to his family. But being the emperor, I had a lot of duties that needed to be attended to, especially since I changed my old ways and was running the empire the right way. Not to mention, Pacha's family needed him to do. . . peasanty things. Things with llamas and such. Anyway, both of us were busy doing our own thang, so we didn't hang much. It's a half-day's journey to Pacha's valley, more since a replacement bridge couldn't be built for weeks (How dare someone destroy that lovely bridge in a fit of desperate rage and anger). Back to my story. After a month of being friends, Pacha sent a letter. He and his family were coming to the capital for the annual Merchant's March. It's this thing where merchants and craftsmen from all over bring their merchandise and stock, then travel all over the empire, selling their wares or trading for other stuff. After weeks of traveling, they return to the capital where they hold a fair. Pretty cool, huh? It's a big deal among my people since it is good for the economy, not to mention it's a change from the usual doldrums of life. Pacha was coming to the capital because he was going on the Merchant's March to sell the excess of his llama herd as well as selling all the clothes that his wife made. She's a wiz at crochet. You saw my awesome poncho. Pretty cool, huh? In his letter, Pacha explained that his family was coming along to see him off and to celebrate his son's birthday. He also wanted to show his family my palace. I thought, no biggie. It's the least I could do for the man who saved my life and throne. I could accommodate them for a few days. The day they arrived, I met them at the palace gates, welcoming them with open arms. Pacha's wife looked tired, and the baby needed a nap. I had a servant help her to her room while I showed the older two children the palace with Pacha. At one point in the tour, my finance guy came up to me with a bunch of stone tablets. \"Give me a minute, guys,\" I told my guests. \"I have to look at these.\" \"What are they?\" Chaca asked, curiosity written all over her face. She is one of the most curious kids I've ever known. It's taken twice as long to get through the palace because she's always asking questions. Hey, Kuzco, what's that? It's a birdbath, Chaca. Hey, Kuzco, how did they build that thingy? I don't know Chaca, it was up there before I was born. Hey, Kuzco, how many bathrooms do you have? Like I count. Patiently, I answered her question. \"These are petitions from charities looking for donations.\" \"What charities?\" Tipo asked. Curiosity must run in the family. \"Let's see. There's the Humanitarians Against Eating Big Bugs (HAEBB). One for a fisherman preserve. And a shelter for abused school teachers that needs to be built,\" I told them happily as I shuffled through the tablets. \"They're all good causes.\" \"Are you sure?\" Pacha asked, looking over my shoulder. His eyes widened. \"Gosh, that's a lot of money. . .Are you certain these are legitimate charities?\" I rolled my eyes at his quaint way of thinking. \"Pacha, Pacha. These are charities. Of course they're legitimate. I'm the emperor. It's my job to take care of my people.\" Pacha opened his mouth to say something more, but he closed it again. I hated when he would do that. Why couldn't he just spit it out like I do? . . . On second thought, I like having things sugar-coated. \"Well, maybe you're being a little too nice,\" Pacha said after a while. \"Too nice?\" I repeated, confused and offended all in one. \"Oh, wait. This is some kind of test to see if I've changed, right?\" He's such a joker. \"Kuzco, you've made a huge leap here, buddy. It's amazing that you've come this far,\" he said with his arm around my shoulders. \"I can't believe the man I'm seeing now is the same emperor that had me removed from the palace so long ago. Perhaps you should cool it down a bit. After all, you don't want to have a rebound.\" \"Rebound?\" The word sounded familiar. I had something to do with sports. Or women. I forget which. \"Yeah. After all, if you over do it, you might burn out and go back to who you used to be. We don't want that,\" Pacha said, a small joking smile on his craggy face. \"Changes like these should be taken slowly.\" \"Psh, I'm fine. My big heart can take it,\" I boasted. \"Don't worry. I'll never go back to that old me. He was lame.\" Pacha still looked doubtful. \"You should be careful who you give your money to anyway. Once people hear about handouts, they'll say anything to get money. There are con artists and thieves out there who will take you for everything you're worth. How many of those charities have you been donating to?\" \"Oh, we get about three or four a day,\" I said with a shrug. \"A day?!\" Pacha exclaimed, grabbing at his hat as if it's going to jump off. \"That's a lot of money. Where is your accountant? We need to look at your finances.\" \"Relax, Pacha. You're on vacation,\" I reassured him. \"Don't worry about it. I'm the emperor. Who would dare to con me?\" Wow, sometimes Pacha can be so naïve. He still looked concerned, so I patted his shoulder reassuringly before I continued the tour. At the end of looking over my palace, Tip yanked on my tunic to get my attention. He was bouncing around excitedly as if he had to use the bathroom. \"Kuzco! Kuzco! Guess what tomorrow is?\" he asked in an inappropriately loud voice. I'm not used to kids, but I tried my best to act excited as I asked, \"What's tomorrow?\" Tipo became still and quiet, to enhance the suspense. \"It's my birthday,\" he shouted, a big smile on his round face. \"Really? Wow, how old are you going to be?\" I asked, bringing up the excitement level. Yeah, you all know the drill when dealing with kids. Even if you know the answer, you have to ask. \"I'm going to be five,\" he told me, holding up the total number on his fingers. \"What? No, you're going to be three,\" I told him teasingly. \"Nun-uh. I'm going to be five,\" Tipo argued, but smiled knowing he was being teased. \"No, dude. I could swear that you're not that old,\" I continued. \"No, it's for real,\" Tipo told me, looking smug. I couldn't help but smiling. I swear, I'm not rubbing off on him. He must have learned his coolness from someone else. \"Well, great job, buddy. I guess you'll be learning to drive a cart now,\" I went on. \"No, Kuzco. That's not until I turn sixteen,\" Tipo laughed. \"But we're going to El Burro's Cheezy Burritos to eat and have cake and play games and party. Can you come to my party? Please.\" The little boy held out his hands to me as if praying. I remembered El Burro's Cheezy Burritos. A restaurant made specifically for kids. They first feed your young ones greasy and extremely cheezy burritos and birthday cake. Afterwards, parents can unleash their children on a melee of games, rides and a large playpen that smells of moldy cheese and smelly feet. It's pretty cool when you're younger than six. Not exactly my scene. \"Well, I don't know, Tipo. I have a lot to do tomorrow,\" I kind of, sort of lied to him. I know, but how do you tell a kid you don't want to go? Do you lie to him and tell him you want to go? I don't think so. Either of my choices end up with me lying to him. At least this way, my feelings also get spared. \"Really? What are you doing?\" Chaca asked. Her precocious ways will get me in trouble some day. \"I have. . .I have. . . wait a minute,\" I told them, snapping my fingers. Within a second, my assistant sprinted in with my schedule in hand. \"Let's look at my agenda,\" I told Tipo and cleared my throat. \"I have to dedicate a new mall, inspect the army and go on my weekly visit to the homeless. And that's all before ten in the morning. I'm completely booked,\" I told Pacha's family. Okay, I'll admit it. I only had to inspect the army for tomorrow. Otherwise, it was a clean slate. I'm the emperor. Like I'm going to keep myself busy all the time. I have people who'll do that for me. Sure, I'll do a few things here and there, but I'm still learning about being a good emperor. Give a guy a break. Besides, I don't have to justify myself to you. I was sure I had gotten out of going to El Burro's, but Pacha took me aside for a while. \"Come on, Kuzco. He's been looking forward to this all month. He's been telling all his friends that he knows the emperor. A few of them will be there,\" Pacha told me in a gentle whisper. \"I know you're busy, but can't you come by for a few minutes. That's all he wants.\" I looked back at Tipo; his eyes growing larger and larger until all I could see were those big, sad eyes. I sighed. I couldn't resist. \"Assistant, clear some space in my schedule. I'm going to the birthday party,\" I said in my royal voice. My assistant, of course, looked confused since there was nothing to clear. \"But, I. . .\" \"You tell all those other. . . people. . .that I have something more important to do,\" I declared again, smiling down at the beaming Tipo. My assistant just bowed quickly and left with a baffled look on his face. Good man. The rest of the day was filled with Tipo's chatter about his birthday party. The rest of the day passed by in a blur and it was soon night. I bid Pacha's family a good-night after a wonderful banquet. We all went to sleep with the prospect that tomorrow would be good. Little did I know that the next day would be one of the worst days of my life. And it's because of Her. Don't forget Her. She's at fault. Not me.[Chapter 4] (Update: Chapter has been edited lately 11/15/2016.) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 4: My Chapter Is Better Than Yours By: Emilou Oh, real mature Kuzco. I'm not going to sway the audience by acting . . .well. . .Kuzco-like. I'll use truth, facts and cool reasoning to tell my story. And I would thank you very much if you stayed away from my chapter titles, Kuzco. One prank is quite enough. (You little blankity-blank.) Before you corrupt our audience, let me tell more of my side of the tale. As I said before, I was in my village when we received the bad news that Emperor Kuzco had come back from the dead, so to speak. At least, it was bad news for me; for the rest of the empire, they were celebrating that Yzma wasn't their ruler. After hearing the news, my father and mother demanded an explanation as to why I spread such a rumor. Needless to say, the residents of our community thought that I had lied to get out of marrying our beloved king, which reflected poorly upon my parents. I related all that had happened at the capital, keeping certain details to myself. Even after telling my story, by the look on my parents' faces, they didn't believe me any more than the villagers. It hurt to see my parents with disappointed expressions and apologizing on my behalf to the villagers. In the end, they decided on traveling to the capital to see the Emperor themselves, which assuaged the villagers. Their plan was to explain MY mistakes to the Emperor and plead for him to reconsider me for marriage. Thank you, Mother and Father, for sticking up for your only child. The journey was long and embarrassing. I felt like a pathetic, old nag that was being taken to market with her owner's highest hope of selling me to a butcher for a few coins to be made into dog food. Yet it was nothing compared to the humility I experienced once we attained an audience with Emperor Kuzco. I never thought that I would see his smug face again. Being dead didn't change his smooth, cool exterior. To make things worse, I wasn't allowed to speak for myself; my parents did on my behalf. I had to remain silent for fear that any noise I made would reflect badly on them. After kowtowing to Kuzco, my father explained that I was one of the maidens that answered the call for potential wives for the emperor, and the rumor of Kuzco's death had deceived me into returning home. He then pleaded for Kuzco to reconsider me for a bride. I'm paraphrasing my father's speech, but it sounded more like a used llama salesman trying to get rid of an animal that was past its prime. It made me sick to my stomach. One good thing about the situation was that Emperor Kuzco didn't seem to recognize me as his assailant. Once my father had stopped speaking, the young monarch stood up from his throne of gold and deceit with a look of thoughtfulness. Or was it cruelty? \"I know where you're coming from. I do,\" Kuzco said in a sympathetic voice, a small smile on his lips. \"I appreciate you coming down here and trying to do me a huge favor. It's so great to see your lovely daughter again. Hey there.\" He winked at me. For a moment, I believed that the emperor had gone mad and that the exaggerated rumors of his demise was an attempt to dethrone him before he did something really crazy. I still entertain this hypothesis. \"Then you'll marry Quillana?\" my father asked hopefully. My mother almost started crying in joy. \"Whoa, n-now let's slow down. Rewind. I never said that,\" Kuzco cried out. I saw his cool slip at my father's boldness. \"But you will marry her? She is the right age,\" my father rushed on before Kuzco could refresh his breath. \"She is very beautiful. She takes after her mother. She's polite and has been trained to be a good wife. And also educated. Big bonus.\" I could see my father's mental elbow poking Kuzco's proverbial ribs in a joking manner. \"I'm sure she's quite a catch,\" Kuzco said, his eyebrows knitting together in worry. I could see sweat coming down his face. \"But you see, I'm not ready to settle down yet. I can't.\" \"Then you marry her later,\" my father insisted. The situation would have been hilarious if I wasn't being sold short by my own father. Kuzco let out a large sigh. \"No, I'm not going to marry her later.\" \"Why not? Is she not beautiful enough?\" my father asked, offended. \"No, it has nothing to do with how beautiful she is,\" Kuzco insisted. \"I said I'm not ready, and when I am, I'll find someone I. . .like. . .in that way. Sorry, dude. It's tempting, but I have to say no.\" My father looked crest-fallen. But after bowing in acceptance to the emperor's word, he lifted his head. \"Then you'll make her a concubine.\" I could have died right there. I wish I did. \"A concubine?!\" Kuzco repeated, his voice cracking a little. He cleared his through, speaking in a deeper tone. \"Uh, no. No. Just no. No concubines. Definitely not.\" \"Then a maid. She will wait on you hand and foot. She will dress you and take care of you.\" Father, please stop, I pleaded silently. He didn't. He kept on offering Kuzco my services. Just before my father was begging Kuzco to take me as a scullery maid, Kuzco stopped him. \"I don't know what your problem is, bro,\" Kuzco told him with a tern look, \"but I don't want your daughter. Just go. Please.\" With that, he dismissed us. Even though I was the one embarrassed at the feet of our emperor, my father acted as if he were the one shamed. He moaned and groaned about how he had such a useless daughter, how he would be the laughing stock of the village on his return. My mother, in her calming and loving voice, spoke to my father. She told him exactly what to do. As I mentioned before, my mother is the niece of a king from a neighboring kingdom. If anyone knew how to get us out of this situation, my mother would. I was sure she'd find a way for us to return home without being dishonored. I had full confidence in her. She took me aside, away from the prying ear of my father and taught me the delicate and subtle art of seduction. The things she told me were anything other than subtle. Needless to say, my confidence in my mother disappeared. I won't go into the worst of the detail; I have to keep this appropriate for children. The plan consisted of me sneaking into the palace and \"convince\" the emperor with my feminine wiles that he should marry me. Mother chose my ensemble for my rendezvous with Kuzco (where she found such scandalous things, heaven only knows). At the sight of the scantily clad outfit, I (for once in my life) said \"No\" to my parents. I abruptly locked myself in my room at the inn despite the cajoling and persuading from my parents, begging me to see reason. I wasn't sure what kind of reason they were referring to, but I had had enough. The next morning, I expected my parents to have accepted the fact that their daughter would not become the next empress and that we'd all be able to go home. All I wanted was for my life to return to normal. My parents had decided to accept the inevitable and return to the village disgraced, but they didn't see the need to bring their even more disgraced daughter along to reflect badly upon them. They left me with only the clothing I brought and a few coins attached to a note suggesting that it would be best if I didn't follow. I was disowned. I didn't blame my parents. Oh, don't get me wrong. What they did to me was terrible. I should have known that they would have chosen the reputation of the village over their daughter. Let's face it, they could have done a lot worse to me. My father always has been the village leader first, and a father second, so I understood that he didn't want my disgrace following him back to the village. My mother has always been socially astute, careful in what she does and says around company. She knows exactly when to hold her cards and when to fold them. In her mind, the whole emperor fiasco was probably something she wanted to wash her hands of and forget about. No, I didn't blame either of my parents. The way they were raised and how they think, this was probably the best situation they could think of. The one I blamed is Kuzco. It was all his fault. If only he wasn't such a jerk the first time we met. If only he had listened to what I had to say when I talked to him in his room. If only he hadn't come back from the dead. If only he would have taken any of my father's offers. Even being his servant would have been better than being disowned. So, the next day, I found myself standing in the middle of the city alone with no home to speak of. I had enough money to live in an inn for a week, but what about after that? What should I do?The simplest solution would be to find the nearest eligible bachelor and get married. With my good breeding, heritage (despite being disowned), beauty and youth, I could have married someone rich and lived a comfortable life. Perhaps if I took this road, I could have been happy. Another solution would have been to find a job. I knew how to read and write, and I knew math. Normally, women were discouraged from working, but there were always a few businesses who would be willing to hire me for a smaller wage than a man's. If I went down this road, I might have been happy. But I didn't do either. I didn't want those things. For the first time in my life, I was free to do whatever I wanted. I didn't have parents telling me what was expected of me, always criticizing me and stopping me from doing anything unsightly. I didn't have to worry about my reputation reflecting on the village. I was my own woman. And the thing that I wanted most in all the world was to make Kuzco pay. I knew it was a ridiculous thing to want, but I couldn't get it out of my head. The only thing stopping me was a plan. I had little experience in plotting and scheming, so every plan I came up with in my head sounded stupid. I was at a dead end just when I came to a crossroad in my life. And that's when fate stepped in. \"I can help you, my good woman,\" a tiny, squeaky voice called up to me. The voice shook me out of my thoughts. Looking all over, but couldn't see the source of the voice. \"Over here,\" the voice called again. It sounded like someone trying to disguise their voice in a very bad way. I couldn't even determine if it was male or female. I felt someone tug on my dress. I looked down and saw a pile of dirty, brown cloth at my feet. It moved, and I could see two blue eyes looking at me through a darken crease. Feeling silly, I crouched down. \"You can help me?\" I asked the cloth. I wrinkled my nose. There was a nasty odor coming from the cloth. \"Yes,\" the voice answered. The eyes narrowed. \"But we can't talk here. Follow me.\" The dirty cloth turned around and drifted through the crowd. I thought about not following. After all, there were crazies all over the place. A single woman could never be too careful. But something inside me thought that the person under that cloth might have heard me muttering about the emperor. Or maybe they knew about me being disowned by my family. Perhaps they knew about my plight and were willing to help me despite not knowing who I was. I quieted the cautious part of my mind and followed. The little, brown cloth was fast, but it managed to find a place to to wait for me where it wouldn't be stepped on by the crowd. Once it saw that I was following, it sprinted ahead. After a few minutes of this, I noticed that we were heading into a poorer part of the city. Everything looked dirtier and grungier. I cringed as the smell of refuse and sewage wafted around me the farther we went. I might have turned back if it wasn't for the fact that these darker, unfriendlier streets were devoid of people. I thought that the slums would be filled with the destitute and crippled, but I was wrong. This neighborhood looked abandoned. Finally, the dirty cloth led me to a dead end alley. It jumped onto a box to get a better look at me, although it still didn't reach my hips. \"Now is it safe to talk?\" I asked, feeling a little petulant at being lead so far away. \"Who are you? How do you know I need help? How can you help me? And those questions are just a start.\" \"No, we are still not safe here,\" came the squeaky replied. It lifted a hand to its mouth (at least, that is what it looked like to me; every part of its body was covered and just looked like a lump moving around) in a shushing motion. \"We have to go to my secret lab.\" \"Secret lab?\" I repeated, feeling skeptical about the person's sanity. \"Yes. Now, pull the lever!\" it shouted dramatically. \"What lever?\" \"There.\" I looked. On the wall of the alley were two vertical slits. From each slit, a stick made up a crude lever. \"Which one?\" I asked. It felt as if I were playing an imaginary game with a child, and I was feeling fatigued. \"Uh. . . ,\" the mysterious voice muttered, unsure. \"How about this one?\" I asked, reaching for the closet one. Just as I pulled it, my strange companion shouted, \"No, not that one.\" In an instant, the ground opened up beneath me, and I fell a short way into three feet of water, landing on my back. I stood up with a moan, feeling a bruise forming and coughing up water. Then I felt something nibbling on my legs and clothing. I saw a few fish swimming around me. In a panic, I tried to climb out of the hole, but there was nothing to grab onto. A rope was thrown to me in which I used to pull myself out. \"Why do I even have that lever?\" I heard my companion mutter to itself. I glared at the brown clothed creature. \"Explain yourself, now. If you don't say something persuasive, I'm leaving right now,\" I threatened as I wrung out my soaking hair. \"Okay, just pull the other lever,\" the squeaky voice ordered me, not even cowed by my threat. With a sigh, I did. I jumped back as a hole in the building at the end of the alley opened up. It was small, so I had to crawl as I followed the person in the brown cloth. On the other end was a room that looked more like a hovel than a lab. Once I was inside, the wall closed up again, enshrouding us in darkness. A flame flickered as my companion lit a few candles. The light helped me see what was inside this \"lab\". There were a few crates, as well as a small table with one broken leg. A few shelves lined one wall, holding a few packages and mysterious objects that I didn't care to investigate. The strangest things lining the shelves was a row of vials of pinkish liquid. \"Now can we speak?\" I asked, my temper on a short fuse. \"Yes, the squeaky voice replied. \"I came to you because I, too, am a victim of the Emperor's cruelty.\" \"But how did you know about me?\" I asked, my temper cooling down as I felt sympathy for this small person. \"I've been watching you since you went to see the emperor yesterday. I heard about how he rejected you. I also know about how he mistreated you before his so-called death. You aren't the only one he has harmed with his power and influence. And he must pay,\" the voice told me in a low tone. \"What did he do to you?\" I asked. The voice under the cloth sighed wistfully. \"I was once a beautiful woman. I served him faithfully for years. But when I became too inconvenient for him, he did despicable things to me and threw me away,\" the squeaky voice replied. So, she's a woman. Good to know, I thought, sorry I had been thinking of her as an \"it\" or a creature. I envisioned a woman serving Kuzco and tried not to dwell on what kind of despicable things he had done to her. My hatred for him grew. I was glad that my parents had failed in getting him to marry me. \"I'm very sorry,\" I told my companion sincerely. \"Thank you,\" the woman said quickly. \"As I said, there are many who have been wronged by the emperor, but nobody will stand up to him.\" \"Someone has to,\" I told the woman, wishing she would show herself to me. My imagination was going wild trying to envision a short woman with a squeaky voice. \"But I don't see what two people can do.\" \"Ah, but I have a plan,\" the woman told me. Under the hood, I could see her blue eyes narrowing. \"It's a very simple plan, but there are some things I can't do myself. I need your help.\" \"Yes, I can help,\" I offered, feeling warm inside at the thought of getting back at Kuzco. But at the same time, I had a sick feeling of dread. \"This plan. . . it's not going to hurt him, is it?\" I may have disliked the guy, but I'm not a cruel person. The punishment should be just. \"No, of course not,\" the woman reassured me. \"All I want to do is to show his friends what kind of man he is. I want him to feel the fear and pain that I. . . I mean, we went through. Isn't that what you want?\" I thought this over. It would do Kuzco good to feel the humiliation I've felt. The idea sounded harmless and just, giving him a taste of his own medicine. If he felt all of what I felt, then he'd think twice about being vile to anyone in the future. \"Okay, I'm in. What's the plan?\" I asked the woman. \"Oh, I already have most of the plan in action,\" the woman said mysteriously. \"Just a few things here and there to weaken him a bit. Things are almost set up for the coup de grace. We will make him feel fear.\" \"How are we going to do that?\" \"We'll subject him to his deepest fear,\" the woman said, walking over to the uneven table. She picked up a piece of paper, showing me a simple drawing of a creature. \"Llamas.\"[Chapter 5] (Update: This chapter has been edited. 11/15/2016) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 5: The Day My Life Was Ruined By That Horrible Girl. By: Emilou *Gasp* Gee, I wonder who that \"mysterious woman\" is? I totally can't think who it could be. Does everyone understand that I'm speaking sarcastically? Yes? Good. I'd love to ruin Quillana's foreboding that she's setting up for later, but the author says that I can't. I've been out voted. But it's not like everyone hasn't guessed. *Cough* Yzma. *Cough* Now you see what I had to go through. Sure, I was able to out-smart one crazy woman, but two? That's twice the crazy. You can't blame me for my behavior. I was completely set up on this one folks. It was blatant entrapment. Anyone in my position would have fallen into the same web as I did. Let me take you back to the day after Pacha arrived with his family. We had a nice, early breakfast together, and I showed them my theme-song guy, who sang \"Happy Birthday\" to Tipo. (Let me tell you, paying for the copyright for that song wasn't cheap.) Once that was over, Pacha told me that he had some business in town to prepare for the annual merchant's march before the family could meet me at El Burro's Cheezy Burrito for dinner around five. I was glad that I would have the morning and most of the afternoon to myself before I had to be packed into a small restaurant with a bunch of kids, germ-infested play pens and greasy fast food. I said a fond farewell to the family before going down to inspect my army, which was really my only duty for the day. \"Hey, guys. How's it going?\" Most of the troops smiled, waved or gave me a wayward salute. Their Captain gave them all a glare before they finally straightened up to military perfection. \"Okay, what do you have for me today?\" I asked the Captain while rubbing my hands together. \"Do I get to see some drills or mock battles?\" The Captain gave me a confused look. \"I'm sorry, Your Majesty, but we have made no progress since your last inspection.\" I put my hands on my hips. \"Why is that?\" \"On account of some of the men are still animals,\" he said dryly. I looked down the line of soldiers. The cow looked down at his hooves. \"I know, but we're still looking for a cure. Yzma didn't exactly keep a recipe book,\" I told them apologetically. \"What about the octopus guy? He's useful, right?\" \"He is and he isn't,\" the Captain said ambiguously. \"He has a deadly aim with all his arms.\" With a flick of his hand, he indicated the soldier to show his stuff. The octopus soldier took a step forward. (Okay, not a step. It's like he sloshed forward.) He picked up eight javelins, one for each arm, and threw them at a target. They all hit the bulls-eye in the middle. \"YAY!\" I cheered, clapping enthusiastically. \"That is so awesome. Now what's wrong with that?\" \"Unfortunately, if he stays out of water for more than an hour, he'll die,\" the Captain said bluntly. \"Oh,\" I groaned. \"Hey, I'm sorry man,\" I called to the octopus. \"It's okay,\" the octopus called back as he slithered into a barrel of salt water. The Captain grabbed the back of my neck and led me away from the troops, his voice down in a secretive tone. \"I don't mean to be critical, Your Highness, but it would have been nice if we had Yzma in custody. I don't feel that you're safe while she's still out there.\" \"Dude, are you serious? She's a cat. A cute little fluffy, cuddly cat,\" I scoffed. \"If she were right here, I could drop kick her.\" \"All the same, Sire, I'd like to have a few body guards with you at all time,\" the Captain told me with a grimace. \"Some human guards.\" \"No. Noooo. No. Having a bunch of guys in armor following me around is waaaaay too uncool,\" I told him definitely. \"How about one?\" \"How about none?\" I replied flippantly. The Captain grunted. \"I'm in charge of your safety. If I have to, I will follow you around myself.\" I grimaced. \"Okay, fine. One body guard, and I get to choose.\" \"As long as its anyone but the cow.\" The cow soldier looked embarrassed. \"Fine by me,\" I said with a grin. The Captain grinned back, feeling as if he won. (Well, he actually did, but I wasn't going to act as if he had.) \"Well, Sire, then as long as you are here, perhaps you'd like to take a look at the Calvary.\" He gestured a rough hand at a group of men mounted on llamas. They were a tough-looking group, trying to radiate danger as their mounts chewed their cud. (There had been many complaints that the Calvary would look better on horses. I totally agreed, but unfortunately, horses aren't exactly the best for mountain passes.) I backed away, feeling a little nervous. The sight of those long faces sometimes does that to me. \"Ahh, haa,\" I laughed in a high tone as I kept my eyes on the beasts. \"No, everything looks great. You're doing good, guys. Keep it up.\" I hurried away, keeping a distance away from the shaggy animals. A few hours later, I was strolling through my palace with my new body guard at my side. I had just briefed him on my day's schedule, including meeting with Pacha's family. \"Oh, this is going to be so much fun. I haven't been to El Burro's in ages,\" Kronk told me, a bounce in his step. \"Tipo will love it. They give out free brownies for birthday boys. I wish it was my birthday, because I love their brownies.\" I was beginning to regret my decision of having a body guard. The only thing that kept my spirits up was the Captain's face when I picked Kronk. (I never agreed to pick one of the palace guards, so I guess he didn't win after all). Most of the time, I like hanging around Kronk. Oh, yes. I do. He makes a mean souffle and is a great guy to invite to a poker game. (Who'd thought that Kronk would have a poker face. He's an open book for the most part.) But sometimes he fixates on some childish idea and won't let it go. Then he'll talk and talk, sometimes only to himself. That's just Kronk. \"Chill out, buddy. We'll get there soon enough. I just have a few more things to do first,\" I told him. Just at that time, my finance guru came in with the latest tablets. As I took them, the finance guy started talking to me in rapid speech worriedly. \"What's that?\" I asked, not paying attention the first time. \"Sire, I don't mean to impose, but I think you should turn away today's donation requests,\" he mumbled, looking down at his pointed shoes. \"And let my people go without what they need,\" I chortled. \"No, I will not let them down.\" \"Ah, charity. For the good of the people,\" Kronk said with a smile on his big, pointy face. \"Give 'til it hurts so good.\" \"Right. . . .\" Whatever that means , I thought. I quickly signed all the tablets before handing them back to a frowning finance guy. I didn't pay him no mind. After all, I believed that the empire could afford it. \"Alright, Kronky. Time to go,\" I said with a pat on his back. \"YAY!\" Kronk cried out, skipping along in front of me. I was in a good mood, so we decided to walk to El Burro's. I thought it would be nice to walk around, say \"Hi\" to my people and see how my donations were making them happy. However, I was completely surprised to see the streets empty. Not a soul in sight. \"Cree-py,\" I told Kronk, who nodded and gulped. I was getting spooked and ready to turn around when El Burro's came into view. I sighed with relief. \"Hello!\" A face popped up in front of me, making me jump back and scream like a little girl. . .I mean, I was startled in a manly way. \"Oh, sorry,\" a feminine voice said. She backed away. Now that she wasn't right in my face, I could see that she was a young woman with big, round eyes. I was startled since I thought those dark eyes were glaring at me for a while, but then became amiable. \"No, it's alright,\" I told her, putting on a princely smile. The girl played with her hair in a way that made her look younger than the sixteen years I initially thought she'd be. Her hair was long, thick and straight, running down her back in a black cascade. I would have thought she was beautiful, but she looked frazzled with her hair slightly messy. There was a smudge of dirt on her cheeks, and her hands were dirty. Surprisingly, she wore a nicer dress than I thought a peasant could afford, but it was just as dirty as she was, so I gave it no thought. I looked down at her carefully, deja vu running through my brain. \"Do I. . .know you?\" I asked suspiciously. She bit her lip in a childish way. \"Uh. . .well. . .you're Emperor Kuzco, right?\" she said, almost as if she were remembering her lines in a script. Her words sounded wooden. \"Yeah. . .,\" I said cautiously, wondering if she were one of those crazy fangirls who were going to glomp me. I glanced back at Kronk to see if he was ready to jump in front of me in case she pulled a knife or something, but the big galoot was smiling dorkily at the girl. \"Great. I was just on my way to the palace with a message for you,\" she said blandly. I rolled my eyes. \"If you're looking for a handout, you must fill out a form with my adviser,\" I said with my hands up. I was so not going to work on my afternoon off. \"No. . . No, that's not what I want. I'm here with an invitation for you,\" the girl said. \"An invitation?\" I repeated with one raised eyebrow. \"Yes. Your people, who love you very much, want to do something in return for your generosity and kindness,\" she said, a big smile appearing on her face. Although she looked sincere, something about her words sounded false. But I didn't take this as a warning. Instead, I was interested in what she had to say. \"I was sent to tell you that there will be a parade being held in your honor,\" she continued. Her nervousness from earlier had disappeared. She stood before me a confident young woman, her back straight and looking more mature than before. If I hadn't seen how dirty she was, I would have thought she was royalty by her posture and tone. That was another warning sign, but I ignored it. Oh, poor, poor Past Kuzco. Why were you so naïve? \"A parade?!\" both Kronk and I exclaimed together. Kronk clapped his hands together like a child. \"Yes, a big parade. It'll have floats and balloons and acrobats and. . .clowns. . .and all sorts of things,\" she told me, sounding more and more excited. \"And fireworks at the end.\" There was a part of me telling me that this seemed to be too good to be true. Red flags flashed all over my gut, telling me to get out of there. There was something false about the girl's words, and I should have listened. But the other part of me was thinking about the most awesome party in the world. My very own parade! It would be totally awesome. I was blind to everything else. \"Wow, that sounds great,\" I said, grabbing the girl by her shoulders and half-shouting it into her face. \"I can't wait. This is amazing. Is it tomorrow? Or next week? I hope it's tomorrow. I can't wait.\" \"Uh. . .then you don't have to wait. . .because it's happening right now,\" she told me with a wide smile. Suddenly my happy meter went waaaaaaaay down. \"Wha-you mean right now, right now?\" I asked, sounding like a total idiot. \"Of course. Your people wanted to surprise you,\" the young woman said, looking completely innocent. (I should have been more suspicious. Nobody smiles that much.) My eyes drifted over to El Burro's, thinking about Pacha's family and Tipo's friends expecting me. \"I don't suppose it could wait until tomorrow?\" I asked, cringing. The young woman's face fell. \"But the performers are already here. Your people used their own money to prepare this all for YOU,\" she told me, her eyes expectant. If you put it that way, I thought, then I have to go to the parade. It's my duty. \"I suppose I could go for a while,\" I said, thinking it over. \"I can make a quick appearance and still make it to Tipo's party.\" I looked to Kronk for confirmation. \"I can't think of anything that could go wrong with this plan,\" Kronk told me with a shrug. I shrugged back. \"Well, alrighty then. Lead the way,\" I told the young woman. For a moment, the girl looked disappointed and uncertain. Then her large smile was back, and she led us down the road away from El Burro's, her back straight and tall. Everything about her seemed wrong, but like the innocent that I am, I went along. As you can see, I was completely duped into going along with his plot, the sneaky seductress. She offered me a bite of a tasty apple, which you'd have to be super human to resist it. But guess what? That was a poisonous apple. Because she's a witch. Oh, where was I? \"The parade,\" said Kronk. Yes, the parade. Thanks Kronk. \"No problem.\" All feelings of guilt for skipping out on Tipo's party left me when I saw The Parade. From that point on, it needed to be capitalized because of how awesome it was. The floats were decorated with flowers of every color you could imagine; the scent was exotic and intoxicating. It was refreshing. There were thoroughbred horses pulling each one, their coats shining in the brilliant sun and their feet dancing in anticipation. The girl leading the way stopped and bowed to me, gesturing in a graceful way to a float covered in golden flowers. The float had a wide, flowing staircase, and at the top was a throne almost an exact copy of my own. \"If Your Highness would take his place, we may begin The Parade,\" the girl said, her voice darker and deeper than before. I couldn't contain myself. I took the staircase two steps at a time like it was a race, jumping into the golden throne. After situating my rump onto the cushion, I looked up and gasped. Before me, there was a multitude of people lined up on both sides of the street, cheering and calling my name. They had flags and bouquets of flowers. Petals and confetti were being thrown all over as if it was raining colors from the sky. In the streets, there was a cacophony of performers and animals. There were jugglers throwing an assortment of items from balls to knives to flaming sticks. Dogs, cats, jaguars, horses and all manner of animals were doing tricks to the orders of their trainers. Acrobats and contortionists were leaping about, awing the crowd. Dancers pranced around, their clothing loose and covered with feathers so it looked like they were flying. I know, I'm so good as description. \"Now this is a Parade,\" I said, giggling to myself. All this awesomeness was for me! Some part of me had desired this for a long time. Since my time as a llama, I had spent a lot of time trying to persuade everyone that I had changed. I went out of my way to be nice to everyone. I especially set aside my usual greed and selfishness. But at that time, I couldn't help but revel that this Parade was all about ME. It made me feel good. Marvelous. Stupendous. I was on top of the world. I was Emperor Kuzco. And everyone was. . . \"Uh, Kuzco. . .\" \"Huh?\" I asked, hearing a voice shout my name, not in joy, but plainly. Kronk stood at the foot of the float, looking a little confused. \"What do you want me to do?\" \"Oh, yeah. I guess you should come stand on the float,\" I told him. \"Really?\" he asked incredulously. \"Yeah, that's what my body guard is for,\" I told him. \"Get up here and guard my body.\" \"Right!\" He saluted and ran up the stairs. Then The Parade started. It was magical. Everything went by so quickly. The longer The Parade went, the more there was to see. Every time I looked around, something new caught my attention. The people on the streets kept cheering me on, wanting me to wave back at them. I didn't notice if my arms grew tired, I was in an ecstatic state of self-importance. I vaguely remembered Kronk tapping my shoulder and whispering something, but I shook him off. This was my time. I had spend many month making up for my selfish, greedy past. Didn't I deserve just one moment? Couldn't it be about me for an hour? Whatever warning Kronk whispered to me, it fell on deaf ears. In all the excitement, I didn't notice that the sun had gone down until fire shot from the earth and burst into the sky. Lights danced among the stars, drowning them out with flashes and bangs. It was a symphony of sound and brilliance. For me! I leaped out of my seat, waving my hands in the air like a conductor. The fireworks went off all around me, as if at my command. The crowd of my people oohed and aahed at the sight. The Parade's finale had come, but I wasn't ready for it to stop. I wanted more. I wanted to gaze upon the worshipful faces of my people, feel their love and adoration upon me. I looked down at the hundreds of faces, feeling the power of the moment rush through me. Then, in an instant, it all vanished when I saw the face of Pacha looking up at me in disappointment. By his knees, little Tipo's freakishly large eyes filled with tears. There were no words to describe how I felt at that moment, knowing that I had let my friends down. . . . . . . . . . I told you, there are not words to describe it. It felt awful, okay. I hated myself.[Chapter 6] (Author's note: This chapter has been edited on 12/20/2016) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 6: Sweet Revenge By: Emilou Hi, it's me again. I know all of you know Kuzco and not me, and you're waiting for him to make things right. You want him to come out on top and be the wonderful hero. Honey, I hate to break it to you, but that's not going to happen. He's just like a person who decides to go on a diet to lose some weight, and then their mom makes home-made ice-cream or chocolate chip cookies, and they're off the wagon. Kuzco doesn't have a lot of will-power. Selfishness never goes away. I hangs around like a stalker. You can try to lose it, but it's just hiding in the neighbor's yard with binoculars. Kuzco's selfishness took everything away from me. My family, my home and my reputation. Because of Kuzco, I was condemned to a life on the streets, alone. Which is why I felt very lucky to find the mysterious figure who was willing to help me with my revenge. I know Kuzco's story is moving faster than mine, but don't worry, I'll catch up in this chapter. Now, before the whole parade happened, I was. . . Psst, it's The Parade. What? Who. . . The Parade. Kuzco, stay out of my chapter! But you're saying it wrong. It's not 'the parade'. It's \"The Parade\". Get out! I don't interrupt your narration. I'm not leaving until you say it right. No. Do it. No. The Parade. The Parade. The Parade. Try it. It's fun. Fine. I'll say it right. Just get out of here. Okay, I'm going. No need to get violent. The Parade! Grrrr. Okay, so before the par. . .I mean. . . The Parade. . . Better. . . . my new friend and I plotted against Kuzco. Although we were working closely with each other, she always stayed in the dirty, burlap cloth and called herself \"Scratch\". It wasn't much, but it was enough to have something to call her. After revealing Kuzco's weakness (llamas, who knew), she laid down only a fragment of her plan, just the part that I would play. During the time that I worked with Scratch, I used the remnant of the money my parents left me to rent a room at a small, poor inn and buy food. My first day of working on Operation: Humiliate Kuzco consisted of going from shop to shop, ordering from a list that Scratch had given me. When I was first given the list, I was bedazzled at the luxurious items that my \"friend\" wanted. \"How are we going to pay for all of this?\" I asked, not getting a good feeling about it. To reply to my question, Scratch merely handed me a bag filled with gold coins. \"Where did you get this?\" I asked Scratch suspiciously. After all, Scratch lived in a poor, dirty part of the city. As far as I knew, her only possessions were the burlap cloth she wore and whatever items were in her \"lab\". There was no way Scratch was this rich. \"Do not worry,\" Scratch told me, her squeaky voice ominous despite how cute it was. \"I have a. . . . benefactor who is funding this project.\" At that, I came to the conclusion that it wasn't just Scratch and I working on this project. There were others out there like me who were helping us. This calmed whatever fears I had. I was ready to work. I won't go into too many details about what I did in the next couple of weeks. I'm sure from the description Kuzco gave you of The Parade, you can guess what Scratch and I were doing. My main duties were to order the supplies needed to set up The Parade, as well as to find performers and animals that could join in. The big problem was that I couldn't tell the workers, performers and trainers the exact date. And every time I approached Scratch about this major detail, she wouldn't give me a direct answer. \"It's not the right time,\" she would always tell me. After hearing that for over two weeks, Scratch glared at me with baleful, blue eyes. \"Do you not understand? Humiliating Kuzco isn't enough, we must do it in front of his friends,\" she growled at me. My eyes widened at that. \"Our revenge won't mean a thing if we can't unveil Kuzco's true, greedy nature in front of his friends and subjects,\" Scratch continued, pacing around her \"lab\". \"That is the reason that we wait.\" With more understanding, I continued my work. I was now having a hard time storing the items for The Parade. The fireworks had to be kept somewhere dry. Several floats were finished; much of our money was wasted in renting space for these large vehicles. Not to mention, performers from outside of the city were arriving, expecting to be paid, boarded and fed every day they were there. But no matter how many times I ran out of gold, Scratch easily replaced my funds, not even batting an eye at the expenses. I did not complain, just did my job. I dreamed every night how it would feel to finally get revenge on Kuzco. I could almost see his face as he realized how his foolishness had boomeranged him in the face. It was what kept me going. It wasn't long after that that Scratch told me the time to put our plan in motion was at hand. She explained how she has a spy in the emperor's palace who told her that Pacha, Kuzco's best friend, was there for a visit. We needed to work hard to get everything ready for the morrow. I was giddy at the thought that my dream was finally coming true. I was elated. That is, until Scratch told me we would be doing it during Pacha's son's birthday party. That made the fuzzy feelings vanish. \"You want to ruin that little boy's birthday party?\" I asked Scratch uncertainly. \"No, it won't ruin his birthday,\" Scratch assured me quickly. \"You see, it's just Pacha's faith in Kuzco we need to destroy. Kuzco thinks the world of Pacha. And being a big family man, when Kuzco misses the party for his own selfish reasons, it will only affect Pacha.\" \"But why would Kuzco go to a child's birthday party? He's Kuzco,\" I inquired, having a hard time imagining the emperor at the fast food restaurant. Scratch chuckled. \"Not only does he want to be adored by his subjects, but he also values Pacha's opinion,\" she told me. \"I don't see why. It's so shameful for one of royal birth to associate with such peasantry.\" This last part, she hissed to herself, but I still heard it. I froze inside, feeling awful in my stomach. After all, one of the only characteristics that I admired about Kuzco was that his best friend was a llama-herder. I felt that if Kuzco could befriend a man of such humble birth, there was hope for him. At that moment, I was uncertain of the plan. I wanted to question more about it, perhaps argue if we could change the date so that it wouldn't affect Pacha's son, but Scratch snapped at me. \"What are you still doing here? Quite gawking like a statue. You have work to do,\" she yelled at me. Her actions felt aggressive to me, so I readily left, pushing aside all my doubts. All that day, I went from one store to another, spending the rest of my money and making sure that everything would be set up for the next day. Although I wasn't buying things for myself, I felt good about spending the gold. Often times, instead of going to the nicest store, I would go to a poorer one or if I knew a certain shop-owner had a large family. I felt happy to know that the gold I was spending would help others to have a good life, to help men and women support and feed their families. It reminded me of my own village, where I spent a lot of my time helping others. I missed that more than anything. That night, I tried to let thoughts of revenge send me to sleep. I tried to imagine Kuzco's face the exact minute he would hit bottom. Would he weep softly? Or scream like a baby? So many possibilities filled me with glee. Anytime I felt as if something was wrong about my situation, I always pushed it aside. After all, Kuzco deserved it. After all, the boy wouldn't get hurt. After all, it was understandable that Scratch was so irritated and aggressive; she had been waiting for revenge longer than I had. This was what I wanted. Wasn't it? I tossed and turned all night, barely getting any sleep. I felt uneasy. I felt as if I was doing something wrong. I didn't know if I could go through with the plan. The next day, I met Scratch at her lab. I needed to clear my conscience, to tell her that I wasn't going to be part of the plan unless we could change it. Nobody else should get hurt for my revenge. When I explained myself, I could tell that Scratch was mad. \"You idiot, this is the only time the plan will work,\" Scratch shouted. \"You don't understand it because you only know part of the plan.\" \"Part? What haven't you told me?\" I inquired, suspicious. \"It's for your own safety that I can't tell you,\" Scratch answered, her voice low and dark. I wasn't buying that. After all the work I had done, why didn't she trust me? I could tell that Scratch was irritated with me, but I was mad. Before another word could be exchanged between the two of us, I reached out and grabbed the grubby garment Scratch was always hiding under. It was time to find out who I was dealing with. Once I had uncovered her, I heard a screech as if she were in pain. \"Don't look at me,\" Scratch cried out. I hadn't been sure what to expect. Maybe some grotesque midget with boils and puss-filled sores. Something hideous. I would never have guessed what I really saw. Scratch turned out to be a fluffy gray kitty-cat. Most of you in my position would have done a number of things. Maybe you would have pointed and laughed. Or talked to Scratch in baby language because you absolutely love cats. Or perhaps you would have screamed and ran away; after all, a talking cat is pretty freaky. But none of you would have done what I did. I fell to my knees and placed my hands and forehead to the ground. If you would recall in an earlier chapter, I talked about a golden statue of my village's animal patron, Chasca. Long ago, before my village existed, a group of rich retirees had a desire to live in the country, far from the city yet close enough for grandchildren to visit. They settled in a beautiful valley that later became my village. The richest and eldest of them all, an elderly widow, persuaded the others that they needed an animal patron to watch over their small community. It was little wonder that they chose Chasca, the Sacred Cat, with how many widows lived there. The local cat population was higher than people and llamas put together. As time went on, the village had a golden statue with blue sapphire eyes made, and it has been honored in my village ever since. I even brought it with me on my first visit to the capital for good luck. Some luck. With how much my village revered the divine image of our cat deity, it was no wonder that when I saw a talking cat that was the very likeness of the Chasca statue, I took Scratch as divine. \"Don't look at me!\" she screeched, which I took as a divine command. \"Forgive this inferior one for looking upon thee,\" I said to Scratch/Chasca in a frightened voice. \"This one did not know it was thee in disguise, oh Sacred Cat.\" \"Sacred Cat?\" I thought I heard Scratch/Chasca murmur. Then she chuckled. \"It's alright. You may sit up.\" Smiling, I did. It was a gift to gaze at the divine image of Chasca. I stayed in a kneeling position, the proper position for one as low as I was. \"Please, also forgive this lowly one for questioning thou most cunning plan. If this one had known it was thee in disguise, this one would have obeyed. This repentant one awaits punishment.\" \"Er. . .there will be no punishment,\" Scratch/Chasca said boldly. \"I hid myself to test your faith. But now that I have been revealed, it is now your duty to obey me without question.\" \"Yes, O Sacred Cat,\" I said, bowing again. Scratch/Chasca continued to work in her lab, ordering me about or out into the city whenever she needed something. She seemed more comfortable without the dirty cloth covering her. I was glad she trusted me to continue to look at her physical form. I was proud to serve her. My doubts about her plan left me. After all, if a deity wanted Kuzco punished, then his crimes were much worse than I thought. Not only was her presence a confirmation that what I was doing was the right thing, but I had the hope that I would have a way to return home. With Chasca's blessing, my parents and village would accept me back. I would no longer be an outcast. For the rest of the day, I bustled all over, doing everything Scratch/Chasca asked of me. I supervised the final touches of the plan. Because I had learned of her secret, she revealed the final part of her plot against Kuzco For the past month, she had been slowly tempting Kuzco to spend the empire's funds. It was only more proof of Kuzco's greed that he took no heed that his kingdom was almost broke. It was another nail in his coffin. A man that would spend his people's money so foolishly didn't deserve to be emperor. Evening came. The time had arrived for my crucial role to lure Kuzco into the trap. As I walked to the palace, I paused to look at myself in the reflection of a fountain. I still wore my luxurious clothing from home. I tried to keep myself looking nice, kept my face clean and my hands smooth and soft. Then I realized that I was suppose to be playing the part of a local girl. My clothing, my appearance, wouldn't be fooling anyone. I needed to look like any other person on the street. I hated doing it, but I took some water and dirty, mixed them together and rubbed a little on my face and hands. Sighing heavily, I also dusted my clothing, hoping that Kuzco wouldn't notice how nice they were. If he did, would he be able to figure out that this was an elaborate trap? *Snort* As if. As I was leaving the fountain, I ran into Kuzco and his bodyguard. His sudden appearance left me feeling weak and my brain empty. Especially the bodyguard. He was tall, solidly built and could totally ruin everything. But I had a deity watching over me. \"Hello!\" I called out, louder than I intended. I felt brave and nervous at the same time. Kuzco leaped high in the air and screamed like a girl. I smiled to myself. Oh, hearing that scream felt so good. \"Oh, sorry,\" I apologized, backing away to give him some space. \"No, it's alright,\" Kuzco said, his smarmy smile back on his face. I twirled my hair around my fingers as I wracked my mind for my next line. Being in his presence made me jittery. I had to remind myself that we weren't near any windows he could have his bodyguard throw me out of. \"Do I. . .know you?\" Kuzco asked. Oh, fish heads, I thought, panicking. He suspects! \"Uh. . .well. . .you're Emperor Kuzco, right?\" I stuttered through a sentence woodenly. Great job, girl , I told myself sarcastically. \"Yeah. . .\" Kuzco looked at if I was a dirty napkin that was left on his throne. I wanted to punch him right there. \"Great. I was just on my way to the palace with a message for you,\" I said quickly. \"If you're looking for a handout, you must fill out a form with my adviser,\" Kuzco said before I could say anything more. I couldn't believe what he just said. He thought I was a beggar. Of all the low-down things to say. I could feel my temper rising, and I almost went crazy again, but I quelled it. Instead I smiled and said, \"No. . . No, that's not what I want. I'm here with an invitation for you.\" \"An invitation?\" \"Yes. Your people, who love you very much, want to do something in return for your generosity and kindness,\" I said, wanting to choke on my own words. \"I was sent to tell you that there will be a parade being held in your honor.\" \"A parade?!\" Kuzco exclaimed at the same time as his bodyguard. I went on excitedly, as if I were talking to a six-year-old. \"Yes, a big parade. It'll have floats and balloons and acrobats and. . .clowns. . .and all sorts of things,\" I said, rambling. Then I remembered the coup de gr â ce. \"And fireworks at the end.\" I could see that Kuzco was hooked. His eyes sparkled with happiness and greed. I smirked, thinking, You're gonna get it . His bodyguard was just as excited, jumping up and down while clapping his hands. I realized that while this bodyguard looked formidable, he was more like an overgrown kid. I had nothing to fear. Before I could react, Kuzco grabbed my shoulders and pulled me close. \"Wow, that sounds great. I can't wait. This is amazing. Is it tomorrow? Or next week? I hope it's tomorrow. I can't wait.\" \"Uh. . .then you don't have to wait. . .because it's happening right now,\" I said, smiling like an idiot, hoping Kuzco would let me go. \"Wha-you mean right now, right now?\" Kuzco asked, taking a step back. \"Of course. Your people wanted to surprise you,\" I said, batting my eyes at him innocently. I watch the emperor closely. This was a critical point in the plot. If Kuzco was actually a good guy, if he did change, then he would walk away from everything and go to El Burro's. Or he would prove that he is a selfish git and come to The Parade. \"I don't suppose it could wait until tomorrow?\" he pleaded. I acted appalled. \"But the performers are already here. Your people used their own money to prepare this all for YOU.\" You know the expression: Everyone loves a parade. \"I suppose I could go for a while. I can make a quick appearance and still make it to Tipo's party,\" Kuzco mulled. The bodyguard cinched it. \"I can't think of anything that could go wrong with this plan,\" he said with a shrug. Kuzco shrugged as well. \"Well, alrighty then. Lead the way.\" I guided the two men through the empty streets. Earlier I had advertised to the masses, telling them about The Parade. There was sure to be a large crowd along The Parade route. The procession was ready to start when I ushered Kuzco up the biggest, grandest float. His bodyguard took his place at Kuzco's side. I signaled for everyone to begin. I would have liked to watch The Parade. It would have been a once in a life-time opportunity to see such a grand thing. Even in my comfortable living in a small, rich village, I had never seen a parade. But there was one more job that needed to be done. I raced through the crowd as fast as I could. I guess \"raced\" isn't exactly the word for it; it was more like I \"oozed\" through the crowd, battling for every foot I gained. I finally made it to El Burro's Cheezy Burritos, the final destination of The Parade route. Already people were leaving the establishment to join the crowd waiting for The Parade. I burst into the restaurant and shouted for everyone to come see the emperor's parade. Whoever hadn't joined the crowd emptied out of El Burro's like water in a sieve. The last to leave was a family who I assumed was Kuzco's friends. It pained me to see the shock on the father's face when I made the announcement, and the little boy's was heart-breaking. I pushed that away. After all, it was Chasca's divine plan. With my job done, I was able to enjoy the rest of The Parade. But after seeing the little boy's face, I couldn't enjoy anything, not even the fireworks. \"Get ready. He's spotted them,\" Scratch/Chasca whispered to me. I hadn't seen her approach and was surprised she even found me in the large crowd. At the position we were standing, we had a clear view of Kuzco and his bodyguard on the float. I was close enough to the emperor's float that I could see the exact moment his face fell from exhilarating ecstasy to shameful shock. As the crowd cheered and screamed, his body sagged and weakened. I looked back on the family. The father put one arm around his wife, the other in front of his two children and directed them away from the sight. \"Pacha!\" Kuzco shouted from the float. He descended the stairs rapidly, followed closely by his bodyguard. \"Drat it. Why is Kronk involved?\" Scratch/Chasca hissed. I was confused by this, but I watched wordlessly. I wasn't about to interrupt the scene with a question. Once off the float, Kuzco ran to Pacha, calling all their names. The Parade continued down the street, heedless that the emperor wasn't on his float. The people on the streets either followed after to stay with the fun or moved away to go back to their lives. With the streets emptying, it was easier to hear what Kuzco and his friend were saying. \"Pacha, wait a minute. This isn't what it looks like,\" Kuzco pleaded. \"Really? Because it looks like you lied to my son,\" Pacha accused, still moving his family away. \"No, that's not it. . . it was. . .\" Pacha stopped and glared at Kuzco. \"I know you didn't want to come, but you could have just shown up for a couple of minutes. I never would have though that you'd lie to my face so you could throw this extravaganza for yourself. Come on, Tipo. Let's go finish your birthday party.\" \"Hey, I didn't miss it. I can still come, can't I?\" Kuzco asked, looking down trodden. \"I can make it up to him. I'll buy the biggest birthday cake El Burro has. We'll make this the best birthday ever.\" \"Trying to smooth things out with money? We'll see about that,\" Scratch/Chasca chuckled. She waved a paw from under her dirty cloth. This seemed like a signal, but I wasn't sure what it was for. I spotted a pair of men nearby who was leading a small, nervous looking man toward the emperor. Once the little man saw Kuzco, the two large men slunk into the shadows. \"Emperor Kuzco! Emperor Kuzco!\" the adviser shouted, waving one arm while his other was filled with scrolls. \"I've been looking for you all over. We have an emergency at the palace.\" Kuzco sighed angrily. \"Can't it wait? I'm in the middle of something.\" \"No. It's the bill collectors. They're pounding down the doors of the palace,\" the little man shrieked, his brow dripping with sweat. \"Then pay them,\" Kuzco ordered. \"That's your job isn't it. You're my finance guy.\" \"I'm your financial adviser ,\" the little man yelled. \"And I can hardly do my job when you don't listen to my advice, which is why the empire is broke.\" Realizing he was yelling at the emperor, he bowed and added in a softer tone, \"Your Highness.\" \"What?!\" Kuzco exclaimed, looking nervous himself. \"But. . .it's the empire. It can't go broke.\" Pacha snorted. \"I guess you didn't know how much a parade cost. You haven't changed like I thought you did, Kuzco.\" The large man gathered his family once more and reentered the restaurant. Kuzco looked as if he were going to follow, but his adviser grabbed his robe and wouldn't let go. \"Sire, please. They're going to ransack the palace. You need to speak to them this minute,\" the little man insisted. \"It's your duty.\" Kuzco looked at El Burro's Cheezy Burrito, his face the epitome of pain. I had to admit, my heart actually went out to the emperor. But my sympathy was more for Pacha and his family. To assuage my guilt, I told myself that it was better this way. It was better for them to be disappointed now rather than later. Kuzco didn't follow after Pacha. Instead, he started striding toward the palace with his back straight, his arm linked with his adviser. \"I want you to go back to the palace and pay the debtors in gold.\" Scratch/Chasca followed after them softly, glad for the bodyguard's broad back that kept us hidden from view. \"What gold? There isn't any,\" the adviser said, his voice trembling. \"Whatever gold you can find,\" Kuzco said. He sounded far more mature than ever I heard him. \"Go through my room. Take all my jewelery. Give them the dishes, the doorknobs, anything that can be removed. Pick it off the palace walls if you have to, but pay them in full.\" The adviser protested. \"B-but all those are relics. They've been part of the palace for generations.\" \"I know,\" Kuzco said seriously. \"I'm sure my ancestors would understand that paying one's debt is more important.\" The adviser looked relieved, bowed and said with fervor, \"Yes, Sire.\" As he ran on ahead, he looked back to see if Kuzco would follow. After all, he didn't want to meet with the debt collectors by himself. \"Don't worry. I'll catch up,\" Kuzco said, waving him ahead. \"I think I want to be alone for a while.\" As Kuzco walk by himself (with his bodyguard of course), I was confused. This wasn't the revenge I expected. I thought that there would be more crying, more screaming, more feeling satisfied. I didn't expect for Kuzco to meet with disaster with such. . .maturity. It redeemed Kuzco's image in my eyes a little. But not enough. The horrible things he had done to me were still fresh. I still wanted satisfaction. It was as if Scratch/Chasca read my mind. \"Now, we go in for the kill,\" she whispered in pleasure. \"It is time to gloat.\" \"To gloat?\" I asked, confused. I didn't want to say another word to Kuzco, much less gloat. \"How else is Kuzco going to know who set up such a marvelous plan? How can the punishment fit the crime unless he know who did it to him and why?\" The cat deity had a point, so I followed after as she approached Kuzco. By this time, Kuzco and his bodyguard had wandered down an empty street. The sun had gone down minutes ago, but it still wasn't too late. I could hear a bar nearby still open, men singing loudly a drinking song. \"This has got to be the worst day of my life,\" Kuzco moaned into his hands. \"Even worse than being turned into a llama.\" Either he's gone insane, or he's very imaginative, I thought to myself. Feeling as if this was now my last chance to feel vindicated, I marched up to Kuzco, ready to say my piece. \"Look who's hit rock bottom,\" I tried to gloat, but it must have sounded like bad acting. Both Kronk and Kuzco glanced at me. \"Oh, hey,\" Kuzco said, giving me a sad wave. \"Could you tell everyone thanks for The Parade? It was fantastic, but I didn't deserve it.\" \"Yeah, you didn't,\" I added lamely. \"And you don't deserve to be emperor either.\" \"Tell me about it,\" Kuzco agreed. \"I don't deserve great friends like Pacha and his family.\" This wasn't going like I played it out in my mind. He wasn't suppose to agree with me. \"Now you know what it feels like,\" I tried again, although my voice became angry. \"What? You mean dirt? Is this what dirt feels like?\" Kuzco moaned. \"No!\" I shouted. \"What it feels like to be me. This is exactly what it feels like to lose everything you have and be completely alone. How does it feel, Emperor ?\" For a while, Kuzco didn't move. Then he looked at me, his eyes squinting in the fading light. \"That voice,\" he whispered. \"It sounds so familiar.\" \"Yeah, you should remember me,\" I hissed. \"You ruined my life. You are the most selfish, conceited person I have ever met. Because of your actions, my family disowned me. Doesn't feel so great being on the other side of things, does it?\" \"I do know you,\" Kuzco whispered, his eyes wide. \"Yeah, you should, Kuzco,\" Kronk said. \"She's the one who brought us to The Parade. It wasn't that long ago.\" \"No, I know her from before,\" Kuzco said flatly. \"You were that girl with the crazy parents that tried to get me to marry you.\" \"And because you wouldn't take me even as your scullery maid, they didn't think I was worth keeping,\" I yelled. By this time, I was on full emotions. Admitting that my parents believed I was worthless opened up old wounds. \"But I knew you before that,\" Kuzco said, his face twisting as his brain tried to recall our first encounter. \"AH! You're that crazy girl that tried to kill me.\" \"Only because of the horrible things you said to me,\" I screamed, pointing a finger at him. \"It's a wonder nobody else has tried. Then you threw me out a window.\" Kronk gasped. \"Kuzco, you threw a young lady out the window?\" \"No,\" Kuzco defended. \"I had my guards do it for me.\" Kronk glared at him. \"Oh, that is so wrong.\" \"I don't do that anymore. Jeez, how many times do I have to apologize for throwing people out the window? It's not like anyone ever got hurt,\" Kuzco yelled in frustration, throwing his arms up. \"Okay, maybe they did get hurt, but nobody died!\" \"And I'm not the only one who was hurt,\" I said softly, getting their attention back to me. \"There are many others who you've wronged. Well, we've had our revenge.\" \"Revenge? You mean The Parade. . .?\" \"Yes. Didn't you like my orchestrated performance?\" a squeaky voice said from the darkness behind me. \"It was all for you.\" Scratch/Chasca moved up beside me, hidden under her filthy cloth. \"That voice,\" Kuzco said, horrified. \"Where do I know that voice?\" \"Perhaps this will help you remember,\" Scratch/Chasca shouted. Before anyone could react, the cat deity, in her disguise, leaped into the air right at Kuzco's head. She latched onto the emperor's face, her claws digging into his scalp. See, I'm not the only one who flies into murderous furry whenever I see Kuzco. Kuzco flailed his arms frantically, his screams muffled. \"Hold on, buddy,\" Kronk called, grabbing hold of Scratch/Chasca with two hands. After some pulling, he dislodged my companion. The dirty cloth dropped. Kronk gasped when he saw he was holding a cat. \"Yzma!\" he exclaimed, dropping the cat. Choking sounds came from Kuzco. I turned to see that he was pulling something out of his mouth. In the last rays of the sun I could see it was a small vial with a pinkish liquid still in it, much like those in Scratch/Chasca's lab. \"Yzma?!\" Kuzco sputtered, still coughing on the liquid. \"Yes, you fool,\" Scratch/Chasca laughed. \"You thought you had see the last of me. Well, you didn't. You fell right into my trap.\" Kronk glared down at Scratch/Chasca/Yzma. \"So, that's why you stopped coming to Junior Chipmunks. I thought it was suspicious.\" I was quite confused by this turn of events. All I could do was stare. What were they saying? Why were they calling Chasca by that name? \"Trap?\" Kuzco cried out, his voice high. He looked down at the vial in his hand. \"You poisoned me?!\" \"Look again,\" Scratch/Chasca/Yzma purred. \"It's the same exact potion I gave you when you fired me.\" Kuzco's face went ashen. \"You don't mean. . .\" \"I sure do,\" Scratch/Chasca/Yzma cackled. \"Have a wonderful time eating grass.\" \"Noooooooo. I don't wanna be a llama again.\" Kuzco looked as if he were going to bawl like a baby, then he twisted his expression to that of loathing. \"Well, take this, pussy cat.\" Kuzco launched the vial as hard as he could at Scratch/Chasca/Yzma. My feline benefactor was quite fast and dodged the projectile. To everyone's amazement, the vial didn't shatter against the cobblestones. No, it was quite lucky. Unfortunately, I was not. The bottle ricocheted from the ground and hit me in the face. It wasn't enough to knock me out, but hitting the road on the way down did.[Chapter 7] (Author's Note: This chapter has been edited. 12/20/2016.) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 7: A Change For the Bad By Emilou If anyone would like to know what Llama Juice tastes like, it's actually quite pleasant. It tastes like cherries mixed with vanilla and just a dash of cinnamon. It has a unnaturally cool, but refreshing, taste as if chilled. I would not suggest drinking it. The after-taste is that of mold and sweat. Disgusting. Oh, and it'll turn you into a llama. So don't drink Llama Juice. Not that I, at first, recognized the taste. I was preoccupied with the furry ball that smelled of sour milk attacking my face. I was able to stay calm until Kronk rescued me from my plight. Once free from my tormenter, minus some hair and skin, I coughed and sputtered until I could pull out the small vial that had been forced into my mouth. I took big, deep breaths of sweet, sweet air. \"Yzma!\" I heard Kronk gasp. \"Yzma?!\" I repeated. \"Yes, you fool,\" Yzma laughed evilly from the ground. \"You thought you had see the last of me. Well, you didn't. You fell right into my trap.\" Kronk said something about chipmunks (I hate those things), but I was too occupied with the after-taste that was rising up my throat. \"Trap!? You poisoned me?!\" I cried out, realizing what I had pulled out of my mouth. Even as I said those words, I knew it wasn't quite right. The taste was too familiar to me. \"Look again,\" Yzma purred with satisfaction. \"It's the same exact potion I gave you when you fired me.\" \"You don't mean. . .\" I started to say. I could feel the potion starting to work on my body right then and there. \"I sure do. Have a wonderful time eating grass,\" the small cat cackled with a wicked grin. \"Noooooo. I don't want to be a llama again,\" I shouted to the world. There was a white hot pain in my hands, and I could feel my fingers melting together to form a cloven hoof. Well, I thought to myself, if I'm going down, I'm taking her with me. \"Well, take this, pussy cat,\" I declared and hurled the bottle as hard as I could at Yzma. Whether it was from feline instinct or that Yzma was really good at dodging, I missed my mark. Instead, it defied all reason by bouncing off the cobblestone road and ricocheting up to the face of Yzma's companion. (I don't know who makes those vials, but they are a master glass-maker.) The girl had no time to react and fell like a stone to the ground once the vial connected with her face. Kronk made a sound that was a mixture of a gasp and a squeal. He rushed to the fallen girl, touching her carefully. \"Miss. Miss. Are you okay?\" he called out. \"She's unconscious and her head is bleeding. She needs help.\" \" She needs help?! I'm turning into a llama,\" I shouted at Kronk. My hands had already transformed, and I could feel the same happening to my face. \"Get Yzma, Kronk. She should have the antidote,\" I ordered, pointing at the fluffy cat. Squeaky laughter shouldn't be scary, but Yzma's sent chills down my spine as she giggled at my plight. \"You idiot. Don't you think if I had the antidote I would have used it on myself? No, there isn't one. You may have destroyed my laboratory, but I still remember the ingredients to all my potions. I made that one with you in mind.\" I felt my legs give out as they turned into the shaggy ones of a llama. I wanted to sit down and cry. I wanted to pound on the earth. I wanted revenge. \"If I have to spend the rest of my life as a llama, I'm not going to be the only one,\" I said, remembering I hadn't finished off the vial. \"I'll shove the rest of that potion down your throat.\" \"Uh, Kuzco,\" I heard Kronk say in a small voice. \"Something's wrong with this girl.\" \"Not now, Kronk,\" I shot at him, pouncing onto Yzma. I kept a hold of her as best I could with my half-human, half-llama body. \"Hand me the vial. I can't wait to see her as a wrinkled, old llama.\" \"OLD!\" Yzma hissed at me, turning into a whirlwind of flying fur and claws. I stomped down on her, pushing her into the ground so her claws were useless. \"Kuzco. There's a big problem,\" Kronk shouted. \"What?\" I replied angrily. That's when I saw Kronk holding up the empty vial. Yzma giggled insanely. \"Don't tell me it all spilled out,\" I moaned. \"Not exactly,\" Kronk said, moving so I could see the unconscious young woman he had been tending to. In an instant, her face changed into a llama's. \"Whoa. I didn't see that one coming,\" I muttered. Not that I was completely surprised. My life was turning into a complete fiasco. I really had no control over anything. This proved even more when Yzma slipped out from under my hooves, rocketing away into the darkness. I tried to follow, but I hadn't gotten used to my clumsy llama legs yet. \"Kronk, you have to get her!\" I ordered. \"We can force her to make an antidote.\" \"I'm on it,\" Kronk said with a salute, his usual crooked smile on his face. I swear, he's not happy unless he's following someone's orders. He carefully repositioned the young woman's (now a llama's) head so she was more comfortable, then loped off, his gait akin to that of an over-sized puppy. I had the utmost confidence that Kronk could find Yzma. He was the only person I knew who had a broad social network of obscure people and rodents to help him track down the evil feline. I actually believed at that point he'd be back a split second later, Yzma's scruff in his grasp. However, after standing around the darkened streets for a good twenty minutes, I realized he wasn't returning any time soon. Not knowing what else to do, I looked around the night for a hint of where I should go or what I should do. My first inclination was to return to my palace; after all, my state of being a llama shouldn't pose as a problem. My guards were knowledgeable of Yzma's potions. But showing my face after falling into such an embarrassing trap was more shame than I wanted to go through. My second choice was to find Pacha. He had more experience than anyone on how to deal with llamas as well as llamas that used to be human. But after the fight we just had and the disappointment on Tipo's face, I was unsure he would be willing to help me. Was that fight the end of our friendship? Was that the proverbial straw that broke Pacha's patience with me? Whether or not Pacha still considered me his friend, I was sure he was still a good enough person to help my plight. He'd done it once, he'd do it again. Bless that conscience of his. As I started to mosey off in my chosen destination, I felt as if I was missing something. What was it? Did I turn off the oven? No, that wasn't it. Did I miss a meal? There was a moan. I glanced behind me to see Yzma's little hench-girl still lying on the cobblestones, now completely transformed into a llama. I admit that I was tempted to leave her on the streets. No, tempted isn't a strong enough word. I wanted her to stay there in abject misery to suffer ten times what I went through. Let her wake up and find the shock of being a llama. But that annoying voice inside me insisted that she wasn't entirely guilty. Yzma could be quite persuasive and was the one orchestrating the night's events. This girl was just as to blame as Kronk. Pacha must have been rubbing off on me because I turned back for her. In the best llama fashion I could, I grabbed the collar of her clothing in my teeth and dragged her away. I didn't expect to drag her all the way to the palace, just somewhere where she would be safe for a few hours. But after a few feet, I had to take a break. \"You're so heavy,\" I grumbled, massaging my neck where it was starting to kink. My teeth ached, and I was running out of energy. \"Who knew women were so much work.\" I'll say this right now, if I had abandoned the girl right there, I would have saved myself a lot of grief. For at that moment, our presence was graced by two men, one who seemed to have been drinking too much since he was singing at the top of his lungs. The other man was attempting to hold up his friend and walk straight. The solo singer must have just begun his serenades since I didn't hear them until they were close by. \"Llama Gals, won't ya come out toni', come out toni', come out toni'.\" \"Zolin, do you really have to do that in my ear?\" \"Come on. I have the voice of an angel,\" Zolin said, his words slurred. \"By the light of the moon!\" Seeing that the two men were bee-lining directly toward us, I redoubled my efforts in dragging the heavy girl across the street. My efforts were in vain. I heard two surprised cries and the sound of pottery shattering mixed with liquid splashing. This cacophony confirmed my fear that the men had discovered the female llama body. Instinctively, I back away, abandoning the girl. \"What is this? I think we tripped over a rock,\" Zolin called out far too loudly than needed. \"Or a dead body.\" \"It seems to be an alpaca,\" his companion said. \"It's not moving, but I feel it breathing. Some unfortunate farmer must have lost it, probably for the Merchant's March.\" \"His loss,\" Zolin said jollily. \"Good thing our herd isn't too far away.\" \"Then we must hurry,\" the unnamed man said quietly. \"We'll need to remove any brands or tags immediately.\" The moon, which was slow to rise, gave enough light for me to see the two men working together to move the female llama. The drunken one worked with fervor, but it seemed the alcohol he'd consumed made him more of a liability than an asset. I would have let my assailant be sold into llama servitude if it wasn't for Kronk. I know he'd be disappointed in me if I didn't do something. Besides, I wanted to punish her myself. Keeping to the darker shadows, I spoke up, \"Good sirs, I believe that is MY llama. I've been looking for her.\" The men immediately stiffened and backed away. The unnamed one replied, \"Oh, is it? We were just checking to see if the beast was well. After all, we first thought it was dead.\" \"No. No. She's just. . .ah. . .narcoleptic? Yeah, she falls asleep all the time in the strangest of places,\" I lied. \"The kids love it. She'll be running around, then suddenly THUD, she's asleep. Heh heh.\" \"Sounds like you're quite attached to her,\" the unnamed man said. \"I don't suppose there is a reward for finding her.\" I could not believe these guys. Not only were they willing to take a llama that didn't belong to them, but they wanted a reward for just tripping over her. I smelled sleaze. \"Sorry, no reward,\" I said quickly. \"Have a good night, gentlemen.\" I gave my voice a specific tone that said I wanted to be left alone. But apparently Zolin didn't quite catch it. \"Let's give you s' help,\" he said sloppily, moving to the female llama unsteadily. \"These beasts are heavy.\" Tell me about it, I thought. \"That's alright. I don't want to trouble you.\" No doubt, they'd want a reward for dragging a llama around, too. \"S' no trouble,\" Zolin insisted, grabbing the female llama's head. The jerky movement of her head cause the girl to wake up enough to murmur something that sounded like, \"One more minute, mom.\" Zolin jumped back in surprise. \"Did you hear that?\" \"I heard nothing,\" I answered. I dared not move from shadow least they discover my own transformation by the light of the moon. \"That llama just spoke,\" Zolin cried out in amazement. \"I believe it's an alpaca,\" his friend corrected. \"And animals don't talk.\" I pegged Zolin's companion as one of those guys who couldn't let anything slide and had to correct everything. \"Look, she sometimes sounds like she can speak, but it's just gas,\" I told them, wishing they would disappear. \"Hold on, let me light my torch,\" Zolin said. I could hear him groping around on his person. Dread filled me as I heard the familiar sound of flint and steel scrapping against each other followed by a fire sputtering to life. I then laid eyes on these two men. Both were around normal height, but the one called Zolin was a little pudgier than the other. Zolin also sported a rough, few-day old beard and unkempt clothing. The one with no name was well groomed, had nice clothing and a neat little beard. And both stared at me with wide eyes as if I had been transformed into a. . . Oh, wait, I am a llama. Silly me, I thought. My brain went blank, so I said the first thing on my mind. \"Neigh?\" The two men looked even more shocked at my one word, so my mouth began to run without consulting my brain. \"Oh, wait. It's horses that go 'Neigh\". Ha ha. What does a llama say?\" The unnamed man jumped and issued a high-pitched squeal while pointing at me as if I were a hairy spider in his bathtub. Zolin's mouth dropped into a gaping smile. \"There's two talking llamas,\" he chuckled. \"I must be drunker than I thought.\" \"But I'm not,\" Zolin's friend declared in bewilderment. \"A real talking llama. And he's standing like a person.\" Oh, yeah. . .I guess llamas don't stand like this, I though. \"Come on, llama. Say something else,\" Zolin said as he grabbed my face. \"Can you fly, llama?\" \"No, and let go,\" I grumbled, slapping away his hands. \"I'm not a llama. I was turned into one.\" Zolin laughed, rubbing my neck like one would do an ordinary llama. Did I look like a petting zoo? \"You're funny, llama. Let's take him home,\" Zolin pleaded, looking at his friend like a child who found a puppy. \"Or better yet, let's take them both. I'm sure we can sell them for a good amount of money to an exotic animal collector. Or a circus,\" the other one said. \"Yay, I like circuses,\" Zolin cheered. I didn't like how this conversation was going. I decided to make myself scarce, girl or no girl. The trouble was that running on two feet wasn't something a llama body was made to do. I didn't get far before I tripped on my own hooves, tumbling to the cobblestones. Just as the pain of my fall set in, I felt a human body pile on top of me, squeezing out my breath. \"Good job, Zolin. Keep him still while I go get the cart,\" the other man said. Not to give up, I used my most powerful weapon against Zolin. My mouth. \"Help! Someone help me. Llama nappers. Thieves. Don't let them get away,\" I shouted, hoping that someone could hear me. \"Shut him up, Zolin.\" That was the last thing I heard before a sharp pain was administered to the back of my neck, and things went dark. So, my day ended with me being turned into a llama and knocked out. Funny how my life goes around in circles.[Chapter 8] (Author's Notes: Because it's been so long since I updated, all the previous chapters have been rewritten. I felt I needed to so that my writing style matches. Since the last time I updated, I felt I have done a lot of growing and that my style has changed. Nothing about the story has changed, but I would suggest re-reading past chapters. I thank all my followers and readers for their comments and reviews. I do read them, often several times, especially on days that I've been down.) Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 8: Two for the Road By: Emilou aka Hatashi Kitty Now you know the truth, everyone. I've been turned into an alpaca. Yes, you heard me, Kuzco. An al-pa-ca. So much better than a stupid, smelly llama, ha ha. Anyway, I would love to continue narrating what happened next, but unfortunately I had been knocked unconscious due to the vial Kuzco had thrown at me, so I had no idea what happened next. But neither did Kuzco. Lucky for you, there is a third point-of-view that can continue the narration. So, I magnanimously give my next chapter to the one person who can reveal what comes next. Kronk, you now have the floor. Oh, thanks. No one has ever given me a floor before. You're a real peach, Quillana. No, I mean, you can tell your part of the story, Kronk. Right. Can they hear me? I mean, tell who I am? Hello? Yes, they can. Oh wow! I have my own font and everything. This is really swell. It so nice of you to give up your chapter for me. Don't mention it. Ah-hem. Where do I start? Kuzco sent you after the cat. Right. So, seeing Yzma again brought about a lot of hard memories for me. After all, our relationship ended kind of abruptly when she tried to kill me. We've seen each other off and on during her community service with the Chipmunks, but I always felt as if there was some undue hostility directed toward me. And she didn't even earn one badge. Not one. Oh, yeah. The story. After I made sure the alpaca-girl was comfortable, Kuzco ordered me to go after Yzma. Let me tell you, following Yzma wasn't easy. Have you ever had to run after a cat that escaped out the front door? Then you know what I'm talking about. Cats can just disappear. They're like scary animal-ninjas. I set about using my tracking skills that I learned in Junior Chipmunks. It's practically impossible tracking a cat on stone roads, but due to my finely tuned nose that I developed why refining my culinary talents, I was able to follow the smell of sour milk. Plus, I think Yzma had gotten into a little catnip. That stuff sure was strong, let me tell ya. Anywho, I was on her trail, dodging down alleys and hopping over fences. Boy, did I get a workout. My gluts were burning by the end of the night. Remember kids, you'll never regret skipping leg day at the gym. Ahem. Right. On with the story. There were a few times I had lost her, but never for long. Even though the streets were empty of people, there were still plenty of witnesses that were able to point me in the right direction. Outdoor pets, strays and rats were ready to help me out. I always carry around a pack of jerky for just so an occasion (plus for whenever I get hungry). It is good manners to give food as a thank you for most animals. It's only polite. Finally, after an hour of following, I could see her cute fluffy tail waving in the distance. As I stalked closer, I couldn't help thinking to myself, Tonight is such a gorgeous night. That moon is really full. Any other night, I wouldn't have been able to see two feet in front of me. Blending into my surroundings, I tiptoed closer, sliding against the walls like a fly stalking some rancid meat. Closer I crept, silent as a sandwich. Downwind of Yzma, I could hear her as she mumbled to herself. \"Now that my revenge is complete, I can get my beautiful body back,\" Yzma cackled to herself. There was a sound of paper rustling. I could see some paper in her hands. . .er. . .paws. Her feline eyes must have been amazing, because she read the writing on the paper as if it were daylight. It sounded like a shopping list or a recipe. It was short, only about five items, including a \"secret ingredient.\" I never took Yzma as the home-maker type. Of course, as her henchman, I always thought she enjoyed my cooking. Now, I'm suspecting she only wanted me for my body. You think you know a person. . . After Yzma read the list, she muttered, \"I forgot how rare some of these ingredients are. Curse that Kuzco for destroying my lab. This might take more time than I thought. No matter. Once I make this potion, I'll be human again.\" It was then that I realized the list held the ingredients to make one of her potions. More than likely, Kuzco would want that list. Creeping along-side Yzma, I was nearly upon her when she turned around and spotted me. I wasn't sure how she heard me. I'm always quiet when in Sneak Mode. You were singing your \"spy\" theme song again, Kronk. Kuzco! Get out of my chapter. I'm not doing anything. Get out. Go! Ow! Alright, I'm going. Sheesh. Back to you, Kronk. So, she had just spotted me. Before she could dash away, I snatched her tail. Bad idea since she could turn around and scratch up my arm. Don't worry, I'm used to it. I earned my wildlife saving merit badge when I was four. I will never turn my back on a wild creature in need, even if it causes me bodily-injury. After wrestling with Yzma for a while, I grabbed the scruff of her neck so she couldn't scratch or bite me anymore. Yzma continued to struggle anyway. It was kind of cute to watcher her little whiskers twitching in irritation. I realized that I had covered a lot of ground chasing Yzma and would have to hike back to Kuzco holding an angry cat. That wasn't going to be easy. Plus, my arms and hands were bleeding from Yzma's wrath. I wanted to perform first aid before my wounds became infected. Lucky for me, the Merchant's March was in town (which I absolutely love, by the way) and a cart full of woven, animal cages was left near an inn. Coincidental, Karma, whatever it was, I was glad they were there. I shoved Yzma inside a cat-sized cage and place some coins in the cart. With the angry cat now secured, I took a look at my hands. I cursed the fact that I didn't have my first aid kit. My fellow Chipmunks would have shaken their heads shamefully at my lack of preparedness. I juggled over the idea of going to my apartment first before returning to Kuzco (my apartment was nearby), but my Shoulder Angel insisted that I see to my friend first. I've learned to listen to my Shoulder Angel. He's never led me astray. Unlike that other guy in the red pajamas. Okay, maybe one time, he did have the better idea, but most of the time its no good. Kronk. . . What are you talking about? Shoulder Devil. That's what I'm talking about. Okay. . .um, maybe you should quickly wrap things up. I'm coming to the best part. So, I decide to go back to Kuzco. I quickly retrace my steps where I left the emperor and the alpaca-girl. Unfortunately, when I get there, both of them are gone. I'll admit, I did panic a little. After all, it's not like I've lost the emperor twice. . .oh, wait. Yes, I have. I followed the two very distinct drag marks down the road and found two men (one completely inebriated, I might add) dragging what I determined was the body of Kuzco and the alpaca-girl to a livestock paddock. Both of them looked to be unconscious. I probably should have stayed back to determine the situation. After all, the Chipmunk rule for problem solving is: Assess, Process, Redress. But I didn't. Instead, I approached the two men. \"Well, hello there,\" I called out in a loud, cheerful voice. \"It looks as if you could use a hand there.\" The taller, sober one stopped dragging Kuzco and straightened up, popping his spine. \"Yes, we could. My friend and I had to catch a couple of our escaped animals. We had to tranquilize them,\" he explained quickly. I examined Kuzco in the light of their torches to see if he was okay. He was alive, which was a relief. \"I don't see any brands or markings on them,\" I said, trying not to sound suspicious. \"Are you sure these are yours? There are a lot of llamas around here.\" To show ownership, livestock usually have some sort tag or mark. Some people use collars or paint, but those who have large herds like to use brands or tags in pierced ears which are harder to remove. \"Oh, they're definitely ours,\" the drunk one replied, tottering in place. \"We took them fair and square.\" The tall one smiled oily. \"What my partner means is, we bought them today which is why they haven't been tagged yet. We're used pack-animal salesmen.\" \"Liar,\" Shoulder Angel muttered. \"Don't let them take the emperor or that girl.\" \"Ah, just let them go. The girl was working with Yzma. Besides, Kuzco is way too full of himself,\" Shoulder Devil sneered. \"You should be emperor in his stead.\" \"Shut up,\" I hissed at the little guy. \"What?\" the drunk man asked. \"Uh. . .shut up,\" I repeated, using a lighter tone. \"Someone wanted to get rid of these beautiful animals. That's such a crime.\" The taller one chuckled nervously. \"Tell you what, I'll make things easy for you,\" I told them. \"I've fallen in love with these animals that I'm going to buy them from you right now. I always wanted a llama and an alpaca.\" The two exchanged looks and fiddled with their hands. \"Oh, I don't know. These two are very special,\" the tall one said vaguely. \"They aren't ordinary animals. They're rare breeds.\" Driving up the price, huh? I thought. \"They can't be that special,\" I pressed. \"Look how skinny that one is. He's almost skin and bones.\" Sorry, Kuzco. \"They are delicate,\" the tall one argued. \"We can't just sell them to anyone. In fact, we have some costumers in mind that would pay a steep price for them. I'm sure a man like you would rather have a sturdier animal. We would be happy to show you a few.\" \"No, I want these two,\" I insisted. \"They're just what I'm looking for.\" \"You're looking for talking llamas?\" the drunk one inquired with wide eyes. The taller one shushed his companion. Things had taken a sharp turn toward the bad. If they knew Kuzco and the girl could talk, would it be better to try and persuade them that they were mistaken, or reveal to them the truth. Given the honesty of llama-dealers, I chose the former. \"Talking llamas? I think maybe you two have partied way too much,\" I laughed falsely. \"I assure you, sir, that this llama and alpaca do talk. Very clearly. I heard them myself,\" the tall one addressed me in a business-like voice. I tried to act surprised. \"If they can talk, then I definitely want them. Money isn't an issue,\" I told them boldly. At least, money isn't an issue for Kuzco. A plan was forming in my mind to run to the palace for the funds to free the emperor. My words ignited a spark in the tall salesman. \"In that case, let's make a deal,\" he said, rubbing his hands greedily. After helping the salesmen put Kuzco and the alpaca-girl into the paddock with a couple dozen other animals, we haggled over the price. Once agreed on a price, I promised to get the money right away. \"Perhaps it would be best if you return in the morning,\" the drunk one said with a yawn. I looked up at the moon, realizing how far it had traveled in the sky. It was quite late. While it seemed reasonable to wait, I didn't like the idea of leaving Kuzco and the alpaca-girl in the paddock longer than necessary. \"No, I want them tonight. I'll be quick,\" I pleaded. I prepared to sprint to the palace when the drunk one called to me. \"Hey, is this your cat,\" he shouted unnecessarily loud. He held Yzma's carrier. \"Yes, it is. Could you watch her for a while? I don't want to run with her.\" \"Why do you have your cat with you?\" the drunk one asked, sticking a finger into Yzma's box. He pulled it out in time to keep it. \"Uh. . .I was taking her for a walk,\" I lied. The two men gave me a strange look before shrugging. They told me which inn they were staying at since they didn't want to wait outside. With that, I waved as I raced toward the palace. When I reached the gates to Kuzco's home, they were locked fast. I pounded on them and shouted, but nobody heard me. In the end, I camped outside the large doors, sleeping on the stone road. When the sun began to rise, I woke up and knocked again. This time, I got a response from Kuzco's financial adviser. He cracked the gate open a little, and when he saw me, opened it all the way. \"Oh, it's you, Kronk. I thought you were another debt collector,\" he sighed in relief. \"I'm afraid we're going to have to temporarily let you go. The empire is broke, but we'll let you know when-\" \"Kuzco's in trouble,\" I interrupted the adviser. Blanching, the man let me in where I explained everything. When I came to the part about buying Kuzco from the llama salesmen, the adviser became white and wrung his hands. \"Oh my, oh my, oh my,\" he worried. \"There is no money left. The debt collectors ransacked the palace. There's not a speck of gold or silver anywhere,\" he cried out, on the brink of tears. \"But we need to get the emperor back,\" I insisted. \"Without him, there is no empire. There has to be a way.\" \"Oh, I wish I hadn't let the guards go,\" the adviser moaned. \"If they were still here, they could just seize the emperor.\" \"Maybe if I explain that Kuzco has been turned into a llama, they. . .,\" I started to say. \"No!\" the adviser shouted, distressed. \"It would break the emperor's heart if his subjects knew he was a llama. We can't let anyone know. Ever.\" \"Fine. But there's got to be another way to get the money.\" After some thinking, I suddenly had the best idea in the world. \"The Merchant's March!\" I shouted. \"What?\" the adviser inquired. I looked around the ransacked palace. The debt collectors had taken a lot, but not everything. There was still pieces of art, pottery and sculptures. I grabbed one. \"I can sell these on the Merchant's March and earn enough money to buy back the emperor,\" I proclaimed. The adviser slowly smiled. \"Yes. And other things. There are the royal dishes. We have so many sets, we can sell a few.\" \"And Kuzco's clothing. People would love to buy something that the emperor once wore.\" \"And rugs and tapestries. Some of the furniture could be sold,\" the adviser said excitedly. \"You can take everything. Hopefully, you can make enough to free the emperor as well as enough to get the empire going again.\" We ran all over the palace, grabbing anything that could be sold. With no other servants in the palace, we had to move everything ourselves. Lucky for us, the debt collectors left the carts and llamas alone (although they repossessed the horses). Soon, we had five carts full and ready to go, two llamas to each cart. Tying the llamas' leads to the back of carts, I felt I could manage the long train. We agreed I would go by myself. There was still a lot more stuff in the palace that the adviser would try to sell in town as well as keep up the appearance that Kuzco was still human. \"The Merchant's March has already started, but you may catch up,\" the adviser told me, ushering me on my way. \"I just hope nobody has bought Kuzco until I make enough money,\" I said worriedly. \"Heaven help up,\" the adviser whispered. It was up to me to save the day. As I lead my train of carts through the streets, I felt as if I was missing something. I went over my plan thoughtfully until I realized what it was. \"Yzma!\"[Chapter 9] Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 9: More Like Maniac's March By: Emilou aka Hatashi Kitty Hey, I would have given Kronk my chapter. He's my pal (and my cook), so I would have given anything for him. It's not my fault that Quillana was knocked out first. I bet she did it just to make me look bad. I'll tell you guys once more, I'm not the bad guy here. She's the one who teamed up with a psychopathic feline to ruin my reputation and turn me into a llama. Don't give in to her pathetic lies. It's not my fault that she's in this situation. And don't like her. Just don't. When I woke up from being knocked unconscious by the nefarious llama thieves, I could see that the sun was barely coming up over the mountains. Moving around, I could feel parts of my body aching all over. It was my head that hurt the most, not only from the lump forming, but also llama potion packs quite a punch. For a minute, as I let déjà vu wash over me like an icy rain; I wasn't sure where I was. It wasn't until I saw a herd of llamas stirring all around me that I remembered my changed body. Frantic to get away from the hellish beasts, I reached for the nearest non-llama thing nearby, which was the fence of the paddock. I grabbed onto it for dear life; my llama body not made for walking on two legs and thus awkward. \"Four feet, remember?\" I muttered to myself, testing the unnatural, yet familiar, position. \"Now to get out of here.\" I looked for the gate of the paddock and spied it nearby. Only about a dozen llama bodies were between me and freedom. \"Excuse me. Coming through,\" I told the llamas, trying to push my way through the crowd. Unfortunately, God didn't create llamas with the ability to listen. Most of the creatures ignored my shouts, some of them spat or bit at me. I tried my best to squeeze between the wooly bodies, but it seemed as if the paddock was much more full than it should be. There was barely enough room for them to stand, much less mill about. It was a wonder that I wasn't trampled in the night. After a particularly nasty llama spat a wad of green goo in my face, I retreated to safety. I was in such a rush, I didn't realize a llama body still laying on the dusty ground and tripped over it. With half of me sprawling over a llama, surrounded by llamas, being a llama, I had just about had it. I shouted at the top of my lungs in frustration, pounding the ground with my front hooves and kicking with my back. So what if I looked like a child having a tantrum. Saying I was having a bad day was an understatement. My primal screaming therapy was abruptly ended when the llama I was laying on groaned laboriously, and shoved me off in a very un-llama-like way. \"What is that?\" a scratchy, female voice moaned from the llama's mouth as she roughly felt my face and neck. She moved her long face closer to mine, studying me with sleepy, sluggish eyes. \"Is that a llama? Weird dream.\" I stayed on the ground as I watched a talking llama stand up on two feet (it's a lot weirder watching it happen that I thought it would) and crashed back to the ground. The llama looked around, only now noticing the many other llamas were around us. She scrambled back, breathing hard. \"What? Where am I? What's going on?\" she shrilled. My hazy memories recalled the girl that was working with Yzma, and how she was also turned into a llama. At that point in time, I was tempted to pretend to be one of the herd and escape without her. After all, I easily adjusted to my new situation and would move faster without her. And it would serve her right to live the rest of her life as a llama. Okay, so I wouldn't have let her remain as a llama forever. Maybe for a month or two. But then I remembered Kronk. He had been completely duped by Yzma as well, and he turned out to be a great guy. I wasn't sure where Yzma had picked this girl up, but she might not be completely guilty. My conscience forbade me from leaving her behind. Groaning miserably, I went to Llama Girl's side. \"Hey, are you okay?\" I asked. She looked relieved to hear my voice, turning her head around. Apparently she didn't see me, because her gaze went past me. \"Hello? Is someone there?\" she called anxiously. \"Hello. Hey, there,\" I said, waving a cloven hoof at her. \"Ahh! Talking llama,\" she shouted, scrambling away awkwardly. Boy, now I understand Pacha a little. \"Whoa, whoa. I'm not a llama. Don't be afraid,\" I placated her, trying to look non-threatening. Llama Girl still had a panicked expression, keeping as much distance as she could between herself and me in the crowded paddock. She pressed against a wall of llama bodies. \"What are you?\" she hissed. \"It's me, Emperor Kuzco. That potion that Yzma gave me turned me into a llama,\" I explained to her. Her countenance twisted into disgust and distrust, anger radiating off of her wooly self. \"It did? Well, serves you right,\" she spat at me. \"Who's Yzma?\" \"Who's Yzma?\" I repeated, astounded. \"The evil cat you were with.\" \"Who? Chasca?\" she said. I shrugged. \"Whatever you call her. That cat is Yzma, my old adviser.\" \"So, that's what happened to her,\" the Llama Girl cried out, pointing a hoof at me. \"You turned her into a cat, you monster.\" Technically, true. But she didn't have to call me a monster. \"Look, I don't know what Yzma has told you, but let me assure you, she's twisted the truth,\" I tried to persuade Llama Girl. \"When we get out of here, I'll explain everything.\" Llama Girl snorted. \"I think I can escape from a pen of pack animals quite easily, thank you very much. On the other hand, you might have a little difficulty,\" she told me haughtily, a sneaky smile on her llama lips. Her attitude was getting to me, so I couldn't help sneering, \"I think it'll be more difficult than you think. I'm not the only one who drank that potion.\" She glowered at me until my words sank in. Her eyes popped open and slowly rolled downward to gaze upon her fuzzy body. With a half sob/half gasp, she tried to cling to the wool on her body, as if it were a costume, but her hooves didn't have the dexterity to make the attempt even if it were possible. When she realized this, she thrust her hooves away from her as if to cast them off. Dang, I'm really good at narrative. I should be a writer. No, wait, I'm an Emperor. That's way better. Anyway, Llama Girl seemed to have an anxiety attack, complete with breathing deeply, shaking and holding back tears. Having been there (twice), I sympathized with the girl. I made my voice soothing and told her, \"Hey, it'll be okay. It's not that bad being a llama.\" \"Actually, I think I'm an alpaca,\" she sobbed with a frown. \"This can't be happening. Where is Chasca?\" Having heard that name before, I wondered how disillusioned this girl was with Yzma. Perhaps the girl was really simple-minded and more a victim than I initially thought. OW! Quillana! It's my chapter, I can say what I want. I'm telling! As the girl was yelling for Yzma, my llama ears picked up new sounds coming from outside the paddock. I stretched out my long neck, and could see two men coming toward the paddock. I recognized them from the night before. They were the two buffoons who knocked me out. As I recalled, they knew that I was a talking llama and so was the girl. Thinking quickly, I rushed to Llama Girl and pressed a hoof to her mouth, silencing her. She struggled until I hissed, \"Shhhh. The two men who captured us are coming.\" My words affected Llama Girl, since she became quiet. I could feel her body tense under my forearms. Crouching behind a llama that was still laying down and chewing on its cud, I sneaked a peak at the two men. The one called Zolin was stumbling after his friend, holding his head. Most likely, after his night of drinking, he had a nasty head ache. Good. \"Manco. Manco, wait up. I've had the weirdest dream,\" Zolin shouted as if his companion were hard of hearing. \"If it had anything to do with a talking llama, let me beat you to it,\" the one now called Manco spoke in a regular toned voice. \"It's all real.\" \"What? Nooooo,\" Zolin brushed it off. \"Quit messing with me.\" \"When do I ever mess with you?\" Manco retorted with folded arms. \"Trust me. We are going to make a lot of money on them.\" \"Who'd want a talking llama?\" Zolin snorted, still clutching his head. \"They're not that pleasant even when they can't speak.\" \"Oh, I'm sure they're both awful beasts, but the novelty of being the only person in the world to have a talking llama will sure to bring in some eccentric and wealthy buyers,\" Manco replied. \"Now, let's hurry up.\" \"What's the rush?\" \"That man from last night wanted to buy the pair. After a good night's rest, I'm sure I gave him too low of a number,\" Manco grumbled. \"If we can get on the road before he gets here, then we don't have to honor our agreement. Plus I want a good spot for the Merchant's March.\" Hearing this conversation, I wondered if the man they spoke of was Kronk. Or perhaps someone else out there knew that a couple of talking llamas were for sale. The two men left to talk to the owner of the paddock. Apparently they were only renting space within the paddock, along with a few other llama salesmen. It was no wonder the llamas were crammed in here. \"Come on. They'll be back soon,\" I whispered to Llama Girl, pulling her along. I attempted to make my way to the gate again, but was blocked once more by the spitting llamas. \"Stupid!\" I shouted at the creature. Llama Girl snapped out of her trance and pushed me away. \"You obviously don't know how to deal with animals. Move.\" With some tongue-clicking and persuasive talking, Llama Girl easily moved the animals out of the way with no more than a grunt from the ill-tempered beasts. \"There,\" she said with a satisfied smile. \"Even an idiot could do it.\" At that quip, I let loose one of my own. \"I guess dumb animals do know how to communicate with each other.\" Before Llama Girl could say anything more, I rushed to the gate to unlatch it. There was a rope tying it shut, which should have been very easy to undo. That is, if I had fingers. After pulling and prodding at the knot with my hooves for a while, I gave a frustrated yell. \"Maybe you should throw that knot out the window. That seems like the way to solve problems,\" Llama Girl sneered. \"Not helping!\" I shouted at her, trying my teeth against the knot. That only hurt my mouth and coated my tongue with the taste of rope. Nasty. \"Get down,\" Llama Girl ordered, roughly pulling me down to the ground. \"Who are they? Don't they know you're the emperor?\" \"Sorry, I forgot to tell them that before they knocked me unconscious,\" I said sarcastically. \"They may be ready to accept talking llamas, but I doubt they'll believe I'm Kuzco.\" \"Good point. I had a hard time believing the emperor was an idiot when I first met you,\" Llama Girl spat back, scrambling deeper in the herd. I rolled my eyes. \"Why are you hiding? You're a llama in a herd of llamas. Act like one,\" I hissed at her, settling myself on all four hooves and holding my head high. \"I'm an alpaca,\" Llama Girl hissed, clumsily mimicking me. It's a lot weirder than it looks. We all have this idea that walking like a llama or any other animal is like crawling on our hands and knees. No, it's more like walking on your toes and fingertips with your legs shorter than they used to be. It's very bizarre. \"Our animals are the ones with a 'ZM' on the tag,\" Manco called out as the owner of the paddock moved into the herd. As Llama Girl and I tried to push our way into the middle of the herd, we watched as the man moved through the paddock, checking each tag and throwing ropes around the necks of the animals with the right tags. As each one was led out of the paddock, Manco would check each off on his list. Zolin would then take the animals, put halters on them, and tie them up in a line behind a cart. Inside the cart was some boxes, several bales of hay and a few young llamas laying contentedly. With more room to move around, I pushed to the back of the pack, keeping away from the man. I looked around frantically, hoping to find a way out before they could find us. \"That's all of them,\" the paddock owner said, pulling out a fifteenth llama from the group. \"All of them accounted for.\" \"Not quite,\" Manco told the owner politely. \"Last night, we acquired two more animals. It was quite late, so we put them in ourselves.\" The owner looked peeved. \"I'll be charging for those two, then,\" he growled, holding out his hand. \"Of course,\" Manco agreed readily, putting a couple of coins in the man's large hands. \"The first is a scrawny black and brown llama. The other is that gray alpaca.\" The animal salesman pointed us out in the crowd. \"They don't have tags yet.\" \"No tags?\" the owner growled, looking suspicious. Before the owner could accuse him of anything, Manco produced two tablets. \"I understand that this is a bit of an inconvenience, but we didn't have time to tag them. However, here are the bills of sale for the two of them, as proof they are ours.\" The owner looked over the bills of sale (no doubt forgeries), before he went back into the paddock. He found me first, grabbing my neck and roughly placing the rope over my head. I struggled, doing everything I could to prevent them from taking me. I kicked, bit, stepped on toes and anything else I could think of. \"This one's a wild one. Scrawny but strong,\" the man noted as my face was shoved into a halter. \"Oh, I'm sure we can break him quickly enough,\" Manco said confidently, giving me a knowing look. \"Zolin, tie him down in the back of the cart. Not only was my halter tied tightly against one of the cart posts, but my feet were also hobbled for good measure. I snorted in disgust as it looked like my escape plans were impeded for now. From my prison, I watched as Llama Girl was captured. I was looking forward to her own futile struggle, sure she wouldn't do any better than I had. However, I was disappointed as she allowed the man to capture her very easily and demurely followed him out of the paddock. She even rubbed her head against his arm as if begging for a treat or a scratch. \"This one sure is a sweetie,\" another man observed, giving her neck a good pat. \"Much better than that other one. You won't have trouble selling her.\" I could almost see the smug look on Llama Girl's face. What did she think this was, a popularity contest? This isn't 4-H, honey. It wasn't until I saw the look on Manco and Zolin's faces that I realized what she was doing. The two looked as if they weren't sure about her. Oh, she is clever, I begrudgingly thought. She was a good actress. When she came to the cart, she balked at climbing in, much like an animal would, making snorting and distressed noises. In the end, she jolted up into the cart, prancing around before settling down. I couldn't help noticing she wasn't tied up so tightly in the cart. She had plenty of rope to even lay down, which she did. The young llamas only gave us a glance before they continued to chew their cud, happy to be ignored. \"Can you get free?\" I whispered when we were alone. \"You look like you could easily get free.\" She acted as if she didn't hear me, carefully watching the men. She waited until they were farther away before replying. \"Not now. If we escape now, then they'll chase us down. Those men are expert llama wranglers. Do you think you can get away from all of them?\" She had a good point, so I quieted down. It wasn't long before Zolin and Manco secured their cart and started off, four llamas pulling the cart while the others followed. Zolin stayed at the front, keeping the llamas pulling while Manco stayed close to the rear to watch the rest of the herd. He kept giving me sly glances, as if to remind me that he knew my secret. Their pace was slow and steady, a little rocky. The swaying of the cart made me a little nauseous, and I wished I could lay down like Llama Girl. After a while, we halted. I could see a little in front of us and spied a large group of carts blocking the road. There was a man at the front shouting about how the Merchant's March would begin in an hour. I shifted my feet as best I could as I grumbled. I didn't want to stay in the cart for another hour, but Llama Girl didn't look as if she were ready to make her escape. As I watched the crowd move around us, I spotted a familiar face. It was hard to miss the large form of Pacha with the same green hat and poncho that he always wore. I pulled as hard as I could on my rope so I could get a better look at him. As loud as I could, I shouted, \"Pacha! Help! Please help!\" I kept shouting until a hand clamped over my muzzle, preventing from yelling or even breathing. \"That's enough of that,\" Manco told me as he used some extra rope to tie my mouth shut. \"Although it was nice of you to say something to confirm that I wasn't dreaming last night.\" I glowered at the man, wishing I could spit at him. \"You two will make me very rich, so please don't hesitate to ask if there is anything I can do to make your journey more comfortable,\" he chuckled at his own joke. He glanced at Llama Girl, who was nuzzling the straw as if looking for treats. She then started chewing on the wooden cage around the cart. Manco gave her a dubious look before shaking a finger at me and leaving. I grumbled at my even more uncomfortable circumstances and kicked at the boxes in the cart as best I could with my hobbled legs. One box let out a growl and a hiss. \"I'll get that fool, one way or another,\" the box growled in a familiar tone. It was also familiar to Llama Girl, because her ears lifted up, alert. Slowly moving to the box, she put her face close to the box, calling out softly. \"Chasca?\"[Chapter 10] Don't Touch My Llama Chapter 10: The Faithful and the Divine By: Emilou aka Hatashi Kitty One of the strangest things about being an alpaca is how long your neck is. Having your head so far from your body takes some time getting used to. However, there are some benefits to having an oddly proportioned body, as I soon found out. After hearing a familiar voice hiss, \"I'll get that fool, one way or another,\" I maneuvered my head next to the box without getting up from my place in the hay. \"Chasca?\" I asked, peering inside the wicker box, seeing two angry, glowing eyes within the darkness. A pinkish-gray form moved forward. I was right; it was Chasca. She put her paws on the bars of her makeshift cat-carrier. \"Quillana?\" she asked, looking me up and down. \"Yes, it's me,\" I said almost in tears. It was a relief to hear my name, even in this wretched body. I had an ally in this horrible predicament. With the animal-patron of my village aiding me, I would escape and perhaps find a way to become human again. \"What happened to you?\" the cat asked, sounding irritated. \"Oh, honorable Chasca. This lowly one doesn't know,\" I said, returning to the formal speech one uses when in the presence of greatness. \"This one only remembers helping you deal justice to the emperor, then something hit this one. When this one woke up, she was an alpaca.\" \"An alpaca? But the potion was for a llama,\" Chasca hissed. \"It must be past its expiration date.\" I was a little confused. \"This one doesn't understand,\" I told Chasca, hoping for an explanation. \"Never mind. Get me out of here,\" Chasca growled, rattling the bars of her cage. I set about unlatching the cage, which would have been simple if I still had fingers. Yet with only cloven hooves and my mouth, I attacked the door with no luck. \"This one is sorry,\" I apologized humbly as I kowtowed to the wicker cage. \"This one cannot free the honorable Chasca.\" \"Idiot!\" she hissed at me, a claw reaching out and scratching my nose. The attack came so unexpectedly that I squealed, leaping to my feet. At the ruckus, the man named Manco returned to the cart. \"What is going on?\" he grumbled, going to Kuzco. He pulled on the Emperor's muzzle, glaring at the llama. \"Are you causing trouble?\" Kuzco muttered an insult, but it remained unintelligent with his mouth tied shut. Manco scans the cart suspiciously, his gaze lingering on me for a moment. Knowing the man is waiting for me to speak, I move my head over to him, grunting and snorting as if I expect him to feed me. I even go so far as to nibble on his shirt, trying not to gag on his horrible body odor. Manco pushes my head away, looking skeptical. He then checks the rest of the cart, including double checking Kuzco's and mine restraints. He nods his head, pleased with how everything looks. Before leaving, he points at Kuzco as if to tell the emperor that he'll be watching the llama very carefully. Once the man is gone, I lay back down to talk to Chasca again. I keep my distance since my nose was still stinging, a reminder that an angry deity will strike out at the nearest mortal. \"This one is sorry she has failed you, Chasca. Please give this one more time. Perhaps this one could chew through the bars,\" I appealed to the cat deity. Still irritated, Chasca answered tetchily, \"Hurry up.\" As I try gnawing at the wooden bars (which is very difficult for the single purpose that alpacas do not have a top row of teeth, only a bottom, and may I add, is very weird to experience), I heard Kuzco muttering something like, \"Don't make me sick?\" \"Who's that?\" Chasca whispered, peering around her wicker cage. \"Is that man coming back?\" I spat out a splinter of wood I had jarred loose. \"It's the Emperor Kuzco in llama form. We both were captured by two men. They know Kuzco can talk and plan on selling him to the highest bidder,\" I said, sounding smug. \"But this one may have fooled the men into thinking she's just a regular alpaca.\" Chasca cackled. \"A fitting end for you, Emperor Kuzco.\" Kuzco kicked her box, causing Chasca to growl. I glared at the llama. \"Stop that. Don't you know who this is?\" I hissed. \"She's Chasca, descended from the heavens in animal form. Show her some respect.\" \"Yeah, show me some respect, llama,\" Chasca sneered. Kuzco mumbled through his muzzle, \"Are you crazy?\" He also said a name, \"Yzma\" I think it was. I remembered he used that same name the night before. \"Don't listen to him, Quillana. Kuzco must have been the one who turned you into an alpaca last night,\" Chasca said, which caught my attention. \"Free me, then I can free you. We'll escape together and leave the emperor to the fate that he deserves. Then we can find a way to turn us back into humans.\" Many things that Chasca said should have warned me that I was being tricked. The first of which was his current situation. Kuzco may have been a jerk, but I didn't think he deserved to remain a llama and be sold. Revealing his true nature to his friends should have been enough. Second, I was skeptical that Kuzco had the ability to turn me into an alpaca. It made no sense, especially since he had been turned into a llama by Chasca. At this point, I should have realized that Chasca was lying to me. The third warning that I missed was: Why did Chasca need to be turned back into a human? As a deity, she had the power to change her shape at will. I really have no excuse as to why I didn't catch Chasca in these lies. I was naïve. I wanted to believe the lies. I wanted to believe that it was Kuzco who changed me into an alpaca. I wanted to be in the right so badly that I ignored my conscience, ignored my logical reasoning and continued to help who I thought was a cat deity. I was still chewing on the first wooden bar when a voice shouted from a distance, proclaiming the Merchant's March was to start. Soon after that, Manco and Zolin appeared and led their train of pack animals through the city. \"What's going on?\" Chasca whispered. I paused in my work to explain about the situation. Curious as to how Chasca happened to be in the same dilemma, I cautiously asked. Chasca only growled and sank to the back of her box. With Manco and Zolin nearby, I wasn't able to chew on Chasca's cage so not to be discovered. Besides, the jerky motion of the cart caused me to feel sick, especially with my fur and the sun making me hot and having no water to drink all day. I noticed Kuzco also felt sick when he started moaning and looking green. I felt bad for the emperor and wished that Manco would do something to make him more comfortable. At least I was able to lay down, but Kuzco was forced to remain standing. As we traveled, I recognized the path that the Merchant's March was traveling along. It would eventually lead to my village if they stayed on the main road. I had many fond memories of the Merchant's March stopping in my village in years passed. It was like a holiday and a carnival wrapped up in one. It was a chance to buy things that were normally unavailable unless one traveled to the capital (which, for my village, was nearly impossible since a majority of the citizens were elderly). Many in my village also sold or bartered away items they didn't need anymore. My father always gave me some copper coins to buy sweets, books or carved toys. But before they would arrive at my village, they would make several stops to other villages. I hoped that I would escape before then. I think I would die of shame if everyone in my village and my family found out that I'd been turned into a llama. Even though I had a good two weeks before then, tears still came to my eyes at the thought of the embarrassment. \"Quillana, the men are gone. Now is the time,\" Chasca hissed, jerking me out of my thoughts. I looked around, realizing that the caravan had stopped by a river. It was mid-day, and everyone was taking the time to eat a short meal and water their animals. Zolin and Manco were not in sight. I attacked the wooden bars again, grinding my teeth against the wood as hard as I could. I chewed until my mouth hurt. After a while, I felt the wood give way, snapping in two. Although it was only one bar, it created a gap big enough for Chasca to escape. The fluffy form of Chasca squeezed out of the cage. She stretched and licked herself a couple of times to fix her ruffled fur. Now that my animal-patron was free, I beamed, hoping for some praise from the divine creature. But I received none. \"This one is glad to be of service,\" I told Chasca humbly. I was anxious to be free myself, so I nudge Chasca with my words. \"If it pleases Chasca, would thee free this one.\" Chasca sat with her tail curled around her paws, appraising me with the judgmental eyes of a cat. \"I can't possibly untie that know with my claws. It's impossible. Do it yourself,\" she said with a swish of her tail before jumping out of the cart and scampering away. \"No! Chasca, wait. Please, don't abandon me,\" I called out, straining against the bridal around my face. No sooner had I shouted than something pulled against my lead roughly, turning my head. I found myself face-to-face with Manco who had a triumphant look on his face. \"You thought you could fool me, but I knew all along,\" Manco gloated, his hot, smelly breath causing me to cough. \"I knew if I waited long enough, you'd talk.\" I strained to turn my head to look for Chasca, hoping that she had changed her mind. This must be another test, so see if I would remain devoted to her. After all my faithful work, she wouldn't leave me to the same fate as Kuzco, would she? But deep in my heart I knew I was alone. And with my charade discovered, any chance for me to escape had just went down to zero. ","Summary":" (Author's note: This story is being revised. Nothing major, just some cosmetic editing.

Cherry and Mo came over to help Atticus watch over Darla as Patrick and Emily had gone out for the night. Darla was supposed to be asleep, but the storm woke her up and she came down to see her big brother and his friends. \"Man, it sure is raining cats and dogs out there.\" Atticus said. \"Not my favorite expression.\" Mo commented. Cherry rolled her eyes, then looked over. \"Dimples? Is the storm bothering you?\" \"Uh-huh...\" Darla pouted as she hugged her teddy bear. Patch soon came in the house before shaking his fur dry. Cherry groaned and then glared. \"Hey, Patch.\" Atticus put a blanket over his puppy. \"Thanks, Atticus.\" Patch muffled with a smile. Atticus smiled. \"Where did you go again?\" Cherry asked as her glasses dripped. \"I had to go and help a puppy get to his human.\" Patch said. \"Good boy.\" Atticus smiled. Darla sighed as she sat on the couch. \"What's wrong, Darla?\" Patch asked. \"I can't sleep.\" Darla pouted. \"The storm bothering ya?\" Patch asked. \"Yeah...\" Darla pouted and nodded. \"At least the power's not out.\" Cherry said. The storm got worse and worse and then the power cut out. \"Great.\" Cherry groaned. \"Way to go, Cherry.\" Mo scoffed. \"I didn't do anything!\" Cherry defended as she then took out her phone and turned on the flashlight app and handed it to Atticus. \"Go fix the breaker box, boy.\" \"Alright.\" Atticus said. Cherry tossed him her phone. Atticus caught it and then went to the door, but looked out the window as it was thunder and lightninging outside. \"Uh, Cherry, that storm looks pretty bad...\" he bit his lip nervously. \"So?\" Cherry replied. \"Just a bit concerned of how bad it might get.\" Atticus said. \"Atticus, are you afraid of storms?\" Patch asked. Atticus sighed and then nodded. \"Yes...\" \"Still?\" Cherry deadpanned. \"Yes.\" Atticus nodded. \"Oh, brother...\" Cherry rolled her eyes. \"Storms aren't that bad.\" There was then a loud thunder clap and a small yelp heard. Mo lit a candle and then shone it on Cherry as she was latched onto the ceiling like a scaredy cat. \"Th-Th-That was loud...\" Cherry shivered nervously. \"Now you can understand why I have a fear with thunderstorms.\" Atticus shivered. \"Well, we might as well wait for the power to come back on.\" Mo said. \"But I still can't sleep...\" Darla frowned. \"If only we could get away from the storm and distract Darla at the same time.\" Patch pondered. \"Yeah, but how?\" Atticus asked. \"Maybe we could go somewhere like when we went with Cherry to meet Pocahontas?\" Patch suggested. \"That was a crazy accident, I doubt that'll happen again.\" Cherry replied. \"You never know.\" Mo said. \"You guys met Pocahontas?\" Darla asked Cherry, Atticus, and Patch. \"Yep.\" Atticus nodded. Darla smiled until the thunder clapped again. The candle's light then went out. \"Aw, come on!\" Mo groaned. Cherry stood up and tried to feel around the house, she blinked a few times and she could now see in the dark. \"Alright, everyone, follow me, I'll find a way to give us some light.\" she then said. \"Alright, then lead the way.\" Atticus said. Cherry walked around and came to the backyard. The storm seemed to be clearing up slightly. However, they were suddenly behind bushes and they somehow ended up in a jungle far, far away and not just from home, but also in the time period. \"Where are we?\" Mo asked. \"This can't be the backyard...\" Cherry firmly pouted. \"Cherry, where have you led us to?\" Atticus scolded. \"I don't think she led us here on purpose.\" Patch said. There was a big lightning strike which made what look like a llama gasp and then pout at the rain before crying. \"You okay?\" Patch asked. The llama looked over to them. \"You can talk?\" he then asked. \"Uh, yeah, you can too?\" Patch replied like it was obvious. \"Okay, this is gonna sound crazy, but I'm not really a llama...\" the llama told them with a sigh. \"It's a long, sad, story... I was the nicest guy in the world and they were mean to me for no reason!\" \"Mind telling us?\" Darla asked. \"You could start with your name.\" Atticus added. \"The name is Kuzco...\" the llama sighed. \" Emperor Kuzco.\" \"Did anyone evil turn you into a llama?\" Atticus asked. \"I guess we should go back to the beginning...\" Kuzco replied. Suddenly, the others were shown a baby boy with a crown on his head. \"No, see, that's too far, you gotta-Oh, look at me!\" Kuzco cooed. \"That's me as a baby!\" \"Aw! You looked so cute!\" Darla awed. The baby boy hugged a toy, but hugged it too hard that the toy's head ripped off which made the baby cry until servants handed numerous replacements. \"Mind if you skip to the actual beginning?\" Cherry asked Kuzco. \"Ahem!\" Kuzco then cleared his throat. Somehow, it was morning and the sun was out. Cherry, Atticus, Patch, and Darla wore peasant clothes and sandals. \"I so do not look great in this color.\" Darla said. \"You really don't...\" Mo said. \"What happened to our clothes?\" \"I guess we're supposed to be here...\" Patch sighed as he didn't change much. \"I wonder where Kuzco is now?\" \"I guess he's in the palace.\" Cherry shrugged. They soon got their answer as two doors opened behind them. \"Whoa!\" the group jumped back and looked to the doors that suddenly opened and where they saw someone coming out from the doors. Patch stood behind Atticus just in case it would be dangerous. Luckily, it wasn't anything dangerous. \"Oh, yeah...\" an older teenage boy was at the door with long black hair with blue earrings, a red outfit with black sandals, and a golden sun crown. \"Emperor Kuzco.\" the group recognized. \"So, this is what he looks like.\" Atticus said. Kuzco glanced at his company. \"Do I know you all?\" Drell soon placed fake memories of him thinking each of them had jobs at the palace and where Atticus's job was body guard and Patch's was guard dog and Mo's job was maid and Darla's job was junior maid and Cherry's was his foot rest. The others stammered slightly. \"Oh, wait, now I remember,\" Kuzco stopped them. \"You thought you could get away with this? I believe you all have work to do for me.\" \"Um, right!\" Mo grinned nervously. \"Reporting for duty, Emperor Kuzco.\" \"Yep, we are here to work for you, Your Highness.\" Darla said. \"Well, don't just stand there, let's get started for another day, shall we?\" Kuzco smirked. \"We still got time before I have to meet my summoned peasant.\" \"Summoned peasant, sir?\" Darla asked. \"Yeah, I wanna talk to him about where he lives.\" Kuzco nodded. \"That seems nice of you, Your Highness.\" Darla said. \"Yeah, yeah, let's get to work,\" Kuzco told them while impatiently clapping for them to get to work. \"Chop-Chop, people.\" \"Yes, Your Highness.\" Atticus and the others said. \"Maids?\" Darla and Mo sighed as they got in place. \"At least we're bodyguards.\" Atticus shrugged to Patch. \"I'm a FOOTSTOOL?!\" Cherry snapped. Drell soon laughed quietly. \"I'm gonna drown him...\" Cherry growled under her breath. Atticus and Patch followed Kuzco as he walked down a path. Darla threw down rose petals as Kuzco walked in to decorate his arrival down the red carpet that was placed down for him. 'At least there's no theme song.' Darla thought to herself. \"Butler,\" Kuzco smirked as he sat at his throne while his feet were on top of Cherry. \"Chef... Theme song guy.\" \"Wait, what?\" Darla asked. There was a tall cake and a singer came out of it and sang all about Kuzco. \"Oh, you have got to be kidding me.\" Darla groaned. Kuzco smiled smugly as he enjoyed the song a little too much while it seemed to annoy everyone else. \"Atticus, no offense, but this guy seems... Uh... Full of himself.\" Patch spoke up. \"I agree with you there, Patch.\" Atticus said. A red ribbon was given to Kuzco and he cut them lazily with a large pair of scissors and there were three newborn babies given to Kuzco and he took out a stamp and planted it on their foreheads to show kiss marks. He then lazily tossed a bottle to a ship which then sailed away in his honor. He then wiped his forehead until someone fanned him and he was given water and had to spit it into a bucket, but he missed and splashed the servant, but the servant didn't dare to complain. \"This guy is really full of himself.\" Mo whispered. \"Man, I hate selfish people.\" Darla pouted. Cherry snickered at that since Darla was just like that before she became a Fudo. \"I get it, I used to be selfish too.\" Darla groaned. \"Yes, you were...\" Cherry remembered. \"I don't like to be reminded of it...\" Darla replied. \"Alright, Cherry, I think you should stop mentioning it.\" Mo said. Cherry muttered and rolled her eyes. Kuzco had fun being the center of attention, until he did a moonwalk and bumped into an old man and then complained. \"NO! You threw off my groove!\" he glared at the old man before turning away and folding his arms. \"I'm sorry, but you have thrown off the emperor's groove.\" a guard told the old man before throwing him out of the palace. \"Sorry!\" The old man yelled. Kuzco glared before looking down to his singer. \"You were saying?\" \"What's his name?\" the singer asked as he brought the song back up. \"Kuzco!\" the chorus jeered. \"I am just about to lose it.\" Patch groaned. \"Okay, if it helps, he's worse than you were.\" Cherry said to Darla. \"Thanks, I guess...\" Darla rolled her eyes. After the song ended, Kuzco kicked a door open. \"HA! Boom, baby!\" Atticus and the others soon other young women in the room. \"Oh, Your Highness, it's time for you to pick your bride...\" a man in the room said, rather nervously. \"All right, trod out the ladies,\" Kuzco smirked. \"Let's have a look-see...\" he then examined each of the girls one-by-one. Hate your hair, not likely, yikes, yikes yikes, and let me guess, you have a great personality,\" he then glared at the man. \"Is this really the best you can do?\" \"Wow, he sure is judgy with choosing a bride.\" Patch whispered. The man stammered of Kuzco's disapproval and tried to excuse himself while Kuzco looked annoyed of him babbling. \"Uh, Your Highness, we should probably get to your throne room.\" Atticus spoke up. \"Oh, you're right and besides, I have a feeling Yzma is trying to do my job again.\" Kuzco said. \"Yzma?\" The others asked. \"Yeah, my adviser and where luckily one of you just might become my new adviser after firing her.\" Kuzco said as they made their way to the throne room. Atticus and Patch smiled to each other. \"Come along, you can all have a break, you seem cooler than the other servants,\" Kuzco said, his lackadaisical teenager side coming out. \"Anyway, Yzma's basically living proof that dinosaurs once roamed the Earth, and let's not forget Yzma's right-hand man, every decade or so, she gets a new one, this year's model is called 'Kronk'.\" \"I don't pay much attention, but it's just her thing...\" Kuzco shrugged. \"She's been here for as long as I can remember ever since my parents left me in charge in case they didn't make it back home from their voyage out to sea.\" \"How long have they been gone?\" Darla asked. Kuzco paused to think about it, but then frowned slightly. \"Sometime after I was born.\" This caused the others to gasp as that must have felt horrible. \"Don't tell me, at some point, you're gonna find out about Kuzco's parents.\" Cherry said to Atticus. \"I might have to.\" Atticus replied. They came into the throne room where a cowardly older man was talking with an older woman who was next to a buff young man who looked more like a gentle giant than a mean bully and where he didn't seem not that smart. Yzma waved at a bug that was buzzing around her face. \"Yeah, I got that there, Yzma...\" Kronk said as he tried to get the fly, it landed on his forehead and he smacked himself on the forehead, missing the fly, and making him fall back on the floor. \"Yep, that's Kronk...\" Kuzco sighed and shook his head. \"Now, lately, Yzma's gotten this bad habit of trying to run the country behind my back, and I'm thinkin', that's gotta stop.\" \"So, you're gonna fire her, right?\" Atticus asked. \"Oh, you betcha.\" Kuzco nodded. The villager was trying to tell Yzma his concerns, but she didn't seem to care. \"It is no concern of mine whether your family has-\" Yzma glared down the villager. \"What was it again?\" \"Uh, food?\" the villager replied. \"HA!\" Yzma mocked. \"You really should have thought of that before you became peasants! We're through here. Take him away. Next!\" \"Shouldn't you stop her from sending that man away?\" Darla asked Kuzco. \"I'll worry about it.\" Kuzco replied. \"Ugh...\" Yzma groaned as she rubbed her head. \"The nerve of some of those peasants, huh?\" Kuzco asked quietly. \"Tell me about it...\" Yzma replied until she screamed out and saw him right behind her. \"YAUGH!\" \"Hello.\" Cherry smirked. \"Ooh, Your Highness...\" Yzma smiled nervously to Kuzco. \"Ahem.\" Kuzco pointed to his throne. Yzma smiled nervously as she dusted the seat to get 'her germs' off of it. \"Uh, you were doing it again.\" Kuzco told Yzma. Yzma was soon stumbling her words, acting like she didn't know what he was talking about. Kuzco scolded her until he found himself zoning out and even noticed that Yzma had a piece of broccoli in her teeth. \"Good thinking, Yzma, what do you say, Kuzco?\" Kronk smiled before tapping the young emperor gently. \"WHOA! No touchy!\" Kuzco got defensive. \"No touchy!... No touch!\" \"He really doesn't like being touched.\" Patch whispered. \"Cherry's like that too.\" Atticus whispered back. \"Uh, excuse me, your Highness,\" a guy walked in. \"The village leader is here to see you. \" \"Oh, great, send him in!\" Kuzco replied before glancing to Yzma. \"By the way, you're fired.\" \"Fired?! W-W-What do you mean fired?\" Yzma asked out of shock. \"Uh, how else can I say it?\" Kuzco replied before getting a servant to fill out a pink slip to give to Yzma. \"You're being let go, your department's being downsized, you're part of an outplacement, we're going in a different direction, we're not picking up your option. Take your pick. I've got more!\" Yzma took the slip and stumbled over her words again and fell into the throne. \"But I-you - uh-but your Highness, I have been nothing if not loyal to the empire f-f-for many, many years...\" \"Hey, hey, everybody hits their stride, you just hit yours 50 years ago,\" Kuzo replied before smirking. \"So, who's in my chair?~\" \"Ooh, I know, I know!\" Kronk raised his hand. \"Yzma's in your chair, right?\" \"Wow, he is not smart.\" Patch whispered. \"Very good, Kronk!\" Kuzco cooed before taking out a cracker. \"Here, get the snack!\" he then pretended to throw it. \"Got it!\" Kronk jumped like a dog for a treat before falling off the throne and crashed on the floor. \"I'm okay!\" \"Okay, you heard the man!\" Kuzco shooed Yzma away. \"Up, up, up!\" Yzma soon got off the throne before walking away grumbling. \"Arent' you worried she might try something later?\" Cherry asked. \"Ah, what could she do?\" Kuzco scoffed before sitting down into his throne. \"Ah... Atticus, congratulations, you'll be my new adviser.\" \"Thank you, Your Highness.\" Atticus said with a bow. Patch also bowed as he couldn't help but did what his master did.[Chapter 2] \"Okay, I'm ready, show him in!\" Kuzco told the guy about the village leader coming in to see him and where soon, a man came in. \"I'm an adviser.\" Atticus smiled proudly to himself. \"Hooray for you.\" Cherry deadpanned. \"Shh! I'm trying to listen.\" Darla whispered. \"Uh, afternoon, Your Highness,\" the village leader came in. \"I'm here because I received a summons-\" \"Hey, there he is! My main village man!\" Kuzco cheered. \"Uh, Pacha,\" the man replied. \"Anyway, I got this summons-\" \"Pacha, that's right, you are just the man I wanted to see!\" Kuzco smiled. \"I am?\" Pacha asked. \"Word on the street is you can fix my problem,\" Kuzo replied before sliding down to come to the village man. \"You can fix my problem, can't you?\" Cherry bit her nails and when Atticus saw this, he decided to teleport himself and the others down on the ground floor with the emperor. \"Sure, I'll do what I can.\" Pacha shrugged. \"Good, good, that's just what I wanted to hear,\" Kuzco replied. \"Are you aware of just how important your village is to the empire?\" \"Well, I know we grow the crops that you use here at the palace. We also herd the llamas that you-\" Pacha continued until Kuzco lifted a sheet to show a model of the village. \"...My village?\" \"This is interesting.\" Patch whispered, feeling uncomfortable. \"Oh, yeah,\" Kuzco chuckled. \"You've got a pretty sweet little set-up up there on top of that hill, don't ya?\" \"Yup, my family has lived on that hilltop for the last six generations.\" Pacha smiled proudly. \"Wow.\" Mo smiled. \"You must be so proud, sir.\" Darla added. \"Indeed I am.\" Pacha smiled back. \"Uh-huh...\" Kuzco shrugged. \"So, uh, tell me... Where do you find you get the most sun?\" \"Oh, I'd say just on the other side of those trees,\" Pacha pointed out. \"When the sun hits that ridge just right, these hills sing.\" \"That sounds magical.\" Darla smiled. \"Well, that settles it.\" Kuzco said. \"Really?\" Pacha asked. \"Yep, problem solved, thanks for coming.\" Kuzco nodded. \"You just wanted to know which side gets the most sun?\" Atticus asked, confused. \"I just needed an insider's opinion before I okayed this spot for my pool.\" Kuzco replied. \"Your pool?\" Pacha and the others asked. \"BOOYAH!\" Kuzco slammed a new model on top of the village model. \"Welcome to Kuzcotopia, my ultimate summer getaway! Complete with waterslide!\" \"But then, what about Pacha and the other villagers that live on the hill?\" Darla asked. \"They can pick up changes of address forms,\" Kuzco shrugged. \"But isn't this great? It's my birthday gift to me! I'm so happy...\" 'This guy is now acting more like selfish.' Atticus thought to himself. \"I don't understand how this could happen.\" Pacha felt devastated. \"Well, let me clear it up for you. At my birthday celebration tomorrow, I give the word, and your town will be destroyed to make way for this!\" Kuzco explained. \"So if I were you, I'd pick up some change of address forms on the way home.\" \"So, you don't care where they live?\" Atticus asked. \"Not really,\" Kuzco replied with a modest shrug. \"How's that?\" \"Wait, you can't-\" Pacha tried to go after him, but was blocked by other guards. \"When I give the word, your little town thingy will be bye-bye,\" Kuzco whispered to him before waving so the guards would take Pacha away. \"Bye-bye! Boo-hoo.\" 'This guy is so asking for a bite in the butt.' Patch thought to himself. Kuzco smirked as things were going his way now, he then patted Atticus on the head. Atticus was beginning to hate Kuzco. \"Where's the Bubonic Plague when you need it?\" Cherry narrowed her eyes about how much of a jerk Kuzco was. \"How do you think Yzma is doing?\" Darla whispered. \"Probably not well.\" Cherry whispered back. Darla soon snuck off without anyone knowing her missing and where she followed Yzma. Kuzco then left to have a normal day so far. Darla put on her cloak and sunglasses as she stealthed around to follow after Yzma. Yzma was shown to be smashing head busts of Kuzco out of rage and anger. \"Yep, she's not taking it well.\" Darla whispered. \"He can't get rid of me that easily! Who does that ungrateful little worm think he is? Does he-a little to the left-\" Yzma ranted before smashing more busts. \"Have any idea of who he's dealing with? How could he do this to me? Why, I practically raised him!\" \"Yeah, you think he would've turned out better.\" Kronk replied. \"Yeah, go figure.\" Yzma said before seeing Darla and tossed the mallet for Kronk to catch as she went over to the little girl. Darla gasped and then tried to stay hidden in the background. \"Yeah, it's too bad you can't just get rid of the real Kuzco, huh?\" Kronk asked just as Yzma grabbed Darla. \"YIPE!\" Darla yelped. Yzma gasped once she had an idea of that. \"That's it, Kronk, that's it! I'll get rid of Kuzco.\" \"The real Kuzco?\" Kronk asked dumbly. \"Of course the real Kuzco, and I have a new accomplice.\" Yzma replied as she took a firm hold on Darla. \"Let me go! Let me go!\" Darla yelled before recalling of what Yzma said about getting rid of Kuzco. \"Can I help?\" \"You want to help?\" Yzma scoffed. \"But you are a mere child.\" Darla soon smirked once she showed Yzma the Silver Crystal who gasped once she saw it. \"What was that...?\" Yzma asked. \"The Silver Crystal,\" Darla smiled innocently. \"Then again, what would I know?\" she then put her voice up high in a mocking tone. \"I'm just a widdle chiwd.\" \"Hmm... You may be of use after all.\" Yzma said. Darla smiled innocently. \"Are you sure, Yzma?\" Kronk asked. \"I mean, she is a little girl...\" \" SILENCE! \" Yzma snapped before smiling to Darla. \"You can call me 'Auntie Yzma' if you want~...\" \"So, how are we going to get rid of that selfish emperor, Auntie Yzma?\" Darla smiled. \"Yeah, how's that gonna work with you being fired and all?\" Kronk asked the evil woman. \"The only ones who know about that are the four of us, soon to be the three of us.\" Yzma replied. \"And I'm one of those three, right?\" Kronk asked. \"To the secret lab!\" Yzma called out. \"Ooh.\" Darla smiled. Yzma and Kronk led Darla over to a pair of levers. \"Pull the lever, Kronk!\" Yzma demanded. Kronk then pulled a lever which made a trapdoor open up and Yzma fell into it. \" WRONG LEVERRR! \" Yzma cried out before splashing. \"I'm guessing the lever to get us to the secret lab is the other one.\" Darla said. \"Why do I even have that lever?\" Yzma growled before slapping away the crocodile. Kronk pulled the other lever and they were suddenly in a roller-coaster cart. 'Please remain seated and keep your arms and legs in at all times. ' an announcer told them. \"Ooh, a ride.\" Darla smiled. The ride then went downhill and went all around. Kronk laughed and hollered as he put his hands up as he had the most fun on this. \"Faster, faster!\" \"Whee!\" Darla giggled. \"Yzma, put your hands up!\" Kronk hollered. Soon enough, the car stopped and they all landed in the secret lab, wearing white smocks, black goggles, and gloves. \"Ooh.\" Darla smiled. \"Ah, how shall I do it?\" Yzma smirked as she tried to come up with an idea. \"Oh, I know. I'll turn him into a flea. A harmless little flea. And then I'll put that flea in a box, and I'll put that box inside another box, and then I'll mail that box to myself, and when it arrives, I'll smash it with a hammer!\" she then laughed wickedly. \"That might be a bit evil, but at least he'll be gone,\" Darla said. She then picked up a bottle curiously before it felt heavy and she then accidentally tripped it poured it onto a plant which then killed it instantly. \"Oops...\" \"Or, to save on postage, I'll just poison him with this!\" Yzma then suggested as she took a new bottle of the potion. \"Take it, Kronk, feel the power.\" \"Oh, I can feel it.\" Kronk took the bottle. \"Excellent, so how will he drink it without knowing it's poison?\" Darla asked. 'You saw what happened to that plant.\" Yzma replied. \"But what if this is something else?\" Darla asked. \"Better look at the label then,\" Yzma took the bottle from Kronk to see a skull. \"It's poison.\" \"So then, we'll let the poison be like a drink during dinner?\" Darla asked. \"Precisely, my child,\" Yzma replied. \"Our moment of triumph approaches! It's DINNERTIME! \" Thunder and lightning then flashed outside.[Chapter 3] It was soon dinner time and the table was set. Darla was wearing a glittering purple dress with black dress shoes and white gloves that once belonged to Yzma as she loved the girl like an apprentice child she never had. \"If only my nephews were girls like you...\" Yzma sighed. \"I love them so though.\" \"Well, we better make sure Kronk has the you-know-what.\" Darla said. Kronk came by then. \"So, is everything ready for tonight?\" Yzma asked. \"Oh, yeah, I thought we'd start off with soup and a light salad, and then see how we feel after that.\" Kronk replied. \"Not the dinner.\" Darla groaned. \"You know...\" Yzma reminded. \"Oh, right! The poison. The poison for Kuzco. The poison chosen specially to kill Kuzco. Kuzco's poison,\" Kronk replied before looking lost. \"That poison?\" \"Yes, that poison!\" Yzma replied. \"Gotcha covered.\" Kronk then nodded. \"Excellent.\" Darla smiled. \"A few drops in his drink, then I'll propose a toast, and he'll be dead before dessert!\" Yzma smirked. \"Which is a real shame, because it's going to be delicious.\" Kronk replied. \" BOOM BAM, BABY! \" Kuzco kicked the door open as he came in with Atticus, Patch, Mo, and Cherry. \"Let's get to the grub! I am one hungry king of the world!\" \"Yeah, let's get our grub on.\" Mo smiled. \"I hope you don't mind, but I brought these guys along,\" Kuzco said. \"They're cooler than I thought,\" he then spun his chair and sat down, removing his crown at the table. \"So... No hard feelings about being let go?\" \"None whatsoever.\" Yzma said through her teeth. \"Uh, Kronk, why don't you give the emperor a drink?\" Darla asked. \"Drink... Oh, riiiiight...\" Kronk winked to her before going off before coming back after pouring a glass for the young emperor. \"Your Highness...\" Patch sniffed the air. \"I smell vegetables burning.\" Atticus soon covered his muzzle before making it look like he had said that. Kronk gasped before running off. \"My spinach puffs!\" The room then became awkward with silence. Kuzco played with his fork boredily. \"So, Darla, how's it going?\" Atticus asked his little sister. \"Oh, uh, going great.\" Darla said. \"So... He seems nice...?\" Cherry shrugged about Kronk. \"He is.\" Yzma replied. \"Is he in his late 20's?\" Mo asked. \"I'm not sure.\" Yzma smiled sheepishly. \"Saved 'em!\" Kronk came back in. \"Finally.\" Darla sighed. Yzma and Kuzco showed relief. \"Spinach puffs?\" Cherry and Atticus asked each other curiously. \"Watch it,\" Kronk warned gently. \"It's still hot.\" He soon started to place each spinach puff on a mini bowl. \"Ahem... Kronk...?\" Yzma reminded. \"The Emperor needs his drink...\" \"Right... OH!... Riiiight...\" Kronk replied before going to do that. But then he forgot which drink was the poison. \"You forgot which drink was for the emperor, didn't you?\" Darla asked, unimpressed. \"Erm...\" Kronk bit his lip. Darla looked at the glasses. \"They do kinda all look alike...\" Kronk soon took all of the drinks back so he could fix his problem. \"Hey, Kronky, everything okay back there?\" Kuzco called out. \"Oh, uh, the drinks were a bit on the warm side!\" Kronk replied nervously before coming over with the glasses. \"Hey, did you see that sky today? Talk about blue!\" \"Yes, Kronk, riveting...\" Yzma muttered. \"Yes, very riveting...\" Darla also muttered. \"A toast to the Emperor!\" Yzma raised her glass. \"Long live Kuzco!\" Kuzco spun the glass on his fingertip and then drank down the glass. Kronk gestured for Yzma and Darla not to drink since it was poison, so they splashed it onto a plant and a passing, annoying fly. Atticus, Mo, and Cherry seemed to not see Kronk's gesture as they drank their drinks. Darla looked nervous about that. \"Ah... Tasty.\" Kuzco smiled before his face fell flat on the table. \"Hey, you okay, Your Majesty?\" Atticus, Mo, and Cherry asked before doing the same thing. \"Finally!\" Yzma cheered. \"Good work, Kronk!\" \"Oh, they're so easy to make; I'll give you the recipe.\" Kronk smiled innocently. \"I didn't want you to kill my brother, his girlfriend, and his best friend as well! I just wanted you to kill Kuzco!\" Darla told Yzma. \"Should've thought of that before,\" Yzma replied innocently. \"Now to get rid of the bodies...\" Patch whimpered as he was worried about Atticus, but soon looked relieved. \"Okay! What were we saying?\" Kuzco sat right back up and the others followed him, must've been some odd side effect. \"Yeah, what were we saying?\" Atticus also asked. Darla pulled a strange face. \"Uh, we were just making a toast to, uh...\" Yzma stammered until suddenly the others grew long dangly ears. \"Your long and healthy... Rule.\" \"Uh, yeah...\" Darla said with wide eyes. \"So, what're you gonna do? I mean, you've been around here a long time, and I really mean a long time, um, I thought it might be difficult for someone of your age adjusting to life in the private sector,\" Kuzco continued before he and the others were slowly turning into llamas without even realizing or noticing it. \"Hey, Kronk, can you top me off, pal? Be a friend? Now about the finding new work.\" Darla and Yzma then began to use the broccoli as gestures to Kronk to tell him to kill Kuzco. \"More broccoli?\" Kronk asked as he took out a plate of the vegetable. Yzma groaned and face-palmed before hitting her first into her hand. \"Because, let's face it, you're no spring chicken...\" Kuzco continued. \"And I mean that in the most possible way-\" Kronk then whacked Kuzco in the head with the tray which knocked out the young emperor instantly. \"Is he okay?\" Mo asked before gasping to see Kuzco as a llama. \"What did we just drink?\" Cherry asked as she saw that her hands were now hooves. \"I have a feeling Yzma has something to do with this,\" Atticus glared before he heard a clang sound and where he looked to see Kronk with a dented bowl. \"Really?\" he then asked. \"Sorry, but Yzma wants me to.\" Kronk foolishly replied. Yzma soon went face-palm before spraying some perfume into Atticus, Mo, Cherry, and even Patch's faces. This made the others cough from that. \"Ugh, that smells really bad...\" Cherry groaned before she passed out with Mo, Cherry, and Patch. \"What, a llama?!\" Yzma gaped at Kuzco. \" HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE DEAD! \" \"Yeah... Weird...\" Kronk admitted. \"Let me see that vial.\" Darla said to Kronk while holding her hand out. Kronk took the bottle and gave it to her. Darla saw the skull, but then peeled back the label to see it was actually not poison. \"This isn't poison, this is extract of llama!\" Yzma groaned before hitting herself in the head as she couldn't believe how stupid she could be to let this happen. \"How did we not see that the paper was rolled down half way?\" Darla sighed. \"You know, in my defense, Yzma's poisons all look alike, she might think of re-labeling some of them.\" Kronk suggested. \"Take them out of town and finish the job!\" Yzma demanded. Kronk tilted his head with a small pout. \"What about dinner?\" \"Kronk, this is kind of important.\" Darla said. \"How about dessert?\" Kronk asked. Yzma paused for a moment. \"Well, I suppose there's time for dessert...\" \"And coffee?\" Kronk then asked with a hopeful smile. Yzma glanced at him before giving in. \"All right, a quick cup of coffee,\" she then grew vicious again. \"THEN TAKE HIM OUT OF TOWN AND FINISH THE JOB!\" \"And as for them?\" Kronk asked while pointing to Atticus and the others. \"Same with them.\" Yzma replied. \"Isnt' that a little too far?\" Darla asked nervously. \"I mean... That's my family!\" \"True, but they are witnesses.\" Yzma said. \"What...?\" Darla asked. \"Perhaps you should go with Kronk.\" Yzma decided. \"Me?!\" Darla squeaked slightly. \"Yes.\" Yzma nodded. Darla then sighed as she was brought into this, she then put her cloak back on. After dessert and coffee... Darla and Kronk were both now sneaking out the back while Kronk made some noises. 'Is he doing his own theme music?' Darla thought to herself in slight annoyance, but mild amusement as Kronk was more like a child than a grown man. A couple of people then passed by and Darla hid away while Kronk slunk to the wall, trying not to move. The two thought he was strange and as they passed by, Darla and Kronk went back to business and where they soon went to a bridge. Darla felt bad about doing this while Kronk didn't seem to care. At least, at first. The two of them soon threw the sack over the bridge. Darla frowned as she watched the sack flowing down the water. \"Mission accomplished.\" Kronk smirked and was about to walk away, but he couldn't help but feel guilty about what he had done. Sure, Kuzco was a bit of a jerk, but Kronk was way too nice to let this happen to someone, especially Darla's family involved. \"We can't just let them die.\" Darla said. \"No, you can't...\" a voice said. Darla looked around until she looked down to one shoulder to see what resembled her in an angel outfit with a white robe and wings with a golden halo. \"My shoulder angel...\" she muttered to herself. Her shoulder angel nodded with a smile. \"Don't listen to that girl,\" a figure that looked like Darla as well that had a pointed bow that resembled devil horns with bat wings, and a pitchfork appeared on the other shoulder. \"She's trying to lead you down the path of righteousness. I'm gonna lead you down the path that rocks!\" \"Uh, yeah, I don't think I'm going to listen to my shoulder devil.\" Darla said. \"Good girl, I taught you well.\" the angel smiled. Darla giggled shyly, then focused again. \"Focus! My family is in danger and I have to help them... Whether Kronk wants to or not,\" She then saw Kronk's shoulder angel and shoulder devil. \"Um... Is that normal?\" she asked her angel and devil. \"Normally when you're in a dilemma, but if you want, we can go.\" the devil offered. \"No, no.\" Darla shook her head. \"Just say the word.\" the angel replied. \"Thanks though.\" Darla smiled to her conscience. Kronk's shoulder devil was soon doing handstands. Darla and her guardians looked in deadpan. \"Wh-What does that have to do with anything?\" Kronk asked his devil. \"No, no, he's got a point.\" Kronk's angel replied. \"Listen, you guys, you're sort of confusing me, so be gone, or, you know, however I get rid of you guys.\" Kronk then told his angel and devil as he was either going to live with the guilt of the others dying by walking away or he could save them someway and somehow. \"Same with you two, I think I know what I have to do.\" Darla said to her guardians. \"As you wish.\" Darla's angel agreed before disappearing with the devil and Kronk's angel and devil. \"Okay, Kronk, you're strong, so you have to stop the bag from going down the river.\" Darla decided. \"You got it.\" Kronk nodded as he ran off to save them. Darla then ran with him as she hoped this would work out nicely. Kronk ran and luckily for him, he caught the sack just before it over the edge and where luckily the sack didn't seem heavy for him. \"You got that, Kronk?\" Darla bit her lip. \"Yep, no problem!\" Kronk smiled as he carried the sack with no problem. \"Your brother's a bit heavier than the others though, same with his dog.\" \"That's because they're super-strong,\" Darla said. \"As well as invulnerable.\" \"Hmm...\" Kronk replied. \"Okay, easy does it...\" Darla backed up as Kronk was lugging the bag back toward them. \"Now, I'm not sure where we could put them, but we can't let Yzma know about this... She'd probably get mad, she's scary enough to look at.\" \"Oh, no; what to do, what to do?\" Kronk asked, feeling nervous. Darla followed after him as she also felt nervous. There was a cat sleeping at the stairs they were walking down and Kronk accidentally stepped on the tail which made him yelp and accidentally throw the sack up and it ended up in the back of a cart of a very familiar man. \"Pacha.\" Darla said. \"What am I gonna tell the village?\" Pacha sighed as he looked very heartbroken over what Kuzco told him about today, he then loaded up and got ready to go, not realizing or noticing the sack just yet. Darla decided to let Pacha have the sack since this way, Yzma wouldn't know. Kronk tried to stop Pacha, but he didn't hear the bigger man as his llama was taking him home. \"This is not good... I hope that doesn't come back to haunt me...\" he frowned before looking deathly nervous. \"Don't worry, they are safe now.\" Darla said. \"I suppose so...\" Kronk said before trying to walk away from the scene. \"Good luck on whatever journey you guys go on.\" Darla prayed for her brother and the others before following after him. Unknown to her, they would soon wake up.[Chapter 4] Pacha sighed as he was on his way to his home where not only the other villagers lived, but his wife and kids and another one on the way and where one of his children was checking on how much he had grown. The mother smiled in amusement as she measured her kids. \"Mom, Mom! I think I'm still growing! Measure me again!\" the boy urged his mother. \"All right, Tipo,\" Pacha's wife chuckled. \"Stand still and let me see.\" \"Mom, you and I both know that it's impossible for him to have grown in the last five minutes,\" the girl rolled her eyes before looking curious. \"Isn't it?\" \"Look how much you've grown.\" Pacha's wife smiled at Tipo after she marked his height. \"What?\" the daughter looked surprised before pushing her brother. \"Tipo, get out of the way. It's my turn again. Measure me.\" Tipo then spotted Pacha which made him smile. \"Dad's home!\" He and his sister both then rushed to their father. Pacha's wife smiled, she then helped herself up as she was about to be due with their new baby any day now. Pacha laughed as he picked up his kids. \"Dad, I ate a bug today!\" Tipo smiled as he put his father's hat on. \"Oh, was Mom baking again?\" Pacha joked. \"Don't tell her I said that.\" \"I heard that.\" Pacha's wife said as she came over. The kids giggled while Pacha smirked teasingly. \"Alright, move aside, lady with a baby coming through.\" Pacha's wife said as she came to her husband. Pacha lifted his two kids out of the way as he then kissed his wife right on the lips and she kissed back. \"Oh, oh, Dad, look how big I am.\" Tipo smiled at his father as he got to the ground as he wanted to show him his new height. \"We were all measured today.\" Pacha's daughter, known as Chaca, announced with a smile. \"Oh?\" Pacha replied. \"I'm going through a growth spurt,\" Tipo smiled as he stood against the wall to show his height. \"I'm as big as you were when you were me.\" \"You sure are.\" Pacha smiled as he saw how big his son had gotten. \"That's not impressive as my loose tooth, see?\" Chaca smiled before wiggling her bottom tooth to show her dad. An older girl came out for Tipo and Chaca once she saw her parents were together again which meant that she had a job to do. \"Okay, okay, you two,\" Chicha told her younger kids. \"Our deal was that you could stay awake until Daddy came home. Now say good night.\" \"Dad, do we have to?\" the kids asked before pouting and gave puppy dog eyes. Pacha knew exactly what to do to get the kids to go to bed without giving into the puppy dog eyes or the pouting. \"No, you two can stay up,\" Pacha smirked as he stood beside his wife. \"We're just gonna be sittin' here tellin' each other how much we love each other. Right, honey?\" Chicha cooed and kissed against him. Tipo and Chaca were disgusted and ran inside the hut. \"Good night!\" \"I'll get them to bed, Mom and Dad.\" the older girl said. \"Thanks, Nina.\" Chicha smiled to their eldest. \"My pleasure.\" Nina smiled back. \"Good girl.\" Chicha nodded. \"Come on, guys, Mom and Dad said it's time for bed,\" Nina told Tipo and Chaca as it was time for bed. \"Though... I wish I could've met the Emperor today like Dad did...\" \"You wanna marry him.\" Chaca teased. \"What? Pssh! No...!\" Nina scoffed before blushing. Tipo and Chaca giggled. Nina then had the two brush their teeth, change into their pajamas, and get into their bunk bed for the night. \"I want you two to stay in bed like good little kids,\" she told her younger siblings. \"It's hard enough to help Mom keep the hut standing since we're about to have a new baby soon.\" \"We'll stay in bed.\" Tipo said. \"We promise.\" Chaca added. \"Good night, guys.\" Nina smiled and kissed her siblings on the forehead and blew out the candle in their room, she then left the room, came downstairs, as her mother was washing dishes while looking flustered while Pacha was going through serious distress about seeing the emperor today. \"Uh, Mom? Dad?\" Nina asked. \"Everything okay?\" \"Hmm? Oh, yeah, I'm just a little tired from the trip,\" Pacha spoke up before leaving. \"Um... I'm gonna go put Misty away.\" \"I gotta wash something...\" Chicha added. \"Mom, is this about the emperor?\" Nina asked. Chicha sighed. \"Your father just said the emperor couldn't see him... I'd love to give that guy a piece of my mind...\" she then glared slightly about Kuzco's arrogant behavior which was hard for the villagers to ignore since they lived under him. Nina had a feeling her father might have lied and decided to go and find out from Pacha what really happened. Chicha sighed as she then went to washing the dishes. Nina then came to see her father as he was very blue this evening. \"Dad, are you okay?\" she then gently called. \"Yeah, Nina, I'm just a bit exhausted from the trip.\" Pacha frowned. \"Dad...\" Nina replied as she senses something wrong. Pacha sighed as he couldn't keep anything from his oldest child. \"It's about Emperor Kuzco...\" he said. \"What about him?\" Nina asked. \"Nina, sit down, sweetie...\" Pacha patted the spot next to him as he had a lot on his mind about today. Nina soon came over and sat on the spot her father patted down. \"The Emperor wants to build something all for himself and make us move out of the village...\" Pacha explained. \"I can't bare to tell your mother.\" \"What does he want to build that could be more important than us living in the village?\" Nina asked. \"A swimming pool...\" Pacha sighed. \"A swimming pool?!\" Nina replied before scoffing and glaring. \"He can't be serious!\" \"I'm afraid he is.\" Pacha frowned. \"Man...\" Nina sighed. \"W-Where will we live?\" \"He didn't care...\" Pacha replied. \"Nina, I'm so sorry...\" Nina simply sighed as she didn't think Kuzco could be heartless. \"Are you going to be okay, dear?\" Pacha asked. \"Yes, but... I just wonder what'll happen to all of us...\" Nina replied. \"Especially with the new baby coming soon...\" The two of them soon heard something going on in the sack. \"Dad, did you hear that?\" Nina asked. Pacha looked to the bag and decided to open it up. \"Huh?\" he then asked as he saw the 'llamas' and looked worried and concerned for them. \"Where'd you come from, little guys?\" \"No touchy...\" Kuzco muttered in a daze. \"Where are we?\" Patch groaned as his head popped up. \"I feel like I got hit by a train...\" Cherry groaned as she got up. Pacha screamed and stepped back with Nina. \"Demon dog and llamas!\" \"What are you talking about?\" Atticus groaned as he got up. \"Demon dog and llamas, where?\" Kuzco asked before seeing Misty which made them both scream then. \"You should get back to the house.\" Pacha told Nina. \"So, we weren't dreaming; Yzma really did turn us into llamas!\" Mo panicked. \"You dreamt that too?\" Atticus asked. \"I did myself actually.\" Cherry added. \"Where are we anyway?\" Patch asked. \"You're in our village.\" Nina said. \"Wait... I know that guy...\" Kuzco glared to Pacha. \"It's that whiny peasant!\" \"Emperor Kuzco...?\" Pacha asked out of confusion. \"Schyeah!\" Kuzco scoffed. \"Who'd you think you were talking to?\" \"Should one of us tell him?\" Atticus whispered. \"Uh... How did, um, you don't... Look like the emperor.\" Pacha told Kuzco. \"What do you mean I don't look like the emperor?\" Kuzco replied with a deadpan expression. \"Um, uh, do this...\" Pacha told him, making a motion with his hands. \"What is this, some kind of little game you country folk like to-\" Kuzco scoffed as he copied and then saw he had hooves which made him scream out. \"It can't be!\" he then ran over to some water and saw that he was in fact turned into a llama. \"My face! Aah! My beautiful, beautiful face!\" \"Okay, just calm down.\" Nina said to Kuzco. \"I'm an ugly, stinky llama!\" Kuzco complained. \"Llama face!\" Nina then smacked him across the face to make him stop getting hysterical. \"Thanks, I needed that.\" Kuzco said. \"Okay, Your Majesty, how did this happen?\" Pacha asked. \"I'm tryin' to figure that out, okay? Ohh-ho! I can't remember, I can't remember anything,\" Kuzco replied before glaring to Pacha. \"Wait a minute. I remember you. I remember telling you that I was building my pool where your house was and then you got mad at me. Oh! And you turned me into a llama!\" \"What?! No, I did not!\" Pacha replied. \"Yes, and then you kidnapped me!\" Kuzco still glared. \"It wasn't him, it was Yzma !\" Patch barked at Kuzco. \"Yzma... Of course... That gives me an idea...\" Kuzco replied. \"I have to go back to the palace... She's got that 'secret lab', I'll just snap my fingers and order her to change me back.\" Nina couldn't believe Kuzco was as bad as her father said he was, then looked to him. \"Dad, I think you should stand up for yourself, he's a brat.\" \"What did you say?\" Kuzco asked Nina. Pacha took his eldest daughter's words into action and looked over to Kuzco as he bore a brave expression on his face. \"Build your summer home somewhere else.\" he then finally said. \"You deserve this,\" Nina glared to Kuzco. \"Unless you change your ways, you're gonna be stuck like that and we won't help you.\" \"And as for us?\" Cherry asked. \"I'm sorry, but I still say this.\" Nina replied as she turned away and folded her arms. \"And I agree with her choices.\" Pacha agreed with his eldest as she was being mature about this. \"But we didn't even agree with his stupid swimming pool idea! And besides, Atticus here can just stop them from building it since he's strong as a god!\" Cherry told them. \"What do you want us to do?\" Nina asked. \"It's not like we can turn you guys back into humans until Kuzco here learns his lesson.\" \"Or you guys can get us back to the palace and get Yzma to turn us back to human.\" Mo said. \"Hey, I got a little secret for you all,\" Kuzco smirked. \"Come closer... Closer... I DON'T MAKE DEALS WITH PEASANTS!\" \"Kuzco, stop that!\" Patch growled. \"Your selfishness got us all into this!\" \"That's right, if you hadn't fired Yzma, she wouldn't have tried to kill you!\" Atticus glared. \"Yeah, right, Yzma would never do that to me,\" Kuzco scoffed. \"If you aren't gonna help me, then I'll just go back to the palace all by myself...\" he then walked off, trying to walk on two legs, but soon went back to four as he couldn't keep his balance as a llama. \"I wouldn't recommend it,\" Pacha warned. \"It's a little dangerous if you don't know the way.\" \"He's right.\" Nina said. \"Nice try, guys.\" Kuzco scoffed as he kept walking forward, ignoring them. \"No, really, I'm telling you, there are jaguars and snakes and quicksand!\" Pacha tried to warn. \"Still not listening!~\" Kuzco mocked as he walked into the woods. \"There are also jaguars in there, so don't blame us if you get eaten!\" Cherry yelled. \"You know what? Just go ahead and go!\" Pacha yelled before looking annoyed and frustrated. \"If there's no Kuzco, there's no Kuzcotopia. Takes care of my problem.\" \"That's right.\" Cherry nodded. Pacha was then about to walk away with Nina, but soon felt guilty about letting Kuzco only go out to the woods to meet his untimely death. \"Can't you guys use magic to change us back?\" Mo asked Atticus and Patch. \"I'm still a dog.\" Patch said. \"But what about the rest of us who are stuck as llamas?\" Cherry asked. \"I don't think I can use my magic this way...\" Atticus said since he was also a llama. \"How about you, Patch?\" \"I can try to turn you three back to humans.\" Patch said. \"Fire at will!\" Cherry replied then. Patch then began to use his magic on Atticus, Cherry, and Mo. Atticus, Cherry, and Mo closed their eyes as they hoped they would be turned right back into humans and where it did work for them. \"Did it work?\" Cherry asked. \"Oh, no, Cherry, it didn't work for you!\" Atticus gasped. \"You're a monster now!\" Cherry screamed and looked in her reflection before glaring with a firm pout as she was back to normal and Atticus was trying to be funny. \"Not funny.\" she then glared. \"I can't believe it... Magic is real...\" Nina said. \"I always believed in it...\" \"I know what you mean, honey.\" Pacha agreed. \"Now, what are we going to do about Kuzco?\" Mo asked. \"We have to go after him...\" Pacha sighed. \"I'm too kind to let him go.\" \"You really have a big heart, Dad.\" Nina smiled admirably. \"So, shall we go save him from being eaten or killed?\" Atticus asked. \"Yes...\" Pacha replied. \"He better learn his lesson...\" Patch narrowed his eyes. \"I don't care if he's the Emperor, I'm gonna bite him on the tuckus!\" \"Nina, go back to your mother and brother and sister.\" Pacha told his eldest daughter. \"Okay, Dad.\" Nina said. Misty nodded in agreement. Nina smiled and pet the llama before she went back to the hut as Tipo and Chaca were fast asleep right now and Chicha was on her way to bed. \"Nina, where's your father?\" Chicha asked. \"Um, he's gone back to see the Emperor.\" Nina replied. \"Really?\" Chicha asked. \"At this late at night?\" \"The sooner the better...\" Nina shrugged. \"I'm gonna get to bed.\" \"Okay.\" Chicha replied. Nina nodded and then went to her bed as Tipo and Chaca were fast asleep in their bunk bed together.[Chapter 5] Meanwhile back in the jungle... \"Scary jungle... Right,\" Kuzco scoffed as he explored the jungle. \"Ooh, a leaf. Ooh, it might attack me. Oh, it's a scary tree. I'm afraid. Ha ha. Please. Never find my way? I'm the emperor, and as such, I'm born with an innate sense of direction. Okay, where am I? Wha-\" he then began to feel lost. He then started to get scary as he saw different things of the jungle and even saw a fly being eaten by a spider. It was rather disturbing, disgusting, and scary. \"Okay, that was the freakiest thing I've ever seen.\" Kuzco muttered. There was then a rustling in the bushes which made Kuzco scream, but it was just a friendly squirrel. \"What do you want?\" Kuzco glared at the squirrel. The squirrel then chattered and held out an acorn to become friends. \"Oh, for me?\" Kuzco smiled as he took the acorn. \"Why, I don't know what to say.\" The squirrel smiled before he was then chucked in the head with the acorn. \"Hit the road, Bucky!\" Kuzco glared at the squirrel. The squirrel began to rub its head out of frustration from the pain. Kuzco walked off in a huff only to fall through a jungle nest and then land into a pit of black jaguars which worried him instantly, but they were all asleep. As long as he was quiet, he could survive this. The squirrel decided to get back at Kuzco for his rudeness and he blew up a balloon, turning it into a balloon animal and took out a pin to pop it and wake up the wild cats. \"No, no, no, no.\" Kuzco shook his head. The squirrel nodded as he pushed the pin closer and closer to the balloon until... POP! Kuzco saw the jaguars were still asleep. \"HA!\" he then smirked before cupping his mouth as he then woke up the jaguars and where the jaguars all soon growled at him for waking them up. Kuzco ran for his life as the jaguars chased him and where he even tripped. The jaguars came closer and closer for Kuzco. Even the kitten seemed threatening. Kuzco backed up as he was at the edge of the cliff now. This looked like this was the end for him. He then suddenly heard yelling and looked away. Pacha did a Tarzan yell as he was coming by and swinging on a vine to save Kuzco. Atticus, Cherry, Mo, and Patch were doing the same thing. \"How do you steer this thing?!\" Cherry yelped as she had trouble with her vine. \"I don't think there is a way to steer it!\" Mo yelped. \"Aw, come on, Cherry, you met George of the Jungle!\" Atticus reminded. \"Yes, but he never taught me how to steer this thing!\" Cherry told him. \"Oh, man, I should've been there...\" Atticus replied. Cherry yelped and she then crashed into a tree. \"That's gotta hurt.\" Patch winced. Kuzco was soon rescued by Pacha and Cherry now swung on a vine with Atticus. \"Okay, let's get out of this jungle!\" Atticus decided. \"Uh-oh...\" Mo gulped once she saw where they were swinging to. \"Uh-oh? Why uh-oh? Why'd she say uh-oh?!\" Patch panicked. They soon got their answer as they got tied up on to a log with their vines. \"Sorry, Atticus.\" Mo frowned. \"That's okay, Mo.\" Atticus soothed. \"Maybe I'm just new to this whole rescuing thing, but this, to me, might be considered kind of a step backwards, wouldn't you say?\" Kuzco deadpanned. \"Don't worry, Your Highness, we will be able to get out of this.\" Patch said. \"This is alright,\" Pacha added. \"We can figure this out.\" The log then began to break off of the tree. \"I hate you.\" Kuzco muttered. \"Atticus, quick, break through the vines!\" Cherry yelled. Atticus took a deep breath and grunted as he used his muscles to break through the vines to prevent them from certain death and/or danger and where he was able to break through the ropes. \"Come on, guys!\" Atticus then said while Patch tried to gnaw at the vines and break through them with his muscles and he then joined his boy once they were free. The two then went to help out Cherry and Mo and where due to their strength, it was pretty easy. Cherry and Mo then crawled up to help Pacha and Kuzco get out with help from Atticus and Patch. \"WATER!\" Cherry called out. \"Oh, crud!\" Patch yelped as he knew neither Pacha or Kuzco could breathe underwater. SPLASH! Kuzco and Pacha were going through a long and painful way before going to a waterfall as the others turned into merpeople, and in Patch's case, a merpuppy. \"We have to save them before they reach that waterfall!\" Mo told them. \"Come on, Cherry.\" Atticus helped Cherry out with her swimming since she was still new the whole swimming thing. The four swam as quickly to the ex-emperor and village leader as quickly as they could. \"Uh-oh...\" Pacha said with wide eyes. \"Don't tell me, we're about go over a huge waterfall?\" Kuzco replied. \"Yep.\" Pacha nodded. \"Sharp rocks at the bottom?\" Kuzco asked. \"Most likely.\" Pacha nodded again. Kuzco had a blank expression on his face until he spoke again. \"Bring it on...\" Atticus soon grabbed onto the log as he stopped them from falling down the waterfall. \"What happened?\" Kuzco asked. \"Hey, Atticus saved us!\" Pacha said as he looked over. \"Okay, now where do I put you guys?\" Atticus wondered with clenched teeth as he held the log. \"Just put us somewhere that is far from the waterfall.\" Kuzco said. \"All right, here we go!\" Atticus said before moving with the others. They were now at the riverbank. Pacha took off his cloak since it was soaking wet and he decided to make a fire to warm them all up. \"That was a close call.\" Patch said. \"Now that you're here, you will take me back to the palace,\" Kuzco decided as he dried himself off. \"I'll have Yzma change me back, and then I'll start construction on Kuzcotopia. Oh, yeah.\" \"Yeah, the Kuzcotopia thing is not happening.\" Atticus said. \"You can just forget about that.\" Patch added. \"What?!\" Kuzco gasped. \"I'm sorry, but you need to hear this, Kuzco.\" Patch replied. \"Yeah, if you build Kuzcotopia then you'll be the cause for many people becoming homeless.\" Atticus said. \"Don't you feel bad about that?\" Mo asked. Kuzco paused to think slightly. \"Yeah, I bet you didn't think about that, did you?\" Cherry scoffed. \"And besides, Yzma is probably now telling your staff that you and the four of us are dead without knowing that we aren't dead.\" Patch said. \"Yzma wouldn't do that...\" Kuzco shook his head. Pacha sighed as he wanted Kuzco to change, but it felt like it couldn't happen, but he wouldn't give up.[Chapter 6] At the palace... Everyone wore black as there was a picture of the young emperor and everyone carried candles to honor the memory. \"And so, it is with great sadness that we mourn the sudden departure of our beloved prince,\" Yzma gave a eulogy. \"Taken from us so tragically on the very eve of his eighteenth birthday.\" Kronk began to cry into his hands. \"Poor little guy...\" Darla patted him on the back as she bore a grim expression on her face to play along. \"His legacy will live on in our hearts for all eternity.\" Yzma soon concluded. \"He never had a chance.\" Kronk sniffled. \"Well...\" Yzma said before throwing off her cloak to show a glittering pink dress with a feather. \"He ain't getting any deader! Back to work.\" All of the staff soon started to work on making everything Yzma like. \"Kronk, darling, I must admit you had me worried when you mixed up those poisons, but now that Kuzco is dead, all is forgiven.\" Yzma smirked as she was given some food. \"Ah, oh, yeah, yeah, he's dead all right, along with those others...\" Kronk replied nervously. \"I mean, you can't get much deader than they than they are right now. Unless, of course, we killed them again.\" Yzma gave him a suspicious look. \"I suppose...\" Darla soon got nervous before seeing the royal dresser. \"Oh, look, the royal dresser's here!\" she then said before dashing off. \"Kronk... Darla...\" Yzma came to her henchman and the little girl. \"I should tell you right now I'm kind of hard to fit,\" Kronk told the royal dresser. \"I wear a 66 long and a 31 waist.\" \"And you, my dear?\" The royal dresser asked Darla. \"Oh, just a nice small size...\" Darla said. \"Around six or seven maybe.\" The royal dress designer nodded and was about to measure her. Yzma then kicked him off the stand. Darla gasped at that, but looked relieved as the royal dresser had a soft landing on a pillow. \"Kuzco is dead, right?\" Yzma grinned to Kronk and Darla. \"Tell me Kuzco's dead. I need to hear these words.\" \"Are those words you want to be said exactly?\" Darla smiled nervously. Yzma soon got crazy angry. \"HE'S STILL ALIVE?!\" \"Well, he's not as dead as we would've hoped.\" Kronk shrugged innocently. \"Kronk...\" Yzma growled through her teeth. \"I just thought I'd give you the heads-up in case Kuzco ever came back with those others.\" Kronk replied. \"They can't come back.\" Yzma glared as she looked like she was about to blow. \"Yeah, that would be awkward,\" Kronk replied. \"Especially after that lovely eulogy.\" \"You think?!\" Yzma hissed as she grabbed Kronk by his collar and also glared to Darla. \"You and I are going out to find them. If any of them talk, we are through! Now let's move!\" \"Y-Y-Y-Yes, ma'am.\" Darla nodded. Meanwhile... \"DAD, LOOK OUT!\" Tipo yelled out as he suddenly woke up in his bed and panted heavily. Chicha came into the room with a candle as she was concerned about her son. \"Tipo, what is it?\" she then asked. \"I had a dream that Dad was tied to a log and was careening out of control down a raging river of death!\" Tipo cried out. \"It was awful until he was saved by that strong boy and his dog!\" \"That sounds like quite a dream you had, but don't worry, your dad is fine; he just went back to see the emperor.\" Chicha told him. Tipo paused for a moment and then settled down. \"Oh, yeah, like you and Nina told him to 'cuz you guys are always right.\" \"Well, in my dream, Dad was with a llama and a dog turned these other llamas into people like magic!\" Chaca spoke up. \"That could never happen.\" Tipo scoffed. \"It could!\" Chaca argued. \"Nuh-uh.\" \"Yuh-huh!\" \"Nuh-uh...\" The two then went back and forth. \"Good night you two.\" Chicha giggled as she was about to blow the candle out. \"Night, Mom!\" Chaca and Tipo replied before going back. Nina giggled as she had overheard her younger siblings' argument before they went to sleep. Back in the woods... Pacha was soon getting cold since he gave Kuzco his poncho to keep warm through the night, but Kuzco soon woke up to give it back. \"Thanks.\" Kuzco said. \"Oh, no problem.\" Pacha replied. \"Feels like wool.\" Kuzco said. \"Yeah.\" Pacha nodded. \"Alpaca?\" Kuzco then asked. \"Oh, yeah, it is...\" Pacha nodded again. The rest of the conversation which became awkward as a frog croaked. The two kept talking until Cherry, Atticus, Mo, and Patch finally woke up. Patch yawned and stretched while smacking his lips, he then came up to the water and lapped some of it up to have a drink. \"Mm... Delicious.\" He smiled. Atticus smiled and pet his dog while rubbing his eyes and looked to Mo as she was slowly waking up. Mo's light brunette hair danced in the wind until she then felt the top of her head and her green eyes widened. \"Wh-Where's my...?\" she then looked around. \"Where's my bandanna?!\" Atticus looked around until he saw it had been caught in the wind and was now stuck on a branch. He then climbed up the tree and went to get the bandanna for his girlfriend. \"I bet you stole it!\" Mo glared at Cherry. \"I hate you, Cherry! You're always Little Miss Doom and Gloom! Would it kill you to smile once in a while?! I-\" \"Found it.\" Atticus came back with the bandanna. Cherry glared slightly while Mo smiled nervously. \"Totally love you, my dear cousin!\" Mo laughed nervously. Cherry rolled her eyes. Mo then took the bandanna and tied it back onto her head and felt much better now. \"Guys? I think they're getting along.\" Patch told the others as he smiled to Kuzco and Pacha. \"Then why do I feel like Kuzco is only acting?\" Cherry asked. \"Hm?\" Patch asked her. \"He just seems... Fake...\" Cherry shrugged. \"I agree.\" Mo said. Later, Pacha took them to a bridge. \"Okay,\" Pacha told the others. \"Once we cross this bridge, it's only an hour to the palace.\" \"Good, because believe it or not, I think I need a bath.\" Kuzco replied. \"Oh, trust us, we believe it.\" Atticus said. \"What was that?\" Kuzco asked. \"Nuthin',\" Pacha smirked with a chuckle until he stepped on a rotting wood on the bridge and then fell, but was then caught by the vines. \"WHOA!\" \"You okay, Pacha?\" Atticus asked. \"I think so... One of you, quick, help me up!\" Pacha replied. \"No, I don't think I will.\" Kuzco said, proving Cherry's hunch to be correct. \"You're going to leave me here?\" Pacha asked. \"Well, I was going to have you imprisoned for life, but I kind of like this better,\" Kuzco smirked. \"Get one of these guys to help you, you don't need someone like me, I'm too important to care.\" \"I was right!\" Cherry glared. \"You were only acting!\" \"Yeah, yeah, good for you...\" Kuzco rolled his eyes at her. \"Well, I had to say something to get you guys to take me back to the city.\" \"Why you no good heartless man, you are, by far, the most heartless eighteen-year-old that we have ever met!\" Mo glared. \"Well, I guess I better get going,\" Kuzco chuckled. \"Buh-Bye.\" Patch snarled as he then wanted to punish Kuzco, but karma seemed to beat him to it as he suffered the same fate as Pacha did moments earlier. \"Ha!\" Cherry laughed. \"Are you okay?\" Pacha asked. \"Are you all right?\" \"Yeah... Yeah, I think I'm all right.\" Kuzco replied. \"Good!\" Pacha said before punching him since he deserved it. \"That's for going back on your promise!\" \"Yeah!\" The others yelled in agreement. Kuzco then hit Pacha right back. \"Yeah, that's for kidnapping me and taking me to your village... Which I'm still gonna destroy, by the way,\" he then laughed until he suddenly got nervous. \"No touchy...\" Pacha then slammed against Kuzco. \"You are still going to build it?!\" Path barked at Kuzco. \"Well, duh!\" Kuzco replied. \"What else would I do?\" \"That's it, we're leaving you here!\" Atticus glared before going down and helping Pacha out of the vines before getting him back on the bridge. \"You dug your own grave, now you need to lie in it.\" Mo added firmly. \"Lucky...\" Cherry muttered. \"Thanks for the help.\" Pacha said to Atticus. \"No problem, I have a heart unlike some people!\" Atticus smiled to him before glaring down to Kuzco. They then heard the rope from the bridge breaking. \"We're so out of here.\" Patch said before walking off. \"You can't leave me here!\" Kuzco yelped. \"Sure we can.\" Mo said. \"You have a nice life now.\" Cherry smirked. \"Please, let me out!\" Kuzco begged. \"And let you be the cause of many people becoming homeless? No way!\" Patch barked. \"I'll change my ways! Honest!\" Kuzco cried out. Cherry and Atticus hummed in thought together before glaring. \"NO!\" \"Please, I'm too young to die!\" Kuzco begged. Pacha glared to Kuzco, but due to being a nice guy, he couldn't help but think about the consequence of leaving Kuzco alone to die. \"Guys, we can't just leave him here.\" he then said. \"I hate to admit it, but you're right.\" Atticus sighed. Patch kept trying to walk away, but he then sighed. \"Curse me being a dog... I'm born with loyalty.\" \"Great.\" Mo sighed. They all then decided to help Kuzco and once they did, the bridge broke instantly and they were still on the one side of the canyon. \"Don't make us regret saving you.\" Atticus said to Kuzco. \"Well, we better get going,\" Pacha remarked. \"With that bridge out, it's a four-day walk to the palace.\" \"What?\" Kuzco asked. \"You mean, you're still taking me back?\" \"I shook on it, didn't I?\" Pacha replied. \"Well, yeah, but I hope you realize that doesn't change a thing,\" Kuzco then said. \"I'm still building Kuzcotopia when I get back.\" \"Kuzco...\" Cherry glared. \"No, no, four days is a long time,\" Pacha replied. \"Who knows? Maybe he'll change his mind.\" \"Uh-huh... Four days,\" Kuzco said before looking weak. \"What are the chances of one of you carrying me?\" \"Depends, are your feet getting tired?\" Atticus asked. \"I'm not sure if I can walk very far right now.\" Kuzco said. Atticus then picked up Kuzco and held him close. \"All right, just no monkey business.\" \"I'm a llama, Atticus...?\" Kuzco reminded. \"It's a figure of speech.\" Atticus said. \"Come on, let's get going.\" Mo said. \"I hope there's food too... I'm getting hungry.\" Kuzco said. \"Food does sound good right about now.\" Cherry had to agree. Elsewhere in the woods... \"No, no, no! We've searched every village surrounding the palace and still no sign of Kuzco or those others,\" Yzma growled as she marked out villages on her map. \"Where are they?\" \"Maybe they're in the jungle.\" Darla said. \"KRONK!\" Yzma called over her intercom. \"Kronk, here.\" Kronk replied. \"I'm getting tired, pull over!\" Yzma demanded. \"Sure thing, Kronk out.\" Kronk said before signing off and then getting down on his hands and knees. \"Once we find them, are you going to send Kronk to take care of the others while you kill Kuzco?\" Darla asked nervously. \"Might as well...\" Yzma replied before she stood up once they stopped and came down as they were in the woods, but then groaned once she saw she was in mud. \"Perfect... These are my best shoes!\" she then tried to walk, only for her shoes to slip off from the stickiness of the mud. \"I hate this jungle...\" she then groaned and her scarf slapped her in the face and a bunch of bees buzzed and invaded her face. Darla cringed and groaned slightly as Kronk was distracted by a bird. Yzma soon started to run while trying to evade the bees. \"Ooh, what a pretty bird...\" Darla cooed. \"A golden-throated small-winged warbler,\" Kronk smiled to the bird. \"Just one more for Exotic Bird Bingo.\" \"Ooh.\" Darla smiled. \"I am loving this.\" Kronk smiled back. Yzma soon got away from the bees only to run into the squirrel from earlier who chattered to her. \"GET AWAY FROM ME!\" The squirrel then ran off from her and came to Darla and Kronk who then chattered to them. \"She doesn't hate you, little guy.\" Darla soothed the squirrel. The squirrel chattered again. \"No, no, it's not you,\" Kronk added. \"She's not the easiest person to get close to. There's a wall there. Trust me.\" \"Are you both talking to that squirrel?\" Yzma glared slightly. \"I can be able to talk to all animals.\" Darla said. \"And as for me, I was a Junior Chipmunk,\" Kronk added in. \"I had to be versed in all the woodland creatures. Please continue.\" \"Thank you.\" the squirrel told them before telling his story to them of what a rough time he had lately. \"Ugh! Why me?\" Yzma groaned. \"Why me?!\" \"Could you please keep it down? I'm trying to listen to this poor squirrel's story.\" Darla said. \"Hey, it doesn't always have to be about you,\" Kronk told Yzma. \"This poor little guy has had it rough. Seems a talking llama gave him a hard time the other day.\" Yzma gasped and then rushed right over. \"Oh, a talking llama?! Ah, do tell...\" The squirrel soon started to whisper something to Darla and Kronk. \"Um, 'Auntie Yzma'?\" Darla looked to the woman. \"I'm afraid he doesn't wanna talk to you.\" \"Uh, well then, one of you ask him.\" Yzma then replied. \"Okay.\" Darla said. Kronk talked to the squirrel in his native language. \"Well, he was here and then I made jaguars go after him after he insulted me.\" the squirrel began to explain. \"Sounds like karma was doing its job after he insulted you, continue.\" Darla said. \"Brutal.\" Kronk agreed. \"So, then anyway,\" the squirrel continued as Yzma snuck over to come in the middle of them. \"I wanted to give him a little payback, so I made a balloon puppy, and popped it, and then-\" he then noticed Yzma and stopped talking and folded his arms, turning his back on the wicked woman. \"Uh, could you give us a little room here?\" Kronk asked. \"Oh, sorry.\" Yzma smiled sheepishly before taking a few steps back. The squirrel still glared. \"Uh, a little bit further, please?\" Darla begged. Yzma then went about twenty feet away. \"How's this?!\" \"Perfect.\" The squirrel approved. \"Yeah, that's good.\" Kronk replied. \"NOW ONE OF YOU ASK HIM WHICH WAY THE TALKING LLAMA WENT!\" Yzma then called out. \"Could you please tell us which way the talking llama went?\" Darla asked the squirrel. \"That way.\" the squirrel pointed in one direction. \"Thank you.\" Darla smiled and gave the squirrel a gentle pat on the head. The squirrel liked how Darla and Kronk treated him. \"Such a cute squirrel.\" Darla smiled. \"You would make an excellent Junior Chipmunk.\" Kronk smiled down to Darla. \"Thanks.\" Darla smiled back. They then left the woods and went back to tracking down Kuzco and the others.[Chapter 7] Meanwhile... \"Low blood sugar, huh?\" Pacha asked as Atticus carried Kuzco. \"Yeah, it's a curse.\" Kuzco smiled weakly. \"Well, luckily we found a place with food.\" Mo said. They came up to a diner, but it didn't allow llamas which meant that Kuzco would have to go in disguise. \"Welcome to Mudka's Meat Hut, home of the mug... Of meat,\" the waitress greeted her new customers. \"What'll it be?\" Atticus, Mo, Cherry, and Patch began to look over the menus. Patch was allowed in oddly enough. \"We'll have two specials,\" Pacha told the waitress before smiling to Kuzco. \"Is that all right, dear?\" \"Oh, whatever you say, pumpkin,\" Kuzco replied as he was now disguised as a woman. \"You know what I like.\" Pacha chuckled and whispered to the waitress. \"We're on our honeymoon.\" \"I think I'm going to gag.\" Cherry whispered. \"Bless you for coming out in public,\" the waitress mumbled. \"So, that's two specials.\" \"And an onion log,\" Kuzco said before giggling sheepishly in his girl voice. \"To split!\" \"Ordering! I need two heartburns and a deep-fried doorstop on table twelve!\" the waitress called out to the cook after taking the orders. The group soon started to laugh. \"Okay, so I'll admit this was a good idea.\" Pacha said. \"When will you learn that all my ideas are good ones?\" Kuzco replied with a smug smirk. \"That's funny, because I thought going into the jungle by yourself, being chased by jaguars, lying to us to take you back to the palace, were all really bad ideas.\" Cherry deadpanned. \"Yeah.\" Patch smirked. \"Anything sounds bad when you say it with that attitude.\" Kuzco replied. The waitress gave everyone their food, but Kuzco soon looked sick to his stomach once he saw what he and Pacha would be eating. \"Hot and crispy pillbug for the happy couple. Mazel tov.\" she then tossed confetti in the air before leaving. \"Oh, boy!\" Pacha beamed as he hit the bug with his bamboo stick and slurped the juice on the inside. \"That looks disgusting.\" Patch whispered. Kuzco looked like he was going to throw up and even cupped his mouth with a hoof. \"Oh, here, let me get that for you.\" Pacha said as he tapped the bug and splatted it open for the llama. Kuzco recoiled in severe disgust and soon left his seat to go in the back. \"Where are you going?\" Atticus asked. \"I'm just going to slip into the kitchen and have a word with the chef.\" Kuzco replied. \"You're going to get us thrown out.\" Cherry said. \"Please,\" Kuzco replied as he bounced his new hair. \"With this disguise, I'm invisible.\" he then continued to walk off in the back. Another man spotted Kuzco and checked out his backside and gave a thumb's up to Pacha. Pacha gave a weak thumb's up back and then decided to eat his pill bug. \"We've been walking around in circles for who knows how long,\" Yzma glared as she came with Kronk and Darla. \"That is the last time we take directions from a squirrel. I should have done away with Kuzco myself when I had the chance.\" This caused Pacha to start coughing as he heard that while eating. \"Oh, you really gotta stop beating yourself up about that.\" Kronk said to Yzma like a kind and supportive friend. Yzma then bent her fork slightly and dropped it to the table out of rage. \"Uh-oh, I'll get you another one there, Yzma,\" Kronk said, then turned to Pacha which made the man very nervous. \"You using that fork there, pal?\" Darla soon saw who was behind them and quickly sat back down. \"Hey, don't I know you?\" Kronk asked once Pacha handed him the fork. \"I-I don't think so.\" Pacha replied nervously. \"Wrestled you in high school?\" Kronk replied as he stopped to think. \"Metal shop? I got it! Miss Narca's Interpretive Dance, two semesters. I was usually in the back because of my weak ankles. Come on, pal. You gotta help me out here.\" \"We have to go get Kuzco and get out of here.\" Atticus whispered. \"To the kitchen.\" Mo whispered back. They then snuck over to the kitchen as Kuzco was ranting to the chef. \"Look, all I know is the food looked iffy,\" Kuzco said. \"I'm not the only one that thinks that, I'm sure.\" \"Kuzco, we need to go.\" Atticus whispered. \"So, I'm just checking to make sure you're going to take the main course up a notch.\" Kuzco continued. In the dining area... \"Is there anything on this menu that isn't swimming in gravy?\" Yzma glared in disgust. \"Hang on, I'll go ask the chef.\" Kronk stood up and went to the back. \"Maybe their seafood doesn't have any gravy on it.\" Darla said. \"It's a simple question,\" Kuzco asked the chef before he got carried away. \"Is there or is there not anything edible... On this menu?\" The chef growled as he felt insulted. \"Hey, I didn't ask him about dessert yet!\" Kuzco cried out to Pacha and Atticus. \"We don't care.\" Mo said. \"Guys, someone's coming!\" Cherry whispered loudly. They all then went to hide away as Kronk came to see the chef. \"Hey, pal, what's your policy on making special orders?\" Kronk smiled to the chef politely. \"All right, buster, that's it! You want a special order, then you make it! I quit!\" the chef snapped as he finally had enough and decided to leave. \"I try and I try, but there's no respect for anyone with vision. That's it! There's just nothing I can do about it!\" he then stormed off to never be seen or heard from ever again. \"It's just Kronk.\" Cherry sighed. \"Please don't go!\" Kronk tried to stop the chef, but the waitress had chimed in and there were hungry people waiting outside, he couldn't just let them go hungry, could he? \"Three pork combos, extra bacon on the side, two chili cheese samplers, a basket of liver and onion rings, a catch of the day, and a steak cut in the shape of a trout,\" the waitress gave the orders. \"You got all that, honey?\" \"Three oinkers wearing pants, plate of hot air, basket of grandma's breakfast, and change the bull to a gill,\" Kronk smiled in determination. \"Got it.\" \"Alright, let's get out of here.\" Mo whispered. \"What's going on?\" Kuzco asked. \"No time to explain, we need to leave, now!\" Patch replied. \"In a minute, I'm still hungry.\" Kuzco went back in the kitchen as Yzma was storming over impatiently. \"No, Kuzco!\" Atticus and Patch whispered loudly. \"Okay, I'll make it simple for you,\" Kuzco said as he walked by without Kronk knowing it. \"I'll have a spinach omelette with wheat toast. You got it?\" \"Can do.\" Kronk replied. Atticus and the others soon tried to get Kuzco. \"What's taking so long?\" Yzma demanded. \"Pick up!\" Kronk called before ringing a bell with a plate of food. \"Kronk! What are you doing?\" Yzma glared. \"Kinda busy here.\" Kronk replied. \"Why am I not surprised?\" Yzma groaned. \"Your order's up!\" Kronk then called out with another plate of food. Darla soon came in to see what was going on. \"Oh, well, while you're at it, make me the special. And hold the gravy!\" Yzma told Kronk, then looked down to Darla. \"What would you like to eat, dear?\" \"Oh, just lobster.\" Darla said. \"Check,\" Kronk replied. \"Pick up!\" The two then walked out at first. \"You know what? On second thought, make my omelette a meat pie.\" Kuzco came back in before walking out again. \"Meat pie, check.\" Kronk nodded. Atticus and the others began to try to not get seen. \"Kronk! Can I order the potatoes as a side dish?\" Yzma asked. \"I'll have to charge you full price.\" Kronk replied. \"Ooh!\" Yzma snapped and then walked out. Atticus and the others soon got in position on a sign so they wouldn't be caught. \"Hey, how about a side of potatoes, my buddy?\" Kuzco asked. \"You got it,\" Kronk replied. \"Want cheese on those potatoes?\" \"Thank you, Kronk,\" Yzma nodded. \"Cheddar will be fine.\" \"Cheddar spuds coming up.\" Kronk replied. \"Spuds yes, cheese no.\" Kuzco declined. \"Hold the cheese.\" Kronk replied. \"No, I want the cheese.\" Yzma told him. \"Cheese in.\" Kronk replied. \"Cheese me no likee.\" Kuzco shook his head. \"Cheese out.\" Kronk replied. \"Cheese in!\" Yzma argued. \"Come on, make up your mind!\" Kronk complained. \"Okay, okay, on second thought-\" Kuzco started. \"Make my potatoes a salad.\" Kuzco and Yzma then said together. Yzma soon cleared out her right ear, thinking she had heard another voice. Darla stared out the window as she felt hungry. Yzma and Kuzco put their menus up and down, but didn't seem to notice each other, even after taking their drinks and staring at their menus. \"We have to get rid of Yzma somehow.\" Cherry said to Pacha, Atticus, Mo, and Patch. \"I have an idea.\" Atticus smiled. \"Yikes.\" Cherry muttered as the waitress walked by. \"Excuse me, Miss, it's that lady's birthday, do you still those here?\" Atticus whispered to the waitress while pointing to Yzma. \"Don't worry, hon, we do that all the time.\" The waitress replied as she then went to deliver her next order to the table. Yzma blinked behind her menu and took a suspicious glance to Kuzco disguised as a woman. \"What is it, Yzma?\" Darla asked. \"There's something odd about that woman...\" Yzma hummed in thought. \"Hmm...\" Darla hummed with her. \"One, two, three, four!\" A waitress counted and Yzma turned to her with a scream with a birthday cake and a hate as she and the other workers sang to the older woman, \"Happy, happy birthday from all of us to you, We wish it was our birthday so we could party too, Happy, happy birthday, may all your dreams come true~...\" Atticus and the others soon grabbed Kuzco and they ran out. Darla looked around, not sure what to say or do in this situation. \"It's your birthday?\" Kronk chuckled as he came out of the kitchen. \"What are you doing?\" Kuzco glared as he was pulled out. \"Kuzco, we had to get out of there.\" Patch said. \"He's right, there's people in there looking for you.\" Pacha added urgently. \"What?\" Kuzco asked out of confusion. \"A big guy and a skinny old woman.\" Pacha explained. \"Wait, is this woman scary beyond all reason?\" Kuzco asked. \"Oh, yeah.\" Pacha nodded. \"That's Yzma and Kronk, we're saved!\" Kuzco smiled as he wiped off the make-up. \"My little sister was with them, though I don't know why.\" Atticus said. \"Trust me, they're not here to save you.\" Pacha told Kuzco. \"They're here to take me back to the palace...\" Kuzco smiled in relief. \"Thanks for your help. You've been great. I can take it from here.\" he then went to walk away to find Yzma, Kronk, and Darla so he could finally go back home. \"That's a bad idea.\" Patch said. \"They're trying to kill us!\" Cherry told Kuzco. \"Well, Darla would never wanna hurt us, but Yzma and Kronk definitely would!\" \"What? Their whole world revolves around me!\" Kzuco replied. \"Who do you think tried to poison you?!\" Atticus reminded him. \"Just listen to us!\" Mo said to Kuzco. \"What? Oh... I get it...\" Kuzco said before glaring to them all. \"None of you wanna take me back to the palace, you all just wanna keep me stranded out here forever! That's why the rest of you are humans and I'm still a dumb old llama!\" \"That's not it.\" Patch said. \"This has all been an act and I fell for it!\" Kuzco huffed. \"Will you just listen to-\" Cherry tried. \"No, no, you listen to me!\" Kuzco glared. \"All you guys care about is that stupid hilltop!\" \"Stupid hilltop?!\" Patch growled before tackling Kuzco. \"Ow, hey, get off of me!\" Kuzco glared. \"I don't care if you're the emperor or not, you deserve this!\" Patch snarled. \"I should bite you!\" \"And I'm allowing him to do just that.\" Atticus said. \"You guys do what you want, I know that I'm out of here.\" Pacha decided. \"You go ahead and protect your family, sir,\" Patch soothed before glaring to Kuzco. \"And you have nobody!\" \"That's right.\" Mo said coldly. \"You wanna go get killed, go ahead, just don't ask us to watch.\" Cherry said just as firmly. Patch bit Kuzco on the ear before then leaving with Cherry, Atticus, and Mo. \"Oww!\" Kuzco complained from the pain before going to Yzma and Kronk only to overhear Yzma's plan to have him get killed. \"We'll have to start searching again.\" Darla said. \"Oh, this entire mess is your fault.\" Yzma glared to Kronk. \"Oh, what'd I do?\" Kronk asked as he carried a slice of cake for the woman. \"If you hadn't mixed up those poisons, Kuzco and maybe those others would be dead now!\" Yzma hissed. \"There'll be no more diversions until we track that llama down and kill him!\" \"Yep,\" Darla said. \"That selfish emperor has had this coming.\" Kuzco couldn't believe what he was hearing. \"I said I was sorry,\" Kronk said. \"Can't we let this go? Even on your birthday?\" he then handed the cake to Yzma as they went to get back on the trail. \"Should we explain to him that it's not your birthday?\" Darla asked Yzma. \"That could take ages, darling.\" Yzma sighed. \"True.\" Darla said. Kronk then went off with them. Kuzco instantly felt bad and called out for Pacha and the others so they could make up, but he couldn't seem to find them. He felt so hopelessly lost now.[Chapter 8] \"Atticus, I'm sorry I bit Kuzco, but he made me mad.\" Patch whimpered. \"Hey, it's okay, Patch.\" Atticus soothed. \"You did the right thing.\" No added in agreement. \"That's right.\" Cherry said. \"I still feel bad about biting...\" Patch said. \"You're a good dog, Patch and no one can take that away from you.\" Atticus coaxed. Patch soon started to nuzzle his master. Atticus giggled. \"That tickles!\" It soon started to get stormy. Patch shivered from that. \"Come on, we gotta get out of this rain!\" Cherry said to the others. They were soon back where they started in the adventure. \"This looks weirdly familiar...\" Patch muttered. \"Oh, great, look.\" Mo groaned as she pointed to a familiar llama. \"Let's leave him here in the rain.\" Cherry said to the others. \"I think he might have learned the truth while we were gone.\" Mo said. \"I hope so.\" Patch said as Kuzco sulked in the rain. \"Uh, Kuzco?\" Atticus asked. Kuzco looked over before glaring miserably to them. \"Oh, it's you guys... You come to laugh at me?\" \"No, we just got a little lost and you look like you could use some company.\" Atticus said. Patch pulled a face, but he had to admit that they were right. \"I'm sorry, guys, I should've listened to you all...\" Kuzco sighed glumly. \"So, you heard the truth come from the old hag?\" Cherry guessed. \"Yes...\" Kuzco frowned. \"You gonna listen from now on?\" Mo asked. \"Yes.\" Kuzco nodded. \"And are you tired of being a llama?\" Atticus asked. \"Yes..\" Kuzco sniffled. \"He's telling the truth.\" Patch told the others gladly. \"Great, in the morning, we'll search for Pacha.\" Mo said. \"I'll make some shelter, is anyone hungry?\" Atticus replied. Patch whimpered with puppy dog eyes as he had his food bowl in his mouth. \"Besides you.\" Atticus chuckled to his puppy. \"But I am hungry.\" Patch muffled with a whimper. \"You're always hungry,\" Atticus said. \"It has been a while since we all last ate.\" \"And how do you plan on getting some food?\" Kuzco asked. \"Do you believe in magic?\" Mo asked. \"Magic?\" Kuzco echoed. \"Do it.\" Cherry told Atticus. Atticus soon used his magic to make food appear. \"Can you make extra bacon?\" Patch panted while Kuzco looked gob smacked at what he was seeing. \"The slim king with extra grease?\" \"Of course.\" Atticus nodded. He soon used his magic to make just the kind of bacon Patch requested. \"Baaaaaaconnn...\" Patch grinned and then nommed down on his favorite human food. \"What in the...?\" Kuzco's eyes widened. \"That was magic.\" Mo said. \"Real magic?\" Kuzco asked. The others nodded to confirm it. \"Wow.\" Kuzco smiled. \"Come on, Kuzco, dig in!\" Mo encouraged as she ate a vegetarian sandwich. Kuzco soon started to eat some of the food. They all ate together in the warm and dry shelter Atticus made for them from his magic and where they all soon fell asleep after eating. They would get back on the road by sunrise tomorrow morning. Meanwhile at Yzma's camp, and where everyone there were fast asleep as well and nothing seemed to wake up Kronk, except when he thought about Pacha. \"The peasant at the diner!\" Kronk gasped but he realized the wrong thing before falling back asleep. \"He didn't pay his check...\" After about a few moments of sleeping, Kronk soon realized where he saw Pacha from. \"He's the peasant who I saw leaving the city who disappeared into the crowd with Kuzco on the back of his cart. He must have taken him back to his village, so if we find the village, we find him, and if we find him, we find Kuzco,\" he smirked as he put it all together. \"Oh, yeah, it's all comin' together.\" He then came to wake up the girls. \"Yzma! Darla!\" \"What?!\" Darla and Yzma snapped while having face masks on. Kronk yelled out in fear and disgust. \"This had better be good!\" Yzma growled and the cucumbers popped off her glaring eyes. \"Please, let it be good.\" Darla begged. \"I know how we can find Kuzco and the others.\" Kronk informed as he hugged his teddy bear. \"You do?\" Darla asked with a gulp. \"Yes, it's about that peasant at the diner.\" Kronk nodded. \"What peasant at the diner?\" Yzma asked out of suspicion. Darla bit her nails nervously as Kronk explained everything the best that he could. \"Looks like we're going to the village on the hilltop.\" Yzma said. \"What should we do with those others with Kuzco?\" Kronk asked. \"Leave them alone!\" Darla yelped in worry as those others were her family. \"We can leave them alone and let them live, no one's gonna believe them anyway.\" Yzma said. \"Sounds like an early morning to me.\" Kronk said. \"Leave this to me.\" Yzma smirked evilly. \"You got it.\" Darla said. Yzma then told Darla and Kronk her plan and which was telling Pacha's family a lie about being family twice-removed. The next morning, the others were coming to a valley where a bunch of other llamas were. \"Are you sure he's here?\" Kuzco asked the others as they looked for Pacha. \"He should be,\" Patch replied. \"He seems to love animals and whenever someone who loves animals need to talk, they talk with the animals, whether they can understand each other or not.\" \"Let's listen for his voice.\" Atticus said. \"I wonder if this even would taste good...\" Kuzco said as he looked down to the grass and decided to give it a try since he was a llama like the others, but it didn't work out for him, it tasted gross to him and he hated the taste right away. Patch's left ear flew up as he heard a voice in the distance. \"I think I hear Pacha.\" \"Where is he?\" Cherry asked. \"This way.\" Patch told the others as he led the way to the village leader. Pacha was telling some of the other llamas about his journey with Kuzco as a llama, even if they couldn't understand him or he could understand them, but they were fun to talk to, he couldn't bear tell his family right away what had happened. \"Should we interrupt his story?\" Mo asked. \"Let's wait just a minute.\" Patch suggested. \"YEah, he seems to be expecting us.\" Atticus agreed. Pacha finished his story before he hid a small smile to the others who had come to see him as if he was expecting them to show up. \"Hello, Pacha.\" Cherry greeted. \"Hey, Pacha.\" Mo also greeted. Pacha smiled to them. \"Hey, listen, Pacha, you know, what I said to you back at the diner, th-that... I-I didn't really...\" Kuzco uttered out nervously. Pacha put his hand up as he knew that Kuzco had finally had enough and had officially learned his lesson. Why else would the others stay with him? \"So, you tired of being a llama?\" Kuzco sniffled before he broke down crying. \"Yeeees!\" \"Then let's hurry.\" Patch said. They were then on the road, ready to go on their journey, but they had to make a stop first. \"Okay, we're just gonna stop at the house and get some supplies.\" Pacha told the others. \"Then we'll be on our way, right?\" Kuzco asked. \"Right.\" Pacha nodded. \"Hopefully nothing distracting gets in our way.\" Cherry said. \"Hey there, Pacha, you just missed your relatives.\" A man told him. \"My relatives?\" Pacha replied. \"We just sent them up to your house.\" The second man informed. \"Um, what exactly did they look like?\" Atticus asked nervously. \"See, there was this big guy and a little girl with buck teeth and and an older woman who was... Uh, how would you describe her?\" The second villager replied before asking his friend for help. \"Scary beyond all reason.\" The first man replied witha nod. \"Yeah, that's it.\" The second man agreed. \"Oh, no...\" Atticus gulped.[Chapter 9] In Pacha's hut... \"So, remind me again how you're related to Pacha?\" Chicha asked Yzma as she poured the woman some tea. \"Why, I'm his third cousin's brother's wife's step-niece's great-aunt,\" Yzma chuckled nervously before sipping her tea. \"Twice removed.\" \"UH-huh...\" Chicha felt dubious about that. 'Does she think we were born yesterday?' Nina thought to herself. \"Isn't that right, Kronk and Darla?\" Yzma asked her 'sidekicks'. \"99 monkeys jumpin' on the bed!\" Chaca called out as she played jump rope with Tipo, Kronk, and Darla. \"One fell off and bumped his head!\" Kronk chimed in. \"We're kind of busy at the moment.\" Darla told Yzma. \"You know, I am so sorry that you had to come all this way, but as I said to you before, you may recall, Pacha is not here,\" Chicha told Yzma. \"I'll be sure and tell him you came by.\" \"Oh, would you please? That would be just great!\" Yzma replied and purposely let her cup fall on the floor. \"Oops, silly me...\" \"No, no...\" Chicha forced a smile before sighing in exhaustion. \"Allow me.\" \"Let me get that for you, Mom.\" Nina offered. \"No, no, honey, I can get.\" Chicha told her oldest daughter. Yzma ran over to Kronk and played patty cake with him. \"They're hiding something,\" She then said, referring to Pacha's wife and oldest child. \"When I give the word, we search the house.\" \"Okay, but we still have 94 monkeys to go.\" Kronk replied as he jumped with Darla while Chaca and Tipo spun the rope. Yzma growled and then came back over to Chicha. \"So, while we're waiting for Paca-\" \"Pacha!\" Chicha corrected her. \"Oh, yes,\" Yzma replied. \"Perhaps we can have a tour of your lovely home.\" \"You know, why don't you just come back when Pacha gets home?\" Chicha suggested. \"I'm sure he'd love to show you the-\" she then saw her husband out the window and he signaled to her that he wanted to speak with her alone, so she took that as a cue to get away from Yzma as this seemed more important. \"Excuse me, won't you? I think I left something in the oven.\" Nina then went with Chicha as she also saw her father out the window. Yzma soon found that a bit suspicious as she didn't see Pacha. \"This is my variation of double dutch,\" Kronk told the young kids. \"On the signal, we switch places.\" \"Kronk, it's time.\" Yzma told him. \"Okay!\" Kronk replied before he then jumped with the kids as Yzma was stuck dealing with the ropes. In the kitchen, Pacha was telling Chicha and Nina what had happened and about the new friends he made on the way. \"So, we have to get back to the palace, find the lab, and change him back.\" Pacha told Chicha and Nina. \"Hi, there.\" Kuzco smirked as he poked his head in. \" ASSASSIN! \" Nina yelped and hit the llama in the head with a frying pan. \"Uh, Nina, that was him.\" Pacha said with a wince. \"Oops...\" Nina winced herself. \"That's gotta hurt.\" Cherry muttered. \"You know what?\" Tipo asked Yzma as she explored and he skipped rope. \"I don't believe you're really my great-aunt. You're more like my great-great-great-\" \"Go, we'll stall them as long as we can.\" Nina said. \"Thanks, dear, help Mom with your brother and sister.\" Pacha hugged his oldest daughter. \"I'm so sorry for hitting you, Emperor Kuzco.\" Nina cooed to the llama who was now having a painful headache. \"You have a lovely wife,\" Kuzco slurred. \"They're both very pretty...\" Nina soon blushed after hearing that come from Kuzco. \"Great-great-great...\" Tipo continued. \"All right!\" Yzma growled in annoyance. \"Are you quite through?!\" Tipo stopped skipping before pouting. \"Great-great-aunt.\" \"So, where were we?\" Chicha asked Yzma. \"Listen, Sister, we're not leaving until-\" Yzma glared. \"We show you the house,\" Nina came up behind Yzma with a smirk. \"Of course...\" Pacha then led the others out once he was ready to go. \"Was it a good idea to leave your family with those three?\" Kuzco asked. \"Darla is a good girl I'm sure, she'll help stall those two.\" Atticus said. \"You think so?\" Pacha asked. \"I know so, she's my little sister.\" Atticus insisted as Darla was a much better girl since she was raised by his family. And where he was right as Darla was having a blast laughing while Yzma and Kronk were locked in dark room without a door handle. \"What do you mean the door is stuck?\" Chicha smirked. \"Try jiggling the handle!\" \"There is no handle in here!\" Yzma hissed. \"There's not?\" Nina teased. \"Are you sure?\" \"Alright, that's it, tell us where the llama is and where Darla is and we'll burn the house to the ground.\" Yzma threatened the wrong way. \"Uh, don't you mean 'or'?\" Kronk corrected. Yzma sighed in slight insanity. \"Tell us where the llama and Darla are or we'll burn your house to the ground!\" \"Well, which is it?\" Chaca asked. \"This seems like a pretty crucial conjunction.\" \"She's right.\" Darla nodded in agreement. \"That's it!\" Yzma snapped. \"Kronk, break the door down!\" \"Break it down?\" Kronk asked before he began contemplated about the wood of the door. \"Are you kidding? This is hand-carved mahogany...\" \"I don't care, you fool,\" Yzma glared to Kronk. \"Get out of my way. I'll break it down myself.\" she then counted to three. \"Okay, guys, you know what to do.\" Nina told her younger siblings. \"Right, Nina.\" Tipo and Chaca nodded as they went to their stations. Nina then stepped one way with Darla as Chicha opened the door. Yzma soon flew out the door and ended up slipping on the wet floor as Tipo waxed it, came to Chaca as she had a can of tar and Tipo had out a feathery pillow and the woman was now tarred and feathered and there was a rubber glove on her head as she then came into a wheelbarrow and it hit a rock and she took the place of a chicken pinata as a woman was supervising the blindfolded children in front of it and they then began to beat her as Kuzco and the others were going back to the palace. \"Mom, I'm going with Dad and the others to the palace.\" Nina said. \"I'm coming with.\" Darla added. \"Stay safe, sweetie.\" Chicha told her oldest daughter. \"You guys take care of Mom until I get back.\" Nina told Chaca and Tipo. \"You got it, Sis.\" Tipo and Chaca nodded. Nina hugged her little sister and brother and then went after the others. \"Come on, Darla, we got work to do!\" \"Right!\" Darla nodded as she followed after the girl who was almost adult aged. Kronk was then going to try and rescue Yzma. \"That little traitor!\" Yzma hissed as she saw Darla. \"Bye-Bye, you old hag!\" Darla called out to Yzma. Yzma growled to Darla. \" AFTER THEM! \" She then commanded Kronk. Kronk soon got Yzma free before going after the others. The race back to the palace and into the secret lab was now on. Oddly enough though, for the good guys, there were red dots marking their paths while there were blue triangles marking the bad guys' paths. Kronk and Yzma noticed this and wondered about it before shrugging it off as they continued after Kuzco. \"Okay, everyone hurry across this bridge, and me and Kuzco will bite off the rope.\" Patch suggested. \"You got it, pal.\" Atticus smiled. Patch nodded. They all then crossed the bridge and Patch and Kuzco then bit on the ropes to make the bridge fall instantly. Drell hid behind a tree as the others were going and saw that Kronk was about to fly himself and Yzma over the bridgeless gap, he then took out his wand and magicked up a storm cloud to go over the two to strike them and where it did and they fell down. Drell snickered as he did that and then went away as the others came to the palace and now a literal storm was brewing. The others made it to the palace and were now going to the secret lab and Darla led them to the door. \"Okay, why does she even have that lever?\" Kuzco groaned before he smacked away the crocodile. \"Sorry, I meant to tell you guys about that.\" Darla said. \"We are going to have a serious talk about this later.\" Atticus said to Darla before pulling the other lever which put them in a roller-coaster. \"Aw, come on, this is the best part!\" Darla smiled innocently. \"Fine, we'll talk about this later.\" Atticus said. They then went through the ride. Cherry looked rather nauseous from the ride. \"Okay, we found the potions, now we have to find the one for human transformation.\" Nina observed the vials. \"Let's look at the labels.\" Darla said. \"Let's see...\" Cherry looked at some of the vials only to find the human one was missing. \"Lions, tigers, bears-\" \"Oh, my...\" Yzma's voice said and everyone turned to her as she held out the missing vial. \"Looking for this?\" \"What the heck?!\" Patch asked out of surprise. \"No! It can't be!\" Kuzco yelped. \"How did you get back here before us?!\" Yzma was about to answer, but looked puzzled herself. \"Uh, how did we, Kronk?\" \"Well, you got me,\" Kronk shrugged as he pulled down a map to show them falling down a river after the lightning strike. \"By all accounts, it doesn't make sense.\" \"Oh, well, back to business.\" Yzma replied with an evil grin to Kuzco. \"Yzma, why do you want to kill him?\" Atticus asked. \"Okay, I admit it,\" Kuzco added in anxiously. \"Maybe I wasn't as nice as I should have been, but, Yzma, do you really want to kill me? \" \"Just think of it as you're being let go, that your life's going in a different direction, that your body's part of a permanent outplacement.\" Yzma replied with a smirk as she used his words against him to get what she wanted. \"Ooh, she just used your own words against you.\" Darla said. \"Not helping.\" Cherry said. \"She's right, it's kind of like what he said to you when you got fired.\" Kronk agreed. \"I know,\" Yzma droned to him. \"It's called cruel irony; like my dependence on you.\" \"I can't believe this is happening!\" Kuzco frowned. \"Then I bet you weren't expecting THIS!\" Yzma replied as she lifted up her dress. The others recoiled in slight disturbance and disgust. \"Aha!\" Yzma then revealed she had a knife. \"Whew, it's just a dagger.\" Patch sighed. \"Finish them off.\" Yzma told Kronk as she flung the dagger to him and he caught it in his hand. 'His shoulder angel and shoulder devil should be showing up right about now.' Darla thought to herself. As if on cue, the shoulder devil appeared, but the shoulder angel appeared to be running late. \"Hey, you're not backing down now, are ya, big guy?\" Kronk's devil asked. Kronk looked to his other shoulder in confusion. \"Uh, where's the other guy?\" The shoulder angel then appeared, but appeared to be getting his hair done and was in a salon chair, reading a magazine. \"Yo!\" Kronk called out to him. \"Sorry, I'm late,\" Kronk's angel returned to position and put his halo in place. \"What'd I miss?\" \"This should be entertaining.\" Darla said. \"Well, Yzma just tossed me this knife and asked me to, you know, take them out,\" Kronk told his shoulder angel and devil. \"Then this guy popped up and we waited for you, and quite honest-\" Yzma looked to the others in confusion as she couldn't see Kronk's angel and devil while Pacha and Kuzco merely shrugged in response. Atticus and the others simply shrugged as well, even if most of them could see the shoulder angel and shoulder devil. Darla was of course one of them and Patch could've sworn he saw them. \"Kronk! Why did I think you could do this?\" Yzma scolded her henchman. \"This one simple thing. It's like I'm talking to a monkey!\" \"Whoa.\" Kronk's shoulder angel said. \"A really, really big stupid monkey named Kronk!\" Yzma growled. \"Owch.\" Kronk's shoulder devil winced at that. \"And do you know what else?\" Yzma smirked darkly. \"I never liked your spinach puffs! NEVER!\" Kronk soon started to whimper with his shoulder angel comforting him. \"That's hitting a little below the belt...\" Darla winced, she may not had been personally a big fan of spinach like Atticus was, but she was polite enough to try it and sort of like it, though she didn't flat out hate it like Yzma did. \"That's it, she's going down.\" Kronk's shoulder devil glared at Yzma while loading his pitch fork. \"Now, now, remember, guys,\" Kronk's shoulder angel soothed. \"From above, the wicked shall receive their just reward.\" They all then looked up to see a chandelier hanging above Yzma. \"That'll work.\" They all then decided. Kronk used the knife to cut the rope and make the chandelier fall on top of Yzma. Unfortunately, she fit through the center of it. \"Strange, that usually works...\" Kronk pouted. \"And so does this!\" Yzma replied as she then pulled a lever. The lever opened up a trapdoor and it made Kronk fall in with his shoulder angel and devil. Atticus soon snatched the vial from Yzma. \"Hey!\" Yzma glared at him. \"Give me that vial!\" \"Thank you!\" Atticus smirked. \"Now, nothing can go wrong.\" Cherry groaned as that usually cued for something bad to happen and where she was right as he tripped and knocked over the shelf of vials after accidentally letting go of the vial in his hand. \"Nice going, Nancy Boy Fudo.\" She then called Atticus the mocking nickname due to his love of Nancy Drew. \"Sorry.\" Atticus said as he tried to find the right vial. \"Oops, clumsy me...\" Yzma smirked as she bumped a shelf and made more and more potions fall out. \"Which one? Which one?\" The others felt lost because these vials were all unlabeled and scattered across the floor. Yzma then pulled a lever to sound an alarm for the royal guards. \"Better hurry, I'm expecting company.\" \"I can handle the guards.\" Atticus said. \"Ooh! Ooh! I wanna help!\" Patch beamed. \"Kill them!\" Yzma told the guards. \"They've murdered the emperor!\" \"You can help by helping the others with the vials while I handle the guards.\" Atticus said. \"Okay...\" Patch pouted as he then did that. \"No, wait, I'm the emperor, it's me, Kuzco!\" Kuzco cried out as the guards attacked. \"They're not listening to me...\" \"Let's just take all of the vials.\" Mo said. \"Better than nothing.\" Cherry agreed as she took out a bag. They all then dumped the vials in the bag so they would be easier to carry and run away from the guards. However, Cherry tripped and a few of the vials slipped out and they ended up on the guards which changed them all into different animals. \"Get them!\" Yzma told the guards. Atticus was ready to fight off the guards. \"Hey, I've been turned into a cow,\" one guard said to Yzma. \"Can I go home?\" \"You're excused,\" Yzma told him as he then smiled and walked away. \"Anyone else?\" \"No, we're good.\" the others replied. \"GET THEM!\" Yzma then commanded. \"You'll have to get past me.\" Atticus said. THe guards glared, showing they weren't afraid and Atticus glared right back. \"Here, try this one.\" Pacha gave one potion to Kuzco and it turned him into a turtle. \"Uh, guys, a little help?\" Kuzco asked as he slowly walked. Patch helped Kuzco onto his back and carried him so they could keep running since Kuzco was now slow. \"Oh, please be something with wings.\" Darla begged as she took out another potion and gave it to Kuzco. Kuzco was soon changed into a red parrot. \"Yay! We're flying!\" Kuzco cheered before he saw he was just a small bird. \"Uh-oh...\" \"Um, how about-\" Mo was about to pick the next potion. \"We're not getting anywhere with you picking the vials,\" Kuzco glared to the others. \"I'm picking the next one!\" \"Fine by me!\" Pacha replied. \"Which one next?\" Mo asked Kuzco. \"This one!\" Kuzco took the next vial and drank it, only to turn into a big whale and he then glared to the others as he felt dumb now. \"Don't any of you say a word.\" \"What about screaming?\" Nina asked. The floor then began to crack and it gave away as they all then fell. \"Quick, drain the canals!\" Yzma commanded. She soon saw all of the guards were knocked out by Atticus. She then groaned as she saw she had to deal with this herself. \"Wait up, guys!\" Atticus ran over, then stopped dead in his tracks as they were all going in the water. \"Ooh...\" he then took a deep breath in and out and then jumped into the water after them and where he soon became his merman form. \"I love swimming...\" Atticus smiled to himself. \"I remember when you used to have nightmares about drowning.\" Cherry teased. \"That was when I was a kid.\" Atticus said. \"Kuzco?\" Mo called out. Kuzco came up to the surface and then cheered. \"Yay, I'm a llama again!\" he then looked to his hooves and realized that. \"Wait...\" They all soon heard something open. \"What was that?\" Patch asked in worry. \"I think we're flooding out of the palace.\" Mo replied. They all fell down through the floor. Yzma followed after them. \"Okay, there's two potions left, it has to be one of these.\" Cherry took out two different bottles. \"But which one?\" Nina asked. Yzma jumped in and took one of the potions which worried everyone. There was a deep and dark demonic laugh at first, but Yzma was actually turned into a cute and adorable kitten and let out a very small and quiet mew. \"I'll take that.\" Kuzco smirked and took the human potion away from her. \"This is the one alright.\" Nina smiled. \"This is the one, Kuzco,\" Patch added. \"This one will turn you back into a human.\" Kuzco was about to drink the potion only to get attacked by Yzma. Atticus soon took Yzma away from his face. Yzma hissed and her claws spun around violently. \"She's kinda cute, I guess...\" Cherry flinched from that. Atticus didn't seem to be phased by the scratches before he let her fall to her doom. The potion seemed to be with her. \"AUGH!\" Atticus yelped and then jumped down after the potion. Once he got to her, he took the potion from her and teleported back to the others with the potion. Yzma was still falling, but she had luckily for her, landed on a trampoline and was soon coming right back up and banged her head against a roof and when she came down, a door opened up on her, flattening her like a pancake and Kronk had come out, revealing that the trapdoor somehow led him there. \"Here you go, Kuzco.\" Atticus said as he gave him the vial. \"Well... See ya, on the other side.\" Kuzco said to the others before he drank the potion and was finally a human again.[Chapter 10] 'Wow, he's even cute as a human.' Nina thought to herself. \"Well, I got some work to do.\" Kuzco said. \"Such as?\" Pacha asked. \"I-I have to say sorry to someone...\" Kuzco said. \"A lot of people actually... Could you guys get me back in the palace and clear up that I'm not really dead?\" \"Sure, Kuzco.\" Patch smiled. They all soon got into the palace. Things were going to change for sure in the empire. \"I guess I better get back home.\" Nina said to her father. \"Yes, you should.\" Pacha said. \"All right, I'll see you back there.\" Nina replied. \"Thank you, honey.\" Pacha smiled to his oldest. Nina smiled back and then went back to the village. \"That should do it.\" Drell said. \"So, what's gonna happen to Kuzco's pool?\" Patch asked. \"Oh, he's still gonna use it... As a bird bath.\" Drell told the others. \"That's nice.\" Mo smiled. \"Yep, things are gonna change around here, though technically can't be emperor until he graduates anyway, but that's a story for another day...\" Drell said. \"Graduates?\" The others asked. \"Surely you guys have heard about Kuzco Academy...\" Drell said like it was obvious, though they didn't seem to even know that there was a school in the village. \"No, we haven't.\" Atticus said. Drell groaned and sighed. \"Oh, well, at least Kuzco is taken care of for now and he's going to move into the village.\" \"Yeah.\" Patch nodded. \"I suppose you're all ready to go home then, hey, where's Darla?\" Drell noticed someone was missing. The others looked to see Darla was not there and then looked around. Kronk was now a Junior Chipmunk camp counselor with Bucky the Squirrel as his helper and he had several kids in his troop, including Darla who would become an honorary member even if she could already talk to and understand animals. \"There she is.\" Mo said. Darla was in a uniform and held up an acorn to complete the Junior Chipmunk pledge with the other kids, including Yzma who was still a kitten and was forced to participate. \"Uh, Darla, it's time to go home.\" Atticus said. \"Aww...\" Darla and the other Junior Chipmunks pouted. \"You can keep the uniform,\" Kronk told her. \"It looks great on you.\" \"Yeah, it really does.\" Bucky agreed. \"Aw! Thank you!\" Darla beamed. \"And we promise to visit you all from time to time.\" Patch said. \"Much appreciated, right, Yzma?\" Kronk smiled. \"Right...\" Yzma growled as she was stuck as a kitten. The others waved as their new friends went to leave the village as their adventure was over. They soon went back in the Fudo house. \"Still afraid of storms?\" Patch asked Darla. \"A little bit...\" Darla smiled sheepishly. \"I guess you think I'm a baby...\" \"No, you'll learn better...\" Atticus soothed. \"I used to be afraid of storms too!\" \"You still are.\" Cherry replied. \"You'll need to be trained by Goku.\" Drell said. \"Who?\" Atticus asked. \"Come on, let's go into my office.\" Drell said as he then pushed them upstairs. \"Do I need to hear this too?\" Cherry asked. \"Yes, because Atticus is your best friend, you might be happy for him,\" Drell insisted. \"Oh, by the way, Darla? You have a letter from Serena.\" \"Yay!\" Darla smiled. Drell then took Cherry and Atticus upstairs as Darla opened her letter from Serena, but it wasn't just from her, it was from the other Sailor Scouts and they really missed her and hoped she would come visit again soon after their first adventure together and where they would one day. Cherry and Atticus sat in Drell's office. \"Now, tell me, do either of you know what a Sayian is?\" Drell prompted. \"Uh...No.\" Atticus and Cherry said. Drell face-palmed. \"What are they teaching you at that school?!\" he then took a deep breath and relaxed. \"Okay, so anyway... A Sayian is an endangered race of extraterrestrials, they are a rather aggressive warrior race who often tried to be the strongest in the universe, and they come from the Planet Sadla.\" \"What does that have to do with Goku?\" Atticus asked. \"He is one of them.\" Drell replied. \"Ohh,\" Atticus smiled. \"Is he super strong?\" \"Very strong...\" Drell replied. \"In fact, when I first met him in younger years, he seemed like someone you'd hit it off with...\" \"Awesome, I can't wait to meet him.\" Atticus smiled. \"I can teleport you to where he is.\" Drell smiled back. \"Wahoo!\" Atticus cheered. Cherry slowly clapped with a straight face to show her appreciation and gratitude for Atticus. \"Now if I remember correctly, he's staying with his family which would be a few miles away from Satan City.\" Drell said. \"For a second there, it sounded like you said 'Satan City'.\" Cherry spoke up. \"I did and no, it's not named after the devil, it's named after a man who's lied to the city and everyone else telling them that he was the one that saved them all from Cell and Bu who were both powerful beings.\" Drell said. \"Oh...\" Cherry said with slightly wide eyes. \"Now, don't worry, Bu is back, but he's good, anyway, Atticus, I'll have Goku informed of your arrival.\" Drell said. \"Alright, but do I have time to pack and tell my parents and Mo?\" Atticus asked. Drell soon snapped his fingers and two luggage suit cases soon appeared. \"Okay, does he have time to tell his parents and Mo?\" Cherry then asked in slight deadpan. \"Fine, but make it quick.\" Drell said before teleporting Patrick, Emily, and Mo into his office along with Patch. Atticus then went to say goodbye to everyone. \"Well, I guess I'll go home and do nothing while Atticus is gone.\" Cherry smirked. \"Yep, because Atticus has to do this alone.\" Drell said. \"Of course he does...\" Cherry replied. \"I never get a solo mission.\" After saying his goodbyes to his parents and pet and girlfriend Atticus went and picked up his luggage to see someone appear next to Drell while he had two fingers on his forehead as did the man that appeared. Patch whimpered slightly, but Patrick and Emily comforted him. \"Welcome back.\" Drell smiled to Atticus. \"I'm ready.\" Atticus said before noticing the man next to Drell. The man had spikey black hair and was wearing an orange/red/golden gi over a dark blue short-sleeved undershirt along with dark blue wristbands, along with dark blue boots with a yellow border that are outfitted with red laces and looked really strong. \"He's ready.\" Drell told him. \"First, let me see what I'm working with.\" The black spikey-haired man said. \"Alright, Atticus punch him.\" Drell said. \"Um, okay.\" Atticus said before punching the black spikey-haired man who just blocked his punch with one finger and where it worked. Drell stepped back. \"Cherry, you might wanna leave now before you end up in the hospital.\" Cherry ducked out of the way. After about a while ,Atticus soon got exhausted while the black spikey-haired man wasn't tired at all. \"Looks like I've got my work cut out for me to whip this kid into shape.\" The black spikey-haired man said. \"Who is this guy, Drell?\" Atticus asked him while panting. \"Atticus, this is Goku.\" Drell introduced. \"Nice to finally meet you, Goku.\" Atticus said, extending his right hand to him still exhausted. \"Nice to meet you too.\" Goku said, shaking his hand, squeezing it slightly. \"Whoa, that's quite an iron grip you got there.\" Atticus said as he felt how strong Goku was by his squeeze. \"Maybe you should take some tips from me.\" Goku smirked teasingly. \"Yeah, maybe.\" Atticus groaned as he could feel a bit pain. \"I didn't mean to do that, I guess I'm stronger than I thought.\" Goku said. \"Anyway, good luck.\" Drell said. \"Atticus, grab your bags and grab my shoulder because I'm about to instant transmit us to my house.\" Goku said. \"Yes, sir.\" Atticus said as he grabbed his luggage and then grabbed Goku's shoulder. \"I'll be watching you on the other side.\" Drell told Goku and Atticus. Goku soon instant transmitted themselves to where he and his family lived. Drell removed his glasses as he wiped his eye and smiled proudly as Atticus went off to even bigger and better things. \"Where did they go?\" Patch asked. \"To Goku's home.\" Drell said. Patch whimpered as he was really going to miss Atticus. \"Hey, come on, he's not gone forever...\" Drell told the puppy. \"I mean, you've done adventures without him, especially with the Air Buddies.\" \"True.\" Patch nodded. Meanwhile with Atticus and Goku... Goku and Atticus along with his luggage soon arrived at a house that was circular that seemed to be miles from a city. \"Ready to move your stuff in?\" Goku asked as the sun was setting. \"Yes, please,\" Atticus smiled. \"Um, you got a space for me?\" \"Yes I do, and I'm sure Chichi won't mind another mouth to feed.\" Goku said. \"Is Chichi your wife or something?\" Atticus asked since he had just met Goku. \"Chichi is my wife and you'll soon meet her and my sons, Gohan and Goten.\" Goku said as he helped him with his luggage before going to the house. Atticus smiled as he got settled in. He soon met Chichi, Gohan, and Goten, who were all happy to let him stay with them while he trained under Goku's wing while also going to school with Gohan so it would be fair for both parents. Atticus knew he was going to be homesick, but he had to tell himself that it would be all okay and it would be over soon and he would be home again. He took out a picture of the family together and soon hugged it with a small sigh and he even opened a photo album that he had of the times with Cherry and there was even a picture that Cherry kept hidden away from everyone, but it was in the album just for him: It was the picture of when they were adopted by Cinderella's father. Chichi was a tough woman with long straight black hair, a moderately curvaceous figure and a lighter skin color. Gohan had black hair and black eyes he had his father's facial features, and also had his mother's light peach complexion rather than his father's light tan. He was also quite muscularly developed for his age. Goten had looked just like Goku as a kid along with messy unkempt hair and playful face he also wore a gi to Goku's, minus the kame symbol along with a dark blue long-sleeved undershirt and black training shoes with dark blue shin guard. \"I hope you don't mind him staying...\" Goku told his family about Atticus. \"Oh, of course not, besides, this won't be forever.\" Chichi said, trying not to sound mean. \"It'll be great to train with you and Atticus, Dad.\" Gohan said. \"We'll see about that, buddy.\" Goku chuckled. \"He looks pretty cool.\" Goten smiled. Atticus soon came out to the family. \"You settled in?\" Goku asked him. \"I guess so...\" Atticus said softly. \"I just can't believe I'm getting this homesick, I've been gone from home before.\" \"Have you been away from home in a different dimension?\" Goten asked. \"No, and I guess that's why I'm feeling homesick.\" Atticus said. \"It'll be okay,\" Goku soothed. \"Chichi, why don't you make something special for dinner?\" \"What would you like?\" Chichi smiled to Atticus since he was their guest. \"Steak and broccoli, please.\" Atticus said. \"You like broccoli? Yuck.\" Goten said, sticking his tongue out since he was a kid. Chichi patted Atticus on the head and went to fill out his request. \"Hey, broccoli is awesome!\" Atticus glared to Goten. \"I guess teenagers and grown-ups like eating their vegetables.\" Goten shrugged. Atticus shrugged back as he hoped he could get used to this for his next adventure, but that was a story for another time. The End ","Summary":" It was a rainy night at the Fudo house. Cherry and Mo came over to help Atticus watch over Darla as"},{"Movie":"Dolphin Tale","Title":"A Happy, Mabye, Return","Author":"legend fanatic","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11042439","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I do not own Dolphin Tale or any of the characters (except the ones I come up with). Sawyer I just spent an amazing three months over seas. I had a blast and now I get to go home to Winter and Hope. And Hazel. While I've been gone we texted each other every day. I didn't know how much I would miss her until she wasn't there anymore. I'm just happy to be home, well technically on my way home. After a long, and I mean like three hour long argument over phone, me and my came to an agreement that I would go straight home and then go over to Clearwater together. As soon as the car pulls up to the house and stops I jump out. \"Mom!\" I cry out. \"I'm home!\" She runs to me. \"An hour late. But here just the same.\" I look up at her. \"Can we go to the aquarium now? I'm dying, maybe literally, to see Winter and Hope and Hazel and Dr. Clay and…\" She laughs at me cutting me off. \"Of course. I know how exited you are to clean out the fish tanks, or was it scrub the pools? Oh wait I remember it was to see Hazel!\" I stare at her. Since when did my mom start teasing me about girls especially Hazel? \"Were just friends!\" She gives me a grin that says, ya right sure! \"Get in the car I'm sure everyone is dying to see you especially a certain someone.\" I give her a disgusted look but climb into the car anyways. We start down the road. \"Sawyer, put your seat belt on right! I just got you back and I will not have you die in a car accident!\" I look over at her. \"Nice image Mom! And it rubs!\" she laughs. \"I don't care that it rubs. Put it on right.\" We pull up to Clearwater and I leap out of the car rushing for the back entrance. I don't even have to pull out my keys cuz surprise surprise hazel forgot to lock it. I rush immediately to the dolphins. \"Hey there!\" Hazel yells excitedly behind me. Startling me so much I fall into the dolphin pool. Nice return home present. She reaches out her hand while laughing to help me out and I pull her in which sparks a splash fight that at the end of we call a truce to. \"I missed you,\" I say to her and then, surprising her and maybe even more myself I lean in and kiss her. Sorry for the cliffy. I promise to update as often as possible! Any suggestions pls let me know![Chapter 2] Hazel I don't know what surprised me more. That Sawyer kissed me or that I wanted him to do it again. Don't get me wrong I've had a crush on Sawyer every since I saw Susie flirting with him and I realized I was jealous about it. Just as quickly as the kiss started it ended and I must have looked pretty shocked because Sawyer looked down and mumbled sorry. That's when I realized Id been in a state of shock so I hadn't kissed him back! Now he probably thinks I don't like him the way he likes me! \"Hazel! Sawyer will be here any minute; it's time to set up for his surprise party!\" Sawyer laughs. I guess my dad saved me without knowing it, and destroyed the surprise. Little did he know Sawyers already here! \"I'm guessing Dr. Clay doesn't know I snuck in through the back door.\" I look up for the first time since the kiss and chuckle. \"Let's go tell him you're here. I feel bad; he's been planning this for a month.\" Winter nudges me slightly. \"Dad, I'm coming! Went for a little swim.\" I yell back. \"Involuntarily.\" I mutter and Sawyer laughs again our kiss forgotten. We get out and dry off. \"Hey we were supposed to surprise you and now you surprise us! Lets trick, I'll start talking to him and you come up behind him and just start talking to him.\" I walk out into the open. \"Dad what do you think about having the party by Winter and Hopes pool. That's the first place Sawyer will go to.\" Phoebe and Cat try to stop a laugh as Sawyer walks behind dad. \"Wow nice party you set up for me Clay! Thanks.\" My dad doesn't catch on to what's happening right away. \"You're welcome Sawyer. Sawyer! What are you doing here?\" I smirk. \"He came from the back, Dad. I caught him by Winter and Hopes pool.\" He laughs. \"Ya, and your daughter here Mr. Clay scared me so I fell in!\" \"You pulled me in to remember?!\" Dad looks at me. \"Well I guess the surprise is ruined\" he responds. \"Sawyer, I'm leaving I've got to unpack you. I'm leaving your bike for you to ride home. Enjoy your not so surprise party!\" We have fun. We eat ice cream and cake and swim. Then it's time for him to go home. I want to hold him back tell him I do care about him to kiss him and tell him I was just shocked, but I don't. He gets on his bike and starts riding away. Then I see something that makes my heart stop. \"Sawyer, look out!\" I scream. But it's too late. I watch helplessly as a car, driven by a drunken driver hits Sawyer and his bike and drives away. The boy that kissed me and I was too surprised to kiss back lays on the road motionless. Who knows if I will every have a chance to kiss him back to make what I didn't do right. But all I can think right now while my dad calls 911 is, is he dead? If he is will I ever forgive myself for not holing him back to talk to him? If only before he left I tried to talk to him about the kiss or even kissed him he wouldn't have been hit by that car![Chapter 3] Hazel The paramedics come and take him away. As soon as they do my dad rushes me to the car. \"Call Lorraine! Tell her what happened!\" Dad yells and starts the car. I dial Sawyers mom. She doesn't answer. \"Lorraine, its Hazel! There's been an accident. Sawyer was hit by a car.\" I barely choke out. \"We are going to the Hospital that you work at.\" I hang up and start to cry. \"Sweetheart, I'm sure Sawyer will be fine.\" But there is a doubt in his words. It's too unpredictable to tell if he really will be fine. We pull up to the Hospital and dad and I rush in. \"Who are you here to see?\" The receptionist asks calmly. \"Sawyer Nelson. He was just brought in by ambulance.\" My dad says which I'm grateful for. If I try to talk I'll end up crying again. \"What are you names?\" I take a long look at my dad. He looks ready to cry. \"I'm Hazel Haskett and this is my dad Clay Haskett. Were super close friends of Sawyers.\" She looks apologetic. \"I'm sorry but no one is allowed to see Mr. Nelson. I'm sorry. But you can wait in the waiting are over there.\" We walk over to the waiting room that's uncomfortable and empty and all the sudden Lorraine runs in. She talks to the receptionist who I guess tells her the same thing because she walks briskly over to us. \"Lorrain, I am so sorry.\" My dad says standing up and hugging her. I might have made fun of them if not for the situation at the moment. \"Hi Hazel, hi Clay. I came as soon as I got your message. What happened?\" So I explain everything. How he left at around four, how he put on a helmet when he usually is so over confident he doesn't wear one, how the car came out of nowhere. And suddenly I'm crying. Great sobs that make fat tears fall on my face. Lorraine comes closer to me and wraps her arms around me as we cry together. More people arrive. Kyle, Sawyers cousin his Aunt Allis and Uncle Max. Soon the entire waiting room is filled with Sawyers Friends and family. Then a doctor walks in the room. \"Are you all here for Sawyer?\" She asks. \"Well I have some bad news.\"[Chapter 4] Hazel Bad news! I want to scream just tell us already. But the doctor doesn't. Instead he waits. And waits and waits. For what seems like hours he just stands there. \"Mr. Nelson is in a coma. He will survive but we have no idea if he will ever wake up. We would encourage those closest to him to go see him.\" Lorraine stands up and so does Kyle, Allis and Max. Lorraine comes over to me and my dad and asks us to come to. Even though everything is a blur I get up and walk back to the room with them. People take turns talking to Sawyer they walk in and out until there is no one left but me. I can't speak though. I can't tell him anything because how can I? How can I even look at him? It's all my fault he's here! On the way back to the aquarium I keep silent. I think of feeding the dolphins and the turtles when we get back. I think of Michelle the new turtle that I named after a character in Full House. Sawyer would make fun of me for watch TV out of this century. Oh there I go again thinking about Sawyer. Everything makes me think of him. The dolphins the turtles. Even just being at the aquarium puts me in a bad mood now. But I have chores that need to get done. Even Winter and Hope aren't acting normal. It's like all the animals can sense something's wrong. And it's all my fault. Sorry it took so long to update. School is hectic. Another update is on its way though![Chapter 5] Hazel I wake with a start. What woke me up? My phone, ringing, its Sawyer. That's what my phone says but that's impossible he's in a coma. \"Hello, oh hi Lorraine.\" She's crying. \"Hazel, something's happened. Sawyers going fast. The doctors said to come to the hospital and I want you and your dad there with me.\" I hang up the phone. My dads already up and dressed. He says he got a call earlier from Lorraine. Nothing seems to make sense. Suddenly I'm in the car with my dad. How did I get here? I can't seem to get my mind around anything right now. How can he be dying? I never got the chance to tell him I love him or kiss him back. Now he might be gone at any moment. We pull up to the hospital. The sun is just starting to rise over the horizon and it's surprisingly beautiful. Sometimes when me and Sawyer are on night watch we wake up early and watch the sunrise together. Suddenly I'm crying. Hot tears streak down my face as we walk in. My dad talks to the receptionists and she leads us to Sawyers room. He's pale and looks worse then the last time I was here. I hear the doctor talking to Lorraine. \"His heart started to slow down… we believe there was lung damage we did not detect… his lungs are failing which is causing his heart to fail… unless he wakes up we cant do anything more then we are…he will die by noon.\" The tears come fast. I'm going to lose him. The boy who risked his own life to save the dolphin on the beach. I sit down next to his bed and start talking. \"I'm so sorry Sawyer. I keep thinking that I could have done something to save you. Stopped you before you left to talk to you about the kiss. I like you Sawyer, and not just as a friend. I guess I knew when I saw Susie flirting with you but never made myself realize it until you kissed me. I was so shocked I couldn't react. We moved on from it and now it's too late. I'm sorry Sawyer for everything.\" I brush his hair with my hand and hold his hand with my other one. \"I love you Sawyer.\" I lean down and brush his lips with my own. Then I feel something squeeze my hand and when I open my eyes I see Sawyers blue one's staring back at me and a smile on his face. But he's still dying. One of my tears lands on his cheek. The doctors race him out of the room. Trying to save him. But as they leave I see a flash of the heart monitor. A strait line. Sorry for the late update. I took a family trip and there was no WiFi! I hope the medical terms are okay but they might be wrong. Oh and the strait line means he's dead. Don't worry the next update will be happier. I'm up to suggestions on what to do! Please comment It gives me something interesting to do![Chapter 6] Hazel They tell us to the waiting room but what's the point? I tell Lorraine and my dad what I saw and we cry together. But we wait. Hope for good news. We stay there in the waiting room for hours when finally the doctor comes out. \"Well we got him stabilized.\" I gasp. \"But the heart monitor... it was a straight line.\" The doctor looks at me for a minute before replying. \"We unplugged the heart monitor to transport him better. That's what you must have seen.\" I breathe a sigh of relief. He's alive. \"He wants to see you.\" The doctor leads us back to his room and I stay in the corner as his Mom and my dad talk to him but I stay in the corner. He's sitting up and looks better. Finally I walk over to sit next to his bed. He looks over at me and takes my hand lacing his fingers with mine. Our parents leave and my eyes start to water. One tear falls onto my cheek. He takes a finger and brushes it away. \"Did you hear what I said earlier?\" He rubs the back of my hand. \"Did you mean what you said?\" I nod my head and he smiles. We talk for a little longer about the aquarium and the animals. \"It's not your fault. I know you blame yourself but it wasn't your fault okay?\" I nod my head. \"I better get going. See you tomorrow.\" He squeezes my hand then lets go. \"Hazel.\" He says before I'm out the door. \"I love you.\" I smile. \"I love you to.\" As Dad drives back to the aquarium he's silent but I know he's dying to ask me something. And I know what or who it's about. Finally we pull in to the parking lot. He turns of the truck but does not unlock the door. \"So you and Sawyer?\" I decide not to admit anything so I ask a question back. \"So you and Lorraine?\" He gives an exasperated sigh. \"There is nothing between me and Lorraine.\" I give a umhm but leave it there. \"So what is going on with you and Sawyer?\" He turns to me and I know I can't keep it from him. \"The day he came back from his sea trip he surprised me and I fell into the dolphin pool. I pulled him in and when we got out he kissed me. I finally realized my feelings for him but I didn't have time to tell him before we went on like normal. Then he got hit by that car.\" He doesn't saying anything for a moment and I know what's coming. A fatherly talk about going slow and being wise. \"I'm happy for you\" What, I take that back guess no lecture. \"You and Sawyer are both vary mature kids and I think you two work well together.\" I smile. Then I have a thought and my happy smile turns into a smirk. \"Soooooo, what is going on between you and Lorraine?\" Sorry for the late update. School is really getting me down. And did you really think I would let Sawyer die?! I PROMISE to write in Sawyers point of view next![Chapter 7] Sawyer Being in the coma felt weird. Like I could hear everyone and feel the things around me but I couldn't see or react in any way. Then when Hazel said what she did… Well let's just say it brightened my world a little. Then she kissed me and my heavy eyelids started to open and I could see her. The tears that stream down her face make me want to cry. She's so beautiful. I can't believe she would love me. Would cry over me. Then I talked to her after the doctors stabilized me. She really meant what she said. \"Sawyer, we did some more tests and you should be able to go home tonight.\" Then the doctor leaves and I'm all on my own while he tells my mom the news. I'm left to my thoughts. What will happen when I get home? Obviously I won't be riding my bike until I heal more. But what about work? Will I be able to go see Winter and Hope? And Hazel. I hope to take her on our first date when I get out. My phone buzzes next to me. I hadn't realized it was there. Hey. You doing ok?-Hazel. It's nice to know she's concerned about me. Ya. Doctor said I could leave tonight. I reply. That's amazing especially after what just happened –Hazel. We text back and forth for a while and then I start feeling tiered. Hey I'm gonna get some rest before I leave meet me at my house at 5. Please say you'll come. I think over and over and over in my head. Ok see you the. Love you. I will never get tiered of her saying that. Love you to 3 I put my phone away and lay down. Nothing could ruin this day now. I almost died but everything is going to be okay. I didn't know how wrong I was. I just want to make something clear cuz it's a little confusing. This is a Hazel/Sawyer AND Clay/Lorraine ship. Since Hazel and Sawyer are not related even if their parents are together it can still work between them.[Chapter 8] Sawyer The doctors say I can leave at four but if anything seems out of the order I have to come in immediately. Something does feel wrong but it's not with my health. Like that black SUV outside my window. In fact the car seems familiar… somehow… in some way. Oh well. I've got other things to worry about, like my first date with Hazel. In an hour and a half actually. I still have no clue what I'm going to do for her. Definitely not something cheesy and romantic. That's not Hazel, she wouldn't like it. But Hazel would like a movie, like the newest Disney wilderness movie. She said that she has been wanting to see it and tonight is the opening night. She'll enjoy it. But what do I do about dinner. \"Hey sweetie\" Says mom walking over. \"So there's this girl that I'm taking on a date tonight and I was wondering were should I take her for dinner before the movie.\" She gives me a knowing look and sits on my bed. \"Is this a girl I know? Never mind it's Hazel you're taking. I just happen to know her favorite place is DQ. Have a good time.\" She pulls out a 50 dollar bill and hands it to me. \"I'm going out tonight to. Once you leave of course. Are you sure you are going to be fine on your own?\" An eye roll from me follows her question. Of course I'll be fine, and if I faint or something Hazel will be there but all I tell my mom is ok. \"So...\" I question., \"You and Clay huh?\" She playfully slaps my arm and I know I'm correct. This is weird. I'm dating my moms boyfriends daughter and my best friend all in one! This ought to be interesting! I hear the car pull up and know that Clay has come for mom and me and Hazel will walk to the DQ a block away. I'm a bundle of nerves and I don't know why. Hazel and I are friends I should be cool but I'm not and I think its due to the fact that Hazel's wearing skinny jeans that aren't really tight and most girls wouldn't even call them skinny jeans but I've never seen Hazel wear something like that and a loose and flowing tank top. She's stunning. And suddenly I can't think. My minds muddles and my hands are sweating. I open up the door and Clay walks in first. Then Hazel. \"Hi Hazel. You look nice.\" She smiles at me. \"Thanks, you to Sawyer.\" Her smile is radiant and bright. We start walking towards DQ. I reach over and hold Hazels hand and she gives it a slight squeeze. \"So does the injury still hurt.\" I mull it over in my head for a second. \"A little. But having you here helps a little. I never told you this and I think you already know but you've always helped me through whatever. Even when I only had friend feelings for you, you would help me so much. Like the times when I was doing poorly in school you helped me study. When I was down about my father leaving you picked me out of that sadness. No matter what happens with this relationship I want our friendship to come first.\" She puts her head on my shoulder. \"Aww how sweet,\" a sarcastic voice shouts. \"To bad you wont stay together long enough to ever have a relationship.\" That's when he comes after me. I know its been awhile. I moved schools and have been trying to catch up on work. Hopefully the next update will be soon. Please review. I love all my readers soooo much. Keep reading![Chapter 9] Hazel A dozen emotions play across Sawyers face. Starting with confusion, shock, disbelief, and ending with longing. Its obvious Sawyer knows who this person is but before I have the chance to ask he grabs my hand and starts running. I look back and notice the guy is chasing after us. We come to Sawyers house and he unlocks the door, we go in and immediately Sawyer locks it back up. The guy passes by the door but keeps walking. Sawyer looks scared and he's hyperventilating. \"Sawyer, who was that?\" He looks up at me and regains his cool. But he's still scared. Whoever it was must have been horrible. \"That was a guy named Robert. Me and my mom came here when I was little to try and get away from him.\" He shakes his head in disbelief. He puts his hand to his mouth and his eyes grow wide. \"Oh…no.\" I give him a 'what is going through your head look.' \"He's the one that hit me. It wasn't an accident. Why would he do that?\" Tears start to stream down his face. \"If you and your mom were running from him then isn't he a bad person. Why would it shock you that he tried to kill you?\" He looks about ready to faint. \"I…I just…wasn't…expecting him…to do something like that. I always thought that no matter what he still loved me, that he would never hurt me.\" I just look at him with sympathy and kind of like he's crazy. \"You probably think I'm insane. It's just we were so close and then… then.\" I look at him. \"Who is he?\" He bites on his lower lip a habit he has when he's nervous. \"The person who tr…tried to kill me. That… that's my… my dad.\" Hey sorry for the cliffy. I'm making a Wattpad account finally. These stories on fanfiction will stay and be updated but Wattpad will have the same stories just updated more often because it's easier to update cuz I can do it on the phone or tablet.

She doesn't believe me. I don't believe me either. \"Your dad? You can't be serious. That's nuts. Why would your dad try to kill you? Sawyer get real.\" I shake my head at her and pull her towards my room. She looks at me, confusion the dominate emotion on her face. I check through my window just to make sure he didn't sneak around back to get in. \"I know it sounds crazy. All I know is that things were fine until one day I came home from school and my dad tried to cut my throat. We ran, me and my mom, and ended up here.\" Hazels shaking her head but has seemed to get over the initial shock of the information. \"I don't know what to do. Sorry for the date gone wrong.\" Hazel just laughs lightly at me. \"It's fine, I think I'm going to head home now. Maybe we could try again. Maybe this time someone won't try to kill us.\" She heads home and I head off to bed. Trying to think of why my dad want to kill me. Short chapter I know. I've been thinking of stopping this story. I will take any feed back on the idea and if anyone wants to shoot me an idea on how to keep the story alive to me it just seems like its going no where right now and I'm suffering from writers block.[Chapter 12] Important Read Ok I've had to make some decisions. Half of my stories are going on HIATUS because I just don't have time to update ten stories. This was a hard decision BUT the stories that go on HIATUS are NOT over. I will finish them in the time they are on HIATUS and I PROMISE to put out another Authors note when they are again an ongoing thing again. I'm letting the people decide on which stories to put on hold. If you don't want your favorite story to go on hold leave me a review that says so. The five stroies that have the least will be put on hold. Thx for understanding. A side note visit my website if you type Fan-girl-tabulous weebly into google then it should come up. If you want me to read a book or fanfiction and review it on my website then leave me a review.[Chapter 13] What he didn't understand was how that girl could ever love his son. Especially when her life was on the line because of it. But maybe it was a good thing. If his son really cared about the girl that much then he would do anything for her. Which makes her valuable. Extremely valuable. Because whatever happens his son has to go. No matter the cost. Even if it means taking care of the girl first. (Dolphin Tale) He was at her home, the boat. He made sure her dad and grandfather were gone before sneaking up behind her. The chloroform knocked her out enough to drag her to his car. He went back to wait for his son. The reaction when he realized she was missing would be priceless. He wasn't disappointed. When his son arrived he called the girl, her phone ringing on the outside table. He called someone else. \"Hey... ya, do you know where Hazel is? Well she's not here... Her phone is here though... You don't think... Shoot my dad... Clay, I'll call you back.\" He walks away laughing. His son made a bad choice to be in love with that girl. He drives off pleased with himself. He will have his revenge. I know it's short but what did you think. I'll try to update every week but the end of school is close and I have a lot to do. Please comment. I live for feedback! ","Summary":" I do not own Dolphin Tale or any of the characters (except the ones I come up with). Sawyer I just "},{"Movie":"Dolphin Tale","Title":"Dolphin Tale 3","Author":"Brad04268","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10711936","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Dolphin Tale 3 Sawyer had been on a 3 month journey on a sailboat with some of the smartest marine minds in the world. Earlier that year he was personally asked to follow them on the trip. Sawyer had wondered how Winter would be with Hope. He also was worried about his mom being alone, since his dad had abandon him and his mom about 7 years earlier. Sawyer also worried about his best friend Hazel. Hazel and Sawyer met when they rescued Winter, and they have been best friends ever since then. But the day to return home was here. \"Man I'm so glad I'm going home, this trip lasted a long time\" Sawyer said to his new friend Thomas. \"I know right. I'm so glad I have service on my iPhone again\" said Thomas. \"Me too, I gotta call my mom and my cousin Kyle to let them know I'm back in the US\" sawyer replied. \"Hey mom…I'm back in the US…I'll see you tonight…Love you, Bye\" Sawyer said into his phone. Sawyer then received a message on his phone. It read \"Hey bud. I heard your back. I'm at the airport waiting for you, see you in a bit\". It was from Kyle. \"Ok see you in a few\" Sawyer responded. (Sawyer then rides a van with the others to the airport) Kyle waved and got Sawyers attention. Sawyer then ran to him and said Hi. Kyle then asked, \"How was the trip Sawyer?\" \"It was awesome. I got to see so many cool animals, and made a lot of new friends. I'll show you some pictures on the plane\" Sawyer replied. \"Ok. Hold up, what fight do we get on again?\" Kyle asked. \"Uh Delta 737\" Sawyer said. \"Delta Flight 737 to Tampa International is departing in five minutes\" and man said over the intercom. \"OH SHOOT, We gotta run\" Sawyer said. Sawyer and Kyle barely made it on to the plane. On the plane, Sawyer told Kyle all about what they did on the trip, and how fun it was, and even how much he missed being at home, which wasn't a shock for Kyle. \"This is me and my friend Thomas snorkeling with 3 Atlantic Spotted Dolphins, and here is the room me and Thomas stayed in on the ship, and this Rick the Green Sea Turtle that lives on the boat\" Sawyer said to Kyle as he showed him the pictures of the trip to him. Kyle could tell that he really enjoyed this trip. \"So over all, you liked this trip?\" Kyle asked. \"Yes, but I can't wait to be back in Clearwater tonight\" Sawyer replied.[Chapter 2] Chapter 2 Back at CMA the staff along with Sawyer's Mom Loraine, Hazel, and Dr. Clay setup a party. \"Ok everyone, everything has to be just right\" Hazel said to everyone. \"We need to start calling everyone and tell them to start making their way here\" Clay said. \"Sawyer is going to be here in less than 30 minutes\" Loraine said. Everyone was rushing to get everything together. Altogether the group spent over six hundred dollars on decorations, a DJ, fireworks, and even custom lanterns to launch into the sky. After about fifteen minutes, everyone had showed up. The DJ got the fireworks on the roof, and his turn-tables. The trainers reviewed with Winter on what she was supposed to do when Sawyer walked in. And Hazel went around making sure everyone and everything was perfect. \"Sawyer is here, shut it down\" yelled Hazel. Everything went silent at the aquarium. They here'd the door open then a huge SPLASH. Sawyer was soaked. Winter had just splashed Sawyer and made him all wet. Then the lights went on the music started and everyone yelled, \"Welcome Home\". Then Hazel pushed Sawyer in the pool with Winter. \"Hahaha very funny\" he said as he pulled Hazel into the pool. \"Got you back\" Sawyer said. (Sawyer and Hazel went to go get dried off) Then the music went down and a spot light showed on Winter, Clay, Loraine, and Hazel. Hazel then yelled into the mic, \"Welcome back home!\" Winter then made her unforgettable Tweety-Bird noise. Then the music went loud and everyone helped them selves to some drinks and food. Then the DJ whispered to Clay and told him to tell the crowd to move out to the beach and watch the fireworks. When Hazel heard that everyone was moving to the beach, she knew she needed to tell Sawyer how she felt about him. Ever since she met Sawyer, she knew that one day she would like, a lot. The crowd moved out to beach and sat down in the beach chairs with their food. The DJ yelled, \"LETS BLOW THE ROOF OFF THIS PLACE!\" as he lit the fireworks. The gang had bough blue, white , and green fireworks, because they were the colors of the ocean. So far everything was going as planned. The party was in a good state, but then…\"Oh no, it Rufus.\" Rufus was a strange bird. Rufus seem to think he was the ruler that was all powerful at the aquarium. \"Hazel, why did you guys do all of this?\" Sawyer asked. \"Because everyone here considers you part of the family, including me\" replied Hazel. \"Well thank you, this is awesome!\" Sawyer answered. The fireworks ended, but the party still wasn't over yet. The DJ called Sawyer over to the booth. \"You know the blonde?\" he asked. \"Hazel?\" Sawyer replied \"Yeah. She seems to really like you. She said that she is glad that you're back\" The DJ told him. \"Yeah. Well I've known her since we were 11\" Sawyer said. \"If I were you, I would ask her to go somewhere with you\" the DJ said. \"Thats a good idea. I'm sure she would like to go somewhere. Its the least I could do.\" Sawyer said. \"Well, go do that. And by the way, I'm Brad.\" Brad said. \"Thanks Brad.\" Sawyer replied. \"No prob\" the DJ said. \"Head back out to the beach. We gotta light the lanterns\" some body yelled Everyone lit their lanterns and launched them in a certain order to where when they reached the sky, they looked like Winter's Tail. Sawyer loved the party, and was happy to be home![Chapter 3] Chapter 3 Sawyer woke up next morning from a peaceful sleep. He went to kitchen where his mom was, making breakfast. Sawyer turn on the news when he heard, \"Clearwater Marine Aquarium's ow Sawyer Nelson returned from a 3 month journey to sea. They celebrated with a huge party to celebrate his return, but thats not the only good news. CMA is about to undergo a remodel, and you know what that means, another special day. They're calling it, The Rescue Project. The Rescue Project not only supports the animals of the aquarium, but also injured citizens with financial problems and disabilities. We hope to see you there!\" a news reporter said. \"You have missed so much while you were away. Get dressed, we gotta go to the aquarium and help set up!\" Loraine said to her son. Once they arrived Hazel gave them each jobs they needed to accomplish before they opened. Loriane went to help decorate, while Hazel and Sawyer fed the animals and made sure they were comfortable. Hazel thought to her self for minute. \"Should I say something about how I feel or no\". \"Hazel I want to ask you something\" Sawyer asked. \"Yeah?\" Hazel replied. \"Later tonight, do you think we could hangout again like we did when we were 11? Just me, you and Winter?\" Sawyer said. \"Sure\" Hazel answered with a blush. Soon the doors opened and the crowd filled the Aquarium. Kyle walked with the wounded warriors and talked to them and let them meet Winter. Sawyer was in the pool with Winter giving her jumping and swimming commands. Hazel hosted a show with Hope. Loraine and her girls worked in the gift shop. Clay and Reed made sure all was well. After the day had ended they had raised enough money to break ground in 3 days. (Sorry this Chapter is short. 4 and 5 will be much longer)[Chapter 4] Chapter 4 It was 9:00PM the aquarium had a successful day. They received so much money that they had enough to donate to children and citizens in need. Sawyer went home for a bit to get everything he needed together. While Sawyer was at home, Hazel was talking to her friends over FaceTime. \"Hazel, if you really like Sawyer, you need to tell him tonight.\" her friend Rachael said. \"I know but I think is gonna make a move on me\" replied Hazel. \"Well if he doesn't, ask him some questions or straight out tell him.\" Rachael said. \"Ok I will tonight\" said Hazel. \"I got to go, have fun!\" Rachael said. \"Hey Hazel\" said Sawyer. \"Oh hey.\" replied Hazel. \"Sawyer I need to tell you something\" Hazel said. \"Me too\" said Sawyer. \"Ok you first\" said Hazel. \"Ok. Hazel would you go out with me sometime\" Sawyer asked. \"Yes. What I wanted to say is, when you left I really missed you. And Sawyer I really really like you\" Hazel said. \"So is it official, are we really dating\" Sawyer asked. \"I guess\" Hazel said as she gave him a hug. Winter then suddenly jumped in the air as if she knew already. They both jumped into the pool with Winter. They stayed in their for hours swimming until they almost past out. They then got out, dried off, and got in their sleeping bags. Each of them secretly texted their friends and told them that they were dating. It was now about 12am. They both could not sleep, because of all of all of the excitement. So, they talked, and talked, and talked some more. For almost 2 hours. Sawyer then asked Hazel a question. \"how long have you liked me?\" he asked. \"For a while. I knew that one day we would start dating.\" she replied. \"Well, tomorrow I have a special surprise for you.\" Sawyer said. \"Okay\" Hazel replied. The next morning had came. Each of them fully rested, and ready for the day. Sawyer had planned to go with Hazel to the beach, and then out for some ice cream, but it didn't go as planned. Sawyer and Hazel woke up to bright shining sun. Each of them went to change and came back out to feed the animals. \"Dolphins, check. Otters, check. Turtles, check. And Rufus\" Hazel said. \"Check\" Sawyer said as he finished her sentence. \"Come on, we are going down to the beach and hangout.\" Sawyer said. \"Ok. I'll be right back\" Hazel said. After the short walk to the beach, Hazel saw something. \"I see it too Hazel\" Sawyer said as they ran to edge of the waves. \"Oh no. Its another dolphin\" Sawyer said. \"Dad, we have another stranding at the beach. He is a small baby male dolphin.\" Hazel said to her phone. \"Ok me and the trainers are on our way.\" Clay replied. \"He's a male; Really young, like Hope.\" Phoebe said. \"Dad look, another one\" Hazel said. \"It looks like its mom\" Kat said. \"Calling all staff. We have two beached dolphins we need to get back to aquarium fast.\" Clay said to his walkie-talkie. The rest of the crew showed up and help the baby and his mom. \"I guess we'll have to finish this date later Hazel\" Sawyer said.[Chapter 5] Chapter 5 Back at the Aquarium… \"Dad, I don't think Nicholas' Mom is doing so good\" Hazel said. \"Hazel. His mom doesn't have much longer. Nicholas, has a chance. We are going to have to put her down.\" Clay said. \"Oh. Well, Nicholas is really gonna miss her. So am I even thought we just found them\" Hazel said sadly. \"Hazel! How are the dolphins doing?\" Sawyer asked. \"Not so good. His mother is going to have to be euthanized and Nicholas, which is what I named him, won't be able to return to the ocean.\" Hazel said to Sawyer. \"Oh. Well at least Nich has a chance.\" Sawyer replied. \"Thats true\" Hazel said. \"Kids come here\" Clay said. \"Nicholas, might have to go somewhere else.\" \"But dad he has to stay here, He is in a really bad condition.\" Hazel said. \"I know, but where can we put him?\" Clay asked. \"In my pool in my backyard. Its 8ft deep and we can fill it with salt water while the contraction in the rescue pool area is going on\" Sawyer said. \"That's a good idea Sawyer. And me and Sawyer can take care of Nich everyday.\" Hazel said. \"Ok. I'm giving you a big responsibility here.\" Clay said. \"We got this\" both of the teens said. \"Son. Why is there a dolphin in our pool?\" Loraine said. \"I told Dr. Clay we could keep him here for the next 2 weeks, while they work on the pool he will go in.\" Sawyer said to his mom. \"Ok?\" his mom replied. Suddenly the door bell rang. \"Honey, its Hazel.\" his mom yelled. \"Ok, tell her to come meet me in the back\" Sawyer replied. \"Ok\" his mom said. \"Hi Ms. Nelson, how are you?\" Hazel asked. \"Good. Little shocking with a animal in my backyard but still, good\" Loraine said. \"Ms. Nelson, can we talk for a sec\" Hazel asked. \"Sure sweety. Whatcha need.\" Loraine replied. \"Well. Last night me and Sawyer were hanging out with Winter and Hope, when Sawyer, asked me out on a date.\" Hazel said. \"Wow Hazel, thats great.\" Loraine said. \"Yeah. When we went to the each earlier today, we saw these two dolphins. Nich's mom had to be put down.\" Hazel said to Loraine. \"Oh the poor thing. Is he ok\" Loraine asked. \"My dad said he should recover fast. Just some minor burns, no biggie.\" Hazel said. \"Well thats good\" Loraine replied. \"I told your mom about Nich, and, us.\" Hazel said. \"How bad did she freak out\" Sawyer asked. \"Not at all actually.\" Hazel replied. \"Haha. Yeah, she ask me a bunch of questions tonight.\" Sawyer said. \"I'm sure she will.\" Hazel said. \"So, my dad gave me the powder for his burns. Dad said all we need to do is pat it soft but firmly on to Nicholas' back. \"Ok sounds easy.\" Sawyer said. But then he dropped the power all over Nich and some on Hazel. \"Oooopps\"Sawyer said with a worried look as he tried not to laugh. \"Yeah. Not so easy is it.\" Hazel said as she smiled holding backer laugh. Eventually, they got that dang powder crud on Nich. Sawyer and Hazel gave each other a hug as she walked back to the aquarium. \"So, you like having a girlfriend?\" Loraine said with a smirk. \"No these questions mom. Yes I like Hazel a lot, she likes me a lot, we both like the same stuff. Go ahead and say it.\" Sawyer said \"You two are perfect for each other\" Loraine said with a face that made Sawyer almost fall to the ground laughing. \"But that's good that you found someone you like. You'll have to tell Kyle about this too\" Loraine said as she kissed her son good night.[Chapter 6] Chapter 6 It was another day in Clearwater. A very important day. Today was the day that construction was to start. All staff was on duty moving the animals safely to other pools. The dolphin were moved inside to temporary man-made pools. The turtle were moved to tubs. and the otters were moved to larger tubs. Hazel came early to feed and take care of Nicholas. When she finished up, Sawyer was still asleep. Hazel decided that she was gonna scare Sawyer. She went into his room to find him all hunched up in his bed. She went up to him and screamed a loud scream. \"HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP HOLY CRAP. Hazel you freakin almost killed me.\" Sawyer said. \"Sorry sorry sorry. I thought I should give you a wake up call.\" Hazel said laughing. \"And Nich is all fed and he has been covered in his healing powder.\" \"Good. He should hopefully recover fast at this rate. Sawyer soon got dressed, had some breakfast and went to go check on Nich. Then Sawyer went to talk to Hazel. \"Hey, can we go check on Winter. I haven't seen her in about 3 days.\" Sawyer asked. \"Sure, I was planning on it anyways\" Hazel replied. At the aquarium, there was much activity. Many walls had been torn down, and pools were drained. Sawyer and Hazel went over and checked on the dolphins, the turtles and the otters. They went up stairs to find the construction crew destroying the old pools. Hazel spotted the sketch of the new pools an took a picture of them. \"This place is going to look amazing when its done.\" Sawyer said. \"I know. I can't wait\" Hazel replied. Clay saw the teens and walked over to them. \"So, you guys like the plans. I do.\" Dr. Clay said. \"Yup. They look great. Can't believe the contractor is going to finish this so fast.\" Sawyer said. \"Yeah. Well it will be a lot better for each of the animals. They'll have more space to play.\" Clay said. \"Yup. Well we gotta go. We'll come back by and see what else they have done. (Sorry for the short chapter. Chapter 7 is in the making. It will be longer than this one. I may also add a surprise. I need at least 10 Favorites to add the surprise!)[Chapter 7] Chapter 7 Sawyer and Hazel rode their bike down to their local ice cream shop, and grabbed some cones. They went to a bench and sat down. They each got the same ice cream, chocolate vanilla swirl. It was funny how much they had in common. \"I didn't know you liked chocolate vanilla swirl\" Sawyer said. \"Yeah. I didn't know you liked it do\" Hazel said. It began to get colder and colder. It was the middle of November, so it wasn't surprising. Sawyer noticed that Hazel was starting to shiver. \"Hey, you look cold. You want my jacket.\" Sawyer asked. \"S-s-sure\" Hazel said. They had finished their ice cream, and rode their bikes to Sawyers house. They walked over to Nich to see how he was doing. He was staying underwater, so they assumed he was cold as well. Sawyer and Hazel went into the garage. They found a tent with cloth sides. They set it up over the pool and put a heater in the tent, to keep the dolphin warm. They then went inside, and played some games, hung out, and talked. It was about 4:30PM. Hazel said that she need to get back to the aquarium. So as any good boyfriend would do, she rode with her back. When they got back, they noticed that the construction workers had torn down more wall. They also had started construction in the new pull for the dolphins. Since most of the painting and expanding was done in the main area, it was safe for the dolphins and turtles to move back into their pools. The otters however, had to stay in their temporary homes, until their area was finished. Sawyer then hugged Hazel goodbye, and he rode home. It had been another great day, and tomorrow was another big day. It was another big day in Clearwater. Construction carried on. It had seemed like months since CMA looked normal, when it had only been 3 weeks now. Sawyer and Hazel were informed that the aquarium would be finished with the remodels. The aquarium was still going to be under construction because they still were adding on to building. They each new that when the place was finished, it was going to be \"Awesome!\" They both said. Both of them decide that today they needed to stay around the aquarium today. It was still full with workers painting, dry walling, and a bunch of other stuff. Both of them wrote up check lists so they could keep track of what each animal needed. Whether it was food, or a fish shake, or medicine,they made sure it was a done deal. It was now about 6:30PM. Everybody was hungry. So Clay took everybody down to this new place called Sea-Licious. Everybody ordered some fresh fish and shrimp. Surprisingly, they all loved it. Then everyone moved back over the aquarium. Most of the staff had went home, so did the workers. Sawyer and Hazel walked to Sawyer's house. They went over to the pool and checked on Nicholas. He seemed to as happy as normal. They could both tell he was ready to go to his new home! Then the two teens went to sit in the front yard, Sawyer and Hazel could watch the sunset from his yard. They talked some more about the aquarium, Nicholas, and their relationship. When Hazel got a call from her dad to come home, Sawyer and Hazel rode to the house boat. Right before Clay walked out. Sawyer gave Hazel a kiss on her lips. That was both of their first kiss. But then Hazel went in longer. Then Clay walked out and his jaw dropped. Then Hazel ran to the boat, and Sawyer rode home. (So the surprise was just above with Sawyer and Hazel, and Clay finding out about their secret.)[Chapter 8] Chapter 8 \"Hey Hazel, something you want to tell me\", Clay asked the next day. \"Uh no, I don't think so, why?\" Hazel asked. \"Hey, you did no do a good job at hiding your feelings for him. I knew that one day, you would be some one else's. Your almost all grown up\" Clay said. (PAUSE, This is that AWWW moment! LOL) \"Dad I'm not going anywhere, for a while\" Hazel said. \"I'm glad.\" Clay replied. \"Well, I gotta eat, then me and Sawyer have to work a show today. After all it is the Grand Reopening.\" Hazel said. \"Oh right I almost forgot. Wow those 4 months have gone so fast.\" Clay said. \"SAWYER\" Loraine yelled. \"YOU GOTTA GET TO THE AQUARIUM, IT THE GRAND REOPENING.\" Sawyer got up, got dressed, grabbed a chocolate bar an ran out the door yelling, \"BYE MOM!\" Gotta get to the aquarium. He thought to him self. He rode as fast as he could. \"Thank God, you made it.\" Hazel said. \"Yeah sorry, I over slept.\" Sawyer said. \"Welcome everybody.\" Clay said as the crowd went wild. \"I'm so glad you all could make it out here to support CMA today.\" He said. \"Sawyer, will you do the honor?\" Clay asked. Sawyer grabbed the BIG gold scissors and cut the ribbon. The crowd rushed in to see what they had done. Hazel and Sawyer rushed to the platform where Winter and Hope waited in their new pool. Each of the dolphins playing and jumping around. Sawyer whistled to Winter, to come over to the other side of the pool. When Sawyer tried to put on Winter's Tail, she would swim away. It was like all of the sudden, she didn't know who he was. He whistled to her again. This time she listened and let him put it on. Sawyer was also wondering what she was doing. Hazel walked on to the platform. \"How is everybody doing today\" She said as she waved at Winter to jump into the air. \"Well Winter is sure glad you're here. All of us here at CMA are. As all of you may know, our own Sawyer Nelson has returned.\" Hazel said as Sawyer walked out and waved. \"So everybody. Lets get this show on the road\" Sawyer said. \"As many of you know, 4 years ago Hazel and rescued Winter, the dolphin you all know and love that had sadly lost her tail. Well today, she is ready to put on a show.\" Sawyer said as crowd cheered. \"And Hope is also geared up for todays show.\" Hazel replied. Hazel whistled to Hope. Hope then jumped and did a flip in the air. The crowd was filled with excitement. \"We would like to invite one lucky boy or girl to the platform to feed Winter and Hope.\" Sawyer said. Hazel spotted a little red headed girl who had a Winter shirt on. Sawyer pointed to her and Hazel went to the stands to help her down the stairs. The little girl then ran down to the platform where Sawyer was standing. \"And what is your name?\" Sawyer asked. \"My name is Abby, and I'm 8 years old.\" The girl said. \"Everybody say hi to Abby\" Hazel said. Hazel and Sawyer showed Abby how to properly feed the dolphins. Then they shot the water guns at the two dolphins. Hazel then handed Abby a necklace with CMA Logo on it in silver. \"Thank you she said as she gave Hazel a hug and waved to Winter and Hope. The dolphins waved back. The two teens finished up the show. It was now about 5:30,closing time. The staff began to close up shop, when Hazels enemy came, it was Susie. Susie had a crush on Sawyer ever since they started doing marine biology classes. \"Hey Sawyer\" She said. \"Hey Susie, what do you need?\" Sawyer asked. \"Well, I'm having a party tonight, and wanted you to come with me.\" Susie replied. \"I'm sorry but me and Hazel are doing something tonight.\" Sawyer said. \"Oh well\" she said as she walked off. \"Whew that was a close one. When is she gonna get it threw her thick skull.\" Sawyer said to Hazel. \"I know. I never did like her\" Hazel said. \"So what are we doing tonight?\" Hazel asked. \"Just I'll be bye at 8:00 sharp to pick you up.\" He said. \"Ok!\" she said with a blush. Sawyer had planned to take her to have a nice dinner on the beach. It was 7:59, Hazel got a message from Sawyer to come up front. Sawyer got out of silver limo, dressed in a button up shirt and a tie. Hazel walked out in a sparkly dark blue dress. Sawyer had asked Kyle to ask his friend who drove a limo to pick them up. They soon arrived to Coast Diamond, a nice, fancy diner on the beach. (So Clay found out. He doesn't seem to be too upset. And, how will the date Sawyer planned go, find out, in CHAPTER 9!)[Chapter 9] Chapter 9 They two soon showed up at the Coast Diamond. \"Hello Sir, how may I help you\" a employee asked. \"I have a reservation for Nelson\" Sawyer said. \"Um, I'm sorry sir, I don't see Nelson in our book.\" the man replied. \"How could that be. Is their a reservation under Sawyer Nelson\" Sawyer asked. \"Oh here it is, right this way!\" The employee said. Sawyer asked for a table for two on the top floor balcony. A elderly lady came over to the table. \"You two are a cute couple.\" The lady said. \"Thank you\" the two teens replied. \"I hope you two have a great date\" she said. The lady then walked inside and went home. \"Wow, how did she know\" Hazel said. \"I've heard it something old people\" Sawyer replied. they both laughed. Sawyer ordered a steak and corn. Hazel ordered some shimp and corn. They both had a great dinner. When they were done the both were stuffed, but the night wasn't over yet. The restaurant also had a dance floor and a DJ. It just so happened that Brad, the DJ he had met the day he got back was there. \"Hey Sawyer\" He said. \"Hey Brad.\" Sawyer replied. \"So your going out with her now?\" Brad asked. \"Yeah. today was our second date.\" Sawyer said. \"And how did you afford a limo ride, and a meal here. It costs a fortune here.\" Brad asked. \"Its called the power of my cousin.\" Sawyer said. \"Thats some cousin\" Brad replied. Sawyer soon walked over to Hazel and they danced through out the night. It was now about 10:00. \"Ok now were gonna slow it dowwwwn. So ladies and gents. Nows the time!\" Brad said. Hazel and Sawyer soon began dancing slowly. A spot light was then shined on them. Brad got Sawyers attention and shot him a wink. Sawyer and Hazel then looked each other in the eye as the danced to the music. At the end of the song. Sawyer and Hazel kissed and then went home. Sawyer and Hazel thanked Brad for the good music. It was a bright and cool October day. It was Friday, Hazels favorite day of the week. She started everyday by waking up, getting some breakfast and walking over to feed the animals. Cause the animals need food too. Clay was already in the aquarium. When Clay was there early, something wasn't good. \"I need you to call Sawyer and tell him to get over here now\" Clay said to Hazel. Hazel then dialed him up. Hey Sawyer. Hey. My Dad said he needs you to get over here fast. Why Hazel. I don't know yet. But something isn't good. Ok, I'll be over in 5. \"Ok. He said he'll be over shortly\" Hazel said to her dad. 5 minutes. What Hazel was about to here would make here cry. \"Kids listen. Nich, has a tumor on his back.\" Clay said. Hazel began to tear up. \"But how.\" Hazel asked softly. \"The sun got to him. But we might be able to operate.\" Clay said as he showed them the X-rays. \"But the tumor is to close to his blow hole. If it failed he might suffocate.\" Sawyer added on. \"Well, we will host a meeting later today after closing, and have a vote.\" Clay said. The aquarium soon opened and 10AM. It was a very, very busy day. A Navy Destroyer had came in. The ship was carrying soldiers part of the Wounded Warriors Project. Kyle help them soldiers feed and pet Winter. He told them about his story, and how Winter learned to swim again. But today was special. Today Hazel and Sawyer met a little boy, who had lost his leg in a car accident. \"Can I meet Winter\" the little boy asked. \"Sure\" Sawyer replied. Sawyer helped the little boy down to the platform. He called Winter to the surface. Winter came up to the boy. She seemed to speak to him through eye contact. It was like she knew the drama he had gone through. \"Mommy, she is just like me.\" the boy said. Hazel began to tear. It reminded her of a girl that came years ago that had passed away. The aquarium later closed shop. It was decided that Nich would be operated on![Chapter 10] Chapter 10 It was a big day for Nich. Today, Nich was scheduled to have surgery on his back to remove the tumor. The procedure began at 10AM. Nich first had a IV put in to put him asleep for the surgery. Next they numbed him so the could remove the tumor. It was noon when they finished. The surgery was a success. Nich would now live a cancer free life. But, more problems were in the near future. One day when Sawyer was working with Hazel to help feed the animals, when the she devil we all now and hate, (Well at least Hazel!) came up to Sawyer. She twisted his arm back and pushed him into the pool, hitting his head really hard and knocking him out. Hazel then ran to get her dad. The team dived into to rescue Sawyer. Once he was out, he was rushed to the hospital. Sawyer, was in a coma. Soon the new spread and Sawyer's family and friends showed up waiting and waiting in tears. 5 member of the aquarium stayed and held Susie captive until police arrived. The police showed up and the member told them was Susie had done. She was hauled off to solitary. Soon a mid-aged lady named Dr. Leah came out and said that Sawyer was slowing wakening. But something tragic happened. Sawyer had forgotten everything from the past year. He didn't remember the SEA Trip, his relation ship with Hazel, or Hope. Hazel ran off in disbelief. She ran to Sawyers room to see if it was true. Sawyer was now bullying awake and aware of his surroundings. Hazel asked him multiple question about \"them\". But he remembered nothing. This was tragic. (So this is really short. I KNOW. I haven't been able to work on it for a while. I am working on the next chapter and will be posting it tonight, 10/25/14 EST 7:31PM. I hope to post it in an hour or less!)[Chapter 11] Chapter 11 It was weeks after the incident. Hazel still could not believe that something as horrific as this could happen. Sawyer only knew who his mom was. He didn't even remember Winter. When his mom tried to drop him off at the aquarium, he would never get out of the car. It seemed as if only a miracle from God would solve this tragedy. It was New Year's Eve. 2015 was almost here. No one had plans to celebrate at the aquarium. Instead they wondered and wondered what they could do to help Sawyer and Hazel. They were more worried for Hazel. They had never seen her like this…ever. It was about 7:00PM when Hazel decided to ride her bike to Sawyer's house. She thought that just maybe she could make the spark a fire inside of Sawyer's mind once more. She reached his home and Lorraine let her in. She then went into Sawyer's room. \"Who are you…What are you doing in here.\" Sawyer yelled. \"I'm Hazel, your girlfriend. The one that know all about you and your life. The one that you work with at the aquarium.\" Hazel replied. Sawyer did not know a thing she was talking about. She tried and tried, then tried some more, but no luck. At around 8:30 She got her bike when she heard her name. It was Sawyer. \"Hazel\" He called. \"What happened to me? What is today?\" He asked her. She thought she was hearing stuff in her head. Sawyer came over to her and gave her a hug. \"I remember\" Sawyer said. \"I remembered.\"[Chapter 12] Chapter 12 Hazel couldn't believe it. Sawyer could remember Everything all at f the sudden. Just when the world Seemed to be ending, a miracle happened. But just To be sure, she asked him multiple questions like, \"Where was the SEA Trip at, and what day they started dating. \"I know you're gonna think this is crazy. But literally 5 minutes ago, I thought you were never going to remember us or your trip\" Hazel said to him. \"I'm just glad to alive. Any word on what happened to Susie?\" He said as he rubbed his head. \"My dad said she is in solitary for assault on another being.\" Hazel replied.\"The good thing is, she's gone.\" \"Now go get dressed. We have to be at the aquarium at 10\" she ordered. Sawyer quickly got dressed, grabbed a breakfast bar, and hopped on his bike. Once the two arrived, the line were already backed. \"Today's gonna be busy\" Sawyer reported. \"Yup\" Hazel replied. \"Hey sweety, hey Sawyer,\" Clay paused \"Sawyer? What are you doing here. I thought you lost your memory. \"Nope. Well, kinda. But it's back\" He replied. \"Well that's great. I already fed the animals so go ahead and get to where you need to be\" Clay said with a smile. It soon came closing time when Clay called a meeting. \"Nich. His tumor, It back. It must of spread to fast\" Clay said. \"So what do we do\" Phoebe asked. \"Well we have three options. One is to send him to Alabama to have a marine facility with much more time and space to do a procedure on him. Two, is to have them do it here. And three, is to euthanize him.\" Clay said. \"Euthanasia is our last resort correct\" Sawyer asked. \"Sawyer is right, we can't just do that to him\" Hazel said in agreement. \"Yes, that is only if it comes to that point\" Clay said. \"But the cost would make us have to use a loan.\" \"But we have had so much business lately, shouldn't we have plenty of money.\" Hazel asked \"We still need $1000 dollars\" Clay said. \"You know what that means Hazel\" Sawyer said with excitement.[Chapter 13] \"Good morning and welcome to Bay 9 news. New headlines have emerged from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium today; CMA's own Nicholas has bars tumor removed a while back, but recent x-Rays show that it has spread. The aquarium is short by one thousand dollars to send little Nich to the an Institution in Alabama to have a full scan and surgical procedure done. That means that the gang needs your help to support Nich for what lies ahead. Today starting at 10:00, the aquarium will be holding a fundraiser to help pay off the expenses of the procedure. Sasha is at the aquarium now with Sawyer Nelson, the boy who saved Winter, and Hazel, the owners daughter.\" \"Thank you Emily and Good morning Clearwater City. I'm here with two important teens that would like to give you all a message.\" \" Hi everybody, I'm Sawyer and this is my friend Hazel. Our friend Nich is fighting to stay cancer free.\" Sawyer said. \"And we need all the help we can get\" Hazel added. \" Today we are offering everything 20% off, that means admission, feeding, everything! If we can raise one thousand dollars, you will each receive a special thank you gift as well as 2 free visits to use anytime.\" Hazel said. \"Well you heard them. Come on down and join the fun\" Sasha said. Lines we crazy at the aquarium. Clay had no doubt in his mind that the my wouldn't raise enough money. Hazel and Phoebe ran the dolphin shows for the day, while Sawyer held short classes and tours around the aquarium. The other staff helped keep the animals at top notch, ready for everything that came their way. But something wasn't quite right. \"Hey, dad?\" Hazel asked. \"Yes?\" He replied. Hope is acting funny.\" She said. \"How?\" Clay asked. \"She just doesn't seem as energetic and she isn't following my commands either.\" Hazel reported. \"Alrighty, we'll go finish the show, then I'll have a look for myself.\" \"Ok thanks daddy\". About 30 minutes later the show ended and Clay came to visit Hope and see what the ordeal was. \"Well you're right. She does seem sluggish. I have some tests run on her before the next show..[Chapter 14] \"I gave her some meds, she should be fine by the next show at 3:00. Good thing is, that's the last show of the day\" Clay informed his daughter. \"After closing we'll examine it more.\" 3:00 came and gone, Hope showed no improvement, they were hoping that she hadn't contracted a sickness from somewhere. They didn't even know where she could have got. Her and Nich haven't been in the same pool, Nich has his own pool. It was now 5:00, closing was an hour ago. Clay, Hazel and Sawyer to Hope to Medical area of the aquarium and ran some tests. All shown as negative for sickness. Hazel wondered if maybe she was depressed in some way. But how? Was it the lack of Panama not being there anymore? No one knew. The next day came, Sunday morning was here, the day of relaxing with friends and family. The aquarium was closed every Sunday. But Hazel could not stop thinking about Hope. She couldn't bear to witness the death of another dolphin. If such a thing happened, who would Winter have. It's not like you can just go steal the first female dolphin you see. Now Sawyer believed that Sundays were the days of relaxation and sleeping in. He would have probably woke up that day if it wasn't for his phone ringing. He checked to see who it was. It was Brad. \"Hey Sawyer, my family and I are moving up state to Mobile in Pensacola, Florida. I'm right next door to the USS Alabama. What a cool sight. Hope you can come up here some time.\" Sawyer couldn't believe it one of his friend and I guess who you would consider his wingman had moved without even a glimmer of notice. How could this be? (Sorry for such a short chapter. Setting up chapter 15 for you all.) ","Summary":" Dolphin Tale 3 Sawyer had been on a 3 month journey on a sailboat with some of the smartest marine "},{"Movie":"Ender's Game","Title":"Things Change","Author":"Kaguyahime2000","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9901348","Passage":"[Chapter 1] My first ever attempt and fanfiction, responding to a challenge from a friend! This is slash so if you don't like it do not read or flame! The only thing I have altered in Ender's age, made him slightly older so it is not TOO inappropriate. He is still a minor though so that is a warning and it will continue a rather graphic chapter. Characters are not mine (sadly) and I have no association with Ender's Game etc or its author nor am I making any profit from this. However the plot/story belongs to me and my odd mind. Two Am. The Starfleet Battle School was quiet, the students had long since been ordered to their dormitories and even the teachers had retired. One student though was asleep but restless. Ender Wiggin, fourteen, commander of the Dragon Army. Dark brown hair, brown eyes, normal physical development. Advanced mental development, although normal for him since that was what he had been born for. He had been at the school for some time and had risen quickly through the ranks having been groomed for it early on and as successful as that had been his own feelings had been much neglected. But both childhood and personal emotions were of no interest here and anything except the necessary were considered a waste of time and students were left to struggle through their growth themselves. Ender woke with a start, his freckled skin wet with a sheen of sweat and his hair uncomfortably damp. He sat up and swung his legs out of bed, his head felt muggy and his eyes like lead, this was the seventh night in a row. Sleeping was becoming harder than battles...and sweatier. He knew it was having an adverse effect on his leadership and was beginning to show in his moods. 'Maybe Valentine could help...at least she'd listen...if she still gets my mails, I don't get any from her anymore...' Ender thought, even the mental image of her sweet face brought a small smile tugging at his lips. It didn't last long, his mind drifted back to the dreams he had been having, the ones that made him afraid to sleep but ones he also looked forward to. Even dreaming Ender could feel the warmth of his lips on his and the grip of his hand. On thinking it over this was possibly one thing Valentine may not understand, or if she did she wouldn't understand who. He had not had these feelings from the start, in fact for most of the time Ender thought Mazer Rackham was a bastard. He had the infuriating talent of pointing out his weaknesses, even those not shown and never acknowledging his successes. Yet he was incredible teacher and always got the best out of him, that Ender could not deny. He fascinated him, even his age did not bother him, he didn't look it yet it meant he would not glance in his direction, not in the way he wanted anyway. He had been an inspiration since day one and Ender had searched the archives to find all that he could which had not been much. All that was held was the scene of his triumph over the bugger warships, anything before and after was none existent. Anything that was known about the half Maori soldiers' life what locked away in his memory. 'Things change daily' Ender lay back down 'and you just have to get on with it' but he had no idea how to ignore and get on when he trained with him almost every day. He rolled over and pulled the covers over his head, he had less than four hours until he had to get up and he was not going to useless in the battle room again. Thankfully Ender fell into a dreamless sleep fairly quickly and he felt slightly more alive than he had the past few days and although the Battle against Griffin Army didn't quite as smoothly as he hoped they still won. 'Barely' Ender grumbled to himself as he yanked off his battle suit 'if I could've been more alert Bean and I wouldn't have had our legs frozen and we could've easily won quicker.' He gave the bench a small, hard kick. \"Geez! Will you just cool it?\" Bean shook his head \"you're such a grouch at the moment; if you were Petra I'd ask if it was your time of the month.\" \"I'm allowed to aren't I?\" \"Yeah, but we all get the brunt of it! Commander or not you've got to start keeping your cool, you always used to.\" \"I wish we really were in a war\" Ender carried on, more to himself \"I wouldn't mind blowing up a few buggers when I feel like this\" Bean sighed and finished dressing in silence, he knew better than to ask what the matter was, Ender never shared his feeling with anyone and when he did it was on his own terms. \"Maybe save those feelings for practice, you take them out on Rackham next time he trains you\" Ender tensed at the mention of his teacher, a strange cold tingling sensation trailing up his spine yet his skin felt as if it had flushed. He turned away hastily, not wanting anyone to see the change in colour. One by one the students left the heat of the shower room and left Ender alone with the damp steam twisting around his ankles. He took a few deep breaths, holding the warm air in his lungs for a few seconds before letting it escape. \"Wiggin!\" Ender leapt automatically to his feet, scrambling to keep the towel round his thin waist. The bulky figure of Colonel Dap filled the doorway. From the start Ender has found the man's features very misleading. His face was that of a jolly fat man but he had a personality as dark as his skin. \"Colonel Graff wants to see you as of now\" \"I haven't got any clothes on\" Ender said automatically and felt ridiculous when he did \"Then get some on unless you want to go in a towel\" Dap snapped and went, shaking his head. Ender dressed hurriedly, his navy uniform creased from being crumpled on the floor all night, for once he hadn't bothered hanging it up and now he wished he had. He doubted Graff would say anything but he could imagine the look he would get. Graff had not as much power as he used too, after Ender's unscheduled battle in the shower he was more there just keep an eye on him. 'Suppose I may as well make it worth a look' Ender thought to himself and rushed out the room without tidying anything and the one shoe lace trailing behind. The greying officer raised an eyebrow as the disorganised boy arrived at his office but the pouting look on his face prevented any comment. Instead Graff proceeded with what he needed to say \"Your army is coming on in leaps and bounds, you've won your last nine battles in a row\" he fixed his solemn eyes on the boy's own \"but as you know in a real battle the odds are not as fair as they are here and that's what I want to work on and get you used to.\" Ender nodded, proud of the Jeesh in his own unspoken way, and waited expectantly but his mind had already anticipated what was coming next \"So beginning tomorrow I am putting Dragon against two other armies, it will increase the challenge and give you better experience.\" \"We have been up against two before, Sir\" \"And won, I am aware of that but not quite like I have in mind. Normally I wouldn't give you any warning but you need to start thinking of new and more complex moves to keep yourself in the position you're in.\" \"Who are we up against, Sir?\" \"Rabbit and Centipede, I want to mix teams as well so the combinations I decide on may be odd but that is for a reason. I'm giving you the rest of the day to work on a battle plan, Major Rackham will meet with you at one sharp. Dismissed.\" \"Yes, Sir\" Ender gave a stiff salute and headed down the grey corridors to his room, maybe a few minutes alone would ease his nerves and help him not turn into an embarrassed mess later... Graff watched him go, the boy had grown up fast since he had first started but lately he had noticed he seemed tired and more sullen, his thoughts seemed to be elsewhere and not on what mattered. Child or not he had to continue to mature and ignore whatever growing pains he may have, Graff himself had had to but he had long since forgotten how hard that had been. 'Still' he started flicking through his papers 'maybe the extra work will sort him out...' His thoughts then fell silent and the only sound was the rustling of pages. \"I don't see what could be any different\" Bean said when Ender told him \"but knowing them they'll have some dirty trick\" \"Doesn't matter, we'll play and we'll win\" Ender replied flatly \"I'll speak to you all later, we picked off those armies easily so together they can't be much harder.\" \"I hate saying it but don't get too confident\" Bean laid a friendly hand on his shoulder \"I know you're struggling but...\" \"I am not struggling!\" Ender pulled away angrily \"I'm just not sleeping at the moment...and I don't want that passed around!\" Bean backed off and returned to his seat but Ender felt him cast worried glances over his way. He quickly typed a message for his army to meet him later before the lesson started. 'You're our commander' Bean finished silently in his mind 'and you need to hold it together whatever those idiots throw as us, the teachers are our biggest enemy and breaking down you play into their hands...' After class Ender was the first to leave, his focused stride casting a warning to anyone who was thinking of approaching him.[Chapter 2] 12.25 \"So I want you all ready by six thirty, eat at supper if you must but not too much, the last thing I want is people throwing up.\" Ender's announcement of the extra training was met with a resounding groan, they had been looking forward for a small amount of free time and now they were getting a large amount of hard work. \"They may not be as strong as we are but they are going to have more manpower so if we are going to have any chance of beating them we need to be of our game and totally prepared. Any suggestions will be welcomed, anyone got questions?\" No one answered, Bean shrugged and Petra have him a small, sympathetic smile when she noticed the scowls. 'Well' Ender thought to himself as he walked away 'whether they like me or not doesn't matter, we get the job done and that's all that counts.' He echoed down the corridor heading nowhere in particular, he had had his head buried in written word all morning and was beginning to feel like an ostrich but without the option to pull up. Alai had once mentioned trying to meditate but Ender had never really gotten the hang of it and to make matters worse had caused much amusement when his legs went to sleep and he got stuck. After regaining some dignity he had snapped that there was no point without the music anyway. Ender paused as he came to where the corridor parted then chose the direction of Mazer Rackham's office. He was early and he doubted his tutor would appreciate it but he was used to the criticism by now and early was better than late. The door was faintly ajar and Ender approached cautiously, his feet now making no sound on the metal, and hesitated outside. Rackham was sat on the floor, legs crossed and eyes closed. His breathing was calm and the top few buttons on his shirt were left open for ease. Ender felt the familiar tremor he had experienced in his dreams and wished he knew what Rackham was thinking. \"You're early, Wiggin\" Rackham opened an eye and glanced over \"I thought it better to be early than late, Sir\" \"You know I don't like to be disturbed\" \"Sorry, Sir\" Rackham sighed and got to his feet, buttoning his shirt, his eyes bright behind the dark tattoos. \"I...I guess I am slightly uptight about tomorrow\" Ender cursed himself inwardly for sounding so stupid. \"You know full well that it is nerves that will get you killed, and stop stuttering, boy\" his voice was calm but Ender picked up annoyance in the accent. \"I'm not nervous! I'm bothered because although we are winning my army is not performing as well as they might despite me putting them through their paces. They're falling apart.\" \"Them or you?\" Ender bristled at the question but could give no retort, Rackham continued \"Because from what I have seen and heard you aren't exactly in top form yourself\" despite Ender's savage glare his eyes never left him. \"But don't think I will be any easier on you, in fact I could use it as an excuse to be a lot harder\" he looked at Ender's uniform \"but before anything I am giving you five minutes to get yourself tidy, as a commander you are supposed to lead by example and you look a mess.\" \"Yes Sir...\" \"I will meet you in the study when you look more respectable.\" Six minutes later Ender emerged to find him waiting impatiently \"You're late\" Ender didn't respond, early or late he could never please him \"but at least you're tidy.\" Ender wandered to the desk and sat down while Rackham scanned the rows of old film and footage, despite being many the films actually contained very little in the way of strategical information. In fact most of his ideas Ender developed from the enemy formations. \"Why is there no more of you, Sir?\" It was a question Ender had wanted to ask for some time \"students could learn so much from you and the only film we have is of that last battle.\" \"Why would there be any?\" Rackham had found what he was looking for and came over, brushing Ender's leg as he did so and he knew he would feel that touch for hours. \"This was a battle fought very early on, the buggers outnumbered us by almost double but victory was still ours although we lost a fair few men...\" As he continued Ender felt himself drifting off into a daydream and his normally attentive eyes fixed themselves on the outside. Space lay all around, a vast expanse of void dotted with stars like glittered like diamonds on an ebony canvas. He suddenly felt very alone and wished he could move closer to his teacher, just to feel another presence beside him and share what warmth there was. \"Wiggin!\" His head shot up at the sudden sound \"Sorry, Sir\" \"If you're not going to listen then I am wasting valuable time.\" \"Why don't you tell me anything more about you and how you worked? Or even anything about yourself?\" \"Because you don't need to know that\" Rackham said irritably. 'I don't even know what else you do here' Ender continued in his head, more daring in his thoughts than he ever was out loud 'and I'll find out whether you want me to or not. I could use it as a useful skill for the future.' For a second his mind drifted back to his dreams and Rackham saw a strange, glazed look come over to boys face. It caught him off guard and for once he hadn't a clue what to say to bring Ender's attention back. It was an uncomfortable cramp down below that brought him back to the present time and Ender closed his legs tightly under the table \"Do you know how frustrating that was?\" Rackham grumbled as they finished \"I do hope this isn't a new phase you're going through.\" \"No, Sir...just distracted today but it won't last, I won't let it\" \"Good\" Rackham said no more and left for his quarters, Ender wished he could run through things with the others while they were still fresh in his mind and at least then someone else could remember them for him but no one was free yet. He found himself hesitating where the passage split 'Not now' he chided himself and kept to his planned route 'too active now anyway, it would be easier to explore later in the evening.' Later on when classes had finished Ender wandered down to Dragon's room, Bean and Dink were the only ones in the dormitory deep in discussion about the homes they had left behind and one of Bean's attractive neighbours. \"How'd it go?\" Bean asked as he walked in \"Not too bad\" Ender lied convincingly \"he only went through footage that could be of use\" \"Was it?\" \"That remains to be seen but I got a few ideas I want to run through\" \"Great, more work\" \"Don't blame me; blame Graff if anyone\" Ender snapped \"I didn't ask for this to be added!\" \"I'm not blaming you but I really think you need to let us know what's bugging you, you aren't much of a commander like this.\" \"Where are the others?\" Ender said changing the subject \"I'd like to let you all know what I thought.\" \"Petra's off with one of the older boys\" Dink informed him with a small grin \"and the others are in the longue.\" \"So you may want to wait a while\" Bean added \"or just tell us for now.\" \"Let's just say defence and dodging is more important than attack this time, I want to work on avoiding being hit as long as possible because it is certain we are one against two or more tomorrow. And that is the reason I am going to designate a couple of you as bait, it's a fact that we are going to have to lose to win\" He was acknowledged with two nods of agreement and was surprised how well the others took it also. His team seemed completely in control and their movement fast and fluid, not good enough maybe for two of the stronger armies but acceptable for whom they were against. For once he found himself offering a few compliments, they were strained and it seemed to ease the tension somewhat. His main idea had been to use the stars as defence and attack from behind; Bean had added the idea of pulling it or something near in front of them if fired at. That had turned out a bit chaotic but it was a last resort and would as ever depend on what their opponents had in mind. \"No one threw up either so that's a bonus\" he joked to Bean as he was about to exit \"Always is\" Bean smiled \"you sure you don't want to talk?\" Ender shook his head, Bean didn't push and left. Ender dressed slowly, the air feeling like ice on his warm skin but he wanted to be alone, it was late and he should have been heading back to his room but that wasn't his idea. Not just yet anyway. He actually didn't have a clue what he was doing as he turned down into the corridor leading to the teachers' quarters but his curiosity drew him on. Every door looked the same, like their own rooms if you didn't know which you were in it was impossible to tell. The only one that was obvious was Colonel Dap's since Ender could hear him grumbling to himself from outside. \"Something you needed, Wiggin?\" Ender span round to find Colonel Graff turning the corner behind him. \"No, Sir...\" The older man looked at him sceptically \"well actually I was looking for Major Rackham\" well it was a half truth. \"Did he ask for you?\" \"No...\" Graff folded his arms \"Well if he didn't then you'd best leave him be, and you know full well you aren't allowed in this area. Commander of your army or not.\" \"Sorry, sir...\" Ender dodged round him \"I'd best get back\" \"I can let him know you wanted to see him but don't let me catch you down here again, Wiggin\" \"No Sir\" Ender said with a tired sigh.[Chapter 3] \"What do you thinks up with him?\" Bean hissed across to Dink as they prepared themselves for the morning's game. Dink shrugged but said nothing. Ender had a glazed look in his eye and his mind was focussed entirely on winning, the noise around him was a low, constant hum and anything anyone said to him was not received. His temples ached and a cold sweat dampened his hair beneath the helmet. It was as if he had a force field around him, no one could get to him if they wanted to but when he was like this no one did anyway. Ender soon found out what Graff had meant when he said he had not faced two armies like this. Centipede was the first the fall but before Dragon could have a chance to feel more relieved Rabbit army joined in their place. \"Get into formation!\" Ender yelled as he dragged the remainder of his team behind the nearest stars \"the only way to do this is to get one person through and let the rest of us be frozen!\" The others surrounded him allowing the lasers to strike, Ender held his breath as he felt the muscles of the other tense as they froze up and did not breathe properly until he pushed himself through the gate. Whilst the others congratulated each other Ender dress quickly and exited annoyed with himself. He should have read more into what Colonel Graff had said. He could quite have easily cost them their win. And that win meant nothing as it was luck more than effort. 'Let the others be pleased' he thought 'I'm not there to cast a shadow on it...' He headed toward the classroom, he was fifteen minutes early but it would give him time on his own. He paused as he heard footsteps and looked round, half expecting it to be Dink or Bean looking for him. Instead Mazer Rackham appeared; he noticed Ender but made no sign of acknowledgement. \"That battle was completely unfair, Sir\" Rackham stopped and looked at Ender evenly \"Since when was war ever fair? I certainly never remember any battle having any equality in it and the tactics I came up against were a lot more unfair than what you have just faced.\" Ender could say nothing to that and wondered why he had said anything...except to be in the presence of his hero and feel the need he did in his dreams. Or nightmares as they were becoming as it felt as if they haunted him. Beautiful nightmares. As Rackham started to leave Ender spoke again \"Can't you tell me anything more, Sir? About your battles, I could learn a lot from you\" \"If you listened you would learn a lot anyway, and no, you don't need to know anything more that you don't already.\" 'I knew you'd say that' Ender thought but said no more. Rackham walked away and Ender followed a few paces behind until he reached the classroom door. He paused outside until Rackham was out of sight wondering how he would react if he dared to tell him the extent of his feelings. Probably not too well but he was yet to see any particular emotion from him. 'Soon' Ender promised himself 'but now is not the time' When the right time was he had no idea but knew he would somehow know when it was, he pushed open the classroom door and wandered in, heading for his normal chair. \"Petra?!\" The girl sprang to her feet, her face flushed with embarrassment, the boy she was with even more so. Her brown hair was out of place and her uniform partially undone, the boy quickly yanked his pants up and dashed out the room. \"Please don't tell!\" Ender couldn't speak, he knew he should report her unseemly behaviour but despite being unforgiving in battle he hadn't the heart to ruin her. \"Ender please...\" Ender finally found his voice which came out in a mousy squeak \"Where'd you see that?\" Petra gave a relieved smile, she could read Ender well and was well aware he would have turned on his heel and done his duty straight away if he was going to. Ender Wiggin didn't waste time. \"Some ancient movie I caught my father watching\" she glanced at the huge screen that dominated the front of the room \"not something you'd find here.\" She started up the steps adding as she went \"I wouldn't go any further...I was just curious\" she chose a seat in the far corner indicating she didn't want to talk about it. \"You're lucky it was me\" Ender called over \"I don't think Colonel Dap would be as forgiving!\" Petra gave a small laugh but there was no amusement in it. \"He would have had me thrown out of here with no oxygen\" she replied flatly, relieved when she saw the door open and others trudge in. The boy Petra had been with came in last and took a seat as far away as he could from both Petra and Ender, his eyes cast down. 'She could do better' Ender found himself thinking critically as he flicked a glance over 'he isn't the best in battle or in looks, in fact I'm not even sure why he's here...' The rest of the morning passed without incident, the usual mix of carefully cut films and vague teachings. Then after lunch Ender found Rackham waiting for him outside his room \"About time, Wiggin\" he said as Ender saluted \"Waiting is not one of my favourite pastimes as you well know.\" 'I wouldn't have kept you waiting if I'd known' Ender thought crossly but said nothing as he followed Rackham down the corridor and into a room reserved for shooting practice. It was a plain area with nothing adorning it except a control panel. When used lifelike targets would appear and unless you hit them first the game was over. Unlike the battle room there was nothing to hide behind and was meant to test ability in certain situations. \"Since your battles are becoming harder it has been decided to train you with different weapons, in some circumstances what you use would be primitive and ineffective.\" Rackham bent down opened the hidden door beneath the panel and pulled out what looked to Ender to be a laser exactly the same as he already used. Rackham noticed his sceptical expression \"Don't ask, Wiggin\" he said roughly handing it to him \"this is a double barrelled laser, it will shoot two targets at once. It stretches to a ninety degree angle, obviously no more or you would shoot yourself...although I daresay you could manage that.\" He tapped the keys and the holographs of two buggers appeared \"At the moment I'm using stationary targets but that is for today only\" he stepped back and gestured for him to shoot. Ender raised the gun but Rackham's eyes felt heavy on him and his thoughts drifted as he pulled the trigger. Both lasers missed by a mile. Rackham said nothing but Ender would tell he was taken aback, so was he; normally he could grasp what was forced on him straight away. The targets still stood and he raised the gun again...and missed. Rackham came over and stood behind him, still saying nothing he supported Ender's arms from behind, setting them in the correct position. Ender felt his skin flush at the closeness but the feeling of his mentor beside him, steadying him was calming, his next shot was perfect. When Rackham stood back Ender still felt his touch and support and his aim was spot on. \"Not exactly up to scratch\" Rackham said as they finished \"your mind needs to be focussed on the matter at hand.\" \"Yes, Sir\" Ender kept his eyes on the floor, not wanting his eyes to give anything away \"I'll prove I can kill every single target tomorrow and hold my ground.\" \"Perhaps not tomorrow but very soon after\" came the offhand response, he picked up another gun \"try this one.\" It was a single laser but as Ender hit his target the light shattered like glass taking out three others, Rackham said nothing which was normally a sign he had done well. Ender tried a few more shots, positioning himself differently, two out of the four worked. \"When you get used to these you can train your team to use them but I want you to study them until every shot is perfect, then you can attempt the games I set you.\" Rackham hung them back in place \"Do I still need to go to class?\" Ender didn't attend very many but even the few he did he found dull \"Yes, the ones you do sit are important although you most likely don't appreciate it, now go.\" Ender practically ran out, not noticing the strange expression on his teacher's face.[Chapter 4] \"The boy's distracted\" \"So you've said, have you asked him why?\" \"I'm not his keeper, Colonel, whatever is on his mind is his own problem, not mine.\" \"You're the one who sees him the most; you need to make it your business. You're already hard enough on him, unless you figure out what's the matter he may cave in completely. And don't tell me you don't care, Rackham, as to the trained eye it is clear that you do\" Rackham strode out from speaking with Colonel Graff wondering why he had even bothered although he had half expected the reply. He searched his mind trying to recall back to when he was Ender Wiggin's age, it seemed so very long ago. After his success in destroying the bugger mother ship he had banished a lot of his memories, or maybe the trauma had caused him to forget, he could never be too sure now. Grudgingly Rackham had to accept that he had never been as advanced as Ender was but he doubted that made a difference. He opened the door to his office and pulled out his file on him. The boy intrigued him, he had grown a lot since he had been there and was far more mature than anyone could have hoped. \"Perhaps too fast...\" Rackham muttered, despite denying it, had noticed subtle changes as the boy aged and it was now becoming hard to ignore. Often of late he had caught Ender gazing at him, his mind elsewhere and sometimes he felt as if he could read his thoughts, however much he tried to guard them. He shook his head and carried on reading, much had been noted on the boy's mental development and psychical but nothing out of the ordinary. Emotional development however was omitted; no one really took much notice of that but it had been raised that emotional wellbeing was as crucial. Especially since Ender had a lot more to face, a lot more hurt to come. Rackham closed the file and pushed it aside, nothing that was there was any help. He supposed he had no choice except talk to him, Ender was incredibly difficult to read and he couldn't fathom anything from his face and his body language also told him little. But it was clear he was unhappy and that made him a danger to both himself and others if he didn't pull it together. \"Petra? Can I talk to you?\" The girl looked up from her bed where she was sat reading, she frowned slightly \"Look if it's about earlier...\" Ender shook his head \"It isn't...but it kind of triggered it if that makes sense?\" She nodded and he continued \"something's been bothering me, if I could talk to Valentine I would but I don't even know if my letters get through. I need to talk to someone though and I was hoping you'd listen, if not I've got no one and even though I'm used to that it doesn't make it any easier.\" Petra's eyes filled with concern and she moved for Ender to sit next to her \"You can always talk to me, I'd never tell anyone anything and even if I can't suggest anything I can listen.\" Ender perched on the bed beside her, Petra was second best to Valentine, she had a calmness about her that was comforting and he felt he could trust her with his life. \"It's awkward...\" he began and nervously told her everything, well not quite everything, he omitted out Rackham's name as that was slightly too much information. \"Well\" Petra said as he finished \"I think whoever it is the best thing is to tell him...he isn't in your army?\" \"No\" Ender traced a pattern on the floor, not meeting her eyes \"Then what's the worst that could happen?\" 'They could throw me out' Ender answered in his head but didn't say it, instead he nodded. \"You won't do anything stupid will you?\" Ender looked up sharply \"because I have known you do a fair few things that are and something like this you can't afford to. Like the time you pissed off Bonzo and nearly got yourself killed.\" \"I won't!\" Ender snapped, irritated by her reference to his former army commander \"besides that was totally different.\" \"It was the easiest to remember, I doubt this would get you killed but it could be tricky\" Petra smiled \"either way you know where to find me.\" He thanked her quietly and got up. He decided to head to the video library, he had already watched most if not all of the footage that was filed there but it was a place he knew would most likely be empty. And it had a window and sometimes it was nice to sit alone and be lost in space and memories, just drifting. It was empty and Ender closed the door in the hope others would recognise he wanted to be alone. Instead of sitting he stood and looked aimlessly at the various videos stored there and thought about what Petra had said. He could imagine Valentine saying the same but he wondered if that would have been the advice if they knew who he meant. 'Probably would have said to leave well alone' Ender mused 'and maybe that would be best anyway...however much it effects me.' He picked out a few of his favourite pieces of footage and loaded them onto the screen, even those long past images of his hero brought the familiar warmth and tingle to his lower regions. And watching him he could hardly believe that the celebrated soldier was the one who now trained him and had had been so close as he held the laser. Ender wanted that closeness again. He stayed there until supper when Bean found him. \"You been here all this time? I looked everywhere!\" \"Yeah, think I'm just going to go back to my room, not really that hungry...\" Bean gave a sigh and sat down opposite him \"Ender, this isn't like you...\" \"I'm fine, just go.\" Bean heard the set voice and knew he was going wasn't going to get anywhere when he has in this sort of mood. However as if to humour him Ender went with him to where the corridors spilt and even managed to give him a half smile before they parted. Rackham closed the office door, however busy he had been he had actually accomplished very little. For once in his life he had been avoiding doing what he knew he should, he had never had any feeling besides indifference to students and had no idea how to talk them. The simple fact that he did care concerned him. Especially since he had no idea what type of feelings these were. It annoyed him more knowing the trials Ender was to be put through, what they really needed him for, emotion made it all the more difficult. Deep within him he hated the way the children were treated, it came very close to abuse but it was a damn sight better that when he had been that age. 'It's also better than being slave to an ant empire' he thought ruefully, allowing logic omit any other ideas 'their sacrifice won't be for nothing' at least that's what they all hoped. As he locked the door there was a faint noise from behind him, he turned quickly only to see a shadow vanished back around the corner. \"Shit!\" Ender threw himself on his bed, he had never backed out of anything. He had fought advanced armies and won against all odds and yet facing one person made him chicken out. He gave his pillow a few furious punches before falling on it in tired frustration. He pulled the crumpled card he had found pushed under his door and looked at it. 7.15 am. Salamander and Griffin. 'No doubt there'll be another unpleasant surprise' Ender thought and tossed it to one side, he logged into the computer and sent a note round to his own army informing them and instructing to keep to the same pattern as that morning, adding as an afterthought to tell him of any other formations or strategies they may think up. Then, despite it being so early, he fell into another restless sleep. 2.15 am Ender woke with a start, his nightwear clung to him, uncomfortably cold and damp like early morning mist. It brought back memories of autumn walks he had had back on earth with Valentine before breakfast and how they had both ended up with the flu. 'Even that was fun with Val...' He swung out of bed, unsurprising alert, and folded back the sheets to et them air and get rid of the clammy fee. He stood in the darkness for a moment, the quiet soothing his turbulent head. He felt a mess. His thoughts were confused and his moods much the same. With a frustrated sigh he wandered out into the corridor not caring if he got caught 'They need to start taking some notice' Ender thought crossly 'we're not robots...' He headed toward the battle room, intending to practice with the double laser, at least he could give it his best tomorrow and if anyone found him he was doing something constructive, but when he got to the room they kept the weapons he found it locked. Turning back, his bare feet making no found on the metal floor, he diverted down to the teachers quarters, the office doors were always unlocked since none of the students were allowed down there. Rackham's office was the fourth one down, this Ender knew having been there before, Colonel Graff's and his were the only one he was sure of. Bored and wide awake he ducked inside. As he expected it was meticulously tidy, not a file out of place and barely a speck of dust, even his chair was carefully pushed under the desk. 'He's like a droid' Ender shook his head 'no human is this tidy...most don't tidy their desks more than once a year...' He wished he could sit down, his feet were getting cold, but he knew it would be instantly noticeable to his teachers sharp eye if the chair was moved even half a centimetre. Instead he paced over to examine to folders, moving from one foot to the other as he stood. He caught sight of his file immediately and carefully removed it; Rackham's handwriting was appalling, probably due to everything being done on computer, there was little use for freehand nowadays. Flicking through it there was nothing of real interest but as he replaced it Ender noticed a small leather bound book hidden behind. Cautiously reached up and took it out. The pages seemed old but the cover had not a scratch on it and although he had been raised on computers and technology he knew it was a diary. Valentine used to keep one under the mattress, he knew because he had secretly read it. This time he hesitated, he knew how much he hated his own privacy invaded, it was bad enough around here with the cameras filming everything that went on. But this was something he couldn't resist. The writing was chicken scrawl but Ender managed to decipher somewhat, what he read intrigued him, it was a view of Rackham that no one else had ever seen. He skipped forward to the more recent entries and stopped, his blood warming. I often think Wiggin does things just to annoy me. I try my best to dislike him but it is starting to get much harder, I detest these emotions, they are unnatural and inappropriate. Ender pushed the diary back into place with shaking hands before slipping back to his room.[Chapter 5] WARNINGS: This is an M rated chapter (minor, anal, oral) They lost. Ender felt furious as they exited the battle area, no one said anything to him seeing the angry glow in his deep brown eyes and the tense muscles in his face and hands. Bean watched him from the other side of the room and knew he would be in a dreadful mood for the rest of the day. One thing Ender Wiggin hated most was losing, especially to his former army. It has all started well with them freezing five of the others with a few seconds of beginning, maybe they were too confident. Salamander had come up with some very sneaky and clever tactics and due to having no practice the night before Dragon was caught off guard. And with the addition of two other armies coming in very quickly the battle was over and done with in no time. Now Ender was kicking himself, he knew he should have pushed himself and scheduled a training session. Who cared if he was tired? Practice came first and with good reason, now he'd screwed up. They may still be top but it was loss he didn't want. And when he opened the computer and saw the terse note left he felt even worse. See Me, 6.30. M. Rackham \"Look, I doubt it's anything dreadful\" Petra sighed watching Ender pace from one end of the dormitory to the other \"it can't be about todays...slip, that note would have been sent before.\" \"It's not just that...I've got a lot on my mind and it isn't stuff I want to talk to Bean about, I don't think he'd understand.\" \"I know, from what you've already told me...and I don't think you're telling me everything, not that that is a bad thing\" she added quickly, not wanting him to feel she was prying. Ender didn't think that and spent a while more talking to her until class started. Nor however did he feel any better. Maybe it was stupid, in fact it was and he knew it, when six came and went he decided to forget meeting Rackham and stay in the library until an hour after. \"I thought you may be here\" Ender started and span round, Rackham stood by the door, his voice was calm but Ender knew he was not amused. \"My office, Wiggin. Now \" Ender has no choice and sulkily followed him, he didn't offer the excuse he had forgotten since he knew Rackham wouldn't believe it. Despite his rank Rackham's office was fairly small with only his desk and a chair which he pulled out and sat heavily. He looked at Ender evenly, his eyes bright and impossible to read. \"You know what this is about\" it was a statement not a question \"you've been distracted and practically useless the last few weeks. Not only that you've either been avoiding me or following me, don't think I'm not aware you were in here last night.\" \"Yes, Sir\" Ender kept a straight face and tried to remain as impassive as his mentor however hard his heart was pounding, he knew he would have been spotted, it would all be on the cameras and yet part of him didn't care, part of him had wanted to be seen. \"Are you going to tell me why?\" \"No, Sir...\" Rackham frowned \"That wasn't a request, boy\" Ender remained silent, his eyes dropping to the floor, for a time Rackham did not speak either, his gaze steady on the figure before him. The he reached out and gripped Ender's chin, forcing the boy's head up and his eyes to meet his. \"What on earth is the matter with you, Wiggin?\" \"Let me go and I'll tell you...Sir\" Rackham raised an eyebrow at being given a order by a fourteen year old but complied \"Well?\" Ender hesitated for a second then as quick and light as an elf stepped forward and kissed his teachers lips, long enough to savour the scent he wore. He stepped back stiffly, his body tensed as he awaited his reaction. None came, Rackham remained motionless but his eyes were fixed on emptiness, lost in thought. After the longest few seconds Ender had ever endured he spoke, his voice was soft and slow \"So...this is where my efforts have got me, I thought I had made you detest me\" \"I think is what made me want you even more...\" Ender replied just as quietly \"I've felt this way for a while and, according to the others, there are things to learn...and I want to learn them from you, Sir.\" Ender knew what he wanted to say but as he did it sounded wrong and confused. Rackham leant back in his chair, his gaze never leaving Ender's \"What make you think I know anything? It would be safer for you to walk away now and save your questions for others.\" \"Sir...\" \"I mean it, Wiggin\" \" No \" Ender's voice was raised and defiant \"maybe you think you can order me and I'll walk away but not this time! I won't go...and I think your reaction or lack of one means you're holding back your own feelings.\" Rackham leapt to his feet and Ender closed his eyes and waited for a slap that never came, instead, when he opened them, he found Rackham had turned away and was leaning against the desk lost in thought again. \"S...sir?\" \"You're fourteen, Wiggin...\" \"So?\" Rackham glanced round, how could a boy so bright be so ignorant? He put it down to typical teenage petulance. \"So it is illegal under most, if not all, rulings\" \"We're not on earth though, those rules haven't been made yet\" Rackham had no reply to that and jut willed himself to keep his composure, not sure if it was annoyance or something else that made his blood warmer and his heart quicken its pace. \"You look tense, Sir\" Ender smiled strangely \"I'm always tense, now go...\" \"Not yet\" He stepped forward, close enough for his uniform to touch his teachers, his dark brown eyes fixed on Rackham's, an odd glint sparkling there. Slowly he knelt down and his nimble fingers flicked open the button and zip on the others pants. Rackham stiffened, he sought to find the right words but none would come and his voice seemed to have vanished, as if he wanted it to. Instead his breath became uneven as his student gently caressed his phallus, hardening it even more. Finally a low groan escaped as Ender began to tease with his tongue whilst stroking the shaft lightly. \"Where...the hell did you learn this, Wiggin?\" Rackham finally managed to stutter, his knuckles turning white as he gripped the desk. \"Petra\" Ender said pausing \"caught her a few days ago, she said it was from some ancient movie her dad has. Suppose I should have said something but I'd scared her enough and I had other things to do anyway\" he went back to his demonstration. \"Wiggin, stop!\" Rackham raised his voice just enough to not draw attention from elsewhere. Ender sat back, it was a tone of voice he hadn't heard from his teacher before, one that was mixed with confusion and panic. \"You know I've thought everything through, Sir\" Ender said as Rackham hastily buttoned his fly \"I've done the same as I would in battle, my main obstacle was your response.\" \"I should report you to Colonel Graff and get you thrown out with your tail between your legs after trying to explain to your team why\" he caught hold of Ender's collar and yanked him to his feet \"but I'm not, you are unfortunately too valuable to lose...nor am I going to continue this here.\" A frustrated frown appeared on Ender's forehead and after an awkward pause Rackham continued even though he had a feeling it was against his better judgement. \"We can talk more in my room; I refuse to have anyone walk in this sort of discussion\" Ender refrained from the childish urge to jump for joy and instead gave an attempt at a mock salute. \"Lead the way, Sir...\" They walked in silence; Ender keeping a few paces behind, Rackham's hands were clasped behind his back, his nails digging into his palms. He hadn't a clue why he was doing this, he could say 'no' and send him out from his office. But his mind obviously had decided differently and it was best to go along with it. He paused for a second where the corridor split, making sure they were alone before allowing Ender to follow him into the teachers' quarters. Once in his room he closed the door ad locked it quietly, still bemused at what he was doing. Ender looked around; the room was a similar size and small style as the dormitory but the extra space was taken up by a desk and bookcase filled with precisely arranged files and manuals. A door to the right led off to a small shower room. He looked back at Rackham who stood with arms folded and eyes elsewhere, Ender decided to break the almost painful silence since it was apparent Rackham was not going to. \"You're still too tense...request permission to suck your cock again?\" \"I've always hated that term\" Rackham replied flatly \"but fine, my 'cock' is all yours but that is as far as it goes.\" He sat stiffly on the edge of the bed, tensing even more as Ender knelt before him 'You'll give in' Ender thought, running his tongue over the already stiffening organ, tracing tiny circles over the tip with his index finger 'you brought me here.' Rackham swore under his breath and try as he might his body began to betray him. Ender suddenly found himself dragged up by his collar, his lips connected his Rackham's. Ender pushed his tongue to meet the others, wanting to deepen the kiss as much as he could. With his free hand Rackham deftly traced Ender's shirt undoing the buttons, he released the collar and moved his lips to Ender's throat, gently nipping the sensitive skin. Ender shrugged the shirt to the floor and kicked it away \"You should have more respect for you uniform, boy\" Rackham noted, pausing for a second \"I don't care about that, just don't stop\" \"I have no intention of stopping just yet\" He made no objection as Ender climbed onto the bed next to him \"Don't...\" Ender complained as Rackham once again fastened his pants \"You've seen enough\" \"I want to see all of you\" Rackham made no reply \"at least take the top half off?\" When he still said nothing Ender reached out and began to fiddle and undo the buttons, with lightening reflex Rackham caught hold of his hand. \"What did I just say, Wiggin?\" Ender felt his temper rise slightly \"You said nothing, Sir\" he said boldly \"besides, whatever you do say it is clear you want this as much as me, you're easier to read than you think but in denial of having any emotion except indifference. Me bringing them out scares you...\" Rackham's eyes glittered dangerously but he listened closely as Ender continued, moving closer as he did. \"You managed to get yourself into a trap, you must want something more or you would have reported me in seconds\" he rested his hand on the others shoulder. \"I should have known you'd figure that out\" Rackham said finally, covering Ender's hand with his own \"but what I want is surely not worth the repercussions it would have on both you and me if anyone found out, more on myself.\" \"No one will find out, I don't speak to the others that much...and I want to see if you have any other neat tattoos\" Ender added with a small grin. \"I don't\" but he undid his jacket anyway and although Ender expected nothing less he was still blown away by the toned and muscular upper body. Rackham moved his hand down to his crotch and gently massaged the swollen area. Ender whimpered and gently pulled him down on him, as his probing became more intimate Ender found Rackham seemed to know his body better than himself. Each time he knew where to touch for a reaction. He made no more objections about disrobing and soon both uniforms were in a crumpled mess on the floor. Ender trembled as Rackham lifted his leg and fingered the entrance with a cold finger \"for once I'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to, tell me to stop and I will\" \"The gel is cold, that's all\" Ender said, his voice shaky \"I want to feel you close, as close as you can possibly get\" \"I thought you'd say that...but I don't have anything got put on the end\" he pushed in another finger \"Why do you have gel then?\" Ender asked then paused as Rackham raised an eyebrow \"oh...got it.\" \"Onto your knees\" Rackham commanded with a sigh, Ender obeyed willingly his heart fluttering \"this will hurt.\" \"I don't care, I'm used to hurting\" Even so, if Rackham hadn't covered his mouth, his cry of pain would probably have caused some alarm and unwanted attention. \"Just fuck me senseless\" Ender groaned gripping hold of his hand tightly \"I'll forget it then\" \"Watch your language, boy\" With his free hand he took hold of Ender's own hardness and squeezed gently, Ender trembled and climaxed with a slight cry. Rackham increased his thrusts and with one final push finished, filling his body with warmth. He sat back, an awkward, tight expression materialized \"I...have to take a shower\" he said brusquely \"Can I join you?\" \"It would hardly matter if I said no anyway\" Rackham retorted, grabbing a towel from the closet. As the warm water fell Ender wrapped his arms round Rackham's waist, leaning lightly against him \"We can't allow this to happen again, Wiggin\" Rackham said quietly \"Because of your other bed mate?\" Ender answered pettily \"who is it anyway?\" \"I don't have to tell you everything\" \"You don't tell me anything !\" Ender thought he heard Rackham chuckle \"No, it's not that, what has happened was highly inappropriate...\" His voice trailed away \"It's not anyone in my army or Salamander is it?\" Ender pressed, his curiosity getting in the way of common sense. \"No! You are the first...and will be the last under aged person, because\" he moved Ender's arm and turned to face him \"like it or not you are still a child, easy it is to forget when you are treated as a miniature adult.\" \"You know I won't be worn down without a fight, you yourself taught me that.\" \"My teaching is backfiring somewhat...\" Rackham wrapped the towel round his waist and returned to the bedroom \"you'd best get dressed and return to your quarters.\" \"Can't I stay with you tonight? I don't mean to argue but what if someone saw?\" \"You've been arguing with me all night\" Rackham looked at the clock; half past midnight, his gaze travelled back to Ender, for the first time in a long while he looked exhausted \"fine you can stay.\" Ender crawled under the covers, not minding that he seemed childlike, as Rackham lay next to him he moved closer and rested his head on his chest, soothed by his teachers heartbeat and the way he absent mindedly ran his fingers through his hair. \"I wanted you to finish in my mouth...maybe you will next time\" \"I thought I had established there won't be a next time\" Ender smiled to himself knowingly and drifted into sleep. The dreams returned but this time they were darker. He was home, playing a game with his family. Peter stood up, malice in his eyes and threw the dice into the air. They landed: 666 As Ender watched his family transformed, half demon, half bugger. And it was Valentine who lunged at his throat... Half awake Ender thrashed, he rolled over and clung onto his teacher and felt a warm hand gently stroke his face. \"Hush lad...\" a soft New Zealand accent spoke, knowing the torment dreams could cause, then everything was dark once more. He awoke with a start when the clock read five. Rackham was perched o the end of the bed dressing, he glanced toward him briefly. \"You need to get back\" was all he said \"Is that it then?\" \"What more do you want me to say?\" \"I want you to admit to what I already know; that you want this again, it was obvious when I kissed you...I want to know more and I want you to teach it.\" \"No wonder people think you're older then you actually are\" \"I won't act any different or tell anyone...they don't need to know about any 'extra' lessons\" he said with a small grin. Rackham sighed and shook his head \"we'll see, boy, we'll see...\"[Chapter 6] \"Well?\" \"Well what?\" \"Did you talk to the boy?\" \"To a degree. He didn't say much.\" \"Well persist, the time is approaching and we need his full attention, understand?\" Rackham understood. Only too well, as long as the job was done the effect of the soldier never mattered. If they wanted something they got and then you were a problem for someone else to sort out. It was why he had tried not to form any attachments; people had been dismissed for just that. God knew what they'd do with him. He had avoided Ender for a few days, when questioned he had said he wanted to see how well he performed before moving on. Colonel Graff had frowned at this, making things easier was something very uncharacteristic of Mazer Rackham. \"Fine, he's all yours anyway\" He flinched at the term Graff used \"But get him back on schedule quickly, and get his head sorted.\" So it was later that day he forwarded a note informing Ender that his training resumed the following morning at ten sharp. Under no circumstances was he to be late. \"How are you doing?\" Bean asked with a smile as Ender sat down with him at lunch, the food looked lumpy and unappetising but he was too hungry to care. He tried to remember the last time he had had candy or something that hadn't been processed into mush. It felt like years...maybe it had been, he'd stopped trying to make sense of the days ages ago. \"Not too bad\" \"You seem better than you were, at least I don't feel like I'm walking on glass around you...maybe that's why Rackham's not seen you for few days!\" 'Unlikely' Ender thought then adjusted the reply \"I don't think my bad moods would faze him somehow.\" \"True\" Bean sipped his water \"well whatever is helping, keep it up! You're a lot easier to work with at the moment.\" Ender smiled to himself, as much as he would like to keep it up he had a feeling he would have a job convincing Rackham to. Out of the corner of his eyes he saw Petra exiting, he excused himself and followed after her \"Petra, wait!\" She turned and it seemed to take her a few moments to register who he was \"Oh, hey...\" \"What's the matter?\" \"Nothing to do with you\" she scowled and started to walk away, Ender jogged after her; she stopped with a sigh and looked at him. Her lips were set in a grim line and her eyes her fed up. \"Sorry, I'm just not in a great mood today; I've got a lot on my mind at the moment\" \"I just wanted to ask you something but if you want to be alone...\" \"No, it's fine, I would like to be left alone but if you keep it short...\" Petra tailed off for a second \"just ask\" she said shaking her head. \"Let's just say I followed your advice and told the person...in a way, I was interesting and now I have a feeling they are avoiding me.\" \"Sounds normal, I think I would until I'd sorted out in my own mind how I felt and how to respond\" she smiled half heartedly \"deal with it, things normally work out...they did with my parents!\" Ender nodded, his eyes filled with concern, not just for her but for the effect it could have...although when pitched against her it could be an advantage. But thinking as a friend it was never pleasant knowing she was depressed. \"Thanks...and if you want...\" \"If you're worried just ask him\" Petra interrupted, her tone dismissive \"can't do any harm...\" With that she walked away. 'Easier said than done' Ender thought 'he's impossible to get hold of...' Ender's chance came after the last class of the day, his first since it was the only one he was expected to attend. By chance Rackham had been stopped by Colonel Graff and both were talking in low tones in the corridor. Ender paused for a minute, trying to see if he could catch what they were saying but they kept their voices too quiet. Upon hearing his approach Graff glanced round, muttered something else and moved away, giving no acknowledgement towards Ender as he walked past. \"Sir?\" Rackham had started away himself but turned at the request \"What is it, Wiggin?\" \"Can I talk with you?\" \"As long as it is a talk and not some illegitimate excuse to get me on my own\" Ender tried not to smile and coughed instead. \"It is...\" Rackham nodded and led him back to his office; he pushed Ender in ahead of him and closed the door quietly. \"Sir...\" Rackham held up a hand \"Don't say anything...\" He leant against his desk; regarding Ender coolly \"I have a good idea of what you want to say and I don't want to hear it.\" Ender met his gaze; he didn't like what he read and knew he would hate what he was going to say even more. \"You know full well what happened was completely inappropriate and I am determined it will never happen again. Whatever your... our reasons there is no excuse for disregarding rules, I have ever tolerated misconduct and I don't intend to start now...especially if my own in slipping.\" Ender fumed, a heated flush tarnishing his cheeks, he clenched his fists behind his back and although he remained silent his frustration was clear. \"If you do try to instigate anything again I have no choice but to report you\" \"Wait a...\" \"Quiet! I know full well I gave in but I could easily forget to mention that and I am more likely to be believed than you, and I'm also old enough to supposedly know better...now go.\" He turned away, not wanting to see any reaction. He didn't actually miss much, Ender's eyes narrowed dangerously before he stormed over to the door. \"Bastard!\" He spat and slammed it hard behind him. Rackham stood motionless for a few minutes before sitting shakily and burying his head in his hands. Furiously Ender stormed back to his quarters and threw himself onto the bed, had there been a battle that evening he would have destroyed the enemy single handed. Instead his already limp pillow took the brunt of his anger before he covered his head with it. From beneath the thin material he heard a click that he was very familiar with but one he hadn't heard for some time. 'Lock me in all you want' he thought, peering from under the corner 'see if I care! I'd rather be here than out with the others anyway!' Would you? A voice deep within him questioned, were you ever alone at home when you were unhappy? 'No...' Ender closed his eyes 'I always had support, I always had Valentine or at least one of my parents...' And that's why you're angry! The voice continued chidingly. You aren't here because you really want to be and you know they don't want you to have anyone. You work it out yourself...and now you're facing something you struggle to solve when everything used to come so easy! 'I'm not struggling with anything...' Ender thought with a scowl 'things may be messed up at the moment but I'm not!' He fell into a sleep brought on by frustrated emotions, his mind still in a fog of mixed thoughts and moods. It was a dark dreamless sleep, but not one that cured tiredness. Rackham remained where he was for some time, he felt as if a new Formic War had started within him. He hadn't been this stressed for some time and part of him wished Colonel Graff still drank on the job, he could've finished a bottle of Vodka. Not that getting drunk ever helped, not when it came to the next day anyway. Being in denial of his feeling had become natural now and when they did try and make an appearance they hit hard. He got up, sitting around wasn't doing anything except leading him to dwell on things. It was the danger of working with the young, sooner or later they ask more than you can give...[Chapter 7] \"What the hell is the matter with you?\" \"I have a headache, other than that nothing is the matter.\" \"Headache or hangover?\" Rackham scowled and turned to the greying Colonel, keeping well despite his age but perhaps not as fit as he used to be. \"Unlike you, Graff, I don't keep bottles lying around\" He stalked off without waiting for a reply; Graff didn't follow, merely shook his head and went back to his own work. He hadn't got the time or the patience to worry about trifling matters. \"I was hoping to talk to you last night\" Bean said as they wandered out of class \"but I couldn't find you anywhere, I tried messaging you but you never replied.\" \"I was asleep\" Ender answered flatly \"and they'd locked me in so I couldn't have gone out even if I wanted to.\" \"They haven't done that in a while\" \"Yeah, well I'd pissed them off so I guess it's this places version of being grounded\" Bean gave a snort of laughter then his expression became serious \"Joking aside can I speak to you later? It's pretty important\" \"Sure, apart from training this morning I'm not set to do anything.\" Ender drifted off to the training area deciding to wait for Rackham there, he actually found himself dreading their meeting, his blood felt as if it had turned to ice and an uncomfortable nausea settled in his stomach. He couldn't remember feeling like this for some time and the mixture of anger and need combined wasn't helping. He was early and went straight in and sat on the springy black mat on the floor, a small cloud of dust erupted as he dropped his weight on it. He tried crossing his legs, the way Rackham often sat but after a few minutes his muscles began to cramp and tingle. \"I don't get it\" Ender grumbled to himself as he straightened his leg \"considering his age I should be able to this easily!\" \"That's because my practice is more dedicated than yours!\" Ender jolted at the sudden voice and jumped to his feet, Rackham stood by the door watching him coolly but Ender could have sworn there was a glint of amusement in his eyes. Ender's own eyes glanced down to the floor, after their last rather unsavoury encounter there was an obvious tension, at least to him there was anyway. \"Morning, Sir...\" Ender mumbled \"I daresay you've done nothing of note since I saw you last?\" Rackham said moving towards the weapon vault, ignoring Ender's greeting. \"I researched the weapons you showed me and I've tried with normal lasers to keep my hands steadier\" Ender retorted \"I don't laze around!\" Rackham smiled to himself and opened the door taking the same guns as before, he felt Ender's gaze fixed on him and tried to ignore the sudden nervous chill that coursed his veins. \"Then impress me\" he tossed over the gun \"the programmes consist of active holographs, miss one and you assume you die and if you remain stationary you can think the same.\" \"Well I won't\" Ender said \"I refuse to fail and I'll prove it!\" A fixed air of determination was engraved on his face; it was a shadow that often surrounded him when he felt troubled...it was safer. Despite his confidence the task was harder than he had anticipated; the holographic buggers were brutally fast and incredibly accurate in their own shots. Even with his skill Ender found himself struggling, incurring several bruises as he went, his lungs felt as if they would burst, a bitter iron taste tainting his breath. Finally though after what felt like hours the last creature had vanished and he allowed his legs to give in and collapse to the floor. \"Could be better...\" Rackham took the laser from him, looking it over carefully \"in a real situation you probably would have failed.\" \"I suppose that's almost a compliment coming from you\" Ender heard himself say \"Take it like that if you want\" Rackham replied \"although I still have doubts you actually take on board anything I say.\" He slotted the gun back into place and locked the door, he turned back to find Ender close behind him. \"What...?\" The next thing he knew his back hit the floor, forcing the air from his lungs. Ender moved quickly and sat firmly on his chest, pinning his arms to his side. \"First, disable the enemy\" Ender smiled, his intense eyes holding Rackham's captive, he slowly lay down, his body extending as gracefully as a cats. \"Second...\" Rackham tensed. Ender brought himself close enough for his lips to brush his ear \"Make sure you have complete command\" He closed his eyes and their lip met, unlike the first time this kiss was gentle, but eager. \"Third\" he continued, breaking breathlessly \"issue your demands\" \"And what are they?\" \"I want to make the most of what time I have with you\" Ender said after a moment \"when my training is through and they send me out I could die\" Rackham looked away. \"I know you'll never worship me the way I do you\" \"Believe me, Wiggin, the day I start worshipping you would be a very sad one indeed\" Ender shook his head, half sadly, half mischievously. \"Then my demands are you prove you're worthy of my devotion, Sir...you may have won an entire war but what have you done since?\" He idly fiddled with top button on Rackham's shirt. Taking advantage of the distraction Rackham threw Ender off, he pinned his legs with one of his own and leant awkwardly on his chest, focusing his weight on the left lung. \"Never give the enemy an opening...I thought better of you, boy\" Although his expression had hardly changed there was a noticeable sparkle in his dark eyes. Ender tugged at his firmly planted arm, the pain in his side preventing him talking, Rackham gave a minute smile and eased off. \"At least you've shown you've learnt something...\" He said sitting back \"I've learnt a lot...\" Ender rubbed his side \"just because I don't care about some of the things you say doesn't mean I don't listen.\" \"Go take a shower and head back to your room\" \"I'll shower if you come with me\" \"You know I can't\" Rackham sighed dismissively \"That's my demand...or one of them. I beat you and you are obliged to submit\" \"And I overthrew you\" \"Think about what you'll regret more\" Ender persisted, his voice slightly softer \"not obeying orders and regiment or not doing what your heart wants.\" Rackham seemed to flag, the only thing that could ever bend the iron will was emotion \"Do you have any idea what you're putting me through, Wiggin?\" \"Yes, and I don't care, you never did and you one said I'd thank you it...and so will you, Sir\" Rackham didn't respond but his gaze remained fixed on the boy before him. He couldn't help thinking of the ancient book Lolita but with a male lead. \"Just hold me then?\" Ender was at his side and nestled close so he could hear every beat of the others heart which sounded deafening in the silence. Slowly Rackham put his arm round him, stroking his shoulder gently. \"Think about what I said, Sir\" Ender whispered, quietly enough to be the nonexistent breeze in space \"don't abandon me.\" Still Rackham said nothing but Ender felt the tension in every muscle, with the inner turmoil raging like tsunami within Ender doubted his defences could remain standing much longer. He stood up and went to the door, Rackham stayed on the floor looking at something, anything, but him. \"You know where to find me if...when you want me\" he said letting the door close without sound behind him. \"Hey\" \"Hey\" Ender moved over and let Bean sit next to him \"you wanted to talk to me?\" Bean looked around the crowded dining area and shook his head \"Later, it's too loud here and I don't want anyone eavesdropping either\" he looked down at his food as if trying not to meet Ender's gaze \"come to my room after lunch, I can get rid of anyone in there and well talk then.\" Ender must have appeared bemused as Bean added in a lower voice \"It's just something I think you need to know concerning Petra, I know you talk to her sometimes...\" Ender nodded and finished up \"Don't take too long...\" \"It may be best if you didn't talk to Petra about certain...err...personal problems\" Bean said later when they sat on opposite beds. Ender's eyebrows knitted into a frown, Bean looked uncomfortable and fidgeted as if sat on stone. \"She likes you, you know that?\" \"I like her too, she's a good friend and a good ally\" Ender knew what Bean meant but acting dumb was sometimes easier, and it also but the other person in a more difficult position. \" More than that, you know what I mean Ender!\" Bean sounded annoyed \"she wanted me to talk to you and ask you to not ask her about certain things for a while.\" Ender felt himself go cold as if the blood had drained from his body \"What else did she say?\" He asked quietly \"Only that she knew you didn't feel the same which is why she wants to be left alone for a bit\" \"Nothing else?\" \"No, she's not a snitch; she won't tell me anything you spoke about if that's why you look so worried.\" Ender breathed a sigh of relief, he hadn't realised he'd even been holding his breath \"I don't know what to say...I feel as if I should speak to her but I think I may be the last person she wants to see at the moment. They never prepare us for things and feelings like this.\" \"That's what makes me hate them more\" Bean stood up \"just give her some space for a few days, then see if she wants to talk\" he smiled \"glad you understand, she was scared you wouldn't.\" 'Just another thing for me to worry about and understand' Ender thought but all he said \"See you later...\"[Chapter 8] Notes: Very sorry I have neglected to update, had several health problems which left me unable to do anything but hopefully I can get back on track now! As a friend pointed out I have altered the plot from the original but it is mainly to avoid copying it and it made it more interesting to write! \"I still think you ought to tell him\" \"That is nothing to do with you, besides in his current condition anymore strain may crack him...and he has that 'moral' streak in him.\" \"Thanks...\" Petra looked up from her game \"What for?\" \"Not telling Bean anything\" \"Oh\" she turned back to see her character die in puff of flame \"that's...no problem...\" Ender hesitated uneasily as she logged off, shifted his weight from one foot to the other. Petra watched him covertly from the corner of her eyes, some strands of loose hair making it impossible to him to notice. \"Was there something else?\" \"Up to you\" Ender said cautiously \"should we talk?\" \"It's up to you \" Petra answered sharply \"you're the commander...although I often wonder...you need to call a meeting and start planning strategy for the games coming up. You said they warned you to ones they programmed are going to be tough.\" \"Like you I've had things on my mind...I don't let you know everything as it wouldn't be fair\" Petra turned to face him with a sigh, her features softened as she breathed out and a small smile appeared. \"Sorry...I know you've had it rough and people are a lot harder on you\" She reached out and gave his hand a small squeeze, her own hand cool and soft compared to his own. \"There are things bugging me but I can work through them myself...I'm not a little girl and I don't want to burden you anymore.\" \"Well if you ever do I'm around\" Ender returned her smile briefly Ender felt ill. He'd woken up that night really as if his stomach had been torn open and his body drenched in a cold sweat but his skin was uncomfortably warm. How he managed to get back to sleep he had no idea but even so when he woke the next morning he felt as if he hadn't slept for weeks. \"No...\" he groaned as he rolled out of bed \"I can't be sick...\" His stomach seemed to have calmed but he felt as if there was an icy rope tangled round his throat and his heart seemed to be beating faster than normal. He sat on the floor and drew his knees up to his chest and tried to breathe as calmly and as normally as he could but thoughts of his training sessions that day made him feel worse. It had been a week since he had last had any one to one training, when he remembered his early days it seemed like nothing. He presumed it was because they had took him further than most maybe too quickly and too much would destroy what they had created. Whatever that was... It hadn't help that they had informed him his final test was fast approaching, they had rushed it forward for some reason. He spoke to no one during breakfast, giving one word answers to those that spoke to him, they soon got the message. He felt as if his head was in a thick fog as he made his way down the corridor which seemed to take him forever. 'If I can just get through this session I can shut myself away later' Ender thought but doubt formed a cloud, if was a big ask. Too much to ask. As Ender reached the door his body felt as if his blood had frozen, his muscles contracted and the mist thickened. He didn't even feel when he hit the floor. He was cold as he slowly came round; his skin tingled as if thousands of icy needles were pricking his skin. His eyes gradually came into focus, only to see the nothingness of the ceiling. The dark had been more appealing! Ender breathed out in relief, his heart and throat feeling normal again and slowly lifted his head \"Haven't seen an anxiety attack like that for some time, boy\" Ender looked round to see Mazer Rackham leaning against the wall, his dark eyes appearing oddly concerned. He realised then he was in his mentors' room, lying on the bed. \"You...brought me here?\" \"I found you on the floor and this was the nearest room to put you safely.\" Ender stared at him, conflicting emotions riding through him \"Thank you...\" he pulled himself up into a sitting position, Rackham's gaze not leaving him \"I'm glad it was you.\" \"I'm sure you are...\" Rackham's voice sounded flat but not as dismissive \"Why do never call me by my first name?\" Ender asked suddenly \"Because it isn't proper...at least you don't insist on calling me by mine now\" he gave a small smile \"you have learnt some respect.\" \"What time is it?\" \"Early evening\" Rackham replied, not bothering to check \"you've been out some time, I had to think of an excuse for you missing class.\" Ender nodded, if they had known he was sick it normally only meant trouble, his heart lifted slightly \"You must care about me then, Sir\" Rackham glanced away, his stance indicating he was uncomfortable with the statement. Ender frowned \"I'm cold...\" He shivered, his skin paler than normal \"Wiggin...\" Rackham almost sounded whiny \"Did you think about what I said? Now is the time to make your mind up.\" \"I did, for once I obeyed a student\" \"And?\" Ender looked at him intently, his adoration as clear as the stars outside \"My answer should be no\" Rackham met his gaze, his resistance beginning to waiver, his defences failing. Something he was unused to. \"Sir...\" Rackham held up a hand to stop the inevitable speech \"I said should be. God knows why it might not be, my feelings are ones that would get me thrown in jail...and you should know better also\" he sighed, a mix of frustration and desperation. Ender swung himself round and sat on the edge of the bed, searching for something, anything to say but his mind was blank. Rackham moved over and knelt on the floor beside him to be at his level \"Unfortunately for me you're very good at wearing me down, you happen to be the first student I have ever felt any affection for whatsoever.\" \"You hid it well\" Ender said quietly, he edged closer and put his arm round him \"you could just...hold me\" \"You're incredibly sly, Wiggin, you know full well...\" he paused and glanced away \"when you are stuck like this for years on end your lusts takeover...\" \"Then let them\" Ender whispered, his breath warm on Rackham's ear, he took hold of his collar, more gently than the first time but the power and dominance was still there. Ender pushed closer, his hand settling on Rackham's thigh. Rackham tried to protest but Ender shook his head and for once he was subdued, besides, he had nothing to say. Ender's hand moved higher to his crotch and playfully flicked the zipper, his eyes back to their usual brightness, intent and probing. Rackham got to his feet and, saying nothing, vanished into the bathroom. He leant against the wall with a sigh, his thoughts confused and pulling him in two directions. He glanced round at Ender who had followed cautiously \"You know my feelings, Wiggin...they are not the kind I deal with very often or easily\" \"I know...I read it...\" \"What do you mean you read it? If it is what I think then what the hell where you doing in my files anyway?\" A dangerous glint appeared and Ender hurried to offer an explanation...a fairly poor one \"I was bored...\" \"When I was your age and bored I used to work...\" \"I'm not you.\" \"No...You're not\" Rackham turned and looked at him for some time, no longer the young boy who had watched him with a mix of fear and awe. He was almost a young man, wise beyond his fourteen years and in better form than most. His gaze had changed and fear no longer resided in his eyes, worship merged with desire. Rackham had no idea what could be read in his own except they apparently revealed too much, abruptly he turned away. \"I can't! I can't lose control like this, I never do...\" \"Sir?\" \"Please...just go...you have more important things to do and catch up on any work you missed\" The request sounded more like a plea but his tone left no room for argument and Ender slowly backed away, his thoughts as confused as his body... ","Summary":" My first ever attempt and fanfiction, responding to a challenge from a friend! This is slash so if "},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"With No Lodestar in Sight","Author":"littlelindentree","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6875377","Passage":"[Chapter 1] I thought I had gotten True Grit (and particularly Mattie/LaBoeuf) out of my system with my last fic, but apparently not. I was listening to some Americana one night and Gillian Welch's murder ballad \"Caleb Meyer\" came on, and this idea got stuck in my head, and before I knew it I had a new story happening. Oops. This story is an adventure fic which takes place about five years after the action of the film, and aside from the darkness and violence in the prologue, considerably more lighthearted than my previous Mattie/LaBoeuf fic. As I said, it was inspired by \"Caleb Meyer\" and by Alela Diane's song \"The Rifle\" and also by Sarah Harmer's song \"Lodestar,\" from which it takes its title. The coming chapters will be significantly longer than the prologue. Also, I did slip in a couple of contractions for one character's dialogue, so I hope you'll forgive me for that choice. Warning: this prologue contains graphic violence, as well as subject matter which may be upsetting to those who have trigger issues with respect to sexual violence. Please don't read it if it will be upsetting for you. Mattie paused in the barn entranceway, and looked up at the wide blue sky. It was a perfect late September day, the kind that made a body glad to be alive. Strictly speaking, Mattie knew she ought not to be anything more than thankful for her health , and beyond that should only be glad that she was born to die, for only in heaven could she know true happiness. However, Mattie believed that God, creator of apple trees and wild geese and furry caterpillars with fat brown stripes on their backs as well as lovely September afternoons, must Himself appreciate a little admiration now and again, and so she was glad, and felt satisfied to leave it at that. As her gaze dropped from the sky and cast out over the fields in the distance, Mattie reflected that there was much to be thankful for. The kitchen garden had produced nicely, although Mattie thought the beans were on the spindly side. The cotton was in, and it was a handsome crop this year. The price they got, though not extravagant, was nothing to sneeze at. Mattie's mother and her siblings had gone to Little Rock to visit some cousins the week prior, but Mattie had stayed behind to see the cotton come in. She was not one for idle visiting when there was work that needed doing. Yes, the cotton was in, and that was the large part of the farm's work. But there were stores to lay in, and it was time to think about planting the winter garden, and about slaughtering the hog. There was always something to think about, always more work to do. Another thing to be thankful for. Latching the barn door behind her, Mattie swung the pail in her hand, and began to whistle a tune as she walked back to the house. It took her a moment to realise that it was one of the silly songs Marshall Cogburn and Mr. LaBoeuf used to sing and whistle on the trail of Tom Chaney, when they were into the whiskey (\"confiscated in evidence\") and had decided to tolerate one another for the time being. It had been nearly five years since the winter her father was murdered and she made the acquaintance of Cogburn and LaBoeuf. Although it had been a bloody and dangerous episode, and her arm had been the \"pound of flesh\" she paid for her vengeance, Mattie still thought of those days fondly. She often found herself wondering how both of her old trail \"pardners\" were faring. She had sent several letters over the years to places where she hoped one or the other might be, but had never received any word from either of them. Mattie walked past the woodshed, and looped her song back to its beginning, as she could not recall much else except the first verse. \"Whistling girls and crowing hens always come to some bad ends.\" Mattie stopped short and spun around in surprise at the sound of a voice. A man was leaning against the woodshed. He was dressed in brown trousers and a home-dyed blue shirt, and his boots looked road-worn. A cloth bundle sat in the dirt at his feet. Although his face was puffy and red, and he was in need of a shave, he was young, and his expression seemed kindly enough. \"Who are you?\" Mattie asked. \"This is private land. The thoroughfare that goes through the country does not pass through this property. The road is over there, if you look.\" \"My name is Cunningham,\" he replied, smiling easily. \"Albert Cunningham. I am looking for work. Is your father here?\" Mattie did not answer his question. \"Our cotton has already been brought in. We will not need any more hired men this season. If you carry on into town, you may have some luck. Or from there you will at least be able to make your way down the river to Morrilton or thereabouts, where there is most certainly work.\" \"That is a shame, for I do like this place,\" he said, continuing to lean against the woodshed as though he did not have a care for anything. His eyes dropped from her face to her arm, the one which had to be sawed off at the elbow. \"How'd a little girl like you end up like that? It still hurt you?\" Mattie did not reply to those questions, either, for they were impertinent and his presence was becoming tiresome. \"How I came to be the way I am is no concern of yours. There is no work to be had here. I can offer you some food, perhaps, but that is all.\" \"I know there is food. I have already been in the house,\" he replied. He stood up straight, and lifted a brown bottle to his lips which had heretofore been concealed at his side. The bottle's contents caught the light as he tipped it, a murky, yellowish-brown liquid sloshing about inside. Corn liquor or some other variety of moonshine, Mattie supposed it, although she had never seen any for herself. \"Then I must insist that you leave at once,\" Mattie said, a cold sensation gathering in the bottom of her stomach. Cunningham took a step towards her. He was only a head taller than she, but he was solidly built, and bested her weight by a wide margin. His hair was brown, and his dark blue eyes would have been nice except that there was a curious emptiness in them which Mattie could only see now that he stood close to her. They were bloodshot and yellowed from drink, as well. He looked out over the farm and sighed as though he was tired, his shoulders dropping. \"You are alone here,\" he said. It was not a question. His eyes finished their appraising circuit and landed on hers. All at once, Mattie knew he meant to harm her. With every ounce of strength in her good arm, she threw the empty bucket in his face and whirled around to run to the house. He swore and batted the bucket away, but he was too fast and was on her in an instant, grabbing the back of her dress and spinning her about to face him. With his right hand he slapped her in the face before back-handing her the other way, sending her tumbling to the ground. Dazed, Mattie tried to stand, but she felt something crack against her head, and bright lights flashed in her eyes like firecrackers. Glass rained on the dirt and sawdust around them, and Mattie realised as she collapsed once more that he had broken his bottle against her head. She touched her hand to the stinging wound, and it came away bloody. Roughly, Cunningham knocked her onto her back in the dirt, and when she kicked at him and scrabbled with her bloodied hand, he wrapped his hands around her neck and squeezed. Oh Lord , Mattie thought, I do not wish to die this way. It would break my mother's heart to find me like this. Mattie continued to hit and scratch at him as hard as she could with her hand, even as her vision dimmed horribly, the edges turning shimmery and black, the sound of her frantic heart pounding loudly in her ears. The man hissed in pain as she managed to scratch his face, and released her throat in order to restrain her arm, pinning it over her head. He gripped Mattie's wrist in one hand, attempting to cease her struggling. He squeezed, and Mattie felt the small bones grind together as his fingernails dug welts into her skin. Gasping at the pain, she felt panic and sorrow shiver through her. She could not dislodge him; he was too heavy and strong. Stretching her hand in a last attempt to free her arm, her fingertips brushed against something hard. It was the broken liquor bottle. Mattie ceased her twisting and went still beneath him. \"That's it,\" he muttered, and after a moment he let go of her wrist, pressing one forearm over her throat as the other began pulling roughly at her skirts. Swallowing the yell which crouched in her throat, Mattie took a deep breath and reached for the bottle, wrapping her fingers around its chipped neck. Once she had a firm grip, she did not hesitate. She brought the bottle down with all the force she could manage in her compromised position. Her sudden movement piqued his attention, and he lifted his head at the moment that the bottle connected with his jaw. Its jagged edge slid hard against the bone, and drove itself into the flesh of his neck. For a brief moment, Mattie thought he had turned and thrown up on her. She blinked hard, and found that he was looking right in her face as blood bubbled from his neck, coating her front with it. His eyes, though dull and yellowed by alcohol, registered his shock and dismay. He opened his mouth, but only a strange gurgling sound emerged from him, and Mattie flinched as blood and spittle sprayed her face. He slumped over her then, and went still. All was quiet. Mattie stared at the sky above, which was cloudless and tinged with pink and amber from the oncoming sunset. A lone crow flew across it, cawing. The freight train noise of her heart hammering in her ears began to abate. Stiffly, Mattie tried to sit up and move his limp form off of her. When she could not, she dragged herself out from under him instead, pulling herself free with a gasp. Turning, she looked at him. He was slumped awkwardly with one arm beneath him. His blood (and hers, she supposed) stained the sawdust all around in a grisly mess. He was utterly still, and did not appear to be breathing. Mattie did not want to get close enough to check. She shuddered hard, her stomach turning over so abruptly that for a moment her head swam dizzily, and she thought she might be sick. Swallowing, she slowly got to her feet and walked to the nearby water pump. She worked the handle, catching the water in a bucket. She washed her hand and her face, attempting to rinse away the blood – his and her own. There was nothing to be done about the front of her dress. Wiping her face and hand with the hem of her apron, Mattie walked up the back steps of the house and let herself into the kitchen. She opened the cupboard nearest the door and groped about on the highest shelf until she felt her fingers brush against a flour sack. She pulled it, and several bullets fell out, hitting the floor before rolling under the table. Her father's old Colt's dragoon pistol had been kept in that very place since the day she came home from Fort Smith. Collecting the bullets, she dropped them back into the sack, where they clinked metallically against the pistol. Clutching the flour sack in her hand, she left the house and closed the door behind her. Mattie strode across the yard and out into the road, and began walking in the direction of town. The sun sunk low into the horizon, and night began to fall. She walked faster, and did not breathe deeply until she saw the lights at the edge of town. She had killed the man, but he seemed to dog every step of the journey just the same.[Chapter 2] \"I see. And why did you not take a buggy or a wagon into town?\" Mattie suppressed an impatient sigh. She had explained the thing three times now in great detail for Sheriff Morris, who sat across his desk from her, stroking his oiled moustache. His deputy, Sutherland, a young man not much older than Mattie, stood by being very rude and blatant in his ogling of her. Mattie did not appreciate it, for his look was prurient. She knew she must look ghoulish, covered in dried blood as she was, but that was no reason for the fool to forget himself and gawk at her. \"I did not take the wagon because I had only just fed the horses,\" Mattie said, in answer to his question, \"and I feared the exercise would trouble their stomachs, which have been sensitive of late. They have been prone to colic, and I do not see the sense in creating more difficulties when I could just as easily walk to town. Also the business of tacking and hitching would have taken some time, as I am somewhat less able to be quick about such work than others.\" \"I see,\" replied the Sheriff. \"Now, tell me again – how came this man, Cunningham, to be on your property in the first place?\" Mattie was not one to sneer at an officer of the law, but the hour was late and she was weary from the evening's ordeal, and therefore had half a mind to pick up her father's pistol from where it sat on the desk and throw it directly in the man's face. There was a creak and a bang from the front door in the other room. The Sheriff looked pointedly at his deputy, and when he received no acknowledgement, he cleared his throat. Sutherland gave a little jump of surprise as he stood up straight, and made his way hastily out of the room. The Sheriff watched him go, an exasperated look on his face which reminded Mattie very distinctly of a tired bloodhound. There was a murmur of conversation from the other room, and Sheriff Morris turned his gaze back to Mattie. \"I believe you were about to explain how Cunningham came to arrive at your farm.\" Mattie did not manage to suppress her sigh this time. She embarked on her tale once again, and had got as far as Cunningham hitting her with the liquor bottle, when Sutherland reappeared in the office doorway. \"I am sorry to interrupt, Sheriff,\" he said, not looking at Mattie, \"but there is a... Well, there is a man and he has asked to see you. He will not speak with me.\" Sheriff Morris sighed. \"It appears that I will get no rest tonight,\" he said, standing up. \"Wait here, Miss Ross.\" Mattie made no reply, although privately she wondered why, if Sheriff Morris was so eager to be at home in his bed, he had induced her to repeat herself for no reason she could discern. The Sheriff left the door open behind him, but Mattie did not eavesdrop. Or she attempted not to, at least, until the raised voices in the other room made it impossible to avoid. \"I have been tracking Cunningham for several weeks, and yes, I would like to know why it is that I am to return to Texas empty-handed.\" The voice of the newcomer conveyed annoyance and self-importance, and was extremely familiar. Mattie stood and leaned out of the office to see the source of the commotion. Standing before Sutherland and Sheriff Morris, looking as foolish as ever in all his buckskin and fringe, was Mr. LaBoeuf. He continued to rant on about cooperation between jurisdictions and regions, and about the importance of the public safety. Mattie looked at him. He was the same as when last she saw him, although now at least he did not appear to be suffering from a partially severed tongue, or a blow to the head, or an errant bullet to the shoulder. When finally he paused in his speechifying (presumably to catch his runaway breath,) the deputy attempted meekly to explain what had transpired. The impatient look on LaBoeuf's face made Mattie's mouth quirk up in a smile, and she had to school her own face into a serious expression before she allowed herself to step out of the Sheriff's office. \"Mr. LaBoeuf? Are you the only Ranger in Texas available to chase outlaws into Arkansas, or is your reappearance in these parts pure serendipity?\" LaBoeuf turned sharply and stared at her. \"Miss Ross?\" \"Yes, it is I,\" she replied. LaBoeuf was across the room in two long strides, his spurs ringing against the floor boards. He grabbed her firmly by the shoulders. \"Are you injured? Whose blood is this?\" \"You need not worry; it is not my blood. Or, not much of it is mine. Most of it belonged to your Mr. Cunningham. You see, I am the reason you will be returning to Texas empty-handed.\" He stared at her uncomprehendingly for several seconds, and then he blinked and unhanded her, taking a step back as he frowned. \"I suppose it does not surprise me that you are to blame for that,\" he said. His voice seemed rather faint to Mattie. He continued to stare at her, bemused. After a moment, LaBoeuf reached out and clasped her chin, turning her face gently this way and that to see her bruised cheekbone and the cut on the top of her head. \"That is some mark he left on you,\" he said. His eyes examined her face, searching for other flaws and injuries, Mattie guessed. Finally his gaze rested on hers, and his hand dropped away. \"Are you otherwise hurt?\" \"I am only bruised, and there is a goose egg on my head where he broke his bottle over it. My throat is sore from the throttling he gave me, and I expect some bruises to appear there, as well,\" she replied. She held his gaze steadily as she continued. \"I was able to prevent him from harming me as he intended.\" LaBoeuf replied only by regarding her in silence. He shook his head. \"I would not have brought Cunningham back to Texas alive after all, then. I would have killed him myself if you had not.\" \"I appreciate the sentiment, but there is no need.\" \"Indeed,\" he said. He regarded her for another moment, the corner of his mouth drawing upwards in one half of a smile. \"Truly, it is a great pleasure to -\" \"Miss Ross,\" interrupted the Sheriff, \"why does it not surprise me to find that you are acquainted with the Texas Ranger out for the man you have just killed?\" \"I would not know why it does not surprise you, for I am not privy to your thoughts,\" Mattie replied tersely. \"But I certainly do not appreciate the implication that I am deserving of a reputation as some kind of scalawag! If you look at the thing rationally I think you will see that the opposite is true.\" The Sheriff blew a breath out of his jowls and frowned at her in apparent bewilderment. \"Well, I do not see what else can be done tonight. We will sort everything out once there is light enough to see by. I will come see you in the morning, Miss Ross, as will Mr. MacLeod, the undertaker.\" \"And what of me and my reward?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Well, you did not catch the man, so I suppose there will be no reward. You will have to take that up with the appropriate parties in your jurisdiction,\" the Sheriff replied. \"Now, see here -\" LaBoeuf began. Mattie hastily interrupted. \"Gentlemen, it would seem that since I was the one who caught the man, it is up to me whether I collect on any offered reward moneys.\" \"Yes, well, I guess we will see about all that tomorrow,\" said the Sheriff. \"I guess we will,\" Mattie replied. With that, she went into the office and recovered her father's pistol from the Sheriff's desk before striding purposefully past the Sheriff and out the door. Mattie was out into the dark street and heading back in the direction of the farm before she realised that LaBoeuf had followed her. He fell into step beside her. \"That Sheriff of yours does not offer much in the way of assistance.\" \"He would not be 'my Sheriff' at all if I had my way. He is a lazy man who is transparently disinterested in his own calling. He is lucky that the people of this region are generally peaceful, law-abiding folk, or else he would not be at liberty to be quite so idle,\" Mattie replied. \"I presume that this Cunningham hailed from Texas or Louisiana or some such place, and not from Arkansas.\" \"You presume correctly. He was from San Antonio.\" LaBoeuf paused for a moment, and then continued, his tone light. \"If Sheriff Morris is as incompetent as you say, you might find that after this episode, the 'peaceful, law-abiding folk' of Yell County may see fit to make you their Sheriff.\" Mattie stopped her walking and turned to face him. \"I see you are as garrulous as ever, Mr. LaBoeuf. Is there a reason you are following me? This has been a trying night and I would like to go home.\" \"Is your mother waiting for you there?\" \"My mother is in Little Rock with my brother and sister, visiting relations. They will not be back until the day after tomorrow.\" \"In that case, I will go with you to your home and remain with you until your family returns. You should not be alone,\" he said. \"Do not be ridiculous, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mattie replied. \"I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself. I do not need to be chaperoned in my own home.\" \"Of your capability I have no doubt, having witnessed sufficient evidence of it myself. But shooting a man on a mountaintop is a different matter altogether from slitting a man's throat in your own barnyard. You may find that you do not feel like yourself.\" \"I am not a little girl anymore,\" Mattie said drily. \"I do not need protection from the booger-man.\" \"Miss Ross, please,\" he entreated. \"Allow me to accompany you home, at the very least. It is dark and you have been through an ordeal. I will not feel right otherwise, if only as your friend.\" \"All right,\" Mattie relented. She suddenly felt weary beyond words, and longed to be tucked in her warm bed. The very thought of the journey home in the dark exhausted her. It galled her, but she did not have the energy to argue with him further. They turned and walked back to the Sheriff's, where LaBoeuf's horse was tethered. It was a different animal from the woolly Appaloosa he rode at the time of their last meeting. This one was a handsome piebald mare who was compact and strong-looking, with sound legs. She seemed good-spirited also, for she turned her head and greeted LaBoeuf with a soft nicker. \"I guess you did not ride here, unless you have hitched your mount someplace else,\" LaBoeuf said, glancing at Mattie as he untied the reins. \"You guess right. My horse has been colicky of late, and I did not want to bother her, as the roads are dry and clear, and it is just as simple to walk.\" He frowned at her for a moment, giving his head a shake. \"I am certain that you are about the only person alive who, having nearly been throttled and bludgeoned to death, would elect to walk for assistance so as not to bother your horse.\" Mattie did not see the foolishness he seemed to imply. \"Despite being rather chewed up, I could still stand a short journey. What I could not stand was the thought of any of our horses needlessly perishing from colic simply because I was feeling delicate.\" LaBoeuf seemed ready to argue, but some second thought seemed to stop him, and he did not reply. Instead he took his horse by her reins and turned her around so that Mattie was at her near side. \"This is Sal. Do you have some trick to mounting a horse one-armed and unassisted, or may I be so bold as to offer you a leg up?\" he asked, his tone now verging on the ironical. Mattie shot him what she hoped was a withering look. \"If you would be so courteous as to bring her close to this fence,\" she replied, gesturing at the rails behind her, \"I will not have to trouble you for a leg up.\" She turned then and scaled the fence, perching herself on the top rail while keeping her feet on the lower. LaBoeuf brought a perplexed but obedient Sal close, and Mattie stuck her left foot in the stirrup, grabbed the horn, and swung herself on before he could say another word about it. \"Still riding astride, I see,\" he said, almost under his breath. He gathered Sal's reins and led her out into the street. Mattie pursed her lips, ready to give him a tongue-lashing, when a thought occurred to her. \"How do you plan on mounting, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" He glanced up from beneath the brim of his silly rodeo clown hat, and gave Mattie a curious look she did not recognize. After a moment, he looked down and cleared his throat. \"I will walk. I have been on the road for several days, and Sal could use the rest. Thankfully I too could use a rest, but from the saddle, on my part.\" \"Now who is putting his horse's well-being before his own?\" Mattie asked. She sensed her tone contained equal measures of mirth and scorn. Even as she prodded him, she hoped he did not truly take offense. LaBoeuf looked up at her again, and smiled. He shrugged his shoulders before looking back out at the road. \"I reckon I am guilty of that, yes.\" After that, they were like old friends again. They made their way slowly up the dark road, telling stories about the things they had seen since last they met. Mattie told LaBoeuf about their cotton crop, and horses she had bought, the second storey they added to the house last spring, and about the prize Little Frank had won at the county fair for the handsome red bull calf he had raised himself. LaBoeuf, in turn, told her many (probably tall, she surmised) tales of life as a lawman in west Texas, about train robbers and sleeping under the stars, and about card games and disputes about land and cattle. Mattie listened as he talked, watching fireflies flicker in the darkness before them. For the time it took Sal to walk them from town to the edge of the Rosses' property, Mattie almost forgot about the earlier brutalities of the day. LaBoeuf walked Sal up the oak-lined road which led to the house, and tethered her to one of the front porch rails. The yard was dark and utterly silent, for there was not even a breeze to stir the yellowing leaves on their dry stems. Mattie shivered, and hoped LaBoeuf did not see. Certainly he said nothing as Mattie allowed him to help her down from the horse. He looked at her in the blue light of the moon for a moment, and then he cleared his throat and looked about the yard. \"Do you have a lantern?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Mattie replied, moving around him to scale the porch steps and retrieve a punched tin lantern from where it sat in the shelter of the parlour window sill. She brought it to him, and watched as he reached into his breast pocket and withdrew a match with which to light the lantern. The match head flared, illuminating his face for a brief moment. It reminded Mattie of the very first time she ever saw him, sitting outside the boarding house in Fort Smith, looking very proud and silly in all his cowboy folderol. Swallowing a lump in her throat, Mattie looked down. She had not thought that approaching the dark, silent yard would stir up such trepidation in her. Privately, she was grateful that she was not alone, although she did not know how exactly to tell him so. Nor did she understand why it was that she did not want to. \"Where is the body?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"We must find a place to stow it until the sheriff decides whether I may take it back to Texas. The bounty did not stipulate that the man must be alive, which is a lucky turn for me.\" \"I left him by the woodshed,\" Mattie replied, pointing. \"I do not want to put him in the barn; it will spook the horses. I suppose we could put him in the ice house, if he is securely wrapped. We have old sheets which could be used.\" \"Yes, that will do,\" LaBoeuf said. He started towards the woodshed, and Mattie followed him. He glanced at her. \"You need not trouble yourself. I will take care of the man.\" Mattie ignored him, and LaBoeuf seemed about to make another protest when they turned the corner of the woodshed and stopped short. Cunningham was gone. The signs of their struggle remained – the dirt and woodchips were scattered about and stained with much blood, and broken glass littered the ground. But Cunningham himself was gone. LaBoeuf lifted the lantern to widen the circle of light it threw. \"This is the place?\" he asked. \"Yes,\" Mattie replied, her throat dry. \"Yes, I left him right here. He was not moving or breathing, and I left him here, face down. He was dead, Mr. LaBoeuf! Where... That is, how...?\" Mattie spun around and searched the yard, but it was too dark to even see if he had left a trail. The woods beyond were impenetrably dark as well, and silent, except for the croaking chorus of frogs, and the distant hoot of an owl. Mattie swallowed. What if he had gone into the house and hidden himself there? What if he had fled into the woods? What if he was watching them right this instant, vulnerably illuminated as they were in the darkness by the light of their lantern? LaBoeuf was staring down at the ground in puzzlement. His thoughts seemed to follow hers, for he glanced at her, his expression tense. He stood close to her and said under his breath, \"Do you still have your father's pistol?\" \"I do.\" LaBoeuf nodded, and abruptly took her hand in his. Mattie did not have time to protest, for he turned and pulled her back to the front of the house. Sal was still tied to the porch rail, happily ripping up what grass she could reach with her long neck. Not pausing or letting go of her hand, LaBoeuf untied Sal and lifted Mattie onto her with one smooth movement. He led the horse out into the middle of the yard before stopping and pressing the reins into her hand. \"Are there any other guns in the house?\" he asked. \"Yes. There are two rifles in the front room, Papa's and Little Frank's. It is the room immediately on the right, and the rifles are in the rack on the far wall.\" \"I remember the lay of the place,\" he replied. He glanced up at her, and Mattie did not like the worried look he gave her. \"Tie the reins around the horn, and have your pistol at the ready. I must leave you without a light, and search the house. If you hear any noise or commotion, ride straight into town and fetch the sheriff. Do not come into the house, and do not look back.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf, really -\" Mattie began, but LaBoeuf cut her off. \"Miss Ross, you must promise me that you will take Sal and get out of harm's way. Cunningham could be in the house, armed, and if anything should happen to you...\" He looked at her, and he seemed troubled. \"Well, it is much simpler if you go at the first sign of trouble.\" He did not give her a moment to promise or refuse. LaBoeuf turned and walked back to the house, grabbing his Sharps-Carbine from where he had leant it against the porch. Mattie watched as LaBoeuf climbed the porch steps and entered the house, the lantern in one hand and the gun in the crook of his elbow. She held her breath as she watched the light bob from room to room. Sal shook her head, the metal and leather of her large bit slapping as she blew out an impatient breath. Mattie wanted to say something, or pat her neck in reassurance, but she could not. Fear had stunned her. The light reappeared on the porch, and then moved towards her as LaBoeuf walked across the yard. Soon he was at her side once more, taking the reins. He did not speak as he led her back to the house, where he helped her down once again from the saddle. \"He is not in the house. I have barricaded the back door and lit the fires. Is there any other way to gain entry to the house?\" he asked, securing Sal once more to the porch rail. \"No, there is not,\" Mattie replied. \"You checked the cellar?\" He nodded. \"There is nothing down there but some fastidiously organized stores.\" Mattie could not tell whether he was complimenting her or poking fun, but either seemed untimely, and she frowned. When LaBoeuf reached down to grab her hand again, she pulled her fingers free. \"I do not need your assistance to walk. I am not an invalid,\" she said. \"Very well,\" LaBoeuf replied. He went back up the porch steps, leading her into the parlour. He had built up a fire in the little woodstove, and lit the kerosene lamp on the polished cherry wood table her father had made for her mother one Christmas. The two rifles from the office were leaning against the settee. \"I am going to search the barn and get Sal squared away. I will return shortly.\" With that, he turned and departed, lantern and gun in hand. Mattie followed him, watching as he closed the door behind him. She was alone in the creeping silence of a house which had never seemed anything but welcoming to her before. Perhaps Mr. LaBoeuf had not been wrong about not feeling like her usual self, Mattie thought. Sighing and blinking back the ache which crouched behind her eyes, Mattie became intimately aware of the crust of dried blood still sticking her dress and her shimmy to her skin, as well as the dirt and bits of sawdust still stuck in her hair. She walked down the hallway into the kitchen, where she found another fire burning in the cook stove. Mattie checked the reservoir and was relieved to see that there was plenty of hot water left in it. She was relieved she would not be forced to go outside to the pump. Mattie filled a tin basin with hot water and carried it carefully out of the kitchen, intending to go upstairs to her bedroom to clean herself and change her clothes. She stopped short at the bottom of the stairs. It was dark at the top; LaBoeuf had not left any lights burning up there. She pursed her lips in brief contemplation, and then walked down the hallway to her mother's bedroom, and shut the door behind her. In the daylight, all of this would seem very silly, she knew. But for now, she would simply have to make do. After unpinning her hair from its knot and letting it tumble down around her shoulders, Mattie unbuttoned her bodice and peeled the stiff material away from her skin. She frowned at the state of her shimmy and corset, stained ugly brown with blood. Her skin too was covered with little flecks of the stuff where it had dried. She shuddered, and reached for the soap on her mother's washstand. Once she had washed and dried herself, and combed and picked the dirt and sawdust from her hair, and rinsed it with more fresh water, she went to the small cupboard where her mother kept her clothing. There she found a clean nightgown, and her mother's woollen heart-warmer which she kept for cold winter nights. It was not winter, nor was it particularly cold, but after Mattie held it to her face and inhaled the familiar scent of her mother which clung to it, she threw it around her shoulders and knotted it in place. Mattie stopped and looked at the rusty-coloured water pooled in the bottom of the basin. She hesitated a moment, then shook her head. She would dispose of it in the morning, in the daylight. She returned to the parlour and sat on the settee, curling her legs up underneath her. It felt good to be out of her dirty clothes, and the heat radiating from the stove began to settle into her skin, dispelling the shivers which had been threatening her. In silence she examined one damp lock of her hair, passing it between her fingers as it dried into a long curl in the warmth of the fire. She thought about how she had brushed and combed it that morning, and struggled to pull it into a halfway tidy knot before accepting that it would only ever look imperfect without her sister's assistance. She had not expected to see another living soul that day, so she had not thought it much mattered. LaBoeuf returned then, closing and locking the front door behind him. \"Miss -\" he began, but his words dropped off as he paused in the doorway, staring at her. Mattie stared back at him, frowning. He was looking at her most queerly, his brows drawn together and his mouth ajar as if he had been interrupted. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Mattie asked. \"Are you all right?\" LaBoeuf seemed to return to himself then, and he cleared his throat and came into the room. \"He is gone, that is certain,\" he said, removing his hat and sitting down in the chair across from her. He looked exhausted. \"I searched every part of that barn, and every other building on the property, and there is no sign of him except at the woodpile. I expect he must have come to his senses after you fought him off and fled into the woods.\" \"'Come to his senses'?\" Mattie exclaimed. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, he bled all over me like a shoat! You saw the state of the place. I do not understand how I did not kill him. I thought I surely had.\" \"I will find him. In the meantime, I will stay here. It is a mere precaution, so do not be alarmed. A coward such as Cunningham is not likely to return here to harass you. Not after the walloping you gave him.\" Mattie regarded him, mulling over the contradiction with which he had just presented her. Did he believe she was in need of his protection, or not? \"I suppose that is comforting, after a fashion,\" she replied finally, frowning. LaBoeuf sat back in the chair and commenced to filling his pipe. \"Have you eaten recently, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked, watching as he meticulously tapped tobacco down into the deep bowl of the pipe. \"I ate on the road, before I got to town. I reckoned I would not find a boarding house in time for supper,\" he replied. \"Would you like some coffee, then?\" He looked up at her. \"Although I appreciate your efforts, you need not trouble yourself to play hostess on my behalf.\" \"It is no great trouble, if you would like some.\" \"Truly, I am fine. All I require at this time is a place to sit, and my pipe, if you do not mind it.\" Mattie shrugged, and settled back against the settee as she watched him light his pipe. She tried to imagine what her mother would have to say about sitting with Mr. LaBoeuf in this way, practically in her inexpressibles. She hoped that, given the circumstances, her mother would forgive her. \"How long have you been on the trail of Mr. Cunningham? And for what crime, for that matter?\" Mattie asked, idly combing her fingertips through the ends of her hair. She felt a pang of longing for Victoria. Although Mattie did her best to be self-reliant, and could manage a brush and a comb reasonably well, braiding and pinning up her hair with but one hand had proved nearly impossible. Their tempers were very disparate, hers and Victoria's, yet braiding and twisting Mattie's hair up together had become something of a morning ritual between them. Mattie had missed her little sister while she'd been gone. Her hair was a half-pinned catastrophe without her, and Mattie did not like it, for she valued a tidy appearance. \"I have been in pursuit of Cunningham for two months now,\" LaBoeuf replied, pulling methodically on his freshly lit pipe. \"He turned up in the El Paso area in the spring and made a nuisance of himself in generally the same way I gather he was attempting to do here. He was on the hunt for work, that is certain, but he seemed to find more liquor bottles and crooked card games than obliging employers. In any event, he was caught raiding a corn crib and came to blows over the matter with the owner of said corn, a man named Cartwright. He shot Cartwright and lit out. In earnest, we did not give much thought to pursuing him until we gathered through various channels that he was wanted in San Antonio for another charge of murder, as well as numerous crimes related to stock thievery, which is, I reckon, the vocation he has chosen for himself.\" That Cunningham was a stock thief hailing from San Antonio caused some string to be plucked in her memory, but Mattie did not have a moment to pursue it, for LaBoeuf continued. \"When I learned that there was a price on the man's head, and that he had connections in Arkadelphia and Pine Bluff, I elected to pursue him. I do not believe I am boasting when I say that I have earned myself something of a reputation for always getting my man, one way or another.\" \"Hm,\" Mattie replied. \"And is money so dear a thing to you?\" \"What, do you find no practical use for money? I would someday like to retire from the business of chasing outlaws from pillar to post, and have myself a wife and a home. Both of these enterprises require some degree of financial security, I think you will agree.\" LaBoeuf began to talk about rewards he had pursued, as well as some tales of his regular work with the Rangers. Mattie listened in silence for some time, but soon felt her eyelids growing heavy, the exertions of the day weighing on her. She knew she ought to retire to Mama's bedroom, but it was warm here, and the way LaBoeuf's flat Texas drawl rolled over his stories with great leisure was rather soothing. The thought of getting up and walking down the hallway to sleep in that dark room did not appeal to her. Before she could make a deliberation in the matter, her eyes slid closed and she fell into a strange half-sleep. She was still aware of her surroundings, of the fire in the stove and of LaBoeuf's low voice, yet she began to dream all the same. In her mind's eye she saw before her the tin basin she had left on her mother's washstand, filled with dingy, blood-tainted water. There was a rag on the rim of the basin whose end dipped down into the water. As Mattie watched, tiny grey mushrooms began to sprout from the damp rag, coiling together in a forest of furry, finger-like trees. They grew taller and fatter, eventually sprouting little shoots which resembled arms more than branches. Their growth accelerated, and soon they were the size of summer squash, their bulk knocking the basin from the washstand, the remnants of the water splashing over Mattie's feet. They were enormous now, too big for the room, filling it and pressing against the creaking beadboard ceiling. Mattie turned towards the door to flee, but the fungus had already claimed it, sealing the exit with its foul-smelling, yellowish grey flesh. With a jolt, Mattie awoke herself from the weird vision. She swallowed the lump in her throat and clenched her jaw, breathing heavily through her nose to slow her racing heart and prevent herself from gasping aloud. She blinked up at the ceiling as her eyes adjusted to the dim light. It was still night, and the lamp was lit, casting the room in swatches of warm golden light and long shadows. She had no reckoning of how much time had passed. A spider scuttled along the ceiling directly above her head before reaching the wall and disappearing into a space between the boards. Not wanting to let on that she was awake, Mattie turned her head slightly and observed through slitted eyes that LaBoeuf was sitting in the chair across from her, the lamp on the table beside him. His rifle leaned against the chair. His pose was relaxed, and there was an open book resting on his chest, which he was reading. He was frowning. Mattie tried to make out the shining gilt title on the leather spine, but she could not. \"I see you peering at me there, Miss Ross,\" LaBoeuf said, without looking up from his book. When Mattie did not reply, he glanced at her. \"You are troubled by unpleasant dreams.\" Needled, Mattie sat up, gathering the wool heart-warmer close around her shoulders. A quilt – one of Victoria's cozy but aesthetically imperfect creations – had been thrown over her. She pulled her knees up to her chest and glowered at him. \"You ought to have woken me,\" she said, somewhat indignantly. \"I have seen you asleep before,\" he replied. Mattie looked at him sharply, a curt retort forming on her lips. His expression was tiresomely reasonable, however, and Mattie could see he meant nothing by it, bold as he was. \"In any case,\" he continued, \"after all that has happened, rest is what you require. You became quite noisy in your sleep. You were having a nightmare.\" Mattie felt her face flush in embarrassment. Although one's dreams could not be helped and were therefore nothing to be bashful about, the thought of LaBoeuf watching her thrash involuntarily in her sleep discomfited her. \"It is nothing,\" she replied flatly, after a moment. \"You need not always be stoic, Miss Ross. You are not made of metal.\" LaBoeuf looked down at the book in his hands, contemplating its open pages for a moment before closing it and setting it aside. \"You are human, made of skin and bones like any other. It is not weak to be afraid after what has happened to you today.\" Mattie rested her chin on her knees, hugging them to her chest as she regarded him. \"It is not weak to be afraid because I am a woman, you mean.\" \"Precisely.\" \"Hm. And would it be a sign of weakness for you to be afraid, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"I suppose it would be, but that is another matter altogether.\" \"How is it another matter altogether? You know better than most what I am capable of. I do not see how it is any more acceptable for me to tremble in the face of danger than it is for you.\" LaBoeuf fixed her with a look which was, at once, both troubled and exasperated. \"Miss Ross, do not be obstinate. I only mean to express that, if you are upset by what you have been through today, there is no shame in it. Furthermore, it would hardly factor into my estimation of your character, which is, incidentally, quite high. So you need not punish me with that sour look you are giving me any longer.\" \"All right,\" Mattie said, after a pause. She felt she had been talked into a corner, and did not much care for it, but it was the middle of the night and it seemed silly to argue. She continued to observe him, holding her knees to her chest. \"Although it has been a long time since last we saw one another, we have still been acquaintances for some time. Formalities seem unnecessary, under the present circumstances. You may call me Mattie, if you like, rather than Miss Ross.\" \"All right, Mattie,\" he said, nodding. His eyes did not leave her face, and Mattie cleared her throat and stood up, looking away. \"I will say goodnight.\" Mattie retrieved a candlestick from the sideboard and returned to the table to light it, using the flame already lit on the lamp. As she did so, she caught a glimpse of the book in LaBoeuf's hands, which he was occupied with reading once again. It was Little Men , one of the many novels she and Victoria shared and in which Little Frank had scarce interest. \"That is a favourite of mine, and my sister's,\" she said. LaBoeuf looked up from its pages and raised his eyebrows at her. \"I thought you said goodnight,\" he replied in a teasing tone. \"Oh, indeed,\" she said, glowering at him as she straightened and made her way out of the room. \" Goodnight , Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Goodnight, Mattie,\" came his reply. She could hear the amusement in his voice as she strode down the hallway with her light held in front of her. It seemed that Mr. LaBoeuf had gone from simply looking ridiculous to acting it as well. Entering Mama's bedroom, she saw the basin on the washstand, and hesitated. After a beat, she shook herself and put down the candle. LaBoeuf was not the only one acting ridiculously. She put the basin out in the hallway, and then closed and latched the door. She did not dream of the mushrooms again.[Chapter 3] Big huge thanks to allgreycats for giving this chapter the once over for me. 3 The morning dawned clear and crisp, and Mattie was up with the sun. Her body was wrapped in aches she had not felt last evening, as though during the night her whole self had become one large, tender bruise. It made washing and dressing uncomfortable, and pinning her hair up purely impossible. She settled for brushing it out and leaving it hanging down her back in one long fall. She was glad for the bright daylight which flooded the house, for it threw great, reasonable light into every corner, making her fearfulness in the night seem all the more foolish. It allowed her to go up to her bedroom and dress herself in her own clean clothing. Dressed and scrubbed and combed as best as she could hope to be, Mattie gathered an armful of wood for the kitchen stove and got the breakfast fire going. She fetched water for coffee, and emptied the basin of bloody water down the privy. She led the horses out into their paddock, and milked the cow before letting her and the little red bullock out to graze as well. She shooed the chickens out into the yard to scratch for bugs, and collected the eggs she could find. She then filled a washtub with cold water and vinegar, and put all her bloodied clothes in to soak. Inside, she prepared a sheet of biscuits, sliced several thick pieces of salt pork and set them to frying, and made a small pan of grits. She boiled coffee as well, for although she still did not care for it herself, she did like the perfume it gave the air as it percolated. After all this, LaBoeuf had still not risen. Mattie was surprised; in the brief time she had spent with him on the trail of Tom Chaney, he had been the earliest of risers. She went upstairs and rapped on the door to her brother's bedroom. Receiving no answer, she opened it, and found that the room was empty. Frowning, she came back downstairs, and as she passed the parlour doorway, caught sight of a pair of red wool socks with feet in them. LaBoeuf was laid out flat on the parlour rug, fast asleep and snoring. Mattie paused in the doorway, observing him. He had removed his boots, his coat, and his vest, and had unbuttoned the top button of his faded chambray shirt. His suspenders were shrugged off, and he lay with his hands resting on his middle and his coat bunched under his head. His Sharps-Carbine lay next to him, neatly parallel to his body. He was perfectly still, and aside from his noisy snoring, Mattie thought he rather resembled a corpse laid out for a wake. It was a singularly disturbing thought. She cleared her throat, and he was awake in an instant. \"Is everything all right?\" he asked, sitting up and blinking blearily at her. \"Yes,\" she replied. \"Only you might have slept upstairs in Little Frank's bedroom. I thought that would be obvious to you or else I would have said as much. I apologise.\" \"No apology is necessary; you have not been negligent in your duties as hostess. I slept here deliberately, for I wanted to be at the ready if Cunningham returned.\" \"I see.\" LaBoeuf scrubbed a hand over his face, and then paused, his face forming a quizzical expression. \"Is that salt pork I smell? And coffee?\" \"Yes. I thought after your days sleeping rough on the road, you would want a proper breakfast. It will be ready shortly, if you wish.\" Before he could reply, Mattie turned and left the room. She was frying eggs when he appeared in the kitchen. He helped himself to a basin of hot water and went out the back door, heading in the direction of the privy. Through the window, Mattie could see him crouching by the water pump, using a mean-looking bowie knife to shave, the way another man would a straight razor. He used a small piece of looking glass to see his work, and Mattie was unsurprised to find that he was no less vain now than he had been when they met. Finally he finished with his preening and came back inside; his skin was pink and his hair and whiskers damp. He took the plate of food and the hot coffee Mattie handed him with a funny sort of smile on his face, as though she were performing an entertaining and unexpected trick. Ignoring him, Mattie served herself and sat down across from him at the rough hewn table there before the cook stove. He almost dug in before her say so, but she interrupted him by bowing her head and saying aloud a prayer of thanksgiving. When she finished, LaBoeuf looked both admonished and annoyed. Mattie's thought was this: LaBoeuf ought to spend less time bird-dogging riff-raff and more time in church if he thought himself too big and important to even say grace. They ate in silence for several minutes. \"This is very good,\" LaBoeuf remarked after a time, not looking up from his plate. Mattie examined the cowlick at the crown of his head. It stood up as proudly as ever, in spite of the combing he had obviously subjected it to. \"You say that as though you are surprised,\" she replied. \"Did you doubt my abilities as a cook?\" He shook his head in apparent amusement. \"I am beginning to think that in addition to death and taxes, one might also rely on your orneriness. A man could set his watch by its regularity. Do you not know how to graciously accept a compliment when it is presented to you?\" Mattie eyed him for a moment, and then cleared her throat. \"No, I suppose I do not.\" LaBoeuf paused in his eating and regarded her across the table. \"Well, you ought to learn. These biscuits are some of the best I have had. Certainly they are a mighty improvement on the meals at the Monarch in Fort Smith, if you remember. And if you disagree with me on that score, then I do not know.\" Mattie grimaced and nodded her agreement. \"Yes, I always did feel cheated at that place, and I would not recommend it to anyone headed to those parts. Mrs. Floyd was kind enough, I suppose, although she did give the first free room to a newcomer when I was already doubled-up with an old woman who variously robbed me of my share of the bedclothes and infected me with a cold.\" \"Haw!\" he said. \"I do not know whether I am heartened or dismayed to find that you are as saucy as ever you were.\" Mattie did not know how to respond to such a statement, and so remained silent and carried on eating her breakfast. \"How are your injuries treating you this morning?\" LaBoeuf asked, after a spell. \"They are treating me about as well as can be expected,\" Mattie replied. \"My head aches some and I am sore in general, but otherwise I am without complaint.\" LaBoeuf nodded in reply to this, and then his eyes dropped to her neck. In spite of the high lace collar of her dress, the bruises which mottled the skin red and blue were still visible. Feeling scrutinized, Mattie looked down at her plate. \"I believe I will see if I can pick up Cunningham's trail today,\" LaBoeuf said, scraping up the last of the grits on his plate. \"I expect he fled into the woods to lick his wounds, so to speak.\" \"What is your plan?\" Mattie asked. \"My plan is to see whether he survived the night, and then determine where he might go next if he is not dead.\" \"I see,\" Mattie said simply, and they finished their meal in silence. LaBoeuf thanked her for the food and disappeared back to the front of the house. Mattie guessed he intended to clean his rifle or some such; she did not bother with him, for she had chores to do. After washing and wiping the breakfast dishes, she tidied the kitchen and replenished the wood and water by the stove. She was halfway across the yard with the slop pail, headed in the direction of the barn, when LaBoeuf reappeared, following her out the kitchen door. He was fully dressed in his buckskin coat and his hat, and he wore his revolver and had the Sharps-Carbine in the crook of his elbow. \"I am going,\" LaBoeuf announced, looking at her expectantly. It was obvious that he wanted her to question him so that he could bedevil her with deliberately perplexing responses. Mattie figured the most certain way to disappoint him was not to question him at all. \"I do not expect to be gone very long,\" he continued. \"All right,\" she replied, and carried on her way up to the barn, the heavy bucket of slops swinging against her leg with each step. When she had finished feeding their two hogs, she walked back down to the house and found that LaBoeuf had gone. Mattie did not resist the smirk that pulled at her mouth. The man was as much a popinjay as the morning he appeared in her room at the Monarch boarding house and attempted to intimidate her. Big spurs and all, he had not changed. Mattie set about dealing with her befouled clothing from the previous day. She built a large fire outside the lean-to in the yard which they used as their summer kitchen. She drew many buckets of water from the pump, pouring them into the large black iron kettle they kept for dirty, heavy jobs. It was hauled out several times a year for the making of soap, and vinegar, and for rendering hog fat. Soon the water was boiling, and Mattie fetched her blood-stained dress, her shimmy, and her corset from the house, and dropped them in. She boiled them, stirring the water occasionally with an old broom handle. She had been stood there minding her work for some time when LaBoeuf emerged from the woods. He was encumbered with a small wild turkey, which dangled limply from his hand by its two feet. \"Hidy,\" he said, laying his burden out a few feet from the fire before seating himself on a nearby section of tree trunk used as a stool. He commenced to filling his pipe with tobacco with a very satisfied expression on his face. When Mattie continued to ignore him, he cleared his throat. \"I might have shot you some of those fat geese flying over if I had my bird dog with me,\" he said, cocking his head in the direction of the northern sky. \"You need not be too sorry about it, for although that turkey is mighty scrawny, to add a goose or two would have been pure gluttony. There are only two of us here, unless you are expecting guests of which I am unaware.\" \"You ought to get a dog,\" LaBoeuf said, ignoring her criticisms. \"A farm is not a farm without a dog to guard it and its inhabitants.\" \"I did not know that your designation as a Texas Ranger afforded you the wisdom to make recommendations as to how cotton farms ought to be run,\" Mattie replied. \"You know that I am right, but as is your way, you do not want to own to it. That is fine; we both know it, and that satisfies me.\" LaBoeuf paused here and lit his pipe using a long twig he poked into the hot coals of the fire. \"I found the place where I believe Cunningham made camp in the night.\" Mattie stopped turning her clothes over in the water. \"You did?\" \"I did. I followed the crick back into the woods, and about half a mile in, I found the remnants of a cook fire as well as some bloodied strips of sacking I guess he used to staunch his wound. In the fire were scattered the bones of what looked to be a squirrel or perhaps a small groundhog, and so I reckon he was fit enough to snare himself some supper. The ashes were cold and he was long gone, however. My guess is that he left at first light.\" Mattie regarded him for a moment, considering this. \"Do you think he has gone away altogether?\" \"I reckon so, yes,\" LaBoeuf replied, his eyes on hers. \"I do not think you need to fret that he will return to this place. You scared him off.\" \"I do not fret that he will return. I am only concerned that none of the eggs or chickens go missing in the night,\" Mattie said, stirring the clothes once more in the water before pulling them up on the end of the broom handle to examine them. It would be impossible to tell how the stain would affect her dark blue dress until it dried. If it showed, the dress could always be dyed a dark brown or black to hide it. The stain in the corset had come out reasonably well, and in any case the garment was old and worn, and Mama had commented recently that Mattie ought to have a new one. The shimmy, however, was a lost cause. The stain had faded somewhat, but a large, diluted brown splotch remained on its front. It would only be good for rags, or perhaps for some part of a future scarecrow. Mattie felt LaBoeuf's eyes on her, and she glanced up to find him watching her with an oddly soft expression on his face. It recalled the way his face looked in the moonlight that rainy night he made to leave her with Cogburn in the Winding Stairs when the Marshall decided their \"coon hunt\" had run its course. The look in LaBoeuf's eyes presented her, then and now, with an aspect of him that Mattie could not figure. The gentleness seemed strange and out of place, and it made Mattie uncomfortable generally. She looked back down at her work, removing the clothing from the water and laying it all out on the grass to cool. \"Well,\" LaBoeuf said, after a protracted silence, \"I guess that harkens back to my suggestion that you need a dog about this place to guard your eggs and your chickens, but I know you will not heed it.\" Mattie was on the verge of forming a response when LaBoeuf looked sharply over her shoulder and stood. Mattie turned and saw Sheriff Morris coming around the front of the house with Deputy Sutherland in tow. \"Hidy,\" LaBoeuf called. Mattie pitched him a resentful look, which he missed. The man was a presumptuous fop, greeting guests on her land when he was a guest himself. \"Miss Ross,\" the Sheriff nodded, coming to a halt before them. He seemed somewhat surprised to find that Mattie was not alone. \"Mr. – LaBoeuf, was it?\" \"Indeed,\" LaBoeuf replied shortly, and Mattie could tell that he was perturbed at having his name forgotten. \"Well, I am here to tell you that Mr. MacLeod will come by this afternoon with his wagon to collect the body, but in the meantime I would like to have a look at the place where yesterday's ugliness happened.\" \"You can certainly have a look at the place,\" Mattie replied, \"but you should know that when Mr. LaBoeuf and I returned here last night, we found that Cunningham had risen and disappeared. It seems I did not kill him, after all.\" \"What!\" Sheriff Morris exclaimed, the word hauling up a string of dry, hacking coughs behind it. \"What do you mean 'risen and disappeared'?\" \"I mean that the man had apparently collected himself and gone. There was no body where I had left one,\" Mattie replied. She narrowed her eyes at Deputy Sutherland, who was again ogling her very openly. He seemed particularly interested in the pinned-up sleeve at her side, and only looked away when he finally felt her glare. He was not the first to stare at her arm. Nor would he be the last, she guessed. You would think people had never even heard of rattlesnakes, the way they stared. \"I searched the house and the outbuildings last night and could find no sign of the man,\" LaBoeuf interjected. \"I have just now returned from a search of the woods. I found a campsite up the crick where I suspect Cunningham spent the night. From my knowledge of him, my guess is that he will head downriver to hide out with family he has in Pine Bluff or Arkadelphia. He will need time to convalesce from the thrashing Miss Ross delivered him.\" \"I see,\" said Sheriff Morris, dabbing his forehead with a rag which was grey from many washings. \"That is a shame. But there is nothing for it. This Cunningham will have to go and trouble that jurisdiction, and with any luck, he will kill a man and be caught at it so that he may be done away with altogether. For my part, we cannot spare the manpower.\" \"You will not go after him?\" Mattie asked. \"What, send Sutherland after him into Perry County, and every county after that as far as this Cunningham sees fit to wander? No, no. If he returns here, we will have to deal with him, but otherwise, certainly not. As I say, we cannot spare the manpower.\" Mattie glanced at LaBoeuf, and found him regarding the Sheriff disapprovingly. However, he simply said, \"That is fine. I will go after him myself, anyhow.\" \"Do as you please,\" the Sheriff replied. \"As for you, Miss Ross, if Cunningham returns, kindly fetch the law before you attempt to remove the man's head from his body.\" Then he gestured at Sutherland, and with a tip of their hats, they departed. Mattie and LaBoeuf watched them go, and then LaBoeuf let out a sigh and said, \"I guess I am bound for Pine Bluff, via the Arkansas River. I will depart in the morning.\" \"I guess I am bound for Pine Bluff, also,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf turned and fixed her with a curious stare. \"Now, what do you mean by that?\" he asked. \"I am going with you. You will apprehend him, or kill him in the doing of it. I want to see it done with my own eyes, or by my own hand, if I must.\" \"Mattie, I will avenge what he has done to you. You do not need to make yourself a part of it. I will take care of it. I swear on my honour.\" \"You will hunt him down to collect the money on his head,\" Mattie replied. \"If what was done to me is to be avenged, then I will be the one to do it.\" LaBoeuf gave her an exasperated look. \"Mattie, please. You cannot ask me to take you along. First, there is the danger. Second, your duty to your family's property in your mother's absence. Your mother would not -\" \"My mother returns on the train tomorrow afternoon with my brother and sister, and they will look after the farm. My mother will understand.\" \"What you are proposing is simply out of the question. I will pursue him alone, and that is an end to it,\" LaBoeuf said. \"If I do not go in your company, then I will go alone,\" Mattie replied. \"You have no authority to tell me to stay or go. I am a grown woman, and I have my own stores, and my own horse. I am free to do as I please. You have no say in it.\" LaBoeuf glowered at her, and Mattie sensed that his view of the situation had passed beyond mere frustration and had stretched into the territory of genuine anger. \"I ought to have a word or two with your mother and tell her that you would not be nearly so troublesome had she or your father ever given you a proper hiding.\" Mattie had to clench her hand into a fist to keep from slapping him across his smug face. \"How dare you!\" she snapped. \"Not only do you speak to me as though I am a naughty child in your charge, which I am most certainly not, but you are a guest of mine here and should therefore be ashamed of saying such disrespectful things about my mother and my dearly departed father. I have never been so insulted.\" \"If I ever met a mule as stubborn as you, I would shoot it dead to save all of mankind the trouble,\" LaBoeuf replied, his face flushed an aggravated red. \"If you do not understand that I am attempting to protect you from a harm which has already made itself known to you, then you are slow-witted as well as saucy, difficult, and altogether too proud to be tolerated!\" \"Protect me! Protect me, indeed. You know I am able to defend myself if need be.\" \"What I know is that you are being obtuse, and much too blithe,\" LaBoeuf said, his voice lowered. \"Mattie, Cunningham very nearly killed you. It was only a stroke of pure luck that he did not violate you, strangle the breath from you, and toss your broken body aside to rot in those woods.\" Mattie swallowed, recalling the feeling of Cunningham's fingernails digging into her wrist, and into the flesh of her neck. \"Well,\" she said, after a pause, \"there is no need to be quite so sensational about it, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" He continued to stare at her in apparent disbelief before turning away and sitting back down on the stump. He removed his hat and placed it on the ground, and then picked up the dead turkey at his feet and, grabbing the knife from his boot, neatly removed its head. Mattie watched him for a moment, and then sat down on another stump. \"If you will gut that turkey and remove its feathers, I will roast it for our supper,\" she offered. \"You can take what pieces remain with you tomorrow when you depart, whether we go as 'trail pardners' or not.\" LaBoeuf did not reply. Methodically he removed the turkey's innards, and began removing its feathers. \"You said once that I had 'earned my spurs,'\" Mattie said. \"Do you think I have become soft in the intervening years?\" LaBoeuf looked up and regarded her for a moment before shaking his head. \"Judgment Day will come and go before anyone can accuse you of being soft,\" he said. \"That is not the thing. Rather, it is that I do not see the necessity in putting yourself in danger when I can go after Cunningham on my own. Do you not think I can catch him?\" Mattie stared down at the grass between the toes of her black shoes, considering her thoughts on the subject and how best to communicate them to LaBoeuf. \"I do not doubt your ability to bring Cunningham to justice,\" she said finally. \"In fact, I have every confidence that you will track him down, be it sooner or later. I have not doubted your grit since you proved yourself in the Winding Stairs.\" LaBoeuf eyed her with a curious expression on his face, as though he were somewhat surprised by her words. He cleared his throat. \"What, then?\" he asked. \"I do not relish the idea of staying here on this farm and growing fearful of shadowed corners and draughty stairwells. I do not wish to look over my shoulder every time I go to fetch a stick of firewood.\" \"But your mother and your siblings return tomorrow, do they not?\" LaBoeuf replied, frowning. \"I will stay with you until then, if you like. Cunningham is injured and will therefore be slow on the track, so a day will not greatly affect the outcome. You will feel safe when you are with your family once again.\" \"I will feel more anxious when they return,\" Mattie replied, shaking her head. \"For then I will worry not for myself, but for Mama, and Victoria, who are both gentle by nature, and even Little Frank, who is hot-headed and will not back down from a fight. My father is dead. They are mine to protect, and I do not know how I will sleep soundly knowing that Albert Cunningham could come wandering back across our fields at any moment he pleases.\" Mattie forced herself to continue to meet LaBoeuf's eyes at the conclusion of this speech. She wanted to look away. \"I know you are not naive of the fact that the world is full of men like Cunningham, and worse,\" LaBoeuf replied, his tone contemplative. \"Seeing justice done to Cunningham will not, unfortunately, remove all wickedness from the world, nor will it diminish the chance of encountering it. Not even for you, who has tangled enough with evil for one lifetime.\" \"You are correct,\" Mattie replied. \"However, if you truly believed that the insurmountable nature of collective human wickedness was reason enough in itself not to counteract it where it is found, I think you would not have chosen the vocation you did.\" LaBoeuf regarded her, and then his whiskers twitched and he began to laugh. It was a loud, hearty laugh, and soon enough he was leaning his elbows on his knees and wheezing. Mattie did not join, for she did not think she had said anything amusing. \"You ought to have been a lawyer, Mattie Ross,\" he said when he was able to catch his breath. \"Let us hope you would be working for the prosecution, or else us lawmen would all be in a great deal of trouble.\" He seemed to be making her the object of his fun, and Mattie grew impatient. \"So you will not run me off the roadway if I follow you at a distance in your pursuit of Cunningham?\" LaBoeuf groaned and wiped at his eyes. \"Do not be ridiculous. We will go together, pard. Truth be told, I could use some company on the trail, even if your company is rather like befriending a horsefly.\" Somewhat insulted, but pleased that they had come to an agreement which was to her satisfaction, Mattie merely sniffed in response. They spent the rest of the afternoon preparing for their journey, which would take them down the south bank of the Arkansas River. LaBoeuf said he would be surprised indeed if Cunningham was headed any other place than Pine Bluff, and he immediately set about poring over Papa's maps and asking her questions about the local terrain and what supplies could be got along the way. He then penned a letter he would not show her or discuss. Mattie guessed it was to whoever served as his master with the Rangers in Ysleta. Feeling sportive, she told him that if he was writing a silly letter to his sweetheart, she did not care to know the contents anyway. His face reddened, and he finished his letter in very short order. Mattie, meanwhile, roasted the turkey over the fire in the lean-to, and began making lists in her head of what she ought to bring along with her. She began also to compose a letter of her own; one to her mother which would explain her absence. Mattie turned the turkey on the spit and grimaced. She could imagine her mother's reaction to the news that her eldest daughter had gone off on another adventure. Mama would likely take to her bed for a week. Mattie sighed. She had lied to LaBoeuf when she said that her mother would understand. Mama would not be happy, but Mattie would find a way to placate her upon her return. While the turkey roasted, Mattie prepared food for their journey. She cooked two pones of cornbread, and then packed the last of the salt pork, some corn meal, and a lump of lard, which she wrapped in waxed paper. In the larder she found a small sack of dried apples, and stowed those. She bundled the food and the smallest cast-iron skillet and pot together, and hoped it would not be too much of a burden for Alma, her horse. LaBoeuf had taken a look at the beast and pronounced her sound in spite of her recent ailments. Mattie thought she ought to take some money with her, but when she went into her father's office and opened the locked drawer where they kept some cash, she found that the lock had been tampered with and one hundred dollars in cash was missing. Mattie thought it curious indeed that Cunningham had taken the time to root out the money, but had left the rifles in the office alone, in spite of the fact that he did not seem to own a firearm. She guessed he had done this before he even encountered her in the barnyard. She shivered to think of him marauding in the house while she fed the pigs, ignorant of the danger he presented. If she had any doubt about pursuing him, the discovery of the missing one hundred dollars put it to rest. Mattie was determined to get that money back, and if Cunningham died in the process, all the better. By the time the turkey had finished and they sat down to eat, the sun had set and they were both exhausted. They ate mostly in silence, although LaBoeuf did take the time to say that the turkey was very good. The bird was so small that they ate nearly all of it. The rest Mattie wrapped in paper and put with the other stores she had gathered. That evening, LaBoeuf laid out his revolver, his Sharps-Carbine, her father's Colt's dragoon pistol, and Little Frank's Henry rifle on the parlour floor, and commenced meticulously cleaning and checking each one. Mattie sat nearby and wrote her letter to her mother, as well as one to Lawyer Daggett, outlining what ought to be done with the farm if anything dire befell her. \"I think this piece may be more trouble than it is worth,\" LaBoeuf said. Mattie looked up from her writing to see that he held her father's pistol in his hand. It had served her reasonably if not impeccably in the past, and although Mattie decried superstition generally, she had a notion that it might do her a good turn to carry it with her on this journey regardless of its efficacy as a firearm. LaBoeuf would think this a silly and impractical view, she was aware. She opened her mouth to spin some complicated yarn that would highlight its necessity, but LaBoeuf's eye caught hers, and he gave a little shrug of his shoulders. \"Still, it may prove itself useful. Better to have it than not,\" he said, and laid it with care next to his revolver. They worked in silence for a short while longer, before Mattie finished her letters and folded them labouriously using her one hand and a paperweight. When she was nearly done, she felt LaBoeuf's gaze on her, and looked up to find him watching her fold the paper. \"You manage remarkably well,\" he said, squaring the firearms away. With a tired sigh, he sat back in the armchair and cracked one his knuckles. \"You tend the animals, and cook, and do all manner of rough work. It is commendable.\" \"I manage as well as I must,\" Mattie replied, rather uncomfortable. Although he meant his words as a compliment to her, his tone of condescension annoyed her. Was she expected to be an invalid without purpose or usefulness because she lacked one arm? \"What have you told your mother?\" he asked, nodding at her letters. Mattie set the papers aside and leaned against the back of the settee. \"The truth, excepting a few details which will only upset her.\" \"That is wise. No need to worry the poor woman any more than she will be.\" \"Indeed,\" Mattie replied, standing up. \"I will go see to the night chores, and then I believe I will retire so that we may get an early start in the morning. Goodnight, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Goodnight,\" he said. A cool breeze had whipped up after sunset. By the light of a lantern, Mattie worked quickly to get the animals settled in. When she had finished, she closed and latched the barn door behind her and hurried back to the house, the wind whipping her hair all around. She went up to her bedroom and closed the door. Taking her comb from the washstand and catching a glimpse of herself, she paused and stared. Her loose hair was a mess. Mattie shrugged off her coat and attempted to untangle the knots, but the comb kept getting stuck. She sighed impatiently and pondered her predicament. Riding all day and sleeping on the ground at night for who could guess how many days was going to turn her hair into an absolute nest of snarls by the time she returned home. If only Victoria were here, she could assist in at least pulling it back into some practical plaits for the time being. The sound of LaBoeuf shuffling about downstairs gave Mattie pause. She eyed herself in the mirror. Well , she thought, it is either this, or I cut it all off with that knife of his . Hairbrush in hand, she left her bedroom and went down to the parlour. LaBoeuf was in the armchair, a cloud of pipe smoke about his head and Little Men open on his chest. \"I thought you had retired,\" he said, not looking up from the book. \"Is everything all right?\" \"Everything is fine,\" Mattie replied. \"The animals are all well, and I think Sal and Alma are fast friends already. Only there is a wind outside, and as you can see, it has made a mess of me. Although combing and brushing my hair is not typically difficult for me, plaiting it and pinning it back is, but I can usually leave that to my sister Victoria.\" LaBoeuf looked up from his book then, his brows drawn together in a frown. \"I am sure that is true. Why do you tell me this?\" \"Would you be so helpful as to assist me in brushing the tangles out, and perhaps with pulling it back in some way? Do not think me vain – it does not need to be handsome. It is just that I cannot ride or track or easily do much of anything with my hair all blowing in my face, you see.\" LaBoeuf sat up and set his book aside, looking at her with no small amount of annoyance. \"It is not enough that I am forced to chaperon you against my better judgment, but now I must also be your valet?\" \"By your tone of voice one would think that I had just demanded that you walk to the ocean and back to fetch me a dipperful of water,\" Mattie replied. She did not see why he needed to be so difficult about it. It was not such a hateful request. \"All right, if you insist,\" he said, glowering at her. Electing not to fan the flames of his ire, Mattie walked over and handed him the brush, and sat down on one end of the settee. She turned her back to him, but she caught his sigh as he sat down behind her. \"This seems very untoward,\" he muttered, and Mattie felt his hand slide under the mass of her hair. He held it for a moment as though weighing it. \"Does it?\" Mattie asked, puzzled. She could not see what difference it made, given that they had spent nearly every moment in each other's company that day, not to mention their previous acquaintance, and that they would travel and make camp together in the coming days, as well. LaBoeuf did not reply to that. He ran the brush over her hair so lightly that he barely caught a single hair. \"How do you expect to work out all the tangles if you are brushing my hair like you would a baby's?\" Mattie complained. \"Have you never brushed out a horse's tail? It is more like that. Start at the bottom.\" LaBoeuf exhaled noisily. \"I have done this before.\" \"Have you? Well, you cannot tell,\" Mattie replied. After a moment, she frowned. \"When have you done this before?\" \"I have a sister.\" \"Oh. I did not know. You do not speak of your family.\" Mattie pondered the notion that somewhere, LaBoeuf had a mother and a father, a sister apparently, maybe some brothers. Perhaps he really did have a sweetheart waiting for him in Texas. He had said that he hoped one day to settle down and marry, after all. \"Yes, I have an older sister, Claudine,\" he elaborated. \"Before her there are my three brothers, Rufus, Everett, and Alexander. They are all older by some years, but Claudine and I are near to the same age, and so we were each other's companions as children.\" \"How nice to have a large family,\" Mattie replied. She was curious and wished to know more, but LaBoeuf seemed reticent, and Mattie was not fond of impertinent personal questions herself, and so could not reasonably expect LaBoeuf to withstand them. They both fell silent, but it felt to Mattie oddly peaceful, as LaBoeuf combed his fingers through her hair and began dividing and plaiting it. Her eyes wanted to close, and she had to fight a strange and rather alarming urge to lean back against him. She kept her spine as straight as a ramrod, digging her fingernails into her palm. Her face felt unaccountably hot despite the cool evening. \"Braid it tight and we will not have to fuss with it again,\" she said. \"Yes, I know,\" LaBoeuf replied. The moment he secured her long braid into a knot at the back of her head with her pins, she stood up. \"Thank you,\" Mattie said, her mouth dry. \"I am obliged to you for this.\" LaBoeuf looked up at her, and his eyes seemed more bright and blue than they had before. \"There is no obligation,\" he replied, and pressed the brush into her open palm. \"Goodnight, then,\" she said, and departed. When she passed the mirror in the hallway, she stopped and gaped at herself in shock, craning her neck to get a glimpse of what LaBoeuf had done to her. The top half of her hair was parted down the centre of her skull and pulled back and divided into two tight plaits which fell from the crown of her head. The bottom half of her hair was gathered into one thick plait at the nape of her neck. All three plaits were looped under and their ends secured in some mysterious manner which Mattie could not quite figure. She lifted her hand and felt the tidy mass at the back of her head. It was a very old-fashioned arrangement; Mattie looked like a photograph she had seen of her mother when she was a young woman. Despite its intricacies, it was very practical – all of her hair was pulled neatly out of the way into a bundle that would not come loose, but which also lay against her skull in such a way that she could still wear her father's wide-brimmed hat comfortably. As she pressed her hand against it, she noted that what pins LaBoeuf had used did not even dig into her flesh. Altogether, it was near the cleverest thing Mattie had ever seen. Not that she had any plans of telling LaBoeuf that, of course. As she settled into her own bed upstairs for the night, Mattie could not help but marvel at LaBoeuf's work. She wondered what old Rooster Cogburn would have to say if he found out that the Texas Ranger could not only ride, and track, and shoot a man off his horse from four hundred yards away, but that he could also plait a woman's hair if a need presented itself. Mattie guessed that Rooster would have a few choice words to say about that, indeed.[Chapter 4] Thank you so much for all of your complimentary and encouraging comments/reviews. I'm very flattered, and glad that you're all enjoying the story. Lots more to come! :) Thanks also to allgreycats for being a great beta as well as an enthusiastic sounding board and co-shipper. xoxo Mattie awoke before the sun rose the following morning. She sat up and stretched, blinking to focus her eyes in the dimness, for the grey light of dawn was just beginning to filter in through the window panes. Placing her bare feet on the floor, she shivered, and hoped that the cold weather would hold off for the duration of her adventure. She glanced at her pack and her bedroll, which were leaned against the foot of the bed. She was puzzled to see that a folded sheaf of paper had been placed on top of her bedroll. Standing, Mattie grabbed it and found it was a letter addressed to her, written in an unfamiliar hand which was tidy and formal, and completely lacking in calligraphic flourish. Hastily, she read: Dear Miss Ross, By the time you read this letter, I will have gone to capture Cunningham, and as you have no doubt guessed, I shall do so without your company. I am aware that you will be considerably vexed with me. However, I believe that with time you will see that I have made the decision which is best for you. The trail is no place for a young woman. Your mother, when she returns, will agree. Remember that although you are grown and very headstrong besides, it is your duty to obey your mother in all things until you marry. Do not be frightened for yourself or for your family. I will capture Cunningham and bring him to justice. On this you have my word. You have my gratitude for your generous hospitality during my brief stay in Yell County. When I gathered that Cunningham was headed through Arkansas, I was glad. Here he had written something more, but had scratched it out so that it was illegible. He continued: When you have done away with any spite you feel towards me and you see that I am in the right, I would be pleased to get a letter from you, which you can send courtesy of the Rangers, as follows. Yours truly, Sgt. LaBoeuf At the bottom he had written where one could address a letter to the Ranger battalion in Ysleta, Texas. Nearly shaking with fury, Mattie folded the letter and placed it inside the cover of a book which sat on her bureau. That he would write such a pompous, magnanimous letter when he planned to disappear like a thief in the night, Mattie could hardly believe. He had previously shown himself to be vain and arrogant, but never deceitful. Worse still, he must have entered her room while she was sleeping in order to leave his letter. Bitterly, Mattie wondered how much food the wretch had liberated from the cupboards and the cellar. Mattie dressed in the clothes she had laid out the night before – an old pair of Little Frank's trousers and one of his checked shirts, warm wool socks, her winter coat, and boots. She had packed extra socks, her nightgown and also a dress, should they find themselves in a civilized place. With her pack and bedroll over her shoulder, she went downstairs and collected Little Frank's rifle and her father's pistol, as well as the bundle of food which LaBoeuf had in fact left behind, and placed it all on the front porch. She then went to the barn and milked the cow and fed all of the animals, and made certain that all was in order for her family's return that afternoon. She left the letters to Mama and Lawyer Daggett on Papa's desk. Once she tacked Alma up and loaded her with all they would need for their journey, she led the horse to the fence by the barn and mounted up. The sun was cresting the jagged horizon of pine trees to the east when they rode across the yard, and Mattie took one last look around at the farm. She hoped that no catastrophe befell the place. If anything happened, it would be on her conscience. Grimly, she turned Alma towards the southeast and urged her into a brisk walk. They would soon meet up with the Arkansas River and LaBoeuf, for if he thought that she could not find him, he was a lack-wit as well as being a dandy and a scoundrel. It did not take long to join the southward course of the river, and Mattie found a narrow road running along it which allowed her to keep sight of it and not lose her way. The path was well worn, but Mattie guessed it was not frequently used, as it was covered thickly by fallen leaves, and she knew there was a busier, wider thoroughfare to the west. LaBoeuf might have taken the other road, but Mattie reckoned not, for he would prefer a stealthier route, and in any case, it was likely that Cunningham would have taken the more secluded path as well. It was a fine morning for wayfaring. It was crisp and cloudless, and the sun still offered some warmth in its rays. Around midday, Mattie stopped to let Alma stretch her neck and tear at what greenery she could find among the carpet of leaves on the forest floor. She tipped her head back and looked up at the sun through the few dry leaves which remained on the trees around her. Assuming their train had run on schedule, Mama, Little Frank, and Victoria would be arriving at the little depot in Dardanelle. She was sorry that she would not be there to greet them, for she had promised to be, and she knew Mama would worry and not know what to do. She hoped that between her two siblings, they might help poor Mama and find their way home. Mattie shook her head and urged Alma forward. There was nothing for it now. For hours there was no discernable sign of another living thing on the trail except for the birds and squirrels and other creatures of the woods, which regularly stopped in their own business to chirp and squeak and scold Mattie and Alma for trespassing. Late in the afternoon, however, a promising sign presented itself. There was a fresh pile of \"horse apples\" in the road. They were not steaming , but they had been there only a couple hours at most, Mattie guessed. She took this as an indication that LaBoeuf was not far ahead of her at all. Alma accumulated spirit as the afternoon wore on into evening, the exercise seeming to do her much good. Mattie let her pick up a gentle trot as the sun began to sink below the trees, but darkness fell abruptly, and Mattie soon slowed her down to a walk once again. She was pleased that Alma was well, but did not want to risk an injury to her feet or legs on the uneven forest path. In the blue light of dusk, the sound of birdsong faded, replaced by the infrequent hoots of owls and croaking of frogs. As the darkness deepened and stars emerged, Mattie could hear the faint, leathery rustle of bat wings overhead. She thought of the stories Papa used to tell her when she was small, about lone travellers on night roads being tracked by panthers and lions, and all manner of beasts which emerged from their hidden dens only at night. Mattie shivered, and shook herself. There was no use in worrying about what lurked in the forest until she had reason. She did wish that she could stop and make camp, however. She was becoming saddle sore, and Alma's energy was waning. She hoped that, because he had started out earlier than she, LaBoeuf would already have stopped for the night somewhere ahead on the trail, and that by continuing on in the darkness, she might make up the distance between them. Her hope was not in vain. As Mattie crested a small rise in the landscape, she saw a light glowing through the darkness two hundred yards ahead. She allowed herself a moment of anxiety that perhaps she had somehow bypassed LaBoeuf and stumbled upon Cunningham or some other traveller instead, but she dismissed it, and pressed on. She soon discovered that the light was a campfire, and that a horse and a man were silhouetted against it. The man was seated and leaning against a log, staring into the fire. Mattie got close enough to see that it was LaBoeuf before Alma's plodding made enough noise to rouse him. Mattie stopped her. LaBoeuf's head turned in their direction, and his eyes searched the trees. Mattie dismounted, and the sound of her feet thumping to the forest floor alerted LaBoeuf to her presence. He stood, pulling his pistol from his holster and peering out into the darkness. \"Who is there? I warn you, I am a Texas Ranger, and I am armed,\" LaBoeuf called. Mattie led Alma to the line LaBoeuf had strung between two trees for Sal. The latter was resting one of her hind feet, and her head was low and dozy. At their approach, she exhaled a tired greeting. Mattie tied Alma there, and walked into the circle of light thrown by the campfire. \"I was once told that it is very imprudent to make camp by your cook fire, and that it is Ranger policy to avoid such a blunder,\" Mattie said, coming close and holding her stiff hands out to the fire to warm them. She met his fierce gaze without blinking. \"You ought to know that I could see your fire from nearly two hundred yards away, even in these dense woods.\" \"Sakes alive!\" LaBoeuf cursed, returning his pistol to his holster. He shook his head in apparent disbelief. \"You are harder to shake than a tick in June.\" \"You thought you would take a page out of Marshall Cogburn's book,\" Mattie said. \"You thought you hornswoggled me good, but I guess you did not figure that I would follow you. That was very foolish, for not only have I followed and found you with an ease which ought to be shameful to you, but now I know your word is worthless, too.\" \"Mattie, if you do not turn that horse of yours around and head on back where you came from, I will make you sorry that you stayed,\" he threatened, pointing a finger in her face and glowering at her. \"And this time Cogburn is not here to stop me!\" \"You do not own this road or this river, Mr. LaBoeuf. I am free to track Cunningham to Timbuktu if I choose. If you do not want to be reasonable, I will follow at a distance, and we can both proceed on this path as strangers. I do not see why it should be so, however.\" The look he gave her then was fierce, and Mattie could tell that he wanted very badly to reach for his belt and wallop her. She tipped her chin up and met his eyes, and did not blink. Finally, he turned away and cursed, and sat back down to glare into the fire. Unaccountably, Mattie felt sorry. She would rather have kissed Cunningham than say so, however, and after a stretch of silence broken only by the crackle of the fire and the sounds of the horses eating, she sat down to his left, leaving enough space between them that she faced another side of the fire altogether. She wanted to be able to escape should he change his mind and decide to thrash her after all. \"Although I will grant that you held up as well as any man in our pursuit of Tom Chaney, I think you overestimate your understanding of the evil that dwells in men's hearts,\" LaBoeuf said finally, in a low and serious voice. He continued to stare into the fire, frowning. \"If anything should happen to you, it would be my responsibility.\" Mattie's first thought was to tell him that he was not a relation of hers and was therefore not responsible for her, but instead she paused and contemplated the thing a moment. \"If Cunningham harms me, or you, or any other person for that matter, I believe that on the Day of Judgment when all souls will be weighed and found wanting, Cunningham is the one who will answer for every crime he committed with his own hands. Do you not agree?\" \"I suppose I do,\" replied LaBoeuf, glancing at her. \"In any case, you did what you could to dissuade me from this course,\" Mattie said. \"I know this, as do you, and I made it abundantly clear in my letters to Mama and to Lawyer Daggett. If some catastrophe befell me, you would not suffer.\" LaBoeuf stared at her for a moment before giving a shake of his head. He looked tired. \"Well, then. I guess you will have your way once again, after all, Mattie Ross.\" The beleaguered tone of his voice detracted somewhat from her satisfaction at this victory. She was on the verge of scolding him for being a poor sport when her stomach growled audibly. He looked at her with his eyebrows raised, and she blushed. \"Have you eaten?\" he asked. \"Not since this morning, and it was a cold, hurried breakfast, as I did not start my journey as I anticipated I would,\" she replied. With an exaggerated heavenward roll of his eyes, LaBoeuf stood and retrieved a small iron pot from where it sat next to the fire. In it was a portion of pork and beans, still warm. He offered it to her. \"I brought my own stores,\" she said. \"You do not need to share with me.\" \"Our agreement yesterday afternoon was to head out as pardners, and since you have proved yourself an able tracker and caught me in my deception, I reckon we can return to our previous understanding,\" he said grudgingly. \"All right,\" Mattie agreed, accepting the beans. \"We will share equally in this. I have salt pork and cornbread for our breakfast in the morning.\" LaBoeuf only made a sort of grumbling sound in response, and returned to his spot by the fire, where he began arranging his bed roll. He lay down and pulled a colourful blanket over himself. Mattie guessed it was a thing native to Texas, for she had not seen one like it before. He placed his hat over his face and did not say another word to her. Mattie finished the beans. She rinsed out the pot by the bank of the river before placing it next to the fire to dry. She checked on the horses, and fed each one of them a piece of dried apple from her pack. She laid her bedroll out on her side of the fire, and pulled her blanket over herself. Their little fire formed a cup of light in the wide black night. The last thing Mattie saw before she closed her eyes was the light reflecting off the tree branches above, and the smoke rising into the starry sky. When Mattie awoke in the morning, she found that she had curled up into a ball and pulled her blankets up to cover much of her face. As she stiffly unfurled herself and sat up, she disturbed a thin layer of frost which had settled all over her blanket and her saddle, and even the top of her head. She was relieved to see that, an arm's length away, LaBoeuf was up reviving the fire. \"You are awake,\" he said. \"I am,\" she replied, rubbing her eyes. \"I see your hair is bearing up to sleeping rough on the trail thus far.\" He was eyeing her speculatively, and Mattie felt a foreign stab of self-consciousness. She ran her hand over the braids coiled against her head, smoothing the wisps which had come loose while she slept. \"I think I will go down to the river to wash,\" Mattie said, standing and quickly shaking out and rolling up her bedroll. \"There is a crick up yonder whose water is clearer and faster than that river. It is better for washing,\" LaBoeuf said, gesturing back into the woods. \"We will have to cross it today.\" \"All right. Have the horses been watered?\" \"They have.\" Mattie nodded, and turned into the woods to find the crick. It was only a dozen yards away, and Mattie could see the spot where LaBoeuf had broken the glass-like crust of ice which had formed on its stony banks in the night. For a moment, Mattie watched the water bubble up underneath the thin ice, which was disappearing as the sun rose higher in the sky. She washed her face and hands, and the cold sting of the water took her breath away. When she returned to their camp, LaBoeuf was frying salt pork in a small iron pan with legs like a spider's. When he had finished, Mattie fried thick pieces of cornbread in the fat, and that was their breakfast. While they ate, LaBoeuf said not a word to her, his mouth set in a grim line. That he was not his usual loquacious self perturbed Mattie. It was plain that he was sore at having been caught. \"You are still down in the mouth at my presence here,\" she said. \"That is fine; I guess I cannot expect you to be congenial to me under the present circumstances. However, I think that we were friends once, and this enterprise will be much pleasanter for us both if we are cordial to one another.\" \"Cordial,\" he repeated, weighing the word. He looked at her. \"Yes, I reckon we are friends and that I can be cordial, in spite of your continued efforts to make me look a fool at every turn.\" Mattie considered telling him that he did a fine job of making himself look a fool without any assistance on her part, but she did not. To say so would be counter to her goal of placating him. After all, he was only a man, and one who guarded his pride with particular ferocity. \"I did not set out deliberately to make you look a fool,\" she said. \"You can be confident that my regard for you is sincere. I would not be here in these woods with you if that were not the case.\" LaBoeuf eyed her for a moment, and then cleared his throat. \"What I wrote to you in my letter was a fact – I was glad to find myself in Arkansas. You see, I once made the acquaintance of a remarkable young woman from Yell County, and I hoped to see her again.\" Mattie glanced away, feeling her cheeks heat and a smile pull at the corner of her mouth. She bit her lip to stifle it. \"While I am not happy in the slightest to have crossed paths with Cunningham, if he brought you here I cannot regret it altogether, either.\" LaBoeuf fixed her with an odd, measuring sort of look which lasted so long that Mattie began to feel uncomfortable. \"Well?\" she asked. \"Shall we shake on it, then, that we are friends, and pardners, and we will put our disagreements behind us?\" LaBoeuf nodded, and held out his bare hand, and Mattie shook it. It was warm, despite the cool morning, and rough and soft all at once. He gripped her hand firmly, his expression solemn. \"I reckon I will regret this at some future moment,\" he said. \"I am glad, though, that at least Reuben Cogburn is not here to suggest any of his wild schemes, or to put more holes in me.\" Mattie recalled Cogburn's stubborn insistence that he was not responsible for LaBoeuf's injured shoulder. \"You may feel different if you get a hankering to shoot cornbread out of the air once we are clear of these woods.\" \"You will not join me in such a game? It will keep your aim sharp,\" LaBoeuf replied, a measure of good humour returning to his face. He tilted his head at her, and his eyes caught the morning sunlight. Mattie shook her head. \"It would be a waste of both food and ammunition. Wastefulness is capital among sins.\" \"Your knowledge of sinful behaviour is broad for being guilty of so few yourself.\" \"I am as sinful a creature as the next person,\" Mattie replied, discomfited. She realised then that her hand was still grasped in his, and she pulled it free. \"We ought to get on the trail. We are wasting time. Had you planned to get as far as Morrilton today?\" LaBoeuf regarded her in silence for a moment longer, and then smiled at something he apparently found amusing. \"I had indeed. My hope is that Cunningham will stop for supplies or perhaps doctoring there, and if we do not catch the man himself, we will be able to glean a reckoning of his next step. I do not want to continue without some certainty that he is indeed headed downriver to Pine Bluff, or west to Arkadelphia.\" \"All right,\" Mattie agreed. She turned away and they began to break camp and get the horses ready to depart. They made quick work of it, and an hour later they had already forded the bright little crick nearby. The only sign that they had been there at all was the smouldering remains of the fire, and some hoof prints in the dirt. They rode for hours through the woods in the shadow of Petit Jean Mountain before crossing the river and finding themselves in clearer, more cultivated territory. The sun had begun to sink in the west and the sky was clouding over. Mattie hoped they would come to Morrilton soon, for she did not relish the thought of finding a place to camp on the bald prairie. They reached Morrilton late in the afternoon, before suppertime. The town was small but handsome. Its main street boasted a block of low brick buildings with fine board sidewalks, fronted by railroad tracks and surrounded behind by several blocks of clapboard storefronts and houses. Thin blue threads of smoke rose from chimneys and stovepipes, and the streets were full of horses and people and vehicles of all kinds. LaBoeuf located a livery stable and suggested that they allow the horses a rest and proceed about town on foot, unencumbered. Mattie agreed. While LaBoeuf haggled rather ineffectually with the liveryman, Mattie sat on a barrel of nails and watched the activity of the town. She examined the faces of the people in the street carefully. For all they knew, Cunningham might be in Morrilton yet, walking the streets without a care, ignorant that he was being followed. Mattie noticed that many of the townspeople stared at her. She supposed that the sight of a one-armed woman in trousers sitting on a barrel of nails might be an oddity, but that was hardly an excuse to gape. Some people behaved as though they had no control over themselves whatsoever. Eventually LaBoeuf emerged and stood before her. He smoothed a hand over his hair before replacing his hat on his head. \"I agreed to a higher price than I would have liked, for the man was very liberal with information. Cunningham was in town yesterday. He suggested we try the doctor, a man called Quick, for he is certain that Cunningham sought doctoring.\" \"You are a lawman. You could not extract this information while also paying a reasonable price to livery our horses?\" Mattie asked, her dim view of LaBoeuf's bargaining acumen confirmed. \"You have much to learn in the ways of diplomacy if you wish to continue your career as a 'law-woman' or what have you,\" LaBoeuf replied, turning and walking purposefully down the sidewalk. Mattie hopped off of her barrel and fell into step beside him. \"I have no such vocation, and no desire to embark upon one, either,\" Mattie said. \"And you are one to talk about diplomacy. Here I thought your idea of the thing was to invite yourself into people's private rooms and attempt to threaten and intimidate them.\" \"Yes, well, you will have to pardon my mistake, for you give a good impression of a gun-for-hire,\" LaBoeuf replied shortly. He sounded impatient and in no mood to cajole. Stopping a moment, he pointed across the wide street. A building of whitewashed clapboard stood there, with a sign above its door which read DOCTOR SAMUEL F. QUICK in tall black letters. They crossed the street and let themselves into the place, a bell over the door announcing their arrival. \"Just a moment,\" came a man's voice from the office beyond the small reception room in front. They stood and waited until a young woman about Mattie's age emerged from the back. She had pale yellow hair and was dressed in a blue lawn walking dress which was pretty and, as far as Mattie could tell, very fashionable. She wore a small hat on top of the curls gathered on her head, and she smiled brightly at them both as she passed and left the office. While she seemed pleasant enough, Mattie could not see the sense in a hat so small that it did not shade your face or neck, and did little else except make a nuisance of itself with hatpins and such. \"Well,\" LaBoeuf said in a low voice, and Mattie glanced up to see him looking after the girl as she disappeared down the sidewalk. \"Well what?\" Mattie asked, but she did not receive a reply, for at that moment a man emerged from the back office. Mattie guessed him to be about fifty years old, or perhaps fifty-five. He was short and round, with steel grey hair and \"Burnsides\" on his face. His complexion was ruddy, and he wore a pair of thin, wire-rimmed spectacles on his nose. \"You do not look like any kind of person I have seen in these parts before,\" the doctor stated, examining LaBoeuf with blatant curiosity. He turned his dark eyes on Mattie. \"You are mighty peculiar yourself.\" \"If we are newcomers to your town, that is an impudent way to welcome us,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf sighed impatiently. \"I am not from these parts; I am a Texas Ranger. I am on the trail of a man named Cunningham who I understand was in Morrilton as recently as yesterday. The man is considerably injured. I would like to know whether he came to you for assistance.\" \"I do not mind telling you that this Cunningham passed through here yesterday afternoon,\" Dr. Quick began, giving a rueful shake of his head. \"I cleaned and stitched up a rather nasty cut on his neck which had started to fester. It was a grisly wound, and I am surprised he did not die from the loss of blood when it was first dealt to him.\" LaBoeuf turned and glanced at Mattie with his eyebrows raised, as if to say that she had done a good job. She ignored him and looked at the doctor. \"What happened then?\" she asked. \"He absconded without paying me. The man is a thief. I ought to have learned by now never to trust his type, and to demand payment upfront.\" \"His type?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Yes – dissolute, violent sorts. His degeneracy was discernible to me immediately upon making his acquaintance, but I am a Christian man and would not turn him away. Did you not notice this? His kind is the reason I gave up doctoring in the western territories and returned east, to more civilised country,\" Dr. Quick replied. \"Did he leave you with any impression of where he might be headed?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Not as such. He talked ceaseless nonsense as I tended his wound. He did make mention of his mother, who he said resides in Arkadelphia. But when I turned away to wash my instruments, he was off my table and out the door without so much as a by-your-leave,\" Dr. Quick said. \"I notified the Sheriff and they are looking for him, but to no avail.\" \"I see,\" LaBoeuf said. \"I reckon he likely left town not long after, then. Do you know if he had any connections in Morrilton, anyone with whom he might have stayed?\" \"None that he spoke of.\" \"Well, you have been helpful. We thank you,\" LaBoeuf said, tipping his hat to the doctor and turning to leave. Mattie had little choice but to follow. \"Are we going to speak to the Sheriff?\" Mattie asked as they left Dr. Quick's office. \"I suspect the law here will be about as helpful as your Sheriff Morris.\" LaBoeuf stopped short on the board sidewalk and looked out over the street, frowning in contemplation. \"Yes, I think he is headed to Arkadelphia. I have an inkling he will tarry there to recuperate, and then head west.\" \"You have an inkling?\" Mattie repeated. \"What do you mean, an inkling?\" \"I mean that judging by my knowledge of his movements and his associates, I expect that Cunningham has 'gone to ground' at his mother's in Arkadelphia. He will have to pass through Hot Springs on his way, and there he can find entertainment of the sort he likes. Gambling and drinking, I mean.\" \"I see,\" Mattie said. She nodded. \"In that case, let us make tracks for Hot Springs.\" LaBoeuf shaded his eyes and looked up at the sky. The sun was sinking quickly towards the western horizon. He glanced at Mattie. \"Did you have your heart set on sleeping in a boarding house tonight, or would you mind another night in the wilderness?\" \"It seems foolish to waste both time and money staying in town,\" Mattie replied. \"Also I do not wish to stay in a boarding house more often than is necessary, for I do not relish the gossip and impertinent questions.\" \"Gossip?\" \"Indeed, gossip. Do you not think that some folks will find it scandalous, a young unmarried woman travelling the country unaccompanied but for an unmarried man?\" \"Yes, I do think some folks will find it scandalous. Well they should. You ought to,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Why should I? We are hardly a pair of eloping 'lovebirds.' I am out for business the same as you. I know I am in the right, only I have no desire to be stared at or talked about.\" \"Lovebirds, indeed,\" LaBoeuf muttered. He shook his head. \"Let us fetch the horses. We will cross the river, at least, and see how far west we can get before it is dark.\" \"All right,\" Mattie said, excited at the progress they were making. LaBoeuf tilted his head and gave her a curious look. \"A smile! That is a rare thing from you. I reckon you are enjoying yourself on this adventure,\" he said, his voice taking on a teasing tone. Mattie sobered instantly. \"Do not be silly, Mr. LaBoeuf. I am on this errand for practical reasons alone.\" \"Haw!\" he responded, but he said no more. They walked to the livery, and soon they were on the trail once more. \"A plum thicket? Truly?\" LaBoeuf asked, craning about in his saddle to cast his sceptical gaze on her. \"Truly. On a goat,\" Mattie replied. They had crossed the Arkansas River for the second time, and they were now headed on a southwest course in the direction of Hot Springs. Sunset was upon them as they passed through flat country whose vista was broken only by a handful of small farms. The wind had grown colder, and Mattie hoped they would find trees or some other shelter soon. \"And this was a dare that was put to you?\" \"It was,\" Mattie said. \"I do not take up notions such as riding goats through plum thickets for their own sake.\" LaBoeuf considered this for a moment. \"I did not know that girls were fond of dealing strange and unladylike dares to one another.\" \"I do not know whether or not they are. This particular dare was doled out by a boy with whom I attended school.\" \"How long did your parents allow you to be at school?\" \"I left school when I was 10 to help my father manage the farm,\" Mattie replied. She urged Alma forward and brought her up alongside LaBoeuf, for the roadway was now wide enough to allow them to travel two abreast. Sal and Alma seemed pleased enough about it, bending their heads together as they walked. \"And did you have many boys as your friends?\" \"Not especially,\" Mattie replied, and gave him a sidelong glance, uncertain whether he was \"pulling her leg.\" The truth was that she had not had many friends in school at all, girls or boys. Papa used to like to say that Mattie was born as serious as doomsday. That was true, and other children had always seemed to find her peculiar. There was a girl named Ida Brewer whose farm was near theirs, and they often walked to and from the schoolhouse together. Ida was sensible and not as silly as the other children, but she was meek, and Mattie always felt as though Ida was like her hostage, and the other girl would have been as contented to walk alone. It had not much mattered, and it did not make Mattie sad or regretful to think of it now. Her younger siblings had been fine playmates, and she had always liked Papa's company best, in any case. \"The only girl I knew growing up was my sister, Claudine,\" LaBoeuf mused. \"She has always had a very sweet and gentle temperament, and would not be found riding goats through plum thickets. Not like... Well.\" His words trailed off, and he frowned. \"Not like me,\" Mattie said, finishing for him. She felt somewhat stung, although she did not know why she should, and she turned away as her cheeks reddened. \"I do not know why I should be shocked,\" LaBoeuf continued. \"From all I know of you, you were born without a fearful bone in your body.\" Mattie found herself without much of a response, and so she said simply, \"I have a reasonable fear of fools, and that is all,\" and they fell silent for some time, the road passing easily beneath their horses' hooves. \"Sal seems a responsive and steady mount,\" Mattie observed, after a spell. \"Do you ever use those spurs on her?\" LaBoeuf seemed perplexed for a moment, glancing down at his feet, dug deep in his stirrups. \"Ah,\" he said, looking back up, but not at Mattie. \"No, I do not find that I have need of them with her.\" \"Then why do you wear them? Surely even you are not so vain that you would wear spurs that you do not use.\" There was a long pause, so long in fact that Mattie thought LaBoeuf intended to ignore her question altogether. She was about to badger him when he spoke. \"I am partial to the sound they make when I walk,\" he said, his voice low and uncharacteristically cowed. Thinking his pride had been battered enough, Mattie said nothing in reply, but she could not help the smile which spread across her face. LaBoeuf shot her a look of annoyance, and did not say anything more. They rode in silence for some time, their horses' heads drooping with their plodding pace. They were growing tired. \"Your sister, Claudine – where is she?\" Mattie asked eventually, attempting to settle on some topic about which they could speak without much risk of contention. \"You mentioned also that you have three brothers. Do they live in Texas?\" \"No, they do not,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"My sister lives in Pineville, Louisiana, with her husband and children, and our mother. My father was a lawyer in Pineville, and that is where we grew up. My brothers have settled in the Dakota Territory, Colorado, and California, respectively. They have families there.\" \"My mother's people are from Monterey,\" Mattie said. \"I have met my Grandfather Spurling only once, when he came to visit us with his second wife, but I was very small. Where my Grandfather lives, you can see the ocean from the house. I would like someday to see California, but I doubt I ever shall. Have you been to California?\" \"I have not. In fact I have never been west of Tucson.\" Mattie would not have minded hearing more about LaBoeuf's family, but they crested a small hill then and found themselves on the rim of a shallow valley filled with dense forest. They stopped, and LaBoeuf surveyed the land before them for a moment. \"I propose we camp in these woods tonight, for it is hard to guess what shelter will be found beyond,\" he said, in a decisive tone which suggested that his was not a proposal at all. It rankled Mattie, but she was too tired to harangue him, and in any case, she happened to agree. \"That is fine. I believe the horses are played out,\" she replied. They made their camp nearby in the shelter of some large pine trees, close to the banks of a muddy crick which Mattie figured must drain into the Arkansas. Once the horses were fed and watered and tied to a line so they could stretch their tired backs and graze, LaBoeuf made a small fire and Mattie set about making their supper from what was left of the turkey, some corn mush, and dried apples. Twilight gathered as they ate, and soon their fire was the only light to be seen. When they had finished, LaBoeuf leaned against the fallen trunk of an oak tree and smoked his pipe. Mattie sat nearby, looking into the fire. She was exhausted, and her injuries were plaguing her. The lump on her head throbbed with particular fierceness now, and she longed for sleep. \"I ought to cut one of these saplings and make a fishing pole,\" LaBoeuf said, apropos of nothing. \"That crick looks likely for catfish. It is the sort of place they like, for they can laze about in the bottoms gathering up all manner of trash as it is swept down to the river.\" \"The thought of catching fish bait in the dark does not appeal to me even for the sake of some catfish, but you may do as you please,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf tipped his hat back on his head and reached over, retrieving a brown bottle of whiskey from some hidden place. He uncorked it and regarded it for a moment before holding it out to her. \"Care for a smile?\" he asked. Mattie frowned at him. \"I am no adventuress. You may keep the drink for yourself.\" LaBoeuf made a sort of choking sound and shot her a scandalized look. \"Adventuress! A simple refusal would have sufficed, Miss Mattie Temperance.\" Mattie did not respond. Silence fell, but for the shuffling of the horses, the crackling of the fire, and the periodic glassy clink of LaBoeuf's liquor bottle. Some time passed, and Mattie became aware that LaBoeuf was scrutinizing her rather fixedly in the firelight. She looked at him. \"Nineteen,\" he said, nodding. \"I guess you must be round about nineteen by now.\" \"I beg your pardon?\" \"I was considering how old you were when first we met, and how old you must be now. Am I correct when I say you are nineteen?\" \"You have spent too much time in the wilderness chasing criminals if you believe that this sort of impertinent talk is tolerated by people of good society,\" she replied. \"Hm,\" LaBoeuf said. He paused there and drank from his bottle. \"My sister was married when she was your age.\" Mattie's thought was that the same was true of Mama, but she did not say so. \"That is very interesting. I wonder if your sister knows that her brother takes pleasure in bothering folks with rude and tiresome questions.\" \"My sister certainly does know that, and I believe she would say that is why I became a lawman,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Do you have a beau, or do the young men of Yell County cower at the prospect of contending with your razor tongue?\" They had been getting along all right that day, and Mattie did not understand why LaBoeuf had begun harassing her. \"You ought not to sneer so readily at the notion of temperance. That liquor has put the devil in you.\" \"Haw haw!\" said LaBoeuf, his expression smug. \"I see you will not be drawn out.\" Mattie stared at him a moment longer, confused by his behaviour. \"I am tired. I believe I will sleep now. Goodnight.\" She stood and collected her bedroll, which she laid out in the spot where she had been sitting, close to the fire. She rested her head against her saddle, and turned her back on LaBoeuf, and the fire. In spite of her fatigue, Mattie did not fall asleep right away, for LaBoeuf stayed up drinking and throwing fresh logs on the fire for some time. She could not escape the sensation that his eyes lingered on her back, nor did she wish to turn over and have her suspicion confirmed. Eventually sleep won her, and she remembered nothing more.[Chapter 5] Thanks to allgreycats and ishie for the beta. You are the best cheerleaders in the world. Thanks also to all of you for all the great comments and reviews - they keep me writing. There may be a bit of a wait for the next chapter after this, as I'm supposed to be finishing up some other fics and working on original stuff as well. I hope you enjoy the chapter. Ten points to whoever can guess why I used the name Virgil. :) It took Mattie and LaBoeuf nearly two days to reach Hot Springs, arriving in the town just before sunset on the second day. The lands they passed through, heading southwest, were thick with pine woods and sparsely populated. There were only occasional small farms in clearings as they went, and Mattie found that the people of this part of Arkansas were not nearly so friendly and neighbourly as they were in Yell County. Often they simply stood in their dark doorways, staring at Mattie and LaBoeuf as they passed, and no smile or hail of welcome was sent their way. Mattie was disappointed. She had thought all of Arkansas was filled with generally decent folk, but the dwellers of these piney hills and valleys seemed coarse. With little else to occupy the saddle-bound hours, they talked, and Mattie soon came to know many things about LaBoeuf, including the fact that his full name was Virgil Emery Theo LaBoeuf, he would rather eat dirt out of the road than ever again lay eyes on a piece of hardtack, and that although he thought his sister's husband to be a \"cussed fool\" he enjoyed visiting them in Pineville when he had the leisure, for his five nieces and nephews there were very amusing. She also found that when he left off drinking whiskey, things were much pleasanter between them. For her part, Mattie felt at liberty to speak of her own siblings, and of her plans for the farm. On that second afternoon, as they approached Hot Springs, she found herself talking about her father, and his many schemes, and the little sojourns they used to take to hunt on the Petit Jean, and how he loved to play tricks and make Mama laugh. After some tales she fell silent, thinking on what tales she might have been able to tell had Tom Chaney not come into their lives and cruelly and unjustly ended her father's. Five years had passed since his death, but that slight had grown only marginally easier to bear. Some sad or pensive look must have crossed her face, for LaBoeuf cleared his throat and spoke. \"Although it is the natural way of things for children to bury their parents, it is a hardship to lose a beloved parent when you are young,\" he said. \"My own father passed out of this world when I was but twelve years old.\" \"What happened to your father?\" Although LaBoeuf had spoken of his family, he had mentioned his father only in an oblique way which led Mattie to believe that he had died. \"He took a wound at Sharpsburg which festered and killed him. My mother was devastated, and with my older brothers away fighting, she had but my sister and me to comfort her.\" LaBoeuf paused here and looked out at the horizon for a moment before continuing. \"I wanted nothing more than to run as fast as I could to Maryland and put a bullet in those men who killed my father. I tried to enlist but they would not take me even as a drummer boy, small as I was. Of course by the time I was fifteen, they were not quite so particular.\" Mattie had heard about LaBoeuf's truncated and ignoble service in the war during their previous adventure. She thought of how heartsick his mother must have been, with her husband dead and all her sons off fighting. Mattie wondered if, having already been widowed, the woman saw any glory in those last months of war, or if she simply wanted her sons to return home safely. Mama used to say that she had not cared if the Union won the war and burned them all out of their homes, so long as Papa came back to her in whatever condition God saw fit to send him. \"Your mother must have been greatly relieved to have you all at home again, when all was said and done,\" Mattie said. \"Yes, she was,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"It did not last long, for soon we were all off scattered to the four winds, but by then she was occupied enough with seeing Claudine married and settled, and we have always been diligent in our regular letters to her.\" \"Do you enjoy correspondence, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"Certainly, both the sending and the receiving of it,\" he replied. He frowned, and cleared his throat. \"Although at times we are very busy in Ysleta, we do have our 'dry spells,' so to speak, and it is a fine thing to have letters to read, and to respond to. Perhaps when all this business is done, you would like to send me a letter from time to time.\" \"All right,\" Mattie said. She felt a smile tug at her mouth, and she turned her face away, feeling oddly hesitant for him to know how much the thought of an occasional letter from him pleased her. Sourly, she reflected that already she was turning into a silly old spinster. They rode on in silence for some time longer, until the pine-forested hills began to give way to a gently sloping valley which contained a small, pretty town in its basin. \"I believe that is Hot Springs,\" LaBoeuf said, reining Sal to a halt. \"It is a handsome place,\" Mattie observed. \"You may not find it so handsome when you get a taste of what goes on here. There are parts which are fine and civil, and in fact downright grand, but it is a town full of gamblers, taverns, and music halls. I understand that it is a popular stop for eloping 'lovebirds,' also.\" Mattie pursed her lips, her cheeks feeling unaccountably warm. \"I see now why Cunningham would make certain to pass through.\" \"Indeed,\" replied LaBoeuf. \"We should not delay if we want to find somewhere to stay and get the lay of the place tonight.\" \"All right.\" On riding into Hot Springs and finding themselves on what appeared to be the main street, Mattie thought the little town even prettier up close than it had looked from a distance. There was a block of respectable hotels whose signage boasted mineral treatments for relaxation and every kind of ailment. The buildings gleamed white in the sun, their wide fronts supported by enormous columns. It was a handsome effect, although privately Mattie thought it ostentatious. Near the train depot, LaBoeuf stopped and spoke with a young boy selling hot peanuts. The boy pointed up into the town, and after LaBoeuf favoured him with a coin, they rode in that direction. They soon found themselves traversing a block which housed a different character of hotel altogether. These hotels were neither respectable nor grand, and most had rough taverns on their main floors. LaBoeuf stopped in front of one, dismounted, and began tying Sal to the hitching post. Mattie followed suit. This hotel called itself the Princess Hotel. Its clapboard front was grey and weathered, its once bright red sign faded to a rusty brown. Thin, discoloured curtains flapped limply out of the open windows in the upper floors, and the sidewalk out front was littered with broken glass. LaBoeuf paused on the stoop of the ugly little building, and turned to look at her. He regarded her for a moment before speaking. \"I reckon it would be a useless exercise to ask that you stay out here and let me go in alone,\" he said. Mattie considered it, and then nodded. \"Yes, it would be.\" \"All right then.\" He led the way, holding the door open for her rather solicitously. \"Thank you,\" Mattie said. His courtesy surprised her, although on reflection she was not sure why, for his manners had always been agreeable enough to her, if not his opinions. Although the Princess presented itself as a hotel, it seemed that its primary purpose was a tavern, for the front doors opened directly into a wide room which was filled with small, round tables, and dominated by a broad wooden bar. There was a doorway to the left which led off to a foyer containing a desk and a staircase. The tavern was dusty and stuffy, and nearly empty of people. A man was slumped over at the end of the bar, a half-full glass of whiskey clutched in one limp hand. The barkeep was wiping glasses with a dingy rag at the other end. A slight young woman carrying a pile of dirty linens came through the room, eyeing LaBoeuf and Mattie with great suspicion before disappearing into a back room beyond the bar. They approached the bar, and LaBoeuf leaned forward to speak to the barkeep, who did not look up from his work. \"Sir, I am looking for information about a man by the name of Albert Cunningham. Do you know him?\" LaBoeuf reached into his buckskin coat and removed a coin, which he placed on the bar top. The barkeep paused his wiping, and looked at the coin. He then looked up at LaBoeuf. \"Who are you to be looking for information?\" \"I am a Texas Ranger,\" LaBoeuf said in an important tone, \"and Mr. Cunningham is in considerable trouble with the law. Your assistance would be appreciated.\" There was a groan from the man at the end of the bar, and what sounded like it might have been a belch. Mattie wrinkled her nose. \"This man is taller than me, but shorter than him,\" she said, gesturing at LaBoeuf. \"He has brown hair and blue eyes, and he will have had a bandaged wound on his neck. Do you know him?\" The barkeep seemed about to respond when the man at the end of the bar groaned again and began to speak, his voice a low slurring of words. \"Shitfire!\" he swore. \"I had a suspicion that chasing after that damn stock thief was a fool notion, and here is the proof. If I had known the two of you were after him, I woulda stayed home. Surely he will turn himself over to the law to save himself the aggravation of being followed by Sergeant LaBoeuf and his deputy, Mattie Ross.\" The speaker was Rooster Cogburn. \"Oh, hell,\" LaBoeuf muttered under his breath. \"Marshall!\" Mattie exclaimed, spinning about to look at the grizzled man leaning heavily on the bar, his stool wobbling as he tried to stand. \"Hidy, Cogburn. What brings you to Hot Springs?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Dad blame it,\" Cogburn cursed, ignoring LaBoeuf and giving his grubby coat a sharp yank. He appeared to be tangled up in his clothing, and his holster. He also appeared to be inebriated. \"Do you require assistance?\" Mattie asked, approaching him. He stopped his fussing and sat back on the stool, peering at her with his one eye. \"Ah, it is you. Thought the drink had got to me and I was seeing imps and fairies. Hmph,\" he said, turning away to finish off his glass of whiskey with a grimace. \"Yes, it is I, Mattie Ross,\" Mattie replied. \"You are a 'sight for sore eyes,' Marshall. How came you to be in Arkansas? I heard you had gone to Texas.\" \"Texas! Do not speak to me about that dry, godforsaken cow patch. The whole blasted state can go to the devil. I did not care a whit for it,\" he said. LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"I believe Cogburn said he was on the trail of a stock thief. What stock thief is that, Cogburn?\" \"I am looking for your man Cunningham. He is wanted for murder in San Antonio, and I am after the bounty on him,\" Cogburn replied. \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf said. He glanced at the barkeep, and then back at Cogburn. \"Perhaps we should have our parley in private.\" After procuring another drink, Cogburn followed LaBoeuf to a table in the corner, but not without considerable grumbling. The three of them sat down, LaBoeuf with his back to the near-empty room. \"What do you know about Cunningham?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"I know he is a canny son-of-a-bitch,\" Cogburn replied. He glanced at Mattie, and then cleared his throat. \"Man's a stock thief. Shot a range detective down in San Antonio and lit out. Been tracking him for near two months. What do you know about him?\" \"I know he is wanted for murder and stock thievery in your parts, and for murder in mine. He has been a thorn in the side of the law across Texas and Arkansas, and I aim to put a stop to it.\" \"Hm,\" Cogburn replied. He nodded at Mattie. \"How's she figure into it?\" Before Mattie could open her mouth, LaBoeuf spoke. \"Cunningham was in Yell County six days ago, and happened on Mattie alone. He... Well, he attempted to kill her, but she fought him off and damn near killed him, truth be told. I got to Dardanelle that very night and when I realised that the local law enforcement would not assist me, I made to continue after the man. Mattie does not have much faith in my abilities, and insisted on coming along.\" Mattie glared at LaBoeuf. He had adapted fine to her presence, and seemed to welcome her company over the last few days. Now here he was putting on a big show for Cogburn. \"I know I do not need to tell you to pay no mind to LaBoeuf's guff, Marshall,\" she said. \"Cunningham has one hundred dollars in cash money which he stole from me, and I want it back. I will get it back.\" \"That will be quite a feat,\" Cogburn replied. \"Why is that?\" Mattie asked. \"Because Cunningham is gone. I have been here for the better part of a day and he was already gone when I got here. I expect your hundred dollars in cash money is lining the register drawers of every watering hole on this street, and resting on a few bureaus and in some garter belts, besides.\" \"Cogburn,\" LaBoeuf said, a warning in his tone. He spared Mattie a glance, and then cleared his throat. \"Have you any idea of where he may have gone, or has the trail gone cold?\" \"He has gone to Arkadelphia,\" Cogburn replied. He took a swig of his whiskey. LaBoeuf stared at him, incredulous. \"You know this and yet you have not pursued him? When did you discern this information?\" \"Earlier today. Seems Cunningham has loose lips when he's got a drink in him and a dancing girl on his knee.\" Cogburn laughed at this, and polished off his drink. LaBoeuf was not quite so amused. \"You could be near Arkadelphia by now if you had not tarried. And for what? So you could get your fill of drink and gambling and dancing girls yourself, I have no doubt. I thought I had witnessed the depth of your inattention to duty five years ago, but I see now that you can sink lower still.\" \"You were quite willing to delay the start of your pursuit in order to make sure I stayed put in Yell County. This is not so very different,\" Mattie pointed out. In truth, she agreed with LaBoeuf, but his high-handedness rankled her as it always did. \"Not so very different? No, it is not so very different excepting that I offered to stay so that you would feel safe. I suppose you will say that Cogburn wished to do the same for the town's stores of whiskey,\" LaBoeuf replied. He fixed her with a look which was downright petulant. \"Do not be ridiculous,\" Mattie replied. She turned back to Rooster. \"Are you going to continue your pursuit of Cunningham, Marshall? If so, when did you plan to depart?\" \"In the morning. I have seen the sights of Hot Springs, and I do not care to see much more.\" \"We will go with you,\" LaBoeuf said. \"The two of us can discuss the matter of the bounty later.\" \"The two of you? What about my share of the bounty?\" Mattie asked. LaBoeuf and Rooster both turned and looked at her. \"Your share?\" LaBoeuf echoed. \"Yes, my share. I am assisting in Cunningham's capture the same as you two are, am I not? This is not as it was before; I am not employing either of you to catch him for me. I want my one hundred dollars in cash money back, and if the three of us apprehend the man, I am entitled to one third of the bounty on his head,\" Mattie replied. \"It seems my punishment for tarrying here in Hot Springs has been delivered swiftly in the form of the two of you,\" Rooster said. \"For now I must not only tolerate your chatter, but I must lose two thirds of my pay, as well.\" \"If that is your view on the matter, Mr. LaBoeuf and I are doing just fine on our own and can continue on without you,\" Mattie replied, standing up. \"We need not waste any more time here. Come along, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Do not tell me to 'come along.' I am not one of your field hands,\" LaBoeuf said. \"We will carry on as a company. We can talk terms tomorrow, when we are on the track again.\" He did not say this to Mattie, but directly to Rooster, who looked at LaBoeuf for a long moment before he nodded in reply. Mattie narrowed her eyes, sensing that some conversation was happening to which she was not privy, but she said nothing. \"Come,\" LaBoeuf said. He reached out and grasped the sleeve of her coat. \"We ought to secure lodgings for the night.\" \"You are not my field hand and I am not yours, so you have no cause to order me about, either,\" Mattie replied. She looked at Cogburn. \"Where do you plan on staying tonight, Marshall?\" \"I have a room upstairs,\" he replied, gesturing vaguely at the upper floor of the hotel. \"I wonder whether they have rooms available,\" Mattie began. \"Perhaps -\" \"We will go find a boarding house and return to make our plans after we have had our supper,\" LaBoeuf interrupted, tipping his hat to Rooster. He closed his hand around Mattie's wrist and pulled her away from the table. \"You are behaving very strangely. Not to mention that you are being violent and rude,\" Mattie said as he dragged her out of the hotel. The sun was setting quickly and the street was lit by the gas lamps in the windows of the hotels and taverns. \"The hour is late and it may be a hard task finding rooms elsewhere. Should we not at least inquire as to whether there are any vacant rooms here?\" \"This is a rough establishment,\" LaBoeuf said, leading her to the post where Alma and Sal were hitched. \"We will find a boarding house that is more suitable. Your mother would not want you to stay there, surely.\" \"Marshall Cogburn is staying there.\" \"He is no longer a Federal Marshall,\" LaBoeuf replied, and he sounded annoyed. \"All right, but I do not see why we should not stay with him. Would that not be the most reasonable course? The Princess Hotel is not fancy, but that is all right. It would not cost us much and we would get an earlier start in the morn-\" \"Why will you never defer to my superior wisdom? Why do you insist on questioning every decision I make?\" \"Despite what you may think, I do not conduct myself in this manner with an aim of vexing you,\" Mattie replied. \"I question this decision because it does not reason to walk across a strange town to find room and board when we might at least have made an inquiry about vacancies there.\" LaBoeuf exhaled heavily, his eyes narrowed. It was clear that he was considerably aggravated. \"The Princess Hotel is a gambling room and a brothel, and you would not be safe or easy there. Such establishments are the typical 'bill of fare' for your hero Rooster Cogburn, but I reckon that the degree of offense you would suffer in staying there would be too great even for you, who so enjoys being righteously offended.\" \"Oh,\" Mattie replied merely, frowning. She was annoyed with LaBoeuf's patronizing lordliness, but she also felt puzzled that he would concern himself with keeping her from ugly and dangerous places. She could not help but marvel that he still thought her so delicate. \"I wonder that you are familiar enough with brothels and gambling rooms that you were able to recognize one so readily,\" Mattie said. She pulled her arm free from his hold, and began to unhitch Alma. \"It is beneath my dignity to respond to the implication you are making, so I will merely say that as an officer of the law, I am familiar with all of the places where criminals find their kind,\" LaBoeuf replied, in a rather testy tone of voice. Seeing no gain in provoking him further, Mattie brought Alma around to the hitching post and mounted. LaBoeuf did the same, and began leading them back up the street towards the train depot. LaBoeuf again stopped and asked the boy selling hot peanuts for directions. The boy suggested the Hickory boarding house, which was only one block from the depot. They found the Hickory to be small and unadorned but neat enough and, in Mattie's opinion, as respectable as could be expected in this curious town. There were two rooms left, and gladly Mattie and LaBoeuf took them. By the time they had seen to the horses and washed and changed – Mattie trading her trousers for the dun brown calico dress she had brought – it was suppertime. Mattie came down from her room and found LaBoeuf standing at the bottom of the staircase. He had evidently been waiting for her, for he looked up at her approach and cleared his throat. \"Let us hope that the food here is more generous than at the Monarch boarding house,\" he said under his breath as she descended the stairs and fell into step beside him. He seemed to be back in a more conciliatory mood. They took two seats at the long table in the dining room. LaBoeuf pulled a chair out for her before seating himself next to her. Mattie glanced at him, wondering at his changeableness, but his face revealed nothing as he removed his hat and placed it under his chair. The supper was good enough. It was boiled ham with potatoes and cabbage, served with thick slices of bread with butter, as well as apple sauce and pickles whose spicy taste was novel to Mattie. Her mother's pickles were mellower in flavour, and sweeter. Mattie enjoyed these peculiar new pickles very much. \"I have no quarrel with your cornbread, but I own that it is a pleasant change to have a slice of bread,\" LaBoeuf said in a low voice. \"I hope you will not take offense to my saying so.\" \"I take no offense at all, for I agree with you,\" Mattie replied. \"I like these pickles, as well. We do not make them so spicy at home, but I own that perhaps ours could be improved in this way.\" \"In Texas I believe it is customary to add the seeds of a hot pepper to your pickle brine for extra spice. You ought to get yourself some hot pepper seeds and try it.\" \"I did not realise the two of you were traveling together, Mr. LaBoeuf, Miss Ross,\" came a voice from the head of the table. It was Mrs. Lovett, the widow who owned the Hickory boarding house. She was a small lady with dark brown eyes and a peering expression that reminded Mattie of a sparrow. Her hair was grey, and she wore \"widow's weeds\" and a tiny pair of spectacles perched on her nose. \"If I had but known this, I would have tried to make some arrangement to room you closer together. As it is, you are in opposite ends of the house!\" She giggled. Her laugh was a high, twittering sound. \"The proximity of our rooms is irrelevant, for we are only staying this one night,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf's elbow nudged hers. \"That said, we thank you for your concern.\" \"My dear, it is my pleasure. Although I think perhaps it is your loving parents, wherever they may be, whom I am doing a good turn by keeping some distance between you and Mr. LaBoeuf.\" Mrs. Lovett smiled conspiratorially at Mattie before letting loose a fresh peel of giggles. LaBoeuf made a sort of choking noise in his throat, but Mattie continued to stare at Mrs. Lovett in shock. \"Mrs. Lovett, I assure you that whatever assumption you have made about Mr. LaBoeuf and myself is unfounded. Mr. LaBoeuf is accompanying me strictly for business reasons.\" \"Not to worry, dears. You are not the first couple to come here on the sly, and I doubt you will be the last. Your little deception is safe with me. Will you be getting married tomorrow?\" \"There is no deception,\" Mattie replied, becoming annoyed. \"Mr. LaBoeuf is a friend and a travelling companion and that is all. We have no plans to marry, on the sly or otherwise!\" \"You ought not to be so picky,\" said another guest, an older man sitting across from Mattie whose face was craggy and rough with day old stubble. He leaned his elbows on the table and pointed at her with his fork. \"With that sour face and your arm besides, you are a spinster in the making, and that is a fact.\" Mattie clenched her fork in her hand and took a steadying breath as she glared at the uncouth boor of a man. Before she could speak, however, LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"Now, see here,\" he said. \"That is no way to speak to a lady, spinster or no. I must insist that you apologize to her immediately.\" The man eyed LaBoeuf for a moment, as though weighing the merits of \"calling his bluff.\" He must have found his own hand wanting, for his eyes slid to Mattie's. \"Beg your pardon, miss,\" he said. He returned to eating his supper, eyes fixed on his plate, and said nothing more. \"Ma'am, I must beg your pardon as well for disrupting your fine meal with this foolishness,\" LaBoeuf said, looking down the table at Mrs. Lovett. \"But I assure you that what Miss Ross says is the Gospel truth – we are not eloping sweethearts or anything of the sort. There is nothing romantic or untoward about our errand.\" Mrs. Lovett leaned forward, seemingly eager to learn more of this errand, however unromantic it may be, but another guest distracted her, and she turned away. \"I think our landlady has been tippling the sherry,\" LaBoeuf said softly to Mattie. Mattie did not reply. She did not care to say anything more at this table, which was apparently populated with gawkers and busybodies. It perturbed her also that her word alone was not enough to silence them, but LaBoeuf's was. After supper, they retreated to the front porch, where LaBoeuf stood against one of the whitewashed wooden pillars by the steps and smoked his pipe. Night had fallen, and rather than retiring for the evening, the people of Hot Springs were out in the streets in all their finery. At a hotel across the street, a couple climbed into a smart black carriage with wheels whose bright yellow paint gleamed in the light of the gas lamps. The lady wore a fine green velvet dress, and had some kind of black fur wrap for her bare shoulders. Mattie had never seen anything quite like it before, but did not care to say so to LaBoeuf. \"Well,\" he said, once he had finished smoking his pipe. He cast a contemplative look over her. \"I am going to hunt Rooster down and make arrangements for tomorrow. You need not come if you do not care to. The Lord alone knows what kind of rough bughouse he will have installed himself in by now.\" Mattie regarded him. She had trusted his word the day they agreed to set out for Cunningham, but he had bamboozled her. Although they had gotten along all right since, she did not trust that he would not, once again, come to some kind of agreement with Cogburn behind her back. \"No,\" she said finally. \"I believe I will go with you. It is likely that I will never find myself in Hot Springs again, and so I would like to have a look at the place before we depart.\" \"All right,\" LaBoeuf said. He took a step closer to her and held his elbow out. Peering curiously up at him, she took it. \"What say we give those horses a rest and go on foot?\" Taken aback by his odd gallantry, she allowed him to lead her down the steps and out onto the sidewalk. They headed back in the direction of the Princess Hotel, a route which took them through the finer part of Hot Springs, and then the rougher part. Mattie had never been in so wild and lawless a place. Even the western territories were by comparison rather civilized; here there was scarce evidence of any kind of civilization whatsoever. Or at least there was scarce evidence of the better parts of it. Instead there was only drink, and vice, and debaucheries of every imaginable sort. Each tavern they passed was packed with men, so many that they spilled out into the street with regularity, bringing their loud shouts of laughter and their violence with them. More than once on their journey they passed men engaged in a scuffle. None of what Mattie saw altered her view that men behaved like beasts when permitted, and were all the more beastly when they had drink in them. The angle of LaBoeuf's arm was stiff and did not allow Mattie much freedom to manoeuvre. She supposed he did it in an effort to keep her from harm, but it was bothersome all the same. As they side-stepped two men fighting right in the street, Mattie spoke. \"What do you suppose prompts them to such violence? Is it the drink alone?\" \"In my experience it is usually cards, or a woman, or some prior disagreement or conflict of tempers. I will own that the drink does not assist in pacifying anyone, however,\" LaBoeuf said. Mattie thought to say that, if that was so, LaBoeuf ought to know better than to drink at all, but things had been quarrelsome enough between them for one day, and so she said nothing. They soon arrived once more at the Princess Hotel, which was now crowded with drinkers and gamblers. The press of bodies was close enough once they were inside that Mattie extracted her arm from LaBoeuf's grip and followed behind until he found Rooster seated alone at a small table near the back of the room. \"Here I thought both of you would have recollected your wits and decided to bow out,\" Rooster said as Mattie and LaBoeuf sat down at the table. \"What, and leave you here?\" Mattie asked. \"What purpose is there in going ahead as separate parties when we can go ahead as friends?\" Taking her question to be rhetorical, Rooster did not reply, and took a swig of his drink instead. \"We have secured lodgings at the Hickory boarding house,\" LaBoeuf said. \"How did you sign the register, there, LaBoeuf? Is she masquerading as your deputy, or your wife?\" LaBoeuf fixed Rooster with a look. Mattie could tell that he was beginning to find Rooster tiresome already, but he did not give voice to his aggravation. \"I thought we might discuss our course of action for tomorrow,\" he said. \"There is nothing to discuss,\" Rooster replied. \"I do not think that is true. For one, there is the matter of the bounty -\" LaBoeuf began, but Rooster interrupted him by dispatching the remainder of his drink and standing up, his chair falling to the floor behind him with a clatter. \"I will depart at first light and head south to Arkadelphia. Until then, I aim to go on a spree. You two may do as you like,\" Rooster said. With that, he turned and departed. \"Well,\" said LaBoeuf, looking uncomfortable. Mattie regarded him. \"Do not let me keep you from your fun.\" \"My fun?\" \"Yes, your fun. Are you not going to join one of these card games, or see a music hall show, or visit one of the bathhouses?\" LaBoeuf seemed to consider something as he looked at her. \"This town offers many diversions, but none interesting enough to tempt me. They do not resemble my idea of 'fun.'\" \"What then is your idea of fun, if it is not drinking or gambling or whoring?\" LaBoeuf's face reddened. \"One hardly knows how to respond to a question served with such sauce, especially from a supposed lady, but I will allow it,\" he said. \"When my duties do not demand my immediate attention, I will pass the time by reading. If the weather is fine, I enjoy fishing and hunting. I am not a great admirer of parlour games. They are too silly for my liking. I do like to hear music, although I have no aptitude for it myself.\" \"I enjoy music as well,\" Mattie replied. \"I used to play the piano, although Mama is the true virtuoso in the family. Victoria has the voice of a songbird, and Papa used to play the fiddle. Little Frank has tried to pick the instrument up, but he is easily distracted and will not practice. We used to have ourselves a merry time when we were all together.\" \"Am I to understand that you no longer play the piano, then?\" \"I am able to pick out a simple melody and play a duet. My days of playing alone came to an end when I fell down that pit full of rattlesnakes,\" Mattie replied. \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf said. \"I did warn you away from that pit.\" Mattie scoffed. \"That is true. What you did not warn me about was that the kick of your Sharps-Carbine was worse than that of a mule.\" \"Be that as it may, I wager it saved all of our skins that day,\" LaBoeuf replied, a smile tugging at the corner of his mouth as he looked at her. \"I think your sharp aim had as much to do with it, even if you are suddenly too humble to own to it,\" Mattie said. LaBoeuf looked at her in apparent puzzlement, as though he was trying to decide where the insult lay. His eyes moved above her face, and he cocked his head. \"Your hair could use some attention,\" he said. Mattie looked away, her hand smoothing self-consciously over her plaits. Over the last two days, she had been unable to tidy it more than tucking errant wisps back in, and she knew she must look a shambles. Suddenly she felt mortified beyond what was appropriate to the situation. She stood, wanting to be alone. \"I think I will retire, Mr. LaBoeuf. We still have a long journey ahead of us when we leave this place, and I will take advantage of a comfortable sleep while I may. Goodnight.\" With that, she turned and left him sitting in the tavern. He said her name once as she walked away, but she did not turn back. Mattie walked back to the boarding house alone. The streets were hardly deserted, however. It seemed the people of Hot Springs did not care to keep the hours of decent folk. One tavern's signage boasted of a musical revue of \"dancing girls,\" and as Mattie passed it, she could hear wild piano music coming from within. She paused in the long rectangle of light produced by the gas lamps inside, and caught a glimpse of rich red wallpaper and curtains edged with gold braid. Two women with bare shoulders and painted faces stood on a low stage, singing a bawdy tune. \"You planning on coming inside, or are you just trying to finagle a free show?\" asked a man who leaned in the doorway to the tavern. \"I want no part in your 'show' at all, no matter if it is free or not. I aim to steer clear of hell in the hereafter. You may do as you please,\" Mattie replied. She turned on her heel and hurried down the street and around the corner to their boarding house. After stopping in to check on Alma and feed her a piece of dried apple, Mattie went up to her little room and latched the door behind her. The boarding house seemed safe enough, but one never knew what to expect in strange places filled with strange people. Mattie changed into her nightgown, goose bumps breaking out on her skin as the cool night air touched it. She sat on the edge of the bed then and removed the pins from her hair, unwinding her plaits until her hair fell all around her shoulders. She brushed it out until it crackled with static. Then she painstakingly wove it into one long, uneven plait which fell plainly down the middle of her back. She said her prayers, and blew out the lamp, and went to sleep. It seemed to her she had only been asleep a short while when she was awoken by a sound at her door. The doorknob rattled, and there was a thump, followed by the low, muffled sound of a curse. Mattie sat up and lit the lamp. \"Who is there?\" she asked warily. \"LaBoeuf,\" came the reply. Frowning, Mattie pulled her dress on over her head and went to the door. She unlatched it and opened it a crack to find LaBoeuf peering in at her. She opened the door the rest of the way. \"It is you, Mr. LaBoeuf! You had me worrying that a stranger was at my door. What time is it? Is something the matter?\" LaBoeuf stood there in the dim light of the hallway, and he seemed to sway on his feet for a moment before steadying himself with a hand on the doorjamb. \"Cogburn is drunk,\" he said. The stench of whiskey wafted off of him and Mattie stiffened. \"From the smell of you, it would seem he is not the only one,\" she replied. \"Hm,\" LaBoeuf said. He leaned forward, peering over her shoulder. \"How is your room? It is to your satisfaction?\" \"I am sure it would be fine if I could but sleep in it, as that is its intended purpose. Why are you here?\" \"This is a rough place, and my room is quite far from yours, and so I thought...\" His words trailed off and he regarded her silently, his eyes drifting down to her throat. He frowned. \"Those bruises do not look much better.\" He reached out one hand, and his thumb brushed against the exposed skin above her collar. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mattie exclaimed, jumping back and clutching her collar closed. LaBoeuf snatched his hand back as surely as if she had rapped his knuckles. \"It is not enough that you are imposing on me at my bedroom door, but now you think you can molest me in this way? I thought better of your manners than this, but I see I was right about drink putting the devil in you.\" LaBoeuf gave her a look which was at once chastened and annoyed, and he seemed to be biting back some retort. \"For the sake of peace I said nothing about your entering my bedroom to leave your letter the other day, but now you give me cause to revisit that offense,\" Mattie said. \"You are the very soul of arrogance. You are pompous, and audacious, and there will come a day when you will be humbled in your hubris. If not by human means, then by God's own hand. A woman is not safe leaving her door unlocked with you about.\" LaBoeuf stepped back as though she had hit him in the chest. He seemed battered by her words, and opened his mouth to reply, but Mattie did not afford him the chance, instead shutting the door in his face and latching it. Mattie stared at the door, her chest tight and hot with anger. He was the most insufferable man on earth, she was certain. After a moment, she heard him stir, and walk slowly down the hallway, the sound of his spurs dulled by his inebriated steps. She went back to her bed and extinguished the lamp, but it was quite some time before she was able to fall back to sleep.[Chapter 6] Thanks for all the guesses as to why I gave LaBoeuf the name Virgil. They were all great guesses, but his namesake is actually the speaker in The Band's classic song \"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\" Virgil Caine. :) Thanks also for all the thoughtful and enthusiastic reviews - I'm so glad that you're all out there reading and enjoying this story, and knowing you're out there keeps me writing. Mattie stood in her little room at the Hickory boarding house, peering through the semi-darkness at the clothes laid out on her bed. She had brushed her hair and tied it back with a thin piece of string at the nape of her neck, and scrubbed herself with fresh cold water from the pitcher until her skin was pink. The result of her efforts with her hair was not as tidy as she would have liked, but there was nothing to be done about it. She quickly dressed in Little Frank's shirt and trousers, rolled up her dress and nightgown in her pack, and gathered the rest of her things. She went downstairs, finding the house quiet but for some stirring in the kitchen. Leaving her pack in the foyer, Mattie went outside to see to the horses. When she stepped into the dim stable, she found Sal was already tacked and resting in her stall. Mattie quickly groomed Alma and checked her hooves before tacking her up and hurrying back to the house. LaBoeuf sat on a chair on the front porch, smoking his pipe. He did not look at her as she ascended the steps and paused before the front door. She was about to speak when he cleared his throat. \"Mrs. Lovett tells me breakfast will be ready shortly,\" he said, still not looking at her. Mattie regarded him speculatively. \"If I go in to eat, will you quit this place and attempt to rouse Cogburn and depart before I can catch you?\" LaBoeuf puffed once more on his pipe, and then stood and knocked the ashes out over the edge of the porch rail. He tucked the pipe into his coat, and stepped around her to open the door. \"That is not my aim,\" he said, and went inside. The door closed behind him. Mattie looked out over the street. Smoke was beginning to rise from the chimneys and stovepipes, drawing thin blue lines against the pale sky. A mule cart piled high with cord wood was driving slowly down the street. The town of Hot Springs was awakening. Mattie turned and went inside, into the dining room. Several of the other boarders were awake now, seated around the table, serving themselves from crocks and platters and tureens. Mattie sat down in the empty seat across from LaBoeuf, and filled her plate with fried eggs, biscuits, and grits. She refused the coffee that was offered to her by Mrs. Lovett. There was no buttermilk to be had. LaBoeuf did not speak to her during the meal, nor as they prepared to leave, nor as they made their way back to the Princess Hotel to retrieve Rooster. Mattie attempted twice to draw him out, but both times he behaved as though he had not heard her speak. She gave up her efforts and rode at his side in silence. When they arrived at the Princess Hotel, Rooster was waiting out front, mounted on a bay quarter horse gelding who stood resting one of his hind feet and snoozing, even in the din of the busy street. Rooster was smoking a cigarette. \"Hm,\" Rooster said when Mattie and LaBoeuf came to a stop before him. \"I thought we agreed that she would be on a train by now.\" \"What do you mean?\" Mattie asked, although she suspected what the two men were up to. \"We talked it through last night, me and Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Rooster replied. \"We both have a mind to put you on the train back to Yell County, but we reckon you will not go, and will make trouble for us if we attempt to use force on you. What do you say, sis?\" \"I say you can be certain I will make trouble for you,\" Mattie said. \"You are trying to cheat me out of my one third share of the bounty, to say nothing of my one hundred dollars in cash money which I intend to retrieve from Cunningham. If you think you can simply put me on the train to Dardanelle and hear nothing more about it, you are both fools. That is larceny and I will take it to law.\" \"There you have it,\" said LaBoeuf, in a smug tone. \"I told you that I attempted to get shot of her to no avail.\" Mattie glared at him. \"A blind simpleton could have tracked you along the Arkansas River. If that was your best attempt at 'getting shot' of me, you ought to give consideration to another line of work.\" LaBoeuf glowered back at her for a moment, but did not reply. Rooster seemed to be struggling to stifle a smile. He eyed Mattie. \"I hope you will keep your lawyer at bay this time. I have no desire to be berated.\" \"I left a letter for Lawyer Daggett at home. Although you were of course not mentioned, I was very clear in saying that I had chosen this course for myself and would not be deterred. You will not be bothered,\" Mattie assured him. \"All right, then,\" Rooster said. He stuck his cigarette between his lips and gathered his reins in his hands. \"Looks like you are out of luck again, LaBoeuf.\" With that, Rooster chirruped to his horse and started down the street in the direction of their course. Mattie gave LaBoeuf one final look to express her displeasure, which he returned in kind. Mattie supposed that their friendship, such as it was, had met its end. She urged Alma onwards, and fell into step behind Rooster. Whether LaBoeuf followed or not, she found she hardly cared. There was little conversation between the three of them as they travelled south towards Arkadelphia. It was slow going through those parts, for there were few clear roadways. They found themselves picking their way slowly between the slender trunks of pine trees instead of riding easy on the wide highway. Mattie thought that the ride to Arkadelphia would only take a day, but as the sun crested in the sky and then began its descent towards the western horizon, she realised that they would have to stop and make camp in the woods that night. Finally the silence grew tiresome to her, and she cleared her throat. \"It seems a strange coincidence for the three of us to find ourselves together once more,\" Mattie said. \"It has the air of divine providence about it.\" \"Divine providence,\" Rooster repeated, in a rather mocking tone. \"If being saddled with the two of you is divine providence, I reckon God has a cruel sense of humour.\" \"Marshal Cogburn, that is blasphemy,\" Mattie scolded. \"I am sure that blasphemy is the least of his sins,\" LaBoeuf muttered from behind her. \"It may be blasphemy,\" Rooster said, not having heard LaBoeuf, \"but it is true all the same. I ought to have stayed in Texas, but I got it into my head that it was time for the wind to change, and this reward money was the way to change it. Fool notion if there ever was one.\" Rooster's tongue loosened then, and he began to talk of what he had been up to during the last several years. He spoke of his adventures as a range detective, of fence-cutters and cattle thieves. Mattie glanced over her shoulder more than once to see what LaBoeuf thought about Rooster's tales, him being a lawman from cattle country himself, but he said nothing, and pretended he did not notice her. The sun sank below the trees, and they stopped in a small holler in the hills to make their camp. LaBoeuf strung a line for the horses while Mattie gathered firewood and a pail of water from a nearby stream. Rooster sat leaning against a hollow tree rolling a cigarette and dropping tobacco all over himself. Although the waste perturbed her, Mattie did not stop to help him, for she did not approve of his laziness. Mattie made a little stew of salt pork and beans, with the last of the cornbread to sop it up. They had eaten almost all of their food, and their breakfast in the morning would be meagre. \"We must stop for supplies in Arkadelphia if we do not apprehend Cunningham there,\" Mattie said when they had finished their meal and were sitting around the campfire with the darkness deepening all about them. \"Perhaps fortune will be on our side and we will catch up with him.\" \"Fortune, or plum luck,\" Rooster replied. He sat smoking a cigarette and nursing a bottle of whiskey. Mattie's mood had darkened when he pulled out the bottle, for she was not keen to tolerate Rooster's particular brand of drunkenness. Her only consolation was that he did not offer any to LaBoeuf, and that LaBoeuf seemed to have run dry of his own store of whiskey. He sat opposite her, across the fire, smoking his pipe. \"If we can force some good information from Cunningham's folks, we may yet catch up to him,\" LaBoeuf said. \"That is a lot to hinge on one 'if,'\" Rooster replied. LaBoeuf huffed out a short sigh to show his annoyance. \"If you had pursued Cunningham with the expediency you ought to have, you might have him in hand, and Miss Ross and I would both be headed back to our respective homes. So you must pardon me if I am not interested in your criticisms of our present course.\" Rooster had nothing to say to this, and took a swig from his bottle instead. After tapping the ashes from his pipe, LaBoeuf lay down on his bedroll, put his hat over his face, and proceeded to ignore them both. Mattie and Rooster were quiet for some time, the stillness of the night disturbed only by the crackling of the fire. Mattie looked over at Rooster, examining his face in the firelight. He had aged since last she saw him, and did not look well. \"I was sorry that you did not stay in Fort Smith long enough for me to pay you the reward which I promised you,\" Mattie said. She looked down at her hand in her lap, and her voice softened. \"Your departure also robbed me of the opportunity to properly thank you.\" Rooster said nothing. \"Did you receive any of my letters?\" Mattie asked. \"Two or three,\" he replied. \"I see. Has no one ever informed you that it is customary, when you receive a letter inquiring after your health, to send a reply in kind?\" \"Hm,\" he said. He glanced at her. \"How is that arm of yours?\" \"As well as can be expected,\" Mattie replied. \"You get used to it,\" he said. \"Yes, you do.\" There was a pause. Rooster did not seem eager to share news with Mattie, forcing her to ask questions of him. \"How does the widow Potter?\" she asked. \"Or should I say, your wife?\" Rooster made a grumbling sort of noise in his throat. \"We did marry some time ago in San Antonio. In the spring I took sick. She got it in her head that I had the 'French pox.' It weren't. Just ague. Anyhow, she was set against me, and so I left. Been rambling the ranges since. Damn fool woman.\" \"Perhaps you could go back to her now. She will see that you are not ill, and that she was in the wrong.\" \"Too much trouble. Women are altogether too much trouble.\" \"All fools are troublesome, regardless of their sex,\" Mattie replied. \"I reckon you are right about that,\" Rooster said. He threw the butt of his cigarette into the fire and took a pull from his bottle. \"Tell me, sis. Your meeting with Cunningham, did it happen as LaBoeuf told it to me? He said the man tried to throttle you and you near cut his head clean off with a broken bottle.\" \"That was the way of it,\" Mattie confirmed. \"Hm,\" Rooster replied. He was silent for a spell, staring into the fire. Finally he looked up and caught her eye. \"Good girl. Too bad you did not quite manage it. To be short one like him in this world would be a fine thing, whether I go without that reward money or not.\" Mattie did not have a response to this, and so she said nothing, settling instead for staring once more into the fire. She thought about Cunningham, and the afternoon he fell upon her, and how she believed she had killed him, and how she had not felt one ounce of remorse for the bloody deed. Mattie frowned, and shifted her seat on the hard ground. She felt tired right down to her bones. \"I think I will sleep now,\" she said, sitting up to reach for her blanket, which she had warming by the fire. \"I think I will sit for a while yet ,\" Rooster replied, as Mattie arranged her bed. \"Perhaps tomorrow you can tell me what you have been doing to keep yourself busy up there in Yell County.\" \"Perhaps,\" she replied, smiling. Mattie lay down with her head resting against her saddle. Although she was very tired, she did not fall immediately to sleep. With her eyes closed, she listened to the sound of the fire slowly dying, and of LaBoeuf's soft nearby snores, and of Rooster humming almost too low to be heard: The cuckoo is a pretty bird, she warbles as she flies; she brings us glad tidings, and tells us no lies. They arrived in Arkadelphia the following afternoon. It rained steadily all that day as they rode through the foothills of the Ouachita Mountains. The pine woods gave way to forests filled largely with bare trees, their wet bark black against the grey sky. Some trees still had their shrivelled brown leaves attached, but not many. The weather put them all in a bad humour, and they did not talk much at all until they crossed into the outskirts of Arkadelphia. \"There is the post office,\" Rooster said, pointing as they rode three abreast down what appeared to be the main street of the town. It was a wide avenue, with many businesses flanking each side. Many of the buildings were brick, and seemed quite fine. \"Ought to be able to find out where we can find Cunningham's people there, if the clerk is obliging.\" \"We will question him and get our information, whether he is obliging or not,\" said LaBoeuf. \"We will question him?\" Rooster repeated. \" She will question him.\" He gestured with his reining hand at Mattie as they came to a stop in front of the squat clapboard building which advertised itself as the post office. \"You cannot think to send a woman in to do the work of the law,\" LaBoeuf replied, a measure more scorn in his voice than Mattie thought was necessary. \"I can make inquiries and discern a lie as competently as either of you,\" she said. LaBoeuf spared her a withering glance, as though she were nothing more than a tiresome child. \"We are strangers here, and it is clear enough that you and I have a particular kind of business with the Cunninghams,\" Rooster said. \"If the clerk is a friend to those people, he may not talk. Mattie can play that she is a distant relation or some such, and the clerk will take more kindly to that, so long as she is not too peppery in her manner.\" \"'Not too peppery'?\" LaBoeuf repeated. \"Haw!\" Mattie glowered at him, but did not favour him with a reply of any kind, \"peppery\" or not. \"Also that arm of hers will invite pity, which may grease the wheels,\" Rooster said. Mattie's glare shifted from LaBoeuf to Rooster. That may have indeed been true, but he did not have to say it. Silently she dismounted Alma and tied her to the hitching post outside the post office. Rooster and LaBoeuf followed suit. Mattie made to go inside, but LaBoeuf caught her by the elbow. \"You be careful, now,\" he said. Mattie pulled her arm out of his grasp. \"I am sure I will scarcely be able to muddle my way through this task without you by my side, puffing up your chest and singing the praises of the Texas Rangers to anyone who cannot escape quickly enough.\" Her words contained more sarcasm than she typically liked to give, but LaBoeuf was intolerable. She turned and strode into the post office, the bell over the door tinkling to announce her. The post office was a small room divided across the centre by a low counter topped with fine wooden latticework that stretched to the ceiling. Behind it, a clerk was sorting mail into the large honeycomb of mail slots which covered the rear wall. A narrow door led to a room behind. \"I'll be with you in a moment,\" said the clerk, without turning to look at her. \"Do not trouble; I am in no great hurry,\" Mattie replied, attempting to soften her voice. She frowned. She did not think of herself as harsh, only forthright, but this playacting was a stretch for her. The clerk turned around and came to the counter. He was a young man who she guessed to be about her age, still \"wet behind the ears\" and just old enough to use a razor. He was nice looking enough, with dark hair, combed and oiled, and brown eyes. Looking at her expectantly, his eyes dropped to her short arm. The slightest frown creased his brow, and when his eyes met hers again, they were equally full of curiosity and pity. \"How may I help you, miss?\" he asked. Mattie inhaled a deep breath and swallowed her irritation. \"My name is Victoria Cunningham, and I am looking for relations I have here. I visited your town only once, many years ago, so I do not remember their exact address. I was hoping you might assist me. My cousin's name is Albert Cunningham.\" \"Oh,\" the clerk said, his eyes dimming somewhat. \"Miss, I regret to tell you that there has been some unpleasant business with your cousin which may interrupt your plans.\" \"What kind of unpleasant business?\" \"It is an unseemly thing to speak of, Miss.\" \"Please,\" Mattie said, stifling her impatience. \"I would like for you to tell me what has happened.\" The clerk looked troubled a moment, and then he sighed. \"Some weeks ago, the body of a young woman was pulled from the Oauchita River. I will spare you the grisly details. The sheriff believes that Albert Cunningham is responsible, and there is a warrant out for him.\" \"I see,\" Mattie replied. \"How terrible. I am sure my dear aunt must be heartsick. Will you please tell me where I might find her?\" \"Of course,\" the clerk said, \"of course! I would only be too happy to assist you in that regard.\" He took a pad of notepaper and a pencil, and began to write. When he was finished, he tore the sheet from the pad, and paused with it clasped between his fingers. \"Do you know your letters?\" he asked, that pitiful look returning to his eyes again. \"I am literate,\" Mattie replied, her temper growing short. The clerk nodded, and passed her the slip of paper. She read it. He had pencilled a vague location on it in tidy, gently looping script. It described a place out the end of Pine Street. \"Thank you,\" Mattie said. She tucked the paper into her coat pocket. \"You have been most helpful, and I am obliged to you.\" \"It was my pleasure,\" he replied, favouring her with a warm and genuine smile. \"God bless you, miss.\" Mattie did not know how to reply, and so she smiled stiffly and walked out of the little office. It had stopped raining, although the sky was still the colour of gunmetal, and the streets sodden. LaBoeuf and Rooster were leaning against the side of the side of the building, several feet apart, smoking in mutual silence. \"The Cunninghams can be found on Pine Street,\" she announced, handing the slip of paper to Rooster. \"The clerk also informed me that Cunningham is wanted in this place for yet another murder of an innocent person.\" \"We will make a federal marshal of you yet, sister,\" Rooster said, grinning. \"Did you obtain directions to this place?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"None of us are natives of this city.\" \"No, I did not,\" she replied. \"Never mind it,\" Rooster said. \"We can get directions easily enough.\" He tipped his chin at the traffic of wagons and carriages and pedestrians that filled the street. They mounted and did exactly that, asking the way from a man driving an empty coal wagon. He was in his middle years, and had so much coal dust ground into his skin and his clothing that it seemed impossible to Mattie that he could ever wash every bit of it away. The only clean part of him was his bright green eyes. He told them the way they had to go, which was not in town at all, as it happened, but on a country road to the west. He said the place they sought had once been a large farm which produced turnips and carrots and onions enough to feed a quarter of the town, but the family had fallen onto hard times and subsequent disrepute some years ago, and so they sold much of their land, and now there was very little to be said about the place or its people. It did not surprise Mattie to learn that the Cunninghams were trash. They bid the coal man farewell and began riding west. They followed his careful directions, and were soon travelling down a narrow dirt track with bare trees on either side. The landscape continued to flatten as they rode, and the trees to thin, so that soon they found themselves on the open prairie. Little farms were scattered here and there, their houses sheltered by stands of poplars and burr oaks. The coal man had said that they would have to cross a rough \"corduroy\" bridge of logs which spanned a deep crick, and soon after they would see the Cunninghams' place on the north side of the road. It was all exactly as he described, and Mattie was thankful that they had met a man who could boast such knowledge of the peculiarities of the local geography. They soon came upon the place, a rough cabin constructed of logs, well back from the road in a stand of trees. They had passed a sawmill in town, but Mattie guessed that the cabin had been built before the sawmill, and never replaced with a proper house. A kitchen had been added to one side of the building, and it was little more than a lean-to of saplings and mud, with a stovepipe sticking out its slanted roof. Dark smoke rose from the pipe. Mattie thought of the old cabin her father had built when he first married her mother and settled their land in Yell County, and how it stood there still, having been converted to an ice house when he built their current house. Even its little glass windowpanes had been removed and reused. The thought of the ice house, which stayed blessedly cool even in the depth of the muggiest, most unrelenting heat of August, gave Mattie pause. Suddenly she longed for her home. She wondered how Mama and Little Frank and Victoria were faring, and whether they were worried. Perhaps they had given her up for dead already. \"I reckon this is the place,\" Rooster said. His bay quarter horse, Whiskey Jack – who was thus named for his colour, and because he had been won in a game of cards – came to a halt without being told and immediately began tearing weeds and grass up from the ditch. \"What do you say, Cogburn?\" asked LaBoeuf, resting his elbow on the butt of his rifle. \"Do you suppose Cunningham is hiding there? We have no cover here and have therefore lost the advantage of surprise. If he is there, he knows we are coming.\" \"In earnest I doubt he is there. That would be too lucky for us,\" Cogburn replied. \"We ought to tread lightly, though. Never know what's coming down the barrel at you.\" They rode up the path which led to the house. It was little more than a rainwater-filled rut in the surrounding fields, all of which had obviously \"gone to seed.\" Brown grass and weeds grew unkempt on land which, to Mattie's eye, seemed ideal for sweet corn, or feed corn, or hay at the very least. It was a sin to let it lie fallow for as long as it had obviously been left. Stopping in the yard, Rooster cleared his chest and spat on the ground. \"Anyone at home?\" he called. From inside the cabin there came a shuffling, and a sound like a chair being dragged over floorboards. After a moment the front door was opened, but only a dark slender crack, and no face or limb could be seen. \"Who is that out there?\" said a voice from inside. It was a woman's voice, high and thin, and it did not sound particularly feisty. Rooster and LaBoeuf looked at one another, and Mattie guessed they were both weighing whether to be truthful or not. Rooster looked away first. \"It is the law, and we are looking for Albert Cunningham,\" he said. There was a pause, and then the woman spoke again. \"Tie your horses up at the fence over yonder and come inside.\" They did as the woman asked, and shortly found themselves standing inside the cabin. The one-room structure was warm enough, but oily black smoke gathered about the bare log roof from the cook stove, and the place was draughty. Bits of paper and rag had been used to shut up the many holes along the tops of the walls and around the small windows, which did not have glass panes, but instead used a kind of sturdy greased paper which was opaque, and let in very little light. The wood floor was bare and unfinished, and there were gaps between the uneven boards where you could see the dirt beneath. There was not even a simple rag rug to provide warmth or give the place some charm. In Mattie's view it was a sad excuse for a dwelling, especially for one so close to civilization. A rough cabin was one thing up in the mountains or in other wild places. It was quite another when it was only down the road from town. It could have been a cozy place, but little had been done to improve it. The woman, who had introduced herself as Althea Cunningham, was seated by the cook stove, her hands in her lap. She clasped and unclasped them at random, her face lined with nervousness, and she did not seem eager to look at the congress standing in her doorway. \"Ma'am, when was the last time you saw your son?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Not for some months now. He has been down in Texas, working the range,\" she replied, in a wispy, delicate voice. She did not look at them, but continued to stare worriedly at the wall beyond the stove. Rooster and LaBoeuf shared a look. LaBoeuf cleared his throat and continued. \"You do your son little good by lying for him, ma'am. Has he passed through here in the last several days?\" \"I tell you, he is in Texas!\" she whined, turning to LaBoeuf with an entreating expression on her face. \"I have letters from him. I have not had one from him in some time, but I have no doubt that there in Texas is where he remains.\" \"He was in Hot Springs only a few days ago,\" Rooster said. \"He spent time with some fine ladies there, and they were only too eager to tell us all about it. My pard here tracked him to Morrilton before that, and he was up in Yell County just last week. All his crimes have been noted by the local authorities, so let us dispense with your lies and proceed.\" Mrs. Cunningham seemed to deflate then, her shoulders slumping forward and her chin tipping down. She drew in a breath, and blew it out in a sigh. \"He passed through here yesterday. You have just missed him.\" LaBoeuf turned and gave Rooster a reproachful look. \"Did he give any indication of where he was headed?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"No, he did not, and I do not see why it should matter!\" replied Mrs. Cunningham. Her chin quivered, and Mattie could see tears shining in her eyes. \"He is innocent of the crimes for which you hunt him! It is all a grave misunderstanding.\" \"We wish to find him so that he can do no further harm,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Can you not see that after what he has done, that would be best?\" \"He is but a wayward boy, easily swayed by the low company he keeps! Do you not possess a shred of mercy for him between the three of you?\" There was a beat of silence, and then Mattie, LaBoeuf, and Rooster all spoke at once. \"No,\" they said. \"You seem a decent woman, if somewhat soft-hearted,\" Mattie continued, \"and it is not your fault that your son does as he pleases without a thought for another soul. God gave us all free will and how your son uses his own is not your responsibility. I will reserve my pity for you, and for those he harms, not for him.\" Mrs. Cunningham turned her gaze on Mattie. Her guise of pitiful pleading disappeared, and her mouth twisted into a scowl. \"You are a rude and unnatural girl. I can see that the blow God dealt you in that ugly injury of yours has made you bitter. But that is no reason for you to inflict suffering on others. If a man rejects your clumsy advances, you ought to be humbled. You should not then turn about and play at being some kind of victim.\" Mattie was about to make a retort, but LaBoeuf took a step forward. \"Now, see here. I have no desire to speak harshly to a woman, but you mind what you say to her. Your son is a drunkard and a violent coward, and he was fortunate to escape Yell County with his life. He did not deserve to, and had I been present, I would have shot him dead myself. That is a fact.\" The woman sneered at LaBoeuf and said nothing more. \"You have shown your hand,\" Rooster said. \"I see your son has told you all about what fun he has been having, after all.\" \"It is all a grave misunderstanding,\" Mrs. Cunningham repeated, nodding her head resolutely, almost as though she spoke only to her own self. \"Maybe so, but your son is wanted in several jurisdictions, and he has been reckless. The sooner we find him, the less likely it is that he will harm another and find himself in deeper water,\" Rooster said. \"And if you help us, we will not have you prosecuted for giving shelter to a wanted man.\" \"Help you? I would sooner die,\" Mrs. Cunningham said, turning her cold gaze on Rooster. \"Anyhow, he is bound for Texas, a state so large you have little hope of finding him!\" Her haughty smile died on her lips as she realised that she had given her son away. \"Ma'am, I am a Texas Ranger. We will most certainly find him, with or without your assistance,\" LaBoeuf said. Mrs. Cunningham glowered at each of them, and then turned her face away and would not be drawn out. She refused to say another word. They quit the place shortly thereafter, all three of them agreeing that it was unlikely that Cunningham was hiding there, for there was hardly any place to hide. LaBoeuf checked the shed and the smokehouse in the back to be certain, but he found only a meagre supply of split wood and a thin, ailing milk cow. They left, and meandered vaguely in a westward direction as the sun began to set on the horizon. \"Do you think she was telling the truth, Rooster?\" Mattie asked, riding by his side. LaBoeuf rode a few strides behind them. \"I think she surprised herself in doing so, but yes, she was telling the truth,\" Rooster replied. \"Now the trouble is determining where he plans to go in the great state of Texas.\" LaBoeuf pulled up alongside Mattie. \"My guess is he will head to Texarkana first. Thus far he has largely kept to moving straight from town to town, I reckon because he is poorly supplied. We do not know if he even has a horse; he did not have one in Yell County, at least. If he is heading into Texas, he will not bypass Texarkana.\" Rooster seemed to mull this over a minute before nodding. \"I think you are right, pard. It is a long way between here and Texarkana. We may catch up to him yet.\" \"I am confident that we can catch up to him so long as we make prudent use of our time and do not tarry,\" LaBoeuf replied. It was obvious that he remained annoyed about Rooster's delay in Hot Springs. Frankly Mattie did not blame him, but she saw little advantage in clinging to the thing, either. \"We will make good time, all right,\" she said. \"Why, we have already quit Arkadelphia and are headed for Texarkana! We will find somewhere to camp tonight and get a good start in the morning. I am confident we will have Cunningham in hand in no time. Do you not agree, Rooster?\" \"Hm,\" Rooster grumbled. \"Any one of us would likely make better time alone, but that is not to be.\" With that, he urged Whiskey Jack on and pulled ahead of Mattie and LaBoeuf by several strides. He produced a bottle of brown liquor from his saddlebag and commenced to drinking from it. \"If that is Cogburn's idea of making good time, I reckon we are in trouble once again,\" LaBoeuf said. \"You are scarcely any better,\" Mattie replied, although Cogburn's drinking concerned her as well. What if he decided once again in some wild place that he was finished with this business? She would simply have to hope that the prospect of the reward money would be enough to keep him in check. Appealing to his higher nature was not sufficient, it seemed. \"You rise to his defence very readily,\" LaBoeuf observed. His tone was sardonic. \"You and Cogburn have become bosom friends once more, have you?\" \"I do not know what you mean,\" Mattie replied. \"I mean nothing. I am merely observing that the two of you seem to find much to talk of together. You are 'two peas in a pod.' Do you not agree?\" Mattie turned, trying to discern his intent. He had an expression on his face that Mattie had difficulty identifying, excepting that it was obvious he was annoyed. He did not meet her eyes although he must have known she was looking at him. Eventually, she turned away, looking ahead at Rooster's back. \"I do not know to what I am agreeing, because you are not talking sense,\" she said. \"It is strange that you should make a hero of a man who spent the war bushwhacking and keeping company with men so bloodthirsty they make our quarry seem downright gentle in comparison.\" Mattie wondered whether LaBoeuf would stop talking if she stopped responding. \"Ah, I see. You have nothing to say to that, do you? Well, what do you have to say about Cogburn riding alongside the James-Younger boys in those days? You are always eager to share your opinions. Pray, Mattie, tell me what you think about Rooster's long and colourful career.\" Truthfully, Mattie did not think much of many of Rooster's exploits. His morals were changeable at best. But LaBoeuf carrying on in his sarcastic, prideful way was doing nothing to aid his cause, whatever it was. They both knew what kind of man Cogburn was. What purpose was there now in discussing the uglier sides of him? \"You did not need to defend me against that woman,\" Mattie said, by and by. \"I could easily have done so for myself.\" LaBoeuf did not respond immediately. Mattie could feel him looking at her then, scrutinizing her. Eventually he spoke. \"Why do you insist on undermining me at every opportunity?\" \"Undermining you? I do not undermine you at every opportunity,\" Mattie replied. \"If I undermined you at every opportunity with which you present me, I would never require another occupation. Rather, the opposite is true: I have bitten my tongue so many times on this sojourn that I wonder if it will ever recover.\" \"If your tongue is at all diminished during this trip, we should all count ourselves lucky indeed,\" LaBoeuf grumbled. \"Your hubris is very tiresome,\" Mattie said. \"It is no wonder that you spend all your time away from home, chasing criminals in the wilderness. I doubt your colleagues can tolerate you except in very small doses.\" Mattie pressed her calves into Alma's sides, and pulled ahead of LaBoeuf so that the three of them rode in a string. The distance between each of them stretched out until they were only barely connected at all. A passerby might have thought them complete strangers to each other. There was no more riding abreast or passing the time by talking that day, or the next.[Chapter 7] Hey y'all! Thanks for your patience in between updates. This one's a little longer than the last, and hopefully it won't take me ages to get the last several chapters out, as I have about 22,000 words of the rest of the fic written (including the ending, woo hoo!) and I should only need another 7-10,000 to round the whole thing out. Which means I'm actually (incredibly) almost done writing this thing. Yikes! In answer to Nightarcher210's question, I'm not a Neil Gaiman fan, but that has more to do with not having read much of his work than with holding any particular opinion on it. Should I be reading him? Am I a copycat without realising it? Uh oh. :) Cogburn was drunk. There was no mistaking it. He was drunk, and he had been for the two days since they left Arkadelphia. He showed no signs of slowing or stopping. They were camped on the shore of a little crick not far from the town of Hope. It had rained steadily all day, but the trees provided some cover. Rooster had reclined against the wet trunk of a walnut tree the moment they erected a shelter and started up a campfire. Mattie and LaBoeuf did most of the work while Rooster sat drinking. Mattie made them a meal of bacon and beans and cornbread from the supplies they had obtained in Gum Springs, but by the time it was ready, Rooster had fallen dead asleep and would not be roused. Mattie and LaBoeuf ate together in silence, the rain beating a disheartening tattoo on the makeshift canvas roof over their heads. After they ate, LaBoeuf smoked his pipe and Mattie sat to his left, silently staring into the fire, wondering if she ought to be at home with Mama and Little Frank and Victoria, tending the cool weather crops and putting up stores for the long winter ahead, rather than sitting on the cold ground in the wilderness with a drunkard and a Texas cuss who was little better than a snake in the grass. For the first time Mattie truly thought that she may have been a fool to undertake this errand. One such adventure was likely enough for a single lifetime. Perhaps she ought to have let LaBoeuf leave Yell County without her. \"I do not like it,\" LaBoeuf muttered. The sound of his voice after such a long spell of silence startled Mattie, and she looked at him. \"What is it that you do not like?\" she asked. \"I do not like this strangeness that has come up between us and I would like to put it aside,\" he replied, regarding her with great seriousness. He continued, his voice lowered, and Mattie guessed he had rehearsed his words. \"We cannot trust that Cogburn will not do us a bad turn one of these days. Not out of spite or malice, but because he is a drunk and cannot be trusted. I take no pleasure in saying this, but it is the truth. We must make sure that the two of us are of a like mind on this errand, or else it is each man for himself. Or each woman.\" Mattie sighed. \"I am loathe to admit it, but I agree. I reckon we are still on the right track but I do not think that can be credited to Rooster's designs. I think we have been lucky, is all.\" She trailed off, and then frowned as she recalled the earlier part of his speech. \"What did you mean, 'a strangeness'?\" \"I mean this distance that has come between us since Hot Springs,\" he said. \"It had been a rough road before that, I think we can agree, but we had made our peace with each other. We were 'pards' on the trail. Since Hot Springs we have not had more than a few civil words between us, and I do not like it.\" Mattie was surprised and rather embarrassed that he was taking the bull by the horns in this way. Yes, they had fallen out, but Mattie did not think he much cared beyond his wounded pride. Before she could respond, he continued. \"Do you truly believe I would harm you, Mattie? That I would...\" LaBoeuf paused here and frowned, seeming to struggle for his words in a way very unlike him. \"That I would force myself on you, as Cunningham attempted to do?\" Mattie gaped at him, her face flaming at the impertinent subject. \"Why do you ask me this?\" \"In Hot Springs you said a woman is not safe leaving her door unlocked with me about,\" he said. His expression was wary and troubled as he looked at her, and his eyes conveyed some wound she did not realise she had inflicted. \"Oh,\" Mattie replied. She did not know he had taken her words so dearly to heart. \"Aside from the occasional thrashing, I know you would never deliberately do me harm.\" LaBoeuf did not smile at this. He looked away from her, his expression very dour. \"I do not like the impression you seem to have of my character.\" \"What other impression am I to have but the one you have presented me with?\" \"I thought we had made friends of each other. It seemed that way before we reached Hot Springs.\" \"I thought the same. But you were rude and untoward, and then conspired with Rooster to get rid of me despite our prior agreement to go on as pardners. What was I to make of such behaviour?\" LaBoeuf frowned and looked down at the ground, seeming to contemplate her words. \"You are right,\" he said, after a pause. \"I treated you wrongly. I should not have made any such plot with Rooster. I reckoned you would have had enough adventure and would be eager to return home. I was glad, for I thought it would be safer for you. I forgot how dogged you are in your determination.\" Mattie nodded, accepting his apology, demeaning as it was. \"As for the other, I have no excuse. Truly I came to your door to see that you were all right. I reckon the drink... Well, I did not intend to offend your honour, nor your good reputation.\" \"If you did not drink so much whiskey or make a habit of entering ladies' bedrooms uninvited, you would not find yourself in this low position of having to make amends for your behaviour,\" Mattie said. LaBoeuf grimaced. \"I will own that is likely true. However, that you are the first and the only lady to give me such a hard time about entering your bedroom unasked.\" \"There have been others?\" Mattie asked, trying to keep her voice down so as not to wake Rooster. \"You are incorrigible! What did they do, if they did not give you a hard time?\" \"Typically they have cried, and always they have given me the information I sought,\" he replied. \"When I made your acquaintance in Fort Smith those five years ago, I thought you would give me the easiest time of all, given your young age, and that you were sick and recently bereaved besides. Then you opened your mouth.\" \"You are a devil,\" Mattie said. \"I am shocked that the Texas Rangers encourage these kinds of investigative methods.\" \"They do not, strictly speaking. That is my own method.\" \"You ought to be strung up by your toenails, molesting innocent people in that way. What would your mother say about such behaviour?\" LaBoeuf looked surprised, and his face reddened. \"Ah. She would not condone it.\" \"Well, there you have it,\" Mattie said. They were both quiet then, staring into the hot embers of the fire. Mattie wondered at LaBoeuf and his changeableness. At times he was as well-mannered a man as Mattie had ever encountered, if somewhat pompous in his airs. Then he would turn and be bold as brass, without apology, as though he did not have to answer for his ways to any authority, earthly or otherwise. The man became more puzzling to her the more time she spent in his company. \"Your hair is all a mess again,\" LaBoeuf said, after a pause. He was examining her in the firelight. Mattie felt her face flush with embarrassment. \"I do not know what sort of manners a boy learns in Louisiana, or in Texas for that matter, but in Arkansas a decent person does not seek to mortify others at every turn.\" LaBoeuf chuckled, and Mattie's anger flamed. She was about to scold him when he spoke. \"Whether you believe it or you do not, my aim has never been to mortify you. I only wished to know whether you would like me to assist you with your hair, for I know its untidiness vexes you.\" Mattie stared at him, taken aback. Its untidiness did vex her, and it vexed her worse still to know that he could so easily take stock of her. She felt strangely exposed under his eyes. Before she could think of something to say, LaBoeuf stood and went to Mattie's pack, next to her saddle. He opened it and dug around until he found her hairbrush. He returned and sat next to her. \"Turn around,\" he said softly. Mattie turned her back to him. She felt him unfasten the bottom of her plait and begin to unravel it. They were both so silent that Mattie could hear only the low hissing of the fire, and LaBoeuf's steady breathing behind her. \"It does not bother you that Rooster will know about your talent for braiding ladies' hair?\" Mattie asked as LaBoeuf brushed the tangles from the ends of her hair. \"Rooster would not know it if Hell itself cracked open beneath him. The whiskey has put him out,\" LaBoeuf replied. He combed his fingers through her hair, brushing against the nape of her neck. Mattie shivered and pulled her legs to her chest, resting her chin on her knee. \"Anyhow,\" LaBoeuf continued, \"I do not know if this can truly be counted as a talent, for I have only practiced on two subjects in my life.\" \"I think it can be counted as a talent. You do it very well.\" \"I thank you.\" \"In any case it is preferable to your other talent, sneaking into ladies' bedrooms.\" LaBoeuf gave a quiet guffaw. \"I will quit that if it is such a burr under your saddle. I do not wish you to return to Yell County thinking ill of me.\" Mattie had no response to that, and so she gave none. An owl hooted in the woods, and she shivered. \"Your hair is a lovely thing,\" LaBoeuf said, in a voice so soft it was almost as though he spoke only to himself and not to her. Mattie's brow furrowed, and she pressed her cold nose against her wool-covered arm. Whether what he said was true or not, she did not understand why he would say such a thing. To compliment her cooking or to assist her with managing her hair, she deemed acceptable behaviour. But this comment bothered her, and she did not know how to reply. Finally, she concluded that graciousness without any invitation for further embellishment would be best. \"Thank you,\" she said. LaBoeuf ran a finger down from the crown of her head to the nape of her neck, parting her hair. Mattie shivered, and felt goose bumps break out on her arms despite her warm coat. As LaBoeuf began to wind her hair into plaits, he cleared his throat. \"I did not mean to embarrass you, there.\" \"You did not,\" she replied. \"Only I am not used to such talk.\" \"What kind of talk is that?\" he asked. To this, Mattie found she again had no reply. She shrugged her shoulders. \"Ah,\" said LaBoeuf. \"Well, if it bothers you, I will simply remain silent.\" Neither of them said anything for a moment. \"I doubt your ability to remain silent for any negligible period of time,\" Mattie said finally. LaBoeuf guffawed. \"I should take offense to your saucy words, except you are very likely right.\" Mattie hid her smile against her wool-covered arm, and said nothing more. To her surprise, they passed the rest of the evening in a silence that she could only describe as peaceful. The following morning, Mattie awoke to find herself alone next to the newly revived embers of their fire. LaBoeuf and Rooster were both gone; Mattie guessed one of them had thrown new kindling and sticks on the fire, for it was catching on. She was grateful, for the rain had stopped but it had turned cold in the night, and everything around them was covered in a thin white gauze of frost. If frost had not been such a thorn in her side when it came to raising crops up, Mattie would have found it beautiful. She sat up and squared away her bedroll after giving it a shake to remove the frost. She then grabbed the water bucket from by the fire and walked down through the trees to the bank of the little crick. Mattie picked her way down the slope, the empty bucket banging against her leg as she walked. She emerged from the trees close to the bank, and found Rooster and LaBoeuf there by the water, some twenty yards away from her. They stood facing one another, very close, and Rooster was saying something which seemed harsh, for he stuck a finger in LaBoeuf's face, and LaBoeuf was frowning fiercely at him. She thought for a moment they might come to blows, but LaBoeuf took a step back and looked down at the ground. She thought Rooster had slept through their talk by the fire. But perhaps it was not so. Perhaps he had heard them discussing his drunkenness and was angry. Mattie was briefly shamed, but still she felt that LaBoeuf had been full in the right to broach such a parley with her. Quickly she filled her bucket and carried it back up to the campfire. She made coffee and got some salt pork frying. By the time she was warming the previous night's beans and browning pieces of cornbread in the frying pan, Rooster and LaBoeuf returned from the crick. \"Good morning,\" she called from her seat on a stump. She looked anxiously at LaBoeuf, but his expression was blank and revealed nothing to her. He sat down on the opposite side of the fire and poured some coffee into his tin cup. \"Good morning to you, sis,\" replied Rooster. He sat down against a log next to her, between her and LaBoeuf. Mattie glanced at LaBoeuf through the smoke, but he seemed unwilling to meet her eyes. They ate their breakfast mostly in silence, although Rooster took to humming as they cleaned up and broke camp, scattering the ashes of the fire and tacking up the horses. Mattie noticed that Rooster did not pull out his usual bottle of whiskey, and her stomach turned. He seemed cheerful enough, but he must have heard them talking, and the thought of it made her feel guilty. She did not care for duplicity of any kind. When Rooster went down to the crick to fetch himself a canteen of water, Mattie went to LaBoeuf's side. He was tacking up Sal and securing his bedroll and saddlebags. \"What were you and Rooster discussing down by the crick bank?\" she asked. \"What do you mean?\" \"I mean that I came down to the crick to fetch water, and saw you and Rooster having a discussion which seemed unfriendly. What were you discussing?\" \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf said, frowning. He paused, scratching his chin with the tip of one thumb. \"We got caught up in swapping range tales and so forth. Very little that would be of interest to anyone not well acquainted with Texas.\" Mattie regarded him shrewdly, noting that he would not meet her eyes, continuing instead to fiddle with the leather straps on his saddle, as though they needed adjusting. \"I am not well acquainted with Texas, but I am certainly interested. What did you speak of?\" LaBoeuf stopped his hands and rested them on the saddle. He eyed her for a moment, a troubled crease between his brows. \"It was nothing of importance. I know what you are thinking. You are thinking we mean to leave you. I assure you we will not. We will all three be together when we apprehend Cunningham, so do not fret.\" \"You cannot blame me for thinking it,\" Mattie replied, pursing her lips. \"You have tried to leave me behind several times now.\" \"It is not what you are thinking, Mattie, believe me,\" LaBoeuf said, the frown on his face deepening. He was sincere in this, no sarcasm evident in his tone, but he seemed troubled. Mattie did not know what to make of it. \"Well, I suppose I believe you,\" she said. \"Surely a Texas Ranger would not plot to leave a young woman alone in these woods with few supplies and no method of finding her way home, would he? Would you?\" \"No, Mattie, I would not do that. Cogburn talks a big game, but he would not either. As I said, we will be together until this business is finished. Then we will go our separate ways.\" Mattie regarded him, and thought of what would happen at the end of this adventure, when LaBoeuf would climb on Sal and bid farewell to her with a tip of his hat and an \"adios,\" as he was fond of saying. Perhaps she would not see him again after that. It was serendipity enough for one lifetime that she had met him again after their time pursuing Tom Chaney. The thought made her sadder than she would ever have guessed. LaBoeuf tilted his head, squinting at her in the bright morning sunlight. \"That is a sombre expression, even for you. What troubles you?\" Mattie met his eyes for a brief moment, and then looked away, shrugging her shoulders. \"I was thinking that it is not likely that I will ever see my one hundred dollars in cash money again.\" \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf nodded. \"You were thinking of your money. No wonder you looked so sorrowful.\" \"Indeed,\" Mattie said. She turned away from him then, and set herself to tacking Alma up. Rooster joined them moments later, and they mounted their horses and set off to the west. Rooster did not pull his bottle out all day. Mattie searched in vain for an opportunity to speak in private once again with LaBoeuf, but no such moment presented itself that day. They rode for many more hours than was typical for them, which Mattie supposed was due to the fine weather, and to Rooster's sobriety. Rooster, meanwhile, talked endlessly about people he knew and places he'd been. At one point, he had been explaining how to distinguish counterfeit Confederate currency from the genuine article for nearly twenty minutes when Mattie caught sight of the look of distaste on LaBoeuf's face and guessed that Rooster knew about counterfeit bills because he had a hand in making them. When they finally stopped for the night in what remained of an abandoned homestead shanty, Mattie was so saddle sore and exhausted by attempting to make sense of Rooster's rambling and barely coherent tales that she did little more than eat a cold piece of cornbread and collapse on her bedroll to sleep. The next morning dawned clear and bright. Mattie left the little shanty to find Rooster and LaBoeuf smoking on its partly collapsed front porch. Rooster was looking up at the sky. \"By my money, we will have snow by nightfall,\" he said. They ate a hurried breakfast and departed once more on their southwest course. By late afternoon they had reached the easternmost bends of the Red River, where Rooster announced that he was \"wore out\" and found them a spot to camp in a clearing near the sandy bank of one of the river's oxbows. While Mattie settled the horses in and got a fire going, Rooster sat on a stump and rolled several cigarettes. LaBoeuf cut down a thin birch sapling, stripped it of its bark and branches, and cut a little notch at its tip. He produced a coil of fishing line from his saddle bags, and said that he was going down to the water and would not return until he had caught them all some supper. Mattie watched him disappear into the trees, and then glanced at Rooster. He was caught up in his occupation and did not seem to have even heard LaBoeuf speak. Mattie noticed the top of a bottle poking out of his coat pocket. She threw a large, dry branch on the fire, and followed LaBoeuf. She found him leaning against a rock in a shady spot, casting his short line out and drawing it slowly back to him through the water with his gloved hand. His hat rested on the rock behind him. It was still and lovely by the river, and if not for the bare trees, it might have been a spring day. \"How is the fishing?\" Mattie asked in a low tone, coming to a stop beside him. She did not want her voice to frighten the fish away. \"It would be better if it would cloud over, but I think it may yet. We shall see,\" he replied. Mattie leaned back against the rock next to him, watching his line pull a V through the surface of the water. It looked like a flock of geese flying north in a chevron. \"Do you like to fish?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Papa used to take us fishing on the river in summer, when the cotton was high and there was little that needed doing. I have not been since he died,\" she said. \"I reckon that farm of yours must be very handsome in summer,\" LaBoeuf said. \"It is,\" Mattie agreed. The silence that followed was only interrupted by the gentle lapping of the water before them. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, do you have faith that the wicked will be punished in the hereafter?\" \"That is an odd question to be asking,\" LaBoeuf said, frowning as he looked down at the rod in his hands. \"Yet I suppose it is a thing to ponder. Yes, I do indeed believe that the wicked will be punished in the hereafter. But I reckon we ought to be sure and punish wickedness in this life, all the same.\" Mattie felt a smile pull at the corner of her mouth as she regarded his profile. \"I agree.\" \"Would you like to fish a while?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Do not trouble yourself,\" Mattie replied, shaking her head. \"I do not know how I should do it with only one arm.\" LaBoeuf seemed to consider this a moment, and then stood up straight, shaking his head. \"Come here,\" he said. Mattie took a step closer to him, and he moved behind her and placed the rod in her right hand. Unsure how to manage it, she braced it against her hip. \"Cast out, and hold on tight to it,\" LaBoeuf said, still standing close to her. Awkwardly, Mattie hauled back and cast the short line out, the lure dropping into the water with a quiet plink. LaBoeuf reached out and grabbed the line, slowly bringing it towards them. \"There you are,\" he said. They repeated this exercise several times. LaBoeuf's assistance embarrassed her somewhat, but Mattie was so pleased to be fishing that she did not reject it. Mattie suggested letting the lure drop to the bottom of the shallows, and soon enough there was a sharp tug on the line. Before she could draw breath to say a word, LaBoeuf wrapped his arms around her and grabbed the rod and the line, helping her drag a darkly speckled, slippery channel catfish of middling size flopping onto the bank. \"Will you look at that,\" he said, crouching down. \"This fellow will be good eating.\" He pulled his knife from his boot and grabbed hold of the squirming fish, tapping it firmly at the base of its head with the wooden handle of the knife. The fish undulated twice more, and then went still. \"I did not think you would have any luck with only a birch switch and a bit of cornbread and grease.\" Mattie turned to see that Rooster had joined them on the bank, and was looking sceptically down at the fish in LaBoeuf's hands. \"I was not the one who had the luck. Mattie here caught this one,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"I think I will attempt to catch myself one as well, and then we will have a fine meal.\" \"Hm,\" Rooster said gruffly. He sounded dubious still. He lit a cigarette and tossed his match down in the sand. They watched as LaBoeuf pulled from his coat pocket another piece of cornbread and put it on the hook. He cast out once, twice, three times, and nothing happened. On the fourth try, he lost his bait and had to put another piece on. He cast out again, and as he was reeling in, his rod gave a sharp downward yank. \"Bully for you,\" Rooster said as LaBoeuf hauled a second catfish of similar size onto the bank. Mattie watched as Rooster and LaBoeuf took their knives and neatly gutted the fish, throwing the heads and innards down to the sandy crick bank, where all manner of creatures would feast on the unwanted parts. She felt useless watching them, for filleting was a task which required two hands. Finally, she turned away and started back up the bank. \"Bring me the fillets when they are ready,\" she said over her shoulder as she went. Mattie returned to the camp, where she stoked up the fire, and placed their last three potatoes in the embers to cook in their skins. She set out a pan of cornmeal to dredge the fish, and placed the spider skillet over the fire to heat. She watched as the dollop of lard she dropped in the pan slid across its black surface, leaving a greasy slick in its wake. Rooster came out of the bush, a tin plate of fillets in his hands. He passed it to her and looked around their little camp. \"We need more wood,\" he said. \"LaBoeuf is down there yet, washing the knives. Never have I met a more fastidious man. I think it is good enough to wipe the scales off on your trouser leg, but I reckon that is a place where we differ.\" \"There is nothing wrong with taking good care of your things,\" Mattie replied. \"Hmph. I will go find us enough wood for the night.\" With that, he departed. Mattie dredged the fish in cornmeal and laid them in the hot fat, which spat and sizzled noisily. As she did so, she thought about LaBoeuf down by the river's edge, painstakingly removing every scale from his knives in the growing darkness, careful not to dirty his boots or his buckskin. Mattie found herself hard pressed not to smile at the thought. The fish was ready to be turned. Without thinking, Mattie reached out and grabbed the handle of the skillet to remove it from the fire, her hand wrapping around the hot metal. Mattie yelped, immediately dropping the spider skillet. The fall jostled the pieces of fish, sending fat spitting into the hot embers, but none of it fell into the fire. Her heart pounded as the burn on her hand caught up with her initial shock, throbbing fiercely. She dug her teeth into her bottom lip to bite back the curse which threatened to give itself voice. \"What is it?\" LaBoeuf called, emerging from the trees. \"I heard you cry out.\" \"It is nothing,\" Mattie replied as he stopped before her, trying to keep the pained waver out of her voice. \"I grabbed the handle of the skillet with my bare hand, and burnt myself. It is my own fault; I was careless.\" LaBoeuf took her hand in his and turned it over, examining the angry red stripe across her palm. Wincing, he gave her a sympathetic glance, and bade her to sit down on a log by the fire. He took the empty water bucket and disappeared back into the woods, reappearing a moment later with fresh, cold crick water. \"Stick your hand in here and it will stall the burn,\" he said, setting the bucket down at her feet. He sat down beside her on the log, looking expectantly at her. Mattie did as he instructed, flinching at the sharp cold on the burn. After a moment, however, the stinging began to subside. \"I could have fetched the water myself,\" she said. \"You did not need to do that for me.\" \"I know it,\" LaBoeuf replied, pulling out his pipe and filling it with tobacco. \"Turn the fish over,\" Mattie said, nodding at the pan. \"I do not want all our catch to be burnt to a crisp on account of my carelessness.\" LaBoeuf took a fork and carefully turned the fish over, revealing a golden-brown crust of cornmeal. He sat back down beside her, and lit his pipe. He smoked in silence as she soaked her hand. When he had finished, he tapped the ashes out into the fire and put the pipe aside. He stood and walked to his pack, rummaging for a moment before returning with a handful of rags. He sat down beside her. \"May I?\" he asked, reaching for her hand. Mattie nodded, allowing him to take her hand in his. He lifted her hand from the bucket of water and dried it carefully with one of the rags. \"Here,\" he said, producing a small tin pot from his coat. He unscrewed the top, revealing a sticky greenish-brown salve. Mattie peered at it sceptically. He dabbed the salve on her burn, gently rubbing it into her tender skin. It stung for an instant, and then a cool, soothing sensation spread across the palm of her hand. LaBoeuf set aside the salve and reached for a clean rag, which he began to bind around her hand. Mattie examined the top of his head as he worked. His cowlick stuck up and waved in the breeze. \"I do not like that I cannot bandage my own hand,\" she said, after a long silence. LaBoeuf glanced up from his work and contemplated her. \"Most people would require some assistance tending an injury such as this, myself and Rooster included,\" he said. He looked back down and finished tying off the rag. \"It is nearly impossible to do every single thing on one's own. Why is it that you make such a point of never being needful?\" Mattie frowned. \"I do not behave in a particular fashion because I believe it will be vexing to you, or to anyone. I am not myself out of a sense of pride. I simply behave in the manner closest to that which is right.\" \"Grit,\" LaBoeuf intoned, a hint of gentle teasing in his voice as he regarded her, his eyes twinkling. He still held her hand cupped in his own. Mattie grew uncomfortable under his gaze and made to pull her hand away. LaBoeuf held on, lifting the hand to his mouth and dropping a kiss on her knuckles, a quick press of dry lips on her skin. \"There,\" he said. \"Now it will heal all right.\" Mattie stared at him in surprise, but did not have a chance to remonstrate him for his boldness, for Rooster emerged from the woods then, a bundle of wood for the fire in his arms. \"How's that fish coming along, there?\" Rooster asked. He dropped the wood by the fire and straightened up, looking at them both. His canny gaze landed on their still joined hands, and then came to rest on LaBoeuf's face. As Mattie looked on, some silent exchange passed between the two men, and LaBoeuf's jaw tightened, and he looked away. Mattie extracted her hand from LaBoeuf's grasp and stood. \"I burnt my hand on the skillet, and Mr. LaBoeuf was kind enough to bandage it,\" Mattie said, holding out the injured appendage for his examination. \"I will put the fish back on. Our supper will not be much longer.\" LaBoeuf stood as well. \"You should not trouble your injury. I will do it.\" \"That is not necessary. I can manage it.\" Mattie grabbed the coarse piece of sacking she had been using to move hot things and scour pots. She wrapped it around the handle of the skillet and moved it back over the flames, ignoring the answering throb of her burn as she made use of her hand. \"Mattie, you are not our housekeeper,\" LaBoeuf said quietly, almost as though he did not want Rooster to hear. \"I can cook the fish well enough if you cannot. Your hand is injured and you ought to rest it. Do not be obstinate.\" He was right, Mattie knew. They had equal parts in this venture, and she was not there simply to cook their meals. Her hand ached, and she decided that in this instance, to contradict him would serve only her pride and not the greater good. \"All right,\" she said, backing away from the fire. She sat down on a flat boulder nearby and rested her hand in her lap. Rooster, meanwhile, had sat down on the opposite side of the fire, and had his bottle of liquor out. In silence they watched LaBoeuf finish frying the fish. Mattie guessed that the fresh fish and the liquor put Rooster in a fine mood, for while they ate, he talked animatedly of the war and some of his adventures before and after. \"I rode with a fella named Avery Boyle, an Irishman from up north someplace,\" he said after they had finished their supper and the moon had risen. \"This was during the war, if I recall, as we were in Missouri at the time. We was camped near the Kansas border. Anyhow, we was stuck there for some days, and we all got to drinking. This fella, Boyle, he had a bellyful and fell into one of the fires. Drunk as we were, it took us some effort to heave him out. His face was all burnt and the whole camp stank of it, the hair and all, but he was alive. He weren't able to say much, and we sat debating what to do with him for some time. Few fellas thought it kinder to shoot him, as he was in considerable pain and we had nothing to relieve it. We had few supplies generally at that time. What was it, the winter of '63? I do not precisely recall now. Anyhow, before we could determine whether it would be best to kill him, one fella said he knew of a remedy for burns. His name was Mose Pearl, and he was from the Great Smoky Mountains or thereabouts, and it was some old Cherokee remedy. He cooked it up from roots and things, and put it all over Boyle's face, and then we had him sleep out in the woods with a bottle of corn liquor because his moaning was bothersome.\" Rooster paused here and took a deep swig of his whiskey, staring into the fire. Mattie could not tell if that was meant to be the end of his story or not, for it held no conclusion in it. Finally, she spoke. \"What happened to the Irishman with the burnt face?\" \"Well, next morning we got up and he was gone, nowhere to be found in the woods. It was a strange thing. We decided he had probably expired and a big cat or some other creature had come and got him, and we all ought to be grateful it didn't come for us or our horses.\" \"That is a terrible thing,\" Mattie said, wondering as she always did with Rooster what the purpose in the telling of this story was. \"Terrible thing, and a strange thing at that,\" Rooster continued. \"We were in a skirmish that day and lost some men and moved south. Couple nights later, Boyle comes strolling out of the woods, whistling a tune with his bedroll hung over his shoulder. Stranger yet, his face was as good as new, if a bit pale, and taught and shiny like a new apple.\" Mattie stared at him. \"You are pulling my leg,\" she said, glancing over at LaBoeuf. The other man was smoking his pipe and regarding Rooster with a sceptical expression on his face. \"I ain't pulling your leg, sis,\" Rooster replied. \"Boyle did not know where he had been or for how long, or even how he came to be with us again. We asked Pearl about it and he just scratched his beard and said he only did what his great granny used to do, and was not certain whether or not any of this had gone as it ought to have. Anyhow, didn't matter none. Boyle departed our company not long after, and I believe he died up in Virginia the next spring. Pearl stayed on until we got word that Richmond fell. When we heard, he stood and said, 'Well, boys, I reckon I better go home and see my wife,' and he walked off into the woods. Never heard nothing about him again.\" Silence fell between them. The fire popped and hissed, and an owl hooted somewhere in the woods. LaBoeuf shook his head, as though he did not think he would ever make sense of Rooster. \"I am going to turn in,\" he said, standing up to arrange his bedroll. \"Goodnight.\" \"Goodnight,\" Mattie replied. Rooster said nothing. They were quiet for several minutes after LaBoeuf got settled, turning his back on the fire. Mattie glanced over at Rooster, whose chin was drooping close to his chest. \"I am going down to the river to clean the dishes, and then I think I will also turn in,\" she said. Rooster's only response was a grunt. Mattie stood and gathered the supper dishes, and carried them down to the river in the crook of her arm. The moon was low and bright, casting enough light for her to find her way down to the water. There she kneeled in the sand and scrubbed the plates and pans while thinking about Rooster's strange story. She wondered whether LaBoeuf had wanted to needle Rooster about the unsavoury nature of his time on the Kansas border during the war. Knowing LaBoeuf, he almost certainly had. She stacked the clean plates up and smiled to herself. \"What is making you look so giddy?\" Mattie jumped up and stood at the sound of a voice right next to her. Rooster was leaning against a tree trunk with one hand, peering down at her. She had not even heard him approach. \"Do I look giddy?\" she asked. \"You do. It is a strange and unsettling thing to see such a girlish expression on that face of yours,\" he replied. Stiffly, he leaned back against the tree trunk and placed an unlit cigarette in his mouth. Mattie scowled at him. \"Whether my expressions are pleasing to your eye is no concern of mine.\" \"You got a fella back home?\" Rooster asked, rummaging about in his coat pockets, presumably on the hunt for a match. \"In spite of your tendency towards drunken stupor, I had thought you wiser than that. It should be obvious that I do not have a beau, and why.\" Rooster found a match and struck it, holding it to the end of the cigarette and observing her in the brief flame. He tossed the match aside and coughed wetly. \"I once made the acquaintance of a woman who had been born with hands which resembled crawfish claws more than they did hands. She was a fine show-woman, and had been married three or four times, if I recall.\" \"Yes, but to what sort of men, I wonder?\" \"Hmph,\" Rooster grumbled. \"I do not remember, but if you are going to be particular about it, then you have no one to blame but yourself, baby sis.\" Prickled, Mattie frowned. \"I would rather be particular than accept any old fool.\" Rooster regarded her, puffing on his cigarette. \"I did not think we were talking about any old fool.\" \"I do not know what you mean,\" Mattie replied. She looked away. \"You are a bad liar. Not enough practice,\" Rooster said, a crooked smile splitting his face. \"Anyhow, as far as old fools go, LaBoeuf is not so bad. He likes too well the sound of his own voice, and it is unnatural for a fella to be vainer than his woman, but he is braver and loyaler than most, and he is a good shot. Perhaps you ought to encourage him before his head is turned by another.\" Mattie gaped at him, astounded and mortified. She would not give him the satisfaction of acknowledging his preposterous comments. \"I see you have a 'brick in your hat' and will not talk sense until you are sober. If you are ever sober. Goodnight.\" \"It is when I am on a spree that I talk the most sense, but you tell yourself whatever you like, girl.\" Mattie picked up the stack of clean dishes and awkwardly tucked them in her arm. She turned and walked back up the riverbank to their campfire, silently cursing Rooster the whole time. He had most widows beat as far as the enterprise of busybodying went. She approached the welcoming circle of light thrown by their fire. She set the dishes down, and looked at LaBoeuf's shadowed form on the far side of the fire. He was dead asleep and snoring. If Rooster thought that she was silly enough to make a fool of herself by giving LaBoeuf any kind of \"encouragement\" whatsoever, his brain was more softened by whiskey than she had previously feared. As she put the dishes away and lay down in her own bed roll, a light snow began to fall from the dark night sky.[Chapter 8] Thank you, thank you, thank you for all the wonderful, encouraging comments. To know that there are people out there enjoying this story makes the writing of it that much more fun for me. This chapter is a long one, and a lot goes on in it, so I hope you like it. :) Naturally, Rooster's bout of temperance did not last. Mattie and LaBoeuf agreed to tolerate him and carry on as they had done, sharing the duties of making and breaking camp between themselves. Rooster did not seem to notice that he contributed little more than stories as they made their way toward Texarkana. Even his provisions were of no help to them – he had only tobacco and spirits, and a little bag of salt that he guarded jealously and said was \"for trading only.\" He typically rode in front, drinking and singing and telling his stories. He did not care whether Mattie or LaBoeuf paid him any mind. As it was, they listened to him about half the time. The other half they hung back and rode in silence, or else talked of where they thought Cunningham might be. They neared Texarkana on the fifth afternoon after their departure from the Cunninghams' in Arkadelphia. The country became less wild and more settled as they rode west towards the Arkansas portion of Texarkana. The land was well cultivated and flat, as though someone had pressed it with a great iron. It was a cool, grey day, and the wind chapped their hands and faces. \"Have you ever been to Texarkana?\" Mattie asked LaBoeuf. They were once again riding together behind Rooster, who was about thirty yards ahead of them. Mattie eyed him dubiously as he reeled in his saddle. Whiskey Jack took a few steps off course, wary of his rider. \"I have,\" LaBoeuf replied, \"many times. It is an interesting place, filled with travellers and business-minded folks, owing I suppose to its location and the confluence of railroads there. It is not a place I would choose to settle and raise a family, however.\" Mattie considered this, and it led her thoughts to LaBoeuf's earlier admission that he would one day soon like to \"settle down,\" as he said, and have a wife and some children. \"Do you have a sweetheart back home in Texas?\" Mattie asked. LaBoeuf looked at her sharply, and Mattie raised her eyebrows in what she hoped was an expression of idle curiosity. \"Ah. No, I do not have a sweetheart in Texas,\" he replied. \"Or anywhere, for that matter.\" \"You said that you hoped to one day settle, and have a house and a wife, which is why I ask,\" Mattie elaborated. LaBoeuf regarded her, and then cleared his throat. \"I reckon if I want that for myself, I had better start the search for a good companion.\" \"I would not know anything about that, but I am sure you are right.\" \"You would not? Here I thought the business of courting and marriage was the primary domain of all respectable young ladies.\" \"Some respectable young ladies, perhaps,\" Mattie said. \"So you do not count yourself among their ranks?\" \"I do not concern myself with things which are irrelevant to me,\" Mattie replied. \"I doubt I shall ever marry.\" LaBoeuf seemed to have no response to this, and all was quiet between them for some time. Mattie thought the subject abandoned, but suddenly he spoke again. \"Perhaps you have not yet encountered the man who would make a suitable mate for you.\" \"I do not think that is the trouble,\" Mattie replied. \"What then do you think is the trouble?\" \"The trouble is that I have long held the opinion that men will live like billy goats if they are permitted,\" Mattie said. \"If a woman wants to take it upon herself to marry a fellow and keep him from living in a low and slovenly way, then that is her business. As for myself, I am not interested in that occupation.\" \"That is an unsentimental view of the thing,\" LaBoeuf said. \"What if you made the acquaintance of a man who was not a 'billy goat' in need of a shepherdess, but was a decent and respectable man who wished to marry you out of a fondness for your company?\" \"This hypothetical scenario of yours is very interesting,\" Mattie replied, \"but it is rather like asking how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. I am sure you find it great fun to ponder, but it has precious little practical value.\" \"You mean to say you do not think such a man exists?\" \"It is arrogant to say as much, for I do not know all there is to know, but I have seen just enough of this world that no, I do not think such a man exists,\" Mattie said. LaBoeuf regarded her in silence for several moments before looking away. \"Well, then,\" he said, in a voice so low Mattie almost did not hear him. Mattie turned her gaze straight ahead, and frowned to see that Rooster had stopped and was waiting for them. They rode up to him and stopped their horses. Mattie dropped her reins almost to their ends and sat her weight up in the saddle so that Alma could stretch her back. The horse reached her nose down to the ground and gave a soft nickering sound before letting out a heavy sigh. \"We are nearly at our destination,\" Rooster said. He gestured to the west, and Mattie could see the gathering of dark smoke in the distant sky, indicating the town beneath it. \"What say you, LaBoeuf? Will we find our man in a tavern or a brothel? It is early yet, but perhaps the whores in Texarkana keep store hours.\" \" Cogburn ,\" LaBoeuf said, frowning at him. \"I realise this sort of talk is more for the benefit of my offence than Miss Ross's, here, but you ought to mind what you say in the presence of a young woman.\" \"Some of the foulest mouths I've known have belonged to young women,\" Rooster replied. \"I have no doubt that is true,\" LaBoeuf sighed. \"Let us proceed. We will enter the first tavern we find and start our search there. We will be able to cover some ground before we need to find lodging for the night.\" They chirruped to their horses and set off once more. In an hour, they had arrived in the outskirts of Texarkana. They stopped once they were in the centre of the town, nearly at the Texas state line. By the train tracks they found a livery, and decided to board the horses and let them rest a spell. \"This task will go faster if we split up,\" LaBoeuf said once they had seen the horses settled. \"Hm,\" said Rooster. \"I suppose you mean for me to take one side of the street and you and the girl to take the other.\" \"That is what I was going to suggest, yes,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Miss Ross and I can try what hotels and boarding houses we come across, and you can try the taverns and other such places.\" \"That is what you were going to suggest,\" Rooster repeated. He coughed and spat on the ground, and then continued speaking in a peevish tone. \"I am not sure she will be any safer alone with you than she would be following me into rough places, but I guess that is how you figure it, LaBoeuf.\" LaBoeuf said nothing to this, but glared fiercely at Rooster. Mattie looked between the two of them, puzzled as to the source of their vexation, beyond their continued general dislike of one another. \"I am gravelled,\" she said. \"It does not matter who goes with whom so long as we find our way back together here, in an hour or thereabouts, hopefully with some good information regarding Cunningham. Let us not cavil – we are only wasting time.\" \"I agree. I reckon you can judge well enough your own path. Go with whomever you choose,\" LaBoeuf said to her. He turned then and began to walk away up the street. Rooster watched him go, a scowl on his face. He glanced at Mattie. \"You heard the man, sis. Do as you like,\" he said. He turned and went also, only in the opposite direction. Mattie stood there in the muddy livery yard, watching the two of them stalk off. Her thought was that she would like to have but one day on this errand wherein her two companions did not chafe one another. She watched Rooster walk down a ways, and then cross the street to a tavern which stood on the other side. He went inside. She turned her back on him and walked in the direction LaBoeuf had gone. It took her only a minute of brisk walking to catch up to LaBoeuf down the street, outside of a hotel. He was standing on the front stoop, an expression of frustration on his face. \"Hallo,\" Mattie greeted him as she approached. LaBoeuf looked up, and seemed surprised to see her. She came to a stop before him. \"What is your plan, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"Well,\" he said, \"I propose we query the hotels along this row and see what we can find. Failing that I suggest we make contact with the local law and see whether they have heard aught of our man.\" \"I agree,\" Mattie replied. \"Marshall Cogburn has gone to 'query' a tavern down the other end of this street, so I do not know when we will see him sober next.\" LaBoeuf's brows drew together in a frown as he regarded her. \"Are you making sport of Cogburn?\" \"Only somewhat,\" Mattie replied with a shrug of her shoulders. \"For the most part I think I speak the truth. Shall we begin?\" \"Yes, let us go.\" They continued down the street, stopping at two more hotels and a dry goods store. They discovered nothing, and were treated warily by the people they met. Mattie supposed it was due to LaBoeuf's high-handed ways and the unusual dress they both wore, but that was no excuse for poor manners, in her opinion. As they were leaving the second hotel, two men entered the lobby, talking loudly and blustering about as though the place belonged to them alone. \"- no surprise in that,\" one of them was saying. \"These western towns are scarcely more civilized than the territories.\" \"They will not even catch the man who done it, I warrant,\" replied the other. \"Of course they will not! He has fled and is likely already over the state line. No one will give chase.\" LaBoeuf gave Mattie a weighty look, and then stepped forward and stopped the men. \"Pardon me, sirs, but what is this that you speak of?\" The men both stared at LaBoeuf a moment before transferring their baffled looks to Mattie. \"Why, there has been a murder, of course,\" the first one said after a moment, in a pompous tone. \"You have not heard?\" the other added, incredulous. \"Where has this murder taken place?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"Quickly, now – I am a Texas Ranger in pursuit of a dangerous criminal and cannot afford to waste time on palaver.\" The first man blanched. \"The thing happened at a hotel very near to here, on Beech Street. I will give you directions.\" The two men proceeded to detail a series of directions wherein they contradicted one another repeatedly and fell to quarrelling over it more than once. Mattie did not see how it could be so difficult to find a place in a frontier town with broad, western-style streets laid out in an orderly way, and so she simply listened for the street names and ignored the rest of their nonsense. Mattie and LaBoeuf left as soon as they could break away from the two men, and headed back in the direction they had come. Sure enough they found their own way without any trouble, and when they turned the corner onto Beech Street, the large crowd gathered in front of a rundown boarding house was enough to indicate that they had arrived in the right place. They approached the crowd, which was populated with people of all sorts, hoping, Mattie supposed, to get a glimpse of whatever grisly scene lay within the boarding house. LaBoeuf craned to see over the heads of the people before them, and then turned to her. \"The law is here already. I will see if I can be of any assistance,\" he said, and disappeared into the crowd. Mattie turned away. She walked down the board sidewalk, out of the crush of onlookers. Admittedly she was curious, but the local authorities hardly needed yet another person gawking and getting underfoot. She sat down on an empty upturned crate around the side of the building where there was no one, and waited. Mattie considered the trail of mayhem the man had left behind him as he fled west. Things had gone in such a way thus far that she assumed Cunningham was responsible for whatever violence had transpired here. She wished that she had had the wherewithal to take her father's pistol and finish the job of killing him when the opportunity had presented itself back in Yell County. Cunningham's subsequent crimes would have been prevented, and Mattie would now be at home with her family, enjoying the hard work and plenty of the harvest season. Her only regret in such a circumstance would be not having had these times with LaBoeuf and with Rooster which, although each man was tiresome in his own way, had yielded a kind of high-spirited adventure she had not enjoyed since the last time they were together, and which, in private moments, she could admit to herself that she coveted. Mattie reckoned it was a sin to call running away from home in the pursuit of a criminal a high-spirited adventure, but that was the truth. She missed her home and her family, but sleeping under the stars, riding and tracking, camping, and fishing all agreed very well with her. Even Rooster's meandering stories and LaBoeuf's tall ones held their own peculiar charms. She guessed their adventure was almost at its conclusion. They had nearly caught up to Cunningham now, and soon she would be headed back home. She supposed it would be best to put herself and Alma on a train; certainly LaBoeuf and Rooster would be eager to head back to Texas for their respective rewards. They would not be willing or able to accompany her home. \"There you are.\" Mattie looked up to see LaBoeuf standing at the corner of the building, watching her. \"I am not one for a large crowd,\" Mattie said. \"I thought I would do myself and everyone else a good turn by waiting here, out of the way.\" LaBoeuf came and sat down on the crate beside her, the big rowels on his spurs ringing against the sidewalk boards. He removed his hat and ran a hand over his hair before replacing the ostentatious thing on his head. Mattie glanced down and saw that his knee was touching hers. She eased her limb away from his and placed her hand in her lap. \"Were you able to gather any useful information?\" \"A woman was killed here, only an hour or so ago,\" LaBoeuf said, frowning. He was troubled. \"No one knows the name of the man who was with her and who later quit this place, but judging by the descriptions given by those who saw him, I reckon we have caught up to Cunningham at last.\" \"A woman? What woman?\" \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf said hesitantly, glancing at her. \"Well... She was a lady of the evening.\" \"Oh,\" Mattie replied. \"What happened?\" LaBoeuf's cheeks reddened, and he cleared his throat. \"Cunningham was ah, keeping company with this lady, and the Sheriff reckons they quarrelled about some matter, and Cunningham strangled her and pushed her body under the bed before fleeing. He stole a horse also, and it is believed he headed west into Texas.\" Mattie frowned down at the toes of her boots, silently remonstrating herself for her earlier musings. \"High-spirited adventures\" indeed. \"What, have you nothing to say about this being the just punishment for her sins?\" LaBoeuf asked. Mattie looked at him. \"Surely you cannot think me so heartless as all that.\" LaBoeuf regarded her for a long moment, and then shook his head. \"No, I do not think you so heartless as all that.\" \"Perhaps this woman lived a life of sin, but to have it taken in violence by a man like Cunningham is hardly 'an eye for an eye,'\" Mattie said. \"I agree.\" LaBoeuf was silent for a moment, and then said quietly, \"I do not think she had the opportunity to do much sinning at all. She was very young.\" Mattie had nothing to say to this, and they sat listening to the sound of the crowd murmuring and gossiping around the corner. Mattie thought about all the harm Cunningham had done during his flight from justice. \"More with each day that passes I regret that I did not kill him when the opportunity presented itself,\" she said finally. \"Do you?\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Well, I regret that I did not catch him before he got anywhere near you.\" Mattie turned to him. He was looking at her with great sincerity; there was no bluster about him at that moment. But he appeared deflated somehow, older and more tired than usual, frustrated with something over which he held no sway. \"We ought to go find Rooster,\" Mattie said. LaBoeuf sighed. \"Yes, we ought to. There is no use in sitting here. If we are quick, I think we can catch Cunningham before he gets too far into the wilderness.\" \"Let us go then.\" They walked back to the livery, where they found Alma and Sal contentedly eating their hay in two stalls next to each other. Whiskey Jack was in a third, dozing with his great chestnut head hung low. LaBoeuf went into Sal's stall, running his hand along her dark brown and white rump and her side so she would not startle. He checked her hooves, and then stood and gave her a pat on her neck. \"I am glad we can pursue Cunningham immediately upon Cogburn's return, but I own that I would have liked for the horses to have a proper rest. Poor gal. I am wearing her ragged, I fear,\" he said, almost to himself. \"Yet she would keep on until she could go no further, if you asked it of her,\" Mattie replied, standing by the pine post at the entrance to the stall. \"That is a good horse to have.\" \"She is a fine mare, sound and steady, and she has seen me through our share of scrapes withal,\" he said. \"Perhaps it is about time for her to retire from this game of tracking criminals in the wilderness.\" He paused, his hand resting on Sal's neck. \"Perhaps it is about time I did the same.\" \"But Mr. LaBoeuf, you cannot possibly think to quit our search now!\" Mattie exclaimed. \"We have come so far, and we are right on Cunningham's heels, I am sure of it!\" LaBoeuf came and stood beside her. \"Come now, I have no plans to abandon our work and leave you in Texarkana with only Cogburn to assist you. I am speaking of my future life when I return to Ysleta. I am getting too old for this life, and I do not wish to have what time is left to me cut short by a bullet, either.\" \"You speak as though you are an old man, which is hardly the truth,\" Mattie replied, perplexed by him. \"And I have not known you to shy away from danger. Indeed you have sought it out.\" \"I have,\" LaBoeuf agreed, his brows drawing together in a crease. \"Since running away to join up in the war I have wanted only to be where the fire is hottest, so to speak. I hardly knew then what that truly meant. But now I find I grow weary of the violence. I long for some peace, a place of my own. Do you understand that?\" Mattie was struck with an image of the lovely September afternoon when Cunningham came into her life. She thought of the freshly harvested cotton fields, of the hay in the mow, of the horses and the little milk cow Jessie in the pasture. She thought of how pleased she had been at the good season they had enjoyed, and how she looked forward to seeing Mama, Little Frank, and Victoria, of meeting them at the train station and hearing about what fun they had had in Little Rock, of delighting in what gifts they brought her no matter how many times she insisted they not waste their pennies. \"I understand,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf looked at her, and his eyes spoke of peace and of quiet, of soft green places and the warmth of sunlight. All words died in her throat. Mattie wondered how he might look without all his gaudy trappings, in a parlour at dusk after a long day of work, his eyes warm and tired, and his hand on hers. \"I reckon you know there has been a murder, or you are more incompetent as a lawman than I have guessed, LaBoeuf.\" Mattie turned to see Rooster standing in the wide stable doorway, silhouetted by the late afternoon sunlight. \"Yes, we know there has been a murder, and we suspect Cunningham is to blame,\" LaBoeuf replied tiredly. \"What else do you have to say about it?\" \"I have nothing else to say about it,\" Rooster said. \"I only wonder what you are doing jawing Mattie's ear when we are nearly at the pinch of the game. I plan to pursue Cunningham even if you do not.\" \"I plan to pursue him, all right.\" LaBoeuf reached for his saddle on the wall between Sal's stall and Alma's. Mattie went into Alma's stall and began to tack her up as well. \"There is no need to be acrimonious, Marshall Cogburn,\" Mattie scolded as she worked. \"Mr. LaBoeuf and I were just making ready to depart. We planned to pursue Cunningham the moment you returned, did we not, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" LaBoeuf did not reply. Mattie could see only the very top of his downturned head as he fastened Sal's girth. \"It seems our man was sighted heading west out of town,\" Rooster said. \"I guess he aims to go to the woods for cover, and we had best start there and see if we can pick up his trail.\" \"That is all right with me,\" LaBoeuf grumbled. \"Let us be off as quickly as we can and get this business over with.\" They mounted up and started off towards the west once again, and Mattie felt that they were completely at the mercy of providence, for they had little to guide their course now. Once they had crossed the state line and the streets and buildings of Texarkana thinned and receded into the distance, Mattie paused to take a look around at the \"great state of Texas.\" In the strictest geographical sense, there was not much to distinguish it from Arkansas, as far as Mattie could see. Whether the people were any different, it was not yet possible to say, for they did not encounter anyone as they traversed a stretch of plains, heading for a thick stand of piney woods crouching on the horizon. The sun crept across the sky, headed in the same direction as their path took them. The sky cast over with snowy-looking, low grey clouds, and they rode in a single line with Rooster in front, then LaBoeuf, and Mattie in the rear. The wind sharpened, and they did not speak. It was twilight by the time they reached the edge of the woods. A glow of light and the smell of smoke on the wind announced the presence of some living being, and by and by they came upon a tiny log cabin with a thatched roof. A man sat smoking a pipe on the little stoop, with was made of a smooth split log. He wore a threadbare coat whose sleeves were too short for his lanky arms, and a tall hat made from dusty, moth-eaten beaver felt. They brought their horses to a halt in what passed for his yard. The man leaned against the door behind him, and although he regarded them, he did not stand or offer a greeting. \"What say there?\" Rooster called. \"You see a man pass through here, recent-like, on a horse? He woulda been in a mighty big hurry.\" The man did not answer immediately. Instead he continued to stare at them, and to smoke. Mattie glanced to her side to see what LaBoeuf thought of this, but his eyes were fixed on the man. \"Might have,\" he said finally. Rooster waited for the man to continue, but he did not. Rooster cleared his throat. \"Which way was he headed?\" \"Can't say,\" the man replied. Mattie looked over and saw that Rooster had gone very still. \"Now, can you not say because you do not know, or because this man has paid for your silence?\" Mattie heard LaBoeuf's saddle creak as he turned to look at Rooster. Hardly a sound broke the silence. \"Well?\" Rooster prodded, his voice patient and untroubled. \"Which is it?\" There was another beat of silence, and then the man was on his feet and turning to scurry into his cabin. But Rooster moved with a speed which took Mattie aback, and thumped to the forest floor and grabbed the man by the back of his coat before he could escape. Rooster threw the man to the ground, face up, and pinned him there with one foot planted squarely on his chest. His Colt Single Action was in his hand before Mattie had seen him reach for it. He cocked the piece and pointed it in the man's face. \"You're at a fork in the road, friend,\" Rooster said. \"You got yourself two paths to choose from: you get right with me, or you get right with your Lord. Which is it gonna be?\" The man was either obstinately foolish or stunned into silence, for he did not answer. Rooster leaned over and pressed the muzzle of his revolver into the flesh of the man's cheek. The fellow squirmed and wheezed, clutching at Rooster's leg. Abruptly, Rooster eased off of him and the man rolled over, coughing. He hissed something at Rooster, who leaned down again. \"What's that?\" he barked. The man choked out some words which were indistinguishable from where Mattie and LaBoeuf sat. Rooster cursed and kicked the man sharply in the ribs in reply. \"Marshall Cogburn!\" Mattie protested, as the man cried out. It did not seem right to torment the wretch with violence, in spite of their aim. The man said something finally which seemed to satisfy Rooster, who spat on the ground and holstered his revolver. He returned to Whiskey Jack's side and mounted in one smooth motion. \"Cunningham asked for directions, and this fella told him to head southwest, through these woods, where he will eventually find a lake,\" Rooster said. He urged his horse on, and Mattie and LaBoeuf followed. Mattie pulled up alongside him. \"What did the man say to incite you to treat him so viciously?\" she asked. \"Said he'd tell me all I wanted to know if I beat Cunningham's price,\" Rooster replied. \"Don't know what cards he thought he was holding. I knew he would start barking once I put an ounce of pressure on him.\" Mattie turned to look at LaBoeuf, who had remained silent throughout this entire exchange. His face bore an unreadable expression, and Mattie turned back around in her saddle. They rode through the woods, putting distance between themselves and the log cabin. The darkness was becoming impenetrable as the forest grew denser and the night more absolute. They did not speak as they rode abreast, picking their way slowly through the maze of slender pine trunks. Mattie did not like this dark feeling which had descended on the three of them. As if to underscore her anxiety, an owl hooted nearby. The next time LaBoeuf wound through a stand of trees and was close to her side, Mattie cleared her throat and undertook a bright tone. \"If this is a taste of what I might expect in Texas, I believe I have a greater understanding of how you came to be the sort of man you are,\" she said. \"Oh, indeed? And what sort of man am I?\" LaBoeuf asked. Mattie swallowed, her teasing mood abandoning her as quickly as it had taken hold of her. She spoke before she could think better of it. \"The best sort,\" she said. She looked away, feeling strangely bashful, and glad that darkness surrounded them. \"Do not take offence. I am only 'yanking your chain' because you are so easily affronted.\" LaBoeuf did not seem to have a reply to this, and did not have time to think of one, for Sal stumbled then, nearly unseating him. He cursed, and dismounted to see whether she had been injured. Mattie and Rooster stopped, waiting as LaBoeuf bent down to examine the horse's legs. \"She is not lame,\" he announced eventually, standing up. It was too dark to even make out his face, and Mattie had to guess where he stood by the sound of his voice, which held a great deal of frustration. \"It is too dark to press on. I do not like it any more than you will, Cogburn, but I suggest we stop and make camp here.\" \"Hm,\" Rooster replied. \"No, I do not like it, but you are right, pard. We are more likely to hobble our horses in these woods than to find Cunningham.\" Mattie's heart sunk in disappointment, but she saw the reason in it. It would do them no good in their endeavour if they found themselves without horses, especially now that Cunningham was mounted. They found a small clearing in the trees nearby, just large enough to build a campfire and throw down their bedrolls, and to string a line for the horses. As Rooster and LaBoeuf got the horses settled, Mattie walked off between the trees to gather firewood. She did not take a light of any kind with her, for she guessed it would be easier going to simply allow her eyes to adjust to what little light there was from the moon. She did not walk far, only deep enough to gather an armful of sticks, and never so far that she could not hear the sound of Rooster and LaBoeuf speaking to one another in low voices. It was so dark, and had become so still in the woods, that she could see the glow of Rooster's cigarette when she turned to look back at them. Mattie tripped on something, a root she thought, and half fell to her knees, dropping the sticks all around her. \"Blast,\" she cursed, groping in the darkness. Slowly she began to gather up her sticks once again. She had recovered about half of them when she reached her hand and touched something that caused her to draw back. Her fingers had touched something wet and warm which stuck to her skin. She put her hand under her nose and sniffed. It was blood. \"Mattie?\" It was LaBoeuf, and he was close. \"I am here,\" she said, struggling to keep her voice even as she rose to her feet. \"Bring a light, there is something -\" \"Hell,\" he swore, appearing beside her with a lit knot of pine in his hand. He held it out, and the light revealed the body of a horse. Mattie held her hand up – it was slick with dark, congealing blood. The light moved away from her as LaBoeuf leaned over to examine the animal more closely. \"The animal has been shot,\" he said. \"I reckon it is the horse Cunningham stole, for it is only just dead. Perhaps it went lame. Or perhaps he simply shot it for no reason. I do not know.\" The sight was grisly indeed. Mattie turned her face away. The poor dumb beast had done nothing to deserve such an ugly fate, to die frightened and injured away from all that was familiar to it. The sight of the pitiful creature reminded her too much of Little Blackie, only it was much worse. This horse had not been shot out of compassion for its suffering and sacrifice. It had probably not been shot for any merciful reason at all. LaBoeuf sighed. \"Come away,\" he said, placing a hand on her shoulder. \"We can do nothing for the poor beast now.\" Mattie gathered the bundle of sticks close to her chest and they returned to the place where the horses were tethered. Rooster had cleared a spot for the fire, and was waiting there, smoking a cigarette. \"Mattie stumbled upon Cunningham's horse,\" LaBoeuf said to him. \"It seems he shot the animal for one reason or another. Either way it is recently dead. He cannot have gotten far, although he will have had a better time on foot than on horseback in these dense woods.\" \"If only we did not have to wait here for the night to pass,\" Mattie said. \"We cannot apprehend Cunningham soon enough for me.\" \"Cool your heels, sis,\" Rooster replied. \"We'll get him yet.\" \"You ought not to encourage her,\" LaBoeuf muttered. \"Encourage me?\" Mattie asked, turning to stare at him. His expression was dark, and he seemed vexed beyond the merits of their circumstances. She did not understand him. \"Yes, encourage you, that is what I said,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Neither of us ought to. We are both fools. Mattie, you should not be here. It is too dangerous.\" \"Too dangerous? Why, I have come this far all right, have I not? Not to mention our previous sojourn.\" \"You paid dearly enough for that one act of vengeance,\" LaBoeuf countered. \"Why do you take on another?\" \"This is not an act of vengeance. I simply want my one hundred dollars back,\" Mattie replied. \"I think we both know that is not the whole truth of it. You told me yourself that you doubt you shall see that money again. No, you want to see Cunningham dead for what he did to you. Not for the danger he poses to others, not for your one hundred dollars. For what he did to you.\" Mattie met his gaze. \"And if I do?\" \"I fear your desire for vengeance makes you foolhardy,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"And it does not have the same effect on you?\" \"I have no desire for vengeance. Mattie, this is merely a duty of my occupation. I am pursuing Cunningham because if I am successful, there is money in it for me. That is all.\" He paused then and looked to Rooster with an entreating expression. \"Do you have nothing to say, Cogburn? Do not pretend you think she ought to be here, with a man like Cunningham on the loose.\" \"You are the one who brought her along, pard,\" Rooster replied. LaBoeuf shot Rooster a thoroughly exasperated look. Rooster returned it. He threw his cigarette to the ground and cleared his throat. \"Reckon I might go see a man about a horse,\" he said. \"You two holler when you're through with your squabbling.\" With that, he turned and ambled off into the woods and out of sight but not, Mattie supposed, out of earshot. LaBoeuf turned back to her, his expression sombre. \"Please, Mattie. See reason. We are well past the point of ridiculousness. It is not safe for you, here.\" \"I do not see why this continues to be a sticking point between us,\" Mattie replied. \"I am here and I am staying. You swore to me that we would be together when we bring this business to its close. Is there no honour in your word at all, then?\" \"There is honour in my word, all right. Only my honour is not anywhere near so dear to me as your safety. I fear...\" He paused here and frowned, looking away from her. \"I fear that something will befall you, and there will be nothing Rooster or I can do to protect you.\" \"You are the one who is being ridiculous,\" Mattie replied. \"I am as safe as I have always been.\" \"What, do you think you are safe from violence because you are virtuous, and that only those like that girl in Texarkana are in harm's way?\" Mattie glowered at him. \"You forget how I came to be involved in this business. I know full well that one has little to do with the other, and what danger I face in pursuing the man.\" \"I am not sure that you do, Mattie. I think if you knew what danger you faced, you would be at home, where you ought to be.\" \"It is not for you to say where I ought to be,\" she replied. \"This time, it is. This is enough, now. It is enough. We are returning to Texarkana and you are boarding the next train back to Dardanelle.\" \"What, turn back now when we are right on Cunningham's heels? You will do no such thing!\" Mattie snapped. \"You cannot always have your way,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Nor can you,\" she returned. \"You have had your way plenty on this journey, and now I must put my foot down and refuse you. Do not be unreasonable, Mattie. You have had your adventure. Now you must listen to good counsel and do as I say.\" \"It is not your place to refuse or forbid me anything!\" Mattie replied, needled. \"Why are you forever trying to soldier me here and there, protect me from this and that? I do not need your protection.\" \"But you should want it! You should want to be protected,\" he said fiercely. \"It is unnatural that you do not want it.\" \"Unnatural? Unnatural indeed! How dare you?\" \"By God, Mattie, I tell you I have had enough!\" LaBoeuf said, glowering down at her. \"If you do not return to Texarkana and put yourself on the next train to Dardanelle, I will have no choice but to put you there myself by any means necessary. Do not try my patience further, girl.\" \"You are very free with your threatening remarks for someone who so rarely sees them through,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf scowled at her. \"I see them through. Or is your memory so short that you have forgotten the striping I gave your leg on the bank of the Arkansas River, in the Choctaw Nation?\" That he had the audacity to bring that mortifying episode up at this moment, Mattie could scarcely believe. His pride was unforgivable. He did not care what humiliation he wrought so long as he defended his ill-founded belief that he was always in the right. \"You are a rude, awful lout, and I have no regard for you,\" Mattie said. \"And I think it is you who suffers from a short memory. You gave me a thrashing, but you never did manage to steal a kiss from me. You never shall, either. You could not steal a kiss from a corpse, or a toad on a log. You could not steal a kiss if they were being given away, free of charge!\" LaBoeuf continued to glare at her for a moment longer, and then suddenly he moved and Mattie found herself pulled roughly to him. He kissed her right on the mouth, his whiskers scratching her skin. Stunned, she froze in place as he wrapped his arms tightly around her, holding her close to his body and bending her to him. He released her as abruptly as he had pulled her to him, and Mattie swayed back on her feet. His eyes were bright as he looked at her, that smug expression returning to his face. Mattie felt her face burn, feeling that she had been bested. \"There,\" he said. \"Now what do you have to say about how I see my threats through?\" Stung, Mattie reached out her hand and slapped him across his face. It throbbed sharply where her burned palm connected with his jaw. She could not think of a thing to say, and she had no desire to look at him a moment longer, and so she turned on her heel and stomped into the bush, heedless of the darkness. LaBoeuf did not follow her. Mattie's face blazed with humiliation, and anger choked at her chest. The very tar of him, to treat her that way after everything that had passed between them! She did not know why she was so shocked at his behaviour; after all, he had done little since their meeting except doubt her abilities and try to rid himself of her. Her steps slowed as she ducked around the fallen trunk of a tree. Some sharp sensation tugged in her chest as she thought of LaBoeuf's eagerness to be shot of her. It was not only her pride which was hurting, she realised. She stopped walking. She was being silly, tearing off into the woods to sulk like a child. This sort of behaviour was well beneath her, and it would not do. She would simply return to their little camp and behave as though no quarrel had taken place. There was nothing for it. A shriek suddenly pierced the air, so high in pitch that it alarmed the ears to hear it. It continued, rising and falling through the trees like the screech of some unholy banshee. Mattie shuddered as a chill ran up her spine. It was the scream of a rabbit caught in the clutches of some other beast. She could not tell which direction the horrible noises came from. It ceased as abruptly as it had begun, and the woods fell silent. Pulling her coat tighter around her, Mattie turned and began to walk in the direction she had come. She walked for quite some time, her legs growing tired as she picked her way through the dark brush. Eventually she saw a firelight glimmering through the trees. She walked towards it, nearly stumbling over the uneven ground. She came through the trees, expecting to see LaBoeuf and Rooster, but she did not. Instead, sitting by his meagre fire, slowly pulling a dead rabbit's pelt from its body, was Albert Cunningham.[Chapter 9] I have agonized over this chapter for weeks, and enough is enough. I hope it's okay. Thanks to ishieputting up with all my handwringing, and to allgreycats for the cheerleading. I stole a line from Ruby Thewes of the Civil War film Cold Mountain (which, if you are enjoying this fic, may I heartily recommend the novel by Charles Frazier?) and put it in the mouth of Rooster Cogburn. Ruby Thewes is what would happen if Rooster and Mattie procreated and their daughter was allowed to raise herself in the hills of Appalachia. Picture it. Anyway, it's the line about \"sweethearts\" - you'll know it when you get to it - and I understand it's a take on a regionalism that Rooster may have been familiar with, so it seemed fitting. Warning: This chapter contains quite a lot of graphic violence, as well as sexual violence much like what was in the prologue of this story. If you have any triggers with respect to such topics, please use your discretion when reading. Thanks. Mattie froze in place, stunned. She had been so occupied with losing her temper that she had not given a thought to the danger of wandering the woods where they knew Cunningham to be hiding. And now here he was, at last, right in front of her. Cunningham looked up from his work and clapped eyes on her, and Mattie knew it was too late to flee back into the woods. \"Who are you?\" he asked, slowly rising to his feet. There were tufts of bloody rabbit fur on his hands and the sleeves of his shabby coat, and in one hand he clutched a hunting knife. His face was thinner than when last she saw him, and the clothes he wore hung loosely on his bony frame. His shirt was unbuttoned at the throat, and there Mattie could see he wore a grimy neckerchief which was stained brown with old blood. His skin was sallow, and dark circles rimmed his blue eyes. Altogether, he did not look well. \"My name is Mattie Ross,\" she replied. He stared blankly at her; he did not seem to recognize her at all. \"What are you doing here?\" he asked. Mattie swallowed. Her first thought was to tell him exactly who she was and what she was doing here, but she was unarmed. She glanced at the knife in his hand, and then back up at his face. \"I am on a coon hunt in these woods, and I have become separated from my party and am lost,\" Mattie replied. \"Coon hunt?\" Cunningham repeated, frowning. \"Then your dogs will find you.\" \"We have no dogs. It is only myself and my party.\" \"That is strange, hunting coon with no dogs,\" Cunningham said. He waved his knife vaguely in her direction. \"I have little in the way of supplies, here, so do not ask me for food.\" He sat down heavily on the log behind him, and continued with his work – removing the rabbit's pelt. Mattie stared at him. She wanted to explain to him the rudeness of having nothing whatsoever to offer a guest, but she did not. The knife, and the blood on his hands, hands which had already nearly throttled her to death, stopped her from speaking. She felt the urge to put her hand to her throat, although the bruises had finally disappeared. Instead she made a fist, the burn across her palm stinging as she did so. Cunningham removed the rest of the rabbit's pelt, and went about preparing it for a makeshift spit he had spanned over the flames. He paused and looked up at her. She had not moved. \"You need not stand there like a scarecrow,\" Cunningham said. \"Sit down by the fire.\" Mattie stepped forward and sat on a low stump across from him. The fire was meagre, but it provided light and warmth enough to pierce the dark night around them. Mattie looked up at Cunningham. He secured the rabbit on the spit, and then stood, seeming to search for something. \"Do you see a bottle lying about?\" he asked, peering down at the ground around him. \"I suppose you mean a bottle of liquor,\" Mattie replied. \"I do. It was prescribed to me by a bona fide medical doctor,\" he said earnestly. Mattie did not reply to this. Instead she watched as he moved away from the fire, kicking at the carpet of leaves and sticks on the forest floor, muttering to himself. Her mind raced as she kept her eyes trained on Cunningham. She had stormed away from LaBoeuf and Rooster in a temper, but surely they would expect her return, would they not? When she did not come back in short order, certainly they would search for her. Apprehension settled coldly in her stomach, and she fought against the feeling of panic which loomed over her. Certainly they would search for her. Cunningham had become a mere moving shadow in the gloom beyond the light of the fire, the only signifier of his presence the sound of his footsteps in the underbrush. Mattie glanced down at the fire then, and saw his bloodied knife resting against a rock. She did not dare hesitate. Before Cunningham could spy her, she reached over and snatched up the knife, sliding it gingerly into her sleeve. Cunningham did not even seem to notice, so occupied was he with locating his bottle of moonshine. Mattie's heart pounded in her chest. Surely he would notice his knife had disappeared. The moment he returned to the fire, he would know. What would she do then, if he pounced on her? She swallowed. Cunningham meandered back to the fire, a sour expression on his face. He gave the log a kick before sitting down again. He scratched fitfully at the stubble on his face, and looked up at her. His brows drew together in a glower which he slowly lifted to direct at her. Mattie met his eyes, holding tight to the last of her nerve. He stood again, and came around the fire, stopping at her side. He stared down at her for a moment longer, and then he bent over. He was so close to her she could smelly the filthy, stale liquor smell of him. She held her breath and began to slide the knife from her sleeve. But Cunningham straightened before she could move. He brought his hand up, and in it was a half-empty bottle of liquor. He shook it, sloshing the murky contents about. \"It was right there next to you, in the leaves. You ought to have said something,\" he said. He returned to his seat on the far side of the fire. Mattie found she did not have the breath to say a single word. Instead she continued to watch him while trying to slow her racing heart. Cunningham took a healthy swig from the bottle. When he finished, he swiped his arm over his face, wiping his mouth on his dirty coat sleeve. He eyed her for a moment, and then his brow creased as his gaze dropped to her short arm. He fixed on it, a strange expression crossing his face. He raised his eyes to meet hers, and Mattie shivered to see the dark look there. \"How did you get like that?\" he asked. It was the same question he had asked her before, when they first met. Mattie's eyes searched his face for some hint of his intentions. She still could not tell if he recognized her or not. When she did not immediately answer, he frowned at her. \"I want to know how you came to lose that arm,\" he said, more insistently. Mattie's eyes narrowed. \"I do not see what business my arm is of yours,\" she replied. He smiled, but it did not reach his eyes. \"I do not see why you should be so shy. I am only curious.\" \"If you are only curious, then you will not mind it if I tell you nothing of how I came to lose my arm, and if I also say that asking such questions is impertinent indeed.\" \"You are a wrathy thing,\" Cunningham observed. His tone of voice was calm, but there was something strange and eager in his look that Mattie did not like. \"Shame no one ever took the tar out of you, proper like. Your pa should have. You might have been a sweet, meek little cherry, then.\" Mattie sneered at him, repulsed. \"Someone ought to have taken the tar out of you . Then perhaps you might not have fallen to a life of wickedness.\" Cunningham did not respond. He stared at her, his eyes searching her face. Suddenly he smiled, and exhaled an odd kind of laugh. Mattie could see in his smile that he might have been handsome, if not for the awful rest of him. \"A life of wickedness?\" he asked. \"What makes you think I live a life of wickedness?\" Mattie paused a moment, sensing her mistake. She raised her eyebrows in what she hoped was an honest look. \"When I said that yours was a life of wickedness, I was referring to your drinking.\" \"You are a teetotaller,\" Cunningham said, and then fell silent, distracted by adjusting the rabbit over the flames. What little fat there was in the skimpy creature dripped off and sizzled in the fire. The sight of it did not whet Mattie's appetite. If anything, it turned her stomach. \"I am very hungry and do not wish to share this,\" he said then, sitting back on his log. \"I have not eaten in some days, for I have no money.\" Mattie thought of the young woman back in Texarkana. It seemed he had enough money for that . Or perhaps he did not, and that was why they had fallen to quarrelling. Cunningham looked up at her. \"That is a sour expression you have. You ought not to scowl at people so. One day some person may take offense to your sauce.\" Mattie thought of LaBoeuf and felt her heart sink. Whether he and Rooster were troubling themselves to search for her did not matter. Cunningham could turn on her at any moment and kill her, long before they arrived. He seemed docile enough now, but she did not trust it, and she supposed herself to be next to useless at placating him. \"The face God gave me is the one I must live with, as must everyone else,\" Mattie replied. \"You still have not told me about your arm. Were you born with that deformity?\" \"I lost my arm when I was fourteen years old,\" she said, fed up with his rude questions. \"I shot the man who killed my father in Fort Smith, and the Sharps-Carbine I used kicked me back into a pit, where I was bitten by a rattlesnake. The wound festered and the arm had to be removed. Does that satisfy your curiosity, which you ought to know is indecent and impertinent?\" \"Your father is dead?\" he asked. \"Yes, he is.\" Cunningham went quite still, staring down into the fire with a frown on his face. He lifted his eyes to look at her. \"And are you from these parts here?\" \"I am,\" she lied. \"I live outside Texarkana.\" \"What was your father doing in Fort Smith?\" \"He would go there sometimes for trade,\" she replied. \"That is a peculiar place to go for trade when you are already near Texarkana,\" Cunningham observed. \"My father was a peculiar man,\" Mattie said simply. Cunningham stared at her for several more moments, seeming to give great consideration to her words. Finally he looked away, grabbing a stick to poke the embers of the fire. \"You may pass the night here if you like. It will be easier for you to find your way back to your party in the daylight,\" Cunningham said. Mattie considered the options before her as she watched Cunningham through the smoke. Rooster and LaBoeuf may well be searching for her, she thought, but it was dark and she did not know how far she had wandered. It could take hours to pick up her trail if they started off in the wrong direction. With only a hunting knife at her disposal, she did not think herself capable of disarming him. She could get up and leave, she supposed, but she did not know where she was, and what was much worse, she would be letting Cunningham escape. She did not care to stay in his company, but she did not know what else to do. She would have to \"sit tight\" and await the moment when she might take his gun and overpower him that way. That was the only sensible course of action. Neither of them spoke any as Cunningham tended the fire and cooked his supper. When the rabbit was cooked, he ate it right off the spit. He ate ravenously, as though he had not eaten in weeks, and soon his food was all but gone and his face and hands were a greasy mess. He held the spit out to her. \"You may have what's left, if you like,\" he said. Mattie eyed the carcass. He had picked the bones clean and there was hardly anything left to have. \"I am not hungry,\" she replied. \"You suit yourself.\" Cunningham stood then, and tossed the leavings of his supper off into the woods. Mattie frowned. The man obviously knew little about how to manage a proper camp. He was liable to attract wolves and bears and every manner of troublesome wild creature that way. Cunningham then settled down with his head leaning back against a log, and his bottle of spirits clutched in the crook of his elbow. He closed his eyes and did not speak, but he did not sleep either, for he took regular swigs from the bottle. Mattie sighed, and propped her shoulders against the log behind her, her feet towards the fire. She wrapped herself more snugly in her coat, shivering against the cold. The fire provided precious little warmth, but she was unwilling to get up and fetch more wood. She would simply have to suffer it until Cunningham fell asleep and she could take his gun. \"You are too old to be out on coon hunts. You ought to be at home,\" Cunningham said eventually, without opening his eyes. \"What I ought to be doing is no business of yours,\" Mattie replied. \"You would not be in this unhappy situation, lost as you are, if you had stayed home where you belong.\" Mattie said nothing, although she could not help but agree with the basic truth of what he said. Cunningham fell silent, and Mattie awaited the sound of his snores, or some other sign that he was asleep. As she waited, she turned her predicament over once again in her mind. She could not help but think of what LaBoeuf had said, about what price she might have to pay for her vengeance. It would be something; that much was certain. But what would it be? She thought of the farm, of the winter garden and the cold weather crops. She thought of Mama, Little Frank, and Victoria. She thought of Rooster. She thought of LaBoeuf. What would God take from her, if she took Cunningham's life? What toll would there be for this errand, undertaken to retrieve her one hundred dollars, yes, but also to avenge the trespassing of her land, and the wounding of her body, her dignity? Mattie closed her eyes against the ugly visions that troubled her. There was nothing for it now. She was too far from home to entertain such fears. If she had to defend herself against Cunningham, she would do so by any means necessary. And if God would take something from her in kind, then that was His will. She was as subject to it as any other creature. But if anything happened to those people and places she held dear, she knew it would be on her head until Judgment Day. It was cold, and the ground hard, and Mattie longed for her bedroll and the large fire Rooster always insisted upon. She longed also for the silent comfort of the nearness of her friends. With that thought she must have fallen asleep, for it was the last thing she remembered when she stirred sometime later. She was confused for a moment before she recalled where she was. She blinked blearily to adjust her eyes to the deep blue pre-dawn light, and jolted when she realised Cunningham was kneeling right next to her. His hand came down and clamped firmly on her throat, as if he had been waiting for the precise moment she awoke. Grimly, she realised he probably had. \"I see now,\" he said in a low voice. \"I see what you are and why you have come. You think you can get at me, make me turn myself over to the law.\" Mattie's thought was that taking him alive was about the last thing she wanted right now, but she held her peace. \"You are not lost,\" he continued. \"You are not on a coon hunt at all. You are here to bedevil me.\" \"I do not know what you are talking about,\" Mattie replied hoarsely. \"I am here for the reasons I told you, and I have nothing to do with the law.\" \"You are nothing but a foolish girl,\" he continued. \"Do you not know your scripture? God gave iman/i dominion over all living things. That includes women.\" \"I suppose that is how some might interpret that passage,\" Mattie replied. \"That is the only way to interpret that passage,\" he said, shaking his head. It was difficult to see his expression in the dimness; he was a dark outline against the trees and the sky. \"I find I am tired, very tired indeed of this business. I would shoot you dead, for that would be hardly any trouble at all, except that I do not have much shot to waste. I could leave your body to rot in these woods and no one would find you for weeks.\" The dying fire hissed and popped, and Mattie felt smoke in the back of her throat. She swallowed dryly against the pressure of his hand. \"You think I do not know who you are?\" he asked, easing one knee between hers and kneeling there, pinning her in place. \"I know I am being pursued, and I know you are the one who follows me. I remember you. I remember it all. I guess you thought I was a fool, but I'm no fool. You are the homely cotton farming girl from Arkansas. You are the one who tried to cut my throat. You do not think I would forget such a thing as that, do you?\" He squeezed her throat then, and Mattie squirmed as the edges of her vision turned black. He released his grip just as suddenly, and Mattie coughed and gasped for air. Without removing his hand, Cunningham moved again, digging a sharp kneecap into the flesh of her thigh. Mattie winced and squirmed, but it was impossible to move. \"Did you think you would catch me?\" he asked, his voice hushed. \"You are not the first. I have been hounded by others, but none has caught me. I have dug too many graves to be caught by a one-armed harridan who don't know her place.\" He pulled at her coat, yanking the buttons free. Mattie's thoughts raced, terrified, but she tried to keep a rein on it. If she panicked, she would be lost. \"You may scream and cry if you like,\" he said congenially. \"There is no one around to hear you.\" Mattie nearly told him that a former Federal Marshall and a Texas Ranger were in fact around to hear her, but she stopped herself. There was no wind; the woods were utterly still. Even if they were far away and not searching for her, it was possible they would still hear her if she was loud enough. Mattie had never been one to scream or cry when she was small. Victoria had been much better at it, and had often, due to Little Frank's torturous ministrations, been able to produce a sound from her little body that rivalled passing locomotives. As Cunningham continued to pull ineptly at her clothes, Mattie took as deep a breath as she could, and forced a sound that matched Victoria's best efforts. She carried on shouting and crying out and making as much noise as possible for several moments, until Cunningham abruptly drew back and hit her across the cheekbone with his closed fist. \"Enough of that,\" he hissed, as Mattie reeled from the harsh blow. He hit her again, and bright spots of colour mixed with patches of blackness swirled behind her eyelids as she closed them, trying to make the world stop spinning. The crack must have gotten her nose as well, for she felt blood slide down and pool at the back of her throat. She coughed, and turned her head to spit the blood out. \"Now see what you have done,\" Cunningham said. He allowed her a moment, and then shifted his weight so he was lying on top of her, holding her down by the shoulder of her short arm. He paused and stared down at her, and she stared back up at him. She flexed the fingers of her hand, and felt the dirty steel blade of his knife under her wrist. Just tell me when, Lord, she thought. Present me with a moment and I will do what I must. \"I suppose you want a kiss first,\" Cunningham said. He tilted his head curiously at her. \"Sometimes they are easier if I do that, although I do not like it myself.\" Revolted, Mattie did not reply. Crushing the breath out of her with his whole weight, he put his face near hers. The reek of spirits was putrid, and Mattie knew that although his strength was greater than hers, his intoxication gave her an advantage. Seizing her opportunity, she eased the knife out of her sleeve and, gripping it as firmly as she could in her shaking hand, stabbed it into him at the first point she found, right between his ribs. Cunningham jerked and cried out, and Mattie pulled the knife back, feeling hot blood spill over her hand. In confusion, Cunningham reeled back and, kneeling over her, hit her again. But Mattie was ready and she rolled with the force of it, knocking Cunningham off of her. She hopped to her feet, backing away from him and holding the knife out in front of her. \"What is this now?\" he moaned, clutching his side and rolling in the leaves. \"Why would you do me such harm? Where did you find this weapon?\" \"It is your own knife,\" Mattie replied, her voice wavering harshly as her heart pounded. \"I took it off you hours ago, and you would have noticed had you not been so fixated on finding your bottle of spirits!\" Cunningham struggled to his knees, still holding his side. His hands were covered in blood. \"Damn you. I should have strangled you while you slept.\" \"Yes, you should have, but you did not,\" Mattie replied. Cunningham moaned in pain, sitting back on his heels. He coughed, making a wet, rattling sound, and spat a mouthful of blood on the ground. \"You put a hole in my goddamn lung,\" he groaned. Mattie did not reply, instead casting her eyes about for his gun. She had not yet seen it, but she knew he must have one. He had shot that poor horse with it, and he had mentioned having one, besides. Cunningham was crouching in the dirt and muttering to himself. Mattie could not hear much of what he was saying and it seemed to be nonsense, but then he raised his voice. \"Ma always said if I had to do it I ought to go for weak ones, but here you are, standing over me. How can this be?\" Mattie stared at him, her mouth agape. \"I knew your mother was helping you to evade capture, but I never -\" \"Quiet!\" Cunningham barked, pointing a bloodied finger at her. \"Don't you say a word about my ma!\" \"You think that you killed because your victims were weak?\" Mattie asked. He only strangled out a cough in reply. \"You have it backwards! You killed because iyou/i are weak in character, and ugly inside, and because you are greedy. They died because they were unfortunate enough to make your acquaintance. I have escaped you twice because you are so foolish that you cannot stay sober long enough to kill me properly!\" \"Damn you,\" he mumbled, slowly getting to his feet. His knees shook as he did so, but he managed to stand. Mattie gripped the knife tighter. \"If you take but one step closer to me, I will see that this time I cut your throat much deeper,\" Mattie said. Cunningham ignored her warning, lurching towards her. Mattie stood her ground, holding the knife out before her. He clutched his bleeding side with one hand and made to grab her with the other. She jerked her hand, catching the sleeve of his forearm, and took a large step away from him. \"Damn the day I ever set foot in Arkansas!\" he hissed. He bent over a moment, holding his forearm with his bloodied hand. When he straightened, Mattie could see that the whole side of his shirt was stained dark with blood. She took another large step back, still holding her knife up. \"I warned you once and I will not warn you again,\" Mattie said. \"Where are you hiding your gun?\" Before Cunningham could say a word, there was a snapping sound from in the woods, as though someone had stepped on a dry branch. Mattie and Cunningham both went still. \"Who is that, there?\" Cunningham said, peering off into the trees. His voice carried through the still dawn, echoing. There was a pause, and then the sound of a voice nearby. \"I am a Texas Ranger, and if your name is Cunningham, I have come to apprehend you and take you back to Texarkana.\" Mattie could not help herself – her heart jumped in her chest and tears of relief sprang to her eyes. \"Best to give yourself up, son. We got you surrounded, and can shoot from cover.\" It was a second voice, Rooster Cogburn's, from another direction. \"If you release that young woman there unharmed, it will go all the better for you,\" called LaBoeuf. \"I am here!\" Mattie called. \"It is our man, Cunningham, and he has a gun although I do not know where it is!\" Cunningham lunged towards her, and Mattie held up her knife. \"I said I will cut your throat if you come near me,\" she said firmly. The man held up his bloodied hands in a placating motion, and backed away a step, stumbling as he did so. His expression took on a look of despair, and suddenly he reached behind him into the waist of his trousers and produced a pistol. He pointed it at her for a moment, and then pulled the trigger. Mattie yelped in surprise and ducked, but the bullet went astray, to the side of her head someplace. Cunningham turned and fired two shots off into the woods in the direction from which LaBoeuf's voice had come. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mattie cried, her eyes searching the woods for any sign of him. There was another shot, and she felt the hot spray of blood hit the side of her face, followed by the sound of a heavy collapsing thump on the forest floor. Mattie spun about to look. There, sprawled on the ground but two feet from her, was Cunningham. Cautiously, Mattie took a step closer and peered at him. A circle of blood was spreading into the dirt all around his head, and his pistol was still clutched in his hand. The man had shot himself. Mattie barely had a moment to comprehend the horrible sight before someone called her name and she felt hands on her shoulders, turning her about. Stunned, she found herself looking up into LaBoeuf's worried face. \"You are not injured? He did not harm you? Thank the Lord,\" LaBoeuf said, his fingers digging urgently into her shoulders. Mattie attempted to form a reply, but LaBoeuf pulled her into his chest, holding her tightly to him. Mattie froze in the band of his arms, her face pressed into his shoulder, unable to move. After a moment, LaBoeuf's hold loosened and he pulled back to look at her. One hand came up and brushed her hair from her face, and he had the strangest look in his eyes as he regarded her. \"If anything had happened to you, I do not know -\" \"LaBoeuf! Where the hell are you, you shitpoke? You were supposed to send the signal!\" It was Rooster, his voice echoing out from somewhere nearby. \"Ah, yes,\" LaBoeuf said, abruptly letting Mattie go and lifting his revolver to look at it. \"I did neglect to send the signal. We are here, Cogburn! Mattie is fine.\" LaBoeuf replaced his revolver in its holster, and turned to regard her once more. \"I am sorry I did not follow you. It is unforgivable that I let you go off into the woods, alone and unprotected. Even worse that I was so foolish as to attempt to force you from this place. I ought to have known... I am responsible for what has happened to you.\" \"I do not see how that is so,\" Mattie replied. \"Your decision not to follow me had no bearing on my stumbling upon Cunningham. That was providence of a kind, I suppose.\" LaBoeuf's eyes searched her face. \"Ever stoic and impassive, even standing here, battered once again, this villain's blood on your skin. Do you not know fear? When it became clear that you were not coming back to me, I knew it. I knew fear.\" Mattie gaped at him, rendered speechless by the distress in his voice. Her mouth gone dry, she swallowed. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I -\" Rooster emerged from the woods then, coming from a different direction than LaBoeuf had, and he groaned an inarticulate sound of complaint. \"Never had you pegged for a poet, LaBoeuf,\" he said, chuckling to himself as though he had made a very funny joke. \"Never had you pegged for one to be taken in by poetry, neither, sis.\" \"I have not been 'taken in,'\" Mattie replied, embarrassed. She stood apart from LaBoeuf, swaying slightly on her feet. \"Cogburn, you could sooner catch a weasel asleep than see Mattie Ross 'taken in' by any man,\" LaBoeuf interjected, sounding perturbed. \"Hmph,\" said Rooster. He wandered over to Cunningham's side and looked down at the still body. \"You ever want to get three feet up a bull's ass, just you listen to the things sweethearts say to one another.\" \"Sweethearts?\" Mattie repeated. \"Sweethearts, indeed!\" She glanced at LaBoeuf, and noticed for the first time that the upper arm of his coat was torn and bloodied. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" she cried. \"You are shot!\" \"What? Oh, so I am,\" he replied distractedly, glancing down at himself. \"I suspect one of these days I will injure that arm beyond repair.\" Rooster came to stand beside them, one of his pistols in his hand. He cocked his head and peered at Mattie. He let out a low whistle. \"Looks like he got you good. That face of yours is going to be black and blue, make no mistake.\" Mattie sighed, and turned to meet LaBoeuf's eyes, which were trained once more on her face. The fear had gone from his expression, and he was looking at her with something like admiration. \"How did you fight him off?\" he asked. \"I took his knife hours ago and hid it in my sleeve. He did not notice. He woke me some time ago with what I suppose were wicked intentions, and when he had me pinned, I stuck the knife between his ribs,\" she explained. Her head throbbed, and for the first time she became properly aware of the new bruises and aches on her body. \"You are a good man to have in a tight spot,\" Rooster said, smiling wryly. LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"I will fetch Alma. She is most anxious to see that you are all right.\" With that, he turned and walked off into the bush. \"Have a seat there, little sis,\" Rooster said, pointing at one of the stumps near the fire. Mattie did so without complaint, for she was exhausted and unsteady on her feet. She watched as Rooster returned to Cunningham's body and bent down to examine him. He removed the pistol from the dead man's hand. Mattie turned away. \"When we figured you weren't returning to the camp last night,\" Rooster said, \"we set about looking for you. Couldn't find no trace in the darkness. It's plum good luck that we heard your yelping some time ago and followed the sound of it here.\" \"I hoped you would hear me, or else I would not have given him the satisfaction,\" Mattie replied, casting a disgruntled look at Cunningham's corpse. \"As it is, I feel very foolish now for having run off in such a fashion.\" \"Worked out in the end,\" Rooster said. \"You flushed Cunningham out, even if you did not mean to. Anyhow, it's done and there's nothing else for it. If it helps you, the whole affair had him in quite a state.\" Rooster jerked his chin in the direction LaBoeuf had gone, and then turned back to looking through Cunningham's pockets. Mattie frowned. That did not help her at all. LaBoeuf emerged from the woods a few minutes later, leading the three horses behind him. The two men then stood discussing how best to get them and their new \"cargo\" back to Texarkana. Mattie sat in stunned silence, almost as though she could not hear a word they said. Some strange feeling had come over her, and she became aware that she wanted nothing more in the world at that moment than to see her mother. \"Mattie?\" She looked up to see her two companions standing before her, watching her with similar expressions of concern on their faces. With some amusement she realised that she had gotten her wish – they were getting along all right, at least for the moment. \"Here, little sis,\" Rooster said, taking a bottle of liquor from his coat pocket. He held it out to her. \"You've had yourself a powerful scare, now. A swig of this will put you back on your feet.\" LaBoeuf threw Rooster an exasperated sort of glance, and then looked back at her. \"We know how you feel about it, but I do not believe anyone would think ill of you if your nerves have been rattled. Under these circumstances I think you could consider it a medical application of spirits.\" Mattie took a deep breath and stood, shaking her head in refusal. \"My nerves can take a bit of rattling. Shall we depart?\" LaBoeuf nodded, and helped her onto Alma without another word about it. Mattie did not reject the help; she was too tired to bother with it. She looked down at him as he tightened Alma's girth and adjusted the stirrups. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked. He paused his work and looked up at her, his hand resting on her knee. \"Yes?\" \"Cunningham took his own life.\" \"He did,\" LaBoeuf agreed. \"And I am alive.\" \"You are.\" \"What do you think I will have to give up for this? Do you think it will be something so dear as before? Dearer, perhaps?\" LaBoeuf looked at her, a furrow in his brow. He did not seem to know what to say to her. Finally, he cleared his throat. \"Mattie, it is not always... That is, did Cunningham hit you with anything harder than his fist? It is not like you to ask me these kinds of questions. Rather I am used to having them answered by you, whether anyone has asked them, or not.\" He was making fun of a kind, she supposed, but she did not feel compelled to laugh. She continued to look at him, and he frowned. \"We had better get you back into town,\" he said. He must have realised then where his hand rested, for he abruptly removed it and, giving the straps on the saddle a final tug, turned away. Mattie watched as LaBoeuf and Rooster tied Cunningham's body to Sal's back. The horse laid her ears back and showed the whites of her eyes. She tossed her head and LaBoeuf spoke softly to her, petting her forelock. Eventually the only way Sal would walk on was with LaBoeuf's spare shirt tied over her eyes. Rooster led the way out of the forest, back the way they had come, and Mattie rode at LaBoeuf's side as he walked next to Sal. They did not talk much at all on the way back, exhausted as they were to find themselves at their journey's end. They rode into Texarkana in the blue light of dawn.[Chapter 10] Thanks for all the enthusiastic reviews on the last chapter! Y'all are the absolute BEST, I'm convinced. I'm very glad you enjoyed the exciting climax of the manhunt, and I hope that the next couple of twists and turns are up to snuff, too. Enjoy! The people of Texarkana were still asleep when they rode into the outskirts of the town. Mattie was glad, for it meant there were fewer folks around to gawk at them. She owned that they made for a strange sight – two haggard men and an injured young woman, plus the bloodied body of a fugitive slung over the back of a horse besides – but truly there was no excuse for losing your grip on your manners. They found a boarding house with vacant rooms, and as Rooster was the only uninjured member of their party, he left Mattie and LaBoeuf there to secure lodging while he took Cunningham's body to the Sheriff. The lady of the house, a married woman by the name of McNabb, received them with some wariness, but ultimately took the money LaBoeuf offered her, and led them up the stairs to their rooms. Their rooms were all together on the second storey, and Mrs. McNabb left Mattie and LaBoeuf in the hallway, muttering something about tending the breakfast before hastily disappearing down the stairs. \"You are certain you do not need the doctor?\" LaBoeuf asked as they stood in the dim corridor. He and Rooster had both suggested that they find a physician for her when they arrived in town, but she did not care for the idea, and had thus far resisted their entreaties. \"No, I do not need the doctor,\" Mattie replied. \"In any case, you are the one who has been shot. Look at the state of your arm! We ought to call the doctor for that.\" \"I have had worse wounds,\" LaBoeuf said. \"You are silly not to have a doctor examine you, but if you insist on being stubborn, will you at least let me tend to it? If it heals poorly and festers, I will feel responsible.\" \"I do not think it is so bad as all that,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"You cannot know that until we get a look at it. You allowed me to bandage that shoulder wound Cogburn dealt you in the Winding Stairs, all those years ago. This is not so different.\" \"All right,\" LaBoeuf acquiesced. His tiredness was visible, and he seemed unwilling to argue further. He unlocked the door to his room and entered. He went to the little table under the window, and gingerly began to remove his coat. Mattie was tempted to help him, but she thought better of it, for it might be too much for his pride, and she was determined to bandage his wound at the very least. While LaBoeuf struggled out of his coat, Mattie took the chipped china pitcher from the washstand and went downstairs to the large kitchen at the back of the house, where she found the reservoir in the stove full of hot water. She filled the pitcher and carried it carefully against her chest up the narrow back staircase to LaBoeuf's room. She set it down on the hallway floor to open the door, and stopped short at the sight of LaBoeuf standing in the morning sunlight, his shirt unbuttoned and half off, his injured arm and most of his upper body exposed. Mattie cleared her throat, and LaBoeuf turned around to meet her eyes. She did not know what thoughts her expression reflected, but his face reddened, and he turned away, sitting down in one of the straight back wooden chairs. Mattie picked up the pitcher and closed the door behind her, walking across the room to pour fresh water into the tin basin on the table next to him. She pulled the other chair close to his, and sat down. LaBoeuf had managed to peel his torn shirt away from the wound, but some threads remained stuck to the blood. The bullet had torn through his buckskin coat and his shirt, grazing the skin. A long, shallow cut crossed his upper arm, wide enough that Mattie did not suppose there was much purpose in stitching it together to knit the pulpy wound. Better to let it scab over. In any case, it would certainly scar. Mattie dampened a cloth and squeezed the excess water from it. She pressed it gently to the wound to loosen the bits of thread which remained, caught as the cut began to scab over. LaBoeuf let out a low hiss from between his teeth. Mattie continued to hold the cloth down, examining his frowning profile. \"It is not so bad,\" she said. \"It will heal fine. I think it will leave quite a scar, however.\" \"As I said, I have had worse, and scars are no matter to me,\" he replied. Mattie's eyes dropped to his bare chest. In the flesh of his shoulder was a round, brownish pink scar, which she guessed was from Rooster's errant rifle shot five years previous. The skin of his chest and shoulders was scattered here and there with small pale freckles, and dusted with light auburn hair which caught the bright sunlight streaming in through the window. His skin was considerably darker on his neck and his forearms, from the days spent on horseback in what she imagined was the unforgiving Texas sun. Sitting so close to him, she was aware of how dirty her clothes and her face must be, not to mention the fresh bruises on her. She felt a prickle of awareness and looked up to see LaBoeuf watching her, a queer expression on his face. Tiny motes of dust swayed in the shaft of morning sunlight beyond his head. Mattie felt her face flame, and she looked back down, removing the cloth from his wound and rinsing it in the water. As gently as she could, she began to pick out the stubborn little threads stuck in the cut. \"We ought to get you some iodine,\" Mattie said. She cleared her throat; her voice sounded strangely dry. \"No iodine,\" LaBoeuf grimaced. \"I reckon you take real pleasure in tormenting me, woman.\" \"I do no such thing,\" she replied, finding herself somewhat offended at the thought. She did what was necessary; her intention was not to be cruel or malicious, and she certainly took no enjoyment in the notion of dabbing his wounds with that stinging stuff. \"I will have to take you at your word, for your actions say otherwise,\" LaBoeuf said. Annoyed, Mattie glanced up to find that he was smiling at her. It was not his usual smug grin, but rather a real smile which spoke of fondness and good humour, tinged as it was with his current discomfort. Mattie pulled the last of the threads from his cut before pressing the cloth once more to his wound as fresh blood seeped from it. LaBoeuf looked down at his hands, which rested in his lap. \"I ought to apologise to you for what happened between us last night. My behaviour towards you was brutish and wrong. I allowed my temper to get the better of me,\" LaBoeuf said. He frowned. \"I reckon you know better than most how guilty I am of that fault.\" Mattie looked at his profile, and thought of how angry she had been, and how upon slapping him, the burn across her palm had ached. \"I am scarcely any better,\" she replied softly. \"I am quick to anger over most things. At times I have wished that I were more peaceable and docile, like my mother. I do not know where my temper came from, for my father was always good-humoured like her.\" LaBoeuf reached up and placed his hand over hers where it was still pressed against his upper arm. \"Please do not wish yourself any different than you are,\" he said. Mattie looked way, embarrassed. LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"An explanation for my behaviour is owed to you.\" Mattie opened her mouth to tell him it was not necessary, but he interrupted her. \"Please,\" he entreated. \"Let me speak. Truthfully I never doubted your abilities – you have proven your capability many times over, too many times for me to hesitate in trusting you for even a moment. That was not the trouble. The trouble was that I was acquainted with Cunningham's history, and it caused me to fear for you. He is a drunkard and a thief and a murderer, yes, but he is also... That is, I knew what sort of victims he tended towards, and what unspeakable things he had done to them. I wanted your company, but the idea of exposing you to such danger – I felt I was being selfish in allowing you to come along in the first place. At times I would convince myself that my worry was for naught, only for us to stumble across the grisly remains of his violence again and again. When I thought of what he would do to you if I was not vigilant, if I could not... Mattie, he nearly killed you once. I could not stand the thought of it. Do you see?\" Their eyes met, and Mattie found that she could not say what she typically would have said, which was that she could look after herself and that his worries were foolish. She supposed they were not foolish. She was as capable as anyone, and Cunningham had nearly killed her. Had his errant bullets been luckier for him, he might have killed LaBoeuf, and Rooster as well. \"I do see,\" she replied softly. LaBoeuf opened his mouth, about to say something more, when there was a knock on the door. It opened before either of them could answer, and Rooster appeared in the doorway. \"Hm,\" Rooster said, casting a shrewd eye over them both. \"Do we know yet whether he will live, or must we begin making arrangements for a funeral?\" \"He will live,\" Mattie replied. \"It is a minor wound and Mr. LaBoeuf has survived much more dire injuries in the past, as you well know.\" \"What did the Sheriff have to say?\" LaBoeuf asked. Rooster came around and sat down on the end of the brass bed. He took out his pouch of tobacco and his papers, and began to roll himself a cigarette. \"Well,\" he said, \"the Sheriff reckons we got the man what killed that whore in town, and that he's the same fella who's wanted in every county from here to Tennessee, and all over Texas besides. He granted me this in spite of the mess Cunningham made of his face when he dispatched himself. He tells me he'll vouch for all this to our jurisdictions. We'll have to send some telegrams and the like to sort it all out, but it shouldn't be much trouble to collect on our rewards.\" \"That is some good news,\" Mattie said, awkwardly trying to tie a bandage around LaBoeuf's arm with her one hand. LaBoeuf lifted his other hand and held the bandage in place so she could fasten it. \"I see you managed to get us some rooms,\" Rooster said. \"Your room is across the hall, next to Mattie's,\" LaBoeuf said. Mattie patted his arm to indicate that she was finished, and with a nod of thanks he slowly began pulling his shirt back on. \"Good,\" Rooster replied, giving LaBoeuf an arch look. \"I propose that we get some rest, and send our telegrams this afternoon,\" LaBoeuf said, ignoring him. \"Perhaps you can send one to your mother, Mattie, letting her know that you are all right. Once we get the matter of the reward settled, we can all be on our respective ways.\" Of course they would be parting very soon. Mattie found she did not like to think of it. She suddenly felt exhausted. She did not even care to take a meal; she wanted nothing more than to bathe and scrub off the dirty, itchy sensation which plagued her, and to climb into a clean, warm bed. \"I think I will go get that rest now,\" Mattie announced, standing up. Without waiting for a reply, she left LaBoeuf's room and went to her own, grabbing her saddlebag from where it had been abandoned in the hallway. After locking the door behind her, she stripped off her filthy clothes and filled the basin in her room with clean, cold water. It was no hot bath, but it would have to do for now. After washing the dirt and dried blood from herself as best she could, she changed into her nightgown and drew the curtains at the window. Mattie climbed into the narrow brass bed, and fell immediately to sleep. When she slept, she did not dream. Mattie slept very late that day, much later than she had planned. The moment she opened her eyes and saw her little room flooded with afternoon sunshine in spite of the drawn curtains, she knew she had slept too long. The only time she had ever slept so long was when she was laid up after having her arm cut off in Fort Smith. It surprised her, then, that she was not well-rested. She stood at the washstand and stared sluggishly into the chipped mirror, her head swimming. She rubbed at her eyes and splashed her face with the cold water, hoping it would enliven her. She shook her head. Such were the profits of indolence! Mattie wore her calico dress, as she would not need to ride that day, and because all of her other clothes, including her coat, were dirty and bloodied. When she went downstairs, she located Mrs. McNabb in the kitchen and inquired as to whether she might have her things cleaned. The woman asked about the circumstances that had brought Mattie to Texarkana in the company of two lawmen, and Mattie recounted the woman with the shortest and least sensational version of the tale she could manage. Mrs. McNabb seemed to soften towards her then. \"I was not sure what sort of folks you were at first, the state you were in,\" the lady explained. \"But now I see that you are good, upstanding people and we all ought to be thankful you caught that man and were not killed yourselves. You must miss your home and your mama terribly.\" \"I do. I am sure I have worried her terribly and I look forward to returning home,\" Mattie replied. \"Bless you. I have a grown daughter myself, and she lives far away. I miss her,\" Mrs. McNabb said with a sigh. \"I will wash and press your things for you, dear. There will be no charge for that.\" \"That is not necessary,\" Mattie said, shaking her head. \"I can pay you what you usually charge for these services.\" \"It is my pleasure, dear. I will collect your things from your room,\" Mrs. McNabb replied, and Mattie could see the woman would not be moved, and so she thanked her. \"You are most welcome. Now, breakfast is long since over and I have already served up luncheon, but I would be happy to make you something to eat if you like.\" \"I find I am not hungry but I thank you all the same.\" \"Certainly. I believe you will find your friends on the side porch, if you are looking for them.\" \"Thank you.\" Mattie left her then, and departed the kitchen. Mattie did indeed find Rooster and LaBoeuf on the side porch, where they sat smoking in mutual silence. They did not seem tired at all. In fact they were both downright chipper, owing, Mattie supposed, to the anticipated increase in their incomes. They greeted her loudly and made a great, mortifying fuss over her blackened eye, with Rooster suggesting that she ought to consider a career as a \"prize fighter.\" They were in such good spirits that Mattie wondered if they had been drinking. It would not surprise her to find that they had. Together they made a trip to the post office to send their telegrams off to San Antonio, El Paso, and Dardanelle, respectively. Mattie had little money left, and so she made hers very short, simply asking Mama to wire the money for a train ticket home. Afterwards they wandered about the town a while, taking in what sights there were to see. Mattie tired of it quickly, and yearned to return to the boarding house where she might rest. When Rooster suggested stopping at a tavern to \"wet his whistle\" and LaBoeuf agreed, Mattie excused herself and walked back to the boarding house alone. As she walked she wondered at the lack of satisfaction she felt, now that their aim had been met and Cunningham thwarted. She was glad the man would never harm another, but the sense of triumph she had anticipated was absent. She could not figure it. When she arrived at the boarding house, Mrs. McNabb was kind enough to serve her an early supper in the kitchen. Mattie found herself uninterested in her food, although there was nothing deficient about Mrs. McNabb's cooking. She cleaned her plate out of a hatred for wastefulness only, and then climbed the stairs to her room. It was still light out when she pulled the curtains to and climbed under the faded quilt on the bed. Mattie was awoken some hours later by the sound of a heavy thump and low voices on the stairs. She rose from her bed and walked to the door, shivering at how cold the floorboards were beneath her bare feet. Winter was on its way, and no mistake. She opened the door a crack to peer out. The hallway was dark but for the flickering of a lamp being held in someone's hand as they ascended the staircase. Briefly Mattie wondered if it was Cunningham's spirit come to perturb her. She squinted as the light moved along the whitewashed wall, and up the last stairs came LaBoeuf, the lamp in one hand and his other arm supporting a wobbling Rooster. \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she whispered, not wanting to disturb the other sleeping guests. \"Do you require assistance?\" LaBoeuf stopped short and looked up. He seemed surprised to see her standing there, and stared at her for a moment before looking carefully away. It was then that Mattie remembered that she was wearing only her nightgown. She might have been embarrassed except that he had seen her in it before, and she was much too tired to entertain such self-indulgent worries anyhow. \"Have you been drinking?\" she asked as she took a step forward out of her room. With a wince, LaBoeuf nodded and said that he himself was not drunk, but Rooster was \"well over the bay.\" Mattie raised an eyebrow at him. She did not begrudge anyone a little celebrating now and then, but the form that their celebration tended to take was not something she cared for. \"I do not see what is so pleasurable about drinking until you are insensible, but no matter,\" she said, moving to support Rooster's other side. \"Let us get him into his bed at least.\" Awkwardly, they managed to open Rooster's door and deposit him into his bed without dropping him or the lamp on the floor. The only thanks the man offered was a snore. They went out, closing the door behind them. Once they were in the hall, LaBoeuf stopped and held the lamp aloft. He tilted his head, peering at her. \"Still healing, I see,\" he said. \"Indeed,\" Mattie replied. \"I expect it will be some time before all my bumps and bruises are mended. How is your arm?\" \"As good as can be expected,\" he said. \"I was fortunate to receive such attentive care.\" Mattie smiled. \"I am glad. Gladder still that you did not injure your gun hand,\" she said, nodding at the hand which held the lamp. \"I would hate to see you out of work on account of an injury.\" \"As would I,\" he replied, smiling back at her. For a moment they stood there in the warm circle of lamplight, their eyes meeting. The moment passed, and Mattie looked away. \"Well,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Goodnight, Mattie.\" \"Goodnight, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" They went into their rooms and closed their doors. Mattie slipped back into bed and curled up on her side, tucking her cold feet close to her. She dreamed of a campfire in the woods, of a bitter wind, and of smoke rising against the sky. At times she had a companion with her, an indistinct figure whose identity seemed to shift, and at times she was utterly alone. When she awoke in the morning, her head was throbbing. Mattie met LaBoeuf in the hallway on his way down for breakfast. Rooster was still asleep. \"Are you sure you are quite all right?\" LaBoeuf asked as they descended the stair and entered the dining room. \"That eye of yours does look painful.\" \"It is only a bruise, and I am fine,\" Mattie replied, taking a seat. \"Our adventure has merely worn me out. It is nothing another night of sleep in a proper bed cannot cure.\" LaBoeuf nodded and let her be while they ate. Rooster appeared after they had finished, and the three of them set out to the post office to see whether there were any replies to their telegrams. Their trip was not in vain – each of them had received a response. LaBoeuf's contained a congratulations on his capture of Cunningham, and a guarantee that he could collect the entirety of the offered reward upon his return to El Paso. Mattie's was from Little Frank. He advised that Mama had taken to her bed the moment they returned home from Little Rock and found Mattie gone, and that she had scarcely been up since. He went on to say that money for a train ticket and fare for Alma was forthcoming, and that Mattie was to take the first train back to Dardanelle the following day. It contained no clue as to how the farm had fared in Mattie's absence, much to her dismay and annoyance. Leave it to her feckless brother to neglect the important details. Rooster's telegram indicated a rejection of his claim on the reward money offered in San Antonio, and nothing more. \"Well,\" LaBoeuf said, puffing out his chest as they stood on the board sidewalk outside the post office, \"that just about makes the whole affair worthwhile.\" \"Hm,\" Rooster replied, crumpling up his telegram and shoving it into his pocket. He took out his tobacco and began rolling himself a cigarette. \"You would think Little Frank might have told me whether they had started laying out the winter garden, at the very least,\" Mattie complained. She folded the telegram and the money order which had accompanied it, and tucked them into the bodice of her calico dress. LaBoeuf looked out over the busy street, grinning that smug grin of his. \"I suggest we find a way to celebrate,\" he said. \"You are the only one with anything to celebrate,\" Mattie replied. \"And I thought you two did your celebrating last night. Or was that merely a preamble to your celebrations?\" \"Here is what I think about the matter,\" LaBoeuf began, ignoring her. \"I think that I ought to split my reward with the two of you. It is a sizeable reward and I do not mind parting with two thirds of it.\" Mattie narrowed her eyes at him, and wondered whether he had injured his head without her knowledge. \"That is mighty generous of you, pard,\" Rooster said, \"but there ain't no need. Your reward paid out, mine didn't. Happens sometimes in this game.\" \"Yes, but it was you who suggested we split up and surround Cunningham's camp when we found him,\" LaBoeuf reasoned. \"Anyhow, the information you obtained in Hot Springs – that Cunningham was headed to Arkadelphia – why, if you had not shared that information, we might have headed toward Pine Bluff instead and never found the man!\" \"I do not want a third of the reward,\" Mattie added. \"I only want my one hundred dollars back. You two may split the remainder down the middle, or however you choose.\" \"Are you quite certain about that?\" LaBoeuf asked, surprised. \"As I said, it is a sizeable reward. Are you sure you do not at least want to recoup what you have spent getting here, and what you will spend getting home?\" \"Whatever you may think of me, I am not greedy. I want my one hundred dollars and that is all,\" she replied. \"All right, if that is how you will have it,\" LaBoeuf said. \"We will split all but one hundred dollars of it down the middle, Cogburn, and I will not hear another word about it. I will send it to you when I return to El Paso.\" \"Hm,\" Rooster grumbled. He turned and fixed his gaze on Mattie. \"You ought to get down to the train station and buy that ticket. Do as your ma says for once.\" With that, Rooster turned and ambled down the sidewalk, either back to the boarding house or to find a place to drink, Mattie supposed. \"You have offended his pride,\" Mattie said to LaBoeuf. He sighed. \"I suspect he needs cash money more than he needs pride just now,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Once he got a few drinks in him last night, he happened to tell me that he has no place to return to in San Antonio.\" \"I see,\" Mattie said, frowning. \"It is good of you to offer him a share of the reward money.\" \"Yes, well,\" LaBoeuf replied vaguely, his cheeks reddening. \"Shall we go down to the station and get you your ticket? I am happy to accompany you, for I need to buy one for myself as well. No sense in tarrying here in town once our business is concluded.\" Mattie swallowed, looking at him. She could not worry her mother a moment longer than was necessary. Yes, it was time to return home. Yet the thought of returning home to her family and her farm held a curious emptiness it never had before. She wondered whether LaBoeuf truly meant what he had said about getting a letter from her now and then. \"Come, let us get this errand out of the way,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Once we have done this, we can indulge ourselves and be idle all afternoon. Or we can find some work to do, as I am sure that would please you more.\" \"Yes,\" Mattie replied, smiling, \"perhaps Mrs. McNabb has some washing or mending or other odd jobs we could do. Idle hands are the devil's plaything.\" \"You are most surprising when you choose to enjoy a joke, Mattie Ross,\" LaBoeuf said, smiling in kind. They walked to the depot, enjoying the crisp October day. Once they had obtained their tickets at the station and arranged for the transport of their horses, they returned to the boarding house and agreed to look in on the animals themselves. The stable at the boarding house was small, but clean and warm. They found Sal and Alma happy indeed to be idle. LaBoeuf noted that both horses seemed downright apprehensive at the sight of them entering the stable. \"Do not worry,\" LaBoeuf said to Sal, giving her neck a firm pat, \"we are not here to ask anything of you, for once.\" They groomed the horses in a comfortable silence. When they were nearly done, LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"There is a theatre here in town that I am told is very lively,\" he said. \"Have you ever been to the theatre?\" \"The school will put on a pageant at Christmas and we will sometimes have a speaker or a poet come through town, but we do not have a theatre company,\" Mattie replied, using a stiff brush to pull some stubborn knots out of Alma's tail. \"Well, it would be a shame to miss an opportunity to see a proper theatre company when you have one close by. Would you do me the pleasure of allowing me to escort you to the theatre this evening?\" Mattie was glad that she was bent over, for LaBoeuf could not see what must have been her alarmed expression. She schooled her face as best she could and straightened up, looking at him over Alma's back. He stood on the other side of the wall dividing the two stalls, his good arm resting upon its edge. \"The theatre here? But Mr. LaBoeuf, your arm -\" \"My arm can stand the light work of applauding.\" \"Well, all right,\" Mattie replied, a strange nervous feeling settling in her stomach. \"Only I do not have any fine clothes.\" \"I do not have any fine clothes, either,\" said LaBoeuf in a cheerful tone. \"So you will not be alone in that.\" He turned away then, returning to grooming Sal's long mane, and began to whistle a tune. Mattie stared at the back of his buckskin vest. It took every ounce of restraint she possessed not to ask him what rodeo clowns typically wore to the theatre. Rooster did not appear that evening, and so they ate supper with the other boarders. Mrs. McNabb commented that their strange friend was losing the value of his \"board\" with every meal he missed. Mattie could not help but agree that Rooster was foolish with what little money he possessed, but out of loyalty she merely shrugged, and said nothing more about it. Nor did LaBoeuf. After supper they cleaned up as best they could and walked to the theatre, which was only a few blocks away. Mattie was pleased to discover as they went that they were not the only plain folks attending that night; plenty of others wore their Sunday best, but nothing fancy. LaBoeuf bought them each a penny ticket which allowed them a spot on the landing below the balcony. Their view of the stage was obstructed by the bottom of the balcony, but they could hear every word of the performance. They stood there amongst the other ordinary folks, right at the front. Mattie rested her hand on the polished brass railing and leaned over to see the tops of all the fine ladies' and gentlemen's heads. Between the crush of bodies and the gas footlights, it was hot and close inside the theatre. Mattie's supper did not seem to agree with her, turning about inside her throughout the show, which was amusing enough, if rather silly. LaBoeuf seemed to enjoy it tremendously, letting loose numerous hearty guffaws throughout the performance. He stood very close to her, his arm brushing against hers regularly. At one point during the performance, the people next to them shifted, jostling one another as a man made to leave. Mattie jumped when she felt LaBoeuf's arm loop around her waist, pulling her into his side, out of the way. He did not immediately remove his arm, nor did he apologise. \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she muttered, poking her elbow into his ribs. He turned and looked at her in surprise, as though he had not expected to find her there. His face reddened and his arm dropped from her waist. \"Pardon me,\" he said, his voice gruff. When the show ended, they joined the stream of people leaving the theatre, and Mattie got a better look at some of the ladies in their fine clothes and furs. Some even wore jewelled rings and pendants, and strings of real pearls. Mattie felt very plain next to them in her brown calico and the simple knot Mrs. McNabb had helped her pull her hair into. But she did not feel ashamed. Looking at a finely dressed young woman about her age on the arm of a pomaded older gentleman, Mattie guessed that the she did not know anything about balancing a ledger or bartering for a good cotton price. If that girl ever lost all her pretty things, she would be in real trouble, and Mattie would not. That was good enough for her. The hot lights and the numerous people seemed to amplify the smell of perfume and shoe polish and cigar smoke, and Mattie was glad when they finally made it outside into the fresh night air, although it did not much help the peculiar feeling in her stomach. They headed down the sidewalk, back in the direction of the boarding house. \"I would take your arm, but I am afraid mine is not up to the task just yet,\" LaBoeuf said, sounding chagrined. \"Do not be foolish,\" Mattie replied. \"I do not need your arm to guide my steps; I am hardly feeble.\" \"I have something I wish to speak to you about, but perhaps it would be best to wait until we are back at the boarding house and can have some privacy,\" LaBoeuf said then, an odd sort of frown on his face. \"All right,\" Mattie replied. She hoped he would not need much time, for she suddenly felt weary again. Supposing it was from the hot theatre and the late hour, Mattie's thought was that she wanted nothing more than to be in her bed. They walked back to the boarding house mostly in silence, which Mattie accounted to be rather strange. On her part, she was tired and could find nothing useful to speak about. LaBoeuf had never refrained from talking on account of fatigue or superfluity, yet something held his tongue now as they strolled down the board sidewalks, the cool evening around them lit only by the occasional lamp burning low in a parlour window. As they turned the corner onto the street which housed their accommodations, LaBoeuf paused, reaching out and grasping Mattie's sleeve to stop her as well. She turned and looked at him, puzzled. \"Is something wrong?\" she asked. \"Perhaps we should speak here, before we encounter Rooster, or the other boarders,\" he replied vaguely, looking down the sidewalk at the boarding house with an uncharacteristically uncertain expression on his face. He seemed to be speaking to himself, rather than to her. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, please. I am very tired,\" Mattie said. Her throat felt dry and tight, and she swallowed. LaBoeuf turned and looked at her, as though he had only just remembered her presence. He frowned. \"Are you well? You are very pale.\" Mattie's vision blurred and her temples throbbed. She pressed her fingers to her eyes as pain radiated down her neck, settling into what felt like every joint and muscle in her body. She shivered so hard that her teeth rattled. \"Something is wrong,\" she murmured, and her voice sounded high and weak, almost childish to her ears. She swallowed as a stomach-turning wave of nausea swamped her. \"I feel all-overish.\" LaBoeuf's eyes examined her face. \"Mattie? Are you all right?\" Mattie could not summon the breath to say a word, for another tide of sickness rolled through her, and her knees shook as she struggled to stay on her feet. LaBoeuf reached out to steady her, one arm sliding around her shoulders while he held the other hand to her forehead. \"Holy God, you are on fire,\" he said, and abruptly stooped and slid his other arm under her knees, scooping her into his arms as though she weighed less than a bundle of sticks. Mattie's head lolled against LaBoeuf's shoulder. She stared up at the dark, starry sky, and tried to speak, but her tongue felt thick and clumsy, and she could do little more than sigh as the perimeter of her sight shimmered and darkened, a noise like the engine of a train rushing in her ears. There was a heavy thump, and the warmth of reflected gaslights on her face, and the sound of raised voices. She felt the softness of a bed beneath her, but it did nothing to alleviate the fiery pain which shot up and down her limbs. She moaned, and a hand brushed the side of her face. \"It is all right, Mattie. Be still. The doctor is coming.\" It was LaBoeuf. \"You listen to him, little sister. For once he is in the right. You keep thrashing about like that and you are likely to put my other eye out.\" It was Rooster's voice. Mattie was confused; she did not think she was thrashing about at all, but the aching was so dreadful that she thought she might soon start. LaBoeuf and Rooster spoke to one another in lowered voices, but Mattie could still hear them. \"What do you suppose it is? I have seen plenty of smallpox and yellow fever in my day, but this I do not recognize,\" said LaBoeuf. \"Hm,\" replied Rooster. \"I have seen something like it, but not since the war. And I am not about to pull up her skirts to confirm it, neither.\" \"Pull up her skirts!\" exclaimed LaBoeuf, sounding extremely offended. \"I will not hesitate to call you out if you take advantage of her in this condition!\" \"You damn stuffed-shirt fool! I mean I expect the doctor will find she has a bite from a louse on her leg or her neck or someplace. Looks like typhus.\" \"iStop/i,\" Mattie whispered, struggling to sit up. Their silly discussion was too loud and foolish for her to tolerate in her current state. \"Whoa, sis,\" said Rooster, pushing gently on her shoulders to lay her back down. \"You just take it easy, there. Doc's gonna be here soon.\" They both were quiet then, and Mattie closed her eyes, trying to soothe the ceaseless pounding in her head. Her stomach churned. She breathed slowly and steadily in an attempt to settle it, but nothing seemed to work, and suddenly she felt she was going to be sick. She rolled herself over and, sticking her head over the edge of the bed, threw up. This time, the blackness which encroached on her vision was successful, and she felt consciousness slip away from her.[Chapter 11] Hey y'all! Sorry for the long wait between chapters, there. I actually had this done ages ago but got completely distracted by a new job and the furious need to write tons of Downton Abbey fic. I'm sorry! Hope this makes up for it. We're almost done! Thanks for all the comments and reviews. Y'all are the best! Mattie's fever felt like being trapped in a great, rambling house. The house was warm and comfortable, familiar and strange at once, a grand waiting room where nothing was expected of a body, and where one could dwell forever, dull and quiet and unperturbed. She wandered its many rooms day and night, searching. She did not know for what she searched. At times it seemed to her that there were figures in the rooms, but they were indistinct, and when she tried to follow them, they disappeared. One, she was certain, was her father, and she wanted badly to go to him. Another figure she could not identify until she recognized the bright ringing of his spurs as he walked. It was LaBoeuf. She wanted to go to him as well, but she had a notion that he would try to lead her out of the house and she was not certain she wanted to go. And so she wandered the endless, cavernous halls and corridors for what felt like days or perhaps weeks, the light that shone in through the windows growing ever dimmer as she moved, until one day she began to hear voices. Perhaps they were from the figures, or perhaps they came from some farther place. She could not find their source. \"Do not fear, Mattie. We have sent for your mother. She will come as soon as she is able. She is coming, I swear to you, and we are watching over you until she arrives.\" \"Whoa there, girl. Come on, hush now. You just hold on, baby sister. Ain't no piddly fever gonna lick you.\" \"Oh, Mattie. I despair over you. Look what has happened. I do not understand why you cannot be easy, why you must involve yourself in these ugly affairs rather than letting the lawmen do their duty. I wish your father was here. He would know what to say to you to make you understand, darling girl.\" \"Mattie, your mother is in hysterics. In your fever you talk aloud, and what you have said has upset her very badly. I do not know whether you can hear me now, but come back to us. You must come back to us. If you can battle this, you must do it. If you do not or cannot, I am not certain your mother will survive the grief. That is no bombast. And as for me, Mattie... God damn that bastard Cunningham. God damn him.\" There was something blessedly cool on her forehead, and something warm gripping her fingers like a vice. The sensations drew her gradually out of the house. Mattie became aware of a small, dark room, and a bed. There was candlelight and a heap of quilts on the floor, dampness and the smell of coal oil and vinegar. A woman was weeping. People spoke constantly in low voices, and Mattie wished they would be quiet, for her head swam and ached endlessly. There was a stranger in a dark coat who prodded her arm and touched her face. Mattie. Mattie. Come back to us. Mattie. You must come back to us. The haze began to withdraw like fog dissipating at the break of day. Mattie opened her eyes. They felt swollen and ill-used, and the sunlight in the room stabbed her head with pain. She squinted to shield her eyes. A shadow moved in the room, and she saw that a man stood at the window, looking outside. She blinked in an effort to force her eyes to focus. The man was LaBoeuf. He leaned on the windowsill. He wore only his fringed trousers and suspenders, and a faded chambray shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. Mattie was lying on her back, and she tried to shift and open her mouth to speak. Her whole body was stiff and aching, her joints aflame, and she must have unwittingly uttered some sound, for LaBoeuf turned abruptly to look at her. He was at her bedside in an instant, and he seemed astonished. \"Praise God, we thought you were lost,\" he said. His voice was hoarse. Now that he stood closer, Mattie could see that he was dishevelled and exhausted, his face peppered with stubble and dark circles under his eyes. His hair was not even combed. Mattie swallowed and tried again to speak, but her mouth was too dry. She frowned, maddened, and LaBoeuf seemed to return to himself. He leaned down and slid an arm under her back, careful not to pull on her loose hair, and settled her up against the pillows. He tucked the quilt about her waist, and went to the bedside table, where he poured water into a tin cup. Mattie tried to take it from him when he brought it near, but she found she could scarcely lift her arm. With more care than she would ever have expected of him, he held the cup to her lips and helped her drink, not spilling a drop. \"Hurts,\" Mattie managed to squeak, once he removed the cup. \"Ah,\" LaBoeuf said, and retrieved a small brown glass bottle and a teaspoon from the table. He measured out some of its syrupy yellow contents, and helped her to swallow it. It was bitter, tasting of pine needles and some sharp, burning liquor. Mattie grimaced. \"It is morphine suspended in some sort of distillation, I believe. It is the doctor's own concoction and he thinks it may help, but I do not know.\" Mattie leaned back into the pillows, exhausted by these small efforts. She watched as he sat down in a wooden chair at her bedside, his knee pressing against the coverlet. \"Your mother is here,\" LaBoeuf said. \"We sent a telegram when you fell ill. We would have sent you home on the train, but they would not have you, and the doctor advised against it. We have all been shut up here this entire time, in fact, as a precaution, but no one else has taken ill.\" \"What is it?\" Mattie asked, her voice scarcely a whisper. \"Typhus,\" LaBoeuf replied. His expression was drawn and sober as he looked at her. \"It seems you likely caught it from that devil Cunningham. The coroner found signs of it on his body.\" \"How long?\" \"You have been delirious with fever for nearly a week now,\" he said. He looked at his hands, which were clasped in his lap. \"The doctor gave us little reason to hope for your recovery. He reckoned your previous injury, in addition to what rigours you have undergone these past weeks, had weakened your constitution too much. He instructed your mother to commence planning your funeral. We all... Well, she was inconsolable, as you can imagine.\" He fell silent, and fixed his gaze down. Mattie examined his downturned head, his uncombed cowlick sticking up. Finally he cleared his throat sharply and looked at her, the strangest expression on his face. Mattie did not know what to make of his bright, tired eyes and flushed face. \"I reckon you must be like a cat, with nine lives,\" he said. Mattie frowned, for she was no great admirer of those tricky beasts. LaBoeuf smiled. \"I never would have thought I would be saying such a foolish thing, but it heartens me greatly to see that sour expression on your face once again.\" \"Mama,\" she rasped, \"where is she?\" LaBoeuf reached for the tin cup and helped her drink once more. \"She is resting. She was up most of last night with you, and when your fever worsened in the wee hours of this morning she became somewhat hysterical. The doctor gave her something to induce sleep.\" \"Poor Mama,\" Mattie said. \"She is a sweet and gentle lady, and you ought not to worry her so,\" LaBoeuf replied. His tone was rather sharp, Mattie thought, and she gave him a reproachful look. \"You are too cavalier with your own life at times. You forget that there are people who depend on you. Who love you.\" \"I did not contract typhus deliberately,\" she replied slowly. \"I know it,\" he said. He regarded her with a frown on his face which was more sad than annoyed. Mattie would have liked to needle him and raise his ire, but her head swam dizzily and she found her eyes wanting to close again already. LaBoeuf reached over and placed his hand against her forehead. It felt wonderfully cool and surprisingly soft. \"Your fever has broken, at least,\" he said. Almost of its own volition, Mattie's hand lifted from the bed and she weakly grasped his wrist and held the palm of his hand against her cheek. She held his surprised gaze for a moment, until he looked down and pulled his hand away. \"Your fever has broken, but perhaps not your delirium,\" he said. He reached for a book on the bedside table. \"Here, I will read aloud to you until you fall asleep. It is The Prince and the Pauper , by Mr. Twain. Have you read it?\" Mattie shook her head, and LaBoeuf nodded, clearing his throat. He opened the book and flipped ahead several pages. \"'In the ancient city of London,'\" he read, \"'on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty, who did not want him...'\" Mattie closed her eyes and settled back against the pillows, and let LaBoeuf's low voice lull her into a deep and untroubled sleep. When Mattie awoke again, hours had passed. The room had dimmed considerably, but there was a fire in the little stove, and a lamp lit so that it threw sharp shadows against the wall. There was the sound of a throat being cleared, and Mattie turned her head to find Rooster in the chair at her bedside, smoking a cigarette and nursing a bottle of whiskey. \"You awake there, sis?\" \"I am,\" she replied. She gave consideration to sitting up, but her body felt as limp as a wet dishrag, and the mere thought of the ordeal was enough to overwhelm her. Instead, she rolled stiffly onto her side and watched him. \"Anything you need?\" \"I am all right,\" Mattie said. \"Where is my mother?\" \"She is downstairs, taking some supper. She has been tending you much of the day. Once Mr. LaBoeuf shared the good news that you were awake and talking sense, we were able to convince him that he needed some rest himself.\" Here Rooster paused and regarded her in the lamplight for a protracted moment. Mattie thought he was waiting for her to speak, but finally he cleared his throat and said, \"LaBoeuf has been your most stalwart watchman. He has hardly left your side since you came down with this fever.\" Mattie did not know what to say to this, nor what to make of the thoughtful expression on Rooster's face. \"I suppose catching a fever and rapping on Death's door is one way to give him some encouragement,\" Rooster continued. \"It appeals to the thwarted dime novel hero in him.\" To hear LaBoeuf's character so reduced at this moment annoyed Mattie, and she scowled at Rooster. \"Mr. LaBoeuf may be vain and arrogant, but he is a good man and a true friend, and you have no call to mock him.\" \"That is not what you have called him in the past, if I recall, but I reckon it is possible for an opinion to be changed. Especially a woman's.\" Rooster stubbed the butt of his cigarette in a china saucer on the table. It was full of such leavings. \"Your mother is considerably impressed by him. Perhaps she is searching for a husband, if you are not.\" \"If you are only here to harangue me, I will ask you to leave,\" Mattie said. \"I do not mind your company when you are congenial, but if you are in an argumentative mood I would rather you left. I am too tired for this.\" Rooster stared at her, a surprising degree of contrition creeping into his expression. He leaned back in his chair, looking down at the bottle clasped in his hands, and did not say anything for several moments. \"Doc says you're likely to make a full recovery,\" he said eventually. \"We was all mighty relieved to hear it.\" \"I am sorry to have worried you all,\" Mattie replied. \"It was not my desire to do so.\" \"I weren't much worried, myself. Saw plenty of typhus in the war and knew you weren't the type to succumb to it so easy. You're made of tougher stuff than that.\" \"Death comes for us all, regardless of whether we are made of 'tough stuff' or not.\" \"Reckon that's true,\" Rooster said. He cleared his throat. \"Glad you're on the mend, anyhow.\" Mattie was about to respond when there came a tentative knock at the door. Mattie croaked out a greeting, and the door opened to reveal her mother. \"Oh!\" Mama said, one hand flying to her mouth while the other gripped the door knob. \"Oh, I could hardly believe it, but here you are – awake at last!\" \"I'll leave you,\" Rooster said. He stood and took his hat off the bureau, nodding at them both before departing. Mama closed the door behind him and turned around. She stood in the middle of the room, holding her handkerchief to her mouth and looking lost. She stared at Mattie with a careworn expression. Finally she sighed and came to sit in the chair Rooster had vacated, and wrapped one arm around her own waist, as though she had to hold herself together. \"Oh, Mattie!\" Mama sighed after a moment. \"How you worry me, leaving home like that! I do not know what I should do with you.\" \"There was no other reasonable course,\" Mattie replied. \"No, I do not suppose it occurred to you that it might be best to stay at home and allow the authorities to deal with a violent fugitive as they saw fit,\" Mama replied, shaking her head ruefully. \"It was suggested to me by Mr. LaBoeuf,\" said Mattie. \"Yes, I am well aware that Mr. LaBoeuf was unaccommodating of your attempts to follow him,\" Mama said. \"I do not hold the man responsible. I am certain that nothing short of tying you up and locking you in the cellar would have prevented you from following him, and I can only guess what damage you would have done him had he attempted such a thing.\" Mattie owned that this was likely true, and did not disagree. She watched in silence as Mama's soft brown eyes examined Mattie's face. After a moment, she reached out and cupped Mattie's cheek. \"I am so glad that you are all right,\" she said, her voice rough and tearful. \"If anything more dire or permanent had befallen you, if you were taken from me, I do not think I would be able to bear it.\" \"We can bear any loss so long as we have the Lord near,\" Mattie replied. \"No,\" Mama said. There was a quiet steeliness in her voice that took Mattie aback. Mama shook her head. \"No, I would not have borne it. Not after everything we have lost, after what we have withstood. Mattie, you do not have a beloved daughter. You cannot understand... No. No, I would not have borne it, Mattie, whatever you may think.\" Mama's hand wrapped around Mattie's, and she squeezed. Mattie went to cover Mama's hand with her own, stopping short when she recalled with a pang that she had only one. She swallowed. \"I am sorry to have worried you, Mama,\" Mattie said honestly. Mama sighed. \"It is not the first time. I suppose I ought to be accustomed to your wildness by now.\" \"Wildness!\" Mattie protested. \"I am not wild. I am the opposite of wild, in fact.\" \"Your friends tell me you fought this fugitive man off with nothing but a hunter's knife. That is not wild?\" Mama asked, a hint of a smile in her tone. \"Not at all,\" Mattie replied. \"I think it is very civilized, in fact.\" \"Perhaps one man's wild is another man's civilized,\" Mama said, smiling. A sly look entered her expression. \"Perhaps,\" Mattie replied. She frowned, eyeing her mother suspiciously. It seemed she was making a joke of some kind, although Mattie was not sure what it was. \"You will have to ask your friend Mr. LaBoeuf what his opinion is, when next you see him.\" With a soft laugh, Mama stood and pressed a kiss to Mattie's forehead. \"You may tell me about all of your adventures later. For now you must rest,\" she said. She turned and left the room, closing the door behind her. Mattie did not fall asleep right away. She stared up at the beadboard ceiling for some time, trying to determine what Mama had found so amusing. A day passed before Mattie was able to consume anything more than weak clear tea. Two more days passed before she was able to convince Mama that she be allowed out of bed. It was another day yet before she was permitted downstairs to eat with the new boarders who had taken rooms once the doctor declared that there was no longer a risk of Mattie infecting anyone. Mama helped her down the staircase, for when Mattie tried to walk unassisted, her legs quaked beneath her. She had lost weight, and was weak as a newborn foal. It was a hateful feeling. She was not able to stay downstairs longer than the duration of the meal. Exhaustion quickly overwhelmed her, and rest was her only recourse. Mattie pushed herself to get well as quickly as she could, for the great expense she and Mama garnered at the boarding house the longer they malingered weighed heavily on her mind. They did all right at home, but they did not have the money for such trifling things as two week sojourns in boarding houses. When she nearly swooned one afternoon forcing herself to walk without help to the privy outside, Mama scolded her gently before admitting that she had been working off much of their room and board by helping Mrs. McNabb in the kitchen. The two widows had become fast friends. Slowly, Mattie got well and regained her old strength. LaBoeuf made a point of coming to visit her each afternoon, when he would read to her from novels he borrowed from Mrs. McNabb and some of the other boarders. Mattie did not know what he and Rooster did with themselves all day except take up space in the local taverns, she supposed, and she did not understand why they had not yet gone home. One afternoon Mattie told LaBoeuf that he need not bother with the reading anymore, for she was well enough to hold up a book and read on her own, at least. LaBoeuf stared at her over the top of Treasure Island for a long moment. \"That is not why I come here and read to you,\" he said finally, and then continued with the story as though she had not interrupted him. Rooster also visited her regularly. He would sit by her bedside and smoke cigarettes and tell her long, meandering tales which may have happened in his life, or someone else's. He would talk until his cigarette burned down, say, \"well,\" and then stand up and leave the room without another word. One morning a full three weeks after she fell ill, Mattie washed and dressed herself in her brown calico dress, which was a full inch too large for her now, allowed Mama to pull her hair back into a handsome knot at the nape of her neck, and then walked downstairs to the dining room for breakfast without any assistance. As she passed through the foyer, she caught sight of two figures outside on the wide front porch. It was Rooster and LaBoeuf, smoking in the early morning light. Mattie paused there, watching them, and she felt pleased that they truly had put their differences aside and become \"pards.\" She approached and, opening the screen door, caught the end of what Rooster had been saying. \"-wouldn't think it, lookin' at her, but if you come on too strong, she'll spook on you, and make no mistake.\" LaBoeuf nodded, but did not reply immediately, and so Mattie interjected. \"Are you considering the acquisition of a new horse, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked. \"You cannot be talking about Sal. Never have I met a steadier horse with a lesser tendency toward spooking.\" Rooster and LaBoeuf both turned and looked at her, apparently surprised to see her standing there. \"By God, girl,\" Rooster said, \"nearly strangled and beaten and shot to death and on Death's door from typhus besides, and here you are looking as hale as can be.\" \"It is a true pleasure indeed to see you back to your old self,\" LaBoeuf added. \"I was just going to come up there and say farewell,\" Rooster continued. \"Farewell?\" Mattie asked. \"Are you heading somewhere?\" \"It is time I moved on,\" he replied. \"Money's run out.\" \"Oh,\" Mattie breathed, the brightness of the morning dimming considerably in her eyes as she contemplated saying goodbye to her friend. At least this time he was allowing her to say her goodbye, rather than sneaking off when she was delirious with fever. LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"I will leave you to it. Cogburn, it has been an honour and a pleasure.\" \"An honour and a pleasure, pard,\" Cogburn replied, grasping the brim of his hat. With that, LaBoeuf turned and went inside, leaving them alone on the porch. \"I suppose I should not be surprised that you are leaving,\" Mattie said. \"We have been here for weeks. Now that I am well again I am sure Mama and I will return home shortly. I do not know why Mr. LaBoeuf remains here. I am sure he too will be returning home soon.\" \"Maybe not so soon,\" Rooster replied, removing a bottle of spirits from his coat and taking a considerable swig. \"Well, whatever you do, only do what you think is right. Folks like to say otherwise, but the truth is, don't matter what anyone thinks of you. Only opinion that matters is yours, and the Almighty's. No need to do a thing or not do a thing just 'cause some fool-headed son-of-a-bitch says you ought to, or ought not to.\" \"Marshal Cogburn,\" Mattie scolded. She frowned, unsure what had brought this on. She did not know what he was talking about at all. \"Hm,\" he said, eyeing her. \"Reckon you'll be all right. Ain't steered yourself wrong so far. He better just hope you want to steer in his direction.\" \"Perhaps you ought to wait until you are sober to depart,\" Mattie suggested, baffled by his words. \"It seems foolhardy to ride off alone, in strange country, in your current disposition.\" Rooster gave a gruff cough. \"You look after yourself, you hear? And your Mama, too. She is a good woman. You ought not to worry her like you do, gadding about all adventuresome,\" Rooster said. \"Mr. LaBoeuf has already taken the liberty of scolding me on this topic, so you need not trouble yourself. But what about you? Who do you worry when you 'gad about all adventuresome'?\" \"Hm,\" Rooster replied, a ghost of a smile tugging at his mouth. He did not seem eager to respond to this, and there was a long pause before Mattie spoke again. \"Will you write to me, at least?\" Rooster regarded her for a moment, and then nodded. \"I doubt any letter I write will be up to snuff as far as you're concerned, but if you would like a letter all the same...\" \"I would,\" Mattie replied. \"Do not be a stranger, Rooster. I will always like to know how you are faring, wherever you are.\" He eyed Mattie for a moment longer, and she thought he might have something more to say. Instead, he turned abruptly from her and walked down the stairs to where Whiskey Jack stood, his head hung low. Rooster mounted, and without a wave or a farewell, he trotted off down the street, heading west. When Mattie went back inside, she found LaBoeuf standing at the bottom of the staircase, examining the band of his hat with a frown on his face. His head was tilted down, and his cowlick was sticking straight up. Mattie wondered whether he ever bothered to attempt to wrangle the thing, or whether it was simply so stubborn that it would not be combed. Mattie closed the large oak front door behind her, and LaBoeuf looked up. \"He has gone, although I do not know how far he will get, given the state he is in,\" Mattie said. \"That is Rooster Cogburn for you,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"I expect he is more accustomed to riding while intoxicated than riding while sober.\" \"I reckon you are right about that,\" Mattie sighed. They regarded each other in silence for a moment, and then LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"Mattie, there is something...\" he trailed off here, a look of frustration on his face. Mattie stared at him, trying to uproot the problem. His eyes met hers, and he swallowed. \"Tomorrow is Sunday,\" he said. \"It is,\" Mattie replied. \"Are you planning to attend a service?\" \"I am,\" she nodded. \"Mama tells me there is a Presbyterian church on the next street that looks as though it will suit me. I do not think Mama will come. She does not favour a strange congregation. I do not see why it should matter, but that is her way. Why do you ask?\" \"May I accompany you?\" Mattie looked at him sharply. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I did not know you were a Presbyterian.\" \"Well,\" he paused, frowning, \"I am not a Presbyterian, but it has been a long time since I have attended a service of any denomination, and I would like to attend with you, if you do not mind my company.\" \"I suppose I do not mind it.\" \"All right,\" he said, looking tremendously relieved. Clasping his hat in one hand, he held his injured arm out to her. \"Shall we go eat?\" Mattie peered sceptically at the proffered limb. \"How is your injury?\" \"If it is still injured,\" he said, tucking her arm into his and leading her towards the dining room, \"I do not feel it.\" After breakfast the following morning, Mattie cleaned up, and then met LaBoeuf on the porch. When she came out the door, she found him leaning a shoulder against one of the whitewashed posts holding the porch roof up, smoking his pipe. When she appeared, he straightened up and tapped the ashes out of his pipe. \"You look very handsome this morning,\" he said. His regard made her self-conscious, and she smoothed her hand over her hair, which Mama had pulled back into a tidy knot at the back of her head. She had no hat, or else she would have worn it. \"I would not know if I was or was not,\" Mattie said finally in reply, not knowing what else to say. LaBoeuf nodded, and they departed, walking down the street in silence. Mattie noticed that although he was dressed in his usual ostentatious buckskin, he had left his gun belt and his spurs behind, and so cut a slightly less conspicuous figure as they walked to the church. They arrived in plenty of time and found seats near the front of the church. Mattie was pleased to find herself at a Presbyterian service after so many weeks of going without, and quietly thanked God for seeing her through her recent trials. LaBoeuf, meanwhile, fidgeted and sighed with regularity during the service, and Mattie wondered why he had bothered to come along at all. Perhaps he worried that she would swoon on the sidewalk once more. The thought annoyed her. \"Did you enjoy the service?\" he asked as they left the church once the service had ended. \"Yes, very much,\" she replied. \"It is pleasant to once more be in a civilized place where such things are available. Did you enjoy it?\" \"It was all right,\" he said. He cleared his throat sharply, and began talking of the weather, placing her arm once more into the crook of his. They walked down the sidewalk that way. LaBoeuf did not seem to be in any great hurry to return to the boarding house, for his steps were leisurely. It made Mattie impatient. Eventually they arrived back at the boarding house. Mattie extracted her arm from LaBoeuf's and was about to go inside to scold Mama for not coming along when LaBoeuf grasped her gently by the wrist and stopped her. \"Mattie,\" he said, his voice taut and quiet. \"Mattie – may I speak with you a moment, here, in private?\" \"All right,\" she replied. LaBoeuf walked to the end of the porch and leaned on the railing, looking down at the dried brown lilac bushes which lined one side of the house. Mattie waited for him to speak, but he said nothing for some time. Finally Mattie grew impatient and she cleared her throat. LaBoeuf turned around to look at her, his hat in his hands. \"I am going to retire from the Rangers,\" he said. He spoke the words in such a strange voice, with such a sombre frown on his face, that Mattie guessed that he had only recently come to this decision, and that this was likely the first time he had said it aloud. \"But your work means a great deal to you,\" Mattie replied, unsure whether he was in a mood to be congratulated or consoled. She did not think herself adequately equipped for either. \"Yes, it does mean a great deal to me,\" he said, meeting her eyes. \"You understand that.\" \"Of course I do.\" \"Of course you do,\" he repeated. He looked away from her, out over the street, still frowning. \"My mother always desired for me to become a lawyer, but I did not think I had the temperament for it. I wanted to be more than a cog in the machine of justice. I wanted to be at the very head of it, I guess you could say.\" Mattie regarded him, thinking what a good lawyer he would have made, with his thorough knowledge of the law and his capability for high sentence. \"Although I have only borne witness to two endeavours of yours,\" she said, \"if you have conducted yourself in the rest of your undertakings with the seriousness and commitment to duty which I have seen in you, then I think you have fulfilled your ambitions tenfold.\" LaBoeuf met her eyes and fixed her with a look Mattie could only describe as tender. She felt a strange shock in the pit of her stomach at the sight of it, and she swallowed. \"A former colleague of mine with the Rangers has started up a bail bonds business in Ysleta,\" LaBoeuf continued, \"and before I left to pursue Cunningham, he asked me to join him. I think I will take him up on his offer when I return.\" \"That is serendipitous,\" Mattie said. \"I am sure that new occupation will suit you very well.\" \"Thank you. I believe it will, too.\" LaBoeuf abruptly reached and clutched her hand in his for a moment before releasing it and turning away from her. He cleared his throat. \"I own a piece of land south of Ysleta whose western limit is the Rio Grande. There is a small pecan grove there, and some pasture land along the river. I have not yet built a house on it, but I think one day it will make a fine little farm.\" Although Mattie had never been to El Paso or any place similar to it, she could almost picture the place LaBoeuf described. She imagined barren, dusty land, and then the green shade of a stand of pecan trees, like a little oasis. \"I am sure you are right about that. Do you plan to build a house and live there soon?\" LaBoeuf turned back to face her. \"I do. Only I do not relish the thought of living there alone.\" He paused here with great significance, and Mattie stared at him. \"Being so adept at managing a cotton farm, I wonder whether you would like to try your hand at pecans,\" he continued. Mattie frowned. \"I do not understand you.\" \"I am asking if you will come to Texas with me, as my wife,\" he said. Mattie gaped at him, her throat abruptly gone dry. \"I do not... That is, I am not... What do you mean by this?\" LaBoeuf tilted his head at her, his brows drawn together in exasperation. \"Mattie, why do you think I have lingered here? I was expected back at my post weeks ago,\" he said. \"But I could not leave your side until I knew you were well. When I realised how essential your health and your happiness have become to my own, there was only one conclusion I could reasonably draw, which was that I love you most sincerely, and that I want you to be my wife.\" \"Oh,\" Mattie replied, the word a mere exhalation of breath. She did not know what to say to him. \"We would not marry right away,\" he continued. \"You must return home with your mother, and we will make the necessary arrangements in due course. As I said, I do not yet have a house built on that land, and I would not expect you to tolerate my current accommodations, which are modest, and suitable only for a bachelor who is seldom at home. Naturally I would have a house for you to live in before we could marry.\" Mattie stared at him, reeling with the implications of what he was asking. He meant for her to leave Yell County, leave the Arkansas River and her wide cotton fields, leave her barn and her corncrib, leave her house with Papa's desk, leave Mama and Little Frank and Victoria. He wanted her to quit her home and go live with him in a far-flung place where the land and the customs and the people were strange to her. He would be the only familiar thing. Looking at his imploring face, Mattie's thought was that he was not nearly familiar enough for all that. \"But what of my mother?\" she stammered. \"Who will look after her, if I am not there to do it?\" \"Your mother would not want to deny you happiness for the sake of some imagined duty, would she?\" \"'Imagined duty'? Duty to one's parents is no fever dream, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Of course not, but you are not her only child. Surely your sister and your brother share in the responsibility for your mother, young as they are. Anyhow, your mother is hardly feeble,\" he replied. \"I will grant you that that is true. But you and I would exhaust one another with our bickering! There would never be peace,\" Mattie said. \"I swear to you we will have peace, if only you will let me win from time to time.\" \"Let you win? Such phrasing implies that you are not capable of winning on your own merit. I see you have less faith in your mulishness than I do.\" \"I have great faith in the mulishness on both our parts,\" LaBoeuf replied, in a tone that implied that his foolish words were endlessly reasonable. \"I do not see this as a point against us. Rather it is one of several reasons why we would make an ideal match. If you paired either one of us with some gentler, less gritty person, we would trample the poor creature.\" Mattie was exasperated at his persistence. He would not see reason, and so she pressed on in the most candid way she knew how. \"Perhaps there is some strange similarity in our temperaments, but I do not think I would be much good to you as a wife . You must want children to carry on your name. I cannot cradle a baby with but one arm.\" LaBoeuf appeared stricken by this remark, and stared at her in bewilderment for a moment before speaking. \"Mattie, do you think that you are deficient, or that I find you so?\" Mattie looked down, unsure how to answer. She did not think herself to be deficient, but she knew herself to be incomplete in a way that she had come to believe excluded her from the realm of courtship. Even before losing her arm, her looks and demeanour invited little attention, and in the intervening years, she had learned that her injury only solidified her unsuitability as a wife. What she had told LaBoeuf before had been the truth – she did not mind, for she found the majority of young men to be foolhardy creatures, and never wanted to find herself hitched to one as to a lazy mule for the rest of her life. \"There is little purpose in pussyfooting around the thing,\" she said slowly, meeting his inquiring gaze. \"I get along all right at home, but I would not be able to do everything a wife must do in order to keep house. As I said, I cannot cradle a baby with but one arm. My sewing is extremely slow and not particularly artful. I cannot mend your clothing or make you new things. We will have to get store-bought clothes, which is a foolish waste.\" \"I can mend my own things, and yours as well.\" \"Now you are being ridiculous, and mocking me also. What kind of woman allows her husband to go around in clothes he has mended himself?\" \"I did not know there was a law in place against such things,\" LaBoeuf replied, cocking his head. \"Certainly there is no such law in Texas. Does such a law exist in Yell County?\" Mattie did not care to acknowledge his sarcastic remarks. \"Yell County is my home. I do not wish to pull up stakes and find myself living on the bald, dusty plains in Texas.\" \"You know little of Texas. It is not so bad as all that, as Cogburn might have you believe. I think you would like it.\" \"You do not know that. What if we married in haste and went to live in Texas, and I detested it altogether? What is your smart answer for that, I wonder?\" LaBoeuf huffed a frustrated breath. \"What if the sky falls down on our heads tomorrow? You are looking for trouble where there is none yet to be found.\" \"I am attempting to treat the question practically. You have lost your wits altogether, I fear. I do not know what has prompted you to lose them when they have been dependable enough in the past.\" \" You prompted me to lose them,\" LaBoeuf said, taking a step closer to her and clasping her upper arms in his hands. He looked down at her, an expression on his face which surprised her with its intensity. Suddenly he pulled her close and kissed her, his hands pressing her stays into the flesh of her back in a most distracting manner. Mattie tolerated him for a moment, and then pushed him away. His face was flushed and she feared hers was, as well. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, it is Sunday ,\" she scolded him. LaBoeuf cleared his throat and had the decency at least to look contrite as he stepped back to put a respectable distance between them. They regarded one another in silence for a moment, and Mattie felt a pang in her chest at his hopeful expression. She had a sudden reckoning of what he must have looked like when he went off to fight in the war when he was barely 15 years old. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, can we not proceed from this moment as friends, as though this discussion never came between us?\" LaBoeuf did not reply immediately, and in his face Mattie could see his frustration and his sadness. She wanted to look away but could not, would not. She would not be cowardly. Not even now, when she felt a foreign weakness urging her to run from him. \"You cannot always have your way in every little thing, Mattie,\" he said. \"You may feel nothing for me and tell me so, and you may refuse my offer. But you cannot stop me from voicing the content of my heart to you. You cannot stop me from feeling what I feel, from loving you. You do not have to agree to what I have asked you, but you cannot stop that, whatever your answer is.\" \"I believe that my answer is no, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said softly. His eyes searched hers for a moment, and then he shook his head. \"Do not say that. I know that once you have chosen a course there will be no moving you from it, so I must ask that you do not say no. Not yet. Think the thing over, and speak to your mother. Please, Mattie. Just do not say no, outright.\" LaBoeuf entreated her with such sincerity that Mattie found she could not say no. She nodded silently at him, wondering at her own lack of starch. The trouble was his eyes. If only he would not look at her so, she could be as firm as she ought to be. She left him standing there on the porch with a promise that she would consider his offer. She frowned at the feeling in the pit of her stomach; it was as though she had swallowed a brick. She did not know whether her promise had been a lie or not. As she opened the door and went inside, she could feel his eyes on her back as surely as a touch.[Chapter 12] My goodness. Hard to believe we've arrived at this point. After this chapter, there's only one more to go, and then we're done. Eep. Hope you enjoy! Mattie sat on the end of her brass bed, staring out the window. The sun was going down, and the room had grown cold. The bare branches of the tree outside scraped against the clapboard siding, and the sound felt lonely to her. She frowned. The sound was the result of the wind – it expressed no feeling. The tree did not have senses or emotions. Nor did the wind. She stood and struck a match against the bedside table, and lit the lamp. She was replacing its delicate glass top when there was a soft knock on the door. \"Mattie?\" \"Yes, Mama,\" Mattie replied. The door opened, and her mother entered, closing the door behind her. Her dark, delicate brows were drawn together in a frown, and she looked pale. \"Are you all right, Mattie? You have not taken sick again, have you? Only you have been up here for hours, and I began to worry that perhaps -\" \"I am all right. Or I am not ill, at least,\" Mattie replied. She saw the pained relief that crossed her mother's face. Mattie cleared her throat. \"Mr. LaBoeuf has asked me to marry him.\" \"Oh, Mattie!\" Mama exclaimed, clutching her handkerchief to her bosom. Her expression came alive with delight, two spots of pink appearing high on her cheekbones. \"He said the other night that he might wish to speak to me, and I admit I wondered what he had planned.\" \"He might have asked your permission first, as that is the proper way of things,\" Mattie griped. Mama tilted her head at her. \"I believe Mr. LaBoeuf is familiar enough with your character that he knew that yours is the only permission he truly needs. Not mine.\" Mattie nodded, not having a response to this. Silence fell between them and Mattie found she could not meet her mother's eyes. \"Marriage can be a solace in hard times,\" Mama said, after a long pause. \"A husband and wife can lean on one another in a way that one cannot do with other acquaintances.\" \"That may be true enough for some, but as for me, the Lord is my solace,\" Mattie replied. Mama looked at her with a sad, anxious expression in her eyes. \"Mattie, there is scarcely a day that goes by that I do not think of your Papa, and miss him. Nor is there a day that goes by that I am not grateful for the time we had together, those happy years, few as they turned out to be, and for you, and Frank, and Victoria.\" Mama paused and looked away, shaking her head. \"Consider Mr. LaBoeuf's offer with care. I know you are proud and headstrong, and God strike me down, I would not have you another way, for you have been like a rock to me. Only I do not wish for you to regret him. My true desire is for you to be as happy as I have been.\" To this, Mattie found she had no response. With a sigh, she sat back down on the edge of the bed, her hand holding the brass bedpost. \"Your Papa would approve of him, though, that is for certain,\" Mama continued. \"Truly, do you think so?\" \"Why, of course! Mr. LaBoeuf has an honourable occupation, although it is dangerous, and by all appearances he is dutiful and cordial. There is no reason I can see for your Papa or myself to disapprove.\" Mattie's thought was that Papa had been too lenient and kindly in his judgments of others generally, but she did not say so. \"Mr. LaBoeuf tells me he plans to retire from the Rangers and take part in a bail bonds business with an acquaintance of his in Ysleta. He owns a good piece of land there with a pecan grove. He desires for me to oversee it.\" Mama's gaze was soft, and she tilted her head. \"There are not many men who would be so obliging to their wife's peculiar ways as to ensure an occupation for her as part of their proposal.\" \"My ways are not peculiar,\" Mattie replied sullenly. \"Rather I think they are very reasonable.\" \"I know you do. But I think you will find that most men will not see it as you do.\" \"I care little for what most men see or do not see.\" \"Mattie, please,\" Mama entreated her. \"Do not be stubborn. You know that if you wish never to marry any man, I will not harangue you, and you will always have a place at home. I would not have you marry any old ragamuffin who came asking for you only because he came asking. Yet... Mr. LaBoeuf, he has told you that he has an affection for you?\" \"He tells me he loves me sincerely, and that he has only stayed here and not returned home out of an interest in my well-being,\" Mattie replied. \"Oh, Mattie,\" Mama sighed. \"You will do what you think is best, but my girl, do not casually dismiss what is being offered to you because you fear compromise.\" \"I do not fear compromise,\" Mattie said, confused as to Mama's meaning. She shook her head. \"Be it what it would, I think perhaps our adventures have simply harrowed up some desire of his to settle and have a family. He would be just as content if not more so with some other person, a woman from Texas. His head will be turned soon enough.\" Mama frowned. \"Mr. LaBoeuf does not seem the kind of man who casts idle proposals of marriage all about the country. He is an honourable man. If he has told you he cares for you and wishes to be wedded to you, I imagine he is very intent on you in particular.\" Mattie looked down at the floor. It was true enough, she supposed. She doubted LaBoeuf travelled the country offering empty promises to every woman he met. Rather she suspected he liked to believe he left a trail of pining hearts in his wake. She bit her cheek to kill the smile the thought conjured. \"You have told me of Mr. LaBoeuf's proposal, and his feelings, and your practical objections. But you have not told me of your feelings. Do you feel nothing at all for him?\" Sharply, Mattie looked up to meet Mama's calm, steady gaze. She swallowed. In truth, \"nothing\" was not how she could most accurately describe her feelings for LaBoeuf. What she felt for him was not within a mile of \"nothing.\" \"I cannot give you instruction in this, Mattie,\" Mama said gently. \"You must choose for yourself. Only remember that having someone love you and take you as you are is a rare and precious thing in this world.\" Mama came forward and bent to kiss Mattie on top of her head. She turned and walked to the door. \"Consider his offer with care,\" she said again, her hand resting on the door knob. \"You have always had a strong will of your own, my dear, and it has served you well. Do not let this be the moment when you lead yourself astray.\" Mama left then, closing the door behind her, leaving Mattie alone. The lamplight flickered, warping her shadow where it was cast on the far wall. Mattie stared straight ahead at the window where LaBoeuf had been standing when she awoke from her fever. She did not know what to do, and such a state of indecision was foreign to her. If she refused him, he would leave. His pride would not allow him to stay in her presence under such circumstances, she knew. It was likely that he would not care to write to her or get a letter from her, either. If she did not agree to marry him, she would never see him again. It was as good as certain. He would return to Texas and perhaps find another woman to marry. Mattie's hand clutched the bedpost, and she swallowed the lump that rose in her throat. Feeling lightheaded, she attempted to compose herself. That was no reason to marry. One ought to marry for security, and for practicality, not out of fear. Mattie frowned. What was it she feared? Becoming estranged from a person whom she had grown to respect and even admire, after a fashion, she supposed. Also the fear that she would, as Mama suggested, regret him. Fear that he would ride back to Texas and never think of her again. She knew if he left, she would think of him, and that such thoughts would pain her. She did not need his shelter or his help. What other good reason was there to marry a person and bind yourself to him for the whole of your life? Love , said a small voice from deep inside her. Love is the reason . Even as she castigated herself for being foolish, she knew. She knew that the fear and sorrow she felt at the thought of being parted from LaBoeuf came from her love for him. Love was the reason for it all. It gave her an uncanny feeling to unearth this truth within herself. It was strange and familiar at once, brand new but old as well, as old as anything. It was obscured from view, hidden away, but it had been there all along. It was necessary, like her very bones. Love was the reason for it all. This was not something many people would understand about her. Most thought her hard and cold and strange, an unnatural girl who shed no tears over her father's death and who cared only for money and cotton and the unyielding word of the Lord. She knew people thought this; they had said as much to her, and much harsher words, she reckoned, behind her back. They did not understand. Mattie had loved her father more than any person, and so she could not rest until his killer met justice at her own hand. Her determination, her doggedness and fearlessness – it all stemmed from the love she had for Papa. If it had not been for the fierce love that burned inside her, she would not have pursued Tom Chaney, or met Rooster and LaBoeuf, or had her arm cut off to save her life. She did not regret a moment of it, or a moment since. Every time she moved to grab something with a hand that was no longer there, she felt an emptiness inside which was filled right away with the knowledge that she had not let her father's murder go unchecked. She remembered that she did right by him. If no one understood this about her, she did not mind it. It was only that her ways made her seem untouchably heartless. The rude boarder in Hot Springs had not been the first to tell her she was a \"spinster in the making.\" No one could see the more tender part of her, except perhaps Mama. Except perhaps LaBoeuf, it seemed. The thought of him made her chest ache. Perhaps she was strange or unnatural, she did not know, but she was by no means cold or hard. She was by no means heartless. And cotton and money and her church were not the only things she cared for, not by far. What if she had spurned LaBoeuf's silly pride too badly in trying to refuse him? What if he would never speak to her again? What if he did depart for Texas and find some handsome woman, some warmer woman with a sweeter disposition with whom he could \"settle down\"? What if he had already gone? Mattie stood, her head pounding. She turned and caught sight of herself in the small looking glass on the washstand. The forlorn expression she spied there made her almost unrecognizable. Shaking herself, Mattie turned and extinguished the lamp on the bureau. She threw open the door, slamming it closed behind her before hurrying down the stairs. She sped through the foyer, passing the parlour full of guests visiting and drinking their after supper tea and coffee. \"Why, Miss Ross!\" someone exclaimed as she passed. Mattie did not answer. Where would he be? Not with the other guests in the parlour. It was twilight; he was likely on the porch, smoking his pipe. Mattie opened the front door, and stepped out into the cool October night. There he was. LaBoeuf sat on one of the porch chairs in a square of diffused light thrown by the oil lamps in the parlour, his elbows leaning on his knees and his head bowed. He was smoking his pipe, and Mattie's thought was that he looked very much like he had the moment she first laid eyes on him, only considerably less smug. She closed the door behind her, and cleared her throat. \"Good evening, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" LaBoeuf turned and was on his feet in an instant, his pipe abandoned and his hat in his hands. His look was pensive. \"I have spoken with my mother,\" Mattie said. \"I see,\" he said. He seemed wary of her, and it pained her to think that she had the power to wound him, and that he was prepared for her to do so. \"And what did she have to say?\" \"She sees no reason to object to it.\" LaBoeuf nodded, his eyes searching hers. \"All right. What do you have to say?\" Mattie looked down at the toes of her shoes, poking out from beneath the hem of her skirt. \"I say... Will you command my obedience and order me about like a servant?\" LaBoeuf regarded her, befuddled. \"No, I will not,\" he replied. \"Will you run around town, gambling and drinking and carousing?\" \"I will not.\" \"Will you be cruel and neglectful?\" \"I will not.\" \"Will you use harsh and vulgar words when speaking to me, or use a switch when you do not like what I have to say?\" \"I will not.\" \"Will you wallow in filth and expect me to delight in cleaning up after you?\" \"I will not.\" \"Will you attend church with me every Sunday, come rain or shine?\" LaBoeuf's whiskers twitched, and he seemed to be holding back a smile. \"I most certainly will.\" \"Well, in that case... All right.\" LaBoeuf's mirth disappeared and he stepped forward, dropping his hat to the floor and taking her hand in his. \"You agree to it? Truly?\" \"I agree to it, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mattie replied. He clasped her hand between his for a moment, and then pulled her to his chest. Mattie was stunned for a moment at his abruptness, but she relaxed, letting him hold her. His arms were not tight; she could have pulled away at any moment. She laid her head against his chest, where she could feel his heart beating under her cheek. He smelled of leather and saddle soap and pipe smoke, and Mattie found she liked the curious combination. She closed her eyes and inhaled deeply. \"That is quite the sigh,\" LaBoeuf said softly, his low voice rumbling through her. Mattie shivered and opened her eyes. \"This seems untoward,\" she replied. \"It would only be untoward if we had not first made our acquaintance in a boarding house bedroom,\" LaBoeuf reasoned. \"Anyhow, I have long since learned that what is untoward is of little consequence to you. Or to me, now that I think on it.\" Mattie leaned back to look at him. \"Are you implying that I am a woman of loose morals?\" LaBoeuf laughed, and pulled her close again. His chin rested on her head. \"There is nothing loose whatsoever about your morals, Mattie Ross.\" They stood that way for some time, and Mattie felt a sweet sense of peaceful relief fill her chest. She blew out another deep breath. He had not gone. He would not quit her and go to Texas and marry someone else. He would be with her all the time, now, until God chose to part them. \"When you fell ill, I thought perhaps the Lord had other plans for you and I would never have the opportunity to hold you in this way,\" he said, after some time. He paused again, and then cleared his throat. \"I have decided that it is all right if you do not love me as I love you. I believe that, with time, you will come to feel a similar fondness for me.\" Mattie leaned back to examine his face. He had a look of resignation about him, and she could not help the smile that stole across her own face. \"Rooster Cogburn was right; you are a silly old fool,\" she said. \"I already feel a 'similar fondness' for you, or else I would not have consented to marry you. Do you think I would marry for any other reason? I can get by perfectly well on my own in every other way; I have no need for a husband generally.\" LaBoeuf frowned at her. \"If you believe you have no need for a husband, I wonder that you have consented to this at all.\" Mattie paused, trying to find the right words. Everything she thought of seemed foolish and sentimental. Yet it was true, also. Could romantic words at times be pragmatic by virtue of the fact that they contained the bald truth? She steeled herself. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I consent to this because I am fond of your company, and because when I was faced with the prospect of returning home and perhaps never seeing you again, the sadness such thoughts placed in my heart would not be dislodged. That is, I mean to say that I love you already, and you will not have to wait any length of time for me to become fond of you.\" \"All right, then,\" he said, his eyes soft as he regarded her. He reached up and brushed a loose strand of hair out of her eyes. \"I would like very much if you would call me by the name my family most often uses for me, now that we are to be married.\" \"Which of your names is that?\" Mattie asked. \"Do your nieces and nephews call you Uncle Virgil?\" LaBoeuf exhaled a laugh. \"Virgil is my first given name, but it belonged to my father's brother, and so I was always called Emery from when I was small.\" \"Then you would like for me to call you Emery?\" \"I would, yes.\" \"All right. Emery.\" His cheeks reddened, and he cleared his throat before taking her hand in both of his. \"It is silly to be so pleased, but there is nothing for it. May I beg a kiss of you?\" he said. Mattie felt her face heat. He was so stiff and formal; the boys at home tended to thrust a kiss upon you whether you wanted one or not. Indeed, he had been guilty of such behaviour himself. \"You are not going to simply steal a kiss?\" Mattie asked. \"You have already stolen more than one from me.\" LaBoeuf had the decency to look chagrined. \"I thought perhaps things might go easier for me if I asked rather than took.\" \"That was wise of you,\" Mattie replied. She took a step closer to him. \"You may have a kiss, if you like.\" As LaBoeuf leaned in to take his kiss, Mattie ducked her head and craned to land a peck on his warm, stubble-roughened cheek. \"There,\" she said, rocking back on her heels. \"Now we are very nearly square.\" LaBoeuf smiled at her, his expression delighted and surprised, and then leaned in once more, pressing a kiss to her lips. One of his arms slid around her waist, pulling her close, and the other cradled her shoulders. She rested her hand against his buckskin-covered back, and marvelled at the strange quiver which ran along every nerve of her body, leaving goose pimpled skin and a shiver in its wake. \"You are cold,\" LaBoeuf said, pulling back enough to look at her. He released her and unbuttoned his coat. \"I am not cold,\" Mattie replied. \"I am merely happy, I think.\" \"Happiness has the same effect on you as a draft,\" LaBoeuf said, his eyebrows raised. \"That is very peculiar, but then I reckon I should not be surprised.\" Mattie blushed, frowning at him. LaBoeuf held his coat open. \"Come here,\" he said. \"Then if you stop shivering I will know that you are neither cold nor happy.\" Feeling rather unlike herself, Mattie stepped forward, allowing him to envelop her in the warmth of his coat, where he held her very close. She laid her head on his chest, and again she could feel the steady beat of his heart beneath her cheek. \"Would you like to go and share the happy news with your mother?\" LaBoeuf asked. Mattie shook her head. \"I think I would like to stand here with you just a little longer, Emery.\" LaBoeuf laid his cheek against her head and tightened his arms around her. \"If that is what you would like,\" he said, \"then I will be the last man to prevent you from having your way.\" The following day passed in a haze as Mattie and her mother prepared to return home to Yell County. At breakfast, LaBoeuf explained that he expected it would take several months at least to build an adequate house on his land in El Paso. He was quite insistent that Mattie not come out to Texas until he had a \"respectable home\" for her to live in, and Mama seemed to agree. Mattie did not much care, as they had spent the majority of their acquaintance either in boarding houses or sleeping on the hard ground, but she acquiesced. It was agreed that LaBoeuf would come to Arkansas when the house was completed, and that they would marry there. As for their more immediate plans, Mattie and Mama were on the train to Arkansas the next morning, and LaBoeuf would be headed in the opposite direction in the afternoon. It all happened very fast. After breakfast, Mama discreetly took her leave, and Mattie and LaBoeuf retired to the side porch, out of the way of the comings and goings of the front of the boarding house. They sat on the bench there, and LaBoeuf smoked his pipe. There seemed to be no reason to speak, and so Mattie thought about what the coming months and weeks would hold, as well as their life together once they were married. A nervous knot began to form in her stomach as she contemplated it all. She was not one to dwell on events too far in the future to be worth worrying about. It was, after all, a waste of time and energy to fret over things which had not yet come to pass. But she could not help it. El Paso was a long way from Yell County. What did she know of life in El Paso? Could she be happy in such a place, even having LaBoeuf close by to cheer her? Could she be happy living so far away from Mama and Little Frank and Victoria? \"If we are to be married, there ought to be honesty between us,\" Mattie said, turning to look at LaBoeuf after a long silence. \"There ought to be, yes,\" LaBoeuf agreed. \"What troubles you?\" \"Although I am not one to shirk the challenges God presents me with, I admit to you now that the thought of leaving Arkansas and my family and all that is familiar and dear to me behind forever gives me pause.\" \"Forever?\" LaBoeuf's mouth gaped for a moment in an expression of disbelief. \"By God, Mattie, I do not plan to spirit you away to Texas and keep you as my prisoner! We shall visit your family as often as you like, and indeed they can visit us. It will not be long before the railroads will connect those two places, and then it will be no trouble at all. I know how dear your family is to you; I would not deprive you of their company.\" \"Oh,\" Mattie replied, suddenly feeling foolish. She frowned and looked away from him. \"I think you will like El Paso,\" he said. \"I know you are loyal to your own homeland, and that is all right, but I believe you will see that El Paso possesses fine qualities that will suit you very well. And I will do all that I can do make you at ease there, to increase your happiness.\" \"I know you will,\" Mattie said. She did not like to think of leaving him the next day, but she did not like to think of leaving Mama and her siblings behind at some moment in the future, either. Perhaps it was best not to think of it at all. They fell silent again for several moments before LaBoeuf cleared his throat. \"Cogburn warned me off you that morning, by the bank of that little creek. Do you remember? He doubted my intentions, and thought you had no interest in being pursued,\" he said, frowning. \"In earnest, I had myself convinced of the same. I do not know what changed Cogburn's mind, but by the time you recovered from the fever here, he had turned right around on the subject and was giving me all manner of unsolicited advice.\" Mattie grimaced. \"He did the same to me, just before we arrived in Texarkana the first time. He suggested I give you some 'encouragement' before your head was turned by another.\" \"Well,\" LaBoeuf guffawed, \"although I would not have resented some encouragement from you, having my head turned is unlikely, regardless of the circumstances.\" \"Is it?\" Mattie asked, turning to look at him. LaBoeuf regarded her for a moment, his eyes soft on her. When he spoke, his voice was soft as well. \"You do not doubt yourself a moment in any other matter, yet here I see you pause. You doubt the appeal you hold for me?\" Embarrassed, Mattie looked away and shrugged her shoulders. LaBoeuf picked up her hand from where it lay on the bench, at her side. He rubbed his thumb over her knuckles, gently pressing each of the fine bones of her hand as though they were piano keys. \"Doubt some other thing, Mattie,\" he said, his voice gruff. \"Do not doubt that.\" He enfolded her hand in his, and cleared his throat. \"Anyhow, Cogburn seemed to think I planned to 'fill your head with romantical ideas,' as he put it, and then skedaddle with your good reputation in my saddlebag. Rooster Cogburn, lecturing me on a lady's honour! I reckon he does not know you or me half so well as he thinks he does. But he certainly has a peculiar regard for you. He treated me as a father might treat a suitor for his daughter, in his own way.\" Mattie smiled at the picture he painted. It faded, though, as she thought of Rooster riding out for who-knew-where, just him and Whiskey Jack and whatever liquor he 'confiscated' on his way. She considered voicing her concern, but then she recalled LaBoeuf's strange remarks about her and Rooster being 'bosom friends' on the trail. She glanced at him, and then thought of what Mama had said, about a man and wife being a solace for one another. \"I worry for him,\" Mattie said finally. \"He is the most alone person I have ever encountered. He did not seem to know entirely where he was headed, or why, or how, or if there would be anyone there to greet him when he arrives. If he arrives.\" \"He provided me with an address where I might send his portion of the reward when I return to El Paso, but I do not know. It would not surprise me if he failed to collect it.\" \"If the address comes to nothing, do you think we might try to find him? I want to ensure that he receives the funds to which he is entitled, and I would like to invite him to our wedding, whenever it shall be. He ought to know he is welcome.\" LaBoeuf turned and gave her a long look, frowning slightly. \"I see his regard for you does not go unreciprocated.\" \"No, it does not,\" Mattie agreed. \"Do you mind it?\" LaBoeuf did not reply right away, continuing to look at her. Finally he cleared his throat and looked away. \"No, I suppose I do not mind it. Although I do not think he is altogether deserving of your admiration.\" Mattie smiled. \"Well, I do not know about that. But I do know that the admiration I have for Rooster Cogburn bears little resemblance to the admiration I have for you.\" That seemed to placate LaBoeuf, for his face reddened and he cleared his throat, and had soon changed the subject of conversation to the scheduling of the trains in the morning, and no more was said about Rooster Cogburn. In the afternoon, Mama and Mattie prepared for the journey home and looked after some errands in town. Mama insisted on having Mattie sit for a photographer, which in Mattie's opinion was a costly waste of time. She did not think she looked her best, either, for although her bruises had healed, she was still scrawny from being ill. But Mama would not have it another way. Supper was a quiet affair, for there were not many guests staying at the boarding house that night. After coffee with Mama and Mrs. McNabb in the parlour, Mattie stood with LaBoeuf outside as he smoked his pipe. It was curiously quiet between them. Mattie supposed that everything useful had already been said. In any case, she found she enjoyed simply being near him as the night deepened and turned cold, and their breath turned to plumes of steam in the air. When he finished his pipe he took her hand and kissed her cheek, and said it was foolish for her to be out in the cold so soon after being ill. They went inside, and everyone retired to bed. Nothing was said about their parting the next day, and Mattie was glad. To anticipate the pain of leaving his side was akin to wallowing in it, and that was not something Mattie would do. In the morning, Mattie and Mama said their goodbyes to Mrs. McNabb, and then they all travelled to the train depot together. Mrs. McNabb's stable boy had gone ahead with the horses, and LaBoeuf looked after Mattie's luggage as well as Mama's. They did not have much in the way of baggage and could have managed themselves, but LaBoeuf was insistent, and said he did not mind. When they arrived on the platform, a porter whisked it all away, and Mama delicately said that she would leave them, and disappeared down the length of the great iron machine to find their seats. \"Here,\" LaBoeuf said, reaching into his pocket and placing two small packages in the palm of Mattie's hand. They were wrapped in crisp brown paper. \"It is not appropriate for a man to give gifts to an unmarried young woman,\" Mattie murmured, eyeing the contents of her hand speculatively. \"Under the circumstances, I think some minor adjustments to courtship rituals are all right,\" he replied. He pointed at the smaller of the two packages. \"Open that one first, if you please.\" Handing him back the other package, Mattie used her thumb to work the brown paper aside. Small, finicky jobs were the hardest to manage with only one hand, but she did not want to call attention to it by requesting his assistance. The paper fell away, and in her palm was left a silver-plated thimble with wee filigreed thistles around the base of the cup. \"I gather that, these days, some fashionable young men will bestow a gold ring on their intended as a token of their engagement, but as I am neither fashionable nor young, I hoped you might not expect such a thing from me, and would not mind a more traditional conveyance of my intentions,\" LaBoeuf explained. His voice was gruff, and he looked away from her, out over the milling crowds on the platform. Mattie did not know what to say. She had never received such a gift before. It was simple and practical, and its beauty and worth lay in those qualities. She knew that every time she held it or used it, or even spied it on her bureau, she would think of him. Swallowing, she shook her head. She still did not know how to graciously accept a compliment. But then, LaBoeuf knew that about her already, and much better than most. \"I do not know what to say,\" Mattie said earnestly, looking up at him. \"I wish I had a poetic spirit so that I might adequately express myself to you, but my oratorical skills lay more in the region of the pragmatic. So I will say simply that it is a lovely thing, and that I will cherish it always.\" Although his expression remained serious, Mattie could tell that he was pleased. He went all red in the cheeks and cleared his throat. He returned the second package to her. \"The frivolity of this gift will, I hope, make amends for the lack of it in the other.\" Mattie worked the second package open, and discovered two silver-plated combs, each one about the size of her thumb from knuckle to fingertip. On the end of each was a posey of delicate filigreed flowers. \"I am told that the flowers are forget-me-nots, but I do not know,\" LaBoeuf said. Mattie turned the little combs over in her palm. She never expected to have such fine things to call her own, and she certainly did not expect a man to buy them for her. The delight she felt was foreign, and almost certainly wicked. \"Forget-me-nots are said to signify true love,\" Mattie mused, glancing up at him. \"Do they? Well,\" he replied. His eyes were steady on hers, and his tone implied that he knew that already. Mattie blushed and looked away. \"Would you like me to put them in your hair?\" \"Oh, no!\" she replied, closing her fingers protectively over her treasures. \"I want them right where I can see them for the journey home. You never know what kind of riff-raff you will encounter on a long train ride.\" LaBoeuf huffed out a short kind of laugh and smiled at her. \"As you wish.\" \"I have something for you, as well,\" Mattie said, remembering the tintype tucked in the inner pocket of her coat. She placed his gifts safely there and extracted the photograph, handing it to LaBoeuf in its neat black paper sleeve. He removed the photograph and examined it, his expression revealing nothing to her. Abruptly she felt foolish. \"It was Mama's notion to have it taken,\" Mattie said, looking out over the platform at the other travellers who were milling about. \"As for myself I think it rather silly.\" LaBoeuf's gaze met hers, his blue eyes bright in the afternoon sun. She could feel the heat rise in her face, and it only served to embarrass her further. \"It is not silly. It is not silly in the least. I will keep it with me always,\" he said. His voice was gruff, and he cleared his throat. He seemed about to say something more, but was interrupted by Mama's voice calling her from down the platform. \"Mattie!\" Mattie looked over her shoulder and saw her mother waving to her, a hesitant and careworn expression on her face, visible even from a distance. \"It seems the train is boarding,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Do you have everything you will require for your journey?\" \"Yes. My only concern is for Alma. She has never been on a train before.\" \"Would you like me to speak to the porter?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"No, that is all right. While you were dealing with the luggage, I told the ticket agent and the conductor that Alma is to arrive in the same condition in which I left her in their care, or the railroad will be in my debt for her full value,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf's whiskers twitched as though he were trying to hold back a smile. \"I ought to have known that you would already have seen to it.\" The engineer blew the whistle then, and the train gave a great groan and released a plume of steam into the air. \"All right, then,\" LaBoeuf said, the smile dropping from his face. He reached down and took Mattie's hand in his, and began walking down the platform to where Mama waited. \"You will write to me, will you not? You need not be concerned that frequent letters are any kind of exceptional burden, for our mail service is good enough. You need not even await a reply – send as many letters as you like.\" \"I will write to you,\" Mattie replied. \"Good,\" he said as they came to a stop in front of Mama. \"I am terribly sorry, but the porter has told me that we will be departing very shortly,\" Mama said, her tone fretful. \"It is all right, Mama. Go find your seat and I will join you,\" Mattie replied. \"Goodbye, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mama said. LaBoeuf helped her onto the train with his free hand, and she favoured him with a warm smile before disappearing into the great iron beast. \"Would you like me to see you onto the train?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"No. I will find my seat all right,\" Mattie replied. They stood watching each other a moment, neither knowing what to say. The train let out a shrill whistle, and the porter leaned his head out of the train and informed Mattie that she must board. LaBoeuf frowned. His hand grasped her elbow and pulled her close, the other cupping the nape of her neck. He leaned his forehead against hers for a moment, and then said, \"Troublesome woman. I shall miss you, I fear, but I will build that house as quickly as I am able.\" \"I know you will,\" Mattie replied. She breathed in the tobacco and buckskin and fresh air scent of him, and swallowed. He pressed a scratchy kiss to her temple, and released her. \"Go on now,\" he said. Mattie turned from him, not wanting to meet his eyes. She felt the gentle press of his hand when he briefly touched the small of her back as she boarded the train. Inside the compartment, she saw Mama and went to her. Mama moved aside and let Mattie have the seat nearest the window. Although Mattie knew she would see LaBoeuf again, her heart was heavy at the sight of him standing alone on the platform, eyeing the train with a frown on his face. It was bearable, but when the train shuddered and gave a lurch as it began to pull out of the station, she felt tears prick at her eyes. She pressed her palm against the sooty window, and she knew he saw it, for his shoulders drooped and gave a little shake of his head. The train lurched again and began to pull away, and LaBoeuf took two steps forward and laid his hand on the window for the briefest of moments before removing it as the train gathered speed. They would have been touching if not for the glass. Mattie craned her head and watched him standing there on the edge of the platform with his hand still raised in farewell, until the train rounded a curve and he disappeared.[Chapter 13] Whoa. I was not expecting this last chapter to be so difficult to write. I've been struggling with major writer's block for the last six months, and this fic has been the primary victim. I apologise that it's taken this long to get the final chapter out. I hope some of you are still reading. Thank you so much for the messages of encouragement along the way; they buoy me up like you wouldn't believe. Thank you for reading. Your enjoyment has meant everything to me during the writing of this fic. Y'all are the absolute best. 3 Mattie returned home to Yell County. The fields were empty, the trees bare, and the sky like a steel grey canopy. She had been away from home only six weeks, yet in that time fall had departed and winter arrived to take its place. It was soon apparent that although Mama was delighted to have her home, her adventure had put Little Frank's nose out of joint. He did not need to say a word; Mattie knew her brother well enough to see that he was sore about it. Not only because he held the sort of romantic ideas about guns and outlaws that all foolish young men have and was therefore envious of her adventures, but because in her absence, he had been expected to take responsibility for farm and family, and he resented her for it. It was several weeks before he graced her with anything more than a sullen grunt when asked a question. Victoria, meanwhile, was giddy with excitement, and wanted to hear all about this Mr. LaBoeuf, whom she remembered only vaguely from his visit to Yell County years ago during his search for Tom Chaney. She asked Mattie many tiresome, silly questions about his looks and his temper, and what he said to Mattie when he asked her to be his wife. Victoria had her tell that story so many times that Mattie grew exhausted of it, and spoke sharply to her. Victoria had a tender disposition and was hurt, but Mattie could not bring herself to apologise. It would only encourage her to start in again. Mattie had been home three days when she received a telegram. She and Little Frank were in town for supplies and Mr. Smalling, who managed the post office, near ran her down in the street to deliver it. She tucked it inside her coat and read it much later that night, when she was alone in her bedroom. MATTIE ARRIVED YSLETA WEATHER IS FINE AND DRY HAULING ROCKS FROM THE RIVER FOR THE HOUSE WILL WRITE SOON YOURS SGT LABOEUF Mattie pored over the words with her eyes and her fingertips until she began to feel foolish for finding a piece of paper such a fascination. She folded the telegram in half and placed it inside the bible at her bedside before extinguishing her lamp. Lying back against her pillow, she saw a picture in her mind of LaBoeuf laying rocks out to make the foundation of the house. Their house. Such a thing still seemed downright fanciful to her, but as the weeks passed and LaBoeuf began to send her letters telling her in great detail about the progress he made on the house, her fancy took shape as a real building of stone and whitewashed clapboard. They wrote to one another as often as the speed of the postal service and their busy days would allow. Mama had Mattie and Victoria sewing from dawn to dusk all that winter, until Mattie was certain that she had enough sheets and curtains and dishtowels to outfit a whole brigade of young brides. At Christmas, Mattie wrote Rooster a letter, informing him of her engagement and asking him to visit, and received a reply three months later. He said he always knew that LaBoeuf's ranting and raving about her \"sauciness\" could not be for nothing, and that he was glad \"the stuffed-shirt dandy\" had the starch to ask for her hand after all. Last of all he said that he was pleased she said yes, for the world did not need any more \"cranky old maids\" than it already had. Mattie replied to say that she hoped he might come to Yell for the wedding, which would not be for some months yet, but she would let him know of the precise date when she was able. She received no reply. There was a foreign restlessness in Mattie that she found difficult to abide. It was nearly intolerable through the long, dark months of winter when there was little work at hand to occupy her. At times she caught herself staring off at nothing, her mind exploring the regions of memory and far-off hopeful things which may never come to be. Mattie was glad indeed when winter gave way to spring, and there was more work at hand than could be accomplished in a day. Her mind had precious little time to wander then. In July, LaBoeuf wrote her to say that a spate of twisters and summer storms had done some damage to the house, but that he had quickly made up the difference and good progress was being made once again. The roof was as good as finished, and this accomplishment would provide him with an opportunity to rest, and to take the train to Arkansas to visit her, which he hoped she would not mind. Mattie wrote back to him and said she would not mind it at all, but he only ought to come if he was certain that he could spare the time and the expense, which seemed frivolous to her. LaBoeuf responded to say that he was certainly coming, and he would arrive in the middle of August. Mama had Mattie and Victoria clean the entire house from top to bottom. Theirs was always a well-kept place, and Mattie thought they had no reason to put up a false front for LaBoeuf, but by the end of their labours she had to own that the place had never looked better. Mattie was glad for LaBoeuf to see it thus, although her gladness stopped short of pride of course. The day LaBoeuf was to arrive, Victoria brushed Mattie's hair out and pulled it back into a knot of plaits at the back of her head, and tucked Mattie's two silver-plated combs into the arrangement. Mama insisted on cleaning and pressing Mattie's best dress, which was two years old and made from dark cranberry jacquard-woven silk. Its high collar and one long sleeve made it heavy for the warm summer weather, but Mama would not be swayed. She also gave Mattie her favourite garnet earrings to wear. Once Victoria had laced her into her new whalebone corset and buttoned the dress for her, even Mattie thought the effect was handsome, although she did not say it. Little Frank hitched their cart mule Jake to the wagon and drove into town in the middle of the afternoon to fetch LaBoeuf from the train station. Mattie waited on the front porch, for it permitted a breeze and was therefore not as stifling as the parlour. She sat with her spine as straight as a fencepost, sweat pooling under her corset. She longed for a thunderstorm, or a light dress better suited to the heat, or better, a swim in the nearby fishing hole. Two hours passed in this fashion with Mattie annoyed at the pressing heat and at her own idleness, for Mama would not allow her anywhere near the kitchen while she and Victoria cooked, for fear that she would soil her dress. Finally, she spotted Jake's dark head come through the trees way down the road, doggedly pulling the cart behind him. Mattie stood and went to the porch railing, peering as the cart drew closer, the figures up on the bench becoming clear. Little Frank drove, and there beside him in all his outlandish Texas trappings sat LaBoeuf. Mattie's heart leaped into her chest for joy at the sight of him, and she nearly gave way to the urge she felt to fly down the steps and run to him. But she held fast and stood stock still on the porch, her hand gripping the railing as she watched them approach. Little Frank halted the cart in the yard, and LaBoeuf hopped off the bench with a ringing of spurs. Little Frank got down and began to lead Jake around to the barn but Mattie hardly noticed, so intent was she on LaBoeuf as he approached. He stopped at the bottom of the steps and removed his hat. Looking up at her, he nodded his head. \"Ma'am,\" he said. Mattie frowned at him and was about to ask him if he had left his wits on the train when she heard a sharp intake of breath and turned to see her mother and Victoria standing behind her. \"Oh, Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mama exclaimed as he came up the stairs. \"It is such a pleasure to see you again at last! I hope you are not altogether too exhausted from your long journey.\" LaBoeuf took Mama's hand and pressed a kiss to the back of it before doing the same for Victoria, who beamed. \"No, ma'am, I am not altogether too exhausted,\" he replied, smiling. \"The journey is long but the trains are very comfortable nowadays.\" He turned and gave Mattie a cordial nod. \"Mattie.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she responded, nodding. Mama bade them all into the house then, saying that supper was just ready and so they might as well eat right away as the food on trains is never wholesome or satisfying and so Mr. LaBoeuf must have a powerful hunger. Mattie eyed LaBoeuf as they went inside. She hardly expected him to dash up the front steps and sweep her into his arms like the romantic hero in some trash novel. She would not have wanted that. But to have scarcely a greeting for her at all seemed peculiar. Perhaps he was wary of being too familiar with her in the presence of her mother. Yet he had not shied away when they were all together in Texarkana. So what reason for his aloofness? All through supper he seemed to avoid her eyes, conversing mostly with Mama about how busy he had been with his new bail bond work in Ysleta. Mattie could not figure him. Ignoring her entirely seemed beyond the requirements of cordiality, and needlessly prudish even for LaBoeuf. Why would he not look at her? Had something happened? Had he changed his mind? Had he come here to tell her that he had been mistaken, and did not want to marry her after all? Mattie hardly swallowed a bite, so anxious was she, and so intent on silently cursing him did she become. After the meal, Mama suggested – with a sly smile in Mattie's direction – that they take a walk so LaBoeuf might see the cotton fields in bloom. They did so, walking across the barnyard without speaking, as the dusky twilight descended around them. The silence between them lasted so long that Mattie felt acute agony begin to tear at some place deep in her breast. It became hard to draw a breath, and her eyes stung. She did not know what to think of this awkwardness between them, nor did she know what she might have done to cause it, nor what she might do to repair it. It bewildered her entirely. They walked up the path that went past the barn, towards the paddocks where the horses grazed in the cool summer gloaming. As they passed the rear door to the barn, LaBoeuf paused and looked back at the house. Suddenly he grabbed her hand and pulled her after him into the barn, and before she knew what was happening, he had tumbled her back into a heap of hay which Little Frank had pitched down from the hayloft that morning. LaBoeuf lay right on top of her, and his hat was tipped back on his head so that he looked a complete fool. He grinned that smug grin of his, and Mattie wanted to smack him. \"Hidy,\" he said and, without waiting for her reply, dropped his head and kissed her soundly on the mouth, his whiskers scratching her. \"You are a scoundrel!\" she scolded the moment he paused long enough for her to catch her breath. \"You had me thinking... Well, never mind what you had me thinking! I ought to box your ears.\" \"I apologise,\" he replied, not looking the least bit sorry. \"Would it help you know that I think you look very lovely tonight?\" Mattie glowered at him. She had never known him to be playful or deliberately silly in this way, and she found it rather alarming. \"I have missed you,\" he said. \"Your letters were a source of great delight to me, but as they contained more news of the well-being of your crops and your ledger, and less of the degree of your longing for my company, I must say they do not compare to being at your side.\" Embarrassed, Mattie could feel her cheeks redden, and she frowned and let her gaze slide away from his. \"Ah! I did not know whether any delicate feminine modesty lived in you, but there is my answer.\" Mattie's frown deepened. \"It is not 'delicate feminine modesty.' I am merely suspicious of grandiose flattery.\" \"Is it grandiose flattery to say that I missed you? You grow stingier with your sugar all the time. But you will simply have to accept that on occasion I will like to say that I enjoy your company and am very fond of you.\" He regarded her expectantly, a smile quirking his mouth. \"Have you no similar endearment for me, or has my behaviour today shut me out of your affections indefinitely?\" \"Your behaviour today has made me wonder whether I ought to commit you to an asylum for the mentally deranged rather than marry you,\" Mattie sniffed. \"Ah, but I see that marriage is still a card on the table. That is a great relief to me,\" LaBoeuf replied. He leaned his weight off of her, propping himself up on one elbow. \"How do you do, Miss Mattie Modesty?\" Mattie shifted, trying to put some space between them. The closeness of him after so many months apart was making her feel rather silly. \"I do very fine, when I am not being harangued by presumptuous popinjays with sawdust for brains.\" LaBoeuf smiled at her. It seemed her sharp words no longer affected him, or that they had some opposite, unintended effect. He lifted his free hand and brushed his thumb against her eyebrow before resting it beneath her eye and cupping her cheek in his palm. \"When I say I missed you, it is not flattery. It is God's honest truth,\" he said. \"But I see you are put out that I did not favour you with my attention the moment I arrived. May I attempt to make amends for this transgression?\" Mattie shrugged and looked away, uninterested in his foolishness. LaBoeuf turned her face back towards his and leaned down, pressing a kiss to her cheekbone, her forehead, and her nose, before kissing her lips. He lingered there for some time, sliding an arm under her shoulders to pull her very close. When finally his embrace loosened, Mattie blinked and let her head fall back into the hay. She swallowed hard around the lump in her throat. LaBoeuf leaned his forehead against hers. \"Tell me you did miss me,\" he said, his voice low and gruff. \"I did miss you,\" Mattie whispered. She did not look away from his gaze, although she felt some strange urge to glance to the side, or cover her face. \"I should like to have you this close to me always.\" LaBoeuf closed his eyes, a pained expression crossing his face. He sighed raggedly. \"Mattie, I have something to confess to you.\" Mattie watched him closely, a measure of her earlier anxiety returning. She swallowed. \"What is it? Tell me.\" \"I promised you and your mother I would have that house finished by the end of the summer so that we could be married and I could take you back with me,\" he said, looking away from her. \"Yes, I remember, of course.\" \"The house will not be finished by the end of summer, Mattie,\" he replied. \"Oh,\" Mattie breathed. Disappointment choked her. She had hoped it would be finished in the next month, so that they might be married and be settled enough to have Christmas in their new home. But she felt certain that he had done his utmost, and so she did not want to offend him by showing her feelings. \"But the trouble is that I cannot wait for that damned house to be finished,\" he said, clasping her hand in his. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" she scolded, appalled at his language. \"I would like for the house to be finished, too, but there is hardly a need for that kind of-\" \"Mattie, marry me tomorrow. Or the day after, if you prefer. But marry me and come home with me on that train next Tuesday.\" \"Well!\" Mattie said. \"That is -\" \"Do you think your mother would object? I will speak to her. I will assure her that my room is a very fine one in a respectable boarding house, and that our house will be completed with the utmost haste, and -\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf, you are the one who made the stipulation that our house be completed before we could marry. My mother will be overjoyed, I am certain, to see me married immediately.\" \"Do you object?\" he asked earnestly. \"I understand if you do not wish to marry and go to live in a boarding house and not have all of your things around you, but-\" \"I would marry you if you had only the clothes on your back and an empty shanty on the bald prairie. However, I will deny these words should you ever repeat them to anyone.\" LaBoeuf smiled at her, looking exceedingly pleased. \"Now, why is it back to 'Mr. LaBoeuf' when in your letters you felt free to call me Emery?\" Mattie stared at him, finding herself without the means to respond. She gaped for a moment, and then swallowed, collecting herself. \"Well,\" she said, \"in my letters I found I was at liberty to – that is, it is rather different when I am looking right at you.\" LaBoeuf's smile grew wider. \"I would kiss you again, but then I fear I would want to keep you here for much longer than your mother would think appropriate.\" He got to his feet then, and Mattie felt rather foolish, left lying on her back in a heap of hay. LaBoeuf reached out his hand and took hers, drawing her to her feet. Mattie stood still as LaBoeuf brushed off the back of her skirt and picked every bit of hay from her hair. \"Your mother is a good sport,\" he said, \"but I expect even she would not like to know that we have been in this pile of hay, here.\" \"Putting it that way makes the thing sound as though you have taken liberties with me, when in truth you have enjoyed very few,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf guffawed. \"That is the truth, and if your mother suspects anything, that is what I will tell her. She knows you well, so she will believe me.\" Mattie felt herself blush, and said nothing, a smile playing about her mouth. When LaBoeuf was satisfied that she looked presentable once again, he took her hand in his. \"Tell me truly – do you mind it if we marry now and return to Texas, to an unfinished house?\" \"Have I said that I mind it?\" Mattie asked. \"You have not,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"And have you ever known me to lie, or to play false to protect a man's pride?\" LaBoeuf's whiskers twitched, and he shook his head. \"That I have certainly not known you to do.\" \"Well,\" Mattie said, \"there you are. You need not worry on it a moment longer.\" \"Shall we go see what your mother thinks of it, then?\" Mattie did not reply. She merely squeezed his hand, and they walked back to the house together with hands clasped, the gloaming deepening into night all around them. They were married that Monday, two days after LaBoeuf arrived in Yell County. Mattie wore a brand new dress which her mother had made for her by a seamstress months earlier at a terrible expense. Mattie had never worn anything but homemade before, and she was almost afraid to wear it for fear of doing it some damage. It was made of dove grey satin with braided black velvet trim. The left sleeve was cut short and sewn neatly shut for her arm, and the other sleeve was cut close and darted, flattering the slenderness of her wrist and hand. It was trimmed with black braid and white lace, as was the high collar. The bodice was fitted with darts, coming to a low point at her waist, and Victoria had to lace her tightly into her new whalebone corset so the dress would fall properly. The overskirt dropped straight from her waist and gathered over a modest bustle in the back. The rest of the skirt fell to the floor with a row of small flounces which Victoria declared \"very fashionable.\" Mattie did not know whether the dress was fashionable, not having an interest in such things. She only knew that it was very beautiful and fine, and that it looked like a dress that could not possibly belong to her. They were married in town, in the church her father had helped to build many years earlier when he was only a young man. Little Frank drove them there in the cart, all of them in their Sunday best. LaBoeuf was staying at the hotel in town, and walked to the church to meet them. Mattie stood waiting in the vestibule with Mama while a handful of neighbours and friends of Mama's filed into the church, most greeting Mattie with curious looks that bordered on insulting. When LaBoeuf arrived, he did so with little announcement, for he did not wear his spurs with the big noisy rowels. Instead he was dressed in a smart brown suit and a hat with a brim so modest it looked peculiar on him. He greeted Mama and apologised for being late. Mama assured him that it was no matter, and said she would go in to make sure all was ready. She disappeared into the chapel proper, leaving them alone. LaBoeuf cleared his throat, and looked her up and down like he was buying a horse. \"Well,\" he said. \"You look downright womanly.\" \"I am a woman,\" Mattie replied, smoothing her hand self-consciously over her skirt. \"I know.\" Uncomfortable under his unwavering gaze, Mattie tipped her chin at him. \"I did not know you owned clothing not made of buckskin and adorned with fringe. I hardly recognize you.\" LaBoeuf gave her a sour look as his cheeks reddened, and then he frowned. \"I will own that this suit is not comfortable. I do not feel like myself.\" Mattie felt sorry for him, and ceased her teasing. It was almost comical, the two of them dressed up in their fine clothes for which they felt no affinity. \"What are you smirking about, now?\" LaBoeuf asked. \"I am thinking about how silly we both are,\" she admitted. \"But you look very nice in your fine suit.\" \"You look handsome as well,\" he replied. His eyes were warm as he looked at her, and Mattie felt some ridiculous sensation clutch at her chest, making it difficult to draw a proper breath. The tightness of her corset was no help in that respect, either. Mama returned then, and bade them into the chapel. Although the ceremony was a solemn procedure and not overlong, Mattie had a difficult time concentrating on a word the preacher said. All she could do was look at LaBoeuf and ponder the smug expression he had worn the first moment she clapped eyes on him, and its difference from the serious look which dressed his face now. He looked like an anxious boy. It was over quickly, Mattie hardly able to absorb the solemn vows she promised before the preacher concluded the thing and pronounced them married. LaBoeuf kissed her once, quickly, taking her hand in his. LaBoeuf signed the register first, then watched as Mattie signed. He reached over her shoulder and held the book in place with his left hand while Mattie carefully wrote her name with her right. \"Mattie Emmeline Ross LaBoeuf,\" he read aloud when she had finished and stood. He glanced at her. \"How do you like that?\" \"I like it all right,\" she replied, and LaBoeuf smiled, and said no more. They went back to the farm then for a luncheon to which several neighbours had been invited. Many more came than Mattie expected. She supposed they came to see whether it was true that Mattie Ross was well and truly a married woman, or whether folks in town had been telling tall tales again. All who came brought food with them, cold fried chicken and biscuits and pickles and tongue sandwiches. There was lemonade and sweet tea from the ice house. A neighbour, Oakley Batchelor, who had been friends with Mattie's father, brought watermelons so ripe their rinds split open in the hot sun with a sound like a piece of muslin being torn in half. They ate at tables set outside in the shade of the house, and Mattie was glad that it was a mild day with a breeze, for otherwise the heat would have made her dress intolerable. Everyone idled there for hours, eating and sharing news in leisure. Mattie supposed it was all right, although it was a Monday, and no day for resting. She sat by Victoria, who stuck much closer to her than was comfortable in the heat. But Mattie allowed it. Soon, they would not be close anymore, nor ever again. Not like when they were girls. Night fell, and fireflies began to gather from the fishing hole to fly dozily around everyone's heads. The small children began to fall asleep in their mothers' laps, and the older children shuffled restlessly. The party was over. LaBoeuf had had their tickets changed, so that instead of returning to El Paso, they were to venture south to Pineville. Mattie was to be introduced to LaBoeuf's family. He told her he had written them all about her months ago and they were most anxious to meet her. Mattie looked forward to the trip, for she had never been to Louisiana, and was curious about a place that could produce such a person as her Mr. LaBoeuf. They were to leave in the morning, first thing. When the guests had all driven off in wagons and carts or sleepily on foot, Mattie helped Mama and Victoria clean up while LaBoeuf showed Little Frank how to whittle a wooden pipe out on the porch. It did not take long to tidy the place, and soon everything was as it had been. Standing in the kitchen, Mama sighed and glanced at Mattie. \"I think I will say goodbye to you here,\" she said, her voice wavering, \"so that you may get off to Louisiana in good spirits in the morning. You know I cannot manage a gracious farewell.\" \"I know, Mama,\" Mattie replied. Victoria began to cry, and attempted to say some sort of farewell of her own to Mattie, but she was impossible to understand, and so Mattie simply pulled her close and allowed her little sister to cling to her for a few minutes more. A few of the hands had stayed up to say their goodbyes out on the porch, including old Yarnell. He shook her hand and LaBoeuf's, and said he reckoned any man who would take a stubborn, bossing thing like her on had to be crazier than a bag of cats, but good luck anyway. Little Frank had the cart ready, then, and they made ready to depart. LaBoeuf sat up on the bench with her brother, and Mattie sat in the back with all of her bags and her trunk full of new sheets and dishtowels, as well as the wedding gifts they had received. The cart pulled out of the yard, and Mattie raised a hand to wave to Mama and Victoria, who stood together on the porch. Victoria sobbed so loudly it carried across the yard, and then she buried her face in Mama's shoulder. Mattie dropped her hand to her lap and looked away, biting her lip. There was no need to be foolish about such things. The ride back into town was long, and it passed almost entirely in silence except for the sound of the frogs croaking in the marshy ditches. Little Frank dropped them at the hotel, and helped LaBoeuf unload Mattie's things onto the wide clapboard porch, where a sleepy-looking young desk clerk from the hotel with hair the colour of bright fresh straw collected them, and whisked them away upstairs. \"Well,\" Little Frank said, when they had finished. \"Well,\" Mattie replied, looking at her little brother. \"So long, then,\" he said. He stuck a hand out. \"So long,\" she repeated, taking his hand and giving it a firm squeeze. Abruptly, Little Frank yanked her forward and gave her a firm clap on the back with his free hand. \"Don't give him too hard a time, you ugly old badger.\" With a grin, he pulled away from her and leaped off the top step of the porch, nearly spooking poor old Jake. He clambered up onto the bench and chirruped to the mule, who took off at a speedy trot. \"Are all young men such baboons?\" Mattie asked LaBoeuf, who stood by her side, looking after her brother somewhat disapprovingly. \"I'm afraid they are,\" he said, removing his hat. \"I suppose you will only be wanting girl children.\" Mattie wrinkled her nose. \"Girls are no better. They are only another kind of foolish.\" LaBoeuf gave a sharp bark of laughter, and they went inside and found their way to his room. \"It seems wasteful to spend the night in a hotel,\" Mattie said once they were inside and LaBoeuf was bent over lighting the lamp. LaBoeuf did not look up at her, or reply right away. After a moment, he cleared his throat. \"You do not wish to be alone with me the first night that we are man and wife?\" \"I did not say that. I said only that the expense of a hotel seems extravagant when we might have stayed at the farm before catching our train tomorrow.\" Again, LaBoeuf was quiet a moment before he spoke. \"I thought you might prefer privacy tonight.\" Mattie looked at him, turned away from her, and in the bend of his shoulders saw that she might wound him in some invisible place if she said the wrong thing. \"It is not that I do not want to be alone with you,\" she said, sitting down on the edge of the bed. \"I am only concerned about unnecessary expenses when we still have a house to finish. That is all.\" LaBoeuf turned and carried the lamp to the bedside table. He set it there and stared at it for a long moment before turning to look at her. \"I do not know what your mother has... That is to say, if you are tired and would simply like to go to sleep tonight, I will abide by your desire,\" he said, looking distinctly uncomfortable. Mattie kept her gaze fixed on his, not wanting him to think her frightened of him. \"That is not necessary,\" she said. A long silence passed between them, broken only when Mattie cleared her throat. \"Will this be the first time you have done this?\" she asked. LaBoeuf looked at her, a dour and conflicted expression on his face. Mattie could tell he was considering a fib. \"I only wish to know whether you know what you are doing. One of us ought to. I would rather you give me the truth even if you think I will not like it.\" \"I know what I am doing,\" he said slowly, his eyes not leaving hers. \"I am older than you are, and it is different for a man.\" \"I will own that is all true enough,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf frowned and looked away from her, scratching his chin thoughtfully with his thumb. After a moment, he cleared his throat. \"If you are angry with me, I understand. I will not touch you if you are angry with me,\" he said, catching her gaze once more. \"But Mattie, I wish for you to know that I am no philanderer. I have vowed a duty and a loyalty to you which is sacred. I will never stray from your side in this lifetime or the next.\" \"All right,\" Mattie replied. LaBoeuf looked unconvinced. \"I am not angry with you. I only want to know the truth; I do not wish to be coddled. That is all I ever want.\" LaBoeuf nodded. He regarded her with hesitation a moment longer, and then came to sit beside her on the bed. He kissed her then, his whiskers scratching her face. He kissed her and pulled her close, his hands on her waist. He kissed her face and her jaw, her ears and down her neck, pushing her high collar aside. Mattie was still, unsure where to put her hand as he pushed her gently back against the pillows. It was a strange and foreign thing, and at times Mattie felt the pain and the embarrassment Mama had warned her of in vague whispers, but at times she felt also a curious euphoria, a surge of affection and joy that her body and her heart had never known before. Later, in the still darkness, Mattie looked up at the beadboard ceiling and listened to the sound of LaBoeuf's breathing deepen. She supposed most women found such a thing foreign on their wedding nights, but she did not. She had slept near him too many times already to be bothered by it. Mattie thought of the strange series of serendipitous events that had brought them together in this place, and she wondered what hand God had lifted to push them one way or push them another. Perhaps God had not lifted a hand at all. Perhaps they were only in this place because the world is filled with wickedness, and because both of them saw in that world a set of scales in need of balancing, by whoever was willing to see it done. \"Have you ever killed a man?\" Mattie asked, her voice seeming unusually loud after the extended silence. LaBoeuf did not answer right away, and Mattie supposed him to be asleep. \"You know I have,\" he said softly, after a moment. \"Lucky Ned Pepper. Although I am given to understand that Cogburn winged him first.\" \"Yes, but had you ever killed a man before that?\" she asked. \"I had, yes, during the war and in the commission of my duties as a Ranger,\" he replied. Mattie could feel him looking at her, trying to discern her expression in the dark. \"Does that upset you?\" Mattie might have mocked the idea that he still thought her delicate somehow, but her mind was occupied elsewhere. \"No,\" she replied. \"No, it is not that. Rather, it is merely... That is, do you find that you sometimes dream of them, the men you have killed?\" \"No,\" LaBoeuf said, sounding somewhat bewildered. \"No, I do not. Do you?\" A lie presented itself to Mattie, and she turned it over in her hand, considering it. She threw it aside. \"Yes,\" she said. \"Yes, at times I do. At times I have dreamt that it is still winter, and that I am alone on that mountaintop with Tom Chaney. At times I have dreamt that I am in those dark woods with Albert Cunningham once more, and that I am not quick enough and do not get his knife before he takes it and –\" \" Mattie ,\" LaBoeuf whispered. His tone was of the type one uses to calm a spooked horse, and all at once Mattie felt ashamed of her fear, and wished desperately that she had not said anything, and that she could turn from him. \"It is nothing,\" she said. \"I am only tired from the excitement of the day.\" There was silence for a moment, and then Mattie felt LaBoeuf's hand brush the side of her face. She looked towards him, trying to see his face in the dark. She could not. \"Do not dream of such things tonight,\" he said. He reached for her then, drawing her close to him. Mattie let herself be drawn, and said nothing, marvelling to herself that a man who had once taken a switch to her leg in order to humble her now thought her so mighty that she was above the tolls life exacts, that she had power even over the content of her dreams. The following morning, Mattie left the little town of Dardanelle, Arkansas behind. A man from the hotel hauled their baggage to the train depot, and Mattie and LaBoeuf followed once they had eaten a simple breakfast of eggs and grits, and hot black coffee for LaBoeuf. Their train was the first to leave that morning, and they were among the first on it, seated side by side on the wooden bench seat, polished to a bright yellow shine. They watched as the railroad people ran about the platform, readying the train for departure. More passengers boarded, and soon enough the engines roared to life and it let out a long whistle. The train gave a lurch, and pulled away from the platform. \"I would like to get you a good riding horse when we return to Texas,\" LaBoeuf said in a tone that implied he had given this idea a great deal of consideration. \"Perhaps a gelding. I would like to give you that as a wedding gift.\" \"I am not much for horses,\" Mattie replied, pulling her gaze from its last glimpse of her old town to look at her new husband. LaBoeuf gave her a look of disbelief. \"You say you are not much for horses?\" \"They are useful creatures, but I am not the kind of girl who is silly about them, is what I mean to say.\" \"Hm,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Not even Alma, who you are leaving behind you now in Arkansas, who you may not ever ride or even see again, given her age? Your old trail pard, who was your most steadfast companion in your pursuit of the scoundrel Cunningham?\" Mattie looked down as she felt her throat tighten. She had gone out to the barn the previous afternoon to bring Alma two apples, and to say goodbye. She had not thought anyone had seen her going about such a softheaded errand, but now she feared LaBoeuf had. \"If you do not care a bit for horses, I can get you some other gift,\" LaBoeuf suggested. \"A cat, perhaps.\" Mattie turned and scowled at him. \"You are not anywhere near so clever as you would like to think you are. I will take the horse.\" LaBoeuf was grinning that cocky grin at her, but he said nothing more. \"You do not mind your wife riding all over the county, making a spectacle of herself?\" Mattie asked, after a time. LaBoeuf gave her a sly look. \"I do not mind so long as you do not do anything so dangerous as attempt to ride through a plum thicket. Besides, I am entrusting the pecan grove to you. How else are you to get about and oversee the place but on a horse? The grove is not small. The heat would exhaust you, were you to walk the place.\" Mattie stifled the smile that arose at his words. \"A little heat does not bother me. Yell County is hardly the frozen tundra.\" \"You may change your tune once you have spent a summer in El Paso,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"There is nothing little about our heat.\" \"We will see what tune I sing at the end of summer, then.\" \"We will,\" LaBoeuf agreed, smiling. \"So it does not trouble you,\" Mattie said, eyeing him shrewdly, \"that your neighbours in El Paso will think it strange, you having a wife who oversees your pecan grove and occupies herself with business and other mannish things?\" LaBoeuf gave her an arch look. \"You overestimate the value I place on the opinions of my neighbours. I know you will not believe it, but I am not one to court others' favour. And what my wife does to occupy herself is no one's concern but hers and my own.\" \"I do not believe it, but I suppose we will have to wait and see about that as well,\" Mattie replied. After a moment she sighed and continued, teasing. \"I do not know how to be a wife. I have never been one before, you see.\" \"I do not know how to be a husband, although I have certainly had some theories on the subject conveyed to me,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"Oh, indeed?\" \"Indeed. Cogburn and I had a series of very illuminating discussions surrounding his views on the state of matrimony.\" Mattie grimaced at the thought and did not ask about Rooster's views on the state of matrimony, being familiar enough with them already. She looked down at her lap. The cut bottom of her thimble still looked and felt foreign on her finger. LaBoeuf had cut the thimble into a ring himself the night before with the aid of some borrowed blacksmithing tool Mattie did not know the name of. \"Hm,\" LaBoeuf sighed. Mattie glanced up to find him also examining her hand. \"Would you rather have a gold ring? I understand that is the thing nowadays. If it would please you, I will get you one.\" \"No!\" Mattie protested. \"I would rather have my thimble than every gold ring in the state of Texas.\" \"All right.\" Silence fell between them as the train rocked gently on its tracks and the piney vistas began to give way to a flatter, balder landscape outside their window. Mattie wondered if Louisiana would be how she had seen in etchings and illustrations – dark swampland and trees hung with swaths of Spanish moss. She wondered if the western parts of Texas would be the way LaBoeuf had described them, or if they would be more the distasteful place of Rooster's recollections. She would have to discover it all for herself. Whatever it was, she hoped that it would be agreeable, and that she would not be too homesick. \"Well!\" Mattie sighed and shifted in her seat as she thought of all the unknown things to come. Her chest felt buoyant and she fought the alarming urge to giggle although nothing amusing had transpired. \"Well,\" LaBoeuf repeated. He regarded her, and there was a twinkle in his eye. \"There is nothing for it. We will have to go full bore and negotiate the trail as it comes to us, pard.\" \"I will concede that you are right about that, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" The twinkle became a smile, and Mattie felt the buoyant sensation increase until she thought she might burst if she did not at least smile back. So she did. \"Thank you, Mrs. LaBoeuf.\" Mattie felt him clasp her hand in his, giving her a gentle squeeze. She laced her fingers with his and squeezed back, and did not let go. ","Summary":" I thought I had gotten True Grit (and particularly Mattie/LaBoeuf) out of my system with my last fi"},{"Movie":"True Grit, 2010","Title":"By This We Know Love","Author":"Lily Ophelia","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/6692849","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Chapter One In her delirium, Mattie was having a nightmare that she was being chased. She was riding Little Blackie as fast as he could go, pain, and the fear of their pursuer driving them forward. \"C'mon Little Blackie,\" she whispered into the panting horse's ear. \"C'mon.\" A few times she was brought out of the nightmare to realize that she lay inside a dark cabin smelling of smoke and stale sweat. Once she thought she caught sight of Cogburn's face, but before she could really be sure, she slipped back into the darkness of her mind, and she was standing beside her horse as he lay on the snow covered prairie, frothing at the mouth in exhaustion. Their pursuer got off his horse and walked towards them. She put her arms out as if to push him away, but it did no good. The figure approached, his Stetson hiding his face. He took out his gun and fired a bullet into the head of Little Blackie. The man looked up and she saw the face of Rooster Cogburn, his one eye crinkled with weariness. \"Mr. Cogburn!\" she cried, but no sound came out. He suddenly strode towards her, his face melting into that of Tom Chaney. Fear washed across her, and she tried to back away. Her legs wouldn't listen to her. \"No!\" she cried. \"No!\" He was almost upon her when sleep took pity on her and she woke up. \"No!\" she gasped out, lurching upright in bed into the arms of a man wearing a buckskin coat. His smell of leather and sweat was familiar, and his grip gentle. As she lay against his chest, panting from her exertions, she realized that she was in a great deal of pain. Startled, it brought her out of the last cloying fingers of sleep. She ripped herself away from the man she leaned against, and looked up into the soft green eyes of LaBoeuf. \"Miss Ross,\" he began softly, but Mattie spared him only a glance as she looked down at her left arm. But where her left arm should have been there was nothing below the elbow. The sleeve of her nightgown was empty, and there was no hand resting on the bed. Not believing her eyes, she thought she might still be in the nightmare. \"Mattie.\" LaBoeuf was saying her name. \"Mattie.\" But Mattie could only stare at her empty sleeve, her heart pounding with the throb of pain in the hand and arm she could still feel, but was not there. Gritting her teeth against the pain, she looked back up at LaBoeuf, her mouth pinched into a straight line. \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said steadily. \"My arm is gone.\" \"It was the snake bite.\" LaBoeuf replied easily, though there was a tension in his voice that betrayed his anxiety. \"Cogburn saved your life. Without him, you would not be alive.\" \"It hurts,\" she grimaced. \"And I can still feel my hand.\" \"That is what those who have had limbs removed say. That they still feel it, long after it has been removed.\" She stared at him. It was absurd that she should now have only one arm, and even more absurd that she should still feel the one that was absent. LaBoeuf's own arm was in a sling, due to his shoulder being shot through by Rooster Cogburn. \"How did you arrive at Bagby's?\" Mattie asked wearily, looking around the small cabin. \"And where is Mr. Cogburn?\" This time LaBoeuf would not look at her. Instead he rose, and went to the small fire in the corner of the room. He picked up a wooden spoon and stirred the pot that was cooking over the flame. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked, pointedly ignoring her question. \"I made gruel.\" \"No,\" Mattie replied, impatiently. \"But you are not answering me. Where is Rooster Cogburn?\" LaBoeuf left the fire and went over to a table where he picked up a small tin cup and poured her a cup of water. Only after he handed it to her and sat down next to her bed, did he look up. When she met his eyes, she realized that Mr. Cogburn was gone. Gone and most likely not coming back. \"He has left, hasn't he,\" she stated, . \"Mr. Cogburn left yesterday morning with no explanation. I do not know where he has gone,\" LaBoeuf replied with a sigh. \"He sent Bagby after me, and here I am, charged with returning you to your mother. As soon as you are able, I will send you on the train back to Arkansas.\" The anger that had been building up inside her, along with the pain and exhaustion she felt threatened to overwhelm her. She suddenly felt like a little girl again, and definitely not one with \"true grit.\" Fighting back the tears welling up in her eyes, she lay back down, and covered her face with her right arm. She did not want LaBoeuf to see her cry. \"My arm is in great pain,\" she said, trying to keep the tears out of her voice. \"I will sleep now.\" She pulled the patchwork quilt over her head, and let the silent tears fall on the place where her left arms should have been until she fell into a blissful sleep where no nightmares plagued her, and her body still whole and unmarred by pain. The next time she woke up, LaBoeuf was crouched at the fire stirring a pot of gruel. Gingerly she sat up, supporting herself on her right arm. Her arm was throbbing less, and she felt in great need of a bath. Her movement must have been heard by LaBoeuf, because he spoke to her without turning around. \"Are you hungry?\" he asked. \"Yes. May I ask where we are, Mr. LaBoeuf? I was under the impression we were at Bagby's Outpost, but I have not seen another soul but you since I woke up.\" \"We are still at Bagby's,\" LaBoeuf replied, spooning gruel into a small tin bowl. \"He has been kind enough to lend you his bed. He is staying at the trading post until you are well enough to leave.\" \"I see,\" Mattie said. \"Then I must thank him for his hospitality before we leave.\" In silence LaBoeuf brought the gruel over to her, holding it out for her to take. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I have one arm,\" she said flatly. \"Pardon me\" LaBoeuf said quickly, a dull flush blooming around his neck. \"I am not used to taking care of others.\" He sat down, took a spoonful of gruel, and blew on it. As he performed these actions, she observed him: his face was tanned and weather-beaten, and his green eyes crinkled around the edges. She could also see the yellow bruising around his face from when he was dragged around by Ned Pepper and his gang. He looked mostly the same, though there was a weariness to him that had not existed before they had set out to find Tom Chaney. Still watching him, she took the mouthful of the gruel he held out to her. It was hot and tasted good, which somehow surprised her. She had not thought LaBoeuf would have known how to cook well. \"Do you not have family, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked, curious to what his answer might be. \"No, I do not,\" LaBoeuf replied. \"As a Ranger, I do not have the time to take on a wife.\" He said this as if it did not concern him, but Mattie could detect wistfulness in his tone that she was sure he was not even aware of. \"And how are you,\" she said suddenly. \"Your shoulder is healing? And what of your tongue?\" LaBoeuf's face reddened slightly under his tan. It was obvious the incident still galled him. \"My shoulder will heal soon, as will my tongue,\" he admitted. \"At least that's what the doctor tells me.\" Mattie nodded. \"That is good. I am glad you will not be burdened with that awful lisp for the rest of your life.\" For a moment LaBoeuf looked as though he would give a scathing retort, but one glance at the empty sleeve attached to Mattie's left shoulder seemed to change his mind. \"I have to go feed the horses.\" He said getting to his feet. \"You are well enough that we will leave soon. I need to return to Texas to inform the Rangers of Chaney's death. They might be surprised to hear that the one who took his life was a fourteen year old girl.\" \"I am sorry about the loss of your reward,\" she said stubbornly raising her chin in the air, \"but I do not regret that I shot him.\" \"Neither do I,\" LaBoeuf said pointedly, and putting on his hat opened the door. \"I will be back before supper.\" They left Indian Territory less than a week later. LaBoeuf had purchased two horses for their ride to Fort Smith and enough supplies for one night. Mattie was standing next to her horse wearing a red wool dress that was slightly too big for her, and her father's coat. Her pain had dulled to an ache, but she still tired easily, and she was having a difficult time adjusting to not being able to do everything for herself. LaBoeuf fed her and one of the Choctaw girls helped her to bathe, dress, and braid her hair. She also needed help cleaning her wound from the amputation. For someone used to being independent and taking care of others, it was maddening. As she waited for LaBoeuf to finish packing the saddlebags, her thoughts turned to Little Blackie. Her heart ached as she recalled his foaming mouth and heaving chest in the last moments of his life. He had saved her life, but had paid for it with his own. She rested her head against the chestnut colored mane of her mare, inhaling the smell horse and leather. It was comforting and she barely noticed when LaBoeuf approached her. \"It is time to depart,\" he said, placing a canteen of water in her saddlebag. His bruises had nearly gone, and though he still spoke with a slight lisp, a sparkle had returned to his eyes. This made Mattie pleased, though couldn't figure for the life of her why. Nodding, she turned to her horse, reins in hand. Then the realization that she would not be able to mount washed over her in a wave of confused frustration. She loathed asking for LaBoeuf's help, but she couldn't see any way around it. Just as she opened her mouth to speak, she felt his presence close behind her accompanied by the warm leather smell that she had come to associate him with. Then his hands were gripping her waist and he was lifting her into the saddle. \"Oh!\" she let out in surprise. It was a completely feminine sound, and she was shocked that she had uttered it. She twisted around to look at LaBoeuf and saw that he had already left her and was mounting his own horse, She turned away to compose herself. \"I hope you can keep up,\" she said acidly, in her haste to recover. \"I don't plan staying in this God forsaken land a day longer than I have to.\" With that, she took off, leaving LaBoeuf to follow her. They arrived in Fort Smith a little more than a day after they left Bagby's Outpost. Mattie had ridden as far and long as she could until exhaustion and pain had overtaken her and she was slumped in her saddle, her chin resting on her chest. LaBoeuf had stopped the horses, and with gentle hands, removed her from the saddle. She had been briefly aware of the warmth of his chest and the strength of his arms, but had soon fallen asleep without the constant motion of the horse to wake her. The next morning they had eaten a small breakfast of salt pork and cornbread before they had started again. Mattie had waited patiently for LaBoeuf to pack the bedrolls in the saddlebags, and when he approached her, she had placed her one arm on his shoulder and let him lift her into the saddle. She had ignored the feel of his breath on her cheek and the closeness of his body, though she couldn't help but be aware of it. Her heart had beaten faster, but if he had noticed, he made no indication he had done so. By mid afternoon they had reached Fort Smith. LaBoeuf tide the horses outside the train depot and went inside to buy Mattie a ticket to Arkansas on the evening train. As the sun set, they were standing side by side on the platform waiting for the train. She heard the sound of a distant whistle, and soon the train was pulling into the station. She reached down to pick up her suitcase, only to find that LaBoeuf had gotten there first and was already striding towards the train. \"Seven-thirty train to Yell County! All aboard!\" the conductor in his blue cap called out. Mattie quickly hurried after him. He opened the train car door for her, and taking her hand in his gloved one, helped her up onto the stairs. He then placed her suitcase beside her. Taking a deep breath, she stuck out her hand. \"I wanted to thank you for all that you have done for me,\" she said sincerely. \"You are a man with true grit. If you ever find yourself in Yell County, you know where our homestead is.\" LaBoeuf grasped her hand and shook it, his green eyes twinkling. \"Mattie Ross, you are the bravest person I have ever met. I wish you the best.\" As the train started to pull away, he tipped his hat to her. She watched him grow smaller and smaller, until he was only speck in the distance. Then he was gone. She found herself a seat, and watched the night sky over the prairie turn to black. As the train rolled east, Mattie closed her eyes and fell asleep.[Chapter 2] Chapter Two FIVE YEARS LATER It was a beautiful spring afternoon: the bright sunshine beat down across the green prairie and the wind was gentle as it blew through the open barn where Mattie stood brushing the dapple gray, Lily. Mattie was now nineteen, and a couple inches taller. She had learned to mount her horse with one arm, building her strength in both of her legs and her back, and she had learned to control and lead her horse in ways that didn't use hands and arms. All in all, she had become quite an accomplished horsewoman. Her hair was still in braids though her mother tried to get her to wear it up in a bun, and her dark blue wool dress was plain, with none of the decoration other girls her age wore. Mattie didn't mind, but her mother sure did. \"Mattie Ross, come up to the house this instant!\" Mattie's mother's impatient voice carried across the wind from the house. \"Yes mama,\" She muttered under her breath, putting away her brushed and giving Lily one last pat. As she made her way through the tall grass from the barn to the small whitewashed house, she noticed a buggy hitched up to the porch. It was a beautiful little thing, all shiny with leather seats and brass trimmings. She was admiring it, when her mother came out of the house. \"There you are, you little goose!\" she scolded, motioning for Mattie to come to her. \"Where have you been?\" \"I was brushing Lily,\" Mattie replied as she went up the stairs. Her mother took one look at her and sighed. \"Look at you,\" she mourned. \"With hay in your hair, and dirt on your nose. What will I ever do with you?\" \"So I saw that there is nothing better than that a man should rejoice in his work, for that is his lot—\" \"Don't you quote scripture at me, Mattie Ross,\" her mother interrupted, placing her hands on her hips. \"Now go wash your face and dust your dress. We have a visitor.\" Curious, Mattie tried to peer into the house, but her mother swatted her. \"No! To the pump!\" she said sternly. \"And for heaven's sake, take the hay out of your hair!\" Muttering about the state of her eldest daughter, she went back into the house while Mattie went down to the water pump in the yard. She scrubbed her face until it was pink, dusted her dress off as best she could, and took the hay out of her hair. Then she went back up to the house. Sitting at the kitchen table was a neatly dressed woman in a wool suit and grey hair that was neatly wound around the back of her head in a bun. When she saw Mattie, her pale blue eyes widened and she stood up. \"My heavens,\" she exclaimed, \"Is this Mattie? How you have grown!\" Mattie's mother smiled as she set mugs of steaming coffee down on the table. \"She takes after her grandfather, that one does,\" she said. \"Not a lick of her father in her.\" But Mattie was surprised to hear a note of pride in her voice. She had always been under the impression her mother despaired of her. \"Hello,\" she said to the woman. The woman smiled back, and stuck out her hand. She hadn't even batted an eye on the fact that Mattie only had one arm. \"I am Evelyn Brown, an old friend of your mother's.\" she said. \"I am heartily pleased to meet you.\" Mattie shook the woman's hand, and they sat down at the table while Mattie's mother poured the coffee. \"Evelyn has offered to take you back to Texas with her,\" her mother said, putting a teaspoon of sugar in her coffee. Mattie looked up from her own dark brew. Ever since her trip into Indian Territory, she took it black. \"Texas?\" she asked in surprise. \"What would I do there?\" \"I am a teacher in Fort Worth,\" Evelyn said warmly, her grey eyes warm. \"And I am in need of an assistant.\" \"Teaching?\" she asked in astonishment. \"But mama, how can you do without me? What about the horses?\" \"I think Frankie can do quite well with the horses on his own,\" her mother said breezily. \"And I have Victoria to help me.\" \"Then what of my arm?\" Mattie protested, desperately trying to find a reason not to go. \"Will they accept a girl with only one arm?\" Evelyn laughed, waving Mattie's concerns off with her gloved hand. \"Oh, my dear, you will be fine!\" So Mattie kissed her mother goodbye, and by nightfall she and Evelyn Brown were on a train to Texas. They arrived in Fort Worth the following afternoon, where she was given a small room at Mrs. Lee's Boarding House. Fort Worth was a bustling town, full of people and cattle. The train had just been put in, so more and more people were arriving every day. Upon arrival, Mattie had found that the few dresses she owned were not suited for teaching, so she was forced to use some of the money her mother had given her to purchase new ones. She chose a sprigged muslin for summer, and both a dark blue wool with jet buttons, and red wool for fall and winter. She hadn't been able to convince Evelyn to get rid of the bustles, so she had to buy a crinoline as well. Evelyn had also wanted to try something new with her hair. \"You are a woman, my dear,\" she tsked, pulling Mattie's dark hair out of their braids. \"You are too old to be wearing braids down your back.\" Mattie hadn't argued, because she knew there was no point. Besides, it didn't really matter to her how her hair was done, as long as it was easier than sitting down in a crinoline and bustle. She loathed them. But if there was one thing she loathed more than her skirts, it was teaching. She didn't mind children as she had younger siblings of her own, but the work was tedious and it gave her a headache. Being cooped up in a stuffy school house was enough to drive her mad. And she was lonely. Evelyn was very kind, but she did not replace the warmth of Mattie's mother. Mattie soon settled in, and began her new life in Fort Worth. The children she taught sums to were for the most part bright and eager to learn. One in particular, a little mute boy by the name of Harry Roberts, was very quick with his studies. He could do complicated sums at lightning speed and was a good speller. He was also lonely. The other children had little time to spare for a child who could not talk, and his mother had to work for her living. He also had no father, just like Mattie. Little did Mattie know that Henry would be the catalyst that would change her path in life to one where she would never be alone again. That change began on a warm autumn day in early September. Mattie was on her way back from the post office when she heard gunshots ring out. That in-of-itself was not a surprise, but as she got closer to the schoolhouse, a sense of urgency built inside her. She quickened her step until she was running. As she turned the corner she saw a cloud of dust in the distance caused by the hooves of horses. In front of the schoolhouse was a crowd of people. She pushed her way through the crowd and the sight that met her eyes there turned her blood to ice. Lying on the dirt was Evelyn, her skirts splayed out and two bullet holes in her chest. She was still alive, but barely. \"Evelyn!\" Mattie ran to her, and kneeling down took the woman's hand her own. \"Someone fetch the doctor!\" \"It's already been done, little sister,\" a bearded man said to her, his tone grave. \"But it ain't goin' to do her much good.\" \"Mattie,\" Evelyn whispered, reaching up and stroking Mattie's face, leaving a trail of blood on her cheek. \"Who did this,\" Mattie asked urgently. Evelyn tried to speak, but only blood came out. \"It was the Roberts' Gang,\" the bearded man said heavily. \"Robbed a bank not too far north of here couple 'o' days ago.\" She felt Evelyn's hand come to her face. She looked as though she wanted to say something, so Mattie put her head down close. \"T-they took Harry!\" Harry. Harry Roberts, the little boy with no father. Anger burning in her, she grasped Evelyn's hand and whispered fiercely: \"I'll bring you justice, I swear it!\" Evelyn smiled and with one last gurgling breath, was dead. Mattie placed Evelyn's hands over her chest and slowly stood up. \"What man here will see justice done?\" The crowd shifted uneasily. \"The U.S. Marshal is gone!\" Someone hollered. \"There is no one!\" \"Then an able-bodied man, quick with a shot!\" Mattie demanded. But there was only silence, and anger flared in her at this familiar rejection. Just like they would not go for her father, they would not go for their school teacher. If they did not, she would. In silence, she pushed back through the crowd, and walked steadily down the street to the boarding house, her thoughts racing. If she did what she was about to do, her mother would collapse in a nervous wreck. But Mattie's sense of justice was greater than her fear over her mother's nerves, so she went up to her room and put on her coat and hat. After a moment's hesitation, she took out her suitcase from under her bed, and retrieved her father's pistol and a sack of bullets. Then she went around the corner of the house to the stable, where she saddled Evelyn's horse, Scout. She put everything in the saddle bags and mounted him. \"Steady boy,\" she murmured, as she swung up over the saddle, pushing her skirts out of the way. Leading the horse out of the stable, she took him out onto the street, and with a shout of \"Haw!\" he sprinted forward, and they raced out of town in the direction she had seen the horses go.[Chapter 3] Author's Note: Thank you, to all you who have added my story to your favorites! I'm posting this early so you have something to read over your morning coffee, other than the newspaper. :) Happy Saturday! Chapter Three Mattie caught up with the Roberts Gang along the shore of Lake Worth. There were three of them, resting their horses and laughing. Harry was sitting with one of the men, fear written all over his face. As she approached them, her gun drawn, they instantly stood up. One of them reached for his gun, but Mattie was too quick. She dropped the reigns and cocked her pistol. \"Don't you touch that,\" she commanded. \"I'll shoot if you do. The man slowly let his hand fall to his side. Mattie's heart was beating, and her mouth was dry, but she wouldn't let the men see her fear. \"Well, look what we have here,\" One of the robbers said showing his crooked yellow teeth as he sneered at her. \"Ain't you a purdy little thing. 'Cept for the arm, but that don't really matter.\" He turned to one of his comrades, the one who was staring at Mattie's drawn gun. He was not smiling. \"Ain't she a purdy little thing, Bill?\" \"Shut up, Stanley.\" Bill said, stepping forward. Mattie pointed her pistol at him, but he only looked at her. \"What is it you want?\" he asked, his voice soft but menacing. \"I want you to release Harry Roberts to me,\" she said firmly. \"And I want the man who fired the bullets that killed the woman back in Fort Worth.\" \"Haha!\" the man named Stanley laughed in disbelief. \"You hear that Ned? She wants the man who killed that school teacher!\" The man named Ned, who had watched this exchange silently, cracked a smile that sent a chill through Mattie's heart. \"Shut up, Stanley,\" Bill growled out. \"If you say one more word, I just might hand you over to her.\" That shut Stanley up, the smile falling from his face. He looked into Mattie's eyes, and she could see crazy in them. In actuality, he reminded her of Tom Chaney, and men like Tom Chaney were much more dangerous than they appeared. Bill turned back to Mattie, a small smile on his face. \"That him?\" she asked, jerking her pistol in Ned's direction. \"Well, Miss-?\" \"Ross,\" Mattie replied, keeping her eyes on him. \"Well, Miss Ross,\" Bill said. \"Harry is my son, and I have rights—\" \"Stealing a child from his mother and killing a school teacher are not rights,\" Mattie interrupted him coldly. That so?\" Bill replied, still smiling. \"Well I don't think I'll be giving my son to you. In fact, I think we'll be taking you along with us.\" \"How did you figure that?\" Mattie asked stiffening. There was something in his voice that made the hair on the back of her neck stand on end. \"Because there are four of us, not three,\" a voice whispered in her ear. With a gasp, Mattie whirled around. But in that moment, she felt a sharp blow to her head and everything went black. When she came too it was dark, except for the flicker of a fire a couple feet away from her. She was sitting with her feet were tied together. Her head was pounding, and as she tried to move, unbidden thoughts entered her mind and fear coursed through her. Had they dishonored her? She couldn't feel anything so they must not have touched her, at least not yet. Relief washed over her, but it was short-lived. One of the men had left the fire and was approaching her. She shut her eyes tightly and hoped he would think she was still passed out. Her heart stopped for a moment, but then he turned around and walked back. As soon as his back was turned, she began to pick the knot at her feet. It was a difficult procedure with only one set of fingers, but she had had a lot of practice. \"She's still out, Bill,\" Stanley called out. \"Lee must have hit her harder than he thought.\" \"I hit her as hard as I meant to Stanley, now shut yer mouth,\" The man named Lee growled out. \"Jeezus, I'm getting tired of everyone telling me to shut up,\" Stanley grumbled. \"Then maybe you shouldn't be so stupid,\" Lee shot back. \"Don't call me stupid!\" Stanley yelled, and Mattie saw him whip his gun out of its holster. He pointed it at Lee. \"You call me stupid one more time, and I'll blast your brains out.\" \"STANLEY!\" Bill bellowed, coming forward. \"You put that gun away right now.\" Stanley whirled around shaking his gun at Bill, who stepped back raising his hands. \"You're always picking on me! You all are!\" Stanley's voice was shaking, and his eyes were wild. Whatever sanity he had had, it was long gone. \"I'm not going to take it anymore!\" he shouted. \"I'm leaving this gang! Now give me the money!\" \"I'm not giving you the money,\" Bill said, his voice deadly quiet. \"Now put the gun down.\" Stanley stared at him a moment and Mattie drew in her breath. \"No,\" Stanley said. And then he shot Bill in the chest. Mattie screwed her eyes tightly together as pandemonium erupted, hoping in the flurry of flying, she would not be a casualty. She quickly finished untying the knot. Leaping to her feet, she found Harry's hand and pulled him through the smoke and dust looking for Scout. She was suddenly grabbed from behind, and Harry's hand ripped out of hers. \"No,\" she yelped in a furor, kicking out her feet. As she twisted in his arms, she got a look at her attacker. It was the man named Ned. \"Let me go right now, you pig swine!\" she yelled, but he was too strong, and too fast, and soon he was on top of her, fumbling with the buttons on the front of her dress. \"No! Get off me!\" Mattie howled, beating his chest with her fist. \"Shut it!\" Ned growled, smacking her across the face with his hand. He then reached down and hauled her skirt up, trying to find the buttons to her drawers. Mattie tasted blood in her mouth from where she had just bitten the inside of her lip. It hurt, but it was nothing compared to the revulsion she felt from Ned's roaming hands. As she struggled, she felt the cool handle of his pistol in the holster at his hip. Taking advantage of the blood pouring into her mouth, she spat it straight into Ned's eyes. Ned howled, and in the moment his grip around her lessened, Mattie reached forward and grabbed his pistol. It only took him a second to realize what she had done, but it was too late. She pulled the trigger and Ned slumped down on top of her. Desperately, Mattie tried to push him off, but his dead weight was too much for her. Sobbing, she wiggled her way out from under him and stumbled to her feet. She looked down to find that she was covered in Ned's blood and brains. Harry was standing not more than a couple feet away, holding one of the dead men's pistols in his little fingers, his eyes wide in horror and shock. Choking back the wave of nausea that threatened to upturn the contents of her stomach, she was just about to drop the gun when the sound of horse hooves brought on a fresh burst of panic. Whirling around, she saw a man wearing a Stetson riding up with his pistol drawn. \"Drop your gun,\" she ordered shakily, pointing her pistol at him. \"I've just killed a man and I will do it again.\" But then she saw the man's face and the gun fell out of her hand into the dust. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"What in tarnation have you gotten yourself into, Mattie Ross?\" He demanded, dismounting his horse. The fringe of his coat flapped and his spurs clinked, and when he looked up she could see his familiar green eyes and blond mustache. It was him.[Chapter 4] Chapter Four \"I should turn you over my knee and beat the tar out of you, something you most heartily deserve,\" LaBoeuf said furiously, his eyes flashing in the light. \"Coming out here by yourself with no lawmen. What the Devil were you thinking?\" \"I—\" Mattie began, but she was so overcome with relief, she couldn't come up with a snide retort, let alone an answer. Harry ran to her, burying his face into her skirt. Mattie sat down unable to keep her trembling legs upright any longer and Harry crawled into her lap without a word. \"Are you injured?\" LaBoeuf asked, urgently. \"Is any of this blood yours?\" Mattie shook her head. \"No, it all belongs to that man there,\" she said pointing at Ned's body. \"I shot him in the head.\" LaBoeuf went over to the man and turned him over. Grimacing at the sight of his disfigured face, he leaned over to get a closer look. \"He tried to dishonor me.\" Mattie whispered, more to herself than LaBoeuf, but his eyes flew to her face. \"He did not succeed,\" she affirmed, looking away from him. Her heart pounding in her chest, she held Harry tightly. She did not want LaBoeuf to see how frightened she had been. \"It was a foolish thing what you did,\" LaBoeuf said, but all the anger had gone from his voice. \"That man was Ned Parsons. He stands accused of rape and murder. He should have been hanged last year, except that he escaped from jail.\" \"That seems to happen a lot in Texas,\" Mattie muttered against the top of Harry's head. \"What happened to the other men?\" LaBoeuf asked, checking the body of the man called Bill. He was either ignoring her comment, or he had not heard her. \"It is better to trust and take refuge in the Lord than to put confidence in man,\" Mattie quoted, but when LaBoeuf glared at her, she said \"They found they did not trust one another.\" \"That is likely,\" LaBoeuf agreed. \"But, Mr. LaBoeuf, you do not seem surprised to see me,\" Mattie realized. \"How have you come to be here?\" \"I have been tracking Bill Robert's gang for a mighty long time.\" LaBoeuf replied, giving Bill a nudge with the toe of his boot, his spurs shining in the firelight. \"I arrived in Fort Worth not long after you left. The townspeople kept speaking of the teacher with one arm that went tearing after the Roberts Gang, bent on justice. Something inside told me it could only be you.\" Mattie didn't know what to say. She supposed it would be rare to find another woman with her temperament and description, but something inside her, akin to satisfaction, bloomed in that LaBoeuf would recognize her. LaBoeuf chose that moment to come over and crouch down in front of her. Involuntarily, she felt her cheeks turn warm, and she was heartily glad for the first time that night that they were covered in Ned Parson's blood, so LaBoeuf would not see her color. \"You got any extra clothing?\" LaBoeuf asked, his eyes lingering on her blood soaked dress. \"Preferably some without petticoats and a bustle? I have to say, I am surely surprised to see you dressed so. Never would I have expected to find you in a bustle.\" Her chin snapped up defiantly. But there was no jest in his tone, or in his face. If anything, he was surprised and….pleased. \"I teach arithmetic and grammar, and these are the required clothes of my profession,\" she replied haughtily. She scooted Harry off her lap and stood up. LaBoeuf followed. He was still taller than her, but not by more than a couple of inches. She could easily look him in the eye, which she did so. \"I do not own trousers, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"And do you usually make a habit of tearing around the country chasing after outlaws?\" LaBoeuf asked innocently going over to his horse. Mattie wanted to stamp her foot in frustration, but he took some clothes out of his saddlebag and handed them to her before she could decide how to respond. \"They'll be too big, but they are clean.\" She took the clothing doubtfully. \"Well, as clean as anything can be when one is chasing after the lawless,\" he amended with a tilt of his head. \"Thank you,\" Mattie said. She leaned down and looked into Harry's frightened eyes. \"You stay here with Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said firmly. \"He is a good man, though his tongue is a trifle loose.\" She looked up at LaBoeuf in triumph. He glared at her, and she turned back to Harry. In a softer tone, she said \"I know him well. He is a good man, and he will not harm you.\" Harry hesitated a moment, then nodded. Satisfied, Mattie stood up. LaBoeuf looking slightly mollified said, \"I will watch him well.\" So Mattie turned and went down to the lake. It was dark so far from the fire, but the moon was nearly full, so she could see enough to bathe. She took off her dress and shoes, leaving her petticoats and corset. Shivering in the cold night air, she took a handful of sand from the river bottom and scrubbed her dress as hard as she could. Then she unbraided her sodden hair, and removing her petticoats, she stepped in the water clad only in her corset and drawers. The water was freezing, and it took her breath away. Quickly she splashed water on herself to remove most of the blood. When she was done, she hurriedly pulled the dry clothes on and made her way back to the fire and the warmth it provided. LaBoeuf was cooking stew when she returned, and Harry was sitting by the fire. Ignoring LaBoeuf, she took her sodden dress and laid it across the bush closest to the fire. Then she got her bedroll off Scout and rolled it out. When she sat down Harry joined her. LaBoeuf glanced up from stirring the stew. \"Does the boy ever talk?\" he asked. Mattie shook her head. \"He's mute,\" she replied, and with numb fingers wrung out her hair and combing it out with her fingers. \"His father was Bill Roberts.\" LaBoeuf nodded. \"I heard that.\" He nodded at her missing arm. \"You have learned to ride,\" he acknowledged, handing her a dish of stew. \"And now you are big enough to shoot a gun without suffering from the kick.\" \"I have had plenty of practice on rattlesnakes,\" she said, spooning the hot food into Harry's mouth. LaBoeuf left his gaze drift down to her empty sleeve for a moment before it returned to her face. \"There's something I can't figure. Why would you ride all the way out here, putting your virtue, if not your life in danger, for those who are not your kin?\" \"Because there was no one else to see justice served.\" Mattie said without hesitation. \"If I had not gone, no one would.\" LaBoeuf was looking at her, a curious expression on his face she couldn't read. Then he gave her a smile and took out his pipe and tobacco. \"Why were you in Fort Worth?\" he asked, filling the pipe. He lit it and took a puff. \"My mama wishes me to find a husband,\" she admitted watching the smoke rings disappear into the night air. \"Though she never said that was exactly what I was to do, I knew her purpose.\" She looked soberly back at LaBoeuf who was watching her carefully. \"But men don't want a wife with only one arm, so my mama's prayers will go unanswered.\" LaBoeuf frowned at her. \"Then they do not truly know your character, or they would understand your other qualities more than compensate for the loss of an arm.\" Mattie raised her eyebrows at him. \"Other qualities, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked genuinely surprised. \"Well,\" he said gruffly, emptying his pipe out into the fire. \"You are brave, and loyal, though your shooting skills are mediocre at best, and your tongue is sharper than any two-edged sword.\" Mattie was rendered speechless, but before an appropriate response could come to mind, LaBoeuf got up and left the fire, saying, \"I must see to the horses. We leave tomorrow at dawn.\" Mattie watched him go, then lay down on her own mat and pulled her blanket up around herself and Harry. Before she had time to consider any meaning behind his words, she had fallen fast asleep and knew nothing until morning.[Chapter 5] Chapter Five LaBoeuf was cooking corn grits and salt pork over the open fire when she woke up, blinking in the morning sun. \"Morning,\" LaBoeuf said, with a wide smile. \"Did you sleep well?\" \"Good morning, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mattie replied, shaking Harry awake. \"I did, thank you.\" She folded up her blanket and bed roll and placed them on Scout. Taking a drink of water from her canteen, she caught sight of her reflection in the metal. Her hair was in tangles and there were smudges under her eyes. Grimacing, she combed through her hair with her fingers and braided it over her shoulder. As she was doing this, she noticed LaBoeuf watching her over his plate. \"Never seen a woman braid her hair before?\" she remarked acidly. \"Still no sugar,\" LaBoeuf mumbled to himself, though she heard every word. \"Not in a long time,\" he said louder, turning his eyes to his food. She quickly tied off her braid and picking up a plate, served herself and Harry grits. They ate and when they were finished they packed and tied up the dead men's horses. Mattie placed her foot in Scout's stirrup and swung up over his back. LaBoeuf picked Harry up and placed him in front of her, his gloved hand brushing her thigh. She looked at him sharply, but he had already turned away. He mounted his horse and rode ahead leaving Mattie to follow. When they arrived in Fort Worth Harry was returned to his hysterical mother, who wouldn't let Mattie go until she promised to stay for supper. Exhausted and filthy, she agreed. After she ate, she returned to her room at the boarding house and had hot water brought to her. She scrubbed the remaining blood and dirt from her body, fell into bed, and slept like the dead. The following morning, she put on her red woolen and twisted her hair up into a knot on the back of her neck. After breakfast, she went to see the school board. They requested that Mattie stay on until a certified teacher could be found to fill Evelyn's empty spot. SHe accepted and headed to the post office to send a telegram to her mother. There she met LaBoeuf, who had sent a telegram to his superiors in Austin informing them of the deaths of Bill Roberts and his gang. \"I assume you will return to Austin,\" Mattie said as she finished her post. LaBoeuf gently took her arm and slipping it through his, escorted her out of the post office. Mattie was startled at his courtesy, but LaBoeuf either didn't notice or pretended he didn't. \"I have business to attend to which will keep me in Fort Worth for a couple of months.\" He announced as they walked towards the school house. \"This morning I have attained lodgings at Mrs. Lee's, where I understand you are also staying.\" \"Yes,\" Mattie replied, looking at him curiously. \"Her rates are too high, and her food is sadly lacking; I grow weary of only porridge for breakfast. But I am sure you will find her place satisfactory.\" \"I trust you have a room to yourself this time?\" he asked, his eyes twinkling with humor. \"That you are not sharing a bed with an old woman who snores and robs you of your blankets?\" Mattie stopped as the memory of the morning she had slept in and awoken to find LaBoeuf at the foot of her bed came back to her. She turned to him. \"Why, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked tartly. \"Do you have a notion to enter my room and attempt to steal a kiss from me? I will remind you, I am no longer fourteen.\" \"No, that you are not,\" LaBoeuf, said, the humor gone from his eyes. Slightly taken aback, she stepped away from him. \"I will see you at supper, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said primly, and picking up her skirts, she walked briskly towards the school house. So Mattie took over the role of teacher in Fort Worth. The children responded well to her serious disposition, though it was different from that of Evelyn Brown. Mattie's mother had written back to her asking her to come home, but Mattie had refused, unwilling to let the children fall behind in their education. LaBoeuf moved into the boardinghouse. Mrs. Lee, over the prospects of providing for a Texas Ranger, had done much to improve her cooking, and meals were no longer the lackluster affair that Mattie had described. Of course only when LaBoeuf was there. He spent days away at a time at his work, so when he was gone they returned to how they had been before. Mattie told herself this was the reason she was always so glad when he returned, but truthfully, she missed him. He was something of a dandy and he made her temper flare, but his loyalty and sense of justice far outweighed his negative qualities. She had grown rather fond of him over the months she spent in his company. One evening in December, Mattie entered the dining room for supper to find Mrs. Lee hovering over LaBoeuf like a hornet. He had been gone for longer than usual, and when she saw him, Mattie's heart leapt in her chest. He did not notice her, so she stopped in the doorway to observe him: He had recently bathed for his blond hair was still damp, his moustache was trimmed, and his cowlick combed. His coat had been brushed and he had respectfully removed his spurs as not to mar Mrs. Lee's table. He was a handsome man. Before she could contemplate too much longer on LaBoeuf's handsome features, Mrs. Lee exclaimed, \"Miss Ross, do sit down!\" \"Good evening Mrs. Lee,\" Mattie said politely, addressing her hostess and the other guests. \"Mrs. Brown, Mr. Leroy, Ms. Daniels.\" She paused and met LaBoeuf's gaze. \"Mr. LaBoeuf.\" \"Good evening,\" LaBoeuf replied with an easy grin. He held her gaze as she sat down across from him, only looking away as Mrs. Lee brought supper to the table. They ate baked chicken, roasted potatoes and carrots, and sourdough rolls with fresh butter. For dessert they ate chocolate cake. LaBoeuf raised his eyebrows knowingly at her over his slice of cake, but Mattie only glared at him and finished her own cake with relish. \"I suppose she believes you are able walk on water,\" she hissed to him later as they were sitting in the parlor drinking coffee. After supper, she had tried to escape to her room, but Mrs. Lee had procured her to help with serving coffee to the other guests. Now, she was sitting on a rather worn horsehair sofa stuck uncomfortably between Mr. LaBoeuf and Mrs. Brown, who was on the heavy side. LaBoeuf grinned smugly at her, his arm pressing into hers. \"If the food is improved, might as well let her keep on believing.\" \"I do enjoy her chocolate cake,\" Mattie admitted. \"More than her conversation?\" he whispered, his eyes twinkling. The corners of her mouth lifted slightly and LaBoeuf pulled back. \"Well I'll be,\" he said softly. \"You do smile.\" Instantly, Mattie's mouth turned down, and she took a gulp of her coffee, scalding her tongue. \"Of course I smile,\" she whispered sharply. \"I just don't usually see an occasion to do so.\" LaBoeuf whispered back, \"Then you should find the occasion more often. You are almost pretty when you smile.\" Mattie pulled back, blushing, but before she could respond Mrs. Brown leaned over. \"What are you two whispering about?\" she intruded. \"I must know. \"Not a thing, Mrs. Brown,\" Mattie replied, a trifle flustered. \"We were discussing cake,\" LaBoeuf said good-naturedly. \"Do you bake, Mrs. Brown?\" \"Yes, of course I do, Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mrs. Brown responded, flushing with enthusiasm. After a few more minutes of listening to Mrs. Brown discuss the finer points of baking, Mattie rose from the couch and said goodnight. LaBoeuf nodded at her with a smile. Still too self-conscious from their earlier conversation, Mattie couldn't bring herself to smile back. She went to bed. Sometime in the early hours of the morning she awoke shivering from cold. It was snowing outside, and there was a draft from the window, so she decided to get hot coals for a bed warmer. Donning her slippers and dressing gown, and quietly slipped out of her room and down the stairs. The coals in the kitchen stove were banked, but she was able to retrieve hot ones from the bottom. She filled the bed warmer and re-banked the coals. Just as she was about to shut the stove door, LaBoeuf's voice came from behind her. \"Too cold to sleep?\" Stifling a shriek, Mattie whirled around, red coals scattering across the kitchen floor. One fell onto her dressing gown where it began to burn. She let out a small cry, and LaBoeuf was instantly at her side, smothering the coal into ash with bottom of his boot. \"Are you burned?\" he asked in concern. \"No,\" Mattie replied, trying to calm the beating of her heart. Taking the shovel and pan from the stove, LaBoeuf quickly scooped up the burning coals from the floor and deposited them back into her bed warmer. \"I did not intend to startle you.\" He said, glancing down at the charred fabric. \"I am sorry your dressing gown is ruined,\" \"It is no matter,\" Mattie replied gratefully. \"I shouldn't have been so clumsy.\" \"Well, here is your warmer,\" LaBoeuf said, holding it out to her. As she reached out to take it she noticed a change in his expression and his eyes drop from her face to her chest. It was then she realized that her dressing gown was wide open, revealing more than what was considered appropriate. Mortified, she yanked the robe around herself. LaBoeuf returned his gaze to her eyes and cleared his throat. \"Goodnight, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" Mattie said as steadily as she could, and taking the bed warmer from his hands, she bolted from the kitchen. Up in her room she placed the bed warmer under the quilt. When she stood up, she caught her reflection in the mirror on the dresser. The young woman that looked back had brown eyes that turned up slightly at the ends, a sober expression, and a pale complexion that easily turned sallow. She was not beautiful and it had never bothered her before. But as she stared at herself, she felt a twinge of regret that she did not smile easily and her hair was not a different color. With a small sigh, she got into bed where she fell into a troubled sleep.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six When Mattie awoke, her immediate thought was how warm it was under her quilt and how cold the air outside was. Snuggling down into the mattress, she closed her eyes…and then remembered the night before. She sat up quickly, her heart beating fast in her chest. As it calmed, she realized how foolish she was being. It was not like her to blush at compliments or worry over her appearance. LaBoeuf had always enjoyed provoking her, saying her disposition was too serious. Usually she would not pay him any mind and she did not intend to start now. She did not know what had gotten into herself. Giving her head a little shake as if it would restore her senses, she threw back the covers and slipped out of bed. She dressed, her teeth chattering in the morning air. On bitterly cold days like this she wished she had help dressing. It was extremely difficult to put on her corset with only one hand, but luckily the invention of the spoon busk made it possible for her to do so on her own, as long as she kept the cords loose. She put up her hair and splashed icy water on her face. Feeling less as though her brain was stuffed with cotton, she went downstairs for breakfast. LaBoeuf was not there, and though she wasn't about to admit it to herself, she was relieved. Seating herself at the table, she poured a cup of coffee. \"Where is Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she asked Mrs. Lee, who handed her a bowl of steaming porridge. Mrs. Brown replied instead, her eyes lighting up with the prospect of choice gossip. \"He left for Dallas this morning. He had some business to attend to there.\" \"I see,\" Mattie replied looking at the bowl of porridge with distaste. \"And did he say when he would return?\" \"I don't recall…\" Mrs. Brown murmured, drawing her brows together as if she were thinking hard. \"And how do you know of Mr. LaBoeuf's plans?\" Mrs. Lee asked Mrs. Brown, wide-eyed with interest. \"He told me last night,\" Mrs. Brown responded importantly, \"over coffee in the parlor.\" Mattie took a spoon to her porridge. It had the consistency of glue, she noted glumly. She sniffed it. It smelled like glue as well. \"That man is a true gentleman,\" Mrs. Lee said. \"A real catch for any woman so inclined.\" \"And handsome,\" Mrs. Brown added with a sideways glance at Mattie. But Mattie was so intent on swallowing the porridge without choking on it she didn't hear this exchange, and their hints went unheeded. Mrs. Brown returned to her own porridge, disappointed. LaBoeuf returned that evening in time for supper, though not before Mrs. Lee had overcooked the dumplings \"Evening,\" he said, taking his hat off upon entering the dining room. As he sat down in his usual place across from Mattie, he met her eyes and smiled. He was not behaving any differently than before last night, so she relaxed and nodded at him her acknowledgement. \"I trust your journey was not too tiring, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Mrs. Brown asked eagerly. \"You must have left early this morning to return to soon from Dallas. \"I did,\" LaBoeuf replied amiably, serving himself. \"I left not long after I met Miss Ross in the kitchen.\" Mattie choked on her chicken. Mrs. Lee, looking completely scandalized, leaned over and thumped Mattie on the back. It did little to ease Mattie's coughing. \"And why were you in the kitchen so late?\" Mrs. Brown asked slyly, looking back and forth from Mattie to LaBoeuf. \"It was a trifle cold last night,\" LaBoeuf said. \"Miss Ross was filling her bed warmer when I got up to make coffee.\" \"Oh!\" Mrs. Brown breathed out, her eyes wide in growing excitement. \"And what did you do?\" \"Mrs. Brown!\" Mattie pleaded through her coughing. \"I saddled Captain Quantrill and left before the sun completed its rise over the horizon,\" LaBoeuf said, glancing at Mattie, his eyes full of humor. \"Captain Quantrill?\" Mrs. Lee asked faintly, placing her hand at her breast. \"Yes, that is the name of my horse,\" He replied and went back to his dumplings. Mattie glared at him, but he just smiled. She finished her meal in haughty silence, ignoring him and making only polite conversation with everyone else. After supper, as the others adjourned in the parlor for coffee, she excused herself and went out to see to Scout. She almost slammed the kitchen door behind her, but refrained from doing so at the last moment. The last thing she wanted was for Mrs. Brown to think she actually cared a fig for Mr. LaBoeuf. It began to snow as she stormed across the yard to the barn. \"Puffed-up peacock!\" she grumbled, taking Scout's brush from its place on the barn wall. \"He could not get away with such talk in Yell County that is for certain!\" She brushed Scout's hair furiously, her mind full of the horrible things she wanted to do to him at that moment. She seriously considered putting tar on his saddle, but before her plan could come to any fruition, he came out of the kitchen, swaggering as he always did, and whistling Camptown Races . Her embarrassment of the previous night momentarily forgotten, she willed his fringed buckskin coat to burst into flame, but as it did not, she turned back to brushing Scout and ignored him. \"Mighty fine evening, Miss Ross,\" he said congenially, filling a bucket with oats. \"It's snowing, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she replied scornfully. But LaBoeuf merely nodded, saying, \"So it is,\" and went to fill a bucket of oats. He often teased her, but this was infuriating. \"What cockeyed notion entered your head, that you thought it a good idea to mention our chance meeting in the kitchen last night?\" she asked him through her clenched teeth. \"Are you deliberately trying to ruin my reputation?\" \"Not at all,\" he said cheerfully. \"But Mattie, I do not think that Mrs. Lee nor Mrs. Brown care much for your reputation. They are old ladies in need of a little excitement.\" \"Excitement?\" Mattie exclaimed, appalled. \"And you believe that we must provide them the fodder for such nonsense!\" \"Where else would they find it if not in their guests?\" \"Then I would ask that you not encourage such behavior.\" \"I need provide little encouragement. They do well enough on their own.\" \"You are very brazen, Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mattie said furiously, stamping her foot. \"Buck-up chickabiddy,\" LaBoeuf said fondly, turning back to Captain Quantrill. \"I won't tell that I saw you in only your nightdress.\" \"You—you—Texas jaybird!\" She sputtered out, and before she knew what she was doing, chucked her brush straight at his head. It hit him square on the back of his head with a large thwack ! He went face down into the hay with a groan, where he lay still. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked tentatively. Was he truly injured? She had not thought she hit him that hard. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" He didn't answer. Horrified, Mattie picked up her skirts and ran to his side. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" she cried out, sinking to her knees beside him. She pulled him over so that his head was in her lap. His eyes were closed, and it frightened her. \"Wake up, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said desperately, patting his cheek with her hand. \"Please!\" Just as she was about to run for help, one eye opened, then the other. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she said hopefully, holding her breath. Slowly a grin spread over his face. For a moment Mattie stared at him in confusion, and then she shoved him off and stood up, her cheeks flushing. \"You are awful! I thought I had done you harm!\" \"You have done me harm, though not as great as you feared,\" he admitted with a chuckle, sitting up and touching the back of his head gingerly. \"You clocked me well, and tomorrow I will have a lump to show for it.\" \"And one you well deserve!\" she snapped. \"I find your recent tomfoolery very vexing.\" But as she stared at his mussed hair and twinkling eyes, her anger dissipated, and scowling, she held out her hand. He grasped it and she helped him to his feet. He angled his hat on his head in a fine manner and grinned at her. \"If you get clobbered too many more times, you may end up with permanent damage to your mind,\" she said waspishly. \"I don't suppose the Rangers would want a slobbering fool in their ranks.\" \"This Texas jaybird will heed your warning,\" LaBoeuf replied with a tip of his hat. Mattie tilted up her chin, and picking up her skirts crossed the snowy yard to the boarding house. Behind her, LaBoeuf watched her go, a tender expression in his eyes. When she had gone, he sighed and said to himself, \"I hope you know what you are doing, LaBoeuf.\" He patted Captain Quantrill on the head. \"I sure hope you know what you are doing.\"[Chapter 7] Author's Note: I realized in Chapter Five I had typed January instead of December, so I went back and changed it. I really wanted the Christmas scene I wrote, so my apologies for the error. Anyways, here's a chapter for your Saturday morning! Chapter Seven Mattie had a pleasant Christmas in Fort Worth, even being so far away from home. Mrs. Lee cooked ham and potatoes, and Mrs. Brown baked a pie. LaBoeuf found them a scrawny pine tree which they decorated with cranberry garlands and dried oranges. For entertainment, LaBoeuf regaled them with exciting stories of his time in the Rangers, fighting bands of Comanche and Apache Indians, and of hunting the outlaw Sam Bass under the authority of Captain Junius Peak. Mattie listened to his stories with skeptical interest. She was sure he exaggerated in most, but the elderly ladies and Mr. Leroy seemed enthralled, so she kept her opinions to herself. She preferred hearing the stories of his childhood in Louisiana with his three brothers, which he had spoken of to her on many occasions. His mother had been widowed when he was only four, and later had suffered from seeing all of her sons go to war. They had all returned, though not without scars. LaBoeuf had been too young to see the beginning of the war, and had only joined up in the last six months. When he spoke of his time in Shreveport sacking oats for General Kirby-Smith, it was not without bitter regret. He had wanted to fight, but had not gotten the chance. Mattie thought perhaps, this was one of the reasons he acted so big—to cover up the shame he felt for not being in the Calvary. After the war he had moved to Texas, where he sporadically fought in the Indian Wars. When the Texas Rangers were formed, he had joined to fight the growing problem of outlaws robbing banks and trains across the south. As Mattie sat there pondering over his list of accomplishments, she realized she did not know what he was doing in Fort Worth. He was gone for days at a time, arresting outlaws and breaking up skirmishes between Indians and settlers, she had assumed. But now she wondered if that was all of it. He had never told her, and she had never asked. She decided to ask him over dessert, but he successfully evaded answering by taking a large bite of his pie, then jumping into a story of how he had been surrounded by five Kiowa-Apache warriors and escaped by the skin of his teeth. Mr. Leroy and Mrs. Brown were thrilled, but Mattie had heard the story before, and with a sigh, excused herself to help Mrs. Lee make coffee. \"That Texas Ranger of yours is a mighty fine man, Miss Ross.\" Mrs. Lee said conversationally as she se the water to boil. Mattie stared at her, her eyes narrowing. \"He is not my Texas Ranger, Mrs. Lee,\" she said in a sharp tone. \"We had the occasion to meet five years past when my father was murdered by the outlaw Tom Chaney, and then again when Harry Roberts was taken, but that does not make him mine. The Lord knows why he is here in Fort Worth. He seems unwilling to inform me of his reasons.\" Mrs. Lee glanced up at her with wide eyes as she poured the boiling water over the coffee grounds. \"My dear, he is a Ranger. Why he is here is probably under the cloak of secrecy.\" \"Indian skirmishes and outlaws are no secret, Mrs. Lee,\" Mattie replied churlishly. She knew she sounded childish. Over the coffee pot, Mrs. Lee was scrutinizing her in such a way that made Mattie uncomfortable. \"I'll serve coffee,\" she said quickly, taking the pot from Mrs. Lee and going to the parlor. There LaBoeuf was doing an imitation that to Mattie looked suspiciously like a drunk man falling off a horse. When he saw Mattie, he grinned and said, \"I was just telling them him how \"the sun\" got in Reuben Cogburn's eye while he was drunk on whiskey and shooting at corn dodgers,\" Mrs. Brown was clapping with glee. \"Oh, how exciting!\" she exclaimed as Mattie handed her a cup of coffee. \"As I recollect, you were drunk as well, Mr. LaBoeuf, and did not hit more than two in a row yourself,\" Mattie said to him as they sat down on the horsehair sofa with their own coffee. \"That is a falsehood, Miss Ross,\" LaBoeuf said seriously. \"I was not drunk; I was suffering from my injuries.\" \"Oh, was that it?\" she returned waspishly. \"And all that whiskey you partook of with Mr. Cogburn and Captain Finch had no affect on your sensibilities, or your tongue for that matter?\" \"As I recall, my tongue was bitten near through,\" he protested, spilling a little of his coffee. \"Yes, but it didn't keep you from using it,\" Mattie shot back with a triumphant look. LaBoeuf opened his mouth to retort, but then had the grace to look sheepish. They sat in comfortable silence, drinking their coffee until Mattie finally broke it saying,\"I often wonder about Mr. Cogburn.\" She could feel LaBoeuf watching her, and she was uncertain whether to continue, but the words spilled out under their own volition. \"He told me he would visit when he came to Little Rock, but he never did come, nor did he write more than a few words.\" She looked up at him, her mouth dry. \"Neither did you. I wrote you once and sent the letter to Austin. I always supposed you would write back, being an educated man.\" LaBoeuf was frowning at her in a thoughtful manner. \"I never received a letter from you,\" he said slowly, \"though I was in Austin. What did you write?\" \"Oh, this and that,\" Mattie said, brushing it off with a wave of her hand. \"News of our farm, my sister Victoria, and Little Frank.\" She didn't tell him that she had also written of how difficult it was to adjust to life with only one arm. How she had been learning to do basic chores again, how the phantom pains had interrupted her sleep and left her exhausted, or how much she would have enjoyed a visit from him. Immediately after sending the letter, she had burned in embarrassment at how silly she'd sounded. She had waited for a reply for months, but had finally given up hope. Truthfully, she had not thought about it in a very long time, and she was relieved that he had never received it. \"I am sorry I never wrote,\" LaBoeuf said, breaking her reverie. \"I never thought you would care much if I did.\" Now it was Mattie's turn to look sheepish. \"I said a great many harsh things to you, did I not?\" \"And continue to say,\" LaBoeuf said cheerfully. \"In the last week alone, I believe you have called me a rodeo clown five times, a Texas brush-popper twice, and a Texas-jaybird once.\" He frowned at her in mock anger. \"What is this disdain you hold for Texas?\" Mattie allowed herself to smile. \"I have less disdain now than before,\" she said, mollified. \"The people of Texas have treated me well, and for that I am very grateful.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" LaBoeuf replied with a considerable amount of pleasure. \"Very glad, indeed.\" Caught up in the warmth and contentment of the evening, she didn't press him to tell her why he remained in Fort Worth. She eventually discovered the reason, though it was a considerable time later. Much later than either could have anticipated.[Chapter 8] Happy Monday! Chapter Eight Not pressing LaBoeuf about his stay in Fort Worth did not mean Mattie had forgotten about it, and ultimately her ignorance of the truth, and her naiveté in the matters of the heart had unintended consequences that neither of them could have foreseen. Thrilled with the idea of matchmaking two of their very own, Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Brown had no longer felt it prudent to keep their opinions to themselves, and after Christmas, a rumor began in which Mattie and LaBoeuf lay rooted at the center. Soon the entire town was speculating that the school teacher had managed to ensnare the Texas Ranger with hopes of marriage. LaBoeuf had left on an expedition and had not been in Fort Worth when the rumor began. Mattie had not heard the rumor as she was not privy to the town gossip. Even so, she began to notice that people stopped talking moments before she entered a room, or regarded her with curious looks when they thought she was not looking. Finally, when a child at her school asked if Mr. LaBoeuf was \"courting\" her, and she made up her mind to speak to Mrs. Brown on the matter. Needless to say, it did not have the satisfactory conclusion that she would have liked. \"Mrs. Brown, may I speak to you?\" she said one morning after the breakfast dishes were cleared. \"Yes, or course dear,\" Mrs. Brown replied courteously, and led her into the parlor where they sat down. Mattie composed herself to be as even tempered as was possible. \"Yesterday, a child in my class asked me a shocking question about myself in relationship to the Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf.\" she asked. \"What, do you suppose, is the meaning of her question?\" \"Oh dear,\" Mrs. Brown said looking politely scandalized. Mattie could see full well, Mrs. Brown knew exactly what she was speaking of. \"As no one has yet informed me of my supposed attachment, I would very much appreciate if you did so,\" she continued firmly. \"I do not like being in the dark about such things.\" Mrs. Brown's eyes lit up at the prospect of becoming a confidant, and then she lowered them in feigned dismay. \"I have heard such a rumor concerning you and the Texas Ranger….\" she said slowly, eying Mattie through her lashes. \"….though I am reluctant to repeat such information, especially to one whom it concerns. You cannot wait to tell me, Mattie thought furiously, and it was all she could do to keep from shaking the woman silly. \"Please, Mrs. Brown,\" she said through gritted teeth, trying to keep her temper. \"Continue.\" With permission to speak, Mrs. Brown could no longer contain her excitement. \"They say that you have placed your hopes of marriage on the Texas Ranger, and the reason he has remained in Fort Worth so long, is because your success is certain.\" Mattie could only stare at Mrs. Brown, stunned. \"Is it true?\" Mrs. Brown asked breathlessly, \"That you mean to marry Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"No, Mrs. Brown, it is not!\" Mattie choked out, finding her voice at last. \"And I wish whomever the rumor came from would cease its circulation.\" Mrs. Brown looked disappointed. \"Are you quite sure? He is a handsome man, and well mannered—\" Mattie could not keep a scoff of disbelief from escaping her mouth. \"—and as you have few prospects, Miss. Ross, you could not do better.\" Mattie arched her brow. \"Pardon me?\" \"What I mean,\" Mrs. Brown went on, oblivious to the injury she was doing to the pride of the young woman before her, \"is that you have few suitors to choose from. None, if I am to be truthful on the subject. Now, I myself cannot see why…though it may be because of your shrewish manner, or perhaps because of your sharp…wit…but Mr. LaBoeuf would be a good catch for one such as you. And at thirty-five he should be settling down, not out chasing Indians across the prairies. He is in need of a woman to tame him...\" she continued thoughtfully, tapping her chin. \"And you believe I should be the one to do the task?\" Mattie asked, unable to keep the sarcasm from her voice. But Mrs. Brown only smiled condescendingly, the tone of Mattie's voice escaping her. \"No, dear,\" she said kindly, patting Mattie's hand. \"You do not have the temperament for that.\" She let out a short laugh, as if amused at the idea of Mattie taming anyone. \"All I wish to convey to you is that if he were to ask for your hand, you would be a fool not to take it.\" Mattie, whose temper had been steadily growing during this last speech could do nothing but leave as fast as she could before she said something she would regret later. Stiffly rising from the couch she said, \"I must go to school now, Mrs. Brown. Please excuse me.\" \"Of course, my dear.\" Unaware of anything amiss, Mrs. Brown beamed at her. Mattie turned around and walked out of the parlor. She mechanically put on her coat and hat and left for the school house, her boots pounding on the frozen ground. That tedious woman and her idle tongue! To be called a shrew, and implied that she was intolerable was forgivable, but to hear of supposed designs she had never had, and her lack of suitors so candidly discussed as gossip, was beyond insult. Was that how everyone perceived her? Did LaBoeuf see her in the same way? She felt pain at that thought and she stopped abruptly in the middle of the street. He often said her tongue was too sharp, but he had also called her brave and loyal, and said once she was \"almost pretty.\" Suddenly she was thrown into an uncertainty in his sincerity towards her. Could the kindness and friendship he had shown her the last few months be born out of nothing but pity for her situation? Questions and terrible thoughts whirling in her head, she reached the school house where her unsuspecting children waited with wide and innocent eyes. She lost her temper twice during lessons, sending one child into tears over a simple mistake on his slate, and she did not go back to the boarding house for lunch, eating only a soft apple and a small piece of cheese for her meal. If only to make matters worse, it began to snow on her way home, large wet flakes, and by the time she reached the boarding house she was exhausted and frozen to the bone, ill-prepared to handle what happened the following evening. Poor LaBoeuf could not have been aware of the events of the last week, for if he did, he would have been wise enough not to approach her as he did. Any other time and she might have realized the tender sweetness that he would awake in her, but she was stubborn by nature, and when it came time for her mind to acknowledge what her heart knew to be true, she failed miserably. She was feeding Scout in the barn when LaBoeuf returned from his expedition, covered in snow and wearing a sober expression. Mattie's back was turned to him, but she knew it was he by the sound of his clinking spurs. \"Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said stiffly, not turning to face him. \"Mattie,\" LaBoeuf answered. But his voice did not sound normal, and when she peered at him over her shoulder, he was standing with his hands at his sides looking slightly unwell. \"Are you taken ill?\" she asked in genuine concern, momentarily forgetting her anger and confusion. \"No, I am not ill,\" he replied, but did not elaborate further. Mattie returned to Scout, but she didn't hear him attend to his own horse. She turned back to find him staring at her, his hat now in his hands. \"What is it, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she asked in growing irritation. Why was he being so strange? He was silent a moment, and then said, \"I can no longer remain in Fort Worth. I have been called back to Austin.\" Mattie stared at him. \"I see,\" she said in a hollow tone, a strange buzzing noise filling her ears. \"And when will you leave?\" \"Soon,\" he replied. Mattie nodded. She felt a little light headed. Was she ill? She felt her forehead. It did not seem warm. \"Do you remember what you told me last year?\" he asked, interrupted her thoughts. \"The reason your mother sent you to Fort Worth?\" Mattie looked up at him warily. \"What of it?\" \"Have you ever been inclined to do as she wished?\" \"You mean, that I marry,\" she stated, humiliation coloring her cheeks. \"Yes,\" he replied, scraping the toe of his boot in the dirt. Mattie looked away, her heart beating hard in her chest. Why did he wish to speak of this now? \"No, Mr. LaBoeuf, I have not,\" she said. \"It is unlikely that it will ever be fulfilled, and she well knows it. My mother has often despaired of me, and I have often disappointed her. But I have no illusions over what lot the Lord has granted me and I am content to be alone.\" She could hear the bitterness in her voice, and hated herself for it. LaBoeuf took a step closer to her. She could smell leather and winter on him, and for a moment she forgot herself. His next words soon brought her back to her senses. \"You are still young and can say such a thing, but the older you get the loneliness you will have once thought of as tolerable eats your soul. The burdens you once thought you were able to bear alone become heavier.\" \"I do not see why that is any concern of yours,\" Mattie replied abruptly turning away from him. \"Do you not?\" She whirled back around, her anger flaring up. Her voice trembled as she spoke: \"Are you deliberately trying to provoke me, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" \"No, Mattie,\" he burst out in frustration. \"I am trying to ask you to marry me.\" \"What?\" Mattie asked, aghast. LaBoeuf tried again, but Mattie jerked away before he could speak. \"No, don't say it!\" she cried. \"Please!\" He looked as though she had slapped him. \"I see,\" he said in a tone of deep mortification, but Mattie was too upset to notice. \"How could you?\" she gasped out. \"Do you feel so much pity for me, Mr. LaBoeuf? He stared at her, his eyes widening. \"Pity?\" \"Yes, pity!\" Mattie cried, overcome with emotion. All the pain and anguish she had hidden deep in her heart from the years of being overlooked in favor of one prettier and sweeter tempered burst forth, and she was incapable of perceiving him differently. \"Why else would you ask such a thing? I know I am not beautiful, nor in possession of a sweet nature, but I have my pride, Mr. LaBoeuf, and I would rather remain a spinster than submit to the humiliation of marrying a man because I had no hope of any other prospects!\" \"That you think so little of me, I confess I do not know what to say,\" LaBoeuf said in a bitter tone. \"I regret I wasted your time, Miss Ross.\" Then he was gone out into the rain, leaving Mattie alone in the barn. Tears blurring her vision, she sank into the hay and placed her face in her trembling hand, unable to comprehend what had just occurred. She stayed there as long as she could, dread filling her at the thought of facing him again. Supper was half over before she gathered enough courage to enter the boarding house. But LaBoeuf was not there. She ate little and went to bed early. But she could not sleep due to the knot in her stomach and the ache in her heart. Around dawn she rose and dressed, and went down to the kitchen. The house was still, but as she was pouring a glass of water, she heard the whinny of a horse outside the kitchen door. Cautiously, she peeked out the window. There was LaBoeuf with his horse, saddled and packed as though he were never coming back. Forgetting her fear and her coat, she opened the door and stepped outside. Even from a distance, she could smell the whiskey on him and it shocked her. Never had she known him to drink more than a few . LaBoeuf looked up at her and stiffened. \"You—you are leaving so soon?\" she stammered out. \"As I mentioned last night, I can no longer remain here,\" LaBoeuf said, his words slurring together slightly. \"And as there is nothing here to keep me here, I must return to Austin. I have duties to attend to.\" \"I see,\" was all she said, unable find any words to refute his. His face was drawn and the twinkle was gone from his eyes. He looked as though he had aged overnight in spite of the drinking. With considerable difficulty, he swung his leg up over Captain Quantrill, managing not to fall off in the process. \"Well then, goodbye, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said woodenly. He did not answer, and with a \"giddy up,\" he rode out of the yard. Mattie turned and went back into the house where she sat down at the kitchen table, shivering. She felt like crying out, but her eyes were dry. The pain she had felt at his attempted marriage proposal was nothing compared to what she felt at his departure.[Chapter 9] Chapter Nine A week after LaBoeuf left Fort Worth Mattie learned that she was finally being replaced as school teacher, and her services would no longer be needed. That same morning she received a letter from her mother, once again asking her to return home. As she stared down into her mother's childish scrawl, the inevitability of her situation loomed over her, and she knew she could no longer stay in Fort Worth. She quickly wrote her mother a reply, and putting on her hat and coat, stepped out to post it. The sky was dark with storm clouds, but she had not thought to bring an umbrella. Sure enough it began to rain; large drops that dripped down from her hat onto her face. She was surprised to find she was crying. Tears poured down her cheeks where they mixed with the rain, and then into her mouth where she could taste their saltiness. She said her goodbyes to Mrs. Lee and Mrs. Brown (who cried), and took the train to Arkansas. After deliberating what to do with Scout, she had decided to bring him with her. The journey home was uneventful, and Mattie stared numbly out the window as the scenery passed. Her sister and brother were at the station to meet her when she arrived. She was surprised to find that Little Frank had grown almost a foot in her absence and that Victoria was engaged to be married. Married! Victoria! It was not possible that her younger sister could already be engaged. But at sixteen (\"Too young,\" Mattie sniffed, much to her sister's chagrin) she was, and would be married in September. As Little Frank drove the team home, Mattie listened as Victoria chattered about her beau and all his attributes. His name was Samuel Graves and he was taking over his father's store in town. He was handsome, kind, and mother adored him. Mattie could not help but notice how beautiful Victoria looked as she spoke of her intended. Her eyes sparkled and she almost glowed from within. Mattie felt a wistful tug in her heart, but she shoved it down. Even so, LaBoeuf's expression of surprise and pain as she refused him came back to her, and she did not hear Victoria until she was tugging on her sleeve. \"Mattie! Mattie, you are not listening!\" Mattie looked up into Victoria's pouting face and said, \"Of course I was, little sister. I always listen to you.\" Once again happy, Victoria looped her arm through Mattie's and began speaking of the house they were to live in and the drapes she would hang in the parlor. The sun was setting behind the pine trees as they reached home. Mattie had not realized just how much she had missed her mother until she was in her strong and warm embrace. \"My child, how I have missed you,\" she whispered against Mattie's hair. Mattie could not respond, for clinging to her. She was not one to give into emotional words, but she knew her mother could tell she had missed her as well. When they broke apart, her mother held Mattie at arm's length in front of her and said, \"Why, you have finally become a lady, Mattie Ross!\" Mattie snorted in disdain, but she could not help feeling pleasure at her mother's words. Too often she had seen dismay on her face instead of pride, so it warmed her heart. \"I have learned much,\" she admitted with a small smile. \"Just as you hoped.\" \"And what of the Texas Ranger?\" her mother asked, looking into her eyes. The smile dropped from Mattie's face before she could stop it. She dropped her eyes as well. \"He has gone back to Austin,\" she said, her voice sounding forced. She was afraid to look into her mother's face for fear of seeing pity there. \"Well,\" her mother said briskly, dropping the subject of LaBoeuf, \"let's get you inside. It's is cold and supper is waiting. Then without another word, her arm tight around Mattie's waist, she led her eldest daughter into the warm house. Mattie soon settled back into her life in Arkansas, though she missed Fort Worth and her school children terribly. She even missed Mrs. Brown, as much as she hated to admit it. But There was much work to do before the harvest and Victoria's wedding, and it kept her from thinking about Fort Worth or LaBoeuf for any long period of time. In the evenings she would eat supper and fall into an exhausted sleep for a few hours before getting up the next morning and doing it all over again. She was not happy, this she knew, but she thought sooner or later everything would return to normal and eventually she would be content. But as the months passed, contentment never came, and still life went on. In April she turned twenty. In July she oversaw the picking of the cotton and took it to Little Rock, where she got thirteen cents a pound. In September Victoria was finally married, and left Mattie to sleep alone in the room they had shared almost all their lives. The months had passed like clockwork, and it wasn't until one day in late October when she finally examined her heart and discovered the truth that lay there. She was looking for a brooch Victoria claimed she had left in their room, when she caught sight of herself in the mirror above the dresser. For a moment she thought she was looking at a stranger, until she realized with an unwelcome jolt of surprise, she was looking at herself. There were dark shadows under her eyes and lines around her grim mouth. Her hair was pulled back in a severe bun and her skin was sallow. She looked older than her twenty years, and deeply unhappy. Mattie slowly sat down on her bed, stunned by how much she had changed. Had others seen the change in her as well? As she thought about it, she recalled that she had recently caught her mother watching her when she thought she wasn't looking, an expression of worry etched on her face. And the night before her wedding, Victoria had squeezed her hand and asked Mattie if she would be alright without her. Mattie took a deep breath and let it out slowly, and with it the tension she had been holding in her for months. She had always known she would never marry, and had resigned herself to it at a very young age. Being lonely was just a part of her life, and she had never expected anything else. But then LaBoeuf had entered her life a second time, and she had been…happy. As she sat there in the fading twilight filled with a strange sort of emptiness, she wondered where he was and what he was doing. Was he still working for the Rangers? Had he finally met his end at the hands of a Comanche or the gun of an outlaw? Had he married another? That last thought caused her such physical pain she let out a sob and placed her hand over her mouth to stifle the noise. Her emotional reaction shook her to her core, and it was in that startling moment that she realized she was in love with him, and had been for a very long time. She had loved him since the day he put her on the train to Arkansas, sending her home with one arm, but leaving her pride intact as he had called her the bravest woman he knew. She had not known it then, but she knew now her heart had been lost to him at that moment, and as she thought back to her reaction to his attempted his proposal, she burned in shame. Oh, God, what a fool she had been! She had been afraid of what his true intentions might be, and to protect herself she had pushed him away, not realizing he was one that could make her truly happy. Even if he did not love her with the depth that she did him, it did not mean that his regard for her was any less real or genuine. Almost a year had passed, and she had missed her chance at happiness. She lay back on the bed, sobs wracking her body in agony. She ignored her mother's calls and her brother's knocks. For hours she cried and when there were no tears left, she slept. When she awoke it was dark, and the house was silent. Splashing water on her face, she went out to find her mother and brother had gone to bed. There was a dish of stew on the kitchen table, which she ate hungrily. After she finished, she put on her coat and lit a lamp, which she carried down to the stables. Scout was asleep, but woke when she placed her hand on his mane. Putting her face up against his warm body, she stood there for a very long time. As the sun rose, she had made a decision: she would not remain a passive bystander in life any longer. There was still a chance, however small that he still cared for her, so she would seize her happiness if it was still available. If it were not, she could live out the rest of her life knowing she hadn't been a coward. She would go to Austin and find LaBoeuf.[Chapter 10] Author's Note: Chapter Ten is short, but Chapter Eleven is already written, so it will be up soon. It was actually one of the first scenes I wrote for this story back in December, so I'm finally excited to put it up! I thought about combining the two, but in the end, decided to split them. Don't worry, you won't have to wait long! Chapter Ten It took two days by train for Mattie to get to Austin, though it felt much longer. Her mother had kissed her goodbye after making her promise to bring LaBoeuf back to Arkansas when she could. She had packed lightly, though at the last minute she included her father's pistol inside her satchel along with her toiletries. Somehow it was comforting to know it was there, though she couldn't put into words why that was so. She didn't sleep well on the train due to a crying baby coupled with her anxious thoughts, so when the train pulled into the station she was exhausted. The sky was white with impending snow and the air was bitterly cold. She wrapped her coat tightly around her body and went to find the station agent. She immediately asked him where the Rangers kept their headquarters, and having obtained directions, set off on foot through the sparsely crowded streets. She found it exactly where he had told her and, her stomach flip-flopping, went up the stairs and opened the large wooden door. Upon entering, a young man in the front immediately stood up, removing his hat. \"Please, I must speak to the Ranger LaBoeuf,\" she said in polite urgency. \"Will you tell me where I might find him?\" The man, taken aback by her directness, noted her missing arm. His eyes widened in recognition. \"One moment, miss,\" she man replied, and left her for a minute before returning. \"Please follow me. My captain wishes to speak to you.\" Mattie followed the man back to an office where a man, surprisingly young for a captain, greeted her and removed his hat. \"You must be Mattie Ross,\" he said offering her a chair. Mattie eyed the man suspiciously, declining his offer with a slight shake of her head. She was too fidgety to sit down. \"Pardon me, but how do you know my name?\" she asked, unable to keep her curiosity out of her voice. The Ranger smiled at her with far more understanding that she felt comfortable with. \"Every Ranger knows who you are Miss Ross. You are the woman who shot Tom Chaney.\" He nodded at her empty coat sleeve. \"And that is how I know you are she.\" Mattie didn't know what to say to that. \"My name is Titus Crawford,\" he said, tipping his hat.\"At your service.\" \"Pleased to meet you Mr. Crawford,\" Mattie acknowledged, \"but I am looking for Mr. LaBoeuf. Can you tell me where I might find him?\" The Captain shook his head regretfully. \"I'm sorry Miss Ross, but LaBoeuf rode out of here this morning chasing three men who left a man dead in a saloon after their poker game went bad. Never even waited for backup before he tore out.\" He played with his hat, as if trying to find the right words. \"You should know Miss Ross, he has been reckless,\" he said finally, \"as if he didn't care if he were killed or not.\" He slicked back his hair with one hand, and looked down at his hat. \"It ain't my place—\" \"Please,\" Mattie said hurriedly, taking a step towards him. \"—but he hasn't been the same since he returned from Fort Worth.\" \"I am unsure of what you mean,\" Mattie said, her heart beginning to beat faster. \"Well, you know how he likes to talk,\" he said with a rueful smile. \"Yes.\" \"He spoke very highly of you these last few years. How you had 'more grit in your skinny little body'— pardon me miss— than twelve men put together. We couldn't get him to shut up about you, really. Then after the Roberts Gang, he told the boss he was staying in Fort Worth, because he had to keep an eye on something. Of course, we all knew it was you. Then when he returned last winter… \" he trailed off, looking at her uneasily. Mattie's heart was thudding against her ribs so loudly she could hear it in her ears. The Captain met her eyes and held them with his intense gaze. \"He loves you,\" he said softly after a moment. Mattie let out the breath she had been holding. \"Yes, I know.\" And she did. \"That's why I have to go after him. What direction did he ride out? And I will need a horse. I took the train from Yell County, and I do not have my own.\" Captain Crawford looked shocked \"Well, I'll be!\" he let out with a laugh, and then apologized. \"Pardon me, Miss Ross. It is just that I am not accustomed to such directness from young women, nor finding them a horse so they can go riding off into the desert.\" Mattie tilted her chin up defiantly. \"You will find I am not like most women, Captain Crawford.\" The Captain nodded his acceptance and put on his hat. \"So be it. Now let's go find you a horse.\"[Chapter 11] Author's Note: I'm sorry this wasn't posted sooner. but I've been sick and busy with school. I hadn't wanted to wait this long to upload this chapter. Anyways, here it is. Maybe it will help if you have \"a case of the Mondays!\" Chapter Eleven Mattie rode north towards Dallas, her father's pistol strapped around her waist and her skirts whipping in the wind. It was bitterly cold, and there was the threat of snow in the air. As she rode, her heart raced and thoughts flew through her head. What if the gunmen had killed him, or what if he was lying somewhere desperately injured? Fear made her urge her horse faster, the wind causing tears to stream from her eyes. The afternoon wore on and the sun began to set, it began to snow, the wind growing colder and colder. Mattie began to lose hope that she would find LaBoeuf before nightfall, if at all, so she found a good place to make camp near a stream, protected from the worst of the wind by a cliff overhang. Tying up her horse, she went off to look for dry firewood under the cliff. As she walked long the overhang, she thought she heard voices carried over the wind. Creeping closer towards the voices, she peered around a large boulder that had fallen off the cliffs, and recognized LaBoeuf by the fringe on his coat. He was standing with three men, presumably the gunmen. She couldn't hear their conversation over the wind, but suddenly LaBoeuf raised his pistol. Mattie set down the firewood she had been holding, and cocking her pistol, crept forward. The snow was heavy, but she could make out the rough features of the man closest to her. One shouted and suddenly the three men reached for their guns, and Mattie shot one of the men in the chest. Before she could cock it again, there was a torrent of gunfire that rang out across the snowy desert. Smoke from the gunpowder mixed with the heavy snow and Mattie was unable to see what was happening. Then as suddenly as it had started, the gunfire ended, and silence settled once again. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she called out tentatively. There was no answer, and fear gripped her heart tight in her chest. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" she shouted, holding her pistol out in front of her as she walked forward. Her arm was trembling, but there was nothing she could do to stop it. Through the snow she could see one man standing. \"Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she gasped out in a strangled sob, hoping to God that it was him. And it was. He appeared before her through the snow like an apparition, his eyes registering shock as he recognized her. \"You're alive,\" she sobbed out, lowering her pistol with a shaky hand. \"I feared you had been killed.\" \"Mattie?\" he replied in a stunned voice. \"How have you come to be here?\" \"I— But she stopped as she saw blood oozing through his fingers as he clutched his upper right arm. \"Mr. LaBouef! You've been shot!\" LaBoeuf grimaced and looked at his injury. \"I have had worse, as you may well remember. It is not bleeding much, I do not think I will die tonight.\" Mattie walked around and looked at the back of his arm. There was an exit hole there, and relief filled her. \"How does it look?\" LaBoeuf questioned, and there was a trace of anxiety in his tone. \"The bullet has exited,\" Mattie confirmed. \"I will clean the wound as soon as we make camp for the night.\" LaBoeuf looked up into the snowy sky. \"The snow does not look like it will abate, and I do not fancy sleeping near the dead.\" Mattie pointed back to where she had come from. \"Beyond that ridge there was a good place to shelter from the wind and snow. I left my horse there.\" At the camp, Mattie began building a fire with the few branches and brush she had found while LaBoeuf tied and fed the horses with his one good arm. The overhang sheltered the fire from the falling snow, so she put down a bedroll and ordered LaBoeuf to sit down. \"I will be fine—\" LaBoeuf protested, but Mattie was already pulling off his coat. \"It is best to clean it to avoid infection,\" Mattie said firmly, ripping his shirt sleeve so she could see the bullet hole. It was clean and not jagged, so retrieving a bottle of whiskey from his saddle bags, she poured it over the wound. LaBoeuf sucked in his breath at the pain, but she merely ignored it, and after dressing his arm with a piece of cloth ripped from her petticoats, she helped him pull his buckskin coat back on. He took the whiskey from her, and meeting her eyes, took a swig. It was a defiant act, and one Mattie was unsure how to react to. She turned to the fire and began to prepare gruel. She could feel him watching her, and all her nervousness that she had forgotten in the face of his injury returned with such a force, her hand trembled. LaBoeuf watched her silently, intermittently taking a drink of whiskey as he ate. Mattie stared at the ground, but glanced up occasionally, for fear he might disappear into the night like smoke from their fire. She had not seen him for almost a year; she wasn't about to let him out of her sight now. Even so, she did not know how to begin explaining to him what she felt. To her relief, it was LaBoeuf who finally broke the silence. \"I found your letter.\" \"What letter?\" She was momentarily confused, but then remembered she had told him of the letter she wrote him years ago. The one he had never received. \"Oh,\" she said stupidly. \"That letter.\" \"It was discovered under the Captain's desk a couple months back when he was having his office cleaned.\" LaBoeuf went on quietly. \"I did not realize how much you had suffered. But I should have. And I am sorry that I did not come to visit you.\" Mattie did not know what to say, so she remained silent. \"How did you know where I was?\" he asked. \"I went to Austin to find you. Captain Crawford said you were gone pursuing men in a saloon fight. He gave me a horse and I came after you.\" LaBoeuf stared at her in bewilderment. \"You came after me,\" he repeated slowly. \"Yes of course, you rodeo clown!\" Mattie cried out in a burst of anger. She got to her feet. \"I had no choice, as you were a fool enough to ride off pursuing three men by yourself!\" But LaBoeuf ignored the insult and also rose. He walked towards her until he was only an arm's length away. \"Why, Mattie?\" He asked, his eyes mirroring her exhaustion and pain. \"Why did you follow me?\" \"Because—\" But her voice caught in her throat as the warmth radiating from his body and his familiar smell of musky leather threatened to send her knees buckling. She forced herself to take a step back, but she grabbed a hold of the front of his coat to support herself. He grasped her hand, not giving her time to let go. \"Because I wanted to tell you how I regret what happened the last time we met.\" She tried to keep her voice steady, but she failed. The feel of his rough palm against her skin sent her nerves on fire. \"You came tearing after me into the desert to tell me you felt regret?\" he pressed, his fingers caressing hers. \"Is that all?\" \"Because you were alone,\" she murmured, \"and Captain Crawford said you didn't care whether or not you were killed.\" She paused, and his fingers held hers tighter. Taking a deep breath, she let the last remnants of her pride go, and said, \"But I care, Mr. LaBoeuf. I care a great deal if you are dead.\" Her voice broke and she dropped her eyes to his chest. LaBoeuf grasped her chin and tilted it back up. \"I am deeply sorry for the pain I caused you,\" She continued in a stronger voice. \"I was afraid that you asked me to marry you out of pity, and I couldn't bear it—\" \"I have never once felt pity for you, Mattie Ross.\" He interrupted quietly. \"From the moment you rode that damn horse across the river six years ago, I have thought you the bravest person I have ever met.\" \"I went to Austin to tell you what a fool I have been,\" she said, \"To tell you how I suffered from your absence—\" LaBoeuf gently cupped his good hand around her cheek and leaned in towards her, his mouth inches from her own. She could smell the rich scent of whiskey on his breath, but it was not unpleasant. \"— and to tell you how much I love you,\" she whispered right before he gently pressed his wind chapped lips against hers. After a moment she broke the kiss and tried to step back, but he stopped her by placing his arm around her waist. He leaned in to kiss her again but before he could, she blurted out, \"I also wanted to ask if you would become my husband.\" He stopped and opened his eyes, staring at her as if to decide whether she was jesting or not. After a moment, he let out a snort of amazement. \"Mattie Ross, you are the only woman alive that would have the grit to ask a man to marry her.\" \"Well, you don't have to say yes!\" Mattie shot back, stung. She tried to pull away, but he only gripped her waist tighter. \"The Devil I don't,\" he replied in all seriousness. \"Where else could I find a woman who calls me a dandy and a fool—not to mention, a rodeo clown— and points out all my faults with a tongue sharper than a pistol whip?\" Mattie opened her mouth to add \"blustering peacock\" and \"big-timer\" to his list, but before she could utter a word, his mouth was on hers and he was kissing her again, over and over, his fingers in her hair and on her face, and his body pressed against hers, warming her in the cold snow. Mattie broke the kiss, shivering. \"No,\" She panted, putting her hand against his chest. \"You are trying to make me insensible with your kisses, but I will not submit.\" He pulled her back and kissed her again. She let out a whimper which he responded to with a gruff \"Lord help me.\" It took all of Mattie's strength and will to push him away. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I will not live in sin!\" she protested. \"And I have a mind to thrown you down on this bedroll and take you right here in the snow,\" LaBoeuf growled. \"Such words do not make me take kindly to your advances, however welcome they might be,\" she said blushing, and taking a couple steps back. \"And I do not suppose you will be doing much with only one arm available to you. I have six years more experience than you living with only the use of one limb. We must wait until we are married.\" He opened his mouth as if to argue, but then let out a weary sigh. \"I am dead tired,\" he admitted, sitting back down on his bedroll. \"As am I,\" she replied, and she rolled out her bedroll next to his. They both lay down, pulling the saddle blankets up to their chins to keep out the cold wind. After a few minutes of silence, LaBoeuf spoke: \"I have missed you,\" he said, so quietly, Mattie was not certain she had even heard him. She didn't answer, and inches apart, but without touching, they went to sleep, comforted in knowing that at last they were no longer alone.[Chapter 12] Author's Note: Sorry for the confusion last night. Here it is! Chapter Twelve They left for Austin the following morning and by that evening they were married. LaBoeuf had not wanted to wait. And truth be told, neither did Mattie, though she wasn't about to admit that to him. LaBoeuf saw a doctor, and after writing a hasty letter to her mother, they found themselves at the courthouse before a judge. It was here where Mattie first learned LaBoeuf's given name. He glanced self-consciously at her as the judge spoke it, but she only looked back at him with the same serious expression she always wore. It hardly mattered. She would always call him 'LaBoeuf.' As soon as they were pronounced man and wife, LaBoeuf took her to the Grand Hotel where they had steak and fried potatoes for supper. Before Mattie had finished her last bite, LaBoeuf grasped her by the hand and pulled her out of the dining room, ignoring her protests that they shouldn't waste the food God provided for them. \"If God makes me wait any longer, I might have to denounce him forever,\" LaBoeuf muttered as he pulled her up the street to the boardinghouse where LaBoeuf kept his rooms \"That is blasphemy,\" Mattie said in a pious voice. \"God will—\" \"Blasphemy is what I'm about to do to you,\" LaBoeuf interrupted as he opened the door. He dragged her up the stairs, then picked her up in his arms and carried her into his room. \"And God will have to wait.\" \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mattie exclaimed. \"Your arm!\" But she was silenced as his mouth covered hers. \"It is nothing,\" he said when he was finished with her mouth. He dropped her onto his bed and climbed on top of her, his fingers going to the buttons on her dress, kissing her again as he did so. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Mattie protested between kisses. \"Mr. LaBoeuf!\" \"What?\" LaBoeuf murmured against her bared neck as he pulled her dress down. \"Please dim the lamp.\" \"No, you one-armed prude,\" LaBoeuf said, discarding her dress. \"You are my wife, and I have the right to look at you.\" \"Perhaps I don't want to look at you,\" she replied tartly, but before she could say anything more, he was loosening the laces of her corset. He removed it along with her petticoats so that she lay before him in her chemise and drawers. There was an intake of his breath as he took in the sight of her in the flickering lamplight, and Mattie could do nothing but stare back, feeling the heat in her face. LaBoeuf unbuttoned his vest and shirt, discarding them along with her dress. His arm was bandaged. He was all corded muscle, sprinkled with a few scars. She reached up and touched one on his shoulder. \"Is this from…?\" she trailed off, but sure of what his answer would be. \"Rooster Cogburn,\" he replied. Pulling her up to his chest, he traced his fingertips up her arm with one hand, and gently caressed the sensitive skin of her amputated elbow with the other. She shivered under his touch. \"I wonder where Mr. Cogburn is,\" she mused aloud, trying to ignore her lack of modesty as LaBoeuf pulled her chemise over her head. She was sure her mother had never acted this way with her father. \"Is this really the time to be thinking about that one-eyed old coot?\" LaBoeuf pronounced impatiently, unbuttoning her drawers and sliding them over her hips. \"Well, I am a one-armed prude,\" she mimicked back, and then grew serious. \"But I have never wanted to kiss Rooster Cogburn.\" Reaching up, he unpinned her hair and watched it tumble down across her breasts. \"If you ever want to kiss Rooster Cogburn, I would say you should have your head examined,\" He muttered, unbuttoning his trousers and pulling them off. She blushed when she saw him naked, and blushed even harder when he pushed her back onto the bed, parted her knees, and gently settled himself on top of her. \"This will most likely cause you—\" LaBoeuf started, but was cut off by Mattie placing her hand over his mouth. \"I am aware of how this works, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said. \"I do not need to be coddled like an innocent child.\" LaBoeuf's eyes crinkled up into a smile, and he gently removed her hand from his mouth. \"Not coddled, Mattie. Never that. But for once, please let me protect you?\" He gently cupped her cheek in his hand, his thumb brushing the skin under her eye. \"Please?\" He lowered his face and gently kissed her jaw where it met her neck. But Mattie couldn't answer. She was too overwhelmed with the feeling of his bare skin on her own and the feathery touch of his lips on her body as he slowly moved his way down to— \"Oh, Lord in Heaven, smite me now!\" Her mother had told her if she married, it would be her job, her duty, to submit to her husband. But she had never told her it would be like this. If this was submitting, Mattie had no doubt she would do it again… And gladly. Author's Note: Oh, cheese. But it had to be done![Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen Mattie opened her eyes to bright sunlight streaming through the window above her head. She blinked several times and then shifted slightly under the warm covers. Her arm came into contact with the warm body of LaBoeuf next to her and the corners of her mouth turned up into a small smile as she looked over at him. His blond eyelashes resting gently on his wind chapped cheeks, his lips slightly parted in sleep—he looked so vulnerable. Hesitantly, she reached out and brushed a lock of his hair of his face, her fingerings lingering over the sensitive skin of his ear. She shifted closer, her eyes roaming over his face, memorizing every feature. Suddenly his eyes snapped open, startling her. \"It is very disconcerting to wake and find oneself being stared at,\" LaBoeuf said, his hand capturing hers, and pulling it down to his chest which was still bare. \"I was merely wondering how I could have married such an old man,\" she replied. She tried to pull away, but he wouldn't let go. Instead he pulled her against him, causing her heart to beat faster. \"I see,\" he said softly. \"And has this old man disappointed you?\" Mattie was quiet a moment as she looked into his eyes. \"No,\" she admitted, \"he has not.\" \"Good,\" LaBoeuf whispered, slipping his hand down her shoulder to rest upon her hip. \"Do you feel much pain?\" Mattie blushed, but she did not turn away. \"Only a little,\" she admitted. There was the tiniest upturn of her lips. \"It was nothing like having one's arm amputated.\" LaBoeuf let out a guffaw which turned into a grunt of pain. \"What is it?\" LaBoeuf sat up, wincing slightly as he moved his injured arm. \"I fear I might have overworked myself last night.\" Mattie sat up clutching the blankets to her chest with her hand. \"Do you need a doctor?\" she asked concernedly. \"Shall I dress and fetch one?\" LaBoeuf looked over at her, his eyebrows raised. \"Dress? I believe I prefer you as you are.\" Mattie ignored him and tried to take a look at his wound. Instead he tried to kiss her. \"I think I should fetch you a doctor,\" Mattie replied, avoiding his kiss. She swung her legs over the edge of the bed and tried to stand up, pulling the quilt with her. But LaBoeuf would not let it go. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, I insist you let me have the quilt,\" Mattie ordered, pulling it again. But it was to no avail. Even injured he was too strong. \"And I insist that you stay in my bed, Mrs. LaBoeuf,\" he ordered back, but there was a twinkle in his eyes. Mattie narrowed her own, and on a sudden whim she would later blush to think of, she dropped the bedclothes and stood before him naked. LaBoeuf's intake of breath and loosened grip was all she needed to snatch the quilt off the bed. It slipped through his relaxed fingers before he realized what she had done. \"I have to confess,\" he said in a strained voice, \"I did not expect such boldness from you.\" Mattie turned pink at his words as she wrapped herself in the quilt, her hair tumbling over her white shoulders. \"And are you disappointed in me?\" She parroted his earlier words. LaBoeuf shook his head, still mostly naked. \"No. No.\" He gestured to her with his good arm. \"Please, continue.\" She walked over to the wash basin but was aware of his eyes still on her. \"Please avert your gaze,\" she said softly staring at him through the mirror. \"Mattie, you are my wife, and I will see you as you are.\" She felt her cheeks grow hot. \"Yes, I know. But—but I must wash myself and I feel strange and embarrassed to have you see me in such a state.\" \"It is only blood. You and I have seen much worse.\" Mattie did not reply, but picked up a towel and poured fresh cold water into the china basin. Wetting the linen, she let the quilt drop to her feet and began to wash the sticky mixture of blood and (she burned as she remembered the moment she felt him release inside her) semen from between her thighs. She was tender to the touch, but it was a wonderful sort of ache that made her aware of her skin and sinewy muscles in a way she had never known before. She felt like a woman. When she was finished she turned around where LaBoeuf sat watching her, his eyes filled with something she could not put into words because she did not have the vocabulary to define it. Perhaps a re-reading of Solomon's Song might give her some idea… She dressed in silence, until she had donned her dress and suddenly asked, \"Will you do my buttons?\" LaBoeuf raised his eyebrows but did not say anything. He beckoned her over to him and did so, standing with her back to him. LaBoeuf stood up slowly, and she could feel the heat from his body behind her. She swallowed hard as she felt the soft caress of his breath on her bare neck and the light touch of his fingertips just below her waist. \"Are you so certain you wish me to?\" he whispered into her ear, sending shivers down her spine. One of them had to stop this and she knew it could only be her. \"Mr. LaBoeuf, it is late morning!\" she said in the most scandalized voice she could muster, whipping around to glare at him, \"And you are in need a doctor! You are bleeding through!\" She gently poked his bandaged wound and he let out a hiss of pain. \"Yes! Yes!\" LaBoeuf put up his hands in defense and backed away from her as though she were infected with smallpox. \"Please! Fetch the doctor! I would rather he saw to my injury than submit any longer to your rough administrations.\" He buttoned her up the rest of the way, and she pulled on her boots and coat. Before she left, she leaned down and gave him a gentle kiss, which he let her do without taking control away from her. \"I will be back shortly,\" she murmured against his lips. As she pulled away, he caught her hand and turned her back to him. \"You had better be.\" He was rubbing the soft skin of her wrist with his thumb, and it made her knees weak. \"I do not care that it is late morning, or afternoon.\" \"But the horses—\" \"The horses are being tended to. The only thing I plan on tending to is my wife.\" Mattie let out the breath she had been holding. \"We will see about that, Mr. LaBoeuf\" she said with that rare smile that made his heart skip. But LaBoeuf would not be attending to anything, least of all his wife. An infection had set in, and he was bedridden for two weeks. Mattie did what little nursing she could, but it did not come to her naturally, and it nearly drove them both stir crazy. When they weren't bickering, she kept him from boredom by reading aloud the newspapers and writing letters for him to his family, and to hers. It was especially pleasurable to write the letter to her mother announcing that the marriage had taken place and that she would bring him home to meet her properly once he was well enough to travel. Mattie could not help but smile as she saw the word \"wife\" scribbled out under the nub of her pen, though she was careful to keep it concealed from LaBoeuf. She didn't know if she could bear to see his twinkling eyes and his knowing smile if he found out. What she didn't realize he too had something to hide. From his bed, LaBoeuf would watch her as she wrote at the small table in their room waiting for her to disappear in a puff of smoke. He didn't know if it was delirium from his fever or because he had spent so long wanting her, dreaming of her—but he feared sometimes that she wasn't really there, that it was another dream that he would awaken from and find himself alone in his tangled sheets as he had done so many times since he had left her in a drunken haze. Being bedridden was not something he was used to, and it made him feel helpless and angry, especially when Mattie took care of those things that he was supposed to take care of, being a man and her husband. And as those who have too much time on their hands often do, he began to think, and then he began to doubt. Thoughts drifted through his head, the most prevalent was that he shouldn't have married her because he was too old for her. His rational mind said at fourteen she had already been something of an old woman—she wasn't one of those twenty-something's, head stuffed with nonsense. But even so, he wondered if he had made a mistake. With nothing to do he imagined all the horrible outcomes to all the \"what if\" situations he could think of. Mattie was obviously unaware of his troubled thoughts. Her cheeks were pink and no longer sallow, and her mouth no longer pinched. Her clothes somehow suited her, even the dratted bustle, and sometimes, he could see the corners of her lips turn up slightly before she would duck her head back down, scribbling away on a letter to her sister. It was plain to see that she was content. This only made him worry more, as he feared that he could not keep her that way.[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen It had been almost three weeks since they had married, and LaBoeuf's infection was gone and his wound almost completely healed. He was sitting at the small table in their room eating an apple with his knife lost in his melancholy thoughts, when he heard a thudding on the stairs. Before he could get to his feet, Mattie burst through the door, her hair coming undone as a few pins clattered to the wooden floor beneath her feet. \"Mattie, what is it?\" LaBoeuf asked, his brow furrowing in concern. \"What's wrong?\" Triumphantly, Mattie held out two train tickets pressed between her thumb and forefinger. \"I bought us tickets for the five o'clock train tomorrow to Yell County!\" She replied with pride. \"I've sent a telegram to my sister, Victoria, and she will meet us at the station when we arrive.\" LaBoeuf wrinkled his nose and set his half eaten apple down on the table. \"Already?\" With a snort Mattie set the tickets on the table and pulled his valise out from under the bed and began pulling his clothes out of the closet and ceremoniously dumping them into the valise. \"You've been out of bed for a week, and we cannot stay here forever. It's time to go home.\" \"Yell County is not my home, \"LaBoeuf said before thinking. Mattie spun around and stared at him, her mouth pinching. \"What do you mean by that?\" Her tone was frosty, but he wasn't going to let her off the hook. \"I am from Texas, Mattie, and I am a Ranger. If I am going to continue—\" \"A Ranger?\" she said in a deadly stern voice, he just knew she had used with her students. \"You still desire to be a Ranger, and leave me to worry while you go rambling about the country getting shot at by thieves and murderers? \"Mattie—\" LaBoeuf said in a warning tone. \"No. I will approve of any vocation you had mind to take up, other than Ranging or Marshalling, or any other such dangerous occupation, but—\" But LaBoeuf had already lost his temper. Slamming his knife down on the table, he stood up and faced her. \"Mattie! I will not let you dictate to me what I will or will not do. I am a Texas Ranger. That is what I am, and that is what I will be. You are my wife, but you do not have any say in how I will support you, do you understand me?\" She only stared at him which infuriated him even more. \"I said, do you understand me?\" \"I am not deaf, nor dumb,\" she said acidly, throwing a shirt into the valise. \"I understand every word you say.\" \"Good.\" He replied, sitting down and taking up his knife. They were silent as Mattie finished throwing things into his valise, making as much noise as she could. She finally snapped the damn thing shut and stomped across the floor to the door which she promptly flung open and went through, slamming it shut behind her. LaBoeuf let out a weary sigh, but before he had time to think about what had just happened, the door swung open again, and Mattie stuck her head in—\"But we are going to Yell County!\" She snapped, \"where I will properly introduce you to the rest of my family, do you understand me ?\" She did not wait for a reply, but slammed the door so hard the glass in the window panes rattled. LaBoeuf seethed in silence, taking it out on the rest of his apple with his knife. After a moment, he threw the apple across the room, swearing as he did so. It knocked over his hat and bounced under the bed where he didn't bother to retrieve it. They did not speak for the rest of the day, and though they slept side by side that night, they did so back to back, both too proud to turn to the other and ask for forgiveness. By the following afternoon as they boarded the train to Yell County, the air between them was palpable with tension. The train rolled north and the sun began to set. When darkness fell, Mattie fell asleep, her head gently nodding until it was resting on LaBoeuf's shoulder. They had not touched intimately since that first night due to his injury and it had been only a few nights since they had shared the same bed again. LaBoeuf had sorely missed her comforting touch, having felt it only briefly before it was torn away from him by illness and then by her anger and his own. He felt his anger drain away and in that moment he longed to make things right again—but he didn't know how, and it only fueled his worry that he had made a mistake in taking Mattie to bed and marrying her so soon. Though she was often wise beyond her years, she was so young—stubborn, and he worried that when he died, as he most surely would before her, she would be alone and would have no one to care for her. She could marry again—but he didn't even want to think about that. Pushing the thoughts from his mind, he allowed himself to be lulled by the gentle rocking of the train and soothed by the warmth of his wife. It wasn't long before exhaustion overcame him and he fell asleep. He was woken suddenly by the shrieking whistle of the train and the conductor bellowing as he passed through the car, \"Yell County! Next stop, Yell County\" Rubbing his sore neck, LaBoeuf looked down and found Mattie staring at him. She quickly turned away and began to gather her coat and hat. The pinched lines around her mouth were back and doubt again reared its ugly head within LaBoeuf's chest. \"I'll collect the luggage,\" he muttered, getting to his feet. He did not look back. As LaBoeuf stepped off the train into the bright sunlight and set down their luggage. Spurned automatically by the manners his mother had beaten into him, he turned to help Mattie off the train to find her passing right by him. \"Mattie!\" A voice called over the din of the crowded station. \"Mattie, over here!\" LaBoeuf brushed off the hurt he felt at being dismissed and looked up to see a pretty woman waving her hand in the air. Mattie was soon by her side he could only assume it was her sister. He picked up the luggage and walked through the slush and snow over to the two women. \"I've missed you,\" he heard Mattie say as he approached, her voice warm with feeling, and it made his insides ache to hear it. \"But you are here now,\" Victoria replied with a smile that lit up her face. \"And you have brought us a new member of our family,\" she said turning to LaBoeuf. LaBoeuf tipped his hat and gave her a polite smile. \"Pleased to meet you, ma'am.\" \"I think I was but a child the last time I saw you,\" Victoria replied, her eyes twinkling merrily. \"You were as handsome then, as you are now.\" \"Victoria!\" Mattie admonished as they walked towards the waiting covered buggy. \"Oh, pooh,\" She scoffed with a toss of her fur covered head. \"Samuel will be pleased to have another man to talk to, poor dear. He's been surrounded by too many women folk for so long!\" \"What of Frank?\" Mattie asked? \"Frank is still a boy,\" Victoria replied. \"And he is like you—more interested in sums and The Bible than horses and rifles.\" They loaded their luggage up into the back of the buggy and LaBoeuf shook Samuel's hand, and the man gave him an easy grin. There was something about the man that made LaBoeuf like him instantly. Mattie and Victoria sat in the back, while Samuel and LaBoeuf sat in the front speaking of horses, and farming, and of what it was like being a Texas Ranger. Samuel seemed slightly in awe of him, which made him feel both proud and fatherly. Through the swells of their conversation, LaBoeuf heard Victoria chatting away behind him, Mattie quiet as a mouse. LaBoeuf supposed this was normal, because she seemed completely at ease with her sister. When she was with him, it was he that struggled to be heard over her. Mattie and her sister; they were as different as night and day. Victoria was bright, blonde, and very much the type of woman LaBoeuf had always thought he would want as a wife. Mattie in turn was dark, sober, but in some ways more beautiful than her sister. While Victoria burned with an energy that shone like sunlight, Mattie was more of an ember, her fire deep within, waiting to be unleashed when her passion was kindled. Having been many times the man who had kindled that ember, LaBoeuf felt a deep sorrow at the idea of it being extinguished—and that he might be the one to extinguish it. Melancholy, he grew silent and withdrawn. Samuel wisely said nothing but turned his eyes back to the road in front of him. It wasn't much longer before they pulled up to a white washed farmhouse surrounded by bare willows, with a red barn and pasture in the back. The small stream that ran by was mostly frozen with dead pussy willows lining the banks. It was just as LaBoeuf remembered, but also changed somehow. It was more alive, even in the dead of winter, than he recalled from his first time here so long ago. Perhaps it was because he now knew Mattie so well that he could see her in this place. He could see the house where she grew up surrounded by those who loved and despaired over her. Brought out of his thoughts by the slamming of a wooden screen door, he looked up to see Mrs. Ross hurrying towards them, her hands stretched out in front of her. Thinking she was going to Mattie, he was taken by surprise when it was he that she came to first, grasping his hands and pulling him down from the buggy. \"Oh, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said breathlessly, her eyes sparkling with joy. \"My son-in-law. Why I never thought I would see my Mattie married—let alone to a Texas Ranger!\" LaBoeuf heard Victoria let out a giggle that was quickly smothered by a hand to her mouth. He had no doubt it was probably Mattie's. Though taken unawares, LaBoeuf never one for being speechless; he tipped his hat to her and said, \"You are very kind ma'am. I am pleased to find you in better health than the last time we spoke.\" Her mouth tightened slightly as a cloud of pain passed over her eyes. \"Yes, that was a very…trying time for me,\" she said. \"I am sorry for your loss,\" he murmured, unsure what else to say. She gave him a pat on the hand and sad little smile. \"Thank you, you are very kind,\" she replied softly. \"Yes, thank you, Mr. LaBoeuf!\" Victoria exclaimed a little too cheerfully as Samuel helped her down from the buggy. \"It was so long ago, but we do miss father, don't we, Mattie?\" Mattie, who was right behind Victoria, faltered a little, her face turning as gray as the clouds in the sky above her. LaBoeuf instantly grasped her hand to steady her and help her down from the buggy. She didn't look at him, but went instantly to her mother and wrapped herself in her arms, the empty sleeve of her coat swinging with the movement. It was a constant reminder of loss—the loss of a father and the loss of childhood. Victoria gently laid her head on her mother's shoulder. Feeling the intruder, LaBoeuf turned from the family and looked out over snow covered barn and the dead field where the cotton Mattie was always so proud of would grow come spring. As much as he loved his home state of Texas, he had to admit it was beautiful here. Very beautiful. \"Where is Frank?\" Mattie asked, bringing LaBoeuf's attention back to the present. \"In the barn, dear, the last place he wishes to be,\" her mother replied with a smile. \"He'd much rather have his nose in a book. Don't you worry; he'll be in for supper later.\" She turned to LaBoeuf and took his hand. \"Now let's get you inside. You must be frozen to the bone, poor man!\" Ignoring Mattie's eye roll, he let himself be led inside to the warm comfort of the Ross home. The afternoon was spent drinking coffee around the kitchen table while the fire in the hearth burned brightly. LaBoeuf talked with Mrs. Ross about his childhood and working as a Texas Ranger, while Mattie boiled water and added enough coffee beans to make a dark brew, just the way he liked it, LaBoeuf noticed. She didn't look at him when she set his mug down with clatter, and LaBoeuf's heart sank. She must still be angry with him. Samuel joined them while Mattie hovered over the stove. LaBoeuf wished she would come sit next to him, but her back was stiff and straight, and he knew if he tried to touch her, she would only pull away. Outside it began to snow again and at last Frank came, stamping snow from his boots. He was no longer the \"little Frankie\" LaBoeuf remembered peeking out from behind his mothers skirts all those years ago, but had grown into a tall young man with broad shoulders, and hair the same color as Mattie's. LaBoeuf stood up to shake his hand, and was glad to feel it was strong and warm. He had Mattie's brown eyes, but while hers were usually solemn, his sparkled with humor. \"It is good to meet you, sir,\" he said in a respectful voice. \"I am glad my sister has a husband such as you to take care of her. We always thought she'd be alo—\" \"Frank! Shut up!\" Mattie interrupted harshly causing Frank to step back in shock. Mattie's eyes flashed in anger and resentment as she glared at everyone in the room. \"I don't need a husband to look after me. I can take care of myself, and all of you, as I always have! You should remember that!\" And with that, she grabbed her coat, and flinging the door open stalked out into the snow. Ignoring the stunned silence that her family seemed to be paralyzed by, LaBoeuf, cursing under his breath, strode out after her. \"Mattie!\" he called, stomping through the blowing snow, trying to keep her coat in sight as she went towards the barn. \"Mattie!\" She refused to look back, but opened the barn and went inside. He followed her. He found her with her head against the horse called Scout, which he recalled from the time she had run off to bring back a little boy to his mother and find justice for a woman no one else had the courage to do justice for. \"Mattie,\" he said softly, \"Mattie, look at me.\" He placed his hands on her stiff shoulders and forcefully turned her to face him, but did not meet his eyes. He tilted her chin up and she reluctantly caught his gaze. \"You regret marrying me,\" she said flatly. \"I saw it in your face the day I bought the train tickets.\" \"I—\" But LaBoeuf didn't know what to say. Had he been so transparent? \"I don't need you, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said stiffly pulling away from him, but he wouldn't let her go. \"Mattie,\" he said forcefully, \"It isn't what you think. I have doubts, yes, but it is because I am so much older than you, I will surely leave you alone and uncared for—\" \"I can take care of myself!\" she cried out. \"Why is it that no one thinks I can care for myself?\" \"Of course you can, but I never, ever want you to have to,\" LaBoeuf said, his voice cracking. \"I want you to live a good life with a man that can give you everything and be there for you until you are old and gray, and I—\" he faltered, looking at his feet. \"I will almost surely die before you and that it something I cannot bare to think of. Mattie, you are my wife, but I fear that I was selfish in marrying you. I fear that I will only bring you greater sorrow.\" Instantly her hand was on her hip and she looked as formidable as he had ever known her to be. \"That is the worst excuse to doubt marrying me, Mr. LaBeouf! I would—will never marry another, even if he were the King of—of—it hardly matters!\" She sputtered angrily. LaBeouf shook his head in frustration. \"Mattie, Christ almighty—\" \"Do not take the Lord's name in vain,\" she interrupted in that haughty voice she always took on when he swore or used the name of God in any context other than prayer or citing scripture—\"And fifteen years!\" she exclaimed, throwing her hand up in the air. \"I am not a child, Mr. LaBoeuf! I love you more than anything! More than my own being!\" She pressed her fist against her chest, over her heart. \"A few years with you would mean more to me than a lifetime with a lesser man, because they are all lesser men in comparison to you. I have only known three men in my life worth the ground they trod; Rooster Cogburn, my father, and you.\" For not the first time in his life she had rendered him speechless—and he wasn't even upset to be grouped in the same category as Rooster Cogburn. \"And—\" she continued, her face took on a pained expression as she closed her eyes before finishing, \"—I would even be willing—no, be glad to live in Texas,\" She opened her eyes and looked directly into his, \"if that would make you happy. For that is what I want more than anything. For you to be happy, because you have made me the happiest I have ever known, and I would die before I let you go again.\" He took her hand in his, bringing it to his mouth where he gently kissed her knuckles. She stepped closer to him pressed her forehead against his. \"I would die,\" she repeated. LaBoeuf's shoulders sagged. \"But Mattie, I know nothing but of finding criminals and bringing them to justice,\" he whispered shamefaced \"If I cannot be a Ranger, I fear I do not have any means to support you.\" His words hung in the air between them, LaBeouf raw with vulnerability. \"But, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said softly,\" I know a great deal about working land. I could teach you and we could work together to create the life we wish. And perhaps—there might be a place, a town somewhere that needs a Sheriff. Would you mind ever so much if life got—a little less exciting?\" LaBoeuf laughed softly and pulled her close. \"Oh, Mattie, my darling Mattie,\" he murmured. \"I do not mind in the least. Forgive me for my stubbornness and my pride.\" \"Only if you forgive me mine,\" Mattie mumbled into his shoulder. \"I have behaved very badly towards you.\" \"No more than I have towards you. But promise me one thing.\" She looked up at him, a serious expression on her face. \"Promise me we will never go to bed angry, for of all the curses you have thrown at me, I admit that one hurt the worst.\" \"Never again,\" Mattie promised, flinging her arm around his neck. He lifted her slight body off the ground and buried his face in her hair. She smelled of the winter snow and the coffee she had made earlier—and of home—for it didn't really matter where he lived as long as she was there beside him. His heart belonged to her and wherever she went he would always follow, for she was his home. Mattie, her heart bursting with hope and happiness, looked out over his shoulder into the falling snow where the oil lamps burned brightly in the windows, beckoning them into the warmth and safety of the house. Unable to keep it inside any longer, she smiled. LaBoeuf's head turned slightly toward her. \"Are you smiling, Mrs. LaBoeuf?\" he asked in a teasing tone. \"No, my Texas jaybird, not at all.\" She turned towards him until their lips brushed together. She felt the warmth of his breath and then she kissed him, grasping the fringe of his leather coat. After a moment she broke away and smiled up at him with all the love she had. \"Not at all.\" The End ","Summary":" Chapter One In her delirium, Mattie was having a nightmare that she was being chased.

Hazel climbed down the ladder as fast as she could, then ran down the stairs of the dock. Just then, a car pulled up in the parking lot of Clear Water. A door opened and Sawyer stepped out. Hazel stood in front of him smiling. \"Hey,\" she said while she lifted her hand out for him to shake. Sawyer grabbed it, but then quickly pulled her in for a hug instead. Hazel was surprised, but she enjoyed every second. \"I have so much to tell you,\" Sawyer said with a grin, after they pulled away. \"So do I,\" Hazel muttered to herself. Sawyer smiled at her then turned to his mom, Lorraine who was standing behind her son. \"Can I see Winter mom?\" he asked. Lorraine nodded. \"Of course!\" she told him. Sawyer looked at Hazel. \"Race you!\" he shouted, then ran towards an entrance. Hazel ran after him into the aquarium. Once they reached the pools Sawyer jumped in, but Hazel hesitated. \"What are you waiting for?\" he said to her. Sawyer then grabbed her arm and pulled her in. They swam with Winter for a few minutes until it was time to get out. Hazel and Sawyer got towels then sat down in the crows nest to dry off. It was very sunny out so they dried off fast. \"So did you have fun at the SEA program?\" Hazel asked. \"Of course!\" Sawyer replied. \"But I missed Winter,\" he said. \"Oh,\" Hazel simply said. \"And you.\" He smiled at her, and she smiled back. \"So what's been happening here?\" he asked. \"Oh you know, same old stuff. We rescued and released more animals.\" \"That's great.\" Hazel this is the perfect time to tell him, she thought. \"Um Sawyer?\" Hazel said. \"Yeah?\" Sawyer grinned at her making the situation way more difficult. I can't do it, she thought. \"Uh, it's time to feed the dolphins,\" she said instead. … Sawyer came home from a busy day at the aquarium. He dropped his bag down on the floor then sighed heavily as he sat on the couch. Lorraine came in with a glass of water and a snack for her son. \"Honey take a break you just got home from a three month trip,\" she told him. \"They need me there mom. Plus Winter missed me,\" he said. Lorraine smiled. \"Okay, if your willing to do all that hard work.\" She sat down the water and snack on the side table. \"But I think Winter's not the only reason you want to work there,\" she teased as she walked to the kitchen. Sawyers eyes widened. \"Is it that obvious?\" he said aloud. Sawyer grabbed his phone and started to text his cousin Kyle. Sawyer: I need 2 talk 2 u Kyle: Sure man. On here or in person. Sawyer: In person. Kyle. Okay I'll be right over. Sawyer waited for Kyle to come on the front porch of the house. Kyle didn't live too far so he came right away. As soon as Sawyer saw him pull up he went up to greet him \"Hey Sawyer,\" Kyle said as she shut the car door. \"What's up?\" he asked. \"I need help,\" Sawyer said as they sat on the porch. \"Okay try me., Kyle said. It took Sawyer a minute to get it out. \"How do tell a girl that you like her?\" \"Oh so there's a girl?\" Kyle teased. Sawyer looked away. 'Maybe...\" he said. \"So does this girl happen to like dolphins too?\" Kyle said. Sawyer's eyes widened. \"How did you know?\" he asked. \"Oh come on, we all new,\" Kyle said. Sawyer put his hands on his face. \"I've known her for four years Kyle. What if she only like me as a friend.?\" \"Well that risk will be your decisions Sawyer.\" Kyle patted his shoulder. \"And trust me, if you don't tell her you'll regret it forever.\" he told him. That stuck in Sawyer's head the rest of the day and through out the night. He lay awake thinking about it. If he never told her Hazel she could end up with another guy. He could never live through life seeing Hazel with someone else. Sawyer turned side ways in his bed and stared at a photo that sat on top of this side table. It was of him and Hazel playing with Hope. A few minutes later he finally fell asleep. The next morning was bright and sunny. Sawyer went to the kitchen and grabbed a banana for breakfast. He said goodbye to his mom then hopped on his bike to go to work. When he got there he was greeted by Hazel and her dad. \"You guys can start off by feeding the dolphins,\" Clay said. He handed a bucket to Sawyer that was filled with small fish. Hazel and Sawyer walked into the aquarium. Inside, a girl walked over to Sawyer. \"Hey Sawyer!\" she said. \"Hi Jordan,\" he greeted. Hazel stood there awkwardly. \"Hazel this is Jordan she was on the trip too.\" Jordan put out her hand so Hazel could shake it, but she refused. \"Sawyer we gotta feed the dolphins,\" she said grabbing the bucket. Sawyer walked to the edge of the pool where Hazel was bent over putting fish in the water. \"So what are you doing here?\" he asked Jordan whilst throwing fish to Winter. \"I've been wanting to meet Winter since like forever, so I asked my mom if I could,\" Jordan said. \"Here why don't you feed her?\" Sawyer suggested. He handed the bucket to her. She came over and bent down next to him. \"So,\" she said, after feeding Winter. \"Is this your girlfriend?\" she asked, looking at Hazel. Sawyer was surprised by the comment. \"Hazel? No, .were just friends,\" he replied quickly. Hazel looked in the other direction. \"Are you sure?\" Jordan asked. \"Um.. Yeah.\" Sawyer said along with a quiet sigh. \"Oh,\" Jordan said as she went on her way. Hazel and Sawyer looked at each other with awkward smiles then got back to feeding Winter.[Chapter 2] The next day Hazel found Phoebe in the water with Winter. She was giving Winter her breakfast. Hazel walked over to the pool and sat down with her feet in the water. \"Hi Hazel,\" Phoebe said. \"Hey Phoebe. Can I ask you a question?\" Hazel asked. \"Sure go ahead,\" Phoebe said with a smile. Hazel was glad she could come to Phoebe with any problem she had. Since she didn't have a mom, Phoebe was the one she could go to, to talk about girl stuff. \"Is it weird if the girl says she likes the guy before he does?\" Hazel said. \"No way,\" said Phoebe. \"If you know for sure that you like him then I don't see why you can't tell him first.\" \"Oh, okay,\" said Hazel. \"But either way, you shouldn't just keep it inside of you. Do what your heart tells you,\" Phoebe explained. Hazel nodded her head with a small smile. \"Thanks,\" she said. Hazel stood up and walked around the corner. She wasn't looking where she was going and bumped right into Sawyer who was going in the same direction. That caused Hazel to fall to the ground. Sawyer immediately helped her up. \"We seem to do this a lot,\" he joked after Hazel got to her feet. She laughed. \"Yeah, we do.\" \"Do you have a minute?\" Sawyer asked. Hazel glanced at a clock near by. \"Sure,\" she said. Sawyer gestured her to follow him into the crow's nest. They sat side by side one another. Sawyer had his hand in the pocket of his shorts. Seconds later he pulled out a box. He opened it and inside was necklace with a dolphin attached to it. Sawyer pulled it out and handed it to Hazel. \"Wow it's very pretty,\" she said. \"I knew you'd like it,\" Sawyer said. \"Here let me put it on for you.\" He took the necklace out of her hand and began to put it around her neck. Hazel looked down at the necklace then at Sawyer. They stared into each others eyes, then slowly they both leaned in. Is this really happening? Hazel thought. Come on Sawyer just do it, Sawyer thought. Their moment was broken when they heard a commotion going on. Hazel and Sawyer immediately went to see what was going on. \"What's happened?\" Hazel asked. Phoebe came towards them. \"Sorry I spilled a bunch of fish,\" she told them. Are you kidding me? ! Sawyer thought. \"Why don't you guys take a break,\" Phoebe told them. Sawyer smiled at Hazel. \"Race you to the beach!\" he said, running. \"Not again!\" Hazel said, trying to chase after him. She ran after him down to the beach where they threw off their shoes and ran to the ocean. Sawyer splashed some water at Hazel and she did the same to him. They ran around and had a good time for a few minutes before getting bored. Sawyer and Hazel grabbed their shoes then walked along the beach. \"You know Hazel, you're really fun to be around,\" Sawyer said. \"Oh stop it,\" Hazel teased. Sawyer laughed. \"No really. You are,\" he said truthfully. Hazel looked at him and smiled. He was the sweetest person she's ever met. Was he gonna tell her? ... After a late dinner Sawyer was in his bedroom on his bed with a book. He began randomly flipping through pages, because he wasn't really interested in actually reading the book. He stopped when he reached a certain page of the book. There was something stuck inside the page. It was a small piece of paper in the shape of a rectangle. Sawyer grabbed the paper knowing exactly what it was. It was a photograph of Hazel. He remembered that he had printed it out on the day he realized he liked her. At first he thought it was ridicules that liked her so that's why he put it in the book. But now he was so sure of it. Sawyer took the picture and stared at it. \"Why can't I just tell you Hazel,\" he said to the picture. \"Whenever I look at you I get so nervous and I can't do it. And-\" Sawyer heard someone knocking on his door. Lorraine peered in. \"Hey Sawyer,\" she said. \"I was wondering where you went after dinner.\" \"I'm just thinking mom, I'm fine.\" Sawyer told her. Loraine walked up to the bed and sat down next to him. She raised one eyebrow. \"Are you sure?\" she asked knowingly. Sawyer sighed deeply. He shook his head. \"No,\" he said. \"You wanna tell me?\" Lorraine asked her son. Sawyer gave his mom the picture of Hazel. \"What's this for?\" she asked. \"I printed it out,\" he said. \"Oh so you like Hazel?\" Lorraine smiled. \"How did you know?!\" Sawyer said. \"I saw the looks in your eyes honey. I've just been waiting so long for you to admit it,\" she said. Sawyer laughed. \"Man I guess everybody knew,\" he said. \"What am I gonna do mom?\" \"Honey, you do what you think is right,\" Lorraine told him. She kissed his cheek then turned out his light. Sawyer fell fast asleep a few minutes later.[Chapter 3] Sorry this chapter took awhile. I just feel like my chapters are too cheesy and weird. Anyway thanks for the reviews they really make me smile. Enjoy! Sawyer woke up with only one thing on his mind: He was determined to tell Hazel that he liked her. He didn't know how and he didn't know when but he new he had to. In the kitchen Sawyer's mom had made a nice breakfast of eggs, pancakes, and bacon. Turkey bacon in fact., she was trying to heat more healthy. She placed two plates on the table, one for her and one for her son. Sawyer came into the kitchen. \"Hi honey, you going to the aquarium today?\" Loraine asked. Sawyer shrugged as he sat down at the table. \"You don't have to if you don't feel like it. I can talk to Clay.\" She told him \"No mom, it's okay.\" He said as he put eggs onto his plate. \"I have things to take care of.\" He muttered. At the boat house Hazel was getting ready for a run when her phone buzzed with a text. It was Sawyer. She opened it and began reading it. Sawyer: Hazel meet me in the crows nest at 8:00 am Hazel checked the time on her phone. It was 7:58 am. Guess I'm not going on that run anymore. She thought. I wonder what Sawyer's up to. She got to the crows nest and found Sawyer already there. He was leaning against the edge looking towards Hazel. She climbed up the stairs and up the ladder. \"You know I was about to go for a run.\" Hazel told Sawyer. \"Sorry.\" He said with a laugh. Hazel stood next to him. \"So what did you want?\" She asked him. \"Oh nothing.\" He said. She raised an eyebrow. \"Sawyer.\" Hazel said sternly. Sawyer sighed heavily. He was caught. \"Okay fine. The truth is Hazel… I thought about you more than Winter when I was away.\" He told her. What was he trying to say? Hazel thought. \"And,\" He started. \"Oh gosh this is so embarrassing.\" \"No, no go ahead.\" Hazel said. Sawyer turned his back towards her., so she couldn't see his blushing face. \"I like you more than a friend.\" He blurted out quickly, then held his breath. Hazel smiled then said, \"So do I.\" That made Sawyer turned around with a confused look on his face. \"What?\" \"I liked you too Sawyer.\" She told him. \"You know that one time when that girl from you're class kept talking to you?\" \"Yeah?\" \"Well, I was really jealous if you couldn't tell.\" She said. Sawyer smiled. \"What? I didn't notice.\" He teased. Hazel pushed him playfully. \"So what now?\" She asked. Sawyer put his hands in the air. \"We tell the world!\" He shouted. Hazel looked embarrassed. \"Sawyer!\" She exclaimed. \"I'm just kidding.\" He said. \"It's a beautiful day, lets go swim with the dolphins!\" Sawyer suggested. And so they did. They didn't even think about what they had said earlier. They just enjoyed the moments that were happening right then. That night Hazel was laying in her bed with a huge grin on her face. She felt like a weight had been lifted of her shoulders. Hazel was glad that they finally told each other but then she realized, what would happen next? Would they go on a date? How many dates do people go on before they become boyfriend and girlfriend? Did Sawyer even want to be her girlfriend? Hazel would also have to tell her dad all about this eventually. After all these thoughts made her head hurt, she finally snapped. \"Ugh, just go to bed Hazel. At least you told him.\" Hazel said to herself. She turned over on one side and then fell asleep… The tears were steaming down her face like a waterfall. She couldn't hold them in. Not when he was standing right there with his luggage and backpack in hand. Why did things like this have to happen?. She was a good person. She loved people, animals, nature. She was a bright happy human being. \" I have to go now.\" The boy said. He too had a steam of tears coming down his face, ever so slowly. \" It's not fair!\" She screamed as she hugged him tightly. He stroked her shoulder and told her everything was going to be okay, even though he new it wasn't . \" I really have to go, my mom is waiting in the car.\" He said. The boy walked slowly to his car and opened the door. \" I love you!\" The girl shouted. The boy looked out the window of the car and smiled with tears still streaming, then the car drove off. He was gone… \"I had a strange dream yesterday.\" Hazel told her dad the next day on their way to the aquarium. \"Really? What was it about\" He asked. \"Well there was this girl and she was saying goodbye to some guy that I'm guessing she liked or something.\" Hazel explained. \"But it was weird, it almost felt real. Like I was the girl.\" \"Oh, so who would have been the boy?\" Clay asked teasingly. \"I don't know dad. It's just a dream.\" Hazel said, even though she had a feeling it was Sawyer. A very strong feeling in fact. Clay laughed then put his arm around his daughter. \"You know Hazel, we got to have another one of those daddy and Hazel days.\" He told her. \"I haven't done that since I was eight dad.\" Hazel reminded him. \"I know, but it doesn't mean we can't do that again. I mean, we could go somewhere to eat and talk about things.\" He said. \"Okay, okay fine.\" She agreed. \"When do you want to do it?\" She asked. \"How about later this afternoon, lunch time?\" Clay suggested. \"Sure.\" She said. \"So,\" Clay began after they order their food at a local seafood restaurant. \"Got any secrets?\" He teased. Hazel rolled her eyes at him. \"Dad!\" She whined. \"Oh come on, you told all kinds of stuff to your mom.\" He said. Hazel suddenly felt sad. \"Yeah..\" She said quietly. \"Oh I'm sorry Hazel. I didn't mean to make you sad.\" He apologized. \"Look you can talk about whatever you want.\" \"Okay…\" Hazel thought for minute. \"How many dates did you and mom have before you guys became, you know, boyfriend and girlfriend?\" \"Wow such a specific question.\" He said. \"Well, we went on eight or nine dates before I officially told her.\" Clay told her. Hazel was surprised. \"That must have been hard, right?\" She asked. \"Oh, I thought it would be, but once I got around to it felt like the easiest thing in the world.\" \"So how did you do it?\" \"Well, the day before, I told her to meet me at our special place. I dressed up in a suit and tie and-\" Hazel stopped him and laughed. \"Really dad?\" \"Yes really, now let me finish.\" Clay said. \"So I waited five minutes and she finally came. Then I asked her to be my girlfriend.\" Hazel grinned. \"That's so sweet.\" Hazel beamed. Clay nodded, but felt a little sad in his heart. Then the waiter finally came over with there food. \"Let's eat.\" Clay said grabbing his fork and knife. It was a very great day for Hazel. Eh, that was an okay chapter I guess… You may think it's all happily ever after right? Well… You'll have to wait and see! Byeee. Oh and I'm gonna watch Dolphin Tale ( the first one) again soon! Eeeep I can't wait! Okay bye![Chapter 4] I don't know why I named this Do you Love Me. I just needed a title. Lol. So, I have lots of great things planned so be waiting! And I don't own Dolphin Tale or Starbucks . Oh and thanks, WiseGirl1993 for the Starbucks idea! It was a morning Sawyer never felt better in a such long time. He got out of bed with a huge grin on his face and walked over to the bathroom next to his bedroom. He grabbed a comb and brushed his hair to one side. Then Sawyer gave himself two thumbs up in the in the mirror. That day he was ready for school earlier than usual. Even though he hated going, he felt like today was going to be a good day. Nothing and no one would ruin it for him. Sawyer told his mom he was ready for her to drive him to school. Lorraine had promised him a while back that if he did well in school she wouldn't let him ride the bus. And Sawyer did everything he could so wouldn't have to. Lorraine heard her son and grabbed her car keys from the kitchen counter. She smiled at her son. \"Well you got up extra earlier today.\" Lorraine said. She walked over to him and put a hand up to his forehead. \"Are you feeling okay?\" She teased. Sawyer jerked away. \"Mom!\" He whined. Lorraine laughed then said, \"I'm sorry honey. I'm just happy you're early for once.\" Sawyer nodded with a side ways smile then put his backpack on his shoulder. \"You are going to school right?\" She joked. \"Yes mom.\" Sawyer said a little bit irritated. That was Lorraine's cue that it was time to go. The ride to Sawyer's high school only took about five minutes. The bus ride would of taken fifteen. When they reached the school's parking lot, Sawyer said goodbye to his mom, got out and shut the car door behind him. \"Here we go.\" Sawyer told himself. His first class was Algebra 2. It started at 7:30 am, but he had about five minutes till it actually started. That was enough time for him to get to his locker and grab the necessary books he needed for that class. Despite not having the best memory to help him with tests and quizzes, Sawyer remembered his locker combination very well. He had learned a trick from Hazel. Though she never had experience with lockers, it really worked. Sawyer unlatched the lock then opened his locker. There were pictures of Winter and Hope on the door and one of him and Hazel. He put his backpack inside after taking out his binder and algebra text book. \"Sawyer?\" He heard a voice call his name. Sawyer turned around to find Susie, a girl he had new before from his Marine biology class he taught. \"Hi Susie.\" He greeted with a smile. Susie stepped closer to him in a friendly way. \"Sawyer. I know you're busy after school, but I was wondering if you wanted to hang out. Maybe we could study or something?\" She asked him. Sawyer was surprised. \"Well, that is very nice of you Susie, but I have some things to do.\" He told her sincerely. He kind of felt bad that he had just turned her down, but he really couldn't hang out with her today. Susie was sad but she did her best to hide it from him. \"Oh, that's okay. I had stuff to do anyway.\" She spun around then walked away to her class. Hazel finished her last subject of her home schooling online. She shut her laptop closed and let out a sigh of relief. She loved school, but today she was feeling really anxious and wanted to get done as soon as she could. Hazel thought about what Sawyer was doing. I hope he had a good day. She thought, feeling empathy for him. Since she met him, Sawyer broke out of his shell, but he was still a little bit quiet at school and didn't have a ton of close friends. Hazel's phone buzzed on the table. She reached for it and checked her messages. I told Susie I couldn't hang out with her today. And now I feel bad. Sawyer's text read. Hazel cringed after reading Susie's name. What did you tell her? She typed. One minute later he typed back. Sawyer: I said I had stuff to do. Hazel: Well you do right? Sawyer: Yeah. of course… Hazel: Then don't feel bad Sawyer If you're busy then your busy. She only typed that because she was happy that he didn't accept Susie's offer. Hazel wasn't even sure that was the right thing to say. You finished with school? She typed again. Sawyer: Yes. I'll be over there soon. Clay was sitting next to the boat house while reading a book and sipping a cup of coffee when he noticed Sawyer walking towards him slowly. He sat down his cup down on the table and motioned his hands for Sawyer to come closer. He sat down hesitantly next to Clay. \"Sawyer, we've known each other for a while now, you don't have to be shy around me.\" Clay told him. \"I know.\" Sawyer said looking down at his brown shorts. Clay smiled then picked up his book and started reading again. Sawyer looked at him then looked away. Clay noticed his gesture then said, \"You need anything Sawyer?\" He asked the brown haired teen. \"Uh, yeah. I just wanted to ask you something.\" Sawyer said. Clay nodded his head waiting for Sawyer to speak. He was hesitant, but Sawyer finally managed to say something. \"I really like your daughter, Clay.\" He said. \"Yes, I can see that. You two have become great friends.\" Okay, Clay was not getting what Sawyer was saying. Or maybe he did, but he juts didn't want to admit it. \"Yes we have… but I wanted to know if I could take her out.\" Sawyer finished. Clay didn't say anything for a few minutes. \"Oh. You mean a date right?\" Clay asked. \"Yes… but if you don't want me too that's okay-\" Sawyer said, but Clay stopped him. \"No, no. It's fine. You go ahead and ask her.\" Clay told him. They exchanged smiles. After he got Clay's approval. Sawyer looked for Hazel around the aquarium. \" Hazel!\" Sawyer said, stopping her from walking ahead. She spun around. \"What?\" She asked. \"Do you want to go to Starbucks with me?\" He asked. \"You do remember I hate coffee right?\" Hazel reminded him. Sawyer felt so dumb. He had completely forgotten. \"Never mind then.\" He said walking away. Hazel grabbed his arm. \"But I never said I didn't want to go.\" Hazel said starring at him. Sawyer smiled. \"It's a date then!\" He told her. She smiled until she realized what he had just said. A date?! Sawyer asked me out on a date? Hazel thought as she watched Sawyer walk away. \"Meet you there!\" She heard him yell. Hazel went to her boat house to find something for her to wear. Although she could of left what she was wearing on, Hazel felt like she needed to change. She was about to open the door when someone grabbed her arm. Hazel looked to the side surprised to find her dad with a angry expression on his face. \"Dad?\" Hazel said. Clay folded his arms. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" He asked firmly. \"Huh?\" Hazel said very confused. \"You and Sawyer are together, right?\" He asked demanding an answer. \"No dad.\" Hazel told him. \"Where are you two going then?\" \"We're just going to Starbucks dad! It's only a few blocks away.! What's your problem?\" She said. Clay sighed realizing how harsh he was being. \"I'm sorry.\" He said. \"Just go.\" Hazel didn't bother to change, Sawyer was probably waiting for her anyway. Sawyer sat in a small booth at Starbucks patiently waiting for Hazel. He was nervous and excited at the same time. A few seconds later he saw a blonde haired girl walk in. Sawyer got up and greeted Hazel like he hadn't seen her in days. \"Hi.\" She said. Sawyer noticed the lack of excitement in her voice. They both sat down in the booth Sawyer was sitting at earlier. \"What's wrong?\" He asked her. \"My dad.\" She said. \"We kind of had a fight.\" \"Can I ask what it was about?\" Sawyer said. \"I don't know. It feels like he doesn't want us together.\" She told him. \"I'm sure that's not the case.\" Sawyer said trying to make her look at the situation differently. Hazel looked up at him. \"I hope your right.\" There you go. Chapter four. Please review! I love your feedback! :)[Chapter 5] Here is chapter 5! Please read and review :) Hazel paced back and forth as she waited for her dad to come out of the house. She had been meaning to confront him ever since what happened yesterday. Something was obviously bothering her dad and she had to figure it out. \"Hazel, what are you doing?\" Clay asked his daughter after he opened the door of their house. \"Shouldn't you be starting your school work?\" He told her. \"Yes dad, but I need to talk to you.\" Hazel said. They both sat down at the small table next to the boat house. \"First, I just want to say how sorry I am for how I acted yesterday\" Clay apologized. \"Well that's what I wanted to talk about.\" She said. \"Why did you act that way?\" She asked him. \"I don't, I guess I just wasn't ready.\" He told her. Clay sighed and looked down. Hazel was confused. \"Ready for what?\" She asked. \"For you to grow up.\" He said. \"But dad, I'm still your daughter.\" She said. \"Yeah but now you got a boyfriend.\" He said smiling. \"Dad! Sawyer's not my boyfriend.\" Hazel exclaimed with an embarrassed smile. \"Yet.\" Clay finished. Hazel smiled then got up to give him a hug. \"Thanks dad.\" She told him. \"For what?\" \"For not staying mad.\" \"Your welcome.\" He said hugging her. When Sawyer got home from school he went into his house to find his mom and a guy he had never seen before sitting at the kitchen table. Sawyer awkwardly walked in slowly. Lorraine noticed her son coming in and greeted him. \"Oh hey Sawyer, this is Ron. I met him at the park. He's on a business trip here.\" Ron smiled at him. \"Your mom has told me a lot about you. She says your quite the expert on Marine Biology.\" Sawyer nodded. \"Uh mom, I'll be in my room studying.\" He told her. \"Okay. Dinner will be ready at five.\" Sawyer sat on his bed with a weird expression on his face. Who the heck was that guy and why was he in his house? I mean, his mom did explain why he was here, but didn't she just meet him? Sawyer sighed as he opened his laptop that was sitting on his side table. He began to work on his essay for school. The topic was, what kinds of things influences you in your life? That would be easy for Sawyer. Winter. Winter influenced him in many ways. Three hours later Sawyer had a full four paged essay and it was five o clock. Lorraine called him from the kitchen for dinner. Sawyer got up and was surprised to find Ron still there. \"Mom, what is he doing here?\" Sawyer politely whispered, hoping Ron wouldn't hear him. \"I invited him to stay for dinner.\" Lorraine said smiling. Sawyer sat down without saying a word. \"Hey Sawyer, why don't you tell me all about the work you do at the aquarium?\" Ron asked him. Sawyer looked at him, then at Lorraine. \"Mom, I'm actually not hungry, can I go to my room?\" He asked her. Lorraine looked a little disappointed. \"Fine, go ahead.\" She told him. Hazel and Sawyer were on pool duty, which meant they had to scrub them clean. They each started on their own side of the pool. After about a few minutes of getting in to it, Hazel and Sawyer began talking to each other. \"So I talked to my dad.\" Hazel told him. \"Everything's okay now.\" \"That's great.\" Sawyer said, looking at her with a grin. \"What's been going on with you?\" She asked him as she continued to work. \"My mom met this guy and now he suddenly wants to stay at our house all the time.\" Sawyer told her. \"It's kind of weird.\" He said. Hazel laughed. \"Hey at least your mom is meeting people. My dad won't even talk to other women besides the one's who work here.\" She said. \"Hey Sawyer!\" They heard a voice say. Sawyer immediately turned his head because his name was being called. It was none other than Susie. What is she doing here? Hazel thought. \"How did you get in here?\" Hazel asked her. She was trying not to sound angry, but it still came out that way. Susie glared at Hazel. \"Your dad let me in.\" She said. For some reason Hazel didn't want to be believe her. \"I got to get something, I'll be right back.\" Sawyer said to girls. Susie smiled at him as he walked past her. Hazel ignored her and began to finish scrubbing the pool. \"Stay away from him.\" She heard Susie say. Hazel looked up at her. \"I'm sorry what?\" Hazel said. Susie walked over to Hazel. \"Stay away from Sawyer, Hazel.\" Susie said. This time clarifying who the he was. \"Were just doing our job here.\" Hazel confronted her. \"I meant outside of work.\" Susie told her. \"And what if I don't?\" Hazel asked her with confidence. \"Then I will do this.\" Susie pushed her with all her strength causing Hazel to fall backwards and hitting her head slightly on the edge of the pool. At that moment, Sawyer walked in. \"What happened?!\" He exclaimed. Susie shrugged, and said \"She must of slipped or something.\" Sawyer looked at her then jumped in the pool to save Hazel. \"Are you okay?\" He asked her, all out of breath. Hazel rubbed the back of her head. \"Ow.\" She said in pain. \"What happened?\" He asked, hoping to get a different answer. \"I don't know.\" Hazel said. \"All I remember is that someone was pushing me.\" She told him. Sawyer thought for a moment then looked to find Susie. She was gone. \"Let me get your dad, I'll be right back!\" He said. \"No! Sawyer don't leave me.\" Hazel said. She had a feeling Susie would come back. \"It'll just take a second.\" Sawyer said. \"Okay.\" She replied. Sawyer got up and ran to find Clay. Hazel sat up and scratched the back of her head looking for any blood. That's when she realized someone was behind her. \"You're still here?\" Hazel said to Susie. \"Did you really think I would just push you in the pool and then run off with out apologizing?\" Susie said. \"Yes.\" Hazel said. \"Well you're right.\" Susie said. She leaned in closer to Hazel. \"This was your first warning.\" She told her. \"You probably, don't want a second.\" Susie grinned than walked away. Should I tell Sawyer about this? Hazel asked herself. She couldn't believe Susie was actually threatening her. Hey guys, thanks for reading chapter 5. Sorry it's a little short. Anyway, I really didn't want to make Susie a mean character, but I needed some other conflict to go with the main conflict if the story. So please don't hate me! Oh, and I made this Hazel and Sawyer video if you want to watch it. My channel is \"therealmaximan\" Or you can search \"Hazel and Sawyer How to Save a Life\" on Youtube! Ps Do you think I should change the title of this story? I feel like it doesn't fit with the whole I have in my head. idk I guess it doesn't matter.[Chapter 6] So I guess this story is kind of AU since Susie is actually super nice. Beside that I guess there all in character. (I hope) But anyway, thanks for your reviews, they really keep me going. (I know I say that every time but I mean it) My goal is to get to more than 50 reviews, but even if I don't its okay! I don't own Dolphin Tale. \"So are you sure your head is fine?\" Sawyer asked Hazel as they sat in the crow's nest the next morning. \"Yes Sawyer. My dad checked it.\" She reassured him. \"And you're sure you don't know what happened?\" He asked. Should I tell him Susie did it? Hazel thought. She decided not to. \"I think I just slipped or something. Really, I'm fine Sawyer. Don't worry.\" \"I know, I just care about you.\" Sawyer said. He felt the cheesiness in his voice, but he didn't care. \"Thank you.\" She said. \"You, know? I really need to take you on a proper date.\" He told her. \"And what's your idea of a proper date?\" She joked. \"I'll surprise you.\" Sawyer said grinning. \"Great, and in the mean time you really need to get to school. Does your mom even know your here?\" Hazel wondered. \"No.\" Sawyer said grabbing his backpack, and climbing down the ladder of the nest. \"And we're going to keep it that way!\" He shouted from below. Hazel shook her head and laughed. \"That boy is really something.\" She said to herself with a smile. \"Mom, I'm home!\" Sawyer called as he came into the house. He threw his backpack on the floor. No one answered. \"Mom?\" He said again. \"I'm in the back!\" He heard Lorraine shout. Sawyer opened the back door and found his mom and Ron sitting on lawn chairs in the grass of their backyard. Ron looked up from the newspaper he was reading. \"Hello Sawyer.\" He greeted with a warm smile. Sawyer tried to return the smile. \"Hi.\" He said. Sawyer looked over to Lorraine. \"Mom, I need to talk to you.\" He told her. Lorraine nodded with a smile. She got up from her chair and walked over to her son. Sawyer looked at Ron then at his mom. Lorraine got the message that Sawyer wanted to talk in private. They both stepped in the house. \"So what is it honey?\" She asked him. Sawyer took a deep breath. \"Mom, I'm taking Hazel on our official first date tonight.\" Sawyer said. Lorraine smiled then hugged her son. \"Sawyer, I'm so happy for you two.\" She said, still hugging him. Sawyer grinned from the other end of the hug. \"Thank you mom.\" He said. After Lorraine went back outside to Ron, Sawyer realized he still had to tell Hazel where they were going. Meet me at the seafood restaurant in town 6:00 He typed into his phone. Sawyer smiled as he pressed send. After reading the text, Hazel told her dad about it, then began picking out what she should wear. She asked Phoebe to help her decide. Hazel pulled out a red dress out of her closet and showed it to Phoebe. She shook her head. Hazel tried on ten dresses before she found the right one. A light blue one, with white polka dots. Phoebe smiled at Hazel after she put it on. \"You look wonderful.\" She told hazel. \"Thanks.\" Hazel said. Phoebe said goodbye to her, then Hazel went to find her dad. \"Dad I'm ready to go.\" She told him. Clay looked at his daughter and smiled. \"Wow Hazel, you look beautiful.\" He told her. Hazel grinned then hugged her dad. She thanked him then they went to the car. Back at his house, Sawyer was picking out various shirts and pants to wear. He decided on a plain white t-shirt and blue jeans. For his hair, he added some gel and then combed it to the side. After he was satisfied on how he looked, Sawyer told his mom hi was ready to go. Lorraine complimented him on how he looked, then they headed to the car. Sawyer got to the restaurant before Hazel. That gave him time to find a table and figure out what they would order. Sawyer went inside the restaurant and was greeted by a receptionist. Sawyer told her that he needed a table for two. She nodded, then guided him to the table. The receptionist gave him two menus. Now all Sawyer had to was patiently wait for Hazel to come. I hope she read my text. He thought. How embarrassing would that have been if she never showed up. Sawyer laughed at himself. Of course she read his text. Hazel never missed one from him. Suddenly, Sawyer felt nervous, his palms were sweating and his heart was beating \"Hi.\" He heard Hazel say. Sawyer looked up. \"Hi Hazel…\" He said. \"Wow, you look amazing.\" \"Thank you.\" She said sitting down in front of him. \"So shall we order?\" He asked her with a smile. They were only a few minutes into their meal, but Sawyer and Hazel were already deep into conversation. Sawyer told her about Ron and how he kept showing up at his house. Hazel was deciding if she should tell him about Susie. After about minutes of back and forth in her mind. She finally decided to. \"Sawyer, I really have to tell you something.\" Hazel said. \"Sure, what is it?\" Sawyer said. \"It was actually Susie's fault I fell into the pool. She pushed me.\" Hazel told him. Sawyer looked at her in disbelief. \"Really? Wow, that's not like her.\" He said. \"I know.\" She agreed,. \"But people can be surprising.\" \"Why would she do that in the first place?\" He wondered. \"Well she did threaten me.\" She told him. Sawyer was surprised. \"Do you want me to talk to her for you? I could talk to her.\" He said. \"No. This is my problem.\" Hazel said. \"And lets not worry about her.\" \"Your right.\" Sawyer said. \"Let's just enjoy right now.\" Hazel and Sawyer exchanged grins, then finished the rest of their meal with smiles. Sorry this is a short chapter, but it's just a filler to prepare for the next chapter. Thanks for reading! Oh and I just realized everybody smiles a lot in this story lol. Follow my instagram: hazleandsawyer[Chapter 7] Okay. So after about a week (sorry) I finally have the courage to post another chapter :/ I know my writing isn't great, but this is practice for me so I can improve in the future. I tried to proof read more this time so I hope it's somewhat better. Other than that I don't own Dolphin Tale Hazel finished her school work early for the day so she could feed Winter and the rest of the dolphins. As she was giving them their meal, she noticed a familiar face walking towards her. It was Jordan, the girl Sawyer introduced to her. Maybe she's a volunteer here. Hazel smiled, as Jordan approached her. \"Hi!\" She said, returning a smile to Hazel. \"Hey.\" Hazel said. \"So do you volunteer here now?\" She asked. Jordan nodded happily. \"Is that alright?\" Jordan asked. \"Yes of course!\" Hazel said. \"In fact, I need some help feeding the dolphins.\" Hazel told her. \"But that's your job.\" She said. \"Yeah, but it's easier with two people.\" Hazel said as she offered Jordan a bucket of fish and a net. The girls walked over to the edge of the pool. \"So do I just grab some fish in the net and then drop it in the water?\" Jordan asked her. Hazel nodded before grabbing her own bucket and net. \"Hey, can I ask your some advice?\" Hazel asked Jordan. She was hesitant at first to ask her since she barely knew Jordan, but she needed to talk to someone. \"Well, you asked the right person because it just so happens I'm great with helping people.\" Jordan said. Hazel felt relieved, maybe Jordan could actually help her. \"There's this girl...\" Hazel started. \"And she likes Sawyer?\" Jordan interrupted. \"Well yes, but that's not what's bothering me.\" Hazel told her. \"She's been threatening me because I'm around Sawyer all the time.\" \"Seriously?\" Jordan asked. \"Yeah. And I can't decide if I'm afraid, or if I should face her.\" Hazel said. \"Ooh, I'd just stay away from her. The more you mess with her, the more she's going to want to mess with you.\" Jordan said. Hazel thought about it for a moment. \"Hmm, I guess your right.\" Hazel said. She was not going to let Susie bother her. At least for now. Sawyer was in his bedroom trying to read a sports magazine, when really he was thinking. He had lots on his mind, but the one thing that worried Sawyer was Susie. Sawyer had met Susie and she seemed very nice. Why was Susie trying to hurt Hazel? Sawyer shook his head telling his mind that he didn't know why. He then switched his sports magazine to an animal magazine. He hated sports, but his mom bought him a bunch of magazines hoping he would find a love for one. Sawyer random flipped through the pages trying to get his mind of things. He started reading an article about an elephant who was best friends with a dog, when he heard people shuffling into his house. It was Lorraine and Ron and they were talking about something. Curiously, Sawyer hopped off his bed and pressed his ear against his door, trying to make out what they were saying. He heard Ron talking about how he married once before, but he doesn't have any children, and that he lives in Washington. Washington DC? Sawyer thought. No, Washington state. Sawyer tried to hear the rest of the conversation but they kept moving farther away. He shrugged, then went back to his bed. Immediately after, someone knocked on his door. Lorraine came in. \"Do you want something mom?\" Sawyer asked. \"I just wanted to see if you were home.\" She said. Sawyer nodded. Before leaving, Lorraine told Sawyer that Ron would be staying for dinner again. That was a close one, Sawyer sighed. Sawyer was not the type of person to plan surprises, people usually planned ones for him. But today, a great idea to surprise Hazel came upon him and he had to do it. And with a little help from her dad, Sawyer could pull it off. He just needed to see if Clay would agree to it first. Sawyer found Clay in his usual place and he explained his idea to him. Clay gladly agreed to help and they began to set up Sawyer's \"secret surprise\". In about two hours, everything was all set. Now all Sawyer had to do was send one text to Hazel and hope it would all work out. When you find an arrow, read the clues and follow them. It said. Hazel was inside the crow's nest when she read the text. At first she was confused, but then when Hazel looked around, she found a red paper arrow stuck to one of the docks. Hazel smiled as she read the clues given. Hazel followed every clue until it led her to the beach. She didn't notice anything special. \"Is this a joke?\" Hazel said aloud. \"Nope.\" Clay said from behind. Hazel turned around to find her dad. \"Follow me.\" He said extending out his arm. Hazel took it and let her dad led the way. Soon, right in front of her was a picnic set for two. Sawyer was standing in front of her wearing a suit and holding flowers. Hazel's mind immediately thought about her dad when he asked her mom to be his girlfriend. Was Sawyer doing the same? \"What is this?\" She asked. Sawyer walked over to her. \"What do you think?\" He smiled. \"It's a picnic on the beach.\" \"You did all this?\" She asked. Sawyer nodded. \"With the help of your dad.\" Hazel smiled and her dad and gave if a hug. He smiled and thought it was time to leave the two alone. \"You know,\" Sawyer said, after their last bite of food. \"Having a nice dinner wasn't the reason I planned this surprise.\" He told her. \"Really? That what was it?\" She asked. Sawyer took a deep breath while he stood up. Hazel did the same. \"Hazel, I've wanted to ask you this ever since I got back from the SEA program...\" He began. Hazel looked into Sawyer's eyes, eager to hear what he had to say. \"Would you be my girlfriend?\" Sawyer asked. \"Uh-\" Hazel tried to speak. \"Oh, you don't want to? That's okay.\" Sawyer said. \"No, no. I've been waiting for you to ask me that.\" Hazel smiled at him. \"Really?\" \"Really.\" \"So?\" Sawyer said, waiting for an official answer. Hazel laughed. \"Yes Sawyer, I'd love to be your girlfriend.\" \"Really?! Yes!\" Sawyer said punching his fist in the air. They both smiled. It was awkward for a moment until the silence broke as they leaned in for their first kiss. It was short and sweet and it made them smile. But little did they know, someone was watching them. Um so yeah. I hope this is a good chapter. I don't really know if I like it. But whatever. :/[Chapter 8] The next day, Hazel smiled as she scrubbed the docks near the boat house. Clay noticed her beaming grin and he knew that she was extra happy that day. Hazel hummed a song to herself as she tried to remove the excessive amount of bird poop that trailed along the dock. \"You know, you were never this happy to clean bird poop before,\" Clay said, teasing his daughter. He let out a chuckle, while folding his arms across his chest. Hazel glared at her father. \"I'm just in a really good mood today,\" she told him. \"Would being Sawyer's girlfriend have anything to do with it?\" Clay smiled. \"Maybe...\" Hazel said, beginning to blush. Clay patted her back and gave her an I'm-sorry look. He then left her to continue cleaning. The rest of the morning for Hazel, followed with school. She tried reading her text books, but found it vary hard to concentrate. Wow, boys can really mess with your brain, she thought. Hazel smiled, picturing Sawyer in her mind as she finished school. ... Sawyer came home from school with a smile on his face. He was so glad that he had asked Hazel to be his girlfriend, he couldn't keep still the whole day. He entered the house, expecting it to be just his mom, but when he opened the door he found Ron sitting on his couch. Again. What was that guy's problem? Did he have no friends? Sawyer thought. He awkwardly walked in and was about to head to his bedroom, but Lorraine stopped him. \"Sawyer, I've got exciting news,\" Lorraine said to her son. The smile on her face was not something Sawyer had seen in a while. Oh no he better not have proposed or something. That'd be weird, they only just met . \"Yeah, what is it?\" Sawyer asked. Lorraine looked at Ron then back at Sawyer. \"Ron has invited us to go visit his home town in Seattle,\" Lorraine said, excitement full in her voice. \"He's going back and he thought he could take us.\" Sawyer didn't know what to say. He was glad that it wasn't a proposal, but he still was shocked. \"That sounds great,\" Sawyer said, faking a smile. Lorraine smiled back, not knowing her son's true feelings. \"How long will we be there?\" he asked. Sawyer was hoping it was only for a day or two. He didin't want to be away from Winter and the dolphins for so long again. After all, he had just got back from a three month trip. \"A week. Doesn't that sound fun?\" Lorraine said. Sawyer nodded and quickly darted to his room to avoid any further talk of the so called \"fun trip.\" \"Yeah, sounds fun,\" he said to himself, as he lay on his bed. \"If you call fun, spending a week in a boring city, and with someone who's practically a stranger to you.\" Sawyer sighed and he turned over on his side. He saw his cell phone sitting on his desk, and he debated if he should text Hazel about the trip. He contemplated for what seemed like hours, but he finally grabbed his phone. He started a new imessage to Hazel. Sawyer: Hey I've got something to tell you, the text read. Seconds later Hazel sent a message back. Hazel: Yeah? A smiley emoji followed. Sawyer: That Ron guy I was telling you about invited me and my mom to go to Seattle with him. For a week. Hazel: Seattle? ? Uh oh, was she mad? Hazel: That sounds so fun! She had added a lot of emojis on that one. Sawyer: Yeah but that means I'm going to leave Winter again. Hazel: Sawyer, she'll be fine. It's just a week. Sawyer: Hey I got an Idea... Hazel: oh no... Sawyer: No for real though. What if I asked my mom if you could come with us? Hazel: Nah, I wouldn't want to intrude Sawyer: No, Ron is the one intruding on me and my mom. Hazel: Sawyer! Sawyer: It's true though... So will you come? Haze: If your mom says yes. Sawyer: Cool Hazel: Can't wait Sawyer grinned as he put his phone back down. He lay back on his bed and wondered if Ron wouldn't mind another guest on the trip. He hoped he wouldn't. Spending time with Hazel could mean he could get to know her even more. A/N: I've got lots planned for this story so there might be lots of chapters. Stay tuned! :)[Chapter 9] A/N: Thank you so so so so so much for the reviews. I love and appreciate them all! ... Sawyer felt a little better about the trip to Seattle with Ron and his mom, but only if Hazel could come. He hoped his mom would say yes, but more importantly Clay. If Hazel wasn't able to come, he would have to suffer through a whole week with Ron, and he knew he would surely be bored to death. It's not that his mom was boring or anything, he just wanted someone his age to accompany him. Sawyer anxiously waited in the living room after school for his mom so he could ask her. He didn't know why he was so nervous. Why would she say no? Maybe because she only wanted it to be a family trip? But Ron was not family. He shook the possible negative reasons out of his head when he saw Lorraine coming into the house. \"I got your text. You wanted to ask me something?\" Lorraine said, bringing in groceries to the kitchen table. Sawyer nodded. \"Um, yeah I was wondering if maybe Hazel could come with us? You know, so I don't get bored in Seattle?\" he asked hopefully. Lorraine walked over to him and smiled. \"You know I was just talking to Ron about that. He said he would love for Hazel to come,\" she said. Sawyer grinned. \"Great, I'll tell Hazel!\" He immediately went to his room to text Hazel. Sawyer: My mom said yes, what about your dad? Hazel: Cool, my dad said yes too! He said it would good for me, and that I can work on some school while I'm there. Sawyer: Great! I can't wait! :) Hazel: :) Sawyer smiled to himself as she thought about all the fun things he and Hazel could do together. He new that they were going to have the best time ever. ... Hazel sat with her feet wading in the pool as she watched Winter peacefully swim. She was thinking about the trip to Seattle with Sawyer, when she sensed someone was behind her. Hazel turned around and was surprised to find Susie standing in front of her. Hazel hadn't seen her since the incident, so she wondered what Susie wanted. \"So I heard your going to Seattle with Sawyer,\" Susie said. Her arms were folded across her chest and she had a serious expression. \"Yeah, um how did you know?\" Hazel asked curiously. \"Sawyer told me,\" she said. \"Really?\" Susie nodded. Hazel was beginning to wonder why Susie was suddenly being nice to her. It seemed very suspicious. \"Have fun.\" Susie smiled, but it looked fake. Then she spun around and walked away. \"That was really weird,\" Hazel muttered to herself. She shrugged it off and went back to watching Winter. ... Three days later, Sawyer was packed and ready for the trip. His mom and him drove with Ron to pick up Hazel on their way to the airport. Sawyer was anxious on the way there, but he loosened up once they reached Hazel's house. He walked over to the front door of the boat house and knocked on the door. Clay answered and he smiled. \"Hazel, Sawyer's here,\" Clay called to his daughter. Hazel showed up seconds later with her backpack and luggage in tow. Sawyer smiled, and Hazel said goodbye to her father. \"Have fun, and don't forget to do some school while your there,\" Clay told her. Hazel rolled her eyes. \"I will Dad.\" She kissed his cheek and walked with Sawyer to Lorraine's car. They sat next to each other in the back while Ron drove and Lorraine sat in the passenger seat. The ride to the airport took a long dreaded hour. Sawyer and Hazel messed around on their iphones, and played fun car games to pass the time. They felt like little kids as they played eye spy, and counted how many Beatle cars they saw. Sawyer counted the most, he had won that game which made Hazel very angry. She was a very competitive person. They finally drove into the airport and found a spot in the car garage. First they had to check in their bags before they could do anything else. Sawyer offered to help bring Hazel's bags, but she said she was fine. The four of them got everything checked in and got through security. They boarded the plane, but had to wait for a few more minutes until they actually had to take off. Sawyer pulled out his phone when he felt that he was getting a text. He saw that it was from Susie. \"Who's that?\" Hazel said trying to look at his phone. Sawyer quickly put his phone away. He didn't want to bother Hazel with Susie stuff, so he didn't tell her. \"No one,\" Sawyer said. He smiled at her. Hazel shrugged and lay back in her seat. The flight was about to take off.[Chapter 10] Sawyer's idea of the trip was exactly what he had expected. His mom and Ron spent most of there time together, while Hazel and Sawyer did there own things. They went on the Space Needle together. Looked at some sharks and dolphins at the aquarium. (Which weren't nearly as great as Winter.) They even checked out a Star Wars exhibit in the Science Center. The whole day Sawyer had been avoiding all the texts he was getting from Susie. He was afraid Hazel would find out what was going on. She finally did on their last day of the trip. \"You keep getting texts, why aren't you answering them?\" Hazel asked him, while she packed her bags in Ron's living room. He had a big house with a lot of guest rooms, so that's where they had stayed for the whole week. \"How did you know I got a text?\" Sawyer asked. He thought he had turned his phone on silent the other day. \"Your phone has been vibrated all day.\" Hazel pointed to his pocket where is iphone bulged out. Sawyer felt dumb and embarrassed. Now he felt obligated to answer Susie's texts. \"You know whoever your ignoring, their probably very mad at you,\" Hazel told him. Did she know who it was? Sawyer thought. He nodded and took his phone out of his pocket. He walked across the room, to a more \"private place\" to check what Susie had sent him. There was too many to read at the moment, so he just told her that he was sorry he hadn't been answering them at all. Sawyer said nothing about ignoring her though. \"You kids ready to go?\" Lorraine asked as she came into the living room of Ron's home. \"Yeah we've been ready for a long time, where have you been?\" Sawyer told her. Lorraine pointed back at the kitchen. \"I was just talking with Ron,\" she said to her son who suddenly sounded like he was in a bad mood. \"Whatever,\" he mumbled. Hazel could hear him and she gave him wide-eyed a look. \"Well, if you guys are all ready we should get going,\" Lorraine told the two. Just as she said that, Ron came into the room with a suite case. \"He's coming with us?\" Sawyer whispered to Hazel. She nudged his arm hard. \"Ouch,\" he whispered back. \"Clearly you don't understand anything,\" Hazel told him as she got up from the couch where they were sitting. She pulled her luggage behind her. … They were on their flight back to Florida when Sawyer wanted to ask Hazel something. \"So how come I don't understand anything?\" \"Huh?\" Hazel said, looking up from the magazine she was reading. \"Back at his house you told me, 'clearly you don't understand anything,' \" he reminded her. \"Oh yeah that,\" Hazel remembered. \" I over heard your mom and Ron talking…\" \"And?\" \"You really should learn to like him, it's obvious your mom likes him a lot,\" she explained. \"But what were they talking about?\" Sawyer asked her. He was so curious now. \"That doesn't matter,\" she said, then went back to reading her magazine. This was annoying Sawyer so bad. He wanted know what Hazel had over heard. Then he remembered about the texts. It seemed like Hazel wanted to know who they were from. Well then if she wouldn't tell him about Ron and his mom's conversation, then he wouldn't tell her about Susie's texts. Although he felt satisfied, deep down he still didn't feel right. Short, but I needed to get a chapter up. More stuff coming soon...[Chapter 11] Sawyer didn't get much sleep on the plane. For some reason he had a strange feeling in his stomach, and he didn't know why. Hazel on the other hand slept like a baby. She didn't wake up a single time. And when they landed in Florida, Sawyer even had to shake her awake. \"Hazel, we landed,\" Sawyer whispered to her so she wouldn't be startled. She woke up and rubbed her sleepy eyes. Ron, Lorraine and the two teens were one of the first to get off the plane. They had to walk a couple minutes to get to where Ron had parked his car. Hazel still felt tired, and she was walking a bit unsteady. Once, Sawyer had to stop her from almost falling. \"Whoa there,\" Sawyer said, grabbing Hazel's free arm. \"A little wobbly there.\" \"Yeah,\" Hazel said as she rubbed her forehead. \"It's weird. I usually only get this way when I feel like something is wrong with one of the animals back at the aquarium. Some strange thing I get.\" \"Huh,\" Sawyer said almost to himself, but loud enough for her to hear. He then rubbed his forehead like Hazel had done. \"It must just be jet lag or something.\" \"Probably,\" Hazel replied. When they got to Ron's car, Sawyer shrugged off the same weird feeling he felt earlier. He sat next to Hazel again, but they didn't talk as much. The car ride was boring so Hazel decided to sleep more. They arrived at Clearwater where Ron dropped her off. She was greeted by her dad who was grinning at first. But when she went up to say hello, his face turned serious. \"Hazel something happened while you were there, you need to come quick,\" Clay explained to her daughter. From the car, Sawyer saw the commotion and immediately wanted to get out. He flung the car door open frantically, and raced after an already running Hazel. Lorraine couldn't figure out what was up, but she told Ron to stay put until Sawyer came back. \"Hazel,\" Sawyer called, out of breath from the running. \"What's wrong?\" Hazel was next to her dad when he saw the expression on her face. It was motionless, but still very dark. He could see her eyes water as she looked into the pool. Sawyer cautiously looked down to see what she was seeing. Two dolphins were floating at the bottom of the pool. And no they were not hanging around there for fun. Those were the two babies they had rescued a week ago, and now they were dead. Hazel wiped her eyes with her sleeve as her dad whispered , \"I'm sorry\". Things like this had happened before, but it would always hit Hazel hard. On the other end of the pool, Sawyer felt deep empathy for her. He shifted around, not knowing what to do in this surprising situation. \"There you are!\" He heard a voice coming from behind that startled him. Sawyer turned around to find Susie in front of him. \"What happened?\" he asked her. He assumed she had been coming to volunteer when they were in Seattle. \"You didn't read all my texts,\" Susie reminded him. \"Hazel's dad tried calling you but that wasn't working so he asked me to text you.\" she explained. Sawyer slapped his forehead. That's why she was constantly texting him. Now he felt stupid for not answering his cell phone. \"Ohhh,\" another voice joined in. After Hazel had heard what they were talking about, she had to come over. \"That's who you were ignoring,\" she said to him with a grin. She wanted Susie to know loud and clear. \"You were trying to ignore me?\" Susie asked him. Hazel laughed a little, but she was surprised that Susie hadn't kicked her out of the three way conversation. Sawyer gave Hazel a look that said shut up. \"No, I wasn't trying to ignore you,\" Sawyer defended himself. \"Then how come you didn't answer any of my messages?\" Susie wondered. \"It was only because...\" Sawyer started, but trailed off when he saw that Hazel was patently waiting for an answer. He couldn't say it though. Not to her at least. \"Never mind,\" he said instead. \"Sorry I ignored you Susie.\" \"That's okay,\" she said. \"At least you know now.\" Then Susie left to talk to Clay. Sawyer nodded and then followed Hazel. She wasn't going to take another look at the dolphins so she just decided to chill in the crows nest. Hazel didn't notice Sawyer following, she minded her own business until she felt someone behind her. \"Hey,\" Sawyer said softly to her. Hazel didn't say anything. She looked down at the floor as she sat against the nest. \"Can I sit with you?\" he asked, even though he was already positioning himself next to her. \"I just wish...\" Hazel said with a sniff. \"What?\" he asked in a calm tone. \"I wish I shouldn't of came with you on that trip,\" she said. \"Why not, we had fun?\" \"Yeah but all this stuff happened while we were gone. I wish I could of been there to help you know.\" Sawyer's heart sunk a little. \"Hazel, don't tell me you think it's your fault?\" \"I don't know...\" \"Yes you do know. It was not your fault,\" Sawyer said to her. He was trying his best to make her feel better. But clearly it wasn't working, because Hazel started crying again. \"Sorry Sawyer,\" she said. \"For what?\" \"For getting sort of mad at you yesterday.\" \"Mad? You didn't seem mad at all.\" Sawyer scooted a little closer to Hazel, and she did the same. She placed her head on his shoulder and the tears stopped. Hazel felt a little better knowing that he was trying to comfort her. \"Hi, hi,\" a cheerful voice gradually came that interrupted their brief moment. Susie was making her way up the ladder of the nest. Sawyer felt awkward because of how close he was next to Hazel. Know one had ever seen them like that. He quickly jerked a little to get out of the position. Hazel felt the weird tension, and looked away. \"Hi Susie.\" Sawyer smiled. Hazel, as usual said nothing to her. \"Hi Hazel,\" Susie said. Okay that was weird. Susie had just seen Hazel about five minutes ago, a nd she was being nice to her. Was she the same Susie that had pushed her in the pool a couple weeks ago? Something was up. Hazel just gave her fake smile. Mostly because she was still sad, but also because she didn't feel like talking to her. \"You guys busy?\" she asked. Um, did she not just see us together? Hazel thought, annoyed. \"Nope,\" Sawyer told her. No?! Are kidding me? Susie joined them and she sat down near the ladder. For the next few minutes, Hazel had to listen to them talk. After another minute, she had enough. She felt like the third wheel and she had to leave. \"Where you going? Sawyer asked her when he noticed her leaving. Hazel eyed Susie, telling her to move away from the ladder so she could climb down. Susie scooted away and sat closer to Sawyer. Without looking back, Hazel continued to climb down the crows nest. Sawyer sighed to himself. He suddenly felt something weird between him and Hazel. It was nothing like he had felt before. ... So if you haven't noticed, I change the summary. I think I made it better... I still don't like the title of this story, but I'm not going to change it because I don't want to confuse people... Anywho, thanks for taking your time to read my lame story! And thanks for the reviews![Chapter 12] Sawyer got home from school feeling very tired. He didn't sleep well the other night, because he had a lot on his mind. Lorraine heard her son come in and she came from the kitchen to greet him. She noticed his expression, and automatically asked him how he was. \"I'm going to take a walk mom,\" Sawyer said, without answering her. \"Where?\" she asked. \"The beach,\" he replied. Sawyer put his backpack on the couch, and then went out the door. He trudged along the sidewalk, making his way to the beach near by. He had his hands in the pocket of his pants as he kicked rocks along the way. When he reached the beach, he walked along the edge next to the water. He didn't care that his shoes were getting wet. \"Hi Sawyer!\" He turned around to find Susie in front of him. \"How are you?\" she asked him. \"Okay, I guess...\" he replied. \"Do you want to talk?\" Susie asked Sawyer. He just shrugged. \"I don't know. Yesterday I was just feeling something…\" he started, but didn't finish. \"Never mind.\" He shook his head. \"What?\" she said. \"I don't want to put this all on you,\" he told her. \"I'm just going to talk to Hazel.\" \"Oh.\" Sawyer smiled at her and started to walk in the direction of Clear Water. Susie stood there for a moment, then followed him without him knowing. He stopped to look behind himself, and saw her. Sawyer motioned for her to come along, and she did. At the aquarium, Sawyer went to Winter's main pool area. He saw three people trying to feed Winter. He knew that one was Hazel, the other was probably Jordan, but he didn't know who the other person was. Sawyer could see he was obviously a boy, and he was next to Hazel smiling, and laughing. He had to get a closer look. \"Hey,\" Sawyer said as he walked closer. Susie tagged along behind him. \"Hi Sawyer,\" Jordan greeted. She pointed to the boy that was standing next to Hazel. \"This is my brother Jack,\" she said. Sawyer looked at Jack. He saw how they could be related. \"Hi Sawyer,\" Jack said to him. \"Hazel has mentioned you.\" \"You did?\" Sawyer said smiling at Hazel. She nodded with a smile. For some reason, that made him feel better. \"I've heard about those baby dolphins,\" Jordan said, her face looking sad. \"I'm so sorry they died.\" \"Yeah…\" Hazel said, her head was looking down into the water. \"She's trying to forget about that,\" Sawyer said to Jordan sincerely. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" Sawyer nodded, letting her know that it was okay. He then moved closer to where Hazel was kneeling down, feeding Winter. \"Hey can I talk to you?\" he asked her. She stood up and faced him. \"Sure,\" she said. Sawyer looked at Jordan, Susie and Jack, then pulled Hazel away to a more private place. Hazel was confused, but she just went along with it. \"So what do you want to tell me that's so private?\" Hazel joked. Sawyer eyed her, and she stopped laughing. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"It's fine,\" Sawyer said. \"You can tell me, I'm listening.\" \"Um, yesterday when you… um.\" \"Yeah?\" Hazel said. Sawyer shook his head. \"Never mind,\" he said. Hazel frowned. Why does he have to be shy? \"Can you come over at my house for dinner?\" he asked her. Maybe he would get the courage to tell her later. \"Of course,\" Hazel said. \"Great. Come at 6:30, I think my mom is making meatloaf. It's the best!\" Sawyer beamed. Hazel smiled at him, and felt she really happy inside. Sawyer was the cutest. … Sawyer told his mom and that he had invited Hazel to come over for dinner, but when he was setting the table he noticed four plates instead of three. \"Mom, why are there four plates?\" he asked her, after putting the last fork on the table. Lorraine wiped her hands on a dish towel and answered her son. \"Ron's staying for dinner also,\" she said smiling. \"Oh,\" Sawyer said quietly. He shrugged it off, then went into the living room to wait for Hazel. He must have not slept good the last night, because he ended up falling asleep on the couch. Lorraine noticed Sawyer lying on the couch, and she went to wake him up. \"Sawyer,\" she yelled-whispered. \"Hazel's here.\" Lorraine shook him a bit. \"Huh?\" Sawyer opened his eyes, got up slowly and rubbed his face. \"What?\" he said. \"It's time for dinner,\" Lorraine told him. Sawyer's eyes widened and he sprang up from the couch. He had forgotten that Hazel was supposed to come over. Sawyer walked into the kitchen where Ron and Hazel were seated. \"Hello Sawyer,\" Ron said, slightly waving his hand. \"Your hair,\" Lorraine whispered to Sawyer as she came in with the meatloaf. Sawyer touched his hair then looked at himself in a spoon. He noticed that some strands were sticking up from the nap. Embarrassed, Sawyer brushed it down with his hands, causing Hazel to laugh a little. After the meal was finished and the desert was eaten, Ron offered to do the dishes. Lorraine said that they would both clean up, while Hazel and Sawyer could do what they wanted. \"Want to play this new video game I got?' Sawyer asked her. \"Yes. That sound great,\" Hazel said. Sawyer went to his room and brought out his game system to the living room. He hooked it up and popped in the game that was called Underwater adventures. He loved the game, but some of his \"friends\" at school made fun of him for playing it. No one ever liked the games he liked, so when he showed Hazel it and she said it looked cool, it made him happy. \"So what do you do in the game?\" Hazel asked him as he brought two controllers from his room. He began to hook them up while he explained the basic idea of Underwater Adventures. \"You can swim underwater with animals, go in a submarine, and even adopt one as your pet,\" Sawyer told her. He gave her a controller, and showed her what each button was for. They played for about ten minutes, when Sawyer paused the game. Hazel was confused and looked at him. Where they really playing for that long? She was just getting to love the game. \"Hazel I need to tell you something,\" Sawyer said. \"Yeah?\" Please just say it. \"Yesterday when Susie came into the crow's nest it seemed like you felt, sort of...\" \"Jealous? Left out?\" Hazel asked him. Sawyer nodded. \"Were you any of those?\" he asked her. Hazel shook her head and sort of laughed. \"Sawyer, don't worry about it. I was just still sad about the baby dolphins. It's okay,\" she said. Sawyer turned away, and sighed in relief. Then Hazel realised something. \"Sawyer, were you worrying about that? Is that why you seemed tense today?\" \"No...\" he lied. Hazel sat down her controller and she grabbed his arm carefully. \"Sawyer, don't worry about me, okay?\" Hazel looked at him seriously. \"Okay,\" he said grinning at her. They continued to play Underwater Adventures for the next hour, before Lorraine told them to get off. Hazel noticed that it was 8:00 o'clock and her dad wanted her to be home by 7:30. She said goodbye to Sawyer and his mom, and then left. Sawyer smiled as he watched her leave out the window.[Chapter 13] For CandyLover4180: They are still together. You just have to wait till more chapters come. And Susie is just friends with Sawyer. Guys can have more than one girl best friend. Anyways, thanks to whoever is reading this mess of a story. I appreciate the reviews! :) Sawyer stepped inside the house and peered inside the kitchen. He saw Ron and Lorraine talking at the table, and they didn't notice him come in. He sighed as he thought about how many times Ron has been at their house. Sawyer shook his head and went to his bedroom. He sat in his bed and pulled out his iphone so he could text H azel. Sawyer: Ron's back... yay (sarcastic) Hazel: Sawyer, come on. You need to just tell your mom that you don't like him. Sawyer: I can't. Hazel: Why? Do you even have a reason for disliking Ron? Sawyer: um... Hazel: Ha! That's a no. Sawyer: Whatever... Hold on I'm hungry. Hazel: k Sawyer put his phone on his side table and went to the kitchen to get a snack. He got into the living room, but stopped when heard his mom say something to Ron. He could hear that well so he got closer and made sure he wasn't seen. \"You know, I actually was looking at homes in Washington. They have some nice ones,\" he heard Lorraine say. \"How about ones near by?\" Ron said. Lorraine nodded, but Sawyer could not see. What?! Homes in Washington? What the heck are they talking about. \" Sawyer is that you?\" Lorraine said. Sawyer didn't know what to say, so he made a beeline for his room. Hazel had sent him a text wondering where he was. Sawyer: I gotta go, sorry. He was debating whether to tell Hazel what he overheard. Hazel: That's okay. I have stuff to do anyway. He decided not to. ... Later that day, Sawyer found Hazel sitting near the boat house, reading a book. He slowly walked up to her and put his arms around her neck from behind, in a hug. She got startled, but smiled when she looked up and saw Sawyer there. \"Hey Sawyer,\" she greeted. Sawyer walked around the chair and faced her. \"How would you like to go on a movie date with me? I think there's a new dolphin movie playing,\" Sawyer told her. \"Oh, I can't. I have this book report for my dad that I have to finish,\" Hazel said. \"That's okay,\" Sawyer said. He smiled at her then moved closer to kiss her cheek. \"I don't want to bother you so I'll leave.\" Hazel smiled at him. \"Thanks.\" Sawyer walked to the aquarium where he saw Jordan, her brother Jack and Susie. They were all volunteering that day, but Sawyer thought that they should have a break. He went over to them and waved. \"Hey guys, do any of you want to go see a movie?\" he asked them. \"I do,\" Susie said. \"I want to see that new dolphin movie!\" \"That sound fun, but me and Jack have to get home,\" Jordan told Sawyer. \"Okay, I guess me and Susie will just go,\" he said. ... After the movie, when Susie dad was driving them home, Sawyer wanted to tell Susie about what he had overheard. He kind of regretted not telling Hazel right away, so he had to get it out to someone. \"So you're moving?\" Susie asked him. \"No, I didn't say that,\" he said. \"I just heard my mom talking about homes in Washington or something.\" \"You probably just getting the wrong idea Sawyer,\" she said. \"Maybe, but she sounded serious.\" The car pulled up into Sawyer's driveway, and he opened the door. \"Bye, Sawyer. I hope things go right,\" Susie said to him before he left. Not my favorite chapter... So I know it's short, but I had to get this in there. It's an important part of the story. I've got this story figured out already, so if it is confusing, just wait. It will be good :)[Chapter 14] Hazel had been working on her book report for hours, that she decided she had to take a break. Even though she was home schooled, her dad had due dates; he was strict on when she had to turn things in. Hazel decided she would read more later, then maybe finish the book tomorrow. Her most favorite thing to do while she took a break from school work was playing with Winter. She would take toys to her, and sit and on the edge of the pool. Winter's favorite toy was the duck with the ring on it. She liked it because it always reminded her of Sawyer. Hazel enjoyed sitting alone while she waded her feet in he pool; though sometimes it would get lonely. She found that it was her only time to really think; she was always bouncing around doing things for the aquarium. \"Hey,\" she heard Susie say. Hazel was confused. She wasn't sure if she was talking to her or someone else. Hazel looked around the area, but know one was there. \"Hey,\" Susie repeated. This time actually getting Hazel's attention. Hazel got up and stood in front of Susie. She wanted to ask why she was talking to her, but she didn't want to be rude. But then Susie smiled at her and something didn't seem right to her. \"Okay what is your problem?\" Hazel asked her, getting angry. \"What?\" Susie said innocently. \"Well, I mean you were mean to me before, and now you're suddenly nice to me?\" Susie had a confused look on her face, but Hazel could tell she was faking. Hazel stood, waiting for her to talk. She needed what was going on. Hazel stared intensely at Susie, until she broke. \"Fine you want to know why?\" Susie said, getting aggresive. \"Yes.\" \"My dad found out about what I did. He told me I have to be nice to you,\" she said. \"Or maybe you don't want Sawyer to find out your being mean to me?\" Hazel said. She felt really good saying that. \"Are you serious? You think I would do that?\" Susie said. \"Yes I do,\" Hazel said. \"Now that I have everything clear, you can leave. Sawyer's not here.\" Susie had no words to say next, so she just did what Hazel said. ... Sawyer was in his bedroom playing video games when he realised he was home alone. His mother had told him earlier that she was going to the store and he got distracted. He paused his video game and went to the kitchen to find something to eat. Sawyer was a growing teenager and was often hungry. As he passed by the counter near the fridge, he noticed a bunch of scattered papers. He remembered that the past couple of days, his mom was working on something. Sawyer looked closer at the papers. He had a chance to see what his mom was up to without her knowing. Sawyer was expecting it to be boring bills, or work related stuff. But when he saw one paper in particular, it shocked him. It had information about selling a house. Their house. The one Sawyer was standing in, about to get a snack from the fridge. Suddenly Sawyer had lost his appetite. He couldn't believe what he had just seen. Sorry for the delay. Was on vacation. Back at it soon. peace :)[Chapter 15] Sawyer didn't know what to do or how to feel. He just stood there in the kitchen, trying to take it all in. The stuff he had over heard Ron and his mom talking about were true. They were moving to Washington, where that dumb old Ron lived. Sawyer stood there for another minute, until he heard a car pull in the drive way. He panicked and ran to his room. If his mom hadn't told him about the move yet, she obviously didn't want to him to know. He tried to make it look like he head been in his room the whole time. But what he didn't realize was that he had forgotten to put the papers back where they were. Lorraine walked into the house with groceries in her arms. She called out for Sawyer to help her, but he purposely ignored her. Lorraine shrugged and walked to the kitchen with her arms full. She sat the bags on the table and the counter. As she was pulling things out of the bags, she noticed her papers were messier than before. She looked around and saw the \"moving papers\" on top of all of them. Oh no. Did he find out? She thought. After all the food and groceries were put away, Lorraine went to Sawyer's room to see what he was doing. She knocked on his door quietly just in case he was sleeping. \"Come in,\" Sawyer said. He was still playing video games. \"What have you been doing while I was gone?\" she asked him. \"I've been playing video games and stuff,\" he told her. It was true, but he just didn't say everything. \"Okay that's fine,\" Lorraine said, smiling at her son. She walked out of the room, thinking maybe he didn't see the paper. She assumed he would of mentioned something maybe he actually was happy about it. Sawyer watched his mom leave, and made sure his door was fully closed. He grabbed his cell phone from his side table and quickly scrolled through his contacts. He had to call someone to talk about the move, but for some reason Hazel didn't come across his mind. He dialed Susie's number and waited for her to pick up. \"Hi Sawyer,\" Susie said on the other end. \"Hey,\" he said. \"Why did you call? You don't sound okay.\" \"I'm not.\" \"What is it?\" \"I'm officially moving to Washington,\" Sawyer told her. \"Oh wow,\" she said, surprised. They almost didn't say anything for a couple seconds. \"Are you mad? You know, about moving?\" Susie asked him. \"Yeah. I haven't told my mom yet though.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"She hasn't actually told me that were moving. I just found out for myself.\" \"Oh so your mom doesn't know?\" Susie asked. \"Yeah.\" \"When do you leave?\" \"I'm not sure, but soon I think.\" \"Oh well, I'm going to miss you. And I'm sure Winter will too,\" Susie said, sounding sad. Sawyer's eyes widened when she said \"Winter.\" He had totally forget about her. Sawyer didn't want to leave the dolphin as much as he didn't want to leave Hazel. \"Susie thanks for listening, but I have to go,\" Sawyer said. He suddenly had strange feeling in him. \"Okay, bye. Call me when you officially know when your leaving,\" Susie said. \"Okay bye.\" Sawyer ended the call and sat his phone back down on his side table. He lay back on his bed and sighed. This whole moving situation was overwhelming for him. He was so confused and he didn't know what to do about it.[Chapter 16] Hazel woke up to the sound of blaring music outside of the boat house. She rubbed her eyes and walked to where the sound was coming from. She found Sawyer standing on the dock with his ipod and a Bluetooth speaker near by. Playing loudly was Hazel's favorite song. Forgetting that she was in her pajamas of sweats and a hoodie, Hazel stepped outside. She blinked a couple of times, making sure she wasn't dreaming. \"Sawyer what are you doing?\" she asked. Although it was 7:00 am, she couldn't help but smile at him. He began dancing around, and motioned Hazel to come over. \"Come on dance with me,\" Sawyer told her. He grabbed her arm and pulled her to the center of the dock. Hazel wasn't sure what was going on, but she went along with it. They danced along to the song making up their own moves. When the song ended, Hazel let go of his hand. \"Sawyer your great and all, but did you really have to wake me up this early on a Saturday?\" she said. \"What's going on?\" \"What do you mean?\" Sawyer asked. Hazel shook her head. \"Never mind,\" she said. Sawyer suddenly felt guilty that he wasn't telling Hazel about the move right away. He knew she would be very upset about it. They had been friends for a while, and now just became more. Hazel would him so much. And just after he came back from a three month trip, Hazel couldn't even stand that. Sawyer couldn't bare to tell her right then and there though. That's why he played her favorite song. He had planned a bunch of things for them to do that day. Sawyer wanted to do as many as things as he could with Hazel before he moved. He had no choice. \"Where are we going?\" Hazel asked, as Sawyer pulled her arm. They reached the beach and Hazel saw a blanket with food laying on the sand. She moved closer to get a better look. Sawyer stayed back and smiled. \"What's this?\" she asked him. Sawyer stepped closer. \"It's a picnic,\" he said, like it should be obvious. \"At 7:00 Am?\" she raised an eyebrow. \"It's breakfast,\" Sawyer explained. \"Bacon, eggs, pancakes…\" He walked over to the blanket and sat down, criss crossed. He looked up at Hazel, waiting for her to join him. \"I cooked all of this at 6:00 am,\" he told her, after she settled down onto the blanket. \"Really?\" she asked surprised. \"Just wanted to do something cool. I thought a breakfast picnic would be different,\" he said with a grin. She smiled too. Sawyer smiled again and gave a plate to Hazel. They ate up the food until the sun rose to it's fullest. Hazel checked the time on her phone and realized they better get going. Her dad had some new duties for them to do at the aquarium and he said to start 8:30. Hazel helped Sawyer clean up, and then they left to start their work. … Later that day at the aquarium, Sawyer made sure that Hazel was busy so he could talk to her dad. He waited until it was a good time and when he saw him in his office, he went inside. At first Dr. Clay didn't see him come in; he look up and Sawyer was standing in front of his desk. \"Hello Sawyer. What do you need?\" Clay asked the boy. \"Well um, I need to talk to about something,\" he said. Clay nodded his head and motioned for Sawyer to sit in the chair that was in front of the desk. \"What did you want to tell me?\" Clay asked him. \"I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity you have given me at the aquarium for the past years,\" Sawyer told him. \"You're welcome.\" Clay nodded. He was confused on why Sawyer had said that. \"And thank you for your daughter Hazel, she is amazing.\" Now Clay was even more confused. \"Where are you trying to get at?\" he asked Sawyer. Now Sawyer knew that there was no point on wasting time. He just had to be upfront and tell Clay what was going on. \"Well you see Dr. Clay,\" Sawyer began, \"I mean Clay.\" \"Yes?\" \"I'm moving to Washington,\" he finally said. \"State?\" Clay said in surprise. Sawyer nodded. \"Yeah, we're leaving soon I think.\" \"I don't mean to ask this, but why?\" Clay asked. \"My mom met this guys and his family lives there.\" \"Oh,\" Clay said to himself, but loud enough for Sawyer to hear. \"Yeah well that's what I had to say,\" Sawyer got up and started walking towards the door of the office. \"Were going to miss having you around here.\" Clay said to him. Sawyer turned around and gave him a small smile that was filled with both sadness and happiness. \"Thanks,\" Sawyer said before leaving the room. He had felt sad emotions about the move before but for some reason the talk with Hazel's father made him even more upset. He wanted to tell his mother so bad that she was being selfish and that she wasn't even considering how he felt abut it, but he just didn't know how to bring it up. After all, she didn't even tell him about it to his face yet. … Sawyer walked into the house, opening the door slowly. He went to his bedroom hoping not to run into his mom, but then she appeared out of nowhere. \"Sawyer I need to tell you something,\" Lorraine said. \"Actually mom, so do I.\" Sawyer stepped closer to his mom. \" I know we're moving,\" he told her. \"How did you find out?\" she asked, \"I saw the papers on the table,\" he told her. Lorraine scratched her head. \"Oh. Well I guess now that you know there's nothing else to say.\" \"Yeah there is mom!\" Sawyer's voice got louder, and his mom looked confused. \"Why didn't you tell me we were moving?\" \"I don't-\" Sawyer cut her off. \"Because you don't even care how I feel. You just want to move because of stupid Ron!\" Sawyer yelled. \"That's not all. Sawyer, there's this great job-\" Lorraine tried to explain. Sawyer narrowed his eyes, and glared at his mom. Then he stepped back and shook his head. He went into his room and slammed the door. Lorraine stood there in shock, not knowing what else to do. A/N: Thanks to those who read this I'm trying hard to finish it even though I'm not that into this story anymore... I still appreciate reviews by the way! :)[Chapter 17] Sawyer didn't speak to his mom the next morning. He grabbed something quick for breakfast, then he went straight to the aquarium on his bike. Inside, there was someone sitting next to Clay that he did not expect to see at Clear Water. Sawyer moved slowly and peered around a wall to take a look. He saw Clay shaking hands with Ron. They both smiled and Dr. Clay got up. Sawyer turned to walk away without Ron noticing, but he saw him. \"Oh hey Sawyer,\" Ron said. Sawyer nodded with a fake smile and slowly walked past, hoping he wouldn't say anything else.\"What are you up to?\" Ron asked him. Sawyer stopped, and turned around to face Ron. \"I'm about to feed Winter,\" he told him. Ron looked around then back at Sawyer. \"You know, you remind me of someone,\" he said to him. \"Who?\" Sawyer asked. It's not like he wanted to talk to Ron, he was just being polite by listening to him. \"My son. He loved animals just like you,\" Ron said. \"Where's your son?\" Saywer aked. Ron's face fell, and his head went down. Sawyer had a feeling he shouldn't of asked him that. \"He died kid. Drowned three years ago,\" Ron explained. Sawyer could tell it was hard or him to say. \"I'm sorry,\" Sawyer said to him. \"Yeah me too,\" Ron said. \"Why?\" \"I know you don't like me. I just barged in on your mom and you don't like that,\" Ron told him with a stern look in his eyes thgen suddenly got up and left. Sawyer stood there feeling confused and a little guilty. He had been so hard on Ron, and all he wanted was somebody like his son in his life again. Sawyer sighed and then went to go feed Winter. Feeding her helped him forget about everything that was going on. He sat on the edge of the pool, dangling his feet into the cold water. It used to tingle his toes when he first touched the water, but after a few times, he quickly got used to it. \"Hey!\" Sawyer heard hazel say from behind him. Sawyer turned his body and looked up at her. She grinned and sat next to him, putting her feet in the water too. She was silent for a few minutes, admiring the way Sawyer fed Winter little pieces of fish. \"You know, it's amazing,\" Hazel started, saying her train of thought out loud. \"What?\" Sawyer turned to look at her. \"It's amazing how much Winter smiled when you're round her,\" Hazel told him. \"You can tell?\" Sawyer said. \"Mm hm,\" she nodded. \"Her eyes go wide and she makes those tweedy bird noises. Remember those?\" Sawyer smiled. \"Yeah I do.\" He looked back at Winter, who was swimming around in the pool. He then remembered that he would never get to see her again. He would never get to feed her or swim with her. Sawyer then realized it wasn't fair not to tell hazel. He was going to have to do it sooner or later. \"Um, Hazel I gotta tell you something,\" Sawyer said. \"Yes?\" \"I um-\" \"Sawyer Hazel,\" a voice called, cutting him off. Sawyer sighed and looked to see who was walking there way. \"Hey guys come check this out,\" Phoebe said, pointing behind her. Hazel looked at Sawyer, then they both got up to their feet. They followed Phoebe, where she led them to one of the smaller pools outside. \"Check it out,\" Phoebe pointed at the pool. Sawyer and Hazel peered over the edge and looked into it. A baby dolphin was frolicking in the water, making cute noises. Hazel grinned widely. She looked and Sawyer to catch his reaction. \"We rescued him from the beach. He was caught in a plastic net,\" Phoebe explained to Hazel and Sawyer. \"Wow he's beautiful,\" Hazel beamed. \"You want to name him?\" Phoebe asked her since she was the one who named Hope. Hazel looked at Sawyer who was silently admiring the dolphin. \"How about Sawyer names it this time?\" she said. Sawyer looked at her in surprise. \"Me?\" he said. Hazel nodded and Sawyer scratched the back of his neck while Phoebe and Hazel looked at him, anticipating for him to answer. \"Uh, well...how about John?\" Sawyer suggested off the top of his head. \"I don't know..\" Hazel said. \"Yeah, I'm not really good at this,\" Sawyer told them. Phoebe and Hazel giggled. \"It's okay Sawyer,\" Phoebe said. \"Yeah we can think of a name later,\" Hazel said. ...[Chapter 18] When Sawyer woke up from a restless night of sleep, he heard his mom cooking breakfast in the kitchen. He got out of bed and walked down the hall, peering over the wall to see Lorraine. He had been afraid to confront her about the move, but Sawyer decided now was the perfect time as ever. Hearing her son, Lorraine told him to come sit down at the table. Sawyer slowly walked over, pulling out a chair and plopping down. Lorraine brought a plate of eggs, bacon, hash browns, and sausages to the table. \"Uh mom,\" Sawyer said, dishing up the food onto his plate. Lorraine looked at her son. \"Yes honey?\" Sawyer looked down at his food, before looking back at his mom. \"Could we talk about the move?\" he asked. Lorraine sat down in front of him. \"Sawyer we already discussed this,\" she told him. \"I know, but I'm ready to listen this time,\" he said. Lorraine smiled. For next few minutes, she explained to Sawyer how much she had gotten to know Ron, and where he lived. She talked about his family, and the job opportunity in Washington that would get them a nicer house and a new car. Sawyer was beginning to understand why moving to Washington meant so much to his mom. It was time he stopped thinking about himself. \"Mom?\" \"Yes?\" \"I don't know how to tell Hazel that we're moving,\" he said, looking down at the ground. \"You mean you haven't mentioned it to her yet?\" Lorraine's eyes widened. She knew Sawyer talked to Hazel all the time. She assumed he would have told her already. Sawyer looked up. \"Every time I get the chance, I get scared. I'm afraid she'll be mad at me,\" he confessed. \"Honey, I'm sure she will understand,\" Lorraine assured him. Sawyer sighed and nodded, but he still wasn't so sure how he was going to tell Hazel. ... That afternoon, Sawyer came to the aquarium for his \"shift.\" He worked around for an hour doing random jobs, before sitting at the edge of Winter's pool, watching her swim gracefully. He thought about his problems, and how he wished his life was as easy as a dolphin. Just swimming around and eating fish all day, while kids and parents came in to see you. Now that was the life. But Sawyer was not even close to a dolphin. He was a human being with feelings, that can hurt other humans feelings. That's what Sawyer didn't like about being human. If you say, or do the wrong thing, somebody could get mad. Sawyer stared into the pool, continuing to watch Winter, already missing her even though he hadn't moved yet. He heard footsteps and voices from behind, but he paid no attention to them. \"What's with Sawyer?\" Hazel said, mostly to herself. But since Susie was around, she talked aloud. Susie heard her loud and clear, and grinned. \"I know what's up,\" she said, confident and proud. Susie stepped closer to Hazel. \"What?\" Hazel asked, not believing for a second that Susie knew why Sawyer looked down. \"He's moving to Washington, and couldn't tell you,\" she told her. Hazel had no words to say, and she felt so confused. She gave Susie a stare, before brushing past her and running towards Sawyer. \"Sawyer!\" Hazel yelled, startling him and making him nearly fall into the pool. He turned to look up at Hazel, who did not have a pleasant look on her face. \"When were you going to tell me you were moving? To Washington?!\" she shouted. Sawyer was speechless and startled by her tone of voice. \"Um, how did you know I was moving?\" he asked, innocently. Hazel looked back at Susie, who had a confident smirk as she crossed her arms and watched. \"Susie told me,\" Hazel said, turning back to look at Sawyer. \"Because apparently, she's the only person you could tell.\" \"That's not true,\" Sawyer said, standing up and facing Hazel. \"I told your dad too.\" \"So you could tell my dad, and not me?\" she said, with even more rage. \"I knew you'd be mad!\" Sawyer said, his voice rising too. \"I'm not mad!\" Hazel said. \"Well you sure sound like it,\" Sawyer said. Hazel took a deep breath, and rubbed her forehead. She took a second to calm herself. \"Sawyer, I'm not mad that you're moving, okay?\" she said. \"It's just lately, you've just been different.\" \"How?\" he wondered. He didn't notice a change in himself. \"Ever since we became a couple, you've been having a hard time talking to me, and telling me what's going on.\" \"I'm very capable of explaining my feelings,\" Sawyer said, defending himself. \"Yeah, to Susie, who seems to be much more a friend to you than me,\" Hazel said. \"But you and I are boyfriend and girlfriend, remember?\" Sawyer reminded. \"I don't know Sawyer,\" Hazel said, rubbing her head again. \"Don't know what?\" Sawyer said, feeling hurt, confused and angry. Hazel sighed and began to walk away. \"I have to go,\" she said. Sawyer stood there in disbelief. He had no idea what had just happened. Was Hazel mad at him or not? He couldn't tell. Sawyer eyed Susie, who was across him, confused why she would do that to him. He then turned around, and left. He started walking fast, avoiding any contact with anyone, especially Hazel. When he passed by Dr. Clay's office, Clay came out and stopped him. \"Sawyer, would you come in here for a sec,\" Clay told him through the doorway. Sawyer turned around to see him. Did he know about the fight he had with Hazel? \"Um, okay,\" Sawyer said, hesitantly walking into the office. Clay was behind his desk, holding piece of paper. He didn't look mad, which made Sawyer sigh in relief. \"What did you want?\" he asked Clay, slowing sitting on a chair that was in front of the desk. Clay then sat down too. \"I know you volunteer here at the aquarium, and you don't like to call it work,\" Clay said, putting the piece of paper on the desk, and in front of Sawyer. \"But here's a check for all that you do for the animals.\" Sawyer's eyes widened at the big number written on the check. \"But it's one thousand dollars,\" Sawyer said, grabbing the check to take a closer look. Clay nodded, smiling. Sawyer looked up to thank him. \"Thank you, but I don't need this,\" he said, putting the check back onto the table. Clay grinned, and pushed it towards Sawyer again. \"You deserve this Sawyer. Take it with you to Washington, and buy whatever you like,\" Clay said. Sawyer took the check, and held onto it. \"Okay,\" he said. \"Thanks again.\" He smiled, but he was trying is best not to cry in front of Dr. Clay. Sawyer got up, and headed to the door. When he turned around for one last look, Clay was still smiling. Sawyer gave him a nod, to thank him once more for the money, then left. As Sawyer rode home on his bike, the check was carefully folded onto the pocket of his shorts. He still couldn't believe that Clay had given him so much money. He didn't want anything in return for volunteering at the aquarium. He loved doing it, and he loved the animals; it wasn't work for him. Sawyer tried to think of things he could buy with one thousand dollars, but nothing that interested him came to mind. He thought about buying something for his mom, but every time he had bought her something in the past, she wouldn't except it. She would probably tell him to go get something for himself. When Sawyer reached his home, he put his bike against the garage door, and went inside. He found tons of boxes scattered around the living room, filled with things from around the house. Sawyer saw his mom put things from his bedroom into a box that read: Sawyer's stuff. \"Mom!\" Sawyer said, rushing up to the box. \"Mom, I can pack my own things,\" he said. Lorraine smiled, holding some of Sawyer's clothes. \"Sorry, I wasn't sure if you wanted to or not,\" she said. Sawyer grinned, and took the box into his room to start packing. He began to place clothes and other belongings into the box, when he remembered that the check was still in his pocket, and he didn't want to crumple it up. He reached into the pocket, pulling the long rectangle piece of paper out. He stared at it for a moment, then finally figured out what he would do with the money. First he finished filling up the one box, then he told his mom that he had something that needed to be done. So Sawyer left the house, and rode back to the aquarium. He was exhausted, but he needed to do this. He went inside, hoping no one would come up to him. Then he found a place he knew Hazel and him only went up to: the crows nest. Sawyer climbed the ladder, and he took the check from his pocket, along with a pen, a blank piece of paper and a rock. He wrote on the paper: To Hazel, I know you're always trying to save up for something, so I will help you get started- Sawyer. He then placed the check that Dr. Clay had given him , on the floor of the crows nest, and put the note on top. He used the rock as a weight so the papers wouldn't fly away. He sighed, then stepped down from the nest, and headed back to his house to finish packing. Thanks for the reviews! You guys really motivate me to finish![Chapter 19] Sawyer woke up the next morning feeling refreshed. Although he had the fight with Hazel the day before, he was starting to forget about it. He didn't need Hazel. If she wanted to be mad at him she could. He was moving anyway. In fact, he actually felt really glad to be moving. \"Honey, are you all set?\" Lorraine called from the kitchen. Sawyer rubbed his eyes, and stepped out of bed. He stretched his arms out and yawned. He entered the kitchen and smiled at his mom. \"Yeah,\" he said, grinning. Lorraine studied her sons face as she stepped closer to him. She smiled too. \"Is that an actual smile I see?\" she teased. Sawyer laughed. \"Mom,\" he said, now looking serious. \"I just want you to know how glad I am that you found someone.\" \"Thank you Sawyer,\" Lorraine said. \"I know it'll take some time to get used to. I just want you to be happy. That's my number one priority.\" If that was her priority, then she wouldn't have stayed together with Ron in the first place. \"How are you and Hazel doing?\" she asked. Sawyer was afraid she would say that. How were they doing? He didn't know. For some reason, in this past year they weren't able to communicate like they had used to. \"We're okay,\" he lied. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah mom.\" ... The first thing Hazel thought of when she woke up that morning, was how angry she was at Sawyer. How he never even told her that he was moving, but he told Susie. For some reason, Sawyer thought Hazel would be mad at him. Why would she be mad at something he couldn't control? Something as lame as moving away. Was she sad that about it? Maybe at first. But because of their fight, she was glad to have a break from him. After Hazel said good morning to her dad, she grabbed a cup of coffee and took it up to the crows nest. As she climbed up, she noticed the check Sawyer had left for her. She picked it up and read the note. How stupid was he? She couldn't cash in the check if his name was on it. This made Hazel even more agitated, she crumpled the check and tossed it over the nest. She watched a seagull pick at it, then fly away. ... \"Sawyer,\" Lorraine called to her son who sat in the back seat of their van. She started to slow down when they passed by the aquarium. \"Do you want to say goodbye to Dr. Clay and Hazel?\" she asked. Sawyer thought about it for a moment. He pretty much said his goodbye to Clay already, and he did not want to run into Hazel after what had happened the day before. But he never got to say goodbye to Winter or the other dolphins. \"Okay,\" he agreed, but only to say bye to Winter. Lorraine parked the van so she could wait for Sawyer. When he got out, he looked around for anyone. The coast was clear. No Hazel in sight. He quickly rushed to the front doors, and peered in side. Hazel wasn't seen there either. Good. \"Hey Winter,\" Sawyer whispered as he got closer to her pool. He sat down. \"I know this is hard for you, but I have to leave now.\" Sawyer sniffed and Winter made her tweedy bird noises at him. He smiled. \"Don't worry, I won't forget you Winter. Will you remember me?\" She continued to make noise. \"That's good to hear,\" he said. Sawyer sighed. \"Hazel will take good care of you.\" Hazel was watching him from afar, then she started to cry. All things aside, she really was going to miss him. But she couldn't go up it him. Should she go up to him? \"Um,\" Hazel said, as she hesitantly stepped forward. Sawyer turned around, and she instantly regretted her decision. She averted her eyes and walked passed him quickly. She grabbed a bucket of fish. \"Come on Winter, time to eat,\" she said, ignoring Sawyer completely. He glared at her when she walked in front of him to feed Winter. Sawyer stood up, standing behind Hazel. He was so tempted to push her over, but he knew that would be too far. He decided to just leave the place. His mom was waiting for him anyway. Goodbye... he thought.[Chapter 20] The road trip to Washington took days, and Sawyer was so exhausted when they finally arrived at Ron's house. Until they got settled and found a house for themselves, Sawyer and Lorraine would be staying at his. He didn't like the idea at first. It seemed weird to be living at someone else's house as a guest. He couldn't watch TV whenever he wanted or grab food from the fridge. But Ron said he would make Sawyer feel like he was at home. In fact, Ron had bought him a brand new PlayStation just for him to use. That was something Sawyer was excited about, since he only had ever used an Xbox. Ron had even bought him a collection games. \"You can play it in your room whenever you want,\" Ron told him. \"Thank you sir,\" Saywer said. He started to walk into his room. \"Sawyer, you don't need to call me sir,\" Ron said. Saywer turned around. \"Okay,\" he said awkwardly. Sawyer rushed to his room so fast, so he could avoid any further conversations Ron. He had to admit, he was starting to warm up to the guy. But still, talking to him would take some time. As Sawyer started to unpack his boxes, he unloaded his laptop and charger. He then he decided to video chat Hazel to let her know he arrived safely in Washington, even after the fight. \"Hi Hazel,\" Sawyer said to the webcam. He was surprised she answered. Maybe she wanted to apologize. \"Sawyer, I only answered because I needed to say some things,\" Hazel said. \"Okay, great. I have somethings to say too. I know we-\" \"Listen Sawyer,\" she cut him off. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Me too.\" He smiled. \"No, I'm sorry that we even became boyfriend and girlfriend.\" \"What?\" Sawyer was in disbelief. \"Becoming more than friends was the worst thing for us,\" Hazel explained. \"How? I thought you liked me?\" \"I did like you... I mean...\" Hazel turned to the side to wipe her eye, trying to hide her tears from Sawyer. \"What do you mean?\" Sawyer said. \"You are a wonderful person Sawyer, but you deserve someone better than me.\" \"Better than you? You are the best for me. There is no else like you Hazel,\" Sawyer pleaded. There was a brief moment of silence, but it wasn't awkward. \"I gotta go Sawyer,\" Hazel said. But he wasn't finished talking to her. \"Okay?\" He didn't know what to say. \"Bye.\" Hazel shut her laptop abruptly. ... After Hazel hung up on Sawyer, she started to cry. She sat in the crows nest sobbing until her eyes hurt. As she wiped her eyes, she heard Susie coming. Hazel didn't even care about what Susie was doing, she was too sad. \"Hazel are you crying?\" Susie asked. She climbed up to the crows nest. \"What's wrong?\" she asked Hazel, totally forgetting that they were enemies. \"Saywer and I are over. I don't think we'll even be friends again,\" Hazel choked. Susie didn't know what to do so she just hugged her. Hazel hugged back, not caring that Susie and her weren't on the best terms. She just needed someone to comfort her. ... Thanks to those who still read this mess of a story! I appreciate the reviews! Don't worry, I will finish this story someday![Chapter 21] It was a beautiful sunny day, and usually when the suns out, Sawyer would be outside because he enjoyed the fresh air. But that day was different. After his conversation with Hazel, he felt dead. He lay in his bed, motionless since he woke up at 8 AM. His mom had't even checked up on him, since he didn't come to breakfast. She was probably spending time with Ron. At least she still had someone. Sawyer didn't even have a friend anymore. Well, he did have Susie but they were miles apart. What good is a friend who is far away? You can't hangout with them. You can't talk to them in person. You can't touch them. And by touch them, Sawyer meant hold their hand, or hug them. Wait? Who holds hands with a friend. Sawyer had been thinking about Hazel. That's who wanted to hold hands with and hug. Sawyer sat up on turned around to aggressively punch his pillow. He pulled his arm back and put his hand into a fist and whacked his pillow many times in row. With each punch, he screamed in frustration and anger. He stopped when he heard feet shuffling near his bedroom. Ron poked through the door. \"I heard screaming, is everything alright?\" he asked. \"GO AWAY!\" Saywer yelled, throwing his pillow across the room at Ron. He didn't mean to scream at him, he was just so angry that anybody in his way would set him off. Ron left awkwardly, then Lorraine came in. \"Sawyer, honey what's wrong?\" she asked, sitting on his bed. Sawyer lay on his side, his back facing towards her, crying. Lorraine, touched his head stroking his hair and comforting him. ... Hazel was actually glad Sawyer had moved to Washington. Now she could focus on school and working at the aquarium. She started to forget about him and them no longer being friends. Besides, he was miles away. Long distant relationships are hard. Even platonic ones. Hazel couldn't be bothered to call him everyday or video chat him to see how he was doing. She had her own things to worry about. She didn't need Sawyer to get in her way. She didn't want him to get in her way. Hazel had woke up bright and earlier to get a head start on her school work. Then she began to feed all the animals, starting with Winter. She took a bucket of fish and tossed some into the pool. Hazel sat at the edge of the pool, watching Winter. She noticed Winter wasn't scarfing down the fish like she had always done. She stayed off in the corner and stared at the fish floating at the top of the pool. \"I know you're sad that's Sawyer moved,\" Hazel said to Winter. \"But you'll be fine without him.\" Winter whistled, like she had answered Hazel. \"I mean, If I can survive with out him, so can you.\" Suddenly a memory flooded into Hazel's mind... It was August 3rd, Sawyer was thirteen years old and he was preparing for Hazel's surprise thirteenth birthday. He arranged with Dr. Clay to plan the greatest birthday ever for Hazel. Near the boat house, they had set up decorations and a giant Happy Birthday Hazel banner. Sawyer's most favorite thing was the water slide Clay had installed at the edge of the dock so they could slide into the water. Hazel had been off with Phoebe to buy supplies that they needed for the aquarium, having no idea a party was waiting for her. When they got back to the aquarium, Hazel noticed none of the volunteers and workers were out. \"Where is everyone?\" she asked Phoebe. Phoebe tried her best not to crack a smile. \"I don't,\" she shrugged. \"I'm going to put these supplied away, you go head to the boat house. I think you're father is there.\" \"Okay,\" Hazel agreed. She ran to the boat house, expecting her dad to have a list of chores for her to do, but she didn't see him anywhere. \"Dad?\" she called. Hazel looked around. She saw the water slide that was attached to the dock. \"When did that get there?\" \"Surprise!\" She heard a bunch of voices yell. Her dad, Sawyer, and the volunteers came pouring out of the boat house. Hazel's eyes widened and she couldn't stop smiling. \"When did you guys plan this?\" Hazel asked. Dr. Clay stepped towards his daughter. \"It was all Sawyer's idea,\" he pointed to him. Sawyer smiled at her as he held a giant cake with her name on it. It also had a frosted dolphin holding balloons on it's fin. \"You thought of this?\" Hazel said to Sawyer. He nodded. \"Thanks Sawyer. This the best thing ever. The water slide is so awesome.\" \"Wait!\" Sawyer sat the cake on a table. \"That's not the only thing.\" He ran into the boat house to get something. When he came out, he held a kitten in his hands. Hazel gasped. \"Oh my gosh, it's so adorable,\" she squealed. Sawyer handed her the kitten. \"Happy Birthday Hazel,\" he said. \"Hey, you two want to try out the water slide?\" Clay said. Hazel nodded. \"Here dad hold the kitten,\" she said. \"Race you!\" Sawyer yelled as he ran to the edge of the dock. \"Wait what about our clothes?\" Hazel asked. \"What clothes?\" Sawyer smiled, and pushed Hazel into the water, before jumping in himself... The memory came out of nowhere. Hazel shook her head, trying to get the memory out. She didn't need anymore of those coming into her brain. After all she was trying to forget him. Right? ...[Chapter 22] \"So you and Sawyer aren't talking?\" Susie said to Hazel at the aquarium. Hazel nodded. \"It would be too difficult to keep a long distanced friendship anyway,\" she said, wading her feet in Winter's pool. Susie walked over to Hazel and sat next to her. \"Can I tell you something?\" she said to Hazel. \"Yeah.\" \"I really liked Sawyer. A lot,\" Susie began. \"I kind of figured that,\" Hazel said. \"No but wait. I saw the way he looked at you, and new I had to let it go,\" Susie explained. \"Thanks, I guess,\" Hazel said. Susie hung her head down. \"I've been a total jerk,\" Susie said. Hazel wasn't expecting that to come out of her mouth. Suddenly she felt really sad for her. Lately they actually have been getting along and to hear her say that she's been mean to Hazel made her forgive her. \"It's okay Susie,\" Hazel apologized. Susie looked at Hazel, surprised that she actual forgave her. \"Are you sure? I was terrible to you. I pushed you into the pool and almost gave you a concussion.\" \"Listen, Susie, I've tried to forget about that, Okay?\" \"Okay. I truly am sorry,\" Susie apologized again. \"I just wanted you to know that I want you to have Sawyer.\" \"That's great, but I don't think I want to hear that name ever again,\" Hazel said. ... Sawyer was in his bedroom playing video games when he got called by Lorraine from Ron's living room. He shrugged and paused his game then went to the living room to see his mom and Ron sitting close on the couch. They looked at Sawyer when he came in and then looked at each other. \"What?\" Sawyer said flatly. \"Sawyer, come here.\" Lorraine motioned him to come closer. He did, but very slowly. Then Ron spoke. \"Sawyer, I asked your mother to marry me,\" he said. That was the last thing Sawyer expected him to say. \"We want to know what you think,' Lorraine said. Sawyer stood their in disbelief. First Hazel told him she didn't want to be friends anymore, and now Ron proposed to his mom. \"Um, I think it's great,\" he lied, before dashing into him room. He slammed the door so loud that a vase in the living room crashed to the ground. Sawyer screamed and started to punch his bed. He was interrupted by his cellphone ringing. \"Hello?\" he answered. \"Hi Sawyer, this is Susie.\" \"Oh hi Susie,\" Sawyer said, trying to sound calm and like he was not just screaming and yelling. \"I just wanted to let you know that I apologized to Hazel about me being such a jerk to her,\" Susie said. \"Thanks for doing that Susie.\" \"You're welcome, Sawyer. I'm sorry I was mean to your girlfriend.\" \"That's okay Susie. Hey by the way, did Hazel mention me to you?\" he asked hopefully. \"As a matter of fact yes,\" Susie said. \"What did she say?\" Sawyer asked. \"Sorry Sawyer, but she said she never wants to hear your name ever again,\" Susie told him. Sawyer dropped his phone to the ground without hanging up and saying goodbye to Susie. Everything just got worse for him. He felt like jumping off a cliff and never coming back up from the water. Sawyer ran out of the house and climbed up to the top Ron's roof. He stood with his arms up and yelled as loud as he could, his throat hurt. He jumped up in the air, but then slipped and started to fall backwards. He tumbled down the roof and landed on the ground with a thud. Everything turned black, and his problems were forgotten. ...[Chapter 23] Life at the aquarium was quiet that evening. All the volunteers had gone home and the animals were unusually quiet. After the volunteers go home, it was up to Hazel and Clay to finish up the day. Clay got a call from Lorraine explaining that Sawyer had hurt his head and he was at the hospital. Clay immediately went to find Hazel. \"You wanna go now? I'll buy you a ticket to Washington,\" Clay said to Hazel. \"What are you talking about?\" she asked. \"You mean you didn't hear?\" \"What?\" \"Sawyer's in the hospital. He fell off a roof,\" he told her. Hazel looked at her dad with her mouth hung wide open. She had no words to say and she couldn't process the news. \"Are you serious dad?! Let's go now!\" Hazel raised her voice and flung her arms around in the air. Hazel and her dad got into his car and rushed to the airport to buy last minute tickets to Washington. Hazel had even offered to buy hers with her own money she had saved up in her bank account. She didn't even know why she would spend so much on someone she was no longer speaking to. But when she heard that Sawyer was in the hospital, she had to go see him. Clay and Hazel flew to Washington from Florida, and Lorraine picked up them at the airport. They drove in the car to the hospital where Sawyer was. \"He was unconscious at first,\" Lorraine explained from behind the wheel. Hazel bit her lip hard. \"But he's awake now.\" Hazel sighed in relief. \"What exactly happened?\" she asked. Lorraine shook her head. \"We don't know. I just found him outside lying on the ground.\" Man I hope he's okay Hazel thought as they drove to the hospital. At the hospital, Hazel and Clay were allowed to see Sawyer by the doctors permission. They had their moment with Sawyer, but Clay knew he had to leave them alone. \"Hey,\" Hazel said standing next to his bed. Sawyer had his head bandaged with dried blood seeping through. His arm had an IV stuck into it and they were bruised. He managed to say, \"Hazel, I'm glad your here. And I'm pretty surprised that you even came,\" he said. \"I know, I am too,\" she said. Hazel sat down on the bed, facing him. She grabbed one of his bruised hands and held it. It felt warm and soft even when bruised and bloody. She saw Sawyer grin upon her holding his hand. That made her happy despite what they were going through. \"I lo-\" Sawyer spoke. \"What?\" \"Nothing.\" Sawyer shut his eyes, and continued to smile as Hazel still caressed his hand.[Chapter 24] Hazel stayed overnight in one of Ron's spare rooms while her dad booked a hotel. He figured she'd want to be as close to Sawyer as she could. Hazel woke up the next morning after visiting Sawyer in the hospital anxious for him to come home. She kept thinking about what he was about to say to her. \"I'm so glad he's coming home,\" Lorraine said to Hazel in the living room. The two sat on the couch enjoying the peaceful silence of the morning. \"Me too,\" she answered. Hazel sighed and looked out a nearby window. Lorraine studied her expression. \"Sawyer seems very special to you huh?\" Lorraine asked. \"I dunno. I want to believe so, but-\" \"But what?\" Hazel faced Sawyer's mom. She sought her for advice. \"I've known Sawyer since we were eleven, and I've always had a crush on him,\" Hazel explained. Lorraine nodded as she followed along. \"Everyday I would tell myself, 'I have to tell him I like him'. I never did until a couple months ago. All this time I thought he was the one for me, and now I'm not so sure.\" \"What makes you not so sure?\" Lorraine asked. \"I don't know. How do you know when you really love someone?\" Hazel wondered. Lorraine smiled. \"Well, when you love someone, no matter what you're doing with that person you enjoy doing it with them. Even something so simple and boring.\" Hazel thought about all the times she Sawyer had cleaned the pools for hours. It was such a dreadful tedious task, but she realized when doing it with Sawyer the job didn't seem terrible at all. \"And when you love someone you can't go a day without thinking of them.\" Hazel had thought of Sawyer every single day when he left for Washington. Even when they were not speaking. She remembered thinking of his smile and warm eyes. Hazel loved they way he looked at her. It made her feel special. \"You also care for them even if you're in an argument or are fighting.\" Hazel wanted to fly to Washington right away to see Sawyer, even though they just had that awful video chat conversation. Maybe she did love him? ... Later that day Sawyer was ready to come home from the hospital. Ron offered to pick him up. When he came home, he still had a bandage wrapped around his forehead, and he was in a wheel chair. Hazel saw him get wheeled into the living room and she smiled as she walked to him. Lorraine and Ron left the two teens to be alone. \"Sawyer are you feeling well?\" Hazel asked. She sat on the couch while his wheel chair parked in front of her. \"I feel way better than before,\" Sawyer said. Hazel nodded, then there was a long pause before they said anything. \"Sawyer, I've missed you a lot since you've moved,\" she confessed. \"I thought you hated me?\" he said. Hazel shook her head so fast. \"No, no. There is nothing that could make me hate you. Yeah, I could get really angry at you, but never would I hate you,\" Hazel said. \"Hate is too strong of a word.\" \"That's good to hear. This whole time I thought you hated me,\" Sawyer said. \"Oh, I'm sorry Sawyer.\" \"That's all right.\" Sawyer smiled, and he reached his hand over slowly to touch her knee. \"I was going to tell you that I love you at the hospital yesterday but I was too afraid.\" Hazel looked deeply in his eyes and touch his hand with hers. \"Do,\" he stuttered. \"Do you love me?\" Hazel took her hand away and leaned back. \"I don't,\" she admitted. \"I don't know if I'm in love or if I know what it is.\" Sawyer put his head down. \"Oh,\" he muttered. \"But.\" He perked up. \"I do know that you are very special to me Sawyer, and I never want us to be apart.\" \"I agree,\" he smiled, even though he hoped that she would say that she loved him too. Hazel smiled back and leaned off of the couch so that she was inches away from his face, she put her lips against his, kissing him for a good moment. Hazel then breathed in and pulled away, making Sawyer's smile so big. \"I thought you said you didn't know if you loved me?\" Sawyer teased. \"Yeah, but that doesn't mean I can't kiss you,\" she said. Sawyer laughed and without any thought, chose to kiss her himself. They didn't know what the future would hold for them, but they both knew they wanted to always be by each others side. Sawyer and Hazel lived in that moment and forgot about what had happened in the past. Now it was them against the world. Thank you so so so so much to those who have read this story till the end.

Thanks for reading. ~ LJ Chapter One In Which LaBoeuf Encounters a Difficult Girl \"She is fourteen, and there all alone,\" Mrs. Ross sighed, her presence a faint one in the room, consumed in mourning. Black bombazine enveloped her, rending her nigh on invisible, even in the bright light of an afternoon. \"She has been in contact with our lawyer already, Mr. Dagget informs me, and he fears she is determined to do something rash.\" I cleared my throat. \"Rash, Mrs. Ross? Pardon me, but she is only a little girl.\" I heard a snort by the door and turned, my hand on my still-holstered revolver, to see who it was. A negro with a clean-shaven face and lines that bespoke laughter leaned lightly against the frame of the door. \"That one? My apologies, Mizz Ross, Mister Ranger – I saw you flash that badge of yours when you got here – but Miss Mattie ain't been a little girl since she was in her cradle.\" He crossed his arms with all the casual comfortableness of a resident of the house. I concluded that he was a hired hand of long and good standing. \"She shooed me off, she did, Ranger. Sent me and the body of her father on the train and agreed to sleep in the undertaker's. Imagine that.\" Everything that I knew of propriety rebelled and stiffened to hear that. That a little girl would tell her elder, her guardian on an errand, to leave her behind? Absurd. Ridiculous. I dwelt on that aspect of young Mattie Ross's character as I road from Yell County, Arkansas to Fort Smith. After making inquiries, I discovered the young woman who was on the trail of Tom Cheney – the entire town had heard of her business – had spoken to Marshall Rooster Cogburn and was boarding at the only respectable house in the tiny town. Cogburn. A one-eyed drunkard who could barely sit upright on his horse. I had heard of him. Surely, once I had had the chance to speak with the girl, she would give me the information she had and I could pursue Chaney and bring him back to the Governor for prosecution. The reward would not hurt my feelings, either. Mrs. Floyd's Boarding House was a respectable establishment. I made it my business to charm her out of her only free room and asked after her youngest guest. \"Oh, she's out tending to her horse, I daresay.\" \"Thank you, ma'am. I will wait for her on your fine porch, if that would be all right.\" She pursed her lips but told me I was welcome to wait. I had thought to get a feel for the girl before we conversed. When I saw the young lady walking so uprightly down the center of Main Street, her hair in two rigid braids, steps sure and forthright, I knew this was my quarry. Mattie Ross. She saw me; I knew she did, for her dark eyes met mine without pause. Still, she did not speak to me, so I waited until later, figuring to catch her after her dinner. This did not happen. Instead, I caught her in bed. Assuring Mrs. Floyd that a young girl had nothing to fear from a Texas Ranger, I insinuated myself into the room Mattie Ross had been sharing. Same stick-straight braids, laying in order on either side of her face. Straight brows. Impertinent nose, and a quilt pulled up almost to her shoulders. She sniffled in her sleep and I felt my face relax into a smile as I settled more easily back into the rocking chair the room afforded. Some trick of the morning light hit her expression and her lips curved – perhaps at some happy dream. And I realized uncomfortably that when she smiled, she was rather pretty. Her mouth should smile, I decided, especially that upper lip... I could kiss that pair of lips and be blissfully content, my thoughts told me. My thoughts were ridiculous. Kiss Mattie Ross? She was fourteen years old! What she needed, I reminded myself, was a good spanking for sending her guardian away. Uncomfortable in my mind and body for a moment, I made to shift in the chair. The movement or the noise I made awoke the girl and her eyes blinked as she started awake. \"Who are you?\" \"William LaBoeuf, Texas Ranger,\" I told her as we got introductions out of the way. The girl had a tongue on her – a sharp one. Dared to tell me, her elder by fifteen years, that being kissed by me would be equally as unpleasant and unwelcome as the whipping I felt she would best benefit through receiving. She also refused my aid, clinging to her ideal of hiring a U.S. Marshal over a Texas Ranger. Well, she was a foolish girl, make no mistake, but I left her there in her bed, unmolested. I then went to track down Marshal Cogburn. Little did I realize at that time what an impact these two people would make on the life of a Texas Ranger.[Chapter 2] A/N: Just for legalities: This is a work of derivative fiction.

Apologies to anyone who was really quick and caught that! ~ LJ Chapter Two: In Which The Ranger and the Marshal Discuss the Girl He was drunk, as I had known he would be, and I decided I did not have to be nearly as polite with him as I did with young Miss Ross. \"Marshal! I hear tell you are going after my rightful quarry. I would like,\" I continued as he glared with a baleful eye, \"to propose a working arrangement with you.\" Rooster Cogburn puffed out his chest like any cock of the walk. \"Without the girl, I take it?\" \"Absolutely. She is a child and has no business encountering the likes of the man she calls Chaney.\" I rolled up on my toes as we stood at the bar of Sal's Saloon there in Fort Smith. Not a tawdry establishment, I was relieved to note. Stale smoke and whiskey were the predominant odors to hit my nose, but those smells were common enough in my travels. I twitched my lips and blew out a breath through my nostrils. Such foul smells tended to linger on my mustache, but I told myself to ignore it. \"When did you plan on leaving?\" He snorted and lifted his shot glass. \"Before she does, that is for certain. Little Sis has no business going to the Choctaw Nation.\" \"I agree. I will meet with you then, and we can cross the river together.\" I did not trust the man, though he was a U.S. Marshal. \"I am a fair shot,\" I added modestly, \"and have a good eye for tracking.\" Then, though it cost me in pride, I went on to say that I felt his greater years of experience would make us a good working partnership while we hunted our man. Cogburn threw back his shot. I could imagine the burn it made down his throat by the gleam in his eye. \"I have experience, young Ranger,\" he slurred at me, practically growling in his ire. \"And I know the Ned Pepper Gang.\" \"I know Chaney. We should work together. It is perhaps providential that young Mattie Ross has accidentally introduced us.\" \"Hm.\" He beckoned to the barkeep with a lazy curling of his fingers. \"Another shot for me and one for the Ranger, here.\" \"Marshal, I –\" \"I will not trust a man who will not drink with me.\" I shrugged my shoulders. \"Well, then. I will drink. And thank you, Marshal Cogburn.\" \"Hm.\" We did not look at one another as we drank the whiskey, but I knew that it was important anyway. He was right – men do work more easily together if they have shared a drink. I awoke before dawn, none the worse for wear after a little liquor and a lumpy mattress. Sleeping in a reputable boarding house was far superior to many places I have had to take my rest while on the trail of a villainous fellow and I was thankful to have had it. I did not have to drink from the ground, but instead was able to pour water into a glass like a civilized man before shaving and endeavoring to tame the hair that Miss Mattie Ross had so denigrated the day before. The girl had a negative opinion about everything. I made sure to look in on her before I left the boarding house. Cogburn did not wish to travel with her – something upon which he and I agreed wholeheartedly. I was not paid to mind children. Cogburn had been hired by her, but I had not. There she was, alone in her bed, looking as innocently determined in sleep as she did awake. Strange girl, she was. Direct. More as if she ran her father's farm than was his daughter. It was a thought I would return to later. Much later. That morning, my purpose was to leave town and reach the Territories with Cogburn before young Mattie Ross awakened. We met up, Cogburn and I, on the edge of town, near the last wall on the last building on the main street. He looked as if he had not slept all night – I did not choose to speculate upon what he might have been doing instead. \"You look as if you had passed a good night,\" he growled, shifting in his saddle so that his horse came around to stand restlessly next to mine. The sun was just rising above the horizon and our shadows were long. \"I hope you are ready to make good time.\" \"I am.\" With the lightest touch of my heels – I liked my spurs and wore them with pride, but I always took care to treat my mount well – I moved forward, my mind moving quickly over everything I knew about the man who had killed the father of Mattie Ross as well as the Governor. He was known to be ruthless in his dealings with men, but had also been known to have had a female in his hand and to have let her go without bringing her to harm in any way. Quick with a gun, he was not skilled with it, according to reports. \"Well,\" the U.S. Marshal said in his harrumphing manner, \"we probably should trot along a bit, LaBoeuf. I'd like to be in the Territories, over the River, before Little Sis shows up.\" \"Little Sis?\" There was a snuffled snort. \"She reminded me of my sister when she rolled my tobacco the other day.\" I rolled my eyes and brought my horse to a trot. Truly, we were loaded lightly, the Marshal and myself. I thought our time would be adequate, even knowing how persistent that stubborn girl could be. Without much conversation at all, Cogburn and I reached the river, where a ferryman looked relieved to have something to do. \"Jake!\" \"Marshal Cogburn! You headed out again, sir?\" \"I am, and so is this Texas Ranger with me,\" Cogburn informed the skinny fellow on the ground. He managed to make the title of Ranger a slur, but I let it pass for the moment – the sun was not getting any lower in the sky by any means. \"It is highly likely,\" Cogburn went on, \"that a girl will be following. She is a runaway from Yell County. I have not got time to escort her home, so when she appears –\" \"And she will,\" I interrupted, turning to scan the trail we had already ridden – \"Prevent her from crossing the River. Do not allow her to ride the ferry. Her mother is waiting at home and she is supposed to be returning there.\" \"Yes sir, Marshal Cogburn! You can count on me.\" \"Good.\" A coin flew through the air, the growing light of morning glinting off of its surface. \"You just get her back to the Sheriff's Office, Jake. I will have another for you if I find you have done so.\" Jake provided a reliable, quick transport across the River and had called his farewell when I had to look again to make sure he did not have a horse. For I heard one. He did not, but I had indeed heard a horse's hoofbeats. Loud and stubborn, too. Just like the girl on the horse. I will not repeat what the U.S. Marshal swore under his breath at the sight of the braids under the wide-brimmed hat, but I guarantee it would have earned him a reprimand from his employer.[Chapter 3] Chapter Three: In Which There is a Switch and a Gun and a Campfire \"Look, Jake is taking her away, just as I told him.\" Cogburn grunted with approval. I could hear Mattie Ross's protests – loud and firm they were over the soft sounds of the River – but was prepared to turn around and ride, fairly confident that Jake would be eager to earn another coin for taking the girl back into town. My confidence was misplaced. With courage I had not seen in a female before, Mattie Ross urged her mount into the water, compelling the horse to swim all the way to us. Within me rose conflicting feelings. Irritation that grew quickly into anger tightened my muscles. But at the same time, there was acknowledgment of her bravery and the realization that if she had been a boy, I would have been the first one there to help horse and rider get safely ashore. I could not move to help Miss Ross, however. I was offended at her refusal to obey her elders and – I did not then know what else it was that pestered my insides about the girl. Still I remained mostly taciturn while she argued with the U.S. Marshal. Until, that was, she pointed out to him his error in spelling. \"And 'futile,' Marshal Cogburn, 'pursuit would be futile?' It's not spelled \"f-u-d-e-l.\" And when she said that, something within myself just snapped. I felt compelled to teach this chit of a girl a lesson. A lesson in respecting her elders to put her in her place was long overdue. I was off of my mount and approached her soggy form and dripping horse with tension gripping me all over, as if it were an otherworldly hand. Still, I cannot quite remember what I said to Mattie Ross, so engulfed was I in what felt like a righteous wrath. Something about teaching her that lesson, I suppose. I had her off her horse and over my knee to spank that little girl on her backside. Due to the heavy fabric of her duster and the unmaidenly trousers she had chosen to wear (trousers that were far too large for her and part of what outraged me was that she was wearing a man's clothing – who would have given it to her? Why was she wearing it?) I do not think she felt a thing. Her cries were not filled with pain or shame at all; she sounded angry as a spitting cat. So I went for a switch. So weighted down was she that she was unable to escape as I grabbed a loose, lean switch to drive home a lesson on manners. I was further incensed when, instead of crying, she called out, \"Are you going to let him do this, Marshal?\" I only then remembered Cogburn was there. There and sitting on his horse and watching the show. Lazy fellow. Lazy and without a bone of honor in is body. My own honor came back to me at Mattie Ross's appeal to the Law as poorly personified as it was in Cogburn's one-eyed gaze. \"No. I don't believe I will. Put your switch away, LaBoeuf.\" I walloped her well-protected backside again. I do believe she even felt it. \"I am to finish what I started!\" \"It'll be the biggest mistake you ever made, you Texas brush-propper,\" the Marshal said, his tone strangely laconic when contrasted with the click of his weapon. Well, faced with that, my anger cooled and I was myself abashed as Mattie Ross got to her feet, brushed herself off and scowled at me. With a grimace, she resettled an oversized hat on her head. I caught a glimpse of newsprint inside before she did so, and I realized that the hat was not hers, either. It might have been her father's. Regret sliced through my middle, thinking that I had been so incensed with this young woman who had been so recently bereft of her father. I had to remember her circumstances and make allowances. No longer did I see her as a girl, no matter what I might have said to the contrary. From the moment her eyes met mine after my ill-judged attempt at teaching her a lesson, Miss Ross was a young woman in my understanding of her. A brave girl who was doing the best she could to make things right. She went about it with the single-mindedness of a child at times, and with poorly-judged assessments, but she did her best. And I silently honored her for it as we remounted our horses and continued on with barely any conversation. It was as if Cogburn and I had been waiting for her, there on the bank of the river, strange as it may have seemed. We were waiting and, once we got our initial volatile greetings out of the way, we continued on as a unit. As if this were the way it was supposed to be. == \"Why are you shaking your head so vehemently?\" Mattie Ross inquired of me as she smoothed out her bedroll. \"I do not like this situation. We are too exposed, here.\" To give credit to her good sense, the young woman seemed inclined to listen to my discussion of campfire safety, but that ornery U.S. Marshal was determined to undermine me at every step. At times throughout that day and further, I would ponder in my mind which of the two of them was in fact more contrary: Cogburn or Ross. Finally, I had had it. Clutching my pipe securely and making sure I did not mischoose my words in front of a lady – however young she was – I said, \"You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn. I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.\" Cogburn was not a gentleman and his next words proved it. \"How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down there?\" I blushed on Mattie Ross's behalf, but a quick glance in her direction indicated that she likely did not understand the puerile implications of Cogburn's disgusting question. I ignored those implications completely in my response. \"My Appaloosa will be galloping when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed. Now make another joke about it. You are only trying to put on a show for this girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.\" Of course, I put in a few puerile overtones in my comeback, but Mattie did not appear to comprehend them, either, so I did not feel I had disgraced myself or the reputation of the Texas Rangers in my reproof. The Marshal tried to play it off as if there were no consequences. \"This is like women talking.\" \"Yes, that is the way! Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.\" He eyed me with that one eye of his narrowing in the firelight. \"I think she has got you pretty well figured.\" We both turned to study Mattie Ross. Her face was devoid of guile as she met our looks squarely. \"Anyone want to tell a story?\" So much for concerning myself about her unsullied ears.[Chapter 4] A/N: HELLO! I managed somehow to post before from an iPad (still not sure how I did that) but I am now back on my laptop. I owe some of y'all review replies and I will attend to that within the next 48 hours. Until then, here is the next chapter. Chapter Four: In Which LaBoeuf Hunts Alone I was well used to sleeping on the hard ground. I passed the night peaceably, remaining awake while Cogburn slept and then getting my rest in my turn, as was right. Never would that Marshal be able to say anything about a Texas Ranger not pulling his weight on a manhunt. Rising, I listened for the sound of running water so I could clean myself and answer the calls of Nature. But first, I assembled my gear. I would not leave my personal items out where that Marshal could do Lord alone knew what to them. \"I am going to take care of business,\" Marshal Cogburn informed me. \"You watch over Li'l Sis, there.' I checked on Miss Ross as I knelt to secure my sleeping roll. Her braids had come somewhat loose during the night and she was frowning in her sleep. Still, she had not complained a jot and I wondered if she had done a lot of sleeping on the ground in her short life. \"She is doing fine, Marshal,\" I said quietly. \"Of course. She has been camping!\" At that, he laughed at some private joke, his breath coming in gasps after a few moments. Mattie Ross slept on, oblivious. \"So we will go find Chaney and she can pay me the rest of what she owes me.\" \"What about my reward?\" I protested, scooping up my bedroll and stepping to my horse. I tried to keep my spurs quiet, out of deference to the young lady. \"I get a serious amount of money in Texas when I bring him back.\" Cogburn spit into the dry earth and looked around, scratching at the back of his neck. The sun was rising by the moment, though, and I really did not want to take half the day to make him see things my way. While I settled the saddle blanket on my Appaloosa and got him squared away, the Marshal and I discussed an arrangement. He was hired by Mattie Ross to bring her father's killer to justice. Justice would, then, be served in Chaney's execution. Which was also ordered by Texas. \"If you help me,\" I offered with what I thought was a good helping of humility, \"I will split the reward with you and you will come out the winner, by and large.\" \"That seems a good deal.\" We shook hands on it before I mounted and headed to the river to see to the necessaries. I remembered well Mattie Ross's comment about my hair and did, in fact, try to tame the wildness of it before I returned to my temporary traveling companions. But when I arrived, I heard her once again trying to dictate the course of our manhunt. And Cogburn was all but allowing it, the fool. Now, I had developed respect for the young bereaved woman, but she did not have experience in these matters. Nevertheless, Cogburn was hemming and hawing and letting himself be hoo-rah'd by the girl. \"I do not believe you, Marshal,\" I called out. \"It seems to me you're letting yourself be hoo-rah'd by her again.\" \"Hoo-rah'd?\" \"Yes, indeed.\" I directed a look at Mattie Ross and shook my head even as I lifted my hat to her as I would to any young woman upon meeting. \"We had an arrangement,\" I protested, leaning over the pommel of my saddle. \"And here you go –\" \"If you had any idea of how to conduct yourself and any proper military training,\" the Marshal began and then...well, I am afraid we got side-tracked. Between his pretended service and my rightful record, we got into something of a pissing contest, all under the dark, serious gaze of young Miss Ross. Next thing I knew, we had parted ways. == I was more than familiar with the man Mattie Ross called Chaney. To me, though, the man in the picture I had shown Miss Ross while she was in bed back in Fort Smith was known as Chelmsford . Cogburn had done me a small service by indicating that it was believed Chelmsford was riding with the Ned Pepper Gang. Following a group of men was far easier than tracking just one, so I was thankful for the information. The trick in such a pursuit would be to get my man separated from the rest. I did not relish killing all of the Ned Pepper Gang to achieve this goal, but I did not balk at it, either. The men in this gang, from report, were all deserving of a hangman's noose. I kept my weapons loaded and my wits keen as I followed a small pack of horses, most carrying about the same amount of weight, through the rocky, sandy terrain. I spotted them before a full day had passed. Having seen Chelmsford/Cheney before, I had a fair idea of what he looked like from a distance and my fists clenched at my sides as I dismounted to better hide among the sagebrush. I tied up my horse and even went so far as to remove the spurs from my boots so as to make my approach quiet. \"Shut your mouth, Tom Chaney,\" snapped one raspy voice into the smoke-laced darkness. \"I could not care less if your jaw aches. We are not going to find a physician to see to it. We are wanted men, have you forgotten?\" \"But Ned...\" \"No. We will go to the new place and meet with our friends and make arrangements for our next job.\" Someone spat into the gang's campfire and I heard a sizzle. I wondered what kind of shape these outlaws were in. It sounded to me as if Ned had them under tight control, so I would focus my attentions upon him – as soon as I could ascertain which of the men he was. I dared to go closer. A heavy breeze blew over them, bringing to me the smell of mesquite smoke, over-brewed coffee and the nose-flaring scent of frightened, filthy male. That was a stink I never forgot. I had to slide my feet, almost soundlessly, to mimic a small animal. No mean feat for a man my size, I can tell you. They traded insults and established a watch and settled in to snore like bears. I crept back to my mount and slept but little, I think, while I made sure they did not escape in the night. The next day was long. My mind admittedly wandered. I had left a young woman with that U.S. Marshal and, since I was the one on the trail of the scallywag she was trying to see punished for her father's killing, I knew they were not on this same trail and so Cogburn must be leading her who knew where. And could he really protect a young woman like her? My conscience began to pester me, make no mistake about that. I left due to my pride, and I knew it. And due to the honor due to the Texas Rangers. But what about the honor of an innocent girl? I frowned into the air and kept tracking Chelmsford and the Ned Pepper gang. All that long day, stopping only to grab the jerked beef in my saddlebags and to water my horse, I trailed them. It was dark when they sent out a scout ahead. I knew I had them and only wondered if I could get word back to Mattie Ross about the Chelmsford/Chaney. So that she would know that justice would find him and it would be final. Fate or Providence, however, had other plans.[Chapter 5] A/N: I was, er, busy while offline. Wrote a bit. Yeah. ;-) Chapter Five: In Which LaBoeuf Gets Shot and Bites His Tongue My chance came after dark. I spotted a smoke-trail curling into the clear night sky. Ned Pepper was very excited, if his voice was any indicator. \"See? They are there and waiting for us. We will join them and then it will be a hot meal for everyone.\" \"And a doctor?\" Chelmsford-Cheney said with half a moan in his voice. I smirked all to myself as Ned Pepper swore a blue streak at him. \"No, you foolish man. But there will be whiskey. This much, I think I can promise you.\" The men sounded content with that as they took off in awkward intervals toward the welcoming smoke of the cabin. It was my chance to separate Cheney from the herd, as it were, and I had experience in so doing. Quickly, I darted out from a concealing rock, ready to lasso or shoot with a revolver in one hand and a rope in the other. A Texas Ranger is prepared for any contingency. I was surprised when they halted and did a quick ride-around. I considered that they saw something to make them skittish and immediately – erroneously, as events later showed me – concluded that someone else was in their cabin. I decided to go forth and seek the aid of the unknown quantity. If I could be indoors, I could surprise Ned Pepper and his gang and perhaps get the drop on Chelmsford. I tied my horse on some sage – nothing too tight; my Appaloosa was a smart mount and if she needed to ride off for her own safety, I would allow it. Softly, I stepped forward, my boots sliding only with slight noise on the sandy earth. \"Hello?\" I cocked my revolver – I am not a fool – and reached the door with my free hand extended. Opening the door, I was going to go in, but something was making the back of my neck twitch and I realized that this could have been a trap. Not for me, of course – I was confident that Ned Pepper had not seen me. But for them, perhaps, or maybe even someone else. The world was, after all, a dangerous place. I froze, hearing hoofbeats, and turned absolutely on my guard. Then, I was startled by an entirely unexpected voice that both frightened me and – oddly enough – made me feel almost proud. \"We have to warn him, Marshal!\" It was Miss Ross, her firm exclamation rebounding off different faces of rock. Then, any pleasant associations were banished when the first of Ned Pepper's gang appeared and I saw starlight and moonlight bounce off the barrel of a rifle in the high boulders off to my right. I had walked right into a damned trap and there was nothing under God I could do about it, so I just prayed I would make it out alive. I waited for the riders, my memory reminding me that if Mattie were here, the drunken Marshal would be, too, so I might have someone on my side if it came to a gunfight. Such as he was. Four men on four horses, but none of them drew their guns. That made me nervous. Tense. Every muscle in my body tightened as I endeavored to keep my eyes on all of them while they spread out. An impossible feat, perhaps, but I did my best. My heart was thudding loudly against my ribs but I made no overt moves – even when one of the men started drawing a rope through his fingers. Oh, God, I prayed silently. Don't let me die here. Please. I am not a man who considers himself overly dependent upon the Almighty, nor do I quote from Scriptures as some young ladies do – as they do incessantly , I might add – but that does not mean I do not hold with Divine Providence. And I very much hoped Providence would keep me alive that night. \"Well, hello,\" Ned Pepper said, his voice easy and edged with laughter. \"Where did you come from, Ranger?\" I stood tall, determined to meet this threat with a straight spine. I said a prayer for Miss Mattie Ross while I drew in a breath to calm myself. I hoped she would not be too adversely affected by the doings there that evening. \"Just out of the night,\" I said slowly. Then, everything went to Hell. A rifle has a certain sound when it is fired. The echo is different, the shot sounds unique, and I have prided myself on my keen ear in such matters. When the bullet hit me high in the chest, knocking me over, I thought for sure that my prayers were being roundly denied. The pain was brutal, and I had a flash of a thought that it hadn't been a rifle from Ned Pepper's Gang, either. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, though, had a rifle and I knew in my gut it had been him who had shot me! Pain flared as I forced myself to my feet again, but I would have gone on and tried to get to Chelmsford. I would have, for I had a job to do and people who depended upon my ability to get it done. But it was not to be. I heard the whistling in the air a scant second before I felt the rope about my arms and body. \"Ha!\" the gang member said in a triumphant sort of way. Before the sound died off, I had been jerked to the ground. I swore under my breath – I remembered there was a lady present, not too far away – and just then the gunfire started. A rifle cracked, horse hooves kicked the dirt up around my head and the man who had roped me started to haul me away. I opened my mouth, but it got shut again, quite hard, and I almost bit my damned tongue in half! The pain was horrible and blood filled my mouth. I imagined I had bitten my tongue completely off , so intense was the suffering. Being dragged along, choking on my own blood and feeling as if a hot poker had been run through my body, I still tried to keep an awareness of the situation. The cacophony that surrounded me was not to be believed. Horses screaming in that way they have when they are scared. Men shouting fit to wake the dead. Gunfire that echoed and made it seem to my ears that there were fifty armed men in a circle about me as my captor tried to steal me away. What he had in mind to do with me, I did not want to know. Rooster Cogburn's rifle fired again, and I imagined that gunfire had been directed at him and Miss Ross, but I couldn't maneuver myself, bound as I was, to see if she was all right. Plucky girl; she was probably cheering him on. Ridiculous female. Feisty, but ridiculous. A sudden stillness descended on us in the darkness. And I heard the Marshal's voice, laconic as ever. \"Well, that didn't pan out.\" Exhaustion temporarily overtook my limbs and all I could do was try to spit the blood from my mouth to keep from choking on it. I heard boots and long, heavy steps followed by the quicker, lighter steps of the girl as they made their way to me. I was nudged and rolled over with surprising gentleness, considering it had been a boot that did the work. \"You managed to put a kink in my rope, pardner.\" His rope? His rope! I protested. \"I am severely injured!\" I tried to tell him. And it hurt as if someone had my tongue in a pair of blacksmith's tongs, I have to say. My words came out with a heavy lisp, so they were muddled and sounded like I am theverely injure . I felt quite unmanned to be honest, as Mattie Ross stared down at me. Always practical, she did not interfere as the club-fisted Marshal threatened to rip my tongue out the rest of the way. Persnickety female. She left me, an injured fellow, to inspect the corpses! \"None of these men are Chaney, Marshal,\" she complained. I knew that, but I couldn't work my mouth around the words as the Marshal assisted me to my feet. The two of them nattered on about snow and burials, but I hurt like nobody's business and wanted only to get my wounds cleaned and to have a few shots of whatever liquor the Marshal had stowed away.[Chapter 6] Chapter Six: In Which LaBoeuf Talks Law and Rides in Company Liquor, as most people are aware, is an excellent cleaning agent for wounds. It is not bad at dulling pain, either. I enjoyed both benefits as I cleaned my Sharp's carbine in the cabin previously occupied by Ned Pepper's associates. Marshal Cogburn used his own flask of spirits to handle whatever ailments of mind or body plagued him. The fire in the hearth was quite bright for the small cabin, but it cast a shadow over most of Cogburn's aging body, leaving me with a view of his booted feet. His vocal abilities – unlike my own – were unimpaired, however. \"Of course we have had legal training, you sheep-sleeping Ranger,\" Cogburn slurred from the shadow. His continual denigration of the Texas Rangers was wearing thin, but I set my sore jaw against it. The tensing of my muscles only made my wound – the damned wound Cogburn himself denied giving me! – ache further as I cleaned my weapon. \"So you say. So tell me, Marshal, how do you classify the murder of Mattie Ross's father?\" He hemmed and hawed like the poser he was, and challenged me to do the classification, casting aspersions on my temporary speech impediment. I do not choose, as I recollect this, to demonstrate the thickness of my tongue as it was then – I can only say that if you were to tie a cord around the middle of a man's tongue and then compel him to drink and try to speak clearly, he would have sounded much as I did that evening in the cabin. \"As I understand it,\" I told Cogburn as Miss Ross came in the cabin's only door, bringing with her fresh air and the whiff of snow, \"Chaney—or Chelmsford, as he called himself in Texas—shot the Senator's dog. When the Senator remonstrated, Chelmsford shot him as well.\" I had Mattie Ross's interested attention at that point and, I confess, had to show off a little. She had denied me pride of place in continuing to place her trust in the U.S. Marshal at the beginning of our adventure, and I felt she had to be made to understand just how badly she had underestimated me – and overestimated him! \"You could argue,\" I said to that end, \"that the shooting of the dog was merely an instance of malum prohibitum , but the shooting of a senator is indubitably an instance of malum in se .\" I did my best not to appear too self-satisfied as Cogburn rolled sloppily up to an almost-upright posture, an empty bottle dangling from his fingers. \"Malla men what ?\" Suppressing a smile, I braced myself against another bout of speech but was forestalled by young Miss Ross. Her clear voice was entirely matter-of-fact as she attempted to educate the marshal. \" Malum in se . The distinction is between an act that is wrong in itself, and an act that is wrong only according to our laws and mores. It is Latin,\" she concluded with a nod. That young woman had no sentiment in her body, I was fairly certain, but she had a solid understanding. Rooster Cogburn, on the other hand, was nothing but a drunken bag of wind. \"I am struck that LeBoeuf is shot, trampled, and nearly severs his tongue and not only does not cease to talk but spills the banks of English.\" He swilled down more of his favorite liquid idiocy and fell back on the only bed in the cabin. To further display his entire lack of gentlemanly behavior, he never offered the comfort of the mattress to the only female in our party. Mattie Ross and I sighed in mutual sympathy with one another before she moved to the fire to serve up some weak soup. \"Hungry, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" she asked in her chipper manner. I had not wished to acknowledge the gnawing in my belly – a Ranger can go for days without nourishment if he must – but her question was not condescending. \"I am.\" Without giving me room for argument, she proceeded to partially unman me by feeding me, like a child, spoon by spoon of broth with softened chunks of cornbread. I felt I owed it to the honor of the Rangers to continue to clean the carbine while I accepted her aid. In truth, it would have been difficult to have managed the soup with my shoulder. And, like a proper lady, she made no comment about the slight mess I made due to my mangled tongue. Indeed, she smiled a little at me as I finished. \"Thank you,\" I mumbled, trying to be clear, but feeling suddenly exhausted. \"You are quite welcome. It is the very least I can do for you, Mr. LaBoeuf.\" It was in my mind to ask her to call me by my given name, William, in that hour. We seemed to have gone beyond the bonds of \"Mister\" and \"Miss\" by that point. Especially when she made me up a padded area upon which to sleep, using a fur that had been rolled and left for trade in the corner of the cabin. But, I did not. == With her hair in its customary rigid braids, Mattie Ross rode behind me the next day. We traveled single file, the three of us, with Cogburn in the lead. I did not trust him to ride the rear. His drunken attempts at singing were enough to have Miss Ross and I exchanging laughing looks mile after mile. I had never felt quite so in harmony with her and again the notion occurred to me to eschew the formality of our current speech, but with Cogburn's presence, it did not seem wholly proper either. Especially as he seemed out to impress his young employer. \"Fort Smith is a healthy distance, LaBoeuf, but I would encourage the creature you ride to try to make it in a day. Out here, a one-armed man is easy prey.\" The nerve of the man! Fury and a desire to supplant him as primary leader of our manhunt, had me urging my horse on a bit. \"And a one-eyed man who can't shoot?\" I shot back as well as I was able with my mangled mouth. With a quick look back at Mattie Ross, I tried to gauge her reaction to Cogburn's challenge. Her mien impassive, she seemed to favor neither of us. I was riled but calmed myself somewhat. Was I competing for the notice of a child? Against that relic of a man, Cogburn? What was the matter with me? Clearly, I needed to heed my mother's occasional hints and seek out feminine companionship. Rooster Cogburn lived up to his reputation as a cocky reprobate by trying ineffectually to prove his marksmanship. I managed to take the upper ground during his flailing demonstration. Miss Ross and myself once again found ourselves as two observers of one off-balance lawman. And I liked that. I liked that rather more than was comfortable. To distract myself, I threw cornbread targets into the sky as well and, I will say it, I proved better with my one arm and two eyes than Cogburn did with his two arms and one eye. Miss Ross grew impatient with our display and started riding off on her own, annoyance flaring from her upright form on her black horse. \"Gentlemen, shooting cornbread out here on the prairie is getting us no closer to the Ned Pepper gang,\" she called over her shoulder. Chastened, the Marshal and I ceased our ridiculous contest and got back to work. We rode on, following Cogburn's understanding of the Territory, and came at length to a mine that had been carved into the face of a hillside. There was a camp that had been set there, but the darkened fire ring was cold and the scraps of bone from a meal had been picked clean. The trail was cold and regret filled me, as did frustration. Had I been wasting my time, traveling with Miss Ross and Cogburn? Had I let my quarry get too far away? I had I poorly served the Texas Rangers out of a misguided sense of – something – that kept me with Mattie Ross? Cogburn was not apparently afflicted with my misgivings. Bold as brass, he strode to the open mouth of the mine. \"Lucky Ned!\" I felt as though the world sat in stillness as we waited for an answer. Miss Ross sidled up closer to me as we waited. Close enough that I could feel warmth from her person against my arm. We waited...for nothing. I huffed a breath in my feeling of helplessness. \"Very good, Cogburn,\" I sneered. \"Now what?\" A/N: Just wanted to thank you all for reading along! :) The story is still going![Chapter 7] A/N: I realize I've veered from the movie in small ways before now, but here is where I take a giant step off the trail. You have been warned! ;-) Chapter Seven: In Which LaBoeuf Does Not Abandon a Young Lady in Need \"I know it hurts, Mr. LaBoeuf, but you need to eat. Your body cannot heal if it is not fed. That is only sense,\" Miss Ross stated, pushing more hard cornbread in and out of a thicker soup than had been afforded in a cabin once upon an evening. We were in the open again, with barely a covering for our heads against a freezing rain after the Marshal's wild goose chase came to a sudden end at the abandoned mine. I felt the chill of the night through the bullet hole in my body, flaring with bright flashes of pain through my skull. My jaw was swollen – I had taken quite the series of injuries on the night I was shot – and I was feeling a wish to be steeped in spirits once again. However, as Cogburn was more drunk than usual, I refrained. We had a young woman with us and she had to be protected. I tried to take the tin cup from Mattie Ross and feed myself; in front of an awake, belligerent Rooster Cogburn, I was loathe to be treated in quite the same way that I tolerated when he was barely conscious. I directed a glare at the doddering older man. \"Cogburn does not want me eating out of his store,\" I muttered, too conscious of the malformation of my words as they came from my mouth. Mattie clucked her tongue at me. \"That is silly. You have not eaten the whole day.\" This was true. It hurt like fire to chew anything and even a mild soup was painful to maneuver with my shoulder and mouth in the states they were in. \"Besides, it is my store you eat from, not his.\" \"Let him starve!\" Cogburn blasted from his side of the fire. Once again, I had the visual image of the Marshal versus Miss Ross and myself. That was not how this venture began, to be sure. Cogburn heaved himself to stand – sort of – on both feet before stooping to gather a few branches for the fire. I could smell the alcohol strongly on him as he continued to rant, spittle flying from his mouth while his hands wove drunkenly in the gloaming. \"He does not track. He does not shoot – except at foodstuffs.\" \"That was your idea,\" I protested. The marshal affected not to hear me. \"He does not contribute! He is a millstone, with opinions! He is a man who walks in front of bullets!\" I winced at the diatribe, for he was correct in the generalities, even if he bombasted over the rationale. Mattie Ross rose to my defense, still holding the cup with my uneaten dinner. Her eyes flashed as she said, \"Mr. LaBoeuf drew single-handed upon the Lucky Ned Pepper Gang while we fired safely from cover, like a band of sly Injuns!\" \"We?\" Cogburn retorted. \"It is unfair to indict a man when his jaw is swollen and tongue mangled and who is therefore unable to rise to his own defense!\" Miss Ross could one day make an admirable attorney, if females were allowed to do such a thing. But they really were not; I had to speak for myself. \"I can speak for myself,\" I said to her more than to him, though I knew he heard my words. \"I am hardly obliged to answer the ravings of a drunkard. It is beneath me.\" I felt Miss Ross's shock and sudden stillness as I rose to gather my things. I had pride, always, and it was not best served by being baby-fed by a young woman nor by being constantly belittled by a lunatic. \"I shall make my own camp elsewhere,\" I declared, nodding a bit to Mattie Ross, my manly dignity doing its best to cover the weaknesses I suffered under. \"It is you who have nothing to offer, Cogburn. A sad picture indeed. This is no longer a manhunt. It is a debauch.\" Mattie gasped and I pressed my lips together in an effort not to answer her wordless realization or shock. \"The Texas Ranger presses on alone,\" I concluded. \"Take the girl. I bow out!\" Appalled, I rounded on him, my arms full of my bedroll. \"A fine thing to decide once you have brought her into the Choctaw Nation!\" He seemed to care not at all. \"I bow out. I wash my hands,\" he slurred falling back on a fur and belching grossly. I was not surprised when Mattie Ross tried to make peace between us. She stood, still holding the damned soup that had prompted this whole mess, her back straight and eyes forthright. \"Gentlemen, we cannot fall out in this fashion, so close to our goal, with Tom Chaney nearly in hand!\" Then it was that U.S. Marshal Cogburn showed his true colors in a most horrible, ugly manner. He planted his hands on his spread knees and leaned toward the fire. \"In hand? If he is not in a shallow grave, somewhere between here and Fort Smith, he is gone! Long gone! Thanks to Mr. LeBoeuf, we missed our shot! We have barked, and the birds have flown! Gone gone gone! Lucky Ned and his cohort, gone! Your fifty dollars, gone! Gone the whiskey seized in evidence! The trail is cold, if ever there was one! I am a foolish old man who has been drawn into a wild goose chase by a harpy in trousers—and a nincompoop! Well, Mr. LeBoeuf can wander the Choctaw Nation for as long as he likes; perhaps the local Indians will take him in and honor his gibberings by making him Chief! You, sister, may go where you like! I return home! Our engagement is terminated! I bow out!\" At first, I was moving under the strength of my own sense of pride and anger. Ignoring the deep pain in my body, I was able to lash my gear to my sturdy Appaloosa. I saw my breath come out in white clouds of steam in the night air. I huffed a great deal and muttered a considerable amount – imprecations against incompetent law men and adventures that took far too long and even against young ladies who sought to do the work of men. I swung myself up on my horse and pondered my next move. Until the nearest young lady of my acquaintance approached, her saddle all but overwhelming her as she crunched in too-large boots across the light coating of snow on the mountain ground. \"I am coming with you,\" Mattie Ross informed me as she reached the makeshift rope fence we had established for the horses. There was an air to her that I could not comprehend, but it struck me over and over again nevertheless. An air of authority not usually seen in a woman, and certainly not in such a young one, encompassed her. Still, I had to refuse her. \"That is not possible.\" \"Have I held you back? I have a Colt's dragoon revolver that I know how to use and I would be of no more burden to you than I was to the Marshal.\" She did not look back at the drunkard, but stood stalwart before me. I sighed, loudly, and thought hard. \"You have earned your spurs,\" I admitted to her. Spurs were, in my reckoning of things, the visible sign of a competent Ranger. Indeed, we in my troop only awarded them to a seasoned Ranger who had proven himself. Mattie Ross had more than done so. \"But, Miss Ross, the trail is cold. And I am considerably...diminished,\" I admitted to her. \"You cannot give up,\" she told me in her definitive manner. \"You have been chasing him for so long and we almost have him in our grasp!\" I wanted to believe she was right. I wanted to believe for both of us. But it was winter. And she was out here on the trail alone, without anyone to speak for her but a drunken lawman. She had taken too much on her slender shoulders. I did not know how to answer her. My extended silence must have done to her what nothing else on this dire night had – her eyes welled with tears and her voice broke. Mattie Ross, who had handled every adversity with courage and a clear eye, sagged as she regarded me. \"I misjudged you,\" she whispered. \"I picked the wrong man.\" Her words hit me like a runaway train and I slipped from my horse. Mattie Ross never, ever had admitted to making a mistake. Not in the entire time I had known her. She was not capable of backing down, even when it would have been the wisest course. That she had admitted – finally – this error in judgment made me think hard and fast about what I would have left her to if I did indeed follow through with my own course. It would have been a grave error in my own judgment to leave her here with a drunkard. Here in the middle of the Choctaw without a real protector who might do her some good. Even if we turned around tomorrow, I could get her back to Fort Smith. I could take her home to Yell County, even, and privately resolved to do so. The trail for Chelmsford had gone cold, but here was another responsibility of mine: I had to return Miss Mattie Ross to her mother. Her home. I extended my hand to her. \"I misjudged you initially, too, Miss Ross. I would be proud to ride at your side, now.\" Stubborn girl wiped at her eyes and smiled into mine and, in spite of my swollen jaw, I had to grin at her. \"This is a wonderful birthday present, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she informed me. I chuckled and watched as she ducked her head before saddling her mount. \"Your birthday?\" \"I am just fifteen today.\" With exaggerated humor, I tipped my hat to her as I remounted my horse. \"Happy birthday then, Miss Ross.\"[Chapter 8] A/N: Still with me? Good! Chapter Eight: In Which the Ranger is Terrified \"Do you suppose,\" I ventured quietly as Mattie Ross and I trotted slowly from our prior encampment, \"that you and I could abandon our formalities?\" \"I beg your pardon?\" I felt my ears heat with a sudden discomfort and pulled my hat lower over my forehead. \"I only meant that if we are going to be traveling together, it would be far easier to dispense with the 'Mr. LaBoeuf' business and the 'Miss Ross' business and just be William and Mattie .\" \"I hardly think it is up to you to define these boundaries, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she snapped in a low tone. \"I realize that my – my insistence upon hunting for my father's killer myself is rather untoward, but there was no one else to do the job. This does not make me any less a lady and therefore the 'Mr. LaBoeuf' and 'Miss Ross' business will continue until I say otherwise.\" Offended, I still had to acknowledge – to myself – that she was in the right and I said nothing. She was by her own admission a young lady. A fifteen-year-old young lady and as such she was old enough to – I gulped back a hard jolt of surprise. Being alone with me, a single man, was enough to seriously compromise a young lady such as Miss Mattie Ross. I did not want to be put in that position. Neither did I wish for her to be maligned for being alone with a single man under forty. As she had been the Marshal's employer, of a kind, and he was in fact much older than I, that the three of us had traveled together was unexceptional in that Miss Ross would have been considered chaperoned. With me, she would not be. Even though her virtue was as safe with me as it would be with any other Ranger. Even more so, because I had her interest in my sights. I decided, therefore, that we would not wander far from Marshal Rooster Cogburn. I planned to find him in the morning, once the whiskey had left him and he could view his abandonment of Miss Ross in the shameful light of day. I did not share this plan with Mattie – her insistence on formality be hanged, I could not keep wrapping my mind around Miss Mattie or Miss Ross or Mattie Ross in every single thought. Instead, I just tried to ignore my growling stomach and looked for a new campsite. And I did my utmost to banish any thought in my head that Mattie Ross was fifteen years old. I especially did my best to remember that my little sister was engaged to be married at that age. My sister, Caroline LaBoeuf, never did see her sixteenth birthday. == I should have tried to remain awake. I should have shaken off the comforting influences of the hot meal Mattie made me eat, of the fire I built – larger than that I would have had for myself, but I was trying to keep Mattie warm, too – and of the knowledge that my companion had admitted to misjudging me, before. I should have been more alert. Instead, I allowed myself to relax into sleep so that I could escape the various vibrating pains all over my body. Besides, being awake meant studying the young girl who entrusted her safety to me. Remembering how I had initially told her I had thought to kiss her – how had I considered that? – made my skin heat again. It was better all the way around to just sleep, I decided. I would be a better tracker with a night of rest. A better Ranger. == The gunfire awakened me. The report of a revolver echoed – only once. I jolted to my feet, feeling the warmth of my blanket fall to my feet, as my eyes first sought for Mattie Ross. My heart dropped deep into my gut before bounding up to my throat. She was gone. \"Mattie? Miss Ross?\" I called, seeing that her horse, Blackie, was still tethered cozily with my own trusty mount. Panic rushed into my chest, pushing out the pain I had carried. I swallowed huge gulps of air as I quickly surveyed our campsite. \"All right. She has got the water bag. Fine. All right.\" Mattie had likely taken the bag and gone for water. There was some not far from us – the proximity of a small river had been a factor for the choice of the campsite we had shared with Cogburn the day before. A young lady had personal issues to see to, as well, and she would best do that by herself. Still. There had been a gunshot ! What if there were ne'er-do-wells at the river? What if they – they saw her? Propriety be damned, I had to get to her. Even if she scowled and cast aspersions on my character for so doing. I was terrified as I scrabbled on foot to the river. Voices carried up to me. Only one of them was Mattie's. The other was far too familiar. Chelmsford! \"Mattie!\" I had no idea if my voice conveyed my fear for her or if it spoke only of my shock that she had found him. It was as if Providence was on her side, after all. But then, I heard another voice. \"Mattie!\" Marshal Cogburn! I suspected, there in that instant, that he had been filled with remorse for his treatment of Miss Ross the night before and had come to the river to find either her or myself. \"I am down here,\" the young lady called, sounding cool and calm and every inch in control of the situation. \"Chaney is taken into custody!\" What the hell did she think she was doing? Pushing through the brush and around trees, I heard the soft sounds of the river and the interruptions of feet sloshing through a shallow crossing. Oh, Lord, I prayed – again! – please keep Mattie Ross safe! \"Stop!\" she shouted, sounding frightened. My heart pounded fiercely within me. She made some unclear sounds that were followed by, \"Help me! Down here! Hurry up!\" No! I finally reached the water and would have crossed it, too, as I saw Mattie Ross being slung like a sack of potatoes over Chaney's shoulder. \"No!\" I demanded, my own revolver in my hand. I fired, but was fired upon as well. Cogburn did his own share of shooting and I should have counted myself lucky enough not to stop another of his bullets with my chest. We crossed gazes, the Marshal and I, and drew near to each other on the shore. \"Marshal, you have broken her faith in you. It is your fault that she has been taken,\" I declared, unable to stop myself. \"I accept a share of the blame – I slept – but if she had been with you, this would not have happened.\" \"Shut your mouth, LaBoeuf. I will not get into it right now. Right now, we need to get her back.\" He sneered at me, his lip curling and his eye narrowed. \"That is, if you can shoot any better than you just did.\" \"Cogburn! Do you hear me?\" \"Ned,\" the Marshal whispered to me. \"You will answer me, Rooster. I will kill this girl! You know I will do it!\" My mouth was dry. \"I will get my rifle and give chase,\" I told Cogburn. \"You do as seems best to you as you know him.\" He nodded and I turned to run without care as to the sound I made in passing. As I reached our camp, I heard \"...give me time!\" What in the name of the Almighty was that man doing? I did not trust him to serve Mattie Ross's best interest. I had to do it myself. I vowed that I would find her and let her end Chaney with my own Sharp's carbine. If I found her alive and well, that is. If not – My mind refused to follow that train of thought.[Chapter 9] A/N: I just wanted to take a moment and thank everyone who is reading and adding this to your lists and a special shout out to y'all who are reviewing and sharing your smiles with me. :) You make my day! ~ LJ Chapter Nine: In Which the Ranger Finds the Girl It took me precious time to pack up the campsite from the night before. I did my best to focus on it, trying not to contemplate what Mattie might be suffering at the hands of Ned Pepper and his gang. I tried to remember every piece of information Cogburn had shared with me regarding Ned Pepper. He was a murderer, but he had a strange affectation for young women and tried to be charming. Mattie would not heed any ruse of his, but if the girl had a reckless tongue on her and – I heard Cogburn's voice call out, \"LaBoeuf! I have a proposition for you.\" \"What?\" I quite despised the man at that juncture, but two were better than one. \"I have a long-standing vendetta against Ned Pepper. I will follow him. You get Little Sister away and safe. If you can then see your way clear to helping me, I will not try to stop you.\" I snorted. \"You would need help against that gang, I am sure.\" \"Go,\" he said with a half-steady arm. \"You might need help yourself, before this day is over.\" I hoped that he was wrong. I hoped that I would find Mattie hale and hole and feisty as ever. I even hoped that Marshal Cogburn would make it out all right, too. He had left ahead of me and I heard the shouted conversation he was having with Ned Pepper. Cogburn made it sound as if Mattie Ross meant next to nothing to him and that he would leave her just to be rid of the trouble. I hoped Mattie did not hear him and grow discouraged. She was a smart young woman, though. I felt almost confident that she would be trying to either talk her way out of a difficult circumstance or trying to persuade Pepper to allow her to shoot the man who had killed her father. I almost smiled at the imagined conversation. Until I saw the overlying tracks of several horses heading off in one direction – and heard a man's voice – Chaney's voice – carrying across the dry air to me from another. \"And you would give me an affidavit !\" Even through the anxiety that possessed me in that moment, I felt my battered mouth widen in a smile. Mattie Ross, you are one of a kind . Then, I realized that Mattie was likely alone with her father's murderer and the smile disappeared as if it had never been. I checked my weapons, slid from the Appaloosa and tied her with a light loop to the low branch of a tree before following the threatening sounds of that voice. The pounding in my chest that echoed in the healing bullet wound there as well as in my tongue had nothing to do with pain and everything to do with what I saw as I crested the ridge and saw the dip of earth just before the edge of land fell off into a fertile valley. It wasn't the breathtaking landscape that had me frozen. It was fear. My quarry was there. Mattie Ross was, as well. Chaney had her on the ground and I almost screamed in fury. Instead, I lifted my rifle to take aim at him, but – I could not fire. He bent himself almost double over Mattie's form, a large knife glinting in the morning sun. That knife was pressed against Mattie's neck. If I fired and missed – unlikely, but I could not wager my bad arm against the life of a young woman – I could hurt or kill Miss Ross. And even if I did not, it was highly likely that Chelmsford – who was a man not averse to bloodshed – would kill her anyway. No, I had to disable him in such a way that his knife would no longer be a threat to Mattie. Fear tastes like gunmetal in the mouth. I tasted it in its fullness of flavor as I stepped lightly and far too slowly across the packed earth to where Mattie was. So far as I could tell, she was still in one piece, only staring as well as she could at the handle of the knife that was threatening her. \"...But here,\" he was saying with a threat as loud as his voice was low, \"at least I have matters in hand, and once I have done for you –\" It was the last word I heard before I swung my rifle up and down with every ounce of strength in my body. Thwack! I hit him on the side of the head with a most satisfactory sound. Drooling mud and sweat and spit, he collapsed on Mattie before I could manage to gather myself enough to pull him off of her. I kicked him to his back. \"So. This is Chelmsford.\" I pulled Mattie up with my good arm, assessing her appearance. Her hat had been pushed off, but I didn't even see a scratch on her face or anywhere on her skin. Her eyes were curious. So were mine, I was sure. I cleared my throat, but made myself maintain eye contact with her. \"Did anyone hurt you, Miss Ross?\" \"Not at all.\" I cocked my head, wanting to make sure I had made myself absolutely clear. \"Are you sure?\" Another pass of my gaze over her person was clear enough, I was fairly certain. The color came to her cheeks and she looked beyond me to some point over my shoulder. \"I am sure , Mr. LaBoeuf.\" She shook herself and regained her poise. \"I am – I am happy to see you.\" Before I could respond to that, she went on. \"Where is the Marshal? I heard him yelling, before.\" \"I hope his words did not upset you.\" A crease formed between her dark brows. \"Why would they? He was being sensible and I realized that the two of you would have come up with a plan. I knew you had found one another by the river.\" I laughed short and hard. \"There is no one to equal you, Miss Ross. Yes, we have a plan. His part, I fear, is rash. Now watch out,\" I cautioned as we moved to the rocks that marked the end of the land at this place. \"There is a pit there. Mind your footing. This shelf of earth, here, will be safe. Ah, there he is.\" \"And is that – is that Ned Pepper?\" \"It does appear to be so.\" I felt her settle just behind me, leaning forward to see as best she could while I took up my rifle once more. Now that Mattie Ross was safe and away from any threat, I would see what could be done to help United States Marshal Rooster Cogburn. \"One against four,\" she murmured at length. \"It is ill-advised.\" I sighed. \"He would not be dissuaded.\" \"I can reload for you, if you wish. I am afraid,\" she added in an ashamed tone of voice, \"that I dropped my father's revolver in the river.\" I hefted my rifle up and sighted on the men below in the meadow. \"Thank you. I hope I will not need to reload. If he needs my help, I will likely have only one chance to render it.\" \"Oh.\" That was all she said before she focused her entire bearing on the figures moving closer together below us. Words were exchanged, surely, but we could not hear them. I could only squint against the sun and keep my arms and fingers ready to fire. Some of them men splintered off and Cogburn waved two hands in the air. Mattie gasped. \"Shoot them, Mr. LaBoeuf!\" \"Too far,\" I told her. \"Moving too fast.\" I controlled my breathing so that my chest did not heave in and out so much as to offset my aim. I watched, feeling almost helpless even with my carbine as Rooster squared off like King Arthur's jousting knights from an old story in a fairy-tale land. Shots were fired. Cogburn went down. \"No!\" rasped Mattie. I wished I could have reassured her, but I had to bring everything in me to aim at Ned Pepper. \"Oh, Lord,\" I breathed. And fired. The gun bucked back into my wounded shoulder and I screamed with the agony of it. Mattie's hands were there, though; I could feel her checking the dressing on the wound even as she shouted, \"Some bully shot! Four hundred yards, at least! He's down!\" Gratified to have hit my target, I still moaned. \"I am afraid I have –\" And then, in a blinding flash of pain, I fell over and knew no more.[Chapter 10] A/N: Hey, that last chapter was close to canon... And now, we continue with my twisty little imagination... Chapter Ten: In Which There is a Desperate Ride \"LaBoeuf!\" Water dribbled on my face and then splashed. \"Come on! Mattie's got herself stuck. No time to be sleeping on the job.\" \"Mattie?\" I whispered, my tongue stiff in my mouth. \"Chelmsford?\" \"He is dead and down the cliff, sir. Nice shooting.\" \"I did not shoot him.\" \"Then I guess she did herself. I should buy Sister a drink.\" He reached down to help me up and I did not deny him the privilege of so doing. I needed help and we needed to get to Mattie. \"So she is in the pit and –\" I heard her scream. \"Ahh!\" Rooster was at the mouth of that pit in an instant. I could not follow. I tried, but my balance was off and I became instantly dizzy so that I had to rest against the stacked rocks. I saw my horse appear over the ridge and wondered if the Marshal had loosed her or if she had managed that her own self. \"What is that?\" Cogburn yelled into the pit. \"Snake! I am bit!\" My hazy brain sharpened at the words. And though I winced at the subsequent gunshots, expecting to hear Mattie scream again as the misfiring Marshal hit her instead of a snake, I drew near as well. The smoke cleared and I could see Cogburn struggling and slipping and stepping down to her, over layers of rock, roots of trees, and down to a shelf where Mattie lay, angled oddly and looking pale in the dark that surrounded her. My chest tightened and I strove to stand upright, knowing I had to do my best. \"Does Mr. LaBoeuf survive?\" she asked. I was shocked, surprised and pleased that she had done thought to ask, what with her immediate danger. \"He does. Even a blow to the head cannot shut up a Texas Ranger for long.\" There was silence as I made my wobbly way to my horse. \"Can you move?\" the Marshal asked Miss Ross. \"My leg is pinned. It might – it might be broken.\" \"All right then. LaBoeuf!\" I knew what would be needed. Knowing I could in no way have strength enough to pull both man and girl from danger, I had to use the sturdy shoulders of my Appaloosa to do so for me. With my rope, I made a sort of pulley around the nearest tree trunk and had my mount stand by while I threw the end of the rope into the pit. I saw the rope move and grow taut. \"I have her,\" Cogburn said, his voice echoing in ripples out of the pit. \"Up with us.\" I led my horse gently forward so that Mattie would not be jerked and hurt further on our account. As soon as they were clear of the hole in the ground, I halted the mare and hurried to Mattie's side, to relieve the Marshal of his burden. \"Miss Ross,\" I breathed, supporting her against my side. She blinked into my face. \"Mr. LaBoeuf. You are badly injured.\" \"We have to get her to help, LaBoeuf. She has been bitten and needs care immediately.\" Nodding, I tried to whistle to my mount. She stepped past the Marshal to my side and helped to support Mattie. \"I can carry her. We will go together.\" Cogburn looked fit to chew iron. \"I will take her and send help back to you. Do not wander off.\" \"We are not leaving him!\" Mattie insisted, though in a weaker voice than I had ever heard her use before. I picked up the hand that was cut and bleeding still from the quick treatment Cogburn had given to Mattie's snakebite. \"Thank you.\" \"Fine! But she will ride with me, Ranger. You are barely fit to hold up your own head, much less carry a female.\" The poison was clearly working in Mattie Ross's arm, so I did not argue. As soon as the Marshal was on his horse, I hefted Mattie up to him and helped her settle in. Then, I mounted my own horse and we began the most desperate ride of my life. == Scarpering our way down the side of the mountain, I paid close heed to the Marshal's ability to bear his burden. Mattie seemed to managing all right, though that she put up no fight at all in being borne like a sack of flour was an indicator as to the gravity of her situation. She was feeling the bite. Badly. The sun climbed in the sky as we rode to wherever it was Cogburn knew she would be treated. \"How far is it?\" I called to him, as our horses rode harder than was wise. I worried for Little Blackie, upon which Cogburn was mounted. My mount, of course, was hardy, even after the trials of the day. \"Far.\" \"We should trade off, Cogburn. Miss Ross's horse, there, needs a bit of a rest.\" \"Yes.\" The strain he was feeling showed in his taciturnity, and I was glad enough to have any reason at all to allow the horses a bit of a breath before we began another drag of hard riding. For ride we did. Holding Miss Ross against me, bearing most of her weight with my good arm, I directed the Appaloosa with my injured one. She followed Little Blackie as the light passed from the sky, leaving it dark and cloudless and cold at first. The horses' breath came in white trails of steam, their bodies steaming likewise as the air cooled. In a rare lucid moment, Mattie turned her head and studied her horse. \"Little Blackie,\" she murmured. I ducked my head to hear her better. \"What?\" \"So tired. Needs a rest.\" \"No, Sister,\" Cogburn called. \"You need a doctor.\" And so it went, mile after mile, as the clouds moved over us at last and a light snow began to fall. At long last, even my reliable Appaloosa began to find the ride too arduous for her. Little Blackie's flanks were heaving and we had to abandon the horses as Mattie was unwilling for us to run them quite into the ground. Then, it became a matter of carrying the girl. She grew feverish, a sour sweat coming from her skin by turns with fresh renewals of the fever brought on by the bite. She began to rant against Chaney, Cogburn and even myself – berating me for the threat of a kiss or a spanking on our first meeting. It seemed months had passed since then, but in truth it had been perhaps a week. At most. \"We have to hurry,\" I panted at the Marshal. \"I know it.\" We ran, then, as fast as we were able, trading off the ever-increasing burden of the young woman in our arms. Our steps started to stagger. My heart beat too hard, my sides burned and the various wounds I had suffered in this manhunt screamed out for rest and healing but we could not stop. They were minor in concern compared to the immediacy of a deadly snake bite. \"She's dying,\" Rooster Cogburn opined at last. \"God help us all, she will not make it.\" \"She must,\" I gasped. He and I held her together, our steps only slightly faster than a slow jog as we kept moving. \"Too stubborn to die, this one.\" He tried to laugh, as did I. But my own breath was choked by tears as much as by exertion. I could not let her die. Cogburn let out a grunt and fell to his knees. I joined him. A light shone not too far distant. \"Fire. Gun,\" he rasped between heaving breaths. My arm felt like lead, but I did as he instructed, managing to fire the last bullet in my revolver before collapsing next to Mattie Ross and Rooster Cogburn on a sage-choked expanse of dark ground. The snow fell like a gentle benediction.[Chapter 11] Chapter Eleven: In Which There is Surgery and the Marshal Takes His Leave \"Huh. She will have to lose this arm.\" The doctor was a primitive one. A bear skin hung prominently over the side of one of two beds in the cabin where the Marshal had led us. \"Will it save her life?\" Cogburn asked. I had no question to offer; in my experience, physicians were ornery and would do things their way, following any treatment with a healthy draught of alcohol to dull the pain. \"It will. If it does not, I will give you my bear skin,\" the fellow said. Cogburn's lips twisted in a wry manner, but he seemed satisfied with this assurance. Though his white beard did not look particularly appealing, I felt that he was our last hope for Mattie's life and so did not complain as he hefted her himself to lay her out on the plank table. Who knew when it had been properly cleaned? \"You. Hold her shoulders,\" he directed to me. \"You,\" he went on with a thick finger pointed at Cogburn, \"hold her legs. I do not have ether.\" Fortunately, Mattie Ross was so far gone in consciousness that she was unable to protest our manhandling of her. My own exhaustion was pervasive, but I did my part and held her shoulders to the table. Marshal Cogburn leaned on her legs – nothing having been broken, but only bruised, the doctor had ascertained. After we were prepared to do our parts, the mountain of a man Cogburn insisted was a physician used large shears to cut away the upper left part of Mattie's coat and the man's shirt she wore. It had belonged to her father. I felt nauseous as I saw the black lines of poison moving up her arm. The doctor indicated an invisible line between her elbow and shoulder with another pointing of his finger. \"I will cut right there. I have a bone-saw. Used it in the War of Northern Aggression,\" he assured me. This told me he had been a Southern Sympathizer, but if he could save Mattie's life, I would not hold it against him. I had never considered myself a squeamish man. As a cavalry officer and a Texas Ranger, I prided myself on my tough skin and the ability to face any danger with a clear eye and level head. I had seen faces blown off by gunpowder accidents. I had seen men killed in all manner of horrible ways, including disembowelment. I had seen my own body torn and wounded. None of these affected me as much as the sight of a gruff, unlikely surgeon making quick work of removing the arm from an innocent young woman. Mattie did not, thank Providence, awaken during the procedure. Her body tensed, but she did not open her eyes as the saw cut through the comparatively thin bone of her arm. Blood gushed forth as the limb fell away, but the doctor was prepared for that, having had a poker in the fire to cauterize the wound. The stench of burnt flesh was enough to bring bile from my empty stomach to my throat. I met the Marshal's eye and winced at the pain I saw there. The range-smelling surgeon cleaned his hands and slopped water and some kind of sharp-smelling something over the blood-washed table. Maybe it was carbolic acid. He checked Mattie's pulse at her neck, put a cool poultice on her forehead and then washed his hands. \"Who is hungry?\" == I did not much care for U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, but he proved not to be entirely reprobate. After the physician had seen to Mattie Ross, Cogburn insisted I be examined and stitched up as well. What is more, he left hard cash to pay for services, as well as a bottle of his \"best liquor.\" The furry physician did not seem to know if the whiskey was meant for me or for Mattie, but that did not seem to matter. He drank it all himself. I dozed, sure that Mattie and I were safe. It was not until I had truly awakened that I discovered Cogburn's sloppy note to me. He wrote one to \"Little Sister\" too, but I forbore from prying into her affairs. \"Le Beef,\" he began, misspelling my name immediately. \"I am leaving you and Little Sis in good hands, here. You will be all right, I am sure. Get her home. I know you know where she lives, for you met her mother. Take good care of her. I would not refuse to ride with you again. - Reuben Cogburn, U.S. Marshal.\" == \"I remember shooting him. Do I get a share in the reward?\" Mattie asked me soon after she, too, became functionally coherent. She was resting, half-propped up on a bag of flour under a pillow, her left arm covered in boiled-in-acid linen. No blood had seeped through recently. Her hair was still in braids, albeit they were a sight. I did not tell her so. \"I can probably work that out, yes,\" I said to her. \"But I might have to make your name Matt Ross on my report,\" I teased. Her eyes widened, then narrowed. \"Matt? Why?\" Her lip curled in derision. \"Do you not wish to report that a female brought him down while you did not?\" That did tweak my pride, I admit, but that was not my true reason and I told her so. \"Miss Ross,\" I said, leaning forward on the stool the doctor had provided before he went out to collect firewood, \"you have been in my company without benefit of chaperon. This could compromise you.\" \"And you,\" she snapped shrewdly. \"And me,\" I allowed with a nod before raking my hand through my hair. I needed it to be cut and washed. A good shave would not have hurt, either. \"So if I publicly acknowledge your role in this manhunt, I should probably make you sound like a boy.\" At the firm lift of straight brows, I amended that to, \"A man.\" Pressing her lips together, she acknowledged the wisdom of this. \"All right.\" I saw when her face went pale that she was experiencing another bout of extreme discomfort with her wound. Peppery as her temper was, I did not refer to it, but merely asked if there was something she saw about the cabin that would serve to entertain her while we waited for the woodsman-physician's return. \"A mirror,\" she said softly. \"I want one. I – I feel...\" Her right hand plucked absently at the blanket under which she rested before her fingers edged toward her absent left hand. My heart twisted in my chest. \"I want to see myself.\" I took her hand in mine. \"I don't think he has one.\" \"Oh.\" \"You do look a fright,\" I told her with a smile. \"You might want to put your hair back in its usual order.\" Her chin fired up and she glared at me – which was what I was hoping for, to be honest. \"I will. My brush is in my pack.\" I knew that and I got it for her, prepared to be of use to her as I had once been to my own sister Caroline, before – before she died. \"I think I can –\" \"No!\" she snapped. \"Give me my brush. I will do it!\"[Chapter 12] Chapter Twelve: In Which LaBoeuf Plaits Hair I was summarily dismissed from Mattie's presence the first time she tried to braid her hair. Part of me was angry, part of me understood entirely why she had to do that. She had pride too, at least as fierce as my own. When I came back in from seeing to my own personal business outside, I saw that Miss Ross was back, every hair brushed and braided, her skin freshly washed, and her eyes narrowed as she contemplated a book in her right hand. She ignored me, for the most part, and I did my best to do likewise, knowing that she was prickly under the best of circumstances. But, when it came time for dinner, it was then my turn to feed her. I insisted. \"I can learn to do it myself,\" she protested, pushing weakly at my arm. \"I have to,\" she added with a quiet desperation I was not sure she wanted me to hear. \"I am not denying that you do,\" I said, knowing her temper well by now and not wanting to aggravate her. \"But it is right that I help you since you helped me.\" I lifted one brow at her – a trick my father had taught me before he was killed in the War – and waited while she made an amusing face at me. Then I said, \"Remember, I was not always happy about it, either, but it did help. You helped.\" She sighed, glared balefully at her truncated arm, and leveled me a wicked look. \"Fine. I am hungry and I will learn how to do it myself tomorrow.\" I had my doubts as to the quickness of this learning experience, but said nothing of them. Instead, the doctor and I discussed the life of a solitary man and how it felt to be sociable on the rare occasions that it occurred. As Mattie was still in a brown study when conversation died down, I betook myself out of doors into the snow-flecked air to see if I could possibly spy the horses we had had to leave behind on our desperate ride to get help. If the horses did not find us with their plain good sense, I imagined Mattie and I would find it difficult to get back to civilization, never mind getting her home as I had promised Cogburn as well as myself. When I returned to the cabin as darkness tinted the sky, I kicked the snow off my boots and slapped it from the placid flanks of my Appaloosa. She had found me, good mare, but Little Blackie was nowhere to be seen. I hesitated before the rough-hewn door to the cabin, wondering how to break the news to Mattie. Stalling, I led my mount away from the door and poked around to find a bucket for water to water the horse. That being done, I took a breath and went inside. The doctor unfolded himself from the smallish stool by his hearth. His pale eyes narrowed as he studied me. \"I stitched you up yesterday. You should not pull at my handiwork today.\" \"I am fine,\" I said with a small wave toward my shoulder. \"My speech is clearer and –\" \"Good, good,\" he said, sidling past me and scooping up his heavy bear skin cloak from a peg near the door. \"I will be back shortly. There is food in the pot if you are hungry.\" He strode out of the place as if he had serious, pressing business and I suppressed my smile. Turning to Mattie, who was still convalescing, I rolled up on my booted toes, hearing my spurs clink as I came back down. \"Hello, Miss Ross.\" She had a book with anatomical drawings open on her lap. I pursed my lips but figured that she needed something with which to occupy herself and a mind like hers would not be satisfied with normative fare. Medical texts would suit her. She ran her lone hand absently over a diagram of intestines. \"Good evening , Mr. LaBoeuf.\" Her knitted brows told me she was miffed beyond coping with her amputation. Evening , she had said. And then, I understood that she had missed me and once again kept back my smile. Instead, I doffed my hat and set it next to me as I sat on the stool next to her bed. \"Yes'm. Good evening . Can I get you anything?\" It occurred to me that she herself might need to eat or drink or – take care of other business with which I would rather not assist. She grimaced and puffed exasperated sounds out between her lips. \"I could not make my braids properly.\" I nodded. \"I see that.\" She had clearly tried while I was out, and I would not have said anything about the results, since I knew better than to do so. \"They look fine for a first attempt. I imagine it is nearly impossible to do that at all, considering you have no mirror and – and don't have practice working with your right hand alone.\" I tried to be matter-of-fact about it – Mattie Ross was not a sentimental female. She would not want my pity. But, in truth, I did pity her. I felt partly responsible for her condition, though she would have scoffed to hear me say so. I saw the defeated slump of her shoulders, the linen-swathed stump of her left arm, the lack of flame in her sharp brown eyes and my gut kind of turned. It felt like I was in the presence of something almost unnatural: Mattie Ross out of sorts. She finally met my eyes and I saw a plea in them, silent and fractured, but there. A lump formed in my throat. My heart sped briefly and I realized that here, things would change for her. I did not make her say it, though. I merely held my hand out, with an undemanding palm facing upward. Schooling my expression against the tenderness that had suddenly enveloped me out of seemingly nowhere, I merely waited. Like a horse – Cogburn would have been amused at the comparison, but Mattie would not so I refrained from saying it out loud – she blew air out her nose and tossed her head. Then, compressing her lips to a thin line, she slid her hand to her hairbrush – a wooden handled one with stiff bristles – before rapidly all but tossing it to me. \"Do not say I told you so ,\" she snapped. And then, she added, \"You better comb your own, too. It looks no better than mine.\" Finally, I had to laugh. \"Miss Ross, I will be happy to oblige you.\" I untied the cords that kept her braids tight. She gave me a sidelong glare. \"Are you sure you know what you're doing?\" \"I used to help my sister with her hair when she was a little girl. I have done this before.\" \"You have a sister?\" Mattie asked, her back stiff as I untangled the mess of her hair. I paused, brushing carefully through the brown locks of Mattie's hair. It was very long and had waves in it created by her braids, no doubt. I held each section of it in my hand in turn, brushing it straight as I could and making sure no knots would trouble either of us as I plaited it later. \"I did , Miss Ross.\" I heard her take in a swift, loud breath before she reached back around and caught at my sleeve with her hand. \"Mattie. You can – you can call me Mattie.\" Something tight within my chest loosened just a bit as I covered her hand with mine and smiled at the top of her head. \"Thank you, Mattie. I'm William.\" \"I remember.\" When she let go of me, after a quiet moment, she inhaled again – deeply enough that her shoulders rose and fell. \"Can you talk about her?\" \"Who?\" \"Your sister?\" I swallowed and parted Mattie's hair in a straight line as she customarily wore it, laying one section neatly over her shoulder so that it fell in front of her while I took charge of the other section. My memory saw bright gold hair between my fingers. \"Her name was Caroline,\" I said at length. \"She was fifteen years old when she died. She and her fiancé were killed by outlaws.\" The memory of her battered body would never, ever leave me. I did not share with Mattie the gruesome details, but I sensed that she comprehended the violence I kept to myself. When I finished braiding her hair, she murmured, \"Thank you, William.\" The cold, still-mourning place inside myself warmed a little as she used my name. And then still more when she brought one of her braids around so she could examine it – for examine it she did. \"You did very well,\" she told me. And she smiled. Just a little, but it was enough. A/N: Thanks to everyone who is joining me by adding this to your alerts and favorites! :)[Chapter 13] Chapter Thirteen: In Which LaBoeuf and Miss Ross Get Home We stayed with the woodsman-physician for a fortnight. In that time, having no funds of my own, I paid him back for his time, trouble and provender by working around his cabin. I chopped firewood as the snows fell more thickly from the sky. I sealed holes in the walls and roof and hunted for him as well. Not to be outdone, though she was lacking the convenience of two hands, Mattie directed and assisted in the preparation of flatbread and soups that could be frozen and reheated. She also did her best (with a borrowed hand from me) to mend the doctor's clothes and darn his socks. He had three pair. It was a trial. \"Thank you so much, Doctor,\" Mattie said as we prepared to leave. We had only my Appaloosa to ride upon – Mattie had to name my horse River \"Because she never stopped running\" – so it would take a bit of time to return to Yell County, Arkansas. \"Thank you for everything you have done for us. I pray that your kindness is returned to you tenfold.\" The doctor hemmed and hawed. \"I have been glad of the company, but it will be good to have the house to myself again, as well. I have people who want expectorant to see.\" Mattie grinned. \"I am sure you do.\" I shook the man's paw-like hand. \"Thank you, sir. I do not know what we would have done without you.\" \"She would have died,\" he said casually. \"And you might have, as well.\" I nodded; he was likely correct. \"Well, thank you.\" \"Remember to stay warm,\" he advised us as I adjusted my usual pack on my mount's – River's – back. \"Keep your teeth clean and get out of the snow quickly if there is a sudden storm.\" We promised to heed his directions and then, Mattie and I cantered off. == \"Mattie? Are you all right?\" My voice carried sharply in the morning cold. She insisted, naturally enough, on privacy every morning. Her lighter voice reached me with perfect clarity from the middle of a cluster of evergreens. As we moved north, the weather grew a bit colder and the snows were more frequent. \"Yes, William, I am perfectly well.\" It took her a long time in the mornings, which was frustrating. Once mounted, she and I did well together. She was a slender girl, and she still wore her father's trousers. She also wore my spare shirt. To keep warm, the the doctor had produced for her a coat he had \"inherited from an unfortunate patient.\" We had beat the vermin out of it together while the doctor was taking a short trip. We rode during the days in a manner both awkward and natural, Mattie and I. Due to her amputation, she rode in front of me so I could help her with her balance. Sitting astride, her legs were sore every day, but she did not complain. Neither did I – though I confess the awkwardness for me was two-fold. I had never ridden with a female pressed against me before and sometimes, it took a great deal of concentration to keep my mind on the trail. Mattie Ross was innocent of a great many things, I would have wagered, and I wanted to keep it that way. Sometimes, when she grumped and grew angry, I remembered her mostly as the girl-child she had seemed to me in the earliest days of our association. Stubborn to a fault, willful, annoying. At such times, it was easiest for me to see myself as her protector and friend as we moved slowly toward her home. At other times, though, I would catch a dried track of tears that that had made its way through the light dusting of travel-dust on her face and my heart would clench. And she would – sometimes easily, sometimes with visible reluctance – wrap her one good arm around me as I helped her dismount at different times during the day. A few times, she had needed to lean against me before she could stand fully on her own. I understood that her body was tired and gravely wounded. There was no shame in needing a little help. It was at these times that I saw her as the young woman she was and I thought of anything and everything to be an honorable Texas Ranger. \"You are the bravest person I think I know,\" I told her once, when tears wet her lashes. She sniffled and turned her face sharply from me. \"You clearly do not know people of quality. You should meet some.\" \"I think I have.\" Slowly, her posture relaxed and she met my eyes again. \"I think I have, too.\" == \"We are here. Wait,\" Mattie insisted, reaching back to slap my thigh. \"Wait.\" I heard her breathe harshly in and out as I leaned my head forward over her shoulder. We stared at the weathered farmhouse ahead of us, with its widely spaced wooden fence and the deep porch that fronted it. I remembered the house, of course. It had been perhaps a month since I had last seen it, or thereabouts. \"Are you all right?\" I asked her, unconsciously wrapping one arm around her waist to make sure she didn't lose her balance and fall. She nodded quickly. Against my arm, her heart pounded with a fierce beat. \"I just – they do not know, William. They do not know and they will stare at me and –\" \"They are your family, Mattie. They love you,\" I said quietly. \"You cannot hide because of your injury.\" \"I can barely eat without spilling half of everything. You know this!\" she snapped, turning her head suddenly to meet my eyes. Our noses touched and my mouth went dry suddenly. I sat up. I had to get off the horse – River – in a quick dismount. \"You stay there,\" I said, willing my body to relaxation as I reached for my mare's reins. \"I will walk you in. Give you another minute or two to adjust.\" \"Yes. Thank you.\" Just after I settled I started to walk, she called, \"William? Will you give me an address where I can write to you?\" I halted and turned to practically stare at her. \"I beg your pardon? Can it be that Miss Ross wants to keep in touch with a Rodeo Clown like me?\" I teased. Even at the distance of half a horse-length, I could see the blush in her face. \"It could be that Mattie would like to keep in touch with her friend William ,\" she retorted after a moment. \"That would be proper, would it not?\" \"I do believe I would like that. To know how you get on and such,\" I said, continuing up to the house. \"I will leave you my mother's address,\" I told her. \"That would be nice. Thank you.\" And then, we were seen by Mattie's mother and, between her initial joy at seeing her daughter, and the horror and fear and female tears that followed, Mattie was established once again in the bosom of her family. After spending a few days with the Ross family – to rest River as much as to be of use to Mattie and her mother and siblings – I left Yell County to return to my own place in Texas. It was a long, lonely ride. I could not remember ever being so lonely on the trail, before.[Chapter 14] Chapter Fourteen: In Which the Ranger and the Young Woman Correspond Select correspondence from 1883 - 1885 December 20, 1883[*] Dear Mr. LaBoeuf, I hope this letter finds you well. I know you will excuse the sloppy handwriting, but I am still learning and I refuse to allow another to pen my words while I am capable of doing so myself. I am well. We are determined to celebrate Christmas this year, even without my father. The little ones expect it and Mama and I will do our best. I think of you often as I try to braid my hair. I will tell you, here on paper and not to your face, that I have not yet managed to get such a straight part myself as you did. Please give my best regards to your mother. Sincerely, Mattie Ross January 24, 1884 Dear Mattie, I thought we had agreed on Christian names? My mother sends her surprised greetings. Now that you have got her thinking about my keeping company with females, prepare for unusual mail to come by post in the future. Enclosed, you'll find a gift from the State of Texas. I hope it comes in handy. Happy New Year, Mattie. Sincerely, William [Enclosed was a bank draft for fifty dollars. ] May 20, 1884 Dear William, I hope you are being safe out there and \"keeping your teeth clean\" as our friend the physician directed. You and the other Texas Rangers are in my prayers as you seek to find your latest quarry. I am sending you a copy of the New Testament for you to keep in your saddle bag, should you so wish. It is less bulky than the entire Bible. I hope your mother does not think me too forward. My mother is doing very well, and she thanks you for asking. Little Frank is wanting spurs of his own so he can walk like you. I think he is foolish, but there you have it. My sister Victoria is running around as you predicted she would. Her hair is a pretty golden color in the sunshine, but she does not remember our father at all. We have planted for the autumn harvest. You know you are welcome if you are out this way. And if you see Marshal Rooster Cogburn, do tell him I said Hello. Sincerely, Mattie November 1, 1884 Dear Mattie, I am sorry to have missed your harvest and sorry, too, that you sent three letters to me without getting an answer. I have been thoroughly castigated on that score already, let me assure you. I have not been back here in quite some time, having been in pursuit of one George Tobler. I do not know if you have heard of him, but he was ranging in the Choctaw Nation. It took us months, but we have found him and brought him in. He is awaiting trial right now. I considered giving him the copy of the New Testament you sent to me, but you inscribed it for me and I did not wish to give that away. As my friend, I beg you will indulge me and let me tell you that it was a hard ride, chasing Tobler. You will not be surprised that River survived without a scratch, but I myself have a new scar to show you when we meet again. I am hoping to ride out that way in the Spring, Mattie. I have something for you from my mother. I can see your expression now, but try to smile when I bring it, all right? It is only a book. You might even like it. I will try to be a better correspondent in the near future, so please keep writing. I enjoy hearing from you. Your friend, William February 14, 1885 Dear William, Your mother's note included with your January letter made me laugh, so I am writing on Saint Valentine's Day. I will not pretend not to understand her hints, but really, you and I have not set eyes on each other for more than a year. My mother is entirely pleased when there is a letter from you, but she has not hinted at anything. After all, I am unsociable and have only one arm. It is to be expected I will be the spinster daughter. Providence is not to be argued with, in my readings. Frankly, I am feeling a bit useless. We have had to hire a man on to help since Christmas, because I am not fit to do much of what needs doing and Little Frank is not yet grown enough to take on an adult's responsibilities. I am considering moving into town and finding work as a bookkeeper. Chaney – Do you think it would be wrong, William, to be a bookkeeper? Chaney called me \"the little bookkeeper,\" you know. Because I kept my father's books. I still do the books, here on the farm. I could do them in town. Before I start sounding morose, I will end this letter. Your friend, Mattie March 1, 1885 Dear Mattie, I will dispense with the formalities at once and remind you, Miss Ross, that you have earned your spurs. You are fit to do anything you set your mind on doing. If you want to be a bookkeeper, by all means do so. I could find you a place here in Texas that would suit you, if you wished. And on that other point... Forgive the impertinent Rodeo Clown, but are you entertaining suitors at your age? I forget sometimes that you are a young lady. Do you put up your hair? Caroline did when she became betrothed, and she was fifteen. Do not despair, my friend. You are far too young to consider yourself a spinster. Look at me. I am a bachelor yet at the age of thirty-one! I hope to be up your way in the springtime. I will let you know the particulars when I get back from the next manhunt. Your friend, William July 11, 1885 Ranger Wm. LaBoeuf Care of the Texas Rangers, Amarillo, Texas William, I am worried, now. I have not heard from you for months, and you did not come to visit in the spring. It is now full summer and still you are silent. You went on a manhunt you said. I read just last week that George Tobler had escaped and was being pursued by the Texas Rangers. It would be just like you to go off after him and not tell me. I am writing to your mother. She is anxious to hear from you, as am I. Please, send word or a telegram or something to let us know how you are. Sincerely, Mattie Ross The Western Union Telegraph Company Received at Fort Smith, Arkansas | | July 18, 1885 To: Miss Mattie Ross Ranger LaBoeuf has been shot. He is alive, but cannot write. He sends apologies and will write soon. Your servant, Col. T.D. Ransom Amarillo, TX September 1, 1885 My dear Mattie, Thank you for worrying so about this Rodeo Clown. My fellow Rangers in the Troop find this all very amusing. We have had little to smile over, so this is not a bad thing. Next time this happens, I will find a way – any way – to notify you. I have had a fever and am now being nursed by my mother. She encloses a letter, I believe. Please let me know how the hired man turned out and how your family is. I know harvest time is busy. I will see you soon. William [*] Date based upon the Coen Bros' script, typed in June, 2009.[Chapter 15] A/N: I just had to thank you all for reading. No, not done yet, but I get so tickled when I see someone has put this story on alert of favorited it. And I go absolutely silly over reviews. Seriously. :) Thank you so much! And now, there is a reunion. :) Chapter Fifteen: In Which the Ranger Finds Trouble \"And take these too, Will,\" my mother instructed, handing me up a mysterious parcel wrapped in a fine cloth. \"She is my friend too, after all this time, and I want to send her a birthday present. You told me the book was ruined?\" With a wry grin and, yes, flushed cheeks, I accepted the package. \"Yes, it was, Ma. I will make sure this makes it all the way to Yell County, however.\" She patted my knee and eyed me carefully. Concern and worry shone in her pale blue eyes. She had gone more gray, she said, since I had been injured earlier that year. I was just thankful enough that my shoulder could be repaired. I was able to ride and shoot and that was all I could hope for. \"You see that it does. There is something in there for her mother, too.\" \"All right!\" I laughed and clucked my tongue so that River – my faithful mare – started away from the house I shared with my mother. \"Thanks, Ma!\" The smile stayed on my face as I rode away from my house. My heart beat fast, truth to tell. I looked forward to seeing Mattie Ross again. Her last letter, admittedly, had not said much about farm affairs, but her relief to hear from me had been clear in her caustic prose. No one could make me smile and wince in quite the same way as Mattie. She had just turned seventeen, according to my recollection. I had more than my mother's gifts for her. I had a gift from myself, as well. == The sun was setting low in the sky when I reached the Ross farm. No light accented any window, however. I urged River to step around the property, all the while with the butt of my revolver wedged up against my hand. Just in case something was afoot, here. I had not survived George Tobler by being complacent. The outbuildings were all quiet and apparently deserted. A quick look, however, showed me that crops had been gathered and stored. I was not a farmer so could not say how well all had been handled, but if my Mattie had anything to say about it, I was sure all was in perfect order. As the last rays of the sun touched the sloping roof of the farmhouse, I knocked on the front door. After waiting and knocking a few times, I tried the door to call inside – because I did not want to ride away if someone was there. The door was locked, however. \"Well, River,\" I muttered as I returned to my trusty Appaloosa, \"I suppose we can wait here on the porch or ride into the nearest town and get a room for the night.\" Not wanting to be shot as a trespasser, I felt I shouldn't camp out on the porch, after some thought. I wasn't as quick as I used to be – though my former speed and accuracy were returning with practice. That fever left me considerably debilitated. I was disappointed as I rode away. I had looked forward to seeing Mattie – and not seeing her after all the tension of the past hours and and days and weeks and, yes, even years, piled up on me all at once. It was exhausting. Still, a good night's rest in Dardanelle would not go amiss and I set my mind to that. It was less than an hour's ride to reach the town, and I was gratified to see that the streets had not been \"rolled up\" with the sunlight. Instead, there was a collection of horses and buggies and even a carriage gathered haphazardly around the largest of he buildings on the main street. Curious, I went to investigate. It seemed I had arrived just in time for a social. A smile pulled at my whole face, but part of me was unhappy as well. If I had known – perhaps I could have pushed to arrive the day before and asked Mattie to attend with me. We could have danced – I had never thought of that before. I draped River's lead loosely over the railing at the end of the porch, dusted myself off, and decided to take a look to see what was going on. The only name on the building was Dardanelle Hall and I supposed the locals used it for all sorts of gatherings, from church services to trials to auctions. And, apparently, dancing. The music was lively and I grinned to see the unexpectedly colorful gowns the ladies wore as they swirled and hopped with their partners. Circles and squares and all manner of forms were undertaken while I observed. My throat was dry, though, and I thought to see if there was anything wet about. The crowd was heavy at the front door, so I stepped around back and heard some more raucous sounds and the distinctive clinking of tin cups. I had found the watering hole. I pulled a few coins from an inner pocket on my coat and was just about to reach the inebriated tenders of a few kegs and bottles when I heard a voice that was familiar in its sharpness, if not in its actual tone. \"You will unhand me this moment, sir, or I will scream. And then I will tell your mother.\" Mattie Ross! I did not even remember being thirsty as I shoved my coins back where I had kept them. Instead, I strode, my feet coming down heavily on the boardwalk and then the packed earth. My spurs jingled and, to me, the sound was menacing as I followed the sound of the male voice sparring with Mattie's. \"Aw, come on, Miss Mattie! You are not a bad-looking woman, you know, and right smart, too. I can teach you things you have not yet learned, right?\" \"Mr. Colgate. I will not be spoken to in this manner – I may only have the one hand, but I assure you it is not – oh!\" The final syllable out of her mouth was pained and it had me running behind the next building and around the corner. How in blazes had Mattie allowed herself to be separated so far from the rest of the dancers? \"Let me – ow!\" The scene before me had me acting before I thought. A man of my height had twisted Mattie's arm behind her and was apparently trying to slobber on her, his free hand moving where it had no business being. Mattie was struggling, but her assailant was stronger by far than she. In two steps, I had reached them and had my hand around the man's throat, pulling him back. He swore, and it was no kind of language to use in front of a lady. I backhanded him as soon as he let go of Mattie. \"William!\" \"Mattie. Just a moment.\" \"Hey! Who are you?\" the fellow said. \"William. LaBoeuf. Texas. Ranger.\" Each word was punctuated soundly with a fist to his face. \"When a lady says to let her go, I advise you to comply,\" I concluded, with a final fist into his soft belly. He collapsed, falling over himself, spitting. I hoped I had loosened a few teeth for him. Shaking my hands out, I turned then to Mattie. It was full dark now, but some illumination from the building where the dance music played cast squares of light on the ground beyond us. \"Mattie,\" I said, my hand out to her. She stood there, her head moving to look first at me, then at the piece of trash on the ground, then back at me. Finally, she took my hand and I allowed myself to do something I had thought of often. I wrapped my arms around her, surprised to feel her trembling next to me. Mattie Ross was not the trembling type. \"Mattie, are you all right?\" I moved my head back and looked closely at her face, given the little light available. She seemed unhurt, but I did not know for certain. \"Please, tell me.\" Her eyes were dark, dark and wide and deep as they looked frankly into mine. \"I am fine, William. I am just very, very surprised.\" She took a deep breath and ducked her head. \"I did not think you would ever come back.\" I was struck almost speechless and could only say her name. \"Mattie...\" \"I thought you had not come before, that perhaps – perhaps your mother's hints had borne fruit elsewhere and I would have thought that to be a very wise thing.\" There was not a word I could say to that. Not one word of the flood of them in my brain could I choose to answer her. So, I did the only thing I knew to do. I slipped my hands from her back to her face, tilted her head, and kissed her.[Chapter 16] Chapter Sixteen: In Which There is Plain Speaking Kissing Mattie Ross was something that had often crossed my mind, indeed, from the first time I laid eyes on her while she was sleeping in that rooming house years ago. In the time since I had left her with her family, during the time we had corresponded, my thoughts had lingered on the notion – more and more often of late. When I was so severely wounded, my first thoughts had been of her. My mother informed me I spoke of Mattie and to Mattie while I floundered in fever. Kissing Mattie Ross was not what I had expected, even so. Her response showed me she had been kissed before, but not often. I felt her lips part under mine, though, and it meant that my attentions were not unwelcome. Relief rushing through me, I broke off the kiss and held her more tightly against me. \"Mattie... How could you imagine that I would not have come back?\" I could feel her hand at my back, her fingers clutching sporadically at my coat, while she breathed heavily. \"William... I do not know, now.\" Then, it was her turn to pull away a little. \"I – I cannot think of what to say.\" That she was flustered and unsure made me feel very protective and tender toward her, I pressed my lips to her forehead and, seeing that Mr. Colgate was nowhere in view, I turned a bit and offered Mattie my arm to escort her back to the festivities not far away. \"Say you will dance with me,\" I suggested. She laughed a little. \"I am not an accomplished dancer.\" She went on to tell me how she, her mother and siblings and the hired man had come to town to attend the dance. \"Ah, the hired man. What is his name?\" \"Harris Austin.\" \"And is he helpful?\" \"He is good with – around the house,\" she said, hesitating between her words. \"I still tend to manage the farm.\" Even though we were now within a circle of lantern light outside of the Hall, I pressed a kiss to the top of her head. \"I knew you were in charge of that. The barn is a pattern-card for order and sense.\" She smiled up at me, clearly pleased that I had noticed. My breath stuck in my throat. \"Mattie,\" I murmured, \"you have grown into a handsome woman.\" Her skin was clear and glowed with color. Her lashes thick and beguiling around those dark, dark eyes. Lips red – perhaps with my kiss – and hair arranged with ringlets around her face, Mattie Ross was indeed a fine-looking woman. \"Truly, I could stare at you all night.\" \"You do not need to sweet-talk me to dance with me, William LaBoeuf.\" Her grimace confused me and I stopped her when she would have walked away. \"What?\" \"I was not sweet-talking you. I was telling you the truth. Mattie – I admire you,\" I whispered, taking her hand in both of mine and tilting her chin up with our combined clasp. \"I have for – for a long time. Do not tell me it is all one-sided,\" I advised with half a smile. I remembered her generous response to my kiss and was encouraged. Her gaze dropped for a moment. \"No, no, but –\" She took a deep breath. \"We should go inside. My little sister, Victoria, will wonder what happened to me.\" I accepted her change of subject, resolving to talk more seriously with her later, more privately perhaps. \"How is Little Frank?\" I asked, tucking Mattie's hand between my arm and body. We stepped up onto the wooden planks that served as a walk around the Hall. Her steps were not light, but firm. They suited her, as did the rich sable color of her gown. \"It is so odd,\" she said, lingering near the door once we were inside the noisy gaiety of the Hall, \"speaking with you again.\" I grinned and bent a little to place my words nearer to her ear. \"It is different, but I confess to preferring hearing your voice, Mattie, than reading your writing.\" She scowled at me as she turned to look me in the eye. \"I will have you know, William, that your writing is no treat to decipher, either!\" I dared to put my arm around her, here in public while we waited for the music to pause so we could find her family. The pleasure it gave me to do so – the happiness I felt because she allowed it – warmed me inside and out. \"You did not complain once, not in almost two years.\" She sniffed and made a show of moving as if to get away from me, when what she actually did was maneuver herself directly in front of me. I did not complain. Instead, I briefly rested my chin upon her head as she said, \"No. For I did enjoy hearing from you, Rodeo Clown or not.\" I laughed and so did she – I could feel her move against my chest. \"Well I certainly did appreciate hearing from you, too. So did my mother. She sent me a package for you.\" Mattie stiffened and turned slightly to look up at me. \"Whatever for?\" \"I believe for your birthday.\" \"Oh. Well, well, that was very kind of her. Oh!\" She turned completely around as the music concluded. \"I forgot to ask. Where are you staying? You said you saw our barns?\" I felt my face redden a bit. \"I did go to your farm first, Mattie. But no one was there, so I rode River into town to see if I could get a room here. I thought to try to track you down tomorrow.\" Disappointment was clear in her expression, so I smiled just a little and asked, \"Might I head back tonight with you, instead?\" \"Yes! I mean, I will have to ask my mother,\" she amended, her own cheeks pinking up in the bright lights of the Hall. I immediately tried to find Mrs. Ross. I saw her, walking with a man that had a vague familiarity to me, while holding the hand of a little girl – it must have been Victoria. I did not see Mattie's brother, but he was of an age that running about with his friends was more acceptable than staying tied to apron strings. I removed my hat and tried to smooth my recently-shorn hair with one hand. Mattie watched me, eyes dancing. Then, she grew concerned. \"I see that scar there, near your temple.\" She reached up without hesitation to trace the white line near my hair. \"And you were shot, you said. Where? Can you show me?\" Concern crinkled her brow as she added, \"It must have been so frightening. Your mother said the fever was severe.\" \"It was and – and I really cannot show you that particular scar. It would require a degree of disrobing that would hardly be appropriate here.\" I winked, being flirtatious, but I did not think she would object. Instead her brows flew up into her forehead before she turned abruptly. I saw the red color along her jaw as she did so, just as she murmured, \"I see. No doubt you are correct.\" \"No doubt.\" Our private conversation was over as Mrs. Ross reached us at last. \"Mattie! Why aren't you dancing with that nice Mr. Colgate?\" she inquired with an arching of her eyebrow. \"And Ranger LaBoeuf! What a surprise to see you. Mattie had given up, you know, on you ever coming.\" I stepped out from behind Mattie and took Mrs. Ross's hand. \"Evening, Mrs. Ross. I came as soon as I honorably could.\" Mattie cleared her throat. \"And this is Harris Austin, the hired hand I wrote you about.\" Austin's eyes narrowed as I eyed him. \"Evening, Ranger,\" he muttered. Looking uncomfortable, he scratched a bit at his jawline. \"I have heard a good deal about you.\" I did not know what it was about this fellow that unsettled me. Perhaps it was the way he seemed to keep an eye on the door. Perhaps it was his restless movements. Or perhaps it was the way his eyes would light on Mrs. Ross in what I deemed to be an inappropriate manner. I hoped to have the chance to find out, but we were interrupted. \"Mattie? Mattie Ross? And look there, it is LaBoeuf!\" Mattie's eyes got round. \"Look! It is the Marshal! Rooster Cogburn!\" A/N: Oh no! What am I doing, now? Don't worry. I shan't delay things too long. ;-) I am so glad y'all are enjoying this. Thanks so much to everyone who reviews!

Please know I do read and appreciate your comments, too! :)[Chapter 17] Chapter Seventeen: In Which the Three Ride Again \"Well, hello there, Sister,\" Cogburn said, strolling up in a slightly inebriated manner. The patch over his missing eye was new leather, now, and his hair had more gray than previously. Otherwise, he was clean-shaven and smiling. A smiling Rooster Cogburn was rather an unsettling sight. \"Marshal Cogburn,\" Mattie said, her hand extended to him. \"What a surprise to see you, here!\" The hired hand ducked his head and looked as if he would slink away, but Mattie began her introductions. \"Mother, this is U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, of whom I told you. Marshal, this is my mother, Mrs. Ross, and my little sister, Victoria, and this is –\" In between one word and the next, the hired man panicked and started to run through the crowd of laughing, chattering townsfolk. \"Mr. Austin!\" Mrs. Ross cried out. \"Austin? Harris Austin?\" Cogburn asked, his sloppy demeanor transformed into one of sharp interest. \"Why, yes, Marshal.\" His one eye flashed. \"Well, Ranger, what are you doing at a dance when a wanted man is ripe for capture? Come on!\" I stared after him as he followed Austin's trail out the Hall's wide doors, my jaw hanging open just as widely, I was sure. Mattie closed my mouth for me with the pressure of her fingers, seemingly heedless of her mother's presence or the buzz of questions that was moving throughout the Hall. \"William.\" \"What?\" Did I follow? Was I safe enough to do so? I was taking a \"leave of absence\" from the Troop until my shooting was back on target. I had not yet had the opportunity to talk to Mattie about everything, and part of me really did not want to chase another villain for days or weeks on end. Fingertips brushed my jaw. \"William?\" I blinked and directed my full attention to her. \"Sorry, Mattie.\" I could not decipher the emotion in her eyes. \"Our hired man was an outlaw?\" Slowly, I shook my head. \"It would appear so.\" \"Well, then, I have a bone to pick with him. I will ride with you. Mama? We will be back soon.\" \"Wait just a minute there, Miss Ross,\" I said, even as she boldly took my hand and started walking toward the door. \"Just hold on there, pardner.\" Her grin was infectious as she looked up at me. \"It has been awhile since I have heard that term. What is there to wait for? I am coming with you, of course.\" \"Sweetheart,\" I said, the endearment falling naturally from my tongue without forethought or any consideration of consequences, \"I am not prepared to ride. I do not have supplies, nor do you.\" She stopped in the darkness, away from the milling people who were still talking over the precipitous departure of a local man and the notorious Rooster Cogburn. \"What did you say?\" she asked, her hand still in mine. I did not know if that was conscious on her part or not. \"I do not have supplies for a trail ride.\" \"Before that.\" My skin reddened, but in the dark she would not know that. \"Mattie, I did not mean to take liberties,\" I began. She laughed a little but squeezed my hand in hers. \"Liberties? Like kissing me without my permission? Like holding me in public? Those kinds of liberties, Ranger?\" In spite of her words, I knew she was teasing me by the flash of her smile. \"Liberties like calling you sweetheart when I have not yet asked for permission to court you.\" \"Oh.\" \"And I cannot, just now.\" \"Cannot what?\" Stubborn girl, she refused to move when I tried to make my way to River. \"Cannot ask permission or cannot ride or cannot court, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Chuckling at her tenacity, I pulled her along to River's flank. \"Be careful, or I will be very interested in taking liberties again,\" I warned her. She lifted her hand to my face and I almost expected her to slap me. I almost felt I deserved to be slapped, but for the tone in her voice when she said, \"Take me with you.\" A quick look around showed me there were no curious eyes, so I held her hand to my cheek and wrapped my other arm around her again. She felt just perfect. Not asking for advance permission had worked well before, so I did so again, lowering my head and taking her lips with mine, in a most thorough manner. When I had to drag air into my body, I let her go, held her chin in my fingers for a moment, and mounted River without saying a word. \"Wait! Wait for me!\" She held fast to my trouser leg. \"William! Harris Austin seduced my mother,\" she whispered harshly. \"I did not say so before, but it is so. I must have my share of the hunt.\" I stared at her, slack-jawed yet again that evening. Words poured forth in my head, but I stopped them at my mouth, for they were not fit to be heard by a lady. At last, I could only extend my hand to her and wince as she swung herself up into the saddle in front of me, her knee hooked around the pommel as she sat side-saddle. It was crowded, she was swathed in petticoats and skirts and whatever necessities a proper lady wore with a dancing gown, but still – My Mattie was riding with me again, my arm around her, and I allowed myself to enjoy it. I knew it would not last long. == I was correct. The ride – frustrating, tempting, enjoyable as it was – was only as long as it took for us to get on the road out of Dardanelle. I had no plan other than to ask any on the road if they had seen Austin – whom Mattie could describe in great detail – and which way he had run. \"LaBoeuf!\" \"Cogburn,\" I called, riding up to stop next to him. Mattie directed an expectant look at me and I sighed a little. \"Mattie is coming with us. She has a claim and she insists.\" \"This is a story I want to hear, but first, we must ride. I have food with me, but you do not, I would guess. I always,\" he added, his spine straightening, \"go prepared.\" \"We are going back to my farm for provisions, Marshal,\" Mattie stated. Cogburn seemed to take us in for the first time, pushing his hat back on his head. \"So,\" he said with a vague gesture that encompassed Mattie and myself, \"are you two properly betrothed now?\" \"Marshal! That is impertinent!\" Mattie snapped. \"I take that to mean you are not,\" Cogburn decided with a laugh. \"Watch out there, LaBoeuf, that she does not haul you in front of a preacher!\" \"I will not be hauling him anywhere. In fact, he will be hauling me. We are riding with you, Marshal. If you know where Austin is heading, we can come with you.\" \"First,\" I said, making sure this whole venture did not go further without my input, \"we need food and bedding.\" \"Right. Thank you. First to the farm.\" And so we rode, the three of us, into the night. Cogburn had apparently grown some sense since we met last, for he did not say one untoward thing the entire ride. A/N: A note on \"bad guys.\" George Tobler and Harris Austin are very much historical inserts. They were in the vicinity during this time period and captured (or killed) either by law or unknown means. I do enjoy research. :D[Chapter 18] Chapter Eighteen: In Which Someone is Shot. Again. Mattie left a note for her mother, telling her the basics: Harris Austin, the man they hired to be a help on the farm, was wanted for murder and that she, Mattie, was riding out with me and Cogburn to bring him to justice. I felt compelled by honor to add: Mrs. Ross, please know that your daughter is safe with me and my intentions are strictly honorable. Your servant, Wm. LaBoeuf, Texas Ranger I did not share that with Mattie, having scribed my addition after she had left the house to lead out her mount from the barn. It was dark and getting later all the time. Cogburn himself was itching to be gone – but he had still taken the time to investigate Austin's room in the farmhouse and to confiscate the fugitive's whiskey. I was unsurprised. The bundle from my own mother I tucked away in a corner of the front room of the house. If Mrs. Ross had the presence of mind to be curious about it, she could indeed open it, but I did not anticipate that happening. I just hoped nothing inauspicious would occur before the gifts could be distributed. With that hope, I retrieved River from the watering trough and waited for Mattie to present herself. \"What did you name this horse?\" I asked Mattie as we set our horses to walking. Cogburn rode ahead of us, his newly acquired whiskey in one hand. Mattie had changed into a man's trousers once again and I wondered whose they were. Perhaps she had borrowed a pair from her brother or had kept her father's trousers for work around the farm. My own mother had found it easier to do heavy work in men's trousers, so I was not alarmed to see Mattie in them again. But Mattie was not my mother and I moved my attention to her horse. \"He was my father's,\" Mattie told me. \"I did not name him. He is called Thistle, because his temper is prickly.\" \"A good match for you, then,\" Cogburn called back to us, letting us know he was entirely aware of us. \"If you two are quite finished conversing, let us hurry. Austin was on foot when he left the town, but I do not believe he would remain thus.\" We started at a brisk canter, Cogburn setting the pace. I kept careful watch on Mattie, but she handled her horse one-handed quite capably. Riding astride, her balance was sufficient and I was relieved on that score. Relieved and very proud of her. She was a remarkable young woman. She was also headstrong and foolish in some respects. \"Look! I see a man walking! There, his silhouette, can you see?\" \"Your sight is sharper than mine, Sister,\" the Marshal drawled. \"LaBoeuf?\" \"I trust her to have clear sight,\" I said, cautious, but believing Mattie saw truly. \"Shall we overtake him?\" \"We are barely off the farm!\" Mattie said, her voice eager. \"Come on!\" And she broke away from us, without even her father's revolver to defend herself. I swore, as did the Marshal, and we lit off after her. \"Mattie!\" Thistle must have been bred from racing stock – granted my Appaloosa was older than she used to be – because Mattie overtook the lone walker up ahead. I expected to hear her demand that he halt to be taken into custody. It would have been like her. Instead, I saw a most incredible and frightening thing. The man leapt at Mattie, pulling her off the horse. \"Mattie Ross! Well how nice of you to join me!\" he said, his voice carrying over the flat ground. \"Not as pretty as your ma, but you will do.\" \"No!\" Fear is a funny thing. It affects people in different ways. I have seen it paralyze a man as often as I have seen it spur him on. That night, seeing my Mattie being manhandled by that worthless man in town made me mad. But seeing Austin – a man she had actually had in her house and around her table – grab her and make like he was going to ride off with her? I felt as if I were possessed by a madman. My heart just about burst from my chest and I kicked River with my spurs, making her squeal in protest. My limbs pulsed with the need to get Mattie safe and to wipe Harris Austin from the face of the earth. He was about ready, it seemed, to hoist himself and Mattie both onto her horse as I reached them. \"Put her down, Austin!\" \"Make me!\" he retorted, one arm around Mattie, pinning her good arm to her side. I caught the glint of steel in that hand. In the other, he held a gun. Pointed at her throat. \"Or you could just let us ride along, now. I'll leave her someplace safe, Ranger. I will. All nice and tied up tight, of course, and gagged because I will not listen to her incessant quoting if Bible verses, but she will be just fine. If you let us go. Now.\" The blood was pounding so hard and fast in my ears, I was not entirely sure I heard his words right. I shook my head, just then catching the sound of Cogburn's horse coming up behind me. If I had any hope of rescuing Mattie, it had to be now. I moved my hand to my Colt revolver while Austin's attention was split between me and Cogburn. I kept one eye on Austin's hand at Mattie's side. If he cut her on her good arm... Mattie took a deep, loud breath. Her eyes were wide, her lips moving silently. I imagined she was praying or reciting some of those incessant verses Austin had spoken of just a moment before. I couldn't read her lips in the darkness, but I wanted to. I wanted something in my memory, just in case this all went straight to Hell. With a click, it did. Cogburn fired his rifle. I knew its sound well. Denial screamed out my throat as I was sure that Cogburn's shot would mean Mattie would likewise be harmed. In the wake of my shout, I heart Mattie shout as well as she did something that made Austin roar in rage and push her to the ground. I took this to be a positive, since the gun was no longer at her throat – it fired at Cogburn instead. With a defiant hiss, U.S. Marshal fell from his horse to the ground, landing without a lot of noise. His horse backed off a little, and Mattie moved more quickly than I would have given her credit for, half-rolling to the Marshal's side, his name pouring from her lips. She grabbed his gun. \"Mattie, no!\" I shouted, leaping from River's back to stand in front of her. For a moment, all was still. Harris Austin, murderer and fugitive, stared at us, as if trying to decide what to do. With a foul word, he spun around and mounted Mattie's horse, kicking it viciously. \"No!\" Mattie and I shouted in the same moment. And, also in the same moment, we took aim and fired. Mattie fell backward, half-landing on Cogburn. \"He is dead, William!\" she cried. I knelt at her side, and felt for his pulse with one hand, while wrapping her up against my side with my free arm. I could only pray that Austin had been injured enough not to try running while I saw to Rooster Cogburn.[Chapter 19] Chapter Nineteen: In Which the Ranger Makes a Choice \"He is not dead, sweetheart,\" I murmured into Mattie's hair, breathing deeply, reassuring myself that she was fine and whole. \"But, he will need a doctor.\" With a bit of reluctance in spite of the circumstances, I released her. \"Look, there is a bullet wound. Let us turn him over to see if there is an exit wound, too.\" We did so, seeing that there was indeed a wide, bleeding hole in Cogburn's back. \"All right. I'll make a bandage and we will roll him over on it. Then we will make another one and you will need to press it down while I make very sure Austin will not bother us further.\" \"All right,\" she said. \"All right. And you take the Marshal's gun too. Just in case.\" Her voice grew more firm with every word and I knew then that my Mattie would be fine. \"Thank you,\" I said, reaching down to pick up the rifle. I checked the load and went to his saddle to find more ammunition. I then did the same with my own weapon. While I did so, Thistle made my worry a bit less by making his way back to Mattie. This meant that Austin could not ride away easily, even if he were merely grazed and not gravely wounded. The horse made those distinctive equine sounds of comfort as he neared Mattie, who was kneeling yet on the ground, her one arm leaning on Cogburn's gunshot wound. I loved that woman. I absolutely did. Seeing her in Austin's power just about undid me. I realized that I could not bear it if something had happened to her. If he had hurt her or, God forbid, killed her – I don't know how I would have made it through another day. I wondered if she had been through anything even remotely similar while I had been injured and unable to write to her. A strange feeling moved through me, under my skin, shaking my insides a bit as I reached Harris Austin's prone body, sprawled on the ground. \"Austin,\" I said, kicking his gun away while training my revolver on him. The rifle, I held in my other hand. \"Hey.\" I kicked him with the toe of my boot once. Then again. There was no response. Making sure he was entirely disarmed, I prodded him with the rifle before setting it aside and kneeling beside him. As I had with Cogburn, I checked Austin for a pulse at his throat. There was none. I pressed my palm on his chest, to see if it rose and fell, but it did not. Finally, I bent my head to listen for a heartbeat. I smelled whiskey, sweat, dirt and leather but I heard absolutely nothing. \"He's dead!\" I called to Mattie. \"Who shot him?\" \"How do I know? It is dark, woman!\" I checked, but saw only one bullet hole in his chest. An exit wound. Not needing to be gentle, I prodded up and down but found only the one wound. Meaning that one of us missed. I could not even say which of us, Mattie or myself, had shot Harris Austin down. == Thistle was none too happy about transporting a wounded man or a dead man, either, so he got the honor of bearing Mattie during the short ride back to the Ross farm. Cogburn's horse bore the Marshal and myself and I did feel sorry for the animal. \"I can do it,\" Mattie had protested. \"Then his poor horse will not be so burdened.\" \"It is a matter of balance,\" I told her. \"I know, Mattie Ross, that you can do just about anything, but Cogburn is a heavy man and keeping him on his horse might require more arm than you can provide.\" Indignation sparked in her expression as she went with me toe to toe. \"I do not appreciate that, William LaBoeuf.\" I saw the dark angling of her brow as she frowned up at me. \"I have been helping run a farm for years –\" \"I know you have. I know you have done a tremendous job. But this is not about anything other than, well, your weight and needing two arms to hold him. And much as you can do to work around what happened to you, Mattie, you do not have two arms.\" It pained me to be direct in this manner. It hurt me to make her feel in any way less, but this was a fact of life and I would not pretend it was not. \"Now, I find you to be a wonderful woman. Smart and capable and a good pard, all the way around. If Cogburn were more your size, there would be no problem. But he is not.\" Her temper lessened; I could see in the way her shoulders relaxed as I spoke again. \"We have to hurry. He needs to be stitched up. Can you do it?\" \"Me?\" \"You.\" She turned to look at Cogburn, who was now moaning a little and starting to fidget. We had to hurry. \"I can, but I – I will need your help.\" I held her close against me for just another moment before helping her mount her horse and sending her back to the house. I followed with Cogburn. River managed to bring Harris Austin in just fine. She had carried a corpse before. Once at the main house, Mattie hurried inside to prepare the lower guest bedroom for our patient. I relieved the horses of their assorted burdens of travel gear and provender as well as one dead body. Mattie brought out a rolled-up rug so that we could together drag the Marshal to where she could work on him. It was quite brilliant of her and so I told her. Her smile, caught in the light of the bedside lantern, was brilliant. == Mrs. Ross and the children arrived just as Mattie and I had finished using embroidery thread to close the wound in Cogburn's back. It was not pretty. He awakened part of the way through and it took all my strength to hold him on the bed. We found more whiskey and got him dead drunk. Mrs. Ross and I undressed him and she took the liberty of bathing him – as a widow, she assured me nothing would be a surprise to her. I was too tired to argue and met with Mattie on the bench that was on the far side of the porch after I had taken a slight detour to my own saddle bag. She had brought a lantern out, though a half-moon was shining low in the sky by then. I half-collapsed to the bench, tossing my arm out along the back behind her. She sat stiffly for a bit, her back ramrod-straight. Her hair, though, had fallen from its upswept style of earlier in the evening. She was still in the man's trousers and shirt. I blew out a breath, not knowing quite what to say as her mother bustled inside with Cogburn. I decided that flowery would never do for Mattie Ross, so I decided that my practical girl would want practical notions. I bent over and took off one boot, then the other, and proceeded to remove the spurs from them. \"What are you doing, William?\" she asked, half-turning on the bench to watch more fully. \"Are you feeling all right or is this just a normal night-time routine for you?\" I smiled sideways at her. \"I am feeling just fine, Miss Ross.\" I hefted the spurs in one hand, watching them catch the moonlight. \"How are you?\" Shifting my spurs to the other hand, I reached for hers. She took it, and I twined our fingers together. \"I am doing just fine as well, Mr. LaBoeuf,\" she said, a tired smile in her voice. \"So why did you take off your spurs?\" \"Actually, I wanted to give them to you.\" That was not all I wished to give her, but it was a start. She adjusted her position on the bench, but did not let go of my hand. I smiled a little, watching her face as she thought. \"To me? Your spurs?\" I nodded and she asked, \"Why?\" \"Mattie, I received these spurs with pride when I first became a Ranger.\" She nodded; it was something we had talked about, once upon a time. \"Being a Ranger has always been the most important part of who I was.\" \"You are speaking in the past tense,\" she noted, her voice uncharacteristically hesitant. \"Is something wrong, William?\" I laughed a little and maneuvered to bring myself on my knees in front of her on the porch. I put the spurs in her lap. \"Not a thing, Mattie. But now, there is something more important to me, and as I said, you have more than earned these spurs. What I want to know,\" I said, hurrying because I was more nervous than I had been in many a year, \"is will you take them? And... Will you take the man that gave them to you?\" A breath choked its way from her throat as she stared at me. Her mouth worked, but no further sounds came out. I reached up to cup her face in my hands. \"Mattie? Sweetheart?\" \"William...? You – you want – you want...\" I could have teased her about her uncharacteristic lack of words, but I did not. Instead, I spelled it out in the most simple and powerful words. \"I love you, Mattie Ross. Will you marry me?\" She scooped up the spurs in her hand and leaned forward to kiss me. We were unbalanced and I fell backward, dragging her on top of me. We remained that way for quite some time before Mrs. Ross found us. \"Spurs, Mr. LaBoeuf?\" Mrs. Ross inquired softly as Mattie held them next to her breast when we returned indoors. I nodded and Mattie grinned. \"They are better than an engagement ring, Mama.\" \"I do have one of those, too, when you are ready,\" I told her, pulling the ring I had for her out of my pocket. \"I am,\" she said, a smile shining all over her face. She somehow kept my spurs in her hand while I slipped the ring on her finger. I did not know how she did that. Stay tuned, the final chapter - an epilogue, really - will be posted very soon.[Chapter 20] Chapter Twenty: In Which the Farmer and His Wife Live Happily \"Will? Will you braid my hair?\" I grin at my wife as she tosses me her hairbrush. After all these years, this is still the first part of our going-to-bed ritual. Her hair reaches down past her hips and I do so enjoy running my fingers through it at the end of every day. \"Of course,\" I answer, unwinding it from the coiled braids she wears atop her head for daytime. The year is 1900 and my Mattie and I run what used to be the Ross Farm. It is now the LaBoeuf Farm and we are doing quite well. Mattie's robe over her nightgown has French lace inserts – I had it made for her last Christmas. She pulls it on after I tie off her braid with white ribbon and we take a lantern to check on the children. Our eldest and youngest share a bedroom. They are our sons, Billy and Little Frank. Little Frank used to be the name Mattie called her younger brother, but these days, Frank Ross lives in Pennsylvania, having met and married a young lady whose family signed over part of their farm to her upon her marriage. Not a bad arrangement at all. Billy is twelve and he sleeps there, nearest the window to better protect his little brother, he says. I say he is just like his old man and Mattie just shakes her head and smiles. Billy looks just like her. Little Frank looks like me, with wild hair and a laugh that shakes the roof. He is four years old. They are both sleeping, now, so we move on. \"How's Carrie's burn?\" I ask Mattie in a hushed whisper as we carefully open the door to our daughter's room. Caroline Victoria LaBoeuf has my sister's golden hair and Mattie's serious demeanor. My mother dotes on her. Carrie – who is nine – burned her hand pulling the biscuits out of the oven a mite too early that morning. \"Fine. Mama said the flour would help and it did.\" I shake my head. Mrs. Ross had, while nursing Reuben Cogburn, discovered a latent nursing streak in her and she read everything she could on how to make people feel better. Mattie's hand in mine, we go to the porch, which I have screened in. Reuben Cogburn had married Mrs. Ross and we see their home not too far from ours. Cogburn's gift of stretching the truth has found an audience at last, and he makes real money writing down his stories – real and imagined – and selling them. \"Strange, what people pay for lies,\" Mattie said upon first reading his first story collection. I had to agree. Still, he is a fine storyteller. Just now, she and I settle in on the swing, rocking back and forth as the quiet night sounds filter through the air around us. \"This is a fine night,\" she says. \"It is,\" I answer, pulling her onto my lap. She wraps her arm around me and presses her lips to mine. Our kiss is slow, but the fires are stoked between us and I am fairly certain her robe will find its way to the bedroom floor before we sleep tonight. As always, as we make our way back to our bed, she taps the ornament that is hung next to our doorframe. A slight jingling sound is created and it makes her smile a little, as always. \"You sure do like those spurs, Mrs. LaBoeuf,\" I say, as I do most nights. \"I love the man that gave them to me,\" she responds, as she does most nights. \"You do, do you?\" \"I do.\" It is a fine life.

I really hope to get some good reviews and comments about this story. Each chapter begins with a flashback to any scene in the movie. Enjoy. Movie Scene Sawyer Nelson was biking along the clear sunny weather of Clearwater, Florida USA. He was on his way to Summer School for the fourth year in a row since his dad Lucas Nelson had left him and him mom, Lorraine. Sawyer was even more isolated as his cousin Kyle had set off for the army with his military father that morning. Just as he was passing a beach, he heard a man's voice calling him. \"Hey Kid! You got a phone?\" The fisherman called to him. Sawyer was amazed at seeing a Dolphin washed up by the shore. 10 Minutes later an Ambulance from Clearwater Marine Hospital arrived and Sawyer met Hazel Haskett and her father Clayton \"Clay\" Haskett and all the other workers. Main Story 30 year Old Hazel Nelson looked out at the sun beaming down in the sky from her office in the aquarium. She was daydreaming about her life and how perfect it had been. She met her husband Sawyer when they were 11 and managed to take care of Winter the dolphin. At the age of 16 she and Sawyer started dating. Hazel went to University with him after she was finished being homeschooled and Sawyer achieved all A-s in his senior year. Sawyer had been interested in school since the fall after working with Winter. After 4 years of University, Sawyer and Hazel married in September after graduating. A year later she was pregnant with their first child, a boy named Shawl Nelson. Shawl grew up rearing dolphins and swimming with Winter. Now Shawl was 11 and Hazel was heavily pregnant with their second child. Shawl Nelson got up out of Bed .He was a bright child; he inherited his father's hairstyle and nose and his mother's eyes and lips. The Nelsons lived a block away from the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Shawl finished his breakfast and grabbed his bag and went out to get his bike and cycled to the Aquarium. He loved playing with Winter and helping all the workers and his parents. His mother was on maternity leave but still went to the Aquarium to help out. Sawyer was setting some equipment up for the day when his son strode into the Hospital, \"Hey Son!\" He said as Shawl approached him. \"There are a couple of pools out there that need to be opened and be prepared for the day so if you want you get going!\" He said. \"Ok thanks dad!\" Shawl said. Hazel leaned back in her office chair and sighed. She felt a kick and glanced down at her belly. She was hoping it would be a girl so that she wouldn't feel like the only girl in her family. She then remembered her father Clay's story about the Californian Chumash tribe, she then felt a tear coming as Clay had passed away of cerebrovascular disease 3 months ago at the age of 64. Shawl loved hearing about the Chumash tribe story and was sad when his grandpa had died. They were very close. Hazel then remembered Cameron McCarthy, the man who had supplied Winter's famous prosthetic tail. He was a kind man who was there for all of the crisis they had in winter's life. He died 8 years ago at the age of 82 after undergoing heart bypass surgery. Shawl walked into the room where his mother was as Hazel stopped daydreaming. \"Hi Mom!\" he said as she turned to him. \"Hello Shawl! How are you doing?\" Hazel said to him smiling. \"Well I just finished doing all the jobs dad assigned me to do!\" Shawl said. \"Is there anything else ye need for me to get done?\" he asked nervously. \"No I'd say you're alright for now, why don't you go see what Winter is up to!\" Hazel suggested smiling to her son. \"I guess I could go see\" Shawl said. And I'll stop there. I appreciate your comments and reviews. Thanks for reading![Chapter 2] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 2. MOVIE SCENE Sawyer was given the chance to stay and work with the marine animals including Winter. One Day while he and Hazel were holding him Winter wiggled free of his grasp and started doing a swimming sort of wiggling motion side to side. Everyone seemed impressed but little did they know, it was damaging her spine. Story Scene After the chat with his mother, Shawl went out to the main hospital working area where Winter's pool was. Two workers Jamie and Oliver, who worked with Sawyer, were at the poolside with him. Sawyer was gathering a fish drink for Winter and he fed it to her. Shawl watched and then tried to get his father's attention. \"Oh hey son!\" Sawyer said when his son got his attention, \"Hey dad, how's Winter coming along?\" Shawl asked. \"She's fine!\" his dad notified him. \"Oh hey I have a job for you, why don't ya go manage the gift shop when we're open?\" Sawyer suggested. \"Sure Okay!\" Shawl said. The hour was long. Shawl was selling postcards and other gifs and souvenirs to Americans, Canadians, Irish people, English people and loads of other tourists. He had a hard time understanding Canadian and Mexican accents. Afterwards he was sweeping the floor when he began to wonder if he was interested in getting a career like this when he was older. In the meantime Hazel was still sitting in the office as she watched all the work take place in the window out by her office. She was still thinking about her life since that was what she would normally do when she was alone. She looked through a couple of X-Rays of wounded animals and remembered the X-Ray of Winter's bulge in her spine leading to the creation of the prosthetic tail. \"Winter has had that for at least 19 years now!\" she thought to herself. \"It is still brings back the memories!\" And I'll stop right there read and review.[Chapter 3] Dolphin Tale 2 chapter 3. Hi guys i'm back with chapter 3. This chapter will focus on every character i can try to think of from the movie. Movie SCENE Sawyer and his Mum Lorraine walked through the halls of the gloomy looking VA Hospital. He had arrived home a few days ago to find out that his cousin Kyle was injured in an explosion during his serving in the army and his mother and aunt shredded tears of joy at the fact that Kyle was coming back. But he ditched them to go to the VA hospital. Sawyer and Lorraine walked into an office where they found Kyle in a wheelchair and what Sawyer would have thought was a crazy man banging a leg shaped piece of metal of the ground. Kyle took him out to comfort him and after he had gone Sawyer saw some prothestic wearing men playing basketball and seemed fairly impress with the way there prothestics worked. So he walked over to McCarthy who was working with Kyle earlier on \"Excuse me, can i ask you a really weird question?\" Sawyer began to him... MOVIE SCENE Hazel was once again in her office trying hard not to hope the baby would start coming. She looked around and in a small cabinet under her desk found some photo albums. She took out a few and started to look through them. There were some of her and her mother before she had died. Seeing these made Hazel cry a little. In fact it had made her cry alot since both her parents had died now. \"Mom i miss you so much!\" She cried. \"I wish you would have met Sawyer you would have loved him, and our children\" she said between tears. She finally stopped and continued looking through the albums. She smiled after coming across photos of her and Sawyer when they got married. She smiled to herself as she had a flashback to where they were dancing on the dance floor holding each other close with her arms around her neck and his arms around her waist. Staring eye to eye at each other they smiled and before she knew Hazel found herself leaning forward. He was doing the same and they became lost in a passionate, loving kiss. She smiled to herself as she found photos of when Shawl was a baby. She couldn't believe he was almost 11 now and that a new Nelson was on the way. Meanwhile Sawyer was walking to his car to get something when he notice Shawl out by the houseboat Hazel's father and grandfather had owned. The family were allowed have it after Clay died. Smiling to himself he walked over to him. \"Everything OK kid?\" he asked. \"Oh i'm fine Dad, it's just i've been wondering about how our family is so connected to marine biology and dolphins and other water related things!\" Shawl responded. \"Oh!\" Sawyer said. \"Well i wasn't very smart about this stuff either until i met Winter and your mom!\" Sawyer said. \"What do you mean about that you weren't very smart about this?\" Shawl asked his dad through a sense of puzzlement in his eyes. \"Well when i was your age, i did very badly in school. Failed almost everything. But i was on my way to summer school one bright morning when a fisherman stopped me and asked to help. I was shocked to see he had found a dolphin washed up ashore by the beach. He called for the Clearwater Marine Hospital and then while he did that, i cut the ropes off of the dolphin and the crab trap that had been trapped in her tail. Some time later the hospital came and your mother walked up to me and awkwardly asked if i had single handly cut the rope. Then the next day i sneaked into the marine hospital only to come in contact with a crazy pelican who had managed to sneak into the hospital. Then i heard humming and tried to make a break for it but ran right into your mom. Then the pelican start wrecking havoc but we got him away. Your mom then noticed that i was the boy from the beach. So after she showed me Winter's condition and got me away from her dad, i ran home and started researching dolphins online. Sparked my whole interest in Dolphins.\" Sawyer explained. Shawl took all that information in and when he did finally managed to speak again. \"But what about that pelican? What happened to him after all of that?\" \"Oh Rufus? Yeah a year after everything had happened he flew away and wasn't seen again for a long time. He never flew back here\" Sawyer said. Back in her office Hazel was looking through the second photo album. It contained life of her as a child with her father and grandfather on the houseboat. The photos showed them sailing across coastal waters of the United States. She smiled at another photo showing her selling her homemade lemonade icicle sticks to people in a lemonade stand. She used to love making them for people. She remembered her grandfather saying \"Nothing goes down with Crappy News like one of my granddaughter's lemonade icicles.\" \"Days like these always make me smile any way.. now that i have a husband son and future son or daughter\" Hazel said to herself. She glanced down at her stomach and rubbed it then said \"If your a girl then you'll make me happy i'm sure!\" And that's all for now keep reading and reviewing! Thanks.[Chapter 4] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 4 Hey Guys! What's up, uh yeah so it has been a couple of months since I last updated and I'm sorry about that, just the usual family stuff and school life and everything! BIG NEWS: Here is a little competition for you readers who love my Dolphin Tale 2 story. Since Hazel is pregnant in this story I have launched a little competition for you readers. You will get to decide what gender will the baby be and what name I should give it! The most sent gender and name wins! MOVIE SCENE Sawyer biked out into the city towards the marine hospital with a wagon on the back of his backpack. At the Hospital he opened the large box with a big bunch of Toys flying out, Hazel was very impressed. There was a rubber duck, that turned out to be Winter's favourite, and rubber inflatables. However when he went home that day, he found his mother and neighbour and aunt crying in the kitchen, they told him his cousin Kyle, whom he got on great with, had been injured in an accident at military base. But the good news was that he was coming home! Story Scene Hazel rubbed her stomach lightly, she loved the feel. She was also checking her emails on her computer. Some came from her friends and relatives, others just work related. Shawl, in the meantime, raced home, went into the kitchen, grabbed a snack from the fridge, jumped up into his bedroom, turned on a computer and started researching his parents' place of work. He saw two photos one of his mother and another of his grandfather (deceased now). They were listed as managers of the Hospital. He also arrived at Winter's main page of the website. There he found out the through story of Winter being found. \"Wow!\" He thought to himself as he took a lot of the information in. It was just a bunch of information that his dad didn't tell him yet. An article read: \"Helped by McCarthy of the Veteran Affairs hospital Winter tried on several different tails. Sawyer Nelson, a good friend to them at the time, got the idea to create a Fundraiser for Winter after he gave an unplanned tour of the hospital and Winter to a girl and her mom from Atlanta, Georgia. The Girl's leg was amputated so this was how a brave young boy managed to save the hospital from the effects of the recession and foreclosure!\" Shawl took all of that information in. \"Son! You home?\" Sawyer called out as he and Hazel entered the house that evening. \"Yeah upstairs!\" called their son. \"Hazel, I have to say he's getting surprisingly interested in our work facilities and everything else that we do.\" Sawyer informed his wife. \"Oh sure, he just needs time to get to know it better! He's only 11!\" Hazel said softly and flirty to her husband. Sawyer smiled and kissed her softly. \"Will we make the Dinner then?\" He said after they broke apart. \"Sure! I'm starved\" Hazel said. They then cooked some pasta carbonara and Shawl sat quietly as they ate not knowing whether or not he should tell them about what he read online. And that's all for now! Thanks for reading! And I just found out online that Dolphin Tale 2 will be in theatres next year, so yay! Anyways thanks for reading![Chapter 5] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 5.

Also keep sending in your suggestions on Hazel's baby gender and name. I want two more by the next chapter. Enjoy. Hazel and Sawyer sat at the dinner table shortly afterwards. Shawl was in his room playing video games. \"Sawyer, I kinda think Shawl isn't getting much time spent working with animals particularly Winter.\" Hazel said to her husband. \"I know how you feel.\" Sawyer assured her. \"And to think he only has one grandparent per parent\" responded Hazel. \"Well I know how I can settle it…\" Sawyer said. \"It's something my mom did for me!\" The Next day Shawl got up out of bed. \"Morning mum!\" He said yawning and patting his head. \"Hi son.\" Hazel said. She was doing dishes, while Sawyer had gone to open up the hospital. On the table next to the breakfast bowl, Shawl saw a bag, the tag read \"Your new school uniform, love mom and dad\" He opened to find the wet suit his dad wore when he was Shawl's age. He stared at it in surprise before turning to his mom. \"Thank You! Thank You!\" He said with delight running to his mom and hugging her, feeling her stomach against his head, \"Awh your welcome!\" Hazel said. \"Let's make sure it fits!\" She said. At the Hospital, Shawl wore the wet suit. He helped a few of the workers to look after the animals. Hazel was in the meantime, alone in her office like usual. She was cruising through the e-mails. She then heard her cell phone ringing. \"Hello this is Hazel Nelson of the Clearwater Marine Hospital, how may I help you?\" She asked. Her mouth fell open when she heard what was next. Sawyer drove the truck with Shawl and a few employees over to the nearest beach. The caller, who was a young 16 year old boy, saw them approaching. \"Hi I'm Benjamin Styles\" He said as he and Sawyer shook hands. \"I saw a Dolphin washed up ashore here and I wasn't sure what to do.\" Benjamin explained. The workers and Shawl ran over to the Dolphin. \"Who are you here with Benjamin?\" asked Sawyer while he and another member of staff interviewed him. \"Well my dad is a fisher and we were here to go fishing in my uncle Tom's boat and Tom is running late like always and dad forgot our fishing poles so he told me to stay here while he went back to get em. Tom would usually arrive about 11:00.\" Benjamin said \"It's 11:20.\" said Cody, the worker with Sawyer. \"\"And that's as close to 11:00 my uncle ever gets!\" said Benjamin. \"He's a male\" Lucy, one of the workers said. \"Male bottlenose dolphin!\" added John, another worker. Just then two cars pulled up by the car park. Two men got out. \"Son what are you doing?\" one of the men asked. \"Your son?\" Cody asked. \"Uh yeah! What's going on here?\" asked the man. \"Well he's after making a brilliant discovery, he discovered a blue male bottlenose dolphin just 15 minutes ago.\" Sawyer said. \"Holy smoke!\" the other man said. \"Can I get your names?\" Cody asked. \"Tom and John Styles\" responded Tom. They shook hands with Sawyer and Cody. \"Sawyer Nelson, worker at Clearwater Marine Hospital.\" Sawyer than said. Cody then added to Benjamin. \"You've been a good help kid.\" They loaded the Dolphin on a stretcher into the ambulance. On the way back Sawyer phoned Hazel at the aquarium to tell her about what happened. Okay guys that's all for now, we're one chapter away from Hazel giving birth just to let ye know. Hope you enjoyed this chapter.[Chapter 6] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 6 Drumaboi9 with another chapter for this story! I haven't had a chance with work and school to do so! So guys this is it! The Chapter we've been waiting for! Hazel is gonna give birth to a either a boy or a girl! The winning gender and name of my contest will be revealed when the baby comes! Sawyer drove the van with the injured dolphin in it, along with Shawl, Cody and the other workers, back to the hospital. He phoned Hazel to inform her that they had rescued the Dolphin and were on the way back. Meanwhile at her office in the hospital, Hazel was looking through her emails, when all of a sudden, a strange feeling went around her. Terrified, suddenly, she clasped her hands around her stomach with a look of fear on her face. The phone then rang. In a panic she picked it up. \"Hi\" she managed to say down the line. \"Hazel hi it's Sawyer, I just want to let you know that-\" \"GET ME TO A HOSPITAL NOW!\" Hazel roared down the line after saying \"Oh thank god it's him!\" under her breath. \"Why what up?\" Sawyer asked oblivious to what was happening. \"My Baby is coming!\" Hazel said in a panic. When he heard this, Sawyer nearly swerved into a FedEx truck. \"Whoa! Dad what you do that for? You nearly got us killed!\" Shawl said gasping for breath. \"Don't worry we'll be there. Get someone from the Hospital to drive you and Shawl and I will meet you there in 25 Minutes!\" Sawyer said. \"Okay but be quick!\" Hazel groaned as she got up out of her chair. Half Hour Later Hazel managed to get her mother in law, Lorraine who was Sawyer's mother, to drive her to the hospital. Sawyer and Shawl sped down nearly through the ENTIRE of Florida, to get to the hospital. When they got there, Sawyer ran down to the receptionist saying \"Hi I need a Hazel Nelson, she came here at 11 o'clock.\" \"Room 25\" The Receptionist informed him. They ran down that aisle only to find Lorraine, who Sawyer was surprised to see, sitting in a chair. She stood up instantly when she saw her son and grandson coming over. \"Oh thank goodness! Hazel went into labour and asked me to drive her here!\" She said as she wrapped her arms around them both. \"Yeah we know Grandma!\" Shawl said struggling for breath. Another Half Hour Later. Sawyer went into the room. While Shawl and Lorraine were outside in the waiting hall. Shawl found himself sitting next to an anxious 11 year old girl. \"First Sibling?\" he asked. \"Yeah ain't that obvious?\" She responded staring at Shawl before losing her anxious gaze the minute her eyes faced Shawl's. They changed from worried to wow. But Shawl luckily did not see this. \"This is also my first time sitting in these chairs.\" He said. \"Oh!\" was all the girl seemed to say. Sawyer than came out. \"Shawl, Mom, come along. There'someone who wants to meet the two of you,\" He said gesturing them. Shawl got up from his seat waving to the girl who dreamily waved back, and received his grandma's arm around him as they walked in. Hazel was in the bed holding the new baby. \"Hi!\" She mouthed to them with tears of joy. \"Come in Come in!\" she then said clearly. \"Shawl Nelson, say hello to your new baby sister.\" Sawyer introduced his son to his daughter. \"Her name is Abigail.\" Hazel then stated. \"She's beautiful.\" Lorraine said also with tear of joy. \"Can't believe I have a baby granddaughter after all these years!\" Hazel smiled at her. Shawl also smiled. He could not take his eyes off his new sister. She had blue eyes and streaks of blonde hair like her mother. \"Mom changes are she is gonna grow up just like you!\" He smiled. \"Here I'll take your family picture!\" Lorraine said as her son handed her his camera. \"So what's the baby's name?\" The Nurse asked. \"Abigail.\" Hazel said. Lorraine took the picture. Shawl went back out smiling and overjoyed. He sat himself, unwarily, back down next to the girl who developed a crush on him. \"So uh what did your old man say?\" She asked. Shawl woke up after hearing that. \"Oh. I have a new baby sister, Abigail.\" He said. He looked at this girl up to down. \"You look a bit familiar. What's your name?\" \"Sarah. Sarah Sinclair.\" The girl said. \"Wait, Sinclair? You're the daughter of Sandra Sinclair!\" He said amazed! \"Yeah why?\" Sarah said. \"Because my dad said that when he was my age, his cousin Kyle fell in love with her and she fell in love back with her.\" Shawl said. \"Oh Yeah my mom told me that actually.\" Sarah responded. \"But she didn't say much about him after that. I think he must have went away and mom was upset about it or something.\" \"Probably.\" Shawl agreed. An Hour later, Shawl and Sawyer arrived back at the Marine Hospital to tell everyone about Abigail. But all Shawl seemed to think about was his conversation with Sarah at the hospital, could he be in love with her? \"Hey dad…I'm going to bike home if that's alight.\" He awkwardly said to Sawyer after a while. \"Take all your time kid!\" Sawyer said oblivious to the fact his son could have been experiencing his first love. So this chapter welcomes Abigail Nelson to the story. As for the Dolphin at the start, we'll get back to that next chapter, I promise . In the meantime, I'm keeping busy with work and school to do fanfiction. And also you can find me on YouTube as well. I do drum covers. So until next chapter… Take Care![Chapter 7] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 7 Update: I know I haven't been uploading in a while, I originally wanted to wait until the movie came out so that this story would not be influenced, but the good news is I'm going to the Movie tomorrow! Yay! Also find me on YouTube \"Liam Holton\" and like my Facebook page \"Liam Holton Drummer\". I do drum covers on YouTube. A Week Later A week later Abigail was brought home from the Hospital. Sawyer, Hazel and Shawl would move mountains for that little girl. She had bright blue eyes like her mother and streaks of blonde hair. Today was the day that the workers at the aquarium were to see her for the very first time. At lunch break that day, Hazel arrived at the aquarium with the carrier holding Abigail. Shawl and Sawyer were working in the aquarium. \"Hey Everyone!\" Hazel chirped as she arrived in the break room. \"Oh Hey!\" \"Hello!\" and all other things the workers said as they got up and hugged Hazel and wanted to get a view of the little baby. \"Aw look at her!\" One of the females said as Hazel set the carrier on top of the table. Sawyer and Shawl entered the room. 'Oh hey Hazel!\" Sawyer said as he noticed his wife standing there. \"Hi Sawyer! Hi Shawl sweetie!\" she acknowledge her husband and son together. \"Looks like everyone in the aquarium likes little Abbie already!\" smiled Shawl as he saw the crowd hovering all over the table blocking his view of the carrier. Shawl ran towards Winter's pool and yelled \"Winter!\" as he jumped straight in. Shawl loved swimming with Winter as much as his parents did when they were his age. \"So Mom and Dad brought the baby in today!\" Shawl said as he held onto the dolphin. Winter made her famous tweedy bird noise in response. Shawl later got out and dried up and went back home. Arriving home, he didn't expect to see a bunch of old baby toys and new clothes crowding the areas as he entered. He slightly dodged a heavy box and nearly broke his neck over a large box as he tried to get to the kitchen and rush upstairs. He noticed at the far end of the hall, the old room was gonna be Abigail's new bedroom. He took a peek inside, the wall was half painted in pink. A Cot that was already made lay in the middle of the room. A bassinet also lay next to the cot and a cot mobile box was there. This was all too much for Shawl to take in. \"Wow Mom literally went overboard!\" He said trying to half smile and half look jealous, maybe he was getting just a little jealous of the fact that he had a sister to get used to. When he was done touring the new baby's room, he went to his own room to relax. He also had another thing on his mind. The cute girl from the hospital that he met when Abigail was born. He hadn't completely forgotten about that. He then heard a text message alert on his cell phone. He picked it up expecting it to be from one of his parents. It wasn't, in fact it was actually from the girl he met! Looking wide eyed, Shawl opened it up and read it in his mind to himself: \"Hey man! I told my mom about you and she said that her boyfriend Kyle is a cousin of your dad's! Kyle spoke to your dad and he said you can come down if you like! I'm sure you're ok with that!\" It read. Shawl looked surprised. \"Why didn't dad tell me?\" He said to himself actually smiling for the first time that day! So he rang his parents about and they said he could go over cause they were gonna be working late that evening and Abigail would have Sawyer's mom Lorraine look after her at her home. At 6pm that night, he got ready to go out and then grabbed his bike in the garage and cycle to the house that Kyle, Sandra and Sarah lived in. Looking nervous, he knocked on the door and Kyle and his wife Sarah answered it eagerly expecting him. \"Shawl Nelson! You get cooler each day!\" Kyle greeted his young cousin. \"Hi Kyle!\" Shawl said smiling at him and shaking his hand. Sandra hugged him tightly after that, in fact so tightly he couldn't breathe! \"Now, here is someone who has been waiting for you!\" Sandra said she turned her direction to the stairs: \"Sarah! He's here!\" A long girlish squeal followed clearly down the stairs after that. Shawl looked around shyly as he waited for Sarah to come down. He saw pictures on the wall, one of Kyle with Sawyer when he did the Olympics and got a few medals. Another of him and Sandra together and one of them with Sarah when she was young. He also saw one of Sawyer Hazel and himself when he was about 5 years old. He snapped out of his looking of pictures when he heard footsteps coming down the stairs. Sarah came down and eagerly saw Shawl. \"Hello! I got your text and thought I'd-\" Shawl began but was cut by Sarah hugging him tightly. He hugged her back nearly unable to breathe. \"Well thanks for inviting me over.\" He said politely when she let go. \"Mom Dad! This is the boy I told you about!\" Sarah said when they went into the kitchen. \"My daughter has been talking about you all week!\" Sandra smiled. \"Yeah she got anxious about you because most of the boys in her school give her a hard time.\" Kyle said. Back at the Hospital \"She'll need to be fed in an hour.\" Hazel informed Lorraine as she got everything ready for Abigail. \"If she needs changing, she may cry.\" \"Thanks Hazel.\" Lorraine smiled as she walked out with Abigail to the car. Hazel went back to her office and put her leather jacket on a hook. She then sat by her computer and checked any emails. While this was happening, Sawyer was busy at work helping the dolphin that they had found a week ago on the day that Abigail was born. They put the small dolphin in a small pool just a few places away from where Winter was. \"Okay you guys work with that I'm gonna go check on Winter.\" He instructed as he walked off. He walked over to the pool where Winter was splashing about with her tail. \"Hey Winter!\" he smiled. \"Feeling alright?\" Winter made her tweedy bird noise to say \"yes!\" Meanwhile Shawl was starting to slowly enjoy himself at Kyle's house with the family. He was getting to know Sarah a lot better than he originally did. \"So Abigail was brought home only on Monday?\" Kyle asked. \"Yep!\" Shawl chirped. \"I have a picture on my cell phone of me with her.\" He said fishing out his phone and showing them the picture. \"Aww!\" Sarah said looking at it. \"That's lovely.\" Sandra smiled. \"She's really cute!\" Kyle added. \"Thanks! We bought her to the hospital today so all the other workers could see her for the first time!\" Shawl explained. \"Will you bring her over here sometime maybe?\" Sandra asked. Shawl, and the others of course, saw from a corner of their eyes that Sarah grinned at that question. \"Sure! Sure I will!\" Shawl said. And that's enough there! Well I hope you enjoyed that. Keep clicking on this story from time to time. I'll only be updating every once in a while because my senior year will prob be going hectic anyway! Once again find me on YouTube and don't forget to check my other stories! Make sure you Read and Review![Chapter 8] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 8. Wasn't planning on doing a fanfic tonight, but Fanficer dolphinsintheblue is literally in love with my story that she wanted me to continue it today. I could nearly be out of inspiration in this by now! Enjoy all I have for now. Hazel went out to see if any of the workers were making progressed with Winter and all the other animals. \"Hey how's Winter doing?\" She asked Lucy a worker of about her age. \"Oh she's fine. She just wanted a while to herself.\" Lucy responded. \"Well I suppose you might want to feed her a fish milkshake.\" Hazel insisted patting Winter's rostrum. So Lucy went out to kitchen and came back 20 minutes later with a fish milkshake in her hand. Hazel held winter steadily while Lucy did her best to feed Winter the bottle. They eventually succeeded and Winter was happy. Meanwhile, Shawl was really enjoying his new friend's company. He knew Kyle and Sandra well enough to get to know Sarah in like 5 minutes. By the time 9pm came he eventually went back home. His Dad was back at the house and he had known where his son was, just pretended to be unaware of it. \"So how did your little play date go?\" He asked his son when he walked through the door. \"Um fine. Sarah seems like a real nice girl.\" His son said going to the kitchen. \"Invite them over sometime. It'd be nice to catch up with my cousin after like a few months.\" Sawyer said sipping his coffee. \"Good Night anyway dad\" Shawl said walking up the stairs. Sawyer waited until he heard the door slam shut and then turned away. He had a weird thought coming to his mind. He frequently got teased and tormented by this mean kid in his grade when he was in high school called Karl. Karl always called him \"Dolphin Boy\" and Hazel \"Dolphin Girl\". Sawyer had to vent his anger frequently every time he ran into this mean Karl kid. Karl always suspected that Sawyer was dating Hazel, even though he got the courage to ask her out in the middle of his Junior Year. Since then Hazel always managed to help get through this mean Karl kid every day. His thoughts were interrupted when Hazel had arrived home, shutting the door noticeably loud behind her. \"Oh hey sweetie.\" Sawyer said awkwardly when Hazel joined him at the table. \"What an evening it was.\" Hazel said. \"I feel like I could use a walk. Wanna come with?\" She asked her husband. \"Uh yeah ok.\" Sawyer said. They walked to a nearby park that was 20 minutes away from where they lived. \"So my mom's taking care of Abigail tonight?\" Sawyer asked his wife when they sat down on a park bench. \"Yeah she called and said she would so that we can get a routine with the preparations and such.\" Hazel said as she lay her head on Sawyer's shoulder while he put his arm around hers. \"The Stars are beautiful tonight.\" Hazel said looking up at them. \"Not as beautiful as the one next to me.\" Sawyer responded smiling. Hazel giggled. She figured this could be a good time for them to have so quality time together since Abigail was born. Sawyer looked down at her. When her eyes met his, he leaned in and kiss her lightly. She kissed back. \"So I hope you're getting the aquarium running smoothly now.\" Hazel said as she continued to have her head on his shoulder. \"Yeah I do.\" Sawyer said. \"So I just wanted to tell you this. Shawl met this girl named Sarah at the hospital the day Abigail was born. And she's actually Sandra Sinclair's daughter. Remember my cousin Kyle is married to her. Kyle rang me and said that Sarah literally fell in love with Shawl when they first met that she couldn't stop talking about all week. So tonight I said he could go and meet up with them and he did.\" Sawyer explained to his wife. \"Aww that's really sweet.\" Hazel said smiling. \"Yeah Kyle said he hopes they'll come around next week. So that we could meet their daughter.\" Sawyer said. \"I'd like that.\" Hazel grinned. For the next 20 minutes they sat on the couch lovingly. Before long, Hazel had nearly fallen asleep on her husband shoulder so they went home and went to bed. And that's it for this chapter, read and review. Thanks.[Chapter 9] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 9 Hello Everyone! Drumaboi9 here! So So Sooooooo sorry that I haven't updated in months. Senior had gotten hectic but I'm done now for the summer! And what better way to kick off summer than by writing a fanfic! In this chapter I will focus on Abigail, the Dolphin that was rescued and of course Shawl and his developing friendship with Sarah! Enjoy Few Days Later Sawyer and Hazel got everything ready, Sandra, Kyle and Sarah were coming over tonight. They prepared Italian food for dinner and Shawl was helping out with the plans. Shawl always went to his parents for advice on how to handle relationships, since he was too young for this kind of thing. Sawyer told him just to be himself. Abigail looked as cute as ever in her little pink outfit, Sawyer and Hazel had bought it for her. Shawl quietly admitted that he felt a little jealous of his parents devoting their time to their daughter but he knew that she was only a baby. He had wanted to be introduced as the older brother and the one who would protect her from school bullies in the future. Shawl's train of thought came to a halt when the doorbell rang. \"Oh they're here!\" Sawyer said. Hazel and Shawl stood behind him as he welcome his cousin and Sandra and Sarah into the house. Hazel shook hands with them and the adults led each other to the kitchen leaving Shawl and Sarah together. \"So….you wanna come hang upstairs?\" asked Shawl. Sarah squealed excitedly to herself before slapping herself in the face to stop. Luckily Shawl had never noticed as they walked upstairs. While they were upstairs Shawl led her to the attic which served as a little hangout for Shawl. It contained a TV, a couch and some of his favorite things like his game console and his toy figures. Sarah looked in amazing at his amazing hangout. It looked like she was definitely going to have fun tonight. They lay down on the couch together watching Disney movies and laughing together. \"Sarah really likes Shawl. She talks about him nearly every day. I think they could be very great friends.\" Kyle and Sandra said to Sawyer and Hazel. \"Oh Really?\" Hazel asked \"Yeah sure Shawl like the only boy who has never given her a hard time. Most of the others at school always give her a hard time and she's had trouble making friends at school every now and then.\" Kyle said. \"Yeah Shawl is like a real genuine nice kid. He never gets in trouble, never lies or anything\" Sawyer said. \"I wonder if Sarah could actually even be in love at such a young age, like\" Sandra said. \"I always thought that Shawl would be too young for girls. He seems content though with this friendship he has, almost as if, he….doesn't know that Sarah has a crush on him\" Hazel said. True to her words, Shawl didn't know Sarah's feelings for him were that strong. He simply looked at her as a friend. However while he was watching his favorite movie, Sarah saw how engrossed he was and took a risk. She leaned right over and kissed him on his cheek. Shawl could only blush and get caught off guard blushing his cheeks off. He turned slowly to Sarah who dreamily lay her head on his shoulder. He smiled a little not able to speak or do anything. Hazel then decided to get Abigail and bring her out to show Kyle and Sandra. Abigail was sleeping in her crib for the evening. She slowly walked into the room and carried her out and then made her way to the living room where Kyle, Sandra and Sawyer were waiting. Shawl and Sarah went down as well but Hazel told them to go ahead because she wanted to surprise everyone. Shawl watched as they all waited in the living room. \"Awh would ya look at, ah that is a darling\" Sandra said with her arms out as Hazel entered the room with Abigail in her arms. They all crowded around Hazel to look at Abigail while Shawl just chatted quietly with Kyle. \"So how's life goin?\" He asked quietly to Kyle who was sitting on the sofa next to Shawl. \"Yeah it's real grand!\" Kyle said grinning. \"Cool!\" Shawl responded. Later that night after dinner, Kyle, Sandra, Sawyer and Hazel were downstairs watching TV while Shawl and Sarah hung out together in Shawl's attic. Sarah awkwardly asked \"Did I startled you with that kiss?\" \"Uh no, no not at all.\" Shawl said trying to keep as cool as possible with it. \"I really like you Shawl. You're so cute that I just can't resist your good looks and sweet personality.\" Sarah said blushing slightly as she said this. \"Oh really?\" Shawl asked \"I think you're awesome too. I like you too.' He said. Sarah was so overjoyed with what she heard that she wrapped her arms around in a tight embrace and he hugged back. Sarah felt her own tears of joy as she lay in her dream boy's arms. The Next day Sawyer and Hazel went to work leaving Shawl and Abigail with Lorraine. Sawyer thought that the get-together with Kyle and Sandra worked perfectly and was happy that they got to spend quality time together. Shawl actually realised that he was in fact in love with Sarah and he could feel a sense of happiness in himself as he watch TV at his grandma's house. He wondered when he would get to see Sarah again. Meanwhile Sawyer and his team went to work with the bottlenose dolphin that was found in the beach about a week or two ago. They named him \"Jack\". Jack was getting better and his sunburn was healing with great success. The gang had predicted that within a week he would be returned to the ocean. Shawl loved hanging with his baby sister. He helped Lorraine feed, change and put Abigail to sleep. Although at times he did feel a little bit jealous of his parents devoting their time to their little girl, he always wanted to help out too! I'll leave it there guys, read and review![Chapter 10] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 10 My 10 th chapter :) I didn't think I'd reach ten chapters in this story. So this one will flash forward to a few months after the events of the last chapter and a lot will change. Here we go Few Months Later Shawl stood on the side of the dock on the beach about to make a dive into the water. It was good day for swimming. He loved swimming and his body got a nice build from it in the last few years. He was also looking at taking up surfing. He then took a deep breath before diving in a somersault into the clear Florida Ocean. When he resurfaced he swam as fast as he could to shore before dunking himself into the bottom to swim under the water and then surfaced again. After a few hours, he decided to get ready to go home. He dried himself off before putting back on his shorts and t-shirt and shoes. He got his bike and drove away from the beach sweat lashing from him. When he reached home he walked inside calling \"Hello\", no one answered. \"Hellooooo\" he called again. Still no one answered. Shrugging to himself he decided to go into the shower to dry off. He then decided to rest on his sofa in his hangout lounge upstairs. Later that evening Sawyer arrived home having closed up the aquarium while Hazel had took Abigail for a walk in her pram. Sawyer searched upstairs for his son and found him sleeping peacefully on his sofa. He smiled at that sighting deciding not to wake his son up from the nap he was having. \"I can tell he is wrecked after swimming all day.\" Sawyer said to himself as he went to the kitchen and started making himself some coffee. 5 minutes later Shawl emerged downstairs. \"Oh hey dad.\" He said. \"Hey son\" \"I thought ye were going to be home half an hour ago\" Shawl said. \"Yeah, but we had to work late today.\" Sawyer explained, \"Your mom's taking Abbie for a walk\" \"Dad, do I seem different to you this summer?\" Shawl asked. \"You're doing a lot more better stuff that's for sure.\" Sawyer replied. Just then Hazel walked with the sleeping baby in her arms. \"Well Abigail's tired\" she said as she quietly closed the door behind her. \"I'm going to go put her to bed. Then I'll come down.\" \"So son have you figured out what you wanna do for your birthday next week?\" Sawyer asked his son. Shawl was going to be 12 next week. \"Not sure yet dad\" was the reply. Hazel came down saying \"I reckon we could throw you a little party.\" \"Yea we can invite a few friends over\" Sawyer added. \"I'll look into it myself mom and dad, thanks anyways.\" Shawl smiled as he took a can of coke up with him to his room. The Next Day Shawl was helping to heal a wound animal at the aquarium while his father as usual worked with Winter. Hazel was operating in the clinic on an Otter with a hook stuck inside him. Shawl even had an opportunity to swim with Winter which to Sawyer and Hazel reminded them of all those times they swam with her when they were his age. The Next Week \"Happy Birthday son' Sawyer and Hazel said together when their now 12 year old son entered the kitchen that morning for breakfast. Hazel wrapped her arms tightly around her son who hugged back. \"Thanks\" Shawl said as he sat down. \"Here's a gift from the two of us.\" Sawyer said as he handed his son a small box. It was a necklace with a dolphin on it. \"Hey cool necklace, thanks!\" Shawl grinned opening it and trying it on around him. \"Glad you like it son, saved us a bit to get it so it did.\" Sawyer smiled. The Doorbell suddenly rang and Hazel went to answer it, Lorraine stood at the doorway. \"I came with a little present for my grandson.\" She smiled. Hazel led her into the kitchen \"Oh hi grandma.\" Shawl said. \"Happy Birthday\" Lorraine smiled handing him the present she got him. He opened it to reveal a book about dolphins that Lorraine had given to Sawyer when he got interested in Dolphins. \"Wow, thanks!\" Shawl said giving his granny a hug. \"You're welcome\" Lorraine hugged back. Later that day Shawl was killing time at a local shopping mall spending some birthday money his parents had given him. This was a distraction to get him out of the house while Sawyer and Hazel cooked up a little surprise at the house for later that day. After a few hours Shawl decided to just go around the beach and take in the calm breezy air. He sat on the sand watching boats ride along the coast and children happily at play on the sand. Just then he got a text saying he had to go home because there was a surprise for him. Looking confused he got on his bike and rode home. Once he reached the house he opened the door to find it pitch black. \"Huh, why is it dark in here?\" he asked as he felt around for a light switch. He then turned it on to reveal a party setting around the kitchen, \"Wow!\" he said taking it all in in amazement before he was pulled back and hugged by someone. When he was freed he turned around to see Sarah, the girl who was mad for him! \"Sarah? Hi how are you?\" he said surprised. He hadn't seen Sarah in the last few months since they were down so he was definitely happy to see her again. \"Happy Birthday!\" Sarah said excitedly before grabbing him into another hug. \"Uh thanks!\" Shawl said trying to breathe normally. When she let go Sawyer and Hazel entered with Kyle and Sandra. \"Thought we might surprise you!\" Sawyer said patting him on the head. \"I can see that\" Shawl said grinning. Like him Sarah had changed in the last few months or so. She had her hair in a ponytail this time. Hopefully she still wasn't as obsessed with Shawl as she was back then. \"Anyway I bought you a little something because I care about you.\" Sarah said handing him a small rectangle shaped parcel. He opened it to find a picture of the two of them together that was taken when Kyle and his girls were over at the house. \"Aww that's real cute\" Hazel said. \"Yea she made the frame herself in art class at school.\" Sandra added. \"Thanks Sarah you're the best.\" Shawl said wrapping his arm around Sarah in a hug. Sarah blushed a little when this happened. Later that night Shawl was tired and just about to go to sleep when he looked back on today's crazy events. \"Well mom and dad got me out of the house so they could prepared all of that for me. It was strange but worth the wait\" he smiled to himself as he fell asleep.[Chapter 11] Dolphin Tale 2 A New chapter! Well I have decided to try and get into the habit of updating my fanfictions every so often. And of all my stories I have written here, I think I prefer this one :) Enjoy. So I want to try and make this chapter seem longer than my other chapters and also I have a little surprise in store, Shawl in this part of story is becoming a heartthrob with girls. xD Enjoy! Plus this chapter echoes a few moments from the first movie! A Month later The Nelsons were taking a holiday to Miami for 2 weeks. They were staying in a hotel just about close to a beautiful beach. Shawl was always swimming, surfing and even fly boarding in the water when he was at this beach. Not only was he into Marine biology like his parents but he did love water sports as well. One day he was swimming in the ocean at the beach, the clear water and sunny weather giving him a nice tan color. When he got to shore, he wrapped a towel around his head and left it around his neck as he stood on the sand letting his chest dry out. However his widened as he looked to his right hand side and saw something. It looked like a dolphin, he got closer to it, and it WAS a dolphin. \"Wow.\" He said in amazement to himself as he stared down at it. It was a large bottlenose dolphin, he saw a tangled net trapped under its tail and up to the fins. He fetched a pocketknife from his pocket and attempted to carefully cut the net from the tail hoping not to injure the dolphin in any way. \"Come on mom this is where all those surgery practices come handy.\" He whispered to himself as he carefully sliced the nets. Once he had gotten the nets cut off he, ran and fetched his bag and got his cell phone out to call for help. Patting the dolphin's skin in one hand and holding the phone to his ear in another, he waited patiently. \"Come on pick up,\" he said to himself. \"Uh hi can I get a local marine aquarium in Miami out here? This is an emergency.\" Shawl said when someone picked up. \"Yes we will send someone out to you. Where are you calling from?\" the speaker asked. \"Uh a beach just by the Harrison Hotel\" Shawl said. 10 minutes later, an ambulance parked up and Shawl who had changed from his swimming shorts to his normal shorts and a sleeveless top was still staying by the Dolphin's side. A man got out and opened up the back and his team came out carrying stretchers and blankets. One of them was a young girl about Shawl's age. She had light mocha skin and blondish hair. She walked over to the Dolphin and Shawl \"Did you cut the net free?\" she asked surprise. \"Oh, uh, yeah.\" Shawl smiled. \"Wow, I'm impressed. Do you do anything like this?\" the girl asked. \"Well yeah my parents own an aquarium in Clearwater.\" Shawl said. \"That's where I am from\" \"It's a female, I think.\" One of the workers said as they examined the dolphin. \"She's very shaky\" a male worker added his input. Shawl watched them work before quietly turning away when they lifted the dolphin into their van. However he was stopped by the girl. 'My dad says I can take a few hours off after this. So you wanna go grab a drink or something?\" she asked. \"Woah\" Shawl thought to himself. He didn't he was that good looking. \"Sure okay.\" He smiled back. \"Oh I'm Hazel by the way.\" She said gazing at him as he walked off. \"Oh uh well my name is Shawl.\" Shawl replied as he walked off with his bag. Hazel watched him get on his bike and cycle to the hotel and then since she was being left off she watched her father's van drive off. 'Shawl\" she whispered to herself. \"You know, my mother's name is Hazel as well.\" Shawl said to Hazel as they sat down with smoothies at a local smoothie place. \"Oh really?\" Hazel smiled. \"Yeah, she said she was named after the eye color.\" Shawl said. \"In fact like me, she has practically lived every day of her life in the fields of marine biology. She grew up with her father and grandfather in a house boat on the dock next to our aquarium in Clearwater.\" \"Seems nice.\" Hazel replied to him. \"My mom abandoned us a few years ago.\" She said sipping her smoothie. \"Tough break, my father went through that hardship as well, he was abandoned by his father. He said that he never called, never wrote at all.\" \"My mother lost her mother when she was 7, so I only have one grandparent per parent.\" How did you grow up in Marine biology?\" she asked him. \"Well practically my mom was given ownership of the aquarium and my dad works with dolphins, including one called Winter. She lost her tail in a crab trap when my father caught her off the coast of a beach and since then he has become an expert in the fields of marine life and biology. I always help out during summer vacations and other school holidays. Do you do any of that yourself?\" he asked Hazel. \"Yea, I love working with dolphins, they're all really unique and beautiful. I even swim with them sometimes.\" \"Really nice. I always swim with dolphins in our aquarium. My parents even told me that when they were my age they always swam with Winter. Even if they were not supposed to! She's been a real tourism attraction over the years at our aquarium. You should definitely come by some day.\" Shawl smiled. \"Yeah I have heard of the place. It's like the top most visited aquarium in the state.\" Hazel said. When Shawl later got back to his hotel he saw his parents and little sister in the lobby. They were presumably dressed to go out for the night, \"Hey son, we're going out tonight and we want you to take care of Abbie for us tonight.\" \"Sure okay\" Shawl said as he took his little sister up. \"Wow you're getting heavy\" he said as he walked off, \"Bye guys.\" He turned to wave goodbye to his parents. When he got to their room he lay Abigail in her crib before walking to the restroom. When he walked in, he saw his own appearance in the mirror, he was starting to buff a little. \"Wow.\" He said to himself as he looked on examining his arms and body in the mirror. Sawyer and Hazel were eating at a local restaurant that evening. \"I couldn't help but notice that Shawl's arms are getting more muscular.\" Hazel said to her husband. \"Yeah looks pretty cool doesn't it?\" Sawyer replied. \"I think he could turn into some kind of teenage heartthrob as he gets older.\" Hazel said. \"Sure that's genetic, my cousin Kyle was quite a heartthrob when he was a teen.\" Sawyer agreed, making his wife giggle a little. 'All that swimming probably made him more complex.\" She agreed. Shawl stood in front of his mirror applying gel to his hair. It worked well for him in so many ways. \"Not bad.\" He said to himself \"I have so many looks!\" He gave his little sister a bottle before laying down and watching TV before his parents returned home later night.[Chapter 12] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 12 Twelve Chapters gone! That's crazy! So I hope you are all enjoying my stories and this one and of course keep checking for more stories as well. Also at the end I'll tell you about my YouTube. Also I have squeezed in the lyrics of a new fav song of mine into this chapter. Can you find it? ;) Few Days Later The Nelsons were preparing to leave Miami and go back to Clearwater. Shawl had told his parents about the dolphin he met and Hazel the new girl he met on that same day as well. The day before they were due to leave however, Shawl decided to visit the marine aquarium that Hazel had been from and say goodbye. He cycled towards the aquarium following the directions Hazel had given him. He parked his bike behind an ally in the aquarium and awkwardly walked towards the door. He noticed the door was open and tiptoed slightly inside. He saw a sign on the door that said \"No Entry\" but he kept walking into an empty area full of containers and large glass windows where Dolphins were seen swimming. He leaned up towards the glass and noticed a large Bottlenose swimming up top. \"Wow\" he said taking it all in. \"It's bigger than our one!\" He walked around before hearing someone from behind singing a little tune \"I got the recipe and it's called Black Magic\" the voice sang to herself. Shawl turned to run away only to bump into someone and fall down with a large container falling next to him with its contents spilling out. He got up and frantically helped the person gather up all fish and ice into the container. Once he got up and restrained himself after that he saw who he had bumped into. \"Shawl?\" Hazel asked half surprised half happy to see Shawl again. \"Uh, hey Hazel\" Shawl smiled. \"Did you come all the way over here?\" Hazel asked. \"Uh yeah I did\" Shawl said. She smile and then wrapped an arm around him in a hug \"Welcome back\" she said. \"Y'know I actually came by to see the Dolphin that I found ye\" Shawl said as they walked up the stairs. \"Oh yeah, I remember it clearly.\" Hazel said as she dropped her container in with some other containers before they walked off again. \"This is where we put our dolphin.\" Hazel said as she led Shawl to a pool with the dolphin that he found stranded on the beach. \"Hazel, who is this?\" asked a voice behind them. They turned around to find Hazel's father, a strict yet caring person Shawl could figure out by his facial expression. \"Oh this is Shawl, he found this dolphin on that beach a few days ago remember?\" Hazel smiled to her father. 'Uh hi how are you?\" Shawl greeted holding out his hand. \"I came to say hello to Hazel. We kinda went out for smoothies together that first day.\" Shawl explained. \"Where are you from?\" Hazel's father asked. \"Clearwater. My family and I were taking a holiday here.\" Shawl. \"Well, I'll lead you out so Shawl.\" Hazel said as they walked off. \"Well I came to say, that my family are heading back to Clearwater tomorrow, so I thought I would say goodbye.\" Shawl said to Hazel as they walked towards the exit behind the ally. \"Oh that's too bad, but here, you can take this card, it has my number on it.\" Hazel said dishing the card out of her pocket. They walked to the back door and Hazel stood there as Shawl prepared to go out, she then stopped him saying \"by the way\", she then gave him a kiss on his cheek. \"Hope to hear from you soon, take care kid.\" She smiled as she walked inside leaving a gobsmacked Shawl standing there, before he got on his bike and cycled home. If happiness was light, he probably wouldn't have been able to see anything. \"Big bro!\" Abigail squeaked when her older brother walked into the hotel room that the family was staying at. \"So son did you have a great cycle out there for yourself?\" Hazel asked her son giving him a hug. \"Yeah mom I did.\" Shawl smiled. \"We packed all your things in your suitcase in case you were running late.\" Sawyer mentioned to him. \"We got a long journey back to Clearwater, so we better get plenty of rest.' He said to the family. The next day the family left Miami to return to Clearwater. Throughout the four hour long journey all Shawl could seem to think about while listening to his music was how attractive he was becoming to girls. \"Is this going to be a thing with myself?\" he thought to himself. The next day The Nelsons returned to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium after their holiday. Sawyer was as usual working with Winter and the other dolphins. Hazel was working in her office and Shawl worked in the kitchen with some of the other kitchen workers. Later that night Sawyer and Hazel said that Shawl could stay the night and watch Winter during the night shift. Hazel even whispered to Sawyer about another surprise she had in store. \"Ooh looks nice.\" He giggled to Hazel as they walked out. That night Shawl lay by Winter's pool with his feet sticking in the water. \"Yano Winter, while I was away in Miami, I found a dolphin that was washed up to shore by a beach. I even saved that Dolphin and got help from a local marine aquarium out there.\" Winter made a tweety bird noise as if to say \"Good Job!\" Shawl stared up at the starry sky. He smiled to himself as he saw the stars before someone sneaked up and wrapped the arms around him in a hug, breaking him out of his looking of stars. He turned around and was shocked with who it was. \"Sarah?\" he asked surprised. \"Wow fancy seeing you here!\" he said getting up. \"I know! Man you've gotten quite tall and muscular. Have you been working out?\" She asked examining the muscles on his arms. \"Uh yeah, just water sports.\" Shawl said. \"So what are you up to here?\" Sarah asked dreamily sitting herself beside the boy of her dreams. \"My parents said I can spend the night here with Winter. You know her?\" Shawl said showing Sarah the dolphin who was swimming underwater the pool before using her rostrum to touch Shawl's feet. She then used her rostrum on Sarah's feet. \"That tickles\" Sarah giggled. \"Yeah but you can get used to it.' Shawl smiled. \"So why are you here?\" he asked her. \"Your mom and dad arranged with my parents to have come here spend the night with you!\" Sarah beamed as she rested her head on his shoulder smiling dreamily. Shawl felt uneasy with that. \"Well do you want me to get you anything? I got a whole container full of snacks.\" \"Sure okay\" Sarah smiled as he got up and made his way to the container he had put out for the night. After a while, Shawl saw that Winter wanted to have some fun with the two of them together. So he thought of an idea. \"Hey look up there!\" he pointed to the roof of the building to Sarah. Sarah turned around before Shawl pushed her straight into Winter's pool and jumped in himself. Sarah resurfaced giggling. \"What can I say, I'm a cheeky guy!\" Shawl responded. They splashed each other about and even had Winter carry them by their feet on her rostrum. Eventually they both just held onto Winter before getting out and drying off. \"Oh I forgot, I got you a little something while I was in Miami.\" Shawl said as he walked over to his bag and got out a small box and handed it to Sarah. \"A present? For me?\" Sarah asked amazed. \"Yeah. Open it.\" Shawl suggested. She opened it up to reveal a rectangle shaped box with a beautiful necklace with a heart on it. \"Oh my God, it's beautiful\" Sarah said, tears developing in her eyes. 'Here, I'll put it on for you.\" Shawl said as he took the necklace and did just that. \"It's beautiful, thanks Shawl you really are the best!\" Sarah said as she wrapped her arms around Shawl in a hug. \"Anything for you.\" He whispered to her ear. And I'll stop right there. So Yeah I was hoping to make this chapter seem longer than how I normally write on fan fiction. And I did! 3 pages this took me to write! Also PLEASE check out my YouTube channel! It is my name \"Liam Holton\". Don't forget to read and review and we'll see you in the next chapter! Byeeeeeeeeeee![Chapter 13] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 13 So, Chapter 13 and I am getting into the habit of updating every so often! Well for this one I will continue where we stepped off in Chapter 12 because I have a little surprise in store for you all! In the meantime though, check out my YouTube I have the link in my fanfiction account bio. And of course read and review this story. Here we go. After he had giving Sarah the necklace Shawl later had her sleeping on his knee peacefully. Carefully he slowly lifted her head off his knee and placed a pillow on the ground and rested her head softly on it. He then walked by Winter's pool and sat down with his feet in the water. \"Are you feeling okay?\" a voiced asked from behind. Shawl looked around puzzled. \"Who said that?\" he asked. \"I did.\" The voice then said. Shawl turned to face the doorway. A man was standing there, a man he was quite surprised to see. \"Wait, Grandpa Clay?\" he asked wide eyed. \"Yea come here you.\" Clay said approaching with his arms out. Shawl ran over and flew into his grandpa's arms. \"But I thought you were dead like a whole year ago. What happened?\" he asked surprised. \"Oh well I was facing financial crisis so I faked my own death and moved into a retirement home in Fort Lauderdale. But now my taxes have been paid and I can come out of hiding\" Clay said. \"Thought I could come around to my old place and see what's after happening.\" He said. He then saw the sleeping Sarah next to him. \"Oh who's this eh?\" Clay asked nudging his grandson. \"Oh that's Sarah, she's just a friend.\" Shawl smiled. \"She came over here tonight.\" \"Ah looks like you've had fun with her.\" Clay said. \"Yea I even gave her that necklace\" Shawl replied pointing to the necklace on her neck. \"How's Winter doing?\" Clay asked. \"Oh she's doing great. We've took great care of her and all the other animals as well.\" Shawl replied. \"Tell you what since you're out of hiding, let's play a little a surprise on the others tomorrow. You hide somewhere here and I will lead mom to here and she'll see you here!\" Shawl suggested with a grin on his face. \"Sounds like a plan!\" Clay said patting his grandson on the back. \"You might even get to see your granddaughter for the first time even!\" Shawl said. Suddenly a yawning sound came from behind them. Shawl turned around and saw that Sarah was slowly waking up. 'Well I guess I have to introduce you.\" He said to Clay. \"Wha-who's that?\" Sarah asked after she saw who was with Shawl. \"This is my grandpa Clay Haskett. He came a nice surprise out of nowhere for me so he did!\" Shawl said. \"Nice to meet you.' Clay offered his hand to Sarah. \"You too.\" Sarah said as she shook it. The next morning Shawl awoke with the light shining in his face. He rose from his sleeping bag and found his grandpa sleeping in an armchair behind him and Sarah was still sleeping in her sleeping bag as well. He then noticed Winter in her pool swimming around. So he decided to dive in for a morning swim with Winter. Winter approached him and carried his foot against her rostrum around the pool before Shawl eventually just held on to Winter from the side. \"You know I got a little surprise while I was minding you for the night. My grandfather came and surprised me.\" He said. Winter tweeted in response. Sometime later he was dried and ready for the day. He got a text from his father saying that they were on the way. He then turned around to Sarah and Clay. \"Grandpa you hide over there.\" He pointed to a large pool. \"Okay then\" Clay said as he went over to the hiding spot. Shawl and Sarah sat down by the pool and started talking about whatever came into their minds. \"Hello you two.\" Hazel said as she approached them from behind. \"Hi mom\" Shawl said. \"Hey \" Sarah said. \"Did you two have fun last night?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yea we did.\" Shawl said. \"He treated me like a princess.\" Sarah said showing them the necklace he got her. \"Aw that's gorgeous.\" Hazel said kneeling down and examining it. \"Hey mom remember how your dad used to always be up here with us?\" Shawl asked smiling. \"Of course I do. I think of him every day. Do you remember?\" Hazel said. \"Of course I do.\" Shawl said. \"What made you bring that up then?\" asked Sawyer. Shawl clapped his hands and signalled his grandpa to come out. He came out and put an arm around his grandson. \"This is one healthy kid you have raised down through the years.\" He said to his daughter. Sawyer gasped in amazement and Hazel stood still before literally shrieking with delight and falling into her father's arms. \"Oh my god. This is amazing!\" she said happily. \"I thought you were dead.\" \"Well I wasn't I did that to cover up my tax problems but who cares?\" Clay said. \"Ah Sawyer my boy.\" He approached Sawyer and shook his hand. \"Nice to see you again.\" Sawyer said. All the other workers came out to see what was happening and when they saw what it was, they were all quite surprised themselves. If happiness was light, Hazel would have blinded everyone. Later that day \"That was a really nice surprise Shawl, thanks\" Hazel hugged her son. \"You've done so much for me and well I thought I could do something nice for you in return.\" Shawl smiled. \"He gave me quite a shock when he literally came out of nowhere. I guess he came in through the back because you always forget to keep it locked!\" he giggled. \"Yeah\" Hazel giggled back. \"Tell you what, because you gave me a nice surprise that I'll let you stay another night with Winter and Sarah. How about that?\" Hazel asked her son. \"Sure sounds good.\" Shawl said. Later that night \"So I got another night with ya buddy!\" Shawl said as he held onto Winter who was swimming across her pool. Shawl smiled as he saw Winter jump up and splash into the pool. He looked up and saw a shooting star go across the sky. He saw Sarah sitting nearby and then said \"Hey Sarah you keep Winter for a little while, I'm going to go and make her a fish drink.\" He then left leaving Sarah and Winter there. Sarah watched him go dreamy eyed before she walked over to Winter. \"I've known Shawl for like a good while now. In fact I met him the day that his sister was born. My mom was in hospital getting surgery or something like that. And I had to sit outside for like hours. However Shawl started speaking to me and it changed my life like no other.\" She said to Winter. Winter tweeted in response to that. Sarah couldn't help but laugh a little. \"I really like Shawl a lot because I was bullied in school. Being the daughter of a hot TV presenter is something that most boys can get jealous of.\" She said. \"But Shawl has never even given me a hard time at all. That's what I love about him. And the fact that he is sooooooooo dreamy.\" she said as she dreamily stared in the direction he had left. Meanwhile at the Nelson's home Hazel was smiling ear to ear for the whole evening, even when she was trying to pay attention to Abigail she couldn't help herself with all the smiling. Her son had giving her a great surprise and it had made her so happy for the whole day. \"Oh little Abbie you are going to love your grandpa.\" She cooed to her daughter. Abigail burst into a fit of giggles. \"Mama!\" she said. Sawyer came home with the groceries and saw his wife smiling as she held Abbie. Hazel had then sat down on the couch to watch some TV. Sawyer then walked over and said \"Shall I bring Abigail up to bed?\" \"Yeah sure.\" Hazel said as she handed him the baby and saw him go upstairs with her. Sawyer then came down and joined his wife on the couch. \"Shawl just enjoys spending time with Winter at the aquarium. He is really starting to grasp the basics of our young life.\" Hazel said. \"Yeah, he could follow in our footsteps too.\" Sawyer replied. \"I wonder how he's getting on now anyways.\" Hazel said as they continued watching TV. Meanwhile, Shawl returned with a fish milkshake for Winter and saw that Sarah was sitting near the pool. He smiled to himself thinking \"Cute she's getting to know Winter without me.\" He then approached them and instructed Sarah to go into the water and hold Winter still. She did that and bought the dolphin over to the edge. \"Okay girl, here you go.\" Shawl said as he offered the bottle. He held it out and Winter then took it, feeding the contents out of the bottle. Shawl looked up and smiled pleasingly to Sarah. She looked very impressed. \"Wow, he really is good\" she kept thinking to herself. Shawl later lay down on the ground looking up at the stars. He certainly had great fun in the last two nights hanging with Winter and Sarah. \"It's like I am born to hang with dolphins and girls!\" he chuckled. Okay that's that for this chapter! Well what you think, nice little surprise to bring back eh? Keep Reading and Reviewing and we'll see ye in the next chapter where I'll have more surprises and such! SEE YEEEEEES! :D[Chapter 14] Dolphin Tale 2 Chapter 14 Well guys here's a little announcement before we begin; just to avoid confusion with the real movie title, I have officially decided to change the title of this story. The story's new title is called \"Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes\" as we are looking at Sawyer and Hazel's kid in this one. Just to avoid confusion with the titles :) hope you're alright with that. So in this story, we go two months later and Shawl is now involved with taking care of rookies his own age in the aquarium. But what happens when the two girls that like him meet for the first time? Time to find out! Enjoy! Featuring a brief appearance by Hope the Dolphin! Two months later Life was made even sweeter for the Clearwater Marine Aquarium. Clay had stopped by every now and then to visit during visiting hours even during working hours. Shawl was getting more experience in taking care of animals and even had time for water sports such as fly boarding and surfing. Doing those things began making him a heartthrob with the ladies, despite being only 12. One day his father and mother approached him with some good news, \"Son, we have decided to open up a rookie training course for trainees students in school. We want you to be their leader, you do have excellent leadership skills.\" Sawyer said. \"Oh really? Cool! What do I do?\" Shawl said taking a leaflet and looking at the information. \"Well we invite some young kids with similar interests in marine biology, and you be the one that trains them. Great opportunity even to make new friends\" Hazel stated. \"Sure, I'm up for it. Should be challenging!\" Shawl said. \"We've already posted about it on our webpages for international interest and sent leaflets into the local areas.\" Sawyer said. About two weeks later, Shawl was ready to start his new job. The aquarium had gotten a HUGE interest in the new programme that website downloads crashed their server. Kids came from all around America and even some flew in from Australia to come do the programme. Sarah even signed into the programme to spend more time with Shawl, however on the first day Shawl made a sudden discovery, he was going to fetch some equipment when he bumped into someone. When he turned around, his mouth flew open with shock, \"Wait aren't you that Hazel girl from Miami?\" \"I certainly am!\" Hazel said pinching his cheek. \"My look at you, you've gotten even more handsome then when I first met you.\" She smiled. \"Well nice to see you again.\" Shawl said \"if you're here for the programme then go on over with the other rookies and I will be over in a few minutes.\" Shawl informed her. As soon as he got to the other side of that area, he let out a huge breath \"What if Hazel and Sarah meet? It's gonna become a battle to see who gets me!\" he feared. \"Never mind that though, time to get started\" he said checking a clock on the wall. Once he got outside to where all the new kids were, he stood in front of the group ready to point things out. \"Okay, so hello everybody, and welcome to this the first of a fun 6 weeks training programme for young guys and girls like ourselves to experience aquarium work and marine biology. I'm your leader my name is Shawl Nelson and my parents Sawyer and Hazel run this place.\" He informed the kids. He noticed most of the girls staring at him so dreamy eyed. \"So right this way then guys.\" He instructed everyone to follow him. He took them on a tour of the aquarium to show them the surroundings. \"Okay so this is our main aquarium area, this is where all the visitors visit and look into the large glass windows and small tanks. That skeleton has been a huge attraction as well.\" He pointed up to the large skull of a large fish. He then lead them to the rooftop areas and over to a few pools. \"So these are the pools where we keep our dolphins and otter and turtles et cetra et cetra.\" \"Oh that's Hope over in this one, she's a really cute little one.\" He then spotted Hope swimming in her pool. The kids all went \"Awww\" as they saw her swimming about. 'So now for a big fun finale, meet Winter our biggest attraction!\" Shawl led the group to Winter's pool and she was swimming around with her prosthetic tail. \"Feel free to take a few pictures if you like.\" He then instructed. After he was done with the tour he led his group outside and formed them in a circle. \"So how about we all get to know each other eh? You can come forward and give me your name and where you come from. How about yourself there.\" He pointed to a shy young boy with brown flat hair. He approached and said \"Well my name's Shawn and I come from Seattle, Washington.\" \"Okay and what got you interested in marine biology Shawn?\" Shawl asked trying to spark interest with the group. \"Well my uncle owns a pet store and I love the fish.\" Shawn replied. \"Very nice.\" Shawl said. \"Okay who's next? How about you?\" He pointed to a girl with black hair in a ponytail. The girl stood up and said \"well my name is Dana and I come from Sydney, Australia. I love the outdoors and I live near the beach on Sydney's north coast.\" Dana said. \"Very nice, your outdoorsy type can be very beneficial in this group.\" Shawl said, \"Okay then what about you sitting next to me?\" he asked the kid next to him, a young lad with floppy hair. \"Uh well I'm Gary, I come from Minnesota and my parents own an aquarium out there like yours.\" Gary said. \"Cool, something in common.\" Shawl grinned to him. However he then decided to ask Hazel from Miami to introduce herself, fearing this could have been a cheesy flirty move. \"Well I'm Hazel Jones, I'm from Miami and I actually met Shawl a couple of months back when he took a vacation to Miami. He's a very nice guy.\" Hazel said to the group. Shawl found himself being stared at by the others. \"Uh well that is true.\" He said nervously \"so, moving on then\" He then pointed to Sarah, \"Well you can introduce yourself now,\" he said also looking nervous about this one. \"I'm Sarah Sinclair, I live here in Clearwater, and Shawl is my friend. He's really cool and nice.\" She said to the gang. Shawl was thankful that she didn't use those dreamy terms. \"How many people do you know?\" Gary asked him. \"Just those two I hope.\" Shawl whispered back. Meanwhile Sawyer and Hazel both saw their son leading his group of kids in an activity. They smiled when they saw his leadership skills and how he handled the situations. \"Have to say, he's became his own boss.\" Hazel said to her husband. \"Yeah, I think he inherited our leadership skills. Remember back when we were his age we did that fundraiser to help Winter? A great example of us leading people.\" Sawyer replied. \"Oh I remember that clearly.\" Hazel smiled. \"We were really helpful towards everyone!\" \"Haha yeah.\" Sawyer grinned. Shawl meanwhile was watching as his rookies lifted heavy boxes and got them into the storage unit at the back. \"Very good guys, keep going.\" He instructed to them as they each came out and got more boxes to bring in. Shawl also grabbed one in order to keep busy. After an hour he was finished for the day. \"Okay guys that's a wrap for today so, I trusted you all have a beach house to share with each other right across from here. We'll see you all tomorrow.\" Shawl then said as everyone prepared to go. Hazel then tapped on his shoulder and said, \"You did an excellent job today.\" \"Um thanks.\" Shawl replied as he watched her go off. While he was putting some equipment away, Sarah sneaked up and wrapped her arms around him in a hug. \"I learned a lot today. You are one great team worker.\" She said as she hugged him tightly. \"Yes I know!\" Shawl said as he turned around to see Sarah hugging him. \"Don't forget same time tomorrow.\" He said when she let go. When he got home Shawl found his parents in the living room and his dinner had been set out for him. \"Hey mom, dad\" he replied as he entered. \"How was the first day of your camp activities?\" Sawyer asked. \"Fine. Got to know a good couple of kids who I have stuff in common with.\" Shawl said. \"Oh and remember when we were in Miami and I met a girl who has a family aquarium out there? Well she's there as well!\" Shawl said as he sat down next to them. \"So what have ye been doing all day?\" he then asked. \"We just took care of the hospital and came home waiting to hear all about your exciting day.\" Hazel replied tussling her son's hair. \"Now we have something that might seem a little bit difficult for you for tomorrow morning.\" Haze said. The next morning The other rookies were asleep in the local house that the Nelsons had rented for them. It was early in the morning and Shawl dressed in his hoodie and hat arrived at the door. He knocked two times before making his way into the house. \"Hey guys come on there's an emergency out by a beach. Come on we're doing a rescue early this morning.\" He called as he ran through several rooms waking his rookies up. The time was exactly four o'clock in the morning. So that meant that people were tiredly walking around the rooms and such. Eventually they were all in an ambulance that Sawyer was driving and Shawl instructed his dad to step on it. \"So what's going on?\" asked Bailey one of the Australian rookies. He had tanned skin and light spiky hair. \"There's a stranded Dolphin out by the beach. We're all going to rescue it.\" Shawl explained. However when they got to the beach it was revealed that it was actually an inflatable Dolphin. \"Well it's obviously a fake one guys, but it's going to teach you in case we have a future rescue.\" Sawyer explained to the confused rookies. \"Alright so my dad will explain how to rescue a beached animal and get it into the ambulance.\" Shawl instructed. Sawyer and his team of older experts then took out a stretcher and the youngsters watched and learned as the adults carefully slid it into the stretcher and carried it carefully into the ambulance. \"Okay guys, now it's your turn.\" Shawl said as the adults placed the dolphin back on the ground. \"Alright so can three of ye come to this side and another three on this side?\" Shawl instructed to the kids as they gathered around to find positions. \"Now I know the stretcher might seem heavy but still it's part of the course.\" He said as they struggled a bit with the lifting. \"Okay good work fellas.\" He said as he watched them carefully approach the ambulance and then finally helped them lift it in. \"Good job guys!\" he high fived some of the rookies and they all got into the ambulance and drove back to the aquarium. \"Good early morning workout was it fellas?\" he asked. \"Definitely!\" Bailey responded. \"I enjoyed it!\" another girl said. \"Good expect a lot more training involved!\" Shawl then reassured! Once they all got to the aquarium some of the other rookies were waiting alongside Hazel. \"Well how did it go?\" Hazel asked her husband and son when they got back. \"They enjoyed it mom.\" Shawl replied as he led his troupe back to the other rookies. \"They definitely good a good workout from it even.\" Sawyer said. \"Alright guys so today, we're going to learn a bit more about animal rescues and how we work in an aquarium. So a long day ahead get ready.\" Shawl said as he led his team to the upstairs area. \"You can see here that Cody, one of our workers, is scraping the floors and getting the pools ready. We have to make sure that the places are clean and the animals are in a safe, hygienic environment.\" He stopped his group at watching Cody mopping the floors next to a pool. He then led them downstairs to the kitchen. \"Our kitchen workers mix fish and milk together for the dolphins. I know that sound gross, my mom says it's like a chocolate milkshake for them. I call them fish milkshakes. I even remember there were loads of times when she was my age that she always forgot to put the lid on the blender and fish guts and milk flew everywhere. Eventually my dad had prevented that from happening when he ran in with the lid.\" Shawl explained amongst his laughing rookies. They found that story really funny. Meanwhile during a break the rookies were having lunch. Sarah was sitting alone by herself when Hazel from Miami approached her. \"I couldn't help but notice that you are always looking at Shawl with dreamy eyes.\" She said to him. \"Yea I am.\" Sarah said, \"Yeah, well stop it right now.\" Hazel said angrily. \"What?\" Sarah asked puzzled. \"Shawl is going to be with me and not you.\" Hazel said. \"Hah, in your dreams sister\" was Sarah's reply. \"Oh that's how you want it to go?\" Hazel said. Ooooooooooooooooh suspense! Haha keep reading and reviewing. I hope you're enjoying the story so far! We'll see what happens between Hazel and Sarah in the next chapter. Til then, LATER! :D[Chapter 15] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 15. So this is continuing from where the last chapter left off. Shawl might have a sticky situation on his hands when he finds out the consequences of girls fighting for him. Let's go! Shawl was tidying some equipment before he made his way outside. However he noticed a crowd standing around somewhere. A crowd full of all his rookies. Looking suspicious, he made his way over and moved through the crowd. When he got to the front, a girl tried to keep him back but he saw what was going on. 'Sarah! Hazel!\" He yelled in shock as he pushed past the girl that was holding him back and knelt down beside the girls who were in a very tight fight. He broke the girls apart before turning his head towards the rookies. \"What happened?\" he asked in a panic tone. \"Apparently they argued and started fighting.' The girl informed him. Shawl turned his head back to the girls who he held back with both his arms. \"What were ye fighting about?\" he asked them. \"I dunno.\" Sarah seemed to be lying. However the truth seemed to dawn upon Shawl as he stared open mouthed at both girls. He quietly got up and walked away. \"Both girls like me\" he whispered to himself as he got to a place away from where everyone else was. \"What am I going to do?\" An hour later Shawl went back to instructing his team after he was positive that the fight that happened earlier was sorted. But he still had a hard time trying to figured out what was going on between the girls. As he watched the rookies practice cleaning the poolside all he could think was who liked him better and who should he choose. He could only snap back to reality when one of the rookies slapped him in his face saying \"uh dude, we're done.\" \"Oh well, just follow me to your next task then.\" Shawl said awkwardly. When he got home that evening, he went up to his room and slumped down on his back onto his bed. \"Wow, what a day.\" He thought to himself. He then noticed something amongst his shelf. He reached out and grabbed it amongst the pile. It was the picture frame that Sarah had given him for his birthday. The picture of the two of them was still in it. He studied it for a moment before standing it on his bedside. He wondered to himself. \"How could both those girls sign up for this knowing they'd notice their similar interests in me?\" His phone then alerted a text message. It was from Sarah. \"Can you come over?\" it read. \"Oh that's a surprise.\" He said to himself. Nevertheless he changed out of his marine polo shirt and put on some jeans and a casual shirt and grabbed his bike and cycled off. Once he got to the house he knocked on the door and waited patiently. The door then opened and it was Sarah who answered it. Looking a bit shy and embarrassed she let him in. 'I wanted to tell you about what happened today. I didn't want to embarrass myself in front of everyone including you.\" She said on the verge of tears. \"Well where are your parents?\" Shawl asked. 'They're working late tonight. And I wanted to clear this up before they came back.\" They walked into the living room and sat down. \"The reason for that fight was because that Hazel girl approached me and seemed to want to be friendly with me. But she said that she wants only you. And I tried to fight back like talking like a sassy girl. But it eventually lead to us fighting. She nearly knocked me out by pulling my hair so tight.\" Sarah quivered before eventually breaking down in tears. Shawl was shocked with what he just heard, but he pulled Sarah in to his arms in a light embrace. \"Ssh, it's okay.\" He whispered trying to comfort her. Shawl had thoughts in his mind telling him he had to eventually sort out any rifts that would break out between the two of them. Sarah blushed and smiled to herself as Shawl comforted her. Meanwhile at the aquarium, Hazel was working in her office when Sawyer arrived. \"How do you think Shawl has worked with his rookies over the last few days?\" Sawyer asked. \"I'd say he's getting on real fine.' Hazel smiled. \"He's leading a group of kids his own age and that's good for him.\" Shawl was trying his best to comfort Sarah after all the stuff she told him. \"I'm sure you're just having a rough time getting know other kids.\" He said. \"I know I am.\" Sarah said. \"I just probably can't recover from the hard times I have making friends at my school.\" \"Well, my advice maybe just give yourself room to allow yourself to fit in with people. Maybe you'll start making friends with everyone else then.\" Shawl said thinking of the best advice he could give. As he walked out the door and on to his bike cycling home, he actually had an idea. When he got home, he spoke to his parents about it. \"Well what I'm thinking is, we shall have all the rookies organize their own dolphin show. Like they can have their own roles in organizing it and putting it together and everything. It's also a good way that they can get to know each other perfectly.\" Shawl explained. Sawyer and Hazel looked at each other and then told their son, \"That's not a bad idea son. You've certainly done quite a lot to make sure that those rookies get along well.\" \"Awh thanks guys!\" Shawl said as he hugged both his parents. The next day Shawl stood in front of his rookies ready to make an announcement. \"So guys, I have decided to assign you all a task that involves teamwork and getting along better.\" He said. \"It'll be a perfect chance for you all to work as a team! We're going to get you all to organize a dolphin show with the dolphins. You can have different roles to play in the organization.\" He explained. \"So are you all in?\" he then asked. The rookies then cheered and shouted to show their approval. \"Well then let's get started.\" Shawl smiled. Done this chapter now! Thanks for reading and don't forget to review![Chapter 16] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 16 Alright so picking up where we last leave off, Shawl is now attempting to get everyone in his group to work together and be a team, so that's how he's organising a dolphin show with them. Also I plan to include a lot more with Sawyer and Hazel and Abigail in this chapter. Hopefully I'll be able for that. Regardless though I hope you're enjoying the story and the chapters as they go along. The next day at the aquarium Shawl was preparing Winter's pool for the day as an early start before his rookies got up. Hope the Dolphin swam by splashing him in the face. He chuckled to himself as he got a towel and dried the water off of his face before going back to cleaning the poolside. \"You okay son?\" a voice asked behind him. Shawl turned around to see Sawyer standing there. \"Oh yeah dad I'm fine.\" Shawl said. Sawyer then sat down next to Shawl and spoke again saying \"I heard something had happened the other day. Two girls in your group got into some kind of fight or something did they?\" he asked. \"Yeah.\" Shawl replied. \"Apparently fighting about me.\" \"Why you?\" Sawyer asked. \"Well I admit to being quite the ladies' man. And all the water sports I enjoy doing and everything has made me into a heartthrob. But I didn't think I'd go as far as to have girls fighting over me.\" Shawl said with a hint of guilt in his eyes. \"Who got into a fight?\" Sawyer asked. \"Sarah, and Hazel the girl I met in Miami.\" Shawl replied. \"Both girls like really like me.\" Shawl said. \"You know something son, you can't just decide on a girl based on who likes you. Your friendship with each of them is more important than having to choose which girl to be with.\" Sawyer said to his son giving him a pat on the back. \"Yeah I know. Just the fight that happened yesterday is what's kinda making me feel bad. What if it happens again like?\" Shawl said looking as if he was about to cry. \"Well it looks like you're having a bit of a situation to deal with here. If anything happens again, then you just tell me or your mother. How about that?\" Sawyer decided. \"Yeah that's not bad. Thanks dad\" Shawl smiled. Later that day Shawl observed his friends as they were cleaning a large pool. It had definitely needed cleaning. He then went in and offered some help. Hazel the girl from Miami came up to him. \"Can you help me with something?\" she asked. \"Sure okay what do you need?\" Shawl said as he walked over. Nearby Sarah was starting to feel slightly jealous. She looked over trying to keep cool as she saw Shawl assisting to Hazel. She got slightly jealous and turned away when Shawl held his hand out to help as well. Bailey, one of the rookies who was from Australia, noticed her face. \"What's wrong with you? You seem angry about something.\" He said. Sarah didn't know what to say. The next day. Shawl was in the staff room on his phone when his mother walked over and sat next him. \"Dad told me all those stuff you discussed the other day.\" Hazel said taking his gaze away from his phone. \"Oh really?\" Shawl asked. \"Yes. Seems as if it's speed dating for you too.\" Hazel said. \"I know. Plus after that one fight I think there could be a lot more and I don't know what to do anymore mom. I know all about girls, like I'm attractive at 12 years old and Sarah and Hazel both fell in love with me at first sight. So I'm not sure what to do.\" Shawl said looking nervous. Hazel thought for a minute and then said \"You know what. You should think of the best thing you can say to both girls. And then go up and say it to them.' \"Oh seems like a nice idea. Thanks mom. I'll do that now.\" Shawl said as he got up and left the room. However. Sarah was sitting by herself when she was approached by Hazel and group of girls she had made friends with. Sarah looked up. \"Well don't just look at me like that. Say something!\" Hazel frowned. \"Well what am I supposed to say?\" Sarah asked. \"That you're an ugly little attention seeker want to steal Shawl from me perhaps?\" Hazel asked gaining sniggering from the other girls. \"THAT'S IT! I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOU, LITTLE BITCH! GO FIND YOUR OWN MAN!' She screamed finally snapping. Standing up, she pushed Hazel hard onto the ground. Here's where all the others start running over. \"Excuse me?! How dare you said those things to my face and actually have the nerve to push me down! You're the little bitch here.\" Hazel shouted getting up and doing something to Sarah that Shawl just so happened to witness from the distance. \"What the?\" he yelled as he ran over. Sarah, now with blood all over her nose literally lunged herself at Hazel sending them both to the ground punching and slapping each other. People were chanting \"FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!\" Shawl ran over and pushed his way through the crowd to get a better view of what was going on. Hazel grabbed a hold of Sarah's hair and yanked it super hard, causing her to yell out in agony. Eventually she began getting weaker and weaker…. \"Sarah!\" Shawl yelled as he pushed past the rookies and knelt down beside Sarah who now lay unconscious on the ground. Hazel didn't stop there. She kept kicking Sarah. This made Shawl get increasingly angry. He looked up at her and then said \"Stop!\" He then turned to the others saying \"I think ye should all go and keep eating your lunch. I'll get back to ye later.\" Once the crowd was dispersed, even Hazel, Shawl grabbed Sarah's head and rested it on his lap. She was indeed out cold. Shawl was literally holding back tears as he noticed a huge clump taken out of the side of Sarah's hair. \"What's going on here?!\" Shawl said to himself. \"What will I do to try and get this to stop?\" He said to himself. And that's that for this chapter! Keep Reading and Reviewing! I know that was a bit dark but hey I'm quite the master of suspense! See ya![Chapter 17] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 17 First of all, Happy New Year! Hope you all had a great holiday season! I know I did! I even got Dolphin Tale 2 on DVD so that can add to my inspiration for more chapters in this story. Anyway I hope you're all enjoying my story so far. Keep Reading and Reviewing! An hour later, Shawl stood in the staff room feeling slightly guilty for himself. He had his rookies scrubbing and mopping Winter's pool. Of course Sarah was indeed unconscious so paramedics were called and she was taken away. Hazel approached her son as he look down at his phone. \"Shawl, I know you're gutted but your father and I have organised something that might cheer you up.\" She smiled as she patted her son on the back. \"Your father is going to take you and the kids on a boat ride out on the pier. You can look at some dolphins or something.\" \"Really? Cool!\" Shawl said cheering up a little. \"Thanks mom.\" He said as he hugged her. \"I'll go tell the others.\" Later that day Sawyer took them to the pier and onto a boat. \"Now gotta warn you all that the boat does get a little bumpy when we start hitting the waves. Seasickness might occur but at least just enjoy yourselves kids.\" The driver said. The kids were excitedly talking amongst themselves as the boat drove along the river. Shawl and a few of the kids stood at the side of the dock letting the ocean spray lightly against their faces and their hair flow in the wind. Pretty soon though, it wasn't long before some kids began getting seasick. It wasn't too much of an effect though luckily. Afterwards, Bailey approached Shawl. \"Hey man, I noticed you seem kind of down lately. Is it about what was happening with the girls?\" He asked. \"Yeah, with two girls fighting for my affection it's hard for me to get a group going here.\" Shawl said as he and Bailey walked together. \"You know what? There's a local skate park just across the street, myself and a few of the boys are going over when we're done here for the day, wanna come with? It'll take your mind off of the girls.\" Bailey suggested. \"Yeah why not?' Shawl smiled. \"I noticed Sarah was fuming with jealousy when that Hazel girl asked you to come help her with the scrubbing.\" Bailey explained. \"I asked her what was wrong she didn't say anything to me.\" A few hours later all the boys were in the skate park. Shawl was an okay skateboarder but he gave it his best. Bailey skated past him and got into a hooked grind on a ramp before flipping his board and landing on his feet before stumbling over. Everyone laughed, another rookie named Jake then skated towards a pole which he managed to skid across and jump off his board altogether. Shawl skidded across a pole. \"Good one man!\" Bailey called out. Afterwards, the boys were walking around the town. They had smoothies and were just randomly chatting and laughing. Shawl actually hanging out with boys compared to being such a ladies boy. However he noticed Kyle and Sandra in a local restaurant when he and the boys walked past. \"Kyle? Sandra?\" \"Oh hey Shawl what you up to?\" Kyle said. \"Just hanging out with some friends. I thought you would have been at the hospital by now.\" He said puzzledily. \"Hospital? Why?\" Sandra asked. \"Well it's Sarah, she got into a fight and is now unconscious.\" Shawl explained. \"What? Are you telling me that my daughter got hurt and sent to hospital and your parents didn't notify us?\" Sandra asked in shock. \"Well yeah but-\" \"Come on Kyle! Hold on honey we're coming!\" Sandra yelled as she ran past Shawl and the boys as they watched on. \"Why don't we go visit Sarah as well?\" Jaymin, one of the other Australian rookies, suggested. \"Visiting hours are probably still open.\" \"Yeah why not. Come on let's go.\" Shawl said as they walked towards the hospital. 15 Minutes later \"Weird I thought the parents would have gotten here before us.\" Bailey said as Shawl and the boys walked into the hospital parking lot. Shawl first noticed his grandmother Lorraine working out in the lobby when they walked through the door. \"Hey grandma.\" He said. \"Shawl darling how are you?\" Lorraine said putting her arms around her grandson. \"I'm good. Hey do you know where we can find Sarah Sinclair? She came here earlier today.\" Shawl said. \"Oh just take a right and go up the stairs, she's in room 25 on the first floor.' Lorraine pointed towards the direction. \"Cool thanks grandma.\" Shawl said as he and the boys walked on. The boys walked up and sat down. \"Hey this is the exact same spot.' Shawl said to himself. \"What same spot?\" Gary one of the boys asked. \"Oh well it was around last year, my little sister was born and I was sitting in this chair and Sarah was sitting in the one next to me, which Jaymin is sitting in, and that's where I first met Sarah. Apparently her first look at me changed her life like no other.\" Shawl laughed with his mates. \"Can I help you boys?\" a nurse asked as she passed by. \"Oh we're just wanting to see if we can visit in Room 25.\" \"Oh yeah, visiting hours are still open so go ahead.\" The nurse smiled. They all walked in. It was sorry sight to see. Sarah was still out cold on the bed. \"I just hope she's alright.\" Gary said. \"Me too.\" Jaymin agreed. 'I notice that clump of hair that Hazel pulled off of her during the fight is growing back at a nice rate.\" Bailey said. The other walked around. \"Oh yeah it is.\" Shawn agreed. \"Let's just hope for the best I suppose guys.\" Shawl replied. The doors flew open and both Kyle and Sandra ran in. Sandra got by her daughter's bedside and wept. However she looked up and noticed the curly haired Jaymin standing next to her. \"Weren't you just-\" \"I know\" replied Jaymin. \"We got here before you guys did. We only walked 15 minutes and ye guys drove for like 20 minutes.\" Shawl said. \"We'll just leave you guys to it so.\" Shawl then said as he led his friends out. After that Shawl arrived home where Sawyer and Hazel were waiting. \"So how did you get on with the boys?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yeah I did real well. We went skateboarding. And we even saw Kyle and Sandra in a local restaurant. You guys didn't tell them about what happened to Sarah.\" Shawl explained. \"Ah sure I guess we forgot to. We were terribly busy like.\" Hazel said. \"So anything you learned from this experience?\" \"Well I did learn that if you feel down about a girl, nothing makes you feel better than a day out with the boys.' Shawl smiled before he headed upstairs. And that's that for this chapter. Thanks for reading and keep reviewing. Thanks guys![Chapter 18] Dolphin Tale through our son's eyes Chapter 18 So I was watching a kid's movie a little while back, it was called \"Little Giants\". Ever seen that? Let me know in the reviews. And in the movie there was a little scene as what I described as a cute little adolescent moment between a boy and a girl. I decided to try and include a scene similar to that in this chapter. Anyways enjoy it. Few Days later. Sawyer watched as Shawl was playing some football with his rookies on a patch of green outside their house, the rookies were staying over at Shawl's tonight, yep even the girls. Hazel was inside the kitchen getting ready to do the dishes, only though just as she took her ring off and washed her hands, a cried could be heard. Sawyer came over with two plates in his hands. \"I'll do the dishes.\" He said as Hazel struggled to choose between Abigail crying or doing the dishes. \"You did them last night.\" Hazel said. \"For you, I'd do dishes every night.\" Sawyer smiled. Hazel patted her husband on the back before walking upstairs. \"That way I don't have to change the baby.\" Sawyer said to himself as soon as he was positive that Hazel was out of earshot. Shawl entered the kitchen to get a box of ice creams from the freezer. \"You doing the dishes dad?\" He asked. \"Yep, you guys certainly made a lot of mess eating that pizza. Especially Jeremy, he might want a desert menu.\" Sawyer chuckled with his son. Shawl chuckled back before turning around, but he then turned back to his dad and asked \"So any more information on what's up on Sarah's condition at the hospital?\" \"Well Sandra has been keeping us on track. She's been really upset, she had to take a few days off of her news night slot to be by her daughter's bedside. Kyle joked with me that he considered telling the production crew to have her broadcast the news from the hospital.\" Sawyer said with a chuckle. \"Well I mean really, it's been like three days or something since the incident, thought she would have been well better by now.\" Shawl said. \"Well son it's not like animals being treated in an aquarium.\" Sawyer said. \"She'll get better in her own time. In the meantime you might wanna get those ice pops out to the others before they melt.\" \"See ya dad.\" Shawl said as he went out with the pops. Hazel came down carrying Abigail and her doll. \"She just dropped her dolly.\" Hazel notified Sawyer as she entered. Outside, Shawl went out and shared his ice lollies to his friends. He however noticed something amongst his friends. \"Anyone know where Hazel is?\" he asked. Bailey spoke \"I saw her walking into those woods behind them tall trees.\" He pointed to the tall trees behind Shawl's house. \"I'll go find her. Keep kicking the ball fellas.\" Shawl said as he walked into the woods. \"5-a side lads?\" Bailey said as he pipped up the American football. In the forest on a nearby lake, a couple were in a small row boat locked in a tight kissing session. On the shore on the side of the lake, Hazel sat on an upside down wooden row boat watching. Shawl walked over and spotted her. He walked up behind her and put his hands on her face. \"Guess who.\" He said as he jumped over, \"Who?\" Hazel asked. \"Me.\" Shawl said as he removed his hands and sat down beside her. \"Oh that's disgusting.\" He said with a grossed-out face as he saw the kissing couple. \"Yeah they're doing it all wrong.\" Hazel agreed. \"You have to move your head dramatic like Kevin Costner in Robin Hood. Like this.\" She said as she demonstrated on her hand. \"No way.\" Shawl said. \"In the movies they do that chicken pecking, half mouth open thing, like this.\" Shawl said as he demonstrated on his hand. \"No way\" Hazel disagreed and laughed. \"Guess this, a local friend of mine from school told me that she and her boyfriend use their tongues.\" Shawl then said. \"Oh that's disgusting.\" Hazel agreed, \"I know. Spit Swappers.\" Shawl said. \"Yeah kinda like them.\" Hazel said as she pointed to the couple on the boat. \"Tonsil Hockey.\" Shawl laughed. \"You know the only problem with kissing your own hand is?\" Hazel asked looking down. \"What?\" Shawl asked. \"It doesn't kiss back.\" Hazel answered. 'You wanna learn how to kiss?\" asked Shawl in shock. \"I didn't say that!\" Hazel defended, \"Why do you?\" She asked Shawl. \"No. Ew I just got that vomit tasted in my mouth.\" He said to himself looking grossed out. \"Hey. We're all gonna have to learn sooner or later.\" Hazel stated. \"I mean if you wanna have kids and get a job.\" She awkwardly finished. \"You can't have kids without kissing.\" Shawl stated. \"Yeah, but you can't get a job.\" Hazel defended. \"Well, become a teacher.\" Shawl suggested. \"But what if we were forced to?\" Hazel asked. \"Wouldn't it be good to learn with a friend? You know, for scientific purposes.\" She said as she pushed herself towards Shawl a little. She leaned too far against him that Shawl fell off of the upside down boat onto the ground on his back. \"No way!\" He said as he got up and sat back down. \"Look, if I had to learn how to kiss and I mean absolutely positively, no matter what, no way out of it, can't get out of it, had to learn how to kiss\" he started before awkwardly finishing. \"Then I think I wanna learn with-\" \"Let me guess.\" Hazel cut him off. \"Sarah?\" \"I don't know.\" Shawl said awkwardly. \"But if not her, then definitely another boy-crazy type, right?\" Hazel asked. 'Wow this is really weird. I don't know.\" Shawl said as he got up and walked off. \"Hey Shawl?\" Hazel called him over again. \"I bet if I was one of those boy-crazy type then you'd wanna learn with me.\" \"But you're not.\" Shawl grinned at her. \"You're different, you're cool, you're the Icebox.\" He said, \"Like come on, you're probably the only girl that I've met that can beat up my dad.\" He said with his arms folded. \"Anyways I'll see you later.\" He smiled before walking off. Hazel turned around and blushed to herself before squealing. \"Well did you find her?\" Jaymin asked when Shawl approached them. \"Yeah, she's just taking some fresh air.\" Shawl said. \"Why did she go over to the woods?\" Shawn asked. \"I dunno.\" Shawl said suspiciously. \"I suppose since she was the one who was fighting with Sarah over the last few days, maybe she's feeling guilty or something.\" Gary said as he walked over with the football. \"Or maybe she's homesick.\" Jaymin stated. \"How? She only lives like four hours away.\" Shawl stated. Sawyer came out. \"You kids okay?\" he asked as he sat by them. \"Yeah we're fine.\" Bailey replied. Sawyer took a head count of all the kids even the ones who were still playing around. \"I think one of ye is missing.\" He said. \"Yeah, I found Hazel in that forest right behind our house.\" Shawl replied. \"She'll come back anytime I guess.\" \"Anyways you guys wanna go get her, I'll bring ye all out to the mall, for a few hours?\" Sawyer decided. Later that evening, Sawyer sat in the dining area of an arcade while Shawl and the others were playing in the arcade. He chuckled to himself as he overheard Shawl and his friends chattering about as they played various arcade games. \"Oh hey Sawyer\" a voice said. Sawyer looked up from the paper he was reading to see his cousin Kyle. \"Oh hey man!\" Sawyer said as he let him sit down. \"How you keeping?\" Kyle asked. \"Good. Shawl's just playing some games with his mates.\" Sawyer said. \"So how's things with you guys. I know things have been difficult the last few days.\" He continued as he put down his paper. \"Yeah no word from Sandra yet about Sarah's condition. She's been fighting for three days straight.\" Kyle said. \"What actually happened do you know?\" \"Well Shawl said that she and some other girl started fighting for his affection.\" Shawl spoke to me and Hazel the first time around and we both told him just to talk to the girls and try to avoid the fights.\" Sawyer explained. \"However just when he was going to find them and talk to them he saw the girls in their second fight. And the other girl grabbed her hair and yanked it so hard that Sarah actually passed out on the ground. A huge clump of hair was even taking out of her head.\" Sawyer explained. \"We called paramedics they took her away that afternoon.\" \"Sandra and I were in a restaurant that evening.\" Kyle said. \"Shawl and some of the boys came by and told us. We didn't know so we had to leave the restaurant and head to the hospital. And Sandra's been there ever since.\" \"Shawl is really feeling bad about how he got both girls to end up in the fights, yet he's considering both of them as friends.\" Sawyer said. \"Well I remember Shawl once said something that flattered Sarah so much that she was crying of happiness for quite a long time.\" Kyle said. \"The reason she loves Shawl that much is because, most other boys in her school give her hard times. She was even bullied. Then on the same day that Abigail your daughter was born, Sandra had surgery. I was busy at work and our babysitter was out so Sarah had to go to the hospital. That's where she met Shawl. And when I came and picked her up and she couldn't stop talking about the boy throughout the whole car ride home.\" Kyle laughed with Sawyer. \"Young love I suppose huh man?\" Sawyer said. Shawl was playing a basketball arcade game with his mates. He scored a good few baskets into the net. \"Wow that's real good man! You ever play any basketball?\" Gary said. \"Ah little bit.\" Shawl said. \"I'm no Lebron James or anything like that.\" \"Here I'll try.\" Gary said. He threw the ball into the shot clear and square. 'Huh you must be a good player yourself.\" Shawl said. Later that night Shawl and the boys were in his room, still awake. They were playing some Xbox. Bailey had bought over his GTA V game. They watched as he sped his car along the street and have his character get out before the car sped off and an explosion was seen in the distance. \"Boom!\" Bailey yelled amongst the others who were laughing and cheering. Well that's it for this chapter! I thought I did quite longer then how I normally write a chapter. Anyways ready and review! :D[Chapter 19] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 19. So Chapter 19, and uh yeah. LOL. Hope your enjoying. This time I think I'm gonna start breaking few boundaries in this one ;) The next day At the hospital, Shawl approached Hazel. He found out she was actually feeling really bad for hurting Sarah. So he wanted to make it up to her. \"Hey Hazel, I know you felt really bad for hurting Sarah. But I'm not angry. In fact, I wanted to make it up to you. Here.\" He said as he handed her a box. \"You got me something? Awh you shouldn't have.\" Hazel said surprised. \"But I did, go on open it.\" Shawl said. It was a necklace, like how Shawl had given one to Sarah a while back. \"Awh it's beautiful, I love it.\" She said flattered. \"Here I'll put it on.\" Shawl said. \"Why did you do this?\" Hazel asked. \"Well you like me a lot so I thought I'd give you one piece of generosity towards you.\" Shawl said. Later that day Sawyer and Hazel took the kids to the hospital. Shawl, Bailey and Jaymin were hanging around and chatting when they were accidentally mistaken for young students and dragged into uniforms. They were determined to get out of this so they snuck away from the group they were dragged into. However they spotted Kyle and try run away before Kyle saw them and said \"Hey guys would you mind taking a look at my daughter?\" He took them in where they had to try and hide their faces from a nurse that was in the room. Luckily though they were wearing masks. As soon as the nurse, Kyle and Sandra left, the boys unmasked themselves and took off the uniforms. \"That was close.\" Shawl said with a sigh of relief. \"Yeah but we can't get out. As long as that nurse is probably still out there.\" Jaymin said. \"Yeah you're right.\" Shawl said. \"Well at least since we're in here with a friend, least we can do is try.\" Bailey suggested. \"Except one problem idiot, we're not trained paramedics!\" Shawl said. \"Then what we just gonna stay in here and hide until a doctor comes in and sneak out?\" Bailey asked. He walked over to the bedside. \"Come on wake up would ya?\" He said. \"Okay don't panic, let's look for something that might help.\" Jaymin suggested. 'Ok\" the boys said as they scurried around trying to look for something. Outside Sawyer and Hazel sat down next to Kyle and Sandra. \"Have you guys seen Shawl and two other guys from the group? I think they disappeared.\" Hazel asked them. \"No. Don't think so.\" Sandra said. Kyle spoke \"Doctors say it could be another while or so before Sarah awakens. Luckily it's not an official coma, she's just taking time out. That's what doctors told us.\" In the room, Bailey spotted a defibrillator. \"Hey we can actually use this!\" He said. \"If we press it against her chest, she'll come through!\" \"Here I'll try it.\" Jaymin said. He took the two black paddles and walked over. He pressed them against Sarah's chest. Nothing happened. He tried again. \"Is it turned on?\" he asked. Bailey turned around to look at the machine. \"Oh no it's not. Here.\" He said as he turned on a switch. Jaymin went for it again but still nothing happened. He walked over. \"Usually these type of things work alright. What's going on?\" he asked. \"Oh look up there, the plug's not even switched on.\" Shawl said as he climbed up the table and switched on the switch. \"Try it now.\" He said. Jaymin put one of the pads to his ear. It vibrated. He tested the other one, it vibrated too. However just as he was about to go over, he accidentally put both pads together, thus zapping himself. \"Woah!\" He shrieked as he was leaped across the room and landed on top on Sarah's body. \"Jaymin!\" Shawl yelled. \"Are you okay?\" Bailey said as they both ran over. However Jaymin fell off of the bed and landed on the floor. The boys walked over to him. \"MOM? DAD? ANYONE?\" a loud voice yelled. The three of them turned around. \"Sarah, you're back!\" Bailey said. \"Bailey?\" Sarah turned around. Just then Kyle and Sandra ran in followed by Sawyer and Hazel. \"Honey you're back!\" Sandra yelled as she ran over and hugged her daughter. \"Wh-what happened?\" Sarah asked. \"You had an accident honey, but don't worry you'll be fine.\" Kyle said. \"Ho-how long have I been here?\" Sarah asked, she was dazed. \"Few days.\" Sawyer said to her. Hazel however noticed the boys standing behind Sandra. \"Oh there ye are. What are you boys doing in here?\" she asked them. \"Oh well we were in here this whole time mom.\" Shawl said, \"And we actually bought Sarah back to consciousness.\" \"How?\" Sawyer asked looking impressed. \"Long story mate.\" Bailey said. \"And it was quite painful too.\" Jaymin said as he got up and restrained himself. \"You guys did well then I suppose.\" Sandra said as she patted Shawl on the head. \"Haha yeah\" he chuckled. \"Anyways if you want to go find the others, they're at the mall, I told them to go there while we would look for ye.\" Sawyer said. \"Okay dad. Come on we go tell the others that Sarah is awake again.\" Shawl said as he and the Australians walked out. When they got to the local mall, Hazel approached them, still wearing the necklace Shawl gave her earlier that day. \"Where have you boys been?\" she asked. \"Well I think we performed a hospital miracle.\" Bailey chuckled. \"We bought Sarah back to consciousness.\" \"Well I did anyways.\" Jaymin replied. \"What? How did ye do that?\" Hazel asked puzzled. \"Jaymin, he accidentally used a defibrillator on himself and whooshed on top of Sarah, and that bought her back in like two seconds!\" Shawl giggled. \"Anyways we're all down by the main area of the shopping mall if you wanna come hang.\" Hazel said as she led them over. The rest of the kids were sitting around and chatting in a local park. Bailey walked over to the skate park that was right next to it. The others observed as he took a skateboard and started skating all around showing his skills. It made some of the girls cheer loudly as he kept going. \"Good job mate! You're really good!\" Shawl said. \"I practice about 3 hours a day or 8 on the weekends! I'm getting better!\" Bailey grinned as he came over and high fived the boys. \"You certainly push yourself to the limits!' Gary said. \"And that's what I like.\" Bailey agreed. A while later all the kids were amusing themselves in different ways. Hazel and her friend Rachel were playing tennis in a nearby tennis area. Shawl and Bailey walked over. \"Seems like a great sport, never really tried it before.\" Shawl said to them. \"Yeah me neither.\" Bailey agreed. \"Why don't we play doubles?\" Hazel suggested. \"Rachel and me versus you two.\" The boys looked at each other and nodded nervously. 'Well here we go then.\" Bailey said nervously as he and Shawl stood on one side of the court and the girls on the other. However things got complicated from there on in. Rachel proved to be quite aggressive on a tennis court. She hit her ball so hard that it went speeding past Shawl and he didn't have enough time to catch it. One even hit him in the head. \"Yes! I mean, Sorry.\" Rachel changed her attitude when she saw Hazel looking at her in puzzlement. They kept on going. Even Bailey couldn't get one. He tried but ended up hitting Shawl in the arm with his racket, and then both boys even tried to get the same ball but they bumped into each other and fell down. Rachel then hit another ball so hard that it hit Bailey in the groin. \"Ooh!\" he yelled in pain. Shawl then hit his ball and it went towards Rachel who hit it back so hard that it went up in the air. \"I got it!\" Shawl said as he tried to lunge forward to hit it. But he ended up falling over the net and got hit in the face with the ball. Both Hazel and Bailey came and helped him up. \"So have either of you guys actually played tennis before?\" Hazel then asked. \"Well uh yeah. I used to like tetherball. It's not exactly the same thing.\" Shawl said silently as Hazel laughed a little. \"Maybe I can teach how to play sometime.\" She suggested. \"Uh yeah. I'd like that.\" Shawl smiled. Shawl then got a text from his mother. 'Bring everyone home, we have a little surprise for you all\" it read. \"So my parents want us all to go back to my place. They have something for us.\" He said to the others. \"Come on let's round em up.\" When they got to his house, Shawl found his parents in the kitchen. \"What did you need?\" he asked. \"Go on up to your hangout room. We've a little surprise for you all.\" Hazel smiled. \"Okay come on guys.' Shawl said as he went upstairs followed by everyone else. They went into his hangout room where on his sofa, there was his laptop with a small memory stick. It read \"Please play me.\" Shawl plugged it in, and the video clip included many clips of everyone's parents. The first one featured two parents and a little girl near the beach in sunny Gold Coast, Australia. \"Hi Bailey. It's your family here. We hope you are having the time of your life and we can't wait to hear about it when you come home\" his mother said. Bailey smiled to himself as he watched the clip, the next clip then featured Gary's parents and his younger brother and sister, \"Hi Gary, we're all really excited to hear about your adventure when you get home. Be safe darling.\" All the clips of family and friends were making everyone either laugh or cry. It was all too emotional for everyone. However just at the very end, another clip was shown, this time of Sarah. \"Hey guys, this is me here. I've just been released from hospital and I hope to come back and be with you all soon enough. Take care.\" She smiled and waved at the camera. \"Aww\" everyone said. \"Glad that she's feeling better.\" Rachel said. \"I am too\" a voice said from behind them. They all turned around. Sarah was standing there at the doorway. \"Hi.\" She said. Following that, everyone went all surprised and rose out of their chairs and crowded around her in a big hug. Even Shawl and the boys crowded around her. It was nice to have their friend back. \"I missed you all!\" Sarah said as everyone hugged her. 'So did we girl.' Bailey said as they all let go. \"You look a lot better too!\" Shawl said. \"Also, I'm sorry I flew on top of you, which was an accident.\" Jaymin chuckled to her. \"You have to admit though that was pretty funny!\" Shawl said as he patted him on the back. Later that evening, everyone was sitting around the table eating bowls of ice cream and just talking. Shawl suggested that they would have the ice cream to celebrate Sarah being back with them. Afterwards they were all outside playing. Sarah was sitting nearby when Hazel approached her. Sarah felt slightly scared but Hazel said \"Can I talk to you?\" \"Uh okay?\" Sarah said. \"Look I know you're scared of me now for getting into fights with you, but I just want to say that, I'm sorry okay. I'm sorry I fought you.\" Sarah was shocked at this one, she felt a tear coming to her eye. \"Well I'm sorry too. I'm sorry I even pushed you.\" She said. \"It's Okay. We friends?\" She asked. \"Yeah, we're friends.\" Sarah said. They both then shared a hug. \"Hey we see hugging.\" A voice said behind them. They turned around and saw Shawl and Bailey standing there. \"So do we like each other again?\" Bailey asked. The girls both laughed. \"At least ye made up. Don't fight over me, I'm just not ready for relationships yet.\" Shawl said as he sat by them and patted them both on the shoulders. \"Come on, my mom's serving cake.\" Wow this took me three days. Probably because I wanted to make it longer than I normally do. Anyways read and review![Chapter 20] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 20 Well 20 th chapter! How cool. And also you might have seen in the last few chapters, Shawl and Bailey of course become best friends. And Sarah's back but I won't include her in Shawl's adventures for a little while. Anyways enjoy. The next day Sawyer had everyone gathered in the downstairs area for a small meeting before the day began. \"So you've all been here less than 2 weeks now kids.\" He began. \"And I want to say that I find your progress going really well. My son has told me great things about you all and how you were able to help him carry out tasks and such.\" He explained. \"So we've actually decided to send out reports to your families just to notify them. Any questions?\" Shawn held up his hand. \"What do the reports tell our parents?\" \"Just how you're getting on that's all.\" Sawyer explained to them. Later that day Sawyer asked Shawl and the two Australian kids Jaymin and Dana to help him. \"So guys what we are going to do is return some turtles who are better to the ocean. \" He explained. The kids stood by a pool that had a few turtles swimming in it. \"Okay so the process is simple we're going to try and lift them straight out of the pod and into a basin.\" Shawl said. They then attempted to lift them out. \"Careful now guys.\" Sawyer said as he carried one out and placed it in a box. Jaymin then leaned into grab one, in fact he leaned in too far that he nearly fell in. Luckily he didn't. They eventually had all the turtles sorted out. \"Good job guys.\" Sawyer smiled. \"It was hard.\" Dana said. Afterwards they went to a local pier and onto a boat. \"So this is where we're going to let the turtles go back into the ocean now.\" Sawyer explained. \"The three of you are going to float in the ocean and I'll handle you one each. Then you return it to the water.\" He explained. Once all three were in the water, using snorkels of course, he then got the box of turtles ready. \"You all set?\" he asked them. Shawl gave him a thumbs up. \"Yes dad!\" he said. \"Okay then here we go.\" Sawyer said as he took out a turtle and handed it to one of the kids. The kids all watched as the turtles swam lightly underwater. Later that day Shawl was cleaning the pool side to Winter's pool. It was late and most of the others had gone home. When he wasn't looking he got splashed by Winter. \"Hey, what you doing?\" he asked as he turned around. Winter made a dolphin sound in response. Shawl went to get a towel to dry off his back but Winter splashed him again. \"Hey, can you stop that?\" he asked turning around. Winter seemed to make a noise that sounded like a laugh. Shawl got close this time holding out the rubber duck that Winter enjoyed. \"You want this?\" he asked holding it up. Winter went for it and tugged it so tight that Shawl went splashing in as well. When he resurfaced, he saw Winter up close to him. \"Wow this must be like how my parents did it when they were my age.\" He chuckled. \"You wanna play?\" he asked. He was pulled across the water by Winter's rostrum connecting to his foot. He even held onto Winter's fluke as she swam alongside. After a while he was just simply holding onto Winter's back. \"Shawl, what you up to?\" a voice asked. He turned around it was Bailey. \"Oh hey man, I was just playing with Winter.\" Shawl responded as he got out. \"She wanted me to.\" \"What you doing here? I thought ye all went home about an hour ago.\" \"I just needed to collect my bag I forgot it.\" Bailey said. Afterwards, both boys were walking out of the hospital. \"So Jaymin was saying ye guys were sending turtles back to sea huh?\" Bailey asked. \"Yep.\" Shawl said. \"Twas good fun.\" So yeah that's it for this chapter. Also little hint, the early ending is a bit of a cliff-hanger. See yas![Chapter 21] Dophin Tale: Through our son's eye Chapter 21 So this one will pick up from where we last left off. Also Shawl and Bailey save the day in this one! Shawl and Bailey were walking back to the beach house that the rookies were staying in. They were talking as they walked. \"So you're saying that you actually caught the hang of a twisted flip after 2 weeks of skateboarding? I mostly learned it in like a month.\" Shawl said as they discussed topics about skateboarding. \"Yeah. Week after week I found myself just getting better.\" Bailey said. However just as the boys walked pass an alley, they could hear screaming. They looked over and saw that Hazel was being bullied by a bunch of older boys. 'Hazel? What's going on?\" Shawl asked as they ran over. \"These guys are hurting me!\" Hazel screamed as one of the boys pulled tightly on her hair. \"Yeah cause you wouldn't share your candies!\" One of the older boys said. \"Hey come on leave her go she's our friend.\" Shawl said angrily. The boys started laughing, \"Aw look at this little kid trying to be a hero\" an older boy said as he tussled Shawl's hair. \"Will you just leave her alone?\" Shawl asked calmly. \"Nope. Come on boys get them.\" The tall kid instructed to his mates. Two boys ran over and grabbed Shawl in their arms and were about to punch him when one of the boys was dragged away and slammed into a brick wall. Shawl looked in shock to see that it was Bailey who had done that. Bailey dug the boy's face into the wall three times before putting him flat on the ground. \"Alright who's next?\" Bailey asked with his fists clenched. A taller boy confidently strode over scoffing and was about punch Bailey, but he ducked the punch and punched the boy multiple times in the stomach until he landed in a trash can. \"Anyone else wanna finish me off?\" Bailey asked. \"Looks like it's between the two of us then now\" said the kid who was tugging Hazel's hair and the boy who had pinned Shawl to the wall. They both strode forward with their hands out, but Bailey did a backflip and jumped up to a pole on the wall above him, where he proceeded to kick both boys towards the wall. This time three of those boys were cornered, \"Here take your friend with you too.\" Bailey said as he picked up the boy that he pinned to the wall and hurled him toward them. Backing away nervously one of the boys tripped over a pole sticking in the ground which caused him to trip and fall out of a window with the other boys dragged along. The boys hollered as they fell through shattered glass and eventually pained groans were heard. \"Guess they didn't realise we were near the docks.\" Bailey smirked. Shawl and Hazel walked over. \"Bailey that was amazing! Where did you learn how to do that?\" Hazel asked in amazement. \"I work out sometimes.\" Bailey replied. \"Well you certainly gave absolutely everything in that fight. Like you're sweating, you're panting and your nose is bleeding a little.\" Shawl said. \"Well I guess we should maybe find someone to tell. Sort those pricks out once and for all.\" While they were walking away from the alley Shawl spotted his mother and little sister in the local park, Hazel was sitting on a park bench reading a magazine and Abigail was playing in the sand pit. \"Mom!\" Shawl said as he ran over with the others. \"Oh hi son\" Hazel as she looked up from her magazine and saw her son but she got worried when she saw how beat up the other Hazel was. \"What happened?\" she asked. \"Myself and Bailey were walking home and we heard screaming coming that alley down there, and Hazel was being beat up by teenagers.\" Shawl explained. \"And how did ye get out of it?\" Hazel asked. \"I fought them.\" Bailey replied. \"They are now lying on the grounds of the dock.\" \"Oh, now that is just horrible.\" Hazel said angrily. However a local police car was parked nearby and two cops were sitting down with coffees. Hazel grabbed Abigail and lead the others over to them. \"Hi, I just want to inform you both that these kids, one of them my son, had a bully issue. Could you both sort it out?\" The cops were shocked. \"Certainly ma'am, where are the culprits?\" \"Down by that dock over there.\" Bailey pointed. The bullies whom were still lying down on the ground, were restraining themselves up when the sound of a squad car pulled up. \"We've heard of your situation around bullying a bunch of kids' one of the officers said as he and his partner pulled them up. \"This'll teach ye to pick on someone your own size.\" Bailey smirked with his arms folded. Shawl and Hazel also stood with their arms folded. \"But she wouldn't-\" \"No excuses, you're all coming with us!\" snapped the policeman as he threw the four teenagers into the car. \"Thanks for informing us all about this situation ma'am.\" He said as he turned around to Hazel. \"Our pleasure, have a nice day.\" Hazel said as she held Abigail in her arms. Hazel, deciding that the kids weren't safe in the town for a while, took them home. She explained the situation to Sawyer and he was equally shocked at that. \"At least Shawl and Bailey got there in time to save Hazel from any harm.' He said. \"Shawl also told me that Bailey literally fought those kids and threw them over the docks. That seems impressive.\" Hazel explained. \"He did because they threaten to beat both boys up.\" Meanwhile the kids were crowding around Bailey saying he was a hero for beating up bullies. \"It was worth it!\" he chuckled. \"You even ducked a punch and got the guy right in the guts!\" Shawl added. \"I know, he ended up sitting in a trash can!\" chuckled Bailey. \"How could you even handle yourself like that?\" asked Jaymin. \"I work out a lot. It's good fun\" Bailey replied. \"At least you saved me. If it wasn't for you guys, I probably would have been badly hurt or something like that. Thanks for saving me guys.\" Hazel smiled at them. \"Ah sure anything for you.\" Shawl said. So I'll leave it there. Read and Review! Also yeah I admit that whole fight scene was a little crazy haahaha :D See yea![Chapter 22] Dolphin Tale: Through our son's eyes Chapter 22 So this is another chapter, I know I'm slowing down a little. I just thought I could take a week or two off of writing in order to clear the head and focus on college and stuff like that. Anyways I hope you enjoy this story, it will be a little different to normal chapters. Shawl lay on his bed one day playing his handheld computer game. Most of his friends were away on semester break and had gone back home to visit their families so he was bored with nothing to do at home for a while at least. His phone rang on the bedside next to him. Pausing his game, he lay up straight and answered it. \"Hello?\" he asked. 'Hey Shawl it's your mother here. Wanna come up for a while? Winter and Hope both look like they could use a little company.\" \"Oh okay.\" Shawl said. \"I'm on my way.\" He then walked down to the garage and got his bike and cycled up toward the aquarium. Along the way he cycled past the street where Kyle and his family lived. He looked over before deciding to have a wander into the street. He approached the house that Kyle and his family lived in and slowly got off his bike and bent it behind a wall so that no one would see it. He climbed over the fence and crawled slowly toward the window. He then peeked his head up slowly to see that no-one was in the living room. Both cars were gone so that meant no-one could have been home. Grinning sneakily he approached the doorbell and struck it before rushing at top speed and jumping over the fence and ducking behind it. He stuck his head at the side of the gate to see the result. After two minutes, the door opened and Sarah appeared. She looked around for a few seconds before saying \"Hmn doorbell ditchers, Crazy little pranksters\". Shawl was doing his best to keep quiet, however when he saw Sarah approaching the gate he quickly ducked back. But luckily though Sarah digged her hand into the mailbox pulling out a few letters. Following that, she quickly retreated back to the house and close the door. Shawl breathed a sigh of relief as he resurfaced and grabbed his bike. \"That was a close call. Well I may as well head over to the aquarium\" he said as he grabbed his bike. Meanwhile, in her house Sarah walked into the living room and was about to grab a magazine when she looked toward the window and saw what looked like a tassel haired teen wearing an aqua-blue t-shirt cycling past on his bike. She ran over to the window to get a better view. \"Is that Shawl?\" she asked to herself. 'Wow. He must have been the one who did the doorbell prank. He's still cute though.\" She said to herself before going back to her magazine and sitting down on the couch. Shawl got to the aquarium and parked his bike behind the building on a bike rack. He walked inside into Hazel's office. \"Hi mom' he said as he walked. \"Hey Shawl, so you're here.' \"Yeah you called saying you wanted me to spend more time with the dolphins?\" Shawl asked. \"Oh yes. Well you can make your way up there. If you have any problems speak to me.\" Hazel said. 'Okay thanks mom.\" Shawl said as he walked upstairs. He knelt by Winter's pool and the dolphin swam toward him. \"Hey buddy\" he said as he patted Winter's rostrum. \"How you feeling today?\" Winter responded with a tweety bird noise, \"Ah that's the sound my mom told me you made all the time when my parents were my age.' Shawl smiled. An hour later, Shawl was sitting down near the pool reading a magazine and keeping an eye on Winter as she swam about. Sawyer approached him and sat down next to him. \"So Shawl, your mom and I are going out for dinner tonight with Kyle and Sandra. If you want you can invite Sarah over and have her help you take care of Abigail.\" \"Sounds cool.\" Shawl said as he looked up from the magazine. \"I went over to their street earlier on and played a doorbell ditching prank on them. I got away though\" Shawl laughed. \"Ah ya little pranking rascal.\" Sawyer said as he patted his son's head. \"Anyway we're gonna be closing up for the day in a while so you wanna get your stuff ready and cycle on home?\" \"Sure okay Dad\" Shawl said. When he got home however, Shawl noticed that a large rope with a large hook on it was lying on the ground. He walked over to it and saw that it was lying on the grass above the window to his room on the roof. But the window to his room was closed. \"That's strange.\" He said. \"Ah someone must have thrown it over the fence\" he said as he took the rope into the garage and walked inside. Later that night, Sawyer and Hazel were preparing to go out. Shawl was sitting in his room playing a computer game. \"Well may as well get my wetsuit out for tomorrow as I'm gonna be busy with the dolphins.\" He said as he paused his game and walked over to his wardrobe. However just as he opened the door he was shocked to see Hazel, his friend from Miami, inside. \"Uh hello Shawl.\" She said instantly as Shawl opened the door. Shawl got such a fright that he fell back onto his bed. \"Ha-Hazel, how did you get in here?\" Shawl asked in shocked as Hazel and a younger girl of about 6 or 7 stepped out. \"Wait you must have thrown that hook over my window.\" \"Yes we did. Jenny, my little sister, and I have escaped from Miami because our father got drunk and start abusing everyone in his way. He hit me and Jenny several times with a baseball bat.\" Hazel explained shivering. \"Did you call the cops?\" Shawl asked. \"No, cause our dad is really ferocious.' Jenny said. At that point Sawyer walked in to Shawl's room. \"Hey Shawl do you have any lotion I can borr- wait are you that Hazel girl from Miami?\" He said as he saw Hazel. \"Yes.\" Hazel said shivering. \"What are you two doing here?\" he asked both girls. \"We've escaped our drunk father. He began abusing us while drunk.\" Hazel said. \"This is my little sister Jenny.\" Hazel then added. Jenny was small and had brown hair and light skin like her sister. \"Right well I'm not sure if we'll have time to deal with this but-\" \"No worries Dad leave this to me I'll sort it out. They can stay here for the night.\" Shawl said. He then turned to Hazel and said 'Sarah's also gonna be here.\" He then noticed some bad bruises on the girls. 'Wow your father must have been really physical.\" He said, \"Just look at these cuts.\" \"He hit us with baseball bats.\" Hazel said. An hour later Sawyer and Hazel left the house with Shawl and the girls and Sarah was on her way. Shawl was carefully tending to the wounds on the girls arms. \"Thanks Shawl.\" Hazel said. \"You're very helpful, and kinda cute.\" Jenny added. \"Yeah I get that a lot.\" Shawl smiled. \"It's true he does.\" Hazel said to Jenny. Just then the doorbell rang. \"One of you go that while I put the first aid kit away.\" Shawl said. Jenny went to get the door, and opened it to find Sarah standing there. She looked confused. \"Did Shawl move away?\" she asked. \"No…..\" Jenny said. \"Who are you?' \"I'm Sarah, a friend of Shawl's.\" Sarah said. \"Well he's here, come on in.\" Jenny said. \"Hazel!\" Sarah exclaimed as she ran over. \"Sarah!\" Hazel also exclaimed as they both embraced in a hug. \"Why are you here?\" Sarah asked. \"Well myself and my little sister Jenny we both escaped our drunk father, he went on a drunken rampage.\" Hazel said. \"They're gonna stay with us for a while.\" Shawl said as he entered with some coke cans. \"They said they have an auntie here in Clearwater, so they can tell her everything and spend more time with her.\" The kids then spent the night just chilling, talking, and watching DVD's and even caring for Abigail when she needed attention.[Chapter 23] Dolphin Tale Chapter 23 Wow…..It's been so long….sorry guys a lot's been happening. Just had some rough times in like college and stuff and other kind of personal stuff and I just thought I'd take a break for a while. Well I'm back now and ready to continue Shawl's adventure. To be honest now 23 chapters I should really be planning the middle half and then the end half hahaha. I'm thinking if I get past 30 chapters or so then I'm good to eventually finish off the story from past 30. So uh yeah thanks for reading this update and enjoy this chapter. Shawl was lying on the couch watching TV. There wasn't much on, so he was just flicking through the channels. He heard his sister crying upstairs. \"That'll keep me some company\" he said to himself as he walked upstairs. He walked into Abigail's room and saw her sniffling slightly. \"Hey girl, woah you're getting heavy.\" Shawl said as he lifted his sister out of her crib and carried downstairs. He was sitting on the couch and waving a teddy in Abigail's face when the parents arrived home. \"You still up?\" Sawyer asked as he put his jacket on the coat hanger. \"Yeah, didn't feel like going to sleep yet.\" Shawl said. \"But it's 11pm at night.\" Hazel said. \"Still it's only July. Not like I have school in the morning.\" Shawl said. \"Also, Abigail just wanted me to give her some attention.\" He added as he stroke the baby's cheek. \"Yeah you're doing your big brother duties perfectly my boy.\" Sawyer said as he patted his son's head. \"Anyways Shawl you might want to go upstairs and get your stuff ready for next week, the rookies are coming back from their break.\" His mom informed him. \"Sure, then I'm going to go to sleep anyways. Goodnight mom, night dad.\" Shawl said as he took Abigail upstairs. 'Brush your teeth\" Hazel called up to him. Sawyer then sat down and turned on the TV. Hazel sat next to him. \"You know earlier today he told me, he snuck up to Kyle's house and did the doorbell ditching prank. He's some messer I have to say.\" Sawyer said to his wife as she sat next to him. \"Did he get caught?\" Hazel asked. 'Well no but Kyle told me that Sarah spotted him from the window as he cycled off. Perhaps he got away with it from there.\" Sawyer laughed. \"I think he's handling himself quite well after he managed to get the girls to stop fighting for him.\" Meanwhile upstairs in his room Shawl was reading a book about Dolphins. He had loads of them so it really didn't matter which one he'd read. The next week Shawl was the poolside in the early hours of the morning. He sat there with his feet sticking in the water. He held Winter's rubber toy duck ring thingy in his hand fiddling with it slightly. He threw it in the water and within ten seconds Winter had it under her rostrum and was tugging Shawl's foot to give it back to him. \"Thanks girl\" he smiled as he patted her nose. \"Hey man!\" a voice with an Australian accent said behind him. He turned around and saw Bailey standing above him. \"Oh hey Bailey what's up!\" Shawl said as he fist pounded Bailey. \"Nothing much, just ready to start hanging out here again!\" Bailey led him out to all the other rookies who were chatting around each other. \"Well welcome back guys!\" Shawl said as everything screamed with delight to see him again. \"So come on, I'll show you all Winter.\" He led them to main area where the large windows lay on the walls. \"Don't worry she'll come by any minute now.\" Shawl said as they waited for Winter to appear. She then eventually did. Later that day, everyone was taking a break, Shawl and his friend were sitting on the pier outside the hospital. However when Shawl looked around, he noticed Rufus the pelican was looking into the water. Looking suspicion he walked over. Bailey saw him go over and ran over to join him. \"What you looking at?\" he asked. \"I don't know, this pelican is just staring into the water. My parents have told me he discovers quite a lot of strange things.\" Shawl said. \"Well there's definitely something in there. Let's have a look!\" Bailey said. They stuck there hands into the water and felt around, it was wet, hard and kinda moist. \"It must be huge.\" Shawl said as they struggled to try and get. However they eventually managed to grab hold of something and fetch it out of the water and what they saw was a big surprise. \"Wow, look at the size of this thing!\" Bailey said as they saw that they and fetched a large seal out of the water. \"Wow a seal!\" Shawl said also surprised. \"Aw look its eye is injured.\" Bailey said as he examined the injury on the seal's left eye. \"What are you guys looking at?\" another voice came over, it was Gary one of the other boys in the group. \"We've caught a seal with an injured eye. Go get my parents!\" Shawl instructed. \"Right!\" Gary said as he took off. The others saw Gary running into the aquarium and then turned to see Shawl and Bailey examining the seal as it lay down on the dock. So they all ran over to the boys. \"What is that?\" Shawn asked. \"We found this in the water. It looks hurt around its left eye. Gary is gone in to get Shawl's parents\" Bailey explained. Tell ye what I'll leave it there. OOOOOOHH Cliffhanger! Anyways I am sorry about not updating in such a long time, it just has been a difficult time for me that I didn't know what to do. But hopefully I'll have another one up next week :) See ye![Chapter 24] Dolphin Tale Chapter 24 So we're picking up from where the last one left off. In it Shawl and Bailey discovered a wounded seal out by the pier of Clearwater Marine Aquarium. So they're gonna try and take care of it in this one! The other kids ran over to see what Shawl and Bailey discovered. And they were surprised. \"Its eye infection doesn't look too good huh.\" Bailey said as he continued examining. \"What is this?\" One of the girls asked as the other kids ran over. \"It's a seal that Shawl and I just discovered.\" Bailey said. \"Looks to have a bad eye infection, might require a bit of surgery.\" He finished. Shawl stood up \"I just hope he's okay. It's not so often that animals are like this.\" He said as he stood too close to the dock. \"What is this?\" a shocked voice asked from behind. This startled Shawl so much that he shook and fell off the side of the dock and into the water with a loud splash. He resurfaced and saw some of his rookies leaning down and Bailey offered him a hand back up. \"You okay son?\" Hazel asked, \"Yes I'm okay mom.\" Shawl replied dripping wet. \"Here one of ye kids go get him a towel.\" Sawyer said turning to the rookies. \"So anyways tell us what happened here lads.\" He then turned his attention to Bailey and Shawl's discovery of the seal. \"Well Shawl and I noticed this seal in the water, and we attempted to recover it from the water and we did. Also it's got an infection in its right eye.\" Bailey explained. \"That's quite a nice thing for you two boys to do.\" Sawyer said, \"Well hopefully we can find some room for this seal in our aquarium.\" He concluded. \"Great! Thanks dad!\" Shawl said as he was handed a towel to dry off from his sudden visit into the water. Sawyer booked up a small area that they previously had the otters in the aquarium for Shawl and the gang to take care of the seal. About an hour later, Shawl and Bailey were throwing fish into the pond for the seal to catch and eat. \"Anyways my mother booked an operation for it tomorrow.\" Shawl was explaining. \"Great! Hopefully its eye will be better soon!\" Bailey said. \"Anyway, come on let's see how the girls are doing with Winter.\" Shawl suggested, his mother and the girls were taking care of the dolphin. \"Sure alright\" Bailey said. They dropped their buckets and ran up the stairs to find Winter's pool area empty except for Winter thrashing about madly. However screams could also be heard. Looking suspicious the boys went closer and saw one of the girls thrashing madly about in the water as if drowning. \"I think that's Sarah\" Bailey said in shock. \"Come on!\" Shawl said. Kicking off their shoes, both boys ran over and dived straight into the pool. Shawl took Sarah's body and swam it all the way back to the side of the pool and helped her out while Bailey kept distance between them and Winter. He then retreated and joined the others on the side of the pool. Sarah was spluttering and coughing as she lay down. \"I'm not even gonna try mouth to mouth.\" Shawl said. \"Neither am I\" agreed Bailey. \"What happened anyways?\" Bailey asked he threw Shawl over a towel who handed it to Sarah. In between her spluttering and coughing, she coughed out the words: \"Myself and the rest of the girls were all helping your mother take care of that mammal. They all went off looking for equipment leaving me to take care of Winter. But I didn't know what to do.\" She said as she dried herself and let her hair down from the ponytail she was wearing. \"I agree, you nearly could have gotten drowned\" Bailey said. \"Totally big mistake\" Sarah agreed. Just then Hazel and some of the girl rookies returned. \"What's going on here?\" asked Hazel when she saw the kids sitting at the side. 'You left a kid with no experience with a dolphin in a pool alone. The dolphin nearly went berserk on her.\" Shawl said. \"Very dangerous too\" Bailey added. \"Oh my God. Are you alright?\" Hazel asked \"I'm okay, thanks.\" Sarah said. \"Maybe you can come help me and Bailey with Dale\" Shawl suggested. \"Dale?\" asked Hazel. \"Oh yeah, remember that time when I was eight, we had that seal with the bad flipper, we named him Chip?\" Shawl said. \"Well we decided to name this one Dale, in honour of that\" \"Oh well good.\" Hazel just replied. Sometime Later Shawl was sitting in a local diner near the aquarium with his friends on a lunch break. They were all chatting. \"Yeah so me and Bailey came up with the name Dale for the seal\" he said \"Because when I was eight we had one in the aquarium named Chip!\" \"Really cool mate!\" Jaymin said. Bailey laughed with the crowd before turning around to see a group of kids their age who seemed to be giving dirty looks at his group. He turned away not wanting to start anything and then continued with \"Oh yeah and Shawl and I actually saved Sarah from nearly drowning too!\" \"And I thank you boys both for that\" she giggled. Bailey turned and saw the group of kids rolling their eyes, and then turned around again. \"Yeah I guess.\" Shawl said as he turned around. However he and Bailey looked over and saw the other kids scowling angrily. Two of them both seemingly older then he was, then got up carrying two jugs of steaming hot coffee and walked over. Before anyone can say anything one kid walked over and poured one of the jugs of coffee over Sarah's head. She gasped and turned around in her chair. She then saw two older boys, one had blonde spikey hair and the other had shoulder length black hair. \"Oops my bad here let me help you\" the black haired kid said and he proceeded to pour his jug of coffee all over Sarah's face, barely missing her eyes. Sarah screamed and covered her eyes, Shawl and Bailey stood up angrily while the two boys laughed at Sarah's suffering. \"Excuse me boys do you mind telling us what your problem is?\" asked Bailey as he walked over and tried not to be intimidated by their height. \"Well we overheard this tramp here saying she nearly drowned and well we're like why didn't she?\" Shawl stood up while some of the girls gave Sarah some napkins as she had tears cascading down her blotchy face. \"For your information she is our friend.\" He said \"How dare you insult her. She has trouble fitting in with us, do you know how hard that is?\" he said. \"Don't care\" the blond boy said as he pushed Shawl onto the floor. Hazel stood up \"You know its people like you who make me sick, bullying and abusing my friend\" she said. \"Who are you guys anyway?\" Jaymin asked. The boys laughed and turned to Sarah \"recognize us sleazy?\" she looked up and suddenly got scared. \"Garth? Joe?\" she said in surprise. \"Damn right you little sleazy.\" Garth said. They were bullies in her school. However Shawl saw her stand up and face them angrily. 'You know what, you two fellas have made my life a living hell for God knows how many years now. You tease me so much I had recent thoughts about not going to school anymore.\" \"That is just low\" Bailey said. \"And no one that teases her regrets it one bit\" Joe said. \"Listen here you pathetic bullies. You don't want to get in the way of Bailey over there.\" Shawl said \"Whatever like we care.\" Joe replied. Sarah turned to Shawl who nodded his head at Bailey. While Garth and Joe were laughing evilly, Bailey launched forward and tapped them on the back. \"Leave them alone or your both gonna pay. \"The boys laughed even further. \"Let's teach you a little lesson,\" Joe said \"Yeah, the hard way\" Garth replied. Bailey was quick with the hands as he grabbed Joe by the arm and threw him in an arm lock and launched him towards the balcony. They were on the top floor. \"Punch him Garth\" Joe said as he struggled to get up. Garth lunged himself forward, only for Bailey to duck the punch and boxed Garth clear in the face. When Garth was taken back and dazed from the punch Bailey grabbed him by the shirt and pulled him close so they were face to face. \"By the way, her name is not Sleazy. It's Sarah.\" He then pushed him back against Joe so hard that both boys fell through the balcony, breaking the wooden railing. They screamed as they fell down below onto the ground where a waiter nearly hit them so hard that he had dropped his tray of food on top of them. Bailey looked down at the damage and laughed down to them \"and she's a good mate to us too!\" Shawl and the others joined him and laughed at the boys covered in food. \"What's going on here?\" the manager asked. \"Those boys messed up our lunch and purposely spilled coffee on one of our friends.\" Shawl said. \"Is that true?\" the manager asked the boys as they were helped up by the waiter. The look on their faces revealed everything. \"Take them out.\" The manager insisted. 'I think we should get going as well, before anyone else bothers us.\" Shawl decided. And with that the group paid for their meal and went back to the aquarium. Later that day Shawl was telling his parents about the incident. They were shocked. \"Why do you always get in danger being out in town?\" Hazel asked. \"I do not know\" Shawl said as he hugged his mother admittingly being scared. \"It's scary for a 12 year old out in the world.\" \"Is Sarah going to be okay?\" Sawyer asked. \"I hope\" Shawl said \"Even though coffee is very harmful I suppose.\" The next day Shawl and Bailey were in the aquarium working with their new seal friend Dale. \"I have to say you did well to defend yourself against those meanies the other day.\" Shawl said to Bailey. \"Yeah, you never know who might come across.' Bailey agreed. \"Hey guys\" a voice said behind them. They turned around and it was Sarah. Her face was still a bit red from the other day. \"How are you feeling?\" Shawl asked. \"I'm alright\" Sarah said, she then turned to Bailey. \"I just wanted to say thanks for getting those bullies out of our way. You did great in that fight against them\" Bailey just smiled. \"Sure what are friends for right Shawl?\" \"Yeah!\" Shawl said as he fist bumped Bailey. And I'll leave it there! Thanks for reading and keep reviewing! I haven't had a review I think since chapter 18! See yeeees! ","Summary":" Dolphin Tale Dolphin Tale 2: 19 years later. Hey this is a Dolphin Tale fanfic. Featuring your favo"},{"Movie":"Dolphin Tale","Title":"Sawyer and Hazel","Author":"Fandom-Geek17","Hyperlink":"https://www.fanfiction.net/s/10751929","Passage":"[Chapter 1] Hi! Alright, so this was a wonderful request from Dolphinsintheblue, the request was to make a fanfic about Sawyer and Hazel when they're older, in the second movie they are about 14 – 15 so in this one they'll be 18. Just note that this will have about 32 chapter and since I'm also working on my Hunger games fanfic it might take some time for the next chapter in both to be written. Anyway, I hope you will like this! Enjoy! Chapter 1 – Ice cream and confessions Sawyer's POV He threw the rubber ducky and Winter splashed away to get it, she returned a moment later with it and Hope beside her. Winter gave up her tweedy bird sound and Sawyer smiled as he patted her on the head. Hope wanted attention too, she buffed his arm with her mouth. \" Hi\" said a girls voice behind him. Sawyer turned around to see a pretty blond girl with freckles on her cheeks and a beautiful smile. \" Hi\" said Sawyer. \" Can I join in?\" \" Sure.\" Hazel sat down next to him and started patting Hope's head. Sawyer smiled at the image. \"And that will all be on the test, yes\" said his math teacher, waking him up from his daydreams. The bell rang. \"Alright. Don't forget the home work: page forty to forty-seven.\" The class started to pack their stuff. No one could do it fast enough no matter how hard they tried, it was Friday. And to that, Friday afternoon. Everyone wanted home, including Sawyer. Well, Sawyer wanted back to the CMA, and to Hazel. As he walked through the corridors he couldn't help but to think about that beautiful smile and sweet eyes who always sparkled with joy- No no no! You're only friends! Only friends! \"This is a message from principal Jordan. All seniors, please do not ignore that finals are up soon and that the deadline for applying to college is soon here. Thank you.\" There was a raspy sound and the hall was filled with chatter again. God! It was all they ever talked about. Study! Finals! College! He knew all that! He knew that he was graduating high school and hand to apply to college. He'd already done that. Though he hadn't gotten any letter yet. Sawyer tried to push it to the back of his mind as he biked away from school in the direction of the CMA. He stopped when he saw the Haskett boathouse and Hazel sitting in the crow's nest with several books in her lap. She had a wrinkle between her eyebrows as she always had nowadays when she was focused. Sawyer parked his bike and climbed up the rope ladder, she didn't notice it. Wow, she is really lost in the world of school work! \"Hey, Hazel\" Sawyer said. Hazel jumped. \"God, Sawyer don't sneak up on me!\" she said. \"I wasn't sneaking.\" \"Whatever! Knock or something.\" Sawyer quirked an eyebrow and knocked lightly on the wooden floor. \"Happy?\" \"Yes. Come on up.\" Sawyer climbed up the rest of the ladder and sat down opposite Hazel who had already gone back to doing her schoolwork. He leaned back looking at her. Her hair was pulled back in a ponytail and her lips moved slightly as she read the book. He could sit there forever. No! Knock it off! Don't be creepy! \"Sawyer shouldn't you be working too? You have finals. I may not know much about high school but I do know that finals suck.\" \"Don't worry about me. I have time.\" \"Good. Use that time.\" \"Maybe I want to spend that time with you. Wanna go and get ice cream?\" Hazel didn't look up from her books, though she smiled a little and her cheeks flushed to dark pink color. \"I'd love too. I just want to focus on this first, I'm done soon.\" \"Like I said I have time. I can wait.\" He sat back and waited for her to be done. A small part of him told him to also start with his school work, but another part of him wanted to spend time with Hazel. A third wanted to see Winter. The second part won for now. Once again, Hazel fell back into the world of homework, but it didn't last very long. \"Sawyer, I can concentrate with you sitting here watching me. Tell you what? Why don't you go inside the aquarium and see Winter and Hope and I'll be there soon?\" \"Don't take too much time\" he joked. Hazel smiled at him as he climbed down, took his bike and rode off to see the dolphins. Hazel's POV She tried to finish her school work as quickly as possible. She had a date! Okay, maybe not a date. She and Sawyer were only friends . She tried telling herself that to hide the fact that when Sawyer asked about ice cream she had gotten a strong tingle in her stomach. Hazel climbed down and went in to leave her books in her room. While she was there she took a look in the mirror. Her cheeks were slightly sun kissed by the early summer sun. Hazel let out her hair and shook her head slightly so that it fell nicely over her shoulders. A lip gloss caught her attention. It was simple and bright pink. If she wore the lip gloss it would look like she tried hard to look good and since she almost never wore make up Sawyer would probably ask why she did now. Instead she put some moisturizer on her lips, it had a natural shine to it. Hazel also decided on a pair of black sunglasses. \"Alright, here we go\" said Hazel to her mirror reflection. Hazel's grandfather sat in the living room, reading a book. \"Grandpa?\" \"Yes, Hazel?\" \"If you see dad, please tell him that Sawyer and I are out getting ice cream, would you?\" Her grandfather smiled and quirked an eyebrow. \"Getting ice cream?\" \"Yes, what's wrong with that?\" \"Oh nothing, I'll tell him. Have fun!\" He chuckled lightly to himself before going back to reading his book. Sawyer waited for her by Winter's and Hope's pool. He smiled when he saw her and Hazel felt a tingle in her stomach, which she tried but failed to ignore. Sawyer was dressed in shorts and a dark green golf shirt which suited him nicely. Hazel caught herself looking at his stomach where his slight six pack showed through. Her felt herself going red and looked down. \"Shall we go?\" he asked. Hazel nodded. She gave Winter and Hope one quick pat on the head each. They decided on Frozen yoghurt and Hazel was pleased to see that they had an easy conservation during the walk, no awkward silences. They talked about dolphins of course, Winter's next show, high school and how much Sawyer hated that place, summer break, Sawyer teased her about her habit of always mixing blueberries and white chocolate-syrup with her Frozen yoghurt. When they got there though, Hazel convinced Sawyer to try it. After they paid they selected a table outside in the glowing sun. \"Come on taste it!\" said Hazel as they sat down. \"I will, relax\" said Sawyer. And he did it. \"Hmm? Well?\" \"Okay it was rather good…\" \"Ha! I was right! I knew you'd like it.\" They fell in a comfortable silence as they ate. Hazel enjoyed the view of the town, though something was bugging her. Something she'd thought about a months and she knew that she had to do something about it soon, otherwise it would be too late. She couldn't talk to her dad about it, but maybe Sawyer. \"Sawyer, can I talk to you about something private?\" Sawyer looked up from his yoghurt, he looked uncertain. \"… Yeah\" he answered slowly. \"Yeah… Sure…\" \"Look, I… I've been homeschooled my whole life.\" \"Right.\" \"But the thing is, I want to apply to college. I want to go to school and experience that for a change.\" \"Oh… Well I think that's a good idea, have you talked to Dr. Clay about it?\" \"No, that's the problem… I don't think he would want that, I think he wants me to stay here and work at the aquarium. He won't understand.\" \"Hazel… I think he will. Every parent wants their children to go to college, you should talk to him. Do you know where you want to apply? \"No, I haven't looked that much, yet. Something with marine biology, obviously.\" Hazel understood that if she wanted to go to college anywhere she had to talk to her dad, but would he understand? She'd thought about it for a long time. But would anyone even accept a girl who's been homeschooled her entire life? And if they did, what college would she apply too? Not anything too far away, she wanted to be close to her family and the aquarium. Where would Sawyer go? Would they even stay in touch when he went away? All the thoughts in her head swirled around like a hurricane and made her even more confused. One thing she was sure of, she had to talk to her dad, soon . So this was chapter one. Please leave a review! They make me so happy, I'd love to hear your thoughts! To be continued in \"Planning\"! : )[Chapter 2] Hello! So this is chapter 2. It's a lot of dialogue and if you find that annoying I'm really sorry but it's needed for the chapter. Personally I'm quite pleased with the result to be honest. Enjoy! : ) Chapter 2 – Planning Hazel's POV Today she and Sawyer were on cleaning Winter's and Hope's pool duty. It wasn't the chore she liked best, but none of them were boring. She thought a lot about the day before. The time with Sawyer at the yoghurt bar wasn't a date. It wasn't! But a small part of her mind wanted it to be. They hadn't kissed or anything, since it wasn't a date. But still… She'd always liked Sawyer as more than a friend, though now it was more obvious than before. She looked at him as he sat on the platform and scrubbing it. His brow was slightly furrowed and his hair was hanging down in his eyes. She smiled. Sawyer looked up. \"What are you smiling at?\" Hazel looked down, embarrassed. \"I don't know…\" For a moment Sawyer looked down too but then he looked up again. \"Hazel..?\" \"Yes?\" \"About yesterday… I-?\" \"God job, guys!\" said a voice. As Hazel looked up she saw her dad looking down at them. \"Hey Hazel, can you go and help Phoebe with the animal food?\" \"But I'm not done\" answered Hazel. \"It's okay, I want to talk to Sawyer anyway.\" \"Why?\" \"Hazel, please do as I say…\" \"Fine.\" Hazel got up and walked away through the corridor and the door. Sawyer's POV Okay now he was confused. Why would Dr. Clay want to talk with him privately? Had he done something wrong? Was it about Winter? Or Hope? If it was about him and Hazel than he would talk with both of them, right? Dr. Clay took him to his office, it was messy as usual and the computer was turned on though in Stand By mode. He offered Sawyer a seat in one of the chairs and Sawyer sat down. He couldn't help but feeling worried. What if he didn't want Sawyer to be a part of the CMA anymore? No, no! That can't be it! Winter needs me! He couldn't do that, could he? \"Sawyer, we need to talk\" said Dr. Clay, leaning back in his chair, watching Sawyer. \"About what, sir?\" His heart pounded to hard he was afraid it would soon pop out of his chest. \"Hazel.\" \"Hazel?\" \"Yes, about Hazel. Now, as you probably know, it's her birthday next week.\" \"Yes, sir I know that. If you're asking what I'm getting her then trust me, unfortunately I have no idea.\" Dr. Clay laughed. \"No Sawyer this isn't about what you're getting my daughter for her birthday. But, since it's her eighteenth birthday I want to make it special. I know that she's sad that her mom won't get to see her turn eighteen and so am I, but this way it can be special anyway.\" \"What are you planning?\" \"A surprise party, on her birthday. What do you think?\" \"I… I think it's a great idea!\" \"Oh good. I've already talked to your mom, Dr. McCarthy, grandpa Haskett, Kyle and the staff and their all in for it. I've rented a place, Phoebe's friend has offered to be a DJ, your mom is going to bake some stuff, we are going to order food from a restaurant and a cake from a local bakery. But your job, Sawyer; is to be a distraction for Hazel. If I ever need to run off on an errand or something regarding the party then I need you to make sure Hazel doesn't find out why I'm going away. I think you can handle that, we both know how much Hazel likes you.\" Sawyer felt himself turning deep red and looked down in his lap. \"We both know how much Hazel likes you.\" Did she really? In that way? \"That sounds great, Dr. Clay. Perfect.\" \"Good. But Sawyer, if Hazel asked you what we were talking about, tell her you're working on a school paper about running your own company and I gave you an inside look on how I run the CMA, okay?\" \"Okay. That's a good cover.\" \"Alright. We need to keep Hazel busy on certain occasions until Friday next week, six days exactly. You can go now.\" \"Okay, have a good day, sir.\" \"You too, Sawyer. But we'll see each other for the staff meeting later.\" Dr. Clay winked at him. Sawyer smiled and went out to find Hazel. It was lunch time and he was starving. She wasn't by the pool, though when he got there his phone beeped. A text from his mom. \" Hey honey, I know that you probably want to eat lunch with the staff but since it's my day off, you want to eat at home? Bring Hazel if you want! : )\" Just then Hazel appeared. \"Hey\" she said, tucking her hair behind her ear. The image was beautiful. Sawyer smiled. \"Hey. Mom wonders if you want to eat lunch at home with us?\" \"Yeah sure! That'd be great. I'll just go and tell dad. I'll be right back.\" Sawyer texted his mom back. \" I can eat at home. Hazel comes too, we're on our way\" Thought swirled around in his head. He liked Hazel, he really did. Her beautiful face was imprinted in his no matter where he went. Every time she was close by her scent of salt water and a faint smell of summer flowers caught his breath. But did she like him back? Dr. Clay said she did, but did he mean as friend or as more than that. Would she say yes if he asked her out? Did she even find him attractive? Sawyer wanted to ask her out, but how? \"Ready to go?\" Hazel had suddenly appeared there again. Her scent made him slightly woozy. Sawyer smiled but felt embarrassed. He nodded and they walked out. \"By the way, what did you and dad talk about?\" \"Politics.\" Hazel quirked and eyebrow. Sawyer laughed. \"I'm kidding. No, see I'm writing this school paper about running your own company.\" \"Really?\" \"Yes, really. And he showed me an inside look at how he runs the CMA.\" God he hoped she bought that lie. She wasn't gullible. She sounded very doubtful. \"Alright…\" Sawyer exhaled lightly and made a mental note to not tense up so much next time he had to lie to her. They reached their bikes and hopped on. \"Let's eat\" said Sawyer as they biked off to his house for lunch. Hope you liked it! Please leave a review! I'm going to start something I call \"Simple Swedish\", since I'm a proud Swede I thought it would be fun to teach you who want to some Swedish. With every new chapter in this story I will teach you a new phrase. Simple Swedish of the chapter: Hej jag heter *fill in your name*. (Hello my name is *fill in your name*) To be continued in \"School stuff and movies\".[Chapter 3] Hello everyone! I've been sick lately but I'm better now so hopefully the chapters will come out quicker. Personally I really like this chapter and I hope you will too! : ) Chapter 3 – School stuff and movies Sawyer's POV As usual, studying at home sucked. It wasn't that he hated school but, when you're home you should just relax, not continue school work! He was working on an essay on one of Shakespeare's plays for his history class. It never really interested him, so it was hard. He couldn't give deep thoughts about Ophelia's love affair with Hamlet, the character's or let alone the plot. Then it struck him, he knew exactly who could help him now that his mother was at work. Hazel! He took his phone and called her. \" Hello?\" \"Hi, Hazel it's Sawyer.\" \" Hey, Sawyer, what's up?\" \"Listen, you're into Shakespeare, right?\" \" Sometimes, why?\" \"I'm doing this essay about 'Hamlet' and I have like now idea what to write. Can… Can you help me?\" \" Uhh… Yeah. Yeah, I'll be right over. Hang in there! Don't overload your brain, because I'll be the one doing that.\" Sawyer chuckled. \"Don't worry. I won't.\" \" Good, see you soon!\" \"See you.\" He hung up. A feeling brewed up in him. A giddy, girly feeling. He told himself it wasn't right. Get a grip, man! Don't act that way! He started running around in the house like a woozy chicken, making small changes like, making his bed, putting away some dishes and combing his hair which stood out in every place since he took a shower. Just as he ran across the hall with some dirty laundry, the doorbell rang. Sawyer instantly forgot that he hell a stack of boxers and socks in his arms and opened the door. \"Hi!\" he said. Hazel giggled. \"Hi! Are those for me?\" She pointed at the boxers. Sawyer gave himself a mental kick in the head and turned dark red. \"Oh! No! No, no, no! …They are not. Uhh… Why don't you come in and sit down in my room and I'll just put these away.\" Hazel laughed by now. \"Sure!\" She walked in and sat down at the kitchen table where Sawyer's laptop and books were spread out. Sawyer got back from the bathroom. He was still embarrassed over the fact that Hazel had seen his stack of dirty boxers. He tried to push it out of his mind and to focus on the homework about Hamlet. \"So, they only told us to write about Hamlet. They didn't say anything specific\" said Sawyer when he sat down. \"So they're probably testing you to see how well you can invest yourself in the world about Hamlet. Write something deep and emotional. You'll get an A for that\" answered Hazel. \"That's the thing, I can't write deep stuff…\" \"Well, what's the most emotional event you've ever experienced?\" Wow! He was not good at this emotional talk. He knew Hazel, and he knew that she wouldn't blabber. He trusted her, he did. But he never really spoke of his emotions. Not even to his mother. \"Uhm… When I met Winter, maybe… Yeah… When I met Winter.\" \"Okay. Those were good feelings, right?\" \"Right…\" \"You should incorporate that in the essay, but Hamlet is mostly anger and desperation. You have anything like that..?\" \"Bad memories… Well… When my dad left…\" He felt his entire body and mind sulk. Sawyer trembled slightly and he fought to keep the tears in. Hazel grabbed his hand carefully. He looked up and she smiled softly. Soon with Hazel's help he was able to finish his homework. \"Want to see what's new on Netflix, maybe?\" Sawyer asked as they moved into his room. \"We can link the laptop to my TV.\" \"That'll be great. I'll just call dad real quick and tell him I'll be staying a little later.\" \"Okay, I'm gonna go and fix the TV.\" Sawyer walked away to his room and started fidgeting with cables and stuff. He heard Hazel talking in the kitchen and a smile curled his lips as the revelation that would have to sit quite close to fit on the bed crossed his mind. He logged in just as Hazel entered the room. \"So, what should we see?\" asked Hazel as she sat down on the bed. \"What do you want to see?\" asked Sawyer back. \"I'm open to most. Just no gory horror movies!\" Sawyer chuckled. \"Nothing gory… Let's see…\" He flipped through many movies before they finally decided on a thriller from the 90's. A little old maybe but Hazel seemed pleased so Sawyer didn't argue. He had seen it before and it wasn't that bad, though Hazel apparently hadn't. \"I'll be right back\" said Sawyer. \"Don't press play yet!\" Sawyer walked out to the kitchen and started to search the pantry and soon he found what he was looking for, he put it in the microwave. Soon a popping sound filled the air and a pleasant smell filled the air. \"Do I detect popcorn?\" asked Hazel in a made up snobbish voice. Sawyer laughed. \"Yes you do, Milady\" answered Sawyer and bowed. Hazel smiled. She walked up to him and the microwave. \"Let me help. Where are the bowls?\" \"Uhh… In that cabinet over there.\" Quite soon they were seated near, really near each other on Sawyer's bed with a bowl of popcorn in Sawyer's lap and the movie had just started. Hazel seemed to enjoy it. Her expression changed in tact with the pace of the movie and she leaned into him a bit. Sawyer would never admit out loud but he really enjoyed the feeling of Hazel warm, small body slightly pressed against him. He felt himself go tired, and more tired… Lorraine's POV \"Hello?\" Lorraine called as she opened the front door and walked in. Nobody answered, but the door had been unlocked. So Sawyer had to be around somewhere, he wouldn't leave without locking the door. She thought he might be in the shower or something but she didn't hear and sound of water. She started walking around the house, looking for him. His bedroom door was barely open, she swung it open carefully and what she saw made her smile. She saw the very sweet view of her son and Hazel curled up in his bed, sleeping. Hazel's head leaned against Sawyer's shoulder and Sawyer leaned his head on top of hers. Sawyer had a bowl of popcorn in his lap which was dangerously near tipping over. She sneaked in and took the bowl and as she did, she noticed that their hands were only an inch from touching. She smiled. Just as Lorraine walked into the kitchen, her phone started to ring. \"Hello?\" she whisper-answered. \" Hi, this is Clay\" answered Clay on the other line. \"Oh hello Clay, what can I do for you?\" \" I was just wondering. Is Hazel at your place? She told me would be a few hours ago. I just want to know for sure.\" \"Yeah she's here. She and Sawyer have fallen asleep in front of the TV.\" \" Oh… Well that's sweet.\" \"It is… She can stay for dinner, if that's okay. You too if you want.\" \" Thank you, but I'm swamped with the preps for Hazel's birthday party. But of course Hazel can stay if she wants.\" \"Alright, well take care.\" \" You too, goodbye Lorraine.\" \"Bye…\" Enjoyed it? Please leave a review! To be continued in \"Party\". : )[Chapter 4] Hi everyone! So here's finally a new chapter. It's been a while but I did it. Your reviews keep me going! Thank you sooooooo much! You have no idea how happy they make me. But I'm not going to blabber all day. Enjoy! : ) Chapter 4 – Party Sawyer's POV Today was it, Sawyer told himself. Today was Hazel's birthday. Tonight Hazel's surprise party would take place. Soon, Dr Clay would text him, then he would take Hazel out somewhere so the others could set up the party. Okay Sawyer. Keep Hazel away until you hear from me again. He read the text and immediately called Hazel. \" Hey Sawyer \" said Hazel when she picked up. \" How are you?\" \"I'm great. Listen, can you meet me at Grandma Betty's Diner? I was thinking maybe we could get some lunch. My treat.\" \" Yeah okay. When?\" \"Now.\" \" Oh, well. Okay…\" \"I can pick you up and we'll take the bus?\" \" That'll be great. See you soon.\" \"See you.\" He hung up. Hazel's POV This was strange. But maybe not so strange anyway. It was her birthday after all. Maybe he wanted to take her out to celebrate just the two of them. Maybe… But something was off. Her dad hadn't even congratulated her. It wasn't that she was being selfish, but she'd at least hoped that her dad would have said something. Sawyer hadn't either. Yet… Neither had Phoebe or anybody else. They hadn't forgotten had they? Hazel dressed up in a pair of shorts and a purple tank top. She had her hair in a side braid. She sat in a chair outside the boathouse when Sawyer arrived. \"Hey!\" He said. Hazel stood up on her feet and walked up to him. \"Hi.\" He gave her a careful hug and she felt a strong tingle in her stomach. Sawyer smelled faintly of something warm and pleasant, she couldn't decide what it was. \"Shall we go?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yeah!\" They went out to the diner. Sawyer had a burger while Hazel had chicken and fries. It was a comfortable silence as they ate. But the fact that Sawyer hadn't said anything about her birthday bugged her. It wasn't like him to forget such a thing as someone's birthday. After the lunch they went for a stroll in the park. It was a beautiful sunny day, only one small cloud in sight. Sawyer insisted on taking a picture on her with the trees and sun behind her. Eventually she cave and let him take it. Everything Hazel could do was to scream to herself not to blush. \"You know, it's so delightful to see such a young couple happy. In my age you rarely get to see it, at least not when you don't have any grandchildren\" said a voice behind them. Hazel turned around to see and old woman sitting on a bench with a book in her lap. The woman looked to be about seventy-five to eighty and her smile was surprisingly bright. There were a couple of teeth missing but the joy on her face made up for it. Sawyer's POV \"We're not together\" answered Sawyer politely and then he mumbled something quietly he hoped Hazel wouldn't hear. The old woman looked startled from him to Hazel. \"It's true\" Hazel said. \"We're not.\" Though it didn't escape Sawyer that she sounded a bit disappointed when she said it. \"Oh… That's too bad. You look beautiful together\" said the old woman, gave them a last smile before returning to her book. Sawyer felt himself blush and looked down at the ground. Then at his watch. It showed 4:30 pm, so surely they had to be done with the preps soon. Hazel's POV After Sawyer answered the woman \"We're not together\" he mumbled something. He probably thought, or at least hoped that she hadn't heard it. But she did, well she was ninety percent sure she did. She could have sworn that he mumbled \"Unfortunately…\"! Sawyer's POV We're done. Get Hazel here. You know the plan. He was so happy he received the text while Hazel was in the ladies room. She was so curious and if she heard the tone she would have wanted to read it. Okay. We're on our way. \"Hey Hazel. I just remembered. Can I show you a place where my grandpa used to take me when I was younger?\" Sawyer lied. \"It's really beautiful there. You can see the whole ocean.\" \"Why not. Is it far?\" \"Not at all we can walk.\" And so they went. Not to somewhere his grandpa used to take him, but to the rented party hall for Hazel's surprised. Hazel kept looking around for the right place but looked more and more confused when they didn't reach any water. \"Come on, let's just go in here real quick\" said Sawyer when they reached the party hall. \"But it's all dark, it's probably not open\" answered Hazel, confused. \"It's alright, we know the owners\" he lied. He took a hold of Hazel's hand and opened the door. As soon as he closed it the guests screamed: \"SURPRISE!\" Hazel's POV The scream, the sudden light switch, the people, the decorations. They all startled her. It took a moment for her brain to process what was going on. A birthday party? For her? \"What's this?\" Hazel asked, half surprised, half happy. \"Happy birthday\" Sawyer answered. \"For me?\" \"For you, honey\" said Lorraine who had just come up and gave Hazel a hug. \"Happy birthday!\" \"Thanks!\" Something struck her. She didn't exactly have party clothes on. \"I'm not exactly dressed properly…\" \"We can fix that. Come with me\" Lorraine said with a mischievous grin on her face. She lead Hazel to a backroom with the door closed. \"Alright.\" Lorraine put one of her hands over Hazel's eyes so she couldn't see. Hazel heard her using the other hand to open the door. She blindly lead by Lorraine inside the room and door was closed behind her. \"Taa daa!\" Hazel could see and what she saw took her breath away. It was a dress with matching shoes. The dress was red, with a sweetheart and spaghetti straps, it was made of some flowing material sort of like chiffon. On the front it ended just above the knees but was longer in the back, there it ended just below the knees. A satin strap was bound around the waist. The shoes were in the same color, pumps with a rose on each. \"It's my present for you. Do you like it?\" Lorraine asked. \"I love it!\" Hazel screamed. \"It's so beautiful! Thank you, thank you, thank you!\" \"You're welcome, honey. Now go and change over there.\" Hazel took the dress and shoes and stepped behind a curtain to change. Lorraine smiled when she stepped out. \"You look beautiful.\" \"Thank you.\" She felt beautiful too, very beautiful. \"Just one more touch, sit down.\" Hazel sat down and Lorraine brushed her hair and did her makeup quick. \"Perfect. Look in the mirror.\" It was indeed perfect. Her hair was naturally wavy from the side braid and her makeup was simple but perfectly matched with the dress. \"Sawyer will love it\" said Lorraine quietly to her. \"What?\" Hazel tried to sound as natural as possible though failing miserably because it was just what she hoped to hear. Lorraine just smiled knowingly. \"Go on, now…\" They danced, ate, laughed, she opened presents, talked. The cake was fabulous. It tasted of blueberries and white chocolate. Hazel's favorite. Suddenly Sawyer found her in the crowd. \"Hi!\" he said. He sounded nervous. \"Hi!\" Hazel said back. \"Can you come with me for a moment?\" \"Sure!\" They walked away from the crowd, outside. There was a small garden in the back, there was also a bench. They sat down. Hazel waited for him to say something but he didn't. After a minute he took something out from his pocket and gave it to her. It was a small box in dark purple and silver gift wrap. \"Happy birthday, Hazel\" Sawyer said. \"Thank you\" Hazel answered and slowly opened the gift wrap. Inside was a black jewelry box. After she opened the lid it revealed a bracelet with oyster pearls and a silver plate in the middle. Something was graved in it. Carpe Diem \" Carpe Diem. Seize the day\" said Hazel. \"Yeah…\" Sawyer started, obviously extremely nervous. \"I- I thought that since were both going away to college, we're both going to be busy and not see each other that often. We both need to remember to have fun and not study all the time. You know, to seize the day . You only live once, right?\" \"Right. But we don't know for sure that I'm going, I've applied but I haven't even talked to my dad about it.\" \"Of course, but I also thought… Maybe it could remind you of- of me.\" Hazel smiled. She slowly leaned in and gave him a long hug. \"Thank you…\" she whispered. \"Do you wanna go in and dance with me?\" Sawyer asked. \"I'd love to\" Hazel smiled. They went in and luckily, fate had decided to play a slow song just at the right moment… Hope you liked it! I hope you aren't too disappointed that they didn't kiss, I know it was a perfect opportunity. No matter how tempting it is not to, I have to stick to my storyline. Please leave a review! To be continued in \"Hiding\". :D[Chapter 5] Hi! Thank you all so, so much for your lovely reviews, they really keep me going. I appreciate it so much that you can bear with me even though I suck at updating my stories as often as I'd like too. This is the first chapter completely in Hazel's POV. I found it quite interesting to write entirely in her POV. Anyways, enough of my babbling. Enjoy! Chapter 5 – Hiding Hazel's POV Hazel sat in her room in the boathouse. She flipped through a brochure about a college. The pictures were beautiful, it looked so perfect. By the water, deeply invested in marine biology and leading management. It was late in the evening and she should probably have gotten into bed by now but something kept her up. Usually it was thoughts of Sawyer that kept her up nowadays but for once he wasn't the reason. College was. She had applied, yes. In fact to the very college she was now flipping through. She took a sip from the cup of hot chocolate on her desk. Hazel knew that she had to talk to her dad, soon . If he found out about it when she got the letter saying if she got in, he would probably be angry. Or at least hurt that she hadn't said anything. There was a knock on the door and she quickly slipped the brochure inside a drawer, but not fast enough. It was her dad at the door. \"What's that?\" he asked, pointing towards the badly closed drawer. \"Nothing!\" Hazel answered fast. Too fast. \"Nothing, huh?\" \"Yes, nothing. Good night, dad. \"Hazel, is there something you want to talk to me about? If there is, you know you can tell me anything.\" \"I know. But there's nothing to talk about.\" \"If you say so… Good night.\" \"Good night.\" As soon as her dad had closed the door, Hazel gave herself a hard face palm. She chickened out. Why? Why!? She had her chance! Why didn't she take it. She couldn't continue chicken out like this. Not if she wanted to go away for college. Tomorrow, Hazel told herself. Tomorrow she would do it. A hard knot started to form in Hazel's stomach. What if he didn't accept what she wanted to do? What if he was angry? What if he refused to let her go? What if, what if, what if? Thoughts swirled around and made her nauseous. Slowly she got on the bed and just laid there still it passed. It didn't take very long, fortunately. Soon, Hazel fell asleep. XXX She didn't talk to her dad the next day either, she chickened out, again . The daily routine the day after that went on as usual. They ate breakfast together, Hazel, her dad and grandpa. After that her grandpa went for a bike ride while her dad went up to the aquarium to work and Hazel sat quietly in her room, doing her schoolwork. She ate lunch, continued with her school work. After she was done she went up to the aquarium too. There she helped Phoebe with some chores until Sawyer arrived. Then she would do the rest of her chores together with him. Today the first on the list was preparing the food for the otters. \"Remember how I told you I was supposed to talk to dad about college?\" Hazel asked as they prepared. \"Yes\" answered Sawyer. \"I do.\" \"Well…\" \"Don't tell me.\" \"I didn't do it…\" \"Hazel!\" \"I know! I know, it was really, really stupid of me. Time is running out and all that. You don't have to yell at me.\" \"I'm not! At least not a lot… Sorry.\" \"It's alright. I just can't do it. I can't…\" \"If our hands weren't slimy right now, I would give you reassuring pat on the shoulder or a hug or something like that. But, you know-\" \"During the circumstances I get it. Later maybe?\" She smiled at him, hopefully he would get that she was both flirting and joking. Though Sawyer wasn't the best when it came to picking up hints. Hazel thanked her lucky star for that everyday a few years ago when a volunteer named Susie worked at the aquarium. Later that year, Susie moved to a different part of Florida because of her father's job. \"Right\" Sawyer stammered out. \"But seriously, what should I do, Sawyer? I can't keep this up.\" \"Well, right now the best thing to do is probably- Hello, Dr Clay!\" Hazel turned around to see her dad standing in the doorway, he smiled. \"Dad! How long have you been standing there?\" \"Oh I just came in, I wanted to see how it's going with the otter food. How is it going?\" \"Good\" answered Sawyer. \"Yeah we're almost done.\" \"Oh good, good. When you're done, can you just help Phoebe with pool cleaning quickly? It's the big one and she's on it by her own. Then you can have the day of. It is Friday after all.\" \"Yeah, sure dad we can do that. Right, Sawyer?\" said Hazel. \"Absolutely.\" Her dad smiled at them and walked away. Hazel exhaled deeply. That was a close one! Like she said, she couldn't keep this up anymore. Sooner or later it would only end in disaster. \"See? This is why you can't keep hiding, Hazel. Just talk to your dad. Please!\" \"I will I promise.\" \"Super-promise?\" \"Super-promise!\" XXX After she and Sawyer were done helping Phoebe with the pool they decided to go for a walk along the beach. That would have been perfect if they only were a couple. Unfortunately they weren't. Only in Hazel's dreams. Hopefully they would be in the future. Hazel just hoped that he felt the same way about her as she did about him. God, she hoped. But she couldn't think about that now, but she wanted too. Just for a moment she decided to escape reality. \"You know, you still owe me that hug\" said Hazel with a playful smile on her face. \"I do, don't I?\" answered Sawyer. He slowly leaned in and gave her that hug. Hazel felt all warm inside. Even though he was quite skinny he was big enough to cover her with his body and it made her feel so safe in his arms, very romantic. \"It's going to be okay, you know. You can tell him and he will understand. You'll see…\" Hope you liked it. Maybe some of you are wondering why this story lack appearance of Winter and Hope. I want to focus heavily on the Sawyer/Hazel relationship because we don't get to see much in the movies. But if you miss them don't worry. The next chapter will almost be all about them. : ) Btw, Tanya1015 said something that I found very interesting. She said she didn't know the ship name for Sawyer and Hazel and come think of it. Neither do I… If anyone does, please leave a review and tell everyone out there who doesn't. Maybe it's \"Hazer\" or \"Sawyel\" or something like that… ; )[Chapter 6] Hey y'all! Here's chapter 6 in record-speed update. New personal record! Yay! ; ) Enjoy! Chapter 6 – Winter, Hope and a splash Sawyer's POV The only thing Sawyer could think about this Saturday morning was Hazel. The day before when they walked on the beach she joked about him owing her a hug. As soon as she mentioned it he felt a strong tingle in his stomach. He felt like a giddy schoolgirl when around her. It was a good feeling, but a little intruding. Sometimes he just wanted to focus on other things like school or his family, but somehow Hazel always managed to sneak up in his mind. \"What are you thinking about, honey?\" asked his mother Lorraine when he sat at the kitchen table eating breakfast while she prepared to go to a meeting for work. \"Oh… Uhh, school\" Sawyer immediately lied. \"Hmm… I think you're thinking about someone with long blonde hair, brown eyes and freckles.\" \"Mom!\" His mother raised her hand in apology. \"I'm just saying, I think it's time you pull yourself together and do something about things.\" \" Things? \" \"Just think about it, okay honey?\" \"Sure…\" She was right, and Sawyer knew it. If he wanted to be more than friends with Hazel then he better do something about \"stuff\". But for now he couldn't. Right now he just wanted to focus on school and finals which were only a few weeks away. But he couldn't focus on that either for the moment. He needed a distraction. The answer just popped up in his head, Winter and Hope! They surely help him by being a distraction for him. Plus he hadn't seen them for a few days, school and his urgent need for being with Hazel had gotten in the way. So he decided to take a bike ride up to the aquarium and visit them. His mind split in two parts, one of them hoped Hazel would be there, the other one didn't. As much as he liked her, he needed to focus on something else to clear his head. \"Hey, Winter!\" Sawyer said when he reached the pool. \"Hey, Hope, how are you guys?\" Winter gave up her tweety bird sound and Hope waved her fins in the water. \"I'll take that as good.\" Winter buffed his hand with her head and splashed some water in his direction as if saying \"Play!\" . Sawyer got the message and went to get Winter's rubber ducky and Hope's water gun. The played with the toys for a while, but after that, Winter and Hope seemed to exchange looks. Sawyer sat and patted them both on their heads. They made a sudden movement inwards to the pool and Sawyer fell in. \"I should have seen that one coming…\" Sawyer said to himself. Winter buffed him with her head again. \"Alright, alright! Come on, let's swim.\" They swam together around the pool. The distraction had worked. Sawyer hadn't thought about Hazel for surely an hour now and his head was much clearer on everything. School, the aquarium, college (which he had already applied to a long time ago but still). His mind was clearer when it came to Hazel too. A small image had started to take form in his mind, that image showed him what he wanted to do but he was afraid he would never have the guts to do it. He pictured her walking with him, she was beautiful. He pictured a flower. Hopefully it would be something she dreamed about. God knew he did. What he had in mind was perfect, but would he ever be able to do it? \"You three seem to be having fun…\" Sawyer looked but to see a beautiful blonde with hazel colored eyes and freckles. Hazel was leaning against shelf filled with toys, smirking. Sawyer remembered what he just fantasized about and felt a little flustered. \"How long have you been standing there?\" he asked. \"A while\" Hazel smirked. She walked up to the pool and sat down with her legs dangling in the water. \"How long is that?\" \"I don't know, maybe fifteen minutes. You didn't notice…\" \"I guess I didn't.\" Hazel smiled at him. \"You're cute when you're flustered.\" \"You can tell that I am?\" \"Your face is kind of red.\" She leaned forward and added in a dramatic whisper: \"It easy to tell then…\" Sawyer got even more embarrassed and felt himself getting more red. Hazel's POV He was cute when flustered. She had never had the guts to say it before but now it just slipped out and she had to make a joke out of it. Hazel wanted to tell him everything she felt for him. Like how much she loved him caring so much about the aquarium, the way he stammered when he was unsure and how much she liked him. Why couldn't she do it? Sawyer was the first person he knew for sure she ever liked in that way. She wanted to say the first person she had ever fallen in love with. That was the truth, she was in love with him. But before she knew for sure that there could be anything between them, she was afraid to utter those words aloud. \"Wanna join us in this fine pool?\" Sawyer joked. \"Maybe…\" \"Maybe… Fine. I won't force you.\" Sawyer swam closer. \"But maybe just a little!\" Sawyer grabbed Hazel's arm and pulled. She splashed into the water \"Sawyer!\" \"What?\" Hazel splashed some water on his as an answer. Sawyer splashed back and soon they had gotten into a water war. Very romantic, in Hazel's mind. Recently there had been a lot of moments. Like the time they went for Frozen yoghurt, when they fell asleep together on Sawyer's bed, when he gave her that bracelet. The bracelet was beautiful, she had been wearing it every day since she got it from him, though he didn't know whether he had noticed it or not. She hoped he had. \"Alright you two! Stop it before you create a tsunami!\" It was her dad talking, fortunately he smiled. \"Sorry dad\" said Hazel. \"Don't worry, it's fine. We're all going out for pizza. Your mom too, Sawyer. Get changed into something dry and let's go!\" \"We're coming!\" said Sawyer and smiled. He got out of the pool and offered Hazel his hand to help her up, which she took. It had been a good day… Hope you liked it! So I gave you a tiny, teeny little hint to a major fluffiness coming later in the story. Maybe some of you can guess, maybe all of you! : ) So far it's all been pretty calm and I hope to maintain that just a little. I just remembered something! I've completely forgotten about Simple Swedish! *Face palm So here I have a few phrases if anyone is interested, just to make it up to you: Vad heter du? (What's your name?) Hur mår du? (How are you feeling?) Jag mår bra. (I'm feeling good.) Jag älskar dig. (I love you.)[Chapter 7] Hey y'all! Chapter 7 is up! I hope you enjoy it! Chapter 7 – Talk Hazel's POV Hazel sat quietly in her room, just doing nothing. Her dad sat in the other room reading a news paper. She had her perfect opportunity and she knew it. Hazel had decided to not hide her feelings anymore and talk to her dad about college. To apply before even telling him about it was probably a mistake. What if she did get in and her dad said no? What would she do then? Because to go without his permission was out of the question. Not only would she never be able to pay for the fees herself, if she did go, then her dad would be mad at her. Slowly, Hazel stood up. She took a deep breath. Come on now, she told herself. This wasn't any worse than when she asked for Mandy's files a couple of years ago. Come on now, Hazel! It now or never! Now or never, now or never, now or never! \"Dad?\" she said. \"Yeah?\" \"Can we talk?\" \"Of course. Come here!\" Hazel sat down opposite her father at the small dining table. She tried to maintain a calm expression, but the anxiety and fear was clearly visible. Her father noticed it. He looked worried. \"What's wrong, honey? Tell me.\" Hazel couldn't look at him, she just looked at her knees. \"Listen dad. I've done something. I'm scared of what you'll think of me when I tell you, and hope you can understand. I hope you're okay with it.\" Before she had a chance to continue, her dad stopped her. \"Hold on a second! You're not pregnant are you?\" His face showed a mix of nervousness and anxiousness. Hazel looked up, half confused, half surprised. \"What!? No! No, no, no! God, dad! I'm not pregnant. That I can promise you.\" \"Good! Alright, that's good. You had me worried there for a second.\" He looked relieved. \"No this is about something way different. Dad, listen. I want to go to college.\" \"College?\" \"Yes, college. I've already applied to a one that I find interesting. There all involved in marine biology in one way or another so I'll still study what we do here. And it'll be a great experience. And if I have graduated college it'll be a really good thing, right? And-\" \"Hazel! Stop rambling, please.\" \"Okay…\" \"Look. I do think it's a great idea. I want you to go. Honey, I really do. If I could let you, I would. Believe me…\" \"But?\" \"But we don't have the money. I can't afford it. I'm sorry. I really am.\" Hazel felt her heart sink. For just a second she thought she would be able to go. For a moment a feeling of joy like no other had filled her heart. Now felt like the tears were near. She tried really hard to not cry. \"Oh… Well- well it's okay. It's alright…\" \"I'm really sorry I can't send you.\" \"Actually. You can\" said a voice. Hazel looked up to see her grandfather standing in the doorway, smiling. \"Dad, we don't have the money\" said Hazel dad. \"Well, we don't. But Hazel do.\" \"I do?\" Hazel asked. \"Yes. I haven't told you yet. We can call it a late birthday present.\" \"Grandpa, what are you talking about?\" \"Over the years I've had a little project of my own. A college fond.\" \"A what?\" asked both Hazel and her dad at the same time. \"A college fond. I was supposed to give it to you on your eighteenth birthday, but since you've never mentioned college until now I was unsure whether you would need the money or not. Now I see that you do so, happy late birthday. You have enough money to pay for the fees.\" He smiled. \"Are you serious?\" Hazel asked. Her grandfather nodded. \"Oh my god! Oh my god!\" She ran over and almost knocked him to the floor in a big hug. Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I love you so much!\" Tears of joy were now running freely down her cheeks. \"You're very welcome, sweetheart. I love you too.\" Hazel couldn't believe it. She had her dream now. She would go. If she got in. But in the joy she was feeling she could only imagine she would. \"Hazel?\" he dad asked. \"Yes?\" \"Come here.\" Hazel released herself from her grandfather and walked over to sit down again. \"I have something to tell you, too.\" \"What?\" \"I do hope to can take some sort of leadership class there.\" \"Why?\" \"Because one day. I will no longer have the strength to continue to run this place. When that day comes, I want you to be the one to take over.\" \"Me?\" \"You remind me so much about your mother, Hazel. I know you can do it. She would want you to too.\" There were no words. Tears of joy ran down her cheeks again and she could only hug her father and whisper \"Thank you!\" quietly in his arms. Sawyer's POV Sawyer sat in a chair outside his house in the garden. After visiting Winter and Hope, his mother had ordered him to study. Actually he had already planned to do it. So he sat in the strong sun, reading his notes he took in history. Year after year, event after event. How was he supposed to remember all of this? Sure, he was what people would call a 'talented student', but this? This was hard. \"Hey, handsome!\" Sawyer looked up. There stood a girl around his age just outside the garden. She looked like a young Scarlett Johansson with her wavy blonde hair, plushy red lips and green-grayish eyes. She wore a pair extremely small white shorts and a black tank top that showed a fair amount of cleavage. \"Hi?\" \"I'm Scarlett.\" Irony… \"Just moved in over there.\" And indeed, two houses away there was family moving in their stuff from a van. \"Oh.\" Sawyer didn't know what to say. All he wanted was for this Scarlett to go away. There was something about her that didn't feel right. \"Good for you.\" He looked down in his notes again. \"It is. Now I get to be neighbors with you don't I?\" Just when Sawyer looked at her again she puffed her chest and put her hand on her hip, making her breasts even more exposed. Her smile would have been seductive for any other guy on the planet, but for Sawyer? No, he just felt like she was in the way. Quite annoying actually. \"I suppose so…\" \"Well, I gotta' go. See you around… Sawyer.\" Scarlett out on a pair of sunglasses and walked away and no one could deny that she swayed her hips more than normal. Sawyer felt like the heaven had just fallen down on his head. He was so confused. Not in any \"Oh now I'm attracted to two girls at the same time\" kind of way, because he was not attracted to her. Everything about felt wrong. He felt confused because he had no idea how to handle or reject someone like that. Nothing like that had ever happened to him before. Ever… Suddenly he heard the song \"Brave souls\" as his phone started vibrating in his pocket. Hazel's favorite song. A pretty picture of her was displayed on the screen and his heart skipped a beat. He knew where his heart belonged. He had for a long time. \"Hey, Hazel\" he said as he answered the phone call. \" Sawyer! Guess what?\" she answered. She almost screamed the words out and he could hear her joy across the line. \"What? Hazel what's going on? Why are you so happy?\" \" Sawyer! I did it! Earlier today! I talked to my dad about college!\" \"You did? That's great! Awesome, what did he say?\" \" Well at first he said that he couldn't afford to send me.\" Sawyer's heart dropped a few inches. \"But then grandpa came in and he said he had some kind of college fond ready. So I can go! This is incredible! I can't believe it! I'm actually going! If I get in, but still! If I do… I'll be able to go!\" \"Amazing! Wow! That's really great, Hazel. I'm so happy for you!\" \" Thanks! I'm so happy too!\" \"I can hear that.\" \" Look, Sawyer I got to go now. I'm going to help dad with some stuff. I'll talk to you more tomorrow when you get here after school, alright?\" \"Alright. See you tomorrow.\" \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" Sawyer leaned back in his chair. She had done it. She was so happy, and so was he. Now she wouldn't have to be afraid anymore. And he could concentrate on studying and taking the finals as quickly as possible and be done with it so that he could ask Hazel that very special question he so badly wanted to ask her. \"Hi honey\" said his mom Lorraine from the open window. \"Why are you so happy?\" \"I don't know\" Sawyer lied. He didn't want to tell anybody about this without Hazel's permission. She probably wanted to be the one to tell people. \"I just am…\" \"That's nice. Dinner's ready in ten minutes.\" \"Okay mom.\" She smiled and her head went back inside. She had done it… Duh duh duuuh! Now, who is this Scarlett and what is she up to? I know that \"Brave souls\" was written by Cozi Zhuelsdorff, but I thought it could be a fun thing if that song existed in the Dolphin Tale world. And by the way! I'm so excited! You know why? You know why? Dolphin Tale 3 is uuuuuuup! Yes people I'm not kidding! David Yates announced at a press conference that \"discussions have begun toward creation of Dolphin Tale 3 and television show\"! YAAAAAAY! It's supposedly to be released before 2018. Now honestly, I'm a little skeptical towards a television show because I have no idea how they are going manage that. But 3 is on! I'm so fangirling! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Jag är hungrig (I'm hungry). Please leave a review! :D[Chapter 8] Hello every wonderful reader out there! It's been a while but I wanted to focus on The 68 th annual hunger games which is now complete. So apart from a possible epilog to that, I will now focus entirely on this story. I'm quite happy with this chapter. Enjoy! Chapter 8 – Chores Sawyer's POV It had been a couple of days since Hazel had talked to her dad, but the joy on her face never faded (except maybe in the mornings). Sawyer felt happy by just seeing her happiness. But something had been bugging him slightly. That new girl, Scarlett. He wasn't the least bit attracted to her, yet she seemed to pop up in his mind from time to time. Every time he'd seen her outside his or her house she was surrounded by girls so it didn't seem like she had any trouble finding new friends and fitting in, and every time she saw him she always flashed a flirtatious smile and waved slightly. It was amazing to Sawyer how one small gesture could annoy him so much. He tried to avoid her when he could but it wasn't easy since she popped up everywhere. \"Got any plans for this weekend?\" Hazel asked, waking him from his thoughts. They were cleaning the floor in the lobby at the CMA. \"No, not really\" answered Sawyer. \"You?\" \"No. At least I don't think I do, not unless dad has anything planned which I doubt.\" There was a small pause before she continued. \"Okay… So I was wondering if maybe-\" His phone started ringing. \"Sorry Hazel, hold that thought.\" He answered the phone. \"Hello?\" \" Hey honey, it's mom\" said Lorraine from the other line. \"Hey mom.\" \" Hey. I'm sorry for calling so late, I know I'm supposed to be on my way home now but one of the doctors got sick so I have to jump in for him.\" \"Okay…\" \" So I was hoping that maybe you could run some errands for me. I'll probably be home in a few hours but if we don't get them done now, it will be really late.\" \"Yeah sure. What do you want me to do?\" \" I need you to purchase some things for me, could you make a list?\" \"Yeah, hold on.\" Sawyer turned to Hazel. \"Hazel do we have paper and a pen anywhere near?\" Hazel walked over to the check out and grabbed a notebook and a pen and gave them to Sawyer. \"Okay mom, start.\" His mom gave him a long list of things to buy. Mostly food, like vegetables and pasta, but also house hold things like dust bags and laundry detergent. \"Got it, mom. Anything else?\" asked Sawyer. \" Mm… No I don't think so. Thank you, honey.\" \"No problem, see you soon.\" \" Alright, bye.\" \"Bye.\" Sawyer hung up and put the list in his pocket and the notebook and pencil back. \"What was it you wanted to say?\" he asked Hazel. \"Nothing. That was Lorraine, right?\" she answered. \"Yep. She's going to be late so she asked me to pick up a few- or a lot of things. So I have to go. I would invite you but I guess that shopping for my mom isn't the ideal way you want to spend your afternoon.\" \"Hm. I wouldn't mind. I could come if you like.\" \"Yeah you're welcome to.\" \"Okay then. Let's just talk to dad real quick so he knows what's going on.\" They explained what was going on to Clay and he gave them permission to go. So after that, they took the bus to the nearest mall. Sure, they could've just bought what they needed in an ordinary supermarket but for starters, the detergent that his mother wanted could only be bought in special stores for house chores. Second, Sawyer had a little secret motive, which was to observe Hazel's expression when they walked past a certain store. Hopefully something that could help him would show. They started with the house hold stuff, since they had to shop some chilled foods to purchase. Sawyer made sure that they took the long way around the mall so they for sure would walk past that store. And, just like Sawyer hoped, it gave result. He could swear he saw a glimpse of yearning in Hazel's eyes as they passed all the colors and all the bling. \"Sawyer!\" Hazel's POV Hazel turned around to see who was calling his name. A blond girl came walking towards them, flanked with two other giggling ones. She looked like she could have been beautiful if she hadn't put on two pounds of makeup and an outfit that made her look like a mix between a stripper and a prostitute. Her hips swayed way more than normal and she flashed a flirtatious smile towards Sawyer. One thing was for sure, whoever she was, she wasn't good news. \"Hello\" said Sawyer and his face looked stiff. The girl puckered her lips slightly. \"How are you?\" \"I'm perfect. You look very good in that blue shirt, like me.\" \"Thanks.\" It calmed Hazel a little that he didn't return the compliment since this girl was also wearing blue. She didn't like the way she was ignored, especially not by some bimbo who tried to flirt with her Sawyer. She cleared her throat, quite loudly. \"I'm sorry. Can I help you?\" the girl said turning towards her. \"Excuse me?\" Hazel couldn't believe her ears! She felt some kind of mix between a blush and anger forming in her face. Sawyer quickly cut in. \"This is my friend Hazel\" he said. \"Oh? Hazel? \" Hazel new it was a rhetorical question, that bimbo made fun of her name. \"Yes\" said Sawyer. \"Is there a problem?\" \"Of course not, honey. Right, girls?\" The two girls behind her only giggled with looks of amusement on their faces. Hazel stared at them but they didn't stop. \"Look, we need to get going now\" she said, trying to get out of there as quickly as possible. \"Oh, did you say something, Hazel? \" said the bimbo. Hazel felt fury build inside her and she stepped forward a bit and the bitch sneered. Sawyer put his hand on Hazel's arm to stop her. \"She did. And Hazel's right. We do need to get going. Goodbye.\" Hazel could see that he tried to remain calm but the anger she felt burned in his eyes too. \"Oh, well that's a pity you can't stay, Sawyer. It was so nice to see you again.\" \"Thanks\" he only said again. Once again she saw how he tried to keep a straight and calm face but it seemed to becoming harder and harder. \"Goodbye.\" \"Bye. See you around.\" The bitch walked away with her two giggling companions after her. Hazel exhaled deeply, trying to calm herself but it didn't do any good. The anger was still boiling inside her. Sawyer looked at her with an apologetic expression. \"I'm sorry\" he said. \"Sawyer\" Hazel answered shortly. \"Who, the hell, was, that?\" \"Scarlett. She kind of moved in two houses away a few days ago, I think she goes to my school now.\" \"Oh? Well she seemed to like you. A lot .\" \"I don't like her . I think she's annoying and I think that she should return to wherever it is she came from and torment some other guy there instead.\" \"Really?\" Her arms were crossed and the disbelief was clearly displayed on her face. Sawyer tried desperately to calm her. \"Really. I really don't like her, at all. Please trust me.\" Now she started to feel calmer. \"I trust you. I'm sorry for acting out on you like this.\" \"Don't be. You have all the rights to, I can't believe she treated you like that. She doesn't even know you.\" They finished the rest of the list. Hazel looked around now and again just to make sure the bitch Scarlett didn't show up. She didn't fortunately. \"Hazel, I know you hate coffee, but do you maybe want to grab some hot chocolate on the way home?\" asked Sawyer with a hopeful look on his sweet face. \"As long as I don't have to stay in here. If she shows up again, I'm going to puke\" Hazel answered. \"Hopefully on her shoes…\" she added dreamily. \"Let's hope you do.\" Sawyer laughed. \"Come on now, silly.\" Sawyer put his arm around her shoulders and they started to walk out. Hazel's heart raced in happiness this time when she put her arm around his waist. Maybe the end of the day could be better than the afternoon. Hope you liked it! This was my first time writing someone who's a \"serious bitch\", I think I did okay but I don't know so please give me some feedback. I have a feeling that some of Scarlett's comments weren't sassy or mean enough. Please help me! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Min favorit färg är *grön* (my favorite color is *green*). Here are some other colors to fill in with: Röd – Red Blå – Blue Gul – Yellow Orange – Orange Rosa – Pink Lila – Purple Svart – Black Vit – White Brun – Brown Guld – Gold Silver - Silver[Chapter 9] Hey y'all! Hope you're doing well! Here's chapter 9! It's quite short. So I'll try to get the next one out quite quick. Some of you are starting to request a kiss between are to favorite teens. I want to incorporate one right now as much as anyone. But I have to stick to my storyline. Just hang in there, something very fluffy will happen in a couple of chapters. I've dropped several hints throughout the story so far and I think you can figure it out by now. If you can, let me know just because I'm curious. But don't reveal what you think it is, just if you have figured it out. If there are someone out there who doesn't want to know until it's time, then let's not spoil it for him or her or them. Anyway! Enjoy! Chapter 9 – Some not so new news Hazel's POV Who was this Scarlett? Why would she flirt with Sawyer like that? Of course he was good looking, everybody could see that. But still… It was her Sawyer! And the fact that now someone else was after him frightened her. If she truly wanted Sawyer to be hers than she had to do more than just sit here and dream about him. She had to do something, asking him out. Though she tried that. The same day she unfortunately met that Scarlett. Just when Lorraine called she was about to ask him to go out, to dinner, on a date. But when she called Hazel lost her courage, now she wasn't sure she'd be able to try again. Something like this had never happened to her before. She had never been in love before, though now she had been in love with him for a good couple of years. She didn't think the spark had faded away, yet . Hazel was thinking so much she almost got a stomach ache. She had to get all this stuff of her shoulders. She needed to talk to someone, but there weren't many girls to talk to in her life. She had Lorraine of course but she felt really awkward talking about liking Sawyer with Sawyer mom. Then there was Phoebe, she was a good candidate, older too. So she most likely had some experience with boys. But for some reason it just didn't feel right. She wasn't really that close with the other women working at the CMA. She didn't have a girl BFF. Sometimes she missed that, having a really close female friend whom she could say anything to. But who Hazel could talk to struck her like a lightning bolt just when she needed it. She stood up from the chair she was sitting in, walked over to the main pool and sat down. Almost immediately Winter and Hope came swimming towards her. They made sounds as if saying 'hello'. Hazel smiled and patted both of their heads. \"Hi\" she said. Hope swam away to fetch some toys for them to play with, but Winter stayed. She looked at Hazel with knowing eyes, it was like she could sense that something was wrong. \"Winter, I know that you can hear me and understand. What I don't know is whether or not you can help me. But I need to talk to someone, about Sawyer and this girl who tries to flirt with him.\" She told Winter the whole story of what happened at the mall. She told all about the fears it had brought up inside her. \"Now I just don't know… I mean, I know what has to be done but I don't know if I have the guts to try and ask him out again. And if I don't she surely will, I don't think he would say yes. Though she will probably keep trying until he caves and then I will have lost him. I try to leave some hints here and there that I really like him, but boys don't really pick up on them. On some level I think that he likes me back, well I hope that he does. I'm just so confused…\" Winter rested her head in Hazel lap. It was amazing how a dolphin could know. Now if it was like a female-to-female connection, or if Winter could sense Hazel's worries or if she actually understood teenage love problems, Hazel didn't know. And she didn't really care either. All she cared about was the fact that Winter could comfort her. Sawyer's POV The sky was slightly more pink than usual when his mother pulled in the car at their house, indicating that the sun would set in a couple of hours. Hazel would like this purpley-pink color, Sawyer thought. Maybe she sat and watched it right now. Either way, she would like it. \"Alright Sawyer, quit daydreaming and help me with the bags\" said his mother and winked at him. Suddenly, Sawyer remembered that they had like five or six bags of food in the backseat. He stepped out of the car and helped his mother with two of the bags, while she also took two. Then he went outside again to get the last one, while his mom started to unpack them. When he got in his mother was busy with putting some new herbs in a cabinet. Sawyer started to unpack the other bags. \"Listen, mom\" he started, he tried to sound as casual as possible though his heart pounded very fast. \"I- I was thinking about maybe going to the beach with Hazel this weekend.\" \"Oh? This weekend? I'm sorry honey. You're going to have to reschedule that. Have you talked to her yet?\" asked his mother. \"No… But why can't I?\" \"Have you forgotten? Sawyer I told you a month ago, about your uncle Dan.\" \"Uncle Dan in Texas? What about him?\" \"He's getting married, remember. We're going to Texas this weekend.\" \"I remember now… Well next time, maybe…\" \"I'm sure. Was this beach time meant to be a date?\" Sawyer's mom smiled slyly. Sawyer blushed. \"No… Well… I was planning on taking her on a date, but not now. After the finals.\" Lorraine's smile changed from sly to knowing. \"Aw! Oh, Sawyer! That is so romantic, she'll love it.\" \"I hope so… If she even says yes.\" \"Of course she will. I know she likes you. Everyone can see it, and that you like her too.\" \"Really?\" \"Yeah. It's very obvious, honey. I'm glad that you're finally doing something about it. It will be wonderful, you'll see. Besides that, does your shirt need cleaning? The light blue one, I think you should wear that this weekend.\" \"Well, I wouldn't know what to wear anyway, I'll go and check after dinner. What are we having?\" \"Something with pasta, maybe chicken. Do you want anything in particular?\" \"No chicken's fine.\" \"Alright, good. That's settled then. When we're done with this, why don't you start cutting up some carrots we can roast with the chicken?\" \"Yeah sure.\" \"And invite Hazel and her family over for dinner if you want to, we have enough food for all of us.\" \"Yeah, alright.\" Sawyer's heart skipped a beat. Sawyer took his phone and quickly typed a message for Hazel. You, Clay and your grandpa are all welcome over for dinner tonight. If you want to come. : ) A few minutes later, Hazel responded. We would love to come! When? : ) \"Mom, when?\" asked Sawyer. \"Say… In an hour\" his mom responded just as she got the chicken out from the freezer and put it in the microwave. In about an hour! Alright! I'll see you soon! : ) See you! : ) Sawyer smiled, and then went to help his mother with dinner. So that was another chapter done. ;) Now, Scarlett didn't show up and won't for a couple of chapters. Which is a perfect opportunity for me to get some feedback from you wonderful people out there. Any helpful soul please PM me and give me some ideas on how we can make Scarlett even more nasty. If you have a scenario or just a line that we can incorporate, let me know! : ) Pretty pretty please! *Puppy dog eyes* Simple Swedish of the chapter: The fact that we have three extra letters in our alphabet. They are Å å, Ä ä, and Ö ö. Here is how you pronounce them: Å: When you say the word 'afford', the 'o' sound is how you pronounce the letter Å. Try saying 'Åkomma' – Disease or 'Får' – Sheep. Ä: Hair is a good way to learn this letter, the 'ai' sound is also the 'Ä' sound. Try to say 'Kärlek' – Love or 'Äta' – Eat. Ö: Think Bird. The way you pronounce the 'I' in this word the way to pronounce 'Ö'. Try 'Ö' – Island or 'Över' – Over To be continued in \"The trip\".[Chapter 10] Hi! Finally I'm able to post a quick update! Yay! I enjoyed writing this chapter so I hope that you will like it! But just a small warning for everyone, in this chapter there will be a few sex-references, so you are now warned. Enjoy! Chapter 10 – The trip Sawyer's POV Sawyer tried to focus. He really tried, but he didn't like history. It was the most boring subject. The teacher kept on blabbering about the American civil war, he was supposed to take notes. He did, but they were quite vague. Later today he was to take the plane to Houston, Texas. His uncle Dan lived there, and he was getting married. Sure a wedding would be nice, so he didn't detest the trip. But he didn't like the idea of leaving Winter, or Hazel. He didn't have the guts to tell Hazel how much he would miss her, even if it only was one weekend. Though he did tell her about not wanting to leave winter. She told him that Winter would be fine, she had Hope to keep her company and it was only for three days. Hazel was right, as always… But the small knot of anxiousness still lingered. Sawyer pushed all that out of his mind for now, for now he only wanted to focus on catching up on these notes. By the time the class ended, he was quite happy with the result. XXX During the lunch break he didn't have much to do. He had read some of his other notes over and over a couple of times. Most of the students were already cramming, or maybe it wasn't so \"already\"? The finals did start on Monday, and it was Friday. It struck Sawyer that it was a good time to start cramming, Hazel had too, even though she had all of her finals at home in the calm boathouse. But he didn't start just yet. He flipped through the pictures on his phone and his eyes caught a picture of Hazel, the same picture he used as her profile picture. It was taken on the latest New Years Eve. Sawyer thought she looked so beautiful that night, she had worn a black dress with purple sparkles. Her hair was half put up in a bun and she wore some make up, she almost never did that, which made her look incredibly stunning when she did. At first she had refused to let him take the picture, but when the fireworks went off she cave and let him take it. It was beautiful. She was beautiful. \"Who's that?\" Sawyer looked up and saw Connor standing behind him, looking at the screen. Connor definitely wasn't his best friend, Hazel was. But he was a friend Sawyer could hang out with during school hours. Connor sat down beside him. \"Hazel\" answered Sawyer. \"Oh? So that's Hazel… She looks good.\" \"Yeah… She does…\" Sawyer felt really awkward. \"But you have a girlfriend, Connor.\" \"I know. I'm just saying, she not a bad catch if you get her. You have been talking about her for quite some time.\" Sawyer felt himself blush and didn't answer. Nor did he need to, just then Connor's best friend Luke and girlfriend Emma appeared and sat down, Luke on the bench across them and Emma beside Connor who put his arm around her. \"Guys we really need to study\" said Emma. \"Yeah you're right\" answered Connor. They got started and the time seemed to fly by. XXX Sawyer stood outside the house, leaning against the car. His mom sat in the driver's seat. They waited for his aunt, other uncle and cousin Kyle to drive by with their car so they could drive together to the airport. Lorraine sat impatiently and looked around, they were late, and she hated being late. Sawyer didn't really like it either but, just this one time he didn't mind. Hazel had said that she would swing by just to say goodbye. She hadn't yet. If she didn't have the time, he understood but he hoped that he could see her one final time before they were off. His aunt's car pulled in and Kyle opened the window from the back seat. \"You all set?\" he asked. \"All set\" answered Sawyer's mom. \"Get in the car, Sawyer.\" \"Please just wait one more minute, mom\" Sawyer begged. \"Honey, we're really late. We have to go, or we'll miss the plane.\" \"Yeah, I know, but please.\" \"Get in the car, honey.\" Sawyer looked around one final time with a pleading look on his face. \"Alright…\" He opened the car door and was just about to step in when someone shouted his name. \"Sawyer!\" Hazel came biking towards them. \"One second mom\" said Sawyer. His mom nodded, smiling. Sawyer ran towards her so they wouldn't have to stand beside his watching family. \"You made it\" he said with a goofy smile on his face. \"Yeah. Sorry I'm late\" answered Hazel. \"Don't worry about it.\" Hazel looked over his shoulder. \"So I guess you need to get going\" she said. Sawyer nodded \"Yeah…\" \"Well have fun. And text me!\" \"I will, I promise.\" Sawyer leaned in and they hugged. Hazel's cheeks were slightly pink when they broke the hug. Sawyer smiled. For a moment he hesitated, he was afraid of the reaction. But he leaned in again and kissed Hazel on the cheek. Hazel's cheeks turned even pinker but she smiled at him. \"Bye\" said Sawyer. \"Bye.\" Sawyer walked back to the car, just before he got in he turned around towards Hazel again. She smiled and waved, he waved back. Then he finally got in the car and they drove away. Hazel's POV He kissed her! She couldn't believe it! Well, it was only on the cheek, but still! He kissed her! Her heart still raced, even though she could barely see the cars anymore. On her way home she felt like she was biking on clouds. The fact that he had, proved that he didn't like Scarlett even though it was obvious that she liked him. So maybe Hazel had a chance after all. She just felt happy, so happy. Maybe she could ask Sawyer out after this, she wanted to. But at the same time, she hoped Sawyer would be one asking her out. It would be so romantic! \"Maybe it could work…\" Hazel whispered to herself on her way home. Sawyer's POV Sawyer still had his goofy smile on when they sat waiting for the boarding to start. His mom was sitting on her phone, his aunt and uncle both had a magazine they flipped through and Kyle was away to get a burger. He couldn't focus on a magazine or anything. His mind drifted away to the fact the he kissed Hazel all the time and every time it did, it bubbled in his stomach and he couldn't help but smiling like crazy. \"Someone's in a good mood today\" said Kyle when he came back and sat down next to Sawyer. \"Does Hazel have anything to do with it? Or the fact that you kissed her before?\" \"Um… Yes..?\" \"So you two are going out now? 'Cause if you are, then why haven't you told me?\" \"We're not going out. I am taking her out after the finals, though.\" \"Ooh!\" Kyle nudged his arm with his. \"Nice!\" \"How's medical school going?\" Sawyer asked, changing subject. \"Good, very good actually\" answered Kyle and took a bite of his burger. Soon after, it was time to board the plane. His mom and aunt chatted happily about the wedding while his uncle, Kyle's dad walked behind them. Sawyer and Kyle lingered. \"Look\" started Kyle. \"Hazel is a good girl, and I think you to really look great together. But I just want you to be careful, okay. Don't rush things, I now you've known each other for a long time, but when you become a couple , you might want to try things. And-\" \"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\" Sawyer interrupted. \"Are you going to have the talk with me?\" \"A lot of people are going to have the talk with you now Sawyer, you are in that age and you'll soon have a girlfriend.\" \"How do you know that I'll soon have a girlfriend? How do you know that she'll even say yes?\" \"I just do. Everyone can see that she will. Anyway, just be careful.\" \"I will…\" Sawyer felt his face becoming redder than a tomato. It wasn't exactly like he was planning to have sex with Hazel next time he saw her. Maybe he'd pictured some kind of scenario of being with her, but not in that way. At least not until Kyle brought it up, and he didn't want to think about at the moment. \"Are you two coming?\" asked Sawyer aunt suddenly. \"Yes! We're coming now!\" said Kyle. They boarded the plane and Sawyer said a quiet goodbye to everything we wouldn't see for a few days. Winter, Hope, Hazel, the CMA and his very comfortable bed. Then he dug around in his backpack after his geography notes, found them and was determent to cram until the plane landed. He felt the tingle in his stomach when the plane lifted, beginning the three hour ride to Houston, Texas. Chapter 10 done! Now, I'm not really sure if it takes three hours to take a plane from Miami to Houston, but when I researched it, that's what is said. So don't hate if I got it wrong, please. To be continued in \"Texting\". See you soon! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Two words that doesn't exist in the English vocabulary. \" Lagom\" – I think we can say that this word means 'just enough' or something like that, it's difficult to explain. Like: \"Det är lagom med socker i kaffet\" – \"It is just enough sugar in the coffee.\" \" Fika\" – Which basically means that people meet and eat something sweet, like cookies or cake, drink something (usually coffee or tea) and chat about something.[Chapter 11] Hello! A very short chapter ahead but I couldn't stretch it. I hope that the next one will be longer. This one is made entirely of texts and calls, hence the name. ;) Enjoy! Chapter 11 – Texts and calls Friday 19:30 S: Hey! :D H: Hi! You're all set at the hotel? : ) S: Yeah. It's actually quite nice, here. But Miami's way better! ;) H: Well I wouldn't know, haven't been in Houston… : ) S: Yet! H: Yet… : ) S: How's everything back home? Is Winter okay? H: Sawyer, don't worry! Winter's excellent, we cleaned her and Hope's pool today when I got back. And we rescued an eel from a crab trap that had floated ashore. S: Oh that's good! Both parts. Is the eel okay? H: It's got a few cuts, but it's fine. We're sending on X-ray tomorrow just to be sure. I've named him \"Herbert\". S: Herbert? Seriously? H: Yes! It's cute! S: Poor eel… ;) H: Shut up! It IS cute! S: Well if you say so… : ) H: I do! S: Sorry Hazel, but we're going out with the rest of the family for dinner. We probably can't talk more today. Can we talk more tomorrow? : ) H: Yeah, of course! No worries, have fun and take care! S: You too! Goodnight! : ) H: Goodnight! : ) Saturday 10:09 H: Good morning! S: Good morning! : ) Saturday 13:26 H: Enjoy the wedding! S: Haha, thanks! Have fun today, you too! Saturday 18:23 – Sawyer's POV \"Hey, Hazel! How are you?\" \" Hello! I'm good. How's the wedding?\" \"Purple.\" \" Purple?\" \"Yeah pretty much everything is more or less purple. The decorations at the church, the decorations here, the cake, details on the costumes and dress. Yeah pretty much everything as I said.\" \" Okay… But I like purple so it sounds good to me.\" \"Yeah you would have loved it… …I wish you were here.\" \" Really? …You do?\" \"Yeah… It would be funnier here if you were. I mean a wedding's nice and all and the food is great but there's like no one else in our age here. There's either grownups or toddlers here.\" \" Can't you hang out with Kyle?\" \"I can but he's bonded with some dudes from the bride's side of the family so he's mostly with them.\" \" Hmm… I wish I was there too. With you, in a fancy dress.\" \"On the dance floor?\" \" Maybe… If you want to.\" \"Hmm… And I guess the dress is, purple? \" \" Nah, I was rather thinking pink. But yes it can be purple .\" \"Purple it is!\" \" Sawyer..?\" \"Yes?\" \" I miss you…\" \"I miss you too, Hazel! But I'll be home soon.\" \" Yeah I know… Winter and Hope misses you too.\" \"Well give them my love!\" \" I will do that!\" \"Good.\" \" Look, Sawyer I got to go now, I have to help dad close up.\" \"Alright, they're cutting the cake anyway now so I should probably go too.\" \" Okay. So I'll talk to you tomorrow?\" \"Of course! I don't know if I'll text or call but you'll hear from me before we board the plane, is that alright?\" \" Yeah that sounds great. Take care!\" \"You too! Bye.\" \" Bye…\" Sunday 11:16 – Hazel's POV \"Hey!\" \" Hi! How are you and everyone doing?\" \"We're all good, we miss you though.\" \" I miss everyone too. But I'll be home in a few hours.\" \"Are you at the airport now?\" \" Yeah. We're waiting for the boarding to start. Hopefully soon, 'cause the plane is a little late and mom's getting impatient.\" \"I'm sure that everything will work out fine, tell her that.\" \" I will. But hey, I was wondering…\" \"Yeah?\" \" If it doesn't get too late and if you're not busy, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to meet and cram somewhere. The finals do start tomorrow.\" \"That'll be great. But you seem very calm unlike others I've seen.\" \" I'm not, but I try to act normal.\" \"Well you succeed.\" \" Was that a compliment or an insult?\" \"Take it as a compliment.\" \" A compliment then… How's Winter doing?\" \"Great. Still great. You asked me that before.\" \" I know that, but I just want to know.\" \"You know soon, you probably only will get to see her like twice a month depending on where you college lies.\" I'm very well aware of that. That's why I'm already worried for her. I don't want her to think I'm leaving her forever.\" \"She won't think that. Dolphins are smart. She'll know.\" \" I guess you are right.\" \"Sawyer you don't have to worry so much. You shouldn't either, it's not good for you, all that inner stress.\" \" I know, I know, I know. I try, but apparently not very successfully.\" \"You're right. Can't you just take a day after the finals and just chill at the beach with some music or magazines or whatever you want?\" \" Sure, if you are there with me.\" \"I can if you want to.\" \" Good… Oh, there boarding now.\" \"Well then you better get on.\" \" Yeah, I'll call you after we land and we'll see what time it is.\" \"Okay.\" \" Okay, see you.\" \"Bye.\" Hope you liked it. Please leave a review! See you soon in \"Studying\". Simple Swedish of the chapter: The months, some are the same. Januari – January Februari – February Mars – March April – April Maj – May Juni – June Juli – July Augusti – August September – September Oktober – October November – November December - December[Chapter 12] New update! Hope you like this chapter! Enjoy! Chapter 12 – Studying Hazel's POV Hazel was so excited! In just an hour or two, Sawyer would be home again. Even though it was only one weekend she had missed him so much. When he got home they were supposed to study together the rest of the day. The finals started the next day! For both her and Sawyer! She should be studying right now, but for some reason that was romantic but pretty dumb she didn't. She wanted Sawyer to be with her. Silly? Right now she sat in her dad's office, helping him with some paperwork. She'd been doing that more and more. He hadn't asked her to, but ever since he told her that he wanted her to take over and run the place one day, she'd become much more eager to learn the paperwork stuff. \"Hazel?\" her dad said. \"What is it?\" she smiled in answer. \"I have to make a call but I'm swamped, and I forgot my phone in the lobby. Could you run down and get it?\" \"Sure!\" Hazel stood up, walked out and started walking down the halls towards the lobby. She walked quite fast, and he mind was somewhere else so she didn't notice that someone was walking in the opposite direction. And before she knew it, they bumped into each other. It was a girl, she had been holding a stack of books, but now they were scattered across the floor. \"I'm so sorry!\" the girl immediately said and starting collecting the books. \"No, it was my fault\" Hazel apologized. \"I'm sorry, I didn't look where I was going.\" Hazel started helping her with the books. \"Well, neither did I so… Oh, thanks!\" Hazel gave her the last book. \"Thanks. I'm new here, a volunteer, I just finished training. And I'm so clumsy. Again thanks and I'm so sorry.\" \"It's okay. Well, welcome to the CMA. I hope you'll like it here.\" \"Thank you. Are you a volunteer, too?\" \"Oh no, I'm Dr Clay's daughter.\" \"No! Don't tell me I just hit the boss's daughter! I'm so getting fired. And I'm so clumsy, and just… Brilliant!\" There was a mix of fear and sarcasm in her face. \"Don't worry! You didn't hit me and you are not getting fired. What's your name?\" \"Julia, what's yours?\" I'm Hazel.\" \"It's nice to meet you. I would shake hands, but given that I don't want to drop the books again, you get it, right?\" \"Likewise, and I get it. Well I've got to go but I'll see you around.\" \"Alright. Bye!\" \"Bye!\" Hazel smiled at her before they both continued walking towards their goal. This Julia seemed sweet, and she looked to be about Hazel's age. She was quite short, with light brown hair and bluish-grey eyes. She looked a lot nicer than Scarlett and Hazel suspected she was. Hazel quickly found her dad's phone and returned to his office. After she had given the phone to her dad she was excused since the phone call probably would take a while. Hazel asked around, but no one needed help so she walked over to the boathouse and into her room. All her school work and books were scattered across the bed and desk. She tucked all the books into a corner of the room and sat down on the bed. She checked her own phone. There was no message or missed call from Sawyer yet. But soon… Hopefully… Hazel took out a magazine from one of the desk drawers and tried to focus on that to pass the time. It was full of gossip about celebrities, some of it was fun but most of it seemed exaggerated. She felt her eyelids becoming heavier and heavier. Suddenly her phone started ringing and Hazel woke up. A picture of her and Sawyer was displayed on the screen. Hazel smiled and answered. \"Hey, Sawyer\" she said. \" Hi, we're home now\" Sawyer's voice answered on the other line. \"Oh, good. Are you coming over so we can study?\" \" I just need to take a quick shower first but I think I'll be over in max thirty minutes.\" \"Alright. You can just come right over when you're done.\" \" Okay, and can we just visit Winter and Hope too?\" \"Of course! Bye.\" \" Bye.\" A sudden feeling of nervousness filled Hazel after they hung up. She walked over to the mirror and tried to smooth down imaginary wrinkles on her blouse, she brushed her hair and applied just a tiny bit of lip gloss. Next it was her room that needed fixing. She made the bed and tried to get some kind of order on her very messy desk. When Hazel finally was happy with the result she walked out to the porch. Sawyer wasn't there yet so she leaned against the fence and just watched the world around her. It was a beautiful world. The sun shined, the ocean waves rippled against the docs and everyone walking past just seemed to be happy. A couple walked past, a boy and a girl maybe two years older. They held hands and were laughing at something. Hazel imagined her and Sawyer walking like that and felt her face getting red. She saw Julia leaving the CMA. Julia spotted her, she smiled and waved. Hazel waved back, smiling too. Then someone not as pleasant walked by. Scarlett showed up with her little imps following. When Scarlett spotted her, a look of hatred penetrated her face. She stopped in front of the boathouse. \"You live here ?\" she mocked. \"Yes I do. Do you have a problem with that?\" Hazel answered, trying to sound neutral, though she felt her insides boiling. Scarlett giggled with the two imps following her lead. \"Well it's not exactly nice, is it?\" Hazel didn't answer, she just crossed her arms over her chest and raised an eyebrow. \"Did you actually want something?\" \"Where's Sawyer?\" \"Why do you want to know?\" \"Because I do, where is he?\" \"Not telling, 'cause he doesn't want to see you, anyway.\" \"He wants to see me more than you .\" \"Get out of here.\" \"Oh? Did I touch a nerve, there?\" \"Get out.\" Scarlett laughed and walked away followed by her two imps. Hazel stood stiff until she couldn't see them anymore. Then she felt her whole body sulk. Was there something in what Scarlett had said? Deep inside, she knew it was ridiculous. Sawyer had told her how much he detested Scarlett, but there was still a small knot of fear inside her stomach. Hazel walked over the small bridge from the porch to the road, facing the way Scarlett had walked. It was empty now, no one was there. Suddenly she felt a pair of strong arms surrounding her in a hug. She immediately recognized Sawyer's scent. Much more pleasant than Scarlett. She turned around in the embrace and hugged him back. Sawyer's POV \"Hey\" Sawyer whispered. \"Hey…\" Hazel whispered back. He felt her tightening her grip. He was surprised but he didn't argue. When they released each other Sawyer could see that her eyes were slightly red. \"Are you okay?\" he asked, worried. \"I'm fine.\" Sawyer raised an eyebrow at her. \"Really! I'm okay. So, do you want to go and visit Winter and Hope now before we start?\" \"You bet! Come on!\" They went to visit the two dolphins who were both very happy to see him. Winter couldn't stop making her tweety bird sound. Sawyer smiled and laughed, he was so happy to see them again. A small knot reminded him of what was going to happen at the end of the summer but he didn't want to think about leaving Winter. After that, they retired to the boathouse to finally get started with their studies. Sawyer mostly needed to focus on math, history and geography. Hazel tried to help him the best way she could. They both felt like the tests would go okay, but they wanted them to go perfect. They both wanted good grades. Sawyer tested Hazel's knowledge over and over and she did the same for him. Also, they read each other's notes out loud. After a while they took a break and just walked back and forth along the docs. They didn't talk much. At the moment it felt like they didn't need to. They just enjoyed each other's company. Eventually, Hazel asked Sawyer to tell her more about the wedding. Except for the purple parts. He did and before they knew it, they were back at the boathouse. \"Shall we continue?\" asked Sawyer. \"Let's do it\" answered Hazel. \"I'm very thirsty, though. Do you want something first?\" \"Yeah, thanks.\" Soon they were back in Hazel's room with all their work. Sawyer felt like they got much done and he felt more and more ready to take these last high school exams. He was extremely nervous but at the same time, it was a good feeling to know that they were finally here and would soon be over. And after they were over there was this big reward, he really wanted to take Hazel to. At the end of the day, Sawyer had to go home, but they both felt ready to take the tests. \"Thank you for everything today, Hazel\" said Sawyer. \"It really helped a lot.\" \"No worries. It really did. I feel ready.\" \"Me too.\" Sawyer saw that Hazel hesitated for a moment, just like he had once before. Then she got on her tippy toes and kissed him on the cheek. They both looked flustered for a moment. Then Sawyer took his bike and rode off home. Liked it? Leave a review! Like one or two chapters ago, I wrote that they took a plane from Miami to Houston. I did know and still do that the story takes place in Florida. Though I couldn't remember which part of Florida and some part of my head told me \"Miami\". Now my USA geography is not very good since I don't live there but I do know that Miami is a city in Florida. And since I wasn't sure, I used Miami. But if anyone does know for sure where the movies takes place for sure please let me know! : ) Simple Swedish of the chapter: Ja, nej, kanske (Yes, no, maybe). : )[Chapter 13] Hello everyone! I've got some news that are both good and bad depending on how you look at them. The bad news are that I've gotten a nasty flu, which include fever, pretty much every body part I have ache and oh! Add ophthalmia to the pile. ;) The good news are that now that won't have anything to do for a couple of days besides lying in bed, I might as well drag my lazy ass out of bed and write (sorry about the language) ;). So hopefully I'll get at least one more chapter out quickly. Enjoy this chapter! Chapter 13 – Finals Sawyer's POV Sawyer woke up long before the alarm went off. At the first moment of waking he didn't understand why, but then the reason struck like a lightning. The finals start today… Anxiousness and nervousness flooded over him, with a slight hint of nausea. The day before with Hazel made him feel ready but now? Now he felt like he couldn't remember anything anymore. There was no distant sound of preparation in the air so his mom probably wasn't up yet. A sudden sensation of cold filled him as he put his warm feet on the cold floor. He kept on rambling the facts over and over quietly to himself as he walked to take a shower. The warm water helped to sooth him slightly but as soon as he stepped out the nausea came back. By the time he got out of the bathroom, his mom Lorraine had gotten out of bed too. \"Hi, honey\" she said. \"You're up early today.\" \"I couldn't sleep\" Sawyer answered. \"Nervous?\" \"A little… A lot …\" \"I understand that. I was too. Just relax and concentrate, and don't think too much about what the results might be. That'll only distract you.\" \"Okay… Easier said than done.\" Of course he started thinking about 'what the results might be'. \"I know, just try.\" Sawyer nodded and his mother kissed him on the forehead. \"I've got to go now, otherwise I'll be late.\" \"Bye, then.\" \"Bye, I'll see you later in the afternoon.\" \"Yeah…\" After his mom walked out Sawyer made himself a bowl of cereal and went to sit by the TV and started to look for anything good. He hardly touched the cereals and the time slowly passed by. Before he knew or wanted to, it was time to go. Hazel's POV Hazel suspected that she wasn't the only one ton wake up before the alarm went off this morning. She didn't want to go up and risk waking up her dad so it ended with her lying in her bed for an hour and a half with nothing to do besides worrying. The fact the she could read or watch a movie on her laptop or study didn't cross her mind at all. When the alarm did go off, Hazel already had her hand on the clock and was ready to turn it off. She got out of bed and took some clothes out of the small wardrobe and went to the bathroom. There she took a shower and tried to freshen up. When she decided that there really was no way to remove these bags under her eyes she started to walk back to her room. She hadn't gotten much sleep last night. \"Up already?\" a voice asked. Hazel turned around to see her dad reading the morning paper and drinking a cup of coffee. \"It's not really 'already' anymore\" answered Hazel. His dad checked his watch. \"Oh, right. Well, get some breakfast in your system. Grandpa is going to supervise you while you do your exams these coming days.\" \"Alright…\" \"I've got to go now, we have to open up.\" \"Okay…\" \"Good luck.\" \"Thanks.\" Hazel closed her eyes as her dad kissed her on the forehead and then walked out. She spent the rest of her breakfast time browsing the web on her phone. She knew that she shouldn't. She knew that she should do a last minute cram or something, but something in her mind told her that id she did, she'd just forget everything. After a while her grandpa finally showed up and it was time. Sawyer's POV He could feel his palms sweating and his heart beat. The first hour was so stressful. He knew almost every answer, but the knowing that this was it was enough for a nervous breakdown. Okay, not literally but almost. He could hear the rasping of pens everywhere and that was also very stressful. Though, the first test went well in the end. Afterwards, he sat with Connor, Emma and Luke. They all blabbered about whether they got certain questions right or not. Emma was very unsure on one and she couldn't stop talking no matter how much Connor tried to calm her. It was quite cute, actually, though Sawyer had his own questions to worry about. There was one he was very unsure of too, and he went over it over and over again just like Emma did, only in his head instead of out loud. He had two more tests today, one before lunch and one after. It was now fifteen minutes until it started. He already stood outside with them and Emma was already pale and quite sweaty. Connor had his arm around her and kept on telling her that everything would be just fine. Sawyer wondered if Hazel was as nervous as Emma. Hazel's POV The first test went well. Hazel's grandpa kept track of the time while she wrote. There were three questions that she grappled with, but it's always like that. She was nervous of course, but she felt calm. After the first test she took a walk along the docs just to clear her mind. She sat down on a bench and watched the ocean. For a moment she just closed her eyes and thought about how good life would be when these finals were over. She could just relax. Speaking of relaxing, that was over for now. When she looked at her watch she saw that it was time to go back to houseboat and take the next test. When she got in her grandpa had already put everything out and ready for her. \"Alright, Hazel\" he said. \"Ready?\" Hazel sat down and grabbed her pen. \"Ready\" she answered. \"Okay, good luck. Start.\" He pressed the start button and the time started ticking. General POV The finals went well for both of them. Sure there were some parts that didn't go as well but they both felt like they would both get alright grades. They hadn't gotten much time to spend together during these days of tests. Sawyer had barely seen Winter either and he missed both her and Hazel. After the last test, Sawyer and Hazel had decided to take a walk along the beach. Sawyer's POV \"So\" Sawyer started. \"How did it go?\" \"Quite good\" Hazel answered. \"At least I think it did. How about you?\" \"I think it went good too. I didn't think the math test was the best, but I think it was okay.\" \"That's good.\" \"Yeah…\" The sun had started to set, meaning that it was getting late. Hazel stopped in her tracks. Sawyer looked at her. She looked out at the sea and the purple sky and the burning orange sun setting. \"It's beautiful, isn't?\" she said quietly. Hazel's hair glowed in the light of the sun and her skin was slightly sun kissed. Her eyes sparkled with appreciation and joy. \"Yes, you are\" Sawyer answered before he thought about it. She looked at him, her face slowly turned red. \"Uh… Uh, I mean it is .\" \"Oh…\" \"But that doesn't mean I didn't mean it!\" Sawyer said, trying to salvage the situation. \"Because I did.\" Hazel's face lit up, she smiled at him. \"Thank you.\" Sawyer looked into her eyes and slowly stepped closer. He leaned in and they both closed their eyes. Sawyer felt Hazel's breath, they were only inches away from each other now. Hazel's phone started ringing and she stepped away to answer it. Her face was flushed and Sawyer suspected his was too. \"Hey dad\" Hazel answered the phone. There was a moment's break. \"Yeah, okay. Yeah I'll be right home. Bye.\" She put away her phone and looked at him. \"I have to go home now.\" \"Oh. Okay. Do you want me to walk you?\" \"If you want to.\" \"Okay, let's go.\" So that was chapter 13! To be continued in \"Question\". Leave a review! Simple Swedish of the chapter: \"Kan jag fråga dig något?\" (\"Can I ask you something?\")[Chapter 14] Hi everyone! New chapter and I REALLY like it! Hope you will too! Enjoy! Chapter 14 – Question Sawyer's POV Alright, the finals were done, so now it was time. The whole school had been talking about it for a month, at least the girls had. Sawyer only wanted to go, if Hazel went with him. And he hoped she would, because today, he going to ask her. He'd gathered up his courage for days now. Since he and Hazel almost kissed the day before, he'd thought, at least hoped she would say yes. Every time he thought about the almost kiss, he felt all happy and excited. He couldn't understand that he hadn't planned on doing something about his feelings for Hazel until now. Since it was Saturday, he wanted to get to the CMA as soon as possible. His mom was for once free from work so she slept in. Directly after he finished his cereal he took his bike and rode off to the CMA. A lot of guests had already gotten there, despite the morning. Well, if it was Saturday, it was. A lot of volunteers were helping the guests with showing the way and advertising the place. He guessed that Hazel was helping with the preps for Winter's first session with the prosthetic. He walked up the stairs to do the same. After he changed into his wetsuit, he walked over to Winter's and Hope's pool. Some people had already taken their seats and were smiling expectantly. Phoebe and Hazel were there too. Hazel smiled happily and waved when she saw him. Sawyer immediately felt nervous when he got reminded of what he was supposed to ask her later today. \"Hey, Sawyer!\" Hazel said. Phoebe turned around and greeted him too. \"Hi\" Sawyer smiled. He helped them to make the last preparations, and soon it was time to start the session, by this time a lot of people had gathered, including some new volunteers who had never seen it before. They didn't have a special guest today, so Sawyer and Phoebe were the ones to swim with Winter. There was a child with his mother there, he sat in a wheel chair, he'd lost both his legs. Though he smiled as happily as everyone else. He looked to be around eleven. When Sawyer looked at him, he felt happy and sad at the same time. Happy that he could still enjoy life, despite what its thrown at him, and sad that he had to live in that state. \"Phoebe?\" Sawyer whispered. \"What?\" she answered. \"That boy, that one in the wheelchair. Do you see him?\" \"Yes? What about him?\" \"Do you think maybe he would want to greet Winter?\" \"Maybe. We can talk about it, with them after the session, but we have to start now.\" \"Yeah, alright.\" Phoebe nodded towards Hazel who started. \"Hello and welcome to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium!\" The crowd cheered. \"We hope you're all doing great!\" The session went on well. And afterwards, they did speak to the boy and his mother. Apparently he and his dad had been in an accident and the boy had lost his legs. His name was Jeremy. His mother was delighted by the offer and so was Jeremy. They all decided that they would come by after lunch, since Jeremy was shy and didn't want everyone else to look. Hazel's POV After the session, she walked away to the pools where they kept the otters. Julia was there, she was feeding them. \"Hi!\" Hazel said. \"Hi, how are you?\" Julia answered. \"I'm great, you?\" \"Yeah, I'm good too. Do you want some help?\" \"Sit down!\" Hazel sat down next to her and started helping her with the food. She had only known Julia for like a week but she really liked her. Apparently she went to Sawyer's school so she had seen him around but had very few classes with him. She was very sweet and intuitive, Hazel wasn't surprised when she had told him she wanted to become a veterinarian. \"Listen, can I talk to you about a girl thing?\" \"Spill it!\" Julia's face was immediately lit up and she had some kind fire-like glow. \"Well, I kind of like this guy…\" \"Sawyer?\" \"What? Yes, but wait how did you know?\" \"I haven't seen you two together much, but when I have, it's very obvious.\" \"That's what everyone tells me…\" \"So… What's wrong?\" \"I've liked him for like years now, and there's this really stupid bimbo who's like after him or something. But last night, we almost kissed…\" \"Aw! That is so romantic! Just like in movies, oh my gosh!\" Hazel blushed and looked at Sawyer who stood a slight distance away, instructing some volunteers. \"Yeah… But I don't want things to get awkward between us. I mean, I don't think they are but I'm still worried, you know?\" \"I understand. The way I see it you have three options. You can either just straight up kiss him to show how you feel about him, or you can just talk with him or you can pretend like nothing happened. But I think that talking is the best option.\" \"I guess you're right…\" \"Just talk to him, alright?\" \"I will…\" \"I know that we both have like otter food on our hands but come here, I won't touch your shirt.\" Hazel laughed and leaned into the hug Julia offered. Then they both got up and started to walk back to return the bucket in which the food had been. On the way, Julia tripped. \"Are you okay?\" Hazel half laughed, half asked when she helped her up. \"Yeah. I keep telling you, I'm clumsy.\" Sawyer's POV He hadn't gotten a real chance to talk to Hazel at the CMA, let alone ask her anything. His mom was out shopping, so he was alone when he got home. He left his bag on the hallway floor and immediately crashed in the sofa. He had to do it! He had to ask her, he wanted to. But now that it was time, his bravery was long gone. Sawyer tried to imagine the moment when he had asked her, it would feel so good. If she said yes… But she would…right? The phone was in his pocket, he picked it up and found Hazel's number. At first he wanted to call her and ask if they could meet up. But maybe surprising her would be better. More…romantic, maybe? He wasn't good at these like romantic gestures, but it felt right to surprise her. Sawyer left a quick note to his mom, telling her where he was, then he locked the door and took his bike. But before he could get on it, someone stopped him. The last person he wanted to see… \"Hi Sawyer\" said Scarlett with her flirtatious smile. \"Hello…\" Sawyer answered, immediately feeling stiff. \"Listen. I have a great idea!\" \"Oh you do, do you?\" She put her hand on his shoulder. Sawyer wanted to shake it off, but for some reason he couldn't. \"Totally! There's a very special event coming up. I was thinking, we could go there together.\" She put both her arms around him. Sawyer tried to shake them off. \"Actually…\" \"Yes?\" Hazel's POV Hazel was on her way to see Sawyer and ask if this almost kiss meant something to him. She wasn't half way there but her heart was already pounding like crazy. What if he said no? What would she do then? If Scarlett ever found out about this, she would never leave Hazel alone! No, no! She couldn't think about Scarlett right now! That would only distract her from what she needed to do. She saw the familiar neighborhood of houses where Sawyer lived and picked up her pace. She wanted to talk to him today. A small smile had somehow managed to sneak up on her face but was immediately destroyed by what she saw when she got to Sawyer's house. Sawyer stood outside, and so did Scarlett. She had her arms around him and was pretty close. She felt tears forming in her eyes and her heart felt like it was cracking. Her breathing became faster and before she knew it, she was hyperventilating. Hazel turned around on the spot and started to run back home. Why? Why would Sawyer do that to her? Sawyer's POV \"I'm going with someone else\" Sawyer said and forced her to release him. \"What!?\" \"Yes. So leave me alone, please.\" Sawyer didn't leave her time to say or do anything else, he took his bike and rode off to the CMA again. Hazel wasn't in the CMA itself, so he asked Clay where she was. \"Well, at first she said she was going to see you, and then she returned a little while later. She said she was going to the beach, she did look a little upset.\" \"I'll talk to her.\" So now, he took off to the beach to find Hazel. He knew where on the beach she liked to be. It was the same place they almost kissed the day before. When he got there he saw a sulking figure sitting on the beach, and he realized it was Hazel. \"Are you okay?\" he asked and sat down next to her. She didn't look at him and when he tried to put him arm around her she refused to let him do it. \"Are you mad at me?\" \"Don't know how you could be getting that idea.\" He could hear how much her voice cracked and that she held in tears that desperately wanted out. \"Well, it looks like you are. Can't you just tell me what's wrong?\" She suddenly stood up. \"You know, I'll tell you 'what's wrong'!\" Sawyer stood up too, though a couple of feet away. \"Yesterday, we almost kissed, and I thought it actually meant something. I thought we had something. So I went to talk to you about it. And when I get there, you're all cozying up with Scarlett out of everyone! You told me you didn't like her at all, but it looks to me like you lied!\" She almost screamed the last words out. \"Hazel! I didn't lie about anything!\" \"Oh you didn't?\" \"No! Scarlett tried to flirt with me, and whatever you think you saw was wrong! I told her to leave me alone because I want to be with someone else! You! I want to be with you !\" Hazel didn't say anything at first, she just looked startled the first second. Then she almost ran towards him, cupped his face, pulled him down to her height and kissed him softly. Sawyer immediately responded by putting his arms around her waist. Her lips were soft and tender against his as he kissed her back. They were both smiling like crazy when the kiss broke, and Hazel rested her forehead against his chest for a moment. \"I have a question\" said Sawyer and removed a tear from Hazel's cheek with his thumb. \"What?\" Hazel answered and entwined their hands. \"Will you go to the prom with me?\" Hazel's face lit up even more. \"Like as a date?\" \"Yes, as a date.\" \"Yes! I would love to! Yes!\" She kissed him again. Sawyer held her tight when she broke the kiss and just hugged him. The day turned out good in the end. He had the date to prom he'd been dreaming of, and maybe that date was even a girlfriend? FLUUUUUUFF! Finally! The kiss! Yay! ; ) And a prom date! What do you think? Please hit the review button! Thanks! See you soon in \"Shopping\"! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Studentbal (Prom) Well, the direct translation is \"Graduation ball\" but it is the same thing as the Prom.[Chapter 15] Hello! :D So it's getting closer and closer to the actual prom! But this chapter is all about one of my favorite parts of it. Shopping! Enjoy, you guys! Chapter 15 – Shopping Hazel's POV The smile never left Hazel's face. She couldn't believe what had happened a few days ago. She and Sawyer kissed, and she had a date for prom! She never thought she'd actually attend a high school prom, since she had been homeschooled her whole life. And Hazel hadn't really thought about it either, but now that she was in fact going to go, she couldn't stop thinking about it. Every time she and Sawyer had met up in CMA or outside, he had greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. They weren't a real couple, at least not yet. She wished they were, and maybe they would be after the prom. Another thing struck her mind as she helped with the cleaning of little fish aquariums. The prom was this coming Saturday, and she didn't have anything fancy to wear! Which only meant one thing. It was time to go shopping! But with who? Her dad was out of the question, Hazel didn't think he would be the best fashion adviser. And it would be a little awkward asking Lorraine or Phoebe. But maybe Julia would want to go, she did go to the same school as Sawyer so chances were that she was going to the same prom. Hopefully. She hadn't known Julia for that long but they were friends, so hopefully she would say yes. She knew that Julia was helping out with Herbert, the eel that got stuck in the crab trap. He was rehabilitating fine and would soon be released but Julia had grown fond of him. \"Hey, Julia!\" said Hazel as she walked over to her during the lunch break. \"Hi!\" Julia answered and gave her a quick hug. \"Herbert's doing great I see.\" \"Yeah… I'm really going to miss him when he goes.\" \"But he's going home.\" \"Yeah I know, but still…\" \"Yeah, I understand.\" Julia smiled at her. \"I have a question.\" \"Oh?\" \"Yeah. First some background info. Sawyer asked me to prom!\" Julia squealed in a very high pitch and gave Hazel a bone crushing hug. \"Oh my god! I'm so happy for you!\" \"Thank you! So… Do you want to go dress shopping with me?\" \"Yeah! Of course! I haven't gotten my dress either, so that's perfect.\" \"Okay, when?\" \"Can you later today?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okay! Good, here have my number in case we lose each other over the day.\" Julia wrote down her number on Hazel's phone. XXX Hazel called Julia later that day and they decided to meet up in the mall. One of Hazel's favorite boutiques was placed there and she hoped to find something in it. \"So\" started Hazel as they walked through the mall towards the right shop. \"Do you have a date?\" \"Well, sort of…\" Julia answered slowly. \"Sort of?\" \"Yeah. I wish I had like a guy to go with but I don't, no one asked me.\" \"I'm sorry.\" \"No, don't worry. I have two girls I hang with in school and they don't have anyone either. So we decided that us three would go together.\" \"It actually sounds fun.\" \"Yeah, but I still wished I had this tall, dark and handsome guy to go with.\" \"I'm sure you'll find someone one day.\" \"I think so too.\" Soon they were at the right place. Julia immediately got super excited and almost ran towards the first stack of dresses. Hazel followed her and they both started to look around. There were a lot of beautiful dresses but at first none of them screamed out her name. Eventually she picked out a bunch of beautiful dresses to try on, and Julia had done the same. She took the first dress and walked into the dressing room to change. The first dress was white, with a mermaid fit, halter neck and lots of bling. \"What do you think?\" Hazel asked as she stepped out to show Julia. She tilted her head and didn't look pleased. \"It's great, but it's not you\" Julia answered. \"I think you need more colors.\" \"Agreed. Next one?\" Julia handed her dress number two. This one had a dusty rose, pink color. It was also a mermaid fit, with off the shoulders t-shirt length sleeves and ruffles down at the skirt. The look on Hazel's face said it all when she walked out. No! \"No\" was the first thing Julia said too. \"The color doesn't fit you and come to think of it, neither does the fit of this dress.\" \"Maybe, we should drop the mermaid angle and go for something less fitted?\" Hazel suggested.\" Julia handed her dress number three. The third dress was all tulle. It had a sweetheart neckline, an a-line skirt and a bling belt in the waist, the color of it was dark purple. \"What do you think or feel\" Julia asked when she was shown the third dress. \"'Cause we both know how the dress looks since we see it on the hanger but the important thing is how you like on yourself and not the hanger.\" \"I like the model, but the color is a bit dark for me\" Hazel said. She tried on well over ten dresses in almost every color and fit imaginable. When they didn't find anything for Hazel, they decided that Hazel would be the fashion adviser for Julia. Julia had a number of dresses to try on, mostly in brighter colors but there were a few black dresses, though she soon rejected them after deciding that she wanted something bright and simple. The fifth dress that Julia tried on was the one. Hazel immediately saw it in Julia's eyes when she stepped out, her whole face was glowing. It was in a pale yellow color and entirely made of chiffon. It was empire style, the skirt went down to the knees in the front but became longer and longer in the back. It had a v-neckline and spaghetti straps, with a bling belt. \"Maybe we should come back later\" Hazel suggested as Julia paid for her dress. \"If you want to\" Julia answered. Hazel looked around one final time, ready to say goodbye for now when something caught her eyes. One dress a on the hanger did scream out her name. \"Or maybe not\" Hazel said and started walking like hypnotized towards the dress. As soon as Julia had paid she walked after her. Hazel took the dress of the hanger and held it up so that Julia could see it. A smile spread across her face and she nodded. \"You have to try it!\" Julia said. The same smile as Hazel had seen across Julia's face when she had found her dress now spread across Hazel's as she zipped up the back. This is the one! \"You look so beautiful…\" Julia breathed. \"Thank you…\" Hazel said and admired the dress in the mirror. It was in a minty-green-turquoise color, with a sweetheart neckline. The bodice was in satin and had a drop waist that was shorter on one side and longer on the other. The skirt was an a-line and in chiffon. A pattern of bling stripes was draped around the bodice. The skirt was a little special. It was several layers of chiffon, in the same shade as the bodice but also a more green shade, making the skirt shift slightly darker in color. \"It's the one isn't it?\" Julia asked. \"It is, I feel beautiful.\" \"Sawyer will love it.\" \"You think so?\" \"I don't think, I know. He would be an idiot if he didn't love it.\" Hazel laughed. After Hazel against her will changed back, she didn't want to, they walked over so that Hazel could pay for the dress. A feeling of joy filled her as she knew that she was going to wear it. But the fun wasn't over yet. They still needed shoes to match. Hazel wanted a pair of shoes that matched the color of the dress, but they didn't have to be over the top, since they wouldn't be visible under the dress. Julia's shoes on the other hand would be visible so she said she wanted a pair of shoes with a big wow-factor since the dress was pretty simple. They both soon found the perfect shoes for their looks. Julia went with a pair of golden stilettos with a lot of bling in traditional diamond style and ruby style. Hazel on the other hand went with a pair of silver pumps with bling details. They both had their outfits, and Hazel couldn't be happier at the moment. Soon she would wear this, soon she would attend the prom with Sawyer and be happier than ever before. So… What do you think about Hazel's dress? This isn't a dress I found online, I designed it myself. It was a long process but in the end I think it was a good result. I posted my designs on my tumblr blog Fandom-geek17! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Klänning (Dress)[Chapter 16] Hey everyone and Happy Easter! First of all, I'm sorry it took so long to update! I've had so much going on and I've really tried. I wanted this chapter to be perfect, so I've worked a lot with it and it's really long; over 3000 words. I hope you like it! Enjoy! :D Chapter 16 – Prom Hazel's POV Hazel stared at her dress that hung neatly on a hanger on the door. In just a few hours she would be wearing both it and her new shoes. Watching it made her smile, but knowing that she would soon be with Sawyer at the prom made her smile even bigger. She smiled pretty much all day as it went by, it didn't even go away when she was ordered to take out the trash full of rotten fish. Sawyer had an equally goofy and joyful smile on his face every time they met during the day. Usually her dad didn't let her go until later but today, since she needed time to get ready, as did Sawyer, he let them both go at 3pm. The prom started at six and ended at midnight. Sawyer and Hazel stood outside the CMA. \"So, I'll see you soon\" Sawyer said. Hazel nodded. \"Three hours\" she answered. \"Lorraine's driving us, right?\" \"Exactly. She'll be here to pick you up at 17:45.\" \"Alright, perfect!\" \"Well, I gotta go now, I have to get ready.\" \"So do I.\" \"I'll see you in a few hours, then.\" Sawyer leaned in and gave her a careful kiss on the cheek. \"Bye.\" \"Bye.\" Hazel walked into the houseboat. When she got inside she just walked around in the living room with her hand on her forehead. Three hours to get ready, well almost three hours. And she's doing it all herself. Hazel started by taking a shower and washing her hair. While it dried she fixed her nails and let them dry. After that she curled her hair and put it into a half updo with some bobby pins and a jeweled hair comb. She put some make up on, the eye shadow was silvery-gray and some soft pink, accompanied by a thin line of eyeliner and mascara. Her lip gloss had a coral shade and she also had some blush on her cheeks. Then it was time for the dress. As she looked at the watch on her desk she saw that she had half about fifteen minutes to get ready until Lorraine would be there to pick her up and drive her and Sawyer to prom. After she slipped into her dress she put her shoes on, she'd been breaking them in ever since she bought them, walking around in them inside the houseboat. Hazel started walking around in her room, thought not to break the shoes in, but out of nerves. \"Okay, okay, be calm, don't ruin the makeup, don't ruin the dress!\" Hazel whispered to herself. She stopped in front of the mirror and just stared at herself. She felt beautiful, but she was sweating like a sinner in church. Hazel opened a window, hoping to get some air and feel fresher. But the afternoon sun didn't help. In just a few minutes they would be here. Sawyer's POV Sawyer's breath got deeper and deeper as the car drove closer and closer to the CMA, the Haskett houseboat and Hazel. For now he sat in the front but then he would sit in the back with her. His mom Lorraine drove happily. As they pulled in, Sawyer took a harder grip on the corsage he bought for Hazel, but then he immediately released the grip, afraid to destroy it. \"It'll be fine\" Lorraine said when the car stopped. \"You've been waiting for this for weeks.\" \"Yeah… I'm just nervous.\" \"I'd be surprised if you weren't. Now go! Or you'll be late.\" Sawyer gave his mom a nervous smile before he stepped out of the car. The suit felt a little bit weird on him, very formal, he wasn't used to formal. He took a deep breath before he knocked on the door. Dr Clay opened. \"Hello, Sawyer\" he said. \"You look handsome, buddy.\" Sawyer felt himself blush and looked down for a second then looked up again. \"Thank you, Clay\" Sawyer answered. \"I'll get Hazel.\" Dr Clay walked away to fetch Sawyer's date. Sawyer felt his palms sweating and quickly dried them off on his pants. Hazel's POV Hazel tried to make some final touches but almost only because she wanted something to do until Sawyer and Lorraine got here. \"Hazel?\" Hazel heard her dad say outside her door. \"Come in\" Hazel answered in a nervous tone. Her dad opened the door. When he saw her, he almost got teary and Hazel smiled at him. \"You look beautiful, honey. Just like your mother.\" \"Thank you, dad.\" \"Sawyer is here.\" \"Oh… Do I look okay?\" \"Like I just said, you look beautiful, but I want to give you something before we go out there.\" \"What?\" Her dad held out a small jewelry box. \"This belonged to your mother, I want you to wear it, and she would have too.\" Hazel opened the box to reveal a beautiful necklace, perfectly matching her dress. It was a silver chain with a teardrop shaped diamond and small solitaire diamonds outlining it. Hazel felt her eyes tearing up and took several deep breaths to force them back, she didn't want to ruin the makeup. \"It's so pretty, I love it. Thank you.\" Clay took the necklace out of the box and helped Hazel fasten it around her neck. \"Now go! Your Prince Charming is waiting anxiously for you!\" Hazel gave a small laugh and walked out the door, with her dad following behind. Sawyer's POV When he saw her, his jaw dropped. She was without a doubt, the most beautiful girl he'd ever met. Of course he already knew that, but it had never been more clear. Her face glowed, the dress looked amazing and her whole appearance was just breathtaking. \"Hi\" she said with a nervous smile. \"Hi\" Sawyer answered, still stunned by her beauty. \"You look absolutely beautiful, Hazel.\" \"Thank you, you very look very handsome.\" Sawyer leaned in slightly, but then hesitated. He looked apologetically at Clay. Hazel smiled knowingly and looked at her dad too with a raised eyebrow. \"Oh…\" he said, catching on. \"I'll just give you two some privacy then. Have fun, both of you.\" He kissed Hazel on the forehead before walking into another room. Hazel smiled at Sawyer, who now leaned in and didn't stop until their lips touched in a sweet kiss. \"We should go\" Sawyer whispered as they broke the kiss. \"But one more thing. I got one of these corsages.\" He showed the corsage he bought for her. \"It's so pretty. Thank you.\" \"Let's go\" Sawyer said after he put the corsage on her wrist. Lorraine was just as stunned as Sawyer was when Hazel stepped into the car. Sawyer and Hazel held hands all the way, no one said anything, nor did they have to. It was a perfect silence. Sawyer never grew tired of looking at Hazel, the astounding beauty. She had a joyful and expectant smile on her face. When he looked at her, his face glowed too. He hadn't seen the school since before the prom, but now it was more than obvious that there was a big event there. The whole school was lit up and there were spotlights and balloons outside. The colors of the balloon were blue, green and purple, while the spotlights were red. And the sun hadn't even set yet, though they both guessed that when it did become dark, it would be gorgeous. Sawyer helped Hazel out of the car and she looked around. \"It looks awesome\" she smiled. \"Yeah, they sure went all out\" Sawyer answered. Hazel leaned in and rested her head against his chest as he put his arm around her shoulders. \"You two have fun now\" Lorraine said from inside the car. \"Do you want me to pick you up?\" \"No, you don't have to do that, we can take the bus\" Hazel said. \"Are you sure?\" \"Yeah, don't worry about us\" said Sawyer, smiling. \"Okay, I'll see you in a few hours… Or tomorrow if I fall asleep.\" Sawyer and Hazel chuckled. They watched Lorraine drive away. \"Come on, I want to introduce you to some of my friends\" Sawyer said and grabbed Hazel's hand. They walked together into the school and into the aula. Inside there were even more balloons and the music pumped loud. People were standing around the room, some were dancing, talking, drinking punch and taking pictures. The DJ stood on a podium and danced to the music he was playing. Hazel's POV Sawyer took her through the crowds towards a small group of three students, two boys and one girl. \"Connor!\" Sawyer called. \"Luke, Emma!\" They all turned around, greeted and smiled. \"Hazel, this is Connor, his best friend Luke and his girlfriend Emma.\" Sawyer pointed out every one of them. \"Guys, this is Hazel.\" \"Hi, Hazel\" Connor smiled and shook her hand. \"Nice to meet you.\" \"Likewise\" Hazel answered. \"Sawyer's told us a lot about you\" Emma said and hugged Hazel. She was surprised but hugged her back. \"Has he now?\" she asked, smiling slyly towards Sawyer. \"Oh yes. Like how beautiful he thinks you are, by the way he wasn't kidding; you look great. I love your dress!\" \"Thank you! You look great too!\" \"Thanks! Sawyer also have been really nervous about asking you out, he couldn't stop talking about it and-\" \"Uh, Emma!\" Sawyer exclaimed. \"What?\" she asked. \"You can shut up now.\" \"Oh, sorry!\" Luke finally got a chance to greet Hazel, then the three of them walked away to take some pictures. Sawyer and Hazel decided to do the same and walked over to the photo stand. A man in a blue suit stood behind the camera while the students stood in front of a drape of silver glitter and under an arch of balloons in the same colors as those around. Hazel felt a little bit awkward taking pictures as everyone waited and watched. But when Sawyer stood behind her with his arms around her she felt a little bit calmer. They both smiled to the camera and Hazel was blinded by the flash, she hoped to death that she didn't blink. \"Wanna get a drink?\" Sawyer asked. \"Sure\" Hazel answered. \"It over there, right?\" She pointed towards a stand where a teacher stood and handed out punch to the students. This time Hazel grabbed Sawyer's hand and they walked towards their new destination. The punch tasted strawberry-orange like, and something else, though Hazel couldn't put her mind on what it was. So far there had only been music with a fast beat, though suddenly the tune changed. Now it was a slow song, and Hazel couldn't help but smile when she recognized it as a Disney song. Sawyer grabbed Hazel's hand. \"Dance with me\" he said with a smirk on his face. Hazel smiled at him. \"Okay…\" she answered. They threw their empty cups in the nearest dumpster and walked out on the dance floor. Many couples had now gathered there, including Connor and Emma. Connor winked at Sawyer as he and Hazel walked. \"I'm not a great dancer\" Sawyer said. Hazel laughed lightly, she already knew that. \"I know\" she whispered. \"I got a feeling last time we danced.\" Sawyer chuckled and kissed her on her forehead. The song was they played was \"If I never knew you\", this version however was sung by Shanice. The more the song played, the more she felt herself recognizing herself in the lyrics. It sounded cliché, yes. But it was the truth. Maybe not everything, since they weren't about to be separated for life anytime soon. She hoped at least, but the message of the song, she identified a lot with. Hazel leaned in and rested her head on Sawyer's chest, their joined hands also rested against his chest. She felt how Sawyer rested his head on top of hers as they moved slowly to the song. When it ended, the DJ shifted to a much happier song, almost a little retro in style. The dance style immediately changed and it almost reminded Hazel a little bit of Grease or something alike, at least the dance style from the 50's. Since neither she nor Sawyer really knew how to dance that kind of style it just became a playful, messy version of it, filled with a lot of laughter from both of them. Later the DJ decided to play some more modern songs, and suddenly Hazel found herself surrounded in a giant hug and somebody calling her name. \"Hazel! Hi! Oh my god, you look beautiful! Then again I knew you would, with that dress and your stunning features! I'm so glad you came!\" Julia said it all in one breath. Hazel smiled and hugged her back. \"Hi! Thank you! You look beautiful too!\" she answered. \"Come here, meet my friends.\" Julia took Hazel with her to two other girls, Hazel guessed they were the other two that Julia had her girls night out with. \"This is Mina.\" Mina was a very pretty Asian girl in a black dress with light blue sparkles that smiled and greeted Hazel with a hug just like Emma had. \"And this is Taylor.\" Taylor was a joyful looking girl with dark skin in a white dress. \"Girls this is Hazel, Sawyer's girlfriend and a great friend of mine.\" Hazel blushed slightly when Julia introduced her as 'Sawyer's girlfriend'. She wasn't his official girlfriend, yet… When she looked at Sawyer she saw that he smiled sheepishly and had turned a little pink too. \"We're going to take something to drink\" Mina said. \"Oh, okay\" Julia answered. \"Hey, I love this song! Sawyer do you mind if I steal her from you, during this song?\" \"No, go ahead. I'm gonna go and talk to Luke a little, he looks a little lonely\" Sawyer answered before walking off towards Luke who sat by himself at a table. Julia took Hazel's hand and they walked out on the dance floor and they started dancing to the beat. Sawyer's POV \"Hey\" Sawyer said. \"Hey\" Luke answered. \"Sit down.\" Sawyer took the seat beside him. \"Having fun?\" \"Are you?\" Sawyer asked. It didn't look like it. \"Sometimes.\" \"Sometimes?\" \"I didn't want to come here.\" \"Then why did you?\" \"Connor wanted me to tag along, so I did. I mean, I wanted to go a few months ago, with Krista. But then… Well, you know…\" Luke's eyes slowly turned red but he tried to blink away the tears. Sawyer looked down on his shoes. \"Yeah… I'm sorry…\" \"It's alright. I just thought that we'd at least get this. I didn't think that she would go away so soon. It was too early. For anyone, you know..?\" \"Yeah… It is.\" \"Man, I really hate cars.\" Luke looked at Connor and Emma who were dancing like crazy, and then down again. \"I had what they have, and I didn't want to show up here without it.\" \"Look… I'm not good with these emotional talks, but if you ever want to vent, I'll listen.\" Luke looked up and smiled slightly. \"Thanks, man.\" Luke smile widened. \"On to happier subjects. You and Hazel look great together. You guys official?\" \"No, we're not.\" \"But you want to…\" \"Yes. I do.\" \"Then tell her that. You never know what happens in the future.\" Sawyer looked at Hazel. She smiled, laughed and danced. It was visible that she was a little out of breath from spending time in this aula with almost no oxygen left and dancing in high heels, but she still looked extremely beautiful. He never grew tired of looking at her. Luke was right. They already were an un-official couple, so now the only thing remaining was to be an official one. Sawyer wasn't the only one who wanted to introduce Hazel as his girlfriend. Hazel's POV By the end of the song, Hazel was very out of breath, and also very surprised that she hadn't stepped on her dress yet and ripped it. Which she in turn was very grateful for. Though her bliss wasn't about to last. Someone caught her eye. The last person she wanted to see. Someone who just stood there and stared at her. Hazel was happy that she didn't walk over and said or did anything. But the way Scarlett stared at her wasn't better. There was only one word that could describe the look in her eyes. Evil … It maybe sounded stupid or cliché, but it was the only one she could use. Hazel tried to not look at her but the way Scarlett stared with pure hatred in her eyes almost intimidated her. \"Who's that?\" Julia asked, she also had noticed the evil eye coming from the other side of the aula. \"I haven't seen her before.\" \"Just some girl\" Hazel answered, right now she didn't want to think about Scarlett or anything associated with her. \"She moved in a while ago, I don't know if she goes here or if she came with someone else.\" \"Why is she looking at you like that?\" \"I don't know…\" But she did. XXX Hours passed on, and Hazel even forgot about the fact that Scarlett was there since she didn't do anything, and also the fact that she didn't surprised her. Hazel spent every minute with Sawyer. It had been one of the best nights of her life. The sun had set and she and Sawyer were taking a walk outside the school, first and foremost because they both needed oxygen, but also because the school looked beautiful with all the lightings in the dark. They walked hand in hand and Hazel leaned her head against Sawyer's arm. \"I've had a really great time, tonight\" Hazel whispered. \"Me too…\" Sawyer whispered back. \"Thank you…\" Sawyer stopped in his tracks when they came back to the school. He stood in front of Hazel and held both of his hands in his. Hazel looked up in his beautiful eyes. He smiled at her and she smiled back. \"I have a question\" he said. \"What?\" Sawyer took a deep breath and was slightly flushed. \"Do you want to be my girlfriend? Like officially?\" Hazel smile widened, she felt a strong tingle in her stomach. She put her arms around Sawyer's neck. \"Yes. I really want that.\" Sawyer leaned in, still smiling and they both closed their eyes as their lips touched. It was a sweet, gentle kiss. Sawyer cupped Hazel's face with one of his hands while the other rested on her waist. Their first kiss as an official couple. Like it? Please review! Leave a thought, some criticism or something. To be continued in \"Threat\". Simple Swedish of the chapter: Pojkvän – Boyfriend Flickvän – Girlfriend :D[Chapter 17] Hey everyone out there! So, I'm finally back with a new update! How you all like it! Enjoy! : ) Chapter 17 – Threat Sawyer's POV When Sawyer woke up on Sunday morning, he found himself never to have been happier. For a moment or two he couldn't recall why, but then he remembered. The girl he'd been secretly in love with for ages was now his girlfriend. His girlfriend, not anyone else's. His! The clock on his nightstand showed that it was already 10:30. Sawyer slowly stepped out of bed, morning weren't his thing even though he had never been happier. He grabbed his phone and typed in a message to Hazel. S: Morning, beautiful! 3 Afterwards he walked out towards the kitchen to eat some breakfast. His mom was up too and happily greeted him good morning over a cup of coffee. His phone beeped. H: Morning! Are you coming to the CMA? 3 S: Yeah, but I just stepped out of bed. I'll be there as soon as I'm finished with breakfast and stuff 3 H: Sleepyhead! I'll see you soon! 3 3 S: See you 3 3 \"You seen happy this morning\" Lorraine said suddenly, bringing Sawyer back from a daydream consisting of only him and Hazel. \"What? Oh, yeah\" Sawyer smiled sheepishly. \"Did you have fun last night?\" \"Yeah, very fun.\" \"Okay, good. So… What happened? Tell me everything!\" \"Well… Stuff happened.\" Sawyer didn't want to talk to his mom about everything that happened. Also, he hadn't told Lorraine about Hazel finally becoming his girlfriend. But in his defense, he hadn't gotten a chance, his mom was already asleep when he got home, and the prom was last night. \"Aren't I allowed to ask?\" Lorraine smiled slyly. \"No…\" \"Oh… Then something did happen.\" Yes. I- I mean no! I mean, how did you know that?\" \"Maternal instinct. Come on, tell me!\" Sawyer sat down with his newly made sandwich next to his mom. \"Well, it was all very fun.\" \"Anything special happen?\" \"Yes… Um, Hazel and I decided to be like, an 'official' couple…\" The goofy grin was back on his face and couldn't wipe it off, nor did he want to. He wanted the whole world to know, even though it was a bit awkward talking about it with his mother. \"Oh, Sawyer! Honey! Congratulations!\" Lorraine ran towards her son and embraced in a bone crushing hug. Sawyer almost lost his breath. \"I'm so happy for you! Does Clay know?\" Sawyer hadn't thought about, but now that it was mentioned, it struck him that he should think about it. And now that he did, it freaked him out! He knew that Clay liked him, and he seemed to be okay with Sawyer taking his only daughter to prom, but how would he react to Sawyer dating his only daughter? He did want the whole world to know, but there was something special about telling the father of a girl he's dating her. \"Um… I actually don't know…\" Sawyer answered his mom. \"I don't know if Hazel has told him or not. Honestly… I hope she has. The thought of being around when he finds out freaks me out.\" \"What? Why?\" \"I don't know how he would react!\" \"Oh, Sawyer! You shouldn't worry about that. You know Clay, and you know he likes you. So why wouldn't he approve of you? He's probably like a son to you. So don't worry about it.\" \"Alright, mom. Anyways, I've got to go. I need to change and then take a bike ride to the man who will potentially skin me alive in like an hour or so.\" \"He won't skin you alive! Have fun.\" Lorraine chuckled a little bit to herself and took a zip of her coffee as Sawyer walked back towards his room. Sawyer changed into a gray shirt and a pair of jeans shorts before he took his bike and rode off to the CMA with his heart pounding hard in his chest. Hazel's POV Hazel happily greeted Sawyer at the personal entrance when he arrived. \"Hello, you\" she said, cupped his face and kissed him. Sawyer's hands instinctively traveled to her waist. Hazel felt so happy when she was with him. She wondered why they hadn't started dating before. \"Come on! Since they showing is canceled today we have some other tasks to attend to. We're going to help with David, the shark we rescued the other day. And also we're releasing Herbert today. Poor Julia is quite sad.\" They walked together towards the rehab centre where they attended David. The poor thing had injured both its fins, but the team of miracle workers had already done everything they could and he was rehabilitating fine. Hazel and Sawyer mostly helped with food and bringing and leaving things for the team since Clay didn't want them in the water with a shark even though it was a small one. XXX Later in the afternoon, they packed Herbert the eel in a portable aquarium and rode off to the beach. Since it was such a small animal, there were only Hazel's dad, herself, Sawyer and Rebecca. She and Sawyer sat in the back, she wanted to lean her head against his shoulder, but since she hadn't told him about them dating yet, she thought it would be weird. Sawyer didn't make any effort to do anything either. Hazel had a feeling that he suspected that her dad didn't know about them yet. And if he did, he was right. Rebecca held Herbert's aquarium as they stepped out of the car. They walked out towards the water. There wasn't any people watching today, then again they hadn't made any fuss about it. Rebecca and Hazel walked out with Herbert, with Sawyer and Hazel's dad stayed on the beach. Sawyer's POV \"So, did you and Hazel have fun last night?\" Clay asked as he and Sawyer stood back and watched who Hazel and Rebecca released the eel into the water. \"Yes!\" Sawyer answered almost a little too fast, suddenly more eager than usually to make a good impression and show that he always treated Hazel well. \"We had a great time.\" \"That's good. Hazel was smiling all morning. She didn't tell me why. But I guess you know?\" Sawyer felt how his breath became shallower but he tried hard to hide it. If Clay didn't know why Hazel was so happy, then she hadn't told him about them yet. He didn't want to tell him like this, he wanted Hazel to be with him, then he would feel calmer. So he lied. \"Um, maybe…\" Well, he sort of lied. \"But I think she wants to tell you herself. \"Oh… I understand.\" That was close! XXX Sawyer and Hazel were on their own during the afternoon, cleaning the private aquarium that Herbert had lived in during his time at the CMA. \"Hazel?\" Sawyer asked. \"Yes?\" Hazel answered as she rinsed her cloth in a bucket of water. \"You haven't told Clay about us yet, have you?\" Hazel looked at him, she looked worried but at the same time suspicious. \"I'm not scolding!\" he added quickly. \"I'm just asking, I just want to know, so I know if I can speak freely about it, or kiss you or you know around him.\" Hazel's expression softened. \"No haven't, not yet. I want to but I thought it would be better if we told him together. Have you told Lorraine?\" \"Yeah. Yeah, I told her this morning.\" \"Okay…\" Hazel dropped her cloth in the water and sat down next to Sawyer on a chair. \"So we tell him this afternoon?\" \"Alright. How will he react?\" \"Probably well, he likes you.\" Hazel leaned in and put her hand on the nape of Sawyer's neck. \"Where's Clay?\" Sawyer murmured. \"In his office, not anywhere near…\" Sawyer quickly nodded and then pressed his lips onto hers. It was a very short kiss, but sweet. Hazel then rested her head on his shoulder as he hugged her. XXX They walked together towards Clay's office. Sawyer clutched Hazel's hand quickly before she knocked on the door. \"Come in\" Sawyer heard Clay answer. \"Hey, guys. What's up?\" Hazel sat down and nodded to Sawyer to do the same. Sawyer did as she asked. He could feel his heart beating. This was it. Now Clay would know, and he hoped to god he would take it well. \"Dad, we have something to tell you\" Hazel said, her voice quite steady. \"What?\" \"Sawyer and I… Last night, at the prom, we decided to start dating.\" Clay looked up from the paper he was signing. His eyes were mostly on Sawyer who tried to smile confidently, but the truth was, that he had regained all the coyness he had as an 11 year old. \"Oh… Wow, okay. That's good. So you are happy, I assume.\" \"Yes, we are\" Sawyer said suddenly, his confidence partly back. \"Well, alright then. Congratulations.\" He smiled at them both. \"Sawyer can I talk to you real quick?\" \"What about me?\" Hazel asked. \"I need to talk to Sawyer.\" Hazel stood up and walked out, leaving Sawyer behind. Clay put away the paper he was working with along with his pen. \"You don't have to look so scared.\" Clay winked. Sawyer felt somewhat relieved, but was still nervous. \"I've known you for many years now, Sawyer.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You don't have to start calling me 'sir' all of a sudden, buddy.\" Clay winked again. \"Like I said, I've known you a long time, and I like you. I trust you, which I trust that you will never hurt my daughter.\" \"Clay I can promise you, that I will never hurt your daughter intentionally. And If I do, intentionally or not, I'll let you do whatever you want to. I am in love with your daughter, and all I want is your permission to be with her.\" Clay smiled at him. Sawyer didn't know what made him blurt it out, he usually didn't do things like that, but he meant every word. \"Well you have it. Congratulations. But if you hurt her you are not allowed near her.\" Hazel's POV Hazel sat on a chair outside her dad's office, waiting for Sawyer to come out, eventually he did. \"Hey!\" she said. \"How'd it go?\" \"Good.\" \"Her warned you, didn't he?\" Hazel smiled lightly as she stood up from the chair. Sawyer put his arms around her neck. \"Yep… But I'm glad he did, it shows how much he loves you.\" Hazel's smile grew bigger. \"Want to come over to my place?\" \"I would love to. I just want to take a shower real quick to freshen up.\" \"Okay, do you want me to wait? I can if you want me to.\" \"No, no it's okay. Go on, I'll be there as soon as I'm done.\" \"You're sure?\" \"I'm sure.\" Sawyer smiled and kissed her on the nose before he said goodbye for a little while and then started walking towards his bike while Hazel strode of to the houseboat. She was so glad that he knew, and that Lorraine knew too. Now they wouldn't have to spend their relationship sneaking around, stealing kisses while nobody was looking. But most of all, she was so thrilled that she and Sawyer finally had admitted their feelings for each other. She'd thought it before, and she would many times again. Why haven't we done this sooner? Hazel thought about their first kiss and it made her smile. She remembered being to heartbroken and sad that day, all because of that Scarlett. And she was so sure that Sawyer liked her, but now she knew. Sawyer's heart was set on her. The way Sawyer had talked about how he wanted to be with her almost made her squeal like a love crazy school girl. But that's what she was, she realized, chuckling lightly to herself and then continued down the path towards Sawyer's house. \"Hey!\" the voice was hard, cold and it came from a girl. Hazel woke up from her thoughts and saw a familiar face. Her favorite person on earth. Scarlett… \"Scarlett\" Hazel just answered, she had no interest in talking with this person. \"You better back off!\" \"Excuse me? From who?\" \"Well who do you think? Sawyer! You are as dumb as you look, aren't you.\" Hazel knew it was a rhetorical question, she didn't answer it. \"You can't make me do anything.\" \"Oh, yes I can! Stay away from him! He's mine! Do you hear that, Hazel? Mine!\" \"Last time I checked, he wasn't into you. And did you ever think about that maybe the reason he isn't is because you act this way. He's my boyfriend, Scarlett. And you can't change that.\" Hazel was surprised how calmly her voice came out while she was boiling inside. Then Scarlett did something Hazel never thought she would do. She slapped her! Right across the cheek, and really hard too. Hazel could feel how all the blood that was pumped away when she received the strike was slowly coming back, along with the violent pain. She already felt how red her cheek had become. \"Listen here, Slag! Sawyer's mine so back off! Or I will get you!\" Scarlett stormed off. And Hazel stood there for a moment. The tears had come too. This time she didn't even try to hide them as she started walking towards Sawyer's house which was just two houses away. When she got there, she didn't walk up the lawn and ring the bell. What would she say? She definitely couldn't say that the bitch had just struck her. \"Hazel?\" She recognized it as Sawyer's concerned voice. She didn't look at him, she looked at the ground to that her hair would cover up her cheek. Sawyer's steps became louder and louder, so Hazel understood that he was walking towards her. \"What's wrong?\" Sawyer tilted her face upwards and put her hair behind her ear, revealing her red cheek. \"Oh my god! What happened to you?\" \"Nothing, I fell\" Hazel lied. \"No you didn't. I'm definitely not a doctor, that's my mom's job, but I do know that if you did fell , then there would be a bruise on your cheek, not a red marking. So, what happened?\" \"Nothing!\" \"Okay, you don't want to tell me, I get it. But will you at least let my mom look after it?\" Hazel nodded slowly, and icepack on her cheek didn't sound so bad right now, it had started to burn, which probably meant it was swelling. Great… But what was worse, is that she had no idea what to do next… Dun, dun duuun! People have requested that Scarlett should hurt Hazel in some way. This was the only thing I could come up with that fitted the storyline for now. More will come. To be continued in \"Second date\". Please review! :D Simple Swedish of the chapter: Tandpetare – Toothpick. (Really random and weird, I know, but I'm tired right now. It's way past my bedtime, it's like 00:30 or something, my time zone.) Good night! :D[Chapter 18] Hey! Sorry it's been awhile since I last updated, I know. I'm sorry! I hope to get the next chapter out quicker! But since I can't seem to hold that promise, we'll see. ; ) But anyways, here's chapter 18! Enjoy! Chapter 18 – The second date Hazel's POV Hazel had been Sawyer's girlfriend for a week now, which meant that it was about a week ago that Scarlett had hit her in the face. Now, Scarlett hadn't done anything since that. She said she'd get Hazel if she kept being with Sawyer, which she had. So it worried Hazel that Scarlett hadn't done anything, yet. At the moment she was preparing food for the otters with Julia, while Sawyer trained some new volunteers. Hazel knew that she shouldn't let Scarlett scare her, it wasn't worth it, Scarlett wasn't worth it. But still there was something that told her that soon Scarlett would make her biggest attempt to steal Sawyer away from her yet. And if there was something Hazel had learned over the years, it was to always trust her gut. \"Julia, I need to talk to you about something\" Hazel said as she continued to sort the fish. \"What is it? Is something wrong?\" Julia asked, immediately concerned. \"Has something happened between you and Sawyer?\" \"Well… Sort of, but at the same time no.\" \"Okay, now I'm confused.\" \"I get that. I'll explain. Remember that awful bimbo that tried to take Sawyer away from me?\" \"Yes. Scarlett was it?\" \"Exactly.\" \"Well I don't like that bitch.\" Hazel's mouth pulled slightly upwards. \"Yeah, I don't like her very much either.\" \"So… What about her?\" \"She, uh… She did something.\" \"She did what, Hazel? Tell me.\" Hazel couldn't keep it in any longer. \"She struck me, okay.\" Julia's mouth dropped. A lot of the color on her face disappeared as her eyes filled with concern. \" What? Where? \" Hazel pulled her hair from her face. Scarlett's slap hadn't left a bruise but there was still a light red mark. Even after a week. \"That bitch! Why the hell would she do that?\" \"Because I'm with Sawyer. She wants him.\" Hazel was surprised to hear how steady her voice sounded. She's had been upset about this for a week and every time she had imagined talking about it with someone else other than her own mind, she always thought she'd cry. \"Well, you can't let her get away with this!\" \"I know! But what the heck am I supposed to do? I can't talk to Sawyer about it.\" \"Yes you can.\" \"No I can't. I'm finally where I want to be right now. I have a college application, I have an amazing family, I have the most amazing friend; you and Sawyer and I are finally dating. If I tell him that someone hit his girlfriend to get him… I don't know how he would react! What if he runs scared and dumps me? That would crush my heart!\" \"Tell Dr Clay, then.\" \"No. No, I can't tell dad, he would go crazy. And he asks enough questions as it is. There's only one thing I can do.\" \"What's that?\" \"Show Scarlett that she can't get to me. That I won't stop being with Sawyer just because she's crazy.\" Julia nodded slowly. \"That is the right decision for you. I just hope that Scarlett makes the right one too… Because if she doesn't, it's not going to be pretty. Be both know what's she's like and I don't think we've seen the worst of her yet. I mean she's one mean bitch. But what do you think she can do? Slapping you seemed pretty bold and-\" \"Okay you can stop shattering my confidence now\" Hazel suddenly said, cutting Julia off. Julia exhaled. \"Sorry. You know I can't shut up sometimes.\" Hazel smiled slightly at her and leaned in to hug her friend. \"Thanks for listening…\" \"Anytime.\" XXX Sawyer's POV Something was wrong with Hazel. He just knew it. She hadn't said anything, even though he did ask her several times if everything was alright. They hadn't been going out for a long time, but he had a feeling. Ever since she \"fell\", and Sawyer was pretty sure that she didn't fall, she had been more quiet than usual. Usually she talked a lot, she always had. But, he had may just have something to cheer her up. They were walking together along the road, just taking a walk. They were both quiet, in a comfortable silence. Sawyer noticed a small, pink flower on the side of the road. He picked it up and held it in front of her. \"What's that for?\" Hazel giggled as Sawyer gave her the flower. \"Nothing, really…\" Sawyer responded. \"Okay it's a substitute for a rose, because I don't see any around.\" \"That's sweet, why this gesture? Are we celebrating something?\" \"Well…\" Sawyer started as he put his arms around her shoulders, Hazel responded immediately by putting her arms around his waist. Sawyer smiled at how natural it felt for them to put their arms around each other. \"Since you asked. Something did cross my mind the other day.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Yeah. I remembered that I haven't taken you out on a second date yet.\" \"You are incredibly sweet, you know. Really, but you don't have to do that. We're already together.\" \"I know, but maybe I want to spoil you a little. Dinner? Tonight?\" \"Okay…\" Hazel released herself from Sawyer, only to put her arms around his neck, and then she stood up on her tippy toes to kiss him. \"It's a date.\" \"I'll pick you up at six, if that's okay.\" Hazel nodded and then they walked hand in hand back to CMA, and then Sawyer took his bike and rode back home. XXX Hazel's POV Since Hazel didn't know which restaurant it was, or if they would just be eating at Sawyer's house, she had to pick an outfit that worked for most occasions. She quite quickly picked out a light blue skirt that ended just above the knees. Then a tank top with a pink and purple pattern. To add a little more glamour she paired it with a lace cardigan and a pair of heels. Her dad knocked on the door. \"Honey, it's almost six.\" \"Yeah, I know. Thanks, dad\" Hazel responded as she out some of her hair out of her face with a hair pin. \"Okay. Do you know where he's taking you?\" \"No… Only that we're eating somewhere.\" \"Alright, you look great.\" \"Thanks. But I feel a little guilty.\" \"What? Why?\" Her dad looked confused. \"Well, Sawyer has been so sweet and taken me out to both his prom and now this. And I haven't done anything for him.\" \"Well maybe you can some time.\" \"Yeah…\" Suddenly there was a knock on the door. \"Oh, Sawyer's here!\" Hazel straitened her skirt before walking past her dad and answering the door. Sawyer stood smiling outside, dressed in a pair of dark trousers and a light blue shirt. \"Hey, beautiful\" he said. Hazel smiled as Sawyer leaned in to kiss her. \"Shall we go? I hope it's okay that we're taking the bus. I still don't have a car.\" He looked a little apologetic. \"Of course it's alright. I don't care if we take the bus or if you don't have a car. I'm just going to get my purse and then we're off.\" Sawyer nodded as she went inside for a couple of seconds. When she returned to Sawyer she looked in another direction for a split second, but she immediately regretted it. She thought she saw something, or someone . Someone who creepily stood watching them about ten yards away. \"Is something wrong?\" Sawyer asked, seeing the look of worry on her face. Hazel shook her head quickly and flashed a smile. \"No, of course not. Come on let's go.\" She grabbed Sawyer's hand and steered him towards the bus stop. XXX Hazel had a look of awe of her face as she saw the restaurant she and Sawyer would be eating at. She had never been inside it but ever since it opened a year earlier she had wanted to go. \"You like it?\" Sawyer asked a little nervous as they walked in hand in hand. \"It's perfect, Sawyer, really!\" She gave him a kiss on the cheek before a waitress came and showed them to their table. It was a perfect seating, just near a window with just the right amount of sun streaming in and a perfect amount of guests. They sat down across each other. \"It really is as beautiful as I imagined here\" Hazel said. \"Yeah, it's great. I was here with mom, like a month ago, I think.\" Just then another waitress came over. \"Do you want something to drink?\" she asked with a smile. Sawyer nodded towards Hazel, monitoring her to start. \"Uh, I'll take a coke, please\" Hazel said. \"Perfect, and you?\" The Waitress asked nodding towards Sawyer. \"I'll take a coke too\" Sawyer smiled. \"Alright. Feel free to look through the menu, and I'll be back with your drinks.\" \"Thank you\" Hazel said as the waitress walked away. Hazel felt really content as she looked through the menu, there was so many different things to choose between. Meat, chicken, fish, shellfish, vegetarian. But it wasn't the food that made her feel content. It was the feeling of sitting here with the best boyfriend in the world, at this perfect restaurant, knowing that they would have the whole summer together. \"What do you want to eat?\" Sawyer asked. \"I don't know, there's so much to choose from. What did you have when you were here with your mom?\" \"Steak and fries.\" \"Sounds like you.\" Hazel winked at him. Sawyer held up his hands. \"Steak's good, I tell you.\" \"Agreed. I just like to tease you.\" \"Thanks.\" They both laughed and continued to look through their menus. After a couple of more minutes the waitress came back with their drinks. \"Are you ready to order\" she asked.\" \"No, I just need a minute or two, I'm sorry\" Hazel answered. \"Don't worry. Take your time, I'll be back.\" After a little while of mental debating, Hazel was ready to order. Sawyer had chicken and rice, while Hazel had pasta bolognaise. And soon plates with hot food were served. They talked, joked and laughed, and Hazel felt like she could sit here forever. Just eating this awesome food and enjoying Sawyer's company. But the bliss was not about to last. \"You little slag!\" Both Hazel and Sawyer looked up with surprised looks on their faces to see Scarlett standing beside their table with a furious look on her face. Hazel could have sworn steam sprayed out from her ears. \"What?\" \"What?\" Sawyer and Hazel said at the same time. \"Scarlett, what are you doing here?\" Hazel asked, trying to remain calm, but all the emotions boiled up the surface. \"What did you call her?\" Sawyer said, his rage rising. \"I warned you\" Scarlett hissed, ignoring Sawyer. \"I warned you to stay away. But you decided not to. Listen here, he's mine, not yours. So drop dead !\" \"Are you crazy?\" Sawyer said loudly and stood up. Scarlett still ignored him. \"I guess hitting you wasn't enough you little whore!\" Scarlett hit Hazel's glass so that the coke spilled on her. \"Hey!\" Sawyer grabbed Scarlett's arm and pushed her away slightly, placing himself between her and Hazel. \"Sawyer please don't make a scene\" Hazel begged, feeling the tears creeping up on her. \"She already has\" Sawyer growled. And that was true. A lot of the guests were now watching the madness going on. Suddenly a waiter came rushing towards them and grabbed Scarlett who now tried to get past Sawyer and get to Hazel. \"Alright, let's take it down a notch\" he said and forced Scarlett to step away. \"What is going on here?\" said the manager whom had appeared from nowhere. She looked sternly from Scarlett to Sawyer and back. \"Are you alright?\" She offered Hazel a tissue as she now sat in her coke drained clothes with her hand on her forehead, trying to hold the tears back. \"Why help that bitch?\" Scarlett hissed. Sawyer took a leap towards her with his whole body tensed and his eyes burning with rage. But he was stopped by the waiter, he held out his arm to keep them apart. \"Get her out of here! She hit my girlfriend and spilled things on her!\" Sawyer shouted.\" \"Is that true?\" the manager asked. Scarlett didn't answer but the look on her face revealed everything. \"Take her out.\" \"Just wait one second\" Sawyer said. \"You need help, so go and get it. Don't come near us ever again. I'm sick of you! I don't want you, I never have. And if you ever try to hurt Hazel in any way again, I will give you what you deserve for hurting her and ruining our date. Get out of my sight!\" Hazel closed her eyes when they took Scarlett out. She was happy that Scarlett finally got her just dessert, but she was sadder that their date was destroyed. Sawyer apologized for the mess and paid for their food, and then he took Hazel's hand in his own with one and put an arm around her and led her out from the restaurant. There he gave her his shirt to put on to cover the stains, he had a t-shirt under. They took the bus back to Sawyer's house. Hazel knew that Lorraine worked the evening shift and wouldn't be home for hours, which Hazel was grateful for. Lorraine didn't need to have the pressure of knowing all of this. Hazel suspected this was Sawyer's plan, which she loved him for. Hazel borrowed some of Sawyer's clothes as hers were washed, they were very big on her but she didn't care. \"Did she really do that to you?\" Sawyer asked as they sat down in the sofa. Hazel didn't answer. She just sat there. \"Hazel, please answer me.\" \"Yes…\" Hazel answered, barely audible. Sawyer almost lost his breath. He cupped her face. \"The mark on your cheek?\" Hazel nodded. \"Why didn't you tell me?\" \"I don't know… I thought that if you knew you would be scared off or something… And break up…\" \"What? Never! Don't ever keep that kind of stuff from me again…\" Sawyer pulled her into his embrace, and Hazel finally allowed the tears to come out. He comforted her without saying anything else, he didn't need to. Hazel just breathed in his calming scent and knew that Sawyer would always be there for her. Liked it? Leave a review, please! I don't know if it was good enough. I'm not the best when it comes to writing drama. ; ) I'm thinking about writing a Reggsy Kingsman fic. If you have seen Kingsman, what do you think? Most people don't want them to be romantically involved, but I do. Sorry, but to me they're the only reasonable ship. Simple Swedish of the chapter: Romantik – Romance[Chapter 19] HAPPY BIRTHDAY MORGAN FREEMAN! And Hi! ; ) Here's the next chapter in this story! 19 out of 32! Hope you like it. It's a bit shorter than the latest ones, but I feel that this is enough. Enjoy! Chapter 19 – Graduation Sawyer's POV Sawyer looked up into the roof as he tried to fall asleep. The suit hung neatly on the hanger on his wardrobe and the white shirt reflected the moonlight streaming in. Sawyer couldn't sleep for two reasons. First, he still thought about what Scarlett had done to Hazel. He couldn't believe it, every time it crossed his mind his rage boiled. He knew that Hazel was pretty much back to her old self and that she would get over it, he also knew that Scarlett most likely never bother them again, but he wasn't over it. That part would take some time. But Hazel asked him to forget it and only focus on now and forward, and he tried to, for her sake, but it wasn't easy. Second, he graduated high school tomorrow. So a lot of the emotions came from the fact that he was so nervous. He'd only been this nervous a couple of times in his life. When he first entered the CMA when he was eleven, when Winter rejected the prosthetic over and over, when he asked Hazel to prom, and now. Though everyone reassured him that everything would be fine, he still couldn't calm down. But he had to, if he wanted some sleep before the big day. After a while though, he managed to. XXX \"Honey. Sawyer, time to wake up\" his mom whispered. Sawyer slowly opened up his eyes and moaned. \"What?\" he croaked. \"You're graduating today.\" \"Oh… Right…\" \"So you have to get up now, if you want to be ready on time.\" \"Right… I'll be up in five minutes…\" \"Sawyer…\" Promise…\" Alright. Just don't fall asleep again.\" \"I won't…\" Lorraine walked out the door but didn't close it. And Sawyer wouldn't fall asleep. He wouldn't. He wouldn't. He wouldn't… He… Would…n't… \"Sawyer!\" \"What?\" \"You fell asleep again.\" \"Sorry, mom.\" Sawyer sat up in his bed and rubbed his eyes with his palms. \"It's alright. But you really have to get up now. Go and get a shower while I make breakfast.\" Sawyer nodded and stepped out of bed. His entire body filled with cold as soon as he left the warm blankets. He dragged his way to the nearest bathroom and stepped into the shower. He stepped out, and after he changed into a pair of shorts and a loose t-shirt, Sawyer walked into the kitchen. The wonderful smell of eggs and bacon filled his nose. And even though he wasn't much of a breakfast guy immediately after waking up, this made him hungry. \"Bacon and eggs, huh?\" Sawyer asked, pleased, yet surprised. \"We never have that.\" \"Well, my son will only graduate high school once\" Lorraine answered and winked at him. \"So I think we can make this day special.\" \"I'm not arguing.\" Sawyer sat down as he was served a plate of this awesome breakfast. XXX Sawyer sighed as he for the third time tried to tie his tie correctly. A mission he didn't succeed with. In fact, he only made it worse. He got a sudden urge to just take a scissor and just chop it off. But he resisted it. His mom knocked on the door to his rescue. \"How's it going?\" she asked. She had changed too. Into a salmon pink dress with a floral pattern. \"I've never been good with ties\" Sawyer answered and pointed towards the mess around his neck. His mom chuckled and walked up to him and started tying up the weird knot he managed to create. \"What have you done with this?\" \"I don't know!\" Lorraine laughed. \"Well, we are going to get it right. And then we have to go if you don't want to be late for your own graduation.\" \"Wouldn't want that.\" Eventually Lorraine managed to fix the tie and they were off to the car. \"Are you nervous?\" his mom asked as they drove. Sawyer looked at his mom and suddenly realized the importance of what was going to happen, earlier he had been too tired to remember how nervous he actually was, and almost felt how his throat choked up. \"Well I wasn't until you asked\" he answered. Lorraine chuckled. \"Everything is going to be fine. I will be there, you're aunt and uncle will be there, Kyle will too, and Clay and Hazel. And afterwards we are going to celebrate with family and friends. So everything will be alright.\" \"Yeah… I hope so. XXX When inside the school aula and dressed a robe on top of the suit and a bonnet, he sat down next to Luke and Connor, with Emma sitting next to Connor, holding his hand tightly. She reflected the nervousness he was feeling on the inside. Everyone knew how hard Emma had studied and how much she had fought with the finals. So no one could blame her. She so desperately wanted into the same college as Connor had been accepted to. The brain that he was. Though everyone looked happy, including Luke who had a reason not to be. But he did, and that did bring a smile to Sawyer's face. Luke missed Krista, everyone knew that too, but it was a relief to see that he could move on despite all the plans they had. Soon the ceremony started. The principal talked for a while, and then turned over the microphone to one of the seniors. A girl, her name was Eileen and she had been asked to hold the speech. She actually did a good job. She talked about how hard everyone had been working, and how proud they should be over themselves. Also about the fact that even though this is a big milestone in life, there will be more. \"So keep your head up high. Don't forget that other milestones will come\" she said. \"You will graduate college, and move to your own place, get married, have kids. There are so many more things that will happen in our lives. That is why it's important to never give up. And if we ever wonder why, why should we fight? Then think of this moment right now. Think of the joy, the pride and the knowing that we succeeded. We did it! I've heard so many times, 'I can't do this', but we can. And we did. Right now we are all so happy and proud of ourselves. And we can't ever forget this feeling. Whenever you are feeling down, remember high school and think; 'Damn, we actually did it'.\" Everyone laughed and applauded as she stepped down. It really was a great speech, and so much truth to it. Then the principal started calling out names, so that people could walk up the stage and accept their diplomas. Sawyer smiled as Connor, Luke and Emma stepped up and received theirs. They were great friends and he would miss them when they all went away to college. \"Sawyer Nelson\" the principal said. Sawyer took a deep breath and stood up. The room applauded as he took the steps up to the stage. He could see his mom in the crowd, her teary eyes and proud smile. He couldn't help but smile like a goof too. \"Congratulations\" the vice principal said as they shook hands. \"Thank you\" Sawyer answered. He walked over to the head principal and received his diploma. \"Congratulations, young man\" he said and Sawyer shook his hand too. \"Thank you, sir\" Sawyer answered. XXX His family waited outside as he stepped out into the sun on the school yard where everyone was greeted by family and friends. The first to embrace him was his mom, who now cried and didn't seem to ever want to let go of him. \"I'm so proud of you, sweetheart! So, so proud! I love you!\" she said. \"I love you too\" Sawyer said. The next to congratulate him was his aunt and uncle, and then came Kyle in a bone crushing hug too. \"You did, man! I proud of you.\" Next up was Clay who had the face of a proud father, which moved Sawyer's heart a lot. \"Congratulations, Sawyer. You should be so proud of yourself.\" Sawyer turned around to look for Hazel. She had been talking to Julia a few feet away, but when she saw him she excused herself from Julia and her family, and almost ran towards Sawyer who met her halfway. Hazel pulled him done and hugged him. He was happy that everyone cared but the one he was most touched to see there was in fact his beautiful girlfriend. \"Sawyer…\" she whispered. Sawyer released himself from the hug to look at her, though he still had his arms around her waist. \"I don't really know what to say. You've already heard so many 'congratulations' and 'I'm proud of you'. But congrats, and I am proud of you.\" Sawyer smiled and leaned in to kiss her on the forehead. \"Thank you. But congrats, yourself.\" \"What?\" \"Well, I'm not the only one to graduate.\" Hazel laughed and leaned her forehead on his chest for a moment. \"But mine is a homeschooled degree. It's not as fancy.\" \"But the fact that it's yours makes it everything.\" Hazel smiled and leaned in to kiss him. \"My, my\" a familiar voice suddenly said. Sawyer turned around to see Dr McCarthy standing with his family and a bright smile on his face and with his good bow tie on. \"I think even the fish is proud of you today.\" \"Dr McCarthy!\" Sawyer exclaimed. \"You're here?\" \"Yeah. I'm sorry I missed the ceremony, these useless legs aren't as good as they once were.\" \"Don't worry about it! I'm glad you're here.\" \"Congratulations, Sawyer.\" Sawyer shook his hand, but then hugged him. Later they were all off to celebrate at the same party venue they had celebrated Hazel's birthday at. And let me just tell you, that it was a great party! Liked it? Leave a review! To be continued in \"A letter and a gesture\". And Happy Birthday to Morgan Freeman again! Without a doubt, one of the best actors we have in this world! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Födelsedag – Birthday : )[Chapter 20] Hello everyone! I'm back from my little break with another chapter. Very long! Some of you have speculated and I have been thinking. And now I have decided that; no, Scarlett will not be appearing more in this fanfiction. I want to focus on other kinds of drama from now on. I hope you'll all be okay with that. Enjoy the chapter! : ) Chapter 20 – A letter and a gesture Hazel's POV Everything was going perfectly in her life right life right now. She was happy and that bimbo Scarlett was finally out of her life. So now she could focus on something new, something wonderful. Her and Sawyer's one-month anniversary. Now tradition said that the guy was supposed to forget it, the girl would become upset, a fight would break out, and then in the end they would resolve everything and the guy would give the girl a sweet present. But not this time, not with them. Hazel had something else in plan. In the beginning she hadn't even considered it as a present for their anniversary, but it was convenient so therefore it could become it. It was so hard for her to believe that it was already one month ago they went to prom and decided to become a couple. Time had gone by so fast, and except for a few incidents involving a certain person, it was been a perfect month and Hazel was sure that there would be many more months to come. Because as far as she knew, Sawyer didn't plan on leaving her any time soon. She had a day to plan it, okay she had already planned it, but preparing then. Tomorrow was the big day. And since this was the only time they would celebrate a one-month anniversary she wanted to make it special. Since it wasn't like they were going to celebrate every month except maybe a \"Congrats!\" and a kiss on the cheek. It would be far too expensive! But just for this time, she had a bigger plan. The watch on her arm already showed 16:35. She had some free time now in the afternoon, which was perfect. Now she could go to the nearest supermarket and get everything she needed. \"Dad?\" she asked as she knocked on his office door. \"Come in, Hazel\" he answered. \"What's up?\" \"Dad, I have to go away for a little while.\" \"Go away where?\" Suspicion immediately crossed his face. \"To the supermarket.\" \"Oh.\" He looked relieved. \"Did I forget to put something on the list?\" \"No. It's for that surprise we talked about a while back.\" \"Oh that surprise!\" \"Yeah, and added that it's our anniversary tomorrow I want to make it special.\" \"Already?\" \"Yes!\" Hazel felt her smile growing. \"Well congratulations then!\" \"Thank you.\" \"Well off you go then. But I want you home by eleven.\" Hazel promised to be back on time. Then she took her bike and rode off to the nearest Walmart. When she got inside she immediately took a basket and strode off to the isle which contained all kinds of stuff you would need at a party. Like plastic mugs, plates, napkins, balloons and so on. As she searched the items she looked for something that could remind them of their lives. And soon she found it. She found napkin with the illustrations of the ocean. Perfect! And she also picked out some sparkles with the shape of tiny dolphins. Hazel also found plastic champagne glasses which she put in the basket too. After she gathered everything she needed from decorations to ingredients she placed herself in line to pay. She planned a homemade dinner, or picnic. However you wish to look at it. It wasn't as fancy as the restaurant Sawyer took her to, but she heard from magazines, movies, TV and books that the significant other like homemade dinners. XXX When she returned to the houseboat and the CMA she saw somebody she would want to see at any other time but now. Sawyer stood outside the houseboat, talking to her dad. If Hazel came up to them with the bags Sawyer would want to know what she got from the store and why. Immediately she rode off in a different direction. As soon as she had passed the nearest turn and she couldn't see them anymore she stopped and took her phone from her purse. She dialed a number. \" Hello?\" Julia said on the other line as she picked up. \"Hi, it's me\" Hazel answered in a hurry. \"Listen, I need you to save my bacon!\" \" What? What do you mean?\" \"I'm planning this surprise for Sawyer, but he's at the house so I can't just walk in with the groceries.\" \" Aw! That's so sweet! What are you planning? Oh my god!-\" \"Julia focus!\" \" Yeah, sorry. So what do you need me to do?\" \"Like I said, I can't just walk up there with the things I got from the store without giving away my plans. So I wonder if you can keep the stuff at your house, both the decorations and the food if you have the space in your fridge? Just for like an hour or so, until I can get him out of the way. Then I'll stop by and collect it.\" \" Of course. Where are you?\" Hazel told her where she was and ten minutes later, Julia was there to cover for her. Julia took all the things Hazel had got from Walmart and then she took off after rambling on for a minute or two about how sweet everything was. Then Hazel could feel a little calmer when she once again rode off to the boathouse, and Sawyer was still there. \"Hey, there\" he said after he turned his head and saw his girlfriend biking towards them. \"Hi!\" Hazel said as she parked the bike and locked it. \"Where have you been?\" Sawyer kissed her on the top of her head. \"Oh, just with Julia\" Hazel lied quickly. Her father cleared his throat. \"I'll give you two some privacy\" he said. \"Good night, Sawyer.\" He walked inside. \"Wanna go for a walk real quick?\" Sawyer asked. Hazel made a mental sigh. She really did, any excuse to spend time with him, but she couldn't. She had to get Sawyer out of the way and get her groceries from Julia who was waiting at her place. \"Uh… I would, but can't\" Hazel answered, unsure of herself. \"Okay… Why?\" \"I'm- I'm gonna see Julia!\" \"Julia?\" \"Yeah!\" \"But you said you just saw her?\" \"Right. I did, but I promised her I would help her with this thing so I have to go.\" \"Right… Okay… So you're not just trying to get rid of me?\" He tried to look neutral, but Hazel could see that he was suspicious. She tried to redeem the awkward situation by taking his hand and kissing him on the cheek. \"I'm not, but I really have to go.\" Eventually Hazel managed to shake him off, and since she tried to not wake any suspicion she joined him on the way to his house. Then she said good night and rode off as quickly as she could over to Julia's house. Julia's house, well her parents' house was very nice. It was bigger than Sawyer's since it had two floors and it was in different shades of white and a lot of it was built of bricks. Hazel rang the doorbell. \"Come in\" Julia smiled as she opened the door. Hazel followed her friend inside and found that it was just as gorgeous inside. The counter and the cooking island were both made out of marble and the table they had there was mahogany. There were two stoves and fridges, a giant pantry and a shelf with books of cooking, tips and recipes. One super modern looking microwave on top of one just as modern looking oven. The kitchen also contained a TV placed over the counter. Hazel had never seen such a gorgeous kitchen outside of a cooking show. \"My mom really likes cooking\" Julia excused herself, with slightly pink cheek. \"It's brilliant!\" Hazel answered as she looked around in awe. \"I'm glad you like it\" said a voice from behind them. Hazel turned around to see a woman standing there smiling. She was slightly taller than Julia, but she was a little plump. Though her face was warm and welcoming. \"I'm Anne, Julia's mom.\" Hazel and Julia's mom shook hands. \"Hazel. It's nice to meet you\" Hazel said. \"Do you want something to drink or eat? Are you hungry?\" Julia's mom asked. \"Mom!\" Julia whispered as she packed the thing Hazel had bought from Walmart into a bag along with the decorations. \"No I'm fine. I have to go anyway, but thank you\" Hazel answered, smiling. XXX Soon Hazel was back home with all her stuff that she put away in all the right places before going to bed. A small smile curled on her lips, she believed it would be a good day tomorrow. XXX Sawyer's POV \"Sawyer! There's a letter for you!\" his mom Lorraine cried out, happier than normal this morning. \"What?\" he croaked. \"A college letter!\" Sawyer immediately felt wide awake as he almost ran up to his mother and yanked the letter out of her hand. His mom merely smiled at him. \"What does it say?\" she asked. Sawyer's eyes quickly moved from side to side as he read what the letter said. His mouth opened more and more, he tried to say something but couldn't get the words out. A feeling he couldn't quite describe filled him like water in a glass. \"Honey?\" Lorraine asked. \"What does it say?\" \"I-\" Sawyer started. \"I- I got in…\" The message slowly sank in and as it did he felt himself clutching the letter more and more. But not in any angry way, more of a protective way, as if no one was going to steal his spot. \"Mom. I got in. I got in!\" He embraced his mother like he never had before. The joy was shining from him and no one could stop it! He got in! Sawyer couldn't believe it! He got in! He actually got in! \"Oh, Sawyer! Baby, that's great! I'm so proud of you!\" Lorraine cried. As they finally released each other, she checked her watch. \"But you have to hurry up now if you don't want to be late to Winter's first session.\" \"Oh, right, yeah. I'm gonna go and change then.\" XXX Sawyer ran up the stairs to the pools. Hazel stood there, talking to Julia, but in the way she usually did. They were usually very giggly, but not now. Now they looked like they were whispering about something secret, making Sawyer wonder if something bad had happened. Julia turned her head slightly and saw that Sawyer stood there with a puzzled look on his face. She yanked her head discreetly in his direction. Hazel turned around. A smile spread across her face. Not the usual one, a nervous one. \"Hi, Sawyer\" she said as she walked up to him. \"How are you?\" \"I'm fine\" he answered, still looking puzzled. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah, why shouldn't I be?\" \"You look nervous, has something happened?\" \"I do? No, everything's fine, nothing has happened.\" \"Alright\" Sawyer said, although he didn't really believe her. But then he suddenly remembered why he was also so happy. \"Hazel!\" \"Yes?\" Now it was her turn to look puzzled. \"I have amazing news!\" \"That's great, but can you tell me later? We have to prepare for Winter's first session.\" \"Oh, okay…\" Sawyer tried but he couldn't really hide how disappointed he was. XXX Hazel's POV The day went off relatively fast. The session went great. At her lunch break she wanted to plan with her dad and make sure that the place she wanted to surprise Sawyer at would be empty tonight. But Sawyer apparently had other plans. He chased her down the hall. \"What is it?\" she asked as neutral as possible. \"Where are you going?\" Sawyer asked back. \"Talk to my dad, why?\" \"Just wondering. Do you have time for a talk quickly first?\" \"Sure but why?\" \"I have new, remember?\" \"Oh right! What's up?\" Sawyer took a deep breath before telling her. \"I got into college today!\" Hazel gasped. \"Oh Sawyer that's amazing!\" She hugged him tightly. \"Congratulations! But can we celebrate later today, because I really have to talk to dad.\" Sawyer kissed her nose lightly. \"Okay. I'll see you.\" XXX Hazel had to tell I lie at the end of the day. Another lie of why she couldn't be with Sawyer after the CMA. He told her he was fine with it and that he could spend some time with Connor. But Hazel knew he wouldn't, which actually made her feel calm. The last thing she needed was him running off with a friend when she was about to surprise him. As soon as she got inside the she started to bake the dessert. A chocolate-lemon-raspberry cake that her mother used to bake for her birthday. It was already 15.30 so she tried to get a move on. Hazel had texted Lorraine and told her to not eat dinner with Sawyer since Hazel would be cooking for him. As she stood mixing the lemoncurd cream she would use as frosting she received a text from her dark haired man. \" Everything alright, Haiz? :*\" \" Perfect! Talk soon! :*\" Neither of them had mentioned the anniversary during the whole day. It bothered Hazel a little. Well, she had a reason not to but Sawyer didn't. Had he forgotten? Stereotypical boys do, though Sawyer wasn't one. There hadn't been a single 'happy anniversary' from either one of them. And what if Sawyer thought she had forgotten? Would he be mad? Or disappointed? No matter what, she had to push out of her mind for now, if she wanted to be done in time. XXX Eventually Hazel was done. She had taken all of the decorations to the roof, along with a blanket, the food, dessert and a drink. Soda, not alcohol. After she got it all in place, she sent Sawyer a text. Sawyer's POV Sawyer sat and stared at the jewelry box on his desk. It was supposed to be Hazel's for their one month anniversary. But she had been avoiding him all day and hadn't said anything about the special day. So he almost completely lost the urge to give it to her. He couldn't understand what was wrong. Though as the emotional retard he sometimes was, he hadn't asked her about it. So he could suit himself. He heard his phone beep. \" Can you come over? Right now?\" Sawyer immediately worried that something was wrong with her or Winter. He took the box and told his mother where he was going. She merely smiled and told him it was okay. The first thing he noticed when he got to the houseboat was an envelope with his name on it hanging on the door. The roof was the only thing the letter inside said. As there was nothing on the roof of the houseboat and nothing in the crow's nest Sawyer assumed that the sender meant the roof of the CMA. Sawyer hurried up the stairs and corridor past all the animals. When he got to the door that led to the roof he stopped. He hesitated for a moment, but then opened the door. The first thing he saw was Hazel sitting there. She had changed into a purple dress, put her hair up in a half up do and put some make up on. She looked so beautiful. He realized that he was wearing a pair of jeans shorts and a red t-shirt and felt very under dressed. The next thing he noticed was what she was sitting on. A navy blue blanket, and there was also a picnic basket, plates, champagne glasses, a saucepan, candle light, something sparkling, forks, knives and a bottle of coke. \"What is this?\" Sawyer asked. Hazel stood up and walked up to him, she kissed him passionately. \"Happy anniversary\" she whispered. Sawyer smiled at her. \"I thought you forgotten\" Sawyer said and looked into her beautiful brown eyes. She shook her head. \"I just wanted to make something special for you for a change. I've cooked a little something, well, I've tried.\" \"That's good because I'm starving.\" They sat down hand in hand but then had to let go so that Sawyer could sit down opposite her. Then he took out the jewelry box. \"Happy anniversary.\" Hazel took it and opened the lid. It revealed a really pretty necklace. It was a silver chain with a small silver heart with small solitaire rhinestones hanging from it. \"It's beautiful , Sawyer!\" She put it on and kissed him, his hand traveled to her hip. \"Thank you!\" Then they sat down and enjoyed the dinner Hazel had prepared for them. It became the perfect day after all. Enjoyed? If so leave a review! See you soon (hopefully ;) ) Simple Swedish of the chapter: One-month anniversary – En-månads jubileum : )[Chapter 21] Hi friends! Here's chapter 21 for you! A little shorter than the last. But I hope you will like it anyway! Chapter 21 – Rescue Hazel's POV Sawyer and Hazel sat on a blanket at the beach. Well, Sawyer was sitting up, Hazel was lying down with her head in his lap. She held her hand in his and they were playing a silly game with them, trying to capture each other's fingers or drawing imaginary patterns on the back of their hands. For once nothing acute were happening at the CMA so she and Sawyer saw this as the perfect day to take some time off and just enjoy each other's company. Hazel fingered slightly on the necklace hanging around her neck with the hand she wasn't playing with. It was the necklace Sawyer had given her the day before, and Hazel had made sure to wear it. To prove how much she liked it, which she really did. It was perfect! Not to fancy and not to simple. Just perfect. \"Hazel?\" Sawyer asked suddenly. \"Yes? What is it?\" \"Have you heard anything yet?\" \"From who?\" She looked up at him with curiosity in her eyes. \"College…\" \"Oh… No, not yet.\" Hazel felt a small twinge in her chest when she thought about it, something she hadn't done in weeks. There hadn't really been time for that. But now that she did, she wondered why… \"Why haven't I heard something, Sawyer?\" Hazel felt a tear forming in her eye and realized how worried she actually was. \"I don't know…\" Sawyer answered quietly. Hazel felt how he monitored for her to sit up, which she did. He took both of her hands in his. \"But I'm sure it's nothing. I'm sure you'll get in.\" \"How?\" \"I just do. And besides, would you really want to spend all those years cramped up with me?\" He winked at her. A small smile escaped Hazel's mouth. \"Goof\" she said and nudged him with her shoulder. She leaned him and kissed him on the cheek before hugging him tightly. Sawyer's POV Sawyer released himself a little, only to lean in again and kiss her. It wasn't the sweet kiss they usually shared, it was more fierce, longing. Hazel quickly followed the hint and put one hand around his waist and the other on the nape of his neck, playing with his hair. Sawyer slowly lowered on the ground with him landing on top of her. He started to kiss the side of her chin then along the jaw line. Just when he was about to reach Hazel's neck, her phone ringed. \"Busted…\" Sawyer whispered. \"Do I have to get that?\" Hazel asked, more to herself than Sawyer. \"It might be important.\" Sawyer moved to the side to that Hazel could sit up. Her lips were slightly swollen from the kiss and her eyes were dark. \"Hello? Oh, hi dad. What's up?\" Sawyer had to appreciate the irony. \"What?\" Sawyer immediately noticed the change in tone. She sounded worried. \"Where?\" Sawyer watched her listen for a moment. \"Oh my god, that's right beside us, we'll meet you there!\" She hung up. \"What's going on\" Sawyer worriedly asked as Hazel stood up and started to tug at the blanket to make him stand up too. \"Hazel?\" \"An otter has been washed up ashore. It's pretty bad.\" \"How bad? Where?\" \" Very bad according to the guy who called it in. At the beach beside this one.\" They packed up the belongings and started running. They ran as fast as they could to the next beach and when they got there, it wasn't hard to see where the otter had drifted ashore. Hazel's POV Everyone had gathered in a circle round something Hazel couldn't see because she was too short, but she already know that the poor otter was the thing they were staring at. She could hear people talking to each other. \"Where did it come from?\" a woman asked. \"What should we do about it?\" a man said. \"Does anyone have medical training?\" another man asked. \"But didn't someone call in a team?\" a different woman asked, trying to hold her daughter back. \"Sarah, don't go near it!\" \"Mommy is it dead?\" the little girl asked. Sawyer marched into the crowd with a stern look on his face. \"Excuse us\" he said and started to shuffle the crowd to the sides. \"Coming through, please move, sir please step out of the way.\" Hazel followed the trail he left behind. \"Hey, kids!\" a grumpy looking man shouted to them when they closed in on the otter. \"Don't touch it!\" \"We're with the CMA\" Sawyer said. \"Yeah right! The CMA sends in a pair of teenagers without equipment? I don't think so.\" \"We were already in the area when the beaching was alarmed\" Hazel answered calmly as she bent down to look at the poor thing. \"The rest of the team is on its way.\" \"You two are kids !\" the grumpy man said. \"Actually we are both eighteen, and unlike you we have training. So please sir, back off \" Sawyer said between what sounded like gritted teeth. Hazel didn't look at him, but she could hear from his tone how serious and stern his face was. \"Who called it in?\" \"I did\" a man said, breaking free from the crowd. \"Thank you\" Sawyer said in a gentler tone. \"Good job.\" Hazel examined the wounds. It was miracle that the otter was still alive. The lower half of its body was tangled in some sort of fishing net like wire and a large hook that now had pierced right through the body had before made large deep cut around it as it had tried to free itself. Sawyer had taken off his shirt and Hazel slowly lifted the wounded part so that Sawyer could put his shirt under the otter to prevent even more sand from finding its way into the cuts. The otter was so weak it didn't even try to protect itself from them. \"Sawyer do you have something sharp?\" Hazel asked. \"Only the bottle opener, but I don't think we can cut the wire with it\" Sawyer answered. \"Does anyone have a knife?\" Hazel asked loudly to the crowd. \"I have a knife!\" a woman said, walking towards them with it. \"Thank you.\" Hazel took it from the woman and started to remove the wire but cutting it. In the meantime, Sawyer had taken out some napkins from his bag and gently tried to put pressure on the cuts to stop the bleeding. The otter made a faint sound. \"I know, I know\" Sawyer whispered. \"I'm sorry.\" Suddenly Hazel heard the sound of a large vehicle parking nearby. The crowd scattered to look after what had made the sound, which led to that Hazel could see something else then just scared citizens. She recognized the truck. \"Thank god\" she said. \"Hey! We're down here!\" she added screaming to her dad and the rest of the team. Her dad was the first in the team to make it down to the beach. \"How bad is it?\" he asked before he saw it himself a moment later. \"Oh god.\" He turned around. \"Phoebe! Bring in the stretcher now!\" Hazel could hear phoebe shouting something back, but not what. The next one to arrive was Kat who was holding the camera. Soon enough Phoebe was on scene with the stretcher along with the rest of the team and the started pulling the otter onto the stretcher. \"Nice work, guys\" Hazel's dad said. \"Thanks\" Sawyer said. \"Hazel, tell the operating theater to be on standby so that we can start stitching we wounds right away.\" \"Of course\" Hazel answered and started dialing the number on her phone. Meanwhile the team started carrying the otter back to the truck. When the all stepped in, Hazel made a silent pray that this poor otter wouldn't die. If you liked it, please leave a review!

So far, the only one under 1000 words which usually is my invisible rule, but I like it anyway! Enjoy! Chapter 22 – Treating Sawyer's POV Clay was the first to step out of the van. He ran over to the other side to be ready when they opened the door from inside. Sawyer and Hazel had stepped out of the van too, Hazel took over the camera from Kat who immediately started to help as they rushed into the aquarium and into the nearest operation theatre where the rest of the team was already scrubbed up and ready to start. \"Male otter, he was tangled in a fishing line which we've taken away but we left the hook inside since we didn't have the right equipment in the van\" Clay reported as they entered. Hazel stayed to shoot the process while Sawyer and the other from the van went to clean up. He hurried as much as he could, though he knew that Clay was the only one to go inside again otherwise the operating theatre would be too crowded. But it didn't stop him from being worried and wanting to make sure everything went well. Sawyer watched the operation go on from outside a window between the theatre and the corridor. He altered between pacing around to leaning against the wall tapping his foot on the floor. \"You should try to think about something else while they're working\" a voice beside him said. Sawyer turned his head and saw Phoebe standing there with a compassionate smile on her face. \"You're not even supposed to be here today. It is your day off. Go to the café across the street and take a coffee or something.\" \"I only drink coffee when I'm agitated so I don't think it would help with my case, really…\" Sawyer answered with his gaze focused on the team working on the otter, even though he wanted to look at Phoebe. \"Then drink something else.\" She put a hand on his shoulder which finally got him to tear his eyes from the team. \"Just stop worrying for now.\" \"Okay.\" Sawyer took a deep breath and tried to give Phoebe a smile but failed. Then he walked away and out. XXX Sawyer sat at the café with a raspberry smoothie in his left hand and his phone in his right. The headphones were plugged in. He flipped through his pictures and videos, stopping at one video, he pushed the play button. It showed the waves beneath a boat in motion then the camera's angle shifted and showed Hazel standing on the boat looking out on the horizon. She was turned away from the camera. Sawyer remembered it as the time he and Hazel went out with Reed and his boat boat. \" Hazel\" the Sawyer in the video said. Video-Hazel turned around. At first she smiled at the camera, then something in her face shifted as she realized something. \" Are you filming me?\" she asked. \" Yeah\" Video-Sawyer chuckled. \" Oh my god, turn it off !\" The Hazel in the video buried her face in her hands for a moment then looked up and stuck out her tongue towards the camera. Both Video-Sawyer and Sawyer laughed. But then the video ended and he remembered why he sat in the café in the first place. All the thoughts and worries suddenly came back. Is he okay? Will he make it? How deep was that cut? What if he doesn't make it? I should have done more to help! But I did everything I could! Right? His phone distracted him once again, but only for a second. Hazel called him. \"Hazel?\" Sawyer answered. \" Hi\" Hazel answered, her voice unreadable. \"So how did it go?\" \"Come over and I'll tell you.\" They immediately hung up and Sawyer ran across the street and inside the CMA. Through the crowds of staff working with different animals who turned around after him with puzzled looks on their faces to the hospital department. Hazel stood outside the theatre, her facial expression was also unreadable. \"Well?\" \"Well…\" Hazel took Sawyer's hand in her own which only made him more worried. \"He's stable.\" Sawyer's exhaled deeply, it was like all weight on his chest melted away. \"Thank you\" he whispered to no one in particular. Hazel smiled and pulled him in in a hug. He buried his face in the crook of her neck, feeling her warmth and breathing in her calming scent. \"The drugs are wearing off. Come on, let's be there when they place him with the other otters.\" \"Absolutely! But hold on a moment.\" Hazel had started walking off so Sawyer grabbed her hand and pulled her back, capturing her in a deep kiss. Hazel put her arms around his neck and pulled him towards her. \"Wow\" Hazel whispered as they broke apart. \"What was that for?\" \"Just because… You're such an amazing person.\" Hazel raised her eyebrows but smiled. \"You're not so bad yourself.\" \"Come on let's go.\" They walked hand in hand to the otter pool. Hit the review button? Come on, now? *Puppy dog face* Plizzz! ;) See you soon! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Tidning – Magazine[Chapter 23] Hey you guys! Here is chapter 23 for you! I don't really have much to say today, except for; enjoy! ; ) Chapter 23 – Matty the otter Sawyer's POV Sawyer watched as they lowered the otter into the containment. He could feel Hazel squeezing his hand, he knew she felt the same thing he did. She was worried what would happen when the otter woke up, and so was he. Would the other otters accept him, the two they had had accepted each other so of course there was hope, but also, there was always worries. \"Any second now\" Clay announced. And indeed, a few seconds later, the otter started to move and make small noises. Sawyer turned his head to face Hazel for a moment who watched the event happen with a mixture of feelings on her face, so many that he couldn't separate them all. He watched as the otter slowly raised its head into the air and smelled its new surroundings. It got on its feet and walked over the water. Just then, the two other otters Rose and Brownie showed their heads above the surface. The new otter immediately backed away, with a small squeal coming from its mouth. \"Come on\" Hazel whispered quietly. \"Please…\" Rose and Brownie both climbed out of the water and strolled towards the otter, they sniffed in the air. The new otter took a small step and whiffed them too. Rose and Brownie walked around the otter as if getting a good look at the stranger. Then they started to exchange sounds, all three. \"They're communicating\" Phoebe said. \"Yeah\" Clay answered. \"Hopefully that's a good sign.\" All three of them dived into the water together and started swimming. \"I think it is safe to say they have accepted each other\" Clay said. The others agreed. \"Welcome to the CMA, Matty\" Hazel said. \"Matty?\" Clay asked. Hazel gave him a proud smile. \"I like it\" Sawyer said, releasing her hand to put his arm around her shoulders. \"Alright then, Matty it is\" Clay said. The team greeted Matty welcome. \"Okay… I'll have to finish the paper work, Hazel do you want to help?\" Hazel nodded. \"Good. The rest of you know what to do, but Sawyer, since it is technically yours and Hazel's day off you can do whatever you want.\" \"I think I'm going to stick around, visit Winter and Hope real quick\" Sawyer said. \"Alright, you do that. Hazel, you coming?\" \"Yeah\" Hazel said. She gave Sawyer a quick kiss on the cheek. \"I'll see you later.\" \"See you\" Sawyer said. He stood by, watching Hazel walk away with her dad slightly behind. Clay turned around and saw him standing there staring like a love struck teenage boy, which in fact he was. But the weird thing was, Clay didn't smile like he usually did. He just looked serious, leaving Sawyer wondering if he had done something wrong to him or Hazel but he couldn't recall anything. Hazel's POV \"Sit down, sweetie\" her dad told her as he closed the door. He walked over to his desk and sat down opposite her. \"Hazel…\" \"Yes, dad?\" Hazel answered, feeling confused. Why was he so serious? Everything had worked out fantastic, he should be feeling happy. Or maybe, this wasn't about Matty, but something else. \"What is it?\" Clay took a deep breath, as if it was hard for him to get the words out. \"Is something wrong?\" \"Maybe… I don't know.\" \"Okay. I'm confused.\" \"You and Sawyer seem happy together.\" \"We are. Why?\" She couldn't help but feel suspicious and it was probably pretty obvious since she immediately folded her arms across her chest. \"Very happy?\" \"Yes..?\" \"Okay, well. My question is… Is, uh…\" Her dad rubbed the back of his neck. \"Have you to ever… Well…\" Now Hazel understood what he was trying to get out and it was as embarrassing for her as it was for him. \" God! Dad!\" \"Hazel I don't want to talk about that anymore than you do but we have to.\" Hazel could feel her face going redder by the second. She just wanted to escape and hide in her room under a pillow. \"We haven't! And why do you want to know that?!\" \"Okay that's good… I'm your father and I just wanted to make sure. You're growing up and even though no father wants his little girl to grow up you are, and we have to make sure of a couple of things.\" \"Like what?\" \"I trust you, Hazel, and I trust Sawyer. Which is why I trust that one of you won't try to force the other into something.\" \"Thanks, I think… But we haven't talked about, you know, that , but I guess it'll just happen when it does.\" \"Well, we still have to make sure that when it does happen, I want to feel calm. I want to know that you two are prepared so to speak…\" \"Okay, if you're talking about protection and stuff, don't worry! Okay? We can handle it!\" \"I want to and do believe you, you're both smart. But you know it's a dad's job to worry about their daughters.\" \"You can take a day off then, because when it's does happen, we will have it under control. I'm not planning on getting pregnant at age eighteen.\" Her dad chuckled. \"That's good. It's a bit early for me to become a grandfather, don't you think?\" \"It is. Now…\" Hazel desperately wanted to change the subject. \"Can we get started on the paperwork?\" \"Absolutely.\" XXX Hazel didn't find Sawyer by Winter and Hope's pool after she finished the paperwork with her dad. Phoebe said he left a while ago and didn't know where he went. If he went home or to another department. Hey! Where are you? Want to meet up? She texted to him. A minute later he responded. Hi, Haze! At the otter pool, you coming over or should we meet somewhere else? The otter pool's fine. Be right there! XO He sat by himself, watching the three otter interacting. \"Hi!\" Hazel said before she sat down. She put her hand on the nape of his neck and kissed him fiercely. Her other hand travelled to his leg as he kissed her back, though he broke the kiss a lot sooner than she would have hoped. \"What are you doing?\" he asked. Hazel shrugged. \"Look, I'm not complaining, but maybe here's not the place make out?\" \"Yeah… No, you're right.\" Hazel felt the color rise in her cheeks again. \"I'm sorry.\" \"Don't be! I'm just saying that maybe we should wait with that until we are somewhere where staff isn't gonna come walking down the hall at any minute.\" \"True.\" \"Listen, Hazel, I have a question.\" \"Shoot!\" \"Your dad looked at me weird before. Do you know why?\" Hazel felt herself blush for the third time today. \"Yeah… I think I do. He wasn't mad at you if that's what you thought!\" \"The thought did cross my mind.\" \"No, that was not it. He was just dad being dad. He just wanted to talk to me about something…\" Hazel pulled her hand through her hair. \"What?\" \"Oh, nothing special!\" That was a lie. The talk was about something very special, but she felt embarrassed at the thought of sharing the fact that her dad had just tried to warn her about the danger of unprotected sex with Sawyer. She didn't know whether it was right or wrong to withhold the information, but she did. \"They look content\" Sawyer suddenly said, changing the subject much to Hazel's relief. \"The otters I mean.\" \"They do.\" \"And so are we, right?\" Hazel looked at him, she had been looking at the otters until now. Her pupils were round, but she smiled. \"Yes, we are.\" Sawyer leaned in and kissed her, when he broke the kiss she leaned her head on his shoulder and just relaxed. Awww! How sweet! Almost a proclamation of love. Almost! I really enjoyed writing the talk! Hope you were satisfied with it! I'm thinking about writing a Game of Thrones Gendrya one-shot! I ship them sooo hard!

Sounds really disgusting, I know. But it is so good! It's this pretty plat chocolate tasting cake, like an inch thick. It's crunchy on the outside and really soft and creamy on the inside. You eat it with vanilla ice cream or cream! Yummy![Chapter 24] Hi lovelys! I know I said in my last author's note that this chapter would be called \"Playing with Winter and Hope\". But it didn't turn out to be what I thought it would be, so this is what it will be like instead. Hope you're all okay with that! Enjoy! Chapter 24 – Worries and solutions Sawyer's POV \"Welcome to the Clearwater marine aquarium everybody! Are you having a good day?\" Hazel asked the audience. They all cheered in response. It was Winter's third and last session for the day. Everything went just according to plan. Every member of the staff worked in front of the audience with a smile on their faces. Though Sawyer felt like his smile was plastic, like it wasn't real. It had nothing to do with Winter or the people watching the session, but a feeling of dread had overcome him when he woke up this morning. At first he had dismissed it as being the aftermath of a dream he no longer remembered, but when he reached the CMA it hadn't gone away like he hoped it would. Instead it had only intensified. And Sawyer was yet to understand why. \"No if you look in the pool on the left\" Hazel told the audience and pointed. \"That is Hope. She is Winter's life companion and we like to call her Winter's little sister. Hope was rescued three years ago when she was just a little baby, abandoned by her mother. We feared she would not make it but she did, hence the name. Winter herself wasn't doing well at that point, having just lost her surrogate mother Panama. After failed attempts to pair them we finally did it, and now both are happy and safe living a good long life. So let's say goodbye to Winter for now as she reunite with her family. Goodbye, Winter!\" The audience cheered and waved to Winter as Kat opened the gate so that Winter could swim over to Hope. \"Thank you all for attending this session. Now this was the last one for today but tomorrow you can come back and watch Winter swim her prosthetic. Bye, bye!\" After everyone had walked out of the pool area Sawyer watched Hazel take off her headset and talk to Phoebe. He still sat in the pool with Winter swimming around with Hope, he tried to decide if the reason he felt dread had something to do with Hazel. But as soon the thought struck him he immediately dismissed it with guilt pounding in his heart. Nothing Hazel could ever do would ever make him feel this way, so had he even thought about it? \"I think that went well\" Hazel suddenly said. He hadn't realized that he was walking straight towards him. \"It did…\" Sawyer did, trying hard to sound casual. \"Are you okay? You sound weird.\" \"I'm fine\" Sawyer lied. \"Just a little tired…\" \"Well soon you can go home and get some rest.\" Sawyer nodded and stood up, he climbed the ladder out of the pool. \"I'm gonna go and change.\" Hazel nodded and he walked away. Hazel stood there waiting for him when he got back. She had a big smile on her face, but for maybe the first time since they met, her smile didn't rub off on him. \"Hi!\" she greeted him. \"I was wondering if maybe you wanted to a café or something?\" \"No\" Sawyer answered before he could even think. \"What?\" \"I- I'm sorry! I mean, I can't. I have to get home early and help my mom with some stuff.\" That was a lie. \"So, I won't see you more today?\" \"Probably not.\" \"Okay… Good bye kiss?\" Sawyer realized that he had intended to just walk away without a proper good bye to his girlfriend and felt guilty. He therefore nodded and leaned in to kiss her, though it was a simple one that was over in about a second. \"Bye.\" Sawyer walked away, leaving a stunned Hazel behind. XXX \"Hi, mom\" Sawyer greeted shortly as he walked inside the door to his house. \"Hi, Sawyer!\" His mom greeted happily. If Sawyer just could have made it to his bedroom without uttering another word, that would be great. But fate didn't often play his game. When he was about to cross the kitchen, he noticed that a man he did not know sat with his mom in the kitchen. \"Who are you?\" Sawyer asked, again before thinking. \"Sawyer!\" his mom scolded. \"Oh no, Lorraine. It's alright\" The Man said and put his hand on Lorraine's shoulder, which Sawyer didn't like. \"I'm John.\" He held his hand out towards Sawyer who shook it most reluctantly. \"Sawyer.\" \"Well, nice to meet you young man\" John said and went to sit down again. Sawyer looked from John, to his mom, and then back to John. Firstly, Sawyer in no mood to be polite. Second, he didn't think it was nice to meet this John. So instead of saying anything, he just crossed the kitchen as if nothing had happened and walked inside his own room. Before he closed the door, he could hear his mom apologizing on his behalf. When he closed the door he immediately flopped down on his bed. Sawyer didn't have enough strength to worry about this new guy, John. Not yet, anyway. He tried to focus and solve a bigger problem, this weird feeling of his. Not only did it affect him, but now he was being rude to other people, including Hazel. His eyes travelled around the room, looking for clues. His eyes stopped when they reached a photo on his bedside table. Sawyer could feel them widen, he understood. He finally understood. Now he knew what was wrong with him. The feeling engulfed him, and he had to work hard to not let the tears that formed in his eyes from falling. Sawyer took long deep breaths. Sawyer turned on his side. It will be okay, they will be okay! Nothing bad will happen! It's not like I'll be gone forever! The thoughts were realistic, but did not calm him. They were all true. When he left, he wouldn't be gone forever, but what would Winter think? Would she think he left her forever when he couldn't come and visit her every day? Three years ago he went away for three months, and felt guilty about it every single day. Now he was going away for five years . Not months, years . He knew he had to, but it didn't make it more bearable. He turned again and tried to just forget about it for a few hours. XXX The next day his mom had tried to talk to him about John, but Sawyer wouldn't listen. He did not want to hear, and he did not care. The last of his worries right now was his mom meeting someone. Sawyer barely ate anything for breakfast and just took his bike and rode off. His mind was going in circles during the whole bike ride and almost missed a red light. He got a few shouts and curse words in response but didn't care about that either. He knew anger was the wrong feeling to have in his situation, yet at the same time, he couldn't control what he felt. \"Hi, Sawyer!\" Hazel said happily when he arrived. It seemed she was over the fact that he snapped at her the day before. \"Hi\" Sawyer answered. He tried to look happy, he really did, but he couldn't. \"Hi\" Hazel said again, thoughtfully. \"Is there anything you want to talk about? We could go inside for a few minutes, or something.\" She had a calculating look on her face. \"No!\" Sawyer spat. \"I'm fine!\" Hazel's face changed from calculating and confused to angry and upset. \"Okay, Sawyer, now we really need to talk! What is the problem here? Have I offended you in some way?\" \"No!\" \"Then why don't you just tell me what's wrong instead of turning all of your thoughts into anger and taking all that anger out on me!\" Sawyer who had turned around and started to walk away stopped in his tracks. He closed his eyes, letting the guilt wash over him once again. \"I'm sorry…\" Sawyer whispered. \"You should be\" Hazel whispered back, her voice barely audible. \"Now would you please just tell me what's wrong? I can't help you if you don't.\" \"Not out here.\" \"Alright. Come in for a few minutes.\" She took his hand and led him inside the houseboat. When inside Hazel monitored for him to sit down and he did. Neither of them said anything at first. Sawyer watched Hazel take out two glasses from one of the cupboards and then filling them with coke. She placed one glass in front of him and then sat down next to him with the other glass in her hand. \"Talk to me\" she said, her eyes digging into his. \"I can't leave her again. Not like that\" Sawyer said, his voice weak. \"You can't leave who?\" \"Winter. I can't leave her again like this.\" A look of understanding crossed Hazel's face. \"You're talking about college, aren't you?\" Sawyer nodded. \"Sawyer.\" Hazel grabbed his hand. \"It's not like you are going to be gone forever. And you can come back and visit every weekend, and every break.\" \"Hazel, I can't afford to come back every weekend. Going on a train every Friday and Sunday is not exactly going to be cheap. Three years ago I left her for three months. Now I'm leaving for five years!\" \"We'll work it out! Everything is going to be fine!\" \"How do you know?\" Hazel stood up and drew him into a tight hug. Sawyer rested his arms around her waist and his head on her stomach. Her warm body pressed against him calmed him as he breathed in her gentle scent. \"I just do\" Hazel whispered. \"I have faith.\" Sawyer's eyes were closed, but he could feel Hazel tilting his head up. His eyes shot open. She ran her thumb under his eye lightly, catching the one tear that had managed to fall. Sawyer cupped her head with his hand and drew her down for a kiss. \"Here's what we do; after today, after Winter's sessions we go down to her and Hope's pool and just enjoy the time with them. Swimming and playing, making some good memories for you and her. She knows you'll never leave her, this is just making sure she remembers.\" \"That's a really good idea, Hazel. You're the best.\" Hazel smiled at him, he could see her remember the first time he told her that. \"Come on. Let's go.\" \"Let's go.\" Well? What did you think? Keep those reviews coming! They help so much, especially if you give me some criticism! To be continued in \"Those three words\"! (Hint, hint!) Simple Swedish of the chapter: Jordbävning – Earthquake (random, right? I'm watching San Andreas while watching this so it was the first thing that came to mind… ;) )[Chapter 25] Hiya, my lovelys! Kind of short chapter, but I don't want it any other way. To me it's long enough to get the message! Enjoy! Chapter 25 – Those three words Hazel's POV \"Hazel, sweetheart\" Her dad whispered, trying to wake her up. \"Wake up!\" \"No\" Hazel groaned. \"Leave me alone!\" She turned her back towards her dad and pulled the quilt over her head. \"Trust me, sweetheart, you want to see this.\" Hazel pulled the quilt back enough to reveal her eyes and saw that her dad held an envelope in his hands. \"What's that?\" \"See for yourself.\" Hazel took the envelope from her dad and looked at it. At first it just looked like your normal letter, but then Hazel noticed a sigil in the top left corner. She nearly lost her breath as she understood where it came from. \"Dad it's-\" Hazel started, but she couldn't finish the sentence. \"From college\" her dad finished for her. \"Open it!\" \"I can't. What if it's bad?\" \"Sweetheart, open it. You'll never know if you don't. You have to open it.\" Hazel slowly ripped the envelope open with shaky fingers. She paused for a moment just to take a breath and gather her courage. What was the worst that could happen? That she didn't get in. But she had to, there wasn't really any other alternative. Hazel took out the paper and read it. She didn't know how to express her feelings. Everything in her mind went crazy. And at the same time her mind was blank. \"What does it say?\" her dad asked carefully. \" Dear miss Haskett \" Hazel recited. \" Congratulations, you have successfully earned a place among our school.\" Her dad's face cracked open in a big smile. \"Hazel!\" He said loudly. \"Congratulations! That's amazing! You did it! Why aren't you happy? Are you not happy?\" \"Just give me a few seconds to process this…\" Hazel stepped out of bed, pacing back and forth around her dad who looked at her with a half worried, half excited expression on his face. It was like he couldn't decide if he should be worried about her for joyful. \"I uh… I, I got in…\" Her dad grabbed her hand. \"Hazel. Look at me.\" Hazel turned her blank face towards him. \"You did it. It's alright now. You got in.\" Hazel nodded and feelings finally started to show. A smile bigger than her father's broke out on her face, tears filled her eyes and she did nothing to stop them. She had never been so overwhelmed in her life. Hazel threw herself in her father's open arms and sobbed loudly. Laughter was mixed with her tears when she realized which doors this opened up for her. She would go to college with Sawyer, the same school not a different one like she first thought, like she had dreamed of for months. \"Call Sawyer now, Hazel!\" her dad said. \"He needs to know!\" \"You're right!\" Her father walked out to give her some privacy as she quickly dialed Sawyer's phone number. \" Hello?\" A groggy Sawyer answered. \" Hazel?\" \"Oh, I'm sorry, did I wake you?\" \" Yeah, but don't worry about it. What's up?\" \"How soon can you get here?\" \" Why? Is something wrong?\" \"No! The opposite, actually! I have news!\" \" Okay, give me half an hour to change and eat breakfast.\" \"No, let's go out for breakfast instead. We have something to celebrate!\" \" What have I missed?\" \"I'll tell you soon. Ihop?\" \" Perfect. In thirty minutes?\" \"Alright I'll see you! Bye!\" \" Bye, Haze!\" XXX Sawyer's POV Hazel was already standing outside Ihop when he got there, in one of her favorite purple and pink tops and white shorts. She was literally jumping up and down with excitement. Her eyes were enough to tell him that she was bursting with news that almost made her happier than she had ever been before. She happily pulled him down for a kiss before he could even say 'hi'. When they released each other they just stood there for a moment with their arms around one another. Sawyer stared into her beautiful brown eyes that sparkled with joy. He could count every freckle on her cheeks. She traced her knuckles over his cheek. \"Tell me\" Sawyer whispered. \"What's going on?\" \"Come on\" Hazel answered. \"Let's sit down for a minute and I'll tell you.\" He followed her with his hand in hers to the nearest bench. She opened her mouth to speak but for the first second, all she could do was smile. \"I got in\" she finally managed to get out. Sawyer's mouth flew open, and then Hazel's smile rubbed off. \"Oh my god! Hazel!\" Sawyer pulled her in for a tight hug. \"That's so great!\" \"It's amazing ! Now I can go with you to college! Sawyer, I've been hoping for this for months, and it happened!\" \"I know!\" She kissed him again. \"Let's eat that celebration breakfast!\" Sawyer watched Hazel as she ate the pancakes she ordered. Love. There was no other way to describe what he felt for her. It was scary, yet a feeling he never wanted to lose. He loved her. He'd always known deep inside, but now it came bubbling to the surface. And he wanted to tell her. He had the perfect opportunity too. Hazel was so happy, it seemed like the perfect time to let her know how he felt. \"Hazel?\" \"Yeah?\" she answered. \"I…\" \"What?\" \"I… I'm really happy for you.\" Hazel smiled. \"I'm happy for us .\" \"Me too.\" He mentally hit himself. Why couldn't he say it? It shouldn't be this hard to express his feelings! He knew what he felt was right! So why couldn't he just say it?! XXX They lay cuddling in Sawyer's bed. Lorraine was on a meeting, so they were alone for a couple of hours. A rare occurrence. It didn't happen often since they were always at the CMA and both he and Hazel wanted to be close to Winter, Hope and the other animals just in case anything happened. Sawyer pressed his lips to the top of Hazel's head. They had a movie on, but Sawyer didn't pay much attention to it, and he had a feeling Hazel didn't either. His mind was somewhere else. He was thinking about his feelings again. He had to tell her. And again, he wanted to. \"I have to tell you something\" Sawyer said. Hazel turned slightly and leaned her chin on his chest. \"What?\" she asked. She took his hand and playfully entwined their fingers. \"I love you\" he blurted out. Something flashed across Hazel's face. She bent her head down, nuzzling his shirt for a moment. Then she sat up, Sawyer did too. She slowly cupped his face and leaned in, but not all the way. \"I love you too\" she whispered. Sawyer closed the small distance between them and kissed her tenderly. His arms came around her, one on her back and the other pulling his fingers through her hair. Hazel broke the kiss first and let their foreheads touch. Sawyer enjoyed the feeling of having her close. He loved Hazel. He loved her. Fluffity fluff! Liked it? Let me know, please!

Simple Swedish of the chapter: Kärlek - Love[Chapter 26] Alright, my lovelys! Here is chapter 26 to go! Only six to go after this one, man time flies by fast! Fair warning, this is more on an adult chapter, but since this story is T-rated I couldn't go into full detail, and I've tried to replace some words that might have been a little too dirty, with milder words. Enjoy! Chapter 26 – A night alone Sawyer's POV \"Mom, I'm home\" Sawyer called as he entered the door with the groceries his mom asked him to buy on his way back from the CMA. \"Good! Come here, I have some news\" his mom answered. Sawyer wandered into the kitchen where his mom was sitting at the table, looking through some papers. \"What's that?\" Sawyer asked as he put down the bags on the counter. He tried to take a sneak peak at the papers but couldn't make out what it said on them. \"It's the planning for a conference I have to go to this weekend.\" \" This weekend?\" \"Yes.\" \"But it's Thursday today?\" \"It is, I only found out today. But it's in Miami, which means I'll have to stay there over the weekend. I'll go early tomorrow and come back Saturday evening. Will you be okay those two days?\" \"Of course, but you have never been away for more than twelve hours before. Why now?\" \"Well, firstly you're eighteen now. And also, I find that you are now old enough to be on your own that long.\" \"Alright.\" Sawyer couldn't help a smile from curling the corners of his mouth. Though his mother's face became stern and she narrowed her eyes at him. \"One promise though, no parties!\" The smile from Sawyer's face disappeared, only to be replaced with raised eyebrows. \"A party? Why would I have a party, mom? I don't have enough friends.\" His voice was sincere and that seemed to calm her. \"Good.\" XXX \"Hi, Haze!\" Sawyer said after Hazel picked up her phone. The first thing he had done the day after his mom's announcement had been to call her. \" Hi, handsome. What's up?\" she responded, Sawyer could clearly hear the smile on her face on the other line. \"Just one thing, uh, what are you doing? You busy?\" \" I'm having lunch with Julia.\" \"Oh, okay. I won't disturb you then. Just one question, mom is out of town today, she coming back tomorrow. So I was wondering if maybe you would like to have a sleepover at my place?\" \" Like alone? Just you and me?\" Sawyer suddenly felt a bit nervous. He knew what was on his mind, and he had a feeling that Hazel thought about the same thing, but he didn't dare ask her when she wasn't alone. Also, it felt quite awkward scheduling that kind of thing. Although Sawyer was most definitely open to the opportunity if it came. \"Well, yes…\" \" Sure, yeah, absolutely.\" Sawyer felt a slight jolt going through him. \"Okay, good! I will see you later tonight then?\" \" Sounds great! Love you.\" \"Love you too.\" Hazel's POV Hazel couldn't stop the expression from penetrating her face. A strong mixture between excitement and feeling nervous. \"What did he want?\" Julia asked with a sly expression. \"He asked me if I wanted to stay at his place tonight\" Hazel answered as casually as she could. \"He's mom is out of town.\" She took a bite of her spaghetti. Julia eyed her while collecting rice on her fork. Hazel could almost see the cogwheels in her brain spin, she tried to not focus on that piercing look of hers. \"And you two have never been alone for the night?\" \"Not completely by ourselves, no…\" Hazel felt the color in her cheeks rising. Julia chuckled. \"Then you must understand his point of view?\" Julia didn't wait for an answer. \"If you two are alone, no one will bother you, his mom isn't due until tomorrow and you have been dating for what?, almost two months?\" \"Almost, yes.\" Hazel didn't answer the rest of her speech on purpose. \"I know what he's thinking, do you?\" \"I think I do…\" Hazel seriously wished she could pour her glass of water over her head to try and ease the blush on her cheeks. \"Well then, do you have some rubber?\" \"Rubber?\" \"Yes, rubber. You know, condoms ?\" \"Julia?!\" \"Yes..?\" Julia gave every spelling a higher pitch, as if she was trying real hard not to squeal or laugh. \"Could you please not talk about this so loudly? What if someone hears?\" \"So what? Nobody will care. Do you have some condoms? I can get them for you otherwise, if you don't want to buy them yourself.\" \" No , Julia, I don't need you to buy me condoms!\" Hazel remembered the time her dad took her to the youth clinic for sex-ed since he was too embarrassed to do it on his own. The doctor there gave her some, but she would never tell anyone that she actually kept them. \"I have some.\" \"Good. Just be sure to check the expiration date. You wouldn't want them to break in the middle of the act. I don't think either of you wants a baby yet.\" Julia smiled casually as if she had no trouble at all talking about sex at a restaurant. When Hazel saw that, she couldn't help but feel calmer too. \"I will.\" XXX Hazel stood in front of her mirror in only panties and a bra with almost all of her clothes displayed on her bed. A spark inside her had lit. A spark that she hadn't felt before, at least not this strong. She had always been attracted to Sawyer, she found him sexy, no doubt about that, also no doubt about the fact that she had checked him out many times before. But this was different. She had never before had the urge to dress sexy, but now she had. She wanted Sawyer eyes on her body as she entered his house, she wanted him to be attracted when he saw her. On purpose, she had chosen matching black underwear, just in case. Even though, nothing might happen, she wanted to be prepared. Hazel was pretty set on a black skirt she had bought many months ago, but never used. It was quite short, which is why she had never had the guts to. But her real problem was the top, which one she should choose. Hazel wanted something that would catch Sawyer's attention, but at the same time look natural as she did not want it to seem like she was trying too hard to look sexy. Top after top, color after color, cut after cut. Nothing seemed perfect. She tried on a black tight tank top with a low cut, but almost immediately decided that it was way too sexy and too much black. Then she tried floral blouse in almost every color you could think of, but it didn't really match the skirt. After what felt like forever, she did find something. It was a tank top. It was in a lavender purple color with midnight blue gems along the neckline. The cut was lower than the tops she usually wore, but it suited her fine, this time. She paired the top and skirt with her favorite black shoes. Her hair was slightly curled and hung loosely around her shoulders. Hazel wore makeup, some eyeliner to define her eyes and lip gloss. As she crossed the CMA to tell her father her goodbyes, Hazel made sure to wear a coat. Even though she wasn't dressed as a harlot, she was sure that her father would make her change. With the condoms securely hidden in her handbag, Hazel made her way to Sawyer's house. She knocked on the door when reaching it. Sawyer opened. He wore black trousers and a blue shirt which wasn't tucked in, had the two first buttons undone and his sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. Hazel couldn't express enough how much she loved that look on him. \"Wow\" they both said at the same time. Then both of them blushed. \"Come on in\" Sawyer said. Hazel sat down both her bigger bag and hand bag on the floor to hang her coat that she had had across her arm. \"You look nice\" she said. \"Uh… So do you, really nice.\" Hazel smiled at him and drew him in for a long kiss. \"I hope you don't mind that I ordered pizza, as you know, my cooking sucks\" Sawyer said after they broke apart. Hazel laughed and kissed him again They sat down, flipping through channels on TV while waiting for their pizza to arrive. Hazel couldn't help but notice the way Sawyer's fingers were playing slightly with the strap of her tank top when he had his arm around her. She felt excitement build inside her. Hazel cupped his face with one hand and made him turn his face towards her. She leaned in and kissed him. They had shared heated kisses before, yet this was different. Their lips crashing against each other, their tongues battling were like fire. Her hands found their way to the bottom of his shirt and she started playing with it, while Sawyer's hands were on her hips, holding her in place as she was straddling him. Sawyer's mouth left hers and Hazel let out a small sound of disappointment, that was replaced by a hiss of pleasure when he started trailing kisses along her jaw and down on her neck, stopping to nibble slightly at her pulse point. Hazel couldn't stop the moaning sigh from ripping through her throat. When he reached her collarbone she felt a jolt of electricity run through her down below. She was sure she was about to go crazy when someone broke her out of her bliss by knocking at the door. \"That would be the pizza\" Sawyer whispered in a husky voice. His eyes were dark with want and Hazel wanted nothing but to kiss those swollen lips again. They sat down to eat the pizza, Hazel did so a little reluctantly. She had nothing against the pizza, she just wanted back to the feeling of straddling Sawyer's lap and having his lips kiss her neck. And she knew he wanted it too, she didn't say anything about it to him, afraid to embarrass him, but the evidence was clear to see. Soon enough the pizza was finished, the dishes were put away and their hands were free of grease, and it didn't take long before they were settled in the same position as before, only this time on Sawyer's bed. Hazel tugged at the ends of Sawyer's shirt and he helped her remove it with a smirk on his face. Slowly, she felt a little self-conscious, but at the same time, excited, Hazel removed her own top, slowly pulling it over her head. He had seen her in a bikini top, but this was different, it felt like she was exposing herself in front of him for the first time. Sawyer looked into her eyes, asking for permission. When she nodded slowly he let his hand run up from her hip along her waist him placing them on her chest. \"Are you sure?\" he whispered. Hazel nodded and kissed him lightly on his lips. She was ready. XXX Dread. That was all she felt. Dread. It wasn't her fault, and it wasn't Sawyer's either. She didn't blame him, how could she? No, she didn't blame anyone. But that wasn't how it was supposed to go, at least in her mind. She turned her head, Sawyer was laying beside her in his bed. They told themselves to just get some sleep and work it out the next day. His face was peaceful, as always when he slept, but Hazel had a feeling, deep inside he was just as distraught at how bad things had gone too. Hazel needed time. She made up her mind. Hazel got out bed and put her skirt back on. She already wore a loose t-shirt to sleep in. After that she wrote a note to Sawyer and put it on his bedside table. A part of her wanted to place a feather like kiss on his temple, but she resisted it. Hazel took her bag and snuck out of Sawyer's house, trying to leave the night behind as she snuck back home. Well, there you have it. Leave a review, let me know something! Tell me your thoughts, guys! Give me something to work with! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Ensam - Alone[Chapter 27] Hi my lovelys! I'm finally back with a new chapter, 27 out of 32. Not much left now! We're getting closer and closer to the ending. Kind of sad, but at the same time it feels good. I've worked on this for so long, it feels good to have made it to the end. ArabellaRoseD: Your idea is really good, and something that deserves being continued. Sadly though, I already have this story mapped out and we only have five chapters to go after this. But maybe this can be a spin off in the future? :-) Enjoy! Chapter 27 – Avoiding Sawyer's POV Sawyer knew she was gone before he even opened his eyes. He could feel the cold emptiness in his bed, and he understood that if she had been there, he would have felt all warm and fuzzy. Now he only felt like the worst human being on the planet. He didn't want to open his eyes. Because doing so would only confirm what had happened. As long as he kept them close, Sawyer could pretend that it was all just a bad dream. When he opened his eyes, this had never happened. But the world didn't work that way. Sawyer turned over, lying flat on his stomach and burying his face in his pillow. He groaned, frustrated. Everything had been so perfect until that night! He didn't know what to do now. Should he call her? Or just leave her alone? Were they even together anymore? They had to be though, right? They hadn't fought. The opposite, actually. He and Hazel had just decided to go to sleep and deal with it tomorrow. Which meant dealing with it today. After a while he couldn't breathe with his face in pillow anymore and was forced to raise his head. It was then he noticed the note on his bedside table. Hazel handwriting. He knew instantly. Hi. I'm so sorry about last night. I hope you don't blame me. I don't blame you. But I need some time. Sorry. Hazel Sawyer cried out, a mixture of feelings escaping. Everything from anger to fear. 'I need some time'? Was that code for 'I want to take a break'? The thought of ending their relationship made his stomach churn. He loved Hazel! He knew it, she knew it, but he didn't know how they would get past this. It hadn't exactly been the best experience for either of them. Sawyer guessed that only good thing that came out of it was that the condom didn't break. That would have been the last straw. So thank God it didn't. He knew that it hadn't been good for Hazel, which made it impossible for him to enjoy it since she clearly wasn't. Yet she had told him to continue. Why, he did not know. She didn't tell him. Sawyer dreaded the moment he had to get out of bed, because no matter what had been going on between him and Hazel, he couldn't ditch the CMA. It was practically his job, and he couldn't play hooky just because things weren't going well with his girlfriend at the moment. \"Why?\" he mumbled into thin air. But of course nobody answered. He barely saw Hazel at the CMA. It seemed as if she made it her mission to avoid him, which he didn't take as the best sign. She didn't even say hello to him when he entered. Anywhere he went, either she wasn't there or she walked out the second she realized he had entered the room. The only time they were forced to interact was at Winter's three sessions. You had to admire her poker face, Hazel kept her charming smile throughout, but as soon as it was over she walked out. Hazel's POV \"What happened with you and Sawyer last night?\" Hazel didn't answer her dad's question. She didn't want to. She didn't want to answer anything, or talk to anybody about that night. All Hazel wanted was to forget it. But to forget it without talking about it meant forgetting her relationship with Sawyer as well. And she definitely didn't want that. \"Hazel!\" \"Nothing happened\" Hazel said shortly. \"Then why did you come home in the middle of the night in tears and refused to talk to me? Did you have a fight?\" \"No.\" \"I don't believe you.\" \"Then don't.\" She got up from where she had been sitting and walked out the door. \"Where are you going, honey?\" \"For a run.\" \"For a run? Again? I know you, Hazel. Going for a run is your way of running from your problems and you know you can't do that.\" \"I'm going anyway.\" \"But I have made lunch. Don't you want to eat something?\" \"I'm not hungry.\" Sawyer's POV After sitting on a bench, biting his nails for the last fifteen minutes his nails were chipped and his mouth dry. They had been at this all day. Not talking, just avoiding and he was growing seriously sick of it. And it wasn't like they could avoid the problem forever. In a few weeks they were set to be one the same flight to college. Sawyer leaned his head on the bench. He remembered that bracelet he'd given Hazel for her eighteenth birthday. It had said the cliché words 'seize the day'. He wondered if the irony could get any bigger. They hadn't exactly seized the day, had they? Or maybe they had. A lot of things had happened since then, good and bad. Maybe it was just his grumpy mind telling him otherwise. \"Sawyer?\" He raised his head and saw the person speaking his name. Sawyer had hoped it was Hazel. So he was a little disappointed to see Emma walking towards him in the park with a pug by her side. \"Can I sit?\" Sawyer nodded. \"I didn't know you had a dog\" he said, mostly just to say something. \"Yeah. His name is Cookie.\" Sawyer looked at the little cream colored thing, its big brown eyes staring up at him from a wrinkly face. He couldn't help but smile a little. \"Cookie, huh?\" \"Don't judge!\" Emma chuckled. \"I was thirteen when I got him.\" She studied him for a moment. \"Something's bothering you, I can see it. Do you want to talk?\" Sawyer sighed, realizing he might as well. \"I've really messed up.\" \"With Hazel.\" Emma nodded slowly. \"How did you know that?\" Emma shrugged. \"Intuition. Go on.\" \"Uh, yeah. Um, well… We were alone last night and we…\" \" Did it \" Emma filled in for him with a small encouraging smile on her face. \"We did it\" Sawyer repeated. \"And it wasn't really that awesome. It was quite bad to be honest. Now things are totally awkward and we're just avoiding each other.\" Emma laughed to his surprise. \"It doesn't help that you're laughing at me, Emma! I'm already feeling small as it is!\" \"I'm not laughing at you . I'm laughing at the situation. It's just too typical! But you're right. I'm sorry. The thing is, Connor and I went through the same thing. Let me just tell you, that when we, you know, did it for the first time, it was not great. He was bad, I was bad, we were bad. But you know we got through it, and now things are great. I love him. Do you love Hazel?\" \"With all my heart.\" \"And she knows that?\" \"I've told her.\" \"Good. But right now, she needs to hear it again. Right now she's afraid that you hate her because neither of you were the sex god you both hoped for and she-\" \"But I don't! How could I?\" \"I know that you don't. Please don't interrupt me, Sawyer, I'm trying to explain to your boyish mind what's going on her girly one.\" \"Sorry…\" \"As I was saying, she is also afraid that you now want to break up.\" \"But she left me this note saying, and I quote, 'I need some time'.\" \"And that was her way of running from the problem because she wasn't ready to face it. Now you have given her a day to prepare, so you need to take care of it. You don't want to break up, you love her, she knows that you love her, she loves you. So make it right.\" \"How?\" \"You still don't get it? God, you're such a boy! Remind her that nothing has changed. Tell her that you don't care what happened in bed! Show her that you refuse to let this bump on the road stop you from driving. It was one bump, Sawyer. The car doesn't break from that.\" \"Are you comparing my love life to a car?\" Sawyer scoffed. \"You're a guy, so I thought that using terms that boys understand would help.\" Sawyer laughed shortly. He didn't know why he spilled his beans like that. There was just something about Emma that made you do just that. \"You know something, Emma? You're gonna make a great psychologist one day.\" Emma blushed and smiled. \"I try.\" \"I'm really going to miss you and Connor, and Luke.\" Emma smiled again and hugged him. \"We will miss you too. But when we will come home and visit each other, right?\" \"Totally!\" \"So this 'session' helped then?\" Emma asked coyly as they released each other. \"It did…\" \"So you will stop avoiding and make things right?\" \"I will.\" Well, you guys, that was it. I really love writing the character Emma, so I had to include her one last time before we depart this story, just to finish off with her, Connor and Luke. Because sadly, we won't see them again. Tell me your thoughts in the reviews, give me something to work with! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Undvika – Avoid[Chapter 28] Oh my god! Hi my lovely bumblebees! I'm so very sorry for the long delay. I hope I still have some readers left. This story is closing in on the ending, which makes it very hard to write. I have some things to say before I let you read this! I want to thank each and everyone who has been stuck with me through this story! Everyone who came when it started and everyone who came along for the ride! I love you all! Stay with me for the last four chapters after this one would you? Thanks! Enjoy! Chapter 28 – The talk Sawyer's POV \"I will.\" \"Good\" Emma answered. \"But you know, I have to go now.\" \"Alright. Take care.\" \"And you too.\" They hugged shortly before Emma walked away with her dog Cookie. Sawyer sat on the bench a while longer. This shouldn't be so hard. Come to think of it they had been through worse, like the reason they were in this mess in the first place. Eventually, though, he got up too and started to make his way back to his house. When he checked the time he realized that his mom should be back by now. Sawyer sighed. Not that he wasn't happy that she was back, because he was. But she would immediately know something was off, and Sawyer wasn't ready to talk about sex complications with his mother, not yet at least. And to his dismay, he heard the sound of his mother walking around in the kitchen. \"Hi, honey\" she said when he closed the door. Sawyer tried to glue a smile on his face but it felt stiff and fake. \"Hi!\" \"I was too tired to cook, so I brought home Chinese. Do you want to have Hazel over? There is enough for three.\" \"Uh… No.\" He regretted the truth as soon as he said it. His mom looked at him with a puzzled expression as she put two plates on the plates along with glasses. \"No? Why? You have never declined that offer before. Is something wrong?\" \"No!\" He knew he snapped at her, but he couldn't care less at the moment. \"Sawyer! Don't use that tone with me! Especially when you have no reason!\" Sawyer, who had turned around, turned back and faced her with a look that was much harder than he intended. Lorraine was both hurt and confused, you could see it in her eyes. Sawyer closed his eyes for a second to calm down. \"I'm sorry, mom…\" he then whispered. \"It's alright. Just tell me one thing.\" She stepped closer and eyed him in that almost creepy way that only a mother knew how to do. \"Why do you not want Hazel to come over?\" Sawyer exhaled. He couldn't tell her what had happened but he couldn't lie either. \"I don't think she would say 'yes'.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I just do.\" \"Why is it so hard to tell me the truth? Do you think I'll be mad at you? Look, if you two had a fight, it's okay. Everyone fights once in a while. Is that it?\" \"Not really. Though I suppose it's the best way to describe it.\" \"About what?\" \"I don't want to talk about it.\" And they didn't. Eventually Lorraine understood that Sawyer had no intention of telling her what his and Hazel's 'fight' had been about. Though this was not before some more coaxing which made Sawyer want to punch his fist against a brick wall. They ate in silence that day. Hr didn't even talk to her about Winter's latest adventure or the newest animal rescued to the CMA. His mom didn't seem to have a lot to offer when it came to topics, and for once Sawyer found that he was grateful for it. It gave him time to indulge in the fact that he was going to have to solve this. He felt like it was his fault, yet he knew that it wasn't. It wasn't Hazel's fault either, Sawyer would never blame her for this. It was just one of those things. Nobody was to blame but the problem had to be fixed before it became too great. Sawyer considered calling her that night. But he didn't. No matter how embarrassed he was, this wasn't something to solve over the phone. The right thing would be to meet her and talk about it face to face. \"Good night, Hazel\" he whispered to himself before turning of the light and rolled over. XXX He woke early. A small stream of sunlight shined through the curtains and teased him. The watch on his nightstand showed 06:47. Sawyer sighed and buried his face in the pillow to block out everything. He groaned to himself. He didn't have to get up for another two hours so why on earth was it decided that he was to wake up now ? \"Stupid\" he muttered, face down. Everything was stupid. Hazel's POV Coco powder, milk, whipped cream, marshmallows and cinnamon should do the trick, Hazel thought as she mixed just those ingredients to make a luxurious cup of hot chocolate. With everything that had happened, Hazel reckoned that she could at least do that without feeling ashamed of herself. \"Comfort eating, Hazel?\" her dad smirked from where he was standing in a corner, taking a sip of his coffee. Grandpa Reed chuckled without looking up from the newspaper he was reading thoroughly. Hazel looked up and eyed her dad, eyes narrowing. \"No\" she answered grumpily. \"Then why are you making yourself a sugar bomb this early in the day?\" \"Because I want to. And technically we're still in the weekend, it's Sunday, dad. So I'm fully entitled to make a sugar bomb this early in the day.\" \"You are, Hazel\" Reed said, finally taking his eyes off the newspaper. \"But like your father said, the question is why . You never do it unless something is wrong.\" \"Would you please just talk to us, sweetheart?\" Clay begged. Hazel clenched her jaw. She felt like she was ambushed by wolves, like they were ganging up on her. Which they kind of were, since she hadn't said a word about the incident to any of them and wasn't about to start now, they seized every opportunity to try and surprise it out of her. \"I'm taking this to my room now.\" She gestured towards the cup in her hand and started making her way to the door. \"Hazel…\" Clay sighed. \"Don't Hazel me, dad.\" Then she closed the door without another word. She could hear her dad and grandfather talk outside but she couldn't make out exactly what it was they were saying. Deciding that she didn't really care, she quickly typed in Julia's number, hoping that she could talk to her. When all she got was Julia's voice mail she cursed to herself and hung up. \"Damn it, Julia! Why aren't you awake when I need you?\" She heard a knock on the door. Hazel almost threw her pillow at it in annoyance and anger. \"Go away, dad\" she spat through the wood. \"It's grandpa\" the owner of the voice replied. \"Fine…\" Reed opened the door and stood there watching her for a moment before he entered fully. He walked over to her bed and sat down next to his granddaughter. \"Did dad send you in here to talk to me?\" Hazel asked through clenched teeth, her annoyance and anger shining through her. \"Something like that\" Reed answered and then chuckled to her surprise. \"But I'm not going to do that. Because I know that you won't answer my questions anyway.\" \"True.\" Hazel couldn't help but chuckle too, but it was without any happiness. She leaned her head on her grandfather's shoulder who took a reassuring hold of her hand. \"It's going to be alright, Hazel. Just you wait and see…\" XXX Sawyer's POV \"Hi, listen Hazel, we need to talk? Uh… Hazel, do you have a minute? I think we should talk. I don't want to lose you!\" He slammed his fist against the wall outside the CMA where he stood rambling conversation starters to himself. Why was this so hard? \"Shit! I don't even know how to begin!\" \"Why don't we just start with 'hello'?\" Sawyer spun around to see his girlfriend standing there with her arms crossed. She tried to look neutral but Sawyer could read her eyes like an open book by now. She tried to conceal how scared and nervous she actually was. \"Shit! You scared me!\" Sawyer rubbed the back of his neck. \"Sorry. But like I said, should be start with 'hello'?\" \"Sounds good.\" \"Good. Hello.\" \"Hello.\" She took a step forward, then another and another until they were only a couple of feet apart. Sawyer felt Hazel's eyes burning him from top to bottom. She didn't look angry, guess that was at least something, but her gaze made him more nervous than he already was. \"And now that we've established that, we do need to talk.\" \"You're right. We do.\" Sawyer took a deep breath before continuing. \"How do you feel, Hazel? I mean, about all this.\" \"It's difficult to explain.\" \"Do you think we went to fast? I think we did.\" Hazel exhaled loudly. \"Not so much 'too fast' as… I don't know, okay! But it didn't feel good!\" \"Yeah well, it wasn't that great for me either! And why didn't you tell me to stop if I hurt you?!\" \"Because I thought it would be better with time. I thought that the pain would go away after a while!\" \"Well obviously it didn't!\" He hadn't even realized that he had raised his voice to the point where he almost screamed. This did not go according to plan. He took a step away to calm down. \"Look, I don't want to fight with you.\" Hazel nodded. \"And I don't want to fight either. Sawyer, I'm so sorry for everything. That I didn't tell you what I wanted, that things didn't go well, for that stupid note, for avoiding you… I don't want to lose you.\" \"You won't, and you don't have to apologize for any of that. It wasn't your fault.\" \"It wasn't yours either.\" \"True. So what do you say that we forget about all this and start over? We don't have to try again until we're thirty if that's what you want.\" Hazel laughed. Her expression had softened. She actually smiled when she put her arms around his neck. Sawyer had to smile back as he snaked his arms around her waist. \"I'm not saying to wait ten years\" she chuckled. \"Just a little while, and then we'll try again, try some new stuff and see if that makes it better.\" \"That sounds really good\" Sawyer sighed. He leaned his forehead in the crook of her neck for a second before looking her in the eye and cupping her face with his hand. \"I love you, Hazel.\" \"I love you too.\" She kissed him long and deep and Sawyer wasn't afraid to respond, finally feeling at ease again. Hopefully this lead up to your expectations! Let me know! Click the big white review-button to share your thoughts! ;) Tell me what you think! I can promise you that the next chapter will not take a month to be published. Simple Swedish of the chapter: Prata – Talk[Chapter 29] Hi my lovelys! As promised, a quicker update than the last one. I'm sorry that it's so short, it was all I could master for this one. Hopefully the next one will be longer! However, enjoy this one! Chapter 29 – Fast forward Hazel's POV She couldn't believe it. She honestly couldn't believe it. In just three days, she was set to go to college with Sawyer. Only three days! Hazel couldn't understand the fact that nothing was in her way now. She had Sawyer, she had her family, she had an amazing best friend, she had the CMA and all its animals and now she had college as well. Of course she was going to miss this place. Clearwater was her home and nothing could change that, but she felt excited to leave for a while. Campus was only a train ride from home so it wasn't like they were going to the other end of the country. Her home would always be close and she was grateful. Sawyer was too. He had been worried about Winter. Whether she'd be okay without him for such long periods of time, though Hazel was sure she would be. Winter had Hope to keep her company and it wasn't as if they would be gone forever. Hazel was sure they would all be okay. There was also one other thing Hazel looked forward to. A surprise for Sawyer. They hadn't booked tickets on a train yet, Hazel knew why, but Sawyer didn't. His mother had just told him that she had taken care of it whenever he asked about it. \"Hazel? Hey, Haze?\" Sawyer said, breaking her out of her thoughts. He was sitting on her chair in her room as she picked out an outfit for tonight. Her dad and Lorraine were hosting a goodbye party for them. It was nothing fancy, just them, friends and family gathered to say goodbye. \"What?\" Hazel asked. \"What are you thinking about?\" \"Everything, I guess…\" \"Are you okay?\" She smiled gently at him, her heart soaring with the fact that he cared. Hazel walked up to him and leaned down to kiss him. His hand traveled up her arm and rested against her jaw. She couldn't help but smile into the kiss and he smiled back. \"I'm great. I love you.\" \"I love you too, babe.\" She gave him a peck on the lips before she walked back to her closet and pulled out two dresses. One was pink with off the shoulder lace sleeves, and the other was in different shades of green that melted together and formed a pattern, it ended just above the knees and had an empire waist. \"Which one looks the best?\" Sawyer pursed his lips before answering. \"The green one.\" \"Perfect choice.\" And with that she put the pink one back and then pulled the sundress she was wearing over her head and stood before him in her underwear. Sawyer's jaw dropped slightly and his eyes traveled down her curves. \"What?\" \"Uh…\" Sawyer mumbled, whilst sending her a nodding gesture towards her purple bra. \"Oh come on, Sawyer! It's not like you haven't seen this before.\" She pulled the green dress over her head and let it fall down over her body. Hazel removed her bra straps to stop them from being seen. \"Help me with the zipper?\" He got up from the chair and walked towards her as she turned around. His hands fumbled with the zipper for a few moments before he pulled it up. Hazel turned around when he was done and kissed him. Sawyer immediately deepened the kiss and put his arms around her. Hazel abruptly pulled back and Sawyer's lips followed her by instinct, trying to just get one more pressure of her lips against his. Hazel smirked. \"We'll be late\" she murmured and stepped away to grab her hair brush. \"Mean\" Sawyer responded. Hazel scoffed. \"Oh, I'm nice!\" Sawyer's POV When Hazel was done, he and Hazel took a ride with Clay to his house where the whole party was taking place. His family was there, Hazel's family too, most of the employers at the CMA and Hazel's friend Julia, Kyle was there with his new girlfriend. Sawyer's mom greeted him excitedly when they entered. \"Hi, honey!\" She smiled as she hugged him. \"Hazel, darling!\" She hugged Hazel too. \"Hey, Lorraine\" Hazel smiled back. \"How are you?\" \"Oh everything's great with me, you?\" \"Great here too! Come on, now! Everyone's in the living room. There's food and drink in the kitchen.\" They were dragged away into the living room, and there Sawyer was grabbed by Kyle. \"You made it, man!\" he exclaimed. He put his arm around Sawyer's shoulder and steered him into the kitchen to get him a drink. \"I guess I did.\" \"You should be really proud of yourself, you know.\" \"Yeah…\" \"Everything okay?\" Kyle looked at him with worry in his eyes. Sawyer sighed. It was just stupid nerves. \"Just nerves…\" Kyle nodded and his arm remained around Sawyer's shoulders. \"I know the feeling. It'll pass, just wait and see.\" Sawyer kept mingling around with the guests, listening to their congratulations and well wishes. He watched Hazel walk around doing the same thing. He watched her stand and talk to Julia for a while. They looked happy the both of them, but Sawyer saw a hint of sadness behind her smile. Hazel's POV \"I'm going to miss you\" Julia said as they stood beside a window. Hazel put her hand on Julia's shoulder. \"I'm going to miss you too.\" Julia took a deep breath put couldn't stop one single tear from falling down her cheek. Hazel quickly grabbed her friend by the shoulders and drew her in for a long, comforting hug. \"Oh, Julia, don't cry! We'll be fine.\" \"I'm sorry…\" \"I promise you, every time Sawyer and I come back to visit family and the CMA, we will meet up and go for sea food at Rob's. Since you'll be going to the local college, it will be no trouble.\" They released each other. \"Sounds good, Hazel.\" \"Good. Now, let's celebrate!\" They ate, drank, laughed, talked and had a great time. At one point, Hazel wasn't sure when, she and Sawyer ended up making out in his bedroom. That was until Lorraine caught them and scolded them both for being unsociable and acting so immature, while they were both blushing like crazy. All over it was a good afternoon. But she still had some nerves left, though who could blame her? As she said goodbye to Sawyer that night she felt nervous, when she sat in the back of the car on her way back home she felt nervous. Three days, that was all that remained. Three days and they were off. Only three days left and she and her boyfriend would be on their greatest adventure yet. Okay, my friends! Tell me what you think, I'm missing all your feedback! And we don't have much further to go, unfortunately! I love you all! To be continued in \"Packing\". Simple Swedish of the chapter: Travel - Resa[Chapter 30] Hi my beautiful lovleys! I don't really have much to say right now… So… Enjoy! Chapter 30 – Packing Hazel's POV \"Two days\" was the first thing that left Hazel's mouth when she woke up on Monday morning. Two freaking days! The anxiety she had felt the night before had been replaced with excitement. She looked over and saw her suit case which stood proudly beside her desk, waiting to be filled with clothes and everything else she would need. Hazel quickly reached for her phone and dialed Sawyer's number. \" Yeah?\" his voice croaked on the other line. \"Two days, Sawyer!\" Hazel exclaimed into the phone with a stupid smile on her face. \" What? \" \"Two days!\" It was quiet for a moment before Sawyer caught on about was she was talking about. \" Right… I know.\" \"I'm so excited!\" \" Hazel, I was sleeping…\" \"I know! But it's time to wake up now Sawyer! I'm coming over!\" \" I'm in pajamas…\" \"So? Babe, I've seen you in your pajamas before.\" \" Hazel… \" \"Sawyer…\" \" Fine… \" And with that he hung up. Hazel giggled as she stepped out of bed and quickly got dressed and took a piece of bread to eat on the way to her bike. She quickly rode over to his house and knocked on the door. Lorraine greeted her and said that he was still in bed, not that she was all that surprised. Also, Lorraine demanded to know whether she had had breakfast or not, and when Hazel said she had eaten a slice of bread Lorraine immediately scolded her for not eating more for breakfast. She left Lorraine in the kitchen who was now busy making a traditional American breakfast for her son and his girlfriend. Hazel quietly sneaked into his room. Sawyer looked like he was sleeping but when she closed the door behind her, he spoke. \"Hi, babe\" he murmured. God she loved his voice in the morning, always so deep and husky. She smiled and went to lie down next to him. She planted a kiss on his temple as he put his arm around her shoulders and nuzzled her neck. \"How did you know it was me?\" she asked. \"I didn't say anything.\" He opened his eyes to look at her. \"I could smell your perfume.\" Hazel blushed at his comment and the blush deepened when he inhaled her scent just to prove it. \"I take it that's good?\" she whispered. \"It is. You smell great.\" Hazel rested her cheek against his forehead for a while. Eventually she thought Sawyer had actually fallen asleep again, he didn't speak and his breathing pattern was slow and even. He even snored softly once or twice. She hit his arm. \"Don't fall asleep! We have a long day ahead of us.\" Sawyer grunted in response and insisted on them staying in bed for just a few more minutes. \"No.\" She released herself from their little cocoon and pulled blankets of his body. \"Hazel!\" he croaked. \"Come on!\" She took a firm hold on his wrist and dragged him out of bed. Still leading him by the wrist, her all perky and happy and him in wrinkly clothes and dragging his feet behind her they walked to the nearest bathroom. Hazel opened the door and gently pushed him inside. \"You, shower, now.\" She closed the door and walked away. Moments later she heard the sound of running water and smiled smugly to herself. \"So you finally managed to move him away from that nesting place of his?\" Lorraine asked, smiling as she flipped a pancake. \"Not without complaining, but yeah.\" Lorraine chuckled at her answer. Hazel started to help by putting out plates, glasses and utensils for the three of them. As one dish by one was done she put that on the table too. She was surprised at how many kinds of dishes Lorraine had managed to cook in such a short period of time. There was bacon, pancakes, toast and scrambled eggs. Sawyer came out of the shower soon after, a towel hanging at his waist, his hair wet and tousled and water drops glistening all over his body. His body looked so defined, Hazel fad to fight hard not to bite her lip. She looked down on her feet to stop herself of ogling. \"Honey, go and get dressed so we can eat some breakfast\" Lorraine said. Hazel noticed Sawyer smirk at her before he entered his room and closed the door. She also noticed Lorraine eyeing her, but neither of them said anything. As soon as Sawyer took a seat at the table, Hazel dived into the bacon. Nothing could beat bacon in the morning. Well… Almost nothing. Chocolate had its perks too. Sawyer's POV Sawyer chuckled as he saw Hazel munch on the bacon. He had settled for toast since he wasn't much of a breakfast person, though Lorraine kept insisting on his eating something else as well. Hazel on the other hand? When she was hungry, she ate. And she ate a lot. You couldn't tell since she was the most gorgeous girl on earth. Though he wasn't shallow, he would have loved her equally no matter what she weighed. After breakfast he was ushered into his room again by his mother, she told him it was time to pack. When he told her that he had days left and there wasn't any rush to pack, she almost freaked and said that he would be grateful she nagged at him, because 'you always forget something and you want time to remember that'. They threw all of Sawyer's shirts on the bed and started to one by one pack the down in his suit case. Hazel sat on his chair with her feet leaning on the edge of his bed. Occasionally she helped him reach his shirts, but mostly she just sat and commented on which shirt were a must to bring with him. Apparently everything he owned that was red was a must. Not that he owned many red shirts. Red was always Hazel's color, not his. \"Haze, help me reach that one?\" He pointed towards a blue t-shirt beside her feet. \"Yeah sure\" she answered and reached out her arm to grab it before throwing it towards him a little too hard, seeing as it hit him hard in the face. \"Oh God, I'm sorry, Sawyer! Are you okay?\" But Sawyer just laughed. \"I'm fine, don't worry.\" He smirked as he folded the t-shirt and put it in the bag. \"You're stronger than you look.\" Hazel cocked an eyebrow at him. \"Was that a compliment or an insult?\" \"A little of both\" Sawyer smirked. Hazel threw a second shirt at his face, hard on purpose this time. \"Ouch!\" \"Serves you right!\" Sawyer quickly crossed the room and took her face between his hands and kissed her hard. Their lips moved in tandem as Hazel sneaked her hands up to rest at the sides of his hip. His tongue touched her lips, begging for entrance which Hazel immediately obliged. By the time they broke apart, they were both panting. Hazel put her hand on his shoulder to hold him at bay as she tried to catch her breath. \"Apology accepted\" she panted. Sawyer laughed and pulled her to her feet. When she was up he wrapped his arms around her and drew her close. Her arms came around his waist as he held her. Sawyer breathed in her sweet scent. A mixture between her and her glorious perfume. \"Thank you\" he heard her whisper, slightly muffled since her head was buried in his chest. \"For what?\" he asked confused. \"I don't know… Everything.\" He smiled and placed a gentle kiss on the top of her head. XXX It was well into the afternoon when they were done packing at Sawyer's and made their way to the CMA and the boathouse to pack up Hazel's things too. Sawyer noticed Hazel acting weird as they walked inside. It looked like she was checking around, making sure nobody was inside. And when they entered her room and she closed the door behind them she made no effort to start packing. \"So… Should we start with your clothes?\" Sawyer tried. \"We can pack tomorrow\" Hazel whispered and approached him from behind, wrapping his arms around him. She gently kissed part between his shoulder blades. \"Hazel..?\" She walked around and faced him. Then took a hold of his hip and led him towards the bed. He knew where this was going and he wasn't about to pretend he didn't want to. He felt the evidence of his wanton, but there were just so many risks. \"Hazel, we can't. Your dad and Reed…\" \"Are both at a board meeting\" she finished for him. \"They won't be back for hours. Dad texted me before.\" \"But- But I thought we were going to wait a while.\" \"We have waited.\" She pushed him gently so that he was sitting down on her bed and she was standing in between his parted legs, with his hands on her waist and her on his shoulders. \"Yeah… Like a couple of weeks.\" Something changed in her eyes. \"Don't you want to?\" \"Of course I do\" he reassured her. He kissed her hard just to prove his point. \"I want to.\" He smiled at her before pulling her down with him on the bed. FLUFF! Let me know what you think about this chapter! Review, people! Everyone loves them! ; ) Alright, I will see you soon! Hugs![Chapter 31] Well here we are. This is the last official chapter. The last one will be an epilogue. Right now I don't know how long it will be, probably around with same length as the chapters. Enjoy the last chapter with me! Chapter 31 – Goodbye Hazel's POV Hazel clutched Sawyer's hand tightly as they sat in the front of the audience, listening to what her dad was saying in the microphone. Her heart squeezed with every word and she felt tears sting in the corners of her eyes. Sawyer leaned in and gave her a peck on the temple whilst giving her hand a reassuring squeeze. She smiled at him and mouthed \"thank you\". He smiled back and nodded. Clay was talking on and on about new beginnings and how their new beginning certainly didn't mean the end for them here. They were going away for a while and then coming back more experienced and educated than ever before. \"Hazel my darling\" Clay said into the microphone. \"My sweet, sweet daughter. Your grandfather and I are so proud of you and I know your mother would be too.\" Hazel wiped away a tear at the mention of her mother. \"I want you to head out into the world and learn things. Then I want you to come back, and maybe then it's time you started bossing me around instead of the other way around.\" There was a collective laugh among the CMA staff. \"My sweet girl, I don't really know how to express my happiness for you. I love you, honey!\" The crowd applauded and Hazel blew a kiss at her father's way. \"And Sawyer. Buddy, this is a great day for you. You too, are on your way to an adventure beyond anything you have experienced before. Man, I remember the first time we met. How you helped to rescue Winter and then became the one to help her survive. You have contributed so much to the CMA over the years. Everyone here is family, and I am so happy and proud that you are a part of it.\" Again, the crowd applauded and Hazel kissed his cheek as he too became a little teary. \"I and everyone here want to thank you guys for everything you have done. We will miss you so much, and we already can't wait for you two to come back.\" There was a third round of applause as Sawyer and Hazel stepped onto the small podium. Hazel hugged her dad firmly and then took the microphone from him. \"Wow. Well, I think this is the first time when I don't really know what to say.\" The crowd laughed. \"My whole life has been centered around this place and it's hard to say goodbye.\" She took a deep breath and felt Sawyer's hand snake into hers. \"But like dad said, this isn't an infinite goodbye. It's just goodbye for now. And you all know how much I will miss you, and I love you all so much. Guys, why do you think I'm weeping?\" They laughed again. \"We will see you soon.\" Sawyer received the microphone from his girlfriend. \"My turn now. Well, I think Hazel has already pointed out how we both feel. I think it's hard to be separated from everyone here, especially Winter. But I've realized that everything will be okay in the end. Thank you guys for everything you have done! Thank you!\" The goodbyes went on and on, and with every new person to say goodbye to Hazel felt her heart beat a little faster. Why, she did not know. Maybe it was the realization that this was really happening or maybe the fear of nothing going according to plan. She had just hugged and exchanged words of encouragement with Phoebe when she looked to her side and saw something that made her smile so much it almost hurt her cheeks. How many times had Julia not complained about wanting to meet someone since her stupid ex boyfriend dumped her two years ago? And look at what was happening now! A boy wearing a volunteer t-shirt just like her held out his hand for her to shake. He had light brown hair just like Julia, he was tall and towered over her. But his cheesy heart eyes could be seen from miles away. \"Hi\" the boy said. \"I'm Will.\" Julia shook his hand and smiled. She looked absolutely smitten and a small blush colored her cheeks. \"Julia.\" Will raised her hand to his mouth and kissed it lightly. Julia's blush deepened. \"What are you smiling at?\" Sawyer asked who had appeared from nowhere and was slithering his arms around her shoulders from behind and she rested her head against his chest. \"Look at those two\" Hazel gestured towards Julia and Will who were now laughed nervously at something, both blushing. \"They're cute. Julia deserves someone like him.\" \"You don't know him.\" \"I've seen enough.\" She turned around in his embrace and drew him closer by putting her arms around his middle. \"It's like with us two. Sometimes, you just know.\" Sawyer smiled and kissed her sweetly. \"I love you.\" \"I love you too.\" XXX Sawyer's POV An hour later they were ushered out of the hall and onto the streets. Now it was just him, Hazel, his mom, Clay and Reed. He preferred it like that. The last goodbye should the intimate one with just the people you care most about. \"I have something for you, Honey\" his mom said and smiled slyly. She disappeared for a few minutes and then reappeared and it made his jaw drop. She arrived in a car he had never seen before. \"This is yours, sweetie.\" His mind was blank. He got a driver's license on his eighteenth birthday but he never actually imagined him getting a car until like, after college or something. For a while he just stood there and gaped whilst the others looked at him with amused expressions. \"Mine?\" he finally croaked out. \"Yes, honey. All yours.\" \"Oh my god!\" Finally he reacted. He threw himself in his mother's arms and hugged her so tightly he was sure he crushed a couple of her ribs. \"Oh my god, mom!\" \"Sweetie, I'm really happy for you but you're a lot bigger and stronger than me now so maybe you could loosen the grip just a little bit?\" Sawyer both cried and laughed as he released his mother from his bear like hug. \"I don't know what to say… Thank you!\" \"I was nothing, honey. Use it well.\" After hugging his mother again he looked at Hazel who eyed him with a knowing smile on her lips. \"Did you know about this?\" he asked her. \"Might have\" she answered and smiled just as slyly as his mother just had. \"Alright you two, it's time to get going\" Clay said. \"He's right\" Lorraine said. \"Your things are already packed in the trunk and I've installed my GPS for you to borrow. So off you go!\" The last hugs were exchanged and they both got inside the car. And then they were off. They drove for a while before stopping to buy some snacks to eat and drink on the rest of the way. Sawyer knew he had to focus on the road but he still sneaked glances on Hazel who entertained herself on the road by reading and looking out the window. She ate the Cheez Doodles they bought a while back. He smiled at the sight of her. His beautiful girl – woman . She was a woman now. God he loved her so much! XXX Their first day was upon them. They stood outside of the doors and watched the other students pour in. His head turned towards her. She looked nervous but happy, excited. Her eyes met his and her smile widened. She stood on her toes and kissed him. \"Ready?\" Sawyer asked. \"Ready\" Hazel answered. Awww..! Almost time to say goodbye! Only the epilogue left! I love you all! Leave a review! Simple Swedish of the chapter: Nästan – Almost[Chapter 32] Okay guys. This is it. The epilogue. I can't believe it. This is the end. I'm quite speechless so I'll just let you read it now. Enjoy! Epilogue Hazel sighed, content as she stood in front of the mirror, waiting for the makeup artist to put her final touches on her face and the hair dresser fastened the veil in her hair. She couldn't believe it. At age 26 she was getting married. She wasn't nervous, she had been longing for this for far too long. No, she was just happy and calm. Her reflection in the mirror smiled back at her. The dress was a-line and strapless. The bodice was covered in lace that lessened in the skirt until there wasn't any. Sea pearls and other types of rhinestones were embroidered onto the bodice as well. The skirt was made of a flowing thin material in many layers. So when she walked it looked like she was floating. Her hair was in a curly half up do. The veil was fastened where the up do was fastened and flowers crowned it. The makeup was simple but striking. Hazel's eyes were accentuated with earthy colors and her lipstick was a sheer cherry color. She was quite proud that she had managed to fulfill the traditional banter about 'something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue'. The old she wore was her mother's necklace, the same on she wore at the prom. Hazel had made one of her bracelets with tiny sea animals, this time with Winter and Hope on it, she wore this around her ankle as something new. At first she was worried about 'something borrowed' but then Lorraine had offered to let her borrow a beautiful sea pearl bracelet, which she did. And the blue? Well, she had bought lacy blue underwear especially for this day. \"You look so beautiful, Hazel\" Julia said, leaning on Hazel's shoulder and hugging her. \"Sawyer will melt into a puddle when he sees you.\" \"Well, let's hope so. I didn't buy this dress for nothing\" Hazel joked. Julia chuckled. Julia was dressed in the coral bride's maid dress Hazel had picked out for her maid of honor and her other bride's maid Becca. She met Becca in college and they were still close, though Julia had been with her through thick and thin and since she didn't have any siblings she considered Julia to be the perfect candidate for a maid of honor. Julia's cell phone started ringing, interrupting their moment. \"Sorry\" she excused herself and walked away to answer. \"Hi, honey.\" Julia was quiet for a moment as she listened to what the caller said. \"Yes, I'm fine. I promise you I'm fine, don't worry. Yes. Yes!\" She was quiet again and then laughed. \"Listen, I'll see you after the ceremony, okay? I love you too. Bye.\" She hung up and walked back to Hazel. \"Will?\" \"Yeah. He's gotten really protective recently. Constantly checking up on me. Ever since well…this happened.\" She stroked her growing baby bump. Julia and Will got married the year before (in which ceremony Hazel had been the maid of honor) and only weeks after, when they returned from their honeymoon Julia had come barging inside Sawyer's and Hazel house, squealing incomprehensible words until Hazel finally calmed her down and found out about the situation. That was six months ago. \"Ten minutes\" the wedding planner announced as she walked through the door. Becca entered shortly after. \"Oh, you look beautiful, darling\" Becca said and hugged Hazel just like Julia had. \"Are you nervous?\" \"Surprisingly, no\" Hazel answered. \"Just happy.\" Becca gave her shoulders a reassuring squeeze and then moved to stand by Julia's side. She leaned down and got on her knees. \"Oh Motherhood!\" she squealed and placed a hand on Julia's stomach. \"Hi, baby!\" Hazel and Julia smiled at the scene. Becca had this really cute obsession with motherhood, wanting ten children in the future. At least that was what she said to her fearful boyfriend. \"Five minutes\" The wedding planner said. \"We should get into position.\" The three girls embraced each other in a group hug quickly before grabbing their bouquets and walked through the door. They were all the same, with the small detail that Hazel's was bigger than the other two. It was filled with white and pale pink roses, lilies of the valley and purple sweet peas. But the flower Hazel treasured the most was the white lilies. They had been her mother's favorite flower and it felt like having a connection with her along with the necklace. Clay stood outside the door, in the hallway of the church, waiting for them. Hazel had rarely seen him in a tux, but he wore one today and she had never seen him so handsome or so proud. \"Wow, dad\" she whispered and looked at him in awe. \"You look really handsome.\" Clay swallowed hard. He took a deep breath before saying anything. \"You look just like her\" he whispered in a hoarse voice. \"You're so beautiful, my sweet girl…\" \"Thank you.\" She hugged him. \"But please don't cry just yet, okay? If you cry, I'll cry and I don't want to smudge the makeup just yet.\" She winked at him when he nodded and blinked rapidly a few times to force back the tears. \"Into positions, everyone!\" The wedding planner called. \"One minute.\" Hazel and her father placed themselves right at the front, with Julia and Becca right behind them. She felt someone correct the train but she wasn't sure who. Probably Charlie, the wedding planner. \"I wish mom was here\" Hazel confessed. \"She is\" Clay assured her. The music started, slightly muffled due to the closed door. She could hear the first few notes play and then the doors opened. Every guest stood up in their seats and their eyes were upon them. They had chosen the traditional wedding marsh. Charlie ushered them to move forward, and so they did. Everywhere she looked, she saw smiles viewing her. She held a tight grip on Clay arm as they slowly walked down the aisle, afraid she might trip on her dress or her own clumsiness. The aisle felt miles long but at the same time not more than a few steps. Finally, about halfway down, Hazel was able to see Sawyer clearly. He smiled at her. A wide joyful smile but she could see the emotions play out in his eyes. Anticipation, anxiousness, awe, overwhelm and pure joy. She knew exactly what it was he was feeling because it was the same thing she was feeling. His eyes sized her up and down and his smile widened. It's finally happening! Sawyer looked so handsome in his black tuxedo, with a black vest and silver tie. A pale pink rose like the one in her bouquet was fastened at his side. She had never seen his look so happy before. His face was priceless. Hazel honestly couldn't believe that she was just a few minutes away from being married to him. It was happening. They stopped in front of the altar. Clay gave Hazel a quick peck on the cheek before handing her over to her future husband. Hazel took the hand Sawyer offered and stepped up on the altar to pace the priest. \"Dearly beloved. We are gathered here today to witness the union this man and this woman in holy matrimony…\" The priest went on and on talking about God and love, about unions and bonds. How marriage was a gift God bestowed on us. She didn't really listen. All she could care about was the man looking down at her. He mouthed you are so beautiful discreetly to not disturb the speech the old man was giving them. \"The rings please\" the priest said and Sawyer received them from Kyle. The priest took them, blessed them and gave them back Sawyer and Hazel to give to each other. \"Do you, Sawyer Frederick Nelson, take Hazel Holly Haskett to be your lawfully wedded wife?\" Sawyer looked straight into Hazel's eyes when he answered. \"I do.\" He slipped the wedding ring on her finger. \"And do you, Hazel Holly Haskett, take Sawyer Frederick Nelson to be your lawfully wedded husband?\" Hazel swallowed and answered in a slightly choked voice. \"I do.\" She slipped his ring on his finger. For a moment, it was like everything was quiet. She couldn't hear anyone or anything. She couldn't hear Lorraine's choked sobs or the occasional cough or sniff. All she saw was Sawyer and how he smiled down at her and she smiled at him. \"I now pronounce you husband and wife\" the priest said, breaking her out of her bubble. \"You may now kiss the bride.\" Sawyer wasted no time in pulling her towards him, cupping her face with both his hands, kissing her both gently and fierce. One of Hazel's hands covered Sawyer's and the other snaked around his shoulders and pulled him closer to her. She could hear the guests applauding and cheering in the background but her focus was solemnly on her husband and his focus on his wife. When the broke apart Sawyer was still reluctant to let go of her he still embraced her. Lorraine was sobbing in the front with Clay holding his arm around her shoulders. Hazel couldn't help but laugh. Everything was just so perfect. The reception was held in a hotel beside the beach so they had a beautiful view of the sea as they settled in. \"A toast for the bride and groom\" Clay said loudly to announce the guests. Everyone toasted and Sawyer and Hazel looked straight into each other's eyes as they drank the champagne. It wasn't a big, fancy wedding. Only fifty people were invited and came. They had catering for the first and second course. After that they had ordered a cake before hand to eat. The guests mingled for a while whilst Hazel and Sawyer had their pictures taken down by the beach. Soon after that, the first course was served. A little of every shellfish plate. Then they got the main course which was steak. Pretty simple, but they preferred it that way. The color scheme of the wedding was white and coral (Sawyer was slightly reluctant at first, but he couldn't deny the pleadings of his then fiancé), but they tried to honor the sea and its animals somehow. Like having the reception by the beach and Hazel's wrist-bracelet. By 19:30, the cake was wheeled in. The fondant of it was white. However the decorations looked like turquoise waves washed up upon it. Also there were tiny crystals made of sugar, pale pink roses and white lilies like in her bouquet. The cake topper was two silver dolphins that formed a heart, tail and beak touching. Inside there was sponge cake, blueberry jam, white chocolate mousse and lemon curd cream. Later they danced. Sawyer and Hazel moved slowly to the music of the first dance. Everyone took pictures of them, and then the music changed into something a lot funkier. At first, Julia and Will were the only ones to dare to join them dancing on the dance floor, though it was obvious that Will wanted her to take it slow. Though soon the others understood that they were allowed to join the two couples. XXX The feast went on for hours, but then it was time for them wrap it up and leave for Hawaii. Hazel changed into a simple cream colored dress before they left. They hugged their friends and family before getting in the taxi. \"God, I love you\" Sawyer whispered as they sat in the back seat. \"I love you too.\" Oh man! Now what?
